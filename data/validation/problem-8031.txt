“What is what?”
"You haven't changed the sign," he says, stepping inside and kicking the dust from his heels.
“Duh, with number one.”
"Is it?"
“Nǐ hǎo,” Tony says, grinning so hard his cheeks are pink, “Nǐ hǎo ma?”
"We run marathons, Tony," says Steve, and he's smiling like he's not quite sure how to stop, and Tony is hit by the sudden need to kiss him, so he keeps talking.
Steve is crying.
'Always,' he wants to say, 'always and forever and then some more.'
"Just read them," Tony says, and he's so quiet Steve can hardly be sure he heard anything at all.
The light is coming through the windows, stretching across Tony's jacket and painting his face in cool blue. He looks phosphorescent, glowing dim in the low light of the coffee shop. Steve yearns, aches, feels that urge to touch and tangle, bury itself in layers and layers of Tony Stark and never let go.
“It’s something Jarvis used to talk about.”
“We’d like to book one butt corn cobb,” Steve says, and the elbow Tony throws lands stiff between his ribs.
“That’s the one.”
Steve doesn’t know anything about time, except that he’s happy to spend his here.
'This love is going to burn you to the ground,' says a voice, angry and bitter and wrong.
“Seriously,” Steve laughs, toes against the chill, cold chase of evening that bites at his cheeks, “skinny dipping?”
His hands are still roaming, running down arms and smoothing at wrinkles, ironing out the kinks in his undersuit.
“Cataclysm,” Steve says sagely, and then he scribbles it on the page, sharpie dark and bleeding through the paper,
Tony frowns, rolling onto his back till there’s nothing but sky, soft sigh of blue to the tip of the earth.
Crips white paper. Firm tucked edges. Lonely and small and made out a straw wrapper. He opens it.
'This coffee's hot, but it doesn't hold a candle to you.'
But Steve just stands, arms at his sides, and it's not about the dishes, but it's not quite about them yet either, so Tony just smiles and says,
And Tony just cries harder, shaking like the breeze, warm and wet and a little bit desperate.
‘You changed mine,’ he doesn’t say.
He’s always smiling.
"You smell like a bar," Steve says, and it's softer than Tony needs, but less than he deserves.
"I told a teeny little lie to Pepper that may or may not have spiraled," he groans, falling onto the couch and kicking his knees up to rest on Steve's legs, a thing of habit.
“What? It’s gonna be fun.”
When Tony finally speaks, it's so soft Steve wonders if he heard anything at all.
The silence is a breathless melody.
---------------------------------
The break, when it comes, has a pulse. Beats in his chest. Steve knows this song. He is used to the way quiet lives in his cheeks. Tastes desperation, gritty on his tongue, kisses closed the 'I love you's' that threaten to pour through teeth and land at their feet. They urge, whisper, moan and sigh and beg to roll off his tongue and shake this foundation. This careful laid thing before them.
Feels that tremor in his fists that rattles his brain like loose change, sees nothing but red, a desert sky that stretches between them.
"Are you fucking kidding me."
"No point. There is nothing more impossible than you."
They're in the kitchen. The radio is playing something Steve knows all the words to, and he sets down the whisk to wrap his arms around Tony. He sways, back in forth, and all Tony can hear is his heartbeat, firm and loud in his ears. Steve is a steady weight behind him, a warm presence, and he bends low, whispering the words to the song in his ear, and he just cant stand it. It's too warm, too soft, too good for him, and when he opens his eyes he's crying.
“Change the world?”
"God, way to eat Clint's hand germs. If you think he washes them, you're kidding yourself."
“Yes?”
And then they do.
“So we’re at a Chinese restaurant because...”
“Just yours.”
Tony says nothing. It’s better that way.
“He got it wrong,” Steve finally says.
-------------------------
"Bean mine?"
Steve just sighs.
There is ice down his back. There is ice down his back and ice does not belong there.
He grabs the salt. There are moment for heartache, but this is not one of them.
“Steve,” he snorts.
Steve hasn’t quite figured that out yet.
sometimes, Tony. You can’t divorce a cartoon corn cobb on your ass.”
Tony's wrists shook, reverberating with the need to touch, to hold. He wanted to stand, grab ahold of his jaw with soft fingers and tug, till Steve stopped sighing, till he wasn't sad and loose and desperate.
And Steve starts to laugh again, but Tony doesn’t smile. Just stares and stares and barely seems to breathe.
Steve
“It’s an old Chinese saying. First there is a mountain, then there is no mountain.”
And it’s a little broken, halting at its edges, but they’re all smiling, laughing like friends and joking like fools, and Steve starts to smile too.
“Or that baseball cap you wore for six weeks straight when we were nine,” and he’s laughing again, a rush of something that trips off his tongue, “Or the-”
“Yep.”
Just in case.
“I have to make someone laugh until they cry.”
"No bluer than yours," Steve huffs, picking his book back up, and settling in.
'Dear god, do I want to kiss you.'
"You really gotta hit that soon. Your balls have got to be blue at this point."
The night is soft, dizzy with wonder, and it’s cold, chilly somehow, like the sky’s up and kissed away the sun, but he’s warm. The day blows cool at his cheeks, mouthing at his jaw till he’s pink all over, but he’s warm, washed in summer like love could feed him, and it’s sudden. Certain, the way he can’t seem to drown the want in the space between his ribs, the pull and tug and drag, the desperate kind of way he is aching to kiss away the stumble in the lines of Tony’s mouth, so he stares and stares and tries not to speak.
The sky melts to darkness at the lip of the world, cold hum of black that seeps to the water, brushing at their toes with a chill that startles. The stars play at dancing, laughing at the sun, shaking and sighing where the night kisses day. And Tony is smiling right with them.
Tony keeps his back to him, but it’s soft when he speaks, empty air to the tone of his voice.
---------------------------------------
To be fair, it wasn't Steve's coffee shop.
First there is a mountain, then there is no mountain.
“I’m gonna let him pick.”
"You're gonna get yourself killed. I can’t sit here and watch you get killed."
Pepper was not amused by his witty inner dialogue, clearly, and the pinched look turned something sour.
"That's a nice mug you got."
Peggy's mom owned the shop, and it seemed to sing, bright and warm as she was, covered in sun colored tiles and honeydew vinyl. It was the kind of place where everything and nothing seemed to happen, people passing through in search of better places, spilling into Café au Lait like the sun through the windows.
Ashley doesn’t bother to look, just scribbles at something on the desk and says, “What’s what?”
Tony completely deserves the face full of water he gets, mind you.
“C’mon, it’s for the list.”
“At least the bus has air conditioning?” Steve says, and he swipes at his forehead, pawing at his shirt with two hands and rubbing at his cheeks with the hem of it.
“I didn’t do it yet.”
“Sick,” Tony says, “Anarchy.”
Tony wished he could see his face. The way his eyebrows settled into creases, the line of his lips. But if he moved, they'd stop talking.
Sometimes, in the quiet of the night, Steve will close his eyes, and imagine the sky. The kind of endless air that stretches between them.
“It’s a two for one,” Tony says smiling, “I get to cross something off my list, and you get to see me sans pants.”
He takes a breath. Goes back to sketching. He doesn't care.
Tony’s all profile, nose to the sky, and if Steve closes his eyes, he knows he’d hear the hum of his heart, knows the weight of the wishes he’d beg the sky to keep, knows Tony would smile and hum and talk about Orian.
'bum bum.'
They said as long as you can find Polaris, you can find your way home. Steve’s starting to wonder if he’ll ever be found again.
Reason #97: His hair curls just behind his ears the longer he goes without a cut
“I still have a fortune,” he breathes, and Steve wants to kiss him.
“Easy. We’re revolutionizing the culinary industry.”
“I see your point.”
“You get tired of
He calls, and calls, and there's nothing but a memory of a boy dancing around the coffee shop and telling him,
Steve blinks.
---------------------------------------------
“It’s a Crayola marker.”
And then he’s giggling, easy huff of laughter that melts off his tongue, and Steve is smiling too, shaking shoulders as the sun sinks to evening, cool brush of light that paints things still, and Steve is more in love than he’s ever been.
“So what’s number two?”
'Make a wish.'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A small one, made of paper, all crisp white and tucked firm into edges, and he laughs.
Tony, Tony, Tony.
Tony had his eyes closed, but from the way Steve's hand tightened a fraction in his hair, he could imagine the cool look Steve had settled on.
"I can’t do this. I can't sit here and watch you do this."
“Upheaval in its highest form.”
Steve blinks.
“And I don’t want a corn cobb,” he says finally, and it’s certain, all straight lines and clean brow, the easy sort of way he melts towards the door.
“Just tell me what it is.”
“Everything goes. First there is a mountain, then there is no mountain.”
Steve Rogers was a rail of a boy, all skinny limbs and golden hair. Barely seventeen and desperate to climb, shake off a lifetime of 'too little, not enough, needs more.' There was a pull in his chest, a yearning, a need to scale and reach and complete. There was a fire in his heart, a flame that shook and rattled with the wind, and he couldn't seem to quit the way it burns in his chest. The way it aches.
Steve is no fool. There is no universe where this thing works out okay. There are no shooting stars for boys like Steve. He is all bony arms and wobbly knees, hollow cheeks and orphan grit, but these moments fill him up for lifetimes. There are hundreds of stars left for wishing on, and Steve likes to think he could make just one of them count.
In the morning, they pour the bottle down the drain. It's not enough, but it's something.
'I love you.'
And then the man is smiling, really smiling, the kind that’s all teeth, laughing and laughing and begging over the dish boy.
"I'm fine, Steve, I'm fine."
Tony stops smiling.
He guesses he ought to change the list. '1000 Reasons I'm in Love with Tony Stark' has a much better ring to it.
The light’s gone blue, beating with his chest to the sound of silence, and Tony Stark is one hip to the counter and smiling like a child.
“We’re... making the perfect chocolate chip cookie.”
“I don’t understand.”
And Steve has miles, ocean of time and a belly full of promise, and what’s a month to something like love.
Steve’s fingers itch, curling into plastic where they press into the seat, and all he says is, “You’re probably gonna need better material.”
---------
Tony nods, reaching into the sink to grab Bruce's tea mug. The radio in the corner of the room is on, crooning something soft, and Tony smiles, just enough that the corners of his lips pull up, creasing his cheeks. When he reaches over to hand Steve the mug, Steve is there, ruddy cheeked, blinking and blinking at Tony till he lets out a breath. Tony counts, slow in his head, one, two, and then Steve blinks sharp, and reaches for the glass. The ache is back, a murmur behind the music, something steady and hot and blinding, and Tony swallows down the ache, the want, the need.
"You're still wet, aren’t you?"
And he listens.
He does come back.
Steve thinks his ears are buzzing, water slipping and sloshing between his eyes, because Tony is speaking and speaking and Steve is just staring.
Steve laughs and laughs, and then he's grabbing more, chasing at Tony's mouth with the popcorn as he lets out a squeak, toppling off the couch with a thud.
Hopefully this means he'll be back.
2.) Make him proud
Why bother. Everything is perfect.
Steve says nothing. Just holds his in his arms, warm and present and there and Tony just can't handle it. He's reaching, thumbs pressing into the holds of Steve's jaw before he can think about it, and then they’re kissing, and Tony's still crying, but it's different now. His mouth finds Steve and holds to him, searching for that good thing he always gives away. His fingers settle in his hair, cradling at the back of Steve's neck, till the angle is just right, and Tony is falling, sinking, drowning in this love. Steve's arms are wrapped around his waist, and Tony is so full, of him and here, this one beautiful moment.
And then the boy's laughing too, a lilting kind of thing, a chuckle that rings out like birdsong. And it's cold outside, a crisp autumn hum that seeps through the windows, but this thing between them is warm, filling up their bellies with coffee and sunshine.
He goes to sleep. Tony never answers the phone.
"The what?"
"I may..." Said Tony, stretching the silence as long as he could, "have told her we were dating."
“What are you looking for?”
The days are heavy. Summer is faded and broken and beat its last breath. But Tony falls asleep with a smile on his face, and Steve’s got one last sheet of loose leaf in his pocket.
"I'm sorry," he says, over and over, "I'm sorry."
“Xièxiè,” he says again to the man, “Wèile shuǐ. Xièxiè.”
“What’s this?”
The days melt on, dripping past each other, turning and sliding and sinking to the next, and nothing really seems to change.
And so it did.
There are moments, soft things, where the pit in his heart is quiet, but the ache in his chest is full force, living and breathing, a thing with fists that pull and tug. There are moments where they are nothing but boys, breathing in the silence of each others lungs, and Tony thinks, god, if only. There are moments that are words and heart, that sing songs to the broken in the space between his ribs, and Tony can't seem to figure out why that distance keeps pulling him closer when it hurts so bad to be far apart.
"It's fine."
“Are we getting off too?”
“Steven Grant-”
"What on earth did you do this time?" Says Steve, and he's already smiling, voice full of laughter, eyes soft as he waits for Tony to tell him all about it. Not for the first time, Tony regrets how infinitely he's fucked this whole thing up.
And Tony flips through the damn thing for what feels like an hour, careful eyes and steady hands, and then he stops.
Steve just laughs, plopping onto the sofa.
"Two miles is a lot of goddamn distance, I'll have you know. Much more than the human body was built for."
And then Steve's laughing, and barely panting at all, the asshole.
, the thinks, somewhere in the kitchen where the sky can barely reach them,
“Yes.”
There are moments where this love doesn’t burn. Where it fills him up from the inside. There is a steady flame in his chest, a flicker, and when Steve hands Tony the knife, their fingers touch, swift and lovely and warm. The is an ache in him, but it's quiet. There is a sigh in his heart, but right now it does nothing but beat.
"Have you ever known me to keep an empty bed," he leers, eyeing her over the rim of the cup as his stomach churns.
And it’s funny, the way the world melts sudden off her shoulders, the way it happens all at once, surprise to the way she’s smiling, laughing, a choke of something coming loose in her chest, and she’s beautiful.
And laughs.
"Make a wish," Tony says, soft in the coffee shop, Steve's heart tucked between careful fingers, "Make a wish. Any wish."
“Maybe I won’t.”
Moments grow longer, and the days grow colder, but Steve and Tony stay the same. They are the echo of maybe, a hurtling sigh, the steady hum of a near collision. They share secrets and silence, whispers in the dark, trading breaths from each other's lungs. They are two steps too close, and three steps too far, a shadow in the song of quiet. They are the infinite lilt of the way Steve does not kiss him, will not kiss him, aches to kiss him.
“This.”
And then Steve’s just laughing, hunched over his knees as he chokes on a breath, snickering by the curb as Tony bitches through it.
Tony, dripping and manic and desperate not to lose, steps back, slipping on the puddle at his feet, and catching hold of the sink. He turns on the tap, filling up his hands with fistfuls of water, and then he's flinging them at Steve's face.
Tony grins, something light, breathless, the kind of thing that slides away with the wind.
"Dating?"
Shakes, cracks, rattles at his teeth till he can’t seem to hold it, churning and chipping and eating at his grin.
He does.
“You want me to pick?”
Reason #32: He always ties the left shoe first
“I don’t want to save the world,” he says again, and it’s broken, shaking between his lips, a shiver of a thing that might have been an exhale.
'Make a wish.'
For every end, there is a beginning. You cannot open where you close. Every story starts with a wish, a hope, a prayer for the finish. Every moment has a heart that bleeds for the quit.
And maybe it’s for a yes. Maybe it’s the silence, or the darkness, or a lifetime of empty bellies, but he leans over. Bends and bows and buries his fist in the folds of his jacket, and then he’s off, desperate, lungs full of air that’s all borrowed and bleeding, breaths that weren’t his but he shakes them down anyways, all carbon and excess, and maybe that’s why he’s dizzy, maybe he’s shaking and sighing and leaning into Tony like he can taste the rush of him, and then he is.
The voice in his chest, the one that moans and spits at that pit inside him, shakes his head.
“You know what that means?” he smiles, and there’s no weight, no touch of a sigh that beats at its back, just lovely and bright and filled with promise.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Nurse Manson really liked the bus joke. I guess I didn’t need better material after all.
“I literally can’t read that.”
--------------------
"Can I, uh," Steve said, and his throat was dry, because there, standing behind the counter with a 20 dollar bill tucked neat between his fingers, was the prettiest boy he had ever seen.
Winter tumbles into spring, shaking the snow off the earth and spilling color into the sky. The ground softens, all wet earth, and Steve feels like he's blooming.
There is an ink press of something stretched across the page, dizzy churn of maybe letters, and Steve laughs.
“This would be so much simpler if you’d just learn to read,” Tony says simply, half through a fork full of fried rice, and Steve promptly chucks a wadded-up straw wrapper at him.
When Mrs. Carter comes downstairs, not a dish has been washed, but she doesn’t seem to mind. There, in the kitchen, stands two boys, shaking and wet, and more in love than she's ever seen.
He starts to write.
Tony just huffs a breath, slight slip of air that sinks through his teeth, and shoves the paper at Steve.
He says nothing at all.
"You idiot, that's the dumbest thing I've ever seen!"
And it's silly, but these sound an awful lot like pick-up lines, and his heart is fluttering, cruel churn of anxiety rising in his stomach.
Steve throws the cap at him.
"Can I take your order?"
"I love you," Steve whispers back, and he means it.
"Why are you sorry?" Steve says, and he's tired, he is, but Tony is shaking, anxious and angry and sad, and he remembers the way he felt after the ice, cold and brittle and furious, so he waits.
“Yeah, I’m not really sure how that worked.”
"Sleep. Now. Don't make me call Pepper," Steve says, and he's only slightly joking.
'This love is going to ruin you,' he thinks, and suddenly he's tired, heavy and drawn.
The way it rattles it his ears, Steve thinks the stars must be able to taste his pulse.
He watches as he plucks a straw from the jar, and barely has a moment to think how odd that was, before someone is standing in his place, hand full of change and asking, 'Large mocha, please?"
"Yes?"
Listens.
“You’re what?”
He tries folding them across the counter, but the boy looks at him funny, so he thinks he chose wrong. He lets them hang at his sides, odd and weirdly limp, and then the boy goes on talking.
And he’s still shaking, still sighing, but the rush of him is gentle, easy melt of mouths and teeth, and then Tony
----------------
“Just go get the flour, you ass.”
“I love you.”
“What about it?”
It started, as most things do, with a cup of coffee. A tall Americano, lifted to eyeline by a pretty woman in a red dress.
It's a Tuesday this time, and he's wearing a sweater, crisp and cool in the new September chill.
“Tony?”
“Her.”
“It just says, ‘first there is a mountain’.”
“You wanted to change the world.”
And then Steve’s smiling.
Tony gasps, drawing a hand to his chest dramatically, and Steve can’t help but snicker.
“No, it won’t Steve because we fucked up. His sister died because we were so worried about swim lessons that we waited and she drowned. Then we started comparing our ALIVE child to our dead one. We wouldn’t talk about her with him but we had no problem pointing out all the ways he wasn’t like her. We took away his sister, his individuality, and now we are taking away his freedom. We even took away the pictures with her in them! We have caused so much damage, and now we are taking away the thing that makes him happiest. Things are going to change starting now.”
"No promises!"
Natasha opens her mouth like she wants to say something else but Clint speaks up before she does, "Sure Pete, go help Bruce in his lab or something and we'll make lunch."
Tony thought about this for a moment. Honestly, he wanted to let Peter try out the suit two months ago. He had all the safety measures in place and he knew Peter was prepared to try it on for a few moments. Steve, acting like the mother Hen he is, was worried that something would malfunction and that Peter just wasn't ready. But since when does Tony listen to anyone when he truly thinks he is right?
"You're right Peter, we promised we would never leave without saying goodbye, I'm so sorry Pete."
Once they arrived however, it was an entirely different story.
"Well, he's not 20 but you guys are pretty close in age, he's 15. He is a genius just like me and as stubborn as Cap."
Steve looks up at his son and then gets up off the ground quickly. "Peter... um... your dad he... he's gone for a few days... maybe more... we aren't exactly sure." His Pops is clearly trying to sound ok but is not doing a very good job.
"Do you think we should have let her go? What if people are mean to her? What if she has a hard time swimming? What if..."
It was cold when he fell in, that's all Peter remembered. Really, really, cold. The cold did not last for long however because all of a sudden, he was in iron mans arms.
"I know what the therapist thinks! We don't have to listen to her! You rarely listen to your therapist!"
"I went to the store, and then when I came out it was hard to get home because Spider-Man was fighting some guy. Anyway, when I managed to get past that chaos I ran into Ned and I ended up going to his house for a while, then we fell asleep watching a movie and I woke up and realized I didn't call you guys and I'm so sorry."
"I know but I was ready to try one and I knew dad would have it under control. Besides, they technically aren't you're suits..." Peter mumbled the last part.
Peter watched as one of the aliens attacked his pops and his dad went to go save him, not realizing that three more were about to attack him.
"Daughter of Stark!" Thor booms, "Are you sure you wish to go to this Camp? Why not stay with us and swim here? Surely Stark has a pool you can use?" He continues, his voice loud but hopeful that Ellie will change her mind. Ellie laughs, "Uncle Thor, I'll play with you later! I have to go camp! Maybe I'll even learn to swim!"
Steve closed his mouth and took a deep breath, he nodded at his husband and remained silent the rest of the way home.
"Hey, Pops? Dad? Do you think today... today can we make cookies?"
"Baby it's ok, we made a mistake. We should have built up to being gone a whole week by being gone one day one week, two days the next week, and so on."
Tony, Natasha, Clint, Peter, Bruce and Thor (who were both just silently watching the whole thing) turned to look at Steve.
"Ugh, I know you're right Tony."
Peter hadn’t realized he was shaking until Harry walked over and hugged him, attempting to calm him down. “Peter it’ll be ok. I promise. You can stay here for now until you figure out what you’re doing. They don’t hate you, I don’t think they can even imagine hating you. I know you have separation anxiety but remember what we would do when you would start to panic during sleepovers?”
“Shut the fuck up Barton.”
"I know, it's just last year with all the bullies..."
"Dad, you can fix the suit and make it safer, you can track me wherever you go. I won't battle anyone after
"I said, Get, the fuck, out. Go. Both of you. Family doesn't lie, I know that after lying to Tony about Bucky. You lied about our son, A boy you claim is like a nephew to you. You knew for two months that if Spider-man ever got killed on a mission that we would not only be losing a team member, but our son. That is unforgivable. You are dismissed. Get your shit, get the fuck out of the tower, and go. Now."
Tony froze as he stopped himself from licking another spoon full of icing and giving Peter, who was sitting on his lap, his own spoon. "But babe you did a wonderful job making the icing, you can't expect me to stop devouring your wonderful creation..."
Harry frowned “It can’t be that bad. I told you when I crashed my dads car and when I ruined my moms tennis trophy.”
_____________________________________________
Lilly smiles at Eliana as she tells her she is going to do another flip, she claps like she has the last 6 times. After all, Eliana is her favorite girl. She reminds her of herself 8 years ago, when she was an energetic little 9 year old. But then she sees Eliana stop to talk to some of her friends who Lilly, unfortunately, does not know the name of. She begins to look nervous and she glances over at Lilly, who decides it's best to call all of the girls over and see what the fuss is about. "We all think Eliana should do the swim test in the big pool, but she won't do it because she is too scared!" One girl with blond pig tails says. Eliana turns to her, looking shy for the first time since Lilly met her. "It's just too deep," she says shyly "and I'm just not ready to do it. Even though I did swim across the little pool this is so much scarier. Do I have to do it?" Eliana says.
"Baby you didn't..." Steve tries to reach out to touch his husband.
Peter chuckles, then takes a deep breath.
"When?"
"Wade, they are my family! The idea of dating one of them is gross."
"PETER STARK-ROGERS YOU LOOK AT US NOW!" Steve yells, although his voice is clearly wavering.
"Dad, please don't threaten to buy the school and kick out anyone who messes with me again. You almost scared the few friends I have away."
"Steve, we said we could do this and we can do this, we only have to get through 3 more days."
"You guys always compare me to her, she's been gone for a long time and yet for some reason, I'm always compared to her! I can't win. But Spider-man... he's a hero. He keeps my dads safe and he is strong and brave and he's everything to me. Please..."
DIDN'T
“Eliana…” Steve starts but then cries harder. Tony finally finds the keys and yells “STEVE, GET UP! WE DON’T KNOW ANYTHING YET. LET'S GET TO THE DAMN CAR AND GO! Clint, Natasha, can you please just… just watch Peter?” Tony’s voice begins to waver like he is going to break down any second. Natasha hands Peter, who now has tears in his eyes after hearing his Daddy yell at his Papa, over to Clint and grabs the keys.
"NO PLEASE DON'T TELL THEM!"
"Is this about the fight you and dad had yesterday?" Peter can't help but let some anger deep through into his voice.
"Great idea honey bear, let's get the suits and go"
"You... you can't... you can't do that dad... you and pops... you... you.... you promised no... no leaving.... without.... bye."
“Peter, no 15 year old kid should be a hero. You’re not a hero. The only reason why I fought along side you was because I was worried you would make a mistake and get yourself hurt. You need to go home, go apologize to your dad and pops for running off and focus on your friends and school, this whole thing is just proving how childish you are and how you’re not ready to be a hero.”
"Hey dad?"
"I don't say this often, but I agree with Stark. Last time Peter picked he made us watch Clueless and I almost broke the TV" Natasha said as she and Pops walked in from the gym.
Peter nodded and jumped out the window, swinging towards Wade's apartment, still a little shocked by what just happened.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Lab lockdown mode has been initiated, no one is aloud to enter"
His family did not need to know that 1/4 of the time when he was "hanging with Ned" he patrolling as Spider-Man and the other half of the time he was hanging out with his much, much older patrol partner and hopefully future boyfriend. A certain mercenary that did not get along with his Father, pops, aunt or uncles. At this rate, he didn't know which thing his fathers would be most upset about, the lying, the sneaking around, Spider-Man, the crush on a 26-year-old man or that man being Deadpool.
"Ok, then we won't tell. But you have 4 months to tell them. If you don't tell them
--------------------------------------------
"Sorry sweetheart but no, you are stuck with us while your sister is away." Tony looks down at Peter and says "but maybe we can play with the robots today while your sister is gone?" Peter smiles and nods, but is still clearly upset about not being able to swim with his sister.
6) Try to go stay with...
"Pops, you're leaving?"
He pulled out the picture frame he took from his room that held two pictures in it. The first was of him, his dad, and his pops. They were all smiling and looking at each other, his dads were talking at some big event in Chicago and had allowed Peter to come on stage with them. The other picture was of his parents during a photo shoot right after they announced their engagement. His dad was kissing his pops on the cheek.
___(In Steve and Tony’s room)__
His parents track his phone.
Natasha couldn’t mask her feelings when it came to this picture. She tried to keep her face straight but the tears in her eyes showed her true feelings.
"And now you're dating."
Ned froze, not sure what to say next. "Um, um, he went to get pizza! He knew you guys were on a mission and he decided to go pick up dinner. He wanted to get some air for a bit, we've been in here for hours."
"Spider-Man, it's Tony. Cap needs your help. There is an emergency downtown. Get there as soon as possible."
Ned Froze as Tony Stark entered the room, now looking quite confused and concerned.
“We need to move forward”
"Exactly, so let's get Pete set up in a suit and ready to go!" Tony and Bruce checked to make sure everything was working properly, that Peter had all the pieces on correctly and that they were in the weapon testing room. Tony had a suit on as well in case he needed one to solve any problems.
Peter watched as the last few aliens were taken down by his family, and then froze, realizing what he just said.
"If I was going on a mission with that shield agent who kept flirting with me and buying me flowers, would you be happy?" Steve's eyes narrowed briefly at the thought of Mark, who after one too many attempts at flirting with his husband almost got thrown out a window, before shaking it off and sighing, pinching the bridge of his nose with his fingers. "You have a restraining order against that guy and you would never go on a mission with that ass. Not without me."
"Of course! Clint, I promise!"
"Hey Peter, after we kick this guys ass do you want to see a movie?"
Sorry for the wait but school started and swimming was crazy and I kept writing this chapter and then starting future chapters and basically, that is why it took me so long to update. I hope you like it, if you have any suggestions I would love to hear them, if you like the story please leave a comment and I promise I will try to update sooner rather than later.
"Steve, honey, relax. She is my kid, if she wants to swim then she will. If people are being mean to her, she will say something snarky back and they will back off. I would love to simply keep her in the tower forever but that will just piss her off." Tony said, trying hide that he has all the same concerns as his husband. "Now, let's go home and be overprotective of our other child."
"Exactly. So fine, go on your trip but don't act like I'm being unreasonable when we both know out of the two of us you are the possessive, jealous and unreasonable one. I'm going to my lab, I'll send Peter up to say goodbye and I'll see you in a week." Steve reached out to grab Tony's hand but he walked away and towards his lab. Steve sighed once again and waited for his son to come upstairs.
"I really freaked Peter out...
“I’m not so sure you would.”
He smiled at picked up his favorite girl, letting Rhodey take over the pancakes he was making.
After being bit by a spider 8 months ago (during a school trip right before Christmas break) and gaining his powers, Peter had finally started to feel like he had something about him that made him truly special, not just the male copy of his sister. Of course, his parents didn't know about this. They would lock him away forever and most likely try to figure out a way to get rid of his powers. He knew If either of his dad's understood it would be his dad, not his pops. His Dad, after all, thought spider man was an amazing hero and a joy to be around. His Pops felt that although they didn't know Spider man he seemed too young to be doing what he was doing. If only his Pops knew that it was, in fact, his 15-year-old son, he can't even imagine.
Well, that was what he would have told someone (read: Rhodey, Pepper, Nat, or any of his other close friends) if they had asked.
Without another thought, he strolled into the room with purposeful steps.
; why would the radio be playing the exact baseball game he watched with Bucky? And the way the room felt… it just seemed too perfect, too fake.
“Fury, you wanted something-”
It was comforting, in a way, as horrible as it may seem; even through everything, his little, special Tsum was there for him, sharing a piece of his Soulmate even though he never got to meet them.
“Okay, I get that we need to get the ‘Almighty Chalice of Wumbology’ or whatever, but what about-” Clint yelped when multiple pairs of arms tugged him back down, everyone - loudly - shushing him.
to stay with him for whatever reason) as witnesses? They never minded that their trainer was weak.
When a few seconds went by, Steve shifted, licking his lips again, his nerves starting to get the better of him.

Tony was lounging on the couch, looking gorgeous and soft with his fluffy, messy hair, his dressing shirt untucked with the sleeves rolled up and his adorable glasses framing his warm chocolate eyes, with his Alolan Raichu and Jarvis - currently occupying Tony’s phone - snuggled up with him, all watching a silly movie about something or another.
- so he’s pretty positive he’s making progress.
With his Tsum nuzzling his face, making small concerned squeaky sounds, Tony let a few tears fall.
At the end of the day, he was just thankful that they easily, if somewhat awkwardly at first, slid back into the close friendship they had. He was thankful all of them stayed, even if they didn’t have a reason to.
Tony softened, understanding him without words as he always did, and gave him one last smile before the faceplate fell and he took off. Steve stared after him for a second before getting his head back into gear. Later. They always had later.
Then Afghanistan happened, and his sexuality (or the lack there-of) crisis was the furthest thing from his mind.
Steve was confused by - but still completely loyal to - his Soulmate by age four.
As he walked into SHIELD HQ and down the halls of the floorplan he long since memorized, he felt… off.
Second best thing. The cuddling part was first, so definitely second.
For all that it seemed like everything was alright… something was very, very wrong.
He would remember seeing arrows fly with extreme prejudice, Hawkeye taking out aliens flying by at extreme speeds with ease.
Then a week after that, the two wonder spies appeared.
Steve silently cursed, gritting his teeth; now wasn’t the time to think about it, they
And, who only could be Steve Rogers - he’s seen the reels and comics and pictures; knows after the serum he was large and built like an Adonis - stared right back, Tony’s Tsum cuddled against his chest like ze was no bigger than his own Tsum, a million emotions flashing through brilliant blue eyes. Tony silently took in the rest of this Soulmate - and
Steve breathed a sigh of relief - he wasn’t ashamed to admit he was
He’d been in meetings with some of the Gym Leaders and fellow Elite Four members all day, and had just barely had time to pick up his gift from the daycare before flying back to Manhattan.
0o0o0o0o0
What was he doing? He honestly didn’t know anymore.
“Uh, hey, Cap,” Tony said, trying to put as much cheer as he could into the words as he stared at the coffee maker, all but mentally begging for it to work faster.
He would remember watching Captain America’s shield go flying, catching in the light as it knocked down several aliens in one blow.
Really, if it wasn’t for the explosions, blows would have been dealt. As it was, Tony found it easy to put aside the ‘talk’ while he and Cap ran for their gear.
-word’, “but I can promise that no matter what happens, we’re here for you, sir, always.” Helen trilled her agreement, wrapping her long tail around his legs.
After the war, he would find his Soulmate.
Falcon is down, Falcon is down, and being swarmed!” Clint’s yell was clearly heard over the explosions and sounds of heavy fighting. Steve felt his heart stop when Clint breathed out a soft and guilty curse. “He’s not getting back up… I think he’s gone, Cap.”
He was used to it - he had to be, what with his Tsum having the clear colors and design of Captain America, not to mention how unusually large his Tsum was, and the only option of not bringing his Tsum with him was absolutely off the table - but it seemed a lot of the staring was… with more
(He felt kind of ridiculous, to even consider going through with this, but at the same time…)
He felt something nudge against his cheek, letting out excited chirps. Oh, right; his Tsum.
- snuggled up against him, loudly purring and chirping.
He watched, completely lost, as his Tsum all but ran over to a man in a chair, all but clambering to get in his lap.
“Sir, there’s less than a three percent chance that he would not accept your affections. In fact, I believe should you not initiate copulation, the Captain would more than likely be inclined to do so.” Tony flushed, turning to glare at the clearly unrepentant Rotom. Next to him, Helen snickered, the Raichu also clearly unrepentant when Tony turned on her.
Within a month, they both accepted Tony’s casual (and cautious; Tony didn’t push as he didn’t want them to be uncomfortable, but he still slipped sometimes when he was tired) touches, and even initiated more than a few.
By the time he went to MIT, at the age of fourteen, Tony realized he just didn’t understand ‘sexual attraction’. At least, not in the way other people seemed to, well, ‘normalize’, or even ‘idealize’ it.
- and for all the pain and discomfort and haze he was under, it felt a lot different from being in Heat… At least any Heat he’s ever experienced.
“Tony… can we talk?”
“Since I made it, can I get that ‘more’ I was promised, now?” Tony spoke teasingly against his lips, and Steve drank in the depth of shining eyes and precious eyelashes as he stared down at him. Smiling, he leaned against his forehead, purposefully ignoring the groans of ‘Stevie, too much PDA’.
The other boys had given him strange looks, called him a bunch of names which Ana would wash his mouth with soap if she ever caught him saying them, and then completely ignored him when they went back to looking at the magazine.
Before his mind could completely spiral, the com crackled alive. “Cap-Steve… Hulk and Hawkeye are down,” Tony’s voice, drenched in pain and guilt, came through. For all that he was guilty for it, Steve felt immensely thankful; he wouldn’t have been able to carry on if Tony hadn’t made it, a thought that just hurt even thinking of it. “Then there were three, huh?” The joke fell flat, but neither he nor Thor were going to point it out to him.
It was honestly both a blessing and a curse he hasn’t met his Soulmate yet.
liked stupid and sappy things), and it was just all- so-
“I don’t know, what do you think?”
"Guess I owe you a dance." He smiled, listening to Peggy's wet laugh.
At least, that’s what he’s been told time and time again. (He knew he was, it was simply a fact.)
Steve didn’t pay the usual ensuing squabbles or the others any attention; there would be time to talk later when they went over the training exercise. Instead, he honed right in on Tony, briefly giving a smiling Thor a glance before stopping in front of Tony’s cot. The genius blinked, looking up at him, before giving him a tired smile.
“Remember what mobile games taught you; ramps give you extra points and a speed boost.” With that and a wink, Clint jumped down, followed by a giggling Jan, an amused Nat, and a resigned Hank and Bucky.
(Later, Steve and Tony would laugh when they showed each other their gifts, both spending time with their new Pokemon: Steve, a Flapple named Virgil with his Love Ball - and Tony blushed and stammered when Steve asked about that - and Tony, an Appletun named Plato in her Luxury Ball.
stern talking to.
Sitting on a pedestal, with the light filtering through the cracks in the walls to perfectly light it up and everything - weren’t they underground, though? - was the Chalice. Above it, Tony zoomed in on the faded ancient writing; Jarvis automatically translated it to ‘Temple of Zumba’, which, weird, considering what the Chalice was for, but whatever.
Even after Thor returned (who was almost even more tactile than Tony; apparently Asgardians didn’t put too much into personal space, which was a plus in Tony’s opinion) and Coulson was confirmed alive (which… that day still gave him whiplash when he remembered it) and the team was no longer ‘just a team’, Tony was still closer to Steve than any of the others.
“...Right. Clint, call Wanda to have Vision pilot the Quinjet come pick us up - and no, you can’t pilot the Quinjet, you’re still banned from almost crashing it into a tree because you forgot the fuel canisters, stop whining - and Bucky, Nat, and Hank, help me get Zemo out of there and in cuffs; Tony, you grab the Chalice, I can see you dying to get it, and Jan, try and find a way out of here that doesn’t require going back through the entire temple.”
0o0o0o0o0
But it had to be done.
Now that he was aware of it, actually, it would probably be even better if he smelled more like Steve. It made sense.
To prove his point: Tony stared pleadingly at him, eyes flicking to the box of sugary sweet fruit - including his beloved blueberries - in Steve’s hand, sitting back on his haunches, a tiny paw raised up like he wanted to reach for it but couldn’t.
All because his Tsum had the appearance of someone who died decades before he was born.
But in the dark of the night, when the lights were off and he only had his Cap Tsum -
But it still hurt, even thinking about them.
(Seemed like Bucky and the rest were right after all.)
“Tony, I… I wanted to apologize. For all that I said when we first met.” He tightened his grip on Tony’s hand, staring down at it as he talked, unable to look at him. “I know we got off to a rough start, and I said things that I regret ever saying, let alone thinking; you’re not your father, you’re not some bigoted jerk trying to play hero; Tony, you are a hero, and it’s been a blesing having gotten a chance to see you, the real you behind your masks. And I- I was wondering if you wanted to go on a date? With me?” He added cautiously, feeling his nerves come back.
Clint had taken over the vents by the end of that first week, and Nat had claimed one corner of the biggest couch on the commons floor.
!” He exclaimed in a burst, but like a balloon all the fight left him, leaving him deflated with his (many) insecurities. “...What if it doesn’t turn out okay? After what happened with Pepper, I… I don’t think I could do it all over again if he tells me he doesn’t lo-like me, if I’m not enough…” He muttered, feeling painfully vulnerable in that moment.
“You know it’s for your own good, and I rather you not get ill while you’re like this,” Steve said softly, gently petting Tony’s back. Tony tried to ignore him, but Steve just smiled with adoration and fondment when he begrudgingly snuggled closer against his palm, anyways.
“No distractions on the battlefield, Captain,” Tony said playfully, eyes full of affection that Steve undoubtedly knew matched his own. Unable to resist giving him another peck, Steve gave him his best smirk when he whined at not being given more.
Blessing, because then he wouldn’t be worried about them and be distracted from his mission - his
He barely noticed when Steve spared a moment from watching the guards’ patterns - they really were just awful - to give a fond glance over at him; he knew how much Steve was a sap, so he just leaned a bit closer into his husband’s space while still mostly paying attention to Sam.
And Tony, who had long since learned to never back down, gave him his best press smile and snarked right back.
“Just-Just
“...like what?”
Later, when Fury was shuffling through Agent’s cards, smeared with his blood (he knew those cards; Tony and Pepper had personally given him a few of the rarer ones for his collection) Tony felt… cold. Disconnected.
Tony will definitely be embarrassed when he got transformed back, but Steve promised himself to have JARVIS save and send every video and picture of Tony as a bunny to him.
- he would like to know what was going on, thanks. Not that he
“When this wears off, we’re going to have a long talk, mister.”
- and she was always right.
“Hawkeye? Hulk? Tony,
Tony blinked in surprise, but smirked right back, not that Steve could see through the helmet; even so he seemed to understand, anyways, judging by the warm glow in his eyes and the gentle squeeze of his arm. Retracting his helmet just for a second, Tony leaned over and gave his husband a quick peck on the lips.
The only plus side about any of this was the fact that Tony was getting the tactile affection he craved and deserved, all without having to verbally ask, which Steve knew was hard for him on a good day.
“Once more into the fray.”
Tony blinked, not really getting it, but it was probably okay, Steve saying angry words but he just sounded fond and he smelled warm and maybe a little sad? Which was not okay -
It was fine; he had his platypus whenever Rhodey came home; there was Happy, who was more than willing to indulge with a hug or two whenever Tony felt the need; and then there was Pepper.
And as the frozen waters came surging into view, his last thoughts were to his Soulmate, and how he desperately wished that things had never led to this, wished he could be forgiven for the life that would be taken with him.
“Well…”
Making another cup of coffee, perfect as far as Steve’s - weird; who drinks their coffee straight black? But Tony loved him anyways - taste went, he handed him the hot mug, picking up his own with a shrug. “Some things just get lost in translation, Brucey Bear.” Leaning against his husband, he took another sip, relishing in the sweetness of the perfect cup of coffee.
What’s more, is that once Steve seemed to have gotten over the whole ‘LGBTQIA+ Rights’ spiel, he was incredibly tactile, for whatever reason.
Steve sighed (which, history says that’s bad-) but then he just... smiled, amused and fond. It was a very warm smile; Tony especially liked that it was pointed at him.
More often than not, if he and Steve were sitting together during movie nights, they would eventually end up with Tony cuddling into Steve’s warm side (Super soldiers were like space heaters, and for someone with metal in them and got easily cold, it was an honest blessing) with his long fingers casually running through Tony’s hair.
“Great! Now all we gotta do is get to the temple…” Tony said, turning back to the temple itself; there weren’t that many guards and the team could easily take them out - they knew that the Masters of Evil weren’t even there yet, as they had gotten word they just sent the henchmen ahead of time - but more time spent fighting was less time getting the Chalice!
It was only later when DUM-E brought over his favorite wrench to cheer him up that he realized that he was… sad.
Shield strapped to one arm and a gun in hand of the other, he ran back to the bar where the team had set up a temporary base, taking out straggling zombies along the way. Overhead he saw Falcon and Iron Man fly by to support the others in the team who were struggling against the waves of zombies they were tasked to fight. Over the com, he could hear the harsh breathing and cursing of the others, the roar of the Hulk and Thor’s crackling thunder; he knew it was only a matter of time before-
His hand automatically went up to his Tsum, still red and gold, still as small as ever -
“Tony, no.”
….For all that it was the way things should be - should always have been - it still hurt.
- so he didn’t; not when Father yelled at him, not when he threw the bottle, not when he was sent sprawling on the ground and pushed away.
He hoped to meet them soon; they would have so much fun together, especially if his Soulmate really could fly, robot or not!
It took him another second to realize they were naked, but he could tell they have done nothing more than cuddle - he wasn’t sure whether he was disappointed or not - but that still explained nothing, and he definitely didn’t remember going to bed with a super soldier.
Tony could only blankly watch as he walked out, closing the door with a final ‘thud’.
“I know men who are worth ten of you.”
Jarvis didn’t say anything, but moved to lean against his arm. Helen, too, cuddled up against him, hugging his waist.
The entire time, he firmly yet carefully gripped a luxury ball in his hand.
In boarding school, he was once asked his thoughts on a ‘foxy girl’ in a magazine one of the boys had snuck in.
He just prayed he lived long enough to see them.
“I know where he’s going to hit.”
And after Obi-Obadiah’s betrayal, for the longest time as much as he wanted to just snuggle into his friends and loved ones arms, he could barely stand to be touched. (The first time he let Rhodey hug him longer than a few seconds, just relaxing at the touch, he felt unspeakably grateful.)
Not that he understood any of that.
Tony was fifteen and at MIT when he went to his first ‘college party’ - that had turned out to be a terrible idea - but met his first real, true friend.
want for it to keep happening; that was basically the worst possible thing that he could imagine.
Though he did wonder, as time went on, maybe someday…?
Besides, Mommy had said his Soulmate wasn’t bad, just gonna be extra special -
Because the thing was, he knew this was doomed to failure.
Tony had just had his 24th birthday, and he was dying. Alone.
The world dissolved, and Steve felt that familiar tug in the back of his mind. Not fighting it, he learned it was just easier if he didn’t, he blinked open his eyes that he didn’t remember closing to the smiling, tired faces of the others.
“You know, considering what our so called ‘arch-enemies’ are like, I’m not that surprised,” Tony mused, putting a hand to his chin and tilting his head.
Either way, Tony knew the peace couldn’t have lasted, and sucked in a breath before doing what he did best: diving in head first.
0o0o0o0o0
His Tsum let out a sad chirp as his tears matted zir fur.
), a little fluffy cottontail, cute
Tony all but squealed like a prepubescent teenager when he picked the all so important Chalice. Finally, he got it!
Everything of course was kept ‘chaste’; he never got quite comfortable for anything more, and Pepper was more than happy to respect that.
But this? This kiss wasn’t like any of them before; not even kissing Pepper had felt like this.
Tony smiled, feeling like more than a bit of an idiot at how misty his vision turned. He really didn’t know what he did to deserve them. (He never would.)
His voice, his smile, and…
Yup, just another day in the life of the Avengers.
With his mind now a tiny bit more clear with the skin to skin contact -
- or having to worry about them worrying about him in turn.
And of course, by the time Zemo was locked in cuffs and out cold over Bucky’s shoulder, Jan - using her powers to sneak in the small cracks and crevices - had found a secret, ancient passageway - yet again with lit torches; Tony was almost 99% positive it was magic somehow by this point - that led straight out of the temple to a nearby cliffside that had the absolutely gorgeous view of the sunset over the jungle.
The Rotom, of course, just leveled him a very unimpressed look.
He breathed a sigh of relief when he made it to the conference room JARVIS told him via his earpiece where Fury and ‘his important guest’ were waiting for him. He opened the door, looking down to make sure his Tsum could fit through.
He… He wasn’t sure he could do this (he was definitely sure this would end in nothing but heartbreak) but, with his Pokemon at his side, encouraging him? Maybe he could give it a try. At least one more time.
, but Steve just loved this man.
That is, until said long-lost hero started talking him down.
In his pocket, his phone buzzed in that specific way Tony knew wasn’t from a text or alert. Too distracted in his swirling thoughts, he absently took it out. “Yeah, J?”
just a tiny bit nervous.
He absently petted Helen’s head when she butted against his leg at the end of another circuit with a concerned noise.
When they finally broke apart for air, Steve leaned down, his forehead resting against Tony’s, not being able to pull apart farther than that. (He was sure his heart would have just given up if they were any further apart.)
If he very obviously lied to himself, well… only his Tsum and the ‘bots knew that.
When she tried to act faux innocent, like she wasn’t telling him lies, he knew something was horribly
longed
Thing is, he’s been kissed many times in his life; he never could go further, but kisses he can do.
And it both warmed Steve’s heart and made him ache for him with how obviously happy and content Tony was. (Not to say he didn’t get hugged or anything when in human form from the others; just not nearly to this degree.)
Because what does that even mean?-
- but despite that… it was still turning out to be an alright day for once.
But the important part was that they were safe. He had the will already updated - Pepper was CEO and had full control of Stark Industries, and Rhodey got a specialized suit just for him, along with many of his assets including JARVIS and the ‘bots - and they would be fine without him; no need to mourn someone who shouldn’t be alive, anyways.
Things were awkward between them, at first; though they seemed to have moved past what happened in the helicarrier, most lingering feelings left behind, it was pretty obvious even to Tony that neither of them were very good at ‘talking’.
Taking a sip, Tony sighed; the coffee was just the right boldness, and with the perfect amount of lactose-free cream and sugar. Which, of course, meant it would give a normal, weak human a heart attack; at least in Tony’s opinion.
Frowning, he tried to ignore the prickling feeling he got from all the staring and continued on. His Tsum must have sensed his discomfort, as ze stuck closer by his side then usual.
He let out his breath, feeling some of the weight in his chest lift, just a little bit.
His and Pepper’s relationship became increasingly strained (all of his relationships became strained; later he would wonder what made Rhodey and Happy forgive him), and when the palladium poisoning set in…
Tony said she looked really healthy, but maybe a bit too skinny? Should eat more; Ana always said that while being fit was nice, being too thin could be dangerous to one’s health. (She always tried to get him to eat more whenever he came home, slipping him extra slices of cake.)
Even if Tony’s heart felt like it was always breaking now, it was still better. He had to believe that.
But meeting James Rhodes -
Well, he had all the time in the world to figure it out, with the best sort of crazy family and wonderful friends at his side.
or running back to his workshop to hide under a blanket with DUM-E and the other Pory’s, and wait to try again tomorrow. (And he knew himself he would just end up making excuses for tomorrow.)
Which, Tony wouldn’t have minded all that much - he loved how he could just snuggle against zir during cold nights - but it would have been pretty hard to bring zir with him if ze grew any larger. He wondered why ze stopped growing all of a sudden, though...
“Come back alright and you might get more,” he said with matching affection, warm and a bit hungry, but with all the seriousness Captain America had; Tony
Everyone in the tower - and even those who only stopped by for a visit, like the Guardians and X-Men - had held or petted Tony, cooing over him, at least once since he transformed some days prior.
Tony blinked blearily up at him, because that made no sense, ever, but then one of those magical hands was sliding up his back, which, yes, more please, but then it was
Except Tony was snuggled right into Steve’s side, Appletun and Flappled cuddled in their laps.)
(His heart began to sink; this was an awful idea, he knew it from the get-go.)
- he leaned back as much as he could to look up at Steve’s -
“-NO POP-TARTS IN THE JUNGLE? THE AUDACITY-” Thor roared, followed by Clint’s manly screams, loud laughter, and the sound of the living room - yet again - getting trashed.
Except about a month after Tony’s revelation, it found Tony all but cornered in the common floor kitchen with Steve blocking the doorway with a weirdly determined yet nervous expression, the others in the game room down the hall. They were alone.
He froze for a second, but in the next he had his arms wrapped tight around Tony, trying to pull his closer.
“...Hi,” Tony breathed after a beat, staring up at him. Steve felt his heart skip a beat at how vulnerable the smaller man seemed.
how he wanted his feelings to come out.
(...Maybe Bucky, Sam and the others were right.)
When he ran out of the building, not paying attention to where he was going, his Tsum still secure in his palms, he skid to a stop as he took in the tall buildings surrounding him; the lights, the people, the vehicles.
Understood he was… missing something, and it drove him to distraction trying to figure out what.
He was snapped out of his thoughts when a little wet nose pressed against his hand.
Things settled for the most part, and Tony had finally gotten the arc reactor running for the the building that would soon become the HQ for Stark Industries. For the first time in years he felt comfortable in his own skin (the nightmares and panic attacks and constant anxiety thrumming under the surface never went away, but he didn’t expect it to) and content with the way things were going for the most part.
His Tsum chirped, grabbing his attention; he couldn’t help but smile when he saw zir gently nuzzling Happy’s Tsum, impressioned in a red all-business dress, who was so small in comparison despite being average size. Ze, thankfully, seemed to have slowed down in growth; ze was still the size of a dog -
He had made peace with that fact a long while ago; he couldn’t turn back time, and there was no point in worrying about it.
And apparently Captain America was still alive, so... that was cool.
“...Right.” Turning for the last time, he glanced one more time at his antique grandfather clock, actually reading the time, (he still had a long time to go…) before turning to the living room to sit on the couch to wait.
But that wasn’t how the cards were dealt, and Tony was soon hugging Rhodey goodbye the day he graduated and ran off to join the army -
Tony grinned, that manic look returning; Steve started to look a bit more concerned, as he should be.
It didn’t matter; they were friends, best friends at that, and that was enough.
He knew that the Team was unhappy about all of this for whatever reason, frowning at him and Cap whenever they were in the same room, but he refused to say anything about it.
He didn’t cry when he sat in the bathroom, cuddling his distressed Tsum close, as Jarvis gently wrapped a bandage around his arm. He didn’t cry when he learned that Father would be gone on yet another trip to the arctic to search for the body of Captain America, and Mama would be flying out west, leaving him alone.
Which was good, seeing as they were about to be surrounded on all sides.
It was… awkward, at best.
Why should they, when he failed at something simple and basic like his Soulmate?
If (when) Steve got someone amazing to cuddle with, laugh with, spend time with, then it was better to cut things now than deal with the heartbreak later.
For a moment, before the darkness completely took him, he wondered if he finally found his Soulmate.
“Take off the suit, what are you?”
“Yeah, but that’s all science, not
Over the coms, Tony and Thor still fought on, though Steve knew they weren’t going to last much longer; he could tell that Thor was wounded, and Tony was only a baseline human, not made to stand against this constant assault. When they both reached their limits… Steve refused to think about that, heart constricting even imagining the outcome.
0o0o0o0o0
Tony would forever deny that he cried a bit when he was told that. (Told that he wasn’t broken, even if it wasn’t true.) But he would never deny that his honeybear gave the best hugs.
Especially the cuddling part. And the petting part. Also the bed was pretty nice, even though it smelled more like Alpha then him, which, since the Alpha was Steve, was honestly the best thing ever.
- as he found himself caught in those oh so pretty eyes.
Tsums don’t act like that with other people except their own humans. And the Soulmates they matched.
-he was pretty sure this was what Heaven must be like: snuggled in the softest bed, cuddled against an extra warm super soldier, hands gently petting him.
Rushing through the doors, he barely acknowledged some of the others hanging about the common floor (mainly those that are single or just haven’t gone out… which was most of the others) before stepping right into the elevator. He deliberately ignored the knowing stares he could feel on him as the doors closed.
...Or he would actually die a horrible, painful death, because Steve stilled
As soon as Zemo picked up the Chalice, a massive rock came out of nowhere and fell right on top of him; there wasn’t even a rumble or anything.
Steve looked down at him, smiling with some sort of warmth that might or might not have caused Tony’s heart to skip a beat, fingers flexing where they were curled around broad shoulders and a strong back that went on for days. Which was ridiculous, he was just seeing things again -
When he came back (broken, he came back shattered and his heart was cut out and the water kept getting on the battery and he was being electrocuted dyingpleasemakeitstop-) less than he was but still a bit wiser for it, Yinsen’s words echoing through his mind, he would never be the same.
It was easy to say that within a few weeks, Tony had come to appreciate his time with his science bro, and that for all that Bruce rarely initiated touch, Tony was more than happy that he seemed fine and more than a bit amused to his hugs and casual touches.
Then before Tony could even begin to comprehend that, there were soft lips against his.
Did he have his bad days? Yes, all the time, but now he could manage them better; at least, he was told he was by the important ones in his life and mental health doctors -
Shaking off the thought, he let go as Tony touched down in the middle of the overturned bar room. Before Tony could fly off again, Steve gently grabbed his wrist, turning his coms to mute, and pulling him into a hard yet gentle kiss, pouring all of his worries and love into it. And as always, Tony froze as if surprised before melting into it, kissing back sweetly enough that made Steve absently wish they weren’t in the middle of an apocalyptic war-zone, pulling back reluctantly and feeling warmth bloom in his chest at his flushed, smiling face.
Tony, at the age of three and two-thirds, fully learned and realized that he was the one in several billion to not have a Soulmate. Or, at least, a Soulmate that was still alive.
Not just as a bunny - though JARVIS had mentioned that small animals tended to do better with human contact and affection - but Tony loved being touched, no matter where and in what form; something Steve was more than willing to give since he loved cuddling Tony as much as Tony loved being cuddled. But here, as a small bunny that just snuggled happily into your arms whenever he was picked up and held?
“Hey handsome, need a lift?” Holstering his gun, he easily wrapped his free arm around the armor’s shoulders just as another wave turned down the ends of the street. Having an arm wrapped around the armor, feeling the hard metal against him as proof of Tony still being alive and mostly well, relaxed some of the worry and anxiety he had felt building in the back of his mind. “All the time, Shellhead.”
And Tony laughs too, a rough sort of thing, chapped at the edges and nipping at his teeth.
"No? How about 'Soup of the day: mocha.'"
'You are nothing but everything,' sits in the back of his throat.
The server looks startled, pausing with their glasses, and he repeats the greeting.
Reason #218: Eight cups of coffee a day seems like a perfectly reasonable amount of coffee to Tony Stark
Steve just laughs.
Steve Rogers is confused about a lot of things.
The sheet bites at his knuckles, catches at his fingertips when he pushes it away, and the fury is suddenly drowning, biting and kicking at a current of grief, lonely and bitter and aching for breath.
“The first item on your bucket list was to say hi in Chinese?”
And he's there, standing in the doorway, all ink drop hair and watery smiles, and all Steve can think is that a year and a half is quite enough waiting for him.
Steve blinks.
And Steve does, he really does, but it shakes that water in his lungs to hear Tony say it, so he tightens his hold on the mug in front of him and just says,
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Have you heard all of the buses are stopping today?”
“Seemed sick as fuck when I was making it.”
Steve is not the wondering sort. He is first thoughts and quick motions, the stretch of a fist and the ache of his jaw, no pace and all thunder. The kind of hurried action that bites at your thumbs in comic book pages, but he doesn’t say a word. Just tilts his breath towards the brush of night and searches for a star.
"I don't know what I'd do if I lost you."
"Can’t you get it yourself?"
“Tony-”
This time, when Clint shushes them, they just smile.
'If I'm gentle enough,' he thinks, 'maybe I won't break what's left of him.'
“Why is this on your bucket list anyway? You don’t cook.”
Steve laughs, a heavy kind of thing, digging a bottle of whiteout from his pocket with a click, and Tony moans.
He comes back into the coffee shop after close, late on a Friday.
And Tony smiles. And Steve, beating back a grin, pulls out forty-two sheets of loose-leaf from his jacket pocket.
"Nu-uh, give it here," Steve says, tugging the mug out of Tony's hands. Warm coffee bubbles over the sides, dripping down the ceramic, and Steve grimaces.
It's Steve and Tony, soft and warm, backs to the sun and baking in the heat. The air conditioner is on, but warm wind blows steady over the nape of their necks, drifting through the door as people filter in and out of Café au Lait.
“Number six.”
“We’re perfecting the chocolate chip cookie.”
Reason #491: Tony and Clint make a dangerous pair
"Come here,"
They seem to fall into each other, as summer melts to autumn, ridges and bones catching dry on each other throats. The pieces of Steve seem to settle into cracks, fit to mold beside Tony's rib, and it's simple, easy as breathing. There is empty air next to Steve that belongs to Tony. A heartbeat that thumps by his own. There is a rib he doesn't remember sitting next to his heart, and he swears Tony must have left it there.
And then Tony is spluttering, stutter of breath that catches in his cheeks till Steve starts to laugh, and then he’s shoving at him, all elbows and sharp things till he’s laughing too. The bus rolls by while they’re catching their breaths, and when the doors hiss open, cold air chews at their ankles.
Reason # 120: He is, all things considered, pretty decent in the kitchen
The boy stared at him across the counter, fingers tightening their hold on the bill before he shook his head, blinking quick and saying,
(Please)
"There's nothing to fix," he says, and then Tony's crying, shaking, fists curling around empty air before they find Steve.
"Thanks for being here," Steve says instead, hushed in the darkness.
Tony smiles. And Steve goes back to cooking.
"Don’t be."
Steve says it again.
Tony laughs.
"Are you going to hit me? Because I probably deserve it, but I at least want to be prepared."
“My point,” he says, a little breathless at the way the light stretches over Tony’s jaw, “Is that you liked these things for approximately a month, and then got tired of them.”
"Speak for yourself," Tony huffed, still smiling, "Certified genius over here."
“For god’s sake, Steve Rogers, tell me a tattoo is not sexy and we can go home.”
"No, we can... we can roll with it. The team would buy it, I'm sure. Pepper already believes you, and-"
“What is it?” he says, when the silence has washed the warmth from his belly, when the stars have melted in the middle to brush away the heat of day, when he thinks he can stare and stare and not quite touch.
It's the kind of dizzy that only happens at the tip of the sky, a thousand feet above the grass, two boys with nothing between them but the stretch of darkness.
And then they eat their dim sum, and snicker at the chalkboard, and when they go to leave, Tony’s fortune says, ‘Time is a game.’
"Steve," says Tony, and the smile is sliding off his face, the longer he stands in the quiet.
Tony snickers.
----------------------------
“Didn’t you make me get my license so we didn’t have to take the bus?”
"I'll just tell her the truth. It was a dumb lie, really, it's not like we could have pulled it off or anything-"
Tony tell him to make a wish, and Steve wants to say,
“First there is no mountain, then there is no mountain. Then there is.”
“Yeah? What’s it say?”
They're jogging, two warm bodies in motion beside each other, and Tony's breath is drawn, coming out sharp. He huffs behind Steve, who laughs, sticky sheen of sweat just barely breaking out across his forehead, and fuck that guy.
“Are you saying I should have kept the bowl cut?”
----------------------
Steve just closes his eyes, a shadow press of darkness, and when he opens them, Tony’s smiling.
He just blinks, eyes wide, dripping onto the linoleum for a moment, and then he's smiling, wicked and dirty, pulling it out of Steve's hands and drenching him.
Not at Tony. Not at God. Just hot brimmed fury, melting in scorn, dripping and pooling with the ache in his jaw, boiling and battered where his cheek meets his scowl.
“Sometimes… sometimes I wonder what it would be like to be different, you know?”
"All I wanted to say, Tony, is that I'm worried about you. God knows I never thought I'd try and convince you to go out and meet people, but goodness, aren't you lonely?"
“Probably the old Camaro you parked in my driveway while you yelled at me.”
Tug and reach and fill, sliding into space like Steve is caverns to fill, and he just says, “What makes you think I would have said no?”
Tony’s smile doesn’t shake, but he leans back in his seat, lets his eyes brush closed against his cheeks like old friends. He shakes his head, nudge of his jaw where he presses into the vinyl, lines of his throat impossibly long, and Steve can’t drown it, can’t puddle away the urge to touch, so he tucks his fingers under his thighs.
Reason #7: He is remarkably stubborn
He should.
Steve smiles too.
“What do you want?” Steve asks, two steps behind, and the door falls open with a hiss, sigh of the bell from somewhere above them.
He just sits in the silence of Tony Starks kitchen, and tries not to want things so much.
Tony just smiles, lazy, spreading across his face like butter, till he opens his eyes. They catch on Steve's with a tug that feels like friction, and his hands come to rest on Tony's ankles.
Reason #38: He sings in the shower
“I’m sick,” he just says, and it’s funny, how sudden his heart forgets how to beat.
When Steve sees it he just laughs, full bellied and loud, and Tony mocks insult.
"Well, boning. Bumping uglies, if you will. The dating I think was more implied."
Tony doesn’t glance at him, just rolls his eyes through the back on the bus and lands on a woman with a Kroger bag in her lap.
Tony sneaks a glance at him, hands under the tap as the water washes over his thumbs, and settles in the divots of the glass he's holding.
'You make me think I deserve something good.'
“Why is getting a tattoo on your bucket list?”
And the look on Tony's face fills his belly with stars. He doesn't know who moves first, pushing past chairs and clearing the countertop, but before he can blink Tony's spilling into his space, bright and good and soft. There is a moment of silence, and then Tony is laughing, choking back a sob as he presses his thumbs to his neck, into the hollow at the end of his jaw. Steve is all hands and motion, letting out a sigh as he pressed forward, leaning into Tony till they're breathing the same air. They stay like that, drawing in the hush of the others lungs, until Tony stops crying, and then Steve kisses him.
'I love you.'
This is not one of those moments.
“We’re gonna change the world.”
"I- sorry?"
When he closes that night, the tip jar is brimming, stuffed to the cusp with pennies and dimes and bills, big bills, and when Steve manages to catch all the change from spilling onto the tile, out falls a piece of paper.
“I mean, what is number one.”
Steve blinks.
'Make a wish.'
“The joke wasn’t on the list?”
It’s a month before the sun stops dripping down their back, and it’s another month before they finish the bucket list. Clean white walls and hospital brand Clorox are the recipe for homeliness, and St. Marshalls room 303 marks the end of a revolution.
'Aren't you going to take my order?' He says, quiet, smiling, a stretch of lips that is all too thin to be Tony.
Reason #6: He's beautiful
Tony smiles like he heard it anyway.
“I guess forty-two items in a month was a little ambitious.”
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steve, in the quiet of the night, will think of the way it feels to dream about falling. That jerk to consciousness, the moment between awake and down, down, down. He always thinks about Tony like that. Like he's falling right into him.
He's still crying, but it’s soft now, and his hands slide down to his wrists and still between his fingers, holding tight.
“Give me the marker.”
“You dragged me out to southside to catch the bus so you could cross something off your bucket list?”
“You never told me what this is.”
“We’re here for a tattoo.”
“I didn’t
Tony throws his hands up, all mock surrender and sugar smiles, and then he flips the pantry open, dragging out the flour and baking soda.
Because-
Reason #184: Sometimes, in the light of the morning, his eyes drift shut, lashes caught against tan skin, fingers tracing the rim of the coffee cup, and you'll think to yourself how tired he must be
Steve does not find that funny.
And Tony’s laughing too, something giddy, rough in his jaw, shaking past his teeth with a hum that startles, low in his chest, bubble of something that melts off his tongue.
And the pages grow.
Steve swats him with his apron.
There is Tony, and there is Steve, and then there are all the things they don't say.
He gets a kick out of it.
'I wanna kiss you a latte.'
'bum bum.'
“So how are we crossing off number six?”
"Sure," he says.
-------------------------------------
Just in case.
Steve is grabbing, fisting hands in shirts and hair, checking for bruises, missing bits and bobs. Tony spreads his arms for him, lets his hands run over his sides, quick and frantic. Fingers grab, pull, tugging at his chest, heavy and hard and desperate.
Wayside shrinks in the heat of the day, heavy wash of summer that scrapes at their shoes, sticking in their throats till they’re chewing through august. Summer hisses off the pavement, biting at their heels and clawing up the curb. The sun in low in the sky, and for some reason, Steve Rogers is at the bus station.
Tony Stark walked into Steve Rogers' coffee shop at nine a.m. on a Saturday morning.
“Tony? What is it?”
"Sure, that's," Tony swallows, throat dry, "Boyfriends, yeah? God, I feel like I'm back in middle school."
"I'm sorry-"
The 'since we broke up' is quiet, fluttering behind her words, a whisper of all the things she'd never let them talk about. It sits in the silence between them, an ache, a cavern of something desperate to be filled, and maybe that's why he does it.
1.) Save the world
'Dear god, do I love you.'
And Steve should speak, he should, but the words have claws, catching sharp in his throat, fingers like knives and torches that meld his teeth together with a click.
Steve's throat is doing the thing again, brimming and closing, and he doesn't know what to do with his hands suddenly.
“It’s a bucket list.”
"Make a wish," Tony says, hours or minutes later, when their breath has run ragged and their cheeks had gone pink.
Tony tugs at his sleeve, feverish and hurried and yanking, puling at cotton with heavy fists, struggling at polyester with fingers that shake.
Solid.
Okay. Things change a little.
'The second he leaves,' it whispers, 'I'm here. I'm always here.'
