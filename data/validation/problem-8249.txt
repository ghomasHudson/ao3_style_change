“What’s up?” He asked her. She made a face before looking up at him. Her father, the one she was mourning earlier, the one person who was
“Obadiah Stone.” He hated to say his name. Everytime, it reminded him of what happened to Jarvis and what would happen to Rhodey and Pepper if he ever found out about what Tony was doing. The Captain raised an eyebrow. “See why I wanted to do this in person?” Tony asked.
Tony stayed behind Steve as they went up the stairs.
“Hello, my name is Morgan and I may or may not require your help.” She replied.
“Tony, Tony I need you to listen to me. Breath. Slowly. This is the last thing we need right now. What's wrong? What happened?” Tony looked up and met Rhodey's eyes. Steve had never seen Tony look so small. It made Steve want to kill whoever or whatever made him feel this bad.
“Who was that?” Pepper asked. He was so screwed. How could he explain this. Oh he was so screwed. “Was that Rhodey?” She asked. He could’ve cried.
“Guys! I’m sorry I missed it! But, why is Tony back with Obadiah Stane? I thought he didn’t know he was here.” She asked. Steve and the others went white.
“Morgan!” She exclaimed. “Where are you now? Are you with anyone?” She asked. Morgan nodded.
“Tony? Is everything alright?” Obie asked from the living room. Tony made his way out and leaned on the doorway, his eyes fixated on the floor.
considering he had waited so long in between taking pills. He almost considered not taking the pills, but took them anyway, and laid back down on the bed. He took JARVIS out of his ear and stared at him. He tilted his head to the left, and noticed something that he hadn’t noticed before. When he held it at a certain angle it created a familiar symbol. Though he couldn’t place it. The symbol was only visible at a specific angle, and no one would know. Hell, Tony didn’t even know, and he was the one who built it. It was then that he placed it. He quickly pulled the S.I. cloth out of his shoe, and held them up together. They matched.
“All right, so then you just add that to your answer and there you go!” Tony said.
“Yes, ma’am?” He said.
“There was an explosion -...a-a fire.” She said. Tony covered his mouth in horror, he knew it showed on his face. There was really only one thing on his mind.
The finale was Tony’s favorite part. All the colors and shapes booming together showing such a beautiful display of everything. Tony loved it. It was chaos afterwards though. everyone trying to leave all at once. It was amidst that chaos Tony realized that he had dropped his cloth, and tugged on Steve’s arm.
“I got everyone. Are you ready?” He asked. She nodded.
“That is so you Tony. Alright, alright. I’ll come by in a week. You have a week! And we can go to lunch and you can show me what is so big.” She said. Tony could tell she was smiling. Which made him smile. She was finally relaxing. She probably hadn’t relaxed in a few years. It made him feel good that she was going to be safe soon. She kept him grounded and alive for all those years, there was no way he was going to let her die. He was doing this for her. For them. “Well alright that’s a-”
Tony left a pair of clothes under a rock where he knew Clint would look. He stayed true to his word and met with Clint and Bruce every night after everyone else was asleep, and he was having a great time. Tony and Steve were touring the town and looking for jobs for Tony. He was fascinated by all the jobs around and how different they all were. There were so many different  jobs and so many more then the ones the merpeople had. Steve was very patient and  explained everything to Tony.  Steve really liked Tony as well. He loved the way Tony’s head cocked to the side when he was confused and the way his face lit up when he saw something he liked. Steve wanted that smile to last forever, and he wanted to be the one that kept it there.
“I didn’t say anything.”
“Obie? It’s Tony.” Tony hated to call him that. It was like acid in his mouth.
“If you’re sure. Because, I’m serious I can find another place. It wouldn’t be so hard.” Tony said. Steve placed a hand on his shoulder.
Tony sat up in the small pull out bed. He wasn’t used to how dark it was, usually he would have something glowing in the corner to see by. He sighed.
“Do we have a deal?” The Captain asked, standing and holding out his hand to Tony. He sharply inhaled and took his hand and shook it. “I have a feeling this will work out well.” Tony nodded. This was his life now, wasn’t it? The girl picked up the phone.
lost these two, I knew, I was five and I knew they weren’t coming back.”
“That’s a lie.” She said. Slowly, she placed a hand on his shoulder. He flinched, but didn’t pull away. She pressed his head against her shoulder, rubbing his arm. He had never been touched this way before, and he honestly liked it. He liked it a lot. By the time Steve came downstairs, the two hadn’t moved; Tony still hadn’t cried, even though Natasha’s statement made him feel like it was okay. Steve had rushed down stairs and breathed a sigh of relief upon finding the two.
"What?" Tony ask. She waved him off.
“Good news is that they found the killer. You are now officially safe from them. They are in police custody and under high surveillance. They can’t get you. You can now quit high school and come back home with Rhodey and me. If you want. You are completely safe now. Okay?” She said. Tony beamed.
“No one will hurt him. I know he can fight his own battles they won't make him fight them alone.” Steve said it rubbing Tony's arms. Pepper and Rhodey hadn't seen Tony smile so bright since his father said he didn't do terrible in college. She was happy that he took part in making him smile like that.
“That sounds sort of familiar?” Natasha muttered.
She couldn’t have known.
“Who is this man?” He asked.
“Stay where you are Pepper. I’ll come pick you up. We are going to by his house.” Rhodey told her. She nodded although she knew he could not see her.
“Who did this?” He asked. Tony saw the fire in his eyes and smiled sadly. Steve cared so much, the entire group did. He basically broke. He placed his head in Steve's chest and cried. Not like a very sad cry, more of a happy cry. He was so happy these people cared about him so much. Steve pet his hair and shushed him. “It's alright.” He said. Tony smiled and pulled away. He was smiling.
“For you sir, always.” The A.I replied.
“Yeah it is.” She replied. “We
“That’s because they left, my boy.” Obie said, somberly, and pointed at the line of cars. Tony recognized the car as the same model as Steve’s, and although the windows were tinted, he could see a tall, blonde man in the front seat. Tony gasped. They...They had left him. Steve was gone. The man whom he thought cared for him. He was betrayed. Obie never betrayed him. Obie cared.
“Try me.” Steve said.
“Pepper?” He asked, seeing her standing there biting her nails. She only did that when she was very nervous or concerned. It put Tony even more on edge.
“Alright, kiddo. What do you want this year?” Steve asked. She smiled shyly and looked down. It was funny how fast her mood could change.
**Bonus Chapter**
“3000?” Pepper asked. Morgan gave her a lopsided smile.
Of course the press went crazy over Anthony Stark being found. But Tony didn’t care, he had a family, not just by blood. He had his new family of friends now, too.
“Steve?” Tony said, relief and confusion mixing together with the slightest bit of hurt to fill his voice.
“I don’t care shut up.” Steve said and crashed their mouths together. It was rough, desperate. Steve couldn’t hold back anymore. He needed to
“No,” He said, his voice cracking. “I want to go home.” He said, tears filling his eyes. But he didn't want to cry. Not in front of people. Real men didn’t cry, he reminded himself.
JARVIS?” Steve asked. “Like from scratch? You built an A.I system by yourself?” Tony looked at his confused expression, which matched everyone else’s in the room.
“Of course we are going to need to background check you, but if everything checks out, we’ll do it.” The girl hadn’t moved from The Captain’s side since she arrived. Her face showed no emotions and Tony envied her ability to do that.
Obadiah all but ran into his building, and frantically pressed the button for his floor. Tony couldn’t have escaped, he just couldn’t have. He would need at least one other person to lead him around; there was just no way. When the doors opened and the room was empty, Obadiah felt himself start to panic. Then, he saw the chair and cables, and his panic turned into rage. Tony was gone, and someone was with him. He punched the wall of the elevator in his fury, hard enough that he felt something moved beneath his fist. A panel of the wall shifted to the side, Obadiah looked over in confusion and moved the panel aside to find a leather bag. He looked inside to find the tower’s plans, a camera and a sketchbook. He opened the book, and on the inside cover it read ‘
“Okay. You're creepy. I just closed my door.” Tony said picking up his phone.”
“What are you doing?” Clint asked. She looked up at him, confused for a second.
“What day is it today?”
“I’m a teenage girl.” She replied. They all nodded.
“Pay for 4?”
Tony was most definitely not okay. He trusted these people with his life, sure. He had gotta very close to them, all of them. He even had the privilege to call Natasha; Nat. Not even Bucky could do that. It was nice to be part of a makeshift family. He enjoyed it. But this was something else. As he was suiting up in the tight leather outfit he was given. It was a little tighter than necessary but that was because it was the only one they could get on such short notice. He had his gauntlets on, it was only a button press away, but he was freaking out. How on earth was he supposed to do this.
“Hey, so good news bad news and more bad news.” She heard Peter say. She paused and just started off into the wall. Great. That was just great, more issues and she hadn’t heard from her brother in the weeks leading up to the time travel incident and
“Yes, we can probably track it.” Rhodey replied with a small smile.
“Tony?! Oh God! I am so glad you are all right!” She yelled.
“We love you Morgan.” Pepper said. Morgan softened and smile.
“I dropped something. I’ll be right back!” Tony said. Steve nodded and stopped the group.
Tony had just finished the prototype Obie asked him to work on when the elevator dinged. He smiled knowing that if he finished, Obie would be happy, and it would be the perfect time to ask to see the fireworks. Obie walked in with a smile on his face.
“Indeed, the costs will be high.” The large blonde agreed.
“Aye, Nice to have you with us, Anthony.” Thor boomed. Tony took a breath and nodded.
“Wait right here, now?” Bucky asked. Tony nodded.
Tony sat in his room and cried for the 18th time in the past week. He had been gone a week. He probably broke Steve’s heart, he not only lied but left him. He was the worst living being alive. He loathed himself. Clint came into the room.
Tony hesitated. He thought for sure Obie would hit him or drag him away. But... maybe that was in the past. Tony was an adult now, he could do this. He looked back towards the group, and made his decision.
“Bucky is right.” Bruce said, also standing up. “If we want to get good seats, or seats at all, we should go soon.”
It was getting late and Tony hadn’t slept well the few nights before. He yawned and rubbed his eyes like a child. It was the first time Steve had notice the dark circles under his eyes.
“You liked me?” Natasha asked.
“Yeah.” Steve replied. Tony giggled it was like music to Steve’s ears. So soft and beautiful. Steve kissed him again. Softer this time, gentle, as if he was afraid to break Tony. Such a contrast to what had just happened. Heat was gone but an amazing warmth came with this kiss. Passionate and slow, traditional.
“You’ve never eaten pizza before?” He asked. Tony shook his head.
“You know us in the future?” Natasha asked.
“I would never leave you… I-I love you.” Steve said. Tony looked at him through watery eyes.
“Is something wrong?” Steve asked. Tony shook his head.
“Hello Harold.” Steve said looking over.
“Tony Stark blush might I be so bold as to say you have a crush?” She asked. Morgan knew damn well what she was doing. Push them in the right direction. He’d get it.
“No one you know.” Tony whispered. They were really close now. When did that happen?
“Yes, so there is a way to get more Pym Particles which is good but it’s bad because Hank has been trying to keep his Particles out of the reach of a Stark which is what you are.” Peter said.
“Obie! I'm coming in.” Tony called and opened the doors leading into his office.
“You missed my birthday this year! It was two months ago!” She complained. He laughed again, with more heart this time.
18. But almost 18 wasn’t 18.
“That is Thor, Clint and Natasha.” Bruce said pointing to one side of the table. “Thor and Clint are on the football team.” Tony nodded taking in all the information. “That's Bucky and Steve. Bucky is the co-captain of the football team and Steve is the Captain.” Bucky had a metal arm and Steve was insanely hot. “There is an empty seat next to Steve, you can sit there.” Tony Kirsten his head. Why did he have to be sat next to the hot one, that was just unfair. First he is trying to stay alive by going to high school and now he has to sit next to the hot guy. Steve, Bucky and Clint were all in a heated discussion of which college had the best football team, when Tony heard something that caught his attention. Rhodey's school.
“Hey Pep. What’s up?”
“Well, the suit she took only contained enough Pym Particles for her to get there and not back. Which was why it wasn’t used.” Hank said.
“JARVIS, you up?” He asked, quietly. Steve had gone back to the others, and they were now talking quietly among themselves now.
“Ah, Tony. What brings you here.” Obie asked. Jarvis closed the doors behind them. Tony sat down and Jarvis stood behind him. Tony explained what had been on his mind for a few weeks. About, how he was ready to assume control of Stark Industries. It took 30 minutes and Obie’s smile disappeared. Tony got a sinking feeling, but stood his ground. Obie stood up silently and walked over behind Tony and Jarvis who turned around to face him.
“he also tells me how they are on a winning streak right now. He brags about it all the time. Then I asked him about his classes and then I have to help him with his homework.” Tony said.
She spent about two hours cleaning everything and then another two hours playing with the tools and learning how they worked. It was 8 o'clock at night before she actually started working on the van. She worked on the thing in back first, fixing what she could, because she couldn't really understand it. She managed to fix and replace all the broken glass and replaced the wires that were frayed or fried and rewired those that needed it. She fixed a few metal bars that had broke. She stepped back and wiped sweat from her forehead and smiled as, at least that part, seemed brand new. She wasn't sure that it would even work because she wasn't sure if she was doing it right. It didn't stop her though. Morgan's phone buzzed and it scared her. DUM-E, who was very happy she was back, helpfully handed it to her. It was her alarm.
“Shut up!” Tony shouted. He hated it when people yelled, and this man was being way too loud for Tony’s liking. The man went quiet. “Thank you.” He muttered. Tony stepped back into the light holding the wrench firmly with both his hands as he approached the intruder.
“July 3rd.” He replied. Huh. Close to Steve’s birthday then. She’d have to give him something. Something nice. Her brain came to life with ideas and smiled. She’d have to ask Tony for some materials but she could do it. It would be worth it.
“I could tutor you if you want.” Tony said with a shrug. Steve's face lit up.
“But that’s nearly impossible.
“And I know you.” Steve replied. Bucky still stood behind Morgan but almost protectively.
“A thank you.” He said. She tilted her head to the side.
“I see what you mean Tony.” He said. “But, I worked too hard to give it all to you.” He sighed. Tony cocked his head.
“He is fine, I think it was him who called the cops, he definitely called Rhodey and I. We're both outside your house now.” She said.
“What do you mean?”  Tony asked. He wasn't about to reveal anything, he didn't know what Bucky knew.
“I love you too, and I will always remember you.” She said. “I’ll talk you later, okay?”
“But what if they don’t believe me?” Tony asked.
“Well, I’m not sure, but Tony seemed to be the one to figure it out last I heard… when I was five.” She said.
“Yes, it’ll be fine.” Steve said. “If you want I could sit with you in the back. I'm sure Clint already stole my seat, so it’s no issue.”
“Come on. You’re doing it.” Steve said and pulled Tony over.
“I thought we got rid of that fantasy years ago, boy.” Obie spat at him. His gaze made Tony feel like the garbage he was constantly reminded that he was.
“Stone? He is super high profile!” Barton said. “Why would we risk that?”
“I found her.” JARVIS replied.
“No I knew that it was just- She finished that in the car ride over here.” Happy said. He was starting to panic just a little bit. The group all stood up.
“No.” She said. “Because I know a few things about the people here that you don’t.” A silence. “Also you’ve admitted that I am smarter than you and agreed to mentor me when I need it while Tony is gone.” That earned a small laugh from some of the group before she went with Tony to her room.
“Tony.” Bruce warned. “Are you sure this is a good idea? Remember what happened to last Merperson who got too close to a ship?”
“That message, was recorded in case he died and he did but in wasn’t vain neither was hers.” She said. Morgan took a breath and wiped her face. She turned to the Avengers. “It hurts. Being here, seeing them,
“Hello brid-brian.” Tony said trying not to let his voice crack. It failed.
Tony walked into school on monday with Steve on his left holding his hand tightly and the rest of his friends around him. They all laughed at a joke Bucky had made. Tony had finally given Bucky the arm he made and everything else he had made for his friends. He even introduced everyone to DUM-E it was really nice. Tony snuggled up to Steve during their free in the corner of the warm library. It took a bit of convincing and a faking the symptoms of another heart attack before Tony was able to convince Howard to let him stay in high school just until his friends graduated.
“Yes, now if you don’t want the Colonel or that assistant girl to share his fate, i suggest you let me stay in control.” Obie hissed into his ear. Tony thought of Pepper and Rhodey with a bullet in their heads. He shuddered. Then nodded dumbly. Tony got up slowly and walked to the door. “And don’t even think about telling anyone about this. I have all your phones bugged and guards following your ‘friends.’ so don’t even think about warning them.” Obie smiled as Tony opened the door. “Don’t be a stranger.” He called after Tony.
“No! It's actually kind of cute.” He said. Tony blushed. Steve looked down. “I mean my brother's in charge but what is he going to do? Fire me from being a prince?” Tony laughed.
“Bruce!” Tony yelled and slapped his arm.
“I am, and I really really like him.”
Tony walked to the doors of Obadiah’s office. He didn’t want to go in there. But he had to, he’d do it and everything would be alright. Besides, Tony wouldn’t be the one to kill him it would be Steve. Whom Tony loved above all things. After Pepper and Rhodey left, the  two continued their ‘conversation’ and we're now officially dating. Although no one but Bucky (who had walked in while they were kissing) knew. And it took a lot of threats from Steve and blushing from Tony, to convince him not to tell anyone. Tony knocked on the door.
that?” Clint asked the other guys.
“I don’t know. I’m not done with it yet.” She snarked back. Tony snorted.
“I don’t know. It’s just I feel it. They way he smiles and his face lights up, it’s wonderful Bucky, I swear it.” Steve said. Bucky could see in his eyes that Steve loved this man and his face softened.
“W-well I don’t do it that-that often. I just-just wanted to g-get the prototypes done for today so I could ask-ask if I cou-could go to the fire-fireworks.” Tony stuttered. Steve realized that they probably made him uncomfortable. He nodded at Tony’s reply and dropped the matter. He would take it for now. Steve stood up and stretched.
“Because it’s not that kind of power.” She replied. “I need something called a Pym Particle.”
Tony hesiated, he didn't want to be much more of a problem. After all, he was already blackmailing these people into taking him to the fireworks show, the least he could do was try not to be too much of a problem. But in the end, he nodded. Steve climbed into the car, and Tony was right behind him. He helped Tony buckle up and they started off. Tony did not let go of Steve’s arm the entire half hour ride. Steve found he didn’t mind.
“Protect that kid with your life.” He said in a stern tone. Pepper came into frame as well.
“We have no clue what you did.” He said. She smile.
“Hello, don’t mind me or anything. I’m just here to pick up Morgan” He said.
“He’s always away doing something for our dad or something. He’s never home anyway. But yes, I miss him.” He replied. Steve smiled and saw Bucky smile ever so slightly.
Tony’s face lit up when he saw a coffee pot, he would do something nice for these people. They didn't even know him, and they pretty much accepted him without much background. Of course, there was the looming threat of arresting their friend hanging over them all, but he hoped this would be more of a peace offering. It wasn’t much, but it was all he could do without feeling too intrusive. He could make the world's best coffee, and it had nothing to do with the fact that it was all he ever made. Nope it did not. Not. At. All.
“Tony was in a relationship with this guy, Ty, and he didn't actually like Tony, just using him. It was an abusive relationship. You almost gave Tony a heart attack on more than one occasion. Tony finally stood up to him and left him. They got a restraining order after he wouldn't leave Tony alone. And apparently he's back.” Rhodey said. Tony shrugged.
“Future decision stuff. Space and all.” She muttered. “It’s not a big deal they shouldn’t be calling while I’m in the past.” Tony nodded.
“We were really worried about you, you know.” She said refilling the water glass. “The only reason why Steve isn’t here right now is because he hasn’t left the room in awhile it took both Bucky and Thor to get him out after I agreed to stay behind so he could eat.” Nat said. Tony groaned.
“What’s wrong?” Bruce asked.
“You sound like my brother.” Tony said and ran off down the hallway to find Steve. He was so close, all he had to do is tell Steve he felt the same. That’s all he had to do. “Steve!” Tony called. Steve’s face lit up and turned towards Tony.
Bucky is Steve older brother.
“Like?” One of the men asked.
“Just like your father.” She said. “You know, he went college a fifteen and he made me promise when your were born that we wouldn’t let skip any grades.” Morgan plopped back down and huffed. Pepper smoothed back her daughters hair and kissed her forehead.
"Who built the original?" Bruce asked.
“What do you mean? I don’t- have a crush!” He squealed.
“Like yours.” She replied with a bright smile. “Now I have a few friends with me and they just want to help you too. One or two you may recognize from your past. If you don’t want to meet them, that’s okay but I can’t help you without them.” He hesitated as she cloaked her hand again.
“Hey.” Someone said. Steve wasn’t sure who. She didn’t seem surprised to see them. Her body tensed for a second, like she was expecting them to be there
“Anthony! You are a prince and your kingdom was attack! It is your duty to protect it, we are going! NOW!” Clint yelled and pulled Tony away.
“You once asked me why I was never upset over Civil War.” She said.
“Scott.” Bruce answered.
“So our future selves are really protective over you.” Clint muttered.
“Can’t sleep?” Natasha asked a second time.
One that would be very awkward if she stayed in her current position. She frowned. ‘That’s my dad.’ Morgan mouthed before running up the stairs. She didn’t stop until she got to her room. That was that.
“Yeah, that was his favorite bedtime story, how he met you guys.” She said smiling up at Steve. Steve held a faint smile and took a breath before continuing.
“It might’ve went off course… a bit.” Steve replied. Tony snorted behind him.
“Now you’re going to think I’m insane, but I promise you I’m not.” She said. “I’m from the future.” He gave her a look. She snorted. “I know, I sound insane but listen to me, in the future you’re my uncle.” He gave her another look. “I know what Hydra did to you and you have every right to run from me but I swear on my life and on my family's graves, I want to help you.” He moved his hand away from the gun.
“Not even Clint.” Morgan finished. Natasha pulled back and gave her a smile.
“Thank you. Very nice of you to let me stay here.” She said.
He was staring straight at Tony. Tony felt his blood run cold with fear, and Obie started walking towards him. Tony couldn’t remember how to move. Obie marched right up to him and stood there with a disappointed look on. Somehow, that scared Tony more than his angry face.
“Guys, no, I broke into his home, literally. You guys would do the same if someone broke into our house.” Steve defended. Tony smiled faintly behind Steve. “And you guys would call the police, which Tony did not do. He hid our stuff and asked me to take him to see the fireworks tomorrow night. And if I do that, he’ll give me back our stuff, and he won’t press charges.” They all looked at Tony. He did
“Jan said they were going to a private beach near Miami.” Pepper said before grabbing a piece of paper and wrote down the information. “Here’s the address.”  Steve grabbed it and nodded.
“Come in Tony!” Obadiah said, sounding as happy as always. Tony opened the door and sat down. As soon as the door closed Obadiah’s smile faded. Tony was wear a tiny mic that no one could see but everything Obadiah said could be hear. “What the hell do you want, you useless piece of-”
Turns out he came to see if Tony actually survived. But it turned into Howard criticizing Tony about how he should’ve been more careful and get better grades and should focus on his grades and not on friends or any other outside projects. Tony did not like his friends being called names like that and stood up for them. Telling him that they were good people. Howard retorted with they are stupid people. Tony yelled that they weren’t and that Howard was wrong. And all hell broke loose. Howard ended up punching Tony dead in the eye knocking him back and making him land on his wrist wrong. Then proceeded to break his wine glass over Tony's head then the entire bottle on his neck. He stormed out without another word. Tony lied there cradling his wrist for a good ten minutes before he got the sense to call Pepper. She showed up a few minutes later to Tony sitting outside on his doorstep, looking pale. He got in.
I'm thinking about doing a sequel if enough of you are interested
“Yeah, I asked him to help me. You’re really going to love this.” Tony said, adding a light tone to his voice.
“2013 and I already proved that I am, in fact, from the future.” She said. Rhodey nodded. “How are you guys doing with the van?” She asked.
“I came to sign over Stark Industries.” Tony interrupted. He smiled and stood up.
“Platypus?” Clint asked.
“How did you ever manage to fix all of this? The glass is shattered and the wires are all out of place!” Bruce exclaimed from off screen. Past Bruce perked up at hearing his voice. A faint smile that few (Morgan and Tony) caught.
Tony has to go to highschool and highschool isn't good.
“Miss left about 3 this morning. She got into a taxi cab and seemed to have paid with her own cash considering that she didn’t take any of yours.” He replied.
“As long as you don’t blow anything up it should be good.” He said. She nodded.
“Are you hungry?” Steve asked, jumping in to save Tony.
“Really? I thought I was a Mackerel!” She yelled at him.
“She’ll have to do it, but there isn’t a grantee and even so. She’ll try again and eventually get it. We just figured we should tell everyone. It’d be best one of you tell her.” The group nodded before looking at one another. It’d be hard. Morgan knew what day it was. They
Morgan didn’t expect to be this long. The ride, of course, was long, and even the driver was reluctant to drive her all the way out here alone. But say soon as he saw the amount of cash she was willing to pay him, he just drove. It was super early but she didn’t want to worry the Avengers too much. Maybe she’d be able to get there and back without them knowing. But sadly by the time the driver stopped, it was almost 5 in the morning. She knew Steve got up anywhere between five and six thirty for his run and wouldn’t be back until at least seven. Then everyone else would be up. If she drove back
“Okay.” Steve said. “Natasha and Bucky, you two will be on the ground to intercept. Thor and Clint I want you two in high positions. Tony help civilians out of the fire, if it comes to that. Everyone got it?” It was a chorus of ‘yes Captain’. Tony didn't miss how, when he turned around Steve was watching him. Tony blushed and looked down. Bucky snickered. Steve hit him in back of the head, which in turn made Tony blush even more. This was not going to work. He could not focus like this.
“We didn’t. Alright, I’ll have to contact the future but I
he reminded himself, and walked off to take his medicine. He needed that medicine like he needed air; He couldn’t live without it, his heart would most likely stop if he did. Tony looked at himself in the mirror. That blow would most likely leave a bruise but, nothing too bad.
“Trust me. Plus it’s better to do these types of things in person. Don’t you think?”
“Hello?” She said into the phone.
“Why do I sound different?” He asked. Morgan waved him off but in actuality was panicking.
“Yeah, I know. All the avengers did.” She said.
“Why?” Tony couldn’t think of any reason why The Captain would want him.
“I had no clue if you were going to say yes. I know you are cautious which is a good idea considering what happened to you but oh god I was afraid you’d say no and we’d have to convince you. I’d never want you to go back to Hydra.” She said, in what seemed to be within one breath. She sat up and looked at him again. “Could my friends come over?” He nodded. She stood up and motioned towards them to come over. She saw Bucky tense as he watched five more people come closer. “It’s okay.” She said. “They’re only here to help you.” Bucky stood up as well. He looked at Steve and frowned.
“We were hope, the kids in that period were signs that good can be achieved here, in this time. We rose from the ashes-” she snorted. “Literally.” She muttered. “No one that generation was more than five when it was fixed and a new generation started. Something bad happened. Something worse than New york. Beyond it.” She paused, letting it sink in. “I’m not telling you what happened. I can’t, but from the ashes of that destruction came my generation. The ones born in the heat of the moment and saw people come back who we thought were lost. But when
“Of course we still like you!” Natasha exclaimed, indignant. “Why wouldn’t we?”
He was surprised that no one was up yet, but he assumed that they never got a day off
“You have to meet everyone. They are really excited to meet you.” Bruce said, as he literally dragged Tony to where the table was. “Everyone meet Tony! Tony this is everyone.”
He stared at the coffee maker as if it would make the coffee brew faster if he kept staring it down. Natasha and Bruce had their tea and Clint waited in line for the coffee. Tony didn’t miss the way Steve’s eyes lingered on him. It was probably just him checking to make sure Tony was okay but he couldn’t help but blush at his gaze. It was slight and he made sure to just drink his coffee to hide it. Come on, Steve was literally the peak of human perfection. There was no way to not appreciate him. There was something missing though, something nagging at the back of his head.
“Uh, good? I guess.” He said into the phone.
“Morgan,” He said. “I can’t handle losing another Stark.”
“Because!” She exclaimed. “You should know what you did!” She accused. He laughed again.
“That’s great so I can come home, or is that part of the bad news?” She asked. Tony perked up and smiled at her.
“You guys are jerks.” Tony said. “Getting use to walking will take a little bit of time, Clint. You won’t get it right away.” Clint nodded.
“It’s isn’t all that complex. Besides, I built JARVIS and-”
“Why?” He asked. She huffed and hit the couch in mock anger.
“Clint owes me 20 bucks.” Natasha said.
“He’s on a romantic vacation with Hope... and Cassie.” Steve said off screen. Past Steve cocked his head to the side and Tony scrunched up his nose.
“You said earlier you don’t want to go back, don't you miss your brother?” Steve asked. Tony shrugged again.
The group waited anxiously for the elevator to stop moving. The doors opened and they all rushed out and collectively stopped in awe. The van, the portal to the quantum realm had been repainted and restored but it was broken… not like before but like it was used and wasn't ready.
“I kicked your desk by accident. I’m sorry.” He muttered keeping his gaze low. The blood stain from where Jarvis was killed was still on the floor. Tony wanted to throw up but he stood strong.
“But we just-” Bruce started.
“Rogue? What do you mean rogue?” Natasha asked.
“I finished. I hacked Hydra.” She said simply. Steve’s jaw dropped.
Pepper looked at the small device curiously. She had no idea what it was or what it could do. She then looked up at Steve.
one. Everyone, save for Pepper who said she’d met them there, piled into two different cars. Tony, however stood on the sidewalk just looking at them with not even a hint of emotion on his face. Steve noticed, and got out of his car and walked up to Tony.
“Why do you even want him dead?” The British girl asked.
“I guess that her point.” Natasha replied. They walked forwards into the woods, they were walking aimlessly considering that they had no clue where to go. They stumbled upon a place where the trees grew thinner and they saw her. On a rock next to a calm lake. Her hand, the mechanical one obviously, was displaying a message, a person, talking. They looked familiar, a man. They were too far away to see who it was and too far away to hear. Even Steve couldn’t hear it. But as they got closer Steve could hear a bit the last few words of the message.
“I- I’m sorry I should’ve asked it’s just- ah I’m sorry I shouldn’t-” Tony cut off Steve’s adorable babbling with another kiss. It was Steve’s turn to make a surprise noise. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck and Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist.
Scott wiped his forehead and stepped back. That was it, they were done. They had finished the portal. They even did a small test run. It work. They could get Morgan back. He looked at Hope who smiled and nodded towards the portal.
not telling Pepper.” Steve nodded and crossed his arms, waiting for Bruce. Giving him the Captain America ‘I’m waiting for the truth’ look. “She going to try and change the past.” Bruce said. Steve froze. She was what? Change that past? Could she do that? What would she do? What if she kills herself that way? She’ll cease to exist. Morgan would be gone and for what?
“I love you, little sis.” He said. She laughed.
“Is that okay?” Steve asked, he was afraid she might be horrified in him. Having her ‘Uncle’ be in love with her father. Morgan smiled faintly.
_______
“Yes, but there are people so close. Whenever I was alone at the tower, people were never close by. I don’t know, this just feels different.” Tony replied with a shrug.
“Whoa, whoa.
“She still could have said goodbye.” Natasha muttered into her tea.
“Sir, your heart rate is elevated, I suggest you calm down.” Tony nodded dumbly.
High school sucked. Of course it sucked and Tony was glad he skipped it. Well, almost skipped it. As a child Tony was smart enough to skip the entirety of it. But now someone was after him. his family had been so careful as to keep him out of the media but now that was over and someone was trying to kill Tony. The worst part was no one had any idea who it could be. It was actually his mother's idea to send him back to high school. ‘maybe he could learn to be more social was her logic. What she didn't understand was the new kid never had friends, but her mind was made up. No one but his parents Rhodey and Pepper we're allowed to know his location. Rhodey swore on his life to protect Tony and Pepper promise to make sure he actually went to school every morning Tony packed his things and moved into a small suburban house his parents had bought him to live in for the time being. That was one of the only things he could consider a good thing about this whole situation. he wouldn't have to see how it every day of his life. Howard 100% completely sucked and Tony was happy to leave him behind.
Morgan sat on the couch and started to drink her hot chocolate. She wasn’t sleeping and remembered that time with Natasha. She missed her Natasha so much. Her eyes filled with tears knowing that she wasn’t going to see her again either way. If she went back without changing the past she knew that Natasha wouldn’t be there and if she
Steve watched the tower. Obadiah Stane’s main building. Steve knew that this man had secrets just waiting to be discovered, though he had no clue what. Obadiah was a terrible and cruel man, and Steve was just the guy to expose the truth to the world. He waited for Obadiah to leave, before stalking over to the building. Getting up to the penthouse wouldn’t be the hard part, the hard part would be getting past the security desk in the lobby. Today, however, he was going to get into that office, even if it was the last thing he did. He plastered a smile on his face, and held his camera firmly in his hand. He had his plan, and it was going to work. Steve walked in and stood at the receptionist’s desk.
“I wasn’t.” She replied.
“Excuse me but your buddy, Tony, over there built a robot when he was 17. We child geniuses can do a lot.” She said. Tony’s jaw dropped.
“Oh!” She said. “Sorry.”
Pepper almost threw her phone onto the floor. She growled in frustration.
“Who are you?” She asked. Her tone holding a hint of offence. Tony didn’t say anything, he
“I love you too.” She replied and hung up. Noting wanting to stay in her new room and her normal room being occupied she went to the common room while everyone else was sleeping.
too many places he couldn’t see. Blind spots. Blind spots were dangerous. But when Natasha sat behind him, her back up against his, Clint on his side, switching between talking to Natasha and Tony, Steve in front of him, and Sam and Bucky arguing on his other side, he felt a kind of safety that he had never felt before. A kind of warmth inside of him that was totally new. It had an addicting feeling, and Tony never wanted to leave it. But, he had to pee. He hadn’t realized that they had been talking for so long, and it was almost dark.
Five minutes after he called, a girl showed up that looks like she could silence Natasha with how mad she looked. She walked straight over to Tony and her expression immediately changed. Softened. She gave him a smile and rubbed his arms.
“What?” Clint asked. Natasha shook her head.
“You restored a time machine at age 15. I’m sorry but I’m not buying it.” Steve said. Morgan huffed and look indignant.
Tony’s life was assumed to be perfect, but it was anything but. He had abusive parents and his sanctuary was only with his butler Jarvis and his uncle Obie. He only had two friends, Rhodey who stuck with all through college and Pepper, his assistant who was the only who could handle him. His father was rich out of his mind and instead of doing something good with his money, he continued to use for his own personal gain. Then it happened. The crash. A car crash that killed both of his parents. They might’ve been terrible parents but they were still his parents. It took a few years to get over it but by the time he did get over it Obie was doing a great job at the company. But it was Tony’s and he would make his parents proud for once by improving the company.
“Why?”
Tony’s earliest memory was of the fireworks. He loved the colors; well the ones he could see. It wasn’t easy for him to see them much from his tower. They looked so amazing, and he couldn’t get them out of his mind. Once, he’d even asked if Obie would take him to see them next time they went off, but it ended up with Tony being backhanded, and his room moved so he couldn’t see them again. Ever. He could still faintly hear them, not that he had been able hear them that well from his old room, but he heard them enough to figure out that they went off every year, right on his birthday. Tony wanted more than anything to see them in person. And now, he was going to turn 18, so maybe Obie would let him go this time. Obie wasn’t his real father, that much he knew. But Obie took him in when no one else did, his weak heart didn’t make it easy for him to handle. At least, that’s what Obie said. People weren’t nice and would eat him alive if he ever went outside, so maybe if Obie would take him to see the fireworks, he could be safe. That’s all he wanted, to see the fireworks once - just once - was all he asked.
“What’s wrong with her?” Hope asked. “Did she blow herself up again?” Bucky chuckled humorlessly.
“Be careful.”
“What does that mean?” Scott asked Bucky, slightly afraid.
“If you ever need me kid, I’ll be there. I promise.” Natasha said. “If I care for you in the future there must be a good reason.” Morgan laughed and smiled but nodded. They pulled away and Morgan wiped her face. “Come on kid, I’ll tuck you in.” She teased but they both knew that she would.
“Oi! What about us?” Bucky yelled. Steve smiled and Morgan chuckled.
"Not important." She said, running a hand through her hair. "It’s hard for me to believe that I am in 2013.” Tony and Bruce looked at each other then at her. Tony raised an eyebrow.
“Steve is in love with you and I want to get your intentions straight.” Bucky said, normally the tone of his voice would’ve scared Tony, but he was too happy to be afraid. His face was infected with smile in an instant.
“Please just be safe!” Bruce said. Tony gave him an earnest smile and nodded. Tony made his way up the ship and held to the railing. Then his grip slipped and thought he was going to fall. Only Tony could mess this up.
“So what are you building there?” He asked. She shrugged.
“Excuse me but-” Before she could finish, Steve jumped over the desk and ran towards the stairs. The elevator could, and probably would, be stopped if Steve tried to go in there, but there was no way they could stop the stairs from going up. The group stopped the security guards from getting to him.
“Assemble your friends. I need them all, plus some.” She said.
Tony was good at being quiet. He remembered when he was little and Obie was around more often, Obie would get drunk and angry. To make sure he wouldn’t get hit, Tony often had to be quiet when moving around and working. That was just how people were, right? Tony made his way into the kitchen and looked around. He loved the way this house was set up; it was almost like what college dorms looked like in the movies. A shared common room and kitchen, with hallways leading down to different bedrooms. It was nice, and had such a cozy feel to it. Unlike the tower, which was never full and always had a cold feeling.
“It’s not that simple. I spent years upon years trying to keep that out of
____________
“Depends ma’am.” JARVIS said.
“Okay, so bad news?” Tony asked. They looked more concerned now.
“I’m assuming Steve is still out?” She asked.
“Tony? Oh damn it!” A voice said. Tony turned not dropping the wrench or moving it away from the girl. It was Steve. Tony couldn’t find his voice, instead he gestured with the wrench towards the girl.
“Yes.”
“I’m getting older, Tony, you need speak up.” He demanded.
“Why are we in space? Why not Thor?” Tony asked. She laughed.
“Don’t worry, we won’t give anyone the chance to catch up.” Steve replied.
"It's not, I live there whenever my mom and I want to have a holiday together." She said.
“She’s going to what?!” Steve exclaimed louder this time. Bruce kinda froze as everyone else started to pay attention. He thanked every deity that ever existed that Pepper wasn’t in the room.
“No problem and come back safe, okay?” He asked.
“Correction, he’s awake. But we need to get him medical attention. And fast.” Steve said. He lowered his voice. “Tony, I need you stay awake.” He muttered as he scooped Tony’s small form, into his arms. Careful not to make him bleed more.
“So what exactly happened on Friday?” Steve asked as Tony sat down at their lunch table. Tony side of the small smile didn't want to lie to them, but if, on the off-chance they knew who was trying to kill Tony, he couldn't risk it. Pepper had a gun over the cover story was. Pepper and his parents both decided that it would be better for Tony to stay and throw the killer off maybe he'd think Tony was moved somewhere and not come back and try again.
It took him a little while, but he made it to the 49th floor and smiled to himself. He walked out of the stairwell and onto the floor where he pressed the button for the elevator. The 50th floor would be the easiest to get to from the elevator. He got on and smirked, this would be a piece of cake, he was in the clear and now, all he had to do was get into the office and take pictures of everything. Obadiah Stane would be out of business for good and Steve would be a hero. He thought about the way everyone would look at him, see him as a hero, and his business would be put on the map as the best artist gallery in the state, maybe even the country! He and his friends would be set for life. Steve was distracted by his fantasies and never saw the wrench coming, until it connected with the back of his head.
“Good, just wait he’ll be there.” She said before hanging up. She turned to him and nodded and the two left towards the living room. The group gave them a questioning look. Tony shrugged and sat down on the couch with Natasha and Steve. Morgan barely held back an eye roll. Of course Tony would sit there.
“Your heart rate has gone down to a safe level, sir. You are in the clear, for now.”  JARVIS said. Tony nodded.
“Obadiah Stone.” The Captain replied. The team looked shocked.
“I do not want a scratch on her when she gets back here!” Steve called from off screen. Although they couldn’t see him they knew that voice and he meant business.
“Steve loves me?!” Tony said, he was ecstatic. Steve loved him. That’s what he wanted. That’s why he came here. Bucky saw the look in Tony’s eyes and hesiated. “I would never do anything to hurt Steve. Not intentionally anyway. I- I love him too. I wouldn’t want him to be hurt. I promise you.” He said. Bucky softened a little.
“No, nothing. Yet, anyway. It’s just I was thinking.” She said.
“You never told me that.” He said. She shrugged but not dismissively.
“Hi.” He said. “I’m here for an interview with Mister Stane.” The receptionist frowned.
“That’s amazing.” Steve said, breathlessly. “And that?” He asked pointing to the thing in his hand.
“Second door.” Tony nodded.
“Are stupid?” Bucky asked. Tony shook his head still smiling.
“What is it?” He asked.
“Hm?” He asked. Thinking that she had asked him a question or something.
“How did you get past my guards?”
Steve glanced at Pepper, she was wearing all black. In the week leading up to Tony’s death day Pepper and Morgan tended to wear black. It was almost a tradition at this point. On the fifth day, however, the two would leave without a trace. Everyone knew where they went. Their first house, the one by the lake where Tony created time travel. They came back he next day acting like nothing happened. No one questioned it, it was their way of grieving. But in just a few days the two of them were supposed to go, but Morgan wasn’t there. Morgan was alone in the past. Although Steve expected Pepper to act differently, more depressed probably, but she seemed- more open. She was a bit more physical than normal as well, not to say that she hated to be touched but she was reaching out more. Usually she was more closed off around this time, only Morgan could make her smile. But this was different, she was open, and seemingly happier. Peter walked over to Steve after noticing him staring at Pepper.
“you're 16 without a car and you most definitely do not have a license so I will be driving you where you need to go but you are walking home. I still have college.” She said with a smirk.
“His A.I system.” Steve explained. “You aren’t good with loud noises, are you?” Steve asked, bending down to eye level with Tony, who was still sitting. Tony shook his head.
He picked up the trash can from the floor which was now filled with flowers. “It never happened, alright? You’re home now.” Obie said and with that he left the room.
Steve paced around. Morgan was in trouble right under his nose and he had no idea. He promised himself that he wouldn’t lose another Stark and here he was. Again. He was helpless and useless when she needed him. He had no clue how quantum physics works. Get Scott was the only thing he could think of.
“Well, What?!” Pepper exclaimed.
Obadiah looked at the art gallery in front of him. He had been able to track down the only Steve Rogers in New York to this place. Tony was in there, somewhere. Stane knew that Tony would one day find out about his parentage, but he didn’t expect it to all end so quickly, and he was not about let Tony leave so easily. But he had to play his cards right, keep Tony on his side. At least for now. He would rather not resort to drastic measures unless it was absolutely necessary. Reluctantly, he left the gallery. He knew what needed to be done. This was not his first rodeo.
“How did she
“Tony, you can’t. You’re injured. There is no way that in a week you will be able to completely heal.” Steve said. Tony shrugged and swung his legs over the side of the bed and stood up with little support. No one could stop him.
“I think I’ll take you up on that job.” He replied. Tony almost let out his breath of relief. “Now payment.”
“Come on, I’ll introduce you to everybody. No yelling this time, okay?” Steve said. Tony hesitated; the people upstairs seemed mean, and scary to him.
“Morgan even thinking about, changing the past could be dangerous. It may have consequences that you can’t handle.” Bruce said. She sighed.
“Hey, can I tell you guys something?” Tony asked. They turned to him.
“We know Tony.” She said.
“Tony! You better get your ass up and ready for school before I do it for you! Trust me that is not something you want!” she yelled. Tony most definitely did not want that. for the first time in a while, Tony did what he was told and was ready to leave in 15 minutes. “Get in the car or you're going to be late.” Pepper said starting her car.
“I can’t tell you that. But since none of you remember seeing yourselves that’s what happened.” She said.
“His phone.” Rhodey muttered.
“Sure you don’t. I mean, I’m only from the future, what do I know?” She replied. She was an ass. She knew she was an ass, but she was an ass that got the job done. Morgan basically implied that he and Steve were together in the future. Based off the look on Tony’s face he got it too.
“What? You do?!” He exclaimed. She smiled.
“3000.” She confirmed. Pepper nodded and closed the door. Morgan was ecstatic. With her mom gone she could go down to her father’s lab and fix the van. If she worked hard, Morgan might be able to fix it before the weekend was up. She waited until she saw her mom’s car leave before heading back into the elevator, but the button was gone. She frowned, if she couldn’t get to the lab her plans would be ruined. “FRIDAY?” She asked.
“Oh! Right my nail polish can detect poison or something that will harm me in the food I eat. When you hang out with the Avengers, you need to be cautious.” She said. Steve frowned.
“You’re smart. Your gun isn't any gun i’ve seen and I've seen a hell of a lot of guns.” The Captain said. “What does that button on your neck do?” He asked. Tony pressed it and a metal gauntlet was around both of his hands.
“You look nice.” He said. Tony saw him in the mirror. He also saw his own cheeks turn red.
“Sir, are you alright?” JARVIS asked, the one embedded into the building not the mobile one. Tony shook his head.
“Traitor.” He muttered, then nodded. “Yes, 18 years.” The group smiled.
“I don’t know. I made it awhile ago.” He said. “I have other things going on in my head.” Morgan shrugged and stuck her right ring finger into the desert. Steve looked rather offended, Bruce didn’t notice, neither did Tony, Clint raised an eyebrow and Natasha stifled a laugh.
“Pym Particle?” Tony asked.
“Less likely for Hydra to make a scene.” Natasha added.
All languages were google translated (expect for English) I'm not the best at Russian so like I figured the safest way was to use google translate. Thank you so much for reading!!! <3

“The order you just said.” Morgan replied.
“I promise you’ll be safe. You’ll be fine.” Steve said. Tony tilted his head to the other side and scrunched up his nose.
do this.
“Shoot what? I don't want to hit anyone.” Tony said.
“Tony I-” She started but Tony held his hand up.
“We should get back.” Steve said. Bucky nodded.
________
“How often does this happen?”
“JARVIS, do I have any allergies?” He asked.
“Sir, is a genius. As a child, he excelled in all of his education. That is another reason why Mister Stane kept sir in the tower. People would not hesitate to use him for their own personal gain.” JARVIS said. Tony absentmindedly smiled at the A.I for saving him.
“How’s the mobile system coming, J?” Tony asked, trying to take his mind off of his desolate birthday.
“I told you didn’t I? She’s got her heart set on it and there’s no stopping her!” Bruce exclaimed. There was silence. That much was true. Even if they did get the van working there was no telling how much she already did or if she would even come back with them if they were to try and stop her. “She said she would nudge our past selves in the right directions and if they didn’t fix it that was that.” He said.
“Stop trying to the change the past.” He said. She froze for a second.
“Morgan I don’t understand.” He said.
“I know.” She said quietly. “I am prepared for that Doctor Banner. It’s just they’re so happy here, the only time I’ve seen them this happy is never. I’ve never seen all of them this happy and together. I’ve gotta do it.” She said.
“No!” Steve said a bit too loud and fast. He turned a faint shade of pink. “No. It’s fine. Again it’s not like he can do anything to me. I’m his brother after all.” Tony nodded.
“He cut the breaks of Howard and Maria's car. It was not an accident.” Tony said looking The Captain dead in the eye.
“And French, and Russian… and ASL.” She continued.
“What year are you from?” Steve asked putting his shield away.
“You’re a kid?” The man said.
“Shut up that was one time.” She heard Tony said. She smiled and rolled her eyes at their antics. But she noticed something, in Steve’s eyes. He seemed different. Not in a bad way but almost… she gasped. Love-struck. He was so in love. How Tony couldn’t see it she would have no idea ever. It was obvious. Was it just her? Did she know him too well, or was everyone an idiot?
“You’re allergic to strawberries? So is Pepper.” Tony said finally jumping into the conversation.
“Always playing the age card.” She muttered.
“Hello?” A man’s voice said.
“What?! Are you insane?!” Bruce almost said too loud. Tony gave him a puppy dog look.
“There’s been an incident.” He said.
“And the payment.” The girl from before answered. Everyone gave The Captain a look that was a mix between annoyment, shock, and disappointment. The girl snickered and The Captain shot her a look.
“Kid you’re not suppose to leave the compound alone, let alone the year!” Rhodey exclaimed. Morgan shrugged.
“I know you.” He said as they came closer. He smiled and nodded.
“Prove that you are from the future.” Tony said finally. She thought for a moment, before her eyes landed on the arc reactor.
“Right.”
“Well apparently we have to keep you safe and if we figure out time travel along the way that would give me major points.” Tony almost seemed to be bragging.
“Tony! You’re awake. Are you okay?” She asked.
“So she’s obviously hiding something from us.” Clint said.
“Obadiah Stane? Is that your father?” Bruce asked. Tony straightened up a bit.
my real name?” He asked.
“I-I can’t find anyone!” Tony cried to Obie.
“Yeah, you want to see?” Morgan asked. Tony nodded. She turned the phone wide and put her back to the Avengers and held the phone out so they could all see Pepper.
Morgan bounced down the stairs to the lab. Tony was telling her about the devices that he was making. He even asked her for help, well not exactly help. Just asking her to come down and test things out, see if he should do anything else to help the mission go smoothly. She didn’t even make it down the stairs fully before she heard voices.
Comments and kudos are loved! Thanks so much for clicking,
“I have good news and bad news. Which do you want first?” She asked.
“I want a man dead. I don’t care the cost. Money is no object for me. Name your price I just want this man dead.” Tony spat. The Captain thought for a moment.
a tracker you know. Hydra doesn’t. Anyway after we
’ Bucky nodded. The group turned to see Hydra agents starting towards them. Morgan moved herself in front of Bucky. Tony ran around the car to the trunk trying to get his suit out of its case. She watched the group produced their weapons (or in Steve’s case his shield) and start fighting the agents. Morgan looked back to where Tony was. A Hydra agent had a gun pointed at him.
“How exactly do you eat this?” Tony asked after a full minute of staring at it. He saw Clint’s jaw drop.

“Yeah, but she’s okay? Right?” Scott asked.
“Fine, I’ll be the bad guy.”
not only hurt him, but everyone in the house. Her face, however, showed utter confusion.
“Show him things, keep him around here for awhile. Besides, to get good seats for the fireworks, we need to go early.” Steve said. Natasha looked up at everybody, getting their attention silently.
“What?” Tony asked, cautiously.
“Don’t have another choice Dr. Banner!” She yelled into the phone. “I can do this and if I die so be it. It’s my choice, not yours. I have a chance here and I want him to be happy. I know he can be if I do this.” She said. “I’m sorry but I have to. Don’t tell anyone or else I make your future bad.” She said. They both knew it was an empty threat and that she wouldn’t ever do that but it was there.
“It’s going to be okay Pepper. I’m sure he is fine.” Rhodey said. He was afraid himself but he wouldn’t let Pepper know that. She didn't need that. Not right now. He knew how stressed she was. “On my way.” He said and hung up. Tony was going to be okay. He had to be.
“Hi” Tony said.
“Why? You afraid we're going to find something?” Barton asked. Tony shook his head.
“Alright.” He said, finally. “I’m getting older, Morgan and I may not be around for another birthday so I’m going to tell you this.” Morgan shook her head.
!” Tony yelled.
“And survived it without immediate medical attention.” Tony interjected.
“Follow me.” Tony did. They walked through the streets of New York. Tony walked behind Steve, which Steve thought was strange, but didn’t question. Tony was willing to not press charges on counts breaking and entering, just to see some fireworks. Who was he to question anything. But something about Tony struck him as odd... Everytime a car honked, Tony flinched; he kept his head down, and seemed to have trouble keeping up with Steve. He had to slow down his pace multiple times before they reached his gallery. When Steve stopped, Tony almost walked straight into him, and muttered an apology. Tony was officially the strangest person Steve had ever met. Steve was completely at his mercy, and here Tony was apologizing for
“Building things for this mission.” Tony replied. “I really want this to work for Morgan. She needs to go home. She’s only a kid.”
“Every so often he’ll see something or someone or doing something that reminds him of his past self. He sort of breaks the brainwashing and he starts to remember things. Or just questions Hydra and runs away. So we have to find him first.” She said.
“There is no trace of them, not boat and no one has seen anyone that looks like Clint and no one saw Tony. It’s like they were never here.” Steve muttered.
“It was a recorded message. From ten years ago.” She replied. She stood up and faced the lake. “I lost two people ten years ago today. I was five.”
“Yes, of course!” Steven cried.
“Brucie-beaaaarrrrr this guy is really cute!” Tony whined. Bruce sighed.
Follow me and DM if you want a request or something for writing! Thanks for reading <3
“How.” He said, it wasn’t a question.
“Who are you?” Clint asked.
“We have a car over there. We’ll take you home and then we’ll make you better.” Morgan said, pulling lightly on him leading him to the car. She left a stunned group of Avengers in her wake. Natasha followed unaffected slightly laughing at her teammates.
“What’s that door lead to?” Tony asked.
“I missed you bird-brain!” Tony said. He could tell that Cint was rolling his eyes.
“Don’t worry Tony. I
“Tony.” He said at last, and finished untying Steve. “I haven’t heard it in awhile, so excuse me for forgetting.” Tony said sticking his tongue out like a child. Steve’s eyes widen.
“Agreed.”
“I adored you! But didn’t get a lot of time with you before you left.” Morgan said. “I just miss you so much.” She said. Natasha hugged her again.
“How do you know that?” Bruce asked. She smiled knowingly
“Just tell him I went on an expedition with Clint.” Tony said looking exasperated. His father would be proud that he was doing well like his brother and Tony would be happy on land with  Steve and falling in love.
“Clint?! How-Why- what-?” Tony had no idea what to even say. Clint grabbed Tony’s wrist and started to drag him away. Tony wasn’t really resisting. Thor, Bucky’s bodyguard and Natasha, along with  Bucky were now in the room. Watching what was going on. “Clint just give me a few minutes!” Tony exclaimed.
“Love? Steve you guys aren’t even dating, how could you love him?” Bucky asked, trying to keep his tone causal.
“You didn't cancel that?” The guy with the metal arm asked. Tony shrugged.
She stepped out of the elevator and into an old dusty room. She blinked and coughed a few times, swiping the air in front of her, trying to get the dust away from her. The door in front of her was older technology, she frowned at it and tried the keypad. It lit up but she had a coating of dust on her finger after. She rolled her eyes and tried a password. It blinked red and she frowned again. Thinking for a minute she quickly entered another passcode and smiled when the door opened. She smirked at the simple password, it was her mother’s birthday. The door slid open with a horrifying squeak and an unholy amount of dust. She coughed before walking into what seemed like a lab. It had to be her fathers. The bright lights flickered on and she couldn’t help but want to build anything and everything. She noticed there were some robots in the corner and she cocked her head to the side.
“Where are you?!” She screamed into the phone. Morgan held it away from her ear, but after her mother blew her ear drum out.
“Would you remind me, dear. I’m afraid I’m over a hundred years old. You’ll have to forgive me if I forget a few things.” He said. She huffed again but Steve saw a small smile crack through her mock frown.
“I love you.”
“Already?” He exclaimed. “It’s been twenty minutes!” Tony frowned.
“Oh before I forget, Tony, if you want, I found so clothes that might fit you from when I was younger. They’re laid out on my bed.” Steve said, nodding to Tony. Tony smiled again and nodded back. He moved to leave.
“You don't miss it?” He asked. Tony shrugged.
“What’s going on? Morgan? What’s Morgan doing?” Bucky asked walking over. Scott and his family were also paying attention now.
“Well, I just got off the phone with him. But there was someone with him. He told me it was you!” She exclaimed, actually jumping out of her chair. Rhodey didn’t say anything at first.
She watched as Steve kissed him.
were to break into not only my old lab but the company. Then she could get the particles
“I would suggest tying up your unconscious intruder, sir.” The A.I said. Tony nodded.
“Tony, if you weren’t just shot, I would slap you right now.” Rhodey said.
“Same way I got past you. Research.” Tony replied. The Captain snorted.
“I love you Steve!” He blurted. “But I am not sure you will love me if you knew who I am!”
“Time for presents!” Clint exclaimed thrusting a poorly wrapped gift into Steve’s hands. The others did the same.
Tony felt a hell of a lot better after last night. Steve helped him, he had to remember to thank Morgan for that. Without her he probably would’ve drank himself into oblivion. He even called Pepper that night and told her that he would
“FRIDAY?” He asked. He had FRIDAY put into his phone in case they had an update on the situation.
“No.” Tony said. “Let it be a surprise.” Tony and Natasha ended up talking about school of all things and what he missed. Teachers were worried and even a few of the younger students who looked up to Tony because of his smarts were concerned. After about ten minutes they both heard the voices of the boys coming back from wherever they had gone to eat. The door open and all of them stopped and stared in shock at the two.
The port-a-potty smelled, and was dark and small, and Tony hated it. He could manage, however, it wasn’t that bad. He used the hand sanitizer before leaving, and walked out into the cool air. It was an unusually cool night for late May, but the air was so nice and fresh, so much better than the air… inside… the… tower…
“I talked to her.” Peter said. “I let her know we’ll be okay and we’re here for her as well. That Morgan is alone and needs us.” Steve smiled knowingly.
“Well one of us should go up to him.” Clint said.
Also if my Russian is bad I am so sorry! I know very little Russian and I used google translate so I am sorry if it's off!!
“So wait your saying the Obadiah Stone killed-” Barton started.
“Oh, that. Right I forgot.” She said. “Hydra and SHIELD are one. Well mostly- 50 percent.” They gaped at her.
“How did you get there?” Pepper asked.
“You should really tell him you know.” She said starling him. He jumped and and turned to her.
“Really?” Natasha asked.
Weekly post! Comments are loved!
“No! I will never stop fighting you! Damn it! I will never design or build you anything ever again!” Tony yelled back at him. “You have no right to me, or my designs!” Obadiah smiled and pulled on the chains harder.
It took about 15 minutes, but Tony looked adorable when it was done. He had a crown of flowers in his short messy hair, except, it wasn’t really a flower crown, more like a bunch of flowers pinned to his head in a crown shape. Everyone loved the way it looked on him. He ended up almost skipping along.
“Bye.” She said and hung up. She placed her head in between her knees. There was a knock on her door and a second later Steve opened the door.
“Sir, it would seem logical. I have no record of anyone like her anywhere. She did also just appear. Time travel seems to be the best explanation out of everything.” JARVIS said.
“I thought that was what this is?” Tony asked. Steve laughed.
“Pep, Pepper, listen to me as your friend. I am working on something huge! I and cannot wait to show you. But I need a little more time. It is not complete yet but it will be soon. I am so excited about it. Please give me a little more time and I promise I’ll tell you all about it! It’s going to be great. I swear by it. Can you do that? Give me a little more time?” He asked. She giggled a little bit.
“Tony over here has a weak ass heart. if he gets too nervous or overwhelmed with information, a heart attack is likely he's had one before.” Rhodey said.
“Yes, sir?” It replied.
“Plus some?” He asked.
they did go to bed pretty late last night. Also, it was like six in the morning. Tony’s internal clock sucked. He worked fast, as he was used to rushing, it happened often. He usually found himself with a deadline and would have to pull all-nighters just to get things done in time. Taking forever to make coffee would be a waste of precious time. He would hate to see what Obie would do to him if he wasn’t on time and perfect with his prototypes. He smiled at himself, he had always made his coffee in, bulk but it was never for anyone else before. But it was just then that someone opened the door. He spun around on his heels, losing his balance for a minute and leaning against the counter. He faced the door, and a girl with strawberry blonde hair was standing in the doorway. He was not sure what to do for a moment, then he remembered he’d kept the wrench in his pocket, and raised it towards her. His hands were shaking, and he could tell his face showed how terrified he was. This person
“Neither. You were shot.” Steve said. His voice crackled here and there. Tony didn't like that. The memories from that night came back to him. Tony tried to sit up.
“Don’t fall.” She commented but startled him and he fell on the floor. She stifled a laugh and went to help him up. “At least it’s straight now.” She said with giggle. He grabbed her hand and she pulled him up.
Tony nodded slowly, he hadn’t eat lunch today and he never ate breakfast. He would’ve eaten lunch, but a hot blonde guy with a camera broke into his house.
“Oh god, I am so sorry. I didn’t mean to worry you guys it’s just. It’s complicated. I- I was- it was- there was this- argh!” Tony said pushing his head into the pillow.
“JARVIS?” She asked.
“Something wrong?” He asked. Tony didn’t look at him, instead he just tilted his head.
“This is outdated now. I was taught how to hack when I was young and this was something I was taught.” She said. “I
