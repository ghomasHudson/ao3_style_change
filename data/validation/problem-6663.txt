Tony opened his mouth to respond and Steve shoved the plug into his mouth. Only the first few inches fit, but it was good enough. Noises issued from around the metal, but Steve ignored them in order to get back to the task at hand.
Tony swayed before him, giving slow, tired blinks as he took in Steve standing there in front of him in nothing but his skivvies and the shield.
The nightmares had been getting worse lately, since the recent betrayals and attacks, and he knew he should probably go back to talking to the shrinks, but he hadn’t quite reached that breaking point yet. It just made him feel so damn impotent to sit and talk to them hours on end about all his thoughts and feelings. Punching through the anger had always worked just as well as talking.
The wait was torture. It had taken time to get the cameras in place, exactly right, and then longer still for Tony to get his program up and running without setting off any alerts. After Tony had suggested this plan several weeks ago, Steve had hardly been able to contain himself. As soon as Tony confirmed everything was ready, Steve turned him around to face him and dragged a thumb across his lips.
“You’re not that Steve Rogers, and I’m not that Tony Stark, but it doesn’t mean that we can’t learn their lessons. Remembering the pain, remembering what it’s like to live without you, I can’t do that. I’ve had so much time to process all the data, run all the numbers and it all comes out the same every time. We’re better together; you and I. Combined, Captain America and Ironman can make the impossible a reality. We can save this world.”
It was easy enough from there to coax Tony into taking a shower once they had returned and eaten some lunch. Tony had been the one to suggest that Steve join him on the flimsy excuse that they should conserve water while they were off the grid. Still, Steve hadn’t found much point to argue when Tony led him back to the bathroom. If Tony thought he was ready for more touching than simple hand-holding and quiet kisses, then who was Steve to deny him?
Only Tony could be so indignant while sounding so incredibly fragile. Steve would have to do better to keep Tony from sounding like that. He found he didn’t like the tone at all. Tony offered minimal resistance as Steve grabbed one of his hands and coated it in slick. Tony stared at his hand in wonder with the same expression he’d used throughout the day when exploring new sensations. It was incredibly endearing.
“The latest fitness tech out of R&D. I was hoping you would test it out for me, put it through its paces, before I talk to Fury about issuing them to the wider SHIELD agent population. Eventually, we think there may even be a market for them among civilian consumers, though that will be a few years down the road once we work out the bugs and figure out what features people actually care about.”
Please don’t blame yourself too harshly for this. It’s not your fault that I’ve run away. You had no choice but to put me back in the box, just as I had no choice but to do what I must to really, truly live. Don’t worry, I’ve figured out how to be happy in a way that you never could.
Tony gave Steve a long glace up and down to drive the point home. Steve looked appropriately disjointed by this revelation for all of a moment before he schooled his expression back to neutral. Tony relished the shock.
Steve nodded and carried him into the bedroom. The bed creaked under the suit’s weight. Early morning light filtered in through the part in the curtains. Steve closed them, plunging the room into shadow. He took a seat next to the bed, intent on getting a few hours of sleep.
Steve’s grip was impossible to tight. He held Tony firmly in place on his cock. Tony worked the base with his free hand and moaned. Steve’s cock jerked in his mouth as the first load of jizz shot down Tony’s throat. Steve pulled back, causing the rest of his orgasm to splatter hot and sticky on Tony’s face, dribbling down through his beard. Tony continued choking on spit and cum as his own orgasm slammed into him. He panted and caught his breath before glancing back up at Steve and-
Steve wasn’t sure he’d be able to watch on his own. His mind raced, trying to imagine what the video could possibly contain. Brutal murder? Hundreds of followers hailing Hydra? Or maybe it was something Rogers had done while Steve had still been trapped in the cube? What kind of footage would an insane version of himself possibly deem important enough to go through all this trouble?
He stood slowly and reached for Steve’s other arm. Steve told himself it wasn’t disappointment he felt when Tony remained standing rather than join him back on the couch. Tony mirrored the previous motions, from hand to shoulder and back. Try as he might, Steve couldn’t manage to fall back into the blissful state of half-sleep from earlier. Now that he had become aware of his erection he couldn’t put it out of his mind enough to find his former peace. He relaxed further back into the cushions of the couch, ignoring the way it pushed his hips up the tiniest bit. If Tony caught the movement, he gave no indication.
Steve cradled Tony in his arms and rocked him back and forth. Tony had warned him of this, that there might need to be an adjustment period while he got used to having a body again. Or for the first time, depending on how you looked at it. Sensory overload, he had said.
“But clearly he’s being coerced. You saw the same video I did, Tony. You can’t possibly tell me that you would do…that…if you weren’t forced into it.”
Steve looked up from the surveillance photos he’d been studying and over at Tony. His holographic projection had moved closer in a blink and was only inches from him now, staring intently.
“It wasn’t supposed to be like this you know. The Accords. The Team. It- We were supposed to be better. I was supposed to be better. Back Before, when we were still hunting down Hydra bases, I could see it all so clearly. What we were becoming. A real team. A family, almost. And then the scepter happened and the vision and I realized I’d been wrong all along. We weren’t heading towards greatness. We were heading towards destruction. Something had to be done. I could save us, I knew I could. But then Ultron happened and Sokovia happened. And it was all my fault, yet no one held me accountable. Aside from a dip in the stocks, there weren’t any outside repercussions. Why? Because I’m Iron Man. Because I’m an Avenger. SHIELD is gone so now we’re the big kids on the block. No one can come in and stop us from doing what we want because we’re the ones you call to handle people like us."
“I’m not going to let someone go rooting around in my head on the off-chance that all my precautions aren’t working. Besides, I’m pretty sure I would remember waking up sore the morning after a fucking like that!”
Steve slammed his eyes shut on the image of Tony still jerking off in front of him and came with a loud groan. He sat still for several long seconds as orgasm washed over his body and left him a shuddering mess.
“No need to rush away, Cap. No amazingly hot sex is complete without post-coital snuggles. Relax before you get all tense and we have to start all over.” Tony followed up by grabbing the blanket off the couch and settling it down over both of them, laying his head over Steve’s chest. Steve thought maybe he should protest this, but it did feel nice to be pressed up together like this. Tony warmed the chills back out of him. Surely, a few minutes wouldn’t hurt. He closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep to the feel of Tony breathing softly over his heart.
They lay there quietly, the air filled with gasps for breath. The silence was broken by Tony giggling. Steve leaned up to look down at him.
Steve watched Tony’s back until he turned the corner. Slowly, he pointed the remote up and snapped the tv off. He stared at the black screen for a long minute trying desperately not to think about what Tony was most likely doing up in his room right now. He took a deep, steadying breath and glared at his own erection. Not tonight. He forced himself to rinse out his glass of milk and return to his own room. He stripped and settled into bed, with full intention to sleep. Instead, his eyes turned to the remote for the smaller TV nestled on the wall, and his mind automatically supplied the numbers for the channel he’d had on downstairs. He shouldn’t.
“Of course, Darling. I suppose that’s enough teasing for one morning. And I wouldn’t want to spoil your present, though I’m not sure how much you’ll enjoy it now. Here.”
Steve looked at Tony with a sweet, earnest expression. He was clearly happy there was something big enough to warrant calling him in; glad to unite against a common enemy rather than fight each other.
“You could at least pretend to enjoy it, you know. Do you have any idea how hard it was to get my hands on this? $4000 a bottle
It took a few minutes of careful cajoling before Tony finally blinked up at Steve. Tears had gathered at the corner of his eyes and they slid lazy trails down the slope of his face. Steve wondered what nightmare had been plaguing Tony.
“Those are completely different and you know it. You lied because you knew I wouldn’t approve of this. How could you do this to me? You can’t just pick out a shiny new Earth and think that makes it home!”
“Steve, you’ve got nothing to apologize for. None of this is your fault. I wasn’t able to stop them jumping through that portal today. Hell, the fact that they even had a portal is because an AI modeled after my brain decided to be evil. So really, this is all on me.”
The door opened, startling Steve and causing him to step back to face the intruders. A man rolled in a cart covered in food. He parked it by a table behind Tony, bowed to them both, and left without a single word. Tony wandered over and began setting plates on the table. He looked at Steve and gestured to the two bottles in the ice bucket.
Tony stopped typing abruptly. He stared at the screen, trembling. Steve reached out to comfort him but stopped at the last second, hand hovering just over Tony’s shoulder. He shouldn’t touch Tony, he couldn’t; not after that video.
“I can’t say the same. That AI was literally an exact copy of me. Really, I’m the one that has to apologize for all this. I’m the one with the capacity for evil given the right motivation. I mean, this isn’t even the first time.”
Eventually, Tony drew his hand back down to touch his own chest. He moved slowly, gliding gently in a sharp contrast to the movements of his other hand on Steve’s dick. Steve did his best to keep his own desire down to a low simmer in the back of his mind as he watched Tony adjust to the pleasure that could be felt with just fingertips. He found his nipples and spent long minutes circling his fingertips over them, twirling and lightly pinching until they were hard and reddened from the attention.
Tony’s eyes were so dark it was hard to tell their color in this light. They were supposed to be blue, Steve knew, but his pupils were blown wide and face cast in shadow at this angle. Steve registered the question though the words turned into a rush of noise buzzing in his ears. He’d panicked before, but now he took the time to think, to accept the effect Tony had on him. Even if he stopped now, it wouldn’t change that. It wasn’t possible to deny what had already happened with his cock hard and wanting. Tony had been so good to him already, and he was offering so much more. Steve nodded and let his eyes slip closed again.
It had taken time, but they’d finally managed to narrow down the Hydra activity to the Rockies. Steve had been tempted to go it alone, but he wasn’t stupid enough to think he’d be able to handle a twisted version of himself as well as a twisted Tony solo. Especially, if he brought the real Tony with him; they were barely functioning around each other. They’d assembled a team of whoever was available, whichever Avengers felt like coming along. Everything had gone well. Too well. They’d stormed the base, taking out Hydra goons left and right. And then there he’d been: the other him. They fought hard, the rematch Steve had hoped he’d never have to fight. But it was all just a distraction. The other Tony had been nowhere in sight, and then Steve had taken a repulsor hit to the back and the other Tony, the AI made real, was there grabbing Steve’s evil counterpart and flying off. There had been a machine, the other Tony apologizing for the “change of plans”, and a flash of blinding light. And then there had been the real Tony, frantic at the keyboard, shouting about the multiverse.
“Fuck me, huh? I thought that’s what you wanted. You used to anyway. It certainly looks like you’re up for it now, too.”
“I’m sorry,” he gasped. “I’m sorry, Steve, no, keep going. I didn’t mean to make you stop, it just got intense is all, but you can. You can…”
Dreams didn’t mean anything. It was just his subconscious reliving the best damn blowjob of his life. Even when the dreams featured much more than Tony’s mouth around his dick. Dreaming about fucking Tony didn’t mean that he actually wanted to. He was just feeling a little guilty that Tony had made him feel so good and then Steve had just left him to finish off alone. He didn’t want Tony to think he was a selfish lover. That was all. He was grateful to Tony. The empty feeling he got when stimulating himself in the shower was nothing. Steve had just been single for too long.
“Every night at 7, there’s this game show on that we like to watch. It’s called ‘Jeopardy’. It’s a sort of trivia show. Me and Gail keep score to see which of us can answer the most questions right. And then after is ‘Wheel of Fortune.’ That one’s a word puzzle game. They’re a good way to keep our minds sharp.”
The agent continued to explain a very intricate plot that seemed to involve more sex and violence than seemed possible for something that was supposedly set in a small town. The agent finally quieted as the commercials faded and the crying woman once again appeared on the screen. Curious in spite of himself, Steve turned to watch the story unfold as he continued the rest of his work-out. He made note of all the questions he’d need to ask the agent at the next commercial break.
“Well, I see you’ve found the porn. Congratulations, Cap. But if I might make a suggestion, I believe you’ll find that Skinemax is pretty lowbrow compared to some of the higher quality websites you can find on the internet.”
The video started innocently enough, showing an empty room with a large desk dominating the area. The decoration was simple and tasteful. A few prints on the walls looked like something Steve would have done, back when he still took the time to enjoy painting. In fact, it looked exactly like some paintings he’d done shortly after the ice. This whole office looked like-
Steve stared at the unlabeled diskette he’d kept carefully hidden under his mattress for the past few months. He smiled to himself as he snapped it in half and deposited the pieces in the wastepaper basket. He wouldn’t need it anymore.
“So in that case, you should focus on touching me. You can touch yourself too. Get readjusted to the way it feels.”
Tony frowned and Steve could see his metaphorical hackles rising. A distant part of him recognized that arguing like this would be counterproductive, that it wouldn’t get them any closer to the truth. Tony probably needed some space after what they had just witnessed. And the thought that Tony wouldn’t want to talk to Steve, that he might even be repulsed by him, was a knife to his chest. Steve dug in his heels.
Pleasure wasn’t a mystery to Steve. It was a very simple matter, easy to resolve. On his own, with appropriate timing, Steve could take care of himself in a matter of minutes with application of his hand. The times he’d been in relationships and sex had been on the table it was uncomplicated. Foreplay lasted only as long as was necessary to get the ball rolling. Time from initial erection until completion rarely took more than twenty minutes, and never more than an hour. Even those rare times it stretched out, he was in constant motion, touching his partner, kissing, teasing, licking, fucking. He’d never been so still for so long when every instinct screamed at him to move and chase his desire.
It figured that Tony would try to put on a brave face in order to give Steve whatever he thought he wanted.
Except the cuddling was kind of making it feel like it did mean something. And that was not good. He wondered what the proper etiquette was now. Did he just thank Tony for the orgasm and leave? That’s essentially what he had done last time, and everything had worked out well.
“You know things would be a hell of a lot less complicated if you would just let me blow you. Orgasms are a great cure for sleepless nights.”
He replaced Tony’s hand with his own and aimed his cock to deliver thick spurts of jism all up Tony’s stomach and chest, nearly reaching his face.  Satisfied for the moment, Steve ran his hands through the fast-cooling come, rubbing it into Tony’s skin.
“Steve,” he whispered so quietly that even super soldier hearing could barely pick up the word. “I’m so glad you’re here.”
Reassurances were murmured against Tony’s new smooth scalp. It would take some time before the thick, wavy black locks would grow in. Steve hoped he could convince him to wear his hair long enough that the ends curled just slightly. That look had always been one of Steve's favorites. Or rather it had been Rogers' preference, but for once Steve found he was in agreement with his counterpart's taste.
He emphasized his point with a long swallow from the glass in his hand. Steve felt his skin heating the longer Tony kept his gaze, and he fought down the blush threatening to break out. It was dark and Tony probably wouldn’t be able to see it, but Steve couldn’t shake the feeling that Tony would be able to sense the flush with his hedonistic superpowers.
His voice carried through crisp and clear, belaying the presence of a microphone in the vicinity of the desk. Steve moved to stand behind Tony and looked over his shoulder at the computer Tony was tapping at. He was standing close, very close.
A chance to make things right, to clean up all the mess of the world and make it stick this time was all Steve truly wanted. Tony’s brilliance and vision combined with Steve’s dedication and will would surely lead them to success. They would do so much good for the world, together. It may not be love, but Steve needed Tony on his side to do this and that made Tony pretty damn important to Steve.
Slowly, Steve moved his arm to peer up at Tony. Up to this point, Steve had never been able to get Tony’s expressions to match the video exactly. He’d tried a few times, but had never quite managed to get that sharp possessive smile he’d seen Tony give Natasha over a dozen times. He still wasn’t getting that look now.
Steve tilted his head in consideration, and ran an idle hand over his cock. He stepped back and urged Tony to turn over and lie on his back, head hanging over the side of the desk. No doubt it was uncomfortable, but Tony only wiggled his hips hopefully at Steve. Steve’s hand went back to his cock with more intent this time, and within seconds he was hard enough to push back into Tony.
It took a moment for Steve to register that he’d been asked a question, and once he did, it just served to confuse him more. Thankfully, Bucky took the silence as a cue to fill him in.
It had nothing to do with clear blue eyes and thick brown hair. There was no connection to the bulkier body covered in shockingly toned muscles, coated in a sheen of sweat. And if, if, an elegant, full, glistening cock popped up in his thoughts it was only because it had been pounding into Natasha in the video. It was a perfectly normal and logical association.
“I told you before that I remember everything now. I remember how we fought, before, during the first Civil War. And I remember how it felt when I lost you.”
But that also made him more difficult to monitor and control. Right now, he had to assume that Tony was telling the truth about where he said he was going and what he was doing. Being confined to a physical body again would mean that Tony couldn’t just wander about as he pleased, especially if his original would be waking soon, as Tony said he would be.
Tony’s champagne sat untouched in front of him, though his gaze drifted to it periodically as he spoke. Steve wondered if he would drink it now if he could. Could an A.I. be an alcoholic? Had that part of Tony’s mind transferred to the A.I. or had Tony managed to avoid passing on that flaw? Steve sipped from his own glass and watched Tony for signs of envy.
It all made sense now; why Tony hadn't been able to look at him this past month. He'd been too busy simmering in guilt. Well, that was going to end now. Steve wanted to place his hands on Tony's shoulders and will him to believe that this was all Steve's fault. But that kind of contact would likely make Tony uncomfortable now. Instead, Steve settled for taking a step closer.
The hairs on the back of Steve’s neck stood on end. From anyone else, it would have been a playful question without any heat behind it. But nothing was ever innocent with Tony. Tony’s thumb found the base of his neck and began rubbing in gentle circles. Steve felt some of the pressure that he hadn’t realized was there melt.
Over five hundred and fifty channels later, and Steve was not disappointed. At first, he thought he’d stumbled upon another soap opera filled with crappy acting. Steve was quickly becoming addicted to the drama that accompanied such shows.
The thought took hold in Steve’s mind. Tony, on his knees just as he was now, mouth wrapped around him. He wanted it badly enough that he finally gave in and started tugging down his zipper. He ignored the way Tony’s hands disappeared as he inadvertently moved through them. He kicked off his pants and boxers then glanced back up and stopped breathing for a moment.
Stark pat his thigh gently and pecked Steve’s cheek quickly before stalking off to the liquor cabinet. Steve went to bed feeling sated and content and not at all disappointed that he hadn’t quite gotten to make Tony fall apart in his arms.
Tony waited for his words to sink in, anticipation turning his stomach into knots. But this is what he’d decided to do, wasn’t it? To be honest and lay all his cards out. No secrets. No lies. It was the only way the team would be able to function again. The team needed to come back together. The world needed the Avengers. And, at the center of it all, Tony needed Steve.
Steve fastened the contraption to his wrist and found a button on the side. The screen lit up with the time and date as he pressed it. So it was a watch.
Steve whirled back around to see that yes, the two men had started furiously making out on the screen while the woman put that cucumber to a rather creative use. Humiliation flared sharp as Steve turned back to Tony to try to spit out a denial, even as he realized that he would never live this down. In the next second, he choked on his breath when his eyes landed on the tent in Tony’s silk pajama bottoms.
Tony took a moment to admire the penis in front of him. If he were being honest with himself, he’d thought about this more times than was strictly healthy. But then again, this had been one of his favorite jerk-off fantasies as a teenager. And oh, yes, that one very vivid dream on Barton’s farm after they’d chopped wood together. Really, he was only human after all.
Steve wrote down the title and author on a piece of paper as the credits rolled and another show started up. He resumed jumping from channel to channel until he came upon more cheering. A crowd was chanting “Jer-ry, Jer-ry” repeatedly. Well, this looked exciting.
“I’m ok now, really. You can fuck me if you want. Just. Just maybe go slow with it? I won’t freak out again, I promise. It'll be better than it ever could have been with the other me.”
A delicious shiver of heat ran through Steve at the words, there and then gone again. He hadn’t allowed those kinds of thoughts to run through his head. There’d be no point to it aside from compounding frustration. But now that Tony brought it up, it was all he could think about.
How had he not noticed getting hard while Tony rubbed his back? He should have been aware the second it happened. And how had he not noticed that Tony was aroused behind him? He’d been sleepy but it shouldn’t have been enough to make him miss the sizable length that was now pressing into him. Had he been drugged? Normal drugs shouldn’t affect him. He’d eaten dinner with the other Ultimates. The oil? Had Tony put something in the oil? But he’d been touching it too. Steve brought a hand up to shove Tony away as Tony reached down and pinched Steve’s nipple. Steve froze at the shock of it.
“Reed had a machine that he used to examine alternate timelines across the multiverse. Since he’s not around anymore I decided to borrow it and take a peek at Earths with Hydra in charge for strategic planning. I stumbled across this one by accident but figured we could work with it.”
Slow, he reminded himself. If he wanted Tony to be his completely, then he needed to go slow with this. It wouldn’t do to rush and put Tony off from it all. Steve breathed out heavily against Tony’s neck, kissed him again, then reached into the nightstand for the lube he’d stashed away.
Steve gave Tony’s hand a quick squeeze, so grateful they’d managed to heal enough to get to this point.
It had taken weeks to get this far. Ever since Tony had told Steve of his plans they’d had to move carefully and quietly to secure the last of the materials needed. Even the followers Tony had managed to gather for Steve had no idea what they were doing. Tony had insisted that not so much as a hint of what he was attempting get out, lest one of the many superhero groups currently running around the country catch wind of it.
No. Not like this. Tony deserved better. Besides, this new body didn’t have to mean that Tony would leave him. Everyone that had once stood at Steve’s side had either died or betrayed him. Perhaps he wouldn’t have to add Tony to that list.
He caught Tony’s lips as the other man sat back up and spent several long moments kissing him, cameras momentarily forgotten. He was so lucky to have this Tony on his side. They parted and Steve went about collecting their equipment and erasing all traces of their activities here tonight while Tony cleaned up and redressed.
“There is no threat. Not yet, anyway. But there will be. It’s only a matter of time. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that there’s always a bigger threat looming around the corner. We can’t afford to stay fractured like this. We need to work on healing and getting stronger. And that starts with you and me. So let’s make with the Kumbaya.”
“…my office?” Tony whispered as if afraid to speak too loudly. The camera finished panning the room and settled back at the desk, where Tony now stood, absorbed in something off-screen. The angle changed, and there Steve was, attaching another camera to the wall. Tony tapped something into the keyboard and nodded happily.
It may have been minutes or hours after they started that the door finally cracked open and steam billowed out, obscuring Steve’s vision. He rushed forward and caught the figure collapsing just inside the doorway.
Steve had expected dirty talk. He had prepared himself for the kind of filth he’d heard spewed at Natasha. What Steve hadn’t expected, what he couldn’t have anticipated, were the delicious moans and sweet whispers. He hadn’t known Tony would pull him in and kiss him breathless. He hadn’t a notion that Tony could sound so wretched and broken while pleading with Steve to give him more. More kisses, more touches, more fingers, more cock, more, more, more. Tony was greedy and Steve was more than happy to cater to his demands.
Steve pressed his hands to his legs where Tony’s hovered, following their trail up and down his thighs. He could see his hands moving through Tony’s, but he tried his best to ignore that, to pretend the touch wasn’t his own. He eased off a little to make the touch lighter, more of a tease. That was the way Tony would be with him, feather light and barely there at first.
Steve pressed a thumb to one of the bite marks from earlier at the same moment he latched his mouth onto one of Tony’s nipples and sucked. Warm, wet splatters fell against his stomach only moments later as Tony keened loudly. Steve pulled away just slightly to tumble onto his side and curl around Tony.
They were pretty words. Tony had always had a flare for dramatics and romanticism. Steve was even tempted to believe him. Vision, after all, had proven that androids could be just as human as the rest of them. Thoughts of Pym-tron up in his new frozen home kept Steve grounded. This man was not Tony Stark, but he was no less dangerous.
Steve punctuated this point with a sharp pinch to the nipple he’d aroused. He released the bud between his fingers and went about gently caressing Tony’s sides, warming his skin and soothing the goosebumps that had arisen there despite the heat from the shower.
Steve couldn’t help the frown on his face though. Dammit, he’d known Tony wouldn’t be ready for too much. It’s why he hadn’t planned on fucking him tonight. But he’d gotten carried away all the same. He pressed his lips to one of the angry purpling marks decorating Tony’s collarbone.
“Oh. I guess you really do feel good, huh? I’m flattered. I wasn’t expecting you to want the happy ending, but I’d be thrilled to oblige you, Darling.” As he spoke, Tony rocked gently back and forth, flicking his finger at the same pace against the nipple he’d pinched. Steve flushed, ashamed at the arousal crawling under his skin.
“Get out.” Steve spit out the words like acid, humiliation burning bright. Tony reached out, thought better of it and placed his hands on his knees, folded as if in prayer. Steve would have laughed at the idea if he could summon up amusement past the anger. Tony kept his eyes downcast as he spoke.
A body. Tony would have a body soon. Steve pondered the implications of this. It was convenient now to have Tony exist as a program. He could be anywhere in the world in the blink of the eye. Sometimes he was even several places at once.
“To your Presidency! It may have been one of the shortest in our country’s history, but hopefully it will go down as one of the most successful. Cheers!”
Steve pushed Tony's pants down over his hips and cupped his erection through his briefs. Tony was so sensitive right now it probably wouldn’t take much at all to leave him a sated puddle on the floor at his feet. They’d have to go slow if Steve wanted more than awkward fumbling in the shower. Speaking of which…
“That’s wonderful, Darling. You deserve to feel good for once.” Tony’s hands glided up to his shoulders again, fingers curling under to squeeze at his pecs. “If you turn around I can do your front, too.”
Steve’s fair skin was inflamed in red. He could feel the heat on his cheeks. Still, he couldn’t find the words to stop Tony.
The language was a bit more lewd than that of its various daytime counterparts, but he didn’t have any inkling that anything was wrong until the clothes started coming off and nothing was blurred.
He shoved forward, entering Tony without warning and delighting in the high-pitched moan it earned him. There was no time to adjust as he pulled back out and rammed right back in, setting a fast and brutal pace that shook the desk with every thrust. Tony cried out around the plug, keeping time with the wet slap of balls against flesh.
Tony eyed the bottle with trepidation but quickly schooled his expression enough to smile weakly up at Steve. He ran his hands over Steve’s chest and spread his legs wider.
He wasn’t sure if he was successful because suddenly they were kissing again and when had his hands slipped into Steve’s hair and how had Steve gotten his hands under Tony’s shirt so quickly? His thoughts flew wildly as he tried to keep up with what was happening in front of him.
“I didn’t need a fancy office with a big ol’ desk. I had to be out there,” he said, gesturing with an outstretched arm. Tony reached out to clasp his hand, release it, then run his fingers up the length of his arm, dragging on the armored surface of his uniform.
Tony felt the alcohol he’d consumed rear its head and found himself answering before he could think better of it.
Amusement won out over frustration at Tony’s one-track mind. The man simple didn’t give up. Steve had to admire that character trait. Steve smiled wide enough for Tony to feel it pressed into his neck.
A body would make Tony vulnerable to their enemies. But it would also make him vulnerable to Steve. So it came down to if one of those outweighed the other.
Steve moved aside as Tony pushed his way in. The adrenaline spike from waking was fading but Steve’s heart was still hammering in his chest.
Steve tightened his hold on Tony and pressed his lips into the curls tickling at his face. “I’m not. And you’re not just a warm body, Tony.” Tony’s voice shook in the quiet of the night.
Finally, meal finished, he left the television alone for a moment to wash his dishes. He returned from the sink moments later and noticed that he had paused on some sort of cartoon. Steve had always been fond of the cartoons before the films he used to see. Maybe he’d like modern cartoons too.
“I’m guessing there’s something special about this watch if you want SHIELD to buy it. What is it? Water-resistant?”
Tension speared through Steve at the words. There had been others. Other men, who had gotten to touch Tony like this. But not this Tony, he reminded himself. That was the other Tony. This Tony would be just for him. If he ruined him for all others, then Tony would never leave him, right?
Steve nodded before he could think better of it and crossed the room to join Tony for the meal. He tried to hide his surprise as Tony poured out two glasses.
As the words left his mouth, Steve realized that the LMD could be a possibility. Rogers had been given unlimited access to all of SHIELD’s resources, including what Steve knew was a very impressive stockpile of robotic replacements. But would he have done that, used a gussied-up sex doll to taunt Steve? Steve looked into himself and thought about it without his general morals getting in the way. Was he desperate enough to sleep with a fake? Or rather was he petty enough to sleep with a fake Tony and record the whole thing for revenge? He didn’t think so, but he didn’t like the alternatives any better.
Steve came back to the room as he shifted and realized he was hard. He glanced around at the others nervously, but no one was paying him any mind. Pietro and Wanda were leaving. Hawkeye was arguing with them, no surprise there. Jan was talking at Tony while he gulped down more and more liquor. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed. Some of the alcohol had missed his mouth and a droplet very slowly trailed its way down through his stubble. Steve hadn’t noticed before, but Tony had left his shirt mostly unbuttoned. Steve wasn’t fond of liquor, but he wondered how it would taste mixed with Tony’s skin and sweat. Steve was saved from wondering where the hell that thought had come from by Venom bursting through the living room wall.
Steve leaned down to tell Tony he was leaving only to receive a kiss on his open mouth. He spent several minutes distracted by Tony’s tongue. Finally, Tony released his mouth and settled down half on top of Steve. Steve continued to lay there as Tony’s breathing evened out. He slipped out of the room about an hour later. Staying the night would have made this something.
Steve nudged Tony’s brow with his lips and twined their legs together under the sheets. He thought of the shining red and gold armor at his back in battle. Stifling a yawn, Steve grinned into the space between them.
There wasn’t much talking after that. It shouldn’t have been a surprise, the way they just seemed to know exactly what to do with each other, but somehow Steve hadn’t been expecting the easy way Tony opened up to fit them together like jigsaw pieces. After so many years so close, hovering on the edge of this thing between them, Steve didn’t need Tony’s moans or gasps to tell him how to move. And then, after, they rolled over and slotted perfectly together as their heartbeats calmed down. It was as if they’d been made just for this, Steve reflected. In the back of his mind, the thought they might not have ever gotten to this point if it hadn’t been for Rogers burned like a hot iron.
As it turned out, “Jeopardy” was very entertaining. Steve had experienced some difficulty with the contemporary literature category, but he’d nailed just about all of the Renaissance art questions. To top it all off, he’d actually learned quite a bit to boot. Perhaps “Jeopardy” could be employed as a means to catch up. The SHIELD files wouldn’t have everything he’d missed. Besides, Bucky said that while some of the questions were obscure, a good bit of them were common knowledge and any average, well-rounded adult would be able to answer at least a handful every show. SHIELD had been encouraging Steve to begin adapting to newer technology, so maybe watching trivia shows on television would be a good place to start.
“If I say ‘no comment’ can we drop this conversation and move on to why you were looking for me in the first place?”
The grip in Tony’s hair tightened further and Tony’s head canted back with a sharp yank. Steve traced his fingers over Tony’s exposed throat. He brushed Tony’s lower lip with his thumb and Tony obediently opened his mouth. Steve dipped his thumb in to feel along his tongue and teeth before retreating.
Then he took notice of how close they were standing. Hadn’t Steve been across the room only a minute ago? The impulse to press closer thrummed in his veins. He marveled at the urge, wondering when he’d started wanting such a thing, surprised that he hadn’t been able to recognize it sooner. The smart thing to do, he supposed, would be to walk away for now and allow time to analyze his feelings in private. He should take time to thoroughly evaluate this revelation and all the possible outcomes and consequences of any actions he may or may not take. Tony prided himself on being a Futurist, being able to think things all the way through. But when was the last time knowing the future had done him any good?
“He used to think about you up here in your office with this great big desk. You would get so stressed talking about meetings. But the desk, it’s big enough that even I would be able to fit under it with no one the wiser. I could just stay down there and keep your mind on better things.”
Tony gathered a decent amount of saliva in his mouth and then leaned in to start delivering big, wet licks. He sucked the head with a frown. Spit was a terrible lube, but it would be better than nothing at all between Tony's hand and Steve's dick. He bobbed his head a few times, no more than a quick tease before going back to sloppy licks along the shaft. Steve placed a hand gently on Tony’s head. It was the softest of touches, as if he wasn’t sure if it was okay, unwilling to push things further. It was a sharp contrast, this sweet careful touch, to the strength Tony knew those hands were capable of. He thought back, remembering pounding fists, torn sandbags, crushed metal, splintered logs, bruised and broken flesh. It seemed almost impossible that the same hands that had done all that could now be so gentle. Tony spared a thought to what those hands would feel like elsewhere on his body, all over and inside. He shivered. No. That wasn’t what this was about.
Steve couldn’t help his smile at Tony’s words, his promise to work together despite everything they had seen and learned today. He turned and clasped Tony’s hand to his, looking back up to the message. He vowed to himself that this time would be different. This time he wouldn’t stop until it was truly over.
Steve licked the shell of Tony’s ear as he said this, nibbled at it, bit down. Tony moaned and writhed against him, turning to pant wetly against his cheek.
it became impossible to get, this is top of the line. If I knew you were just going to chug it, I might as well have gotten sparkling grape juice.”
Strong metal arms wrapped around Steve’s middle. Tony’s voice was calm through the Ironman speakers.
Tony brought his other gauntlet up to cradle Steve’s hand holding his wrist. The metal should have been cold to the touch. It wasn’t.
Tony was painfully aware of the alcohol on his breath as he took half a step closer and pushed onto his toes. He’d been half expecting, maybe even hoping, that Steve would stop him. It would have been easy enough for him to put his hands on Tony’s shoulders and gently push him back down, away, make his lack of interest clear. But instead those big hands came down to settle on Tony’s shoulders and pull him closer.
“It’s funny because its true, isn’t it?  Captain America doesn’t like to exercise! Do you have any idea how many fitness challenges are named after you?”
Steve wasn't a homosexual. He’d been with Jan for over a year, and been with Gail even longer before the ice. All the time he’d spent with them, he’d never found himself wishing they’d had a penis. Steve liked women, even if most of them did speak and act like men nowadays. He liked breasts. Steve wasn’t a poof.
Tony’s eyebrows jumped, but he gave no other indication of surprise. With a quick salute he strolled over to the door. No one should be coming down here, but the last thing Steve needed was some aide or agent wandering in to see him half-dressed with Tony Stark. He pulled off the top half of his uniform, then after a moment’s hesitation stripped off his heavy boots and socks as well. He wriggled his toes and enjoyed the sensation of freedom. Steve glanced at the chair he’d been sitting in, decided he’d be more comfortable stretched out, and moved over to lay face down on the couch. He was happy to discover it was long and wide enough to fit him with room to spare. No doubt whoever had picked it out thought he might need to nap on it someday. He turned his head and watched Tony through slit eyes. The other man had taken a bottle from his pocket and was rubbing the liquid from it between his hands. He approached slowly and traced a single finger down the length of Steve’s spine.
Tony popped the cork with ease and poured out a glass for each of them. Steve considered kicking him out to go back to ruminating in silence, but then the flute was in his hand and Tony clinked them together merrily.
The faceplate flipped up on the armor and there was Tony’s face just as Steve remembered it, all in shades of blue. Steve took a deep breath and reevaluated their surroundings. He had to reassess, figure out what was happening here. The Tony A.I. had fought against him with the others who hadn’t understood. There was no reason for him to change sides now that Steve had lost and the phony Rogers was back. Unless. Unless Tony had somehow found out the truth of things. Maybe he’d found proof that Steve wasn’t what was fake in this world.
If he was lying, he was very convincing. Steve needed to be careful or he really would fall for him.
“Gu,” Steve managed to get out. His voice caught in his throat after the disuse. How long had they been here? He cleared his throat to try again. “Good.” It came out stronger this time. “Really good, Tony.” Steve would swear that he could feel the force of Tony’s smile behind him. It was clearly evident in his voice. Steve warmed. Tony was happy that he’d made him happy. He shouldn’t think about that too much.
Tony brought his other hand up and held Steve’s shoulders. The pressure was barely felt through the thick material of the uniform. Tony leaned down to speak into Steve’s ear.
“I wanted to surprise you, but I’ve seemed to hit a bit of a snag and I need your help to finish it. My new body, that is.”
“I’m not after anything. It’s just a simple observation. Don’t want you to have to be alone tonight.”
Rather than waste time with a response, Steve merely reached down to unzip his pants and pull his cock out, glad that he hadn’t bothered with underwear for this. Tony fell gracefully to his knees and made a show of licking up the salty precome that was already gathered around the head. He took Steve in slowly, humming happily as he sucked lightly. Steve let him get away with it for a few seconds then reached down and grabbed a fistful of hair.
“You’re still so keyed up. Let me help you relax, and I can tell you what I know about the recent history on this Earth. Then we can go find civilization.”
Tony pulled off Steve’s cock and looked up at the other man through his eyelashes. Steve’s head was tilted back, making his expression impossible to see. Tony took the short panting gasps as a sign he was doing good so far. He began massaging the turgid length with his fingertips, copying the gentle grasp in his hair. Steve’s hips pumped, trying to find the rhythm that had just been lost. He looked down at Tony with wide, confused eyes.
Steve woke up fully clothed and alone the next morning wrapped in soft sheets that did not belong on his bed. They smelled like hot metal and scotch. Steve remembered that smell fondly. Fuck.
Frozen in shock, Tony didn’t move at all until Steve canted his hips and started thrusting up into his fist. Then he shuddered and moaned and looked down at Steve moving through his fist. His other hand remained gripped tightly on Steve’s shoulder.
“I know these shows are cliché as hell, but my mother used to watch them when I was a kid and they just remind me of her. Plus the drama is great. For instance, that chick there just woke up from a coma and found out that her fiancé, the dude that was stabbed, has been sleeping with her half-sister who is now pregnant. And what neither of them knows is that the half-sister has been having an affair with coma-chick’s doctor, who-”
When Jan burst in the door waving around a DVD and calling for a team meeting Steve wasn’t exactly sure what he should be expecting. Certainly, he was not expecting their massive television screen to be filled up with images of Tony Stark and Natasha Romanov entwined in a passionate embrace. Many embraces actually. In many positions. And oh wow, Natasha had been really flexible.
Tony was surprisingly light when Steve picked him up. One would think Tony would have been able to make sure his new body was at a proper weight before he crafted it. Then again, they’d been on a time crunch to use this building undetected so it wouldn’t be surprising if shortcuts had been taken with things like muscle mass. It would be a very Tony thing to do. Steve would just have to make sure Tony took proper care with eating and exercise from here on out.
Steve wasn’t avoiding Tony. He was a busy man. Tony was a busy man. They couldn’t be expected to keep in constant contact. It wasn’t through any deliberate action that their only interaction was during official Ulitmates business in the next few weeks.
Steve was not picturing Tony sucking his cock in the middle of breakfast with the team. It was completely unhealthy to have an ice pop for breakfast. Tony was an adult. He should know better. Plus the slurping noises were distracting. Jan thought so too if the look on her face was anything to go by. And really, did it have to be the Captain America ice pops? Steve was not jealous of a goddamn ice pop.
“You know, that’s pretty arrogant too. To put all this mess squarely on your own shoulders. It wasn’t just your mistake. It’s my job to listen when the people I’m in charge of try to tell me something. We all wanted to do what was best for the team. I was just too caught up in personal matters to see what that was. I was compromised. I can see that now. I should have trusted you to have my back. I thought I could do better if I handled everything myself and I’m sorry. I guess we both need to learn how to share responsibility now and again.”
It was as steam began to fill the space between them and form glistening drops on Tony’s skin that a new thought skittered across Steve’s mind.
Then again, it was fine to play for now, as long as he remembered not to take it seriously. For all he knew, none of this was real.
“Oh sure. If you had known what was going to happen then of course you would have told me. If I had known we’d find definitive proof that your mystery man framed the one-armed wonder I wouldn’t have had to fight you like that. We’d all do things differently if we knew what the outcomes would be in advance. But life doesn’t work that way. You lied, we fought, and the Avengers are splintered down the middle. Now we both have to live with it.”
The look on Tony’s face now was so much better. He stared down at Steve with his brow furrowed in concentration, a soft light in his eyes. His mouth parted and hot breath puffed out to hit Steve’s overheated skin. Tony’s gaze locked onto Steve’s uncovered eyes. He shifted his weight and brought a hand up to cup Steve’s cheek.
His breath caught at the sound of a creaky floorboard down the hall. He glanced over at his alarm clock. The short hand pointed at 3, meaning it was either too late or too early for anyone else to be up right now. Perhaps he’d woken for a reason after all.
Steve breathed out heavily through his nose. The rage was beginning to fade, but it left the energy thrumming in his muscles nowhere to go. He analyzed the situation. For better or for worse he was stuck on this new Earth. Tony knew this environment and the way to get them home. Tony loved Steve; he wouldn’t betray him. But still…
“I didn’t know. Oh god, I would have. But it wasn’t true. I had, there were others, but they could have been you. I would have done anything he wanted.”
Tony toed off his shoes and settled in the high-back armchair next to the fireplace. The ice clinked faintly as it rocked in the amber liquor in his glass. The bottle sat half empty at his feet, within easy reach for the next pour. The window showed his reflection contemplating the crackling fire against the inky backdrop of the night. He sat, lost in his thoughts and idly sipping his drink, waiting.
“I. I can’t answer that right now, Tony. So much of myself, of who I am, is wrapped up in a false life. I’ve only just begun unraveling what is mine and what is His. I thought I loved Sharon, that what the two of us had was strong enough to last through anything. I was wrong about that, clearly. I need to be careful not to let what happened when I was living His life interfere with the true reality. He loved Tony Stark, in that other life, but I don’t know yet if I love Tony Stark in this life.”
Steve came up behind Tony where he stood typing at the desk and rubbed his erection against his pert bottom. There was a brief pause in the glide of Tony’s fingers over the keyboard before he resumed just as before. Steve leaned forward to whisper in his ear.
Steve regretted the words almost as soon as they left his mouth. What the hell was he saying? The last line had nearly sounded like a damn proposal. Maybe he needed sleep more badly then he thought.
He’d nearly forgotten about the other agent, enthralled in his exercise as he moved to weights, when a loud, sharp scream sounded. Steve dropped the weights immediately and spun around to face whatever assailant had caused such distress. Instead, he saw only the agent fiddling with the remote. The agent glanced over at Steve and blushed scarlet.
Steve felt his mouth go dry. He thought to say no, throw Tony out of the office and bolt the door behind him. But then Tony’s thumb went back to rubbing circles along the back of his neck. He couldn’t deny that it felt good. He imagined the same pressure on the tired muscles of his back would feel just as good. It was a tempting offer. But he hadn’t missed the sultry tone of Tony’s voice. Steve wasn’t stupid. He knew what a seduction looked like. He couldn’t say he was terribly surprised. Tony had made overtures before, but nothing this direct. Giving him an inch now would lead to Tony taking a mile. If he consented to Tony’s hands on his body he wasn’t sure how far Tony would push things. He should say no. He should…oh! Tony dug his thumb harder into his spine. Steve felt a pop and it hurt for a moment but then the pain and tension melted and left nothing but a pleasant throb in its place. And then his hands were gone.
“Steve, that warped cosmic cube clone is nothing like you. He’s a good actor, but you could never be anything like him.”
It was a struggle to maintain the tortuously slow pace Tony had set, but he refused to break a second time. Steve kept his eyes focused on Tony, matching his every stroke. He watched as Tony lifted his other hand to tweak and pinch at his nipple and copied the motion. The need to cum became harder to ignore when Tony paused his hand on his crown and rubbed his thumb over the slit. It did nothing for Tony, but Steve could feel the sticky smear of his own precum spreading out over his cock.
He reached the box out towards Steve, who took it with trepidation. The bright yellow wrapping paper failed to cheer him as he diligently peeled the tape back and removed the wrapping in one piece. Tony rolled his eyes at Steve’s caution, but it was nice paper and Steve saw no point in ripping it to bits when he could easily reuse it this way.
Steve looked down and ran a hand through his hair. It was the most truth that he could offer right now, though it may not be enough to satisfy Tony. There was a pit, deep and throbbing in his stomach and he refused to think about why he so desperately wanted to offer Tony more than this. It would be better to give him more reassurance, to make sure he wouldn’t leave. Steve told himself that was it anyway.
He’d known that massage parlors and spas were popular, but he hadn’t seen what all the fuss was about. The appeal became clear with Tony kneading the tension out of his body bit by bit. He lost track of time as his consciousness floated. It could have been ten minutes or an hour. Fingers moved over his hips, up his sides, down his spine, around his neck, through his hair. There was a vague sense of arousal mixed with the pleasure, lazy and unhurried. He paid it no mind as he drifted, with sleep clouding in at the edges of his mind. Steve felt honey-dipped in sunshine with all his cares falling away. When was the last time he’d ever felt this relaxed?
There were at least 5. Steve had seen them in magazines. Someone had even hung one of the pages up at his gym. It was also one of the most common soft ball questions reporters liked to ask him, on the rare occasion when he let Fury and Betty Ross talk him into giving an interview. How does Captain America like to keep in shape? The truth was that he didn’t really need to do anything. Between the super soldier serum, field missions, and training drills, Steve did all he needed to maintain his physique. He did an obligatory work out a few times a week, but never went out of his way to hit the weights if he had an excuse to avoid it. But no one was supposed to know that. He had an image to maintain after all.
They had always been so tactile with each other, the other two that was. But Steve could remember how good it felt to rest his arm across Tony shoulders, brush a hand against the back of his neck, or engulf him in a hug. It wasn’t hard from there to put his imagination into the mix and think of all the ways they hadn’t touched yet. It had been so long since he’d had…any kind of touch at all really.
When Tony pulled off, he thought to protest, but then the tongue brushed his balls and the words died in his mouth. He closed his eyes and leaned back down. He trusted Tony at this point to get him off.
“Yes, I would. I’ve thought about you like that countless times. Your evil twin wouldn’t have had to force me. So, yes, I’m the one to blame for this whole situation, and I’m so sorry.”
Steve remained silent and groaned as Tony pulled away at last. He splayed his legs open wider at Tony’s prompting. Steve didn't offer any protest and then Tony was pushing impossibly closer. He rocked gently back and forth as he worked his way deeper and deeper inside.
Steve didn’t miss Tony. You couldn’t miss someone you lived with, right? Steve’s melancholy was the same as it always was. He was a man out of time. He didn’t belong here. He didn’t belong with anyone. He was meant to feel this loneliness. The empty ache that took residence whenever he thought of Tony was a coincidence. It wasn’t like he was in love with the guy.
Steve rolled over onto his side and tried desperately to cling to the dream he’d been having. As awareness of his own body and the blankets he was wrapped in returned, the dream faded away to static. Stubbornly, he refused to acknowledge he was now awake. He was certain that if he could just remember why the image of cotton candy cones lingered behind his eyelids, he’d be able to slip back to sleep for another hour or two. He had just determined that it had something to do with a carnival…and maybe Clint had been there…when the knock sounded again.
Steve’s eyes were drawn back to the computer as their counterparts whispered soft, loving words and kissed slowly. The sight of himself tangled together and lip-locked with Tony was mesmerizing. Could he and Tony have had that? He knew it was too late now and hated Rogers just a little bit more.
He was enjoying his last night in office in comfortable solitude, so naturally it was only a matter of time before Tony came trotting in through the door. The Billionaire came in silently except for his soft footfalls on the carpet, carrying two glasses and a bottle of Dom Perignon.
Steve didn’t talk to Tony about what had happened the next morning. Or the morning after that. In fact, it was nearly a full week later before Tony finally lured Steve to his room and sat them down with a bottle of scotch. They even managed to have a full fifteen minutes of discussion about relationships and expectations and 21st century orientations and identities before they started pulling off each other’s clothes.
Steve leaned down to press kisses along Tony’s jaw, straight back to his ear. He nibbled briefly at the lobe then pulled back far enough to whisper.
The SHIELD gym facilities were just what Steve had expected them to be: impressive and entirely too flashy. If it weren’t for the fact that the old gym a few blocks from his apartment was being fumigated, Steve would never have stepped foot inside this decadent place. They had televisions attached to the treadmills, for chrissakes! Who needed to watch television while they worked out? And what was half this equipment even for? Good old-fashioned weights were all a fella really needed. He chalked all the excess up as just another of the confusing things about the 21st century.
Tony had more channels available than Steve had ever seen, including those ridiculous pay-per-view ones that made you cough up even more money for every show you watched. Steve decided to take full advantage of this and gleefully began scrolling from one channel to the next. He was determined to find something more exciting than a home-shopping channel.
Somewhere from the depths of the mansion a grandfather clock struck the hour. Technically it already was morning, but Steve was trying not to think about that. He might get another three or four hours of sleep until the sun woke him up.
There was a quiet desperation in Tony’s voice. It shone in his glassy, red-rimmed eyes. Steve knew that rejecting the other man would only cause him to exchange the glass in his hand for the bottle, if there was even anything left in it. His chest ached at the thought of it. Silently he grasped Tony’s hand and pulled him into his bedroom.
Steve was not crying like some nancy-boy. He’d just gotten sweat and blood and dirt in his eyes. They were fighting some kind of blob monster and it had just eaten Tony. Steve wasn’t crying. He’d be just as upset if it were any of their other teammates. He’d be just as terrified if it’d been Thor or Hawkeye or Jan. Okay, maybe Jan was a bad comparison.
Tony was right, he never stopped working, never gave himself a break. Even his identity-crisis-induced foray into the desert had involved sleeping on the hard ground and hunting snakes for food. Rest was a foreign concept to his enhanced body, a luxury rendered unnecessary by the serum in his blood. Half the sleep of a normal human proved more than enough and still left him thrumming with energy itching to be shed. The reunification of the country had taken its toll though. It had been fighting a war nonstop following all the other shit that had gone down recently that had finally brought him back to his limits, mentally if not physically. The past few weeks had been rough enough to bring him low. Wariness, he knew, clung to him like a cloak these days. He thought he’d been doing a good job hiding it, but Tony had seen right through him.
Steve stood watch in front of the chamber, keeping a silent vigil. He wondered how much longer it would be. Tony had said the process wouldn’t take too long, but he’d been vague on the specifics. Soon. Soon his Tony would have a body and Steve would have more than an empty suit of armor standing by his side.
The anger Steve had felt at seeing his counterpart continued to simmer under the surface, redirected at the only target left to him. An army on another Earth. Really?
It was like a punch to the gut. He’d known. He’d always known, but he’d never had it confirmed, so he hadn’t truly known it. He shut his eyes against the swell of emotions. He was stronger than this. It was his other self that was the weak one, not him. This wasn’t even the real Tony. It would be stupid to lose himself to emotions that weren’t even his. He needed to stay focused on his mission.
That night, Steve slipped off to shower. As he left the room he pretended not to see Tony watching him with slit eyes and a hurt frown on his face.
Tony shook his head and focused back on the screen. Steve tried to make sense of it all. He knew the other him was delusional, but how far would he go, if he were to truly go after Tony, how much was he capable of?
No. Nonono. This was worse, so much worse than a beating. The other Rogers had molested Tony. He was- was raping him right on screen in front of Steve and there was nothing Steve could do because it had already happened. Except it didn’t really look like rape. Tony wasn’t protesting anything that was happening and in fact appeared to be enjoying it quite a bit. But that didn’t mean anything. Rogers must have coerced him somehow. But Christ, if this had happened then how in the world had Tony not realized that wasn’t Steve.
The words were hardly out of his mouth before he realized just how they sounded. He had a moment to ponder a clarification but then Tony was giving him a look that absolutely smoldered and suddenly it didn’t matter.
“I figure I have about a decade of tension to make up for. I think that starts with you naked in my bed.”
They kissed, a messy smear of fluids broken only to allow Tony to remove Steve’s shirt. Steve hadn’t planned on being naked for this, but Tony enjoyed feeling the press of Steve’s chest against his body, so he let it go, but spun the other man around and bent him over the desk before he could push his pants off as well. Steve gave a harsh smack to Tony’s exposed asscheeks in revenge for his shirt, and then smoothed his hands over the reddened flesh. A tug, and the thong was ripped off.
