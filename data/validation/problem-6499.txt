“Thank you,” Steve said at the door. He always did, even when the sex was at their angriest, like it was some kind of polite exchange. Like Tony was doing him a favor.
It was quiet for so long that Tony wondered if Steve had just turned around and walked away. He wouldn’t have blamed him. It would be easier. “When was the last time you slept, Tony?”
It was a fair point, but Tony wasn’t in good condition after the protracted fight with Kilgrave’s army of innocent puppets. Kilgrave had drawn Tony away and then surrounded him with a hundred civilians holding guns to their heads. Steve had arrived just as Tony stepped out of the suit, and had to watch as Tony’s eyes flashed violet and he was snared in Kilgrave’s control. Tony lifelessly lifting a gun to his own head had Steve taking his earpieces out, and that was that. Over the intervening hours, they’d been forced to fight their own teammates, and help a very annoyed Kilgrave escape the city. Neither of them had slept in at least forty hours, and putting Tony back into the suit would be a definite risk.
The wolf let her tongue lull out. “Obviously.” She turned and trotted off into the woods. “He’ll catch up. Cats have a good sense of direction.”
In the air above them, War Machine broke off from Iron Man’s side and curved away from the gaping hole in the sky, jerking and twisting as Rhodey tried to regain control of the armor. He would eventually – it was only ever meant to be used in case of emergency, in the event that Rhodey became incapable of handling the controls himself and needed assistance to land. It was never meant to stand up to the concerted effort of the pilot to resist.
He managed to get the bag open at last, and found the kitten pressed all the way to the back of it. She trembled so hard that it looked painful, and smelled distinctly of urine.
The wolf considered them for several long moments while Tony made a long series of low-pitched cat noises. Steve had no doubt that Tony was taking advantage of their differing languages to give Steve a thorough tongue lashing. He thought about telling Tony to stuff it, but he couldn’t exactly throw stones.
hit Steve before he’d even opened his eyes, but he wasn’t sure why. He breathed slowly and tried to work it out, but there were a lot of things that were immediately – though subtly – off. He was in a hospital bed. Easy enough to recognize from all the time he’d spent there as a kid, but the bed was long enough for him to be stretched out completely flat. He hadn’t been able to lay flat in a bed without his feet hanging off the end since before the serum.
No less happy to be flying through the air, Clint put the wind to his back and ran full-tilt with it pushing him along. He just barely made it over the larger pool, and then caught a lamp-post to change his direction. Tony managed a smile and with his rolling eyes, and turned his attention back to Steve. He had both feet firmly planted and his shield out in front of him, but the wind was steadily pushing him backwards. Another dozen yards, and he would be tumbling into the blackness.
Tony shoved a hand through his hair and pulled hard. “How the fuck did we get like this? We’ve been friends for more than a decade, we’ve fought together. We used to
It had been a very long time since he’d felt so untethered. He would have thought that he knew what it felt like to be tired, but something about being in this new, compact body made him feel exhausted like never he’d never been before. The desire to find some place warm and safe so he could go to sleep was as strong as any urge to drink ever had been.
Steve didn’t realize he’d squeezed his eyes shut until they cracked open. A full-body convulsion nearly threw him out of the chair. His knee thumped up against the leg of the table and the table jerked marginally to the side.
Steve winced. He straightened his spine in a fluid roll, his expression settling into something distant and cool. “I’m sorry. Obviously I’ve misread.”
, maybe in English, or German, but to Tony it just sounded like a babble of angry sounds. He hissed at the man, who took no notice of him.
In the Technology Era, Tony did not understand why he spent 70% of his time doing paperwork, on paper, with a pen. He dropped the pen, and picked up his coffee. The coffee was cold and sour, just like it had been the last time he’d tried to drink it, and the time before that, and the time before that. He had a brief urge to throw the coffee mug out the window, but he took a slow breath and set it down instead. The chair squeaked as he dropped backwards, and he rubbed at his face with both hands.
Tony threw up a paw and fired a repulsor blast (blue, cold and bright) into the rat’s face. The strange blanket that had wrapped around his mind vanished. Tony let out a deep growl that ratcheted up into a hiss, and launched himself at the rat’s throat.
Steve suggested sarcastically, but he flopped onto his back and held still so Tony could get to his belt.
While they watched the reunion, other animals came out of their houses. Dozens of tiny baby mice spilled onto the street to swarm around the returning adults, cats hopped down from homes up the tree trunks, more dogs appeared through openings in the larger houses. To Steve’s astonishment, the last to join the party was a giant kangaroo with a heavy necklace resting on his chest. It was the first sign of adornment he’d seen on any of the animals they’d encountered.
He felt Steve’s faint shudder and loosened his grip. Steve didn’t immediately pull away from him, but he hung his head and breathed slowly through his nose. “Were you… You and – him? Were you?”
Muscles going tight, Tony waited until the rat was directly underneath him, and then pounced. He dropped into the thick carpet of dry leaves to the rat’s left, and took a swipe at him. The rat hissed in obvious surprise, dropped the bag, and ran. Tony’s claws dug into the dirt in an instinctive reaction to give chase, but a terrified cry from the bag brought him up short. He reseathed his claws, and moved over to investigate the bag.
Shouting wordlessly, Tony launched into the air. He landed more-or-less on the wolf’s back, just barely aware of his claws extending through his armor to dig into her thick fur. He scrabbled at her ribs with his back claws for purchase and bit into the back of her neck. Her fur was coarse and like biting into a high pile carpet.
He looked up slowly. His eyes were rimmed with red to match the flush in his cheeks. “I almost killed you, and you can’t remember it.” His lips, swollen and moist, curved upward in a parody of a smile that came dangerously close to being manic. “I can’t forget. Where the hell does that leave us, Tony?”
? Tony asked in a whisper as the throng of animals gradually surrounded them. None of them spoke, but they all gave Steve and Tony curious looks.
Not convinced, the captain helped him to his feet. “Get below decks,” he suggested, “It’s slick up here.”
Tony’s laughter calmed down to snorts and convulsions. He shifted his weight with the notion of putting his back to the pillar, but his abs and ribs all screamed that staying on the floor was a better idea. He decided to listen. “You know…not that I think hell is real, but who am I to say, given the situation at hand? Still, I had always thought that physical torture would be too mundane for a realm actually dedicated to punishment, so what’s it gonna be? Tell me I’m not really Antonio Stark? Drudge up my old nightmare of the mental institution? Is Greg waiting in the wings to step in? I think I’d
“But not tonight,” Tony decided, pulling his hand away and wiping his sticky fingers on the bedspread. Steve made a sound of pure mourning, not exactly a keen, but almost a sob. The truth was that Tony was tired, mellowed by the whiskey, and his knees were burning slightly under him. If there was another night, he would be better prepared, ready to spend hours taking Steve Rogers apart, but not after the day he’d had. He squeezed most of what remained in the tube into his hand and slicked himself roughly, and then gave himself another few pulls when the sound made Steve groan and push closer to him. An interesting reaction for another evening.
Tony huffed out an annoyed breath, and Steve repressed a yipping laugh of his own. Tony might be even smaller, comparatively, than he usually was, but Steve didn’t really want to go up against him when he was so wound up. Tony had always been so cool under pressure, that all the growing and hissing was new and delightful. He got the distinct impression that the wolf was fascinated by Tony and trying to get him away from Steve’s side.
he screamed, his voice going shrill in an effort to rise over the hum of the engine, the whip of the wind, and the splash of the icy water against the boat. They were racing over water the color of a cold corpse, arrowing toward a landscape of ice and snow. The sun hit the ice and turned it a shade of white-gold that he couldn’t quite describe. Even through the tinted goggles, it made his eyes sting.
, and hopped down to the ground. He padded past Riverstones, who said nothing about their behavior, and then waited at the top of the bank for them to catch up.
“You’ve pulled through worse, Tony,” Rhodey said. His voice was too soft for Tony to hear over the shriek of the wind, but he heard it as if they were alone in a silent room. “You can do this.”
“Where’s St-… Captain America? Where is he?” Tony asked, more than half dreading being told that it was all a dream, that he’d missed the expedition and they hadn’t found anything anyways.
“Doesn’t stop you from having an Opinion,” Tony muttered, but he didn’t wait for Steve to respond. With a long sigh, he stepped forward and pushed open the Medbay door.
Stopping, the wolf turned to look at him. She tilted her head, and then tried the name out. “Stee-b. How odd. My name is Gray Walker of Dusk Woods. You may call me Walker.”
The dog shifted in an apparently futile attempt to get up, and Tony realized that it didn’t have dark, strangely striped fur. It was wearing a shirt with alternating dark and light stripes on the lower hem. Tony bounded out of the grass and ran across the clearing.
Only once Kilgrave was thoroughly bound and under anesthesia did Clint deactivate the sonic device attached to an arrow partially embedded in the table. He must have shot it through the skylight and then repelled in after it. As a safety measure, they kept the headphones on while Kilgrave was loaded into a sound-proofed box in the back of a reinforced semi-truck. Rhodey locked it and then flicked his faceplate up. Steve gratefully pulled the headphones off, though he left them down around his neck.
A scream echoed behind him, and Steve was moving before he’d even consciously registered the sound. He twisted with the shield up to protect his head and saw half a dozen of the curious onlookers scrambling away from the opposite sidewalk. Another puddle of blackness spread quickly away from the gutter and into the street. As Steve watched, the darkness swallowed up a mailbox. It fell as quickly and silently as the rock had earlier.
Tony guided Steve’s hips into his lap, lined himself up by feel, and pressed into the welcome heat. Steve wrapped his legs around Tony’s back and pulled insistently, huffing out his breath in short, fast pants that sounded a whole heck of a lot like
. He shifted automatically to stand, but resettled his weight. “Not this time,” he said unhappily. “Too much to do. Eat some eggrolls for me.”
Most of it landed all over Thor, who just started eating the pieces out of his lap with a good-natured smile. He brandished the hammer suddenly at the television. “Have a care, maiden!” he shouted, startling Sam out of a light doze and making Clint burst into laughter.
have spent the run thinking of a plan. He shouldn’t have done any running at all. He shouldn’t have stubbornly stayed on the wrong side of that portal for so long, sure that someone or something was trying to achieve exactly that, and not wanting to be off-footed.
The silverware clicked loudly as Herr Stark adjusted his food meticulously. As if he weren't going to mess it all up again by eating. When he dragged his fork over the surface of his plate, the china squealing in protest, Steve lost his carefully constructed patience.
“Speak for yourself Striker. We need to come down harder on these rebel roaches and their allies. We can’t afford another attack like the one on Dachau!”
He startled at a crack of thunder. In the room the children’s voices rose even louder as if they were trying to drown out the storm. And suddenly anger welled up within him, swift and forceful.
Tony couldn’t help but look at him once more, sure that his eyes betrayed the same softness as that woman’s had as they drank Stefen in. He knew what he wanted, and he knew it was an impossible foolish dream, and yet he could not shake the hope.
He scooted back, gesturing with one hand and Maria sniffed but eagerly crawled forward out of the dusty space. Artur followed behind her, a confused frown on his face.  He looked like he wanted to ask Tony what he'd meant even though he'd warned them not to say anything. He didn't understand Italian as well as she did. Maria caught his eye just as he opened his mouth and shook her head, pressing her finger to her lips.
Magda had thrown as much junk as she could get her hands on into the trunk bed surrounding the crates, anything that might provide a bit of cover as they traveled. She’d given Steve an apologetic look when she’d opened the large crate and gestured for him to climb inside.
Finally, the sound of clicking heels approached and Steve promptly stood up, ready to greet Baroness Schrader as she made her way toward him. And it was indeed the Baroness who had come to greet him that afternoon, in all her refined elegance and a politely aloof expression. There was little of the woman that Steve had come to think of as a friend and confidant on her face as she smiled at him. Not that he’d expected any different.
A short man with curling hair was behind the counter, he looked up at the tinkle of the bell when they entered, and his eyes lit up in recognition.
“Can Cameron come too?! He’s never been to the festival either," Artur asked sweetly and Tony shook his head regretfully.
The captain was not always the most attentive of beaus, but lately he’d shown a certain earnestness towards her that Charlotte had come to enjoy. It’s noticeable absence that evening was irksome.
James was very enthusiastic. Perhaps a little too much, Tony thought. A fierce glow had entered his eyes and though he missed six times out of ten Tony was sure that wouldn't last long. Not with his fervor. The boy could barely contain his excitement. He’d be begging Tony to allow them to go shooting every day of the week from now on.
“It’s too salty,” James whined petulantly.  Tony suggested that he think of it as a stepping stone toward all the sweet things he would eat when they got to London. James did not look entirely convinced, but he did pick up a very small section and begin to nibble on it.
Anyone who thought that Niklas Farkas was just an ordinary monk concerned with charity and prayers obviously had never met the fellow.  He was a Hungarian born on the wrong side of African heritage and no wealth to make up for either his ethnic or economical short comings. He had made his way from the farmers fields to the battlefields as a young man and from there, inexplicably into the church.  It had never been a friendly world for people of his sort and it had been downright hostile since the end of the Great War, yet there he stood in the center of one of the oldest churches in the once great Austro-Hungarian Empire still playing the game of kings from the shadows. Antony had heard his father once tell a colleague that Nik had the ear of God and the perfume of monarchs lingering in his pews.
He wasn't sure if his ribs could take sitting down but was nearly just as sure he couldn't stand much longer.
Stark men were made of iron and he was the best built of them all. Still as Tony struggled and the gates finally sprang open with a groan and a horrible creek he couldn't help but think it an omen.
The way forward was clear. He had to marry Charlotte and give them her protection when their father died a traitor and all of his assets were seized. Her family was loyal to the Reich, or at least kept up that appearance better than he did. He doubted they would, but even if the Reich did go so far as to try and seize her assets too, the house in Switzerland would be untouchable and there was money there tucked away in case of emergency. Charlotte was clever and cunning and knew how to survive in a world that wasn’t kind. She was a good friend, and the children were her kin even without the marriage. He trusted her to see they stayed safe when he could no longer be there.
Tony’s heart leaped into his throat with fright as a horn blared outside. Before he knew what was happening Stefen had stepped in front of him, pushing him backward with one unyielding hand against his chest, the other already drawing his pistol.
Rogers coughed again, a grumbling wet sound rattling his lungs that drew Dvorak's gaze back in time to see the man grasping weekly at the woman's wrist. He garbled something low through the wheezing in his chest that Dvorak failed to catch but it sounded horribly like pleading. Rogers was looking at his fiancé with exhaustion written all over his skin.  An exhaustion so deep it could only lead to the sleep of the dead.
“Here! Now hurry up man, before we lose our lives in this godforsaken place!” he shoved the documents in the man’s face before his companion dutifully snatched them from Tony’s hand.
“You told me I couldn’t say her name.” Péter challenged stiffly from the bed, voice going tight. Beside him Ian tensed, as if he were afraid of what Steve might do and Steve’s chest ached. He pinched the bridge of his nose, fighting for another deep breath.
He was finally given some respite when the train reached the bustling station in Nuremburg and a flush of new passengers trickled into the dining car. Among them was a young woman, traveling alone and very obviously nervous about it. She kept casting her eyes about uncertainly as she glanced at her ticket, as if she was not sure she was in the right place or which seat to take. Her hair was a pretty shade of red and Tony found himself smiling indulgently at her when she caught his eye. A curious pang of longing filled him, and he wondered suddenly what Natacha was doing. Good god, he'd only been away for a few hours, he berated himself. Surely, he was stronger than this?
Had he reopened a wound? Steve wondered, his gut clenching. The cut on his scalp had bled a lot, but then again, all head wounds did at first.
Tony's relatives live near the Forum Square which has been the central town square of the city since the Roman times.
A lightning bolt of panic, relief, and sizzling adrenaline shot through Steve all at once as the blurry image came into greater focus and he jerked from the force of it. His muscles screamed as he forced them to work, scrambling with twitching fingers to grasp Péter’s shoulders and haul him into his arms before he could disappear again. He half expected him to dissolve at the first touch as so many other visions had, but Péter was solid against him.  Péter had come awake in an instant, confusion and alarm blurring his sleepy features, but Steve didn't care because his hands had gotten ahold of Péters shirt, a hold of Péter and Péter hadn't disappeared.
The knife in her hand had become a sinister weight, like holding the tail of a snake. She wanted to hurl the horrible thing away, to curl into a ball and cry for her father (for her mother) but she couldn’t let go of it. Mother was dead and very soon, her father might be too. She must be strong.
Though he turned his head, it wasn’t quick enough to hide the stricken look in his eyes and Steve blinked in surprise, completely taken aback. Tony was practically vibrating where he sat, but he stayed completely still waiting for Steve to finish what he’d started. Waiting for Steve to order him from the house, still as a hare avoiding the hunters gaze. But that was Tony. Even terrified he was brave. Braver, Steve thought, than anyone he’d ever met. Because he didn’t let it rest. Maybe couldn’t. Tony blinked back what seemed impossibly like the threat of tears and had his last word.
Or so they said. Tony did not know what to make of Rogers but he was getting the inkling that the captain whatever his political affiliations wasn’t the sort to do the expected. The young man in the photo was everything the stories said he was except for eighteen. Tony didn’t know how anyone could miss it. The serious thin faced
Bucky turned over with a groan and sat up, his stomach lurching with the movement. He caught sight of a fat metal flask on the desk and paused, frowning at it. But then, fuzzily he remembered getting his smokes from Stevie the night before. Stevie had urged him to be careful and then Bucky had left. Only, Natacha had run after him. She said she had something for him.
“Yes?” Nik inquired dryly, not really wishing to know what Tony had done this time but suspecting that it likely involved the monastery’s treasury. He could already feel the beginnings of a headache.
There was a feeling of magic surrounding them both as pictures Peggy Rogers had taken in her last year of life slowly came into being. Péter's mother appeared to have no liking for the sober poses that were popular for the day. A blurred image of Natacha, hanging from a tree in the garden by her knees, still managed to capture her wide smile and the missing tooth in the front of her mouth. He and Péter both laughed out loud when they saw it. It was a revelation to realize that the unfamiliar woman rocking a very young James in another photo was Péter’s grandmother, and he had to swallow back a ball of emotion as a picture of the entire family appeared. One of the staff must have taken it because Stefen was sitting on a picnic blanket, his mother on one side and Peggy on the other, the children spread across their laps. Smiles on all their faces and the lake at their back.
“How is Risteard?” He asked out of politeness, struggling for a moment to remember her reclusive husband’s proper name. Steve had only met the man in person the once. Risteard “Ret” Richter was not what anyone would call a social animal. He was one of those scholars that people called an intellectual when they were being polite, and a massive bore as soon as his back was turned. When he couldn’t be found in a lecture hall at the university he was likely to be found buried in research. Tony would probably like him.
As if the man could read his mind he leaned forward, wincing in pain, before introducing himself with a fleeting smile. “Fiedor. Noah Fiedor.”
"You look like you”. He’d finally admonished himself and got on with it. It was a simple matter of science really and required that sort of perspective. A face was nothing more than a composition of scrambled traits.
“Of course!” Steve cut him off, the sharpness of it surprising even him. He just needed the man to stop talking. He didn’t want to hear how Nina Kroger was innocent and not ready for the demands of the Reich like his children supposedly were. Like James, who despite every insistence that he was not a baby like Artur, still couldn’t sleep without his brothers. Or like Péter who’d come home with eyes blackened so often Steve had sent him to Switzerland just to be sure he’d make it through the year. Or Natacha, who was only twelve but might as well have been a cow for how they inspected her teeth and measured her waist and declared her prime stock.
“Tony, where’s Frau Hogan? Why didn’t she make dinner?” Péter asked, concerned by the housekeeper's absence but Tony shot him a warning look, darting his eyes poignantly toward their unwanted dinner companions.
"You smell like smoke." Natacha pointed out, quiet and low, one pale hand gripping his coat sleeve, her blue eyes fraught with worry.
“I’d disappoint you.” Steve replied tersely and judgmental silence stretched over the hall once more. Göring stared coldly at him and Steve knew he’d pay for it later but he was past caring.
When they finally parted, foreheads still pressed together while catching their breaths, Steve simply realized he was doomed.
Something didn´t feel right. Those people weren´t moving, weren´t panicking in search for an exit or phone, instead they were unnaturally still. There were two women sitting on the ground, looking helpless and scared, but still they did nothing. The man standing above them slowly turned his head in Steve´s direction maybe only accidently, because Steve wasn´t even breathing at the moment, and suddenly they both knew.
“Please, just tonight. You remember that story? A Thousand and One Nights? I told you about it once.”
“I see. Sorry. I just thought… Never mind. It smells delicious.” He grabbed the fork. “How did you hurt it by the way? Was it today?” Please, let it not be today. Steve felt horrible enough for the list of injuries he knew about.
They were back on each other sooner than Clint had the time to close after him and they both heard his laugh as he was leaving.
“Wow, better no one heard that, Legolas, taxpayers would be devasted by your pyrotechnic suggestion.”
Without having anything clever to say, Steve unpacked the first aid and started to work quietly on Tony´s side, fishing for any reaction that he was causing him more pain than he was already in.
“Tony?” he tried again, this time louder, forcefully drawing his thoughts back to the present. He looked around the room pulling the blanket away and crawling out of the warm bed. The bathroom door was closed and looked like there was no one inside, so Steve walked past it into the kitchen.
“What?” Steve asked, disbelief clear in his voice. They tried so hard to keep Tony´s identity hidden.
Steve didn´t mention how much time it took him to persuade Tony that they can and will keep it a secret and what was more important they won´t think any lees of him because of it. How could they? The only thing he proved was that he was a fighter, a survivor.
“Is your story over?” Another voice carried itself from the doors, and Tony looked back to give his husband a fond smile.
“Why is it that I have to be always silent, but Iron man can talk all the time?” Clint complained. “By the way, SHIELD has just finished clearing the path, so it´s only you two and those three civilians. Captain is right, Iron man, if you can´t deactivate the bomb, let it blow.”
“No, it was a week ago. You remember Hulk falling into the river and me trying to pull him back to the shore?”
He leaned in for a kiss and when he received one, he moved on Tony´s cheek mapping his way through the strong jaw.
“Dummy wanted to poison me, you know? Again. If I once don´t turn in you will know who is responsible…”
There was certain amount of angry shouting during which Tony had to put the cell phone away from his ear and Steve chuckled.
“They have to be freaking out,” he said and relaxed in the warm bed, spreading his muscular arms back behind his head. Steve stilled for a second before he remembered what he was supposed to do.
The man moved next to him. Steve realized he probably wanted to sit up, so he helped. The blanket slid away from his chest and the blue light emerged again, only now it was suppressed by the hand resting over the metal surface.
“No, Steve. It’s okay. Really. You see? I’m good. Do I look like I’m crazy? Or that I need saving? No… I’m fine. Really, I am. I chose this.”
The morning however came too soon. Steve didn´t want to fall asleep because he knew that Tony will leave him before the sun would reach them. Still it was impossible to resist the sleeping when he had him in his embrace, pressed together from head to toe.
He followed Tony out of the room. He was moving like in the dream, eyeing Tony´s back in the tight tuxedo jacket, thinking that he would probably lose his way if he allowed himself to blink.
“Stop it, captain. I´m coming for you no matter what you say. You may at least try to jump, so I won´t have to go and search for you in the falling concrete.”
He met Tony halfway on his journey through the room. They stopped in front of each other, Tony simply outstretching his hand, and in that moment Steve’s heart jumped up and down with the same hope he’d felt before.
“No.” And it was the truth. Steve tried his damn best not to. “Not when I know it´s important to you.”
“Jarvis…” Steve tried to remember, “is it the one Jarvis you are talking to during the missions? Is it your…”
Okay, so that was disturbing thought. At the moment they were like 50 feet from the ground. Steve didn´t even allow himself to look there, although this wasn´t the first time he flew with him. And maybe he was joking or maybe not, but he certainly knew how to prove he belonged in the sky.
The bed was still warm. Steve could smell the man everywhere. On the sheets. On the pillows. On himself. He decided he didn´t need to get up for few more hours, enjoying fresh memories buried in his head and around him.
My first story I´ve managed to finish! :P Thank you all for being here, supporting me, giving me the energy to continue and motivation to get better. I hope you are satisfied with the ending. I will be very, very happy for any response from you. :) Would you like another story with secret identities? Let me know!
“Stark is strong, but he is not invincible. His mind is… rather damaged, I guess you noticed,” he started.
After a moment of silence and intense starring match Tony folded his hands on his chest and threw himself back in the bed, wincing a bit.
Steve smiled. “You have nice cheekbones, not very prominent, and strong jaw, and mustache, it always tickles me.”
“Thank you,” he replied, unsure of how to react to the sincerity in Tony’s voice. This was the longest sentence he’d got out of Tony since Thanos.
There was a big bed right in front of him and a small table with a lamp, a pile of clothes on the armchair and two doors, no windows. One was locked, what Steve quite expected, the other one led him to the nice bathroom, where he took a long enough shower to forget on the burning and exploding buildings at least for now.
“Oh, that…” Tony looked at his hand and then back on Steve. The armor was beginning from behind his elbow and ending under his knuckles, it would give him a right amount of strength for a punch or defense strike.
“Yes, we could say it was like a spell. Bad spell which made me forget some very happy moments with your Daddy.”
His team always knew how to avoid the contact with other people, but Steve was almost constantly caught in that or other circle of over-enthusiastic rich people trying to wrestle something they could gossip about out of him. It was uncomfortable and soon Steve found himself shutting the voices completely, daydreaming about what will follow later in the night. He had to stop in fear he would make himself blush or worse.
Steve tried to keep check of Iron man´s position in the room. He had the feeling that he was walking towards the door.
“No,” Tony shook his head. “I´m feeling alright, Steve, you´ve done enough. I will call you tomorrow.”
So they met. They took a walk in the park during the night, Tony with hoodie big and awkward enough to hide his face with a help of the spreading darkness around them. They talked and they laughed and Steve might told him about his slowly adjusting to… well everything. Tony listened patiently and remembered every word. Steve knew, because when a month later he decided to buy a place of his own, the gift was there, waiting on his new bed in his new flat. And it was a drawing set. The only hobby which gave him peace in the past and was doing it also in presence. Tony knew, because he listened.
All in all, Steve didn’t need to have any memories to know that he would have fallen in love with Tony Stark in each and every future there is.
“Self… destructed,” he said and Steve nodded. His heart finally calmed down from the insane rhythm it took while searching for the man. No suit meant no cover before Steve´s eyes. Now he fully realized that once again only thing which stood between him and Tony´s face was darkness in the room and his choice not to switch on any light.
And suddenly the cheerful atmosphere was gone. Steve didn´t want to see the pity on the faces of his teammates. The truth was that in theory he could sculpt the man´s face based only on all of the touches and mouth exploring. But they had to be all aware of the fact that Steve was never going to admit it.
A sweet delighted chuckle made Tony look down at the little one tucked in the bed and smiling at him.
“I appreciate you´re trying to be quiet, but it´s not working, gorgeous.” Tony´s amused voice hit his ears and he smiled, bringing the water closer to his patient. After he had some liquids inside, Steve put the glass away on the nightstand, laying down again and playing with Tony´s hair.
“Some were disturbing, some were quite enlightening,” he continued, “he said that I gave up the time stone to save his life because I knew he would save us all in the end. I couldn’t believe that at first, but it had to be true.”
It was quite simple. After he´d heard the man speak to him and felt his lips on his, everything had to become too real for him.
“Ah,” Tony nodded, dots connecting in his mind rather quickly, “but those aren’t really stories, dear,” he tried to explain.
Steve nodded enthusiastically. With the help of Cloak he pulled Tony into the warm room. Maybe Tony’s room. He wasn’t sure. Further from the roof the better.
“No, I can´t,” Steve insisted, “I won´t ever imagine your face, I swear, please. I don´t want you to leave.”
Still, it had been only few weeks, barely a month, so no one felt the need to really start pushing. Therefore, Steve didn’t even dared to hope that Tony would appear in the gala tonight but causing the shock for everyone present, he did. He was wearing a fine fitting suit when he entered the room - immediately followed by stares and gasps from every side. The suit outlined his body perfectly as per usual. The nano-technology wasn’t visible beneath it, but Steve knew it was there.
“I didn’t plan it for today. It just happened,” he said to the infinite depth in front of him, “I was too obvious. It won’t happen next time.”
“Mor´… less,” he murmured back, some of his usual self seeping into the tired voice. In any other circumstances it would make Steve smile. But now all he did was telling Natasha to wait while he took the stairs five at the time almost jumping between the floors, running straight from the building towards the slumped man in the street.
And maybe there were some dead threats uttered between that reply until Tony cancelled the call, but neither Steve nor Tony commented on it.
It was funny when one day Steve realized how many things he kept in his place just for the sake of their late night´s visits. Things he knew Tony liked. Like whiskey for example – something what Steve wouldn´t drink himself not even under the torture. But on the other hand the glass of that gold liquid suited Tony. It was nice to watch it moving in the glass along with his hand when he was trying to explain something. It suited his voice which now Steve knew better than his own. All the special tones he used when speaking about people who were dear to him, people without names. All the shades of excitement and curiosity when he was talking about his techs, than anger and hatred towards people he were fighting. All the small chuckles and smiles.
The desperate look on Tony’s face was the last thing Steve needed to see to let his hands gently grab the engineer by his arms.
“It´s good,” he started to nod approvingly and lifted his eyes again towards the man on the other side of the table. After that he sighed.
And like that Steve forced himself to let Tony go, to let him grab a functional suit and fly him back home, to the base. Because there was no other way. Because Steve´s life won´t be ever easy. Because Steve will always be Captain America first and then Steve Rogers - blindfolded kissing his enemy.
Steve´s brows went up when the word “we” was uttered, but it probably remained unnoticed. He liked that word a lot, more so when it came from the guy.
“What the hell are you doing, Steve?” The accusation was cold like a slap across the cheek. Clint was looking at both of them, taking in what he was seeing and what it meant and Steve had to remind himself that the archer had no idea who Tony was.
Steve was slowly opening his mouth to announce his presence, when in fact he suddenly froze in the mid-step, his body overpowering his mind by pure instinct.
“But I wanted to,” Steve disagreed. “When someone asks how long we are together, you say six years, I say three… now when I know all what you remember I can say six as well,” Steve chuckled.
And there were indeed a lot of things Tony wanted and allowed Steve to do to him and vice versa. Despite they had only one night, they took their time, exploring, learning about each other preferences, learning about what was the right impulse for their bodies to react in the certain way.
Steve woke up with a painful groan involuntary escaping his dry lips, dizzy and disoriented in complete darkness with his head throbbing and with a sharp pain in one of his shoulders he felt like on the verge of very bad panic attack. All he could think about was ice and cold and ice and hydra and… yes, definitely feeling someone´s hand touching his right leg.
Steve’s brain was a fuzz. His blood was freezing with a new revelation which haven’t truly reached his mind yet. Oh my god.
“What do you really want, Tony?” he didn´t want to say that aloud, but it was already out and he was really curious about the answer. “I mean, don´t take me wrong, I like this,” he indicated the place around himself, “but nothing changed on our situation. You are still… we are…”
“Stay for the night.” Steve realized it was his voice and him pleading to Tony´s ear, whispering the words he couldn´t imagine to tell anyone else.
Still, he was disappointed when he woke up alone, but the piece of paper on the nightstand made him smile.
Steve let the one on the neck stay where it was and with other one he aimed first down, his imagination running 200%. He mapped the strong jaw and nice full lips with the gentle brush of his fingers, continuing up back to the cheek, to the temple, missing the eyes which Steve had the feeling were closed from the beginning. Then he went for hair, brushing through the curls once and then he did the route again, this time stopping shortly to feel the air escaping through parted lips on his skin. The man was breathtakingly beautiful.
“Everything will be ready in 20 minutes, sir. But I´m afraid that chicken in the oven needs your attention immediately.”
“I know I failed you and I regret it. I also know it can’t just go to how things were before, but still… I’m here Tony,” Steve said, “if you decide you can accept me in your life again, I will do anything to deserve your trust.”
So Steve let him. He knew he won´t follow into the peaceful slumber anytime soon. He had too much energy flowing in his veins from everything that happened.
Steve didn´t want to be angry or hurt, but he couldn´t help some of those emotions to slip into his tone.
“Give me one night.” And maybe I will make it a thousand. “Please, if what you’re saying is true, let me have at least this.”
“You know you don´t need that around me. You saved me, I´m not going to hurt you.” I wouldn´t hurt you even without the saving part.
Natasha hushed him immediately with a frown, but it was too late for Steve´s grin already formed on his lips. He had to look like a teenager drooling over his crush while recalling the strong body under his hands, the perfect bright eyes and a smile he would kill for… he stopped the track of his thoughts before they could end up somewhere more south.
“Jarvis is saying it´s this big building with that ugly duck face logo. There are three people on the 16th floor, do you want a ride, captain?”
Steve encouraged Tony to move even closer and he let one of his hands encircle Iron man´s shoulders to keep him pressed against his chest. Their eyes stayed on the wall in front of them with Tony murmuring something from time to time. It was hard to understand the cryptic words or whether they were meant for Steve or… the other thing/person he was seeing.
Instead of post battle sharp silence they would be half snickering on his stupid puns and SHIELD aimed insults. He would be a great reinforcement to the team. Maybe even a great friend to have. But none of that was really possible, was it?
Steve nodded. “That sounds more like what I would do, Tony, and you know that. It sounds about right that Tony Stark made someone fall in love with him at the end of the world.”
“Of course,” Tony laughed, stroking a thumb over Steve´s neck. “Even if I have to kidnap you again.”
Tony was quick into taking a hint of what Steve wanted to do. Steve hushed all of his protests afterwards.
They fell asleep in each other’s arms both of them remembering all the memories Tony had shared with Steve until now. The life they had here was even more magic than the one Tony had lived through.
Steve nodded. “We need to find another way.” Steve gazed into the starry night and jumped a bit when he felt a gentle touch on his hand.
“I know how it looks to you, but I thought it through. It’s not a harsh decision made in the haze. I don’t belong here. I just need to fix it like I fixed everything else.”
There was a brief pause on the other side during which Steve called out Tony´s name few times in panic.
Steve´s eyes followed the path to Tony´s long beautiful neck which was the last thing he could see before his eyes would fill with tears from the bright light of the lamp. His face had to be turned away from Steve.
“Steve, I have a fucking heart condition and I didn´t want you to know because I didn´t want you to see me as an asset. A cripple behind the iron.”
“I would like to touch your face. But I know that it´s stupid. It´s not like I could be able to make a portrait after that. I draw but I ´m not that good, but it´s a stupid idea. It´s just that I hate I can´t see you…”
“They are the memories of Daddy and me that I, unfortunately, forgot,” he explained slowly, “Daddy tells me every night something new so I could have the memories back.”
Steve started pacing around the room, listening for any signs that Tony was in trouble and needed to have him on his feet immediately.
Steve´s eyes closed down, maybe just for a second and he stumbled. An explosion was heard behind him and he expected to be hit. Soon he really was, but it didn´t hurt as bad as he thought.
“I assume,” Strange went on, “that during that time he was only able to choose and remain on the right path with a help of a very close person.”
“Because you don’t mean it.” Tony sighed. His eyes full of longing and affection. “You are doing the same thing now. You are willing to start something with me only because I was on that damn ledge 5 minutes ago. I should have never told you about this.”
“It´ 10:24, cap,” he said, turning on Steve with a spark in his knowing eyes. Clint knew everything. He always did.
Talking to cameras. Watching his every move and word in front of all those lurking reporters, who were officially allowed to show on the gala, and therefore, make his life miserable. At least for few more hours until he could vanish and have a long, long shower and even longer sleep in the clean sheets.
Tony and Steve departed to their own bedroom where they shed their clothes off and cuddled together under the warm blanket. Tony purred when Steve snuggled to him and put a hand over his hips.
It was like if everything was happening in a slow motion. Tony turned away, and Steve still couldn’t draw in a proper breath.
Tony wasn’t looking at him when he spoke up with a weak and wavering voice. He was swaying from side to side. The half empty bottle in his hand might have been the reason.
“You said it because you knew I needed to hear it in order to save the world. I told you about Strange sacrificing the stone and his life for me. Everyone knew it was me. The chosen one. We just didn’t know how. And I was so out of it when we returned to Earth. For a long time, I thought that everyone agreed it is you who need to pick up the broken pieces. And you did. You went with it for my sake and for the sake of humanity. You were everything I needed. And even if it wasn’t real, it was for me.” Tony was shaking or maybe Steve was. “And I lost it. I lost everything with the first snap, and then I lost everything again when I reversed it.”
Strange had spent a lot of time with Tony while he’d been recovering, he was one of the few doctors allowed to treat his injuries. Maybe partly because he’d been the first on the set when Tony had fallen to his knees, infinity stones glaring on his hand.
Steve marched towards the window with a view on the street in front of the building. There, in the shadow of the street lamp, he saw a figure leaning over the side of the nearby bench. Could be him. Or not.
Oookay, so the first chapter working as a prologue is already here cause I´m impatient as hell. :D Please leave me a comment if you want me to continue, because this is a creation of two sleepless nights and maybe I should really sleep instead of posting it here. PS: I reply to comments. :)
Steve´s head tossed up in the way of the unhappy voice. He met Bruce´ eyes feeling like his friend has just convicted him of some crime and slowly nodded.
Maybe so Steve wouldn´t have a heart attack right at the spot when he would see the guest´s face transforming into the face of the man he loved as he stepped from behind Fury and offered Steve a small innocent smile.
Steve had to recall one more time that no one had any idea who Tony was and that for some reason they were playing this game, so Steve went with it.
“Well, now I know you don´t remember our landing, because otherwise you wouldn´t have to ask.” Steve would swear he was smiling when he was saying that, but the reminder just made him feel all sick again.
Steve nodded. He remembered the story about hobbits very well because it was Tony’s choice and he’d loved the way the engineer had talked to him through the movie, energic and passionate.
“I don’t know how to live here. I’ve seen too much, done too much. But no one remembers beside me. And I can’t tell anyone because I would never want to give another person nightmares to live with.”
“Yeah, I know. It´s okey to tell him anything you are alright with. He probably knows I have a crush on you. You can tell him I was trying something, but you had no interest or whatever you like, captain.”
“So no more a villain? Ready to become a hero?” And that was a stupid question, because in Steve´s guidebook Tony was already a hero.
They didn’t wait for an answer knowing too well that Morgan was already asleep. She was a fast sleeper just like her Papa.
“Nat, please, you have to find Tony.” He cursed. “You have to find Iron man. Something´s wrong with him. He´s calling me right now. Track the signal.”
“Well, you kinda was,” Steve said apologetically, taking one of Tony´s wrists in his hand inspecting the bruises forming there. “I should have been more gentle.”
Steve´s heart shattered a bit when the man let out another painful sound mixed with helplessness and resignation. He didn´t ask again and Tony didn´t stop him this time. He cut the T-shirt away from the wound, at the same time revealing the Iron man´s core implemented into Tony´s chest right in the middle, with many, many scars running every possible way. Steve contained himself before he could gasp aloud. Another source of soft blue light filled the room when it was no more covered by a thick fabric.
“How…” he started, but lost his next words immediately. What did he wanted to ask really? How the fight ended? How did he save him? Why he didn´t wake up in the compound?
“I can´t deactivate this shit,” he sounded angry and irritated, “I will fly for you and let Clint take the blame.”
Okay, this didn’t sound good. Tony could block away people, but not his own AI, that screamed trouble.
When he returned the same evening into the compound to train and leave out some steam he found his team waiting on him, Bruce and Clint silently passing some money between them.
There were a few seconds of shouting on the other side of the phone and Steve could hear no more than the last question. Fury was asking if he was alright.
Steve pressed a small kiss somewhere on Tony´s face receiving a playful bite in return while he searched for the hem of Tony´s t-shirt. When he pulled the body under him stiffened and pair of hands grabbed him.
As soon as he had Tony´s attention back on him, he tried to make a serious expression suppressing the smile off his lips.
“It´s not just that…” the man tried to explain, but the words were clearly failing him. “It´s worse… I don´t want you to see it.”
This shorter chapter is for all of you who wished to read more about Tony and Steve's journey through their thousand and one nights together. Hope you like how things ended up for the boys. :)
“Yes, he is.” He gave everyone a steady look. A look which said: yes, I know I screwed up, but I can´t regret it.
Steve was stubborn, but maybe not so stubborn as Iron man was. And so he found himself climbing through the shattered glass right to the edge. Slowly he stood up.
And what could Steve do? He just smiled and agreed quietly, making a mental note to check up more forcefully on Iron man next time while the man was always claiming to be okay, but clearly that wasn´t the case.
Steve had apologized to the genius more than on one occasion, actually almost every time he’d got a chance. This small gesture of acceptance, of a possible new beginning, melted his heart.
“We could be backward about a lot of things, but I always liked that. No matter what you’d done, on Christmas your family was there to forgive you. Our elders used to say, when Roma stick together, neither hunger, poverty, nor evil can destroy them.” Stefen continued before his voice broke and he swallowed thickly before flashing Tony another weak smile. “But there is no forgiveness for those in exile. No
Rogers had shown up at his doorstep feigning camaraderie out of uniform neither of them had ever felt for the other, and armed with that damnable earnest voice of reason. If they did not act, things would get worse. People would suffer.
Stefen had answered with a grim note of finality. Any hope that Tony still had held that this was going to be an easy transition for the children bled away. This was going to be nothing but difficult. Nothing but dangerous. Somehow, they'd just have to manage.
Steve jerked awake, gasping for breath. Cold. He was numb with it. Weakly he struggled, but his arms, his arms... cold... snow... under…
“Where’s your brother?” Tony asked Natacha as she passed the sitting room door alone, on the route towards the stairs and the girl jumped in surprise. Normally Tony would have taken delight in giving her a scare for once but the blotches on her cheeks and red rimmed eyes told him an alarming tale of recent tears. Tony was out of his chair in an instant.  “What happened?!”
The captain had been a source of contention the past few days with all of them. Even Pepper seemed on edge at the mention of the children’s father.
“He is unconventional Brother Tiberius. It wouldn't be the first time he decided to do things his own way,” Fil reminded them all, as if Nik needed reminding.
Nothing, as it turned out. Though Tony was sure that Stefen meant to have words with his old friend if the sudden decision to pick the clothes up himself in the morning was anything to go by.
Yes, he was a good man Philips. The best Steve had ever served under. He’d stuck his neck out for Steve time and time again, and Steve had always returned the favor on the battlefield.
Hammer looked surprised to see Tony sitting down with the captain and his mouth turned down in disapproval. The ridiculous man had his nose so high in the air he was in danger of catching flies as he reached them and pointedly ignored Tony’s existence, extending the tray he carried on one arm with a single envelope in the center toward Bakhuizen.
Tony had a theory for a new energy source, though it felt old with how long it had sat within the pages of his journal. Like so many other things that precious little book was gone now, but not the ideas it had contained. Those lived in wait, within him.
“I’m going to remove the iron. You've hurt yourself.” He had. Somewhere in the distance his shoulders were throbbing and so were the joints at his wrists. There was a thin trail of dried blood trickling out from beneath the manacles and down his dirtied hands. It had stained his fingers along with the mud.
“Oh, I’ve done my job.” Bucky said unslinging his weapon and raking a hand through his dirty hair. His smile was cheeky though, a familiar glint of mischief in his eye that usually meant he’d charmed his way into some woman’s bed. Steve frowned down at the sketch he was making, wondering when Bucky had found the time. Just because they had a cover story didn’t mean they could afford to be sloppy. If he found out Bucky had ditched his patrol he’d have to yell at him. Brother or no brother there was no preferential treatment in this squad.
It was a window into another world for Tony, but for Péter it had to mean so much more. Tony laid a hand on his back and Péter sniffed wetly, wiping his arm across his eyes and smiled up at him.
Holmes didn’t wait for their reply as he laid his hand on a folder full of documents resting in front of him on the table and pushed it toward Stefen. The captain took it and opened it slowly.  Tony peered over his shoulder to get a look inside, uncaring that it was unmistakably marked classified. It was a mission debriefing for something called ‘Operation Thunder’. Tony snickered, and Stefen shot him a disapproving glare before resuming his careful perusal of the documents.
When they pulled up to the back of the Imperial Hotel Bucky grumbled something about theatrics. A hotel attendant met them at the service door, and if he thought there was anything odd about ushering in a pair of visitors through the staff quarters in the dead of night, his unflappable countenance didn’t show it.
Tony had his back to the door, padding on bare feet back toward his desk table. He pulled the chair out from the table with his foot, arranging it behind a tin washtub set on the floor and sitting down with a tired grunt. The low lamp illuminated his tired face, making the purple bruises around his face appear all the darker. He looked tired and unkempt, his trousers rolled up above his ankles, his legs spread wide and feet firmly planted. The medical kit was open beside him on the table. There was a discarded wash towel and butterfly bandages spread out as if he’d thrown them down in aggravation. As Steve approached him he noticed that the water in the tub was stained pink.
A rusty chuckle rumbled in his chest and Bucky dropped his head, relieved that even now after all these years they could fight like cats and dogs and still come out the other end.
He squeezed her hand and forced himself to rise out of the chair, his bones creaking in protest with every movement from sleeping in such an uncomfortable position. He tucked the pistol in his lap out of sight and motioned his head toward the fireplace.
“Stefen I hardly believed my eyes!” Steve’s eyes went a little wide with shock as the woman threw her arms around him, squeezing tightly. She seemed not to care that he was in uniform or that she’d all but abandoned her customer, a stout woman with graying hair clutching a covered basket (she looked nothing like Peggy).
"I aint going to argue with you about this.” Bucky barked back. “You step near that bed you better be prepared to get knocked on your ass."
“What if a lion eats us? I know they don’t live here, but there are some at the circus. I saw it on a poster.” He whispered anxiously, as if saying it aloud would increase the chances that a lion was about to come tearing out of the dark hallway to gobble them all up. “One could have escaped. Don’t you think?”
“They see you out and about with the kids they’re not going to let you keep them out of it anymore.” Bucky stated the obvious.
"Always do, don't I? Take your own advice Tony." Clint replied with a confidant smirk returning.  Squaring his shoulders, he turned and jerked his head toward Bucky and said, "That's if this one don't shoot himself in the eye before then. Can't aim for shit."
“It’s all right." the woman crooned tenderly, brushing the dark hair back from his sweat slick brow. "Just let them help you.”
“Tony?” Steve called down anxiously into the dark space. There was a second of delay that felt like a year before Tony stepped out of the dark and peered up at him, voice trembling with relief.
"I suppose you’re extra lucky then." Cameron replied, grinning fondly at James as he continued to quickly pack his things, conveniently distracting him from the fact that Ian was scowling darkly at them both from the corner.
“In one hundred and sixteen hours I will be leading a flotilla, comprised of four ships, into Norwegian waters. Our official goal, which the British public, as well as the Norwegian Parliament, will be made aware of, is to lay mines that will prevent the Germans from using that rout to receive crucial shipments of iron and ore.” Pike began, and Tony began to understand why Holmes hadn’t protested Tony looking at the file. Stefen proved he was no slouch in the brains department either, passing a bundle of papers held together by a clip to Tony without comment. It was a detailed report of the mining operation, their make, their manufacturer and how they were to be implemented.
It was like once he’d allowed himself to want it, to dream these things, there was no stopping it. The flood gates were open.
“It is never harmless to speak against the Reich, Gwen, and you know that. Don’t you think it’s curious that the rebels have not struck this area since your father sent her home?”
“I’ve never fared well with children. Let’s hope today proves to be the exception.” It wasn’t that Charlotte hated children, it was just that she’d never had any particular use for them. She was an only child herself with few cousins.
He suddenly felt like a heel, being so short with him. Was he being cruel? Or was he simply following his own father’s example expecting far too much from the young when he should know better? It bothered him to realize that he didn’t know when the distinction between the two had begun to blur.
“No one wishes to upset the good Captain, or to imply that he is at all involved in this, however it is a large house with many staff. There is a lot someone could miss in a house this size,” he said.
“No, I won’t. Someone must see to Father’s health and the family’s affairs. It is not fair to leave it all to the Baroness and I am his oldest child.” She recited somberly, and she didn’t even flinch at the way Vreni’s eyes misted when she thought what neither of them said aloud. Natacha was the oldest child
In all his years as a soldier Steve had seen and done many things. He had been transported on boats and trains, and even flown in small aircrafts before this, but nothing that could compare to the Warbird. Powered by four engines and crafted almost completely of metal it was hard not to be intimidated at first sight of the big metal bomber, larger than any other plane he had ever beheld up close.
“Oh there he is. Alex!” Bethany called out suddenly, lifting her arm to wave and catch the attention of a fair-haired man somewhere in his late twenties in polished shoes and a grey summer coat. The young man’s face split into a delighted grin and he began to fight the crowd in order to make his way towards her.
Péter shrugged, not bothering to answer. Natacha had always been better at taking control of the house than he had, warming eagerly to their responsibilities as the eldest.
Of course, the next shots were not aimed at Rogers but at himself, and he was a lone target without cover.
“I’ll make a fortune for both of us, selling yours.” Stefen mumbled sleepily, turning over in the bed to be able to look at Tony through heavy lidded eyes.
He turned his head, desperately seeking the captain’s mouth and buried the groan he couldn’t hold back against his lips. Tony kissed him with everything he had, his chest raw, the breath they shared between them too sweet and too little after so long feeling like he was slowly suffocating. They kissed, and they kissed, hungry and deep, until Stefen pulled away to catch his breath, chest pushing against Tony’s with every exhale. Tony let his trembling hands travel over Stefen’s back while he struggled to collect himself.
“We’ve been invited to brunch tomorrow by a good friend of mine, Baroness Shrader.” Stefen announced without breaking his gaze away from what was happening in the sitting room. “Did they bring anything suitable to wear?”
Péter was always up first, since his was the last watch. He’d turn on the radio and rouse Natacha and then Tony. It was a tossup which of them oversaw the preparation of breakfast, and who oversaw the waking and washing up of the younger children. There was no toilet inside the cabin, but there was a covered latrine in the back yard along with a hand pump. So, whoever drew the short straw had to make sure the little ones were bundled up and escort them one by one out to the latrine armed with the pistol.
“They boy took the money and journeyed to the fair where one could buy sheep, but as he was walking he encountered a crossroads. At this crossroad was a group of children, some just like him, some a bit older. They had caught a baby snake and they were torturing it with a stick.
Bruce ignored the man as he reached for a tray of tools one of the others was holding, snatching up a pair of scissors which he promptly began to use to cut away the injured man's clothing.
Professor Johann Baptist Sieger’s little apartment was well furnished, with all the classic pieces of a man well into his bachelorhood. It might have been cozy were it not for the six dirty children huddled in his closet of a room, their clothes piled in the corner and the three equally dirty and weary adults strewn about the small living space.
“Oh years ago, when Anton was very young.” Kroger waved away his obvious hesitance with a dismissive hand, as if the pain of losing someone you loved dulled with something so small as time.
“It’s not something for you to worry about.” Stefen replied stiffly but James was confused and embarrassed now, which just made for a battle of stubborn on stubborn.
“The men are saying people are in shock. They don’t want to think poorly about Stefen, and nobody wants to see the kids get hurt.”
“Tony, where’s Vati?” she asked, her pink lips forming a dreadful pout and Tony’s heartstrings twisted.
"Why are you smiling like that? It's too early for smiles." Bucky grumbled as he plopped into the open seat between Natacha and James. One look at him had Steve chuckling despite himself. He didn't look to have slept well, and a portion of hair near the back was still spiking upward where his brush had missed.
Following the rescue mission at Dachau Tony is stuck at Engelzell Abbey while the SS comb the countryside looking for him. Meanwhile Steve and the children make a trip to the Berghof for a weekend with the Fuhrer that could have dangerous consequences for them all.
She said it like a dare, and even though she probably knew them better Tony knew his luck and would bet on it any day. As if on cue another round of thunder rolled in and a parade of footstep scurried down the hall, Ian with James and Artur in tow came all but hurtling through the doorway.
Tony snapped out of his days and reached for the captain again. He managed to get an armful of frightened soldier before he was thrown back with surprising ease. He snatched at him again pulling at Stefen’s swinging arms, trying to restrain him the way he’d seen Bruce do on so many occasions. It was like trying to ride a bucking horse. There was another loud crack in his ears and then a bright burst of pain and Tony went down dragging Stefen with him.
“Don't go back to the cottage tonight. Stay with the children. I don't want... I don't know about Herr Stark.”
Tony quickly pulled the blankets up where they had twisted around Stefen's legs and covered them both up until they were cocooned. He wrapped Stefen up within his harms and pressed close shushing him gently when he started awake with a violent jerk.
There were pages and pages of plans. Endless orders for ships and weapons to arm them and detailed designs to fill those orders. Everything was here. Plans for new battleships, submarines, aircraft carriers and at least seven new types of torpedoes that Tony could spot. He could also spot the mistakes, with barely more than a glance.
He said dangerous things. He said things that people weren't supposed to say unless they were bad (unless they were
Rogers struggled for another breath and Dvorak wanted to slap him and tell him to be quiet, if only to spare them all having to watch the pathetic effort.  Would the man never learn the value of staying down when one was clearly down?
Péter knew he was taking a risk just as well as Tony knew he was putting him at one by encouraging him to do it; but all of his doubt faded away as he laid the instrument in Péter’s hands.
In the photos he’d perused on the desk the young Captain Rogers hadn't quite managed the same emotionless gaze as the rest of his company, but he was doing a first rate job of it now.  It must have come with age.
"Hurry." Péter whispered, tugging Anamarie's hand and quietly they slipped out of the alley, Péter immediately slinging his arm over her shoulder and forcing them to a leisurely stroll as if they'd wandered up the street while the officers weren't looking.
Artur was sitting up in his bed, Maria curled up beside him speaking too lowly for Tony to hear but the muscles in his chest tightened when Maria slipped her arms around her brother’s middle and pressed a soft kiss to his cheek. Thinking it an opportune time to present his gift Tony knocked and the children all turned as one to stare with apprehension as he pushed open the door.
“Let go of me! Let go of me, you’re not my father!” James screamed and kicked as Tony dragged him out the front door of the cabin by the back of his shirt. Tony tossed him unceremoniously into the snow outside the door, and James shrieked loud enough to cause an avalanche. So much for laying low Tony thought grimly, bracing his hands on his hips as he glowered down at the boy. James sat up, his face still slack with shock, looking around him stupidly as if he’d never seen snow before. More likely he’d never been tossed out on his ass in it before, Tony thought with no small amount of satisfaction.
After a moment of traded whispers James looked up and glanced back towards the captain and Bakhuizen who had piled the wood in front of the tents begun the process of digging a pit for the fire.
She thought about Herr Stark and all of the dangerous things that he had said and she thought about her Baka and dancing in the music room. She thought about watching her mother getting paler and paler in the bed, and her promise to take care of her father.
“That's where my father used to sell bread, after he left Malta. He’d bring leftovers home and crack the crust for me at night.” Sam recounted, pointing out the window to an abandoned shop. They watched it pass in silence, and it seemed the rattle and shake of the car as it rolled down the street spoke louder than words.
“We should quit meeting like this," Tony attempted to joke, but it felt we off even to him. "It only ever seems to bring bad news."
Sat in a corner he went over it all again and again in his mind, desperately clinging to the only sure thing in his head right now. The soft voice of his grandmother as she’d bid him goodbye.
Tony cut him off. “I am. Because I’m going to contact the others and offer myself and they are going to accept because they will see I. Am.The. most. Capable. There is no reason I shouldn’t go to Dachau.”
"Yes, but the proper sort.  And he wouldn't want to do it with servants." James shot back, for once not sounding as if he agreed with the proper way to do things.
This room like the last was in perfect order, clean and preserved. Tony's fingers itched to take it all apart and see where the pieces fell. He stepped inside, careful to keep his steps light. The room - a music room, he thought - had far less of the ornate grandness of the entry and the differences didn’t stop there. This room seemed like a home. An untouched home but a home none the less.
Natacha reached and without needing her to ask Bucky set his violin aside and reached down to help pull her onto the dock. She dripped water everywhere but he didn’t mind it as she took a seat beside him, tucking her knees up against her chest, and letting her toes wiggle over the edge of the dock.
He didn’t know how much she knew, but then again it didn’t matter so much whether she knew he was a Jew or not. She knew he was disloyal to the Reich and that was enough to hang a man.
The children were relieved to end that days lesson early (French verbs) and trudged from the room, no doubt eager to find cooler spaces. Tony set out for the maids quarters, newly resolved in his mission, because while it was all well and good for the children to be well bred little darlings with the right education to succeed in the world, someone had to see to their crumbling spirits; or else they would become the worst sort of adults the kind without any sort of imagination or hunger for the world- dull in other words. Tony hated dull people above all else.
might not have been said but they’d all heard it. What was more, Natacha seemed to know it despite what Rogers actually said with a hasty clearing of his throat.
“A lesson in what? How to lie?” James retorted. Péter seemed surprised by the younger boy’s defense, saying nothing as he stared between him and their tutor with apprehension.
you! Are you insinuating that the Führer would go back on his word?” Hammer glowered at him, rising from his seat with an expression of outrage and the rushing sound in Tony’s ears tunneled and then snapped until all he could hear was his own harsh breathing.
The rest of dinner passed in a subdued manner and Tony was quiet, favoring his drink over conversation. The drive home had been just as bad.
“Dio Mio.” Tony panted, repositioning both hands upon the headboard and pushing his hips forward. He had no illusions of lasting long. Not with Steve looking at him that way and holding onto him as if he were a lifeline. Not when he just lay there and let Tony
“Mama is still sore with you.” Hedwig clucked her tongue, a teasing glint in her grey eyes. “And Vati says that if you were a decent man you’d never have run off on our Nele.”
“Tony, I wish you wouldn’t say things like that!” she cried suddenly, her voice echoing sharply in the otherwise silent hall. She wouldn’t look at him, but Tony noticed that one hand gripped one wrist in a white knuckled grip. Standing solemnly at the foot of the stairs with her jaw set and her fierce gaze pointed upward she reminded him suddenly of a painting that hung in the east chapel at the abbey. It was a rendition of the Madonna playing interceder, stepping before the heavenly throne on behalf of the condemned as they clutched at her skirts. Tony had always loved that painting but seeing that same fierce tortured burn in the eyes of this little girl was going to break his heart.
"Shh. Lower your voice." Natacha snapped at him, glancing at Daniel and the other children sat across from them. The older boy was staring at them curiously but he didn't say a word. Maria reached across Artur’s lap and patted James thigh. “Don’t worry,” she said. “Tony will find us.”
He would let his own children touch him! He would do what he had to so that when he was gone, they wouldn’t question whether their own father had loved them. That was all that mattered. Steve had heard all kinds of things circulating through the network about how the Brits planned to care for displaced children. He’d been as forthcoming with the children about the possibilities as he could be, but there was no way of knowing where they would end up and what would become of them. Nor who they became.
What the hell was that little jab about Tony trying to prove he could be like him?! It burned. It burned a hole right through the center of him because –
Jann told him where to find the car she’d brought him and Bucky thanked her. The roads would be riskier, but time was everything now. He had to find Steve before the SS did. Before she said goodbye Jann let him know where to reach her next if he needed her again. There was always the tailor’s shop, but it took time for messages to circulate through the network and a direct line when they could secure one could be the difference between life and death.
At present, the memory of Stefen Gavril Rogers was enough to spark revolutions. But how does a man’s memory survive if his own children revile him?”
Tony blew out a breath, quelling the quaking fear inside. One thing at a time. Stefen was awake, miracle though it was, and Tony’s work had just begun. Waking firmly grounded in the present was a good sign, but there would be tests to run before they had the full picture. He’d need to see how responsive Stefen’s nervous system was, and asses his cognitive abilities for brain damage. God. Tony’s heart sank into his stomach and he took a shuddered breath. He grasped Stefen’s wrist, squeezing, grounding himself with the thread beat of his pulse. One thing a time.
Anger so potent he could taste it swelled inside him. He should have been paying closer attention! Where were the others?  He’d been a fool to think he could keep an eye on them all at once, here in this place. It felt like he’d gone into battle naked and he wasn’t used to that feeling. This time around there was no one watching his six. It was up to him to keep them all safe and he wouldn’t fail.
Tony paused in his letter to the Abbott as another bout of thunder rattled the windows on either side of the bed. He eyed the storm shutters, wondering if he shouldn’t lock them if the storm was going to get much worse. Another clap of thunder followed by a sudden gust of wind that sent the shutters banging against the side of the house decided him.
The arm he was using to block the light with the pillow was wet again. He rubbed at his eyes till they stung. Men. Don’t. Cry. He thought viscously, hating that it did nothing to stop the urge.
He couldn’t sleep at night, and when he turned on the actual radio it was only to hear the sounds of Austria’s inevitable march toward war (even as they blithely denied the war going on within). Daily the immigration office was packed to overflowing and yet the window of escape was getting smaller and smaller as other countries restricted the number of refugees they would accept by lower and lower numbers.
“What happened?” Steve asked, gently cupping Tony’s jaw and refocusing on the bruises littering Tony’s face. Tony had never said what happened, and now Steve needed to know like the question was a live wire under his skin.
Rage, he realized as the emotion broke within him like a wave, burning brightly at the edges of his vision.
“No, no it's all right!” The man interrupted in Polish, similar in cadence to what the people of Nowy Sącz had spoken. His expression, which had been a frown so deep it had nearly creased his entire face, had gone slack in surprise and Steve didn’t know whether it was because he’d been knocked over by ‘the famous’ Captain Rogers or because said Captain had apologized in his native tongue.
with some of the sights of Pola. I strongly suggest checking them out for reference, and because it's gorgeous and a nice way to spend a few minutes.
“After the way your ma pulled her into this world how could I forget.” he chuckled darkly as he took a deep drag on his cigarette before he added like an afterthought, “Maybe she should have died in the womb.”
Maria squealed suddenly and Tony opened one eye. The children had spread out some but continued to blink at each other like surprised fish. Only Artur had made any move to play, unfortunately this meant he’d shared one look with Maria before she was shrieking and running away from her brothers out stretched arms.
Steve held out the poster for the man to see, but he did not even look at it. Round, terrified eyes shifted between Steve, Benjamino and the police captain, who stood half a stride back, watching on with an expression of bored contempt.
The hosts voice droned on, and the tension in Tony’s body slowly eased. Enough for him to lean back in his chair and take in a deep slow breath. There was no news about Stefen. It would have been first if there was. No news was good news.
He knew it was playing with fire to go down this route of conversation. He could feel Natacha’s eyes glaring a hole into his back and he’d heard stories of children turning in their own parents for saying far tamer things than Tony was; but he could not hold silent and watch these children with good hearts and good minds wander blindly into such a nightmare.
Glass shattered loudly within the room, snapping Steve out of the hurricane of white noise and horrific images in his head.
A moment or so after he had finished, just long enough that anyone patrolling about on the street at this late hour who had caught the brief flashes, would have given up on a response, a light appeared in the apartment adjacent where Dvořák was leading Third Unit. It was followed in steady procession by a light from Fourth. According to Grimm’s instructions, First and Second both had windows visible from the bedroom.
“What happened?” Sara gaped in a concerned whisper, breaking the silence and Stefen looked up, eyes flickering between her and Pepper before he answered.
“Damn it! Are you crazy?” Tony yelled, throat stinging as he grabbed the man’s shirt one handed and attempted to pull him back inside the safety of the truck. After a moment of resistance, Bucky slid back inside.
“In here Herr Stark.” Sub-Lieutant Amsel’s voice jerked Tony out of his reverie and he realized with embarrassment that the man had stopped a few paces behind him at a closed door. Cheeks heating with embarrassment Tony cleared his throat and followed Amsel as the man knocked briskly on the closed door and opened it once a gravelly voice on the other side bid them enter.
Mechanically she pulled the lever beside the door to ring the in the kitchen. She didn't wait for one of the staff to appear, instead, crossing the floor on silent feet and lowering herself tiredly into Stefen’s chair.
"Don’t fight each other.” She pleaded so softly he almost didn’t hear it, though she was only inches from him. “They want to bury their sins, but what the soil swallows the people must keep alive in memory."
“Getting laid.” Bucky snapped, bracing himself on the back of the armchair. “You know dumb doesn’t suit you Steve and whatever you think, I wasn’t born yesterday.”
“Look I’m sorry I said it like that,” Bucky apologized. He knew that it hadn’t been any easier for Stefen to leave the caravan than it had been for Bucky.
Even in sleep her father’s shoulders were bowed inward, like they were weighted by something heavy sitting on his chest. When Maria was born, he used to lay her on his chest, and it had looked as if the baby weighed nothing at all. She didn’t remember if he used to fall asleep with her like that, but she thought he must have. Where else would she have gotten the silly idea that is chest never caved, his back never bent, and that his shoulders would always bear just a little bit more. Maybe every little girl thought her father was untouchable. It was a lie though. He wasn’t unbreakable. She knew that. She wasn’t a little girl anymore, and yet…
Steve nodded, understanding, and gripped the man’s shoulder tightly in thanks before releasing him. When Grimm had left and they were all assembled in the middle of the room looking to him for instruction, Steve leveled them all with a look and said simply, "before we go further, I wanted to say thank you."
"Well you're a poor guard dog, because we're both here and from where I'm standing he looks pretty damn alone."
"Go away!" Artur huffed beside her, picking up one of the dusty shoes that sat atop the many boxes that crowded the little room under the stairs. He raised it threateningly as if he meant to throw it, and even though Maria knew it was rude to throw things, Tony didn't seem to mind or be very afraid.
“Christ, you pack a wallop,” he grunted lowly, catching her by the wrist, even as the rest of him curled inward to avoid the next blow. He was quick to catch her other wrist and hold it tight. Far too tightly to get away. Natacha kicked at him and screeched.
“Antony.” Pepper cleared her throat and all eyes turned to where she was standing, smoothing Maria's perfect hair. She nodded encouragingly at the girl urging gently, “Go on Sweetheart.”
“Yes, you did.” Péter barked, jarringly in the face of Steve's gentle tone. There were splotches of red forming on his cheeks. "Soldiers are too disciplined to run around making noise. Soldiers don't cry when they miss their mothers and they don't stay down when somebody bigger knocks them down. All you've ever taught us is how to be you."
Bucky slipped a piece ham into his muesli, swiveling the meat in the porridge wondering what was wrong with everyone? The mood at the table was as if someone had died, far too somber just for being disappointed that their father was late.
He'd looked up from his upstroke as Steve had asked him for the rowers and smirked that way he had that was so damn frustrating it couldn’t be put into words.
Tony’s voice intruded, and Steve’s vision swam. He blinked the spots away from his eyes, the room slowly coming back into focus and he released the breath he hadn’t even realized he’d been holding in a rush.
Rogers was next to him again and Becker jumped. How was it possible someone so big could sneak up so silently?
“What are you reading?” Péter asked after a moment of getting himself settled. “The Bible?” He leaned down to stare at the pages in Tony’s lap and wrinkled his nose with the same lack of enthusiasm that Tony usually brought to all matters of faith and this time Tony didn’t fight the smile.
“Father is a good man…” she said, later when they’d sat down for tear, spreading liptauer over a slice of fresh bread. “I hope I make him proud, but it’s difficult sometimes knowing what to do.”
“But you had one, and that was precisely the point. Do you want me to weep because your mother brought you down from a mansion on a hill, to celebrate on the wrong day of the year?” Grig questioned, frustration creeping into his tone.
“I’m on your side Antony. Haven’t I always been? You sure know how to make a mess – drove poor Hugh crazy didn’t it? But all of
With the garage and the attic out as options, Tony was sure to step on Herr Hammer's toes taking over one of the family rooms, Steve thought with a rueful smile.
Something hit Bucky squarely from behind, knocking the wind out of him. There was a moment of discombobulation where Bucky wasn't sure where his limbs were and where Tony’s were, and then he was being wrenched off of Steve.
Steve’s heart sank at the news, wondering if Luca and the rest had made it to Italy, only to discover that it wasn’t the sanctuary they had thought it would be. If this had been happening on the mainland for months, there was a good chance they had been rounded up and moved to an internment camp.
“We all know exactly what you meant.” Natacha cut him off, raising her chin haughtily and not bothering to hide how angry she was. The others would be on her side now anyway. Poor Emil had turned pale and then very red in the face, embarrassed to have landed in such an awkward situation with her friends and his friends standing by hanging on every word.
The man had not been a monster… but his mistakes had been many and while he was no longer alive to either realize that or make recompense, Stefen very much was and that, Tony knew, was the reason behind why he’d changed.
“I don't recall seeing you after dinner, Péter” he groused and Péter froze, his face going red as he stuttered over a response.
Dreaming of having Tony here like this had been all that was keeping him going for weeks. It was too tempting not to touch his slick skin when touching him was all that made Steve feel grounded. When delving into the warmth of Tony’s mouth until his lungs screamed for air was somehow easier than struggling for a breath on his own.
“Why, what’s so special about it?” Péter asked curiously and Tony tapped one finger against the page of his personal journal, laying open in his own lap, where he’d detailed notes on the atomic makeup of uranium.
Natacha raised her hand then, snatched it back down, blushing faintly at the ingrained reaction before she straightened regally in her chair.
The attendant led them up to the Prince’s private suite, which was as opulent as Steve might have guessed, but he could barely appreciate any of the fine décor with his nerves strung so tightly.
He’d listened to Tony and Péter talking that afternoon, and watched carefully as Tony instructed Péter and Natacha on different techniques to ease the pain in James’ chest, and get him to cough up the mucus that was collecting there. Ian had watched carefully, the way he always did and thought very long and hard about what he should do.
He didn't have any longer to think about it because that was the moment when Tony finally arrived, trouble hot on his heels in the form of hurried footsteps and raised voices, including his own.
He caught the captain’s eye as his gaze swept over the line again and arched his brow, challenging the man’s intelligence (because
“Are you?” Steve asked, frowning. Something from the dream coming back to him. A fear, that brought with it the feeling of a deep and bottomless emptiness. These were not Tony’s children, or Tony’s burdens. If they were too much for Steve, how long would it be before they became too much for Tony? Tony shot him a queer look, and Steve avoided his searching eyes. It was just a dream. He would beat it.
“Maybe I’d better take him for the night?” the monk fretted, but Artur didn’t seem to like this suggestion any better, sobbing now as he locked both arms around Steve as he shook and shuddered.
"Uncle Bucky caught a rabbit Tony! Only, he broke it's neck and Maria’s crying." Artur looked only half as guilty about this as he seemed to think he should, the gleam of excitement still in his eyes even as he shifted his weight bashfully and cast worried looks in his sister’s direction.
Unbidden, the memory of the pressure of Stefen’s mouth against his returned, along with heat and taste, and Tony clenched his hands together tightly, swallowing to moisten a suddenly dry mouth. Yes yes, he knew what he would like to do, but he was unsure how to broach the subject with the captain. They’d not spoken of the kiss they’d shared since it had occurred, neither of them able to find another free moment alone and perhaps unwilling to be the first to tempt fate after hours.
“And I suppose you want it in writing?” Charlotte laughed, incredulous, but the laughter faded from her expression when she realized how serious he was. Still she asked haltingly, “Stefen… you’re not serious, are you?”
If Tony hadn’t been looking for it he would have missed the way Sieger twitched before he jumped to defend himself.
A clever girl.  The housekeeper would do well to send her abroad if she could. it wasn't the child's fault she favored the father. Any more than it was his Rene's or Helene's fault that they favored darker relatives.  Her mother's position in Rogers staff would afford her some protection, but not at all times or in all areas. On the street, anyone could say or do whatever they felt inclined to foreigners. He warned Helene often enough. It was hard to tell the good people apart from the bad these days.
There were too many variables, Bucky contemplated darkly flicking the knife in his palm open and closed, open and then closed again. The execution site would be a circus ring, bursting with soldiers and police. No, they had to take Steve on the road, and they only got one shot at it. If they failed, they were dead because Bucky wouldn’t stop until he was dead. He’d known that when he’d left Stark and the children up at Phillips cabin.  Steve would expect Bucky to forget about him and get the kids out of the country – but damn what Steve wanted.
For better or for worse he’d taken them out of hiding.  It didn’t surprise Tony one bit when Stefen, after a long moment of consideration and a telling glance at Bakhuizen, slowly nodded in agreement.
It was the closest thing to how he felt that Tony could manage without giving more away than was wise; because no matter how certain he was that Natacha would repeat the things he’d said to the vaunted Frauline Werner there was still always that one percent, and so much of him still that wanted to live.
"Uncle James picked us up. We’ve been looking for you Tony. James insists he doesn't know how to pack his own clothes and is annoying Ian again."
Bucky held his face for a moment more, his hand sliding up to touch his check and Steve felt something uncoil in him. To his horror he felt tears begin to sting at his eyes and for a moment all he felt was wild panic as the shame of it began to overwhelm him.
“You’re too modest Herr Stark.” Charlotte, who was standing on the captains left, murmured as she lifted her drink to her mouth and sipped it delicately. Tony might have thought he imagined the veiled bite to her tone, except he caught the way Steve stiffened out of the corner of his eye.
“Hedy knows what she’s about, but I’d be careful if I were you. She has a mean right hook.” The blond warned.
But maybe that was just fine, Stefen thought as Bucky hugged him back. They had never really needed words.
“I don’t know sweetheart, princes are very busy people,” he hedged. Thankfully Maria seemed to accept this, mouth only pulling down in the slightest of frowns. “Why not ask him. I’m sure if it’s at all possible he’d love to meet a lovely little lady like you.”
The beds were coming along nicely. He’d ventured out briefly to collect wood, and the children had helped Tony strip and rub down it down to chop into long planks. He’d made two simple frames, which once the netting was finished, he’d prop up on four trunk legs. A rope bed was hardly a technical marvel, but just having something productive to occupy their time seemed to be brightening the children’s spirits. James being the most drastic example.
“The children… are sleeping?” he repeated slowly as if he couldn’t believe he’d heard the words right. “Well ain’t that just the sweetest thing I’ve ever heard.”
“You’re only sayen it. You don’t really know.” Clint grumbled. He pulled up his robe as if he were going to stuff the gun down his drawers and Tony waylaid him with a firm hand against his chest and a shake of his head.
“We’ll need more almonds,” she decided, trying to move past Bucky but he was so much taller and broader than she was, and he easily moved to block her way. It made the anger return, swelling hot and violent within her. Did he think she couldn’t do it, that he had to fan and coddle her now because she was too fragile to pick up spilled flour? How hateful! How stupid! How she wanted to hit him.
“When the men come back, you’ll have to report for duty again won’t you?” she asked quietly, continuing to watch him fretfully, worrying her lip between her teeth.
A startled laugh scraped from his throat and Bucky’s lips tilted in a sad grin.  Steve’s legs felt weak, like he might fall down. All this time and Bucky had known. Hadn’t cared. All this time.
What law? Tony wondered. There were restrictions of course, delegated by the government, but nothing about the abolishment of all music.
“It always gets me when you do that” Bucky interrupted, dismissing Steve's gratitude with with a wave of his hand as if he were waving away a bad smell.
He held there, his knuckles white with strain and his arms beginning to ache, until the woman’s voice had moved away from the window and became too muffled to distinguish. With a slight breath of relief Tony reached up, tapping a familiar rhythm against the wooden shutters as quickly as he could without losing his precarious grip.
“He founded Germany’s first free school, a school for free thinking. The fundamentals and teachings which were at the heart of the
Together they exited and as Steve lugged Sam’s bags from the boot of the car he regret refusing Sam’s offer to help as his ribs violently protested. He was hunched over, taking a pinched breath when his eyes fell on a man a few yards away.
Tony yanked the door open and Stefen's eyes widened, surprised by the sudden motion. For a moment they just stood on opposite sides staring at one another.
Charlotte proved just as persuasive as she promised. Whatever she’d suggested in her letter to the brass they suddenly saw every reason in the world for the Rogers to return to Salzburg in order to celebrate with Péter. Tony and the children were sent ahead at the captain’s insistence, and even that request was met with minimal fuss. He supposed it was hard for anyone to deny a woman concerned with the education of children, but anyway, Tony didn't care so much what their reason was. Only that for now the family got to take a break from the public tour and that they could all be there to welcome Péter when he arrived home for break.
“More fun that way. ‘Sides. I used to sneak into Tony’s workshop all the time. He’d hardly know it was me if I came through the front door.”
He turned and slammed the door in his wake. The smaller children scattered, fleeing back toward the bed like frightened mice. The older ones took a wary step backward parting like the red sea as he marched passed them to go back to getting ready to venture outdoors.
“And Milthede,” Charlotte called as the maid turned to dash away, the woman turned back, waiting for her instructions. “Call Analise at the Kindertransport, tell her I'm interested in making another charitable donation.”
“Are you sure?” Stefen rasped hoarsely in reply. He was trembling Tony noted. There was something volcanic inside of him, a pain that had built and built and had nowhere to go but outward. Any doubt that Stefen had suffered as much as he had over their separation was washed away.
Or it would have, if the wall hadn’t proved to have an amazing set of reflexes on top of things. A set of firm hands grabbed him about the waist and caught him by the arm before he could tumble inelegantly to the ground and that was how Antony Eduard Stark found himself staring up into a wall with eyes.
To Ian's surprise he took the garment anyways and turned it over in his large hands. He could see the buttons had been ripped right out, Ian was sure of it. He looked down at his feet as he waited. His father’s eyes flicked to him and he turned from his canvas bag that was lying open on the bed.
Next to Steve stood Herschel, his hands grasping futilely at the rash creeping over his ribcage. They jumped as a guard shouted a warning dispassionately into the room.
James curled up on the bed, his back turned on the party and glared at the wall. Tucked into the corner, just above the edge of the bed was a row of small neat scratches. One for each day since uncle Bucky had left them.  There were thirty-one and tomorrow there would be thirty-two.
“I told Lukas to take her and Danijella and get on a boat, months ago. Now what the hell is Jessika going to do?” Bakhuizen cursed through a stream of smoke, catching Tony’s attention once more. “That’s what trying to be a damn hero gets you.”
"Here!" Bucky immediately whirled on him. "How in God's name are you going to explain them coming here? The staff will-"
Harold came out of the garage at the sound of the car pulling up, shock bleeding into happy surprise as he recognized them.
for a woman to walk around looking like that. She was a smart girl, she had to know dressing like this invited trouble.
When he looked up at his father there was something close to awe in Péter’s eyes as he asked, “How did you know I wanted one?”
He was going so fast. Too fast! He was headed headfirst into a tree he realized with panic. He grabbed desperately at the edges of the sled and threw all of his body weight to the right side.
“Stanislov fired your grandfather before the dirt covered your mother’s grave. He told us to leave the city but I told your Nonno we could not leave. How would you find us? My poor bambino so alone, so alone with those devils.” She spat, the disgust toward Hughards ghost sharp and full of vitriol even now. “Where are you Antony? Are you warm? Are you eating?”
“Hard to tell until we can get a proper look at it. Let’s get her downstairs. Can you help me lift her?”
Péter was thrilled to be leaving, but nervous as well, and those nerves were often echoed in his siblings. They’d never been separated for any great stretch of time, and now Péter would be gone for months on end. James had thrown a fit at the news. A full production of tears and tantrum that Tony thought even Stefen had seen through. It wasn’t just that the boy was jealous his older brother got to have an adventure and was leaving the others behind. It was the leaving altogether that James was just not prepared to handle. Even Natacha had seemed shaken by the news. She’d never carry on like James but she was quieter than usual, and eating less.
"Is this what we call a Section Leader?  If you were any kind of man Rogers you would not need others to defend you."
“No woman would put up with you Bakhuizen.” Turning to Steve with a short nod of respect Harold went on to say, “We weren’t expecting you Captain. Ginny didn’t say you’d telephoned.”
Her father looked equal parts flummoxed and suspicious, but a slow smile was blooming on her mother’s face.
Bucky settled back to eating, taking carefully small bites and devoting the utmost concentration on chewing them. Around him the talk flowed, and he could swear he could hear every rustle of damn cotton as the children shifted about. It was almost soothing in a strange way. Bucky was lost to the din when another sound caught his attention. A gentle sound. It carried him back, like he was floating on the lazy river with his face tilted up, skin darkening under summer sun and bright blue sky.
But therein lay the trouble, because at the first real suggestion of sleeping in a strange bed in a completely foreign setting, the courage of his excited little companions began to waver.
But then the bell for the maids had rattled like it was strapped to the end of a pissed cat, and Bucky's heart had sunk into his stomach. He was no Drabarni to tell any man his fortune but he trusted the sick feeling and the way the hair on the back of his neck stood on end.
Stefen smiled, leaning just the slightest bit to close what little distance remained between them so that Tony knew he was about to be kissed – until the sound of footsteps at the end of the hall caused them to jerk apart.
It was with that thought in mind that Tony slowly reached for the captain, whose eyes were still shuttered and pained, but who for whatever reason did not flinch away from his touch as Tony rested his hand gently upon his arm.
Natacha took a bite of her bread. Frauline Werner had called the dish delightfully quaint when Frau Hogan had served them. Natacha loved liptauer.
All Steve wanted to do was tell Schmidt to stay the fuck away from his children if he knew what was good for him. But Schmidt still held most of the cards, as he like to remind Steve at every opportunity.
So let Captain Rogers have a problem with it if he was going to. Tony had a thing or two to say to him about leaving his children alone at night in a house this big with no one to care for them. He’d wonder what kind of heartless ogre could ignore the fear on their faces, but he doubted Rogers had ever stuck around long enough after supper to witness them.
He could change the world. The war. He couldn’t save those poor people, but he could sure as hell avenge them.
Disgust pooled in his stomach and he clenched fitfully at the napkin in his cut hand. Tony didn’t deserve that and Steve would never offer it to him.
If they stayed on the mountain, they wouldn’t make it. Tony knew, with a creeping feeling of certainty that even if they were extremely careful on their outdoor excursions, that the refuge the cabin had provided them had started to expire the moment they were forced to seek out their neighbors for help.
Another crack of thunder seemed to shake the house and the curtains billowed, rain flying into the room as the wind shifted. Belatedly Tony rushed to close the window they’d left gaping open. Finished, he grumbled under his breath something about leaving monkeys behind at the abbey as he turned away from it, only to yelp in alarm at the unexpected sight of another body in the room.
He dashed to give the service bell a violent tug even as Willamina was turning down the stove were a pot of chocolate was warming in order to rush to his side.
“Were you able to get more film when you were in town?” Tony asked instead. Péter had been complaining about wanting to do that since he’d run out of film a few days prior. It was a safe enough opening and maybe once he got talking, Péter would open up about whatever had happened.
Steve clenched his mouth around the unlit end of the cigarette, allowing the acrid smoke to flood his mouth and trickle down into his lungs as he jerked his shoulder up and down in an aggressive shrug.
The adults in Péter's world seemed content to keep their heads down and shuffle along under the boot of the Nazi's but there were some, like Anamarie and her friends, who believed that it was their duty to stand up against Hitler because he was a tyrant who should be removed from office.
At first glance Tony's first thought was that it was Maria, his heart twisted painfully at the state of her, but when he called her name and stepped toward her, the girl looked up at him with unfamiliar eyes that peered wildly out at him through a curtain of dark hair.
Tony hid a chuckle behind a cough as Artur, Rogers’ miniature, answered back with, “Boys aren’t pretty.” He then marched forward with purpose and announced that his name was Artur, he was seven and a holy terror (no doubt something learned at the apron strings of the previously mentioned Frauline Glass). Tony was still biting his lip trying not to laugh aloud when he felt a tug on his pant leg and looked down to find little Sara staring up at him indignantly with hands on her hips. He knelt so that he was not towering over her and greeted her with a warm smile. So sue him, he was a sucker for cherubs.
Magda swallowed, and took a step towards him. She was trembling but her voice was steady when she asked. “Where?”
Tony rolled his eyes rather than respond, because that was just the throw away condition and they both knew it. Tony would never have left Bruce to face the retaliation of the Gestapo after their heist.
He’s arguing with Tony. Again. He’d forgotten the point of the argument; the point now was to one up each other. To argue until Tony gave. Tony did give. Steve did in fact believe in miracles. Pushing to that point was as exhilarating each time as it was infuriating. Kind of like the man himself.
Franz paled and opened his mouth – but whatever he would have said in response just became an aborted grunt as his eyes rolled to the back of his head and he crumpled to the ground. Steve stood over him, the butt of the rifle still hovering in mid-air.
The monk smiled at him and Steve resisted the urge to bare his teeth.  Artur glanced at Steve uncertainly before asking in a quiet voice, “Did he die?”
Tony set his book aside and hurried across the room, resigned to seeing what manner of trouble the children had managed to find for themselves. His eyebrows shot up in surprise when he found Ian stood outside his door looking not at all frantic or bothered, carrying a tray laden with food.  There was a plate full of delicately cut sandwiches that smacked of Willamina's handiwork and a clay soup bowl with lid firmly placed shut, hiding its contents, but if Tony had to guess by the smell wafting into the room he'd go with potato.  Though admittedly it was hard to tell what was what, with how his nose wanted to fixate on the heavenly smell of espresso wafting from the cup beside it.
"Tony informs me you've been accepted into the International school of Geneva. I think you should go."
“Have you been there?” She asked, injected some of Artur’s youthful enthusiasm into her voice and as if compelled, Rita Göring huffed a laugh.
The words raced around and around Tony’s head like a storm, dragged up from somewhere deep in his soul until they felt like they’d burst out from behind his teeth in one long continuous shout.
He was stronger to, than Steve had expected, able to row them across the lake all by himself. Near the end he’d strained Steve remembered but he would not hear of stopping.
God damn it! Tony cursed, heart thumping hard in his chest as he dove under after him. James had risked drowning right here in front of his father, in front of Tony’s very eyes and for what?! So that his brother would get in the damn water?
Rogers certainly looked better this morning (less green around the gills) but he still held himself stiffly as if pained. Maybe that was just the way he was, Tony mused, constantly tortured by an invisible rod up the rear.
“I can take you only on your floor, Captain. You have to take the stairs from there, the door will be locked. You will need to use the force.”
“It´s not like that, cap. You got it all wrong. This,” he lifted the hand in the air, “is because of my wrist, it is stabilizing it and helping me with heavy liftings. Right now even with easy liftings, like, eh… a pan with a meat? In the state the wrist is in, I wouldn´t even lift it from the cooker.”
This time Steve also snickered, because… well, this was becoming a real habit. Iron man helping them out saving lives and then admitting he broke a law right in a next second.
So like that they started to bump into each other on and off the streets of New York. Usually when Iron man stroke it wasn´t in the states and therefore they were always late. But sometimes they met also in the city, especially when there was a big threat and big fight, where he could come, help and go into hiding again as fast as possible. And despite Fury´s protests Steve found a way how to make him cooperate, how to even work with him side by side, how to make him listen to the orders at least to some point.
he’d promised, but by the time Steve had checked at the bank and Tony’s usual haunts, the dinner hour had come and gone.
The captain would be happy to know that Artur was enjoying his gift, Tony thought wistfully. Stefen was missing so many precious moments. Tony had to try harder to get him to see that they had to take the children and leave Austria, before it was too late and the Nazi’s destroyed what innocence they had left.
“… and after breakfast I’d like to go over some documents with you. I think they could tell us a lot about their strategy. Poland makes the most sense to me as a starting point but the talk surrounding Czechoslovakia can’t be ignored.” Steve was saying as he rifled through the stack of papers on his desk.
“Very good.” Tony called back to Artur, who was grinning happily at his find. “Our snares aren’t strong enough for wild goats. If you see one leave it alone. They’re stronger than you’d think.”
“It’s still snowing. If I go now, it will cover the tracks of the truck.” Bucky explained, as if the more matter of fact he was the better chance the children would understand.
The sound of Bucky’s voice drew Natacha’s attention (the girl had the ears of a wolf Steve would swear) and at the sight of them she gasped. One by one the children turned to look where she was looking and within moments the room erupted into chaos.
“Stefen?” Tony managed to rasp in wonder, slowly lowering the pipe just before the most precious sound he’d ever heard came from the darkness. From the back of the cellar James came running like a bat out of the dark.
Though Stefen believed it to be a waste of precious money, Tony had secured two tickets for that evening’s performance of The Sleeping Beauty at the City Theater. It had been surprisingly well booked for a show put on by a new company, relatively unknown and untraveled but for Istria. The war in Europe, which had hobbled the tours of larger companies with their
But then again, Stefen thought with a wry smile, it had been a long time since he'd let anyone get away with calling him 'Cap', so he might very well be the pot in this situation.
"I told you not to interfere, Tony! I have a plan and it might have a chance of working if you would fucking leave well enough alone!"
"No listen,” Tony waved him impatiently to silence. “There's a way for us to do this, with just one man. The right man."
"Damn the mayor!"  his shout echoed through the kitchen and as he took a menacing step toward her, the pair of maids cowered back. Charlotte snapped her mouth shut and looked away, silent and stoic. The only hint of vulnerability to her was the wounded roundness in her eyes that she wasn’t quick enough to hide.
They'd stopped at a shop for a late lunch and they'd been halfway through the meal before they'd been approached by Jessika Duerr.
“Did you hear his clearance codes?” Tony asked, rising to his feet. Stefen followed him, his gaze sharp in a way that told Tony he had already guessed what he was thinking. Luzzato nodded a tad hesitantly.
This is the KNIGHT, broadcasting from the INN, reaching out to our friends at the CASTLE letting them know that Auntie is in our prayers. Nephew will get the flowers. What is Wendy’s schedule?
“Perhaps.” Tony set down the poker and walked over to the chair that Stefen sat in. He lowered himself to his knees, planting himself at the captain’s feet and looked up. If his words couldn’t reach Stefen wherever he was, then Tony would rely on a communication stronger than words. His body might just speak in a way that Stefen could hear.
It took a few minutes more to dry Sara’s tears and sooth Maria, but the day got started like all the others. Father kept them all in close proximity, and when the men came to inquire why he had not answered his summons for duty, Charlotte told them he was still feeling under the weather.
As the cook bustled about snapping orders and preparing his drink, Bucky sank gratefully into the chair Hortense pulled away from the table and dragged up next to the large oven. She helped him remove his damp coat and scurried away, returning a moment later with a fresh blanket.
Stefen would have to follow later but he'd promised not to miss picking Péter up from the train. Tony believed him, but he had very mixed feelings about leaving Stefen and the Baroness in Nuremburg.  He was jealous of the woman he could admit that, but more than that he did not like to leave Stefen out of his sight knowing what he was involved in and the constant risk of discovery.
“My family is at stake!” Dvořák thundered and the cool air of calm around Rogers broke, as the man slammed a hand down hard on Dvořák’s desk.
"Jesus." Bucky muttered as he got his first good look at it, the blood training from his face. Tony hoped it was from the sight of the wreckage and not from the wound still oozing blood on his arm. Leshnerr quietly reached down to tear off a strip of the thin prison issue pants he wore beneath his monks robe and began wrapping it around the wound.
By the time they'd finally packed up, left camp and rowed their boats across the lake and returned home she'd been so tired she just wanted to fall into her bed and sleep for a hundred years like Briar Rose but Father had touched her elbow and pulled her aside.
He remembered the terrible fright when the door had been wrenched open and hands had grabbed him pulling him into the seething mob. He didn’t know how long he’d kicked and screamed before he’d recognized the man pulling him through the mass of bodies was his tutor, Jacob Yinsen. He just remembered the painful racing of his heart and straining to hear his mother over the roar of the crowd, the sick twist in his gut when he realized he could no longer hear her.
My god what did it take to shut the man up! Was it attention the monk wanted? This game was all on purpose, that was clear but what end the man had in mind Steve couldn't begin to fathom. Hadn't he given the man a job? It was not an easy thing to come by nowadays.
Wordlessly Péter turned and fled from the room, but Tony only relaxed once the captain had returned to his seat. He’d not been sure he would, because once there was a time when Stefen would have stormed away, leaving the other children in the wake of his dark bursts of temper. Tony was grateful for Stefen’s restraint, but perhaps doubly so for whatever made him stay.
The man, smartly dressed in a long coat and hat, watched them closely, lifting a cigarette to his mouth, eyes intent.
! Thinking of what could have happened to Tony left Steve reeling. The fear channeled into rage. “Tony he could have killed you! And what if he made you give up the rest of us? You could have destroyed everything!”
It was a small part, but it was insistent and it screamed at him the warning that his failure to protect them would be the end of him. Bucky commented on his morose moods and even Charlotte had commented that he had seemed less than enthusiastic about their dinner the following night.
. He hung there, panting desperately for breath, suspended on the rung of a rickety wooden gate before spots danced in front of his eyes. It was so hard to breathe. He couldn’t... he couldn’t....
Tony almost laughed outright. Bruce sounded like he was attempting to swallow an egg, using that title to address the same man he’d caught multiple times committing sodomy and a host of other sins.
"Grab on!" Bruce called from above, leaning over the edge of the boat along with Leshnerr and Brother Vogel to pull them both aboard.
“If what you’re saying is true, we won’t just lose the war. This will be the war to end all wars.” Holmes mused darkly. “The Germans will blow us all to smithereens before we can develop an effective counter offense.”
His father, sitting across from his mother at the table, sun streaming through the window and glinting off his mother’s favorite crystal cups. The smell of brandy already clinging to his father’s jacket. The sharp scent softened by the smell of his mother’s perfume. Gigli.
It was extraordinarily painful in a way he'd never expected to feel, watching these youths realize that the truth: the Germans did not care whether the people they were deporting lived or died.
Charlotte stepped back from the door, not wanting to be caught like a child listening at the keyhole. He heart was racing like a mad thing in her chest but she raised her head high as her bedroom door burst open. In swept not the police but Virginia Hogan, still in her coat and gloves, her cheeks wind chaffed and her hat eschew. Charlotte sagged a little, releasing a slow quiet breath of relief.
"Our mother taught us how to read the signs." Pietro said in a very subdued tone, drawing Péter's attention. "She said we'd need it one day. When we were alone. She said it would guide us to safety and that when we came to another caravan we must say,
And most tellingly of all they didn’t know how much he loved his children, and therefore could not contemplate the things he might do to protect them.
“It’s good to see you Tony.” Obi began, even managing to sound sincere about it. “You had me thinking you were dead.”
“She is Major Rogers fiancé and Maxwell Schrader’s daughter.” Stevens cut in tiredly, and Hammer sneered.
James proved the most stubborn of all. His black mood lingered for days after Natacha had started to come around. In the beginning he’d given Tony the cold shoulder and refused to move from his corner of the bed even for meals. Tony had observed Natacha bringing him food, so he let the situation be for as long as he could. But when it became clear that he was losing his last companion in his misery and resentment James changed tactics.
“What road are they taking?” Bucky demanded again, his own voice cool and controlled as he pointed his gun at Dvorak’s heaving chest.
James and Sara were both born in May and for them Tony had in mind to craft a pair of backpacks from animal hide for both, and a small stuffed toy lined in rabbit fur in particular for Sara.
“Well, according to him you’d have to have been born in Italy smelling like the giglio and blessed by the virgin to make espresso the way it
“That’s great Tony,” Steve said, sounding distracted. He stepped toward Tony and then seemed to think better of it. Stopping in the middle of the room he beckoned with one hand. “Would you come here for a moment?”
“I understand your disbelief Frauline.” The lieutenant replied stiffly, looking intensely uncomfortable. “But a credible witness has come forward.”
“Father, you’re not going to beat Péter are you?” Maria asked fearfully.  Stefen’s face shuttered and Maria turned to Tony, gripping him tighter. “He isn’t is he, like what happened to the poor boy in our book?”
He hardly needed to, he assured himself with a shake. He had a firm hand on his more wayward desires and what with seven children to his credit it wasn't like he had anything left to prove to anyone.
It was so hard to believe that the man who’d brought them to Vienna was his father, that sometimes he thought he’d blink only to find that he’d dozed off in his bedroom back home.
He should be better than this. Combining sex and carnage was a line he felt should not be crossed, and yet look at him.
A sad smile tugged on Tony’s mouth just as a tender swell of longing tugged on his heart. He replaced the dried sprig and closed the book, gently placing the old girl atop the desk. He was learning that while one did not have to live in the past, one didn’t have to bury it at the bottom of a drawer either.  Stefen could benefit from just such a lesson.
James had immediately wanted to follow him and all it had taken was Ian telling him to stay put to bring on the latest melt down.
It was going to be won by whomever had the biggest stick, and history would remember them as good no matter if they deserved it or not.
Frau Hogan made an aborted movement towards him, the hand that was reaching for his face falling to her side and smoothing her dress instead.
Tony knocked gently on the door, drawing the attention of the boys in the room and Péter's face broke into a relieved smile when he saw him.
There was a smattering of applause from the crowd and a fond murmur of chatter over the thoughtfulness of the gift as Péter swallowed, dropping his father’s gaze. His hands tightened around the box. He might have been at a loss for words but when he shifted in his seat and looked up to catch Tony’s eye, his expression spoke volumes.
No one seemed inclined to risk insulting one of the Führer’s inner circle by halting his rant. And rant he did, pointing out all the flaws he saw in the Wehrmacht as if his own swollen ego was of no consequence. He was drunk and making a fool of himself Steve thought with disgust. Finally the man seemed to run out of air.
When the train pulled into station in Berlin Tony’s heart had taken up a distracting pace within his chest, each beat overly strong in his opinion, as if it were attempting to be heard over the many voices and the roar and squeal as the train came to a stop.
Stefen twisted, and they both leaned to peer out into the sitting room where the children were happily dancing around their uncle. Tony recognized parts of it from one of the dances Natacha had taught them.  The boys were clapping and kicking their feet while the girls twirled. Maria didn’t look half bad spinning gleefully alongside her sisters. Sara was a wobbling mess of giggles but was all the more adorable for it, and Natacha was as graceful as a spinning top. There was a wide grin on her face.
“This is happening in other parts of the city? He asked, his pulse beginning to elevate. Something was about to happen. It was a metallic taste on his tongue with every breath he took. A feeling on his skin, like a hand passing too close.
“Susann, be thankful you’re not involved.” He kept his voice low, as not to startle the others, but she heard the danger in it.
"Gone?! How could they possibly be gone?" the captain demanded, his face white with the same dread that had already turned to grim resolve in the pit of the lieutenant's stomach. It was a good question. How had Bakhuizen managed to sneak them out without Deiter's notice? Bakhuizen had been sat at the bar the whole time. The entire escort had been in the street to watch the door, and from his seat any accomplices would have had to march the children right past Deiter to exit via a kitchen door. He'd have seen any of the children heading for the washroom for that matter, he realized with a jolt, the hurt of betrayal blossoming in his chest. He turned back into the cafe - meeting the fearful eyes of its few remaining patrons as he racked his gaze through the dining room.
