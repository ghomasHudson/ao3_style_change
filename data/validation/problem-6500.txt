Clint nodded, still shaken. Too much was coming apart too fast. He'd fucked up in a way he wasn't sure he could even make up for, and now Nat might be in the same boat he'd been in. Then another thought occurred to him. "You don't think..." His voice broke and he cleared his throat, genuine fear in his eyes when he looked at Coulson again. "You don't think that this... whatever it is... is contagious, do you?" The idea that it might happen again, that he might lose himself again, was utterly terrifying.
"You make it sound pretty simple. But then, I guess you're not the dead man," Tony said flatly, his jaw tightening. He wondered absently if there would be a way to convince any of them that Loki would be on their side. It seemed unlikely. The god had a talent for convincing people he was on their side right before he stuck a knife in them. Tony knew that even vouching for the god was out of the question; they'd all assume he'd been bewitched.
"Mmm... good. My evil plan has come to fruition." Steve gave a little wriggle beneath the man, just enough to feel Tony's strength. "Then I guess the only real question left is whether you'd like to bend me over the couch or fuck me up against the wall." It still made him blush to say things like that, but he knew it was worth it. He knew how hot it got Tony, and watching that spark of lust light in his lover's eye was something he'd never get tired of seeing.
Logan stood from the table. "Right. On that note, think I'll go... settle in." He stood and tried to walk as casually from the room as he could. It was frustrating, really, that this egotistical, barely-sane scientist seemed to know more about him than he or Xavier could ever have possibly figured out. Part of Logan wanted to go beat answers out of Tony, and the other part just didn't want to admit that the man might have anything Logan would value so much.
"When did you become Mr. Bossy Boots?" Tony asked, clearly taken aback by Steve's assertive stance. Of course the other man was right. It was the fact that Tony was helpless to do anything which irked him. He tried to sit up to further protest, but the pain hobbled him and he was forced to concede defeat. "Alright, I'll wait here. I'll be pretty and silent and wait for your return." Tony fixed Steve with a meaningful stare. "And you'd better return - no matter what you find out. You made a promise, and I'm going to hold you to it."
Tony tensed. He'd told himself the same thing a few dozen times over. Hearing it from someone else made him doubt the certainty he'd had moments before that Loki was sincere. "He is, Steve, but..." He glanced at the god in question, taking in Loki's stooped shoulders. He looked oddly small. "There are some things I don't think even Loki would lie about."
She smiled again and gave Clint a little wave as the pair of them headed out. It was a conversation that could wait until later, a thought that she let percolate in the back of her burning mind. It could wait.
Steve swallowed hard around the lump in his throat and reached out to touch the cool metal. "I... thanks. Thank you. This will help. You... can you tell me how to... I don't..."
Clint hated it. Nat didn't even fight being imprisoned the way Logan and Scott had. "Call if you need anything," he said. He fixed his gaze on Phil. "We need to figure out what the next step is."
“I feel like that myself,” Bucky agreed. “Half the time it’s like I’m wandering around in a daze.” He shrugged his shoulders, at a loss. “It’d probably be a hell of a lot more fun if we were both working off a buzz. Y’know, if we’d been lit up with drugs and all those stories we’ve been handed were a result of that.” Bucky laughed softly, “Ignore me. Talking nonsense helps me make sense of things… if that makes any sense, that is.”
"Oh. That." Clint had skimmed the memo, assumed it was one of the junior SHIELD members, and left it at that. It was a little different knowing it was someone who struck him as the sort to never get scolded about so much as an overdue haircut, nevermind sucking face in public. He took a sip of his coffee, trying to wrap his head around the idea that Fury's favorite had done anything wrong enough to get a memo blasted out. "I kinda assumed it was a dumb kid. Since you're not a dumb kid, I'm guessing there's more to it than that, and that it's bugging you." Steely eyes watched Steve closely, but there wasn't any sort of judgment in them, just curiosity and a fair amount of concern to boot. Clint liked Steve, and as more than fap fodder. The guy was a good teammate. He'd taken good care of Nat during the whole Loki incident - which was apparently hanging over their heads once again - and had more than proven himself in combat.
Steve began working just as resolutely to get Tony out of his clothing. "Backseat?" If they didn't move, someone was going to end up with a gear shift someplace they didn't want it. It was surprisingly complicated for the both of them to scramble back over the seats, but it was worth it when Steve was able to drag Tony in close and kiss him easily while they tore at each other's clothing. He felt a few buttons give here and there, but neither of them cared. Clothing was overrated. Tony looked better naked anyway. Steve resolutely did his best to divest Tony of clothing and mostly succeeded in opening his shirt, pushing off his jacket, and unzipping his pants in the fever of trying to get more and closer and now. He finally slowed and ran a hand down over Tony's chest through the trail of dark hair there, smiling. "Nice start."
"Well, I can't imagine you ever being useless," Tony said, offering Steve a meaningful half smile. Even though he had familiarized himself with Steve's records, and knew all about him before he had been injected with the super soldier serum, Tony found himself impressed with the man before he ever became Captain America. Determination, compassion, and a fierce sense of justice were things that could never be bottled. "In fact, I think you're selling yourself short. From what I can see, you've been pretty amazing since day one."
Tony flinched, but he decided to ignore that and not delve deeper. Everything seemed to remind him of his ordeal, and even when he shut his eyes he could still see Winter Soldier's face leering down at him. His own reaction to the assault sickened him more than anything. He tried to console himself with the fact that he had been drugged and believed the other man was Steve, but that offered Tony little comfort. "I don't suppose you could sneak something a little stronger to drink in here?" he asked Natasha, lifting the bland bottled water he'd been given.
Heimdall glanced at Thor, who gave him a nod, then looked back to Natasha. "He is in a cave beneath what you on Midgard know as the Gobe desert."
Steve couldn't help but agree with the assessment. Tony felt amazing wrapped around him, and the sheer pleasure of that mingling with the harsh pain of the bites and the intrusive thrill of Logan's finger working him open all combined to make him feel dizzy. It was too much. He also didn't want it to stop for a second. Steve let his head fall forward, exposing the flesh of his shoulders gladly to Logan.
Fitz paced around Tony, memorizing specs and tapping notes into a pad in his hand. "There are so many variables," he muttered, obviously frustrated at the multiple trains of thought moving through his head. Realizing it sounded rather bleak, he cleared his throat and met Tony's gaze with a quick, forced smile. "Not that we can't handle all the variables because we can. All of them."
Natasha didn't even pause eating her popcorn at Clint's offended tone. "You're the one who sounds like a teenage girl right now, Clint," she pointed out with a raised eyebrow. It had gotten more or less the reaction she expected. It was good that at least he got the implication. It was also good to know that the pretty one was off the table. He was nice to look at, but he didn't seem like more than a fling. She tilted her head and regarded Clint entirely instead of looking at the screen. "I didn't say I was reading into anything. And I didn't say you were dating Coulson. I believe you just suggested it, actually." She shrugged and popped another piece of the popcorn into her mouth. "Would that really be so weird?"
"Plenty." Scott headed into the kitchen, his arm brushing against Clint's as he passed by. The contact felt electric, and he tried not to dwell. Instead he grabbed two beers and passed one to Clint. "I won't be offended if you don't finish it. Drinking on the job and everything. I just... this has been a pretty terrible... uh, year, actually. A terrible year," he mused, popping the top off on the edge of the counter and taking a healthy swig. Scott leaned back against the counter next to Clint and couldn't help looking the man over. "I'm sorry we haven't gotten a chance to talk much before under less dire circumstances."
Nat frowned. Despite her pain, the idea of her team in danger was enough to make her want to climb out of bed. "You need to talk to Coulson. To Fury." Nat let go of his hand and tried to sit up only to crumple back down with her eyes squeezed shut. "Make them understand. And if you see... if you see it in me, I want you to do the same thing."
"I can do that," Scott answered, and he knew he could with Logan. He knew he wouldn't get shut down or made fun of, and that was a rather large revelation. He let it sink in and smiled up at the other man. "That goes both ways. If I'm not comfortable with something, I'll tell you, or if I'd like to but not yet or... whatever. You don't have to sell what you want short because you think I might not be on board."
Steve shifted a little in his seat to force himself to pay attention and offered a flicker of a smile when Tony's gaze wandered in his direction. Maybe he didn't understand all of the concepts Tony was describing about renewable energy, but he still recognized that his friend was holding a room full of great minds rapt.
Logan started to try and stop Stark, then thought better of it. //Maybe he'll be easier to put up with if he's unconscious.//
Fury stared back and finally stepped aside to let the men into his office. "We have a potential target," he admitted, still watching the men warily. "But it's potential. The only info we really have comes from a man who's losing his damn mind."
Clint had almost immediately collapsed against Coulson, his face buried in the man's neck as he shook as he clung to his handler with what little strength he had. Having the hammer's influence ripped away from him had left him feeling vulnerable. The weapon had given him a sort of drive, had churned up his need for vengeance, his motivation to fight and persevere. Without it, he felt half broken as he fought back the memories of what Loki had done to him crashing in so close to what Creed had done to him. Hearing the exchange between Phil and the god, Clint drew away from Coulson enough to bare his teeth at Loki. "There's nothing you could say or do to make up for what you've done to us," he snarled, pulling himself up a little as anger overrode fatigue and good sense. "The things you made me do... I... I was supposed to kill you. You should be dead."
Thor nodded. "We will. This act of cowardice will not stand. And the Son of Coul and the Hawk will not be left to my brother's whims." He said the words softly, though. Even with Loki's most recent crimes, it was difficult to wrap his head around killing his brother. "The Lady Sif will accompany us. I... I do not wish to involve more of our friends in this grim task, necessary though it may be." He moved toward the door. "Let us go now. There is no reason for delay."
"Oh, I know a *great* place. Meet me on the corner of Fifth and Elm. I'll be there in ten." The phone beeped an end to its connection without so much as a goodbye from Tony or an attempt to get confirmation from Steve.
Fitz nodded until he could finish the huge bite of pizza. "The nanobots are coming along. They're more active than ever, and..." He continued on rambling in a bit too much detail about the specs until he realized that Steve was probably listening only to be polite and trailed off. "Er, well, it's an improvement."
"You got that philosophy about everything that's attached to ya?" Logan wanted to know, though his tone conveyed more good-natured ribbing than out-and-out hostility.
Clint started to refuse, then thought better of it. He felt like he'd just come back from ten missions rolled into one, and something to soothe his rattled nerves sounded like a good idea. Phil was doing a damned good job of it, but Clint felt he could use a boost. “Yeah, probably a good idea.”
Logan didn't let Scott move away until he'd grabbed a second kiss. "Be happy to help ya train," he agreed, forcing himself to let go of his lover. He moved to start dressing as Scott headed for the door. "Love ya, darlin'."
"Great," Steve answered, groaning and then kissing Tony's lips gently. "Fine. I'll go." It was the right thing to do even if he didn't particularly want to leave Tony's side. "You've gotta promise me you'll be good while you wait for me. I want to take you back to our room as soon as possible, and I just... I just want you better." He kissed Tony again, lingering until his sense of duty told him to get up and get moving. "Behave."
Clint was going to ask what the problem was, but Fury was already gone. He glanced at the monitor Fury had been staring at and felt the blood drain from his face. It was a list of SHIELD operatives from World War II. Sandwiched between a "Creed" and a "Keating" was the name James Howlett and a picture of a man who looked exactly like Logan. "Uh... that's... probably bad."
Logan took several moments to stare at Steve's powerful form tangled with Tony's lean-muscled body, the blonde with his lips parted beautifully, the billionaire with his dark hair mussed and sweat dampened, a few curls clinging to his damp skin. Then he couldn't resist anymore. Logan moved in again, letting his own aching shaft press against Tony's hip as the feral mutant teased Steve's ass crack with his fingertips. He had no intention of hampering the blonde, but Logan fully intended to have what he saw as his share before it was all said and done.
"I'd rather you be at Magneto's throat, but we can work on that," the woman answered, jerking her head down the hallway and meeting Sif's eyes. "Ready when you are. Banner? We might need the back up. Let's see how this goes." The Hulk was always a last resort, but he was a strong follow if they had need of it, uneasy as it made her. Bruce Banner was a good guy. The Hulk was a barely constrained monster. She preferred control whenever possible, and the potential chaos of his alter ego set her teeth on edge.
Having worked for SHIELD for a good decade plus, Clint rarely found himself surprised, but Steve's confessions left him fighting to keep his jaw from hitting the table. Not so much the "what" as the "who," of course. Then there was another struggle to keep from imagining a little too vividly what Steve and Tony would look like tangled around one another, not to mention a third participant in on the action. While Tony had never screamed "super manly," he also didn't seem the sort to be very careful about hiding any of his exploits. Clint's first thought was to ask how the sex was, but he remembered a moment later that Steve probably wouldn't appreciate an interrogation. "I w... uh... Well... That wasn’t what I was expecting. I can relate to that some, though," he admitted, his thoughts drifting to Nat. She had no reservations about tying him up and fucking him senseless, but she had a tendency to shy away if he tried to get close or get her to go on a date with him. He never really knew where he stood with her The one time he'd left her flowers, she'd never mentioned them. Clint knew Tony's reputation even if he didn’t know Logan’s. He could sure as hell relate to Steve's predicament. He furrowed his brow at the other man. "It's scarier to ask and possibly run them off than it is to just keep what you have, huh?"
Tony sighed, plating pancakes and putting them on the table. "Steve, I'm not used to taking care of other people. Not like that. Not when everything I decide could get them killed. Or I might have to tell them to get themselves killed. I can do that to myself, but..." Tony settled in front of his plate, still looking uncomfortable. "I'll bring it up. Maybe Fury's lost his mind in the past three days. That's the only way I can see him allowing it."
"Did he... does... has anybody told him what happened?" Scott looked sick and ashamed. The arms wrapped around the knees drawn against his chest tightened. Scott felt every last muscle in his body tense as he waited for an answer. Logan would hate him. How could he not?
If he hadn't been completely wrapped up in Scott and the way the man squirmed underneath him, Logan might have wondered at that particular statement. As it was, he took it as a compliment. Scott's eyes were beautiful, and Logan reflected it was a shame that he'd had to spend so much of his life covering them up. //At least I get to see 'em now,// he reflected, leaning in for more kisses as he began to fuck his lover with abandon. "Feel so good," he murmured, nipping roughly at the man's jaw, his throat. He wanted to watch Scott come undone, to see him arch and gasp and squirm underneath him in all the right ways.
"Fuck!" Logan gasped. Scott's eagerness was almost overwhelming. Lust-clouded eyes watched his cock disappear into Scott's mouth, and he fisted a hand into his lover's hair for a moment before letting go and resting it on the man's shoulder, willing to let him have control for the moment. "Fuck... feels good," he breathed. "Think... think I'm gonna need you to ride me before we're done here, though." He knew Scott was probably still sore, but if he was going to get locked up for awhile...
Scott considered and shrugged, "Beer." When Logan looked at him like he'd sprouted a second head, he shrugged, "When in Rome. Anyway, I think I've earned some breakfast hour binging considering." He was honestly hoping that the shit he'd been through meant he'd exhausted the whole of his bad karma for the year. "Y'know how I know I did the right thing leaving? When Coulson talked about somebody checking in from the mansion, he said it was the professor."
Clint's eyebrows raised a little. "Uh, he's bi?" When he got a nod, it suddenly got more awkward that he'd been running around in Phil's suite in nothing but his underwear and a t-shirt, and the fact that the guy had seen video of them-  //Speaking of which.// "Did you know he, uh..." Clint cleared his throat, as his voice seemed to have gone up a little in pitch. "He had to monitor me after the whole thing with Loki, and apparently he... You know... he knows about the women's underwear," he finally finished in almost a whisper, looking away and turning as red as he ever got.
Thinking back to the previous night made Clint want to tell Phil he didn't have to wait another goddamn minute, but he bit back the urge. Diving into bed with one person after another was a habit he was trying to break, not reinforce. Realizing a moment later that Coulson was also handing him a pretty big compliment, Clint had the duck his head and shrug. "I think I might be," he said, shyly tugging at a blade of grass. Clint wasn't accustomed to people telling him he was good looking, but he was more than comfortable with how he looked naked. He looked up, still slightly flushed, and gave his handler a smile. "I think you might be, too."
The sounds Steve made as he came and the heat of his release gushing over Tony's fingers was more than enough to push him over the edge. Tony's throaty moans filled the room as he spilled himself generously inside his lover, his hand keeping a deathgrip on the couch. The last few tremors of orgasm ripped through him before he finally drew away, grabbing Steve by the waist and dragging him down to lay back in the lush carpet. He pulled the blonde into a slow kiss, then sagged back against the carpet to pant for air. "Not only do I love you, but you are one incredibly hot lay," he managed between gulps of air.
Scott nodded his agreement. "I imagine she'll have a tidal wave for awhile... but I bet she'd like to see you." They'd survived at least the first part of captivity together. It made sense to think Natsha might appreciate some time with someone who understood the experience even if she wasn't the sentimental type. "You want to head up there to wait, or do something else? Sky's the limit." Waiting was always the hardest part, and he wanted to do what he could to take the edge off.
"I like you," Logan decided, giving Sif a smile. He dragged Scott into a long kiss, audience be damned. He didn't know when or if he'd see his lover again, and he wasn't going to worry about someone feeling a little uncomfortable. "Be careful," he said. "You'll be fine."
"Oh, yes, of course." Blushing furiously, Jemma hurried back to the doorway to the building. She knew it wasn't exactly her division to go flitting off to other planets, but she couldn't help but be fascinated by the idea of at least seeing the process.
Natasha took her hand away from the gun in her thigh holster as some of the tension drained from the room. It was a good thing that Steve wasn't stepping down. Physically changed or not, the man was still the glue that kept them from falling apart. "C'mon, Stark. Play nice. The lab rats would be pretty sad if they didn't get to play with your toys anymore." She tried to make the words sound casual, but only an idiot would think they really were.
Tony was relieved to see Steve sitting up and wearing a smile instead of a mask, even if the expression was uncertain. Tony's was far less so. The second the door latched, he stood and walked to Steve's bed, settling on the edge of it. "I'm pretty much fine to walk now,” he assured when he caught the look on Steve’s face, “but don't tell Coulson. He's my limo driver until I'm 'better'," he said, mischief in his eyes. When Steve didn't seem to perk up much at the humor, Tony sobered as well. "Hey." He leaned in when the blonde looked up, pressing a slow, gentle kiss to his lips. "You look terrified." The observation was meant, of course, to invite whatever venting Steve needed to do.
Bruce frowned, nodding his head. "I see what you mean." He tapped at the screen, looked at his tablet, adjusted some numbers, and frowned again. He ran his first adjustment through the simulator and winced when the reaction went a direction that was all too familiar. "No," he said shakily, erasing the attempt with a swipe of his hand. "We don't need two of me." He gnawed on his lower lip, poking and prodding at the formula. "One of you better bring me coffee. This could take awhile."
Scott chuckled. He could understand that well. "It's possible that I've been accused of being a worrier once or twice."
"Aspirin. All of it. Maybe water. Then all the coffee," Scott decided with a slow nod. He wanted to grab Logan and drag him back over into an embrace, but he didn't dare. The way he felt, he'd puke on the man instead of putting the moves on him. "I might even manage to get up and get those things myself any minute now." He hated to be too optimistic when it came to hangovers. Scott rarely drank in excess, and when he did, it hit him hard. "Y'know, if I'd kept my promise after that first time I got blackout drink in college and never drank again, I'd probably feel a fuck of a lot better right now."
Logan hesitated a moment, then pushed another button. "Think I'll stay in my room. Your talking walls weird me out."
Steve was finding it difficult to breathe or think, and oddly enough Thor's brash display gave him a sharp moment of focus. "We will. As soon as we find them." He rose on shaky legs and was on the verge of leading Thor downstairs - he suspected the same image was being broadcast to the rest of the display screens in the building as well - when the camera pulled back yet again and another figure came into view. Seconds later the audio cut in along with the image. "That's... that's Bucky." Whether he agreed with Coulson or not about the likelihood of the man still being at all himself, it was impossible to see that face and not react. "Which means that Hydra definitely has Tony, and we have to get him out of there."
Tony, his dulled senses clearing, glanced down to find that he was tied down to a metal table wearing nothing but the bandages around his healing ribs. "Well, I hope you're charging for this," he said, making light of a dire situation. "A live streaming of Tony Stark in the buff could net you millions." Tony peered at the other man, recognition sparking as the mist obscuring his thoughts cleared. "Bucky?" There was no doubt about it. Tony remembered the soldier's image from Steve's file. "Care to tell me what the hell is going on?"
Steve had regained just enough brain function to lift a finger. "No. Absolutely not." He fell limp against the bed again a second later. "Besides, I'm pretty sure we agreed to not give each other heart attacks. That means no suit-powered wheelchairs. Ever." Steve took some of the sting out of the comments by rolling over and lazily kissing Tony while stroking fingers up and down his arm. "You have to admit, the upside of this is that we've more or less spent SHIELD-sanctioned time in bed together having sex all day."
Logan didn't mind the babbling at all. Knowing he could make someone as controlled as Scott go completely incoherent with just a touch was actually kind of a huge ego boost. "I like that plan. I think we should definitely do that," Logan agreed with a broad grin, watching Scott's lean muscles contract as the man worked to gain more friction, a pleasure which Logan teasingly denied. Instead, he captured Scott's lips in another kiss as his fingers teasingly slid into the fly of Scott's boxers, stroking fleetingly across the man's cock here and there without offering any sort of real relief.
"Please," Tony said, waiting until the door was shut behind Phil before he looked into Steve's eyes again. He gently ran a hand down Steve's chest. The blankets and sheets over him padded the touch a little, but it wasn't hard to tell that there was much less of him there than before. "Steve, I don't know what you're thinking this means about us, but I have a feeling it's negative." He looked hard into the watery blue eyes. "Stop it. I'm not leaving you. I'm not gonna stop loving you, and I'm not gonna stop trying to get the serum back, but that's for you, not for me. You got it?"
They found the guards in the other room staring at the Hulk warily from the opposite side of the room. Natasha let her appreciation of their intelligence tick up a notch. "Hey, big guy," she began, carefully moving in a bit closer. Her own experiences with the Hulk had been somewhat less than pleasant. "We need to see about calming down and getting home. The sooner we do, the sooner we get to go find Loki and smash him into paste."
A new gun appeared, and the next shot was for Tony. By the time the Winter Soldier scooped him up from the bed, he was out cold.
Steve laughed aloud at that and agreed at last. "You've got it. I'll bring you guys lunch, okay?" That would give the group a break and let him slip in without it being some kind of juvenile deal with him going to hang out with his boyfriend. "Now go and work before I start kissing you. We both know we're not gonna stop if it comes to that." As it was, his fingers itched to grab Tony and drag him back into bed.
It was Simmon's turn to snort. She waved a hand dismissively. "Oh, we'd done that ages ago. Back in school. We weren't able to make a prototype at the time because of limitations in terms of materials, but... honestly, it isn't that complicated once you see it laid out."
Tony had to fight to keep from getting up and following Steve into the cell. He wasn't sure if the gun would work like an electrical conduit, possibly draining them both, and that held him back. More casualties was not the goal of their mission. He realized with a jolt that he almost wanted to volunteer to take Steve's place. Theatrics aside, he knew that no one, Steve least of all, would allow it. "Nat, shut up and let him help you," he finally snapped.
"Sounds good," Clint said, feeling the weariness of keeping constantly alert seeping into his bones even after a jolt of caffeine. The stuff was more comfort than stimulant anymore. It had been a long day, and being on edge for so long left the expert marksman more exhausted than he cared to admit. "I'm going to need my rest if I'm going to keep an eye on Fitz for you." The whole idea of bringing someone in to help Barnes made Clint uneasy. He just hoped his own dire prediction of what might happen did not come to fruition.
Victor smirked, holding Clint up off the floor as the man struggled. "Awful scrawny for such a massive pain in the ass," he observed.
It didn't even occur to Tony to pull away from the god. He was too far gone to think of anything but how fucking gorgeous Loki looked when he came, how good it felt to be buried in the god's hot depths. Tony shifted back a little, his hands clamping onto Loki's slender hips as he started thrusting hard, holding nothing back. It took little more to drive Tony over the edge, and he cried out unreservedly as he came hard. As the orgasm passed, Tony slowly relaxed, sagging to one side of his partner, panting with nothing but bliss on his face as he savored the afterglow.
The drive was a quiet one except for Tony's usual stream of mostly inappropriate observations. Steve appreciated the chatter in a way since it distracted him somewhat from being furious. He was mad at Logan for hurting Tony and mad at himself for not being more careful to start with - not to mention not noticing that Tony was hurt. By the time they'd been in to see Tony's doctor and the wound had been both stitched up and pronounced in a rather annoyed tone by the doctor to be "not that bad," Steve was almost over being angry and had moved on to uncertainty and self recrimination. The silence that began to stretch out uncomfortably in the car was broken by his cell phone ringing. Steve picked up at once when he saw that it was Director Fury. He opened his mouth to greet the man politely, but was promptly cut off.
Even though he knew it was both a touchy subject and a difficult one, Coulson finally asked, "Has anyone been to see Summers and Logan."
"Square deal." Scott laughed quietly and took a long pull off of the beer. "I'm about to go to jail - you know what I mean. I'm getting a last drink. You're cute - I'm pretty sure you know that - and I've heard that you're into guys sometimes, so... I was wondering if you might be interested in having some fun before we go downstairs and I start getting the psych eval to end all psych evals. Because if I have to do that, doing it stone cold sober and sexually frustrated just doesn't sound like fun." Scott could hear the words coming out of his mouth, and he meant them wholeheartedly, but they didn't make sense. He couldn't figure out why they felt like they did. He couldn't figure out exactly why it was a good idea to hit on Clint when he was still aching from his encounter with Logan not an hour before.
"I might. For awhile anyway." Scott didn't want to make any promises he couldn't keep, but the idea of having a home base again was a comforting one. He liked being settled. "I used to be mad at you for leaving them. Us. I get it now. There's no good way or good time to get away when you need to. You just have to go." He'd tried several times to subtly extricate himself but had always been drawn back in by the professor or someone else. In the end running made the most sense. He'd finally gotten the distance he needed. "I never expected I'd see you again out saving the world with a team. Decide you play well with others after all?"
"Not an inaccurate statement," Coulson agreed. He finally allowed, "If you think you can handle yourself with some small measure of comportment, the media probably would like to see you there."
Clint kicked away, leaving just a few shreds of the garment intact, blue eyes defiant. Anything he could do to stall would give them more opportunities to get out of this mess. Clint growled in pain, though, when Victor kicked him and shoved him to his face on the floor.
Bruce leveled a smile at the young scientist that was far bigger and more genuine than he'd thought himself capable of. "You know, Fury wasn't exaggerating when he said you two are geniuses," he said. He pulled her into a quick hug, then grinned sheepishly. "Sorry. Just... you gave me a reason to smile. And I'm proud of you guys. You think Fitz'll freak out if I hug him, too?"
Tony let his instincts guide his actions as he sucked hungrily at Loki's tongue. He was surprised at the gentle treatment. Loki could have been as rough and brutal as he wanted, but instead he was offering his prisoner pleasure. Tony let his fingers dip lower, finding Loki's entrance and stroking at it lightly. When the god made no protest, he slowly pressed one finger in. The digit slid in easily, but Loki still gripped him tightly, and Tony moaned a little louder into Loki's mouth, his free hand running up and down Loki's back.
Clint squeezed his eyes shut, steadying his breathing. The shake in Coulson's voice and the feel of the man's cock filling his throat had him rock hard and light headed. Trying to focus on his breath, Clint doubled his efforts to take Phil all the way down, letting the man's shaft slide a little deeper with every bob of his head. It was a struggle, and by the time his lips were wrapped around the base of Phil's cock, his face was streaked with tears. He drew back, slid back down, and managed to establish a rhythm. That done, he grabbed the wrist of one of the hands resting on his shoulder and placed it on the back of his head, looking up at the man as he slowly took Phil down again, silently offering him permission to take control if he wanted.
Steve felt like he could finally breathe again when the door to Tony's room closed behind him. He tried to be as quiet as possible, not wanting to wake the man if he was resting. Naturally when he arrived, he found Tony propped up in bed tapping away at his tablet. The sight brought a smile to his lips, and Steve leaned against the door frame to watch. "I'm pretty sure you're supposed to be resting." Apart from a few bumps, bruises, and scrapes that would heal up quickly, medical had been satisfied that Steve was in one piece.
Loki ignored the question, pacing slowly before Stark for a moment and then pausing. He raised a hand, and even with limited energy, it was easy enough to send the chains currently holding Tony aloft away from their moorings. The chains tangled against themselves instead, leaving Tony free in part, his hands bound before him. The man fell like a puppet with his strings cut, but Loki made no move to assist him. The freedom itself seemed like a rather large gift. The rest Stark could figure out for himself when he had the strength. "If by adopted he meant that I was stolen from my home after my father abandoned me, then, no, I suppose it isn't so terribly unusual. I still don't... Odin says that my father Laufey, the king of the Frost Giants. I do not know who my mother is. His wife, perhaps, or... my ability to appear Asgardian suggests that there may be more to the story, but no one has seen fit to tell it to me. None who can still live or speak to me if they do."
Tony's mouth was a thing of beauty. The guy could, of course, talk his way out of or into anything under the sun. It was electrifying to learn that Tony was just as talented with his lips when they were doing something productive. "Christ, Tony, that's..." He shuddered and held Tony by the hair, unable to let go of him. Steve resisted the urge to force the action. It would've been cruel when Tony was doing so perfectly without any intervention. "Just keep... just do that. Whatever you're doing, do that..." The man shifted and took Steve even deeper. The blond let out a hearty gasp. "That!"
"I think that was a Twilight joke. It was, wasn't it? Shit." Darien sighed as he gingerly sat down on one of the barstools. It wasn't a good idea to scream "bottom" in a bar full of guys in leather, but he couldn't really help it. "Beer. Something that doesn't taste like sweat socks. Thanks." He looked to Clint as the bartender selected a bottle and handed it over. "You could've warned me I was going to look like a townie trying to go clubbing."
"Still nice to know." Phil honestly wasn't sure how to explain it. He knew that until he had a few hours to do nothing but scrub off several layers of skin, he wasn't even going to feel halfway down the road to normal. It was hard to realize that Clint still looked at him with such affection when he wasn't in the mood to be around himself. The feeling of Clint against him was warm and reassuring. It was the strongest reminder of the need to survive he could ever hope for. He considered saying a hundred different things and let them all go. It wasn't their last chance. They weren't going to die, and he wasn't going to tell Clint Barton he was in love with him while there was so much other baggage attached to it. They deserved a better memory and a better time. "I don't suppose you've acquired any new ninja skills involving taking down walls with nothing but floor mats and shredded shirts?"
"Not a problem. You would've done the same, I hope." Steve managed a smile and tried to mean it. "We’ll do everything we can to make you both safe, Logan." Though it was a small gesture in the grand scheme of things, he suggested, "I could get Scott a message from you if you like."
Before Logan even had a chance to say no, Stark was on his feet, "Sounds good." Tony grabbed Steve's arm just as the lights in the room went down, highlighting the dancefloor with spotlights of various colors. "You ever danced to music like this?" he asked the blonde as the beat got slower but no less charged. He pulled the taller man close and gave Steve his best bad boy grin, the one that could always keep Pepper from staying mad at him for more than a few seconds, the same one that had him taking his pick of who he brought home anytime he wanted it. His hands were on Steve's hips, holding him bare inches from his own body as he showed Steve how to move.
"Let's go talk to Director Fury." He was tired of waiting. Things were spiraling out of control, and soon they'd be down to base SHIELD agents for the mission. Without the Avengers and with the aid of the X-Men precarious at best, Coulson wasn't willing to take that chance. That wasn't how they would beat Loki. He waved off the secretary's attempt to call Fury and knocked directly on the man's door instead. When it opened, Coulson nodded a quick greeting. "Director, I think we need to move on this. Now."
Obviously not willing to be put off what she considered the task at hand, a sharp-faced older woman countered, "How long have you and Tony Stark been together?"
For a moment Steve looked trapped, but he relaxed quickly. It was strange how easy it actually was to relax around Clint. Considering the fact that the man knew almost as many ways to kill someone as Nat and seemed to enjoy employing them just as much, he should have been intimidating at best. Instead Steve found himself relatively at ease with the man. He hesitated before stepping in a little closer. "I'm guessing you haven't seen the latest memo from Fury?" Steve had finally gotten the hang of checking email on his phone after several coaching sessions with Tony, and Fury's memo about "appropriate public behavior" had been none-too-subtle especially when coupled with the entertainment headlines of the day that showed just how little good SHIELD's efforts to cover up the video had done. "Last night got a little crazy."
"Yeah? Hmm... I may have to look into that. There is this one guy I was kind of hoping to impress. I wonder if he digs scars," Coulson mused with a smile. He didn't really mind the scar, didn't really mind any of his scars. He just didn't care for the questions that the one on his chest reminded him of. There were too many dark corners in SHIELD, but Phil was used to knowing them all. He didn't like being kept in the dark himself. "I look forward to learning all of his too. Just let me know if you want any stories about the one on my calf where I fell out of a tree as a kid or anything. It's exciting stuff."
"I'm glad you like it. Pretty sure I couldn't not worry. It's kind of what I do." Steve laughed quietly and let his hand drift to rest on Tony's stomach. The warm, quiet moments were almost too sweet. He knew the world would intrude with a thousand new problems soon enough, but he relished the time they had in the meanwhile. "You got me started worrying before I even liked you. Apparently it's your superpower."
Logan could hear Clint's accelerated heartrate as they discussed Loki further. The man looked completely calm, but Logan could smell the tang of fear in the archer's sweat. His gaze drifted to Coulson, then to Widow, and he tilted his head. "Y'know, I'm not a fan o' not knowin' everything I'm gettin' into. Been burned that way a few times. What're you three not tellin' me?" His eyes moved to meet Clint's for a moment before fixing pointedly on Coulson. "What's got him scared outta his mind?"
"This way, big guy. Catch the puny mutant!" Quicksilver taunted, moving back from Bruce's reach with every swipe. He laughed as the Hulk roared his frustration, luring him away from Loki.
Logan smirked, thinking back to when Steve and Tony had found him in his hiding place in Japan. "Yeah, he's almost gotten worse than that. A lot worse," he said, feeling faintly satisfied at the memory of the look of terror on the abrasive billionaire's face.
"Maybe a little," Clint agreed, his hands sliding from Phil's shoulders and down to hook his fingers into the man's belt loops to get leverage for a far more suggestive shift of his hips. Thinking back to the encounter in the club made it difficult to resist doing otherwise. "I thought at first I was just gonna get you all flustered again," he breathed.
"Tomorrow." They'd already sewn some chaos - a few issues in crowded areas, a few scenes. It was just a warning to SHIELD that they were bloodied but unbowed. Loki smiled coldly. He was done playing nicely with the Avengers. He didn't want to see them dead, necessarily, he wanted to see them well and truly broken. "Apparently taking away their Captain wasn't enough. They have a new leader now. I think we should give him a proper welcome." He turned his piercing gaze to Victor, and the smile widened. "The Iron Man is mine, but he isn't alone in needing to be taught a lesson. You will collect the archer and his handler. It seems I didn't kill him thoroughly enough last time. Perhaps you could take care of that for me?"
Clint slapped Scott's ass hard. "For when I'm good and ready," he growled, admiring the reddening handprint that quickly rose on Scott's skin. He couldn't miss the bruised finger marks on his partner's ass, and he ran his fingers over them. "Hmm... someone really likes it rough," he observed, digging his fingers into the already bruised flesh and dragging Scott back towards him. It probably should have scared the hell out of him or at least made him think twice, but instead it gave Clint a thrill knowing that he was about to lay claim to someone Logan had clearly marked as his own. With a shaky moan, Clint let his cock slide along the crevice of Scott's ass, taking a moment to build a little anticipation. His free hand fumbled for a bottle of lube he’d spotted off to the side, and he gave himself a few strokes with slick fingers.
"The edible kind," Clint decided, tugging his vest back on and following Coulson. Getting the look that told him that wasn't going to cut it from Coulson, he sighed. "I don't know... Uhm, mac and cheese? Bacon? I think I have some Snickers bars in the cupboard back in my room," he rambled, talking through it as he tried to decide on something. He hadn't eaten in almost as long as he hadn't slept, and it left everything sounding amazing. "I'd also go for something cooked on the stove. Italian?" He paused, then nodded as they moved into the kitchen. "Yeah. Cheese. And pasta."
"Can't say I didn't warn you." It was awful to admit even to himself but Steve half hoped things would stay status quo for an afternoon so he had the luxury to simply be there for Tony. There were distinct downsides to being Captain America. "For now I'm all yours. Consider it your early birthday present."
Loki thrilled at the sound, at what it meant. It was a sound of desire and, thus, of surrender. Breaking the kiss for barely a breath, Loki drew his tunic off and tossed it aside before recapturing Stark's mouth. Loki had often wondered how mortals managed any real skill when it came to sex with so few years in which to learn it all. His pants riding low on his hips, Loki rocked himself against Stark. He was only half hard, the arousal building slowly. The entire scene was oddly quiet and gentle considering his normal trysts.
"I think I could probably be alright with that," Phil agreed. He couldn't quite bring himself to let go of Clint's cock right away. Only when he realized that Clint had other plans, that he'd clearly stated those plans, and that if he didn't let go Clint couldn't move forward with the plans did Phil finally manage to loose his grip. "Be happy to return the favor, just for the record." He savored the thought, actually, the idea of watching Clint fall apart.
Tony nodded, well pleased. He looked the files over, looking honestly impressed. "Fitz. You're actually a scientist, then," he remarked.
"Hey, you realize there's kind of a global emergency right now, right?" Clint barked. "We don't have time for you kids to go make out somewhere, O Glorious Leader."
The words were enough to wrench a smile from Coulson. He knew Clint was attempting his own blunt-force way of being comforting. He might not mean it, but it was still nice to hear. Phil shook his head and smiled back at Clint, a genuine expression of gratitude for the attempt. "It's fine. I wanted her to be happy, and she is. Engaged, last I heard." By 'heard' he meant the last time he'd used SHIELD's resources to keep tabs on his former lover. "But thank you. It'll happen. Right time, right place, right person." He wasn't sure he believed it after so long, but it felt better to at least pretend than to admit defeat outright. Phil wasn't an optimist, but he wasn't a quitter either.
Steve stopped just long enough for Tony to get a grip. As badly as he wanted to push the man to the his limits, Steve didn't want him hurt more. He met Tony's dark eyes and began to bob his head in slow, steady rhythm designed to tease but not fulfill all of his needs. He wanted to take Tony's mind off his injuries for as long as they both managed to last.
"It would be a sin," Scott agreed with a warm smile. "Feels like the world's gotten turned upside down. I guess that's why it was easier to fall in with Logan. We don't really fit, but I... I know him. It was easier." Scott shrugged and glanced back up at Clint to measure his reaction. "If you take me to the infirmary, I'm going to end up in a cell, right?" He held up a hand before Clint could protest. "I'm going either way. Just level with me. It's probably what I'd do to keep my team safe."
Steve gasped and wondered whether there were security cameras in the room only to realize it was stupid to question it. Of course there were. Somewhere some SHIELD security guard was getting a show. He shrugged it off as being entirely unimportant when Tony's mouth felt so good. "Your mouth is beautiful," he half-whispered into the otherwise quiet room. Steve's thighs began to tremble. He ignored that too and kept his back pressed tightly against the wall for stability.
Clint shrugged, still staring at the countertop to keep the light from getting him. "Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria... He's the god of mischief. Oh, and also, I hear he wants his own personal planet and slave race. So there's that." He looked up, squinting bloodshot eyes at Darien from under his hoodie. "Please tell me there's coffee now."
Tony drained his wine glass and put it on the table, never one to waste alcohol. "Well, that's no big deal; meetings are boring as hell, anyway." He leaned into Steve's touch and then ran a hand down the man's chest. "But that is fair, I guess. You naked on my workbench might stop me from doing the things that I suppose I technically should be doing. Not to mention you might get a literal screwdriver somewhere it doesn't belong."
Logan raised his head to watch Scott, trying to keep from thrusting up into the man's mouth. He figured Scott had probably taken enough abuse, and judging by the bruises on his lover's hips, Clint likely hadn't used kid gloves on any part of Scott. The hand in Scott's hair moved away, trailing over the man's shoulders, sliding over his arm, tracing his ear and jawline. Logan wanted to cement the moment in his mind: Scott looking up at him with beautifully darkened blue eyes as his throbbing shaft slowly disappeared into the man's throat.
Clint offered his first real smile. "A van? You do know we've got Tony Stark, right?" he asked, moving fast and without a sound as he led Darien toward their ride. Clint knew that the other man would probably be unable to keep pace with him or move as effectively in a fight, and the marksman wanted to get them the hell out of there as fast as possible. Fortunately, they had a lovely piece of Stark tech right on the other side of the wall. Clint helped haul Darien over the barrier, then followed himself, dropping from it and landing easily on the other side. As he straightened, one easy motion drew his bow and launched an arrow at an incoming Agency goon. The man, silhouetted against the moonlight, dropped soundlessly.
"Sure. Of course." Steve drew away a little but wouldn't let go entirely, his hand clinging to Tony's. He knew she only needed so much access and made a note to bring the woman flowers for not batting an eyelash.
It would have made things a lot easier if that smile didn't send his pulse skyrocketing or if he was entirely immune to the warmth of Tony's hands gripping his hips. Steve had been a decent dancer once upon a time, but that was a whole different time and a whole different kind of dancing. This particular brand of dancing seemed less like dance and more like grinding on the dancefloor in a manner that Steve would have normally relegated entirely to the bedroom. Trying very, very hard not to think about whether Tony moved just as well between the sheets, Steve said, "You should be careful about pushing Logan so hard. He might not take it as well as Bruce and I do." It took time to develop a thick skin to Tony's oddly insightful brand of insults.
Logan nodded quietly, fetching aspirin and a glass of water from the bathroom and bringing the pair to Scott before setting the coffee maker to brew a pot for the pair of them. He knew that Stark's pet wall-computer would've done it for him, but asking that thing to wait on him weirded Logan out a little too much. Machines made him nervous when they were smart enough to give him sass. "Well, I think you needed a drink or seven last night," Logan said, squinting at the coffee maker and jabbing at another button before nodding with satisfaction as it gurgled to life. //No wonder Stark likes to talk to things. He put enough goddamned buttons on here for a scientific calculator.// "You'll be fine. Coffee. Maybe a banana or somethin'."
Clint's breath huffed out through his nostrils as Nat drew away, watching her with hungry, chastened eyes, though a moment later he smirked faintly at the jab she made at Darien. It was a complete turnaround from the self-assured, reckless bravado Clint had shown Darien so far. He wanted her, then and there, but he knew better than to make demands. He settled for closing the renewed distance between himself and the leather-clad redhead, close enough to let her feel the heat from his body. Remembering then that Nat wasn't the only one in the room and that Darien had suggested leaving, the archer looked sharply at the other man. "I didn't say you could go," he snapped, his gaze immediately hardening.
"Done. It would make me a pretty bad boyfriend if I let you starve to death." Steve felt fairly confident in calling Tony that after the previous night and kissing in front of the whole team. "I'll also bring some coffee that isn't carbon dated." He looked down at his mug. "This is pretty awful, and that's from a guy who's lived on camp coffee in a war zone."
Tony was quick to follow, putting a hand out and grabbing Logan's shoulder. "Hey, look--" He didn't really get a good read on what happened next. One minute, he was on his feet, the next he was pressed against a wall, Logan's hand tangled in his shirt, with an uncomfortably close view of some very sharp blades.
Fitz nodded his eager agreement. "The gun will work. There's no question about that. Sir. Mr. Stark is right, it should be foolproof." The only question - and the one they all knew was hanging freely in the air - was whether the gun working would also be enough to kill Loki.
"I'm really, really okay with that. Not that I'm trying to plan things out too much, but do you think you might like to get some stuff and crash with me again tonight? I promise I'm not propositioning you, but I think there's a good chance we'll be up early enough to see the sun rise." If Loki had things planned, he doubted the god would wait until a decent hour to unroll his evil schemes. "To be honest, I sleep better when you're close."
Bruce sighed, obviously out of patience as far as correcting Tony's lack of... everything. He was toying with biochemistry models, running simulations. "Tony..."
Darien stared at the man's outstretched hand skeptically for a moment before shrugging and taking it. "Darien Fawkes. You already know that, of course." As he withdrew his hand, he allowed, "My former line of work involved a lot more breaking and entering and a lot fewer bodily fluids. Not big on blood, but I'm not too proud to admit I'd prefer it be theirs than mine." He'd worked hard to try and get past being entirely self serving, but self preservation was a basic part of humanity. Darien was pretty sure that people who didn't think of themselves first at least most of the time lacked the will to really live. "So what now? I follow you out of here and SHIELD tells the Agency to stick it where the sun don't shine?" He supposed it didn't really matter who was holding the leash if he still had to wear a damn collar.
Bruce couldn't help a faint snicker at that as he helped himself, grabbing a couple of sandwiches for himself and retreating to a corner.
"All I've ever wanted," Tony assured, his fingers trailing up to Steve's. The man was definitely more or less back to fighting form, a thought that was a surprising relief. "I wish none of it had happened, either. God, if I'd known I'd be getting back to you, I never would've let him touch me," he murmured. He knew he might still have been compelled to do so, forced under the idea that Coulson and Barton would otherwise be disposed of. But that was a whole other scenario. Tony leaned in for a tentative kiss, not wanting to push. "I need you, Steve, and I love you."
"Brilliant!" Simmons exclaimed with obvious excitement. It was a relief to hear that they were taking a firm step away from the idea of Tony wielding the weapon. "We're trying to find a way to mitigate the effects. That way even if you're the one wielding it... well, maybe you can get more than one shot it. We hate to put all our eggs in one basket, so to speak."
Also, I have no chill and have almost all the rest of the chapters for Part 1 edited, so you'll have 'em all before long. I keep trying to space them out, but I fail at patience.
Clint couldn't help but smile a little. As rarely as they got to enjoy each other on a more physical level, it was even more uncommon that they got to simply enjoy each other's company. "I think that sounds great. We'll go with your place. Mine is a mess." It sounded amazing to get a chance to let his brain unwind a bit, maybe pass out on Nat's couch.
After they'd all been hunched over working in relative silence for awhile, Simmons rose and stretched with a sigh. "Coffee run! Would anyone else like something?"
"And, yes, we wish your help in killing him. We brought him in last time. It didn't work out. We need to eliminate the threat," Natasha answered, gaze cool and measured. "I'm guessing you've realized that at this point. If he can use you to rule in his stead and control you, threaten your mother, kill Tony... it's off the rails. There's no end game that doesn't involve him dead in my book."
"Oh, well said." Loki rounded the corner, battle armor set aside for his no-less-ostentatious day wear. "That's a good description of what this is. I want to see how far you can be pushed before you break. The mind control was fun, of course, but it didn't give me a good idea of your natural talents and abilities. I'd like to remedy that. I was actually thinking of bringing in one more specimen. Tell me, which of your friends do you think would be a good choice? I'm afraid Mr. Banner is more of a handful than I'm interested in dealing with... but that still leaves some very intriguing possibilities. Who would you sacrifice this time?"
Logan raised an eyebrow, looking understandably skeptical. "Honestly, I'm better at death and dismemberment." When Coulson didn't offer any alternatives, Logan sighed. "Alright. Fine, but I don't care if it's a whole busload o' orphans, if ya ask me to dress in drag, I'm out." He wasn't honestly sure he could manage to resist the urge to kill a whole bunch of people if he was presented with slavers at their "best," but he was willing to try and play along.
Logan was already up and bringing back a frosted bottle with the cap off. "Things not so great in New York, huh?" He settled in his recliner again, a beer of his own in hand. He tilted his head at Scott. He'd taken Scott's haunted look as an artifact of his captivity, but it now occurred to Logan that the other man might have been dealing with an entirely different set of baggage. "You're safe here, at any rate. I don't think they're gonna throw you out if they wanna keep me around."
Steve sat down tentatively on the other end of the sofa and swallowed. "Uh, no. I haven't dated... uh, a lot." //At all,// he added silently to himself. By the time he'd had much of a chance with anyone, the opportunity hadn't been there anymore. There had been Peggy, but the second they found their common ground he'd ended up on ice for far too long. A tantalizing snippet of last night's feature dream played itself back inside his head and Steve blushed yet again. He was starting to think he'd never manage to spend more than five minutes with Tony without looking like a tomato. "No one special. We can't all be as lucky as you are with Pepper."
"Right... yeah, it... would be," Steve agreed. He barely knew what he was saying. Only the thought that the reporters might not have left kept him from groaning as Tony's hand fell to exactly the right spot. His hips showed less restraint, and Steve thrust instinctively into the other man's grip. Sounding more certain, he agreed, "We shouldn't walk till we've worked this out." Steve watched with open appreciation as Tony worked his belt and fly open in no time flat. "You're really, really good at that. I'm not gonna think about why. Just gonna enjoy it."
Clint laughed, more heartily this time. "Yeah? I've got one from getting my leg tangled in the trapeze as a kid," he said with a smirk. "But I think that guy of yours digs scars, but not as much as the whole package, I'm betting," he said, gracefully sliding a leg across Phil's legs and settling across the man's lap. He looked down at his handler, still smirking with just a hint of cockiness. "Maybe we can compare, count them up and see who has more," he decided, slowly tugging his shirt up over his head and tossing it aside.
Victor woke from a sound sleep, frowning and wondering who the hell it could be. Loki never knocked, and no one else had the nerve to bother him when he was in his room. Wearing nothing but his pants, Victor opened the door to find Loki in the same state of dress and looking... well, blue. The mutant tilted his head at the god, raising an eyebrow. "Something I can help you with, boss?" he asked. He wanted to ask about the god's change of skin tone but figured it was one of those things best left unmentioned.
Logan had the decency to feel a little awkward at that. //Might, actually,// he thought to himself, but kept his mouth shut. He absently wondered how the gash in Tony's back was healing up but didn't figure it was appropriate to ask. "Yeah, you wouldn't think so, just to meet 'em," he put in, hoping that was enough to avoid raising suspicion. "And she's right. He's worse, the better you get to know 'im."
Scott picked up a shot and tossed it back. "It was Halloween," he explained with a hint of a smile. "And I have great legs." He thought for a moment and tried to think of something interesting. "I've never had a threesome."
Bruce nodded slowly. "Agreed." He paused, then shrugged. "Maybe we could get Sif or Thor to volunteer? With full disclosure, of course," he amended. He quirked a faint smile. "Maybe they could see fit to let us lowly mortals in on a few secrets. Or we could ask Loki nicely." He paused. "For the record? I think that's the strangest thing I've ever said. 'Ask Loki nicely.' Sounds more like a punchline. Just when I thought being part of the Avengers couldn't get any weirder."
"Good. Then we're fine." Phil wasn't sure it was true, but he honest to god hoped it was. Logan was an asset, and Scott could be a huge help to them once he was settled in. They were both good allies to have. He paused and decided it was as good a time as any to let them know where he and Clint had gone. "Barton and I took a little drive, ended up in Westchester. Jean told me to let you know that you're missed."
Sensing that Fury was done with them, Clint turned and left, though he waited until Phil caught up with him. "So how're you going to do it? Get hold of Scott without Logan noticing?"
"I think I do... and I think that's about all I want to know," Steve added warningly. If allowed, he knew Tony would clue him in to everything, and he still needed to be able to look the man in the eye when giving him orders. "I'm sure you know more than enough for both of us." He made a mental note to watch just how handsy he got with Tony in front of the man just in case. Sharing with Logan had been fun... once. He wasn't sure he was interested in doing it again. Steve was starting to like having Tony just to himself. "The car was definitely fun. Anywhere it's just the two of us is pretty nice, actually. You're pretty nice."
Clint's smile was faint but genuine. He leaned in to brush his lips to Phil's. "Guess we both let this sneak up on us," he said, shifting a little on his handler's lap to lean on to press his lips to Phil's collarbone, his hands resting lightly on the man's shoulders. "Or at least I did. But I guess not every ambush ends badly."
"Don't. Don't do that. You deserve it," Phil said earnestly. "It's kind of nice having something not horrible happening right now."
Coulson couldn't help it. He blushed faintly. The truth was actually something he wanted to talk about even less, but the image had still sprung unbidden into his mind. He found himself rather resenting Darien's presence in the mental picture. "I just want you to not take the heat for this, Barton. If you can alibi out with someone else do it, but Steve's a terrible liar, and since he saw the two of you together, he'd be able to blush and stammer enough to make that one sound true." There were a dozen new things a day that Coulson found out Captain America was good at: lying was not among them. The man couldn't have played a successful hand of poker if his life depended on it. "Or you can just have a private meeting and bitch session with the director and I. Up to you."
"You should go with him." Seeing the protest already rising in Steve's expression, Pepper shook her head. "I need to be here cleaning up this mess and shooing off the press. Fury will be calling any second. Go with him. If he's going to be safe with anyone... Take care of him."
Clint knew he'd been told to stay out of the beer. He also knew that he really could use one at the moment. //Besides, all in the interest of getting him to play along, right?// The archer quirked a faint smile. "Yeah, sounds good," he agreed, oblivious to Scott's internal struggle. He didn't know the man nearly well enough to tell that anything was off. Scott really seemed pretty damned normal, all things considered. Clint wasn't about to completely ignore it if the guy told him something was wrong, but... //No harm in a beer.// "Any in the fridge?"
"I didn't bite you, you oversold lunatic," Logan grunted, grabbing a pair of Steve's jeans and pulling them on. They were a little long and unpleasantly stiff, but they worked fine as soon as Logan got the legs rolled up a little. He added his own tank top to the ensemble and shuffled down the hallway. "Just make sure ya don't forget to zip up." In the kitchenette, Logan settled on one of the barstools and shook his head. "Hadn't bet on gettin' cuddled as part o' the deal. You guys always this friendly at SHIELD?"
Happy to have her own weaponry again, Natasha settled for using it, pulling her guns from their holsters with obvious relish. She had a neat window made out of the target's central body mass a few seconds later, the paper fluttering from the impact.
Scott arched off of the couch and clung even tighter to Logan as the man moved against him. He could feel the bruised flesh throbbing, but it was a pleasant, comforting sensation. The pain didn't bother him. He could handle the sharp, sudden jolt for the warmth that suffused him afterward. Scott wasn't sure if it was him somehow keying into Logan's baser instincts or if it was something he might have enjoyed with anyone else - he suspected not - but the primal reminder of their love made him feel better at once. "I really like being yours," Scott whispered over the sound of their heartbeats and the slide of skin on skin.
Tony's face was lined with worry as he helped Fitz-Simmons put the weapon together. He would glance at Steve from time to time and offer a faint smile before turning back to what he was doing. It became pretty damned hard to do even that, though, as he fitted the arc reactor replica to the weapon. Fitz-Simmons had designed the attachment socket perfectly. With very little effort, Tony would be able to link the weapon to his arc repulsors and channel it through the suit if he needed to. The thought gave Tony chills as he clicked the last latch to it. "Well... guess we've got something to show Fury now," he said numbly.
"So, what I'm getting from this is that I should cancel the massive swing party I had set up for next Friday," Tony replied without batting an eye. He couldn't keep a straight face long, though, and he leaned in to nip at Steve's lower lip. "Okay, no more imagining Loki naked for you. But you don't really have to do much imagining when it comes to me. All you have to do is ask. Anytime. Anywhere. My fly is always open."
Natasha wasn't blind to the way the men hovered close to one another. It didn't bother her, precisely, save that it was a reminder that they'd been through something she didn't yet understand. Whatever it was, Loki would pay for it.
Even Steve couldn't entirely keep from smiling faintly at the words. He heaved a sigh and looked at Fury with a shake of his head. "We try it. I don't... I'm fairly certain I'm going to regret this on so many levels I can't even count that high, but we try it. I hate it, but I don't think I'd be able to live with the alternative."
"Not sure I could deal with listening to Stark give Rogers a BJ in the row behind me while I tried to watch a movie. We can keep it you and me. Maybe drag Nat along if she isn't horrified by the idea of bad 80s movies," Clint decided, flexing his arms back and twisting until his lower back popped. Walking out of the theater, he noticed that the weather was lightly overcast and generally rather pleasant. "Wanna go for a walk or something? Not up for going back to the tower just yet." He knew it was selfish to run away from their issues. He also really couldn't bring himself to be unselfish just yet.
Clint thought about it. "Well, I know your favorite drink is coffee, and so's your favorite food. So that takes care of that. Hmm, tough to know what to ask you. I mean, I know all the surface stuff. Guess... Hmm... Guess I'll have to get a bit more personal." He took one of Phil's hands and laced their fingers together. "Okay, here's one. When did you figure out you liked guys? And how?"
Phil smiled faintly at that. Clint wasn't one to show idle gratitude. If he thanked someone, he meant it. "Not a problem. I don't want you bored." Clint was always a handful, but bored he was downright dangerous. He glanced over at Clint and enjoyed the look of actual relaxation on his face. With Natasha's situation, he knew the mood would likely be transitory, but that didn't matter. It was something. "Outside a few brief phone exchanges with Charles Xavier, I'm afraid I don't have much of an in with any of the X-Men. Hopefully they'll still be willing to listen."
Logan let out a heavy sigh, then glanced Steve again. "So... 'pop'? You look and act like you're old enough to be his grandpa," he said jerking his head toward Tony. "I get the feelin' there's more to ya than serums and red, white, 'n' blue." It wasn't hard for Logan to notice the carefully-contained sense of loss surrounding the blonde. It mirrored his own, though it seemed to have more focus, more structure. Logan felt like his past was a haze full of uncatchable ghosts. Steve seemed to know exactly which spectres were haunting him. //Wonder which one's easier to live with.//
"Yeah..." Breathless, Tony found himself at a loss for words. "Mind? No, I don't mind. In fact, I would be deeply offended if you weren't interested in more."
"It's not very good, is it?" Leaning forward again, Tony scrutinized the image on screen. "Your body's much better than that. Not that I've had much chance to see. After all, you do keep yourself covered up most of the time." He clapped a hand on Steve's shoulder, feeling the muscle underneath. Steve's Captain America uniform left very little to the imagination. Even when Tony had been his angriest with Steve, he couldn't help but notice the other man's scientifically altered physique. Steve Rogers had been transformed into not only a weapon, but the perfect man. "If you feel comfortable enough to walk around naked, you won't hear any arguments from me," he whispered close to his ear.
The feral mutant growled impatiently, tangling his hand in soft blonde strands and tugging Steve's head back to bite at the man's throat while his other hand mauled one perfect buttock, allowing his aching cock to press closer to Steve's entrance. Blue eyes glittered with animal aggression as he drew back to give Steve some room to move.
"At this point, I think we need to assume that we're dealing with Hydra. Whether they're using Mr. Buchanan's body or not, this is them."
Logan hadn't quite meant his comment that way, but he realized a moment later it had been pretty revealing nonetheless. He wanted to kick himself. Instead, he met Scott's eyes, looking half amused and slightly nervous. "Yeah, since I got here. But before you did," he was quick to clarify. "I was curious. About a few things." Not remembering whether he'd been with a guy before had been first and foremost among his list of curiosities. Going to bed with Captain America had been a plus, too.
Steve's expression softened slightly at the news. "Good. That's good. Look, we're all kind of on edge right now, but let's break for awhile, and then we can meet with Fury this afternoon. We all know we're going to have to use the hammer somehow. We just need to get clear to pull it out of the lab and do it."
The Hulk faked a lunge and growled threateningly at Logan, smirking cockily when Logan flinched a little. He seemed to be shrinking and looking a little less rabid. "Smash Loki?"
Clint couldn't help the twitch at the mention of the hammer. He'd nearly forgotten it in light of everything else that had happened.
"Yeah, it does," Scott agreed from the backseat. True to Clint's promise, it looked relatively low key but still sleek and new enough to have a decent crowd and a bit of activity. In other words, if they got tipsy enough to want to dance, they wouldn't look crazy.
The look went straight to Tony's cock and he barely bit back a whimper in response. "Fuck, where'd you learn to look like that?" he breathed, unable to keep from voicing the thought. Getting a better hold of himself, he shook his head. "I don't ask nicely." His slickened fingers brushed slowly over the blonde's puckered hole, pressing lightly as if to penetrate and then sliding a little lower, teasing the perineum before gliding back up. "Think I'd rather just make you," he said, putting a slight growl into his voice.
Clint skipped the case of weaponry in favor of his bow. He could operate a gun, but it wasn't comfortable and soothing like he needed right then. He was already firing basic rounds into moving targets at a rate that could easily outpace the average semi-automatic by the time the other three members of the group took their own positions. There was something profoundly meditative about the active of drawing, aiming, breathing, releasing.
Logan already felt a little more respect for Coulson. If the guy had confronted this whatever-he-was that had the Avengers nervous enough to go digging Logan out of the deepest crevices in Tokyo, he could stand up to a hell of a lot. "How does he expect anyone to take him seriously in that outfit?"
"I'll hold you to that," Steve answered with an eager smile. He kept the pace of his strokes slow because he knew Tony couldn't afford to do too much writhing around. No matter how much he wanted to do far more athletic things, he was tired and Tony was hurt. Just being with the man soothed him to the core. Their hips shifted together, Steve's hand adding whatever friction they didn't create naturally. "I could stay here with you like this forever."
Coulson laughed along with him, glad that Clint was amused by the fact instead of put off. He knew that plenty of people in SHIELD considered his geekier pursuits to be ridiculous and embarrassing. Phil considered them a part of his life he wasn't willing to change simply because some people didn't know how to enjoy themselves. "Good. You should be. I'm very picky." Coulson sipped at the coffee and felt his faculties slowly returning to normal. "I'm fairly certain that without caffeine I might actually stop being able to get up in the morning. Ever."
"This isn't about trust. If you think that I trust you, you're sorely mistaken. This is about mutual need."
Coulson chuckled at that. "I guess it does help to have a couple spares in your back pocket." He wondered how many of his traditional SHIELD agent nine lives he'd used up coming back from Loki stabbing him through the heart. He guessed more than a comfortable margin. As always, even thinking about it all struck a painful chord, something that ran deeper than fear or unease, and Coulson frowned briefly. He shook off the whole thing and tried to focus on the moment, on Clint sitting at the table enjoying a nice meal with him. Even knowing Clint would probably prefer Natasha's company, it still felt good. "So how do you spend your spare time - obvious, vaguely disturbing sexual exploits aside?"
Grateful that he didn't have to try to keep himself together anymore, Scott let go. He screamed Logan's name as he came hard. The feeling of Logan filling him only made the moment more intimate and more surreal. Scott found himself staring up into Logan's face as if in awe of what had happened. "As soon as I'm sure I can walk from this time, we're gonna have to do that again."
Tony was wiping himself off with his discarded shirt, and he paused at the words, arching an eyebrow. "More than one sense?" he asked hesitantly, unsure if he wanted to know. Well, Tony had never much heeded warnings regarding curiosity and cats. He wasn't a cat, after all. "What other sense are we talking about, here? Because if you're looking to get a piece of Stark Industries, you'll have to talk to Pepper Potts."
"I will," Steve agreed solemnly. "I won't let anything happen to either of you." More than anything, Steve hoped he could keep the promise. The elevator dinged, the doors opened, and he took a breath. "Let's go see what we can do to keep you safe too."
Tony felt a sharp thrill go through him at the sound of Steve's quiet moans. The feel of the blonde's slender legs wrapped tight around his waist and the look of sheer heaven on his lover's face was something Tony never wanted to forget. "Fuck, you're beautiful," he murmured, running a hand through soft strands of blonde as he started thrusting slowly. His breath came out in a hitched gasp. Steve was tighter than Tony could have imagined, squeezing Tony's cock perfectly as he moved. Tony moaned Steve's name, leaning in for a slow kiss as he moved.
The contact was thrilling and terrifying at once. Scott's hands were already filled with balled up fabric from the comforter. It was going to hurt, and he knew that before Clint even started. Even if he'd been asking for gentle and slow, it would have hurt. Scott’s heart pounded in his chest, and instead of fear, he felt a sick thrill of exhilaration at the idea of what Clint was about to do. He didn't give any orders, didn't beg, just remained panting and ready and at the mercy of the man behind him.
"Several somethings," she agreed with obvious relief before rummaging through a locked cabinet until she found something. "Ah! Here we are..." She grabbed two bottles and stuck a syringe into one of them, carefully measuring out a dosage before preparing Clint's arm and sliding the needle smoothly beneath his skin. "Nothing terribly strong. You shouldn't feel sleepy, exactly, just relaxed. Very relaxed. These," she held up another bottle, "will help you sleep tonight. Just one a night for as long as you need them." Jemma looked to Coulson and gave him a sympathetic smile. "Actually, they might do both of you some good."
Glad to have a distraction from the myriad worries plaguing him, Steve smiled easily in return. “Yeah.” He didn’t have much. There were a couple of boxes of clothes mostly consisting of outfits chosen by Tony to get him out of his comfort zone of slacks and button downs along with another box of papers and mementos. Steve realized as he and Bucky unpacked the items into his new room that he hadn’t been doing much to settle in anywhere since his return. He glanced over to see Bucky lifting out a picture of the two of them, Bucky’s taller form easily dwarfing him in the shot. “For some crazy reason, the newspapers never want to use that shot in my profiles. Strangest thing.”
Tony would've been reluctant to withdraw if not for that last promise. Pulling away, he licked his lips and looked up at Steve. "Well, if you put it that way, I suppose I could slow down for a bit," he allowed, leaning up to kiss Steve's full lips. He couldn't resist the opportunity to run his hands over the other man's body, exploring the perfectly sculpted muscles. Tony had had plenty of hot partners in his "career," but Steve was special in every sense of the word. "Anyone ever told you that you're perfect in ways that should be illegal?" he asked with a grin.
"Then we'll get him all he needs." Steve carefully lifted Tony into his arms, grateful to feel him even if he hated seeing the other man injured. As if on cue, a plane set down carefully just beyond the edge of the zoo. There would be some very pissed off air traffic controllers, but that didn't matter.
Scott let out a groan but didn't really protest. He liked it. Scott ducked his head under the water and grabbed the shampoo. "Morning," he returned, scrubbing off the remains of the previous day. The night before he'd wondered what it would all feel like in the harsh light of day. Thanks to Natasha's insistence on hydration and the fact that she'd apparently left aspirin on the night stand, Scott didn't feel too bad. His headache was a dull pressure at the back of his skull, but nothing he couldn't handle. "Maybe getting a place of my own's a terrible idea. I kinda like waking up this way."
“I do,” Coulson agreed calmly, “but if it helps, I’d rather not. I prefer talking to you. Besides, if I took it personally every time someone took a shot at me, I would have put Agent Barton six feet under a long time ago. In this line of work, it helps not to hold too many grudges - even against yourself.” Changing tracks and hoping to lighten the moment, Coulson smiled. “They’re going to have to update the Captain America display at the Smithsonian. It identifies you as the only one of the Howling Commandos to die in the line of duty. Maybe we can give them a happier ending now.”
Natasha looked up from her phone long enough to strap in. "Bruce is waiting for us. He should be able to help get everything straightened out." She politely didn't mention the fact that he would do in a pinch with Tony unable to fill his usual role as the smartest man in the room.
Steve held the pad up and quickly scrawled out, "You should be resting," tapping the pen against it to get Tony's attention. Maybe he was going to be stuck in bed himself for awhile, but that didn't mean he couldn't worry about Tony too. Seeing the look of skepticism on the man's face, he continued, "I'll be fine. Just need some rest. See you after you get some too." He couldn't help adding in smaller text at the bottom, "Love you."
"Getting better by the moment," Loki admitted. The man's powerful form and aggressive attitude were enough to put him in mind of other fantasies. Perhaps it wasn't the best indulgence to make, but he deserved the chance to let off some steam. Victor being willing to mark him was a surprisingly intense turn on. "There are a variety of oils on the nightstand. Choose whatever you like." He wasn't interested in teasing or playing, and he honestly hoped Victor wasn't either. Foreplay was well and good, but they weren't in love. They weren't courting, they were scratching a mutual itch.
Logan nodded. "Fair enough. Sounds like you made the right choice," he said. "Tough choice, too. Marie... Rogue never understood why I left, but... Well, I guess now you can relate. Not that I was exactly lookin' to take your job." He took a few bites of food and a sip of coffee. He couldn't help but stare a little longer than he would've liked at Scott. It was strange and intriguing to see the man without the ruby lenses. It was like he was someone else. //Maybe he is.// Logan tightened his jaw and looked back at his plate. "Well, the Avengers could always use some help, if you decided to stick around."
Loki laughed softly. He could almost see Tony's thoughts in the way his eyes darkened and his breath caught. He wasn't thinking of Rogers, at least not for the moment. His thoughts were most definitely otherwise engaged. "One more, and then I think I would very much like to ride you." Letting Stark take control had a certain appeal, but he wouldn't trust the mortal with the task at first. Better to set the pace and show Stark how good it could be before he attempted to let the man have his own way with any of it. "Then I may consider letting you show me whether it's worth letting you take the reins."
Clint sighed as he shed his uniform, realizing he hadn't actually been inside his room in over a day. He gulped a few painkillers and barely managed to get through cleaning up and dragging on boxer briefs and a white t-shirt before he slid into his bed. He didn't rest easily, though, haunted by the feeling of helplessness he'd had faced a second time with Loki, the idea he'd had no way to protect Coulson or himself, the bizarre sense of power and security he'd gotten from the hammer. He jerked awake, eyes darting around the room as his heart hammered in his chest so hard he was sure he could feel the bed rocking. Trembling hands rubbed at his face as he fought to breathe normally, and he slowly slid out of the bed.
Logan hesitated a moment. He hadn't been explicitly told he couldn't mention SHIELD, but he got the feeling they weren't big on handing out their address, either. "Government organization," he said, settling on the edge of his own bed. "You'll get to meet 'em all when we get where we're goin', but I probably shouldn't go flappin' my mouth here. Once you get rested up, I can call 'em and get 'em to take us back to headquarters. They'll wanna talk to you, see what they can find out, but after that you're free to go back to Westchester. If you want." Scott's question, the assumption that Logan wouldn't have come for him without someone sending him, grated on his sense of guilt. Granted, he wouldn't have known if it hadn't been for SHIELD, but he'd have gone looking for Scott much sooner if he'd known. //I guess getting into a fistfight with a guy over his wife kind of leaves a bad impression.// It didn't matter, though. Scott was safe. "Wish I'd known sooner. No one told me you'd disappeared." //Not that I exactly left a forwarding address.//
"Mister Creed." Loki's expression of polite interest was strained. Creed reminded him off his own brother: more muscle than brain and willing to bully others to get his own way. "You weren't a topic of discussion, no. We had more pressing matters to deal with."
"Yes, we should. We have water, but no food yet. The more energy we conserve, the better rested we are, the better chance we have of getting out of here." Coulson led the charge over to the mats. They looked filthy, and he doubted they were anymore comfortable than they looked. He dragged them together and carefully lay down. Only when Clint was settled in against him did he allow his body to relax at all. Coulson curled his arm up around Clint's form and molded himself against it. "Get some rest, Barton. The world will still suck in the morning, but at least we're together."
"It's okay. Maybe it wasn't the same as hearing it from you the first time, but it was a hell of a lot better than risking not hearing it." He smiled at the light kisses and broke off to do some kissing of his own. Scott gently nipped at Logan's jaw and then kissed a path to his ear, licking and sucking there to see what got the best reaction. "Just so you know, I told him to return the sentiment. I don't think he got a chance, but it's true. I love you."
"I think I'd like that. A lot. Actually, I'll go so far as to say that unless we're on duty, you have blanket permission for touching." The way Clint was looking at him, the unexpected sweetness of his smile, made Phil feel certain for a moment that he was in some kind of dream. And he didn't really mind. It was a very, very good dream. Despite not wanting to push or initiate anything beyond the exploration, Phil still couldn't resist stealing another gentle kiss. For two men who'd been around the block in a dozen different ways over as many years, it was strange to realize how much they hadn't done and for how long. They'd both been missing things. "Touch away."
Steve hesitated and then shook his head. "No. That's between the two of you. We both know it wasn't a choice you made, exactly." He let Scott think that over. "Logan said to tell you he's sorry and that he misses you. And that he loves you."
It was an odd thing waking up to the feeling of someone's cock pressing into him, but it was really, really fucking nice. Phil made a soft sound of approval and made a point of grinding himself back into Clint's body. He wasn't necessarily trying to start something, just enjoying the luxury. "Definitely a good morning," he managed before turning to get a look at Clint, hair mussed with a lazy smile on his lips. God that was good. "So do I really get to keep you?"
Clint shrugged and smiled. "I guess it has been awhile since I did the coffee thing. And I might've felt a little weird about coffee with my boss," he admitted, taking another sip. "But if I'd known the mochas were this good, you probably could've talked me into it." In truth, coffee shops were usually either a source of fuel or a dating site, and since the latter hadn't happened in... well, longer than Clint liked to consider, finding a *good* coffee shop hadn't really been priority. "But then, maybe you don't know as much about me as I thought."
Tony's jaw muscles flexed as he stared hard at the god for several long moments. "So, what about now? Still wanna hurt your brother? Rule the world? Or just a world? Because you're not going to get that with the Avengers. You might have to save the world a few times. Maybe even from people who have the same ideas you did. But you're not going to get to step on any more ants." He paused and snorted in amusement. "Well, I guess you've got one chance left. But since you need me to help keep the Avengers from killing you outright, I guess I'm not much of an option, either."
Tony watched the man charge off through one of the habitats and disappear, then lightly tugged at the shredded cloth around his wounds. "Gonna need some scotch... stitches. Stitches and... scotch..." As the adrenaline faded, so too apparently did Tony's hold on consciousness.
"Fair enough," Tony allowed, then lightly tapped the bracelets to one another. Liquid metal seemed to come from his very pores, starting at the bracelets and moving towards the arc reactor. It looked more or less like the last version he'd worn, if slightly more organic. Tony made a face like someone experiencing the sound of nails on a chalkboard as the suit closed up around his neck, forming the back of the helmet but leaving his face exposed. "That... that's a feeling that'll take some adjusting to." He gestured to the clouds below them. "After you, good sir."
"I know," Steve sighed, kissing Tony back with hunger that had nothing at all to do with sex. He calmed down by the time he drew back and even managed a smile for Tony. "Hope you don't mind if it takes me a couple of days to believe I'm not just suffering a horrific mental breakdown." He'd been sure of that when he first saw Tony, but then everyone else seemed to see him too, and he'd slowly realized that maybe Tony was real after all. "Let's get out of the shower, dry off, and sleep for a week or two. Or-" He broke off as Jarvis quietly interrupted to tell them about the movie night. It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what the purpose was, but he only hesitated for a moment. "Tell Dr. Banner we'll be there. Thank you, Jarvis." He half-smiled. "Okay, so maybe we just sleep till tomorrow evening."
Natasha smiled slowly. "Okay." As much as she didn't trust Stark when it came to being a practical, functioning adult, she knew that together he and Bruce could accomplish damn near anything they needed to, especially with SHIELD resources behind them. "Things will be fine, then. Everybody came through okay?"
"I thought it would take at least two cups before he was that perky." Phil had been effectively summoned by the smell of coffee.
Of course, Tony's mind was already going a mile a minute. "Who else knows you can't get drunk? I mean, that's not common knowledge, right? I think we can blame it on the alcohol. Jarvis?"
Despite his surprise at Coulson's vehemence, Steve echoed, "He's not wrong." His own tray was laden with at least twice what either of his companions had taken with them. "We're down enough people, and after what happened last time... look, we don't know if that left any holes." For all they knew, it would be easier for Loki to get inside of Clint all over again if he chose to. "I'd rather be too careful than not enough."
The young woman blushed all over again. "Oh, well, I wouldn't say that. Your papers on-" She caught the look that Fitz was giving her and quieted. "It's nothing. Just doing my job is all." Simmons couldn't help being pleased by the praise, but they really did have work to do, and they were all running on fumes. In that spirit, she ducked over to the coffee machine and started a new pot. "What I'm not sure about is," she leaned over Bruce's shoulder to poke at the screen, "this. The sequence is... well, it's messy, isn't it? I'm not sure it's right at all, and if that reaction doesn't happen as expected, there's a much poorer chance of accurately predicting the results."
"Looks like that one," Logan pointed to Mjolnir, hanging at Thor's belt. "But more evil. Kinda makes people a little nuts when they use it."
He slipped quietly into the lab, smiling to see her and Fitz hunched over their monitors and chattering back and forth. "Working on the next big thing?" he asked, crossing his arms over his chest and smiling warmly.
Everyone froze and looked at Fury, who was standing, hands balled in fists and knuckles-down on the table. The Director, clearly as irritated as he got publicly, glowered at each of them in turn. "Stark's gonna do this." He looked at Tony. "For now."
It was a valid point, and Phil actually felt abashed for having been the one to bring it up. Logan was right: it didn't help. "I don't think any of us do," he agreed instead of addressing the primary issue, leaving it lie for the time being.
She turned her head, glaring back at him until the expression did its job, and she sighed, rolling her eyes. "Oh, fine. You're adorable." Natasha arched an eyebrow at Phil. "He's your problem. You did this to yourself."
Clint wavered. He could hear the pain in Phil's voice, the slight shake. He knew his handler was scared. Phil didn't get scared without a good reason. Forcing himself to compartmentalize the moment, the archer willed himself to sit. It was an order.
Despite the threat, Coulson stepped between the men immediately. He refrained from touching Logan but put a warning hand on Clint's chest. "Enough. Natasha is what we should be worrying about right now. I wanted information from Logan. That's all," he assured the archer. "What he knows doesn't help her right now." If there was more to the story, Coulson would find out, but he wouldn't do it at the expense of one of his agents. "Are you two going to play nice, or do I need to make you sit on opposite sides of the room?"
"The feeling is definitely mutual." He wasn't sure he'd survive a few more days without Tony, let alone a lifetime. Every tiny reminder of the man's outsized presence had left him grasping and desperate to have the man back, to have him close. Steve swallowed hard and hung the towel to get it out of the way before he slipped into Tony's embrace, their lightly damp skin clinging with the movement. With an effort he drew away long enough for them to get to the bed and tumble in, still naked. The scent of Tony lingering in the sheets had been the only thing that let him sleep for the previous two days. Having the real thing was a revelation. Steve buried his face against Tony's neck with a sigh. "Love the way you smell."
The mutant laughed, barely seeming to register that the lithe, powerful form underneath him was doing it's best to unseat him. "This is fucking touching. Do you two rehearse this shit?" He gave Clint a light shake. "I'm just deciding who I use first. Not which one of you gets used."
Steve's expression brightened at the sight of Tony. He still looked gray and shaky, but he smiled all the same. "See? Still here." His fingers brushed over Tony's gently as he passed with Natasha's help.
Logan slowed his pace a little when he heard the doors to the meeting room slide open. He could tell by the footsteps that it was Steve, and that he was alone. He stopped and turned around, crossing his arms over his chest. "If you're worried about me stabbin' 'im in the lungs, don't. If he pisses me off enough, most I'll do is knock loose a few teeth, maybe break his pretty nose."
Tony made a show of scrutinizing the blonde before finally patting the mattress next to him. "You could take a load off. Pretty sure you need a doctor. I have a PhD or two. You can totally trust me," he said, setting his tablet aside and turning the covers down next to him. Tony himself wore only a thin tank top and a pair of boxers, but he had no doubts that he'd be shedding those soon enough.
A few minutes of white-knuckle riding and zipping in and out of car lanes had them in front of a nondescript building with a neon sign out front that simply said "bar." Clint dismounted and offered Darien a grin. "Time for a beer." He lead the way inside.
"Ramble all you need to," Coulson answered, smiling warmly in response. He would have been lying if he said he hadn't wondered the same thing for a few horrifying seconds. They'd passed the minute he saw Stark break down crying on the man's bed. Tony was in love - actually, really in love - and Coulson felt relatively safe in saying nothing was going to break that, at least not easily. "He's probably going to have doubts about a lot of things even when he's feeling better. It can't be easy to have your whole sense of self pulled out from under you in the space of a few minutes. He hasn't had to deal with asthma and normal aches and pains in years even if you don't count the time on ice."
Steve looked over at Tony and explained more gently, "I'm guessing you're gonna get a few of those questions too if you're up to it." His own personal desire to get Tony home, divest them both of their clothing and spend the next month reassuring himself that Tony wasn't dead weren’t a very practical or likely turn of events. Fury would want to know what had happened.
They hadn't really checked in, they didn't know where the team was. They had no idea if the fight had gone as badly as it had looked like it was going when they left. Reluctantly, Phil fumbled for the tablet on his nightstand and fired it up, navigating to the reports from the past few days. From their situation, it had been clear that Loki hadn't been defeated, but it still cut to read the report, to know the truth instead of just assuming it. Stark was dead. He could barely imagine how Steve felt, and the thought alone left him reaching for Clint to touch, to feel the reassurance of the man's presence and safety.
Scott gladly chugged half the beer in a go. He regretted it slightly a moment later but that didn't stop him from taking another swig. Day drinking was fine. Day being shit-faced drunk sounded a lot better with his current frame of mind. "Got a point there. I need to met new assholes." Scott's brow furrowed as he thought that over. "Nope, doesn't sound right. Gonna have to drink until it does." He clinked his bottle against Logan's and breezed right past the observation. The more Scott drank and the faster did it, the less he worried about how it all sounded. "I'm gonna regret asking this, but how many milliseconds were you here before you started hitting on the cute redhead... what's her face... uh... Widow?"
Tony barely dared to breathe, afraid he'd whimper or gasp or make some other sound that would give away the tension he was feeling. He wasn't entirely sure of the source of said tension, but with the god so close, the answer was getting clearer, and Tony didn't like it much. He wasn't sure if it was desperation or just his tendency to act more idiotic than usual when he thought he was going to die soon, but he found himself more tempted than repulsed by the come on. "Guess I must be pretty crazy," he breathed, voice trembling as he panted softly. With that, he leaned in and pressed his lips to Loki's, his heart hammering in his chest from a mix of fear and excitement.
"That would be nice." Natasha rubbed her forehead absently. "It's like having a migraine medication can't touch. I'm not overly fond of the sensation."
Eyes still scanning their surroundings, Clint reached out and tapped something that sounded solid but didn't seem to be there. A small helicopter seemed to materialize next to them, and Clint gestured to the rear seat. "Get in," he said. He waited for Darien to follow along, then hopped in and took off. Setting the autopilot, Clint glanced back at Darien. "Should be touching down in about half an hour."
For a moment, Steve was sure that Tony was about to be eviscerated, but apparently Logan's instincts shifted quickly enough to keep him in one piece. The tension dissipated, and Steve just let himself enjoy the scene. Instead of jealous, he felt pure pleasure at the unmistakable desire between the two men. //Maybe I should have tried something like this sooner.// "Maybe we should take this to the bedroom," he suggested, walking up to the pair slowly. Logan didn't seem like the kind of guy to take by surprise no matter how lucky Tony might've gotten with the strategy. Instead he moved in with quiet purpose, one hand sliding around Logan's waist from behind so that he could press a kiss to the man's neck. "Nobody'll interrupt there."
"We're grown ups," Natasha answered simply as she lay down. "You're not just a body pillow," she amended with a sigh. She looked over her shoulder at Clint, gaze sincere. "You're the best friend that I've ever had. It's not what you want, but it's the most I've ever given anyone.
The look on Logan's face was perfect. The fact that he was letting Scott drive the bus was even better. Scott knew how much Logan liked being in control, but he didn't act the least bit put out or frustrated at the fact that Scott was setting the pace. Of course Scott didn't push the advantage either. He wanted to let Logan lose himself in the moment, not torture him. Knowing that Logan wouldn't take anything he wasn't giving made Scott even keener to pay attention to every little thing that told him when it felt especially good so that he could do those things again and again until he could make Logan fall apart.
Loki purred at the touch of Tony's teeth. It was almost gentle as such things went, but enough to excite him. His hips jerked in the mortal's strong grip. "You may be worth my time at that," he chuckled. Stark seemed to have let go any hesitation for the time being. It was entrancing to feel him at work with so many of the walls surrounding Tony lying crumbled around them.
Bruce nodded at Steve, then took a deep breath as he felt the plane dip as it went into VSTOL mode. "Looks like it's showtime," he muttered as the cargo gate dropped.
Tony had to remind himself to take in oxygen when Steve was finally buried fully within him. The blonde was definitely bigger than anyone Tony had been with before, and it was painful and blindingly good all at once to have the man's shaft buried fully within him. "...fuck," he finally managed, his voice weak with pleasure. Without a thought, Tony wrapped his legs around Steve's waist, his hands sliding over the blonde's muscled back and powerful shoulders as Tony squirmed invitingly under Steve's weight.
Much as he was enjoying himself, Clint couldn't help feeling a little relieved at the announcement. He wanted to stay that way for a few hours, but realistically Phil's cock was a bit too much when he wasn't used to it. Anxious to get some relief, but even moreso to taste his partner's release, Clint sucked harder, swallowing and moaning around the rock hard shaft in his throat. One of his hands slid between his own legs, teasing himself as Phil used his throat in the most perfect way.
"If he ever chose to see about therapy... well, I'm not sure even Odin has that kind of cash." He could almost picture Loki crying on a daytime talk show. His smile broadened. "It really is nice having company. Especially someone... who understands. I try not to dwell on it, but it's hard not to some days. I don't remember much about after, but the during is a bit more vivid."
