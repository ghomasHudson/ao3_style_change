"That's enough Clint. You've said your peace now go back to your nest and let us look after our daughter." My head finds it's way into Nat's shoulder as my small shoulders start to shake.
"Very well sir. I should also inform you that Miss Tyler's heart rate has increased and her breathing is shallow. Diagnoses: anxiety attack." The robotic voice of Jarvis brought me out of my head. Was my breathing shallow? Yep. Can't breathe. The elephant is back. I grip the bed sheets in my hand, slightly scared of ripping them as I waited for the agony to pass. I looked up at Steve who looked frozen, as if he'd never seen this happen before and he didn't know what to do. I don't blame him. It's pretty scary. He soon snaps out of it though, kneeling down in front of me, allowing me to grip his forearms as he tells me to breathe in time with him. I soon calm down. He checks to see if I'm okay before slowly unwarping the spoilt material, wincing at what he sees underneath. Tony knocks on the door, first aid kit in hand.
"Bucky. You're hurting me. Get off." As if something snapped, he instantly released his grip, setting me gently on the ground. He moves as if he's seen a ghost, his hands covering his mouth. I'm not phased. I move closer to him, wrapping him up in a hug when I get close enough. He mumbles his apologies into my hair but I brush them off.
"So, Lexie. That's a very pretty name." Lexie points at me again.
"Off to the gym." I say simply, leaning over to hug him. He hugs me back.
11. No phones at the table.
"Hey guys, mind if we join you?" I look up to see my brother and his girlfriend at the door. I nod and they enter, sitting on the floor.
"How you doing Buck?" He asks once they break. The man smiles back at him.
By the time 9 o'clock rolled around, the party was in full swing. The floor was packed with people, some I knew, most I didn't. Me, Pete, MJ and Ned sat around a table in the far corner, away from the drunk adults, playing Never Have I Ever. I take a swig of my beer as MJ smirks at me, we're head to head.
"I hate that idea."
"Was that good?" She nods again patting the book. I chuckle.
"Yes. Yes she did." I skip back down the stairs to find a cut of black coffee sitting in front of my chair. I slide into the seat between Clint and MJ and sip at the hot beverage.
"My Mama."  The room falls silent. None of us daring to say anything.
"Oh God Ned you didn't?" Pete begs with his best friend.
"Anyone want coffee?" I ask as I fill my cup. I get a round of 'mhmh's so I make everyone a cup anyway. By the time we'd finished breakfast it was 7 am. School started at 8:45 which was quite late compared to other schools in the area but we didn't get let out until 3:35 so I suppose it makes up all the same. Wade grabs his backpack and picks my up, spinning me, connecting our lips.
"Wanda told us." I freeze. 'They know? Oh god they know. What are they going to think?' I begin to shake violently in the archer's arm. He shifts me into a more comfortable position and sits on the bed.
"Steve? What happened to Papa?" I blush.
The Chinese came within the next twenty minutes and the two men left me to change. And that's what I did. I got out of my bloodied shirt and pulled on the light blue 'eat, sleep, game, repeat' shirt Steve had pulled out for me. Along with a pair of leggings with multiple rips in. I think no more of it as I rush towards the kitchen to where they were sharing out the food. Hopping into my seat, a bottle of water gets thrown at my face, my advanced reflexes allowing me to catch it. Tony stares at me with a smile on his face. I glare at him.
I've got a dream.
5.   No stealing.
"I missed you too little bird. What's going on around here?" He slowly makes his way to my bed, sitting down with me still in his lap.
"As much as I'd love that. I need to get out of the tower. Social interaction is good for my anxiety. At least that what my therapist said." I rest my head on his shoulder. "Plus, I can't let Pete suffer the questions along. What sort of a sister would that make me?" He chuckles and kisses my head.
"Hey Underoo's. What's up?" Peter shuffles into the open space nervously, not taking his eyes off of the floor. He scratches the back of his neck.
"Umm Aunt Tasha, this is my boyfriend, Wade. Wade this is Natasha, my aunt." Wade smiles his million dollar smiles and extends his hand.
"Dad I feel like I'm going to be sick."
"Hydra needs to die for this." I say softly as he rocks me back and forth.
"Calm. They won't kick you out but I won't tell them until you are ready. Now, let's get you some suitable clothes.
'Cause way down deep inside we've got a dream
"Pete!! What did you do?"
"I'll watch Lex, you go show Blake her room." I smile at the woman and push passed her gently, nudging Blake's shoulder with my own.
We sit around the table, eating the pasta Pepper made.
"Yes. To Pepper. My mom."
"Thank you!" She squeals quickly diving into the toy box. I turn to look at Blake who was standing awkwardly at the door. MJ places a hand on my shoulder.
They will be missed dearly by their family.
"Well that's no way to talk to your big sister is it." Morgan gasps loudly and pulls off the Iron man helmet, her doe eyes shining up at me.
"Whatever, just get that fuckable butt in the car."
As soon as the children are set loose, MJ gets dragged off to play barbies with some of the girls which she looks so happy about. I just circulate for a while, watching the boys play football outside, watching a group of kids play a board game, some being a little more vocal that others and my gaze finally lands on a small form in the far corner. I slowly approach the figure, squatting in front of them.
"Umm yeah. Yeah I did."
"Thanks Liz." She smiles again before turning back to her own work.
Like everybody else, I've got a dream
"Group hug!!!!" Soon enough everyone had joined in with the hug. They're weirdos. They're my weirdos. I couldn't ask for a better family.
Come with me Friday, don't say maybe
"What's up kid?" Her voice was gentle despite her demeaner. God, this is hard. I gulp and look her in the eyes. Blue meeting green.
"Not yet. I'm going to tell them on our adopt-aiversary. That's what they're calling the day they adopted us. It'll be a year in a few months and they want us to make speeches so." She just stares at me for a moment before snapping out of it.
We spent the evening talking and getting to know Bucky. He told us stories from the war and from all the times he saved Steve's ass. He even promised to take me dancing like they did in the 40s one day. We got back to the tower around 10, all of us being pretty tired. Bucky heads towards the guest room next to mine and I head into my room. Changing into my pyjamas and bouncing into the living room to see quite a heated make out session between my two dads.
"Ready to go?" dad asks in a similar fashion. I glance around at each of the faces surrounding me, my eyes lingering on MJ's a soft smile creeping onto my face.
"This seems like an excellent time to show up."
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
"Don't make promises you can't keep Ty." I sigh and kiss his cheek.
But we are two worlds apart
Time skip to the next day because I'm lazy and we all know how school goes.
"I don't mind really kiddo. You want to wear boys clothes and be called a boy, I don't mind. You want to wear dresses all the time and be called a princess, I don't mind that either. All I, hell all any of us, want is for you to be happy. I don't mind what you are or where you fall as long as you're not hurting yourself okay?" Tears well in my eyes as I hug the woman in front of me, the feeling of acceptance is overwhelming. She pulls away and wipes my cheeks with her thumbs.
Cause way down deep inside I've got a dream
"So, uh, Nat told us. do you need anything?" I shake my head no and he nods in understanding. "We're going out for dinner so wear something nice yeah? This place is fancy." I groan when I hear this.
The moon peers in through the gap in my curtains, creating a sinister glow to cast upon my face. My eyes open slowly but I quickly shut them as the pain in my chest increases. Small whimpers escape my mouth as I curl up on my side, holding my tiger close to me.
"Come on Ty, open it." I pull on the bow hesitantly, opening it slowly. There's a ring sat upon a black velvet cushion. It's a simple silver band with a small heart on top.
"Mornin'" I say, my voice deep and laced with sleep. I sit up and look around. "Where are we?"
Sadistic
"That I do."
"No it's much more than that."
"Bye losers."
"You can go if you want." He whispers but I just shake my head. I want to know what they'll say. He nods and turns his attention back to my fathers, his demeanour instantly changing.
"'T's open." Without missing a beat, the door was pulled open a smidge and the witch stepped through.
"Okay honey, I'm going to point to a letter and you're going to spell your name out okay?" She nods in understanding. I knew she was smart. I go through every letter until she raises her hand. We do the process 5 times before I have her name.
"Tony and Steve want to send me to counselling." I mumble into her shoulder.
"I think you should lay off the booze Ty. Do Tony and Steve even know you're drinking?" I shrug.
"Umm. I have something I need to tell you." I say over everyone else's talk. Pete looks at me encouragingly and MJ gives me a thumbs up. I grab Wade's hand tightly under the table.
"Children!" Conrad yells up the stairs, a sickly sweet undertone to her voice. "It's time sweethearts, everyone in positions." It sounded like a herd of elephants rushing down the stairs, the kids chatter between themselves excitedly, rushing to get to the place they were told to stand. I sigh deeply, checking myself once again in the mirror. I hate days like this. It's like you're shopping for a child. It's stupid. Of course, I'm not afraid to voice my disdain to anyone that will listen, but most of the time, it resulted in me getting punished. And I hate punishment. I was so busy checking my appearance, I was unaware that someone was in the room until a hand was placed gently on my shoulder. I tense slightly and swivel my head to see that it was only my brother. He looked at me, concern evident in his eyes but I just smiled and lead him out the room.
"Be down in 5 minutes. You've got work to do." And with that, she left. I stand with a groan, stretching out my back and other limbs that are tired from the lack of sleep. Rubbing my bloodshot eyes, I get changed into something that deems barely decent to meet possible parents in. Pulling my now messy hair into a bun, the door is opened, much gentler than last time and Peter sticks his head around it.
"You smelling the silent judgement?" Dad asks. Clint steps away.
"Our oldest, Peter. There are so many words to describe him. Smart, funny, confident, a pain in the ass when he wants to be, calm, considerate. He's our son. He's the best son we could ever ask for. He's an amazing big brother, a great little scientist, he's the heir to Stark industries for God's sake. He's perfect. Peter, you're perfect. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. We love you our son." There's a round of applause as the mic is passed back to dad. Oh god.
"Food will be served shortly and I just want to thank you all for coming, it really means a lot to us, it's a free bar so drink whatever you want, the dance floor is open and the DJ is up to take requests. Please just enjoy yourselves." True to his word, the food came out less than half an hour later. I quickly dig into my chicken nuggets. All the adults were eating fish and shit like that so me and Pete ordered from the kids meal. Nuggets and fries. What wrong with that? Soon enough the speech chants were going wild so Peter made his way onto the stage. Grabbing a microphone from the DJ.
This whole chapter is a big trigger warning. If you are triggered by mentions of self harm and stuff please skip the first half of the chapter
"Cards against Humanity? I've wanted this for ages. Thank you."
"Thank you Mr Stark-Rogers. 5 minute resus then results."
"Dad! How are you?"
"Hey Pete." He takes a seat on the grass beside me, leaning back so he's lying down. I join him, looking at the clouds, analysing the different shapes that they make.
"Mom? Tony got married?" I yank my arm out of his grip.
"Let's get this party started bitches."
I've always yearned to be a concert
"Me neither babe. Me neither."
"Thanks Papa. Not too bad yourself."
"Tyler! They'll be here in half an hour. Hurry up." Papa yells up the stairs. I groan as I grab my hair dryer, blasting my hair. 'I need to get it cut again soon.' I pay no attention to him as I pull on my jeans and button up my shirt. 'I look gay. I love it.'
[NAT/CLINT] She's got a dream
"Tyler?" His voice matches mine. I shake my head. This can't be happening.
"And you!" I start, pointing a finger at him. That's where I knew that voice from.
One by one, they start to appear, sitting in the chairs in front of the students. There was Iron man, Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Bruce Banner, Bucky Barnes, Falcon, Scarlet Witch and Vision. All the questions were pretty generic.
"Baby maybe you should calm down." Wade tries to grab onto my wrist.
"Nat? Clint? You guys back?"
"Dad!!!! Close them." All he did was chuckle, making his way out of the room.
"I'll take you up on that offer. Thank you Tyler." I feel her lips on my head and she leaves the room only to be replaced by my dad.
"How do you like it?" He asks, pulling me a cup out of the cupboard.
"You, are going to be the death of me Tyler Stark."
"Nat, we've been together for just over a year. He's done nothing to hurt me. He is one of the best things that has ever happened to me. Just give him a chance. Please." She groans.
"Numbers 1, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12, 17 and 18." I say. Steve takes the list back and looks over it, Tony glancing over his shoulder nodding his head.
"Yup. You making pancakes?" I ask my aunt, peering over her shoulder. She laughs at me.
"Tyler, who's this?" I smile up at Wade and lock eyes with Steve.
"Kids, what we are about to show you goes no further and you are, hopefully, going to love it." Tony puts a code into this keypad thing as Steve gives us a reassuring smile. "And behold." The door opens and he gestures us inside. Me and my brother look at each other with panicked expressions. They know. They must know. The reason we know this was because the room in question split off into two parts; one side decorated in spiderwebs and the other in dark shadows. We turn to our new guardians, Peter looking sheepish and me, well I was fucking terrified. Tony notices.
"There better be coffee on that table when I get back." I demand from half way up the stairs. I knock twice on the second guest rooms door.
"You need to tell them Sparky. They can help." I shake my head.
"Hey sweetheart. Can I talk to Tyler real quick? We'll be right back I promise."
And I don't wanna fight
"Mama, who's that?" They ask, cowering behind their moms chair.
"As you wish Tyler. Mr Stark and Mr Rogers are in the kitchen with Master Parker and are requesting that you join them." I let out an internal groan as I walk over to my bags that lay on the floor. 'When the hell did these get here?' I shrug. 'Maybe Steve brought them up.'
"It's a court house." I shoot back, finishing up my breakfast.
"Tyler, you know why you're here today right?"
"Of course Ms Stark. Have a good break." I wave off my overly enthusiastic sectary and continue the trek down the halls.  Not before long the I arrive at the glass door of the private laboratory, punching the code into the pad, opening the doors and stepping inside.
"Then there's Cameron, she's 5 and Emory who's 7."
"I told you, I don't think I need them anymore."
"No."
"What pizza do you and Peter like?" He asks. I think for a moment.
"Guilty." I rest my head back on his chest, just sitting in silence for a while. It was peaceful. Well, it was until I stretched my arms out, the sleeves of my Green Day hoodie pulling up slightly. I push them back down quickly, but not quick enough. Clint grabs my forearm gently and looks me dead in the eye.
"Thanks for the lift Clint." I say as we climb out of the car. "See you later." The archer speeds off leaving us in the dust literally seconds before the bell rings. The day drags for hours, with lunch seeming like 5 minutes. We all meet up after school at my locker as usual. Ned has to go home today but luckily for me, MJ can stay the whole week.
"You're not going anywhere Tyler." I spin on my heel to face my fathers, my arms crossed against my chest, eyebrow raised. Steve sighs and continues. "We said that we needed to talk so that is what we are going to do." Tony nods along.
"Do you want to go somewhere? I'd like to get to know you." I nod and lead him into my room, knowing that if something happened I'd only have to yell and Pete would be here. I push open my door and invite him inside. He looks around and takes a seat on my bed, looking at me. I sit down on my desk chair opposite him and turn to face him, smiling lightly as I do so. He continues to look around my room and his eyes stop on my desk behind him.
"Morning Tyler. You'll go through to James for about 15 minutes then your family will be called back okay?" I nod. "Well then, he's ready for you. See you later darling."
But despite my evil look
"Skills baby boy." I roll my eyes and lean forward to talk to MJ.
"You say you want her safe and happy. Well how many times have any of you actually spoken to her since me and Nat left for a mission?" Nobody says anything. "How many have you noticed the growing collection of scars on her arms? The dark circles under her eyes that get worse every time I see her? The way her clothes are beginning to hang off of her body? Have any of you actually asked her if she's okay? Do you even care?" His rant was cut off by Tony.
"And these are for you." Inside is a box, wrapped neatly in black paper with multicoloured constellations on it. I open it carefully to find a necklace. It had a silver chain with a heart shaped locket on the end with a purple stone in the centre. I look up at Bucky, my mouth wide open. He chuckles at my reaction.
"Listen прекрасный, I know you don't want to take them. I know you're scared. But if you don't, you're going to be stuck in this loop forever. You're going to end up killing yourself Tyler. And I know once upon a time, not so long ago, that is what you wanted, but I can see it in your eyes, right now that you don't want that ending anymore because you've got people who love you and who'll miss you if you go. We want you to get better, and if this is what they're offering you, it's worth a try right? If they don't work we'll go back to square one and try something else. But please, for us, give it a go." I stare into her green eyes that are slowly filling with tears.
"No. No. Never. You guys are my family, you're my dad's right?" It was now Steve's turn to sigh.
"I'm fine mom, just stressed out with finals and stuff." She nods in understanding.
"Peasant, I have arrived." I joke as I step over the threshold. He rolls his eyes under the heavy frame of his glasses.
Who knows how long they were sat there for. Neither of them really cared but both knew they had to go back sooner or later. Standing up, the pair take a final look at what's around them, breathing in the polluted air of the city and without another word, they jump off the building. Peter swings along using his webs and Tyler teleports from one rooftop to the next, not having figured out how to safely make it long distances yet. They move in silence, neither wanting to ruin the last moments of freedom. After around 5 minutes, they arrive at the place they had called home for the past 7 years; Ms Conrad's Orphanage. I'll spare you the details of their sob stories for now. Unwillingly, the duo say their goodbyes and crawl through their respective windows, landing softly in their rooms. Tyler sighs and runs her hand through her golden locks ripping off her leather jacket and throwing it to the floor. Getting changed out of shadow's gear and into pyjamas seemed to take the teen longer than she originally anticipated. A soft knock echoed through the room. The girl smiled, walking towards the door, yanking it open then pulling her brother inside, checking the halls to see if anyone had noticed. Closing the door soundlessly behind her, the blonde let's out a breath she didn't even know she was holding as her older brother chuckles slightly at her, pulling a computer out of his bag and setting it up. Tyler flips over to where Peter has sat on her bed and takes the vacant one next to him. And without a sound, the pair open up the database and start logging any crimes they saw earlier that evening. It didn't take long but it was far past midnight when they came in from patrol and tomorrow is adoption day which means both teens will be up at the crack of dawn to clean up the younger children's mess, like usual. Both bid their farewells and Peter retreated back to his room. The younger did not waste any time. Jumping up from her spot and clambering into bed, pulling the bear Pete got her close to her chest as her eyes start to close, sending her into a dreamless slumber.
"Can I be excused?" I ask, pushing my plate away. Steve glances at me.
"I love you too, Tyler. Forever."
"Oh you've done it now Quinzel." He goes for a punch but like last time I dodged it. I pull my fist back, ready to deliver one of my own when Peter stands in front of me.
"Ned you're like a child." I muse but open his poorly wrapped gift nonetheless.
"Gotta say kid, didn't think you had that in ya." He says, a smirk on his face. I copy.
For making love the way I saved for you inside my head
"More than you know." I answer with a forced chuckle. A pair of lips makes contact with my temple.
And I know one day romance will reign supreme
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel,
"Yeah. I uh, saw Steve and Bucky." Both of my parents look at me, waiting for further explanation. "My powers glitched out earlier and I was in this old apartment, looked like no one lived there. Before I got to look around I came back. They glitched again and I was back there, had a little fight with the pair of them because I was in their house and they were attacking me. We talked a little and then I came back." I told them. Pepper rests her hand against my forehead.
"Why not." We link arms and strut up to where the DJ is set. He smiles when he sees us.
"Hey guys." I say wrapping my arms around my two best friends. Me, Pete and MJ go to school together. We've been close since we started Midtown Tech.
"Black, no sugar." Steve turns around and looks between me and Tony. I look at his as if to say 'what' and he shakes his head.
"My dearest Melody-Elizabeth,
"I'm okay. Really. I'm sorry about last night."
My hair's still curly and my eyes are still blue
"Uh huh. I'll grab my stuff." I swing my legs over the side of the bed and notice there was nobody else occupying it.
"You alright kiddo?" I nod.
Oh yeah, dirt bag
"Ass hat." I mumble, jumping straight into a general catch up conversation with Bucky and Nat. This is how it's supposed to be.
"Morg, go get Daddy for me please." She runs off without a word, Dad and Peter joining my side not side not 3 minutes later. The car rolls to a stop in front of us, the doors opening agonizingly slow. Steve steps out, followed by Bucky and Natasha. The three of us get into a more defensive position, ready for a fight if it comes to it.
And he drives an I-Roc
I wanna be a role model
"That looks great, just waiting on Nat to get back. Why don't you go and get ready?" I ask seeing as she not dressed for the party herself. She smiles at me.
"Yes." I respond as Pete says "No." All three of them roll their eyes at my answer.
"Umm, mine is hard. To tell and to understand so please, bear with me." I disclose, both of them nod and I begin telling my story.
"Okay, Love you." I call as he shuts the door. I pull off the remainder of my wet clothes and step under the spray of the water. I spend little time washing my hair and even less my body. I did only have half an hour to get ready after all. Using the towel to dry my hair, choosing an outfit is proving to be a hard task.
"There's one more thing we want to show you so, children, follow me." Me and Peter share a confused glance as we walk down the hallway we just came through. We stop at a door I failed to notice when I first came in. The adults turn to look at us, seriousness evident in their eyes.
"Sorry babe. I can't." He kisses my head and puts a protective arm around the back of my chair. I lean onto his side, closing my eyes. Enjoying my moment of peace.
The rest of the night went without hitch, people danced, Morgan, Nat's 3 kids, Lila, Cooper and Talia, Bucky and Sam's son, Riley and Wanda's son, Pietro ran around the floor like mad men, eventually being joined by Bruce's cautious little girl Brynn. I don't blame her, if dad tried to make me play with them I'd be pretty scared too. I sit at the bar enjoying the view, my dad's chasing them now, I wonder if he'll do that with my kids. I feel someone sit next to me but I don't really acknowledge it.
"If you're going to hit someone then it's going to be me." Flash doesn't think twice as he goes in for a swing which I dodge, sending him tumbling forwards into an abandoned table. I smirk down at him.
"Night Momma." I yell back from my position on the couch waiting for my dad to join me. It doesn't take him long to. He passes me a bottle of water and sits down opposite myself, staring intently.
"What if he doesn't show up?"
"It's been over 2 years, and you're old, I get that, but have you really forgotten that I can teleport?" I answer smartly, pulling myself off of the floor. "As to why I'm here, I have no idea. I was just sent here. It was a glitch." Steve stares at me for a while before pulling me in for a bone crushing hug. I squirm and try and get out of his arms.
"Any requests?" Steve leans back into the sofa, rubbing his chin in thought.
"Maybe I should what penis? Wait I shouldn't even call you that considering you don't have one." I stand up out of my seat only to have Wade and MJ hold me down.
The drive to the mall was long, hot but far from boring. We sang to random pop songs on the radio, played never have I ever and just talked about random stuff ranging from school to embarrassing things Pete's done over the years. Nat parks up and we jump out, walking arm in arm around the centre.
"Yeah. I'm sure I can find you something that you won't deem as lame." We all head towards the kitchen, dragging our feet the whole way there as Papa and Dad stand there with shit-eating grins on their faces.
"Let's go sort out the paper work then."
I wake with a start. Shooting up into a sitting position, my hand clutching at my chest. It was just a dream. I let out a breath of relief and collapse back into the comfy foam, allowing it to surround me. I pull back the light grey comforter and kick my legs to hang off the side of the bed, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.
"Shut up Wade." I shoot a fake glare at my boyfriend as I grab the gift bag he's holding out to me. I pull on the string and inside is a framed picture of the two of us on our 1 year anniversary. We went to the carnival in town, we got this random couple to take on of us kissing on the Ferris wheel. It was really romantic okay? I grab the back of Wade's neck and pull his lips to mine.
"You ready?" He asks simply. Instead of replying, I grab my phone and shove it in my back pocket, walking towards my brother and closing the door softly behind me.
"Where's Steve Jarvis?" I ask, not really wanting to be the third wheel in their conversations.
"Damn Nat, looking fine." The redhead laughs at my comment.
(Bold underlined=MJ)
Believe when I say
"Thank you MJ. So complimentary as usual." I decide to open MJ's gift first.
The five of us sit there talking for a while, more and more people flooding in.
"Yes sir I have already found several that have high reviews and match the colour scheme."
5 minutes went too quick for my liking. Soon enough I'm sat back in that seat, holding my dad's hands in a bruising grip, eyes screwed shut, praying to heaven and hell that it will weigh to our side.
"Yeah. I just don't want to take them anymore. I'm getting better." They both share a glance. "Seriously guys, I'm okay. Better than okay actually."
"Can I at least get a hug?" I simply wrap my arms around her shoulders as an answer.
"It's not your fault." Both men smile at him sadly.
"Mom-"
"It's only been mentioned once or twice but I think I've got the idea." I shoot back Sarcastically causing another sigh to fall from his lips.
And why does she give a damn about me?
"Of course." She points at me and Peter. "Keep it zipped." Another round of laughter.
"Yeah why not?" I look back out of the window, trying to think of a starting point.
"Hey kid. Hey look at me." He put his finger under my chin to lift it up when I start to look at the ground. "There's those beautiful eyes." We both laugh through our tears. He reaches up slowly to pull the beanie off of my head, grabbing the scrunchie that Wanda was offering to him. He runs his fingers through my hair and pulls it back, securing it with the elastic and places the hat over the top so only my unkempt bangs were hanging out of the front. He grabs both of our hands and positions us in front of a mirror on the other side of the wall, standing behind us.
"I don't understand why you kids find these jokes funny. They're highly inappropriate and rude." Steve starts babbling on about the olden days. I look over to Tony who looked just as bored with the speech as I was. But before we we're able to say anything, the elevator door dinged open, revealing the ex-assassin. I gave my cup to the now silent soldier and ran over to hug the woman who is slowly becoming a big part of my life.
"Here." I raise my hand like everyone else did. Her eyebrow didn't go down.
"Thanks Papa." We both say before the car falls into a comfortable silence for the rest of the ride.
"Believe me, we do. And you know it's illegal to deny any child the chance of getting adopted or fostered don't you?" I ask, my head tilting sideways innocently, Lexie clinging onto MJ's side, watching with wide eyes. Conrad glares at me for a moment before seemingly backing down.
Who knows how long we stayed in that position for. But we soon broke it. Steve wrapped his arm around my shoulders cautiously (which I was grateful for) and Tony grabbed Peter's hand in his.
"Okay so you're in one of those moods, I'm just going to say this then call in your family." He pauses for dramatic effect but all it does is make me more anxious.
"So you don't like it but you can't say anything negative so you're just making up some bullshit excuse to make it sound wonderful?"
"No can do little lady. We're watching the rest of this one then you're going to bed." My shoulders drop but I don't complain, knowing that it'll get me nowhere. The movie soon finishes and Mom leads me up to the room I'll be staying in when I'm there. Pretty plain, not half the size of my room at the tower but it's nice. She throws me some of her pyjamas and tucks me into bed like she used to do when I was Brooklyn's age.
"I'm going to go to bed." Mom declares as she toes off her shoes. "Have you got this covered?"
"I'm Peter Parker and this is Tyler-Kai Quinzel. We're both massive fans of your work as you can tell." Both men smile.
"I'll see you when I get back. Bye guys."
"Yeah and Tiger, with the amount you've been eating, you're not stable. So before you go back out there, we need you healthy. So why don't we take a seat and we can talk things out yeah? Calmly. We can just talk. You can tell us whatever is bothering you." I nod slightly. Not happy with what I was being told but knowing better than to argue.  Dragging my feet over to the counter and sitting on one of the stools, waiting for the adults to join me. It doesn't take them long to grab a drink and sit opposite me. Talk about intimidation much. A cup of coffee is placed in front of me but I didn't lift my head up. Not until Steve cleared his throat, catching my attention. My blue eyes snap up to meet his, the comforting gaze making me feel uneasy. I'm not used to this much compassion.
"I love you 3000 Tyler." Tears well up in my eyes as I walk over to the 4 year old, scooping her up in my arms, planting a kiss on her head.
"Have fun in Vegas guys. Don't go too mental, we need money to eat." Mom and Dad were going to Las Vegas on their honeymoon and Me and Peter decided not to go because neither of us are old enough to drink so Clint and Natasha offered to take us in for the week and even said that Ned and MJ could stay over. Mom kisses my head.
"Clay More, level 1."
When you say
"Right I want to see you all on the dancefloor." The DJ says into the Mic.  It's a lot of fun.
I'm just a teenage dirtbag, baby, like you ooh"
"Pete made me this for my birthday when I was 10. I kept losing them or Conrad would take them as a punishment. I always wear it." I pick Melody back up and begin strumming.
"Little Bird?" Clint yells. I enter the room where both of them are sat on the sofa, cuddled up to each other, watching some superhero movie about a bat.
"We get you kid, but you need to stop working yourself up. You're pushing yourself too hard. You'll end up falling asleep in your exams." I sigh running my hands down my face.
4.   No fighting.
"What?" I ask, my voice small. Tony was the first to snap out of it.
"Well honey, I'm not going to hurt you. I promise. Do you think maybe, one day, you'll trust me enough to talk to me." A barely there nod has me grinning.
"Don't you dare wake her up."
"I'm sorry. I just feel really over protective of you. You've been through enough, I don't want him to break your heart as well." It's my turn to sigh. I turn my body to face the older woman.
"Too late for that." I chip in as I sit up, rubbing my eyes. Natasha smacks Clint and they start signing vigorously to each other. Nat turns to me and smiles.
Flashback...
"Natasha, or better known as Black Widow, is one of my closest friends and we thought it would be good for you to get to know her and stuff so you have a woman to talk to in case you don't want to talk to us." I nod in understanding as I lean back against Steve. He stands up and sets me on my feet.
I finish up the song and Steve instantly starts clapping. I giggle slightly at him, shoving his knee.
"This can be your room in the future if you'd like." She says, looking at me over her shoulder, her hand resting on the door knob.
"Hey Tiger, Nat said you needed my help."
"Who are you and why are you here?" I recognise that voice. I glare back.
"We could never hate you Angel. Why would you think that?" I take a deep breath, here goes nothing.
"I'd love to if that's okay with everyone."
"Coming mom." We yell back, brushing the grass off of out legs, joining hands and walking back towards the house.
"Like it?" He asks cockily. I ignore him and look around. Steve clears his throat and the pair of us turn to look at him.
The reception looked expensive and classy. It's Tony Stark's wedding, what do you expect. We were sat on the head table along with Rhodey and Sam. All the Avengers, minus Steve and Bucky, were on the one next to us and other guest dotted about around the spacious area. Dad hits his spoon on his glass to get everyone's attention.
"You guys should get going. Happy's waiting." Dad says not looking up from his Stark Pad. We hug each of them, saying our goodbyes before heading out the door and jumping into the back of the blue Audi parked out front. Hell here we come.
"Hey! Where's my hug?" Pete asks as he walks over to me. I roll my eyes but embrace the older boy anyway.
"Pete and Ned are on their way." Just as I finish my sentence, I heard them coming down the stairs.
"Bucky?" My voice is soft, not very loud. He doesn't shift, only continues whimpering and squirming in his sleep. I move closer to him, resting my hand on his shoulder.
"Jarvis?" I call out to the AI.
"I see that Tyler, you okay honey?" Everything does seem a little spinney.
We drive for around 45 minutes before pulling up outside of a deadly familiar building. Still dull and grey, no signs of life anywhere. MJ notices my discomfort straight away.
"Can you cut my hair? You know, like it was before?"
"Hey baby." I coo as Wade sits down next to me, wrapping his arms securely around my waist.
"Ever heard of knocking?" He rolls his eyes at my sarcasm.
"We read your file." My chest became tight again. "But trust me sweetheart, nothing in there makes us think anything different about you okay? You just need a little help and we're going to get it for you okay? We're going to help you get better." I sniffle a little and bury my head into Steve's shoulder, nodding my head. Another thought comes into my head.
"Tyler, we're taking you to counselling. We think it could help." I say nothing as I nod my head. I want to get better, don't I?
"To the happy couple." Everyone choruses and the 6 leave to go and sit down. Morgan runs up to dad and whispers something in his ear.
"I don't recognise you, what's your name." I smirk.
"So kids, how was your day?" dad asks, taking a bite of his food. Yet again, Peter starts giving an extremely detailed description of his day while the rest of us sit and listen, adding input when necessary.
"That my little spider is a surprise." She says, annoying the now 17 year old even more than he already was.
How come you treat me like a worn-out shoe
"Are you sure?" She asks again. I nod. "That's funny because Jarvis informed me this morning that you haven't taken them since we left." I bow my head, finding the floor very interesting.
3.   Keep your phone on you at all times when out.
"What the hell?" I scream, turning around, brushing the hair out of my face. My demeanour drops once I see the person standing in front of me. I'd recognise him anywhere. Even though his hair has grown out and he has a beard. His eyes are still the same.
"Right, you have this lesson and next to practice then you're preforming to the class. Get in your pairs and start." He claps his hands and sits back down at his desk. Everyone starts shuffling about, asking each other to work with them. No one bothers to come near me and Wade. We only work with each other. I turn to my boyfriend with a smile.
Call us brutal
"Tony I swear to God if you wake her up you're not getting any for a week."
"Nat made pancakes?" He asks just to clarify.
"Of course Miss Tyler. I must inform you that due to the Baby Monitor protocol, I am programmed to record everything in your room from this point on until Wade leaves." I smile at the ceiling.
"Good morning." I exclaim, kissing Lila on the head.
"I love it baby. Thank you."
"Nat! Wanda! You made it." I hug both of my Aunts as they step through the door.
Yes I know it's too late
"Well, you must've been well behaved, I can't say I remember you at all." I smile at her.
"Hey kid." Peter's voice breaks the young woman out of her trance. "We did it." Tyler looks over the city, a small smile tugging on the corners of her mouth.
"So what do you think? Should I fight this or run with it?"
"Come on, let's go get you a drink" I say, pulling him towards the bar. His hand rest gently on my hip, stopping me in my tracks.
"I love you too Tyler."
"Hey Ty, ready to go?" I nod at the 22 year old, pulling him in for a hug and landing a kiss on his cheek.
"Sarcastic little Punk."
"I could go for pizza." Tony says realising we won't. "What do you guys say?" I just nod as Pete says 'pizza's good' Steve claps his hands together making me jump slightly.
"Did you know that they changed your name?" He asked. I shake my head, resting it on my arms on the table. The class flew surprisingly quickly and before I knew it I was walking out of the door heading into my next class, music. Even though Midtown is a science and technology school, you have to pick one arts subject for creativity so I naturally chose music along with Wade whilst the Pete and MJ chose Art and Ned chose drama. I sit in my normal seat which is next to my boyfriend and right in front of the door. Mr Warren begins to talk about something but I just drown him out, staring at the keyboard, thinking of all the melodies I could be playing right now instead of listening to him.
"What is 'Gender fluid'?" Thor asks. God he's like a child.
I've got a dream
I want it that way
"You speak Russian?" I nod my head. "That's awesome. Now, why don't you come sit? I want to get to know you." I do as she says and sit in the vacant seat next to her. We talk about anything and everything and by the time she had to leave, I felt like I'd known her my whole life. I rose from my seat to wave the two adults off. As we approached the door Bruce gave me a curt nod and stepped over the frame and Natasha drew me in for a hug.
open and Pete comes running in, sweaty and out of breath. I drown out his streams of excuses and apologies as I get a bottle of water, downing it in one.
I sit in tone of the chairs facing the water, reading through a revision book for an exam I've got tomorrow. I know all of this stuff and more but I'm just worried. Fuck anxiety.
Tyler's Pov
"Great, I'll go and order that, you guys get ready for dinner. Tones will you stay up here and then show them where the dining room is please?" He was answered with a quick 'yes darling' from Tony as him and Peter had already gotten into a discussion about his web shooters. The buff blond shakes his head. He looks at me and notices the lack of attention I am getting. Again, not complaining. He stretches a hand out for me to take which I do hesitantly. He leads me through to what I'm assuming is the kitchen and picks up the phone, gesturing me to take a seat at the island in the centre. I pull out a white stool and have trouble pulling myself up onto it. Curse being short. Steve looks over at me, phone in hand.
I jump out of the shower; a towel wrapped tightly around my body and using another to rub at my hair. Being the absolute genius I am, note the sarcasm, the outfit I plan on wearing is already set out on the bed. I change quickly, hating the feeling of the cold on my arms. The outfit consists of some black sweats, an oversized MIT crimson hoodie and fuzzy socks. As you can probably tell, I'm in a lazy mood. Giving my hair a quick blast with the hair dryer and throwing it up into a messy bun before grabbing my guitar and heading towards the living room where the super soldier waits. Sliding, quite literally, into the room and catching my Papa's attention as his once focused frown turns into a smile. My expression mirrors his and I plop down on the coffee table in front of the sofa where he's sat. I lay the case gently on the floor next to me and pull out my guitar. It was an acoustic guitar. Made of a light oak with black and gold trimmings. It was small but so was I when I was 7.
"But it's a trick." Clint states from his place on the floor. Thor places down his beer.
"I'll be fine Pete. I promise."
"Papa, we have no idea what any of this is." Pete says looking down, almost as if he's embarrassed. Tony facepalms.
"Umm mine's pretty basic really. Both parents died when I was young. I was sent to live with my aunt and uncle but my umm, uncle was murdered and a year later my aunt killed herself and I've been here ever since." Sympathetic glances were sent his way. I didn't bother, I knew he hated them.
Sun sets on the city of Queens. The masked hero lays on the roof of an apartment complex, taking in the view around them, scouting for crimes that needed someone like himself to step in. Across the way, the mysterious figure sees something. Or rather someone. A smile creeps up onto his face as he pulls the mask up slightly so his mouth was uncovered.
"Seriously dude. What gives?" I ask. All three of them just laugh and I mumble under my breath, cursing them.
"And you've been an idiot." Dad counters. Papa along with Bucky, Clint, Wanda, Scott Lang and Sam refused to sign the accords which basically mean that they are fugitives and are running from the Government and Ross wants us, well Dad to turn them in. the divorce was finalised about 2 weeks ago and Dad got easy custody over me and Peter. I don't really mind. Papa hurt Dad. He deserves everything he gets. I'm not really sure what we're trying to achieve here but we stand with Vision, Nat, Rhodey and some king from Wakanda that like to shout "WAKANDA FOREVER!!!!" it gets quite annoying.
"They are my kids and you better stop bullying them. I know what you do to them every day Eugene and if that continues I will personally make sure you never get into a good college. Capuche?"
"Hey beautiful." Her and dad share a quick kiss before she pulls away, leaning over to give me and my brother a kiss on the head.
I never want to hear you say
"Yo Penis Parker! No Tits Tyler!" Flash. Me and Pete share a glance. I roll my eyes at the bullies behaviour. He slams his hands down on the table.
"You're going to be fine Tyler. You're smart. Nothing to worry about." Mom reassures me, running her fingers through her red hair.
"Oh my, you guys." She hugs us just like dad did, only a little tighter.
"Welcome back Miss Tyler, Master Peter and Miss MJ. Shall I alert Boss of your arrival." Jarvis asks as he opens the gates allowing us to drive through.
Tell me why
Wake me when the shakes are gone
"Thanks Hermione." Before she can reply mom steps into the room. Her white gown was actual beauty. It had a sweetheart neckline with gems on the seam, it was fitted and had a long, flawless train at the back.
"What the fuck Parker. Quinzel. Who did you sleep with to get Hawkeye to pretend to know you?" I get up in Flash's face.
"Dad gave him a warning. And you look beautiful by the way."
"And you two must be the ones Steve talked my ear off about. Hi, I'm your uncle Bucky." Pete says hello back and I just wave shyly. Bucky smiles and hands us each a bag.
"Jarvis mute." I pull my phone out and follow the directions. The music room was on the common floor which was handy, nobody slept on that floor. I sit myself down at the grand piano, my fingers tracing lightly over the ivory keys. I begin to press down making small sounds escape the instrument. A familiar melody fills my ears. My hands knowing exactly which keys to press with o hesitation. Aunt May taught me to play this when I was young. How could I forget? I play through the intro and start singing the verse.
"What for?"
"Shut up and open them dork."
"This time two years ago, I didn't know which direction I was going in. Most of the family I'd ever had was gone and the one person I had left, I was scared to take my eyes off her for one minute in case I found her on that bathroom floor, surrounded by drugs and her own blood. When Captain America and Tony Stark walked in and told us they wanted to adopt us, I genuinely thought it was fake, that I was on some sort of joke TV show or something. But I don't regret saying yes. You've been the best dad's I could have ever asked for and I love you guys." Peter passes the mic over to me as he gets hugged by dad and Papa. I step forward and glance out into the crowd, my eyes meeting Natasha's almost instantly. The redhead gives me an encouraging smile and I raise the mic to my lips.
"Thanks Jarv."
No she doesn't know what she's missin'
"Sir says it's fancy casual Miss Tyler. May I recommend a dress shirt and some jeans?"
"You're right Tone, she's a mini you who looks like a mini me." All the boys laugh and I snigger under my breath. I grab the cup that was made for me and take a gulp, savouring the bitterness as I walk back to my seat next to my brother who was still on his phone. I roll my eyes at his behaviour but before I could say anything, it was being ripped out of his hands.
"Come on Cap." Everyone starts cheering. He's able to move it slightly and the alarm on Thor's face is comical. Soon enough he steps back, holding up his hands in surrender. Bruce turns to me and Nat.
"Come on Underoo's." he says as he plucks him off with ease, throwing him over his shoulder. Pete squeals as he lifts his head up, his big brown eyes locking on me.
And myself has reappeared
"Okay then class, first we're going to." I zone out form then on. I know the tower off by heart. You'd think I lived there. Oh wait. I hear shuffling from above me.
"I've missed you so much. Dad was bummed you and Thor couldn't make it to the wedding."
"Why don't we just say that you're all not worthy and move on with our lives? I do believe it's way past the man of Spiders and the Maiden of Shadows bedtime." Ever since Thor found out our superhero identities, those are the names that have stuck.
What did I do that was so bad to make my mom leave me again? Was I too much trouble?
"Don't make promises you can't keep."
"I know but I wanted to. I got one for each of them actually but you never told me how old they were so I had to kind of guess."
I've got scars and lumps and bruises
"It's a surprise. Now grab a slip it needs to be returned by Wednesday as the trip is on Friday." Everyone grabs a letter. Pete grabs two and shoves them into his bag, giving me a thumbs up.
"You'll be fine. They won't embarrass you."
And let's not even mention my complexion
"You used to live here?"
"I just don't want to be alone." I mutter embarrassed. She smiles.
I don't feel like myself when I do this. There's no tears. No pain. Nothing. What's wrong with me?
That I want it that way
The ride to Stark Towers seemed to take a life time and a half. But before long, we were pulling into the private garage of the Stark-Rodgers. With claims to collect our bags later, we set off to the entrance of the tower, stepping into the elevator. I look around in complete and utter awe. I've never been in a place this big. I can see Tony and Steve staring at me and my brother, small smiles tugging at the corner of their lips. We ride up to the 34th floor. As the mechanical doors open, I gasp in amazement. Tony smirks at me.
"It's not funny. I need caffeine!" We both laugh at the older man and I notice Pete standing in the doorway, a smile of adoration plastered on his face. I'm not the only one to notice him.
"No. No darling you're not there, you're here with us. open your eyes and tell us what you can see, прекрасный." I open my eyes to see both assassin's staring at me in concern.
"Now, small people." Tony begins. "How about we go sign these papers and get the hell out of here?" Me and Pete cheer a little but Steve just shakes his head and directs a 'Language' at his husband. Once again, we guide the superheroes through the maze that is the orphanage and end up outside Conrad's office. Tony raises his fist and knocks steadily on the door and it soon opens.
"Tyler? Kid, can you look at me please?" Tony's voice was soft and loving. I gulped before lifting my head up, glancing slightly towards them. Tony smiles at me. I move my eyes towards Steve and see him standing there, tears in his eyes. I slowly let my grip of Peter's arms relax and I turn around fully to face the adults. The brunette opens his arms, inviting me into them and I do just that. I collapse into his embrace and just like before, I feel the other two joining in. We break up the hug once again but Steve doesn't let go of me. He keeps his arm firmly around me the whole time which I wasn't particularly complaining about. We walk up a few stairs and come to two doors next to each other. One is red and the other one is back. I study the red door in front of me, it has patterns on it and towards the top, it held a black letter P. the black door was the same only this time it had a letter T in red writing on the top. I tilt my head to look at Steve quizzingly, he chuckles.
"You're welcome darling."
"I got her." Peter promises, lifting the small form out of my arms, trying not to jostle her awake.
"Why don't you go play with the other kids yeah? Forget the smelly grownups aren't there okay?" He nods and leaves to go play, not without a final hug of course. I turn back to face my older brother who is standing there, trying not to laugh. I smack him around the back of the head and grab his hand.
We were driving for a while, playing stupid car games like I spy and the car game, the radio acting as background noise. That was until a particular song came on.
"Pepperoni." I answer simply. He nods his head and dials the number. Speaking in an important sounding voice, he orders two large pepperoni pizza's, one meat feast and one margarita. I open my mouth to argue and tell him that I don't want one but he just presses a finger to his lips, sending me silent. He thanks the person on the other end of the line and ends the call. He turns to me with a smile and I smile back. We keep the conversation light until there is a knock on the penthouse door. Steve sends me to retrieve the others and wash my hands. I go and tell them that dinner is here and Tony leads us into thellmmm bathroom where we can clean up. I wash my hands carefully, trying not to spill any water and feel insanely proud of myself when I realise I didn't. Me and Pete chat excitedly about some of the improvements Tony had made to his web fluid as we walk through to the kitchen. Plopping ourselves down at the island where the plates and pizza boxes lie. With the go ahead from Steve, both brunettes started piling up their plates and scoffing down the slices. I make a disgusted face at Peter and he lets a muffled 'what?' out through his full mouth. The other blonde sits opposite me a single slice on his green plastic plate, he places it down after taking a bite, chewing and swallowing before looking pointedly at me.
"As for eating, we want you to eat at least 2 meals a day and a snack, 3 if you can. As soon as you can eat 3 meals a day for a week solid, we'll introduce Shadow Knight to the streets again." I grimace but agree to Tony's rules none the less. I want to be Shadow again.
"No nothing like that. Orphanage never asked. And I've got to say, you guys adopting us was the best birthday present in the world." Tony wraps his arms around me.
As the song finishes we all collapse onto the sofa, laughing, wiping the tears from our eyes, suddenly exhausted. I yawn and rub my eyes, hoping neither of them saw but I'm not that lucky. Nat taps my shoulder and before I can even respond, she picks me up bridal style, a frown making its way upon her face.
"Dad!!!!!" I groan as he pulls me and Wade apart. Papa appears by Dad's side, his arm wrapped around his waist. Wade does the same to me and I snuggle into his side. Papa clears his throat.
"Underoo's. Go nuts. Stay safe. Call us if you need us and be back by 4. We're going out tonight." Pete lets out a very unmanly squeal as he hugs both men, saying his thank you's before rushing to get his new suit. The men in the room turn to look at me and I sway back and forth between the balls and heels of my feet. I clap my hands and crack my knuckles.
"Blakey, they want to take us home with them!! Forever! They're not gonna send us back like they did! They promised." Lexie tells her older sister excitedly. Blake looks up at us in shock.
"Oops, looks like you're a little wet. I'd go take a shower if I were you."
Can't reach to your heart
"You want to adopt us?" Her voice was lower than her sisters but cautious and harmonious in its own way.
"Oh Tyler, why didn't you tell us?" Bucky asks.
"Aren't you going to eat Tyler?" He asks, his blue eyes searching mine. 'God, way to make me feel guilty.' I think as I muster up an excuse.
"Wanna go and see what's next door?" I ask playfully. She nods. I offer her my hand and she takes it warily, allowing me to gently pull her to the dark oak door. I gesture towards it.
"Just go change Pete." Steve waves him off and I smile at him as he walks past. He doesn't smile back. 'that's weird.'
"As you wish." Hot water pours out of the shower head, making my tense shoulders relax almost instantly. Okay. You guys know how showers work, I'll spare you the details. Once the shower had finished I wrapped my body in a fluffy white towel that was waiting just outside the door. 'when the hell did that get there?' Pushing the thought out of my head, I walk out of the ensuite and into my room, shivering as the cold air comes in contact with my arms. I stride over to my wardrobe and peek inside wondering what the hell there is to wear. The song Highway to Hell comes into my head. I fucking love that song. Humming the words whilst flicking through the array of shirts. Humming quickly becomes singing as I get to the chorus.
"So you and MJ then?" My dad asks with a smirk.
"Hello? Tyler? You with us kiddo." I roll my eyes as I mark my place, setting the book down, turning my attention to my dinner. A bowl of pasta with cheese and tomato sauce is placed in front of me. Steve looks at me apologetically even though I know he's not the slightest bit sorry.
No she doesn't know what she's missin'
"Go away." My voice is muffled by the fluffy cloud.
"Where's Pete?" I ask. Tony points to the living room and I head in that direction. Spotting my brother and promptly 'Yeeting' myself onto him.
"There's something I need to ask someone very special." He walks over to Pepper and gets down on one knee.
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Sometimes I just wanna cave
"You only live once." I dry out my hair quickly, brushing it through with the detangler that Nat gave to me before picking up the scissors and facing my reflection once more. I grab a chunk of hair, sizing it up before snapping the blades together, watching as the loose ends fall to the floor. I continue cutting till it's the same length the whole way around my head. Brushing it through again and cutting off any stray hairs. It came to just above my shoulder. 'Passible.' Before I even have chance to move, my bedroom door swings open and Tony walks through.
The other on my heart,
"What name change?" Steve asks genuinely confused.
"It doesn't matter Ty. I'll do it for you." He checks his watch. "We better start getting ready. I love you." I start to make my way out of the room.
"Want to come and see our rooms? I'm sure they'll tell you more than we can." I say smartly and I lead the group up three flights of stairs, up to the top floor where our bedrooms lie. We go into my brother's room first because that's where we spend most of our time, building this or improving that. The adults look around the walls and I know why, every time I draw Pete something, he hangs it on the wall, like Aunt May used to. There's a periodic table above the bed because, reasons and then finally, in the far corner, our inventor's desk.
"Well you're just in time, lunch is ready, please come in." Peter and MJ follow mom into the house and I hang behind slightly with my dad.
"It didn't have your birthday on your file, we just assumed it was an unspeakable day." I laugh at my Papa's reasoning.
"Hey everyone, I'm Peter. Peter Stark and most of you probably know that I'm Tyler's older brother. I've known Tyler for 18 and a half years and I've never seen her as happy and as content as when she looks at MJ. MJ you fixed my little sister and I owe you everything for that, you make her so happy and I can see that she makes you happy but you must know, hurt her and you'll have the whole Avengers on your door step."
"That's Stark-Rogers thank you very much. Now as I was saying. Nat has said that she would be happy to do some light sparring with you every weekend and teach you some stuff along the way. The gym is always open but no lifting without anyone spotting you and just don't go overboard yeah kiddo?" My smile widens.
"You can get some if you want." I look at her confused. 'Why isn't she mad about this?' As if she senses my worry, she crouches to my level, her hands on my shoulders.
"It's fine." I cut him off. "We have our own." I take out my lanyard and put it around my neck. It's black with 'TIGER' printed on the back and a picture of me and Peter pulling a stupid face as my facial recognition. Peter's is red and blue with a spiderweb pattern with 'UNDEROO'S' printed on the back. MJ's is normal but she's getting her personalised one within the next week. Ned and Wade's are just regular because they don't use them that much.
"So, Tyler. You nervous?" Papa asks, leaning on the counter next to me.
"I'm coming Jesus. Keep your hair on grandpa!" I place the black beanie on my head, pulling it down over my ears, keeping my hair in place. I give myself a once over in the mirror. The white shirt hugged my body but not in a slutty way. I actually looked decent for once. I sit on the edge of my bed to pull on my shoes as my bedroom door swings open. Dad looks at me, an exasperated sigh leaving his lips. I raise an eyebrow.
"Well yes, I have changed a lot since you last saw me, got my hair cut, eyebrows done. Oh and I'm not permanently covered in bruises anymore."
"Can I sit with you?" I ask gently. She nods and scoots over. I move so I'm sitting cross legged next to the child. She looks up at me with wide eyes and cautiously places a book on my thigh.
"Tyler? Gosh you're so grown up! You look beautiful. I see being adopted did wonders for you."
"No." I protest. "No. I'm fine." Neither of them look convinced.
"I assume some of these rules apply to all four of us." Steve looks at me confused.
"Okay, I get it. I'm short. Move on!" I yell angrily causing them to laugh again.
"Miss Quinzel, if you are quite finished, I am not." I roll my eyes and sit on my desk.
"Stay safe Loser." MJ whispers in my ear. I chuckle.
"Tyler! Peter! Dinner!!" Pepper yells from the back door.
"Boy."
"Tyler?!" I know that voice anywhere. I turn my head in the direction of the voice.
"For the last time, it's MJ." She says, her voice dangerously low. The teacher simply shrugs her off and continues listing off names. It was going smoothly until she got to mine.
"Peter Stark-Rogers, Level 10. Welcome back Peter, I shall Inform both bosses about yours and Tyler's arrival."
"I know darling. I know. I'm sorry if I made you think I think of you like that. I wasn't insinuating that at all. I was just a little confused." I nod my head at his words and pull back kissing his cheek.
"Coming Papa!" I yell back, ripping my bed to pieces in search of my phone, finding it inside of one of my pillow cases. I grab it and run out of my room, skidding into the kitchen with skill and jumping onto the counter, accepting the cup of coffee that was being offered to me by dad.
"Miss Quinzel, that sort of behaviour will not be tolerated. One more strike and I'm calling home. I stand up.
"You saw that then." I nod. "He didn't mean it Tyler, he was angry, I said things he didn't like. It just got a little heated."
"Still fancy, now go get dressed. Underoo's wear one of your suits and Tyler, no skinny jeans for the love of god." I smirk at my father's obvious pleading and stand up from my seat, putting my plate in the dishwasher and skipping off to my room with a playful kiss to the men sat at the table.
"I really don't but thank you. I guess." I say nothing else as I lug the final box over to the rest of them, giving a small groan as I all but drop it. I turn to look at my, new family I guess. They're all stood there, laughing at something Peter said.
Oh how she rocks
"We're going to have a good time прекрасный. I promise."
"I ran away from them." I said simply, wrapping my arms around my knees.
Tell me why
"Thank you, Pete. Thank you."
"Which Movie do you want to watch Tyler?" The 5 year old asks, holding up Frozen and Toy story. I could see the pleading in her eyes so I picked Frozen despite my major distaste for the movie.
"What are you all doing?" He asks them, groaning in frustration when he doesn't receive an answer. I cower further into Natasha's side as Clint gets angrier by the second. Steve eventually speaks up.
Tell me why
"Ms Stark, we need you to look over these plans and set a date for a press conference about the new line of prosthetic limbs that Stark Industries are now creating. Oh and-"
"Go. Be with your family. I'm sure your social worker will be in touch with us soon enough." I don't need to be told twice. I say a quick goodbye and run to my family. We all burst out the door and start singing 'We are family' as we head towards the limo. Dad claps his hands together.
"She wrote me a letter, telling me that she'd changed and that she wanted me back. All I thought about when I was younger was having a family. And I just. I don't know what to do." I sit back down after my little rant and place my head in my hands.
Listen to Iron Maiden, baby, with me, ooh
"Hey Tyler, you want to dance or something?"
"Let's just get you back to bed kid." Clint says, reaching his hand out to help me up.
"After everything that you've done, you think you can hug me? News flash Rogers. I'm not a Rogers anymore." The heartbroken look on his face almost makes me feel bad. Almost. I turn to his partner.
"Looks like the party started without me." I turn to look at the source of the voice.
"Alright everyone. We're here. If you haven't already guessed, we're going to Stark Towers."
"Tears." My breathing was beginning to regulate and my heart slowed down. I collapse into Clint's open arms.
"You're more than good Ty. How about can't help falling in love? That was our wedding song."
I want it that way
"Yes Miss Quinzel, maybe you should listen to your boy toy over there." I clench my fists again, trying to calm myself down. Luckily, Arron steps in.
"No. No Jarvis, that won't be necessary. Is there a piano anywhere in the tower?"
"It happens sometimes, it's just a side effect." They both nod and Tony decides to head back to their bedroom to get some sleep.
"Breakfast is in 10. And you're all going to be late for school if you don't hurry up." That woke us up. Of course. The spring break ended today. It's Monday. Fucking Monday.
"Your kids?"
"What? When did we decide on that?!" Tony asks. Steve smirks.
"Now close your eyes." He says. I do just that and I feel something being draped over my shoulder and a slight weight in my hand.
The week couldn't have gone slower if it tried. But it's finally Friday and the room is literally buzzing with excitement.
I sit in my biology lesson, watching the seconds tick down. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. RING!!!!!! There's a rush as students scramble to grab their bags and rush out of the door. I'm one of them. MJ waits for me at the door of the classroom as we begin to walk to our lockers. Peter, Wade and Ned are already there, ready to leave. I open my locker and pull out my homework and books that I'll need, slamming it shut before turning to my friends.
"Where is Peter? I told him to be back an hour ago." And as if by magic, the door swings
About an hour passes and the DJ announces the first dance as a married couple. Mom and Dad go to the dance floor and begin to sway to the opening of 'Thinking out loud' by Ed Sheeran, Mom's choice. I feel someone tap on my shoulder and I turn my head to see MJ standing there, wearing a short red dress.
"I'm more than okay." I reply, snuggling against her, allowing sleep to wash over me.
"You got a lousy taste in men kid."
"Good." With that, she pushes the door open and I gasp. It looks like the room was made for me. Light grey and turquoise walls, a king-sized bed in the centre, a wardrobe up against the far corner, a small but spacious desk along the back wall, underneath a half wall window, a corkboard on the wall for me to stick pictures and stuff on. I look at Natasha.
"Tyler!!!! I swear to God woman get your ass down here now. We're going to be late!" I roll my eyes at my wife's behaviour.
I try and I try and I try and I try and I try
"Well we were just about to watch the Revengers. You're more than welcome to join us."
I've got a dream
"Sure kid, what do you need help with?" He asks, moving closer to look over Peter's shoulder. I know he's asking about the robot we were building the other day. We completed the circuit but nothing happened afterwards which was a bit of a let-down.  I take a seat on Peter's bed so I can watch what Tony's doing as he works in silence. We stay that way for a few minutes before I feel a hand on my shoulder. I flinch away from the touch and Steve apologises immediately. I smile at him.
"Oh, прекрасный. What's wrong?" I feel her arms wrap around my shoulders and I sob onto her, my tears soaking her shirt though she didn't really seem to mind as she just ran her fingers through my greasy, knotted hair and hummed a soothing lullaby, calming me enough to talk. I take a deep breath.
"Uncle Bucky!" I exclaim, throwing myself into his embrace which he gladly returns.
"I tried to forget. I tried to forget. They won't let me forget. They want me to forget but they won't let me." I'm sobbing now. Strong arms wrap around me, rocking back and forth. I
On an island that I own
"Of course I can kid. What's got you biting again?" I shrug.
"Auntie Nat!!" I hop off the counter and sprint into the redhead's arms.
"Very Well."
"I better make it good then haven't I?" A cheeky grin spreads across her face. "Come on. Hot topic is waiting."
It won't be long until they get rid of you. The voice inside my head speaks volumes. The worst thing is, I know that it's wrong but I can't help overthinking it. I was too busy inside my head I didn't realise them making their way over to me until Pete's hand waves in front of my face, snapping me out of my dazed state.
"Ty, Nat says that they're at the hospital so looks like we're walking back." Pete tells me.
"What's up dad?" I regret asking the question.
"This needs changing." He whispers, more to himself than to me. I take a seat on the bed as he goes to fetch the first aid kit, cursing under his breath when he sees there are no more bandages.
"You'll be hearing from my lawyer within the next week." Tony says to Conrad and with that, he turns to us. "Come on kids, let's get your stuff packed up." Me and Pete rush upstairs, Steve hot on our tail. We get to our rooms and split off. Tony comes into mine to help me pack up my stuff which isn't a lot. Most of the clothes are hand me downs and it doesn't help when you're the oldest so most of my clothes once belonged to Peter. Don't judge me, they're comfy. I pack all of my art stuff away and throw my bag over my shoulder. I do a once over of the now almost empty room. I remember something. How could I forget it? I reach under my bed and pull out my guitar case. Uncle Ben got it for me for my birthday before he died. I've kept it ever since. I carefully swing it over my shoulder along with my bag and walk out of my room going into Peter's to see how he's getting on. The scene in front of me was nothing short of pure comedy; Peter sat on top of his suitcase as Steve tried to zip it up. I laugh at the two men and walk over to our desk, beginning to put things into boxes and bags. I was soon joined by the billionaire, playboy and we worked in complete silence, putting books and tools away and piling them up by the door whilst Steve and my brother took everything down from the walls. I didn't even realise I was singing until Tony joined in with the chorus. Heat rushes towards my cheeks and I look down. I can feel Steve smiling at me.
"Tyler don't." He begs. Flash stands back up and pushes Peter out of the way.
"Yikes!" I yell, covering my eyes like a 3-year-old. They jump apart, crimson spreading across their cheeks.
"You seem in a good mood this morning."
"Steve!" I hear Dad say and then a door slam. I can't take it anymore. I hold my head in my hands and start to sob. Wade pulls me onto his lap and starts rocking me. I look at Pete who is sat there emotionless. Tony is staring at the door Steve left out of. And nobody else dare say anything. Dad coughs gaining our attention.
"Morning Ty. Sleep well?" I say yeah as I reach for a bottle of water. He looks me up and down, eyebrow raised.
"Kids, this is Dr Bruce Banner and this is Natasha. Guys these are the two terrors we adopted: Peter and Tyler." They waved at us so we waved back, the atmosphere awkward as nobody knew what to say. Tony clapped his hands.
"Okay but we need to ask her first." I nod and we make our way over to the small girl who was still colouring.
"Well it's rigged right?" Dad asks Thor, sitting back down in his chair.
"Hell yeah I did. He was dead naming and misgendering Peter. I couldn't just let it happen." Steve wraps his arm around my shoulder.
"This place is amazing." Blake says, holding onto MJ's hand, gawking up at the house. I chuckle at her reaction.
"If it's okay with you," Steve starts looking at both of us. "We'd like to adopt you." I couldn't believe it. My brain refused to process it. I hear Peter say yes and turn to me but I'm frozen. I've been waiting for this day for so long and now it's here.
"Go back inside Kids, lunch will be getting cold." I look up and lock eyes with the redhead assassin.
"Hey kid, I would offer you some coffee but machine won't work." I raise an eyebrow.
"Hey MJ you up for it?" She smirks back at me.
Yeah I'm just a teenage dirt bag, baby
"Jarv did you get that?" Dad asks standing up.
"No we said you had to eat more, not that you're excused if you do." I grumble under my breath but sit down anyway. Once the others had finished, I retreat to my room, grabbing my new state of the art Stark phone, shoving it in my back pocket. I walk towards the elevator, pressing the up button.
"Care to explain?" Tony asks, still looking a little shaken and confused.
"Come in Spidey-boy!" I yell. Ignoring the strange look I got from Steve. Peter and Tony walk into my room and I see Tony looking around out of the corner of my eye.
"Bye." With a final wave, my body jumps so I'm back in my room, Mom and Dad still there, sat patiently on my bed, waiting for my return. They both stand when they see me.
Yeah, I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
"I'll be right back okay." I move to stand but a hand stops me. She shakes her head, curls flying everywhere. I smile in understanding.
Her boyfriend's a dick
"Ah Mrs and Mrs Stark-Jones, it's a pleasure to have you here." I nod.
"Miss Tyler. It's time to wake up. Mr Rogers has asked me to inform you that breakfast is ready." Jarvis' voice fills my room. 'How the fuck did I get up here?' Last night after Clint's little outburst, we all stayed on the common floor and watched movies together. Without even bothering to get dressed just yet, I leave my room and follow the smell of fresh berries and waffles to the kitchen. I walk up to Tony who, as usual, is manning the coffee maker. I reach over him and kiss his cheek, pressing the setting I like on the maker.
"Hey cutie. What's your name." I have a soft spot for kids okay? Sue me!
"Ty, chill. First off, you've got me and Wade. Second, Nat will never let anything happen, she told you that herself. And if you come out to them, I will as well." Pete grabs my hand, forcing me to sit next to him on the bed.
"Good eye Jarv." I reach into the wardrobe and pull out a pair of white jeans and a black button down.
Waltzing into the kitchen to see Tony nursing a cup of coffee. He perks up when he sees me.
"Nu uh."
"Sure." I reply quickly, trying to ease her anxiety. Without another word, she begins. Her fingers pulling and tugging lightly, twisting and twirling. Aunt May used to plait my hair like this, every night to help me sleep.
"Can I help you?" She asks in a bored tone, picking at her nails.
"We just did. Now, Tones," He picks up the phone and throws it at his partner who catches it with ease. "You call the place and kids, you go and get changed." All three of us salute him as we set about the tasks that were given to us. I walk up to my room with Steve on my trail. When I finally reach my destination, I turn to look at the man, questioning why he was here.
"Yeah, it doesn't seem to have changed much since I was here." This caught Blake's attention.
8.   No patrol when grounded.
"What's his problem?" I ask the blond who was brushing his hair. He turns to me, glancing me up and down.
"Flash, did you forget what happened in the lab already? Did that bit of the day wriggle out of your tiny little brain? I'd gladly put it back in, rebreak your nose. Especially now I have back up."
"Who hurt you?" Her voice was laced with venom. I open my mouth to speak but I couldn't. The words weren't coming out so I did the only thing I could. I raised my shirt, exposing my right side where the words "PROPERTY OF HYDRA." Were carved. Her hand flies to her mouth and she pulls me tighter into her arms, whispering how sorry she is that any of this happened. I reassured her that I was fine and even though I could tell she didn't believe me, she didn't push the subject any further, just instructing me to get some rest which I plan on doing anyway.
"Tyler," He begins, throwing the rules at me. "Right now you're breaking rules 6, 7, 18 and 20. We just want to help kiddo. Please let us." I look up at them. They both look at me, hope evident in their eyes. I shrug my shoulders. Steve gets out of his chair and I feel him sit in the one next to me. He takes my petite hand into his bigger one and holds it tightly.
"Shit." I jump out of bed and head straight to the bathroom, sorting my, stuff, out, grabbing my toothbrush, hairbrush and extra pads. Shoving them into my worn-out converse backpack along with a spare t shirt, leggings, fuzzy socks and my Hawkeye pyjamas because apparently they have those. I put my phone in my pocket and carry my stuffed tiger, who I've named Lily if anybody's interested. Like Tiger-Lily from Peter Pan. Yeah? No? Anyway. I yank the bag onto my back and carry it through the halls, throwing it down on the island and pulling on my Black Widow converse, because they have those as well. Who knew. Tony walks in with two empty mugs.
"Thank you Ned. I have something to hit people with now."
"I illegally downloaded the Glee cover of Somebody to love." We all share a look before bursting out laughing.
"I'm Trans. I was born a girl but now I'm a boy. Me and Tyler are the same people you met today and last week. This doesn't change who we are. I hope you can see that." Yet again, silence takes over. I don't look up as I hear the sound of a chair scraping on the floor.
After food, I find myself sat at my desk, pen and paper in front of me, pondering over what to write. 'Should I even do this? Does she deserve a response? She's my mom, I owe her this right?' I pick up the pen in my right hand and place it to the paper. No more hesitations.
"Ah, there's sleeping beauty. Enjoy the sleep Princess?" instead of stooping to his level of sarcasm, I simply flip him off as I tie my laces.
The party ends and people start filing out, the only people left are my parents, Pete, MJ, Clint and Natasha. I hug my Mom one last time.
"Trust me you don't want to."
"Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!"
"My dad's are pissing me off." I explain. They both nod in understanding.
"How did you hack into the system to change your last name?" He demands.
I'm sorry to my future love
"Let's dance the night away baby."
Am I your fire?
"I better start getting ready. You're still coming by after right?" I ask, he nods, placing a kiss to my forehead.
"She's okay. You're better." His smirk turns into a full-blown grin as he wraps an arm around my shoulder, pulling me into his chest, kissing the top of my head.
"Hey, little bird, calm down. Everything is okay. You're okay. I'm okay. Tasha's okay. Everyone is okay." His calming words didn't help as I continued to internally freak out.
"Hey loser, nervous?" MJ asks me. Her, Pete, Wade and now I guess Natasha are the only ones to know about me.
"Honey! I got her inside!" Dad yells as he runs up the stairs. I punch his back lightly, laughing, trying to get him to put me down. He walks through my room and places me down on the closed lid of my toilet.
"Clint no. I can't. Please don't make me." He stops walking and crouches down so he's at my eye level.
Why don't you love me like you used to do?
"Michelle, I have loved you for years, even when you were with Peter, I knew it was you. You made me laugh when I thought I'd never be able to smile again. You held my hand when I couldn't walk and you helped my through the water when I was on fire. I don't know what I'd do without you and I don't want to know. I don't want to imagine a life without you MJ. I want you to me in mine forever. I want to wake up to your beautiful face every morning, I want to have mini versions of you running around the house, I want to be a mom with you. I want to grow old with you. I don't want to spend one day of my life without you because I know it will be miserable. So, Michelle Jones, will you do me the honour of being my wife?" I hold my breath in anticipation, tears already building up behind my eyes.
"Who's 'they' tiger?" A thousand memories hit me at once. The pain. The torture. The screams. I need to say something.
"I'd love to." I take her hand in mine and pull her onto the dance floor, my arms instantly snaking around her waist whilst hers interlock around my neck. Peter and MJ broke up Just after we moved, he has eyes on.. other people. I'm happy to say that him and Wade are in a committed relationship. I knew that they had eyes on each other since the day I first brought him home. The same thing goes with me and MJ, we both like each other (That's what Pete says anyway) we just don't want to ask. 'This is your moment Tyler. Ask her.'
"Oh kid. I don't know what to say. Do you want to talk about it?" I shake my head no and he nods his in understanding. "Is that what was happening in the gym last night?" I nod.
"Nervous about tonight I guess." Tony smiles at me softly.
"I'm going. Jeeze. Keep your spandex on capsicle."
"Nothing babe. Let's go dance." I pull her onto the dance floor and begin to sway to whatever the song choice was.
"3 things you can hear. You're doing so well darling."
"I'll leave you kids alone."
I've got a dream
"Run with it. What did they do that was so bad to you?" I lean in closer, I feel his breath on my face.
"Actually it's Spider-Man and Shadow Knight. And umm, we're not. I mean we-" Steve raises his hand to cut off my rambling.
"Dad"
"Thanks daddy." I give him a hug which he instantly returns.
14. No locking bedroom doors unless we tell you to for protection.
"Nice to see you too Tiger." That got me out of bed. I shoot into a sitting position and stare wide-eyed at the pair in front of me.
10. No swearing.
"Almost done. 1 thing you can taste."
"Mr Rogers is currently in the gym with Miss Romanoff." Nodding along, I dig through my draws trying to find anything to wear to the gym other than what I wore last night.
"No not at all it's just, Lexington comes with an older sister and you know the system isn't supposed to split siblings up." I look over at my wife who just nods with a smile.
"No point making her even angrier Pete." I say simply, walking down the stairs and standing in my place. Right at the back next to Peter. Sometimes being the oldest wasn't all that much fun. With one final reminder to be good, Conrad pulls open the front doors and a line of adults had already formed. As each adult signed in, we were told to go about our daily activities but stay downstairs. 'This is going to be fun' I think to myself, watching as a group of people go straight for the younger ones. I feel a tugging on my arm and I look down. I see a small child. A mop of blond hair swooping across his face. I squat slightly so I'm at his level, my blue eyes staring into his, a kind smile on my face.
I promised I wouldn't and I did. Please forgive me Auntie Nat.
For the man that left my bed
"Don't touch my brother again." With that I walk back over to my friends who look shocked. I smile at my brother.
"You're not mad?" I ask. He looks at me through the mirror.
"Okay. I love you dad."
"You. I thought you were hurt. You're not supposed to leave without telling your boyfriend. I snuck into your room at the orphanage only to be told you'd been adopted. You can't do that to me Ty." He says, his hands in my hair. I rest mine on his cheeks, placing my lips on his.
"You been causing Mommy and Daddy trouble huh?" I ask as I shift the child so she's sitting comfortably on my hip whilst also putting my bag on the floor. She giggles in response. I place her on the floor before plopping down on one of the bar stools.
"I'm going to miss you so much Baby."
"TYLER!!!!!!" His howling voice cuts through my thoughts. No. I keep pushing on, going as fast as my five-year-old legs allow of me. It wasn't long before he caught up to me, grabbing my arm and throwing me roughly over his shoulder. I kick and scream trying to break from his hold but he's too strong. He throws me to the ground and brings his fist to my cheek. I don't feel it at first then the sharp, burning sensation takes over. I scream as he brings his hands down again and again and again. Reigning slap after punch and punch after slap until I can see properly. He pulls out a knife and lifts up the side of my shirt, pressing the blade into my skin, watching sadistically as blood poured out. I yell. I yell and scream until my throat becomes hoarse and my shouts turn into small whimpers. The man stands up and laughs at my state, spitting on me before walking away. I feel my head get heavy from blood loss and I'm soon unconscious.
"If she wants yes. She is more than welcome to stay the night if her Fathers are okay with it."
"We got our team on it while we were getting you. They've been working since we first met you. Go take a look." He finishes lightly pushing me and my brother towards our respective doors. Our eyes lock and we push the doors open in sync. I gasp at what I see. The wall opposite the door was a full-length window with a very stylish bench/seat type thing in front of it. I step into the room and study the walls. They were painted a light grey colour with music notes and vintage records lining them. A twin sized bed stood against the left-hand wall with two matching bedside tables already equipped with a lamp and alarm clock, along with three boxes that seemed to be gift wrapped. There were two book shelves filled with all the books I'd told Steve about and more. On the right-hand wall, there was a flat screen tv with a games console underneath on a shelf, there was also a VR that I probably won't use but. It was awesome. There was a desk and a spinney desk chair with art books and new shading pencils, water colours, basically anything I could've asked for. Upon further inspection, I noticed a brand new Stark laptop sitting in the centre, Tyler written in sparkly letters. I bring my hand over my mouth as the tears well up in my eyes. I pivot my body to see the two men who have changed my life standing in the doorway, wrapped in each-other's arms.
"In here Tony." He says, trying not to hurt my head any more than it already was. The door creaks open slowly and Tony gasps at the sight. I mean why wouldn't he? There's a 15-year-old boy sat in the middle of a room with a 14-year-old clinging to him like a baby koala, red stains on the latter's hands and shirt sleeves, shaking and sobbing. As if his parenting instincts kick in, the older brunette kneels down beside me, brushing my hair away from my sweaty forehead, slowly gripping my waist and puling me off of my brother and onto him. I don't complain as I sob onto his chest. I feel it rumbling as he speaks to Peter but I pay no attention. He soon sets to work of calming me down. Taking a page out of Peter's book, he starts rubbing circles on my back, humming gently. I feel like a child laying in my father's arms. Oh wait. As my breathing begins to even out, he moves me so I'm sat facing him, my hands in his as he gives me a smile of encouragement. When I finally calm, I fall backwards, laying on the floor, savouring the sweet breaths that were now entering my lungs. Tony grabs my forearms and pulls me back up into a sitting position and I let out a cry of pain. He freezes and takes his hands away from my arms, grabbing my hand instead. His chocolate brown eyes lock with my deep sea blue ones as he starts to slowly pull up the sleeve, almost scared of what waits underneath. He pushes it all the way to my elbow and just stares at it. Before I can fully register it, he pulls me into his arms, locking me in a bear hug. The shoulder of my shirt becomes damp with his tears and I feel my own start sliding down my cheeks. We stay like this for a while until he leans back. He cups my face in his hands, tears still shone in his bloodshot eyes.
Sometimes I just wanna cave
"Wear something nice he said. No skinny jeans he said." As I flick through the different articles of clothing Jarvis speaks up.
"I will dipshit." We pull apart and I'm instantly tackled by Wade.
3 years later:
"None of that please Tyler. You're 14 not 4." He says with a serious tone. I look down feeling. Why the hell do I feel guilty? I shake it off as he lays a board on the table. I study it carefully and see that the top says rules. Tony notices as well and chokes on his coffee, turning to look at his husband.
"Hey Ty. Look at me. Look at me. You're fine okay? You're okay. It's just me. It's okay." He speaks in a calming tone as I grip his forearms, trying to slow down my breathing. I nod slightly and he draws me into his arms, holding me tightly, rubbing rhythmic circles on my back, calming me instantly. I remember where we are and, oh shit. I just almost had a panic attack in front of my heroes. Oh god. I bury my head into my brothers chest, refusing to lift it up to look at the other men. I feel Pete shift and a hand is placed lightly on my back.
16. No going out until homework is complete.
And she doesn't give a damn about me
I have a dream about her
"Sorry old man."
"What are you? 6?" He smirks back.
"Who's Natasha?" I ask, looking at him with wide eyes.
"Sorry Ty, you just got back?" I nod timidly. "Okay well why don't we head to bed? Get some rest. We'll talk in the morning." I nod yet again and follow Steve into my room he sits on my bed as I go into the bathroom to change. 'I'll shower in the morning' I think as I pull on my shorts and tank top, my blonde hair still magically secured in the messy bum I put it in earlier. I walk back towards my dad who stands with a smile, pulling back the comforter for me and bringing up to me neck once I was safely inside. He kisses my forehead and passes me my tiger.
"I'll go first." I whisper to Peter. I step up to the scanner, placing my card on top.
'what's your favourite movie?' 'Favourite colour.' Stuff that both me and Pete knew practically off by heart. It was Tony's turn for a question.
"The tv, Wanda yelling at Tony, my breathing."
"It's good to be back." Her eyebrows shoot up into her hairline.
"I thought you might say that. I'm going to call your dad's in so we can talk this over properly. And because you're still under 16, you can't really make the decision. We have to make it in your best interest."
I do it every, every, every time
"I think it would be best if you stepped outside for now." Natasha spoke over the noise of my sobs but Steve was having none of it.
And I'm sorry for the fans I lost
"We can do that Ty. I suppose it's only fair." Steve agrees and I smile.
One year Later.
"Yes it did. Oh how rude of me. Conrad, this is my wife MJ and we're here to adopt so may we meet some of the children?"
"You like it then." I nod and before I can say anything else, the food came.
"Do you like this arrangement?" I ask suddenly. I can see she's pretty taken aback by my question. I never ask her opinion. Like never. She sighs, moving skilfully around a round a bout.
"Bye Tyler."
Later that night, I was sat in my new room, on my new bed reading an old book. My copy of Dr Jekyll And Mr Hyde was still intact though barely so. Tony had offered to by me a new one countless times before but I'd always denied. It was Uncle Ben's book that I 'borrowed'. Don't judge me, I was grieving. A small knock on my door makes me loose concentration on my book.
"The Stark-Rogers family. The judge is ready for you." Everyone get to their feet. Dad and Papa holding both of my hands in one of theirs each. Everyone who came with us wished us luck before leaving to take their seats in the stands. I have a death grip on both of my dad's hands as the doors were pushed open inviting us through. The three of us take a seat on the raised platform in front of the judge.
"Umm sex doesn't matter neither does age. We just want a kid who's life we can make a difference in."
"Our song babe. Everyday. You get the guitar and I'll fire up the piano." I do just that as I stand up to retrieve a guitar from the stands in the middle of the room. I grab my favourite and sit back down in my chair, quickly tuning it before strumming a familiar tune. Wade joining in with the piano when necessary before I start up with the vocals.
"I don't know what you're talking about." I say even though I do. Tony sighs.
"What do you need to say Tyler?" Dad asks, looking confused. My leg starts bouncing under the table. Nat puts her hand down to stop it and grabs my free one.
"Bye." I mutter as I walk down the all familiar hallway, stopping at the door I spend every Saturday morning in. Not even bothering to knock, I throw the wooden door open.
"Naughty girl." I slip the athletic wear on and find my hoodie, yanking it on over my head, ruffling my hair. My girlfriend is already dressed and by the door when I'm done. I run passed her and grab her hand, pulling her down the stairs.
"Hydra." Everything seems to freeze as soon as that word leaves my mouth. The arms tighten around me and the air becomes thick. Tony is the first one to snap out of it.
"Karaoke is open for business!!!!" The DJ exclaims. Everyone cheers. I glance at one of my best friends.
"Gosh kid, we've got to get you some more clothes. You've barely got anything." His voice echoes throughout the room. He returns a few moments later with my Captain America shirt in his hands, a goofy smile on his face.
"It's just me Angel. Just cleaning you up." He continues to run the wipe up and down my arms until all of the dried blood is gone. The damage wasn't as bad as it's been before, but it certainly wasn't the best. None of us say a word as the blond rewraps my arm. When he finished he stood up from the floor and walked over to my wardrobe. Pulling the doors open and stepping inside.
"Sure." I reply. Pepper smiles at me and clears away the plates coming back with a massive bowl of strawberries, cherries, blueberries and more along with a cup of sugar to dip them in. I pile up a small plate full of the fruits. I see dad looking at me in approval as I eat what's on my plate, even going in for seconds.
"Arron Green, level 5." Jarvis' voice rings out, leaving everyone in awe.
"Are you sure you want these two? I'm sure I can find you some much better children if you'll give me the chance." Tony raises his hand to silence the woman.
"Water would be great please." She gives me a thumbs up and picks Brooklyn up with one arm, grabbing my hand with the other. We enter a very open space with a joining kitchen and living room. Mom places Brooklyn in a booster seat at the small round table.
"You are going to be the death of me Tyler-Kai." I beam at her and waltz over to my fathers side, glancing over his shoulder at the hologram he was looking at.
"Sirs there is somebody that claims they know you and that they are invited to eat with you, shall I show them in." if it was even possible, Steve's grin grows in size. He waves his hand as if to tell them to come in and the gentleman open the door for the stranger to walk through. He was tall, around Steve's height, with long brown hair pulled back into a ponytail, steely blue eyes looking over at us, his obvious muscles straining against his dress shirt. And his hands, one flesh and one metal held small what seemed to be gift bags. The super soldier stands to greet our guest, wrapping him up in a hug.
"Shit, sorry kids. What do you like?" After around ten minutes of explaining, we manage to order our food.
Everyone jumps off the bus, still chatting excitedly. An intern comes running up to us with a clip board and a box.
"No all I'm saying is that Backstreet boys are better than One direction."
"Thank you." Is all she says and I understand, tightening my hold on her.
"We missed you too Mom." Pete says, kissing her cheek. I follow suit before finding myself at my dad's side yet again.
"When we found Tyler in the orphanage, she was getting beaten by the head there. We got pretty scared, she was being choked to death and she didn't seem to care, she wasn't fighting back. We brought her home along with her best friend and she was shaken by everything, showing signs of abuse and neglect from the get go. It took us a few days for her to even let us hug her. She was depressed, suicidal and deliberately self-harming. As soon as we knew, we signed her up for counselling, with her consent and she has been attending that for around 2 and a half months. There has been a slight improvement in her but it will take a while before anything big changes. She has warmed up to us. Become a part of our family. She told us that she loved us a few weeks ago. And we love her. We want what's best for her. And if you think that what's best for her is to be with her mom then so be it. But the kid's just got a bit of structure. The first real insight of care she's every had. Her mom didn't care when she had her and I'm telling you now, you passed up on a beautiful, kind, funny, smart, sarcastic, just one big hell of a young woman." The judge bangs his hammer again.
Wade. I'm so sorry. I wasn't enough for you.
"We should get the kids home." Nat says after a few moments silence.
"Clint, give me your tie." Clint doesn't hesitate pulling off the piece of fabric and handing it over to the billionaire. Tony places the tie around Peter's neck and fastens it tight, sorting out his collar.
"Take a seat, I'll get you your drink." I pull out the chair next to the child and sit down, fishing through my bag for the presents I brought. All I knew is that she had 3 girls. I didn't know the ages. I pull a fluffy bear out of the bag and hold it out in front of my new little sister. We played until mom came back with a coffee, a bottle and a glass of water. She hands me the glass and sits down opposite me.
"Nat." I greet, trying to keep a smile off of my face.
"All done. It's been a while since I've done that but I think it looks good." Nat's voice breaks me out of my thoughts and I give her a tight smile, telling her I love it. She smiles back, hers is real. She holds her slim hand out for me to take, I do hesitantly and allow her to pull me along, all the way through the house to the elevator where Clint is waiting for us.
"Really?"
"Yes please." Lexie replies sheepishly. My grin grows in size and I hold my arms out for a hug which is gratefully accepted by the toddler and my wife.
"Sorry, I thought you'd all gone out." I roll my eyes as Steve embraces Bucky in a hug.
"So, you want to tell me about them?" it takes me a moment to realise what she's talking about.
"Welcome back sir." That's Jarvis' voice!
"I know. I know. But we've just got to stay strong okay? We've got a family so let's hold onto them with everything we got."
"What you colouring honey?" I ask, retaking my seat.
Darkness. Complete darkness. Hand in hand with silence. Senses dialled to 11. Unable to move. Unable to scream. Just forced into the torture of going slowly mad inside of this prison. Feeling lost in both fingers and toes as the bed is submerged deeper into an endless pit of water. So cold. No escape. Chains lying across my chest. Bye, bye breath. Falling further and further. Water entering my ears, sloshing around. Underneath the water, coughing and spluttering does no use. Give up. Never! The weight increases. Falling. 3. 2. 1.
"What the hell was that for?" I ask, opening the cap and taking a sip. The brunette shrugs and passes me a full plate, I take it hesitantly, slightly scared. What the hell? Me? Scared? Of a plate of fucking food? What is wrong with me?
"We're supposed to be preforming a duet of a song that means something to you."
"Are you asking me out?"
"Did you take your meds today?" Mom asks out of nowhere. Dad turns to face me with an eyebrow raised. My leg begins to shake under the table.
"You break the coffee maker again?" He asks, amused which causes Tony to pout harder.
"Let me grab a shower then I'll get my guitar." Without another word, I head towards my room. I can practically feel his happiness radiating from him.
"Going back to who?"
"You two can play with that later. As of now, we are officially late."
"Tony and Pete are in the kitchen arguing over what to eat for dinner, want to go and join them?" I nod, still in his arms and we make our way towards the others, their voices getting louder with every step we took.
"Baby boy, got it. And umm there's an angry looking blonde glaring at me so I'm just gonna put you down now." Wade says as he laces me on the floor and a slightly pissed Natasha walks up to us.
"Mama! Mama! Look! Look!" Both girls were trying to get their mom's attention while Sean goes over to Brooke. He looks up and notices me.
"We won't darling don't worry. We'll see you in 7 days." She says before they leave, giving a final wave over their shoulders, closing the door behind them.
End of flashback.
"Barnes."
"You okay kiddo?" I hum in response, not even turning to face my dad.  We arrive at the clinic shortly after. My dad's go to sign us in and leave me with Natasha.
"Tony! Did you tell everyone about that?" Dad chuckles, kissing his husband.
"I am sorry my lady. I did not mean to startle you." He places a small kiss to my wrapped knuckles. 'what the?' I think. Looking at Steve and he seems to take the hint, making a bs excuse as to why we had to leave. I pick up my water and the assassin grabs my arm lightly, it still hurts but not as much as before.
"Yup. Can you cut my hair again? Like you did before?" I take my bottom lip between my teeth and begin biting away at the skin, Tony notices and pulls on my lip gently so I let it go.
"Have you taken your medication today?" Tony asks as he picks up the scissors.
"I'm okay. I've got to go, hair and makeup just got here. Kill me now."
"I'm going for the night Wade."
