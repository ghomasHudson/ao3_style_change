, she sighs.
“You’re sure?” Natasha asks, a little lower, and – so, so softly. So
(Get up.)
Nodding, Wanda places a hand on Vision’s arm and gently guides him outside, both of them inclining their head towards one another, talking in hushed tones until they step out of the apartment. The door closes slowly behind them, leaving them all staring at nothing once they are gone.
The Quinjet lands. No one moves.
what Rogers wants.
About the phone? No, it can’t be, how could he? Steve doesn’t remember ever taking it out of his pocket when T’Challa was around. How can he know? Could it be that he is talking about
“If I can find the Sanctuary, I can find Thanos. I know the original coordinates, but the ship might not be there anymore. If I could go there—” Nebula slowly falls quiet, thinking.
, because T’Challa is doing it again, he is pushing Steve against something only Steve doesn’t know
But I have to warn you, this chapter might be triggering, because it mentions T'Challa's death more than once, and I also should warn you we are unfortunately reaching a point in the story where that will be mentioned recurringly for a while. It's poor timing, but there's nothing that can be done about it. While I trust all of you to respect the identity of the real man over the character, I'd be lying if I said one thing doesn't affect the other, and the thought of death, even just through a character can be very painful in a time like this. So please, be safe - know your limits, and take care of yourself first.
“Six agents, including Cameron Klein, the one who sent in the call.” Barton replies, voice gruff with disuse, muddled by sleep, but eyes sharp, as he presses buttons and pushes levers with an efficiency and single-minded focus Tony had almost forgotten Barton could have. “We’ll close in at the coordinates he provided.”
She wants to say something, but she has nothing to say.
Pepper stares back, and her eyes are kind but unyielding, the same fire Tony feels in himself when Rogers came too close, when he steeled everything inside himself to fight to defend his logic and get his way. If Tony insists on this, she’ll fight him, no hesitation, because she won’t allow him to go out there now that she knows this.
“The guy who had the Time Stone.” Tony says, and they all go stiff at the same time. “The creepy alien in the spaceship was looking for him. I tried to make him leave, but he wasn’t having it, and the bastard abducted him. So I followed, and tried to get the wizard back.”
He doesn’t blame Tony. He
have to ask. He knows how.
(That’s when she lost her sister.)
“Not to a fight.” Tony frowns morosely. “It still can be dangerous.”
himself forget, made himself pretend the threat wasn’t out there so he could live his blissful, peaceful life, making everyone around him believe he wasn’t paranoid about the imminent threat anymore. All the while, Thor had been gone – doing the work Tony should have done. Keeping watch. Getting ready. Tony should have kept trying, even after what happened to Ultron; but he didn’t, he
The heavy weight was gone.
Tony breathed out, shivering. He could hardly turn his head to the side to vomit acidic tasting stomach fluids, gasping for air.
Was he injured? Had he lost blood? Tony’s mind felt fuzzy, it wasn’t functioning like it usually was. It took him minutes to think of the obvious solution.
“Contact… somebody,” he said frantically, his breathing hitched and for a split second, pure terror clamped around his heart.
“The – the girl,” Tony coughed, his chest clenching painfully. God. It hurts.
But he was – it was the same – the pressure on his chest, cold metal pressed against warm flesh, shrapnel in his heart, like a ticking time bomb, that would go off eventually.
“Yeah?” He replied, the tingling of his fingers and feet now in his chest.
It took only an instant.
The Captain frowned and Tony tried to calm his rapid breathing, managing to sit up, although the world was spinning around him.
He had tried to save her, the young girl, trapped under a collapsed building after one of that shitty new group called Anti-Avengers had lured them to the site and planted a bomb. Seemed like it was more than one, Tony thought. First he felt the stones vibrate, then he heard the sound – the next few seconds passed, but he wasn’t able to do anything.
But this fight, this fight already sounds worse than any they can remember.
The kit enters the corner store, and Mr. Allen looks up as the bell above the door jingles and smiles at him, but the kit’s eyes immediately go to the kat who is perched upon Mr. Allen’s counter. He is out of place, not just because Mr. Allen only has one kat, a tom named Marilyn, but because this kat has pedigree written all over him. He doesn’t belong in a little corner store in Brooklyn.
Yeah the damn virus. He could tell with only a sweeping glance that he was more fit than he’d ever been, the familiar aches and scars earned in a lifetime absent, replaced by a foreboding sort of thrumming in his blood stream, a hum at the back of his mind as his brain tickled and sparked on the verge of… something. Hopefully not an explosion.
"Ah. I know I've said it before, but you do know that - "
Right, after that first run in with Magneto and Emma Frost he’d outfitted all the safe rooms in the tower to be able to resist telepathic attacks. That answered why he couldn’t feel Natasha or feel any of the others besides Bruce but it didn’t tell him what the hell was going on.
But Clint wasn't looking at either of them anymore, his gaze fixed somewhere in the crowd as he tensed, muttering lowly.
, but questionable fashion sense aside at least he had working air conditioning. The guy rolled his window down letting out a blast of cool air.
Now there was a man who had asked to be rearranged, but he still had no idea that he was as dead as the rest of them. Nobody created soldiers for peace. Whatever life Steve Rogers would have had would be buried under the refuse of war and rust. Blood would color his landscape until death finally swallowed him.
Princess thought at him with amusement and Tony smirked. Thinking back, "
There was an old saying that at the kennel club everybody looked the other way. Humans who wanted to take a walk on the wild side could without judgment and Gata weren't asked who they'd come with and nobody cared too much who they left with.
His name was Anthony Stark.
She decided there were worse ways to die, than in the arms of someone you love.
Nothing stressed a bond like being shot by your own mate. Or having one mate try and kill the other he supposed. And now Steve was in a coma and his serum enhanced brain would be leaning on his closest bonds for strength in order to heal; but that wasn’t Tony it was Barnes.
“That doesn’t make them bad Peter.” Tony said, seeming to read his mind again and Peter stared up at him with hope. Did he mean that? Or was he just saying it to make Peter feel better about what had happened to him?
He swallowed the words because they weren't right. He wouldn't do that to Steve (to either of them) when it had taken so much out of Steve to voice these thoughts and say those words.
Those were the tactical reasons for giving him warmth. There were others, and they were all tied to seeing him chained up and at the mercy of that mad man. If those who had trained her could only see her now.
~*~*~*
He wondered if she was still bothering the receptionist out in the waiting room with a million questions. Probably, he thought with a smile.
Killian wasn’t a tom so he wasn’t going to be effected by Tony walking in smelling like heat and an abundance of kits, but Tony wouldn’t feel comfortable (safe) until the scent was wiped away. He hated others knowing he was in heat, hated the way their eyes followed him and the way their bodies responded to his pheromones. Okay not always... sometimes it was nice when Bruce and Clint wanted to cuddle and when they looked at him like he was the best thing since Netflix and a smile from him was what made the sun rise.
"By real do you mean someone qualified or someone human?" Clint asked nonchalantly, tossing what looked like a Hawkeye themed hackey sack between his hands, orange ears twitching. Tony was glad to someone had said it before him, because contrary to popular belief he wasn't all that keen on being president of the 'Give Cap a hard time' club, but you know what they say.
That wasn't fair, he berated himself. Pepper and Rhodey did the best they could with what Tony gave them. They weren't to blame for patterns Tony himself had set. But this was a fresh slate. Luke didn't know yet just how much of a wreck Tony was and hadn't spent decades of his life keeping Tony together when he refused to do it himself.
Her eyes were more sad than fearful, heavy with the knowledge that she was vulnerable (never helpless) and forced to rely on someone else in hope for survival. She felt guilt for leaving him alone in this crisis and a lingering sense of shame for putting herself in that predicament in the first place. But it was all surface, all trained impulses and instincts. What mattered was what was at the core, the truth she couldn’t hide from either of them anymore.
“Does that hurt?” She asked, putting pressure on his wrist, forcing his arm back toward his knee. Even wounded Steve was capable of resisting that pressure but they both knew that wasn’t the point so he allowed it.
Least of all for Steve's poor mother who had the difficult task of trying to educate two young morons about their bodies and the differences in their biology. What Steve in all his twelve-year-old wisdom had gotten from the conversation was, "So you're a girl?!"
"I signed up for this gig Cap. It was way better than the alternative.” The tom revealed, cryptically, and when Steve didn’t prompt him for further explanation he provided it with a knowing smile accompanied by a wistful shrug. “I was rescued from a fight ring in Harlem when I was six years old."
“But things went south during the recession and Daddy had to sell a lot. The one thing he couldn’t sell was his prize kitten and her kit, and after his mother died well I guess Scotty just felt like he couldn’t abandon Daddy. So we stayed. My mother was furious when she found out I was pregnant with Scotty. She accused him of forcing me. But it wasn’t force and I made sure Daddy knew that, but Daddy… I don’t think he would have believed that anyway. He was disappointed, but he never treated Harley poorly… even when all the neighbors talked and called us the worst names. He loved my son.”
“I'd be disappointed if you didn't try.” the tom replied warmly. There was another moment of pause and then suddenly the man's voice had changed, all traces of warmth replaced by unflinching certainty. "My secrets are quite safe, even from you Mr. Stark. This time around you will just have to learn patience."
Bruce warned even as a swift rush of approval from Natasha flooded through the bond followed by a simple thought.
Sweet. Bruce would call it, but never to Tony's face. He said a thousand words a minute but the most important language Tony used wasn't a spoken one. It was in the things he gave. The gifts, the AI's, the robots, the habitats, the safe houses, the armors, the clean energy sources, the bigger brighter safer world. The future.
"So yeah, I'll figure out how to stabilize my little condition but think again about knocking on my door the next time you need me. Because if you're looking for a figurehead who you can prop up while you develop more and more creative ways to exploit us, then you're going to have to find another sucker. But I think we both know that I'm the one you want most." Tony fluttered his eyelashes at Fury who looked at him in a way that suggested he wouldn't mind choking him and Tony laughed once more before continuing toward the door.
She stood over him, numbly terrified in a way she’d not experienced since she was a kit watching the house burn down around her.
"Hey, JARVIS, Buddy, what the hell?" He'd cursed as he'd ripped off the welding mask to glare in the general direction of upward (god he was getting as bad as Cap).
"He's very good. But I shouldn't keep Sir waiting. Will you save me a dance later?"
“I did not think the creature appreciated being likened to a turkey.” Thor was chuckling, at the part in the story when Tony's attempts at diverting the Benu’s attention had nearly gotten him turned into baked beans in a can.
“It’s 2014 down there. Nyota’s not even gonna be born for another three years and the incursion won’t happen for another fifteen years after that. You want us to wait two decades?!”
Steve nodded, accepting the logic even though he still looked concerned.
“Yeah, the President of the United States doesn’t even have clearance to touch my suit, so no. You’ll primarily be working on design theory for medical tech and maybe if you’re savvy enough, some low-grade weaponry for the Avengers team. Stark Resilience as a startup will be a very intimate team of Researches and Developers headed by myself–” Peter’s mouth fell open and Tony hesitated. “I’m a busy man though, so naturally there will be some delegating. You expected that right… you’re not going to cry or something are you?”
“Don’t do anything crazy Clint,” Natasha warned him and a manic grin twisted his lips.
“JARVIS, what’s this?” Tony asked petulantly as Natasha tried to hand him a steaming mug of coffee and a bowl of the stuff. “Where’s my tuna?”
It wasn’t supposed to be this way. Dad was supposed to live a very long time, and Nyota was supposed to figure everything out before the mantle of Queen ever passed down to her but it hadn’t worked out like that. Instead the whole universe had ended, and their parents had put them all on the ARK and told them to take care of each other. Now it was Nyota’s job to take care of her cousins and younger siblings and make sure they always had an anchor, whether she was fit for the job or not, because she was the only Queen. But she was only seventeen and she totally wasn’t ready for this!
“They’re all morons.” Natasha muttered darkly, only Bruce and Tony were party to the waves of protectiveness underlining each word, but it was an unspoken feeling he suspected they all shared.
“He wasn’t.” Princess snapped suddenly, the playful mood disappearing between them at the brittle edge to her tone. Tony felt like a heel.  It was too easy to forget. Even though Princess had a photo ready mask of confidence, she was carrying around a tremendous amount of grief for the family she’d lost. Most especially for her papa. She had a way of breathing around the word,
"Alright so listen up Lamb Chop. I don't know who you're working for, whether it's the KGB or friendlier waters, but frankly it doesn't make much difference to me. I don't like games when I don't know the rules and I don't play any when it comes to either my tech or my people. Right now you need to convince me you're not a threat to either."
“He’s you. Who is it that you think you are?” Tony asks, cocking his head. His tone is patient and expectant, almost parental. The soldier is tempted to shoot him and just be done with it, but it’s more important to figure out why this keeps happening. Whatever Tony wants, the soldier needs to figure it out first and find a way to eject him for good before it jeopardizes the mission.
"So either this works or it doesn't, and in the event that it doesn't I've taken care of certain things. The new shelter on the Island will be built and sustained with company funds, as will the Avengers so long as you all still want to be Avengers."
~*~*~
“Because, though you framed your proposal like the gift of working with your scientists is gold in itself, it hasn’t escaped my notice that it’s you who wants access to technology my team developed first. Technology they’ll continue developing with or without you.”
“Are you alright?”
At Bruce's nod the tight knot of tension coiled in Natasha's chest began to release. It still wasn't ideal but at least one of them would be there with Tony if something went wrong, and perhaps even more pressingly (given the bright flush in Tony's cheeks) it was good he'd have a tom he trusted nearby.
So you’ve trolled the society pages and the magazines for information on Tony and you’ve probably come to the conclusion that he’s from Manhattan, because that’s exactly the illusion he pays his expert public relations team to perpetuate. If you’re particularly savvy (not to mention in need of better hobbies) you may have traced him back to Boston where he went to private school in his formative years, and lingered several years after graduating from MIT in his late teens.
“I didn’t know what that meant but I looked it up on the tablet you gave me, and it means sometimes that his values create contradictions. Like why is it okay to swear at home but not on the comm lines? And why does he still let women and fels walk through a door first when he almost punched that guy outside Planned Parenthood? Well I figured it out!”
"You crafted this?" RaTu asked, blinking slowly as her yellow eyes took in the scratched but otherwise intact plates as Tony lowered his defensive stance.
The machine issued a steady, almost perfunctory beep supposedly in rhythm with Tony’s heart as he lay in the center of the cradle, naked but for his underwear, eyes fluttering sleepily as Helen explained for the cameras recording the event that Tony had been given drugs to dull his senses but due to interference from Extremis they could not safely administer a dose strong enough to keep him fully under.
“I didn’t think there really was a future at all for me until you. You gave me back
“It’s not really my business, but yeah, leaving your kid with an abuser.” Tony sniffed, turning to pin her with a frank stare. “I’d ask if you knew how she was treating him but we already know the answer to that.”
Sure enough there's the unmistakable sound of the mechanical humming of an approaching aircraft and a few scant feet before he was about to become a pancake, a black, winged, creature swooped in like a bird of prey and hooked him around his middle to snatch him up like a fish out of water, one sure hand cradling his neck to prevent this whole thing from ending with a broken neck.
Ivan says that it’s a mistake to fall in love. But (she) was always going to love the one who saved (her) saw (her), the one who needs them more than they’ll ever need him. The soldier gave them life before they ever thought they deserved it, and now that they are damned and know they definitely don’t, they can only treasure the gift of love all the more.
Tony, who was standing g on Thor’s right leaned toward him to whisper.
Thank god they’d gone with the first name. It had been bad enough growing up there as it was, Tony couldn’t imagine how much worse it would have been if the family name was on the goddamn map. Starksville USA. No thank you.
Continuing to ignore it, Tony narrowed his eyes on Steve and pictured him moving one of his pieces into a place that allowed Tony to take two of his pieces in a row. Steve made the move – not thoughtlessly like a puppet on a string, but as naturally as if the thought had been his all along.
But fast and deadly as she was Natasha was also severely outnumbered, so Tony shook off the stupor and began struggling at his bonds anew. He was stronger than the average human but the metal restraints seemed to have been made with gata in mind because they didn't so much as budge.
Nyota couldn’t help a cackle at his nauseous expression and he smirked triumphantly at the sound. Damn it. Trust Barnes to always know how to get under her skin. Sighing she got up from the chair, but paused before she took his offered hand, biting the corner of her lip.
“You said it.” Steve couldn’t help a little smile of his own and at the sight of it Harley relaxed, sitting back in his chair.
Lab time was enough to perk Harley up and get him chattering again as he followed Bruce out (thank fuck) and Tony took that opportunity to exit with Jena who apologized again for the incident as soon as they were in the hall.
Tony felt his ears droop under her stare, but soldiering himself he reached for the damn cup of tea and hoped that his trust in her ability to vet danger wasn’t about to be misplaced.
“This is most unusual friends. The effects of the broth should not have lasted this long.”
“You care about him.” Natasha, who must have taken up mind reading when Steve wasn’t looking filled in. She laughed softly at his glower.
Darren tapped away on his tablet, flicking through the files on the halo-screen. “Okay, in review you want ultra privacy, easy access to the mainland without compromising security, and room to stretch your legs. How much room are we talking?”
“I’ve been peachy keen. Natasha’s woken me up a few times but I haven’t seen so much as a mirage or my own since Asgard,” Clint piggy backed and Tony frowned, a thought occurring to him.
Until next time enjoy.
“It’s as I said Sir. An accident waiting happen.”
He didn’t have breath to suck in, but Tony felt the sight of her hit him like a car at high speeds.
"What does that bastard want J? And give me a better angle."
Blinking his eyes clear Tony glanced at the doctor and her companion and snapped, gesturing toward the medical vans, “I want all the residents and my staff seen to first. When you’re ready I’ll be with Agent Coulson.”
Harley was young but he was far from an idiot. He’d picked up now on the tension in the room, his shoulders hunching defensively as he realized he’d done something wrong. He shifted uncomfortably on his feet, ears flattening as he made himself smaller.
“Bond with me,” Tony heard himself say. He totally hadn’t planned on saying that, but oh well. He meant it with every last fiber in his body. The feeling of
She was already so beautiful to him in all of her raw potential, but one day this woman was going to change the world. He was sure of it and all he wanted was a front row seat.
It was the hurt that Tony could feel tugging at him over their developing bond that made Tony snap. He knew that had happened on Shelly Williams couch that morning wasn’t Steve’s fault. Steve hadn’t really done anything besides come to Tony’s defense and he couldn’t be blamed that the world was so damn backward.  Unfortunately, that realization did nothing to make Tony less angry about it, and guilt on top of everything just tended to make him snappish.
He perked up a bit when he noticed the very tailored looking (aka very tight) red sweater the tom was sporting and the way it lovingly clung to an unexpectedly well-muscled chest.
~*~*~*~
“I must confess I am unfamiliar with your C-Town. But from a young age I learned at my father’s knee the importance of the courting rituals. So, naturally when it became clear that I would be spending a lot of time under the roof of a Queen, I called my sister in a panic and had her ship me some of our best Chelia. They are incredibly delicious but swim in piranha infested waters so our fishermen do not often pursue them.”
~*~*~
“But then you crashed that plane into the artic which was pretty awesome, so you actually got ahead for a little bit, and then like a bajallion years passed and you should have gotten one point for each of those years but you were asleep so you missed them. And, this is the good part Tony look, the first thing he did when he woke up was join the Avengers and fight those aliens.” Harley looked over at Steve but didn’t seem to notice how stiff the atmosphere had gotten or the way the captain’s smile had faded.
“I am making you tea.” T’Challa explained after he’d filled the pot with water and set it on the stove, on top of a high flame. Then he turned and fished out a mug from the cupboard and set it firmly on the counter, reaching in his shirt pocket and fishing out a small cloth bundle. As he unwrapped the shriveled green leaves a familiar smell tickled Tony’s nostrils and he sat up straighter, nose twitching.
The soldier stiffens. Sniffing harshly in the still night like a bloodhound on the search and they pause, terrified of what comes next.
Because he just is. His biological purpose is to build a pride. He was never going to settle for something tame.  He can't settle, and Clint's biological purpose is to make sure he doesn't have to. Clint has to be the strongest, the fasted, the best, the hunter, because he has to protect his pride and his queen. And one smile from Tony is all it takes to make him feel like he's the fucking Terminator here to wreck everyone's shit. It's high as anything.
“Yes I do. It’s Dr. Stark, and they know where to find me if they still have questions.”
She and Pietro are not the first he has personally picked for training. Strucker has always been clear about lines, about who the master is. Ivan is just a shirt he gets to wear when it is convenient for his masters. The soldier is an asset. Nothing more and nothing less, and it is efficient that they work with his nature and not against.
“It is common for our people to experience short comas after severe injury.” He explained as the doors locked shut behind him, compressing the air in the room once more. “It gives our minds a chance to heal and to focus on healing the body.”
"I find that being specific helps prevent any misunderstandings. Why wasn't I informed of Mr. Stone's request Director?" She asked in a no-nonsense tone that demanded an answer.
love him. That was awesome, and it was all that mattered because he was Ironman, Queen of Pride Avengers, a mother fucking Stark and he was not afraid of winter.
“Do I have to wear a tie?” he asked, even though he already knew damn well because Miss Potts had come around to his room with a very short list of things he was allowed to wear and a list so long of subjects he wasn’t allowed to broach while dining with the Prince that he could have made a dress out of it.
"Is this a game to you Tony?! You know how unstable that damned virus is and yet you just put countless lives at risk, especially yours!" Steve pressed closer, lips curling in snarl as he got in Tony's face. "You had no right to challenge my orders!"
“Wonderful. Great talk, Nick. I love it when we can get together like this.”
“An engineer… that’s like a mechanic, right? You fix things?”
Letting go of the past. Giving it all to a brave new world (brave new Queen).
“I doubt anybody could say any of that with a straight face besides you.”
"But don't you have parents mama? What about them?"
She arched a speculative brow at him.
That had to be the tenth time since they’d sat down that T’Challa had sniffed like that, like he’d caught a wiff of someone’s heinous body odor and couldn’t shake it out of his nose. And considering that they were dining in the heated rooftop garden of one of New York’s most expensive hotels and the only ones present at that, Tony had to ask.
Tony hadn’t thought his body could be any more of a disaster, but extremis had proved him wrong. Sure, the regenerative virus had ‘fixed’ some areas. His organs were in prime condition (his ticker hadn’t been this whole or this healthy since he was fourteen years old). Basically, all the wear and tear he’d put on the old machine had been fixed by an ace mechanic and given a fresh coat of paint to boot; but out of the frying pan and into the fire and all that, because he’d traded a bum heart and a shitty auto-immune system, riding a hormone imbalance and several deficiencies, for a nano-virus that was determined to evolve every last inch of him or destroy what parts of him would not comply.
Tony hesitates and Ana nudges him forward.
“Bucky.” He confirmed, heart twisting in his chest at the admission.
“Is he homo because he’s human or is he homo because he -”
That's all "gentling therapy" was code for. The asinine belief that socializing fels with toms and breeding them a few times was all it took to make an unhappy kitten all smiles.
“It’s a good way not to die too.” The fel shrugged and flicked her tail, turning to leave again as she tossed back over her shoulder. “Get off your head out of your ass Steve before you hurt yourself.”
Okay don't answer that and maybe he needs to go back.
There were a pair of guards on the roof but they were either amateurs or too comfortable in the silence of the woods because they stayed facing one direction for long stretches of time as they chatted with one another, only bothering to do a routine sweep whenever it seemed to occur to them.
She was more worried about the signal coming from the roof top that was jamming most of her tech and preventing her from keeping tabs on her teammates, which probably meant she was the one lucky enough to have found the golden egg, but she'd have to go in alone and blind to get any evidence.
"Our apologies Master Stark." He grumbles looking none too happy.
Tony felt so right there in his arms. Soft and sweet smelling with his heart beating against Steve’s chest. He couldn’t help the sudden stab of desperate fear that went through him at the thought of losing him, losing
“Wakanda follows a system passed down from the first Alurio. When a queen-fel is old enough, they are given to the Queen for training in the ranks of the Dora Milaje, the beloved ones. All of the other beloved ones are toms. They are the best and brightest selected from among the many tribes that make up Wakanda. They become ambassadors for their tribes as well as the royal family’s fiercest and most dedicated warriors,” T’Challa began to explain.
Ross pushes and pushes and nothing impresses. Not even when they become Dr. Banner. They get a split lip and a whispered threat that all the strings Ross had to pull to keep their head off the chopping block had better be worth it.
“That would not have been an easy call to make were this exercise real.” He continued thoughtfully after a moment. Tony tensed at the return of a subject he’d hoped everyone would just forget, Steve’s face flickering across his mind. He felt a pang of guilt remembering how he’d sent Natasha to her not-literal death.
Hughard creates the forge, he lets the fires roar unchecked and applies a dangerous amount of pressure until something lessor would have cracked and splintered.
“Ouch.” Tony hissed glaring down at her.
But Tony was above that, it wasn't the toms biological perfume that got him. It was that other part. The part where he believed Tony had good sense to begin with, that he had some sort of head on his shoulders that wasn't stuck in some juvenile stasis that needed constant adult supervision.
Tony jerked as something knocked against his elbow and an amused feminine voice said, “I’ve been sent to tell you that Clint’s back from the island.”
"Well when they do Ms. Romanov I'm sure you'll be the first to know." Fury sneered and then he rolled his eyes to Pepper and said dryly, "I'm only telling you this much because I've been reminded that I'm contractually obligated. Now all of you, get the hell out of my office."
"Indeed." Thor agreed with the same beaming grin, and Tony narrowed his eyes at him because there was something suspiciously cheeky about it. Whatever. There would be time enough later to educate Thor on classic board games. Right now he had more than enough on his plate to handle.
But Steve doesn’t really need to be told.
Tony perhaps hadn't realized it yet, but since Extremis sometimes his eyes glowed like bright honey when he used a lot of energy. So even though he didn't say a word Thor knew what was coming and he watched with pleasure as the latest version of Tony's armor unfolded from the bracelets on his wrists and ankles, smooth as silk as the almost impossibly thin plates moved fluidly over his under armor and hardened into place with soft mechanical clicks.
“I’ve got eyes, Cap. Hostage is on the third floor outside the Brooks Brothers. Our other targets are still in the bookstore on the – Shit!” Steve heard the spattering of more gunfire as Tony swore vehemently in his ear. “D.C.’s finest have the girl and one of the kids pinned behind an overturned vendor cart. They’ve opened fire on a civilian hostage for fucks sake!”
He liked the soft fur on his ears and tail especially but Bruce didn't like to dwell on the particulars too much. He was just glad for it.
Not entirely. Steve didn't always help himself where Tony was concerned, and frankly Steve was homesick in a uniquely devastating fashion that Tony couldn't be responsible for.
But as everyone knows by know Howard's old friend Obi turned out to be a back stabbing traitor. Old Howard must have gotten wise to something smelling rotten in the state of Denmark because he'd changed his will the week before his death.
“You are Mr. Parker, aren’t you?”
They all put up with it though. Fels in pre-heat tended to get downright pissy with you for not getting with the program and doing things their way. And truthfully, Bruce didn't know if there was a tom alive who wasn't enthralled with heat scent and would complain about a fel who had plans for them. Mood swings or no.
"Lets go." Tony suggested, though Natasha had already turned to run. As Tony ran behind her, covering their back by emptying a couple more rounds into Killian's staggering body, only relaxing when he saw that Catman was back on his feet and leaping on the lunatics back.
Tony always let JARVIS harass him into bed early the night before and resisted the urge to drink his weight in alcohol (that was saved for later) because he knew that if he gave in to the desire to just lock himself in his lab all night and crack open the bar, that he'd be in no shape to do what he'd done every December the 24th since he was twenty-eight years old.
Those early associations with words like ‘responsibility’ and ‘legacy’ and 'father' are surprisingly sweet. A sweet turned sour with age, sure, but sweet none the less in all their naivete.
“I’ve got this. Go.” The kat with the shield shouted, his voice similarly disguised, and the female immediately took flight, boot repulsors nearly soundless (and really damn sexy if Tony were being honest) as she blasted a hole in the floor above and disappearing upward. Her companion kept Tony busy by pulling back his arm and

“It’s strong enough to hold one, but is it strong enough to hold all six of them? At once?” Bruce asks, his tone verging on desperation – of fear or of hope, Tony can’t say. There’s too much in his words and his eyes for him to safely tell the difference. Maybe it’s both.

Tony sees Bruce’s head jerk to the side, as if startled, but he doesn’t say anything. Tony waits, but he never raises his gaze, lost somewhere in the distance in deep, troubled thought.
Though he should count his blessings, he supposes.

Tony lets out a shuddering sigh, running his hand over his mouth and chin in an effort to keep himself silent, the pressure on his lips as a reminder to keep them closed. He feels a hand touch his shoulder, a brief, fleeting comfort, awkward and uncertain, but
“Tony has a tendency to hide things when he doesn’t want to talk about them.”
“Wanda’s powers came from the Mind Stone.” Tony remembers, from his conversation with Bruce in the med bay. “You thought of using the Stone’s power against itself.”
He wants to be rude and insult them in some way, but he can’t bring himself to do it. What would be the point? There is no point anymore. And it’s not like it isn’t true. The suit is right there – broken, distorted, scraps of metal and junk spread across the soil, the dirt and debris, and trapped around him like the universe’s most cruel of cages.

And then Steve helped Bucky beat up the German Task Force, and injured several civilians when then they destroyed a bridge. Bucky hadn’t tried to escape the cell and he seemed to be somewhat calm – but a few seconds with Zemo in the same room as him and he suddenly had been transformed back into the Winter Soldier, and he hurt and incapacitated several officers on his attempt to escape, including Natasha and Tony themselves.
“All these years…” Sam whispers, appalled. “All these years we’ve been looking for Barnes, you

“Why sign it, then?” he asks, because he has to. He has to know. He’s not even sad or irritated, he’s curious, because he knows Natasha always has more reasons and more arguments and more opinions than any of them can ever dream of guessing. There is always something hidden, in her. He wondered, during all of it, during all the fight, if she saw something he didn’t. Something that could’ve prevented this. “You could’ve helped us stop it. Tony would’ve listened to you.”
It occurs to him, when he thinks about it, that Natasha has never seen the two of them together. Not properly. She has seen Steve fight him, she watched Steve be arrested for him, Steve leaving for him, Steve and Bucky running away when she helped them by stopping T’Challa. But in the end, that was all she saw: snippets and pieces of a bond only shown in the light of violence, often when Bucky is running from something, as Steve is running with him.
But that has never stopped Steve from hoping.
Of course.

Nebula. Still could. How ironic is that, him being trapped with a being that is half-made of metal, when Tony, even today, when he tries to take his time and step away from his work-binges more often and care more about real people, about Pepper, about the kid…
It’s hard to remember that Bruce never actually had the chance to know the Compound. That it really has been

His palms start to sweat, his throat turning suddenly desert-dry again, airways closing in a sudden snap of fear, and he has to close his eyes and force his body not to lock up before he descends into panic again, every single breath a struggle so tiring he feels like he’s much, much older than he truly is.
“Where are you?” Tony repeats, insistent. “I’m getting you out.”
(He never does.)

Steve… Steve stays quiet. Logically, he knows it’s for the best. Having Vision here is already a risk much higher than they should be willing to take, but they will, all because of Wanda. Although the information Vision promised to give them could de useful, they could do without it. But for Wanda’s sake, Steve will allow it, because he is not heartless enough to stop these two people that so
At that time, Tony would have denied her nothing. Tony… Tony was so in love, so hopeless and desperate to keep her, so utterly entranced with this woman that we would have done anything she had asked without so much of a second thought.
And then, all that’s left is Tony, Bruce, Thor, and Rhodey. And a board filled to the brim.

T’Challa gives him a mockingly solemn nod, in good humor. “Not all battles are won by charging ahead, Captain. Sometimes, knowing when to wait is as valuable as knowing when to strike.”
“Steve.” Tony starts. “I-”
He can’t.
Tony averts his gaze, concerned, but unable to calculate just how much damage that means for DC – he tries to put numbers together, but his thoughts halt mid-way through like a train slipping off its tracks, a barrel of information that loses itself when it enters the deep fog of his psyche, a destination he cannot reach through the thick haze of what stands in his way.
(Get up.)
at the same time Nebula does, but while Nebula sounds deeply confused, Tony’s chest seizes with painful emotion, an almost childish hope, something that drags a soft gasp from his lips and makes his eyes widen to the point where they hurt.
Pepper Potts, the final part. And all the hard-to-say words that follow. We need to close this door so the next one can open - and I don't mean to Steve; but to a discussion we desperately need to have, about what is truly pushing Tony forward at this point, and the issues I feel like many of us, Tony stans, have some problems talking about. I will not shy away from them, and neither should you. We're cracking the eggs to make the omelet. I told you once that Pepper means something to the story, that she represents a very important part of the very essence of the Tony Stark character in the MCU: Priorities, and Purpose. Remember that? Well, that's not the whole story. There's also one more thing that she represents, something very important that you've heard a lot about:
“We need more people.” Tony says, mostly to himself, and rubs his hands over his eyes, aching with strain and dry as a desert. “We can’t do it all by ourselves.”
“Okay.” He exhales confusedly.
” Bucky asks loudly, but then the words finally catch up to him and he blinks owlishly. “Wait. That doesn’t make sense. Cuba?”
here and do nothing?! He can’t allow it, not when he can stop it, he knows that!
“Have you—” Steve starts, but the words get caught awkwardly in his throat. A pause, filled with uncertainty. “Seen Tony?”
“I guess that makes me sound like a complete asshole, doesn’t it?” Steve ruefully laughs, averting his gaze to the floor. “I don’t know how I feel about this, T’Challa.”
“I don’t want to be an a-hole for nothing, but she’s got a point.” Rocket, Tony’s having a little difficulty getting used to that, says. “Your ship is a little… outdated.”
, alright? Barton is
T’Challa watches him for a moment, perhaps waiting for Steve to say something else, but he never does. He doesn’t know what else to say. He’d like to offer help in revising the Accords, but he can’t, and he’d like to ask T’Challa more about Tony, but he won’t. Steve has done what he could. He has positioned himself against the Accords, and now he has to wait to see how they develop; and he has given Tony a way to reach him, and he has to wait for him to make the phone call. The ball is no longer in his court.
To laugh, laugh nervously and broken, laugh until the high pitched hiccups of joy are loud enough that he can disguise the wet, choked up feeling in his nose and throat as the lack of air, to disguise the tears that spring in his eyes as a joke, as a folly, as something that doesn’t hurt – but it does. It hurts so –
That’s… true.
It sounds like something she’d say.

between her and Vision, about so many other things he can’t even count them all. She is no child, he knows, he understands, but he can’t help but feel anxious, and he wants to make sure she is okay. There is nothing wrong with that, he tells himself. All he is asking for is a couple of seconds alone with her, just so she won’t feel embarrassed by talking about this in front of Vision, and all of Steve’s doubt would be put at rest.

(You will fix it.)
Pepper, of course, recognizes Tony’s word for what they really are, a request for some private time with Bruce, but she still hesitates a little, her brows furrowed slightly. “You need to eat something too.”
He can’t. If he doesn’t, if he’s not paying attention; If anyone, anywhere, decides to revive this dispute just for the sake of trying to gain power over them, nevermind the entire apocalypse that’s happening out there… They can’t have that. They can’t have anyone, not even the likes of General Ross, messing with the already far too delicate peace they have silently agreed to keep in order to find a solution to this. It’s no more than a thin veil of appeasement, an excuse of forgiveness, and Tony can’t have anyone disturbing that on top of everything else, or else he won’t be able to take it.
“We should always help as we can.” He says in a whisper. “Because we don’t know when we’ll be able to come back.”
He understands.
She then proceeds to give a quick explanation about who Scott is and what has been the general opinion of the judgment panel over his case, which Steve would’ve liked to hear more about it, but the woman is tripping over her words and speaking in a rush, because a man – who Steve doesn’t recognize, but it is not Ross, because he stands behind the one who comes forward to the crowd and faces the first wave of cameras and microphones that are shoved into his face –, after a brief pause, announces, his voice hoarse and tired, but deep and imposing, bringing down the gavel that will seal Scott’s fate from now on.
“Yeah.” Bruce agrees, in all seriousness. “I’m assuming one of you convinced her to stay?”
But the
No one says anything, and Tony looks around, almost daring them to speak. He almost gets to feel smug satisfaction at the apparent lack of objection – but then, he notices how stiff Natasha is sitting. Slowly, the others notice his staring, and they all move to face her.
Pepper looks back at him with horror, mouth gaping in shock, and Tony asks her wryly, wishing he could
, but they don’t. Not really. Rhodey and Natasha seem incredibly torn on what to do, struggling between the instinct to force them into some sort of compliance or step back in other not to spook them, as do Ross and Carter; Clint and Thor can only seem to stare with grievous, solemn eyes, no answer forthcoming from them.
He can’t take the waiting, the hesitation, he has to know or else he will never find the strength again. It doesn’t matter. He will never be ready, it’ll never be the right time, he has to hear it
, but the urge is stronger than him. Something about the way the others circle them like they’re a spectacle in a circus, it puts Tony incredibly on edge.
“If you could hurry a little, it would help.” Barton urges, and steps back to give them a clear path, into what looks like the interior of the Sanctum from what Tony can recall, in its mostly wooden and dark construction, with the smell of old books and incense, and a strange hint of cinnamon. To the side, Tony can actually see Natasha, looking paler than he remembered, the shade only accentuated by the light tone of her bleached hair. Rogers, Tony realizes,
But there it is! There it is, folks! Pepper is here, and Rhodey is on his way - and not alone ;) We're about to open the world's biggest can of worms! Don't let this Pepperony reunion fool you, that SteveTony tag is firmly in place and it'll stay there - and I wonder if any of you have any idea how I'm gonna make that work, seeing I'm keeping Pepper alive and Tony still very much caring for her.

“I once encountered one of the other Stones.” Thor says. “The Reality Stone, also known as the Aether. Jane found it, in a gap between worlds, where it was hidden. It was strange, it was… It was not solid.”
Rogers gives a quick head signal, almost a nod, as if to prompt Tony to speak – and Tony remembers; A silent inquiry about his abrupt call before the takeoff.
“I’m more concerned to what’s gonna happen to it after we add the Stones. If we get them.” Bruce crosses his arms, in a posture that’s half defensive, but half thoughtful. “They emit gamma radiation, that we know. Even if the metal is stable, exposure to the radiation from the Stones could imbalance it. Maybe that’s why the Gauntlet was destroyed in the first place.”

“Why?” Sam speaks suddenly, almost startling him, unconsciously pulling Steve’s gaze back up to face Sam directly.
“She knows me too well.”, he says, faking smugness, and he hopes his eyes, gleaming with unshed tears, or the soft choke on his voice don’t give away all the softness inside that is beating vulnerable and tender on his chest.

Under her gaze, Steve can’t help but wonder, in a tiny place at the back of his head, the dark corner that keeps growing and growing every day, threatening to swallow him whole, what exactly has happened to Wanda during the time they’ve been apart. Why Steve looks at her and he can’t see that
Steve has lived through the World War II. He knows what happens when the government tries to register and classify people by a characteristic or a number. He’s seen it first hand, how the bad intentions of a leader can destroy the world, how people can so easily be led to their own demise by a pretty speech and a bunch of lies. It’s an excuse as old as time, to disguise prejudice and bigotry under the pretense of protection, exposing people to danger for simply being who they are. For doing what they think it’s right. He can’t allow that to happen. Not again, not anymore.
“You don’t have to thank me.” Tony tells him.

He can say there was a threat, and he decided to help. If asked, he can deny knowing more details. If asked if he knew about Bucky, he can say he did not; and it would not be a lie. That’s the worst part of it all.

He’ll only realize this later; Much, much later, because when it happens, he’s too out of it to notice. He’s still in Pepper’s arms, as if no more than mere seconds have passed, but suddenly, a voice comes from above, urgent and loud, and it snaps Tony’s eyes wide open like waking him brutally from a deep slumber, and he jolts so bad his ass completely leaves the cushion, and in consequence, he nearly knocks Pepper over in his haste.
Rocket makes a snappy sound, like he’s offended. “What are we, Sakaaran trash? We’re here, we’re going to help you!”
“It won’t take long.” Nebula assures, also blatantly ignoring his deflection, all business and no-nonsense as she types in instructions on the command board, fast as lightning, giving him an odd feeling of déjà vu, of

There are moments when a direct attack is shot in Tony’s direction, and sitting here, where the threat has long since passed, is still not enough to stave off the kick of fear and adrenaline Tony feels in his blood when a huge purple beam comes straight to his face in a lighting strike, and Tony only has a second to recall he’s not actually in danger before the camera is obscured by the armor’s shield, instinct acting before the mind can even think about it.

in him felt like when he watched her fall and thought she’d died. He knows that’s what she felt like when Tony flew the nuke through the wormhole. Or like when Vanko came to him in Monaco, or Ultron, or Thanos. That’s what she always feels.
“So our timeline starts in ’42.” Tony repeats, for his own comforting’s sake. “During the war, it got lost in the water, my dad found it, and brought it back to the SSR.”
, even if the silence now feels even more dreadful than it ever did before. Tony can count the beats of his heart while he waits, the strong, pounding rhythm inside him, the bead of sweat that’s tricking down his spine, from the stress, from the rush, and he feels more and more sick with each passing moment.
This is not fair to her.
“I’m not big on suffering in general.” Tony replies. “And I already dedicate myself to a form of art.”
Barton doesn’t say a word. He just fumes and breathes, locked in Natasha’s and Rogers’ restraints, grunts and moans escaping his throat as if he’s trying with all his might to blast through their hold and reach Tony, even though his struggle in their arms is much less violent than it should be, much less vicious than his eyes and the force in his locked jaw and gritted teeth.
"Just because Stark is no longer in the business doesn't mean we stopped needing weaponry.  We need to get them from somewhere and I'm not happy with Hammer's technology."
“What aren’t you telling me?” Tony asked, proving once again that no matter what his weaknesses he would never be someone to underestimate.  “What do you know?”
You don't do that, thinking you're not going to become intimate with death. But Tony tried to. With his heart open and soft, thinking he can usher in brave new worlds without losing anyone. He seems to think that's his responsibility, to make sure nobody suffers the cost unless it's him. Worse. Everybody tells him it is.
Tony knocked on the proverbial door between their minds, careful to keep a distance because the rules of the metaphysical plane could get hairy at times. Now was really not the time to slip and lose focus.

“Why would you throw your shield?” Fandral asked with a shocked scoff. “While they are not so big as dragons, they still have powerful magic and are capable of breathing fire. You would be a fool to throw away your shield.”

Ivan, who had taught her that she was more than an animal (who gave her books and who told her that she would never find a monster as terrifying as the one within her in the pages of one).
Steve’s voice cracked and he bit his lip, stifling a shuddering sob and Tony grabbed him (because fuck if he could just stand there after that) pulling him close. For a moment Steve froze, but then with a quiet moan he buried his face against Tony’s neck, where his scent was thickest, and dragged in a deep desperate breath.
Feeling Tony’s stare he muttered quietly, “Been waiting for this part” and nodded towards the open doors of the jet.
“Peace friends. MiKall, is sometimes exuberant but she means no harm.” Thor assured them, placing a staying hand on Clint’s arm. The wary tom slowly lowered his bow but Tony noticed that he kept the arrow notched.
“Tony…” Steve’s voice sounded like sandpaper and Tony swallowed but refused to back down now. No running away for either of them. Who gave a fuck what anyone else thought? He and Steve were their own people and if they wanted this- if Steve wanted
Howard’s notarized recognition that yes he had impregnated Tony’s mother, and by golly that might just make Tony his child, didn’t grant Tony the full rights of a human being but it made Tony Howard’s son in the eyes of the law; which meant that technically Howard could leave him control of the company.
Thankfully for the security of his tower and the world, this isn't ancient Egypt. Whatever Nick Fury thinks, under no circumstances was Tony going to be responsible for the ramifications when this little social experiment went tits up.
Observing the stunned expressions of Thor's teammates RaTu cocked her head at Tony, eyes narrowing. "Have you not successfully learned the art of bludweild? Thor led me to believe that you are a Queen, though you still smell as a child to me."
Phil’s phone had beeped rather urgently, instantly pulling Clint from sleep. He hadn’t moved in the dark, knew better than to give away his wakefulness, but his hand had slid toward the slit between the headboard and the wall where his bow rested on the specialized hooks that Tony had installed. Easy reach. Being able to be armed within seconds of waking was one of two reasons for him being able to sleep in a proper bed for once.
“Clint!” Barney screams his name, drops the bag he carries and reaches desperately for him, but there was no helping it as more and more tiles came loose and he went sliding off the roof edge.
"I think I got it Tony."
"Yeah, I noticed." Tony cut him off, engaging thrusters once more and wincing as they sparked and sputtered ominously.
Therein lay the trouble.
Just like that
“I take it he’s not around anymore.” Tony inquired gently.
Something pinged on the dashboard and Clint glanced down, frowning at the small blip that had appeared on their radar system, only to watch it disappear again.
“How long before we can get Tony out of here, and how long do you think before it really hits?”
Natasha was scared of it but she wouldn’t say so. She'd sat there staring at the file, only speaking to say it was up to him.
Steve's answering smile was just this touch surprised and a lot radiant, like Tony had just done something particularly brilliant, and his heart squeezed dangerously in his chest.
Natasha clung to the metal support beam, claws scratching lightly against the cold metal as she watched the scene unfolding below. Sound bounced off the walls in the largely open space of the warehouse so she didn't have to strain her ears to pick up the thread of conversation.
He's going to make a good Queen Tony because it takes a mind like that, a will like that, to push a society into greatness and yank it back from the jaws of destruction. A mind that plays the game ten steps ahead, and understands that to win you have to sacrifice. A constitution that can make those sacrifices and keep going (always).
“Now we lay low.” Once decided his mind turned to figuring out the best areas to hide from their handlers and the quickest way to procure supplies. Everything they have belongs to the New Order – to Hydra. They could start with stripping the van, taking anything that didn’t have a tracker in it.
"I went easy on you." Natasha said, popping a strawberry into her mouth.
"Thank god for that.” Pepper muttered into his ear. “Go easy on her, Tony. Your personality is a lot to get used to for anyone, let alone a domesticated kat.”
A sharp whistle blows and a moment later a pair of police officers appear, grabbing the two young men roughly and yanking them to their feet in order to break up the commotion.
In which the Avengers answer a distress call to Washington and everything is not at all what it appears to be on the surface. But this is Tony's life we're talking about so what else is new.
The probability of being awoken for Avenger related calls between the hours of midnight and six am held between 11- 28%.
Tony doubted the Winter Soldier was in any state to make such promises or that Tony could bring himself to believe them even if he could.
It went like that. The voices growing louder in his head, closer, and with each new addition his body growing stronger, that light brightening to pierce through the fog.
As if Tony didn’t already know that.
Whoever’s head this was, it wasn’t Stark.
“Some were nurses and maids, but most of them were kats that the Germans had kept. Just there because their masters were there or because the soldiers needed entertainment. They were sent out to shield the Germans while they shot at us.
Steve considered what she'd said, wondering if it was really true that he might never really know all there was to know about Tony, that Tony would always be doing something to sabotage the trust they'd built because Tony would always be trying to throw himself away.
To all my fellow Americans, HAPPY THANKSGIVING! As I've said on my tumblr : I'm thankful for so many loving people in my life and that we can be together today in peace and comfort. I'm humbled by the knowledge that not everyone shares that blessing, and that today means something very different for many Native Americans who are dedicated to preserving their cultures and their people. I'm thankful that we can be so different and yet all the same in gods eyes. I am thankful for the love and compassion given me, and for the opportunity to return it. I am thankful for forgiveness, the sharing of hope, and the chance to walk together.
“Don’t worry about me. When am I not a professional.”
Tony could feel his connection with both Bruce and Natacha pulling tight now, and more alarmingly he could feel Clint and Cap too, as if they were somewhere close by instead of in an entirely different building.
Steve rebounded and Tony laughed, leaning up to plant a kiss against his cheek with a soft purr and transfer the gurgling infant into his arms.
The history between Stark and Rogers was thick and stickier than mud pie, and there were razor blades baked in just for cheek.
"I call it the Expulse Tracker," Tony explained, something in his voice tight despite his outwardly relaxed posture. "It should work even if they've got a signal jammer. It's like a sleeper cell, see, it adapts to the jamming signal and manipulates it, dropping a series of notes on an alternate frequency. JARVIS can detect the alterations and use them to pin your location."
No time.
The next day when Mama and Jarvis turn their backs for just a moment Tony slips out of sight once more, but this time he’s easily found by the surprised cry he lets loose and the utterly childish way he sobs his heart out outside the locked door of the workshop.
“We’re oh so happy to have you here. I’m sure you’re feeling ripe after such a long flight. So what do you say we get this wagon train on the move?”  Tony put a guiding hand against the tom’s muscled back, keeping up with appearances and providing the press with plenty of great photos as he led the tom down the carpet.
“I already told you Romanov I won’t be on my own.”
She’d give a lot to see him again, even if it was just to hear him rant about gender roles and the feminization of male fels.
That confrontation would come someday, he was sure of it, but it was not today. Today Ivan and the twins had a mission and it was imperative they not fail it. Lucky for all involved, that this particular mission wasn’t all that high stakes. They were set to kidnap an unguarded woman from a public mall. She wasn’t anybody special and wasn’t in any known danger so she’d never see it coming.
From the dance floor it would be easy enough to slip out into the hall and then out to the car, but maybe they didn’t even have time for the dance. Tony was uncharacteristically quiet and stiff as Steve pulled him close. He saw again that devastated look Tony had given him when he’d first approached.
“Rhodes!?” Tony screams as soon as he steps a foot into the door, using all the power of his lungs; His voice echoes against walls, vibrating into empty corridors, his own desperation resounding back to his ears in distressed waves and panic. “
“Many heroes are heroes with much less.” Vision says cryptically. “Mr. Lang may come across as a… peculiar figure, but he is a man with his own set of skills and capabilities. If a man such as him decides to create his own suit, we have no reason to stop him. If he manages to gain the favor of Pym Technologies back and doing so, obtain another suit, we have no reason to stop him. The only way we will stop him is if Mr. Lang somehow trespasses a law, or a
We all are.”
Actually, that one he may not have neglected it.
(At least this won’t be the thing that kills him.)
Easier to push it all away.
That’s not news. Apparently, the tank top, sweatpants, barefoot look is a common occurrence, because Tony either sleeps too much or not at all, and eventually, he starts to lose the notion of whatever the hell he’s wearing and he just walks around looking like a sleepy mess all day.
“That means you’re hiding something.” Sam accuses, and he can see the way Steve’s shoulders flinch at the words. He raises his hands in a gesture of surrender, but his posture shows no submission. “Look, I wouldn’t pry, ok? Not usually. But I walk in here and find you with your hands bleeding from punching the dummy. I didn’t even know you could do that. I thought that freaking thing was just a hologram. How the hell did you manage to hurt yourself like that?”
– but from this angle, he cannot see, not the
idea that was just presented to him on a silver platter.

“And where would that person be taken to, while the panel decides?” Bruce asks, and it’s
There is no time for nothing else.
But he can’t. So this is the next best thing. It’s dangerous, but it is what it is.
“Knowing T’Challa and his family, and they sort of stuff they create in their labs, I assume the princess must have a very neat record of all of these little things.” Tony wiggles his fingers, impatiently, and with a sigh, Barton, of all people, reaches into his pocket and fishes his comm to hand it over. “And surely a way to keep tabs of them, to know who has them. One of the ways to do that is to listen in to the conversations that happen on comms.”
“We’ll go looking for the sanctum. If we find anyone who can help, we’ll bring them back here with us.”
Maybe that’s just his mind being nitpicky. Trying to find reasons to make itself believe he is, in fact, just
Tony’s mouth twists in deep displeasure, and he says nothing.
It was odd, but Tony respects the guy’s privacy. Everyone needs their alone time, and Tony suspects Steve might need his more than most – the future, the

“Down there, are you kidding?” The raccoon exclaims.
“Alright. Ok. Thanks, Ca— Steve. Thanks. And tell your friend we’re glad he’s fine.” Scott tries to inject a bit more excitement to his voice, but it’s too late now. Steve’s not feeling anything but dread at this point. He can’t even pretend he isn’t. “So, I guess that’s all. Thanks for keeping me updated. If you need anything, just call me and I’ll come, I have the phone with me at all times.”
“I don’t need it.” Rogers says, with a very sharp edge of annoyance, not seeming to care much about the loss of his once most prized weapon. “Our mission is to stop the riot and clear the area, not attack the civilians and make things worse. We just have to scare them off.”
(She’s not even gone yet and he already misses her.)
“I don’t think he’s staying with us.” Clint answers. “He mentioned Tony would be back at the Compound by Monday, so he probably should be gone before that.”
He simply has no idea how much.

for something he considered family.
“Tony, you can’t take Pepper to a fight. She’s a civilian.”
The ship is apparently named Benatar. Tony finds that out when he manages to get inside the navigation system — which is weird and functions in a type of algorithm he has never seen before, something that seems to include a ternary logic instead of a binary one — and the main screen greets him with a bunch of information his overworked brain barely has enough strength to decipher. As far as functionality goes, Tony has

“It’s ok.” Bucky assures after a tense pause. “It’s over.”
“He said that?” Tony reels back, shocked. “Why would he need a team?”
He just… stops. He doesn’t know what a more appropriate response would be.

He climbs the small steps toward the center of the landing pad quickly, gritting his teeth through all the insufferable aches of his legs muscles, the heaving of his breath

Wanda gives him a pleased, sheepish smirk, tilting her head to the side contentedly. “It could work.”
Clint goes, and so does Vision.
Tony blinks, confused.
Bruce sighs.
Time was always getting the best of him. First, he lost it, and was thrown into a world where everything happened so fast he couldn’t keep up, couldn’t rest, couldn’t trust. Seventy years passed him by and he didn’t even know, leaving and being left, and there was no way of getting anything back. That’s the worst part. That no matter what he does, how hard he tries, how many rules he breaks, the clock just doesn’t turn back. This is it. He lost those years. That’s all there is to it.
Thor hands Wong his weirdly shaped ring back, and Wong gratefully smiles at him, small and contained, his eyes crinkling just the tiniest bit with amusement, and extends his hand to the stairs, to encourage them to walk out first, and they follow easily, even as Natasha and Bruce exchange books between them as they walk, Bruce’s eyes attentive and curious on the text, even if he can’t read it as it is.
Guilt is strange.
It's a very slippery slope, that one. The secrets we tell, the secrets we keep. The secrets we know, and the secrets they don't. If Steve wants transparency, then I will give it to him; and he will have to pay the price for it, but unfortunately for him, that price is much higher than he would expect. But now we're laying all cards on the table. That is the sacrifice that must be made in name of regaining trust. Half of the job is learning the truth - the other half, learning how to live with it.

There is no use trying to subdue Bucky’s guilt by force.

it was, to the Germans. What he has done. They were on the run already, he knows, they had no luxury of picking and choosing the circumstances of their escape – and Germany had been the closest country with the aircraft they needed to get to Siberia on time.
“It’ll be an honor to have you in the battle with us.” Thor gently adds, the kindhearted and supportive tone of his voice only hitting deeper after his long silence, a touch of softness that they all so rarely remember Thor is capable of, for all his strength and size.
Finding himself at loss, Tony asks, prompting him to continue, “What are you thinking?”
“No.” Tony says out loud, without even meaning to, pacing around like a madman. “No, no. No. This can’t happen.”

“She has been gone since after the battle, Bruce.” Natasha says, softly. “There’s nothing we can do. We have to wait for her to come back.”
And it was useful for other people too – after the disastrous incident with the giant bunny, Tony created protocols for Pepper. 1-R is just one of many, and ironically, the only one Tony hoped to never, ever need to use. And all the things he planned for the wedding – maybe he’ll have to… delete those. Or maybe set them aside for a while. Maybe. He doesn’t really know. He doesn’t know how to stop hoping, honestly.
Tony runs his fingers through Steve’s hair, soft and golden, a lot more tenderly than he should, for what their relationship actually is.
“How long?” Tony whispers, a little shakily. “How long have I been here?”
Angry, yes. Hateful, even, yes. Steve had dealt with Tony’s hate before. Steve had felt Tony’s
"Thank you, Steve." Wanda exhales, and her voice is overflowing with gratitude. "I was worried. Worried he wouldn't want to see me ever again. And now he's here, and I don't... I don't want to run away again."

So he asks Winter Soldier Bucky. Maybe this will provide some other ideas Steve could try to get back to Tony’s side.
“You know what?” Natasha glances away, trying to shut herself out of his sight, giving a barely audible sniff before giving him a smile that is pure plastic and no emotion. “Now it’s not a good time, Steve. Come back when you actually feel like talking and not just growling at my face.”
Tony frowns. “Why haven’t they come out?”
Tony is a little anxious to watch her go, but he can’t think too much about it. So, he turns, and he says:
Many of the others standing behind Barton flinch, seemingly poised to intervene, but reluctant to do so. They step to the sides, spreading themselves wider so they can watch the exchange from a better angle – so they can
But Tony is, in his heart, a multitasker. He has to be. His mind fires in too many directions a once, and for now, this might actually be a good thing; Because he won’t have the luxury to have some downtime later to think about the other elephant in the room calmly. The issue will not go away if he stops looking at it, as it usually and frustratingly does. In fact, the longer he ignores it, the more dangerous it will become. So he needs to do

Natasha sighs, shrugs, and sipping her tea loudly, and says:
Steve doesn’t want her comfort.
It doesn’t matter if they won’t see him. It doesn’t matter.
“I can’t take this.” Steve blurts out, unthinking, and he immediately backtracks. “I’m sorry, Your Highness, this is very beautiful, but it’s too much. I can’t take it. You’ve done more than enough for us.”
Steve can’t really argue with her on that matter. That, at least, he knows to be true.
It’s so hard to breathe.
“Anything good?”
But Maria never moves forward with him. The air is still heavy inside the mansion, carrying pain and loss to every nook and cranny, black smoke choking up lungs, stinging at the back of eyes, consuming everything like a living being. He hates it.
, and he can’t take it back. Once again, the fragile bonds that kept him grounded snapped, this time by his own hand, and all he has left are these burned ropes and burning bridges, and nothing else.
That’s Natasha Romanov.
“I’m out, I’m safe.” Natasha says, and Tony is so geared up he can’t even be properly relieved to hear her voice. “But we have to put out the fire, quick.”
“Isn’t that what we’re supposed to to?!”
That’s how Steve feels when the people-watches. He wonders if Thor, who is beyond their comprehension of time, who has lived and will live long after they are gone… he wonders if he ever feels like that. Like he is always a bit detached, a puzzle piece that doesn’t fit perfectly, and he always knows he never will. Because the puzzle will change, with time. The pieces will fall apart and be replaced, the image they build together is going to morph into something else entirely, and he will always,
Steve watches him leave, long after he disappears behind the buildings that obscure the horizon of the city, and he hears Wanda’s careful footsteps approaching him from behind a few moments later. He doesn’t turn, because he feels like she would feel intimidated if he did, as if he’d confront her about her feelings about this sudden visit, so she approaches calmly and stands beside him so they both can stare at the sky and breathe in deep, willing their hearts to slow down before heading back inside and facing the rest of their teammates.
The song becomes louder and their singing is no different from a war cry, but it inspires no dread – only the most vivid delight. Antonio did not think they would be so jubilant at the prospect of a

“Did he say why he came here?” Natasha asked, going around the ridiculously tiny center table to sit on the tattered sofa across Clint.
“Basically the same report, over and over again.” Rhodey replies frustratedly, his gaze sweeping swiftly through the people gathered before them, in a pondering manner. “They said they saw a lot of accidents, almost all of them. Some people found civilians and instructed them to stay together and indoors. A few of them—”
Steve likes to think of himself as an adaptable man.

“I asked him,” Nick continues, undeterred. “Why he needed to know. And you know what he said?”

And that, in itself, is more than enough reason for Steve to shut himself out at the mere thought of it, because he doesn’t want to give in to the things that make him doubt himself, that make him bleed.
No one says nothing on the comms.
That’s why Steve steps forward and extends his hand, not only as a gesture of gratitude, but as a way to remind himself that this is not an

He feels wrong. He feels heavy, and hot, and too much. The urge to take the phone out of his pocket and call is almost overwhelming, but he won’t do it in front of everyone else, he can’t afford to show that kind of unrestraint in front of his team. They are all sneaking glances at him, unsure. Waiting for his reaction. Waiting for his plan.

“Titan? No.” Tony shakes his head with total certainty. “There’s nothing there for him.”
“He attacked Bucky.” Steve confirms, solemnly.
There isn’t much he can do about access to SHIELD files with his limited skills, but his friendship with Howard Stark had not come without its benefits. He’s learned a thing or two about hacking into computer systems without leaving a trace, and he honestly doesn’t need much. Just a lead. Howard made very clear that Tony came to be as a secret project, and no other person but himself was involved in the process of his creation or coding, but by now, Jarvis has learned to doubt every single authority organization Howard Stark has ever worked with. Even if said organization was also founded by Ms. Carter and Mr. Stark himself.
He lowers his head forcefully, almost chin to chest, and Tony can only watch as he sighs and laughs breathlessly to himself, a one-sided conversation Tony can only interpret by his reactions, his thoughts unknown but clearly unkind inside his brain. It’s sad, how the defeat in his posture is the thing that makes the others relax, as if they are all able to sense that Barton has completely given up any attempt of a fight, and only this allows them to believe they won’t try to kill each other if they aren’t ready to intervene.
Pancakes now.
, too. Tony couldn’t. And he knows, in the secrecy of his own mind, in this silence that stretches between them when neither can find the strength or the words to speak, when the pause makes them so acutely aware of what they have just done and they both freeze and begin to shake in barely repressed sobs as the need to give voice to the anguish that is clawing inside them – he knows, even if she doesn’t, that he

He will always come back. He always has. Tony destroyed his armors, but built the Iron Legion; He promised less involvement with the fight, but then he built Ultron; he promised to sign a document that would keep him from fighting when he shouldn’t, and then he fought his own teammate over the very same document.

“So he didn’t kill all of you.” Rogers reasons, though Tony had assumed he would have known that – had Thor not told them either, or is this Steve making an argument against Thor’s logic?
“Honest mistake.” Tony tries to abate the aura of mistrust floating in the air by making his voice extra irreverent, placing a hand on Rhodey’s shoulder in a silent request for him to ease off a little. “Are you okay?”
Steve grinds his teeth together, before taking adeep breath and continuing, not exactly succeeding at keeping himself calm. “It’s not a

There is one thing in particular I'd like to mention that I feel like is essential to truly comprehend the differences in my approach and MCU's approach to A:E. Ironically, the issue is time. I've mentioned before that rumors have implied that the plot of this movie won't pick up until four years after the snap - and not only that, but in the very first minute of the trailer, we see Tony leave a voice message to Pepper, acknowledging he will die because he couldn't reach Earth on time. Do you know what this kind of moments causes? They cause what some people call regrets of the dying. The moment when you realize you're going to die and you can't stop it, many people - and I have no doubt in my mind that Tony is one of those people - simply let all their grudges and hesitations go. It's acceptance of death that causes complete surrender and erasure of past troubles.
“I’m okay.” Tony reassures her, holding himself with a strong grip at the seat, even when his body starts to drop in the same direction, his spine losing all strength bit by bit. “Just a little dizzy.”

Tony would’ve said this couldn’t get any worse, if he didn’t know that as soon as he steps a foot out of this place, it absolutely will.
T’Challa blinks at him. “But you think you are entitled to question me for the information about his decision.”
“You are helping.” Tony shifts his hand and pats him in the shoulder this time,

All of them, really. They’re an odd bunch, sure, but it works somehow. It’s a weird fantasy come true, a fast-paced life with an unexpected dash of domesticity – or as domestic as they can be, with two spies, a rage monster, a literal god, basically a time-traveler, and Tony himself.

There is only one sound, one constant, gentle whistle of a breeze that should not even exist, the low rumbling of a distant storm, something he can’t be sure if it’s truly there or it’s only a trick of his mind; A mockery of his senses, an illusion to somehow translate the mess within.
The harshness, the naked, unmasked truth of the words
“You don’t scare me.” Nebula quips back, because that’s how she is, and Tony really isn’t surprised.

It also keeps the awkwardness away, and they bond surprisingly fast over these peaceful moments.

I think no one is surprised by this result, but the winning prompt for the gift fic is Steve's POV from the reunion with Tony in the helipad, from Chapter 4 of this fic! I would like to thank everyone who voted so, so much, I hope anyone who has voted for the other prompts is not too disappointed, but I can promise I'll have many more opportunities to plan for other smaller fics to give more details on this universe and I hope you can look forward to that.

Bruce's personality is a breath of fresh air, amongst the Avengers. He is so nuanced and so... careful but unrepentantly straighforward at the same time that compared to the absolute mess that is our main duo, writing Bruce actually feels like giving my brain a rest. His origin story also puts a lot of things into perspective, a perspective Tony could surely benefit from. Not just that - Tony and Bruce hit off pretty well since the start, and this friendship, although not always presented in the right light in canon, is very clear cut and with a potential that AoU only ever brushed the surface of.

It’s always painful, to realize the rope is giving. That it’ll unravel and drop them both, if they don’t retreat. The weight is too heavy. Crushing guilt, unspoken secrets, too much conflict. An entire universe on their shoulders. It always comes down to this. To a point where the pressure becomes too much, and whatever weaving of connection they tangled between them is not enough to hold them together, as Tony sinks in, as Pepper tries to pull him out and Tony just keeps being pulled down by forces he cannot shake.

“It was always him. He gives the orders, and we just…” Tony makes a vague gesture with his hands, fully aware that it doesn’t really explain anything, but he doesn’t know how else to say it. How can he explain? Maybe at first it made sense, but over the years, as the fights with Pepper became more frequent, he became more and more aware that the Avengers’ dynamics had shifted into something Tony found extremely hard to put into words, even more so since Ultron. “We follow. Maybe that’s wrong – it

Tony and Thor are still guarding the House from the gates, the crowd slowly getting back into restlessness and confusion, but no longer charging forward in a way that’s frankly scary to watch, even for a superhero. Even Tony doesn’t know how to deal with such a raw, base feeling of hate as these people are acting on, not even when he felt at his lowest and felt what he thought had been at the most profound depths of the darkness in his mind. Knowing they’ve taken a step back, he’d be lying if he said it doesn’t make him take in an easier breath, and it’s the only thing that allows him to gesture to Thor and indicate that he can leave the area and relocate to a higher advantage point if he prefers to, since Tony knows he’d much rather have the high ground, and Tony blissfully won't feel completely vulnerable being alone down here right in front of the stunned attackers.

His eyes – blue, gold – lock onto Tony’s with unnerving, penetrating intensity, as if they can see far more than they should, and beyond Tony’s already paranoid feelings over being seen vulnerable, the fact that this is Thor, a god, a creature so different from Tony himself, from all of them; And beyond that, a person who Tony has never quite understood or connected with, a relationship within the team who had remained, in some ways, so distant still – that is the

“Dramatic supervillain voice?” Barton mutters to himself, but Nebula is close enough to hear it, and turns to him with an annoyed look in her dark eyes.
“It won’t be a problem.” Tony says – and deep down, he doesn’t know if he’s lying or not. To Bruce, and to himself. “It doesn’t matter anymore. We’re fighting the same guy this time. We won’t have any time to fight each other.”

A beat passes. “Stark?”
Sam looks at him confused, and only when the meaning of his own words dawns on him he makes an irritated face at Clint, flinging a fry in his direction, which Natasha catches so easily it never even gets close to hitting Clint. Sam huffs, annoyed, and Natasha eats the fry whole while looking him straight in the eye, her face completely blank. There is no trace of amusement in her eyes, only careful, cold consideration.
“Exactly.” Tony accuses. “So while we sit here, arguing about this, people are dying out there, and we have no way of stopping it. Finding him and bringing everyone back is the best way to make this right. It fixes everything, and no one dies.”
He doesn’t know he if he can.
“What about me?” Rocket asks.
“It would be good.” Natasha confirms. “We’d appreciate it a lot, Vision.”
“So should you, my dear.” He says with good humor, and she blinks owlishly for a second, surprised by the soft endearment. Howard hasn’t called her that in at least a couple of months. Maybe years. Maybe since… since Anthony had passed.
“C’mon.” He calls to them both, and walks back to the elevator, heading to the landing pad once again, unwilling to stay seated wallowing in misery for one second longer.
But now, when the one chance of happiness Tony still had for himself has walked out of his life, and the mission at hand doesn’t get any easier, only harder, and bleaker, and darker… What kind of face can he show to Thor, who has managed to do what Tony couldn’t anymore, to
It’s not his choice.
“He’s separating SI from the Avengers. Now the Avengers are run by the United Nations, he can’t have a private property running in the same location.  It seems like he was organizing this for a very long time, the announcement was made yesterday morning but the equipment is almost all ready to be shipped out. By the end of the month, the Tower will be empty.”
“We also need to worry about the people out there, Tony. Isn’t that what we agreed on?” Bruce reminds him, softly.
Clint barks out a laugh, full and good-spirited, as if Steve has just told a very good joke completely out of the blue.
“How do you know?” Tony insists. “Are you sure?”
But Barton, hiding a wife and kids on a farm in the middle of nowhere, suddenly roped into this superhero team—

“Well.” Sam grunts as he shifts position, so he can find his footing and stand. “That was a nice talk, and let’s never do that again, you understand me?”
“Pepper.” Tony says, and her name is an entire sentence, an entire speech far too familiar for it not to be recognizable, even in such a short breath, two syllables carrying the weight of an entire decade of a debate that never reached an end.
Steve is so appalled he can’t speak. He doesn’t
However, Natasha steals the options out of his hands, and decides the next move for herself.
Nebula stands up smoothly, snapping Tony from his turbulent thoughts, and he directs his attention to her only to find her stone-faced, her expression giving away nothing of what passes inside. Tony kind of wants to ask, wants to see if he can help her, if he could offer anything in return for all the silent kindness she has given him.

It’s all complicated because his rage and his nostalgia seem perfectly content in coexisting in the corners of his brain and in the cracks in his heart, unaware, or uncaring, that their mere presence is war at Tony’s soul. How can he be sure if his willingness to still work with the team is a display of maturity or just a bad idea, misguided by insistence and naïve hope? How can know if his refusal is pure stubbornness or the right choice, or even a choice he could possibly say it was founded on logic and fairness, and nothing else?

“Boss, if I may.” FRIDAY cheerfully interrupts, a bit more insistently than Tony expected of her.

“Get to work, Avenger.” Nick smiles, a tiny thing at the corner of his mouth, as Tony ungracefully gapes at the page and can’t find the words to reply before Fury turns around and walks out, like he owns the entire place.
, and gets closer, speaking for the first time since they all gathered here, seemingly unable to hold himself back any longer even for his grief.
Rogers takes the opportunity of silence to step forward, to stand beside Natasha, and after exchanging a quick look with her, he says:

believed he’d been doing the right thing. And even if it gave Tony the biggest headache he had ever felt to that day, he could understand, and he could respect it, because Tony knows what’s like to have his thoughts clouded by fear and distrust and paranoia. All Tony had been doing was trying to get Steve to see his intentions, to see he wanted to help. All Tony had wanted was Steve to understand that… even if it was happening in the worst of ways, even if Tony had made him feel cornered or fucked up in some other way unknowingly, Tony was trying, and all he had wanted to do was to help.

She presses her hands to her cheeks, trying to will the flush coloring her face away quickly, giving an almost inaudible sniff as she turns back to the computer. “Tony will love you.

Steve tries to think about how it must have been, for them. He revises the events in his head, going back years in the past to remind himself of that terrible realization, the discovery of the Winter Soldier’s identity, all the pain and sorrow it followed.
Steve, not for the first time, wonders what people see when they look at him and Bucky side by side.
“I can, but I don’t know what will happen to the internal structure.” Tony admits, and he has to cough to ease the sudden tightness in his throat, the words that get half stuck in his esophagus when he forces them out. “Right now, it’s kind of holding my stomach together. If I remove it, the particles of the mesh recede. I’ll start bleeding again.”
And so will Wanda.

considering this?” Pepper interferes, stepping forward, frantic. Tony, cruelly, ignores her.
“It’s weird, huh.” Tony says, but it’s not joking. Not quite. Just slightly amused. “Guess I just really missed having some sleep.”
He knew this would happen.
SHIELD’s satellites are probably still running, he guesses. Fury used to have the biggest database in the world, the very own database HYDRA tried to use when Rogers stopped their attack in Washington in 2014, and if there’s one thing that Tony is sure of, more than anything else, is that Nick Fury is a wary, sneaky son of a bitch, and that database has

Steve doesn’t look back. The tick in his jaw hurts from the pure force he uses when he clenches his teeth, almost biting his tongue on purpose to keep himself quiet, his heart beating a wild, frantic rhythm inside his chest.

Tony wants to cry. He wants to, but he can’t. He’s too exhausted. But deep inside, the turbulent, roaring feeling he is developing for Nebula, this twisted mess of mistrust and gratitude, it’s shifting and mutating into something that will latch onto him in a way Tony will never be able to let go of. He wants it to stop, but he can’t. He doesn’t want to get attached. He doesn’t want to feel like this.
And the movie starts but Steve is still there, frozen and confused, so… so overwhelmed that Tony would do this, would leave his workshop and bring him a smoothie while Steve’s passing time, to make him company and watch a movie with him – to

Because she was.
She wasn’t interested in him, not really. Steve knew. But he also knew he was hopeless at interacting with people, getting too attached or not at all, swinging in a continuous pendulum of two extremes that never let him settle down into a normal life.

“Since space and time are linked, Time is relative.” Bruce points out. “If an object – let’s say a planet – distorts Space in a certain way, it’s movement and it’s relationship with everything around it changes, and that includes its effect on Time. It’s how you get Time Dilation and all sorts of Time-related issues in physics. That’s why Einstein figured wormholes would be the way to figure out time-travel, because they’re so extreme that they way gravity acts around them is different than usual. The only other options are blackholes and certain kinds of stars, but none of them seem to act as a

, he never will be ashamed of protecting people and doing all he can to keep the world safe. It’s not about fame. It’s not about glory, or status, no matter what he made people believe during that terrible year of the Stark Expo, because he just… he was just trying to have some happiness and adrenaline before the Palladium took him out. But it was never about that.
But when he is alone, he has to fill his thoughts somehow, because he just can’t stand the silence anymore.
Tony ignores them. It’s the only reaction he can think to have.
“Bruce is probably in the lab.” Tony guesses. “He might want some Indian. Maybe Nepalese. There’s a nice place downtown that has amazing take-out. JARVIS has the number. Order it and put it on my tab.”

taking responsibility, Natasha?”
“We’ll be as quick as we can.” Natasha assures. “We’re on comms. Anything comes up, let us know.”
That’s not what Steve wanted. He didn’t want this conversation to turn sour so quickly. He wanted a peaceful moment with his best friend, just this time, just one moment where they could forget the world and act like this was still 1940 and they had nothing else to worry about but each other. Just a little sliver of normalcy. One single conversation where they could pretend the world outside isn’t raging in fire every single second of the day, that their connections with all others haven’t been destroyed or damaged in some sort of way. Just one. Just
“Yes, it has.” Visions answers equally polite. “I am glad you are all in good health, Captain. I am sorry if I frightened you today with my presence. I assure it was not my intention to make you feel unsafe.”
But he will not spare a single ounce of forgiveness for Tony.
“Thank you, Steve.”
Tony sees, through hazy eyes and with gasping breaths, that Rhodey is stepping off the jet and running in his direction, and Tony wants to run towards him too, but his legs feel stuck, like he has no joints, a mannequin about to dismantle itself on the floor, his thighs and calves so tense and stiff he might give himself a cramp even if he’s just
“But she’s terrified, Cap.” Clint explains, before Steve has the chance to answer. He steps closer, lowering the tone of his voice even more, to be completely sure Wanda won’t hear his next words. “She doesn’t understand her powers and she has to do something about it. She’s been getting stronger. And I honestly can’t blame her for being scared, because I’d be scared shitless too.”
“For SHIELD. And the mess with the Accords.” Steve explains, curtly. “Do you blame me?”
He… should. He should. Talk about it. It’s like Bruce said – he deserves to know, no matter how much Tony hates it. Bruce has already seen Tony do so many shameful things, Ultron the worst of it up to date, and it
They cry into the darkness in silence. They cry until there’s no tears left to spill, their bodies exhausted and wrung to all capacity, hollow and empty. Inert. The bed is cold and the room is colder, and they both are sweaty and trembling in each other’s embrace, weak comfort and thin discomfort existing in the same space, drowned beneath a thick layer of dull throbbing pain pounding into their temples.
(You’d think he’d have learned, by now.)
That’s as far as Tony had been willing to go. That had been another thing where he knew better than to get too close.
(If he had known)
His thoughts are a dangerous territory these days. Especially when Bucky is concerned.
The rest of him, everything else he is, all of him that is a soldier and a hopeless man, stands very still and waits for what’s to come the same way a prisoner waits for his sentence. The horrid possibility of being about to receive a confirmation of his worst fears, a final proof that he truly is the monster so many people have accused him to be, that… that
Tony had to prepare, and all of a sudden, he had no team to guard his back. In some worse days, he almost believed he never actually did, and he was losing time every single day he spent without doing something about it. So he got to work. He made suits, he made plans. Jackhammers to compensate the lack of other heavy-hitters to help him, cameras to the back of his armor because no one would be watching his six,

“Centuries ago.” Bruce exhales. “Way before the Tesseract was found. Or maybe they were found at the same time, but the Tesseract got hidden, and Agamotto just founded an entire secret society of monks around his.”

The Iron Man armor is so massive that not even his shield could slice through it, but if the impact had caused the armor to slam all of its weight in Tony’s chest, Steve might’ve fractured his ribcage. Which is no less concerning than damaging his heart.
“I had Time. I – I had the Time book.” Bruce shakes his head, reorienting himself. “Wong was right, it’s by far their most complete one, or at least it seems. Very precise, too. It does have spells – I guess it’s what they use when they create the rings and the… magic stuff. Probably what Strange worked with too, but it’s nothing we can replicate. Just

fall again, after his talk with Natasha. After this afternoon alone, with only his despairing thoughts as company. He wonders if T’Challa can see those kind of details through the projection of the communicator, and he sincerely hopes not. “I’m sorry, I meant to call you earlier.”
“What?” Nebula growls, voice rough and scratchy, but her eyes are tired and her complexion almost sickly, so weird, so new, Tony has never seen a machine like her before—

He opens his mouth, not even sure of what he wants to say, so he opens and closes it like a fish before finally managing to ask, “Sorry, are we talking about that same… sister? Gamora? Quill’s… whatever, girlfriend, or something?”

satisfied and pleased, full of smugness, as if Steve had just given him the exact answer he was looking for. Steve doesn’t know why that is, but his mind is running wild with the possibilities, uneasy with the look the king is giving him and oh, did T’Challa think he didn’t consider Tony a friend? Fuck, was that it?
He’d known, and he didn’t listen.
Government is destroyed. Society is destroyed. If someone, somewhere, with enough influence over the less secure people, decided to seize the opportunity to put themselves above others, they could cause enormous damage before they even hear about it. Almost all communication is down. This is –

“I thought I said we weren’t talking about it yet, but—” Tony sarcastically interrupts, a little louder this time, and Bruce still completely ignores him.
Vision looks back at her, nodding slowly, his gaze boring on hers intensely, and Steve sees from the corner of his eye the way Sam shoots Clint a look.

it, like a reluctant truth, like an old wound that sometimes still feels tender. Tony doesn’t know if she should try to explain himself, although he doesn’t know what difference it would make, because he has done it so many times before, or if he should just stay silent and don’t pretend she’s saying anything but the truth. This is not a fight. So maybe he shouldn’t fight it.
They go wider and wider, her frown deepening and her mouth gaping, emitting no sound. It’s that delay. It’s that unconscious refusal to admit, to connect the dots and allow the realization to sink in totally, trying to stave off the inevitable.
(But does it matter, now?)
And it is. He’s right. He’s – that’s just a fact. Rogers is right. But—

He doesn’t know how long they’ll be staying there. He doesn’t ask.
“Hey, calm down, it’s fine.” He assures, giving a pointed look to both Natasha and Sam as well, who have their own weapons at hand as well. “He’s alone. I checked a thousand times already.”
But he’s too terrified to figure out what else they can possibly break if they once again dare to move.
They’ll be fine. It’s not so bad outside that they can’t handle themselves. And they have to do it now, while it’s still not dark.
He has been in darker places. In darker thoughts. It’s true. It’s true that in the past, the desire to atone and the need to self-destruct had walked hand in hand from him, when the suit had been a shell to protect him from the own villain within, but Tony—

Why would she be so harsh?
“We have some translators too.” Rocket interrupts, jumping up the table so he can grab a book as well, turning it in all directions so he can inspect the cover. “If you can give us access to the robot lady’s data, we could download it to our stuff and work faster on it.”
But it isn’t that.
When this exchange is over, Rhodey runs his hand over his mouth, breathing deeply, and takes one step closer and squares his shoulders, pushing down his despair and irritation and turning himself into the military man they all know he is deep inside, and asks, attentively to their previous planning:
(Tell her.)
“I guess you will.” Clint replies amusedly, almost crooning. “Trust Stark on this one. I said some nasty shit for him when we were on the Raft, but you know what? The guy is just a softie. We all know he had something to do with the way Scott got off so easy on the trial, they wouldn’t have done it otherwise. And I remember that stuff Vision mentioned about the Stark Industries legal team.  It might have been a slip, but I caught it.”
hopelessly with a grief and an anger that only those who have lost it all can reach. The full breakdown. It’s explosive and torturous and
“You too.” Steve says, completely serious. He doesn’t comment about her hair; it’s short again, but in a different style, and a totally different color. It’s the first time Steve has seen her as a brunette, it’s a bit off-putting. He wonders if it’s on purpose. With Natasha, every single detail feels deliberate.
(He gets it.)
They never make it there.
Something in his stomach tightens at Natasha’s words, weirdly anxious, but she just keeps going before he can say a word.
, and the otherworldly feelings that come attached to it. Feelings that surpass his ability to describe them, feelings that still make him feel like his stomach is collapsing into itself when he thinks about it for far too long, his gut tight and overwhelmed, make him feel helpless and small and so, so lonely, and Rhodey’s presence seems like a beacon of light that reflects all the way from a distant past, from a mirror of a horror Tony never truly left behind, to guide him home.
“It was the only way I could stop him.” He justifies. “Tony wouldn’t
“We talked about the fight.” Wanda confesses, sounding ashamed. “I had to apologize.”
If he didn’t know better, he’d think his heart is trying to give out.
“Look, it doesn’t matter what Fury has or hasn’t been doing.” Tony says, before turning to Natasha. “You think you can reach them with just a message through FRIDAY?”

, for any form of assistance, and he’s surprised to find not Rhodey, but Nebula behind him, her fingers tight on his clavicle and her eyes as dark as the sky.
(The one hitting him on the chest, screaming in his face)
“Fair point.” Tony shrugs. “You wanna invite your super spy twin too? Thought she’d be here by now.”
Colder, by the day.

a little too close to his chest,
“Yes.” He nods. “Please, Tony. I think it’s better if I talk to her.”
That is enough for Steve’s treacherous, foolish, foolish heart.
instead of against them its exactly what they need.
Rhodey’s frown grows a little deeper, but when Tony offers him no other opening, he accepts it, and turns back to the front.
Steve’s fingers itch with the need to fiddle with something, to stop his hands from reaching for his hair to tug at it.
(Oh, Natasha.)
He probably does. He must. The Avengers are still his team, even when they’re apart.
No one talks about the solo Hulk movie these days. Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to break this vow of silence.
“No, it’s—” He coughs. “It’s fine.”

“Wait, hold on.” Sam steps into Steve’s line of sight, looking back and forth between them with his eyes as wide as saucers. “You
“How can she tell?” Nebula interrupts with a hard frown on her face, making Tony startle a little as her hand reaches for him again, surprisingly soft, her touch almost silky despite the texture of her fingertips, hardened by wounds and battle.
“I know.” Steve takes a breath, ignoring the way it sounds so shaky when it passes through his chest, and he forces out a small smile and a huff, trying to keep things light. Just for now. For now, this is enough. “Maybe I should let my beard grow out. Might help with the disguise.”
Tony usually loves when things start to makes sense, but now, he really, really doesn’t like it. He can still argue that Vision’s nature has nothing to do with him, and everything to do with Thor – the hammer thing was more than enough proof for him, even if Thor would disagree. But
But he doesn’t.

Steve blames himself for letting Bucky fall. Bucky feels guilty that Steve feels guilty.
If he doesn’t answer,
“Can I just—” Tony gulps, and licks his lips, and is glad she’s leaning against him again because this way she can’t see his face as the tears come down without any way to stop them, copious and furious, heavy and consuming, his heart hurting like it’s been dealt a physical blow, like it’s shriveling and dying inside his cold chest. “Can we just – lay down? For a bit? Just – Just – Right here, just a little—”
“Wanda, he can’t stay forever.” Steve softly says. “He would be breaking the Accords—”

Natasha nods, and she looks like she wants to believe him, but can’t quite make herself to do it.

And Rocket follows them, confused, because – How else would he feel, really. How else, when he is… When he’s truly the most stranded out of all of them, the one who came from far away and was left with nothing, nothing but the company of people he barely knew, and all forms of contact the attempted to find his own team only came back with silence and more dread?
“You know the Smithsonian has some of your drawings, don’t you?” Tony comments. “They’re literally there for everyone to see. Why can’t I see your sketchbook, c’mon, Steve?”
But he doesn’t talk about it. He thought it would be for the best if no one else got involved in things they didn’t need to be. They had done enough. Far too many lines had been crossed already, and Steve would’ve liked to avoid any more unnecessary conflict or misunderstanding in the future. Who knows what they might lose next time? What if the next time it happens, it’s irreversible?
between us, if you want to call it that, and it… It caught up to us. The cracks in our armor.”
Steve likes dancing, and he likes spending time with his friends, both of which Club A is made for, so why wouldn’t he? It’s fun, hanging out when the training is done, or after a round against AIM – Vision plays sometimes, but even when he doesn’t the music is nice, the bar has a nice selection of beverages and snacks, and there’s a pool table.
“They were ready.” Steve concedes, but there’s absolutely no emotion in his voice as he says it. He feels so

They reach the first floor eventually – too soon, yet not soon enough – and they walk as silently as they can while searching for a way out.  Nebula spots the signs that guide them to a back door, the plaques that lead to the secondary exit, the back entrance, right ahead of them, and that’s where she takes them. And the more it gets closer, the more difficult is to Tony to keep walking, the harder it is for him to obey the very simple command of
, misshapen mass of it, jammed across the street before it disappears beneath a mountain of concrete blocks on their left.
And they do what they have to do.
“Yeah. Fine.” Tony waves away the concern, lowering his head to hide his eyes and shrugging to attempt even the slightest hint of nonchalance.
Steve waits for a few seconds, wondering if she will do anything besides just stand there, and when she doesn’t he decides to step forward, trying to keep his steps light and silent, the atmosphere of the cold night and the fake anonymity that the darkness grants them feeling far too sacred to be disturbed by the loud sound of his boots.
“If they have turned to ash—” FRIDAY repeats, because she knows Tony isn’t listening, she knows what is happening to him, and she’s
Okay.
in this story will be random. Nothing will happen "just because". Everything has a reason and a function, and I'm very excited to know if anyone can already see the impact this will have going forward on the story, and in Tony's character overall.
“It was.” Clint agrees mournfully. “But she did do it, Steve. It happened. People are going to get mad. People will want revenge. It’s just what happens in this kind of job. There’s a lot of consequences when we get things wrong.”
Thor makes a pause. “Yes, I imagine it is. If he were to be honest, we wouldn’t even be having this conversation.”
“I think Thor’s right.”
Yes, but it’s also what he’s trying to avoid.
