Wanda, my twin, I couldn't be who I am today without you by my side keeping me in the right and out of jail. I want to protect you now, as you did then. I love you, sister.
Before we can say anything else Pietro rushes off with Clint in tow. Wanda, Bucky and myself walk back inside together. Wanda waves to us as she enters her room.
I jump out of the bed hugging Steve and then Tony, "Congratulations guys, you're going to be really happy together."
"Korg, I think it'd be best if you hang out on the ship," Lily says, "the people from here are kind of judgmental and will think you're a bad alien."
He sighs, reaching into his pocket taking out a packet of papers and a pen handing them to her. Avery reads through it quickly then signing the signature line, she hands them back to Nick.
"Dylan, we just got here," Bucky urges me, "At least have something to eat and then we'll call Tony after lunch."
"Let's get a move on Laura," I yell upstairs, "It's a long flight to the base and your grandfathers are worried sick about you."
Everyone but Laura looks at me like I have two heads, "I know my daughters heartbeat, I've heard it for ten years, I knew that it was hers at our first appointment," I continue, "It's complicated but we're all fine, Laura's powers are now fully evolved, our connection is finally where it's supposed to be and Hydra can't take use us like they've been trying for years."
Loud cheers burst from the crowd as the two make their way into the reception area, Steve as red as can be being the center of attention and Tony just lapping it up. They make their way to the head table that's just for them as everyone else takes their seats as dinner is served.
“I’m fine, just annoyed,” she says, turning to face the man, “I’m just hungry, I’ve been unpacking all day.”
"Well, we can do that at the picnic with Laura there," Bucky answers me in English causing Tony to have a panicked look on his face.
I stand up from the chair I was sitting in and walk over to Pietro, motioning for him to follow me into the kitchen.
She stands up and helps other people to their feet as a red, white and blue blur flies past them. She turns, looking in the direction that it came from to see Steve standing there fight a robot next to him. He looks towards the direction of where his shield went, noticing Avery as he does so.
“Steve’s going to be pissed. He’s been looking for Bucky for months and you found him right after everything that happened in Washington,” Sam says.
She walks over to us shaking his hand. After looking around the room I notice that there is a small crowd entering the kitchen. Steve walks over to Tony sitting on one of the bar stools, wrapping his arm around the smaller man.
I walk over to him wrapping my arms around his neck, "I couldn't have done it anyway." I say as he rest his forehead on mine, I close the distances between our lips quickly. I pull away and turn to walk out of the base with Bucky's arm around my shoulders.
"None, cause if we do they'll know what it feels like to get 3rd degree burns," I say not facing him.
“It’s just my uncle, I’m supposed to be at my place to help the movers pack up the truck,” she says, “it can wait.”
I kneel down and hug each of them. I turn towards Laura kissing her on her head, "Goodnight sweetheart."
“We buzzed up but there wasn’t any answer,” Dad says when she shoots a confused look in his direction.
He turn and walks out of the room shutting the door behind him, I calm myself knowing that my face is as red as Tony's Iron Man Suit.
"I can talk to the doctor alone for a second," I say turning to Tony and Dad, they nod walking out of the room, "Can you check on-on the baby? I'm a few days along and want to know that they made it through the fight."
"I am sorry," he says in a quiet voice, "I know that it probably does not change anything but if I was Bucky back then I would have stopped. If I wasn't the Winter Soldier, I would have taken your life into account."
I watch as they walk into the base and look back at the table, it's only Wanda, Bucky and myself left at the table; Pietro dragged Dad up onto the dance floor. I look at Wanda sway in her seat to the music just as Vision makes his way over. He asks her to join him for a dance and she happily accepts leaving me and Bucky alone.
I see Clint's neck get red with blush just like mine does when I'm nervous. I tap him on the shoulder and quickly sign to him
"For you it is," I say putting the towel in the hamper, "I'm here to talk to you as a friend and your fiances daughter about the wedding."
"Like hell I do, I survived just fine without parents," I spit at him again, "He might be my biological father but he's not my dad," I say as I reach into my pocket and pull out the cell phone I bought after getting rescued. I dial Tony's number and lift it to my ear.
I walk down the hallway and turn into my room seeing Clint, I mean dad, and Bucky walk the rest of the way to their rooms in silence.
"I mean, yes, he's Laura's father and I've seen just how much he's changed," I say looking at my feet.
Tony opens his mouth to speaks when Jarvis cuts him off, "Sir, we have arrived and are beginning our descent."
“I got it,” she says, pushing off the counter, “my phone’s been ringing all day so I don’t really want to answer it just yet.”
I walk over and pick up the book that she's pointing to, hand it to Bucky and we walk over to her bed.
He hands out the champagne to everyone, "To the playboy finally getting off the market," he says raising up his glass. We cheers and each take a sip.
We continue into the hanger and wait for the quinjet to land. After it lands the hatch opens and out walks Natasha and Clint, once they walk out I finally realized why the names rang a bell. Natasha is the reason why I was kidnapped and brought to the Red Room at age 7 from my father, Clint.
"One of," Loki says, receiving puzzled looks from the Avengers, "you said the one person, he is one of the two people being kept alive by an Infinity Stone."
I feel two arms wrap around me and help me out of the morgue, my eyes are still unable to focus on anything around me.
“Sokovia, they have a beautiful mountain range and I want to hike it,” Avery says, “but I’ll be moving back to New York after my vacation.”
She nods as he flies off, turning back to the child on the ground. She reaches her hand out and help him up, supporting his weight she walks him onto the airport. Once he’s inside they find a bench and sit him down, she shrugs off her bag and open it removing her first aid kit.
The shouting got louder and more clear, "Ohhh, God. Tony please, we have tooooooooooo," I sit there and burst out laughing.
"I guess, that's what I'm asking," I reply, "I knew if I brought this up with Pietro we would end up here with you, but I just thought he'd be the one asking."
I see the base again and notice that Malick is standing in front of me and I'm being held by two guards in fireproof suits.
I turn to face him, he's about a couple of inches taller then me but looks so small at this moment. I step closer to him and raise my hand to push the hair out of his eyes but stop myself inches from his face.
She starts the engine and pull out of her parking spot never once looking into the rear-view mirror. Following the directions given to her in Russian short one worded statements until she’s told to pull off. They end up in a dark alleyway in a bad part of town.
Bucky finds a bench under the shade of a tall tree and we sit there watching as Clint and Laura help Nathaniel through the structure.
When we heard about the satellite that crashed in New Mexico and saw images of it we knew it was Mjolnir.
"Lila, must you go tonight," Loki questions, looking over at the guard skeptically, "I do not trust the looks of the guard. He appears to be plotting something wicked."
"I-I'm so sorry," he says as the tears over flow, "I shouldn't have left the base when I read your note. I should have gone and looked for you and drag you back to bed. I don't want to loose you, I never want to feel alone again. Dylan, I'm sorry for all the shit I put you through."
We burst through the doors at the medical wing and are escorted straight to a private room. Bucky puts me down on the bed and is then ushered out as the doctor examines me. I sit there as he carefully pokes around my two sides, lower back, and pelvic area. After that he hooks me up to a machine to monitor my vitals and sends out for the ultrasound equipment. Once the equipment is in the room he hooks it up and checks on the baby, he also examines me to check and see if it's with my uterus.
"We know that you'll do anything for her, that's why we're taking her from you so you'll be more likely to," Strucker says as he walks in, "comply to our orders."
"I shouldn't be here with you, I have to leave this base," Loki says not looking at me, "The marriage does not have to happen."
"Well they should be. Clint's moving in here after a divorce and he's bringing his one year old son," Steve said as the doors to the lab open, "You didn't break anything, right Tony?"
"I'd want to be not engaged," I state coldly, "I don't want a wedding, I don't want to get married. That's just something else that people can use against me, it's rough enough having Laura and this little guy on the way but a husband that's just too much. I see how people torture loved ones, I saw what happened to Laura and I also lived it, so if Bucky ever proposed I would turn him down because I don't want him to get hurt because of me."
I nod, knowing not to push him into telling me what it was. I stand and walk over the the broom Steve insisted on leaving beside the fridge, I start cleaning up the broken glass and plates. Bucky walks over to the bar stool and sits there staring off into space.
I stand on the front lawn as dad and Natasha walk up to the front door, they open it and walk right in.
I quickly walk into the bathroom and change before he can give me his puppy-dog eyes. After I'm sure he's done pouting at the closed door I walk into the room and curl up under the covers quickly falling asleep.
Lily wakes up with a start looking around her dark room, rubbing her eyes she reaches for her phone.
"I'm fine," Bucky answers walking into the kitchen, "I just think I should leave. It would be better for the team if I were to go."
"It's fine, I'm fine," I reach my hand up intertwining our fingers, "James, we should move in together. I know it's sudden but I'm ready for this step."
"I want my Dad, I want Clint back right now. Has anyone called him and told him I'm in labour," I rant on, "Does he know that he's about to be a grandfather again?"
"Shhh, Dylan, it's okay," I feel Bucky rub my back as I sit in bed hyperventilating, "It's okay, he'll understand."
I'm really glad you guys enjoyed this one, again this is one of the first times I'm putting my writing out there.
"Oh, so this between us," Bucky says with a hurt tone, "isn't reality, isn't real. Well I'm glad to know how much I fucking mean to you."
She looks up about to reply when she realizes he’s gone and she’s alone in a dark alleyway in the worst part of town.
“Captain Rogers, you on the other hand are going to need stitches,” she says examining at his side, “it’ll just take a mom-”
"You want me to tell Clint to bring them out here," Pietro asks still standing by my side. I nod not trusting myself to say yes.
"This," Lily says, motioning to Happy, Tony, Rhodey, Eric, and herself, "is the Avengers. Everyone else is a 'fugitive' because they didn't want to sign the Accords."
"Okay, well after Sokovia I realized that I needed to get away from being the other guy for a while," I start, "So I landed in the water just off the cost of Hawaii, where Betty's been working since Harlem. I met up with her and we started dating again, keeping everything very low key."
“Throw her up Buck, I got her,” Steve calls back as she’s launched into the air and caught by Steve. He moves them inside the stairwell away from the chaos.
Standing, she pulls on a sweater over her tank top and slips on a pair of flipflops and makes her way outside. Once in the cool air of the early morning, Lily starts to relax and walks towards the few trees lining the edge of the property.
"We have bigger problems," she says, grabbing the translation from Happy's hand, "this is the real problem."
At this point I turn and walk out of the kitchen. I end up back in my room and grab a bag from the closet and start packing. I don't realize that I'm not alone until I feel a hand on my upper arm turning me around.
"So what your saying is we shouldn't get married," Pietro asks defeated, as he sits on the stairs and stops walking.
"Well, those aren't that bad, easy to control," Tony rambles, "I thought that you were going to tell us you could fly from how Laura was acting."
Before walking in to my room, I see the blush raising on the back of Steve's neck at my comment. I smile to myself while I push open the door, I walk in and see Bucky sitting on our bed ready a book that Bruce suggested him.
"You left," Bucky says, "You left without saying anything to me. You left our daughter and your family."
"They're trying his reset code, if he doesn't change back to the Winter Soldier he's good to go," Steve says not looking towards me.
"About two months ago, we had a small, intimate ceremony and got married," I say, which earns a punch in the arm from Tony, "I was planning on coming back with Betty and having a larger wedding with everyone in a month or so from now but Dylan talked us into coming back now."
“Avery, there’s more going on here than just Bucky waking up,” he says still dragging her from the restaurant.
"From that, it sounds like you only like having fun with him, you don't want an emotional connection," I say getting out of his hold and continue packing, "It's doesn't matter what I said, I just have to leave here."
Slowly she dragged her tired aching legs up the stairs to her apartment after a long day at work. She pulls her keys out and unlock her door as her phone goes off, she looks at the screen as she pushes through the lead like door.
They all break into a jog and head towards the base where the others are fighting. Lily looks around at the scene before her and notices how close they are to beating this wave of aliens. Out of the corner of her eye she sees a ripple in the trees, the next thing she sees in Thanos walking out of the trees. He looks in her direction, smiling when he finally lays his eyes on her. Lifting his hand in the gauntlet he shows off the empty spot, the one empty spot.
"Have you ever tried this before," I ask looking down at my hands, "Have you ever tried to remove traces of science from someones brain before?"
“But I think we’re ready too,” she says, cupping his cheek in her hand, “if we’re weren’t I wouldn’t have told you the truth.”
Clint and Avery sit down on one of the last life boats waiting to go back to the Helicarrier when a mother starts freaking out because she can’t find her son. She watches as Clint looks back out onto the flying city to find her son.
"I don't want to remove it today," she says, "I'd like to keep it in there as long as possible, but this can replace the Infinity Stone if Thanos manages to remove it?"
"Well, from the looks of everything," the Doctor says removing his gloves, "Your water broke and you're dilated 7cm. I'll be back in a couple minutes to prep you for pushing."
"Technically. When were at the doctors there were two heartbeats, but I could only hear one voice," I say as Bucky looks at me concerned, "I knew something wasn't right because the headaches kept getting worse and the worst one was after our appointment. Now after everything that happened in there," I say motioning to the morgue and Laura, "I know that if we go to the doctor and get an ultrasound, there will be one heartbeat, and if we monitor her heartbeat it will be the same as the second one we heard in our first appointment."
As if on cue the elevator doors open again and out walks Bruce. Everyone stands there in shock as the man that they haven't seen in years walk into the living room.
She starts running not paying attention to where she's going, her feet getting cut up by the rocks and branches that lie underfoot. She is thrown to the right by a blast of energy, quickly she's back up on her feet running again. She looks over her shoulder quickly and collides with a cold metal suit, knocking her on her ass.
"Shouldn't you let your best friend in to help with all the crap you're going through," Pietro says picking up the shirt I dropped, "I mean it is hard coming here facing everything but I want to be here for you."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Will you," he asks, materializing a simple necklace with an amber coloured snowflake shaped pendant, "promise to spend eternity with me as my wife?"
We sit there a little while longer in silence, before Steve excuses himself and heads in the same direction as Bucky. Pietro comes into the room and leaves almost as soon as he enters after Wanda said something to him in Russian.
I look at the watch Pops has on his wrist, it's no where near time for Nate's nap. I stand up and grab Pops hand, not wanting to get lost. We walk towards the car using the same path as earlier, I look around hoping to see signs of Momma but I don't.
I walk over to my bed and take a seat, placing my head in my hands. I feel his arms wrap around my waist as he leans his head onto my shoulder.
"I'm guessing you know, well everything. I mean Pietro said that you guys hardly have any secrets and that you'd probably find out anyway," I say as we look back towards the base.
The Valkyrior went to fight Hela and most of them perished at her hand. My mother had me and my sister a couple of hours after they were supposed to have returned. We grew up with the love and protection of our people, Odin keeping a close eye on me. I was trained in fighting but things made me turn my back on it.
Tony knows that he’s not fighting fair, and Steve plays right into the palm of his hand. “I want you. God, do you have any idea how much I want you?”
“This is the best thing that’s happened to me in a while,” Tony teases as Steve herds him backward towards the bed.
“Tony, you said you weren’t going to push.” Steve chastised, and it took all of five seconds for his brain to recalculate the gasp he took for outrage and surprise as desire and want.
Things had changed. Or at least, they had changed for Steve, back when he had spent the beginning of their relationship trying to atone for the things they’d said to each other. When Steve had started to truly see Tony for who he was, not the layers of smoke and mirror Tony presented to the world, showering him with praise and thanks until Tony was glowing with it.
It’s not fair, really. After all this time, and all the heartache, for them to get just a snippet of what things might be again. But then, if it hadn’t been for Strange and his apocalyptic revelation, Steve wouldn’t even be here in the first place.
It almost feels like more than that. Steve knows it’s only been hours. Tony had dozed in his hospital bed with him just yesterday, and Steve had watched the glow through his shirt. But it feels like he hasn’t seen it in years.
“Me too.” Steve admits. “But you still want to? Talk, I mean, see if we can start to figure some of this out?”
“He appears to have been relieving himself, Sir. The Winter Soldier reached sexual climax shortly after you and the Captain—”
For the time being, Tony holds Steve close and breaths him in, drifting into the quiet that stretches between them on the heels of Steve’s sobs. His breathing evens out under Tony’s hand while he traces the mosaic of interconnected muscle in Steve’s back that flows and constricts beneath his fingers.
Steve groans, pulse thundering in his ears as he comes, streaking Tony’s mouth, his cheeks, his jaw. A little bit drips down onto his shirt, but Tony’s already too far gone to notice, shuddering as he comes on the hard concrete, spilling into his own hand. Steve didn’t even have to
It’s blurred with Steve’s blood splattering onto his face and his arms raised over his head above him—
?” If that isn’t the fucking icing on the cake. “Are you fucking serious? Meant more to you. Fucking hell, Rogers! You’re one delusional motherfucker, aren’t you?”
The program switches to Siberia next and Tony already knows what’s going to happen, and he knows why Steve won’t be able to break through. It’s so obvious; Steve has to know that by now, so why does he keep trying?
Tony huffs a breath and feels his mouth pull back into a sneer he tries to prevent, but loses. “So what if I have? It was only a matter of time, wasn’t it?”
Steve laughs, slowing until his fingers are just resting inside of Tony. He savours the clenching heat of him as Tony makes little mutters of protests and squirms in his grasp. “Which is it, Tony? Stop, or hurry up?”
“Fuck me.” Tony doesn’t miss a beat. His head rolls to the side, and Steve catches a glimpse of red cheeks and blown-black eyes before Tony’s eyelids flutter closed. His body jerks under a final sharp crook of Steve’s fingers, buried into the hilt again. “Yes, yes, baby. Just fuck me. That’s what I want. Fuck me every day for the rest of our lives.”
Coming here was a terrible idea and it wouldn’t have taken a psychic to tell him that he and Steve would end up at each other’s throat again. He just didn’t anticipate it would be about
“Mr. Stark, seriously.” Peter shoves his hand off his shoulder but shoots him an embarrassed little half-grin that Tony returns with a shit-eating one of his own. “It’s Spider-
When Tony glances back towards the edge of the building, Barnes is gone, stolen away into the night and Tony’s left reeling with a half-hard cock twitching against his thigh and adrenaline coursing through his veins.
Steve waits for the regret to set in, staring at Tony as if he’s seeing him for the very first time, but it doesn’t come.
That doesn’t register, so Tony skulks numbly back down to his workshop to spend the rest of the evening pointedly ignoring a half-empty bottle of booze on the far counter. He can’t bring himself to pour it out yet. He might still need it.
Tony's taken a bad hit a few minutes ago, and for a long moment Steve had held his breath, feeling the sear of pain up his forearm. Underneath his gloves, his soulmark is on fire, a beacon of warning that his soulmate is injured.
There had been a glimmer of something in the first letter. An almost genuine apology, closer than Steve had ever gotten before and because Tony didn’t read the rest of the letters, he lets himself believe that Steve was getting there.
“Are you sure you can even take me like this?” The feel of Tony’s slicked up cock rubbing between his cheeks mocks him with a blunt jab against his hole. Steve growls a curse into his forearm and pushes back, but he’s held fast.
“I ain’t complainin’.” Bucky assured him. “You sure you want this? ‘M more than happy to stay here with the goats. Don’t wanna go anywhere I’m not wanted. Done a lot of that already.”
It’s foreign and unusual, not the kisses that Tony remembers but something more delicate. As if Steve truly understands the fragility that he holds in his hands and Tony is grateful for that because with Steve’s mouth on his and his tongue tracing along the seam of his lips Tony feels like spun sugar ready to shatter.
Tony chuckles against his lips, grinning into the next series of kisses while fingers trailing up under Steve’s shirt and following the lines up his back. “Not sick of me yet?”
Tony narrows his eyes. “This feels scripted. It’s a trap. You don’t really mean it. Who are you and where is Steve Rogers?”
He grilled up steaks the size of Clint’s face, paired with creamy Caesar salad and a potato salad recipe his Ma used to make before the war set in. Things became a bit more complex with Natasha’s cabbage rolls, which came out perfectly, stinking up the Tower with the smell of boiled cabbage.
Steve kisses him again, claiming his mouth like he’d claimed him as his partner in front of everyone. He kisses Tony like if he licks deep enough into his mouth, they might learn how to share air, never having to part to take a breath.
Tony licks a stripe behind his ear and Steve noses at his jaw when he laughs. “That’s never going to happen.”
“Gross, no dismemberment during mealtimes,” Clint flicks a piece of the arm off the table and back towards Bucky. It bounces off his chest and onto the floor.
Outside the workshop he could hear Steve and Bucky’s muffled voices and he curled in on himself, snuggling further into the mass of blankets and pillows that had started on the workshop sofa and spilled over onto the floor sometime in the past few days.
He springs out of bed with as much speed as he can at this advanced age. Steve is tired. The type of bone-weary tired that makes every breath a battle and every footstep a trek through layers of quicksand. It feels like his time must be coming soon, and when it does Steve will be ready.
“Not intentionally. I was with you over the Accords, right up until the moment I realized that it wasn’t going to work. I wasn’t double-crossing you; I wasn’t playing both sides. I genuinely backed your play. But when I realized Steve wasn’t going to quit… someone was going to get hurt, or killed. Not letting them go would have been more than I was willing to sacrifice.”
Steve groans and cups his chin, jerking his face back up to plunder Tony’s mouth. He shoves his tongue between Tony’s lips and relishes the little moan Tony rewards him with, sucking on him the same way those expert lips wrap around his dick.
“It’s not ridiculous, sugar. It’s in your nature. You can’t help it.” Bucky said gently, then added, “no more than when Stevie bends you over and tells you he’s gonna fill you up with his pups, y’know.”
Being clothed helps him heave his defenses back into place and he feels himself put distance between them, shoving Steve back onto his side of the line and telling himself already that this was a mistake. That now he’s back at square one with a broken heart and a stomach full of rage, blackened around the edges with sorrow and grief.
He sighs. Apologies are never as satisfying when you still want the fight. “Wow. How hard was that?”
and he’s taken a massive risk coming back to the United States in the first place. While he’s gone, Bucky and the rest of the team are unprotected in Wakanda. Natasha, Wanda and Sam are a formidable opponent to any enemy with the Wakandans as a welcomed ally, but worry still twists like barbed wire in his belly.
Tony’s breath is coming quicker, the round flesh of his ass perfectly filling Steve’s palms as he urges Tony closer. Little shivers of pleasure race under Tony’s skin until he’s a mess of desire, reaching down to get a hand around his cock. The wet tip rubs up against Steve’s belly every second or third thrust, and it makes his mouth water.
It’s an odd look on the man who claimed to love him. Who had held him and cherished him, made a home inside of Tony’s body.
When he throws a quick remark over his shoulder, that it might be nice for old time’s sake, Tony just gapes at the closed door. Had he entered the Twilight Zone? A parallel universe? Did the multiverse actually exist?
But Steve has clearly broken through this memory already, because what Memory-Steve actually says is different.
Just like all the times before, Tony responds beautifully, licking into his mouth like a starving man—like he’s dying for it—and Steve lets him take. It’s been Tony since day one, everyone knew it and even when they’ve all but torn each other to pieces, Steve craves him.
Steve muffles a moan into Tony’s lips and that’s all it takes. The urgency rushes back anew and Tony wraps his legs around Steve’s waist, holding him down so he can shove up against him, desperate and needy for any sort of friction his neglected cock can have. Steve matches him the way he always had, thrust for thrust, kiss for kiss, shoving a hand underneath Tony’s thin t-shirt to explore bare skin.
When Tony eventually pulls away and starts zipping up his pants, Steve follows suit. He pushes off the car and reaches down to tug his jeans up when Tony gasps.
“Yeah. Godmother, if Mom was to be believed, but she and Howard had a falling out a few years after I was born. They never mentioned it after that. Aunt Peg was always there in the background, though.”
“It’s too big a risk. We have Morgan now, Tony, and we’re retired. We have to think about what’s best for Morgan. It’s not just you and me anymore, and the others—”
Cracking one eye open, Steve’s surprised by how vivid everything seems. The sun is bright, spilling through the floor to ceiling windows and bathing the room in warm light. His heart races in his chest at the thought that they might all be here tonight—his team, comfortable and domestic, waiting for him just outside the door to his apartment.
Pain clouds Steve’s eyes and almost instantly Tony sees a glimmer of tears there. If Steve starts crying, Tony will start crying and then where will they be? Sobbing over the broken pieces of their marriage in the street?
Steve and Bucky wandered down to the workshop, entering both of their codes and coming up unsuccessful which was… unexpected. Steve had had access to all of Tony’s personal spaces since New York, save the first few weeks of their return, and Bucky had gained equal status not long after he’d come into the fold of their relationship.
New York was a bittersweet place before the so-called Civil War. Falling out of the wormhole had changed him, and irrevocably altered his love for the city. When the ghosts of Steve Rogers had started to linger around all his favourite corners, there had been no more reason to stay.
in the suit, tucking an arm around Steve’s waist and hooking a leg around both of Steve’s ankles before Tony barrel rolls them through the sky. It’s Coney Island kicked up to the max, and Steve’s stomach rolls and pitches but he can’t stop smiling.
When he had begged not to feel so lonely, this isn’t quite what he was hoping for. Resentment burns like acid in the back of his throat.
When he spares a glance up, Tony’s eyes are squeezed shut, and he looks destroyed, every little line of emotion written across his features. His dick is half-hard between his legs, wanting but weighed down with grief. It feels wrong to do this now, even when Tony shoves both hands into Steve’s hair and pulls him closer, roughly dragging his chin up.
In all reality, no one will see them. They’re too high up and it’s too late into the night. That’s not the point. Steve wants them to see him, whoever
Tony’s eyes were closed, but he was scenting him gently, smelling of contentment and safety that lingered on his tongue and had the faint taste of caramel.
Peter looks like he’s about to sink into the floor, and there’s a green tinge to the near-translucent skin around his cheeks. He’s just a kid and they’re fighting in front of him, the same way that good old Howard and Maria did with him.
. Finding Barnes… Well, that’s something I could do. I can help you find him and maybe if he’s not a complete fucking cyborg murderbot, we can fix him. Then it’s not all for nothing, right?” Tony’s voice chips at the end but his eyes flash with a fierce warning.
It’s already taken him several hours and everything shy of shock therapy to remind himself that Steve has already thrown their marriage away. Tony could forgive him, maybe, for decimating him with the shield. Compared to everything else that feels almost like a lover’s spat.
He’s used that voice with him before, but with a pout on his bottom lip; a ridiculous look on the grown man that calls himself Captain America. He tries to shove the memory away, because it’s almost always followed up with Steve pinning him down, waiting for him to give over, give up, again and again.
“I want you to stop being so selfish,” Tony hisses. “I want you to admit that you’re flawed, just like all the rest of us. I want you to
This wasn’t the Tony that he had wanted, warm and welcoming, thankful and satiated the way he’d been every time before.
“You should go first, Buck.” Steve suggested, hands coming to grip at Tony’s hips so he could lean in and nip at his chest. When he captured one of Tony’s nipples between his teeth, sucking and then biting down lightly, it was Bucky who groaned.
“Nobody’s asking you to look, To—” His name gets lost in a fit of coughing and Steve allows himself to be led to the old leather couch in the corner of the workshop.
He swallowed the last of the tasteless pasta, passing his dessert towards the sad older woman across the table who never spoke and the images disappeared. She’d been here longer than Steve could bear to comprehend, a constant reminder that even when Tony was here with him, they were anywhere but home. No one ever came to her weekly visits.
“It was a simple fix, you know.” Tony’s eyes are fixed on the ceiling and his breathing is slow and even.
“Wow,” Tony says with a teasing air. “Your best guy, huh? Tell me I’m your fella next, Rogers. Really put the accent into it, too.”
Now he understands why they say you should never send the letters you write when you’re processing. They never warn you about the risks. How simple words that mean nothing when they’re sent out into the universe land in the hands of someone else and explode like landmines, the shrapnel of guilt and growth exploding on an unarmed civilian.
Tony solders while Steve is gone, savouring the way that metal, when heated, effortlessly binds together and cools into something new.
Every sound is a reminder of the first time. It’s always like this when Steve is under him. A mental movie that Tony could watch again and again, never tiring of the hard lines of Steve’s body between his legs and under his hands.
“I know.” He wipes at the corner of Steve’s eyes with his thumbs, dropping them down to trace across his beautiful, trembling mouth.
“What do you want, Steve?” Even though they’re tucked into a corner, half obscured by the massive red drapery that adores the conference room walls, Steve should know better than this. There are always eyes on them these days, and the press would kill for a scene at an event like this. Another lover’s quarrel to tear the Avengers apart.
Plus, Steve wants them to get to a place where they could coexist in the same space, and he needs to at least try. He
“I’m not!” Tony crows, breaking out into a grin. “I’m making Barnes sand those out tomorrow. Can’t wait to see the look on his face when I tell him how you—”
Steve starts to come apart under him. Tony feels it in the way his thighs start to tremble and Steve’s fist works rapidly across his cock. Between them, Tony’s prick is red and aching, disappearing in the warm slide of Steve’s fingers and he has no idea how he’s even still hard, his mind buzzing with loss and heartbreak.
“Don’t drink. Not tonight. You’re upset. You’re going to do something you regret, again.” Tony’s head shoots up, startled and he meets Pepper’s even, telling gaze. “You really think I don’t know? Come on, Tony. It was obvious. I thought maybe you were just getting him out of your system at the Tower. One last hurrah. But it’s never going to end for you if the two of you keep doing this.”
And Steve, telling Barnes he could do it. That this is what they’ve been working towards. That Steve will be right there to help him through it and didn’t he know that he could do anything he set his mind to with a little help from his good old pal.
He reaches down to fist himself roughly, fucking hard and fast back onto Steve’s cock and forward into the tight ring of his hand. Steve slides a hand up his belly and over his chest soft and loving, in stark contrast to the way he’s taking him.
Pepper clenches up again, and Anita gives them a nod that steals Tony’s breath away. From one moment to the next, there’s a baby in her arms. It’s not nearly as magical as Steve’s been led to believe, but it’s real and she’s theirs, so it’s enough. When Anita settles her on Pepper’s chest, crying with healthy, heaving sobs, Steve immediately curls the blanket around them, a hand over Pepper’s, over Tony’s.
Pepper’s eyes search his for a moment but there’s no judgement there. “It’s not pathetic. The things that comfort us when we’re hurting aren’t pathetic.” She pauses to give him a sad smile, and rests her fingertips feather-light on his wrist. “No more pathetic than sleeping in the hallway outside your ex-husband's hospital room for a week.”
Steve breathes in Tony’s air until it almost feels like they could be one person, homeostatic. Whole.
Which was how Steve found himself surrounded by his partners, the new spider kid he adored, Clint, Nat, Vision and Wanda, celebrating DUM-E’s thirtieth turn around the sun.
He wants Tony to fuck the living daylights out of him, hold him down and take whatever he wants by way of penance then wrap his arms around him and never let Steve go.
This is the closest Steve’s come to broaching the subject again, and Tony feels the familiar rush of endorphins that makes him want to head for the hills. It starts with a twist in his belly, his heart rate kicking up, an extra mouthful of saliva to swallow around before he speaks. He spends every waking moment thinking about what this is, what this means, what it could mean, but when it comes down to it, the words stay trapped behind the jail-cell bars of his molars.
A hand comes up to clasp the back of his neck maybe to calm him or to keep him in place, he’s not sure, but it settles there as a steady, unsettling pressure.
Tony’s head jerks up to something off the recording, and Steve watches, ripe with sadness, when Tony’s face brightens into a smile. A cup of coffee appears in Tony’s outstretched hand, and Steve sees himself step into focus with arms already reaching to wrap around Tony’s waist and tug him out of the chair, reeling him in.
It’s not a slight against him, but Tony feels the resentment twist sharp in his belly all the same. The bitter thing that lives inside of Tony thinks maybe Steve deserves to be alone. Alone with only himself and his pride.
This thing with Tony has never shattered, and he’s earned this. Every time Steve had wanted to run, every time he thought he’d have to go at it alone, Tony had proved him wrong, and in turn, Steve had earned his trust.
“I’m fine.” His fingers don’t respond properly when he tries to curl them around Tony’s, twitching uselessly at his sides. Everything aches. He realizes he can’t see out of one of his eyes.
“Steve.” He jerks up, and Tony is smiling at him. The doctors are waiting to push the IV, and there’s a respirator mask in the hands of the nurse nearest his head. “You remember what I told you, right? It’ll be fine because we’re together. You made it, and I’m going to be fine.”
Tony holds his gaze for a beat, then looks away, face buried back into his tablet. He’s talking, a stream of speculation on what the spider kid is using to swing from the rooftop but Steve stops trying to follow.
“You do that, you know. Call me Cap. When you’re trying to push me away. I think maybe it makes it easier for you, as if you can separate all the things you hate about me and shove them under the umbrella of Captain America. As if you don’t have to face me, Steve Rogers, when you’re hurting. When I’ve hurt you.”
The door opens a crack, a barely there movement in the back of his mind and Tony gathers the strength to peek through.
Tony glances at the shop owner, and Steve follows his eyes after a beat, feeling like he was pushing his way through molasses, sluggish and uncertain. What had just happened? What was
He’s cornered him and stepped into his space and flat out refused to listen every time Tony’s given him a warning to back off. In fact, he can’t think of a single moment where Steve has stopped himself solely for the sake of respecting Tony’s wishes.
“I can’t,” Steve’s voice is thick and pitched low with desire, but there’s reluctance there that slows Tony just for a second, “not like last time. Tony, not like last time.”
The world narrows into Tony’s endless eyes and exploring fingers, a heat that sucks him in and wills him to stay. Nothing else matters.
Jerking his head up, Steve realizes that Tony’s pushed up onto his hands and knees, giving him a concerned look over his shoulder. He shakes his head, trying to get himself under control, but the tears burn into full drops. Steve licks his lips, trying to generate enough saliva to swallow down how much he loves this beautiful, unbelievable man.
Where he’s shown Steve the crisscross of white scars on his heart, Howard tearing him into little pieces, or worse, his mother. Beautiful and priceless, something Howard shattered onto the floor just to watch her break. Then had the gall to kick her for crying.
“Fuck off.” Or sometimes he’ll mix it up. “Fuck you.” Or “Fuck this.” It never gets any further because Steve doesn’t pursue him very hard, and Tony’s gotten pretty good at slipping away just before the drills start wrapping up.
“Weirder than normal, though. Haven’t you noticed how he’s always running off? I feel like we’ve barely spent five minutes with him all week.”
FRIDAY turns the lights on soft, and low, and Steve sinks down onto one of the couches, letting Tony settle himself in whatever way is easiest. Everything is screaming at him to curl up in Steve’s lap, drape himself across him and never let him go, but it’s not quite right. Not yet.
Steve curled his fingers back around his cock, tugging it roughly from stem to tip and letting his thumb drag over the tip. The blankets were pushed back in a creased puddle over his thighs and he hardly noticed the chill. It was hard to feel cold when Tony’s eyes were on him, heating him wherever Tony’s gaze landed. He thrust up hard into his fist and the pleasure built. Steve could almost taste Tony, what he imagined would be coffee and blueberries, and smell the familiar scent of motor oil on his skin.
“You’re people, huh?” Tony rubs a hand across his jaw and gives the kid a smile that doesn’t feel as genuine as it could be. “Thanks. But you really don’t need to worry. I’m fine. Let’s watch the movie, that’s what you wanted, right?”
It’s light and teasing, but there’s so much more than that and they both know it. That’s not why Tony is here at all. Tony has always been home. It doesn’t take a lot of thought to know that this makes sense.
Steve plastered a grin on his face as he’d slurped down something cold, disgusting, and slippery; not unlike he’d have expected a massive booger to taste like. When Tony told him it was an aphrodisiac, taking in Steve’s blank look and requesting for JARVIS to provide a definition, the rest of the team cackled and rolled their eyes.
The metaphor wasn’t entirely wrong, Bucky remembering the bigger moments, the things that really mattered, while everything else slid through and disappeared. The first few months after the programming had been removed had been the worst, Bucky forgetting large pockets of time.
“He’s fucking with you, Viz.” Sam puts in, and the smile slips away. That’s probably what JARVIS’ disapproval would have looked like if brought to life. If JARVIS had a face.
A single finger draws a light line from the dip of his lower back, halfway up his spine and back down again. Over and over, soothing and calm.
Clint just shrugged. “Since he’s under the impression that “retirement” is a long weekend and few extra weeks holiday in a year, I’ll be taking the Quinjet wherever I damn well please.”
Risky though, giving a man in pain for a decade refuge in opiates. Pepper should know better, the countless times she’s had to pry bottles from his hands.
Bucky disintegrates before Steve can get to him, collapsing into a pile of ash on the jungle floor. Steve’s shock is more oppressive than the sweltering heat, heavy in his veins and impossible to breathe through. He scratches at the ground, searching through the trees as if Bucky hasn’t just disappeared from the planet.
He’s like a trapped wildcat in Steve’s arms, twisting in his grip and spitting mad. There are little streaks of fire in his eyes. The hurt is thick and palpable.
“There he is!” Tony sneers, rounding on him so he’s in his space now. “You’ve said all the right things. Everything I wanted to hear. But I’m having a really hard time believing it because I realized something. You’ve never once listened to me since we got back. You’ve pushed and pushed. How does that fit into your whole trust and respect line, Steve?”
Tony’s resolve wavers, and he narrows his eyes. “That’s not what this is about. Stop twisting my words. Yes, Ultron and Lagos were both ultimate fuck ups, but this isn’t about
“It’s not about that either.” Tony will never deny that he loves him. Steve’s the kind of man you love across a lifetime. The type of man that lives underneath your skin even when he’s gone, even when he’s holed up in Wakanda with the man that killed your parents.
“I thought I’d lost you.” Steve’s voice is a hot whisper against the hospital gown, bleeding through to swipe at his skin. “All this time. All this time, Tony, I’ve been making it work. At least I knew you were out there. That you were okay. But this—” Steve’s voice cracks with a choked sob and he balls his hands into fists in whatever part of cloth he can reach.
“You were having a nightmare!” Steve cried, gesturing wildly to the space between them, the wet sheets and the tips of Tony’s bare toes. “I couldn’t wake you.”
“I hope you know that this is only the beginning.” Steve sniffles. “There will be a lot of manly tears if we’re going to sort this out. No more avoiding.”
It doesn’t take much, just a hand in Steve’s hair and the almost-black depth of his eyes peering up at Tony around his cock in Steve’s mouth paired with the persistent drag of his tongue and Tony is coming in seconds. The air is punched out of his lungs, and his body curls upward with a desperate whine and a flurry of
“We should have tried harder. I should have tried harder, Tony. I know that. Maybe we should have talked to someone. A therapist? Sam’s said that could’ve helped, but I kept thinking about how you said you didn’t like therapists, that they don't work for you.” Steve exhales and closes his eyes. When he opens them, his breath has settled over Tony, hot with blame and Steve gives him a sad, resigned smile. “I would have tried therapy for you, if you’d let me.”
This time, it’s not Tony who turns the kiss filthy. Steve kisses him like he’s the lifeline securing him to the present, all desperate tongue and teeth and the eventual press of a half-hard erection into his hip when he scoots closer.
Rhodey grunts and gives the ceiling an exasperated look, before pinning Tony with a harsh eye, “I’m just saying that it’s obvious you still love the guy, so maybe it’s worth a conversation before you call it quits. I’m not singing Rogers’ praises here, but I do want you—my friend, my brother—to be happy. And happiness has never come easily to you.”
“Never took you for a coward, Tony,” Steve calls after him as he’s darting down the hallway and wow, that’s rich. That’s just excellent.
Now, Steve shucks his clothes slowly. His arms feel like dead weight, going through the motions to pull his shirt over his head and unbutton his jeans. He makes his way over to the solitary dresser against the far wall and digs around in his sock drawer until his fingers touch metal. Even in the time he was away, Tony had never moved it and now, Steve cherishes the old arc reactor like a precious gift. Sometime soon he’ll need to find a better hiding place for this.
“Just tell me I’m right, Steve. Tell me I’m right and I’ll help you. Give it up. You miscalculated. You’re flawed. Breakable.
Tony’s almost forgotten. The pressure to announce the New Avengers has been high and with a great deal of reluctance, Tony had eventually given over and agreed. A benefit, to both introduce the new members of the team and present the expansion of the Maria Stark Foundation relief efforts on a global scale.
The music cuts off abruptly when Steve pushes the door open and Tony turns, eyes lighting up as a broad grin spreads across his face. “You’re really putting the ‘old’ in old man these days, aren’t you, Cap?”
“Fuck!” Tony reaches down to wrap his hand around his cock as he spurts off against the skyline, Steve chasing his release deep inside him with a broken moan that might’ve been Tony’s name. Pleasure ripples through him in waves as his body clenches and releases around the slick glide of Steve’s cock, pumping fresh layers of warmth and wet inside him.
It’s a long while before Tony’s breathing settles enough that Steve thinks he must be back to sleep. Tony’s nightmare lies between them, a heavy weight on the mattress, stealing Steve’s calm.
He breezes out, leaving Tony alone in the middle of the massive circular room, chairs askew and quiet as the dead. The ache in his chest flares with heat and radiates down his arm. Numbness follows, prickling quickly along the tips of his fingers and bile rises in the back of his throat. There’s a very, very good chance he’s going to be sick.
a better man. He’s damn lucky, and if you can’t do this, that’s okay. But it’s not you who should be standing here wondering if you’re going to be living up to expectations.”
The days bleed together, and he sits there with Bucky’s ghost. The silence is maddening so he draws, or tries to, anyway. Sometimes he draws the horizon or finds himself sketching Bucky glaring and making rude gestures as if he were flipping off a camera. Sometimes Steve just sits there and stares at the photograph, wondering how they only got such a short time to be happy.
“Nope, let’s not. I do not want to hear it.” Clint interrupted, coming back into the communal living room, flanked by Natasha. He quickly filled two thermoses with coffee, black for Nat and a touch of milk for his, as she pulled on her jacket.
He snaps the phone shut and ignores the vibrations that follow, letting them drown in the back of his nightstand. It’s not that he doesn’t feel the same–of course he does. That’s the entire problem; as much as he wants to get past this, move on, accept the fact that for whatever reason he wasn’t
Bucky had become somewhat of the designated laundress for the Avengers after losing the last prank battle to Clint. There was only a week left on his debt, and Tony couldn’t be more right, Steve having been the primary victim when Bucky hadn’t understood the concept of the dryer.
“He says the mission has been compromised, and you are to report to the common living room immediately.”
Pepper is quiet for a brief moment, giving him a calculated look before her gaze flickers over to the pile of letters. There’s no way she doesn’t know, because most are marked in the top left corner, sharp handwriting spelling out the return address of
Tony was an excellent teacher and Bucky took to them both like a star pupil. It had been a little scary, and a lot new. It had been perfect. Not immediately, but with time and proper care, it had become something Bucky could have never anticipated.
“Let me go! Damn it, let me go!” He fought, thrashed against the grip that held him fast with as much strength as a day-old kitten, prepared to bite his way free if he had to.
The small crowd of their extended family and friends fades into the background, and Steve slides the matching band onto Tony’s finger.
“It’s Bucky,” Steve says, looking him right in the eye. He doesn’t waver or mince his words. He hands it over to Tony and after, he holds his breath, waiting for the fallout. “The Winter Soldier is Bucky, and I have to find him.”
“Sam’s been struggling with the drop drills, and it’s pretty obvious why. We’ve talked about it, but it doesn’t seem to be enough. I was wondering what you thought about letting him run through B.A.R.F.?”
Tony chokes on a breath. “And you didn’t think to alert us sooner? I swear to God, JARVIS, I’m going to strip you down for parts and give your consciousness to DUM-E, don’t think I won’t—”
“I know.” Something dislodges in Steve’s chest. A blossom of hope unfurls, and it’s a dangerous thing. Steve’s learned by now not to hope, but just like that first time Tony gasped his way back to life on the New York pavement, Steve’s universe resets and he’s back at the beginning again. “I love you, Tony. It’s fine.”
Tony shakes his head. “It’s nothing. Probably nothing. I don’t think I ever told you what Wanda showed me, but back when she scrambled my brains, she showed me a vision of something coming. Like the Chitauri but worse. I saw it again, but it felt like a warning. It feels like something bigger is still out there.”
“You were a sucker.” Tony muttered. “I just happened to be the first ‘mega that scented you after you’d defrosted. It could have just as easily have been Clint. Just picture it, Cap. Imagine where you two could be today.”
“Of course, sir. Thank you, sir.” The shop owner’s head bobs up and down as he rushes over with a bag full of hot-pressed sandwiches, more than one man could ever eat, including Steve, and sets them on the table when Tony doesn’t immediately reach for them.
Tony tugs his shirt over his head, reaching between them to get a firm grip on Steve’s cock and stroke him through his sleep pants. Their fingers tangle together as Steve tries to help him push them off, and then they’re laughing between kisses that smear and slide against each other.
God, he wants to take him upstairs and spend the rest of the night taking him apart. It would be all too easy to strip them both down to their frames and start again.
If they make divorce cakes, they’d be like wedding cakes. High, proud tiers except sporting two cracked figurines lying face down on black, salty icing.
When he thinks about it later, it makes far more sense. It’s not until he’s crawling into bed that night that Tony realizes that under all that ease and laughter and happiness, he’s missing Steve.
Over Pepper’s shoulder, Peter is shaking a dozen hands under Sam’s proud gaze without a shred of nervousness. He’s all eagerness and the humble ‘oh shucks’ of youth and Tony adores him for it.
Tony throws his hands up in front of him and lets them fall with a slap against his thighs. “I was just trying to be respectful!”
When Steve finally comes, he sobs again, a guttural broken sound that triggers Tony’s own release. It’s not even so much as a catharsis, Tony’s only left feeling gutted. Empty and numb, so deeply numb that Steve’s fingers on his hips lose their sensation and Tony floats away, up, up, up and above them, watching from a distance as they come down together when Steve gently pries him back and settles Tony onto his back next to him.
Bucky presented just under a year later and Steve had thought maybe Mother Nature had gotten it wrong, yet again. It wouldn’t have been enough for her to bless him with a small, frail build; all long limbs and sharp edges that screamed Omega, and a scent gland that barely functioned after years of illness.
His horrified, snow-white face with its wide, betrayed eyes. Every inch of Steve’s body went cold, the release reduced to a distant memory.
“I love you too, Tony. More than you know. Thank God you’re still here.” Pepper hesitates when she turns away, closing the space between them again to kiss his face one more time, as if he might slip away before she gets back. He tries to reassure her with a light smile, letting the fingers on his good hand brush the inside of her wrist.
He’d hoped that he would have more time. Not that he’d done a particularly good job at hiding this. If anything, he’d expected his partners to figure it out sooner.
“This is a little fucked up, even for you, Stark.” Tony shakes his head, burying his face in his hands and sliding the tips of his fingers into his hairline with a groan. “He’s not going to be happy about this.”
Steve had marched straight into Tony’s workshop at the Compound, spun him around to plant his hands between flowing rivers of wire and tugged his pants down, savouring the way Tony panted out his name while he gasped into the unforgiving metal worktable.
When he eyes the glasses on the floor between them, Bucky clocks his gaze and snatches them off the floor. The plastic whines in his fist.
Tony relaxed against Steve, opening his mouth and deepening the kiss. Bucky’s hand curled over Tony’s own on his chest, anchoring him.
“Honey.” Steve looks up with watery eyes, and Tony swims in his vision. He gets up from his chair and crosses the few steps between them, settling in Steve’s lap with his knees on either side. “Take a breath.”
A hint of teeth scraped against his sensitive rim leaving him gasping and shoving at Bucky’s shoulder. Tony was rambling, repeating his name and rattling closer and closer to begging him to just move, get inside him. Give him something more.
Peter darts across the ceiling, and Steve calculates his next move but he gives himself away, eyes dart left as he feigns right. Steve makes a note to address the way he tracks his movements at their next individual session, but now, he uses it to his advantage, picking up the pace over the warning Wanda is calling from across the room. Just as Peter turns, just as he launches himself out of Steve’s path, Steve lets the shield fly.
With a science Steve will never understand, he blinks and they’re in the elevator. The door slides open, and Steve gasps.
What should he care if Barton didn’t think he was making an effort? Maybe Tony could rig one of his arrows to blow up in his face later. Oops, sorry Hawkeye, complete error. Must’ve been a miscalculation.
When Tony’s grip slipped down to his hips and yanked, thrusting up against the hollow where Steve’s hip met his groin, his brain effectively powered down. He broke the kiss on a gasp which did nothing to stop Tony’s mouth from where it traded off and started pressing hot, wet kisses along his jaw. The kisses travelled lower still, down his throat, almost to his clavicle.
“Maybe not, but we could move on? I don’t know what’s happened between you and Steve–don’t give me that look, he hasn’t said anything. Not to any of us, except maybe Barnes. I know that he… meant something to you once.”
It flared hot in his stomach when Tony was bent over his arm, performing routine tests as he made his way through the third model, he’d created for him. That smell surrounding him, drawing him in like a ship in the night.
Just as he’s making eye contact with the driver, opening his mouth to give directions to the airport—because he’ll be damned if he spends one more minute in the same city as Steve—a shout from behind him cuts him short.
The morning bled away into midafternoon and Steve left Bucky to his workout, losing himself in the comfort of his sketch. As colour flowed between the sharp black lines, Steve smiled and finished his work with a neat signature across the bottom right corner.
Tony grins at him, knowing and just the slightest little bit smug. “Yeah, that’s what I thought. Hold on, big guy.”
It doesn’t do any damage, not even a dent or a scratch on the design, and it certainly doesn’t hurt. But in a hot second, he’s back in Siberia, gasping for breath and bleeding onto cold cement.
“Indeed,” J.A.R.V.I.S. says. “If I may interject, Captain. Sir appears to be at risk of interrogation by Ms. Romanoff. I’d suggest you hurry.”
DUM-E gives him a questioning whirr from the corner, and holds up the fire extinguisher which does neither of them any good. Tony brushes him off and the bot rattles off to the corner to lay in wait for an inevitable fire.
After all these years of drifting between places he never belonged, Steve will say whatever he wants. It’s been a lifetime of fulfilling mission after mission, one task to the next and living for the adrenaline and the purpose of Captain America.
A chill slides down the back of his spine and the edges of Tony’s vision blurs white. “You think what we had meant
Steve groans into Tony’s open mouth and sinks his teeth into his bottom lip, pulling it into his own to suck before he dives in further, all but fucking his tongue into Tony’s mouth and that’s it. That’s the way. There’s the Steve Rogers who wants to possess him, consume him. Steve kisses him deep enough to make his toes curl and pleasure race along the length of his body and back again, layering on thick streams of desire that leave him gasping.
The day they’d finally made up, Bucky had locked himself in his apartment, drowning in a smell not unlike a thin coffee, sweetened with hot cocoa that Steve used to make them in the biting Brooklyn winters. It wasn’t like anything he’d ever experienced before, and he’d fisted himself roughly and often, picturing them together. Picturing himself with each of them. Between them.
So, on that first night, Steve held Tony close, curled around him as much as he could and listened as his breathing lengthened and Tony drifted off into a peaceful sleep. Hours passed and Steve ran his hand up and down the length of Tony’s back until his fingers were numb, ignoring his growing arousal until his cock was heavy and weeping with anticipation.
“Always together.” Steve says, ignoring the way that Pepper presses closer and leans her head against his shoulder. As the mask settles over his mouth, Steve brings his hand up and presses it softly against the glass
“While you’re here, Stark, maybe you could actually give this a once over for me?” Bucky’s voice is even and steady but there’s a hint of hesitation behind his cloudy eyes.
Steve preps him slowly, kissing Tony in thorough, all-consuming kisses until he’s grinding down on three fingers and scratching Steve’s chest begging him for something more. Steve’s eyes meet his, an endless sea of blue and Tony reaches between them to slide down onto his length, watching as his eyelids flutter and try to stay focused.
Whenever he opens his mouth to speak, Tony kisses his harder. Silencing him with deep sweeps of his tongue because he doesn’t want to hear it. Not yet.
“I love you. Oh fuck, Tony, I love you.” Steve is murmuring in his ear. It sounds like a lie. Steve doesn’t know what he’s done.
“Your divorce judgement is ready.” Pepper doesn’t beat around the bush when it matters, and he’s grateful for that, but it doesn’t stop Tony from closing his eyes and pressing his fingertips into his eyelids until explosions of colour appear.
“No,” Tony says, at the same time Steve starts with, “Not really sure how much there is to explain.”
The doors open and once they're in a private space, the walls come down and Tony turns to Steve with a tentative, curious look. “Would you want that?”
Surely Tony could understand that what had happened, as awful as it was, hadn’t been anything more than Steve trying to keep both Bucky and Tony alive while simultaneously putting an end to the fighting as quickly as he knew how.
It was easy to lose himself in preparing Tony, taking painstaking care with every curl of his fingers, using this special time to press quiet reminders of how much Steve loved him directly into Tony’s body. It was as much an apology as a silent urge to wake from the nightmares. Steve made due with what he could to chase the bad dreams away.
“Hang on!” Tony’s voice may be clipped and modulated but even behind the mask Steve can tell that he’s grinning. One gauntlet wraps around his wrist and Steve instinctively grabs on with the other, and then they’re rocketing into the sky.
Just as streaks blurred across his vision and his sight narrowed into a tunnel that threatened to close, the suit breached the surface, rocketing into the air and flashing across the sky. Water drained from the suit as JARVIS activated the emergency released and Tony gulped in air, sputtering and gagging around the salty water as he vomited into the inside of the suit.
Bucky’s words stay with him, torturing him in a completely different way. This terrifying man who doesn’t know Tony from Adam and has no reason to have his back, has had it anyways. Twice now, not that he’s counting.
Steve steps into his space. Just one step more and they’d be touching and Tony is torn between whether he should feel hot and bothered or icy fear. His body and brain are at war, rational thought disappearing with the waves of heat radiating from Steve’s body.
A chill washes down Tony’s spine and he resists the urge to shiver, walking over to the window as he tugs his shirt on over his head. The skyline is alive and vibrant with the sprinkle of lights from the other high rises and Tony searches the horizon. The
“Bedroom. Side table.” The words are a rasp he can barely make out, and they slur across his tongue. There’s a new haze forming at the edges of his awareness and Tony wonders if maybe they’re giving him painkillers. God knows, he deserves them now.
He’s been a fool. Tony’s been an absolute fool because people never really change. Steve’s fed him just the right amount of bullshit, handed it over on a silver platter with one hand while the other weaves tricks and lies behind his back.
“Can I ask one question?” Steve blurted, before he could stop himself. His brain was rebooting only as fast as possible while Tony was still touching him. “Why wagon wheels – no, don’t look at me like that I’m not teasing you – I’m genuinely asking because I’m curious.”
“Well, believe it. No harm, no foul, this time around, right? We gave it a good run. Just not in the cards. Nobody’s fault.”
“I know the feeling.” Tony shifts uncomfortably on the bed, nervousness dampening the back of his neck with a line of sweat.
“Tony! Chill out, man!” Rhodey steps between them and adds, quieter, “come on, Tones, don’t do this now.”
Bucky’s mouth had been frantic on his tongue stroking deep between the seam of his lips as his hands worked at the button on his trousers, suspenders shoved aside over his thin shoulders.
“So anyways,” Peter cut back in. “If you happen to find them, can you let me know? They’re kind of my favourite.”
It’s such a terrible cliché, clinging to Steve after he’s knocked on death’s door and managed to walk away some semblance of intact. That he’s survived the end of the world and still finds himself face to face with the ruins of his relationship with his husband. Ex-husband. Not that it matters.
To no one’s surprise, Steve is quicker than that ducking his head in time with Tony’s movements. He forces Tony to meet his eye. “When I said that I loved you.”
Then Steve collapses in a heap, his last brain cell working to keep his weight off Tony’s decidedly smaller frame and as he presses their lips together, little more than a smear of lips, Tony whispers a babble of praise in his ears.
Tony’d near forgotten how good it could be, not letting himself think about it as he worked his way back to Steve slowly, carefully. But all three of them… the potential for all that pleasure left Tony’s mouth watering.
The soft lines around Tony’s eyes deepen like creases on a well-loved paperback, and Tony brushes his fingers through Steve’s hair, searching his eyes with an almost patient disbelief. “I love you, too. That’s why I married you, sweet pea.”
“Hi, buddy.” Steve really is going to cry now. He wraps both arms around DUM-E’s struts and hugs him, leaning all his weight on the bot as the whirring gets louder. DUM-E vibrates in his eagerness, the pulses reverberating through Steve’s body in little quakes. “I missed you.”
Tony narrows his eyes, crosses his arms across his chest, and steels himself for whatever’s coming next. It’s only a few beats too late that he realizes he’s doing all the things he hates seeing in Steve when he’s angry, and he tries to shake out his posture as best he can.
“When Fury said we’d have indiscriminate access to the Quinjet, I’m not sure if this is what he meant.”
“You said it was nothing,” Tony interrupts. The anger rises up in him, and Steve can see it behind his hard eyes. There’s fear there, so much fear, but Tony does a good job at holding it at bay. “I asked you if you needed me to come and you told me it was nothing.”
“I’m going to get fat if we keep eating like this.” Tony groaned, immediately throwing up a warning hand when Clint smirked. “Don’t go there, asshole.”
A sob bubbles up and escapes even though the physical restraint Steve is using to hold it back looks impressive.
Actually, it’s worse than that, because the explosion of guilt across his features implies that Steve is currently thinking about how
“Tell him I’ll stay in Wakanda.” Bucky had said gruffly. “Go back on your own and work things out with your O.”
Bucky grunted softly, surprised but not enough to shove Tony away. When he opened his mouth, letting Tony’s tongue slip between his teeth he heard Steve gasp behind him and he yanked back, eyes wide with alarm. What the fuck was he thinking?
Tony tugs his shirt over his head, tossing it to the side with his own before he’s reaching down and working on the clasp of Steve’s belt and the button on his jeans. It’s like no time at all has passed, and Steve is exactly the same as he remembers. He’s all subtle, musky male, firm with thick muscles that Tony wants to bite and scratch. Just leave a few marks as a reminder that Steve is still Tony’s.
“We’ve been putting it off for months, Steve, waiting to see if this stuck. If it was going to work. I could be wrong here – I’m not – but I’m pretty sure there’s nothing better out there. This is it for me. Clearly,” He said with chagrin, gesturing towards the mountain of softness he’d compiled just for them. “This is all I want. And nests are about two things, right?”
Morgan giggles and shoves a piece into her mouth, considering the rest thoughtfully. “Here, Daddy,” Morgan says, offering up a piece to Tony.
Bucky gave him a doubtful look, but it parted and cleared, sun coming through the clouds as Bucky nudged him back down, bracketing him in with his elbows and folding Tony in half.
Something tugs at his mind, and it’s not fully formed through when Tony gives him a little thumbs up and whispers, “Together, right?”
Steve wanting him in this incredible, all-consuming way was like someone had flipped a switch he hadn’t even realized he’d had.
Tony had met them in the middle, pointing out that perhaps Bucky didn’t need to be taken apart again. There was no reason to strip him down to the base and build him back from the ground up. He was just… this person now. The charming, innocent flirt from Brooklyn was gone, and years of the hardness of life as the Winter Soldier had left a mark.
“Did you even mean what you said before? Honestly, Steve? Because you had a lot to say about trust and respect and all the things that you did wrong but you don’t actually act that way. No, you haven’t acted that way, not since you got back.”
When he drags his nails down Steve’s chest, it’s obvious that he feels the same because his mouth falls away from Tony’s to suck brutal hickeys into the curve of his throat. Teeth rasp against the muscle there, and Tony bites out a moan, shoving his hand into Steve’s boxers at the same time Steve reaches to paw at Tony’s sweats.
“Steven, I don’t think—” Steve knocks aside the hand Thor is trying to lay across his shoulder and pushes past him. He barks out an order to JARVIS to take him down to the workshop where he punches in his override code and seals the place down. Full blackout.
“And you can come with me,” Tony says, slipping an arm around Steve’s waist and steering him towards the elevators. On the ride up to the penthouse, Tony is silent, one gauntleted hand tracing a circle on his back.
The scene Steve is seeing in front of him is one that shocks Tony to his core, because at first it doesn’t look like anything traumatic or disturbing. It’s just their bed, Tony lying on his stomach with his bare back visible above the blanket where it’s settled across his waist. Steve is naked and propped against the headboard, an arm pillowed behind his head with his face turned up to the ceiling, eyes closed and thick lashes fanning across his cheeks.
Breathing through it, Tony forces himself to glance down at where Steve’s hand is carefully curved around his ribcage, thumb rubbing a gentle circle over his nipple. The drops of wetness on his skin are nothing more than sweat from Steve’s brow, dripping as he shoves into him.
“This—this is what you wanted, right? Is this—” Tony frowns at him. “Yeah, I might need just a little talking. Help me out, is this what you want?”
“I wasn’t obsessed with him. And his name was Thomas.” Steve’s got a small, wistful smile on his face that hints at a Brooklyn summer afternoon.
“It appears that the sequencing is skipping too quickly and the program is getting stuck in a feedback loop.”
Steve reads the line again. Has it really been almost a year? There’s a memorial raising in San Francisco next month.
“Bucky, now. Stop teasing. Fucking mate me, alpha. Come on.” Tony prodded him sharply in the ribs with a foot and Bucky growled at him, a challenge.
“Seriously, nothing?” Tony scoffs, and gives him a pitiful look, shaking his head as his lips press into a grim line. “I thought we had just established that Steve Rogers can choose whether or not he’s going to be a coward.”
Sam plummets to the ground under Steve’s weight, his wings digging into Steve’s shins as he struggles to stay balanced before Steve rips the shield from his hands and rolls back down onto the mats. Sam wobbles in the air, trying to stay upright.
“Jesus fucking Christ.” Tony stumbles backward, ungraceful and a flurry of limbs as Steve reaches out a hand to steady him.
him, to remind Tony of all the reasons they loved each other and put the horrendous events from Siberia behind them for good.
Steve doesn’t even have the audacity to make it a question, saying it so quietly he wouldn’t be surprised if no one else realizes it was an order.
It could be any number of things off with Tony, really. Most obviously that if Tony was going into heat, which was fewer and farther between these days, Clint’s teasing had struck a chord and he was wrapped up in his mind over Bucky’s comments from before.
There’s only pleasure, rippling along his every nerve ending, curling his toes and pulsing thick from his cock. He barely registers Steve groaning into his mouth, breaking the kiss to press their foreheads together as he spills over them both, streaking over Tony’s design on their stomachs, and Steve’s huge hand.
Tony’s going to stop this. He will, it’s just been so long and kissing Steve is like tasting sunshine, warming him from the inside out. He’s going to stop any minute now. Their divorce certificates are sitting a stone-throw away and here Tony is prepared to fuck his husband—ex-husband—all over again as if nothing’s happened.
Steve claimed him, just like the very first time, fucking hard into him and marking Tony as his. His to love, to protect, even if it meant protecting him from the demons that roamed in his own dreamscape, Steve would be whatever he needed.
“Steve.” Tony tugs the blanket up higher before he brushes fingers along Steve’s jaw. “I thought you knew.” As Tony shifts to sit up against the headboard, Steve resists the urge to crawl after him. One more minute, he thinks, just one more. He closes his eyes and Tony says, “Steve, I… This—you died. Sometime in the night. I thought you knew. I don’t know why but I thought you already knew.”
Tony’s heavy eyes flicker closed and he forces them back open. By the time he can fix his gaze on the door, Pepper is already gone.
He dropped down to straddle Bucky’s hips; Steve chuckling next to them and already reaching out for them, as he if couldn’t keep his hands off them.
Steve laughs, brushing a hand through his sweaty hair with a little half shrug. “Well, when the mood strikes, it strikes.”
“Oh, I don’t know Tony, anything at this point? The man is still your husband,” Rhodey points out, cocking one eyebrow and nodding in the direction of his left hand. The pale circle left behind on his skin glares up at him as obvious as the vibranium wedding band once had.
Steve sputters a wet laugh and wraps his arms around her, breathing in the smell of a perfume he’s almost forgotten. “I missed you.”
Steve isn’t quite sure he’d want everyone to watch, even if he can appreciate how possessiveness turns into searing arousal when his teammates take in the bruises he leaves at Tony’s wrists or scattered across his throat. But it doesn’t hurt, playing into Tony’s secret desires with the fight all but over, and an endless stretch of time before them to settle up on said promises later.
The movie opens and Peter, with his bright, eager eyes, is sucked in immediately. Tony’s mind is lost somewhere in a galaxy far, far away and clear as day he can hear Howard’s voice in his head, barking orders, brushing aside his mother, berating them both.
He doesn’t get into it right away. It still feels rude, disrespectful even though they’ve done this before, and with a raspy voice, Tony has thanked him after. Praised him, even.
For a moment, Steve wants to lose himself in the comfort of Tony stroking through the strands, soothing him the way his mother might have when Steve was a child. But he opens his eyes and looks up into Tony’s concerned face.
The floodgate opens and Tony’s hands are vicious on his skin, gripping and pulling at his clothing as he manhandles Steve over towards the desk. He palms Steve’s tiny ass with both hands before he reaches down and hoists him up onto the desk by his thighs. Steve gasps again, right into Tony’s mouth, clutching at his jaw and the ragged remnants of his goatee, lost in day’s worth of stubble.
, twisting and tugging at the little strands to hold Steve’s focus and guide his face wherever Tony might need it. How is it that he can feel that if Tony is lying in a morgue somewhere? Wherever they’ve taken him.
If the floor had opened up and called him down to Hell he would have gone willingly. Revulsion and self-loathing churned in his stomach, burning him from the inside out as acid seared at the back of his throat and the weight of his transgressions settled over him.
“You can bring a picture of your favourite goat, and in exchange for your cooperation I’ll take a look at your arm and see if I can make you something new.”
“You do like old things,” Steve agrees, and Tony laughs a little, setting the colourless reactor on his bedside table before shifting deeper into the blankets.
“Tony,” Steve’s eyes are on his, pinning him in place, “let me fix this. Talk to me. What can I do?” If Tony were to close his eyes, he’d be able to feel the ghost of Steve’s fingers tipping his chin up and pressing their lips together.
Tony Stark had breezed into his life before Steve had even known what to expect. Seeping into his pores until Steve’s nightmares had faded away, falling for Tony had been floating in a cup of thick, bitter coffee. One that burned the back of his throat and left Steve’s brain screaming for his next caffeine fix.
“Steve’s the best thing that ever happened to you. And it doesn’t take much to know you’re the best thing that ever happened to him. You think any of us could go through the things you two have gone through and make it out? This doesn’t just happen by accident, Tony.”
“Bucky told me what you did for him. And for Sam.” There’s nothing challenging or threatening in his voice. So why does Tony feel so defensive?
Steve slowly pulls his hand back, looking at it like something ugly and foul. “How can you even stand me touching you right now?”
“This is our daughter.” Tony looks at him, shaking his head and grinning in a way Steve hasn’t seen since their wedding day. “This is our daughter, Steve.”
On the far wall, a picture focuses. It’s blown up, touching from the floor to the ceiling and every inch makes Steve ache. Tony is smiling, salt and pepper hair and soft brown eyes, his arm around Pepper with Morgan standing between them. She has the peace sign held up in a little mimicry of Tony’s signature pose and they look like the proudest parents Steve’s ever seen.
Strange, how a body Steve’s maimed and made bleed still craves being pressed up against him, still finds a way to slot him perfectly back into place. Steve clings to him, presses his face into Tony’s shoulder and weeps.
Tony shrugs, looking down at his hands and picking a bit of dirt out from underneath one of his nails. “Just something you said earlier. That I was
“It’s me, sweetheart, it’s me.” The endearment slips out, unbidden. “I’ve got you, okay? It’s okay. What the fuck were you thinking, you gigantic idiot?”
“Just ask me.” Steve props himself up on one arm, watching uncertainty slash across Tony’s face. “Tony, what?”
Steve had always loved that; the feeling of waking to his prick already hard and leaking inside the heat of Tony’s mouth. And Tony had loved it too, sucking him down while he was still soft, feeling him fill out and harden under his tongue. The trust of it all made him soar.
That one had come in not long after their run-in in the hallway. It’s been sitting there, unopened and unanswered with all the rest, for more than a few hours.
“Or maybe Tony’s nesting drive has finally shown up?” Clint teased, elbowing him in the ribs. “Started settling into that domestic life, tin man? Our very own fuzzy ‘mega magpie?”
The light is too blinding and he has to keep closing his eyes. He’s trying to force the words out but it’s difficult to tell if his mouth is even moving. If he’s dead maybe they won’t hear him anyway, but on the off chance that he’s not, he needs to try.
Finally, Steve’s tears seem to stop and he takes a few tempered breaths. When he pulls back, he doesn’t go far, easing back so that he’s sitting with his legs spread, Tony on his knees between them still, but back on his calves now. Steve looks open and raw and so, so painfully defenceless.
“You’ve been waiting for this for months.” Bucky countered between sweeps of his tongue in Tony’s mouth.
“It’s alright.” The words are destroyed, a rough, sandpaper croak and Tony flinches, looking away. Steve reaches out to fold him into his arms anyway, and this time Tony lets him. “It’s alright. I’m sorry. I love you. It’s alright, sweetheart.”
No, Tony is desperate to stay. He’ll spend the rest of his life in Steve’s arms, in Steve’s bed, in Steve’s life if only Steve will let him. If only Steve stays exactly like this. Imperfect, and admitting it.
Steve frowns. It doesn’t seem like Tony is being intentionally cryptic and his eyes search Steve’s as if he’s looking for answers. If he is, surely Tony must know by now—Steve is all out of answers. He’s been out of answers for years.
Tony brushes back his hair, letting one of his thumbs trace along his lips. “It can be whatever you want.”
But by the time Steve makes it to the makeshift medical tent, it starts to dawn on him that something is more than wrong. Tony is bent over in the suit, kneeling in a half crouch in the concrete, head bowed down with the eyes of the suit blank and colourless. The suit is powered down, but Tony has yet to step out.
“You know,” Tony starts, voice low and non-threatening, his figurative hands held out in front of him laying his cards on the table. “Sometimes you do these things, little things, and it just hits me like a ton of bricks.” Steve glances over his shoulder, eyebrows lifting by a margin. Tony chuckles a humourless laugh. “You and Howard must have gotten along so well, back in the day.”
“It’s nice to see you again, Captain Rogers.” The warm lilt of Tony’s AI brings tears to his eyes and the tinny echo of his voice is so real Steve almost allows himself to question if this is a dream at all. “Welcome home.”
Fucking into Tony like this left Steve lightheaded, everything in his awareness narrowing down to the way that Tony’s ass clenched around his cock and didn’t want to let him go.
With a bright laugh, Tony’s hands skirt around the edge of Steve’s uniform pants but Steve holds him off, making quick work of his t-shirt and pausing to admire the warm glow of the arc reactor in his chest.
He thought maybe Tony’s efforts to have their pardons pushed through had meant something and when the news had broken that the World Security Council was preparing to vote. He had expected to hear from Tony then.
“Tony.” Steve’s fingers drifted along the edge of his shirt, tightening slightly when his face morphs from a splatter of surprise to hopeful shock. “I love you.”
It was the perfect descriptor really, capturing the mixture of devastation and loss, rage and heartbreak that had lived inside him and spread like shrapnel for almost a year. There had been a time once, when he’d thought he was done with shrapnel.
“Oh god. You’re such a sap, Rogers.” The words were soft and a small smirk tugged at the edge of Tony’s mouth.
There aren’t any words to explain how this is the last remaining thing Steve has that doesn’t make him want to lie down and die on that battlefield with Tony. The fight bleeds out of him and he chokes on a fresh sob, crumpling in on himself with his fists pressed to his face. If he were still small, Steve would crawl under the chair and stay there, safe from Bucky’s steady, unwavering gaze and the reality that he can’t do a damned thing about any of this.
“He’s thinking about us! How did you miss that, Rogers? You think he’s just, what, having himself a pretty little murder daydream? Steve! He
He ate with measured bites until all the food was gone, lost in a fugue marked by the sloping grace of Tony’s hands as he prepared them something far better than the pasta the hospital provided. Once upon a time Steve might’ve had that—the soft domesticity of watching Tony at work in their kitchen—coming up behind him and curling his arms around his waist. Opening his mouth and letting Tony sneak tastes between his lips under the thin guise of teasing each other until the meal was finished.
There’s a lingering fear in his eyes, and Steve knows he fully understands the risks. Sometime between Pepper’s surgery and Steve’s recovery, Tony had decided they were worth it, and for some reason, Steve felt confident that it would all be fine. It wasn’t a suspicion, but a definitive certainty that in a few hours, Tony would be on his way home to recover.
So, it wasn’t really Tony’s fault that Peter had seen him, broken and bleeding, barely conscious. He wasn’t even sure what Peter really knew about the whole ordeal, hearing but unable to really process the snippets of information T’Challa had shared with Peter and Rhodey by the time he’d gotten Tony back to base.
It wasn’t that Tony was ashamed, per say, because if he was anyone else this would have been perfectly normal.
When the exchange ends and Steve makes his way back in, he’s pale and drawn, refusing to meet Tony’s eye. They sit in silence, lost in the conversation around them.
From this vantage point, Tony has a new canvas to explore and his hands are on Steve before he can catch his breath. Work-rough palms run over every knob of his spine on their path down to the slight curve of Steve’s ass.
He can’t believe he could have had this all along. That this Tony, the Tony he fell in love with, the only one who evades his dreams and smirks in the shadowy backdrop in the far corner of his mind—this Tony would have had him, even then.
“Yeah, that tastes really good,” Tony gets out. His face is flushed red beneath the lines of his goatee and the streaks of dirt from the battle still smeared across his cheeks.
Bucky fits into the team dynamic with a flawless ease that Steve finds as surprising as it is rewarding. After everything they went through to get him back, watching Bucky roll around on the gym mats with Natasha and move seamlessly through target practice with Clint warms him through. Bucky even manages to win Bruce over, sitting quietly in his lab and listening to Bruce’s gentle musings, eventually drifting off on the couch in the far corner. It’s a platonic reminiscence of Steve in Tony’s lab, and if he had any doubts about Bucky fitting into the family, they’re long gone now.
“Hi, Steve.” Tony sets the gauntlet aside and powers down the tools he’s been working with. Steve jumps when something moves out of the corner of his eye but it’s only DUM-E rolling towards him, whirring with excitement. “Oh, I get it.” Tony points an accusatory finger at DUM-E. “You’re here for him.”
They stumble into one of the hallways of guest suites, more than Tony had ever needed or would ever need, and JARVIS agrees to ensure they aren’t disturbed though there’s a reluctance in his tone that Tony shrugs off.
Steve doesn’t even realize he’s closed his eyes until Tony’s hips stutter and one hand settles on the side of his face.
Tony bursts into surprised laughter behind them, and Steve flicks a glare at him over Bucky’s shoulder. “Really? How did you even manage to tell him that already?”
It’s so predictable it’s almost disappointing, and if Steve can be predictable then maybe Tony can too. Before Steve opens his mouth, Tony leans forward and plucks a glass of champagne off a tray hoisted high by a passing waiter and gives him a thousand-watt smile.
Just out of sight, Tony leans up against the wall, taking a deep breath and begging his subconscious to hold back the oncoming panic attack. He has shame in droves already.
That’s all Steve needs to hear, apparently, because he’s got Tony in his arms, bridal style in a way that Tony should probably hate but he desperately loves anyway. Steve plows his way towards the elevator, setting Tony on his feet just briefly so he can grab him across the back of his thighs and pull him back into his arms, clinging to his waist and his neck.
“He’s a strong guy. I think he can manage it. Plus, it’d give him a chance to let it go. It’s not his fault. It’s not Vision’s fault. Hell, it’s not really even Steve’s fault–yeah, I know, he did a lot of shit, don’t give me that look, man–these things happen in a battle.”
“Bruce is pissed all the time and does a fine job.” Tony takes a look at the point, then misses it on purpose.
Steve grins and forces one of Tony’s thighs back further, chasing after every delicious drag of friction. “Is that a promise?”
“I told you not to fuck with the timelines. You really never listen, do you?” Steve shakes his head with only a sliver of remorse but Tony’s still smiling, tracing idle patterns down Steve’s stomach and back again. “Where did you go?”
Tony stops doubting what he’s seeing and starts living again, revelling in the way that he feels whole even with a missing limb and a prosthetic that still pinches in the evening. Barnes tells him it gets better, or at least he had when Tony had been feeling particularly maudlin and called to complain to a fellow cyborg.
Steve reeled backwards, everything in him trying to reject the weight of what Tony had said. What he meant. What he was
“It meant a lot to Bucky too,” Steve’s face softens when he says the other man’s name, sending a spear of jealousy and white-hot rejection through Tony’s gut.
Natasha’s lips twitch at the corner as she thrusts a phone into Tony’s face but they all turn to Steve as he comes towards them.
God, it’s miraculous to watch Tony stroke off on him, getting off on the way Steve can toss him around like he’s nothing. Steve knows how he loves it like this—the slick drag of him catching at Tony’s rim when he pulls all the way out just to plough back in.
“You’re planning a party?” Steve asked, pushing back from the table and starting to clear away the plates. This newfound friendship with Tony was a relationship he relished most of all.
Tony traces a finger over his collarbone. He looks abruptly uncertain, and Steve frowns slightly, knocking their foreheads together lightly.
You’d think it was the funniest thing that’d ever happened to him with the way Clint cackled until his eyes watered, wiping away the tears that slip free from the corners. Tony just glared and Steve felt immediately awful, really, he did, because this was only ever about making Tony smile.
Tears are dripping onto the sofa. Every muscle in Steve’s body relaxes with the exception of his tight grasp on the bell. The hand on his throat released and circles his chest, pulling him back. Steve gulps in breath after breath.
“You’re right,” Steve interrupts, leaning back in his chair. They’ve been here before and this time Steve knows how he wants to play his hand. There’s no use in convincing Tony that he doesn’t need to be watched, because he’s vulnerable. He’ll dig his heels in further and the fight will explode, maybe at a different time and in a different way, but Steve knows Tony well enough by now.
By the time Steve could get them both to safety, Tony would freeze to death. If he stayed in the suit, he would sink, heavy as a stone, straight to the bottom. Even Steve couldn’t bear the weight of the near five hundred pounds of gold-titanium alloy and Tony along with his own, and the churning sea of ink below them.
“Suit integrity 38%.” Water was gushing into the armour now, bogging them down and slowing the ascent to the surface. The sensation in Tony’s fingers was fading fast and he could feel the thrusters in the boots struggling under their combined weight along with the pressure of the water surrounding them.
Steve had been working on a new sketch of DUM-E since yesterday, the childlike robot chasing after Tony on the page. In his claw, DUM-E held up a fire extinguisher as caricature Tony chased after caricature Bucky, hair sticking up at all angles. The idea had popped into his head last week, after Bucky had flat out refused to look at Tony’s design for the Mark 22 of Bucky’s ever advancing metal arm.
“I, I – no, that’s not what I said. I don’t want – I don’t eat wagon wheels.” Tony spluttered, and Steve watched the faintest hint of red tinging the base of his neck, curving up around his ears.
“Spider-Man started it,” Steve says, jerking a thumb over his shoulder with a smirk when Sam gapes at him.
They haven’t talked about Siberia, or the divorce, or anything of substance and for his part, Tony is too afraid of all the answers to ask any questions now.
Steve glances up, eyes fastening on to Tony’s mouth and a jolt of heat shocks his system, sending Tony halfway to hard, hot and aching in his pants, looking into Steve’s face and reading every thought in his head. He licks his lips and Steve’s eyes follow the movement, but Steve doesn’t move. He hardly breathes.
She’d had him longer, and she’d live on with a part of him forever. She had him in a way that Steve never did, and the resentment breeding in his stomach has spent weeks clawing its way to the surface. Pepper got to have that perfect, beautiful life and Steve can’t find it in himself to acknowledge her loss in the face of his own.
The thought had flabbergasted Steve at first, who had, of course, considered it once or twice. Who would have blamed him? He was only a man, and a man with a clearly well-defined type at that, but he’d never allowed it to go very far. He had Tony now.
“He’s too good for me, Rhodey,” Tony says. “He’s everything that’s good in this world, and how do I live up to that? How can I live up to that for the rest of our lives together?”
He tries to insist on sleeping in another room, where his nightmares can only hurt himself, because he wakes up screaming Tony’s name and admits that he sees Tony snapping and smells the way his flesh was melting from the bone when he’d gotten Tony’s body into his arms and carried him to safety, limp and lifeless.
Everyone gets to see the flashy, over-the-top Tony Stark with his media smiles and luxury clothing. But no one gets to see him like this, stripped down and naked, open and willing. No one gets to hear these sounds or bask in the breathy way that Tony’s tongue wraps around Steve’s name when he’s trembling and begging to come.
He’s not naked now though, neither of them are, stripped down to boxers and undershirts as they slide between cool and unfamiliar sheets. Steve’s eyes grow sadder when they clock the arc reactor, fixed back into place in the centre of Tony’s chest. Steve doesn’t say anything, just shuffles forward, closes his eyes, and leans in slow enough to give Tony a chance to stop him before he presses his forehead against it.
He paces back and forth across the room, watching Tony at Pepper’s head, stroking back the wet hair falling low across her forehead. There’s a beautiful red flush to her skin, and if she wasn’t in intermittent bursts of pain, Steve might have told her this was the most beautiful he’d ever seen her.
He slips a thumb past the rim and tugs, stretching wider so he can fuck Tony on his tongue like he means it.
It’s a nice feeling after his tired eyes have spent so long squinting, trying to fit and force pieces into place. The picture he’s looking at now isn’t even the one he started with, but somehow that feels right.
“Oh, fuck Steve,” Tony inhales a ragged gasp right next to his ear, sending a zing of pleasure straight to Steve’s cock.
Tony prods him with a shoe and he glances up, eyes stormy. It’s hard to say whether those bottomless blue eyes are clearing or preparing for a second downpour. Tony tries to remind himself that he doesn’t care, Steve isn’t his problem anymore.
He is tired. He’s so fucking exhausted. He’s lost in the woods and there’s no way to make it out of this unscathed.
It’s hard to feel bad for him though, Tony still sporting a glossy pink scar across the breadth of his chest.
There are a hundred pleas stirring behind Steve’s eyes, but he doesn’t say anything more. There’s only silence, Steve accepting his lot, bowing his head and relinquishing control as Tony shifts and takes him deeper, rolling his hips and chasing after anything that might feel good in the maze of all this pain.
As Tony broke through the surface, the suit collided with the wall of water and then there was nothing. No sound, the faint glow of lightening fading behind him, and Steve, eyes closed with a stream of unsettling bubbles rushing up towards the Iron Man suit in an underwater cloud. He dropped, heavy as a stone, unconscious.
Steve releases one of Tony’s hands, but he doesn’t go far. Instead of clocking him, Tony’s fingers fist in the hair at the nape of his neck and
He puts a heavy hand on Steve’s shoulder as he passes and Steve watches him go, still dumbfounded. He’s not used to losing time, if that’s what this is, and when he tries to remember saying goodbye to their teammates, he can’t.
At night, Steve found himself waking from nightmares where he was drowning. Alone and bitter cold with his lungs turning to ice in an ocean of thick, heady cream. He had spent hours upon hours scrubbing at his skin, desperate for relief, but each morning he woke and it was exactly the same; Bucky’s scent on his tongue, soured with grief and longing, a snapshot of something that could have been. Once.
Everything Strange says makes the decisions obvious to everyone except Tony. There’s a moment of polite contemplation but in the end, the vote is unanimous.
“So you’ve said,” Tony’s lip curls up at the side and he offers Steve a sad, sardonic little smile. “It doesn’t change anything. It’s not enough anymore.”
Tony bites Steve’s lower lip, forcing Steve to share air and saliva and their combined gasps of pleasure.
He can see it in his face, feel it in his words. It doesn’t feel good, far from it, because he’s spent months expecting to hear Steve justify and excuse, find ways to blame Tony instead. But it’s better this way in the end, even if the truth isn’t as satisfying as the fight. Even if he wants to See Steve hurt the way he’s hurt, just to feel some sense of justice.
Rushing through the door to the B.A.R.F. programming room, he tries to mentally prepare himself for whatever it is he might see there. Damn Steve for putting them both through this. Selfish. Always so fucking selfish.
The thought that maybe Tony had died not knowing how much Steve had loved him curdles in his belly and he forces it away. There has to be another explanation.
Maybe Tony just wants to know that ending their marriage was worth something after all. That Steve had lied, had torn Tony into little pieces, because of something that mattered. Maybe that’s asking too much of the man who thinks he knows what’s best for everyone around him and has never made a wrong move in his entire life.
“You know I don’t like all that stuff, Mr. Stark.” Peter waves a hand behind him in a vague gesture and Tony understands. Peter never wanted all this, and if it weren’t for the Accords, Tony would have been happy to let him go on doing his thing and used everything in his power to keep Peter safe in his own neighborhood.
“You’re a good man,” Steve says, just to watch the flush appear high on Tony’s cheeks like it always does. Like Tony really can’t believe that Steve looks at him and sees the most amazing person on the planet.
“Mate me,” he gasped, tightening his hands in Bucky’s hair and pressing his face into the side of his neck until Bucky started mouthing at the sensitive gland. He was a dirty tease. A dirty tease, stroking his tongue along the edges, offering him a whisper of teeth, but not biting down.
“You sure that isn’t the pain meds?” Tony asks, and Pepper snatches a hand out and grabs his arm, hauling him forward with surprising strength.
A part of Steve already does, and always will live inside him. When it comes to Steve, barriers are inconsequential things Tony set aside years ago.
A little pain with the pleasure never hurt anyone. And Tony’s denying himself all the love he’s ever felt in this world. He reminds himself with an unsteady breath that Steve has changed, he’s seen it plain as day in the letters Steve has sent him. Hell, he thinks about the picture from years ago, the one Bucky had sent after the benefit when the divorce was still fresh, and thinks that Steve’s been busy changing for years.
There’s not enough liquid in his body for him to swallow the lump in his throat, so when he speaks his voice is a gruesome croak.
Steve glares at Tony, who sits twirling a multitool in his seat, grinning without remorse. “You never said—"
“Just made my life harder.” Bucky props a foot up on the table and Tony thinks it’s a barrier if he’s ever seen one. “Because then I had two scrappy little twigs to look after. Damn, am I glad things have changed. Actually, why don’t you focus on looking out for me now, punk?”
“Okay. Okay, I know.” Tony braces a hand on his chest and pulls away, crawling out of Steve’s lap. “I don’t want to talk either. Come on.”
Steve closes his eyes and breathes it all in. There must be a way he could trap all of this in his lungs and be surrounded by this feeling forever. Not only does he have everyone around him, but he knows now that one day everyone else he’s loved will be here too. Steve doesn’t have to say goodbye, and surely Tony will help him find ways to pass the time.
“I’m tired, Steve. There’s nothing new to be said. Let’s just call it a night and we’ll hope next time isn’t as monumental of a shitshow, hm?”
In the distance he could see it—the ship. He’d done it! They’d made it. They were going to be alright. They were going to live!
He sees Barnes shift forward from the corner wall where he’s been observing the drills, scribbling notes on technique, battle formations and areas of improvement. It’s been his biggest contribution so far, and his notes seem beneficial, Tony can admit.
The photo is the two of them, soaring through the sky above Malibu. Steve is wrapped up in all of Tony, arms around his neck, legs trapped between the strong lines of the Iron Man armour. It’s nothing compared to what it could’ve been.
Tony seems to accept that, eyes fixed on a spot over his shoulder. The silence feels heavy, like crawling underneath a layer of blankets on a frigid winter’s day. No matter how many times he swallows, the lump in Steve’s throat doesn’t shift. The tension in his chest coils and coils, wrapping around his heart like thorny vines and squeezing.
Steve abruptly changes the script before things heat up any further. Before he snaps the damned log in front of Tony’s face.
Rhodey clasps a hand on his shoulder and gives him a tired smile as he makes to steer him towards the exit. The dark circles under his eyes are new, and Tony knows that the days are grueling for him in more ways than one. But he stays, all the same, a solid-as-steel presence that keeps Tony grounded.
On a clear day when Tony has full access to his rational thoughts, he can remind himself with confidence that no, he hasn’t left the team in full. If anything, he’s doing Fury a belated favour by stepping back into the consulting role he had been asked to fill from the beginning.
They locked up most of the facility a long while ago, closing down wings and saying goodbye to the staff that remained. Natasha stays, because where else would she go? Bruce stays with her. They try to organize with the local governments to provide relief but are repeatedly told their services are ‘no longer required’.
Hope and a deep, unwavering love blooms across Steve’s features, his cheeks flushing with delight and a metric ton worth of relief. Reaching out to him, Steve pulls Tony into his arms and holds him on the right side of too tight.
A second set of hands on his hips distracted him, and he pulled back to refocus his attentions when Tony’s mouth trailed along the side of his neck. Kissing Tony was a morning’s jolt of caffeine, setting his blood on fire and making him want to shift right out of his clothes.
Things don’t change that much, just because a handful of signatures are curled in his fist, reminding him that it’s over now.
—whatever it is—that he should dream of Steve. After years of quiet yearning, of living a half-life of restless contentment at it’s best, and devastating isolation at it’s worse, he thought maybe it might be done.
His eyes catch on his left wrist, where at some point the burning has stopped and been replaced with... nothing. There’s no sensation, there’s no explosion of red and gold, the resplendent fireworks that once adorned his skin.
The look he gives Steve is decimating. It’s rage and heartbreak and a man lost, looking for a place to lay the blame. He can lay the blame at Steve’s feet if he has to. Steve will take it all, only if it means that he never loses him, never has to watch him collapse before he hits the ground and disappear on the breeze.
him, that much is clear, and Tony hasn’t felt this depth of love, maybe ever. But late into the evening, sated and half-asleep, hints of uncertainty churn behind Steve’s vibrant blue eyes. He’s holding something back and Tony can’t figure out why, or what.
Except this time, Steve doesn’t push on. He stops, waits, keeps his eyes trained on Tony’s with his lips pressed so hard together the blood bleeds away and leaves the crease of his mouth a dull pink.
It seemed too soon by Tony’s standard but Steve moaned low in his chest, an encouraging sound, when Bucky pressed into him from behind, jostling Steve forward and deeper into Tony. Bucky set a hard pace, hands on Steve’s trim waist as he’s rocked forward and back between Bucky’s cock and Tony’s weeping hole.
Streams of coding continue to flesh out between pauses where Tony stops to crack his knuckles and stretch out his neck. He carries on that way for the better part of a half hour while Steve sits there, numb, watching with a renewed sense of horror settling in his chest.
“I don’t, but I do want you to start getting it. Are you getting it yet, Cap? I’m telling you that the way you’re acting—the way you were acting when I got here tonight—that’s all Howard. That really the kind of man you want to be?”
Tony lets out a startled burst of laughter, and for a brief second Steve can see him working out all the logistics. Tony must think better of it because he kisses Steve soundly once more before setting Steve on his feet and walking along the trackpad that pulls the armour free.
Steve grabs Tony’s hand and drags him down the short aisle between all their friends and family before he stops. He doesn’t know where to go next. He pauses at the end of the trail of flowers and looks at Tony, expectant. His true north, always.
“Iron Man, we need you down here,” Steve’s voice is barely audible in his ears over the roar of the battle, but the comms would pick it up. Tony is high above him in the sky, repulsors chopping through hordes of the alien invaders as if they’re nothing but reams of paper, leaving a stream of alien gore in his wake.
“It was nothing, Pete.” Lie. “And I’m not here just for you.” Lie. “Seriously, everything’s fine.” Another lie. It almost makes it easy to see how the lies could have spilled out of Steve, one after another, until they littered the ground like thousands of grains of sand. “Did you still want that pizza?”
“Of course.” Steve shifts, restless, his suitcase leaning against his leg as he waits for an appropriate amount of time to leave the parking garage and head back up to greet the team. Tony’s only just left moments earlier. They hadn’t fully thought this part of the plan through.
“FRI? Can you get him back, baby?” Tony asks, frantic eyes scanning the HUD. There’s no reception. He watches her scan various satellites, trying to pick up a point of contact, anything. But nothing comes back because he’s on a spaceship hurtling to Thor knows where.
It makes sense, because it feels new to Tony too and once Steve finds his footing again and tips his chin up with a brush of his fingertips, it gets even better. Like putting on a new mark of one of his suits, always new and exciting, better than the last, and yet sweetened with the sameness of what came before.
But they can’t take the memories he has now. No one can ever tamper with the life Steve can live with Tony when he closes his eyes.
Tony shifts back into his arms, fingers on his face, stroking his cheeks, his mouth. “Okay. Okay, I know. It’s terrifying, but we’ve done a lot of terrifying things, haven’t we, Steve? I can’t explain it, but this feels right. I’m not saying you have to decide right now, but will you think about it?”
“Oh, darling you’re perfect like this. Gonna fuck you every day for the rest of our lives. It’s such a beautiful life, Steve Rogers. You’ve given me such a beautiful life.”
The frustration breaks through his shaky, vulnerable composure. It’s not fair, he hasn’t done anything wrong because Steve is the one who lied and destroyed everything. Tension crackles in the air when Steve doesn’t bite back, Tony clenching down on his teeth and letting them grind together until it hurts.
“Say you’re not just doing this for the serum.” Tony bites down hard on his lip and Steve gasps, both hands flying into Tony’s hair to keep him close. It’s what Tony doesn’t say that makes Steve ache.
Steve lets go just as Tony prepares to fire one of the supersonic blasts at him—nothing that will injure their teammates, but packing enough force to propel them backwards a fair distance—and lands on Sam in his pursuit of Natasha.
“Ehh, I like to keep him on his toes. Oh, don’t get your panties in a bunch Cap, he’s going to be fine. Just let him cool off for a bit. Make him some fucking wagon wheels.”
“Fuck me,” Tony groans into Steve’s ear, mouth exploring along the shell before he sucks on the lobe and feels Steve’s cock twitch against the curve of his ass.
“This isn’t finished, Tony,” Steve calls after him, of course he does, but Tony locks eyes with Barnes and ignores him. Barnes has regained some semblance of his composure, stroking his fingers with an eerie calm along the crumpled tie. There’s something unsettling about him, beyond the fact that the Soldier who lives inside him murdered Tony’s parents with his bare hands. Something in the way that Barnes looks at him and sees everything he needs to, and nothing more.
“I fucked up yesterday. I know that. And I know what I did wrong. I’m sorry, Tony. I’m so very sorry, and I don’t blame you for being angry. I took the stones back, and I apologized to the team for speaking on your behalf.” Steve speaks as if the words are practiced and for a split-second Tony can picture him standing in front of his bathroom mirrors, hands gripping the edge of the counter, repeating the speech over and over again until he gets it right. “I can see that you’re scared. I would be too. But you’ve got to stop pushing me away, Tony. I’m going to fuck up again, I’m not going to get it perfect, hell, I’m not going to get anywhere close. You can’t push me away like yesterday. You can’t shut me out and not be willing to try.”
“You’ll know sweetheart,” Ma’s eyes had been wistful, turned upward as she searched for words to describe a concept that couldn’t truly be captured. It wasn’t the first time she had tried, always giving in with lips upturned in a sweet smile and a short, affectionate huff or a sigh, shaking her head with romance in her eyes. “You’ll just know it. It’ll be like you found someone you had no idea you’d been waiting for.”
It’s one of those moments where the world slows down, and Steve can’t form a thought to save his life. They call him a master tactician; that may be true but Steve still needs time. He needs time to plan and to collect himself, but Tony has never been generous enough to spare him that decency, not since the first day they met. Tony meets him head on, walking him backwards in a head-on assault until his back is against the wall. Trapped.
When Tony’s hands slip under his shirt he wants to flinch away. There’s no thick, corded muscle, no warmth simmering under his skin. Steve hates this. He’s all sharp edges and translucent tissue paper bundled around bones that ache and the burn in his chest is a constant reminder that his lungs were never meant to sustain him.
Just when Tony thought maybe it was too much, Steve bit down hard, drawing a fresh wave of blood from Tony’s throat as something forced its way into his mind. It was new – not what had been there before – not what he had been expecting.
Just for a moment, he wants to let it all go. It’s okay, he can let himself have this. It doesn’t have to mean forgiveness; it doesn’t have to mean anything at all.
“Oh, I know!” Tony’s still talking. “Let’s go with pre-serum Steve. I always wanted to meet that feisty little guy.”
Steve pushes off the curb, looming over Tony the way he always does when he’s starting to lose ground and resolves himself to push on. Tony flinches without meaning to. Maybe once upon a time that had worked, or Tony had ceded ground because it had felt like the right thing to do. But not now. Not anymore.
Steve glanced up to the shut door before he looked down and took in the sight of the Iron Man puppet curled around his cock and shuddered. Humiliation searing across his chest in a striking red flush and he tried to ignore it.
“Don’t be sorry,” Tony says, shoving an elbow into his ribs. “Aunt Peggy is just mad that in this timeline I got to you first.”
Hearing those words from Tony’s mouth had been the biggest gift of all and Steve’s heart soared. Tony trusted him. Finally, after all that time, of showing Tony that there was merit in letting himself fall backwards—that Steve would be there, always—Tony was standing on the cliff’s edge ready to jump.
The words feel like a goodbye, and Steve claws back the sob bubbling in his throat. Without warning he rolls Tony over, pressing him down into the mattress, covering Tony’s lips with his own to cut off the whispers.
“No, absolutely not,” Tony juts his chin up a notch, resisting the urge to glare at Ross over the top of his glasses. “You put in so much as a word about Sergeant Barnes serving any time and we’re out. We walk. It’s non-negotiable.”
“Okay, Tony.” The words are soft and gentle, and as she brushes past him on her way out the door, she settles a hand over his shoulder for a second. She doesn’t say anything more.
“Come off it. It’s professional. Strategy. I’m not backing his call; we both think this is the right decision, and we think you’re the one that needs to bring him in.”
“That’s the sweetest thing I’ve ever heard.” Steve murmured after a beat, tugging Tony back for another kiss.
Would it be such a leap to think Tony’s only saving Steve from insanity? That’s what this is, isn’t it? Watching Steve do the same things over and over again, expecting different results, not even realizing how he’s pushing away the man that was worth ruining their
Bucky wasn’t particularly familiar with bonding. Hell, he wasn’t even sure if he was capable of bonding, his glands a mottled mess at his throat and destroyed entirely at his left wrist. But from what he did know, bonds drifted apart slowly if not properly tended. Or snapped closed if either of the pair attempted to bond with another.
Steve’s head snaps up, startled. He clocks the space on the bed, the way that Tony holds his good arm up waiting to pull him in, the blanket pulled back in an open invitation. “No, it’s—you don’t have to… I’ll be—”
Emotions well up inside Steve, and he chokes back a sob. Pepper’s tired eyes flicker up, and they’re glowing with all the love and joy that Steve feels. “Thank you,” he whispers. “Pepper, thank you.”
“Fantastic,” Steve breathes into his mouth, calculating just how much force it might take to peel the suit off Tony piece by piece. “Let’s do it again, and you can drop me into the ocean after.”
When Steve inevitably drifts off, Tony will be there waiting for him with a smile on his face and his arms wide open.
“Anything that gets Stevie to cancel morning drills.” Bucky stretches widely, back arching and popping, earning him a sideways glance of disgust from Natasha.
“They’re really gone, aren’t they?” He whispers the words as if he just now realizes, for the very first time, that the world has been irreversibly changed. As if the last twenty-seven days hadn’t even happened.
Tony paces through the workshop until he’s worn circles in the tile, then finds his way up to the generous living room. The country property is small, he hadn’t even realized that he owned it and it’s given him some time to think and gain perspective.
“Stop talking. Please.” Steve’s pleading voice is barely audible where it’s wafting up from his chest and Tony forces himself to breathe and relax, spreading his legs a degree wider to sit fully back on Steve’s cock. Even though he doesn’t deserve it, Tony humours him anyways, nosing at Steve’s temple until Steve draws his face back and captures Tony’s mouth in a fierce, earth-shattering kiss.
He’ll apologize tomorrow, send flowers and treat Pepper and Happy to a trip somewhere warm, just the two of them, then call her when it isn’t enough—because buying things for Pepper is never enough, she wants to hear him say the words.
It picks up on the fourth ring, and for a second Tony can see Steve in his mind’s eye, on the other end of the phone. He’d be all wide blue eyes, riddled with disbelief and probably more than a touch of hopefulness. The identical twin to his burner would be dwarfed in Steve’s massive hand.
If that was true, why was the shame curling tighter and tighter in his core, biting at the pleasure that didn’t fade as he worked his palm up over his cockhead?
All the long-buried grief breaks the surface, and if Steve lets him go now, he’ll lose him. They can weather this. Together. If they just stick together—
Peter sighs, rubbing a hand against the back of his neck. “I told him if he did anything to hurt you again, I’d suffocate him with my new super soldier web fluid.”
His lips brush Steve’s forehead, once. Twice. Just a whisper of skin against skin. With arms that don’t belong to him, Steve winds himself around Tony, dragging him in to bury his face against the centre of his chest. There’s no light anymore, hasn’t been for years, but the relief is still the same. If he closes his eyes, he can feel the warmth of the arc reactor, glowing bright against his cheeks, peeking underneath his eyelids.
Steve sucks in a breath and wraps thin, translucent fingers around Tony’s wrist. For a moment, he tries to pry him back, struggling even when it’s futile but the air around them crackles with anticipation and Steve doesn’t want Tony to let him go, not really.
“Hi Boss, I missed you.” FRIDAY’s voice comes out tinny from the speaker of the cell phone, but she’s there in all her cheerful glory.
Bucky wanders by, making to help Sam off the mat as Clint shoves his prize into his hand, but instead plucks the small wad of bills out of his hands as soon as it appears. For his own underage safety, Bucky claims, and they burst into hysterics.
“I didn’t pick him over you. We’re not together; it’s not like that anymore. Tony, come on. You know that’s not what this is.”
Tony meets his kisses with increasing urgency until it’s a push-pull of trying to get Steve out of his clothes and inside Tony as quickly as possible. He grunts in frustration when Steve refuses to shove into him with only spit slicking the way, grumbling in Steve’s arms as he plucks Tony off the counter and carries him down the hallway to their bedroom. With dinner forgotten, Steve throws him down on the bed only to cover him again, running a hand up his side just to see him squirm.
When he finally drifted into an uneasy sleep, the odd, sweet scent of Tony’s… whatever it was, interrupted his dreams and set his blood stirring in his veins.
“Yours,” Steve slurs leaning down to rub his cheek against Tony’s goatee just to feel the burn of his stubble again. Maybe later, Tony will let Steve feel it somewhere else; somewhere he can keep it, as a little secret reminder that this really happened.
Tony jerks back, startled, and almost comically drops onto the bed beside him. The sharp movement jostles his ribs again, and Steve swears under his breath, gingerly pressing his fingers into his side.
Pushing forward, Steve breached Tony’s slack body with a bitten-off gasp, sucking in a ragged breath as Tony’s wet heat clenched down around him like a vice. His vision blurred along the edges when he sank all the way into the hilt, fingers digging into Tony’s hips to keep him still as his body shivered and shuddered forward.
Steve felt the familiar prickle of tears behind his eyes and cleared his throat, curling the sheets up under his chin and trying to sleep. Behind his eyes, Tony’s bright smile, the teasing smirk that curled across his lips, mocked him.
“What?” Steve blinks in surprise, finally looking down to see Tony’s face, a mirror to his own grief. There’s a small smile on his lips even though his eyes are wet, one that holds a warm, full history.
This thing they have, it’s delicate. If Steve were to hazard a guess, hope is blooming in Tony’s chest the same way it is in his own, and he knows better than to crush something so precious.
The door pushes open impossibly slow and that’s exactly the sight that greets him, eyes red-rimmed and hidden in shadow, hair askew. He must have showered at some point and changed into fresh clothes but even that looks like it could have been days ago, now.
Tony glances at him, frantically, as Strange all but glares down at his wristwatch with impatience. Master of time, Tony’s bare ass.
He drains the remnants of his glass and punches the button to end the call even though Steve’s been about to say something more.
Steve offers him a lazy smile paired with hooded, sparkling eyes. When he slides his hand down Tony’s chest, curling between his legs to wrap it around Tony’s cock, Steve lets out an endearing little gasp. As if it were the first time instead of the hundredth.
There had been a time that Tony had thought he’d never marry. When he did, he found himself in a marriage so deep and all-encompassing that the thought of divorce hadn’t crossed his mind. Why would it?
“You’re beautiful like this,” Steve says because it’s true, sliding his hand over his side, tracing the little asymmetrical divots of scar tissue there before he digs his fingers into one of Tony’s hip bones and hauls him back, drawing out another one of those delicious little sounds.
The loss gets smaller every day, still rattling around in his chest but no longer pressing down into that painful, tender spot quite as often. Together they learn how to survive, then sort out how to live again.
Peter laughed good-naturedly and pointed his fork towards Tony, jumping into a razzing contest about all the merch that Tony had held onto when the Spider-Man and Winter Soldier lines had gone live in the fall, joining his collection of Captain America specialties.
“I’d say you’re right, but I was having dinner with Happy that night and that took priority. Have to keep the romance alive, you know?”
Those aren’t his favourite dreams, but in the larger scheme of things, there hasn’t been a single moment he didn’t cherish. Steve gathers every interaction in his mental Rolodex, each one unique and delicate, like tiny snowflakes gathering in his palms.
“Is that right, Stark?” Natasha’s eyes twinkle as she leans forward to give Tony a curious look. Steve glances between them, jaw aching and he imagines his smile can’t possibly get any wider.
“I didn’t either, at first, I don’t think.” Bucky said thoughtfully. “It’s like one day I just woke up and realized something was different. He almost smells… sweeter?”
“I’m not going to let some damned brainwashed prisoner of war rot in a field herding sheep because you’re an asshole, Steve. Just get on the fucking plane and come home.”
Natasha made a soft, broken sound but said nothing, just pulled him back into her arms and held him for as long as she could. Even when his knees gave way and he fell to the ground, she went with him, holding him as he collapsed and sobbed Tony’s name over and over again against her shoulder.
Tony was rarely sensitive about his class, having resigned himself years ago being a rather unorthodox Omega. He was an arrogant, egotistical, surly bastard when he wanted to be, commanding a room and parading about like an alpha on most days.
Tony’s playing with him and he doesn’t have the patience for this. There are a hundred other things he needs to do—things made harder by Tony and his goddamn pride.
The room spins and refuses to come into focus. There are flashes of the helicarrier falling from the sky and Bucky, trapped beneath the falling rubble. When he tries to help him free, Bucky’s fists pound into him and the world goes black.
Steve rolls his eyes but he knows this game, leaning back against the couch with him and shaking out his shoulders before giving Tony a look that’s composed solely of disapproving eyebrows.
Strange puts the cherry on top of the fucking proverbial cake when he spins on his heels, cape moving of its own accord, and struts right back out proclaiming that his job– in warning everyone of imminent threats– is complete.
For a moment, Steve paused, trying to steady his thoughts and avoid taking Tony the way he had longed for every lonely night in Wakanda. Steve wanted to
Tony takes a moment to catch his breath, cradling Steve’s head to his stomach. “Feel better this time?”
He avoids Steve like the plague, except when they’re running full team drills. Which means he only has to see him daily for about three hours, depending on the set. It’s bearable at first, he dodges Steve’s soulful looks and ignores his name called down hallways.
“Captain,” JARVIS says through the external speakers, his lilt emotionless and more robotic than Steve has ever heard before. “I regret to inform you that the Avalon Protocol was activated at 16:47 after Sir sustained a significant trauma to the spinal cord. Now that the battle is complete, the protocol will remain active only until further arrangements can be made.”
Tony looks into his eyes as he does, pupils dilating and a red flush rushing to his cheeks as Steve tugs Tony down and buries himself in him. Everything around them fades into the background, and it’s just Tony. Tony, rocking himself forward and back. Tony, biting down on his shoulder and tugging on his hair.
“It doesn’t count. It doesn’t count, okay?” Tony sounds like he’s falling to pieces, pulling in heavy breaths as he starts to yank on Steve’s oversensitive prick. “You’ve been so good and you’re so perfect like this. Just let go, darling, I’ve got you. It doesn’t matter. Just come.”
Something had changed, now. Subtly, in the night, maybe while they slept, ignorant to the inner working of Tony’s mind.
“Oh, good, maybe you’ll be able to help me then. It’s been pinchin’ at the shoulder like a motherfucker and the resident genius, who apparently doesn’t mind
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve smiles, but his eyes give him away. Nervousness stirs below the surface and the little muscle in his jaw that signals stress twitches.
“Are you okay?” Tony lays a hand on his shoulder, standing behind his chair. As Steve leans his head back, the hand migrates to his hair, pulling his head back against Tony’s stomach.
Everything that had been there with Steve once is shoved into the back of his mind, trapped in the smallest box on the highest shelf. Why should he bother thinking about it all, anyhow?
Bucky wears the biggest grin of them all and that’s maybe the first time he’s really seen the man smile. There’s nothing tight about it, either. Bucky is open and warm, putting in real energy that should throw Tony, but all it does is make him feel more at ease. Seems that everyone is trying these days.
Dropping the bell means that Tony wins. He wins and he’s right but Steve stopped being this man a long time ago. He was always meant to be better than this.
“Hey,” Steve whispers in his ear, wet fingers tipping his head back again to trade sweet, soft kisses, before Steve slips from his body and steps back. He takes Tony with him, arms working to twist Tony until they’re pressed close together. Steve’s firm, warm presence wraps around him and Tony wants to bury inside him, pressing a fraction closer as if it were possible. “Thank you.”
“He smells weird.” Bucky pointed out the following morning, glancing up at Steve from where they lay together in bed, an obvious emptiness between them.
“Baklava.” Tony’s excitement is evidence. He drops back into the seat beside Steve, and peels back the lid with a flourish. “You’ve never tried it before, right?”
“Don’t you want to come?” Steve is only half-teasing, watching as Tony’s prick jerks and fills out further between them, answering the question with an emphatic
Now, Steve feels like his whole body is on fire and Tony is only putting out the parts he can reach. He aches, breath tight in his lungs, and he wants Tony to put his hands back on his face, press teeth into his throat, and make promises they don’t have any more time to keep.
But Steve was the only person Tony knew who was more stubborn than himself. He also knew first hand how hard it was to break free of the restraints when you desperately wanted to be able to overcome the memory.
The adrenaline in his veins is liquid nitrogen. Tony’s at Bruce’s side, wrestling the gauntlet off him as Bruce howls in pain. Tony, always so goddamn self-sacrificing. He doesn’t ever stand down.
session with a graceful and unbearable arrogance. Plus, he’s a wizard. The kind of stupid wizard who wears a condescending cape for kicks.
That’s what Steve wants. Tony, on his knees, taking his reminder without complaint and knowing, by the end, that he belongs to Steve. That he’s always belonged to Steve since that very first day.
Right before he can’t take anymore, he shoves hard into Steve’s mouth and relishes the sound of him gagging.
“Yeah, come on,” Tony urges, legs around his hips against as Steve finally shoves a slick finger into him, a bottle of lube rolling along the side of the bed as he gets to work making Tony’s eyes flutter and the tendons in his neck strain. “Steve, please. Hurry, okay? It’s fine, just—”
Respect makes him feel light and airy, and he doesn’t even mind if Steve is still going to give him orders, especially if they continue to happen behind closed doors while Steve is peeling off his clothes. Tony will take
“I’m sorry,” Steve says. “You deserved to know and I should have told you sooner. I love you, Tony, and I’m so, so sorry.”
He’s not the man Steve once knew and his body reflects the toll the years have taken but Steve’s touching him as if he’s priceless and carved from marble, gasping into his mouth as he maps his skin like the New World. If Steve never stops touching him it’ll be too soon.
“You’re not even going to pretend, Pete? How do you even manage to hide your secret identity? Or do you? Has the entire world figured out who Spider-Man is and I just missed that? Because you’re a shit liar. Absolute crap, kid,” Tony cocks a hip against one workbench as Peter gapes at him like a salmon.
There’s no reason to concern himself with what Steve Rogers is doing, though he still picks up the occasional breadcrumbs from the news on the off chance he’s home to catch it.
It’ll be a short mission, recon only, just the Captain and Widow in stealth mode from the Quinjet, but the same sense of dread lingers in his belly all the same. It hasn’t been long since Steve almost drowned in the Potomac, while Tony was dealing with the Mandarin and he’s not ready to lose what they have—neither of them are.
JARVIS hesitated. “Captain, if you are preparing to prank Sir, I should warn you this is a particularly sensitive topic and I don’t feel it would be appropriate–”
“I know.” Tony presses his nose into the centre of Steve’s chest and huffs a little disbelieving laugh. “God, I know.”
Steve drifted into sleep with Tony’s hair tickling his jaw and the welcoming heat of his body wrapping around them both. That night, he dreamed of dancing and Tony’s hand on his nape, pulling him down to press their mouths together, the night sky clear and illuminated by the white of the moon and stars.
Tony sighs. He pulls his hands back from Steve’s face. Everything feels cold and sticky as Tony shifts his weight off the couch and Steve watches as he pulls on his clothes. Across the room, Tony retrieves a small, sealed bag from the desk and tosses it onto the sofa at Steve’s side.
“And you just conveniently forgot to mention he was your boyfriend, did you?” Bucky prompted, finally taking a step back and leaning against the table. “I’m pretty sure there was more than enough time for that before I went back under, Steve.”
Steve adjusts next to him, sliding down the mattress and forcing Tony back onto his own pillow. He covers Tony’s fingers with his own, now pressed into his chest just below his heart. In the shadows, Tony can make out the cerulean of Steve’s eyes, half-hidden by long lashes.
“Tony?” Steve approaches with caution, dread creeping through his veins. “Is everything okay? Pop the helmet for me, let’s get you over to medical.”
Steve shakes his head and doesn’t stop shaking it. He can see their wedding rings, shining bright against Tony’s olive skin. He remembers the shine in Tony’s eyes the day he married him and the disbelief before the awe set in on the afternoon Morgan was born.
For weeks leading up to that night, they had tumbled into bed together, hands frantic in a race to learn each other’s bodies. But no matter how exhausted Steve had been after, sweat and blissed out, Tony would ask him to go. He’d all but begged Steve to leave.
“Oh really? Is that generally speaking or did you have a specific time in mind, because if I remember correctly you’ve not always been the best judge of character when it comes to yours truly?”
“Say it for me, gorgeous. Say his name when you come.” And when they were both so close, his voice pitching off into breathy gasps. “I want it too, baby. I wish he were here with us. God, Bucky. Christ, Steve, just imagine it. Imagine us all together.”
Time does Tony the favour of slowing to a stop, and for a second, he swears that they hang there, suspended between reality and the fantasy that Tony’s clung to for the better part of a decade. The answer is so obvious now, and maybe there will be more conversations to be had, and maybe he’ll never marry Steve again because he’s a betting man and the odds have never been in their favour. Not from the start.
“Yes.” Steve sighed, closing his eyes and desperately clawing back the embarrassment and humiliation that threatened just below the surface. It was so obvious – he was so obvious – and he could practically feel the shit-eating grin on Tony’s face.
The workshop was dark and seemingly vacant, various projects strewn across the worktables and a few screens lit on the far side, running a set of code that FRIDAY was likely processing on Tony’s behalf.
The kisses continue, unbroken and growing more and more desperate as Steve possesses him with his tongue and sharp nips to his lower lip that make Tony groan. Pleasure sparks along every nerve ending and Tony feels so exposed, naked even in the thin layers of clothing. Steve has always stripped him of defenses, leaving him bare.
But once Tony had put the thought out there, it had stuck fast, worming its way into Steve’s thoughts at the most inopportune times.
“I won’t be held accountable to anything that happens after they get here,” Tony bites out and Ross, who’s already walking away, pauses halfway to the door and turns to look over his shoulder.
“Pretty sure that’s taken up enough of my time already, Buck,” Steve reminds him affectionately, briefly resting a hand on his shoulder before he curls it into a fist and gives him a playful slug across the arm.
“It’s hopeless, Mr. Stark.” Peter was saying, sullen with his chin in his hands as DUM-E gave a supportive chirp beside his shoulder. He was pining over a girl at his high school and had been for weeks.
“And you’re being fucking selfish,” Tony growls, shoving forward. Even with the prep, Tony feels enormous in his ass, bigger than he’s ever felt before, and Steve hides a whine in his forearm. He’s full in a way he hasn’t experienced in decades. “So—fucking—selfish—” Tony drives into him to the hilt and before Steve can bite out a sharp response Tony slaps a palm over his mouth and steals his voice.
Steve reached out for him again but the sheer violence in the way that Tony flinched away from him brought Steve up short. “Tony,
“Bullshit!” Tony shoots to his feet, jabbing a finger in Steve’s face. It’s not until Tony’s leaning over him that Steve realizes he’s trembling. There’s something wrong, but he can’t get his finger on it, like an old memory that won’t quite come into focus.
“You’re just jealous they’re not for you, Tony.” Nat teased, fastening her gift of a polka-dot bowtie right below DUM-E’s claw where it met the long strut. He whirred happily at her, claw rotating back and forth.
“Do you need a software upgrade?” Tony asks absently, wandering over to the kitchen island where a lone letter sits aside from the rest. Mild risk upon opening?
So he reminds himself of how much he misses her. A few times, until he can feel her fingers running through his hair and her soft weight against him, curled up in a sisterly comfort he’d never known before he’d met her.
Steve snorts, affronted, but Bucky’s known him a lot longer than Tony and snaps his metal fingers at him, pointing. “You are jealous! You’re worried I’m zeroing in on your guy.”
He could lose Tony in a heartbeat if he gets it wrong, now. He can feel it in the marrow of his bones.
The line clicks, but Steve doesn’t immediately speak. Instead, he’s greeted with controlled, even breaths. It’s not creepy at all.
She just kicks off her heels, slips into one of his t-shirts and a pair of sweatpants that droop off her hips despite the triple knot, and climbs into bed with him. Pressing her soft lips into his brow, Pepper gently reminds him to call next time and tells him to sleep while holds him until morning.
Shame shot through his stomach, the acid turning over, bubbling up into his mouth to leave the back of his throat burning and raw.
He wants to beg for it. He doesn’t even need to come, not if Tony will take the weight off of his shoulders, even for a second.
They’ve only talked about Steve’s missions a handful of times. When Tony’s raised the subject, Steve closes off, becoming cryptic despite Tony’s assertion that he’ll help.
But even Steve can’t resist a glance over his shoulder. He pauses in the doorway, one hand on the frame, and looks down at Tony’s feet. “You’re not Maria, Tony. You never were.”
The line crackles and screeches and Tony’s desperately sealing the hole shut if it’ll just give him a chance to hear something, anything, on the other end of the line. It’s suddenly eerily quiet, save his own heaving gasps, but there’s nothing from Steve except static.
Peter glances up, expectant, as he pops off a few more plates, peering inside at the complex web of the inner wiring. It hits him all at once; the prosthetic wasn’t meant to be a weapon at all. It was a hastily thrown together thing and a poor substitute in comparison to the one Tony had blown off.
Steve fucks him until Tony’s babbling turns into a steady stream of gasping breaths, then kisses him as his come spills down and over Steve’s fist.
“I want you to think, very carefully, about whether or not what you’re going to say to me next is an excuse, Steve. Because I’m having a really hard time deciding whether what you’ve said is true, or if it’s just that Barnes has given you all the right words to make it this far.” He laughs, humourlessly and swallows back the bile. Always with the fucking bile. “You said he doesn’t know me better than you do. Are you really so sure that’s true?”
“We’re not going to be those people. Who keep trying to find a way back to each other and destroy everything else in the process. This won’t happen again.”
Tony doesn’t look up right away, throwing his wrench down on the worktable and leaning against it, slumped over. White knuckles stare up at him as tension manifests physically in his body.
Every time he opens his mouth, the words die on his tongue because he can’t figure out where to begin. There’s a pandemonium of chaos overtaking the globe. In some places, they haven’t even finished counting the lost. Governments are in chaos, and their own leaders are calling on them. On Tony. On the remaining Avengers.
Steve kissed him exactly the way he remembered, all fumbling eagerness with a little too much teeth, pouring everything he’d ever felt into Bucky’s mouth. Steve inhaled him sharply, shuddering under his fingertips, and teased along his bottom lip with his tongue. Invading his mouth, Bucky licked and sucked and tried to draw out that delicious chocolate flavour he knew lingered below the surface somewhere.
As tears drip onto his back, Steve shatters. Every atom in his body flies apart under Tony’s skillful touch and with Tony driving up into him, hand flying over his desperate cock, Steve never stood a chance.
“Fuck, I love you. I missed you so much, Tony. Wake up, love,” Steve gasped out, flattening a hand over Tony’s lower back and forcing him down into the mattress where his cock could rub up against the sheets.
With the limited view remaining through the HUD, Tony glanced down at the grip he had on Steve’s arm and both of Steve’s hands where they were wrapped around the curve of Tony’s elbow. The wind buffeted against him, cowl lost minutes before in the gale, as the rain soaked through his hair, a dark, drenched blonde plastered on his pale face.
something to Steve, igniting the fire in him that Tony’s been looking for. Except it backfires and instead of pounding him into the next decade, Steve pulls out and manhandles him onto his back, leaving Tony bouncing against the mattress.
Fuck, Steve couldn’t think, couldn’t even breath as he forced himself deeper, hurtling towards release like pistons set to full steam ahead. He pictured Tony’s eyes opening, watching him as he fell apart and it was too much.
Natasha pulls away but she doesn’t go far, tucking in against one side as Tony rests a hand on Steve’s other arm, squeezing his bicep lightly to draw his attention behind him.
“I’m sorry. God, I am so fucking sorry, Tony. Please believe me.” Big, heaving sobs take over and Tony tugs him forward into his arms, half collapsing under the massive weight of him. It’s awkward and uncomfortable, one of Tony’s legs is quickly falling asleep under him, but he holds him through it all. Just like in Steve’s memory from the farm.
Shame and humiliation nip at his heels like terriers as he steps past a line of reporters and sees one of the cars they had arrived in already pulling up. The knowledge that Pepper’s known this whole time and not said anything, that she’s had a glimpse of his dirty little secret makes him want to sink into the floor.
He settles in a stray chair off to the side of the room because the only two chairs left at the conference table are beside Steve or beside Natasha. From this vantage point, he can at least keep his eye on everyone in the room, and as a special added bonus, he can kick his feet up on the nearby sideboard table.
Steve sighs, watching the stark lights of the hospital room glitter off the icy glass. “How can you be so sure?”
Scott, Sam, Peter and Rhodey, all dressed to the nines, wearing an eclectic mixture of expressions almost as diverse as the patterns of their perfectly knotted ties.
There had been a time once where Steve believed in the afterlife, back before aliens and Gods, super serum and the mystic arts. Now he wasn’t so sure and that scared him. If there was no afterlife, then Tony didn’t live on anywhere. He was just… gone.
The benefit is the perfect place for the announcements, both the expansion of the Maria Stark Foundation relief efforts, and the presentation of the newly appointed Avengers. Or at least, that’s what Tony has been told by Ross, the puppet master himself. Last week, he’d been told everyone was in agreement.
him how to live again; part of that teaching is finding limits so Steve never goes to the memorial. They didn’t talk about it, hardly even acknowledged it until the day after the ceremony; when Tony had said in tight words that they already had their own memorial. His eyes flickered to the photo of Peter, and Steve had wanted to sob.
Peter has never grasped the art of subtlety and it shows as he tugs off his jacket and tie, tossing them haphazardly onto one of the chairs near the sofa and propping his socked feet up on the long living room table.
The abrupt change of pace startles him, and he can’t look away while Steve pauses and then eventually adds, “
Steve glanced down at him, savouring the view of his mate, half wrapped around him in crisp, white sheets. Long, work-roughened fingers slid lovingly into his hair and dragged him down for a kiss.
Steve had missed him with an all-encompassing loss and he knew Tony must feel the same. He knew Tony loved him. He knew Tony would still want him to do this for him, just like he always had.
Tony prods at the wound, already knowing full well that the way the words tumble stiffly from her mouth, it’s more than he can possibly comprehend. Natasha’s twitches up at the corner.
“Mates. Alphas. My alphas. Fuck, please, please.” Tony panted, raking his nails down Steve’s chest. He let himself go boneless in Steve’s capable arms. Steve will take care of him.
He watches as Steve stutters and stammers over the words, telling him everything even when his voice cracks and the tears start to fall. He admits that for over a year he’s been keeping these massive, back breaking secrets, and the implication for what they mean settle over Tony to weigh him down along with Steve. Tony watches dully as his own face transitions through devastation, anger, betrayal and ultimately falls into a despair so palpable he can feel it in his bones.
He’d taken Tony’s meager weight and let Tony rest against him. For just a moment, Steve had held him.
While Tony is grounded, giving Wanda and Vision direction from one corner, Steve dives for his legs, getting a grip around one boot just as Tony soars back into the air. From this angle he can crawl halfway up the armour, swaying into the buckling as it groans under his weight, and Tony’s laughter rings in his ear.
Steve huffs a laugh, leaning heavily on the door frame as he tries to drink Tony in and commit him to memory. There’s something different about this Tony, something Steve can’t quite place.
Tony bites the edge of his jaw and reaches between them to palm Steve’s length in his fist, squeezing with the lightest pressure, barely more than a tease. “I am! I am fucking you like I mean it.” Tony laughs, breathless. “I’m fucking you like I love you, because I love you, Steve. Jesus Christ, do I ever.”
“No!” Tony says too quickly. “No, it’ll compromise the mission, he’ll only worry. I’ll let him know when he gets home.”
Steve grunts into Tony’s mouth, pinning Tony between his body and the tractor, letting Tony slam back without care. It’s rough and vicious, but Tony’s nails are still biting into his flesh as if he’s out for Steve’s blood and if this is what Tony needs—
“Bit late for that, Viz,” Bucky coughs dryly. “Might as well ply him full’a booze, gamble away his allowance, and treat him to a night at the gentlemen’s club at this point.”
“Did you mean it?” Tony ventures, taking care to wrap the sliver of hope in a layer of armour as thick as the Iron Man suit, and Steve gives him a look as if to say,
He hadn’t even seen him there, tucked into the little blind spot by his head. But his vision is still swimming, and his head feels cloudy with opiates. They must’ve pumped him full of enough to put down an elephant for it to linger this way.
He tries to memorize Steve’s silhouette against the city sky before a last, lingering kiss that signals Steve needs to leave and make his way up to the rooftop.
“Cut the shit. You heard me. If we’re going to war with universe-destroying aliens, we’re going to need all hands on deck.” Where his fists are clenched in his slacks, Tony’s fingernails dig painfully into his skin. Ross gives a heavy sigh and rolls his eyes. “As far as I’m concerned, it’s the least you can do.” When Tony’s frown deepens Ross barks out a laugh. “Get over yourself, no one cares what happened between you and your fugitive boy-toy. This takes priority over everything else.”
Cock trapped between his body and the glass, Steve’s thrusts stutter as the grip on his waist constricts and rubs him up against the window pane again. The glass is slick with precome, sliding down towards the carpet. Steve forces his fingers into Tony’s mouth and Tony sucks, obedient, so far gone that Steve could do anything he wants.
“Of course, Captain. You can find him down in the workshop. Should I notify Sir that you are on your way down?”
“Come on, fuck me,” Tony rearranges himself on the bed, shifting the back of his dress shirt up and over his hips as he feels Steve come to stand behind him, prick rubbing between the crack of his ass.
“Okay, pal.” Bucky settles in beside him, a warm line that does little to thaw the chill setting in. “I’m sure we would’ve gotten along just fine.”
“That was fantastic.” Bruce proclaimed one night, sliding a plate practically licked clean towards the centre of the table.
Tony folds his arms over his chest and gets a visceral memory of the two of them, in exactly this position, three months prior. Except this time, when he glances down at Steve’s hand something aches inside him because Steve has finally retired his wedding band. For the briefest moment Tony thinks maybe it’s around his throat—but no, there’s no chain.
“Yeah.” Steve laughs. He actually, genuinely laughs and he feels lighter than he has in years, heart brimming to overflow with love, everything Tony has ever represented in his world boiling down into this one, perfect moment. “Thank you.”
When he shuts off the engine and turns in his seat, one hand on the console that separates them, Tony follows the movement of his fingers and struggles to meet his eye.
“Shut up! Shut up JARVIS. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Steve!” And then Steve was falling, limbs limp trailing behind the rest of his body as the water reached up to welcome him to its depths. “No!”
“It’s not just you, honey.” Tony makes a little space between them, pushing the arc reactor up so it sits on the mattress between their shoulders. Tony’s gentle smile is alight, shadows dancing in the hollows of his throat.
He crawls forward, ignoring the refuse that tracks onto the pants of his uniform and how everything smells foul and rotten, to get his hands under the chin of the helmet, yanking hard despite the shouts of protest behind him.
When Tony finally works up the nerve to call Peter, he’s eager and willing, more than happy to drop everything and web his way over to the Compound, really, Mr. Stark, he’s not busy in the slightest! Tony sends a car for him instead because it’s a bit of a trek, even for Spider-Man, and he arrives just before dinner, when Tony will introduce him to the team.
Tony thinks maybe he’s finally done with Iron Man. Perhaps it’s time for someone else to take a turn. Tony’s spent some of the best years of his life defending the world and he’s damn proud of that. He’ll always be proud of that. But now he wants to rest. Figure out the next step. Close the chapter, so to speak.
Everything in Steve’s posture rejects that sentiment and Tony thinks that’s what destroyed them once. It’ll destroy them all over again if Steve lets it. Heaven forbid the man allow himself to have flaws, and give Tony the opportunity to love him – and them – anyways.
Tony’s never quite seen that look on Steve before. As if there’s gallon upon gallon of white-hot lava bubbling just below the surface and it’s taking everything in Steve to hold it back, keep it from spilling over and claiming all the ground between them. Every other time before, Tony’s been buried alive, crushed, and insignificant under the weight of Steve’s ever-present resolve.
“Alright, I’m outta here. If you fuck on the car, wipe down the hood,” Bucky says as he passes them.
Tony shouldn’t be watching this. He knows better. Come down, shut off the sequencing. That’s all he needed to do. And standing here, watching this, well, that was a massive violation of HIPPA and he could hear Pepper in his head, reminding him that a multi-million-dollar lawsuit was not what he needed right now.
“Stevie, take a step back, punk. You knew better than that.” Barnes grunts, shooting Tony a flat look.
It was in those simple moments that Tony had never had to question if he made Steve happy. If he was enough for Steve.
“Yeah, strange.” Peter picks at something on the counter absent, eyes trained between the bit of dried waste and the flurry of information flickering across the screens. He doesn’t look up to meet Tony’s eyes.
Steve leans deeper into the hot line of his body and bites at Tony’s bottom lip, crowding closer until he’s at the edge of his seat and the only logical next step is for Tony to crawl into his lap and wrap his legs around him—
It’s a chaos of emotions, and Steve can’t contain them all, gasping when Tony’s thick fingers breach him and start stretching his rim. Tony’s always in a hurry, but now he moves slowly, letting Steve feel every drive of his fingers against his prostate, every slide of a fingertip around the circle of his hole.
“Drop the bell, and this all stops,” Tony challenges, curling his fingers deeper. A third finger pushes into him and Steve gasps, toes curling with pleasure, with humiliation.
“Language! You kiss Iron Man with that mouth Cap?” Peter chirps from the beams as Clint hoots with laughter from somewhere in the ventilation system.
Tony hollows out his cheeks and sucks harder, determined to push Steve over the edge right now, tears and all. He slides his tongue along the sensitive space under the head, pokes lightly into the slit, and lets Steve control the pace, taking him faster, deeper until Steve is gasping little breaths that sound suspiciously like sobs and the rolling of his hips becomes unsteady.
They shifted around him, Bucky curling behind him and pressed against him legs to chest with Steve at his front, nudging his head into his lap. A hand ran up and down his spine, another through his hair. It felt placating. It felt wonderful.
A disgusting grimace contorts Steve’s face and the envelope in his hands is stained with his tears, blurring the plain black lettering on the front into a mess of ink. Steve’s gone a corpse shade of pale and Tony wonders if he might be sick.
“Actually, yes. I’m assuming that you know where Romanoff is? You’ll have to fill her in on all the details because she’s been MIA since the airport and I have no way of contacting her.”
Steve looks at his team, watching the way the entire room holds its breath. He slips the hand on Tony’s back down around his waist and tugs him in, dropping his gaze to Tony’s mouth.
“So, what you’re saying,” Steve had said slowly, “is that you want to be able to look at the Compound when we get married.”
Tony stands at his side, the gauntlet on his wrist. It’s been too many times and too many ways, and Steve is tired. Every time he tries to prevent this, Tony dies anyway.
Steve sighed, peace wrapping around him as he settled back into the sweet plane between wake and sleep. His brain was a happy buzz, filled with a fog that resonated with
The inner workings of the arm are a complete disaster, not unlike the outside, and Tony’s doesn’t even understand how Barnes survives with the unfortunate heap of metal.
He wants to ask Pepper if she knows what it’s like to walk around your not-home while the other half of your soul trails behind you, a broken fracture of a shadow that waxes and wanes with the sun but never disappears.
Tony curved into the motion the warmth of welcome spread through Steve. Tony was always such a responsive man, even in sleep. Behind his eyelids, Tony’s eyes flickered from side to side and Steve leaned down to press a kiss to his temple, breathing in the spice of his cologne and the soft undertones of
“You look so pretty like that, sweetheart,” Steve stroked a hand through Bucky’s hair, pushing it off his face and holding it back at the crown of his head. “Buck’s mouth all over you. How’s his tongue feel inside you, honey, so good, huh?”
Tony asks, stepping into Memory-Steve’s space and placing both hands on his shoulders, anger dissolving into concern.
“No. Do you hear me? No.” Tony scrambles backward when Steve tries to reach out for him shaking his head. Pain erupts behind the arc reactor and Tony’s left hand startles away with a series of violent tremors and it’s supremely unfair that Tony should have a still-painful prosthetic on his right, and nerve damage and tremors in his left.
