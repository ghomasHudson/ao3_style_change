Tony shrugged, the movement causing his robe to slip off his shoulder, an act that didn’t go unnoticed by Steve. “I figured since you said the rain’s probably going to get worse and it is..”
would've still been..
His eyes widened and his jaw dropped. "Could it be?" He proceeded towards the man who didn't appear to be moving away. Steve kept his distance but the man turned and looked at him and was quickly running away. Steve was sure he saw the shine of metal around his eyes. He couldn't help the small hopeful smile that made its way onto his face.
His bed was calling to him, every muscle ready to succumb to sleep but he couldn't allow himself to lay on that bed again. This bed is the same one he made love to Tony last in. He'd bared his heart to him surrounded by these sheets. He'd let it slip out of him that he felt something was wrong. He had his last kiss from Tony's lips the morning after before their lives went to hell.
Tony followed Steve’s map through the hotel lobby to the restaurant. After that, he had no use for it. Once he was in the crowded restaurant, an unearthly gravity pulled him towards the only man in the crowded room who mattered to him. Like the tides pulled by the moon, Tony gravitated towards Steve who stood out from the hundred or so faces.
Tony’s eyes narrowed even further but they didn’t remain that way as Steve stepped back and around Tony to pull his chair out for him, giving Tony a full view of himself.
"I can wait. I have our Jackie. When he wakes up, he'll definitely ask me to play Fix It with him." Tony lied. Only about the waiting part. Because no matter what he's doing, Steve will be on his mind. Even when he's calculating the complex mathematical equations that make Iron Man possible. Even when he's machining parts and fixing up damaged gauntlets. Steve’s always there. It just so happens that Tony can push Steve to the back of his mind when he knows that Steve's home.
Tony’s cheeks tinted the slightest shade of red at the nickname. “It’s starting to rain.”
Steve protectively wrapped his arms around Tony but made no move towards moving inside. Instead he watched the clouds move hurriedly across the sky as the wind got stronger. “Looks like it won’t be just a passing rainfall.”
"Do you mean when he spends his time in the workshop?"
But for the foreseeable future, this was going to be his life and he really wasn’t complaining, but this particular bed in the Moroccan apartment he rented was smaller than small. As he rolled onto his other side, he was already onto the other side of the bed, way past the limit of his half of the bed. To his surprise, there weren’t any complaints from his bed partner as he invaded his space which meant that he wasn’t in bed.
He didn't feel any different once he was surrounded by the hair he'd cut off and the smooth skin under his fingertips. He was just, tired.
Scribbling his signature down on the paper, Steve looked squarely into Tony’s eyes. “Who said it’s the end of the night?”
He could write a book filled with mistakes that he's made but that's too easy. Admitting them to Steve was the hard part. Steve who was repeatedly kissing behind his ear now and murmuring quiet apologies as if he's the one who's offended Tony with what he said and not the other way around.
Tony’s fond smile could’ve lit up the dark room if such a thing was possible. “There he goes again.”
Steve watched the night turn to dawn and the sun light the New York sky behind the thick gray clouds. There wasn't much difference between night and day with how dark the sky was. It was still beautiful to Steve but the funny thought that it might only get darker and even rain as they got closer to Canada made him smile.
But this far in his life in the spotlight, he knew better than to create a scene. Still, he needed to make room to sort out where he was going to begin with his work and pushed the majority of the documents off to the side. To his relief, the coaster he kept on the desk made an appearance and he set his coffee mug down.
Steve’s been in the bathroom for some time. Tony wasn’t worried, but it was unlike him. He knocked on the door. “Steve? You’ve been in there more than a minute.”
Tony found it easy to smile in return now that the pile of bricks sitting on his chest has been lifted by his wonderful husband.
Steve was going to hate him when he listened to this. He knew he wouldn't want to hear this but Tony owed him. "I just always wished that mine would be with you. Wrapped up in the comfort of your arms, looking up at you and memorizing every detail of your face as my time came."
"The things you do to me." Tony mumbled behind Steve, voice muffled by his neck.
Steve was confused. Clint told Tony. Did that mean that he was moving on? Steve distinctly remembered coming to the conclusion that Clint likes him right before he went out of the jet and fell. But he also said that he may love him. Ow. This hurt his head.
Tony shuddered at the impossibly fresh memory of everyone around him vanishing into dust. The memory that he wished would ebb just a fraction but continued to prove itself to be stubborn and remained lodged in every neuron of his brain.
Holding his hand in his, like it’s the most precious thing in the world, Steve kissed the ring on Tony’s finger. A laugh escaped Tony’s lips and he threw himself at Steve once more, who took his weight with an ‘oof’, and kissed him languidly.
Steve’s eyebrows furrowed. "What's tonight?"
Tony shook his head. "I'm not avoiding the conversation anymore. I've been hurting you by working for weeks straight."
"You're right." Steve agreed, his voice choked. "Most of the time we are strangers. And it all has to do with Tony's work." "Tell me. I know it's hurting you and if you keep it bottled up, it'll only hurt worse." Clint encouraged, his thumb on Steve’s chin drawing mindless back and forth lines that Cap didn’t comment on.
"Beautiful." He heard Steve say before he lifted his arms so Steve could remove his shirt.
"I love you." He returned honestly and picked up his bag, slinging it over his shoulder and walking out.
“You are.” He dropped his head on Steve’s shoulder. “You invited me to a wonderful dinner, you got this room for us, you packed a bag, you got wine. But when I ask you why, you keep avoiding an answer. I mean, I’m not reading into things here, right Steve? We’re meant to stay away for a while, eat hotel food, drink wine, and have sex?” He accentuated his question by raising his head and placing another kiss to Steve’s lips.
"What's wrong?" He asked loud enough to be heard over the roar of their bikes and the rain.
"Weren't you sleeping earlier?" Yeah. Bad idea. He already knew the answer. Maybe he just needed Steve to stop keeping it in. Never once has Steve directly brought up the fact that Tony is being the worst possible husband to him, and an even worse father. He just suffers in silence and that's the worst he can do. Worse than waiting for his terrible husband for hours without a single hint that's he's outside.
He nodded. "I don’t mind him working. I love to see him work. It's..."
He got up then and pulled the bikes out of the jet, the rain soaking him completely in minutes but he didn't go back inside. He had his bow and his quiver was strapped to his back, he just needed to wait for Cap so they could move.
Steve's chest tightened with emotion. Tony hasn't done that in a very long time. For Steve it was another promise from Tony to try harder and to be a better husband and father.
“Tony,” He cupped Tony’s face in his hands. “I’ve loved you long before I realized that I did. And it took almost losing you for me to admit it.” He bowed his head, looking directly into Tony’s eyes. “The truth is, I’ve always felt like I’m yours.” One of Steve’s hands dropped from Tony’s face. “Won’t you let me be yours?” Steve held a small box in his hand and brought it closer to Tony’s.
He quickly used his thumbs to wipe away the tears, refusing to meet Clint’s eyes. Maybe what he read as fear could simply be worry for his behalf. Clint was thoughtful and the thought of a distressed teammate would definitely affect him.
Steve smiled. “You will get answers. I promise.”
Outside on the street, Steve wiped away at his cheeks again though it was useless. His cheeks were covered in streaks of dried tears. He vaguely noted that he should probably drink some water and that led him to remember his hunger. All of which seem irrelevant in the face of what he was feeling.
"Tony." The name shaped its way on Steve's lips out of habit and it nearly crushed his chest. He hadn't allowed himself to think the name and now he had. He knew there would be consequences as the dam holding everything he didn't want to remember came crashing over him.
A sudden spark of pure joy flooded Steve's chest. Maybe he can give Tony this one thing that he desired more than any other. Hastily wiping at his cheeks, Steve willed himself off the floor, helmet in the crook of his elbow. He stepped forward towards the shelf and gave the helmet a kiss on the forehead before he returned it to its place.
"We should be in B.C. long before sunset and the bikes are so we won't alert them with the jet and have them do something to compromise the mission." Clint went on but he guessed Cap wasn't listening with the way his eyes stayed locked on the fading tower.
"We should get close." Clint yelled over the loud battery of rain and roared his bike to life, taking off without confirmation from Steve.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, swallowing the tide of emotions. Steve just proved just how big of a jerk Tony was to him. Steve who deserved all the best and was stuck with the worst husband ever. One who went days without so much as letting the love of his life hear his voice or even see him. The same husband who didn't bother asking JARVIS how Steve was doing the way he kept up with Jackie.
After catching a few breaths, Tony had enough air to speak. "That's amazing baby. That's amazing honey. Keep going babe." Tony encouraged as he scratched at Steve’s nape gently.
"It'd be more beautiful if you were here." Tony wished out loud then felt like a hypocrite. That's all that Steve's wanted every time he holes himself up in the workshop and doesn't get out for days. And here is Tony wanting that from Steve whose condition is out of his hands. He tightened his arm around Jackie. He's the closet to Steve he has now.
“Because,” Steve explained, switching Tony’s arm on his for his hand, linking their fingers together. “We have a room.”
He reluctantly lifted his lips away from Tony's sweet ones to take his hand and lead him up to their suite in the tower.
Tony lay on his side on the bare hard floor of the Benatar, his arms and legs drawn close to his torso, making his frame smaller. To anyone looking on, he appeared to be huddling close to himseld because he's cold, but that couldn't be farther from the truth.
"Cap." Clint spoke on the comm. "You need to get clear. The building will explode in 30 seconds."
Clint's smile turned into a confident smirk that he loosened Steve up even if a little.
"SHIELD says that our target should be using the children to distribute the drugs today. We'll make our way close to their hideout by bike." Clint briefed as he got the jet airborne.
Clint cupped his cheeks. "I'm sorry I made you talk about it."
Clint wakes up to the sound of music filling the room. He sits up and stretches before getting up and pushing the lush mauve curtains away. He sighs and pushes them back to cover the window. He literally is only capable of seeing white in front of him, fog from last night’s rain accompanied by the incredible height of the tower. He turns to take a look at his sleeping boyfriend and smiles when all he can see of him is his dark hair spread out on his pillow. He smiles to himself again and heads towards the bathroom to take a shower.
When he was ready, he called Tony into the bathroom and the smile on Tony’s face as he saw him was so beautiful.
"Jarvis?" he asked.  "are you... sure this is where you detected a portal?"
After greeting his parents, Tony nodded politely at Sam and Bucky, and finished his circle at Steve’s side.  Steve nearly stumbled in his haste to stand and pull the chair out for Tony.
“I’m happy to do whatever I can to protect our Family,” he offered, knowing it was the only acceptable thing to tell Howard.  Didn’t matter that Tony would rather be down in the basement, tinkering and building and hiding away.  No.  He was only good to the Starks on his knees taking a knot for his Family.  All because he’d been cursed with a uterus instead of a knot, something his father would never forgive him for.
His arms and his legs were well muscled, he looked lithe and strong.  He definitely didn’t live a lascivious life of lounging and eating like many wealthy omega’s Steve had met in the past.  His build spoke of time spent actually using his muscles.
“Alpha, claim me, please?” Tony whispered, stepping into Steve’s space.  The alpha leaned over and buried his nose in Tony’ throat, scenting him deeply before letting out a low growl that sent a zing straight to his center.  He felt that tell tale tingle that always preceded the wet rush of arousal and sighed, leaning into the scenting.
"Where is she!?" she demanded yet again, leaning over Hank's work station as if she could possibly make sense of the various screens and dials and stats that were covering it.
Tony let his fingers trail across the beautiful pieces of clothing before circling back to the one that had caught his eye first.  A small top, barely more than triangles of silk spaced perfectly to cover his nipples and pecs, a mimicry of a bralette a woman would choose to wear, in the deepest red.  Almost black. And matching panties of the same rich silk.  Wide enough in the front to cover his cock and his small omega testicles, but tapering off to a g-string in the back.  The thin straps of both the top and the panties were edged in delicate gold.  It screamed Stark and was the perfect outfit to meet his new mate in.  The accompanying shift was a shade or two lighter, a bright crimson red, and almost sheer, so thin was the fabric.  Normal under garments would have been concealed by the fabric, but the dark colors he’s chosen would show through in the right light.  Just enough on the side of slutty to capture his alphas attention and hold it, but not so far as to embarrass his father.
Steve followed Bucky and Sam silently, not paying attention to the softly spoken small talk.  Instead, he let his gaze wander, taking in the opulence and grandeur that was Stark Manor.  His mate came from old money, was obviously used to a life of privilege and decadence.  Steve was grossly aware of how little he would have to offer Anthony Stark.  His small West Side apartment was nothing compared to Stark’s home.  Anthony was going to be miserable.  This was a horrible idea.
"Can't we just go look for her?" Clint spoke up from his spot behind them.  Pepper glanced over her shoulder, taking in the tense stance the archer was holding.  His arms were crossed, mimicking Steve's stance, his tattooed arm visible outside of his black tee shirt.  Lilah stood next to her father, leaning slighting against his side.  She was almost as tall as he was these days and was looking more and more like Laura by the minute.
Tony filled both mugs to the brim once the coffee pot had finished brewing and carried them over to the island.  He slid one across the smooth counter to Bucky and cupped the other between his palms, enjoying the heat from the porcelain.  "Where's your better half this morning?" he asked, sliding onto a stool opposite the Barton-Barnes duo.
“Stark,” Bucky greeted cordially, walking over to the table and taking the lead.  Howard stood, his mate following suit, and offered a hand out to Bucky first, then Sam, leaving Steve for the end.  His grip was tight, his gaze assessing as he greeted his son’s future mate.  It left Steve feeling judged and found wanting.  Not a good sign.  But the alpha did smile as he released Steve’s hand and bid him welcome.
Tony's brain short circuited as the small child clung to him.  Her whole body shook with the strength of her cries.  The only coherent thought that was making it through his head at the moment was *why did small, displaced children always end up here!?*
The child in his arms turned her head to peer cautiously at Clint.  Tony glanced down, watching her face screw up in confusion.  One small hand reached out, trailing tiny fingers along Clint's bare bicep.  "What happened to your arm?" she asked clearly, if a little wobbly.  Clint's eyes snapped to Tony's, a look of confusion evident in his gaze, before glancing down at the girl.
Prologue
Tony immediately called for his suit, flinging his arms wide so the pieces could assemble around him. Tony was glad Steve and Arto were out of the Tower, safe on the other side of town.  One less thing to worry about.  He watched as Bucky sat up, arms tightening around Anna as the last vestiges of sleep vanished.  He looked alert and deadly, every bit the Winter Soldier at the moment, ready to protect his daughter at whatever cost.  "Jarvis, wake up Clint.  Give him the facts.  Barnes, as soon as I'm out, lock her down."  Bucky nodded, jaw tight and tense.  "I'm going to kill Reed!" Tony seethed as the face plate slipped down to cover his face.  "Every time I think he's finally shut that damn thing down, something else happens!  Fucking idiot will never learn."  Though how Reed Richards had managed to open a portal here at Avenger's Tower rather than the Baxter Building, Tony had no clue.
Tony stripped off his tee shirt and his jeans, his boxers followed suit until he stood nude in the center of his room.  A shower first, he decided.  While he  preferred the sculpted and styled facial hair he’d grown accustomed to sporting, his father was right.  An alpha wouldn’t want his omega hairy.  It was an unbecoming feature in male omegas, after all.  So, a shower and a shave.
“Good boy,” Steve murmured as Tony let a gasp escape.  Steve pushed in deeper, putting pressure on the thin barrier of skin protecting his channel, his womb, his mark of innocence.  The pressure this time, while still uncomfortable, sent a zing of pleasure through Tony’s body.
Bruce carefully took Morgan's arm, turning it over and looking at the red, irritated skin.  "This looks like a really bad sunburn, or maybe a radiation burn," he muttered.
Pepper took a shaky breath.  She couldn't lose Morgan, her brain kept chanting that fact at her.  She'd already lost everything else, she could. not. lose. Morgan.  The one thing she had promised Tony, that they would be okay, that she could keep their daughter safe.  How had she failed so badly!?
Steve gently pulled out and Tony’s body relaxed at the reprieve before gasping as he pushed back in, filling him deeply again.  Steve groaned behind him as he worked his cock in and out of his body.  The pressure slowly faded with each thrust, his body growing more accustomed to the intrusion.  It didn’t feel great, but at least it wasn’t unbearable any longer.  And then Steve shifted, and the head of cock jabbed something deep inside Tony that had his back arching, had him crying out in pleasure this time rather than pain.
A sharp jab to his side by Bucky’s elbow brought his attention back to the small group walking through the manor.
“Yes.  There’s no reason to wait.  We can talk all we want after,’ he told him.
Clint led Morgan out of Medical and to the elevator. She glanced around curiously, taking in everything.  He'd guess by the way she looked a little confused that she wasn't familiar with the Tower, or at least this part of it, which had him curious about where she lived, where the Avengers spent time in her world if it wasn't at the Tower.  So many questions.
Tony nodded.  He knew that, had heard the same.  The first time always sucked, supposedly.  He felt Steve move over him, body covering his as he lined up with his wet, loose entrance.  Steve kissed his shoulder, moving along the blade, then up to where neck meets shoulder, the place he would place his mark, his Bite.  A claim that would last his life.
"Okay, what did you do?" he asked.
"We'll find her," Steve spoke up, making the promise in his best Captain America voice.  Pepper gave him a weak smile.  Always the optimist.  Tony had always said that was both one of his more redeeming qualities and one of the things that drove him up the wall.
Steve nodded and took the seat the beta butler pulled out for him.  Bucky and Sam were pointed towards seats across from him and the seat right beside him was left empty.  Obviously for the elusive “Tony”.  Steve was glad the nickname had been used, that was obviously how the omega preferred to be addressed.  Or was it just for close associates?  He was going to be his mate, surely that would entitle him to call him Tony, right?  Or was it something he needed to earn?
Steve hadn’t realized that.  The way everyone talked, the fact that Anthony Stark still lived at home, was never really seen out, he had assumed the guy was barely of age, little more than a pup who finally had his first heat.
The door was silently pushed open and the three walked into an ornately decorated large dining room.  The table, while large enough for three times their number, was set for only 7 at the far end.  It did little to make the atmosphere more cozy or intimate, but at least they wouldn’t have to scream.
"I wasn't wearing a suit," Morgan explained, pulling her arm back to cradle it against her chest.  "Everyone wears a special suit when they use the platform, but I didn't have one on," she went on.
The pleasure was growing again, his center clenching, needing something more, something full inside of him.  Steve must have been able to tell, because he pushed in,deep this time.  Sinking in and stretching the tight channel.  The pleasure flew away in the face of the unending pressure and burn of skin stretched too far, beyond its capabilities.  Tony cried out, his body moving away on instinct.  Steve’s hand gripped Tony’s hip tightly, not letting him escape as he continued to push forward.
He turned and finally faced Steve.  Interested blue eyes met his own and the alpha smiled.  “Hi,” Steve greeted with a stupid smile.
Tony watched Obidiah nod stiffly and rise, leaving the sitting room without even looking at him.  Which didn’t hurt Tony’s feelings at all.
“I know, I know.  Almost there.  This is the worst, I promise,” Steve babbled as he pushed farther, forcing his way in and through,  Tony felt a deep, burning, tearing feeling and he cried out again, but it was done.  Steve was nestled, balls deep inside him.  Steve’s body was trembling where he lay on top of Tony and he wondered how hard Steve was holding on to his control.
“Howard, that’s ridiculous!  He’s nothing!  He’s a kid!  Tony could bring you something better, you know that,” his father’s Second spit out.
His father sighed, a long suffering sound. “Obie.  James Barnes is young, but he has amassed his sympathies all over New York.  What he’s done in the short time he’s been in control of the Westies is concerning.  Enough so that I think it’s strategic to barter a truce now, before he grows even more powerful and truly becomes a threat to us.”
Tony walked to the en suite attached to his room and went about turning on the shower, adjusting it to nearly scalding, just the way he liked, then gathered a towel and a new razor, cream and other toiletries.  His curls always behaved best when he took the time to treat them right, something he hadn’t done much of lately, as the shaggy bangs that currently marked his forehead could attest to.  Might as well start putting in more effort now, Howard’s wrath if he managed to run the alpha off with his usual utter lack of care about his appearance wasn’t something Tony wanted to face.
"I would feel better about if they learned to clean properly," Tony grumbled, falling back on another old argument.
“Sure thing, Punk.”
“Buck, this is a stupid idea.  He’s gonna take one look at the apartment and pass out from shock,” he whispered back, voice an anxiety-ridden hiss.
“Well, I do believe this is going to work out well, don’t you, Obie?” the older Stark asked, a proud note in his voice.  Steve’s eyes slid to Stane as the other alpha grunted rather than answer verbally.
The little girl had calmed down some during their ride up, but she still looked shell shocked and a little lost.  Time travel.  What the ever loving fuck?  Alternate realities, other realms, he thought maybe they had faced it all, but... time travel?
He recognized Howard Stark at the head of the table and assumed the petite blond woman to his left was his mate, Maria.  He’d met the alpha to his right various times over the last year and knew the bald head of Obidiah Stane right away.  That man had always rubbed him the wrong way and the vitriolic look he was shooting him now did not change that impression.
When dessert was served, Steve thought he might die.  Watching Tony spoon cold ice cream into his mouth, his full lips caressing the spoon, his delicate tongue peeking out to lap the slightly melted bits off, it was pure torture.  His own cock was tempted to fill right here, with Tony’s parents and his best friend as witnesses.
Howard smirked.  “Obie.  I’m sure even Rogers will be able to figure it out.  Pretty little thing presenting for him?  Surely instincts alone will be enough, he won’t even need to use his brain.”
Steve eased his finger out, slowing his movements at Tony’s exclamation.
“So… about that talk…”
The End
Tony left the bathroom and walked back to his bed, scooping up his clothes.  He slipped the silk panties on, admiring the way the thin gold band settled across his hips, accentuating the slight curve that all omegas were blessed with.  He fastened the top and then slipped the thin shift on over the ensemble, then turned to check his final appearance in the mirror over his dresser.
Steve clamped his lips shut.  Obviously her leaving and her father’s betrayal and flight to England was still a sore spot for his friend.  Steve couldn’t exactly say it wasn’t still a sore spot for himself, either.  But… losing her still hurt.
"Oh god. I get to call Sue and tell her we acquired ANOTHER random child.  And it wasn't me this time!!" he crowed through his laughter.  Tony glared at the jubilant archer.  He wasn't finding this nearly as humorous as Clint.  He couldn't shake the utter heartbreak he'd heard in the girl's voice when she'd cried "Daddy."  That mixed with the way she was clinging to him, sobs finally slowing to just whimpers and shakes, left him shook, a foreboding feeling anchored deep in his chest.  Arto's world had been messed up and broken and the Avengers had all been dead, Hydra reigned supreme.  God knew what kind of world she'd come from.  Could it be worse than that?  Tony wasn't sure he wanted to know.
Pepper could see Clint's guilt in the set of his jaw, the way his brow was furrowed, the frown that marred his face.  "Clint," she said quietly, knowing how quickly his thoughts could go dark, "it wasn't your fault.  I wasn't watching her, either," Pepper pointed out, needing her friend to let this one go. He carried enough on his shoulders without adding this to it.
Once they were alone, Howard tipped his head towards the sofa opposite him, the order silent but heard nonetheless.  Tony quickly obeyed, taking Obidiah’s previous spot on the plush red and gold sofa.
"Bah!" Anna called out, slapping her chubby hands against Bucky's shoulders. Bucky smiled softly at his daughter, giving her the attention she obviously was demanding.
"I'm supposed to, huh?" he asked.  The child nodded.
Tony sat in a plush, gilded chair off to the side of the large sitting room in Stark Manor.  Only the best for the Stark Family, Omega or not, he thought snidely.  Obidiah and Howard were seated opposite each other on the plush sofas with a low, mahogany table between them, a safe barrier to the alpha anger that Tony could scent on the air as the two men argued.
Steve dozed while he lay tied to his new mate.  He could feel the bond, a low hum in the back of his mind letting him know Tony was close, and still asleep.  He… wasn’t exactly what he had expected.  Tony was well known as a bit of a party animal, Steve hadn’t expected him to be untouched.  He wished he’d known more, had more experience.  Maybe he could have made it better for Tony.
"Yeah," she replied, spreading her fingers out across the skin, "where'd the pictures go?" she asked.  Tony met Clint's gaze again and shrugged.
Bucky took a long sip of his coffee, his whole body seeming to relax as the liquid gold hit his tongue.  "Sleeping," he responded shortly.  "He took the night shift, was up with Anna every hour I think," he offered after a second long drag of precious caffeine. Tony nodded.  "Where's yours?" Bucky asked, turning the question back on him.
Bucky walked close and reached out, cupping his shoulder in his unscarred hand.  “You are the person I trust most, Stevie.  If there is anyone I would want on my side in this, it’s you.  Please?”
He stepped under the steaming water and washed quickly, using an extra round of conditioner just to be on the safe side, before sudsing up his face and carefully taking the blade to the skin.
Morgan Stark edged closer to the large pad in the center of the cavernous room.  She could hear her mother arguing mildly with Mr Pym, something about Daddy's research and his old files.  Things that didn't really matter to six year old Morgan but seemed to matter very much to her harried mother.  Morgan glanced across the room to where Clint was standing, talking to Cap, Lilah standing next to him with her bow in hand.  She was supposed to be with them, Clint was supposed to be taking them down to the range, to watch Lilah practice.  But the range was boring.  Not for Lilah, she loved any chance to shoot at the Compound, with all the fancy holo-targets and Avenger's-level equipment.  Morgan would much rather escape to Peter's lab.  It reminded her of Daddy.  But Clint was watching her today, so that meant a day at the range.
Steve shook his head with a small smile as he finally forced his feet to move and followed Bucky and his mate up the large marble stairs to a massive double door. It opened on their approach and a tall, thin well dressed beta greeted them with a dip of his head and a soft, “Welcome.”
"Tony!" Clint's call snapped him out of his stupor.  He leaned over and scooped up the small being as her arms immediately found their way around his neck.  She didn't seem to care at all about the armor encasing his body.  He turned around to find Barton exiting the elevator, fully suited up in his purple Hawkeye gear, bow in hand with an arrow nocked.  Clint froze when Tony turned to face him, his eyes going straight to the form held tight in Tony's arms.  He watched Clint's eyebrows slowly raise higher and higher on his forehead.  "Jarvis said there was another trans-dimensional portal open.  Right under us..."
He felt it when his knot started to deflate, releasing him from the omega.  He eased back away and carefully stood from the bed.  He made his way over to the en suite bathroom and grabbed a rag, wetting it with warm water.  He returned to the bed and gently cleaned Tony while he slept.  He wasn’t sure where they would go from here, they barely knew each other.  But Tony was his now.  So, they’d figure it out along the way.
Bucky sighed and crossed his arms.  The long, cotton sleeve of the dark Henley he wore covered most of the scars that littered his left arm, just the barest hint peaked out of the cuff at his wrist, a gift from Johann Schmidt’s slimy second, Arnim Zola’s special brand of torture.  Steve tore his gaze away from that painful reminder of his utter failure to both his best friend and his leader to tune back in to what Buck was saying.
Tony gently removed his hand from Steve’s and took the offered seat.  Steve resumed his own and turned his attention back to the head of the table, to a smiling Howard.
“And you think Howard Stark is, what?  The key to pushing Schmidt back?” He asked, tone calmer this time.
The small form jumped up. Brown eyes widened as, what Tony could now see was a small girl, stood to her full height. She had a simple red tee shirt and jeans on, gold sneakers on her tiny feet.  He watched her face twist into a look of utter confusion before it crumpled completely.  The sob that tore through her as she rushed at him caught him totally off guard.  But nothing shocked him more than the strangled "Daddy!" that ripped from her throat seconds before she flung her tiny body at his armored legs.
Obidiah’s face darkened.  “Rogers is an oaf and has no idea what to do with the knot god gave him,” he muttered.
“‘Wars are won by soldiers’.”
The pressure was immense, Tony’s whole body tensed up as Steve started to ease his cock inside him.
Clint did have a point, though.  He should call Sue.  Because inter-dimensional travel was Reed's thing.  If another alternate dimension child had found it's way to their universe, it had to be Reed's fault.  He'd do that.  Just as soon as they had some answers.
Tony made his way to the garage level, cursing at the agonizingly slow speed of the elevator. Why had he never upgraded these things?  Surely he could do better than this snail's pace they were moving at currently.
“Um, I guess.  I mean.. We do have some time…” Steve muttered, even as his eyes followed the falling shift, tracing the curves and lines of Tony’s body.  He stepped closer, almost without thought it seemed.  One large hand reached out and cupped Tony’s hip, his eyes widening as if he hadn’t realized he’d moved.
He was wearing a thin, beautiful thigh length crimson red shift with delicate gold piping and edging.  While it wasn’t clear in this light, he thought he could see the barest edge of tiny, stylish undergarments, and Steve's imagination was happy to fill in what they might look like.
“Boy!” He called.  Tony sat up straight, head canted just barely to the side, an act of deference that inwardly rankled him, even if he’d never show it.  “Do you have a problem with a union between you and Barnes’s man?” His father asked.  Tony wanted to laugh.  As if he could answer any other way but yes.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
Tony led the way up the stairs, leaving Barnes and his mate along with Obie and his own parents behind, watching in an eerie unsettling way.  His intended followed behind quietly.  The cinnamon-y bright tang of virile alpha was still overwhelming, even after the hour and a half spent over dinner.  Tony was nervous.  For all his bravado and mouthiness, he had actually never bed anyone, let alone taken an alpha’s knot.  Howard was too watchful, too careful for that.  Tony’s worth was all in what kind of mate he could bring in, and being a spoiled, ruined omega would have destroyed most of that worth.  And Steve?  He was built like a brick shit house.  All muscle and hard lines.  There’s no way he was packing a tiny cock and knot.  Tony was going to feel it in the morning.
Clint watched Tony carry Morgan into the small room, glancing around, he was actually pretty sure this was the same room they had carried Arto into all those years ago.  What do you know...
"Not my fault!  Why do you assume I did something?" he asked. Bruce turned to Clint instead.
"Yeah.  Do that.  And have him meet us up on Medical," Tony responded, meeting Clint's eyes.  "What?" he asked, noticing the tightness in his jaw, the way his eyes danced, like he was trying to keep from cracking up.  Clint didn't seem to be able to hold it in any longer. He let out a cackle, holding his stomach with one gloved hand.
Tony nodded to his father.  For now though, silk and lace it was, as he doubted his mother would have bought anything less.
Howard turned back to Obidiah, ignoring Tony once more.  “See?  Tony’s fine with it.”
Tony eased the child down to the small med bed.  She looked like that was the last place she wanted to be and Clint half expected her to jump up and throw herself back into Tony's arms.
*-*-*-*-*-*-*-
"I was on the platform, I wasn't supposed to be, I was supposed to stay with Clint and Lilah," Morgan explained, voice shrill and wobbly.  Clint blinked at her explanation.  Her words were precise and easy to understand.  It was so different to how Arto's vocabulary had been when he was this size.  When they'd first found him, he pretty much only communicated through grunts and growls and curse words.  Clint uncrossed his arms, letting them fall to his sides in an unassuming stance.  He tried to appear easy, open.
"Morgan... that's your name, right?  Hi... I'm Bruce.  Can I take a swab?  We'd like to run some tests, make sure you're alright," he spoke softly.  Morgan's face screwed up, the frown and slight pout too familiar.
“Okay, but why through a bond?” Steve asked, standing up to pace the small kitchen of his West Side apartment.
"Bet Cap's swear jar is full then," she said easily.  That pulled a cackle from Clint.  Steve with a swear jar?  Good god, what kind of a world did she come from?
Howard seemed to wilt a little, his scent mellowing as he regained control of his emotions.  “Schmidt and his Hydra men are growing in numbers.  Barnes has never been a fan, they’ve had clashes, increasingly, over the last year.  He’s been causing us problems over at the docks for months.  My last shipment ended up docking down in Jersey rather than risk another run in with any of Schmidt’s goons.  Alone, we’re struggling to keep him under control.  But if we were to work together…” Howard shrugged, eyes finally straying over to the corner to land on Tony.
"You think you traveled through time?" he asked, hearing Bruce suck in a sharp breath across the room.  Morgan nodded her small head.  "Why is that?" he asked, trying to gather a little more information.  Morgan shifted on the bed, pushing her hair behind her tiny ear.
"Scott and Bruce and Daddy made it.  Cap calls it a time machine but Peter says that's simplifying it and that that's not fair to Daddy's memory.  It uses the qu-quantum realm," she went on, struggling just a little at some of the more technical terms, "to let people travel through time.  But Mr Pym has been messing with it.  He thought it could do more.  He wanted Daddy's notes and research.  Mommy didn't want to give it to him."
“Yeah, awkward as it was,” he replied.
“Nah uh. Nope.  Don’t even say her name,” Bucky hissed.
“‘M gonna knot..” he warned and Tony felt a thrill of nerves wash over him again at the warning.  Steve pushed in deep, a cry falling from his own lips as his thrusts turned into deep rutting.  Tony felt him start to swell, an overwhelming pressure and feeling of fullness overtaking him.  Just as it started to feel like too much, he felt the burning sear of Steve’s teeth piercing the skin of his neck.  His own orgasm hit out of nowhere.  His channel fluttered and clamped down on the knot deep inside as he cried out, his own small cock spurting a small amount of cum onto the sheets below.  Steve grunted, hips slamming forward, grinding the knot into him as he came, filling him with a deep heat.  His teeth stayed deep, the burn in his neck a dull ache compared to the fullness and the haze of orgasm.  It was all too much, the last thing Tony was aware of was Steve’s moans as he gently rocked against his mate.
Tony shook his head.  Clint did have a point though.  Looking closer, the girl's skin looked red and irritated and she seemed a little disorientated.  Medical was probably the right call.
He turned back to his own food and attempted to finish it off at a normal pace, not thinking too much about the omega next to him and what was coming in the next few hours.  It was traditional for the physical act of bonding to happen immediately when a deal was made, then later on a formal ceremony and party for the newly bonded pair, but the more private, personal act of actual bonding had to occur while the alpha was connected, tied to the omega or beta, and thankfully, that part was afforded privacy.  Even though the Starks had demanded that they stay at the Manor that night for the bonding, they at least hadn’t asked for any kind of witness.  He’d heard of that happening with old bloods.
After the face plate slipped shut, the suit powered up, drawing on the power of the reactor.  Tony turned and bolted for the elevator.  "J, where am I headed?" he asked as the door slipped shut.
"Morgan, what year is it?" he asked.
She just wanted to see it, get a little closer.  It was easy enough to creep up the ramp, her small feet made little sound as they padded against the polished metal.  When she made it to the top of the ramp, her eyes widened.  The platform felt large, impressive and all-encompassing.  Morgan moved to the center, turning in place to look out at the room from the higher vantage point.  She saw Clint turn to his side, glancing down to where she was supposed to be standing.  His eyes widened and he started to look all around.  Morgan knew the moment Clint caught sight of her.
Steve went back to suckling each nipple, fingers gently moving in and out, letting Tony float on the sensations.  He felt slick leaking out, coating Steve’s hand as the uncomfortable feelings slowly turned to arousal, the burn of too much fading into the burn of not enough.  He moaned, hips rising to meet Steve as he sank his fingers in again and curled them, hitting something inside that caused fireworks to explode behind Tony’s eyes.
“Shhh… it’s okay.  Open up for me, gotta let me in,” Steve whispered, hips rocking back and forth, easing just the head in and out.  Tony breathed through the pressure, focusing on the pleasure, on the light feeling of the head rubbing across his entrance.  His body slowly relaxed.  “Perfect,” Steve murmured, kissing the place where he was going to mark.
“I know, Steve,” his friend countered calmly.  “That’s kind of the point.  Forever binding us to Stark.  You and Stark can be a bridge.  I think we’ve proven pretty clearly that we aren’t a match for Schmidt alone,” he said, hand coming up to grip his bicep tightly.  Steve swallowed back his retort at the motion.
Steve pulled his phone out and smiled as he found three missed calls from Tony. He dialed his number and held the phone close to his ear, expecting Tony to whisper next to a sleeping Jackie.
Tony hissed at the friction and Steve stopped to remove both his and Tony's underwear.
He heard Steve say and as he thought about what he meant, Steve turned around, looking out the windshield.
"With you." Tony assured him and Steve kissed him with the passion of a forbidden lover, yet with such delicacy and intimacy that was solely Steve’s. Tony felt as if his lips were to melt under his husband’s.
"Go on." Prompted Tony.
Clint feels Bucky’s arms wrap around his waist and he lets his thoughts of Steve’s lips go. Bucky pushes himself very close to Clint’s back, resting his head on his right shoulder blade. “I told you baby. You can fix it.” He whispers into Clint’s back. “How? I can’t just go up to him and kiss him. Then tell him that I’ve been in love with him ever since he helped me on that mission in Italy.” Clint rants to the mug in front of him. “Doesn’t have to be this hard. Just tell him why you didn’t kiss him and that you wanted to.” Bucky says softly, arms tightening a fraction around Clint, pulling him closer to comfort him. “Tony and I can help.”
Tony stared deep into Steve’s blue eyes, attempting to read his husband's hesitancy. You big idiot, he doesn't miss you like that. He misses talking to you and hearing your voice and watching you play Fix It with Jackie. He didn’t miss you as in let's have sex Tony.
"Steve? Steve’s sleeping now J. And I'm going to join him. And you've been keeping me up to date on Jackie so you know he's asleep." Tony got up and stretched, instructing DUM-E to clean up his mess as he made his way to the bathroom in the workshop for a quick relief before heading up to scrub away the grime.
Forcing him into a sitting position, with his back heavily slumped against the wall, he reached for his helmet. His fingers splayed and his approach so gentle, the same delicate touch he used when he first held Jackie in his arms with Steve right behind him, looking at him with awe. He turned his helmet on, waiting a second for the systems to come up before he decided to be completely honest and began his message.
Clint stared down at their hands. He couldn’t believe it. Surely it was nothing more than a platonic gesture for Steve but it was everything to him.
"I alerted him sir." Answered JARVIS.
But he was a self indulgent one, unable to help it when he gasped and pulled away from the warmth of Steve’s lips, staring up at him.
He moved to the bed and sat cross legged, Jack sitting between his legs. DUM-E brought over the tray of requested drinks and Tony took it, ordering DUM-E to grab another blanket.
Steve glanced back at his bag sitting behind his seat.
Tony nodded his head towards the bottle of wine.
Steve looked up from Tony’s shoulder and met his eyes in their reflection. He smiled before tucking his face back into his shoulder. “You smell incredible. I can’t get enough of you.”
It's like giving an addict a small dosage just to settle him down but all it does is make him want more, crave more.
Tony's gaze flickered between Steve's lips and eyes before he stepped on his tip toes to slot his lips against Steve's soft ones in a gentle sweet kiss.
That's when Steve emerged from behind the shield and slung it forward, disabling three henchmen in one throw. He caught it swiftly and jumped off the bike, continuing his assault on foot. He caught a glimpse of the bike returning to the jet. Smart STARK technology specifically designed for him when Tony got sick of replacing his bike after every mission. He smiled to himself. He loved this man.
"Hey!" he called out.
Tony leaned against the counter in the communal kitchen, waiting on the coffee to finish brewing, cursing the slow pitter of the black goodness as it trickled into the pot.  He glanced at his phone, verifying the day.  Thursday meant swimming.  Steve was taking Arto so Tony could attempt to finish the jet engine upgrades for Judy. His brain was sluggish this morning, working is short, staccato sentences.  He needed caffeine.  Stat.
Clint rolled his eyes.  "Wasn't me this time!" he pointed out, crossing his arms over his chest.  "She just... appeared here.  Ask Richards," he added.
Cap gestured to something on the other side of the room and Clint and Lilah turned to listen.  Morgan glanced back at where her mom and Mr Pym were still arguing.  No one was paying attention to her, no one had even noticed that she'd crept ever closer to the large platform that dominated the room.
Hank's fingers flew across the screens, typing and jabbing and hopefully finding the answer to Pepper's desperate question.  Steve stood behind them, arms crossed, and Clint was beside him.  Pepper knew they weren't any help here, if she didn't understand the various screens and data flying by, Steve and Clint definitely wouldn't, but she appreciated the show of support.
Steve could smell him before the door opened.  The delicious scent of citrus and vanilla filled Steve’s nose, an undeniable sweetness underlining the scent that screamed fertile, available, omega.  Steve’s eyes snapped up to the far door of the dining room, the one that led to the side that he and Bucky and Sam hadn’t come from.  The beta opened the door and Steve felt his stomach drop at the sight that stepped through.
Morgan tipped her head sideways.
"Pepper..." she answered softly.  Clint snapped his eyes up to Tony's, taking in the slightly pale appearance and the wide eyes.
The clothes were perfect, tempting and sexy, with an air of elegance still.  Tony picked up the curl cream off his dresser and applied a liberal amount to his hair, scrunching and forming the curls around his head.  Then he picked up a kohl pencil and gently applied thin lines around his eyes, not over doing it, but simply highlighting the shape of them.  Bringing attention to his eyes.  His mother always talked about how beautiful his “doe eyes” were.
“My thing!?” He blurted out.  “We aren’t talking about hobbies or side gigs or what I might like to do on a Saturday night with my free time, Bucky.  We’re talking about bonding.  Claiming.  Kind of a forever thing here, Buck,” Steve reminded him incredulously.
"Uh, my arm?" he asked hesitantly.
Bucky answered in another grunt as he kicked out a stool at the island, sliding his body across it tiredly. "Teething.  It's a form of torture even Hydra never thought of implementing," he said by way of explanation.  Tony was once again eternally grateful that his child had shown up at 6 years old.  They had managed to skip some of the more tormenting stages of childhood.  Like teething.  And potty training.
Tony grinned at the name, it was impossible for him not to. Jack constantly reminded him that he could do good with his life. Jack was the proof.
With tears on his cheeks, Tony reached forward and switched the recording off. He picked up the helmet and pressed his forehead to its', before dropping a kiss to the line symbolizing its lips. For Steve, whose lips he's never going to feel ever again.
"Bye Adad." Jack waved with a smile.
Steve couldn’t hide his gasp then.
That's not how he wants to remember the one he loved like no other; hurt by his own hands, the same hands he trusted to hold him and care for him. Steve failed him like he's never been failed before. And so many have failed him in his life, from those he didn't know, to the ones he trusted the most. None have failed him and let him down the way Steve shattered Tony's heart, both figuratively and literally.
He was addicted. No he was drug. He couldn’t tell anymore and it didn't matter. There were many promises to be kept and many new ones to be made and here in his arms, there was no other place he'd rather be.
Steve raised an eyebrow. “Who said anything about round two?”
Tony was behind him then, arms snaking under his and wrapping around his torso.
"I wish I was with you love." Steve admitted in a shaky whisper.
He had work to do. He needed to check on Jackie and make sure he's all right so that when Tony came back, he can adopt him. He believed that Tony will come back. Because he came back time and time again. Afghanistan, the wormhole in the sky over New York, Siberia. Steve bit his lip to bite back the unpleasant memories. Tony always came back. Why should this time be any different?
Steve stared after him, confusion clouding his already foggy mind.
Jack smiled up at him, so beautiful and innocent. "Papa."
“I’m horrible.” Clint mumbles, letting the tears he’s been holding back since this afternoon fall onto Bucky’s shirt. “Sshhh. Sshhh. You’re not horrible.” He continues to run his fingers through the damp blond hair. “I am but I didn’t want to hurt him. Bucky, I didn’t. I.. I didn’t.. I should’ve said..” Clint stutters, tears falling faster and soaking his boyfriend’s shirt just like the rain had. But the rain can’t ever be sad. Not like Clint can.
“Told you he’d come down.” Bucky brags from where he’s turned in his seat to watch his boyfriends. The look he earns from Clint sends him laughing again. “Cap. I’m not going to fall. You can let go of me.” Clint reminds as Steve’s hands won’t budge. “Yeah.” Steve agrees but doesn’t move his hands from the archer’s hips. Clint covers the soldier’s hands with his own and pulls them away, stepping back as he does. Steve’s eyes follow Clint’s hands to where they still held his. He blushes faintly at the same time that Clint does.
This was good. Steve was actually talking and it didn't feel like it was strained or like a confession either. Maybe he didn't do so bad after all? Oh who was he kidding? He screwed up big time. Steve just loved him more than he was capable of imagining to be mad at him. And he imagined big, futurist and all.
Bucky reclaims his bottle with exasperation. “He always comes down here.” Clint grumbles low in his throat, rising too quickly from his seat and crashing chest first into Steve. Bucky laughs, the scene playing out in front of him more exciting than his movie. Steve’s arms steady Clint at his hips as he stumbles backwards at the impact with Steve’s brick like chest. When he focuses on what just happened, Clint feels Steve’s hands too tight on his hips. He looks up into the Captain’s sea blue eyes. “Sorry.” He breathes, moving his hands down to pull Steve’s away.
"You fought hard and you probably lost just as much as I did, but it's far from over." He pushed his head back against the wall heavily. He was the worst to ask this of Steve. "The Avengers don't give up. Thanos is still out there and he still has the damn stones. I won't make it but you're there."
"Then we're even."
"I love you." Tony murmured, voice thick with emotion.
He hadn't even gotten the chance to say anything else before he was taken away. Steve couldn't even make it to his side in time.
"How do I look?" Steve asked, brushing a hand through his combed hair.
Thankfully, she recognized him and lead him to see Jackie right away, promptly dousing all his fear. He sighed when his eyes landed on the young boy. He approached him with heavy feet as tears began stinging his eyes. "Oh Jackie." He gasped as he reached into the crib and pulled him into his arms.
"I'll call every chance I get. I promise." Steve kissed the back of his neck and let go of his shoulders.
"But you are Cap. No one could make you not be you." Clint argued, taking Steve's face in both his hands.
He finally got a break from assistants calling for his attention and sat down behind his desk. He groaned. The state of his desk did nothing to take away from the overwhelming feeling that he was behind on work.
They both gasped at the new feeling of each other and in Steve's hand, Tony's gasp almost completely shadowing Steve’s were he not so close to Tony for him to hear.
Clint’s hurt. That stung his heart right where it ached the most. Steve wasn't letting Clint in and he had every right to. But Clint needed to know. Even if he never got a chance with Steve, he couldn't just stand and watch as his friend remained unhappy. He would do everything he could to make it right.
"You can have candies." Tony kissed his forehead, lingering for a while. "Good night Jackie."
"If I was, I'd know how he got so cold." Tony replied sadly, pulling up another screen briefly to check Jack's temperature before returning his hand to cover his.
"I'm sorry." Tony mumbled, pulling back slightly to look into Steve's eyes.
Bucky breaks into laughter once more as he catches their reddened cheeks. He has to pull back his coke bottle from his lips too quickly as he tries not to spill what’s in his mouth. Steve and Bucky glare at him as he swallows his drink and laughs louder. Clint begins to feel his skin sweat around the Captain’s hands but he can’t seem to will his hands away. His heart beats fast in his chest as he dares a look into Steve’s eyes.
Soon enough, Clint was standing in front of him, saying something that Steve guessed was we're back at the tower. So he must’ve dosed off and at least a small fraction of the fuzzy state was actually dreams. He moved to get up but Clint set a hand on his shoulder.
Another shudder racked his body and he hugged himself tighter under the blanket even though he didn't feel cold. Maybe if he could convince his body that it is cold, it would distract him from the boy's pleas for help and his apologies as his body drifted away on the winds of an alien world. Maybe Tony can convince himself that none of it happened and Peter is still safe on Earth. Maybe Tony didn't have to look into his eyes and see the fear that shaped them, and he wouldn't have had to hold him into his arms as he..
Steve frowned. "What did he say?"
"I love you." Steve whispered, the words ghosting over Tony’s lips."I love you." He repeated, his voice breaking just as he touched his lips to his husband's.
When he emerged from checking and rechecking the bolts holding down both his and Cap's bike, Steve was in the second pilot's seat.
Curious by nature, Tony shrugged and rummaged through his drawer for the letter opener he rarely used. He opened it in one swift stroke and unfolded the paper. He beamed as soon as he recognized the flawless calligraphic handwriting. “Steve.” He began reading the letter.
"You’re wonderful Tony. You're the best thing in my life. You and our Jackie."
He kept his eyes on him and Steve wasn't moving. Then as if he read Tony's mind, Steve was hovering above his torso, his weight braced on arms at each of Tony’s sides.
Steve takes a breath and nods. “All the time. Buck and I were always a given but somehow we drifted and that’s when you and Buck and Tony and I happened.” Clint attacks his bottom lip with his teeth. “And Tony and Bucky and myself and Tony just kinda fit in the slots. But it’s all very strange.” Clint pauses and Steve doesn’t push, just listens to the sound of Tony and Bucky kissing masked by the rushing of the rain. ”Bucky says it doesn’t matter and I want to believe that, Cap.” The soldier rests his hand on Bucky’s rifle. “He tells me the same thing. You’ll believe it in time.”
The bottle of wine was left unopened where Steve placed it on the living room table. Tony’s jacket was still on the couch where Steve tossed it. Steve’s jacket hung by the door. Shoes blocked the doorway to the bathroom, and clothes were strewn about the bedroom.
With narrowed eyes Steve answered, “It’s a Captain America promise.” He smirked and stood up from his chair. “Come on. Onto phase two.” He said as he pulled Tony’s chair back from the table.
"15 seconds Cap." Clint sounded panicked to his own ears. He considered a long range arrow to take out the sicko but with the way they were moving he could hit Steve.
Steve's heart ached for him. He should've been able to adopt Jackie, even without himself. He was Tony's dream after all. And Jackie could've used a father who'd be as loving and caring as Tony undoubtedly would've been. Steve wished he could do that for him, give him another chance to fulfill his dream.
When he came back to Tony, he eased him up the bed. Tony lied back immediately, his body loving the comfort of his mattress over the seat he slept in, in the workshop but he’s not going to bed now.
Clint had a different job. He was in charge of getting the kids to safety which they mostly did on their own. His other jobs included covering Cap from any snipers and setting the drug lord's hideout smoking sky high.
Joy flooded Tony's heart and he leaned down to rub his nose against Jack's.
"..beautiful and I missed you so much it felt like you weren't even around anymore. And you said that it's okay if I didn't want to. Tony, baby I do. I just want to spend more time with you actually doing things like playing with Jackie and watching movies and cooking together. I want my Tony around me every second of everyday more than I want to make love to him."
With the shabby house clear of kids who were now running toward the other side on Clint's instruction where SHIELD waited for them, Clint rigged up the explosives and pulled out, calling after Cap to run as the detonation was timed and Clint already activated it.
Steve curled around him further.
It was nice, it just rendered Tony useless, especially when Steve refused his help and donned the Captain America suit solo.
He kissed the same spot again and Tony gasped, in the same second, Steve's hands were on his, fingers threading through his and holding on tightly.
Tony kissed the top of his head and lingered there, savoring the feeling of the warmth coursing through his son. "It's okay.  I just get scared about you, mini me." He kissed his head again. "Why did you go out on the balcony Jackie?"
"Please don't pretend that everything is okay. I know I'm hurting you and causing you emotional distress that's keeping you up at night." Tony plead, pressing himself impossibly closer to Steve's chest. "You miss me when I leave you to work and it's so bad that when you see me you just want to make sure that it's real. That I’m real." His voice cracked and he pressed a kiss to Steve's neck. "I'm real. I'm real and I'm the worst husband ever who doesn’t deserve you."
“You told me about Tony right away.." Clint climbs into the bed. "So did you.” Bucky picks up the wet clothes and tosses them into the laundry basket. “And just like you didn’t mind Tony after you knew about my relationship with Steve, I don’t mind that he kissed you.” He joins Clint in bed, pulling the thickest blanket around them and leaning close. “We kinda saw it coming. You being with me and Tony and Steve being with me and him. You two were the only two left to finish the square.”
Steve began sliding his hand up and down Tony's member slowly before stilling briefly to grab hold of his own against his lover’s.
“Steve!” Tony exclaimed as his heart jumped. “Don’t scare me like that.” He held his hand over his heart not far from where Steve had his arms wrapped around him.
Tony returned every single one, drinking in the feeling of Steve this close to him and the distinct beautiful scent of him and warm and sweet softness that were his Steve's lips.
Jack hummed around his sippy cup of hot chocolate. "Hawky tell me."
Steve bit the inside of his lip and stared at the floor of the forest, choosing to catalogue the different shades of fallen leaves instead of think about what Clint said.
Clint barely hears anything beside his blood rushing. He has this sudden realization that Steve can probably hear his heart beat as well, can probably even feel it under his thumb. His heart jumps at the thought. Steve decides to go through with what he came down to do. “Clint.” He whispers quietly, the name still foreign to his lips. Clint’s eyes travel to meet Steve’s shyly. “Yes Cap?” Steve bites his bottom lip, unsure how to proceed. Clint takes notice and gives Steve’s hands gentle squeezes as if saying go on. He actually shocked himself by doing that. But he figured, he didn’t know where to start and here was Steve, hands in his trying to say the exact same thing he couldn’t. He’d rather let him talk because Clint would never be able to put it like Steve would.
"It’s present in your everything. The way you talk to me when you finally see me. The way you hardly want anything more than to hold my hand or kiss my forehead." Tony paused, Jack pulling at his sleeve.
Steve's heart ached now that Clint's put pressure on his open wound. He didn't meet Clint’s eyes.
"I'm sorry. I will be better. I will change. I won't spend forever in the workshop. I'm sorry Steve." Tony rushed out as he cried further at Steve's kind and affectionate touch.
“You love him.” Bucky finishes for him, his hand stilling at the nape of his neck. Clint nods. “There’s still time to fix things.” Bucky lifts Clint’s chin to look into his eyes. “You can fix this. Get yourself a third boyfriend.” He smiles and plants a kiss to Clint’s lips. Clint sinks his head back on Bucky’s chest, unable to stop his mind from replaying the events of late afternoon. He wipes away the tears collecting above his cheeks and sighs, trying to focus his sharp hearing on the rain shooting away at the glass of his window.
Steve trailed off, taking hold of Clint's hands and pulling them away from his face. He held them in the space between them.
Jack began sipping happily, bouncing up and down slightly the way he loved to on Tony's lap.
Steve took his lips between his as he continued to stroke them, twisting occasionally.
He doesn’t, too frozen with Steve’s all too forward behaviour. He doesn’t pull his lips back though. He stays very still, feeling the soldiers lips move about his, kissing him very softly and demanding nothing. After a few seconds of no response, Steve pulls back to look at Clint. The look on his face breaks the marksman’s heart. He lips are pursed into a hard line and his blue eyes are the palest he’s ever seen. He looks as if he is trying so hard to hold back his tears.
Tony initiated the kiss this time, touching his lips to Steve’s with every intention of leading them to the point where Steve does things to him. Steve seemed to have other intentions and kept his kisses relatively PG-rated. Tony pouted. Steve pulled away an inch to confirm what he felt was correct and kissed Tony’s pouty lips. “What’s with the pouting?”
Steve looked harder, training his eyes on the figure to realize that it is a man. He was wearing a black tracksuit with red stripes and something blue on the chest. It seemed familiar to Steve and he concentrated on identifying how it's familiar. It took him a minute to recognize the tracksuit as identical to the one the mannequin on Tony's shelf was wearing.
Steve wished he was in possession of the Time Stone as this moment, because he wanted it to last forever. Holding Jackie in his arms, he could pretend that he's bringing him home to surprise Tony with. Or he could turn back time and make sure they do this right the first time and avoid the heartbreak that happened between them.
He made mistakes, God knows, he made so many mistakes, but none have or could even possibly have hurt him the way opposing Steve had.
"How's Jackie?" Steve asked, changing the subject.
“Right.” Steve responded and momentarily let go of Tony’s hand to take a sip of his coffee.
Setting the helmet on the control console, Tony stood up, blanket wrapped loosely around his shoulders and looked out at the vast emptiness of space. He's drifting, not in the way he promised Steve they would when he took them into space, but drifting nonetheless. And as he drifts, he will dream of him, and he will name the stars and the galaxies that he will see along his way after his eyes.
Steve made his way to the adoption agency where he and Tony first met Jackie on foot. He was drained of all his enthusiasm once he looked outside. He was reminded of all the people he saw turn to dust before his eyes, and his dark mind decided to include Jackie in that group. Suddenly, he didn't want to check up on him anymore for fear that he let him down; him and Tony.
A cold hand comes down on the soaking wet fabric of his purple hoodie, startling and bringing him out of his thoughts. He turns around and finds that the hand belongs to Bucky, the left. Clint waits for Bucky to speak first, not really in the mood to start a conversation. Bucky remains silent, his eyes on the archer, searching him deep for something that Clint knows he’s missing. He averts his eyes, looking down on his knee - length black army boots instead. The sound of the rain washing down heavily on the tower’s balcony filling his ears.
Tony’s eyes shut and his face scrunched the way it did when he tried to make sense of something. "How did Barton know though?"
He didn't know they would lose so much. He didn't know he would lose so much. He didn't know he was so weak without his anchor, without the love of his life, the love of his every cell,
He stroked him in the right rhythm for a little bit and Steve followed, muscles and body locking as he reached his climax.
Tony rose up higher on his toes, his next kiss placed directly below the line of Steve’s beard. “I don’t mean symbolically, Steve.” He placed another just under his jaw. “I mean next to me.” He accentuated his last word with a kiss to the corner of Steve’s lips. “Physically.”
Tony's head returned to the pillow and Steve only nuzzled closer to Tony, pressing small kisses to his neck as his hand set up a comfortable pace they both liked.
Bucky draws his lips away from the sensitive skin, keeping his arms around the archer’s waist. “Is it because you want him instead?” Bucky asks, looking into Clint’s blue eyes. “No. Not because of that.” Clint admits honestly, turning around in Bucky’s arms to face him. “I just can’t do this when I’m so angry at myself.” He leans his head down onto Bucky’s collar bone. Bucky’s arms immediately go to work rubbing soothing circles over the archer’s tense back. “You don’t have to be. Solving this little dilemma of yours is so easy.” He kisses the top of Clint’s head. “Trust me. If I know anything, it’s how Steve thinks. And I know that he’ll listen to you.”
“Cap..” Clint opens his mouth but he has no idea what to say. He stares at Steve as Steve looks back at him with that same heartbreaking expression. Clint blinks away the image and when he opens his eyes, he sees Steve’s back, getting drenched in the rain, running away from him. He’s feeling too many emotions at once and his heart is pounding with the rush. He can feel it as he starts shaking all over. He doesn’t know what just happened but he knows that he has to get out of the range and he starts running, ignoring the freezing rain that attacks him. He stops only when he is safely on the balcony of the tower.
Around the room were the futuristic looking items that were of Tony's liking. That was usual, what wasn't was the lack of Captain America memorabilia that Tony loved so much. It didn't come as that big of a surprise to Steve. That was the way Tony chose to cope.
Clint nodded once and stood up, handing the shield to Steve.
Clint waited for Steve in the hanger beside the jet. It was dawn and he knew Cap would be on time but he was anxious. Cap must’ve learned about his son by now. He tried to shake the feeling by checking the bikes he secured in the jet for them to use in B.C.
