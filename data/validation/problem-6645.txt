The funny thing about running a gin joint that caters to people who don’t want to be found, Natasha reflects, is how many people there end up finding something.
There’s a woman holding her purse out in front of her like a shield.  She’s backed up against a dumpster, and a man is pointing a knife at her.  When Steve calls out, “Drop it!” they both look up, startled.
“So I guess you’ll have to win this round,” Tony said, and cupped Steve’s cheek in his hand.  “Congrats, Cap.”
Steve broke the surface with a grin, his hair plastered back and shining in the moonlight.  “What, you never been skinny dipping?”
Wanda looked up at him with narrowed eyes.  Tony still sometimes got the feeling that she trusted him about as far as she could throw him - which was admittedly pretty far, she was cool like that - but that meant it didn’t surprise him when she said, “It depends.”
Pepper doesn’t rise to the bait, which irritates Tony even more.  “Being there isn’t going to help anything.”
“Yeah, but these Tom Fords aren’t as waterproof as the price tag would lead you to believe,” Tony says.  “But hey, if you’re busy - ”
? he hears through the driver’s side window as he drives them away from the tower, back to the house in Pennsylvania.
“You’re such an asshole sometimes.”  Steve glances at him, but Tony’s staring out at the black, wide-open prairie.  “How’s everybody doing?”
“Let’s start with the obvious,” Tony says.  “You think if somebody finds out you sleep with men, you’ll be out of the bureau.”
“Okay, sure, maybe, but I drew a hell of a lot of attention to myself,” Tony says.  “I drew a lot of attention to all of us.  And Thanos - ”
“You stay here,” Tony said, heading for the door.  His brain was working very, very fast to come up with a scenario that did not result in Natasha removing at least one of his balls when she was back to normal.
Tony slides the lighter back into Steve's pocket.  "Anything else on the list?  Base jumping without a parachute?  Learning to knit?"
"Fuck," growls Clint. To punctuate it, he bites down on the tendon between her neck and shoulder, worrying the tender flesh there as he slides a hand around her to press her lips open, finding her clit.
“A lot of things,” Steve said.  “And nothing.  I thought we loved each other enough to get through it.”  He closed his eyes.  “Maybe we do.  I don’t know yet.”
“Probably better not to risk it,” Tony said.  “When I get really small again I might explode.  I’m all stocked up on tardigrade meat, anyway.”
“Come on, nobody minds, do you, kids?” Tony called.  “He’ll just be a minute.  There you go, your turn, Cap!”
“See, the trouble there is, I love deals,” Stark says.  “And I can always put my money where my mouth is.  Twenty thousand dollars.”
“Seriously, someone’s going to have to roll me back to my room,” Clint said.  He pushed himself up from the table gingerly and headed for the hallway.  “Cap, if I explode the night before the biggest mission of our lives, I’m blaming you.”
“We don’t even know it’s possible to help me,” Tony said.  “What I did was pretty stupid, and bringing me back might, I don’t know, destabilize the entire spacetime continuum.”
“Seems like it’s pretty obvious,” Steve said, grunting as he set it down, ornaments and all, next to the fireplace.  “It’s a Christmas tree.  From the Palace.”
“Well, I didn’t,” Steve says, and takes a step back, leaving Tony slumped against the wall with a sense of whiplash.
Through the speakers, a potent mix of 90s hip hop emanated.  Clint had disappeared, possibly for more wine (or more nachos), and the parlor suddenly felt very, very private.
“You earned it,” Steve said.  He picked up a sponge and started scrubbing.  “So, sixteen year old me had a crush on you, huh?”
“Coulson seemed like someone we could trust,” Odinson proclaims.  “And I have an eye for it.  I had you made in under a minute, if you’ll recall, Rogers.”
“Yeah, because I’m trying to skirt the issue in case I’m reading this completely wrong,” Steve said.  “Give me a break, will you?”
closer.  One of his hands slid under Steve’s shirt, his fingers tracing circles on Steve’s ribs.  Steve ran his hands through Tony’s hair, and Tony scratched his nails down Steve’s back, and Steve could feel the firm, warm length of his body, pressed up against Steve’s, so warm it was like
“In exchange for a little discretion from the federal government,” Pierce says.  “But files get declassified all the time.  They also get destroyed.  Just thought you might have a preference for which way it goes.”
is still there, and the light shining in through the windows is dawn-colored grey.  It’s morning; Steve’s been there all night.
Tony clears his throat.  “So what changed?  I mean, why was another branch created?  Did somebody - ” Tony frowns.  “Did somebody go back in time and change something
Natasha and Bruce disappeared immediately afterwards, separately or together Steve didn't know and would never ask, but Tony wanted to eat, so Steve went with him to the private back room of some restaurant that Tony said used to be his go-to for after all the times he'd been subpoenaed.  He watched Tony eat an entire steak and listened to him talk about the work he was doing on the Milano while he downed glass after glass of expensive scotch.  Just as Steve was about to suggest they head back to the jet, Tony finished his last glass, put it down firmly, and said, "I want to blow you."
He makes it all the way to the alley before he hears footsteps behind him, and he spins around to see Stark striding out of the back room of the deli.  "That was good, what you did down there," he says.  "Natasha doesn't need much help - "
“Now, don’t forget, it’s gonna get weird in there,” Scott said.  “I mean really weird.  Imagine how weird you think it’s gonna be, and then double that.  Did they ever tell you about Alf?
“We’re going, we’re going,” Stark says, wrapping an arm around Steve’s waist and hauling him upright.
Especially if Steve doesn’t want it too.  Which, considering he hasn’t called, probably means he doesn’t.
“I’m still working on it,” Rogers says.  “And no offense intended, but it’s not the kind of thing where I can bring a bunch of tagalongs.”
“I mean, relationships are hard,” Peter says.  “Things don’t work out sometimes.  The beautiful part is enjoying it while it lasts.”
“Well, we’re not listening anymore,” Tony says.  “Hey, what do you want from Shake Shack?  Hopefully everything, because I already ordered it.  It’s called comfort eating and we’re doing it.”
“C’mon, didn’t you say you’re a New Yorker?” Steve said, puffing out his chest and heading down the block.  “Real New Yorkers take the subway, pal.”
"Thanks, Ma," Steve says dryly, and Tony flips him off over his shoulder as he disappears out the door.
“Get out of here,” he growls at Natasha, and his voice is deep and rough and full of barely banked rage.  He pulls back his fist and catches the man in the jaw so hard he spits blood.  “I said
Steve, who couldn’t always tell whether Tony was sharing something horrifying about his current way of life or just making it up, scooted back in the single bed until he was nearly pressed against the wall.
Steve smirks.  “Well, if he didn’t know before he does now.  I think we left my shirt on the floor in the living room.”
“You doing okay, boss?” Happy asks once, when he comes back from another drop-off and the penthouse feels cavernous.
Stark leads him down the hallway to a set of double doors, then pulls out a key.  “Most of this place’s a free-for-all, but I do keep a couple things behind closed doors.”
“Morgan’s not the only kid who would have disappeared,” Steve interrupts.  “She happens to my favorite, sure, but there’s billions of kids across the universe who wouldn’t have existed anymore if we’d taken everybody back five years.  Who are we to deny them life?  Who are we to tell the universe how it should work?  That’s what sets us apart from Thanos, Tony.  We didn’t set out with an agenda.  We’re just doing the best we can.”
“Not judgment,” Natasha says, pouring him another glass.  “Just want to make sure you’re good for it.”
isn’t in the history books, Tony thought.  “I don’t think we could’ve stopped them anyway.  I do not have any interest in seeing what happens if you interrupt Bruce in the act, if you know what I mean.  I get enough naked Hulk by day.”
“Never even crossed my mind,” Strange says, deadpan.  “But if you’d like an answer to your question… it may take a while.  It’s complicated.”
Later, the stars come out and Tony figures out how to turn on the hot tub, and it's so cold out that even Steve gets goosebumps as they run naked across the deck and climb in.  Steve leans his head back on the edge of the hot tub and closes his eyes, and Tony feels around under the foam for one of his feet and starts kneading the arch.
“Very well,” Vanko says, and the men back off.   “So, Agent.  We hear you’re interested in an arrangement with the boss.”
From behind him, Steve can hear the sounds of other fights breaking out, and he gets low, taking one goon out at the knees and slamming another’s head into the bar.  “Miss Romanov?”
aren’t doing anything,” Steve says.  “This has gotten even messier than we thought it would.  I need to keep my head down, just do my job and not give Pierce any reason pay me any attention.”
“It does go with the yams, actually,” Tony said, not that anyone had asked because they were all too busy stuffing their faces.
Natasha presses her lips together.  “He didn’t make it a condition of keeping the Black Widow open, which makes me more inclined to give it a shot.  And it wouldn’t be so bad to have a little extra intel before our next run at Blonsky and Killian’s organizations.”  She glances at Steve.  “He might be able to help you find your friend.”
"Just wrap it up nice and tight, it'll be fine," Steve says.  "Sorry for bleeding on your floor, Miss Romanov."
And look, Tony liked a good old-fashioned teenager cagefight as much as the next guy and he didn’t think Clint would do anything to hurt the kid, but he had a feeling allowing a fistfight wasn’t exactly by-the-book parenting; in one motion, he grabbed Steve by the back of his shirt and hauled him away from Clint, mid-swing.
“A collective of journalists, activists and politicians led by Mr. Jameson is calling for a Congressional investigation into all current and past Avengers activities,” another reporter says.  “Do you have anything to say in response to Mr. Jameson, who claims that this investigation will turn up a number of illegal and unethical actions dating back over fifteen years?”
"It's not the worst hit I've taken," Steve says curtly, and he's being honest, though not in exactly the way he wants Stark to think.
"Not joking.”  Stark leans forward, his eyes mischievous.  "This is the kind of place you can get away with something like that, you know.  Miss Romanov's very... understanding."
- and Tony, smirking at him over a glass of whiskey.  The gang’s cleared out: Odinson’s serving people down the other end of the bar, Barton’s at the door, and Banner and Romanov have disappeared entirely.  Steve raises an eyebrow at Tony.  “What’re you looking at?”
“Nice work,” Tony says through the speaker.  “Light-blocking projections, that’s tough stuff.  You should be proud, Beck.”
to inspire the kind of anger that would have brought the Hulk hurtling forth in a past life.  Steve knows that when they're not around, Bruce tries different tactics entirely; he knows that Natasha would never say it out loud, but she’s worried that one day he'll try swallowing another bullet, and this time, it'll take.
And he would have been enormously, embarrassingly wrong.  They ate, and they drank, and they ate some more, and then Tony went for a couple more bottles of wine, and then Steve cut them off because nobody wanted to be hungover tomorrow and you
"You don't need to, trouble always finds me," Banner says.  He pulls his hat down so the brim blocks his eyes and heads for the door -
He pauses.  Morgan’s sitting on the floor in front of the coffee table, staring up at Saturday morning cartoons and distractedly chewing a mouthful of pancakes.
“Well, that’s a pipe dream,” Tony said.  “For one thing, he’d need a full-body suit of armor or he’d turn to jelly, and for another I’d literally never let anyone go faster than me, hello, have you met me?”
“More or less,” Steve said.  “I told her not to worry about it.  She had some choice words for that.”
“I told you I love nachos,” Steve said unapologetically as Natasha built their third plate’s worth of them.
“Thanks, Jarvis,” Stark says, and the man disappears again.  “My butler.  Just shout if you need anything, he hides behind corners until you call for him.  You having fun?”
“That is depressing.  I’m depressed,” Tony said, flopping down onto Steve’s couch.  “Are you still convinced I’m a hallucination?”
“Well, that’s a relief.”  He puttered around the kitchen, wiping down the clean countertops and rearranging the fruit bowl, and when he turned around, Tony was still there.  “What do you want from me?”
"It's important to him," Natasha says.  "And he helped us out last night.  I don't know how he got information about where you are, but I'm guessing it cost him something, and coming here looking for you might cost him a whole lot more."  She blinks at him innocently.  "It'd mean a lot to me if you gave him a couple of minutes."
Not that he was training for anything anymore, but he used to count on it to clear his head: the steady pounding of his feet on the pavement, the pull of the tape wrapped around his knuckles, the burn in his lungs when he pushed himself as hard as he could go and then harder.  These days, all he could do was sneak out in the middle of the night sometimes and run down to the docks, sprint up and down the pier and shift shipping crates until sweat trickled down his back.
“So I’m gonna go try to make my mouth acceptable for human habitation, and maybe we can hang out later?”
It was potentially not as important as Tony had just implied, but what was done was done, so Tony rallied, “Where do you brush your teeth?”
“Yeah, hi,” Tony says.  “What’s up, can I help you guys out so you can get home to your kids?  That’s what I’m trying to do, by the way, so let’s make it quick - ”
“First of all, I’m dead, so don’t be, and second of all, last time we saw each other you kissed me, so are you really?”
In the middle of the night, Tony wakes up with a start and rolls over, suddenly anxious, but Steve is still there, his back slowly rising and falling in the dim light.  Tony doesn’t mean to stay awake watching him, because that’s weird and lame, but he must forget to stop because eventually Steve stirs and opens his eyes.  “What?” he says, blinking sleepily up at Tony.
“I’m sure plenty of people will,” Steve says, heading up the stairs.  The front hall is wall-to-wall with people, and everybody’s dressed to the nines, the women in flashy gowns and the men in sharp suits and bow ties.  Steve feels underdressed in the nicest thing he owns.
“You should go in uniform to one of those rallies they keep having,” Tony says.  “Remind them who they’re dealing with.”
- and presses a kiss to Pepper’s temple, then Morgan’s, shuts the screen door quietly behind him and flies away.
Barnes’s hand shoots up, the metal one, like he wants to grab Tony but - wisely - changes his mind.  “He’s sleeping,” he says, like it costs him something to admit it.  “He heals better when he’s asleep.  Let him be.”
“I wasn’t going to,” Steve said.  He could feel Tony’s eyes boring into him, and he shifted uncomfortably under his gaze.
Banner looks at him through narrowed black eyes and then turns around to grab a fella sneaking up on Barton from behind and slam him into the wall.  It’s always the quiet ones, Steve thinks as he turns back to his own fight.
Tony turns off his phone and shoves it in a drawer.  He has more important things to worry about than what Steve wants.  Much more important things.
Stark chuckles softly.  "That's right, you're a federal agent on the straight and narrow.  I must have forgotten."
“It’s good advice and you know it.  But hey, there’s probably somebody out there you won’t need the NDA for.”
Jameson grins at Tony, and Tony wants to punch him.  “We’re already on our way out, Mr. Stark.  Thank you so much for your hospitality.”
get it right and ended up sort of, from what I can tell, free floating in spacetime?  Way less fun than it sounds, by the way.”
There are protests now, food shortages, ugly custody battles and divorce cases, and Tony wonders when the fingers will start to point. The paparazzi who wait outside Stark Tower every day have already stopped yelling thank yous and started asking questions.
: there’s a private entrance to Stark Tower, sure, but anybody could see him driving into Tony Stark’s garage after midnight or leaving again in the morning and start to wonder.  It’s just not what they do.
“I bet you are,” Natasha says, gazing over his shoulder as Stark looks up sharply from the corner.  “So, you live around here?”
Tony gives him a rueful smile.  “Well.  I know we’re not allowed to say stuff like this, but would you be mad if I admitted I was worried about you?”
doing it," Tony says, rolling his eyes as he blasts open the lock on the front door.  "Your morals are a little squishy these days, Cap."  He steps out of the suit and leaves it standing sentry in the living room, and Steve slides his hands under the thin t-shirt he's wearing. "Christ, your hands are freezing."
, and it was only 8:15 and there was no way he could sleep, and what the fuck was he going to do if he had to spend the rest of the night
“It worked!” Tony said as Steve burst into the kitchen and rummaged for something to eat.  “I woke you up!”
“Millionaire, remember?” Stark says.  “I stopped making weapons a long time ago, but I still have contacts in the army.  Well, people I pay to be contacts.  Details in your file are pretty slim, lots of redactions and so on and so forth.  So you weren’t always six and a half feet of all-American perfection?”
“A girl after my own heart,” Pierce says.  “It’s too bad, really.  You could’ve been a real asset to what we’re doing here.”  He sighs deeply, like he’s personally disappointed that she isn’t interested in being a yes man for the mob.  “But then again, there’s a silver lining to every dark cloud, isn’t there?  You and your friends will make such a good example for all the other bootleggers who aren’t interested in playing nice.”
Peggy stared at him, unconvinced, and probably annoyed too, if Steve was reading her right.  “All right,” she said finally, and after she turned the light off she looked back at him, but Steve just looked down at the countertop until her footsteps had padded back up the stairs.
“Anything,” Tony murmured, cutting Steve off with his lips and cradling Steve’s face in his hands.  It was gentle, for just a moment, like Tony wanted it to be.  Then Steve opened his mouth and slid his tongue into Tony’s, then grabbed Tony’s shoulders and rolled until he was on top, his hips giving little abortive thrusts against Tony’s thigh.
He hoped the device took along the jet because he had a suspicion that they'd need an escape plan if this didn't work again.
"Steve," Tony caught sight of the tired lines, the strained pull of grinding teeth and loosened his grip further on his wrist, a faint but softly grounding touch on Steve's pulse, "Hey, what's this?"
Tony had gone through his share of disorienting awakenings, mouth dry and head throbbing worse than a hangover, but it never got familiar in a good way. It was always a toss-up between the medbay or in the middle of a rubble-filled land but the one constant was Steve, always watching over him till he got back to his feet.
Tony stared at the face that looked back at him, at the grey head of hair and a faintly blooming bruise on a calm cheek, deep brown eyes twinkling with amusement at what he assumed was his expression of dawning confusion.
“Keep it away,” Steve ordered, knowing that Tony had heard it too when the reactor beams diverted Thanos’ attention. It wasn’t working but they would keep trying, they had to.
"I've not been this thoroughly worn out in weeks," Tony waggled his brows and laughed at the wink he got in return, "Is this a gloating breakfast, Steven? Is this a 'my dick has insomnia defeating powers' breakfast?"
It was a peaceful moment beneath the obvious tension that still lingered and they chatted quietly till Steve heard the sound of the gate well into the evening.
“And who’s choice was that,” Tony waved his hand before clicking his tongue and holding out a hand, “I don’t need a network to get our way out, phone now. Please.”
“It’s alright,” Nebula said quietly and Steve stopped himself from choking on his water when she calmly clenched her hand into a fist before opening to reveal the oddly forked extension emerging from her index, “I can still eat.”
They had managed to resolve most of the situation with the Congress and it was back to civility since T'Challa's wedding where they had both gone separately. Civil didn't mean comfortable though, and it was an unspoken awareness in the superhero community that Iron Man and Commander Rogers were still married but not really together.
Tony rarely, if ever, pursued those he loved. The chase was good, exciting and challenging, when it was to outwit a fellow charmer or brush lint off a boring phase; love fell on the other end of the spectrum and he wasn’t sure what the rules of
He still remembered the moment he had heard T’Challa call to open the Wakandan border shields to give them time. Shuri hadn’t made it past her lab.
Steve had held stronger shields but this one seemed most precious. His hands finally rose from their conflicted giddiness and came around to rest on Tony's back, one cupping his waist while the other relaxed on the nape of the bowed neck.
“I’ll figure something out,” he smiled gently at her, “I’m sure we can find a place for a night and I do still have an apartment.”
“I make a fuss when it’s closed and you barge in without knocking,” Steve corrected him, raising a brow, “There’s a chair right there, why can’t you sit there?”
“It’s got JARVIS,” Steve replied and grinned at Tony’s laugh, “I’ve always wanted to join the mile high club with my husband.”
Tony had come back with Peggy at the end of that day looking fifty shades of overwhelmed but he had a new identity proof and a chance to find his footing.
“It’s okay,” Pepper laughed lightly and Steve breathed out, “I think you’re reacting better than Natasha. She’s made triple the amount of tea here.”
Steve exhaled and his fingers longed for a disc of balance, a phantom of the time when things had been on more solid ground. He didn’t know about the title, about the uniform and the paint announcing a legend but the shield – it was a realization of a dream in some ways.
In the morning he sat blinking at a can of water heating over a new fire and pulled out both phones. Natasha had sent a question mark. The flip phone remained quiet and he packed it back into his jacket.
"To them? Nothing," Kang replied, gesturing at the screen with a bored hand, "I'm simply letting time correct itself. Letting them fall where they should. Fixing them."
“I’m going to let you process all that now,” Tony stood up with a chuckle, “I’m guessing it’s going to take you a while.”
“Come on, I think she’ll find this whole thing interesting,” Steve clapped a hand on Tony’s shoulder and nudged him forward, “And I’ve got five seconds. That’s plenty to convince you why you’re wrong.”
Now as they both stood in front of Steve, Okoye at their side, he let the hope run through him and the echoes of a thousand warriors followed.
“I do!” Steve dropped his voice, raw breath scraping his throat and Tony was breathing hard, blinking as he stared at Steve, “I do, I’ve made them before. Why do you think I know this isn’t fair?”
but he was back to working, voice still calm and soothing for the baby, “I’ll just be a minute and then we can get back to your nap time, okay?”
Steve leaned against the wall and let himself take a minute to watch Tony listen intently to the explanations involving her superpowers being great memory and getting Jarvis to make cherry pies whenever she wanted. He had come home with a thousand possibilities in his head Tony being alone in his brooding, an impromptu trip that would bring no explanations when the man finally came back, or even coming home to silence that would last a few days.
It had been luck that had brought them together, a domino effect of a mistake from those who had come to save their own world. They had been lucky to escape things that someone else had faced.
He faced down Thanos and they fell into formation beside him, waiting for the command, friends and strangers roaring to fight back. He held his hand out and Mjölnir came back, one last piece to the armour and he heard Tony’s voice through the comm., a private link.
There was a chalk graffiti of a diamond crumbling on the pavement and Steve walked around it, noting the shades of Earth’s colours. The word
“Is this a new level of self-doubt?” Tony asked Steve but moved once he was sure that Steve had the older man, letting himself out to get them the clearing out of the area.
“Sounds like a deal,” he agreed and Tony grinned, eyes crinkling in an undecipherable emotion that Steve would have dared to call affection with anyone else. With himself, Steve wasn’t sure what it was, how a language would describe the puzzle that came in misplaced pieces between them. There was a ballpit of emotions that they always fell into, diving headfirst, bruised knees and oxblood tears. It was always one of them chasing the other, one of them escaping the other.
When he got back to the hospital, Natasha looked up from her chair and her eyes came to see his empty hands before smiling up at him.
“Of course,” Steve said solemnly, noting the twinkle of mischief in Pepper’s eyes before he waved at the screen, “Take care.”
“I think I might have a name,” he said, looking at Tony with a smile before folding the paper, “Thank you for the gift, Tony.”
“Hi” she called out without turning and Steve walked toward her, coming to stand beside her in silence.
Steve didn’t know how long it would take for that to develop into full-blown desperation again but he had missed her, missed home strangely, and he smiled back.
No matter whom she hesitated with, there was always certainty for Clint. No matter whom she lost, she always had Clint.
He couldn’t touch Tony for an instant and then he couldn’t stop himself from dragging himself towards him. Tony didn’t expect the hug at first and let out a half-bitten sound but steadied himself as Steve closed his arms around him, engulfing Tony as much as his body would allow him.
Thor stayed with him that night after Sam left for the SHIELD facilities, promising to keep things under control till Steve would return. The next morning Thor had to leave for his own people, and Steve told him that he’d go to the SHIELD base himself.
Steve tried to get to him, tried to get out of the circle of fighters crowding him but they kept coming no matter how many he destroyed. He could see through the fighting that Thanos had got the gauntlet and Carol was holding his palm apart.
“Morgan,” the answer was prompt and Steve nodded, not speaking as she swallowed twice before continuing, “I need my daughter.”
"It's a headache," Tony clicked his tongue, glancing down to see Steve smooth out his rucked up t-shirt, "It goes away slowly."
“We’ll call in SHIELD,” Steve looked at Rhodey who nodded, “We won’t leave Tony alone, but SHIELD will be easy to handle.”
whenever he could. It was heart-wrenching at times, going through endless catalogues of children who had lost their homes, their families in the blink of an eye. There were names and numbers, shelters passed on with tags, a system that ran on people who sifted through the ashes to find life again.
"I can handle it," Steve assured him, though Tony could read the tension in his jaw and felt his own nerves tighten.
He spared one look above but Howard had already got back to fighting the bot who was attempting to get past him, a gun in hand.
“So, you have questions,” Tony took a sip of his third coffee and eyed Steve above the cup, “Should we do them in alphabetical order or a timeline?”
“Let’s go,” Carol said and Steve turned to see her stare up at the sky before looking at him, an anguished look passing her eyes, “You should be there, come on.”
Nat smiled slightly at that and shrugged, the blonde tips of her hair resting on her shoulder even as the red had begun to bleed through on top. The bags under her eyes were more pronounced and her nails were chipped in the thumbs. Her jeans had been traded for maroon sweats and the blank tank top had seen better days. She did look messier than he had last seen her but she also looked better.
A chuckle escaped his lips and he switched gears, the gloves gliding over the handles as he slowed down to come parallel enough. He nodded at the driver who rolled her eyes but tilted her head in agreement.
"Cap, we're being hailed," Libby informed him, "I can't activate the defence shields, our signals are being jammed."
There was a spark of recognition, of power and war as he lifted and Mjölnir welcomed a warrior home. It was warm against his palm and Steve could feel the surge of awareness, knowing that he could call on Thor’s power now. It was all he needed to know now and he let it fly, aiming for Thanos.
Thanos’ army caught on to the plan of the gauntlet and Steve heard Peter react to the visual of being barricaded.
“Is it over?” he heard Thor ask and Steve felt his face break out in a smile, turning to see him land.
They watched Rhodey fly back to the home in the woods, Pepper right beside him, and Thor shot Steve a look before following them.
"You finally got a shower I see," Tony replied and she grinned further, raising her brows as she caught sight of Potts' raised hand, "Yes, he's not a shapeshifter and Steve's as paranoid as you, congratulations."
“Great,” Pepper’s tone had happiness and a calm that didn’t come often nowadays, “Tony’s got his day planned out with the baby and it’ll be nice to see another familiar face.”
He slowly turned to look at the door he had entered and read the name on it with dawning realization before turning back to look at his old picture staring at him from the desk.
Simple didn't mean soon and it was a fact that had followed Steve through ice, dust, and now to a quietly lit room where the time travel planning was supposed to happen. Rocket and Thor were in the kitchen, one draining the fridge dry while the other probably took apart the Keurig. Scott was somewhere deep in the basement with Clint and Rhodey, hopefully not getting pranked by the duo. Bruce had tried to keep up the work but - it had been 36 hours and Doctor Hulk was snoring into the wall as he sprawled on the floor.
Now enlarged on the screen, a simple photograph floated between them, and Steve didn’t bother stopping himself from taking in the details. Rhodey’s suit was unbuttoned and the right lapel twisted a bit, the work of a hand dragging him in for a hug maybe. Bruce’s eyes were shifting towards his right, a smile half-way blooming during the shot. His object of attention was a vision in pale yellow, Pepper’s hair free over her shoulder with a twisted braid forming a tiara of sorts but her hands were occupied in those of the man resting his forehead on her shoulder. Two feet away from her husband, a hesitantly smiling Wong had two fingers awkwardly raised, like he was considering bunny ears but also calculating the merits of it being captured in the picture.
"You ready to wake up yet?" Steve teased and Tony cracked his eyes open at the smell of coffee, rolling around to see his husband crouched on the bed with a breakfast tray beside him.
Steve was glad to have that privilege, of being allowed to have that space with Tony, when a technology convention in Japan fell under the strength of an earthquake, and with it fell Howard. It wasn’t the cold of December and the morning sun of a July day didn’t spread frost but there was ice lodged in Tony’s spine as they stood at the funeral, one year since he had first become eligible of offering a comfort more intimate than he had been in another life.
“So your plan was to propose to me and get re-engaged?” Tony asked even as he curled one arm around Steve’s neck.
Tony and Pepper had a child. They’d pulled away from the world, from – he didn’t finish the thought but skipped over. A year ago Tony had stood in a hushed room, ripping out his heart and placing it still warm into Steve’s hand. A year ago Steve had flown into space, he had witnessed the death of their last hope before losing more friends alive than dead.
It had once made Steve uncomfortable, the promotion of the place being done based on his creation, the disturbing objectification making him want to cringe at times. However, he had seen worse by now and thought this negligible to some things that were branded into his memory as much more embarrassing.
"Comms on," he confirmed and watched Potts pull himself up to his feet, "I'm not going to tell your husband that you were a dumbass if you don't tell mine what I'm about to do."
He shut the blinds on an empty room and exited to go back to Tony, where another kind of emptiness lay that he had learnt to keep low.
“Are we at the third point or the fourth?” he asked and Tony was smiling too, a shade too vulnerable to be anything other than true.
"And gave you a heart attack in 2012 but you seem fine now, so it all worked out," the man waved a dismissive gesture but his lips quirked up in mild satisfaction.
“So what’s your plan?” he asked, eyeing Tony’s clothes, “Go as Howard Potts and what, work at MIT in a time when you weren’t born? With no resources or actual connections?”
When the others saw them come in, Steve laughed as both Tony and Bruce began yelling at the same time, compliments and complaints firing off at a long-lost familiarity. Natasha had to pull them apart to get in and grab Tony in a quick hug that left the man in momentary shock before he returned the gesture.
Steve managed to shoot a weak glare but bit back the groan of pain as his entire body hurt. He didn’t need Tony to remind him of why he was in the state he was but it made sense why the man sounded exasperated. It had been just a week since his serum had been compromised thanks to the virus released by a new mad scientist who called herself Nightshade. Steve had been pulled from active duty immediately and been almost confined to a house arrest while Tony and Hank had worked furiously to figure out how to reverse the effect.
He was reading the book he had put off for years now when Natasha knocked on his open door, leaning against the frame in her dark jeans and grey hoodie.
“Why Morgan?” the phone rested lightly between his fingers as Steve sat at the kitchen table, recording for the ninth time, “There’s always a story behind every name of yours, right? Is this like Morgan La Fey? I wouldn’t be surprised; really, you do have a knight aesthetic going on.”
He was poring through the database collected for the week, a good familiarity set into the work, when his phone beeped and he blinked.
“Why are you stealing her fork? She’s eating,” Tony said to Clint’s right and Rocket rolled his eyes, still holding Nebula’s cutlery.
The Stark Mansion resembled the white model Steve had seen in Tony’s lakehouse, imposing in its immaculate grandeur.
The world, Steve’s own little world of friends and family, had a terrible history of risking everything for him and the cost of it was always too high. He would pay it himself if that were enough but life never allowed that and after ages of promising together, he wanted to break the pattern. He wanted to do things the right way.
“Seems a little selfish,” Steve smiled awkwardly but Bernie didn’t return the smile and simply shook her head.
Steve was already reaching into his belt pouch to pull the older model of Starkphone he had refused to change despite all offers of upgrade. Tony made a pleased sound when he got the phone in hand, picking it apart swiftly as he handed Steve every part he didn’t need.
“You don’t have to be,” Tony said and Steve looked up to find him giving him an understanding look, “You don’t have to be Captain America, Steve. You weren’t that for about seven years but that didn’t stop you from being a hero. From helping people. This is just a chance to do the same thing again, with whatever title you choose.”
“How do you ever get away with the cursing rule?” Steve chuckled as he checked the time again, “I really need to leave, Pepper, is it fine if I call back later?”
"We tried and it didn't work," Steve repeated, voice lowering a few decibels from broken temper. Natasha had risen from her chair, shoulders braced taut under the worn-out uniform, but her eyes glanced away when he swallowed. They were stripped raw off dishonesty and hope.
"You're frowning lesser so I guess it'll get better," Steve commented as he folded his arms over Tony's stomach, easily holding himself up, "I could have given you the neck massage, you know."
"Well," Tony leaned away from the door frame, a mirthless smile on his face, "That's going to be a problem."
Steve watched Howard’s jovial expression shift gradually into a blank look as Tony explained, leaving out parts that they really couldn’t explain. Steve resisted the urge to clench his hands when Tony explained about him and Howard’s eyes widened, glued to Steve even as Tony’s words sped up.
“Did Pepper not have a bouquet?” Steve asked and smiled as he noted the sad face drawn on the balloon. It had to be Jan.
Potts looked relieved than disappointed but inhaled before schooling his expression back to seriousness.
“Me too,” he said and it was a hundred shades of inadequate, an unending messages stream of unsaid in two words but Tony smiled, a wash of relief in his shoulders.
Which, obviously, was the cue for Tony to almost give him a heart attack as he wished Steve good luck when getting off on his floor. Steve stumbled out a response and attempted to glare as the door closed but Tony simply winked at him before walking away.
“Okay,” Steve agreed smoothly and nodded when she looked at him, “I think Thor is tired too, so we’ll both stay here for the night and then we’ll figure things out in the morning. Is that okay?”
“Do you know what it takes to kill?” Tony had a distant look in his eye, “The usual answers would be a good weapon, an easy target, or the wrong move at the right time. The base though, the base of every variation of the answer though is the same.”
"Hi," Steve answered, quiet and calm and Tony's in that word. He turned around, hands clutching the towel hanging from his apron but Tony simply lifted his head enough to rest it again against Steve's chest now.
There hadn’t been time, at first, and then there hadn’t been reason. It’s what he told himself every time his hand reached for an unavailable piece of his existence, an extension of himself. He had relied on the shield, made it such an integral part of himself, that it had been an unmooring reality to not give it a proper farewell. To lose it in a snap decision.
“Not the blueberry princess?” Tony asked as he tied the braided hair under, pinning it in place with a hairpin he was holding between his teeth.
It had burned him constantly, an ever-present knowledge of what they had cost an entire kingdom. T’Challa had protected them, helped them again and again and the truth of what it had cost his people couldn’t be ignored. Okoye hadn’t blamed them, hadn’t demanded anything from them when both the heirs of T’Chaka had been taken by the Snap. Queen Ramonda hadn’t spoken to any of them, letting Okoye handle any communication, but Steve was perversely grateful for it.
"I'm alive, thank you for asking," Tony looked at the tense face of his best friend and saw the moment Rhodey caught sight of Steve behind him, "We're all fine. But if you got Carol and Thor to come to destroy Kang's base a bit, nobody's complaining."
Detroit gave him a last touch of warmth in a cup of coffee at the DIA’s café and then Steve was off again, catching the wind.
“I – yeah,” Steve pulled himself together and looked over his shoulder, “There’s a diner I went to this morning. We could get something before we leave.”
It was just a matter of luck in the end and Steve left with one last stolen kiss as the mid-noon sun dried the skies.
He had no idea what Reed meant when he said that a time-travelling Tony had come to take away his own Tony but he was sure of one thing – this would not end well for the other guy if he didn't get Tony back in one piece.
Steve remembered Tony avoiding his eyes during the picnic, studiously making excuses to stay away. So that was because of this.
When they came up to the door, they found it open and Steve stopped two feet in. Carol shot him a glance before moving forward, walking towards the source of the noise inside. Steve let her go and took a minute, his head throbbing as he looked at the home. Rescue’s mask was thrown on the floor beside the couch, ripped off in a hurry. There was a fireplace in front of the couch, dark shelves above it to hold photographs.
It wasn’t that Tony didn’t trust him to be capable without the serum, Steve knew that. In the six years they had shared each other’s secrets and the years in the past, Tony hadn’t discounted Steve’s capabilities or made him feel valued only for the muscles. There had been their first meeting, an eternity ago now, but even at the end of that Tony had respected Steve’s tactical abilities. He knew that he was more than just a lab experiment to Tony and that he could trust the man to treat him the same without the superhuman strength.
Steve stuffed his hands in his pocket and observed Nat address the projections of the others before they blinked out, leaving only Rhodey. It was obvious what the hesitation was about but hearing him talk about the latest cartel carnage made Steve wince, the image clear in his head. He knew how Clint worked by now and – it really wouldn’t be pretty. He heard the crack in her voice as she asked Rhodey to try tracking him again and Steve took a deep breath, putting on a neutral expression as he saw the projection end before Nat let herself cry, pressing both palms to her eyes. He finally moved forward into the room and tried for a smile.
“Fuck,” Steve felt the word expel from deep within him, his hands shaking as he brought one to hold Tony’s head close and the other curled over the center of his spine. Tony patted his back hard once, twice, and then rested his hands curled around Steve’s shoulders. Steve swallowed hard before loosening his hands, pulling his arms back and took a step away to see Tony clearly.
"Voyage d'Uranibourg," Steve read, taking a step to the side where he stood between Tony and Potts, "But why does Kang have his own notes on it?"
It was sweet to see her brighten up when Tony asked Jarvis if they could take her to the apartment for the night.
The Tower was bereft of its usual chatter with half the residents absent and nobody cut his path as Tony made his way up to the penthouse. He could do a quick stop at the kitchen and pick up a smoothie or one of the –
He turned around and Falcon flew over, a portal opened behind him with crackling golden edges. When Steve looked down, another person came through the portal and the rush of relief was heady.
"I meant you," Tony corrected and this time he reached out, catching Steve's wrist lightly and bringing him to a halt right around the corner of the last corridor, "You're not gonna take on Kang alone, what's going on?"
“Finally,” he could see the calm settle around them and they had done it, they had won. Tony had pulled through in the end, thank God for him.
“Somewhere underneath all that,” Tony eyed the mess that had once been the facility and Thor came up to them, dusty and bruised but still alive and looking angry.
The whole thing took nine days, eight days longer than anyone wanted but this was the fight of their lives and those never came easy. When Tony came to tell him that they were finally ready to go ahead, Steve felt the spark of hope fuelled into a larger flame and both men shared a fierce grin of pride before deciding to do it the next morning.
Nebula was staring at Bruce with a blank face, something like confusion flitting through her face before she looked down. Steve categorized that as fine for now and moved on. Rocket looked disgruntled but had the Aether trapped in his device, still in one piece. Thor had tear stains down his cheeks but his eyes held an inkling of hope in them now and – well, Mjölnir was definitely going to be helpful, yes.
He watched the Titan crumble, flesh and bone evaporating into the air, and Steve had five years of regret melt with it.
saw Captain America. I’m in full uniform with the shield. If we get caught, everything will be much worse than you’re expecting.”
“Morgan,” Pepper’s voice held a note of fondness, “Her name is Morgan. Have a good dinner, Steve. See you tomorrow.”
He did miss his shield but Steve had broken through tougher spots and he was soon joined by Tony as they took on the remaining bot together.
“I’m pretty scrappy,” Tony shrugged a shoulder, “Also, I’m not sure about MIT but that is an excellent suggestion that I will take under advisement.”
“Remember how I told you that the stones are sentient?” Tony waited till Steve nodded before continuing, “Right. When you use them to do something, change the course of life in any magnitude, you have to have a will strong enough to match your desire. Something to prove your worth, in a way, if that makes sense. When you’re reversing the effect of the stones themselves, it’s lesser. Like Bruce’s Snap, that was him releasing a blocked passage of life. Putting things back to how they had been running before the stones were forced to take away something that wasn’t meant to stop existing. It’s why they didn’t ‘die’ when Thanos snapped. There was no blood or evidence. It was like they stopped existing, displaced from the plane of their lives. Bruce didn’t have to force them to change the course of life. He had to control their powers to crack the lock, to pull back into the line. That’s why it was a test of his control.”
“I’m almost tempted to hear the joke,” he said before meeting Tony’s eyes with all the certainty, all the courage that he could muster, “But I think we can save it for later. You have a better suggestion at the moment.”
“Of all the things you could have done, why this,” Tony demanded, shaking the phone held in his hand, “Was it the aesthetic? Please tell me it was the aesthetic.”
"No," Steve replied quietly and Tony felt his eyes crinkle as he caught the additional pressure going into scrubbing at an already eased away dirt on the plate. He wouldn't have known this two years ago, this gathering of tells that showed him more of the man that the world dissected with every appearance.
“Enough for the future,” Steve nodded and took stock of the surroundings when they slipped past the security gate into the lot, “I’m sure Bruce will understand. Right?”
“I found people in the present,” Steve shrugged, inhaling deep, “Realized it a bit late sometimes but they were family too.”
"He calls himself Potts and he left this behind," the sorcerer informed in a clipped tone, dropping the orb in Steve's hand, "Both Reed and I have tried using it but it's coded through DNA and he was pretty insistent on calling for you."
Steve fell into step as Tony turned to leave the control room and it had been weeks, probably months since they marched to the same tune and in the same line. They had fallen out of sync, friction in every motion of their meetings, but right now they were a well-tuned machine. It was a mnemonic partnership and neither needed to sound out where their feet would fall as they stalked through the dimmed corridor that led to the cellar they had escaped.
he decided but the screen cleared and Tony was still there, this time hunched over in a cellar clutching at his chest.
"Potts? Hey!" Tony called out even as he focused on the view ahead, crashing through the place without a second thought, "Fuck, hold on. I'm going to bring you back to life and kill you myself if you die on me now. Do not make me face your angry husband when he invariably comes looking for you."
“I would offer to make you dinner,” he announced and Nat looked up, taking a sandwich from the plate on her table, “but you look miserable enough already.”
Tony held on, patient in his silence as Steve reached out, an arm curling. His palm fit under the handle and the leather felt like a stitch to a part of him he hadn’t realized he had torn. The weight settled against his chest as he adjusted his hold and Tony looked away when Steve blinked down, choking down the turmoil threatening to spill over.
"That -" Tony blinked rapidly a couple of times before a reluctantly approving smile lit up his face, "- is correct. Nice of you to remember there, Captain Rogers."
“Steve, I’m not asking you to sleep in his bedroom,” Pepper took a breath and Steve waited as she continued with a tired tone, “I don’t know I said that –”
Steve stared at the picture that broke his train of thought and blinked. It couldn't be. How was it possible?
"He was my best friend," she caught Steve's elbow, fingers gentle over the suit and her eyes had sorrow but nothing could mask the warmth she felt even as she recalled their favourite man, "He will always be the love of my life. I love the life we created and every memory I have of him."
They finally found a an alley that was considerably ignored by people, a cat jumping into the trash chute when they disturbed it.
“Tesseract,” Steve echoed, an odd thought coming to mind, “Wait. Is this because of the wish? I wished for you to be back in front of the Tesseract yesterday, is this –”
," Steve reminded with the undercurrent of a laugh and Tony opened his fist to a palm, cupping his jaw as he saw Steve shoot him more looks over his shoulder.
“You’re kidding me,” Bruce said deadpanned but Natasha tied her hair up in a knot and pointed at Steve.
"If that's Nat, I'd really like it if you give it a chance before we get shooting," a voice called out from the room as he neared and Tony paused at the familiarity, "If it's Barton, I'd prefer that you got Nat or not assume I'm Loki, honestly that guy only does Steve impersonations."
"Because you threw up," Tony nodded and looked up again, watching Steve's lips quirk to the side a little, just a kiss shy of sheepish.
"Yeah, Kang isn't my husband's greatest fan," Potts shrugged as he took another sip, making an appreciative noise as he wiped at his lips, "Also, you should be calling your team in now. I don't have much time and I want to get this out before I'm dragged back in again."
“It’s one of the better things you’ve had me do, sir,” JARVIS replied and Steve laughed even as Tony kissed him shut.
Trust gained always awaited its reciprocity and Tony watched it build as his new normalcy with Steve grew. Quiet nights of backs turned with tension that woke up to legs tangled at dawn, mussed hair and beard burn carefully fixed with lazy morning routines in front of a shared mirror, stretched out tank tops still hanging from the closet that didn't hold labels of owners with old rigidity anymore - the roots sank in as their branches expanded into newer categories with passing seasons.
“He called,” Tony rubbing a hand over his mouth, “He wanted to announce that he was a father, finally. It was a successful delivery late last night, at around 11.40 p.m.”
“Are you happy?” the third attempt had him curling both hands around the phone and shutting his eyes, visualizing Thor’s face, Clint’s shut door, “Is any one of us happy? I hope you are, I really do.”
There’s a rally in Washington Square Park and, in an entirely-unsurprising turn of events, J Jonah Jameson is scheduled to speak.  It’s pretty standard stuff - there aren’t enough support services for people who Blipped, they deserve better than a world that left them behind, et cetera et cetera - and Tony follows it via Friday from his workshop, so he sees the first Insta-story of somebody throwing a bottle at counter-protestors.
“We’re not babies,” Clint said, his too-long bathrobe trailing behind him as he wandered out from the kitchen.
“Yeah, yeah, I’m going.”  Barnes shoves his keys in his pocket, and with one last pointed glance at Tony, closes the door behind him.
“You’re not going to talk me out of this, Tony,” Steve said.  “It’s decided.  You know how to find me in the future, right?”
If he was honest, it was probably a stupid risk to take, but if anyone saw him, it would be their word against his; it’s not like there were surveillance cameras everywhere.
Steve’s disappointed, and relieved too, all at once, and he shoves it all down by throwing himself into the middle of two of Killian’s men.  It’s a pretty bad plan and it shows: one of them lunges at him and gets a grip around Steve’s neck, and the other pulls out a pistol and aims it right at his face.
.  It was too bad wine didn’t mix and match well, he thought, filling his glass as high as he could while also guaranteeing (well, mostly guaranteeing) that he wouldn’t spill on his way back to the table.
Great.  Morgan probably dug up an old box of Thor’s Poptarts and will now demand them for breakfast regularly for the rest of her life.  Tony yawns and pads into the hall, wondering exactly how he’s going to explain to Pepper how he got their kid hooked on -
Steve flipped over and backstroked the length of the pool.  “I thought I was being a fun drunk.  We’re skinny dipping!”
more in the way of direction.  Luckily for everyone, Tony doesn’t mind taking the initiative, he thinks as he slides down Steve’s body, stopping only to press a kiss against his ribs and taste the skin of his thigh.
,” Tony interrupted, “we could find something harmless to talk about until it wears off.  Like sports!  Sports is an impersonal topic.”
“Why don’t we lock him in his room?” Thor suggested.  “Then he cannot offend anyone or further embarrass himself.”
“Come on, I never get to lay in a bed,” Tony said.  “I sleep on a mattress of what I’m pretty sure is fungus, lemme in.”
too late for me to save face on this one,” Steve said, flopping back on the bed.  “I only told you how much I wanted it about a million times.”
Tony grabbed him by the elbow.  “Excuse me,” he said, pulling Steve through the crowd, “pardon me, yes, hi, season’s greetings, excuse me, Captain America has something he’d like to talk to Santa about, official Avengers business, if you’ll excuse us?”
Steve stares at Stark.  "A millionaire like you doesn't have anything better to do than dig up the entire background of some guy you just met?"
When Tony frantically sat up and wrenched his facemask off he found that, while he was not currently living his
Peggy had taught him how to do it, back when he’d just arrived and they were building his identity.  He used to watch Natasha do it, when they were on the run, but it worked different in the 1950s, and anyway he couldn’t have explained any of that to Peggy even if he’d wanted to.
“Excuse me, boys,” Natasha said, removing her dripping sunglasses and stepping toward the edge of the pool.  “I have a drowning to facilitate.”
if they’re real lucky, lead to a minor player in Schmidt’s organization, there’s a lot of paperwork to file.
Steve looks up from the torn apart engine to see Stark across the room, a pair of absurdly large glasses perched on his nose, a gasoline-powered blowtorch in his hands, and a grin on his face.  “Glad you could make it.”
“Jarvis’ll make sure everybody clears out.  Or not.  I don’t really care.”  Stark yawns and tosses an arm over Steve’s chest.  “You can stay.  If you want, I mean.  No pressure.  Jarvis makes great pancakes, if you’re into that kind of thing.”
Her mouth twists wryly. "You're a big book. Could take a lifetime to learn. I've only read the first few pages."
“Exactly,” Beck says.  “Look, Jonah, I think anybody who knows Tony Stark knows he’s a genius.  He’s one of the greatest minds of our age, and frankly he’s capable of things most of us can’t even imagine.  But… given that we can’t imagine all of it, I think it would be healthy for all of us if we spent a little more time questioning the things he tells us, the things he says we see with our own eyes.  Every time the world needs saving, the Avengers get a little more powerful, a little more untouchable.  But Jonah, the thing is, I don’t remember the world needing that much saving before Tony Stark decided he was the one who wanted to save it.”
“You think he needs to be?” Natasha glances at the four-door Dodge humming at the sidewalk.  “He’ll kill the man with his bare hands.”
“So I think that means we may have to talk about this more,” Tony said.  “After, you know, we deal with the crazy murder robot who thinks we all need to be wiped off the face of the earth.”
There's only one thing for her, when she's in this kind of mood. She turns, looks both her male employees in the eyes, lets her gaze drift purposefully down their bodies. Pulls them flush against her and kisses Thor, then Clint, keeping a grip on both their ties while she does it. Clint smirks at her as she pulls away, his eyes hooded as she undoes his tie, then his shirt collar.
Steve pauses in his perusal of the items on Stark’s work table, then keeps moving smoothly.  “Well, above all else, it’s not any of your business.”
Steve groaned again, like he had the first time Tony pulled his hair, and Tony may not have been a supersoldier but he could learn too: he pulled Steve’s hair again, harder, and Steve picked up the pace, his tongue sliding around the head of Tony’s cock.  When he looked up at Tony there was a
“It’s definitely not contagious, you just love the sound of your own voice,” Steve said, kissing him again.
It’s a lie, of course, and over the next couple of months Tony does pretty much nothing but prove it.
Tony threw his head back.  “You’re gonna have to stop saying things like that or this isn’t gonna last nearly as long as I’d like it to.”
“I’m serious, you’re done,” Tony snaps.  “In thirty seconds this’ll be considered trespassing, do you really want to know what it’s like to be considered a hostile in Avengers tower?”
“Yeah, yeah, we can do that, we can definitely do that, that is absolutely something that, if you want it, we can - yes,” Tony said, going up on tiptoe to kiss Steve again, “very much yes, lots of yes.”
year for a man who likes to make his living serving drinks to come to America, but it could be worse."
It’s effective, apparently.  Employment has soared in the eighteen months since the Blip, even while Stark Industries shares have sunk.  He wasn’t joking when he told Steve he’s not a billionaire anymore: between the re-start-up costs of his entire consumer products business and the ongoing funding demands on the Maria Stark Foundation, Tony’s coffers are starting to get low.  Not that he cares, and anyway, he can always go back to selling weapons if he has to.
“That’s because there aren’t many to share,” Steve says.  “When Thanos came back to earth to end humanity once and for all, we were able to delay him long enough to recover everyone who was lost.  Our base was destroyed in the process of taking down him and his army.  We lost good people that day.”
They walk through the cement corridors of the underground level of the base and climb the stairs that take them directly out to the landing pad.  "Where are we - "
Tony wasn’t surprised.  For one thing, everyone knew that Steve was usually up with the chickens (proverbially speaking; he was from Brooklyn) and it was approaching 10 am.  And for another thing, Tony was used to his one night stands disappearing in the morning.
“I showed up from the future and asked her to marry me,” Steve said.  “What was she supposed to say?  We eloped with a justice of the peace and a witness we had to pay for.  Every little girl’s dream, right?”
Thor threw him two more, rapid-fire, and Clint immediately dropped them.  “Probably more like five,” Clint admitted.
“You can’t send me to my room,” Clint said.  “You’re not the boss.  Steve, do I have to go to my room?”
something about it in Wakanda instead of just standing around while everybody died.  You think you deserve to be here with the rest of us?  Just sitting around, living off Tony's money and doing nothing?  Because you
Steve picked up a plate of turkey and stuffing and handed it to the next kid in line with a wide smile and a ‘Happy Thanksgiving’ that was surprisingly sincere, considering it was probably the 500th time he’d said it that night.  “If it means that much to you, Tony, sure.”
“No, but I heard there’s talk of you getting voted off the board of your own company for sinking money into job creation projects that’ll never see a penny of profit.”
“Cookie?” Peter says obliviously, holding out a plate to him.  “They’re from my aunt May.  Oh, and she didn’t bake them, she bought them, so they should be fine.  She says hi to everyone, by the way.”
Tony smiles at Morgan in the rearview mirror.  “It’s you, kiddo.  You’re so pretty, they can’t help taking pictures.”
, maybe you should design your phones to stay charged for more than a day, how’s that for an idea - ”
“Well, you’re definitely not like my dad,” Tony admitted, and sent a splash in Steve’s direction.  “Chill out, Cap.  Nobody likes a moody drunk.”
After a silence, Bruce says, “So anyway, I’m guessing you’re going to get a call from your PR team.”
"If we're throwing out flying, then magic has to go too," Scott said.  "And psychic powers.  And whatever the thing in your head is, Vision - "
“Why didn’t you call me?” Steve asks.  “I wouldn’t have stopped you from trying to draw Beck out.  I would have gone with you.  We all would have.”
“Can’t sleep?” Steve jerked his head up at the voice. Tony was coming down the stairs from what Steve assumed was his penthouse.
“I guess we’ll see about that.” Tony stepped closer and Steve held his breath. This was ridiculous. And stupid. And Tony looked gorgeous in his black tank top and mussed hair and challenging smirk. “Lucky for you, I don’t have a working suit right now.”
“I have been having impure thoughts and coveting. I have been having thoughts of death, wishing that I were.” Steve heaved a sigh. “It would have been so much better if I had just... Too damn stubborn to die I guess.”
The church was just as he remembered it. Candles and incense smoke filling the space with a calming filter of gentle smoke. It made the lights seems dimmer and the space feel warm and welcoming. He hadn’t set foot in the church since his mother’s funeral. She would have been disappointed in him but he couldn’t face it. He had even changed his route when walking to work to avoid passing the church. Now he felt a little silly about it. Of course this priest was a lot different than the one from his youth.
“Nothing like the lives of the rich and the famous.” Steve stood as well. “I’ve already seen poor Bruce splashed all over the news and people trying to suss out who Black Widow and Hawkeye are. Just think, soon you’ll be on page two.”
“Please, Cap. Money is literally no object for me. Stock in Stark Industries went through the roof after the battle. Guess seeing me flying around and fighting aliens is good for business. Can’t tell Pepper that though.”
“Wow. I don’t even know how to feel about that.” Tony shook his head and got on one of the treadmills.
“I guess that’ll hafta be our next field trip.” Steve rubbed the back of his neck, still warmer than the rest of him from the touch of Tony’s hands.
“I am out of time. I’m out of place. I don’t belong here, with you and Bruce. Maybe the world needed Captain America 70 years ago. But not now. The world has you. I was trained to fight a war. They never taught me how to make peace.”
“...We all said things we didn’t mean.” Tony shrugged and wished he had never decided to take this guy out for lunch. This was way too...Too much.
“I get the feeling most faces are familiar to you.” She just smirked and pushed off from the wall. “What are you doing here?”
“I’ll try not to scandalize you too much. But I can't make any promises that your old-fashioned values won’t be offended.”
“JARVIS thinks that you might have had a panic attack. From post-traumatic stress. Those are usually triggered by something. Can you think of what might have caused it?”
“Maybe.” Steve leaned back from the bag. He knew he wouldn’t sleep. But he couldn’t stay here and keep smashing Johnny’s bags either. “Thanks, Johnny. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“...You think you’re up for it, soldier?” Tony moved into his personal space and, much like this moment on the Helicarrier, Steve didn’t know if they were talking about fighting anymore. Fondue, fighting, fucking...all the same to him apparently.
“Uh...y-yeah. Guess so.” How could he say no to that? Tony smiled and it wasn’t one of his patented Tony Stark smiles. It was bright and warm and genuine. He leaned into Steve and wrapped his arms around his neck. Steve hesitated briefly but placed his arms around Tony’s waist. It was awkward but so nice. The physical gesture was clearly something that neither of them were used to. But Steve found himself pulling Tony closer to him.
“Aside from the fact that he is...well, he’s too good for me. He’s got a girlfriend. And they’re happy and moving back to California.”
New turned out to be Indian food. A little hole in the wall that Tony had found years ago. Steve had looked at the menu, a bit bewildered, before Tony simply ordered one of everything. Probably the best way to go about finding what he does and doesn‘t like. Though why Tony had decided that was his job was a mystery. Okay. Not much of mystery. The slight scrunch of Steve’s nose as he took a sip of his Coke. Fuck.
“Well, if Pa taught me anything, it was that you gotta do what you have to survive.” Steve shrugged and leaned his shoulder into the couch to better face Tony but still be comfortable. “When Ma died, we were still in the middle of the Depression. Buck and I took whatever jobs we could find.”
“I’ll Take You Home Again, Kathleen.” Steve smiled wistfully. “Guys used to sing it in the bar all the time.”
Steve recognized pieces of the city just as he recognized pieces of himself. But he couldn’t fit himself into a space anymore. Maybe he was missing pieces. Or maybe he had too many. Or the pieces had been warped by age and ice and pain. He didn’t belong in the dingy, bare apartment in Brooklyn. Both too familiar and strange. Even when he had seen the place, he thought it was too big. But then realized how small it really was. Even smaller without Ma or Bucky. And he didn’t really feel like he belonged in Avengers Tower either. Sure, Tony had welcomed him in and given him an entire floor of a building but...
“Catholic church has changed a lot since my last confession.” Steve leaned back and breathed a sigh of relief.
When he finally got his vision back, it was to find Tony with his sweatpants around his thighs and his own cock in his hand. No, this was the moment Steve wanted to remember forever. Tony Stark, his pants around his thighs, his cock hard and straining in his hands, jerking off to the image of Steve coming.
“Fuck, baby...” Tony pulled on his hair and Steve did his best to ignore the spark down his spine again. He started bobbing his head as he took all of Tony into his mouth. Steve had learned a very important trick that the serum had blessed him with. No gag reflex. He moaned around Tony as he sucked him off, gripping his thighs tightly. Probably leave bruises. Steve couldn’t bring himself to care.
“That is something that you must discover on your own. Have faith, son, and God will guide you through this.”
Tony straddled his thighs, still in his black sweatpants. Steve reached for him and ran his hands up his chest. The arc reactor was glowing in the dim light of the living room. Steve loved the way it made Tony’s face look. Casting shadows and making him even more beautiful. He felt Tony stiffen as he slowly traced around the reactor.
“Tough talk?” Tony turned and raised an eyebrow. Steve walked toward him and smirked, cocking his head to the side.
Steve let himself drink Tony in like that first glass of whiskey. Slow, calculated. For all the drinks that Tony had he looked pretty damn lucid. Probably from a lifetime of drinking.  Even now, in the middle of the night, after a few drinks, Tony‘s eyes had a gorgeous spark. Always bright and curious. Maybe instead of concern for Steve, Tony just wanted to solve him. Like Steve was a new puzzle to be taken apart and put back together. Better and more efficient than he had been. Tony Stark, always improving on his father‘s legacy. Never to be outdone by Howard. His eyes trailed down to Tony’s lips. Lips usually curved in an arrogant smirk. But not right now. This was wrong. It was all wrong.
“Don’t.” Steve forced his sluggish body to move and he sat up. He gently took Tony’s wrist and pulled him away from his cock. Steve pushed him down onto the couch, hovering over him. “My turn. Wanna taste you.”
“You said something about Chinese food?” Steve finally found his voice and wondered if he was the only one that could feel this. The air seemed thick. Too heavy to get a real, deep breath. It was all in his head. Just breathe normal you fucking idiot.
God, when was the last time he had really hugged someone like this? It seemed like ages. And technically it was. Steve hadn’t had any human contact in 70 years. Just wrapped up in cold and darkness. Tony was warmth and light and Steve needed to wrap himself up in that. In Tony. But he couldn’t. And he shouldn’t. There were so many reasons why this was a terrible idea. To get so involved in Tony Stark. Why did Steve have to be so drawn to the people he could never be with?
“I was a bartender. They gave me a step stool to stand on. Buck always teased me about it. But I made decent tips. Tell enough sob stories about your dead parents and getting the shit kicked out of you for being short and mix that with enough pints.” Steve shrugged. “Sometimes the dames that came in with their boyfriends would feel sorry enough for me to convince their man to leave a better tip.”
“I’m right here, Steve. You’re okay.” Tony took Steve’s hands in his and squeezed. “Let’s sit down, okay?” Steve nodded and Tony lead him over to a window bench.
“Funny, I was about to say the same about you.”  Steve handed the cigarette back to Johnny. “What are you doin’ here?”
“Thanks, Bruce.” Steve nodded. Bruce gave his shoulder a squeeze and walked out of the gym. Steve and Tony stood in silence for a couple minutes before Tony spoke.
“This is nice...” Tony tightened his grip around Steve and...nuzzled? Was Tony nuzzling his neck? Fuck. Steve closed his eyes and sighed.
“What do you expect from a shady government agency? That’s why you’re at the Tower. With me and Bruce. We’re better people.” Steve laughed and Tony immediately felt better. Stupid crush.
“Sorry, Cap. From another movie we’ll make you suffer through.” His smile faded. Tony moved his hands into Steve’s hair and Steve tilted his head into the touch.
“What now?” Steve looked up at him and for once, he felt like a kid. He didn’t feel like he was 92 anymore. He felt like he was 24 and had just fucked up royally and wanted someone older and wiser and smarter to tell him how to fix it.
“SHIELD doesn’t need Captain America and it sure as hell doesn’t need Steve Rogers.” He looked down at the floor. “Fury wants the public on his side and Captain America is perfect for that. But he needs the Security Council too. Steve Rogers fits the bill for the suits.”
“Actually, I’m up late. Haven’t been to bed yet.” Tony stretched and yawned as if to prove his point. “Been working all night but I hit a wall. Figured some physical activity would let my brain wander and the answer will come to me.”
“Steve? Seriously, what is so damn funny?” Natasha sounded a little irritated. He looked up at her and started laughing all over again.
“And what am I supposed to do about that? It happened. It’s over.” He wished his voice hadn’t trembled there. “Everyone keeps pushing me to live in this century and learn the technology and move forward. But in the next breath, telling me to go to a shrink and relive the whole damn thing over again. They can’t change it. I can’t change it, I can’t forget it, I can’t--” Steve stopped and took a deep breath. “I’m fine, Johnny. Tell Fury that I’m fine. And next time he wants to tell me something, he can tell me himself.”
Tony dozes off during official business - something about an industrial magnate in Argentina who’s making noise about setting up his own ambassadorship in space, sounds like a bad idea, hopefully somebody’s taking care of that - and he doesn’t jerk awake until his elbow slides right off his knee.  “I’m awake,” he blurts out.
is give Tony a list - based on known locations, geo-tracking, technological prowess, and a healthy dose of pure randomized speculation - of people who could plausibly be responsible for the elemental “monsters” that has everybody so riled up.
readings Fury could give us were electrical.  I thought at first that it must hold itself together through some kind of electrical charge, maybe depolarization of its own atoms, but you know what else would cause these kinds of readings?”
having a ton of sex with you?”  He tilted his head, like he was considering it, and then he leaned in and pressed a firm kiss on Tony’s lips.  “I’ll pass.”
“Steve,” Tony said.  “Seriously.  Nothing has to change here.  We can keep going exactly like we always have.  You tell me about your problems, I give you shit, I disappear and we do it all over again a few weeks later.  It’s nice.”
“That part was a little real,” Tony admits.  “But the elemental’s not.  It’s Quentin Beck, he’s got an army of invisible drones and this whole thing was a set up.  But the drones have to be coming from somewhere, they’ll need a power core and an internal network and it can’t be too far away.”
," she repeats emphatically, grabbing his chin and training his gaze on herself, "isn't my business. I don't care. You can keep secrets from me. I won't pry. All I'm trying to do is play a little." She slides her hand up his arm, gives him a gentle squeeze. "You know. For fun."
“Holy shit,” Clint said.  “He played you!  Steve Rogers played you!  Wait, if I sit on that guy’s lap will you get me a Maserati too?”
“Nobody can see us up here,” Stark says.  “But if you’re worried about it, my bedroom is right through there.”  He jerks his head at the second set of french doors leading off the balcony, and Steve’s stomach flips over.  “If you’re interested, that is.”
Tony blinks.  Across the room, Steve is leaning against the wall with his arms crossed over his chest, listening to Sam and Bruce argue about something.  He looks like he’s paying attention but Tony can tell he’s a million miles away by the tension in his jaw, and Tony wants to catch his eye, break him out of whatever rabbit hole he’s going down and bring him back to Earth, maybe make him laugh at something dumb to knock that look out of his eyes -
“I don’t know,” Tony said.  “Nothing, really.  But you can talk to me, if you want.  About - anything, really.  It’s not like I can tell anybody.”
It’s kind of funny, actually, once it becomes clear that nobody’s been injured and the danger has passed; the guy’s knife is tiny, and Steve and Tony are sort of embarrassingly overpowered in comparison, who brings a knife to an Avengers fight?  The police show up eventually, and after a lot of grateful hugs from the woman and selfies with the cops, they finally make it back to Tony’s car, which has not one but three parking tickets on it.
“You live up in your skyscraper with your butlers and your fancy cars and all your money, you got nothin’ to worry about,” Clint says.  “So’s the way I see it, it shouldn’t matter at all to you unless one of these outfits have something on you.”
It was a years-long argument about which Steve was not, even at this particular moment, inclined to yield.  “Do I think feasting before a mission has an impact on performance?  No, I definitely do not.  But everybody’s gotta have dinner.”
"Completely," Steve says.  The back of his neck burns under the fiery gaze of every single person in the joint.
“That seems like a matter for the courts to handle,” Steve says neutrally.  “Why don’t we spend some time talking about all the good work being done by the people of New York to help their friends and neighbors who have struggled since the Blip.  There are so many charities that are in need of - ”
“It’s good to air out the house once in a while.  What’s the use of a childhood home if you can’t use it to get your friends drunk once in a while?”
A hush fell over the game as Barnes swaggered up to the plate.  Everybody liked it when Bucky came up to bat against Steve, because Bucky was the only player to whom Steve would reliably pitch a fastball, which was fair, because for a decent number of the players Steve’s fastball came with prescription drug commercial’s worth of potential side effects.
But this - Steve had the impression of everything getting big, and then bigger, nauseatingly so, and the colors all changed into something that wasn’t on the normal spectrum, and then with one last burst of light -
“Well, if you change your mind, I’m here.  Not all the time, or anything.  Nothing creepy.  Just - I’m here.  And considering I can’t tell anyone…”
Steve opens his mouth to snap back at Tony, but he looks up just in time to see that Tony’s not mocking him at all.  He’s - curious, actually.  He seems to want to really know.
Steve pushes himself to his feet; he’s unsteady, but he holds up his fists and squints through the darkness and -
Tony pushed himself back from the table and walked to the window.  The sun was shining brightly, but he didn’t have a shadow.  Steve wished he hadn’t noticed.
"Of course."  She taps the ash from her cigarette, and his eyes focus in on the orange tip in the dim hallway.  "Rogers came by looking for you tonight.  I sent him away."
“I was actually talking about the winery,” Steve said, waving a hand at the manor behind him.  “But if you wanted to get into a who’s who of hiding things - ”
“I’m good,” Bruce said, taking the deck chair on Natasha’s other side.  “Did you guys see the tiny soaps in the bathroom?  I didn’t think Clint was a tiny soap kind of guy.”
It’s a little awkward when Steve comes back downstairs; he looks between them like he knows something happened but isn’t sure he wants to know what it is.  There’s a big round of goodbye hugs and kisses from Morgan, and Pepper hugs Tony, and then Pepper turns to Steve and hugs him too, and it’s - god, it’s so awkward, but it’s okay too, and Tony’s doesn’t feel great when they get back in the Audi but he feels better than he usually does when he leaves Morgan behind so that’s something.
“Fireworks, then,” Tony said.  “I can probably whip up something that looks like the shield in the next two hours - I could have used a little more time, but what’s a little pyrotechnics between friends - ”
Tony swallowed Steve’s groans as he came, and when his shaking subsided, Tony grinned and then lifted his hand to his mouth and licked it clean.
“Couldn’t quite hear you, Tony, what was that?” Steve said, even though they all knew he had perfect ears.  Perfect hearing.  Whatever, he was - perfect, or something.
"I don't work for those people anymore," Banner says slowly.  "And if your friend still does, he'd probably be better off if he
Steve shrugged, grabbed the last french fry and took his time eating it.  Tony drummed his fingers on the formica table.  A waitress bustled by and didn’t even look at Steve.
a marvel, all tightly-coiled muscle and intense focus and absolutely unbridled enthusiasm for the task at hand, and seeing all of that applied to
They end up with street tacos on a bench at Brooklyn Bridge Park that smells faintly of piss.  If it’s a date, it’s quite possibly the least successful of Tony’s life, and that includes the one where he took out the governor’s daughter and ended up getting them both arrested at the Canadian border (ah, to be eighteen again).
“Okay,” Steve said.  “And, uh - I have to guess that my older self will be appreciative if we don’t mention what happened earlier today.  Ever.”
It’s not a date, so Tony wears a Guns ‘N’ Roses t-shirt and jeans and then agonizes over that decision all the way to Brooklyn, but it’s not like he’s
“Not that I’m not super into this, but just for the record, I still think it’s probably a bad idea,” Tony says.
Steve laughed, out of surprise and confusion and something else he couldn’t quite place and didn’t want to think about too hard.  “Sure, Tony.”
“I’m pretty sure the first offense of the night was you suggesting we go skinny dipping,” Tony said, holding Steve’s gaze.
“Okay,” Peter says.  “But like, friends like me and Ned are friends, or friends like me and MJ are friends?  Because look, I’ve had a crush on MJ forever and I’m not really into dudes but if Captain America looked at
"It's pretty deep," Banner says.  "I know you don't want to draw attention, but it might be worth seeing a doctor who can - "
Stark’s armband blows a hole in the ceiling, and plaster rains down on them.  “That could have gone better,” he says thoughtfully, and dives out of the way of an approaching goon.
“I can definitively say I do not need a toothbrush,” Tony said.  “In fact, my problem is that I have too many toothbrushes.  My cup runneth over with toothbrushes.”
There is a long silence.  Everyone is thinking about what it would take, about how much and how little there is to say; about whether they could handle it themselves, if somebody did it to them.
Clint placed a hand over his eyes like a swooning damsel.  “Please, god, tell me I’m in a nightmare.”
