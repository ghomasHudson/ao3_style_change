“It’s not my cat,” Sam said, and Steve put an arm between them before Bucky could go for his throat.
Strange plowed through the wall, leaving a trail of glittering sparks in his wake.  The wall closed up behind him, shuddering back into place as soon as his cape was clear.  “We’re having-” Strange ducked as the massive staircase shifted a foot to one side, the carpet hopping free of the wood for an instant.  Strange gave it a stern look.  “Stop that.”  He flicked his fingers in that direction, and the staircase rattled back into place, the stairs rising and falling like piano keys.  “You are an embarrassment.”
Steve thought about that.  "I'm willing to blame the post flight adrenaline if you are," he said, and Tony stared to laugh out loud, great, uneven bursts of laughter that bent him double.  Steve grinned at him, fear melting away in the face of that.  "Or Doom.  It's not fair, but it's very practical, and he probably won't even bother to deny it."
His voice trailed away, and he risked a glance in Tony’s direction.  Tony was standing there, his face blank, his coffee cup held in front of his lips.  After a moment, he took a sip, the cup lingering against his mouth.  “Right.” He smiled at Steve.  “Someone.”
“You are a saint,” Tony said into his pillow.  One arm emerged from the blankets, his fingers making grabbing motions at the air.
Tony opened his mouth.  Closed it.  “Sure.”  He drained the rest of his water and leaned over, setting the glass on the steps.  “But I'm not sweeping.”
DJ shoved the pillow off the side of the bed, just for the satisfaction of hearing the soft ‘flump’ sound it made when it hit the ground.
“Seems like a pretty good plan,” Steve said. He held up the ladle, and she handed over her bowl for a refill.
“Oh, please, I've held entire conversations with you while you've been unconscious,” Pepper said.  “Your medical files points out that just because you're talking doesn't mean that you have a pulse.”
Miss Potts studied him.  “You,” she said at last, her lips curling in a smile, “are going to be trouble.”
Shiro poured the noodles into the broth with a twist of his wrist and reached for the bins of toppings.  He added neat piles of sliced green onion, bean sprouts, seaweed and a fishcake, then sliced an egg in half with a quick flick of his knife.  He settled the halves against the bed of noodles and set the bowl on the counter in front of Peter.  “Enjoy,” he said, pushing the jar of disposable chopsticks into reach.
“Please let me dress you,” she said, her eyes huge and liquid.  “I'm begging you.”  Her lower lip poked out.  “At least for the next few months.”
Slowly, gently, Iron Man pulled them out of freefall, slowing their descent.  As they approached the ground, Iron Man shifted his grip, catching the straps of DJ’s backpack from behind, and swung him back into an upright position with practiced grace.
Okay, so the previous five tries hadn’t worked, Tony had either hadn’t been close enough, or had gotten distracted, or someone else had been closer, but Steve was stubborn and the night was still young.  He could absolutely do this.
Tony resisted the almost overwhelming urge to reach up and smooth his hair back into place.  He wondered if it felt as soft as it looked, and it was inappropriate, it was dangerous, but it was the least of what he'd caught himself wondering about Officer Rogers in the past few days.
Clint considered that.  “Okay, one?  The con wasn’t that big.  And two?  SHIELD employs more than half of the people on that list.”
Tony grinned.  "You might change your mind after you hear my wallet's in my other suit."  He tapped a finger against the chestplate of the armor.  "The one with pockets."
DJ looked up to find her studying him, a faint smile on her face.  “Can’t control anything,” he said.
“I'm going to let you have this one,” Tony agreed, squinting down at his phone.  He stopped.  “Goddamn it.”
“Why not.  Combines all the kid's favorite things, like eating and not having to put on decent clothes with all of your favorite things, like not being down here and not having to make small talk with people,” Tony pointed out.
"This is unacceptable," Stark said, even as a plate was placed in his hands by May, overflowing with chicken and potato salad.  He stood there, clutching it in both hands, as if he wasn't sure what to do with it.  "Are you all-"
“So I need pants and he needs to-” Steve gave him a once over. Naked was a good look on Tony. Naked was a very, very good look on him. He sucked in a breath. “Tony needs to keep his pants.”
He reached for DJ, for Steve, but he was moving, he was being moved.  He let out a howl, even as the car door opened and he was dragged in, fighting the entire way.
“Cut it out, both of you,” Steve said, his voice pitched low.  He smiled at Jan, who smiled back at him from beneath the fuzzy brim of a very impressive hat.  “I take it we’ll be talking about the holiday party today?”
Tony pushed away from the bannister, disappearing into his office, and rage swept over Steve like a wave.
Tony nodded.  “Thank you,” he repeated, and on some level he registered the look that passed between Bobbi and Steve, but he didn’t stop, didn’t even slow down.  Bobbi pulled the kitchen door open, holding it while they stepped past her.  When they were safely inside, she closed the door again, sealing them in.
The cop hadn't gotten any less attractive since Tony had seen him last, and that was somehow infuriating.  Tall and well built, with broad shoulders and narrow hips, he cut an impressive figure, even in his slightly worn uniform.  He had a face that would've been painfully gorgeous, if not for his ever-present scowl.  He met Tony's eyes without flinching, obviously neither impressed nor intimidated.
Tony’s face relaxed.  “Tell me the truth, Rogers,” he said, his hand coming up to cover Steve’s.  “Have you ever had a bed large enough to make a ‘favorite side’ necessary?”
“But mostly tequila,” Tony agreed with a grin.  He drained the cup and tossed it over his shoulder.  “Like I said.” He stood, ignoring the way the world shifted under him.  “I gave up.”
“Someone give me coffee or I’m going back to bed, I’ve slept in way worse than this,” Clint said, stumbling out of his bedroom.  Tony looked over, checking to see if his eyes were open.  The mostly weren’t, but that wasn’t slowing him down.
Steve lifted his arm just far enough to aim a look in Tony's direction.  “When it's a gun, I usually get to have the shield,” he said, his voice dire.  “And I'd really like to stop discussing this now.”
Tony watched him, one eyebrow arching.  “Maybe some food to go with that,” he suggested, as Obie tossed back the rest of the whiskey in one gulp.
“Sorry,” Sam said, not sounding sorry at all.  “Didn’t see you there.”  He stepped around Bucky.  “Anyone had a look at the hearth?”
“Sorry, we’re all out,” Tony said, smirking at Clint over the rim of his coffee cup.  “I guess you should’ve gotten up earlier.  Next time-”
“No,” DJ said.  Steve pressed a kiss to the top of his head, and DJ’s head tipped back, smiling up at him.  His eyes were red, and Steve ruffled his hair until he laughed.
“Good,” she said, her teeth sinking into her lower lip.  “Good.”  She took a step back, her skirts floating in her wake.  “If you’re free later tonight, we were going to play a round of pool, and I made everyone else promise not to say anything embarrassing.”
Tony waited.  Steve didn’t volunteer anything else, and he sighed.  “Yeah, so do I, so cough it up, Rogers.”
Tony's pulse was pounding in his ears, hard and fast, almost blocking out everything else.  He couldn't think about it, he couldn't even begin to think about that, or he'd lose his mind, and this was not the time or place for that.  He tucked his hands in his pockets, so no one could see how they shook.  "Well, to be honest," he said, and his voice was steady, was faintly amused, "I only married you because I got sick of waiting for Beyoncé to dump Jay Z."
"Hey," Tony said.  He picked up a piece of toast, holding it out to DJ.  "Don't do that."  He managed a smile.  "There's always going to be food, okay?  You can-"  He stopped, taking a deep breath.  "You don't have to do that."
“Who invited you?” Jan asked, but Sam was already sprinting out of the kitchen, leaving a trail of coffee on the floor behind him.  Jan glared at the door.  “I suppose he can be trusted.”  Her eyes slid back to Steve as she collected her plate and cup from the table. “I take it Tony doesn't know you're down here asking about this?”
A flicker of something went over Tony’s face, something that Steve couldn’t identify.  As quickly as it had come, it was gone, and Tony smiled up at him with blank, shuttered eyes.  “Your job is lousy, Steve.  You’re a broken cog in an even more broken system.”
Tony shrugged.  “He made it clear his life was none of my concern,” he said, just as cutting.  “He made his bed.  Let him sleep in it.”
Tony went back to looking at the creature.  It stopped, and started rolling sideways, the movement at a 90 degree angle to the way that it was previously heading.  Tony looked back at Peter.  Peter gave him a brave smile.  "Ninety percent certain that it's a cat."
Tony scraped a hand over his face.  "There's going to be consequences to this, Steve.  It's not like we get divorced-" Steve flinched, his body going tense in an instant.  Tony smiled at him.  "Sorry."
The timer went off, and he reached for the steamer basket.  “Sorry if you’re creeped out by it,” he said, shaking the florets gently into the ice water bath. “I liked it.  And it seemed appropriate.”
“I am pleased to hear it.” Clea set the cake plate down on the workbench, right next to Bruce’s work.  She didn’t seem to notice the way he flinched.  She looked up at Tony, her expression sympathetic.  “I have no news, I fear.”
“Not here,” Steve said.  He sounded like he was strangling.  “Not-  Not here, Tony.”  He grabbed Tony’s hand.  “Let’s go.”
Jesse shrugged.  “So, know what they were financing with donations last night?” she asked.  Ellen just stared at her.  “Marriage licenses.”  She shoved a hand through her hair.  “It's one of the main stumbling blocks to actually, you know, getting married.  Symkaria doesn't have a waiting period, or even blood tests, but they make sure people think hard about getting married by making it really expensive.”
Tony’s head fell back.  “And what possible good can you do?” he asked, and he sounded tired.  “One man, against everything this city decides to throw at you, how many people do you think you can save?”
Shiro held up his hands, muttering something unintelligible under his breath in Japanese.  He grabbed  noodles from the tray, curling them into a neat pile in the palm of his hand and dropping them into the basket before plunging it into the boiling water.  “Needs to sit.”
“Is this because I left the laundry in the washer machine and it’s probably a ball of mildew and hate by now?”
“First-” Tony stalked around him and grabbed a box from the shelf, tossing it down on the counter.  It bounced hard on the wood, and Hank glared at him.  Tony arched an eyebrow. “That wasn’t flirting.”  Hank snorted, and Tony ignored him.  “Second, yes.”
“And then we went for ramen and the chef knew you and kept giving you sake and I got an egg in my ramen, like, a special egg,” Peter said, sounding proud of that, “and Clint did the ramen challenge and that was horrible and-”
“I understand.  If you decide on a more technological approach…”  His words trailed away.  He knew better than to push.
Steve leaned against the wall, his head back, his eyes burning.  He took a deep breath, and another, trying to get himself back under control.
“Which is fairly obvious, as you spend your life alone, in a basement,” Steve said.  Pepper made a sound that might’ve been a choked off laugh.  Tony’s head snapped up, and Steve gave him a pleasant smile. “With the occasional visitor, who exists to be expelled as soon as possible.”
She let out a soft laugh, her head shaking.  “You’re too clever by half again,” she said, but she turned to face him, her arms crossed over her chest.  “If there were old ones here, Stevie, I would think they’d long since been driven from this place, where there’s nothing green left, and precious little sky.  The steel and stone covered this island, long, long ago.”
Nebula didn’t look up from her design work.  “Yeah,” she said, her voice emotionless.  “That’s what we do here.  We’re a tattoo shop.  That’s what it says on the sign.”
“I mean, I've always thought so.”  Tony braced his hands on the edge of the bed, leaning forward just a bit.  “Still.” He smiled at Steve.  “Thanks.  For putting me to bed.”
Tony exhaled.  “No.  You wouldn’t.”  He reached out, his hand closing on one of hers, and it was so small.  He marveled at that, every time, how small her hands were, and how strong they were despite that.  “We have a few days.  Let me see... “  He leaned forward, his forehead brushing against hers.  “I’ll figure something out.”
“I mean, that’s possible, but improbable, because I’m very competitive,” Tony said, his voice flat, and Steve choked on a laugh.  “There we go, that’s much better.”  He twisted his head to the side, just far enough to meet Steve’s eyes.  “So.  We had a tough couple of days, did we?”
Natasha measured several cups of flour into a mixing bowl, her movements quick and efficient.  "We tried to rob the place," she said, with a wry smile.  "It didn't go so well."
DJ made it halfway through the movie before he snuggled up in Tony’s coat, his eyes at half mast.  Not long after that, his breathing smoothed out, his head lolling to the side.  He was sound asleep long before the credits rolled, and even the lights coming back up did nothing to rouse him.
Tony's shoulders twitched in something like a shrug.  “For being like this,” he said, and Steve's chest ached.
“Okay, but I’m the only one here who asked someone out and got a date out of it in the last like, year, so-”
"How could I forget?" she asked, her eyes dancing.  She looked at Tony.  “If you’re done with your hiring, we should be heading in?”
Steve leaned back against the side of his truck, trying to take some of the pressure off of his aching feet.  “God, I wish,” he said, exhausted.  He leaned his head back, squinting up at the pale blue sky.  The sun was barely up, the skyline lit with a golden glow, and he tried to take pleasure in that.
Steve stared at him.  Tony met his gaze without blinking, those remarkable, beautiful eyes locked on Steve’s.  “Did I?”
Sam’s head bobbed in a nod as they came around the corner of the path.  “Pretty sure a large part of the population also has them about Tony,” he said, making Steve laugh.  Sam grinned.  “That’s just an estimate, of course, I don’t have any published papers or peer-tested research to cite here.”
Steve reached for his sketchbook.  “I have a…”  He shook his head.  “Let’s just say I have a…  Previous engagement tomorrow.”  He looked up at Tony.  “Raincheck?”
The commercial sign flashed, and Morrison surged to his feet. “Well, that was quite a piece of grandstanding,” he gritted out, and Steve smiled at him.
Steve stopped, his eyes narrowing as he considered the question.  “I don't know,” he said at last, with an easy smile.  “I had favorites when I was a kid.  Adventure books, and science fiction.  Books about cowboys and war reporters.”  His smile stretched.  “There was one, about a cabin boy who ended up being captured by pirates?  I don't remember the title, but I checked that out so often that the librarians just started putting my initials, rather than my full name on the card.”
“There is nothing he could do to harm you, and a careless, cruel word from you could ruin his life, and you well know it,” Jarvis said.  He reached out, taking the cup from Tony and dropping it on the tray, ignoring it when the coffee splashed over the rim.  “He took a very real risk in trusting you, in trusting everyone here, and you will respect that.”
She smiled.  “It took me a moment to realize that he meant Peter.  I didn’t even have a chance to reply.  He looked up at me, and said, ‘It’s not natural for a kid to be that quiet.’”
“And you were prepared for that with a picture of-”  Tony gestured at the screen.  “What IS that, kid?”
“No.  In that you can't be trusted,” Pepper said, her voice saccharine.  “I'm already in the car on my way over, Tony, so let's skip to the part where you agree with something close to grace.”
“I-” Peter swallowed, his throat bobbing.  “I thought that-”  He looked at Steve. “I thought that you’d want to talk to me,” he said, desperation creeping into his voice.  “I thought that you’d need to talk to me.  While I can still-” His eyes darted to the side, his shoulders hitching up.  “I think I can remember-”  He stopped.  “I can remember, and I’m afraid if I fall asleep, then I’ll forget, I have to tell you before-”
Steve's cheeks went pink.  “Look, I asked the girl in the bookstore for a popular comic, because-” Tony just stared at him, his eyebrows arched.  Steve leaned forward.  “Give me that.”
The cat gave him a disdainful look and flopped over, spreading its bulk over the top of Tony's pillow.  Behind it, DJ was waiting, his face hopeful.
“Yes, how odd that the police don't ask us if we want them to investigate our crimes,” Natasha mused.
He looked up to find Jarvis watching him, a faint, unreadable smile on his face.  “They are toys,” Jarvis said, his voice soft and gentle.  “And ought to be played with, not left to rot for an owner that may never exist, Officer Rogers.”  His eyes fell away and he flicked the handkerchief, releasing a burst of dust to float through the sunlit air.  “All it needs is a bit of soap and water and a good, quick scrub.”
“Because this is going to happen,” she said, her voice flat.  “So I'd like to...”  Her lips pursed.  “Minimize the damage.”  She shifted in her seat, just a little, her fingers flexing on her bag.  “My intent is to try to do right by the child, to see if we can't find him a permanent home with one Mr. Stark's employees.”
The smile broke over Steve's face with slow, inevitable force of the sunrise.  “I'll keep that in mind,” he said, starting the bike with a twist of his wrist.  “Hop on.”
The doorknob turned before he could even reach for it, the door swinging open, just an inch or two, before creaking to a stop.  DJ peered through the crack of the door.  “Hello?” he called.  The single word echoed, rattling around the room in a way that made goosebumps break out along the length of his arms.  DJ’s fingers slid across the wood of the door.  It was strangely warm.
“Yeah, that's not going to stop,” Tony said against Steve's shoulder.  He raised his head, just far enough to smirk at Bucky.  “His ass is a work of art.  I can't be expected to keep my hands to myself.”
“No,” Tony said, because there was no way that question could end well.  “Just…  Just get a cab and I’ll pry the goddamn cleaning equipment out of his hands.”
“Well, that’s a damn lie, Phil,” Clint said.  He gave Phil a slight, lopsided smile, and it was soft and easy, and Phil smiled back.  “Dinner?”
“Yes, yes, he can,” Steve said.  He leaned back, glancing in Tony’s direction as he loaded bins into the refrigeration unit.  “Stop trying to take him to fancy places, Tony.”
“Oh, I stretched while I was waiting for you,” Sam said, hands in the pockets of his windbreaker.  “Had some time.  I actually expected you to be moving a little earlier, honestly.”
“He was up the majority of the night,” Jarvis said, his voice pitched low.  “Examining the remains of the bomb for SHIELD Scientific.”
“Mostly I'm going to punch the shit out of something, but I guess I can work in making snide comments between punches,” Jessica said, her head tipped to the side.
“I can talk to him and drive,” Tony said, his voice coming from a distance, and the sound of blaring horns in the background put lie to that.  Tony yelled something, and Steve was pretty sure that was an obscenity.  “Give me the phone, Parker.”
Tony reached for his coffee.  “From Steve?” he asked, and DJ nodded.  Tony made what he hoped was an approving sound behind his cup.  “Good.  That’s…  Good.”  He was proud of himself.  That sounded almost sincere.  Or as close to sincere as anyone could expect from me.
Steve took a breath.  "No," he said, and he tried to smile.  He needed to smile.  "Tony is bi.  I'm gay."
"Society can reach a consensus," Steve agreed. "But anyone locked out of that consensus, who didn't get to be in on the decision making process? They're not required to hold to it. After all, silence that is chosen by a person, for their own protection or privacy, is different than silence that is forced on a person, or a group, via social pressure."
Rogers' hand dropped back to his side, but his mouth was still twitching, his eyes dancing.  “Steve,” he said.
Stark nodded.  “Wouldn’t have it any other way.”  He tipped his head to the side, and Rogers met him halfway, their kiss half hidden from Tony’s view by the faceplate of the armor.
Hulk tossed himself up and onto the landing pad, his feet hitting with enough force to make it shake.  Neither he nor DJ seemed to notice.  He padded over, his face set in stern lines.  DJ met him halfway, stopping right in front of the Hulk.  "Okay?" he repeated.  He blinked hard, his face worried.  What few words he could manage seemed to stumble out of him with a great deal of effort.  "Hurt?"
“You need to go to bed,” Steve said, and Tony’s smile took on a wicked edge.  Steve laughed.  “You.  You need to go to bed.  And we’ll-”  Tony kissed him, and Steve forgot what he was trying to say.  “Bed,” he managed, the word whispered against Tony’s lips.
Dummy disappeared, and came back up, a thick file folder in his claw.  Tony reached for it, and Dummy rolled backwards, holding it out of reach.  “ Is that one of mine?”
“It’s a highly horrible website,” Tony shot back, vanilla and chocolate mixing with the smell of his skin.  With one hand, he hit a few keys.  “Okay, I think they’re asking how many guests?”
Tony lifted his arm to wave them in, and winced as his ribs protested the movement.  He set his bowl aside, wrapping an arm around his middle.  “I thought you’d be asleep by now,” he said.  DJ tugged free of Peter, picking his way across the floor to lean against the side of the bed.  Tony reached out, his fingers brushing over DJ’s hair.  A tension that he hadn’t even been aware of bled out of him.
Another knock on his door, a little louder this time, a little more urgent, and Steve pushed himself up into a sitting position.  “Goddammit, Hogan,” he muttered into the darkness.  “This had better be important.”
“Conspiracies everywhere,” Tony said, as Clint walked past, Darcy adjusting the ribbons of his flower crown in his wake.  It was red and yellow with silver ribbons, a perfect match for the tacky Iron Man Halloween costume.  “I’m going to have to file a cease-and-desist here.”
DJ, stuffing the last crust of his bread into his mouth, nodded.  Rolling to his feet, he collected the book, closing it carefully and returning it to Tony's desk.  Tony smiled at him.  “You done with that?  Should I put it back, or do you want to keep looking at it?”
Duck nodded.  “They could make a mint with a reality tv show,” he agreed.  He straightened up, his narrow shoulders going straight beneath the rumpled fabric of his shirt, and set his pen down, the movement strangely final.  “But the answer's no.  You've got circumstantial evidence and a lot of supposition, and it might be true, but we're not going to be the ones to put our neck out there and publish it first.”
There was a moment of silence, and then the door opened, DJ peeking around the barrier.  He was wearing a pair of pajama pants and a ragged t-shirt that Tony was pretty sure he recognized.  His feet were bare, his toes burrowing into the carpet.  “Yes,” he said, and Tony smiled at him, affection sweeping over him in a wave.
He made a face, and that hurt, too.  His head was throbbing.  He risked opening one eye.  “What…  Wait.  Which infirmary?”
Steve stalked past the car, his shoulders squared.  “Don’t need a ride,” he said, and Natasha stepped in front of him.
That by the time the car screeched to a stop in front of his building, both other their hands ached.  And neither of them wanted to let go.
Tony grinned.  “Well, worse choices have been made around these parts.”  He paused. “What are you doing?”
“God, no, I'm fucking exhausted, I haven't slept in like-” He rotated a hand in mid-air.  “Two days now?  I don't even know, it's exhausting, I'm exhausted, and it's your fault.”
Franklin pushed himself up into a sitting position, his eyes narrowed into slits.  “I like girls just fine,” he said.  “You're not a girl.  You're a SISTER.”
He glanced into the kitchen.  “Then I come here.  My kid's artwork's on your fridge,” he said.  “And that's it.”  He looked back at Steve.  “If we break up, it'd leave such a-”  He shook his head.  “A hole in my world.  You're so deeply embedded in my life, that if you leave, it'll just leave this gaping empty space and I don't know if I can fill that again, because you're everywhere, you're part of my life, a big part of it.”
“I could eat,” Tony said.  He flopped back into his chair, his legs thrown out in front of him, his head falling back.  He frowned up at the ceiling. “I probably should eat.”
Tony took a deep breath.  "Did you enjoy destroying your clock?" he asked DJ.  DJ nodded, both hands cradling the toast now.  Tony smiled at him.  "Good.  I think I'm going to need your help for a slightly larger project this morning."
Tony struggled against a smile.  “Thank you.  That's very comforting.” There was a knock at the library door, and he looked up.  “Come in.”
“Still in the back seat,” Clint said.  “Texting in a very angry manner.”  He waved them off.  “Go ahead.  I’ll get him.”
“She'll be up in a moment, she was helping the Chef check the greenhouse,” Pepper said.  Together, they watched Jarvis and Rogers head up the stairs, both of them bent protectively over DJ.  Tony exhaled, and Pepper gave him a look out of the corner of her eyes.  “Don't.”
“I’d say ‘worrying,’” Pepper said.  She was reading over Jan’s shoulder, her eyes narrowed into slits.  “Very worrying.”
“Bucky’ll go with him,” Shuri said, grinning.  She tossed her bottle to Bucky, who snagged it out of midair.
Tony stumbled, and Rogers' hand shot out, steadying him with a firm grip. For an instant, they were both still, a little too close, a little off balance.  Tony pulled back, pulling his arm free from Rogers' fingers.  “I don't know what you're talking about,” he said, his voice smooth and calm.  “There was a little accident with a tiller a few years ago.”  He took a step back, tucking his hands in his pockets.  “Should've replaced the gate entirely, but it seemed like a waste.”
Smiling, Steve stroked a hand up and down along the length of Tony's breastbone, waiting for his labored breathing to smooth out before he closed his eyes.  “I think I'm going to need some help.”
“I’m sure he’ll be relieved to hear it.” Strange gestured behind him, light flaring around his hand, and the portal opened, flickering into place.  He paused on the threshold.  “Get some sleep.  Please.”
“I don't think you're cute at all,” Tony told him.  Bucky made kissy faces at him.  “Right, now, now you're actively freaking me out.”
“Well, it’s the end of the year, so I’ve got a lot of files that need to be sorted and stapled.” He shrugged out of his jacket and opened the closet door, reaching for a hanger.  “Thought you might be able to help me.”
“Yes,” Rhodey said, his voice flat.  While Tony was still staggering under of the weight of that betrayal, he turned his attention to Pepper.  “I'm guessing that if we're discussing Tony's love life, that means we found him?”
Steve met Tony’s eyes.  “You have protected him.  You know you have.  There are trusts on top of trusts that make sure he will never, ever have to worry about paying his rent or having his electricity turned off.”
“She considers this a personal failing on your part,” Sam told him.  He leaned back in his chair, bracing one foot on the side of Steve's bed.  “And she wants you to know that the reception's going off as planned, even if she has to strap you to a stretcher and drag you there herself.”
Steve picked the blankets up off the floor, shaking them out.  “Nothing to be sorry about,” he said, covering Tony back up before heading back around to the other side of the bed.
"True!" DJ said, hopping back towards the blender.  Without even looking, Tony snagged him by the back of his shirt, dragging him to a protesting halt.  DJ's head tipped up.  "Smoothie?"
Steve spared a quick look over at DJ, who had plopped down on the lawn, his head tipped back to stare up at the stars.  Safe.  He was safe.  Steve looked back at Tony.  “Will you come back up the stairs with me?” he asked, choosing the words carefully.  “We can keep an eye on him from the porch.”
“Don’t you dare, I’m hiring a caterer,” Jan said.  She looked at Natasha.  “Are you going to help me out here?”
“My-” Tony's mouth dropped open.  “Are you-  I don't have a type.”  He spotted Rhodey heading in their direction, and turned his attention to him. “Rhodey.  Do I have a type?”
“Good try.  Off with you, I’ve left your books in the library, and-”   Far below them, a bell started tolling,  with a slow and measured tempo, and Strange stopped.  He held up a hand.  “Excuse me for a moment.”
“And there is this terrible, terrifying moment, when you are at the end of your proverbial rope, when you realize, he’s smarter than you.”
Tony's breath came out as a laugh.  "Right."  He started forward, and this time, they let him.  "Luke's with her?"
“You okay?” Clint asked, and Tony waved him off.  “Right.  DJ’s picked out a place.  Probably as good as we’re going to get, and since you weren’t answering your texts-”
“I’ve got two catagories I can put you in,” Fury continued as if he hadn’t said a word.  “One, Stark’s problem.”
“It’s a Christmas movie,” Sam said, balancing his cup of tea on his plate and picking up the pot.  “Egg Rolls?”
“Hey, Rogers,” the boy said, giving Steve a gap-toothed grin.  “DJ sent us chocolate, didja know that?”
“Right.”  Happy put the basket down with a sigh, bracing his hands on the small of his back.  “Harvest help can’t come soon enough, I haven’t enough hands to keep up with it.”
“No, it’s-”  Tony pressed a hand to his face as Steve started to laugh.  “It’s time for you to open your presents, Deej.”
His breath whispered out of him, a last silent prayer to some unknown deity, and folded himself down and around, putting the bulk of his shoulder, of his chest, of his body, between DJ and the next shot.
Tony grinned at him.  “What, you can't make it back to Brooklyn?  Am I that irresistible?” he whispered.
“And then Parker came out and deleted your video, thinking it was mine.  And then later, are around-” Tony checked the timestamp on the video.  “Three am, you went back to my computer and uploaded what you THOUGHT was a video of you in your underwear, singing Baby Shark to my YouTube channel.”
Steve pulled his phone from his pocket, walking up the hallway towards the elevator.  ‘Movie tonight?’ he sent to Sam as he stepped on.
“Look, I’m busy here,” Nebula said.  “And while I appreciate the rather obscene tip you gave me last night, Tony, I’m not doing any more work on you until that heals up, so you can call us in a week or so and make another appointment if you-”
“You’re out,” Greer said.  She drained the last of her juice and stood.  “And if you shoot me, I’m going to shoot you back.”  She put her cup in the dishwasher.  “You useless, useless lesbian.”
Bucky filled his bowl, picking around the kettle with the ladle to transfer a few prime bits to Shuri’s bowl as well.  “Don’t think she has.”
He barely had time to react before Clint came crashing through the crowd, leaving chaos in his wake.  In one smooth, fluid motion, he skidded to a stop in front of Tony.   “What are you-” Tony resisted the urge to give him a swift, hard kick in the ass.  “Jesus, Barton!”
“There you go,” Tony told him.  “The kid likes books, you like books, books, sandwiches, soda, it's easy to do and no one has to find shoes.”
"Shut the door," Duck said, and Jesse shut the door. He looked back at Rogers. "Wanna stick around? That's the quickest I've ever gotten him to stop talking."
Behind him, Steve, Sam and Peter were doing their best to follow Luke as he moved smoothly through the steps, his thumbs hooked in the belt of his pants.  He was leaning so far back that he seemed to be prepping for a limbo contest, rather than a country line dance.  Jess was lipsyncing along to the song, with Carol, Clint and Thor acting as backup singers, their hips swaying and their heads bobbing along to the beat.
DJ thought about that.  Then he gave Tony a thumbs up.  Tony pinched the bridge of his nose.  "You got stuck in a corner for three days once, Deej."
Jarvis nodded.  “Then will you send him back?” he said, his voice soft.  “For however long it takes you to buy an orphanage?  Will you-”
"I'm going to take mine inside," Stark said, and Natasha, kneeling on the other side of the quilt, poured wine into a tin cup.  She held it up to him without even looking in his direction, and he took it, the movement conditioned.  He juggled the things in his hands, trying to get a grip on it without dropping anything else.  "Wonderful, one step above drinking straight out of the bottle, are we-"
“I don’t have the attention span for blackmail,” Jess said, peering over Carol’s shoulder.  “Can we get churros?”
Steve wrapped his jacket around Tony’s shoulders.  “And you should’ve had your coat on in the car,” he said, coaxing Tony back into his arms.
She nodded.  “I can do that,” she agreed. There was a slight pause, then she added, “It was not my intent to make you uncomfortable.”
Tony winced.  “Right.  Right.”  He took a deep breath.  “That might've been a mistake.”  His head fell back.  “Not my first.  Won't be my last.  But it may well be my most impressive. You know.  For this week.”
Tony tapped him on the nose, once, and then twice.  “Diagnostic over for now.  But if you ever need another one, and we don’t figure that out, then you can do that, right?”  He repeated the gesture.  “One, and two.  That means something’s wrong and we need to figure out what it is.”
He was filling the first cup when he heard footsteps pounding across the polished tile of the entryway.  “Morning,” he said, looking back over his shoulder.  “There's coffee if you-”
“‘Cause I’m bored a lot,” Bucky admitted.  Something was rattling in the background of the call, and Steve had a sneaking suspicion it was the door to his fridge.  “And fighting with idiots on the internet is a cheap and unlimited source of amusement.”
“He’ll barely notice,” Jan said.  She wound her arms around Tony’s neck, giving him a very familiar pout.  “I’ll just hide the papers from him for a week and by the time it blows over, he’ll have moved on to another project and won’t even notice the divorce filing.”
“The POINT,” Tony said, “is that, honestly, we had reason to think that it was just another photo spot that they'd set up, and-”
A shirt was draped across Tony’s shoulders, hanging open and loose against his chest and pooling around his hips.  The rest of him was bare, and the firelight gilding every inch of his skin, and casting sparks along the dark threads of his hair.  There was a blanket beneath him, spilling across the cold marble of the hearth and onto the floor.
“I suppose I could spare a slice or two,” Steve agreed, covering the loaves with a cloth and setting the dough to rise near the warmth of the oven.  “I've got cherry and raspberry preserves.”
Harris pulled Darcy’s hair away from her face, smiling down at her.  “How long have you been awake?” he asked, his voice amused, and DJ slipped out of the room.
"You got here first and you went in alone, and they want to know who your date is," Tony said.  "Let me guess, you got here, glared at them, and plowed through the front door."  Steve stared in sullen silence at the chair opposite him.  Tony sighed.  "Right.  So.  They're going to wait here, until your date shows up."
“I am asking the camera, Parker, but since it’s not answering, fuck it, yes, you can give me your best guess.” Tony flopped back into his seat, all loose limbs and easy grace.  He pushed a hand through his hair and almost fell sideways out of the seat.  “Is this on?”
Jarvis frowned.  “Sir.  I'm deeply wounded by your distrust.”  Mrs. Parker came out on the patio, drying a massive glass jar with a towel as she walked, and he looked in her direction.  “Mrs. Parker, have we any coffee?”
“No, you should’ve told me, because this is-”  Tony realized he was smiling.  He shook his head.  “Steve.  This is a problem that has a solution.”  He held up his hands, and Steve reached for one of them.  Tony fended him off with an elbow.  “Give me a second to work, Rogers.”
Tony nodded.  “I’m sorry,” he said, and for some reason, Steve believed him.   His thumb smoothed over the crystal face of the watch.  “Did-”
“Excellent. I expect you to say that at my funeral. It's in the will, if you want to inherit, you need to saw some nice things about my lovemaking skills,” he said. “Also my ass.”
Hank snapped back towards the counter, the stool scraping against the floor.  “Two things you cannot resist,” he said, holding up two fingers.  “One.  A pretty face.  And two?  Anything shiny someone tells you that you can’t touch.”
“Hey.  Stay inside,” Steve called, but it was too late.  Before he could say another word, DJ had wiggled through the narrow gap and disappeared out into the night.
“Vintage porn,” Tony said, thumbing through it.  “I feel like I'm learning something about your tastes in men as well as literature.”  He grinned.  “Can I seduce you by reading Whitman?”
Curious, DJ watched it go, his head tipping back to follow its progress upwards.  Up, above the bookshelves, through the tarnished metal of the light fixture, the light casting shadows across the ceiling.
“Oh,” Tony said, and Steve let his eyes close.  He was strangely at peace with whatever was going to happen now.  Whatever happened, whatever Tony was about to do, about to say, he was prepared for it.
“Stop slut shaming me, Jarvis,” he said, toweling off his arms and chest.  The rattle of the dog tags falling back against the arc reactor had him pausing for a moment, his hands hanging in mid air.
Steve watched them go. “He can get himself ready for bed,” he said to Mrs. Parker.  “He’s been doing it for years.”
Finally, Tony braced both hands against the bench, staring at the array of tools, each one labeled, each one outlined.  “You are one very smart little boy,” he said.  He glanced at DJ.  “Talking's...   Not easy for you, is it?”
“Because I was the voice of reason here, as I always am,” she told him, and Bucky was laughing into his beer again.  She ignored that.  “So.  Against my advice, he goes over to the hut.  And finds this one-” She waved at Steve.  “Was trying to fix it.”
Tony pushed himself upright, wandering over to look over Jarvis’ shoulder.  “I don’t think it should sound like that.”  He removed his cufflinks, tucking them into the pocket of his vest before rolling up his sleeves.  “Here.  Let me take a look.”
The baby kicked, little fists punching at the blanket he’d been swaddled in, and Steve made a face down at him.  “He’s putting on weight.”
“Jarvis is sending the address to the GPS, want him to drive as well?” Tony asked, throwing open the back door of the SUV so that Clint could load it up.
"You look hungry on the best of days," Tony said.  "They're probably just covering all possible contingencies."
Natasha refilled Stark's coffee.  "We have potatoes," she said to Stark.  "Thanks to Officer Rogers.  And I'm sure the chef would be pleased to poach you an egg."
Tony opened his mouth.  Closed it.  Reached for his coffee cup and settled back against Steve's chest.  “Well?” he said with a ghost of a smile.
DJ took a seat at the table, wondering if there was a way to get to his practice books without touching the cake.  Furbro kicked at his breastbone, and DJ lowered the zipper of his hoodie.  Furbro’s head popped up, and he blinked up at DJ.  “Don’t go far,” DJ told him, and Furbro chittered at him and settled down to chew on the teeth of his zipper.
Steve frowned down at the line that wobbled across his page.  He shook the ache out of his hand.  “Why?”
“I hate all of you,” Harris pointed out, and headed out of the cafeteria as quickly as possible without actually breaking into a run.
“I’m okay,” Harris said, folding his arms on the table.  He looked at DJ, who was staring out the windows at the city skyline, his face unreadable.  “I’ll call if anything comes up?”
"You've already broken him, Jarvis," Stark said.  "You can ease back a bit on the throttle."  He turned back to his work, dismissing them both without a word.
Tony flipped the chair around and sank down into it, balancing himself on the child-sized seat.  “Deej.”  DJ's eyes flicked up towards his, and Tony smiled at him.  “I'm sorry.  We're not going to do anything to your room without your permission.  We're not going to take your things.  This is your space.  You control it.”
“And not smashing,” Bruce agreed.  His pajamas had seen better days, the blue fabric ragged on the cuffs and the shirt missing a button.  But he smiled at DJ when a blue and silver box was pressed into his hands.  “This for me?  Thank you.”
He turned and headed up the hallway, and Tony fell into step behind him.  “She calmed him down and reassured him, then brought him to his room to rest.  He is likely exhausted.”
“Why do you always have to be so difficult?” Tony asked. Pepper leaned against his side, her arms wrapped around his elbow.
“Hello,” DJ said, and the cat opened one golden-orange eye, considering him.  The tip of its tail snapped out and back, and it closed its eye again.
Tony made a non-commital noise under his breath, flipping another page.  “Let me rephrase.  Please tell me you have a gun,” he said.
It was very modern.  Very sophisticated.  But mostly the word that came to Steve's mind as he looked around was 'empty.'
She screeched to a stop in front of DJ.  She held up a hand, and DJ tapped his palm against hers.  “Thank you for inviting us!” she said, as Franklin came across the lobby after her.
Steve's eyes flickered open, and waking was pain followed by an inexplicable sense of loss.  He took a breath, waiting for it to pass.  The pain subsided to a dull ache.  The sense of something missing, something lost, something ruined, did not.
Fifteen minutes later, Steve was stretched out on the gym floor, leaning over his legs with Jan's foot planted firmly in the middle of his back, pushing him forward.  "I'm not sure this is correct stretching procedure," he muttered into his knees.
Steve dug his heels in. “We're not having sex in a public bathroom,” he said. But his face was flushed, his eyes huge and dark.
He glanced back at the window.  “Except I doubt that the trellis would bear the weight of a fully grown man.  Someone’s DJ’s size?  Sure, if he was careful.  Maybe even a teenager like Peter.  But anyone bigger than that would’ve done a lot more damage.  And as for the lock?  The break is clean, and subtle.  A fully grown man who didn’t care about how the damage looked would have an easy time simple shoving the window open with a pry bar.  The wood’s old enough, even if the lock didn’t just come loose, it wouldn’t take much to break the window frame.
Steve’s hands tightened on his ass, just for an instant, and then he tumbled Tony gently back onto the bed.  Bracing one knee on the bed, he leaned over Tony, his expression soft. “I’ll try to make it worth your time,” he said, and Tony leaned up to kiss him.
Steve took a deep breath.  He absolutely was not in love with one of his best friends.  He had to keep reminding himself of that.  Maybe someday he'd actually believe it.
“Need to get dad,” Happy agreed.  “And it’s been an all day meeting, so you know he’s going to be cranky.”
She set her hands on her cane, her fingers laced around the knob of wood at its head.  “And I will handle her.”
“We’re both getting a large so that when Drew steals half of them, we’ll still get some,” Harris said.  He waited until her back was turned, then grabbed a brownie from the dessert case.  If he was going unhealthy, he was going all the way.  “And can we go back?”
"The jewel encrusted cod piece," Tony filled in for him, because that piece of the wardrobe was so bizarre as to require comment.
Her eyebrows arched.  "Thought that might've been your first."  The wind kicked up and she nodded towards the door to the lobby.  "C'mon, it's cold out here."
The older man pointed a finger in his direction.  “You wanna stand there and be useless, you do that, but I'm not letting anything burn out of politeness.”  He disappeared from sight, his voice echoing up to them.  “Besides, Steve never puts his breads in for long enough.”
“No, I'm a useless lesbian who never managed to attract a proper butch girlfriend,” she said, and Steve choked on a laugh. “I thought WWII Army uniforms had ties.”
“That being said-” Sam cut in front of Steve and came to a sudden stop, making Steve backpedal to keep from crashing into him.  Sam rested a hand gently on Steve’s chest.  “I’m going to ask you a question right now, and I’d like you to really think about answering it honestly, at least to yourself.  I can’t make you tell me the truth, but for you-” He tapped Steve.  “In your head.  Answer this honestly.”
Tony ran a hand through his hair.  "You're a lousy liar, Steve, and I'm not."  His lips curled up, slight and sweet, and Steve's chest ached.  "So if you want to do this, then let me do the lying."  He looked up.  "And pass the wine list."
Tony spared her a cutting glance.  “Where the hell is Sam?  Sam is supposed to-” He shook his head.  “He's going to need Sam, and-”
"Dinner for nine," Miss Van Dyne said, holding DJ's feet up.  He tumbled backwards, still laughing.  Thor leaned a hand on the bed, grinning down at them both.
“Hey!” It was a scream, and he didn’t have the breath to manage more than that.  He passed a table, and grabbed for whatever was on it, some knick-knack that felt solid and hard in his hand and he reared back and threw it, with all the force he could muster.  It missed, sailing over the man’s shoulder and bouncing across the floor harmlessly.
DJ took Jarvis’ hand, looking back at Steve one last time before he fixed his head forward, walking towards the dining room, his fingers locked on Jarvis’.  Steve watched him go, waiting until he was out of sight before he leaned over to pick up his bags.  He straightened up slowly, avoiding Rhodey’s eyes as he shifted his bags onto his shoulder.
Tony considered that.  “It’s a very long list,” he said.  He leaned his head back against the headrest, pressing the hot cup to his forehead.  “And I suspect it’s about to get a hell of a lot longer.  Did anyone see you?”
“That’s probably a mistake,” Greer admitted.  She took the plate from Jess and balanced it on her knee.
“Probably won’t work.”  Steve smiled, and Tony found himself smiling back.  “I’d say he broke this lock within days of moving in here,” he said.  “He’s used to slipping out.  He’s had enough practice at Hammer’s place.”
The customs officer stopped, his mouth drawing up in a tight little knot.  He stared at Tony over the top of his half-moon glasses, his eyes dark slits.  Then, he switched his basilisk gaze to Steve.  "Purpose of visit?" he repeated, the tip of his pen tapping out a quick, almost frantic, rhythm against the paper of his form.
“If I don't get a cup of coffee in the next thirty seconds, everyone in this room is fired,” Stark said, his voice dire.
Steve's shoulder jerked upwards, pushing his bag a little bit further behind his back.  “Took someone's shift,” he said.  “Might not have told the brass about it.”
He hooked a foot under the edge of the fridge door, pulling it open with a flick of his leg.  “Don’t you think I would’ve learned my lesson the last time that I-”  From the other end of the line, Harris heard a rattle of nervous words that he couldn’t quite make out.  Tony stared at the wall, his expression pained.  “No, seriously, Pep, when’s the last time-”
“We’ve had quite a few years to acquire them, if you think about it,” Jarvis said.  “A few purchase here and there, added to storage.” He dusted off the top of a box with the side of his hand.  “It’s not as if you’ve ever been up in the attic.”
Obie took it from Pepper, folding the page neatly into fourths.  “Children,” he said, his voice stern, “I need you all to focus.”  He tucked the paper into the pocket of his vest. “Tony. Guards. I can have them here tonight and you'll never-”
"A woman he's never met just came crashing into his bedroom, demanded that he take off his clothes, and is now manhandling him.  You're lucky he's not running screaming into the night," Stark said.  "Jan.  Give the man some space, he didn't hire you as his tailor."
Steve’s index finger settled on the inside of his elbow, on the pizza slice there, overloaded with toppings and leaving strings of cheese to trail free of the crust.  “Always thought the pizza was self-explanatory,” Steve mused.  “With your history in New York, and Big Star.”
Steve leaned forward, pressing a kiss to Tony's hair.  "Love you," he said, hopping down and pulling the door shut.  "Peter, can you lock down the cabinets and-"
“Yes, do, I’ll be up in a few minutes,” Strange said, and it sounded like he believed it.  Wang met DJ’s eyes and shook his head, his eyes a little wild.
There, standing in the mouth of the alley, a slim, elegant figure in all black was holding onto the front of the mob leader’s shirt.  He hung, limp and silent from her hand, and her fingers uncurled, letting him fall to the pier with a muted thump.  Around her feet, there were half a dozen still forms, and in the distance, Steve could hear the echoes of footsteps and curses as the last fragments of the mob fled.
For a long moment, Tony was still, his face unreadable.  Then he smiled.  “He’s not interested,” he said, and there was something gentle about that.  “And even if he was-”  Tony shook his head.  “No.  I’m not.  He’s wonderful, don’t get me wrong, but-” He picked up his coffee cup, and turned to the pot.  “I dated my PA and ended up making her my CEO.”
But God, things were easier when Tony was there.  It was enough, when Tony was there.  Steve could deal.  As long as Tony was there.
“Well, I did set my alarm,” Sam said, the last word broken by a yawn.  “But my despite me setting my phone to ‘do not disturb,’ it kept going off with what it considered ‘emergency’ messages.”
Steve gave a slight nod. “I'm glad.” He looked down at the table, then at the door. “I've got a meeting, so, I'm going to...”
Marjorie was a short, round woman with a halo of blue curls that almost exactly matched the flowers on her pale yellow dress.  Steve wondered if she changed her hair with her clothes, or if she matched her clothes to her hair.  Either seemed equally likely.  She pushed a pair of orange cats eye glasses up her nose, frowning down at her tablet.  "Barathea?"
Tony froze, his fingers flexing on a piece until it bit into his skin.  He set it down, the base clicking softly against the tabletop.  “The week’s not over,” he said, just as quietly.
"Well, we left kind of a mess in the living room," Steve admitted.  "Figured that dinner might help you ignore that for a few days."
Tony sank down, leaning against the tree trunk, letting his head fall back.  “Common,” he said, with a slight smile.  “Simple.”  He balanced the napkin on his upthrust knee.  “I suppose that might be true, but-” He took a deep breath.  “I’m not sure I care.”
Steve reached for the basket.  “Yes, ma’am.”  DJ caught his eye from across the hall and raised his hand in a wave.  He hit Peter in the face with his rag, and Steve choked on a laugh.  “I think they’re both going to need a bath,” he said to Mrs. Parker as he waved back.
“That's my oldest friend,” Steve said, rolling onto his stomach.  Naked except for his socks and shorts, he folded his arms under his chin, grinning at Tony.  “I'm going to consider Sam my 'best friend.'”
“There’s a real argument in psychological circles about nature vs. nurture, so-”  Grinning, Steve grabbed a towel.  “It’s anyone’s guess.”
“And that’s how you got hired,” Steve said.  Clint spread his arms wide.  “That’s insanity.  You know that.”
“But if I’m your-”  Steve stopped, his mouth working.  “Your…  Your partner, for the lack of a better term, then you need to listen to me.  You need to take what I say into account, Tony, or we’re never going to get anyway.”
Steve realized he was grinning down at the book, so wide that his face hurt.  His thumb stroked over the edges of the pages, smoothing over the rough edges, the paper weathered and worn by a hundred, by a thousand other hands.  It wasn't a new copy.  And somehow, that was better.
“You chose the location for that date, so I think that one’s on you,” Harris told her.  “And we’re holding up the line.”
The coffee tasted off, like copper or ash, like the beans had been roasted for too long.  He swallowed, trying not to let it linger on his tongue.  “Because he knew I’d tell him no?  And then ground him for a very long time for asking?” he said with a pleasant smile.  “Just a guess on my part, but I’m going with that.  And just so you know, the grounding is still on the table.  It’s…  Front and center on the table.”
The cat stretched up, bracing its front paws on the edge of the planter, its whiskers wriggling as it sniffed the soil.  Tony stood.  "Oh, no.  Out of my plant.  Out of-" The cat's head tipped in his direction, studying him for only a moment before it went back to pawing at the dirt.  "Absolutely not." Tony leaned over, hoping that he could extract it without losing a hand.
“I mean, unless there was something quite illegal about your employment contract with my father, then, yes, you absolutely could’ve quit.” Tony pushed himself upright.  “So-”
Tony Stark gave the tie a look, regretting every moment of this already. “And I am a man well known for doing almost everything to keep from actually having to live up to those responsibilities,” he said, buttoning his shirt up and tucking it into his pants.  “Also, a man who's had next to no sleep, so-”
“That there may not be fairies,” Steve said.  He glanced at the one window in the kitchen, something his mother had fought and paid dearly for.  There was precious little light outside the dull glass, but there was enough.  “But there’s something else.  Something different.  Something…”
“Yes, it is.”  Grinning, DJ pushed the door open, slipping out of the car and dragging his bag after him and shifting it onto his shoulder.  Furbro disappeared into his sweatshirt, curling up under the fabric.  “Thank, Happy.”
“Be prepared to replace it at least once,” Tony said. “Show me where to find the green room and I'll give you something to publish.”
"Earl is a horrible name, that's-" Tony swayed in his seat.  "I wouldn't have dated you if your name was Earl."
Each word was bitten off with precision, his teeth clicking against the consonants.  Tony sucked in a breath, and tasted copper and dust in his throat.  "I'm calm," he said.
“You followed us,” Tony said, rubbing a hand over his face. “Fuck, I know that was you.  I saw you, when I checked into the hotel.”
“No, I had a friend with a wedding planning business call and imply she needed an emergency venue change for a society wedding,” Jan said, and Tony went still.  Jan's eyelashes fluttered.  “She signed the contract this morning.”
“I can tie you up like seven different ways,” Jesse said, and every head in the room swung in her direction. She didn't so much as change expression. “None of them involve a Windsor knot.”
Steve chuckled.  "Yeah.  I might've noticed." He caught Tony's hand, tipping his head to the side to press a kiss against his palm.  "Stop lying for me."
“Are we done?” Darcy asked, gnawing on the end of her churro.  “We’re supposed to meet back up in like-”
“I am confident that the upholstery is salvageable.” Jarvis busied himself with folding the blankets down.  “You’ve done worse.”
“Children, let’s behave,” Natasha said, crossing her legs.  “Or Santa won’t bring you any presents.”
“Well, I'm grateful,” Pepper said.  “And I'm sure that DJ will be glad to have some clothes that fit a bit better.”  She stood.  “Will you stay for dinner?”
Peggy'd known, he was pretty sure.  He was certain Bucky had.  The others, if they'd suspected, they'd never said a word.  Which was the best he could've expected back then.  That the people who loved him had known, had accepted, had kept his secrets and protected him.
“I’ll hold him still, you tape him up,” Darcy said, grabbing Clint’s arm and holding it out straight.  “You, let the woman work.”
"Caffeinated motor oil," Tony said, making another attempt to reclaim the cup.  "And the only thing keeping me alive at the moment.  Give it back."
DJ blinked down at the pamphlet.  After a long moment, he reached out, taking it from him.  “Thank you.”
“Lame Duck Prime Minister looking to get himself into the history books,” Jesse said.  She patted Ellen's hip.  “It's fine.  Everyone else was caught just as off guard.  We got here, right?”
Jan leaned in on Steve’s other side, her hand braced on his shoulder.  “No, it’s asking for the number of pastry types.”  She frowned.  “Isn’t it?  The boxes-”
Little, terrifyingly small, hands clutched at the fabric.  “No,” he whispered.  His mouth went tight.  “Just...  Small.”
“I was trying to determine if you were under her influence.  But there was no trace of magic on you, or any of the others, with the exception of this one.” Agatha nodded her head in Clint’s direction.  “And as I’ve said, any who think to disturb the work of a goddess soon live to regret it.”  She smiled.  “They just seldom live long.”
Jarvis stepped back onto the patio, a tray balanced easily between his hands.  Peter was right behind him, holding a bushel basket in one hand and a hunk of pastry in the other.  Tony arched an eyebrow at him.  “You're going to ruin your dinner,” he said.
"Also, way back in the day, horse theft," O'Brien said, his teeth flashing around the stub of his cigar.  "This whole rant of yours got a point, Rogers?"
"No, you're not," he said, glaring up at it.  "You're-"  His mouth worked, trying desperately to force the single word out.  "Not," he managed, and it seemed like a victory of sorts.  He slumped back, his shoulders heaving with the force of his breathing. "Not."
“Always the political one, aren't you?” Tony said, grinning.  He reached for a towel.  “Is Steve awake?”
“Sounds like a few girls I know,” Rogers said.  “I knew one who could break your jaw with a single swing.”
Steve wrapped an arm around Sam’s shoulders.  “Just for that,” he said with a broad smile, “you can clean out the stable.”
“No one asks for this,” Steve pointed out.  The heat in the words seemed to startle him as much as Tony.  He took a deep breath and ran a hand through his hair.  “No one.”
“Oh, dammit,” Steve said, his stomach bottoming out.  Six missed calls.  All from the same number.  He scrambled for his own phone, Tony's tumbling back to the counter.  “Dammit, dammit, dammit.  The alarm.  Of course, that's why-”
He heard, rather than saw, Natasha lean forward.  She scooped up a folder from the top of the stack and smacked Phil over the head with it.  “You’re going to have to actually propose, you know.”
He straightened up, one arm around Tony's back and the other tucked under his knees.  Tony's weight settled against his chest, his head falling against Steve's shoulder.  He exhaled, his lips curling up in a smile as he rubbed his cheek against the soft cotton of Steve's shirt.  For a second, Steve just stood there, Tony cradled in his arms, his chest aching.
“Cause I absolutely, one hundred percent will lose,” Ellen agreed.  She swiped a hand over her face.  “You got anything?”
“Fine.  Fine.   You’re all against me.”  Tony braced his hands on the edge of the workbench.  “Potts.  You have to distribute tickets at the factories.”
"This is some Romeo and Juliet style shit right here," Sam said from behind him, and Tony flipped him off without even straightening up.  Sam laughed.  "Right back at you."
“No,” Tony said.  “Because we have no idea what we’re actually looking for.   We have-” He stopped next to DJ, who was watching a lava lamp bubble, the glass chamber held in the curving tail of a stone dragon.  Tony studied it, his head tipped to the side.  “I could improve that.”
He looked back.  “Stay here,” he said, pointing at DJ and Harris in turns.  His eyes darted between them.  “Both of you. Expect you both to be sitting there when I get back.”
“I told myself it wasn’t revenge,” she said.  “After all, revenge is an ugly thing, isn’t it?  An eye for an eye, a bullet for a bullet.  I’d convinced myself that what I was doing was saving the next kid in line, the next one with a father who didn’t have a lot of choices and still made the worst possible one.”
Tony heaved a sigh.  “Yeah.  I know.”  He reached out, and caught Steve’s hand in his, tangling their fingers together.  “His parents came for him.”
“Yeah,” Tony agreed.  “And in the off season, it's nothing but 'rest of it.'”  Steve heard him shift, the chair in his office squeaking as he leaned forward.  Steve let his eyes close, wishing he was there, sprawled out on Tony's couch, bathed in the warm scent of bread baking and Bruce's herbal experiments.  He loved the battered leather couch, loved the way that Tony muttered to himself as he scowled at his invoices, loved the soft sound of the eighties radio station that the prep team played before the rest of the staff came in.
“But Rogers hasn't,” Duck said.  He considered her, his brown eyes sharp.  “Look, I might not be on the same websites you are-”
“Please don't encourage him,” Steve said, because DJ, sensing an ally, scrambled across the bed to sit next to Thor.  “Going barefoot should be a last resort, not a primary plan.”
“If we go back to my place, you're making it worth my while,” Tony said, and Steve's teeth flashed in a sharp, beautiful smile.
“Go,” Harris said.  He turned towards the registration desk, then immediately pivoted back towards Tony.  “And give me that.” He snatched the credit card from Tony’s fingers, giving him a look.  “Were you raised by wolves?”
Jane, her hands held by Thor and the woman who'd been measuring him, skipped in an uneven, off kilter circle.  “Sure, you do!” she said, her face flushed.
“Ah.  Well.  We’re your parents, Deej, but that doesn’t mean we’re always going to agree about what’s best for you.  We both want you to be healthy, and happy and safe.  And both of us are willing to take on the other if we think you’re not getting something you need.”
He headed for the door, his pulse thudding in his ears.  Behind him, Rogers said, “What am I going to find in the rest of the house, Mr. Stark?”
Rogers' cheeks were pink, but his expression was almost amused.  “There are three bullet holes in the walls of your office,” he said.
“Too slow,” Clint said, sinking his teeth into a drumstick.  He held the platter out of reach, ignoring the curses that Happy rained down on him.  Steve watched, amused, as Clint braced a foot in the middle of Happy's chest, trying to hold him at bay.
"He's always tired now," Val said, reaching for the bag of pretzels that was lying between the welding torch and the cans of epoxy.  She stuck a pretzel rod between her teeth and went back to assembling the metal plates.  "Always."
“Dance lessons,” Jan repeated, propping a hand on her hip.  “Steve.  Gym.  What you're wearing will work.  We're going to teach you how to dance.”
Hammer leaned in; the possibility of doing something exclusive had him hooked. “Really,” he repeated. “And why not?”
Peter gave a full body flinch, holding his milkshake cup up in front of his face like he could hide behind it.  Everyone looked at him with varying degrees of amusement and pity.  Natasha reached out, and pushed the cup down.  “Take your medicine, Peter,” she said, and next to her, Clint had both their super long straws shoved under his upper lip.  She looked at him.  “What-”
“You put it there, now you want it gone?” Steve asked, but he let Tony push his shoulders down, his head sliding under the water.  It closed over his face, and he exhaled, bubbles slipping from his lips.  It was warm and quiet and he reached up, tugging Tony down to him.
Steve blinked at him.  “I-  Oh.”  He looked down at the mistletoe bells, and smiled.  “I thought everyone else was in bed.”
DJ considered him.  "Because if I fixed it,” he said, slowly, “then he would know I could.” His eyes flicked in Tony's direction.  “You would know.”
“Ain’t talking to you!” Bucky yelled, and Steve grinned at nothing in particular.  Bucky glanced at him.  “Please let me kill him.”
"How boring your dinners must be," Thor said, cradling his wine glass in the palm of his hand.  "Why do your people have children, if they merely place them in back rooms until they are adults?"  He waved the glass through the air.  “Why would you invite this fine boy here, only to deny him a seat at the table?”
“Yes, but there's no reason for it to be a waste.” Steve slashed his pencil through the air. “It's pointless. You've already paid for the seats. You've already spent the money. Why not use that, and make people other than DJ happy?”
“I think that’s the closest you’ve come to giving me a compliment.” Tony rocked backwards.  “Down.  Let’s get rid of that soap.”
She paused.  “No one legit, anyway.”  Her head came up, looking up at the sky. “As it turns out, a well-trained chemist can make other things.  Things that may or may not be one hundred percent legal at the time when it’s being made.”
“Because there is no other choice,” Nicholas said.  He downed the rest of his beer in a long swallow, then dropped the tankard back to the table.  “I took the throne, because the alternative was not one I could stomach.  And you’ll do the same.”  He stood.  “If I die, and I have every reason to believe that a conspiracy within the walls of my own palace is already too established for me to stop, then it will be war.  There are three noble houses with their eyes on the throne, and each of the three is primed to take on the others.  I’ve held them in check, in a sort of balance, since I took the throne.  Kept all three of them as advisers.  It limits their ability to work in the shadows, but it also gives them far more access than I’d like.
“I do like looking fancy, but-” Stark caught the wrench that Rhodes tossed to him.  He spun it around his palm, long fingers flicking through the air.  His head tipped in Steve's direction, and he flipped off a salute that didn't seem nearly as mocking as it should've been.  “Don't worry, Officer, we'll have everything in order in due time.  You won't need to look for a trolley station.”
“We can’t stay here,” he said, and that, he could manage.  He leaned over, sliding his hands under DJ’s body, taking the boy’s small, slight weight against his chest.  Tangled in the fabric of Tony’s jacket, DJ turned his face into Tony’s shoulder, his fingers catching on Tony’s shirt.  Tony went still, shifting DJ higher into the cradle of his arms.
“Okay,” Tony said.  “We'll leave it right there, then, and you can come get it again tonight after dinner, or tomorrow morning.”  He stood up.  “You can take it, whenever you want.  All right?”
“Good, I can work with that,” Clint said, levering himself into a seated position, his back braced against the side of the tunnel.  He wiped blood and dust off of his arm, wincing as he found a long scrape just below the armline of his vest.  "Ugh, that's gonna hurt."
“Fuck,” Clint bit out, his feet scrambling against the hood of the car as he slid to the ground.  “Fuck, fuck-”
Tony looked up.  “Good eye, Rogers,” he said, and the smile that bloomed on Steve's face was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen.  He went to take his hand back, but Steve caught his wrist, holding him still.  He pulled the ring off, and put it on the counter.
DJ reached out, stroking Furbro's head.  "Protects the dragon from the world," he said, and it was more words than he ever bothered to string together, and Steve grinned at him.
He looked up at Sam.  “Nothing,” he said.  “Talking-” He flopped a hand through the air.  “Talking to myself.”  He leaned forward, and God, his back was killing him. “How do you do that?”
“Thank you, Mrs. Parker,” Steve said, swinging his bag off of his shoulder and setting it down next to the door.  He stepped aside so Tony could shrug out of his coat, dropping it onto one of the hooks there.  “Something smells good.”
“Right,” Clint said.  “Right.”  He leaned back.  “Phil!  Do you want to decorate cookies or learn about modern art?”
“I'll stay until you fall asleep,” he said, and he found he was smiling.  “Just-” He shook his head.  “Go to sleep, Tony.”
“I could not possibly have known that would happen,” she pointed out with a smile.  “Don’t get me wrong.  I’m pleased that it did.  But I can’t be held accountable for it.”
“That goes without saying,” Iron Man said, one hand coming up, the back of his knuckles ghosting over DJ’s cheek.  “You were already grounded forever.  Now you are grounded for so long that I’m going to end up as a brain floating in a jar, immortal, unending, existing just to maintain your grounding for a couple of decades past ‘forever,’ and you should be proud.  You are the reason why immortality will be invented, just so make sure-”
“This is inappropriate,” Jarvis told her, filling a napkin lined basket with fresh, steaming popovers.
DJ leaned in, staying close to the stove, his arms folded and his hands tucked against his chest.  Steve moved around him, filling the kettle and setting it on top of the range.  "C'mon, I'll get you some bread and cheese."  DJ's eyes flicked in his direction, but he turned his attention back to the stove, never moving from his chosen spot.
By the time he ran out of words, they were running out of food, too.  Empty cartons littered the rooftop around them, and Tony was digging the last of the lo mein from the carton.  “And that's why I'm going to fire everyone and replace them with those little drinking birds,” he said, waving his chopsticks around.  “They can hit keyboards randomly just as well as these idiots, and they don't even need health care.”
“Know.” DJ wrestled his shirt off, everything taking too much effort, and more energy than he had.  He was exhausted, and the lack of sleep was like a physical weight on his thin frame.  His shoulders ached with it, his back bowed.  His shirt fluttered to the ground.  “It's...  It's okay.”
“Yeah, but you’re smiling.”  Tony leaned over to pick up a discarded napkin, tucking it into the nearby trash can.  “So it’s worth it.”  He looked up.  “Came creeping up to the curb tonight.  Wasn’t expecting you back until tomorrow.”
“You really think so?”  Tony made a humming noise under his breath.  “I don’t know.  They seem to be keeping you out, just fine.”  He nodded at the board.  “Your turn.”
Tony kicked a box onto its side with a flick of his foot, and waved a hand at it.  “Join me.  The finest seats in the city.”
Steve shrugged.  “I was awake.  Didn’t much feel like getting out of bed, to be honest.”  He gave Tony’s ass a squeeze.  “But we should probably get dressed before eight.”
Tony's arms tightened, an instinctual response to the sudden forward momentum.  Their bodies swayed as the bike roared to life, the wheels struggling for traction.  The tires caught, and just like that, they were flying.
But when he smiled at T’Challa, his whole face lit up.  “Your Majesty,” he said, inclining his head.
Bucky shouldered a bush out of the way.  “Maybe.”  He moved aside, and there, in the sandy, rocky wash, water flowed, more stream than river, but still.  Water.  Where he’d thought it would be.  Bucky crouched down, removing the cap from the first flask.  “But I’ll take your memory over mine.”
Tony glanced at Pepper, who shook her head, her face puzzled.  "What do you mean, attempted?  He had the codes, he had-"
“So I can protect him.  I have the position and the power and the resources,” she said, her voice soft, barely above a whisper.  “Or I can speak out against this.  I can use all of that to protect the ones who aren't as lucky as he is.  Who don't have anyone to speak for them.  The most vulnerable ones, the ones they're going to come for first.”
"'S okay," he said, and it was.  It mostly was.  He sucked in a slow breath from between his teeth, trying to focus on the wiring in front of him.  That, at least, was orderly and understandable, easy for him to compartmentalize and control.  He slid a fingertip along the length of a wire, tracing its path from the power source.  "We did work."  It wasn't quite right, he knew it, even as he was saying it, but he couldn't quite work out where the missing words were.
Nebula’s hand flashed out, the movement so fast that Tony couldn’t even track it, and stabbed the tip of a hunting knife through the page she was drawing on, pinning it firmly to the wood of her desk.  Her head still down, she said, “Knife embedded hilt deep in the wood’s a hell of a lot cheaper, though, itsy-bitsy.”
Clint snorted.  “Jesus, wow, no.  I absolutely do not.”  He balanced the box on the palm of one hand.  “But if you don’t want me to wear this one-”
It was waiting for him; the moment he stepped towards the fence, the gate unlocked with an audible click.  He pushed the iron gate open, slipping through the gap in the fence, and letting it swing shut behind him.  As soon as the gate settled back into place, the fence seemed to absorb it, the metal curling into place like a vine.  DJ headed up the short path, letting his toes drag through the fog that clung to the stones.  No matter how warm it was, no matter what time of day, every step would kick up a thin film of mist.
Steve smiled at him.  “I’m not risking my life,” he said, and Tony caught the front of his shirt, tugging him in.  The kiss was gentle and soft and like nothing Steve had ever expected to have.  When Tony finally pulled away, he was breathing hard.  Steve stole another kiss from him, his breath whispering over Tony’s lips.  “Stay here.  Where you’re safe.”
“Take him to the kitchen, Mrs. Parker’ll have something for him to eat,” Tony said, his pulse thudding in his ears.  “I’ll get the car.”
Jess’ eyes went wide.  “Wait.  Wait.”  She pointed at him.  “Were you singing Baby Shark?  I heard Baby Shark and thought I had, like, a head injury because Stark would not allow Baby Shark to be played in his house under any circumstances, but I KNOOOOOOOW I heard Baby Shark.”
"You just smiled, so apparently, I am funny," Steve said, his mouth kicking up on one side.  There was a smugness there that Tony was pretty sure he shouldn't encourage.  Not that he had a choice.  "No 'think' about it.  I just got a bone fide smile out of you, and after today, I would've thought-"
Tony was sitting at the far side of the table, facing the door, a wine bottle and two empty glasses next to his elbow.  He was wearing a silk dressing gown over an unbuttoned shirt and pants from the suit he’d been wearing earlier in the day.  His feet were bare, his hair disordered, his hands cradling a file folder.  His eyes were focused on the pages, a faint frown tugging at the corners of his lips.
He didn't realized he'd made a sound until Jarvis moved up next to him.  "Is there a problem, sir?" he asked.
Steve choked on a laugh, and clamped a hand over his mouth.  “I’m sorry,” he managed, through his fingers.  “I’m-  I’m sorry.”
“We went to Mjolnir, you started a bar brawl, Thor finished the bar brawl, then he and his people and the SHIELD staff all went back to SHIELD and then we drank a lot of things in the dark and you tried to get Fury to admit that the wiring had failed completely and he challenged you to cook something without using the words ‘foam, smoke, dessicated or infused,’ and so then we went back to TOBRU and ate chicken and waffles and then there was another bar and a secret underground place where everyone was terrifying and then you called Jess-”
Pepper arched an eyebrow at him, a faint smile twitching at the corners of her lips.  “I can't stop talking to you entirely, Tony.”
“Because there’s no way you can get enough people to fill the whole thing before it gets to our stop?” Harris asked, and Fury’s head turned slowly in his direction.  Harris shrank down in his chair.  “Sorry, sir.”
“No, the trapdoor is how you fall,” Shuri said, her head tipped to the side.  She gave him a sweet smile.  “Do not worry, brother, I will aim you at something soft.”
Tony leaned back against the workbench, reaching for his coffee cup.  "Jarvis, this is not a fox trot.  You know that this is not a fox trot, don't you?"
He looked back to find Peter waiting behind him, his expression worried.  “No,” he said.  “Not that I know of, at least?  But if they got past the guards at the gate, it must be okay?  And if it was something  bad, why…  Why would they ring the bell?”
“Oh, this is gonna be rich,” Steve said, turning his attention back to his coffee now that they were on familiar ground.  It wasn’t good coffee.  But he’d spent a couple of sleepless hours tossing and turning in the too large, too empty hotel bed, leaving him frustrated and exhausted enough to risk the Keurig coffee maker on the desk.
“And when you are at the end of your rope, there’s always a little voice in the back of your head.  Whispering that no.  You can make him obey.  You can make him behave.  You can make him do what you want him to do.”  Stark took a deep breath.  “All you have to do is make him afraid.”  He looked down at his hands, one flexing into a fist.
Tony choked on a laugh.  "I do like a cautious businessman."  He paused.  "I'm not one.  But I like them."  He triggered the armor's release, and stepped out of it, rolling his neck.  "Just going to park that before I end up cracking a display case," he said, hooking a thumb over his shoulder at the armor.  "Let me know if its in the way."
