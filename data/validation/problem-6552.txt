“Tony, I’m going to head to SHEILD, see if they can find a lock on either Bucky or Peter; you should get some rest,” Steve sounds so tired, he’s essentially just run a two day marathon; but Tony knows that Steve won’t be able to sleep until Bucky and Peter are found or he passes out.
“Avengers, assemble,” Steve says, though he doesn't really need to because everyone is moving in the directions of their uniforms anyway. Even Bucky and Natasha who only just returned from their latest mission three hours ago. “Buck, Nat, you don’t-“
“There’s gonna be a lot of sitting and talking about things, kiddo,” Tony presses a kiss into Peter’s hair, thankful that Peter didn't flinch away from him, or hate that his Dad was horrendously uncool. “Sorry, Petey, but we’re going to be having a lot of conversations over the next few months, maybe years. We also need to talk about what we’re going to do about school.”
“He’s-“ Clint starts but he doesn't complete the sentence, before Tony is kneeling in front of Peter, not crowding him but close enough for the kid to know he’s there. Tony is rambling on about his latest project, something to do with math and physics, Clint can’t catch all of it, he’d taken his hearing aids out.
“Come on, ya great lump,” Bucky groans, but the noise cuts short as Steve buries his face into Bucky’s chest. “It should be illegal; you should be illegal.” He whispers, Steve, all 6’4” of him is adorable. Bucky tramps down on his feelings quickly, the modern day might be okay with how he feels about Steve, but he hasn't quite come to terms properly with it yet; his brain files the information away for a later day. He deposits Steve gently down on his bed, not bothering with the duvet, he pulls the soft blue blanket over his friend’s sleeping body. “G’night Stevie. JARVIS, you can cut the lights.”
“Damn right,” Bucky nods, stealing another quick kiss before he reaches over Steve’s shoulder to Tony, lifting his head. “What about you, Stark? Are you okay?”
“Oh God.” Clint says, “okay I’m not going on social media for the next month. But we’re okay to come right? You’re not having a moment or anything? If I have to see you kiss one more time I swear I’ll gouge my own eyes out.”
He smiles as he moves into the kitchen, and sees Steve sitting there, spoon in one hand and paper in the other. There’s a light sheen to him, not enough to be called sweat but something; Steve must have run further than he normally does. The paper is half finished meaning that Steve has been in the kitchen a while. Bacon is sizzling in the pan though, despite the fact that there’s already a half-finished bacon sandwich sitting beside Steve.
“Sir, I would advise against that, your caffeine intake has reached almost dangerous levels,” JARVIS says if Tony didn't know that the AI had no emotions he’d almost think he could hear worry coming from the robot.
“I have been dealing with hatred since I was ten years old and I figured the ladies weren’t the ones doing things for me, I can deal with some faceless people on the internet; it sure beats being beaten up,” Bucky grins as he moves to sit next to Tony; it only takes them ten minutes to set up a profile for him.
“Tony, love, c’mon, you’re having a panic attack. That’s okay, we can get through this, just remember to breathe” Steve is saying, his voice is low and he’s moved a reasonable distance away. The lights have been turned on but only just so that the room is visible. “Hey, it’s good to see your eyes.” Steve sounds genuinely proud of Tony, so he keeps looking at him. “We can leave if you want,” Tony shakes his head, he doesn't think that he can stand. “That’s fine, we can just sit here and breathe for a bit. Uh, I was going to ask how’s the building going with Clint’s new hearing aids? He’s even been bugging me about them, don’t know how I’d know anything about it but you know how he gets.”
As the others slowly start to filter back into the living room, Steve grabs Tony’s wrist. Tony looks at him with a slightly shocked expression, but he leans into Steve’s touch. He gives Tony a few seconds to pull away; he keeps his grip on Tony’s wrist light, so he doesn't feel trapped. Tony doesn't pull away. Instead, he raises his eyebrow at Steve and nods his head in the direction of Steve’s room.
“Yeah, I got it,” Steve kicks the man in front of him in the face, taking him down with a groan. He kneels on the floor, shield above his head as Hawkeye runs towards him, there’s a sudden weight, and then he’s pushing up watching as Clint flies through the air with a leap and a flip. Clint lands on the roof, skidding on a patch of moss, in just enough time to see Tony jump into the warehouse through the hatch. “Hawkeye!” Cap calls, but Clint is already sliding through the hatch with a quick grin.
Steve nods, at her. “Be careful, if something doesn’t feel right or you feel like you can’t handle the situation alone call for backup; the other’s are on their way. I want constant updates.” He turns back to Bucky as she disappears from view. “Stay with me Bucky, cause Peter’s going to be pissed if you’re not here when we get ‘im back.” He manoeuvres himself so that Bucky’s head is resting against his chest. “This ain’t the end of the goddamn line, Jerk.”
“Tony,” Bucky looks at him, a dawning realisation creeping up on him, “are you nervous about tonight? Is that why you’ve started this?”
“Of course, your highness, would you like cream and marshmallows too?” Bucky stands, bowing at Tony, who grins and nods at him. “What ‘bout you, Stevie? You want cocoa?” Steve smiles, the blush still hasn't faded from his cheeks; Bucky falls in love with him a little more, though the look he gives his friend gives nothing away. “I’ll make it like I used to, yeah?”
“Oh yeah?” Tony looks up at him, “what were you thinking? Bright pink? Purple? Blue? Striped? Spotted? I can do anything you like.” Tony grins flipping the wrench in his hand, unscrewing the plates and the different parts of the arm, Bucky grimaces it always feels little weird when people root around in the arm.
“I don’t know for certain, but I’m sure we’ll figure something out,” Tony grimaces, “but, I’m going to always be here for you now. Steve’s gonna be here too, and the rest of the team. We’re family, and family sticks together, so you got all of us with you.” Peter doesn't stop crying; he’s shaking his head still. “You’re not always going to feel sad, Peter, it’s going to get better. We’re always going to be here to help you with whatever you need.” Peter all but throws himself at Tony, who freezes for second before pulling the boy to him. “I got you, I got you, Pete.” He looks up at Steve and manages a small smile before burying his face in Peter’s hair.
“Scan is now twenty-five percent complete, Sir. I am running the symbol through my databases, Captain, I will contact you as soon as I can,” JARVIS replies. “Sir there are five agents coming up the corridor directly in front of you.”
“JARVIS do a scan of this building, find Peter, he’s your top priority; I want you to send whoever’s closest to him there immediately, the rest of the team is to make their way to Peter’s position,” Tony orders, he had become the leader of this operation by some unspoken agreement.
“Nah, you always ate more’n me,” he flicks Bucky’s arm, not hard but hard enough for the metal to make a tinging sound. “I remember one time you ate a whole loaf of bread in one sitting, your ma was so cross that you’d not saved any for your sisters that she shooed you outta the house with a broom. You had’a hide out a mine for three days, but when you got there, you pulled a slice of bread out your pockets ’n handed it to me. You knew that ma had been too sick to work and we’d no food in the house.”
“I’m still here, Stevie.” Steve can feel Bucky grin, “you’d not last a week without me, Punk.” He’s coughing again, so hard that it’s wracking his whole body, like when Steve had pneumonia. “Fuck.”
“Guys,” he says, his brain not quite computing what he’s just seen, “this isn't HYDRA, this is AIM; fuck, Peter, if they’ve done anything to him, if they’ve hurt a hair on his head I swear I’ll-“
They meet in the living room, just out of earshot of the kitchen, where Thor and Jane have just dropped in. Peter is staring at the god in awe while talking to Jane about his latest science project; Steve figure the boy would be smart but he’s surprised to hear that Peter is already in high school. Tony sits carefully on a chair facing Steve’s, he’s looking at him a little warily, but there’s no distrust. Now and then, Tony steals glances into the kitchen and every time he sees Peter smile or he hears him laugh, there’s just a little more love painted on his features than there was before.
“We have the results from the bloods, SHEILD does them on site and instantly,” it’s only been about two hours since Peter had had his blood taken, but Doctor Chavez walks in with a chart. “It’s like Peter was injected with an approximation to the serum that was used on Captain Rogers. We’re not sure the full implications of this, honestly we probably won’t know exactly how this will affect Peter until a few months at least have passed. We can guess about his healing abilities, those bruises on his face have all almost gone, and his broken ankle, which we can assume happened sometime this week has already healed. Moving on from that, his ankle will need to be re-broken if it is to heal right, that will happen under an anaesthetic so you won’t be awake for that, Peter. Though, that can wait so long as Peter is not in pain?”
“You want me to make you better at sneaking around?” Tony considers him for a minute, raising an eyebrow as he brings up a hologram of the arm, Bucky nods, Tony shakes his head. “Sure, but now I’m definitely putting some sort of bell on you, you’ve nearly made me die of a heart attack over ten times since you started living here. That arm is one of my only ways of knowing when you’re around, like an early warning system, I have a heart condition, Barnes. I’m no spring chicken unlike you cooked from frozen soldiers. But sure, J, mock up the matte black for me.” The arm changes in front of Bucky’s eyes, it goes from shiny silver to matt black, becoming as dark as night. The star on the outside of the arm changes too, from red to grey and from the star that HYDRA gave him to the same star that’s on the front of Steve’s uniform. “I thought I’d change the star too, but only when you asked to change the rest of the arm too, I didn’t want to push you, you know but um we can keep it the same as it was if you want. I don’t know your branding or whatever, and I don't wanna seem like I’m asking you to change your whole dealio, but yeah, I thought that that star would work better-“
“I’m fine, just,” he pauses and takes a breath, moving towards, Tony and holding him in a tight hug. “It’s good to be back, it’s good to be home.” He says into Tony’s hair, a private moment between the two of them. He presses a soft kiss on the top of Tony’s head, sliding his hand down Tony’s arm. They stand like that for a while breathing each other in, holding each other, until Bucky coughs quietly from the breakfast bar.
The bed slowly comes out of the machine, Peter’s eyes are wide, he’s terrified; Tony knows he has about a minute to calm him down before there’s another panic attack today. Peter’s hair is still matted with blood, sweat, and grime; he looks like he’s about nine, not thirteen, Tony’s heart breaks there and then. Even he couldn't protect Peter, even he with his eyes all around New York City, he’s supposed to be a hero; what kind of hero lets his own son get kidnapped? He shakes his head, now is not the time to break down, he has to be there for his son.
“Just roll with it, it’s good to have a place where you can announce stuff and to put your opinions. Also, it’s nice when people share little things with you like there’s this kid in Alabama, she wants to be an engineer, she sends me pictures of her robots all the time. She doesn’t have a lot, she bastardizes bits of stuff she pulls out the dump; she doesn’t know she has a full scholarship waiting for her at whatever school she wants to go to. It’s kinda cool to have somewhere where people can do that, you know?” Tony smiles, the corners of his mouth tilting up as the girl from Alabama tweets him, saying she just built a robot that opens and closes whatever door, curtain, or cupboard people need it to. She’s painted it rainbow and called it Tony.
“Not in the time that I’ve known him, is it broken now?” Tony looks at the screen, he doesn’t know all that much about medicine, but he knows enough to see that Peter’s ankle has been broken and set wrong.
It takes three long months, but Tony Stark is about to walk out of court the sole guardian and custodian parent of Peter Parker. All it is going to take is his signature on Peter’s birth certificate and a signed acknowledgement of paternity which he’s just about to hand over to the judge. His hand isn't shaking as he touches it to the paper. A couple of strokes of black ink and Peter is his; officially, Peter is his son. His son, who is turning thirteen today.
“Okay, kid, that’s more than enough excitement for one night,” Tony says, getting off Peter’s bed slowly. “Time to go back to sleep. Don’t worry about waking me up or anything if you need me; JARVIS will always be able to help if you can’t find me.” Tony looks down at Peter before he pulls the covers up over the kid’s shoulders.
“You’ve spent so long denying yourself the things you want because you think people will hate you for it,” Steve looks at him, his face is open and loving; Tony can’t help the thrill of excitement that shoots through him as he sees the way Steve is looking at him. “If you don’t want to try the, what was it? The V formation thing, then why don’t you just tell us what it is that you want if it’s nothing but what you and I have now then okay. If it’s more than that then, Tony, we’re both here; neither of us are running away or leaving you any time soon. No matter what you decide, but you do need to tell us what you want.”
“Tony,” Pepper has tears in her eyes, “congrats,” she gives him a huge hug and nearly breaks his ribs as she does so. “I’m so proud of you. The things you’ve been through and you’ve come out the other side stronger and better.”
“Sure, Tony,” Steve smiles encouragingly but there’s something in his eyes which isn't quite a judgement but isn't exactly friendly either. Tony knows that Steve and Clint will be talking about him the whole he’s with Peter.
It’s Christmas in New York, the morning has only just dawned but Tony and Bucky are in the kitchen already bickering over the turkey. Steve’s just got back from his run; he can hear them even as he steps out the elevator. Peter isn’t up yet, he probably won’t be for another couple of hours or so. Today is the day that they’d decided to announce to the world their little family. Steve is honestly quite looking forward to breaking the internet. Things over the past year haven’t been easy, and he’s anticipating the joy and happiness they’ll feel when they can finally no longer hide. Getting Buck and Peter back had been hard. The hardest thing they’ve each ever gone through, but Steve knows that it’s made them stronger. As a unit they’ve never been better. And they’re happy, really happy. He looks at his face in a panel of reflective glass, his cheeks are rosy and the end of his nose is bright red from the cold. It had started snowing not an hour into his run and he’d got pretty cold out there.
“It’s okay,” Tony shakes his head, tugging Steve in closer, “I get it. He’s been your best friend for practically ever. Peter is okay, he’s with Clint, Bruce, and Nat; the doctors discharged him. There’s nothing more they can do concerning his uh, his thing.”
“I can’t replace, May and Ben though, they will always have been better-“ Tony stops when Steve turns him around, manhandling him so that his back is to Bucky. Tony shuffles backwards into Bucky’s chest; he silently curls an arm around Tony’s shoulders.
“Tony,” Steve says, “thank you, this means a lot, the fact you went to all of that trouble for this, it means so much.”
“Really, on my kid’s fucking birthday?” Tony sighs, before offering out an arm to Steve, “that reminds me, Cap, there’s a handhold on the bicep and a foothold on my calf; you can clip yourself in as well if you want but the signal is only coming from Bowery, so it’s not too far.”
“Could you get Tony to come here, please?” He smiles a little, not even daring to shift so that his shoulders stopped their constant aching.
“We got to where your aunt and uncle were being kept last night, that’s why you had to go to Ned’s again, cause there wasn’t going to be anyone to take care of you,” Tony explains, Peter’s nodding. “We had to fight some pretty bad people to get to them, do you remember what I told you about them?” Peter nods again; his hand is shaking where it clutches the cushion. “Good. And you remember that I told you it would be tough for us to get to them?” Peter lets out a little sob, his eyes filling with tears, but he nods again. “Okay, Peter, I’m really sorry, but I’m going to have to tell that this is going to be very sad.” Tony takes a deep breath, “we did everything we could but, we weren’t able to get to your aunt and uncle in time to save them, they both died before we could get to them.” Peter shakes his head, his hair flopping in front of his eyes, tears are running freely down his cheeks.
“We just, uh, announce our marriage?” Bucky smiles as Clint’s jaw dropped. Over the past few years, they’ve become good friends. Grudgingly. And it’s a friendship neither of them admit to.
“Please,” Steve has never heard Tony sound so desperate, and he looks down to see tears leaking out Tony’s eyes. “Just, you know, it’s been a long couple days. So please,” Tony doesn't even put what he needs in words, Steve finds that he doesn't need him to; he knows what Tony wants. He keeps his hand in the other man’s hair, weaving the soft strands around his fingers, scratching lightly at Tony’s scalp.
“Cap,” Tony looks up at him, “please, get my son back, we’ve got Bucky, and we’re going to get him out of here, but no one’s found Peter yet.”
“Bucky,” Steve interrupts, “hold on, I’m at your position, but I can’t see you.” He looks around, but the room looks empty apart from the bodies of the guys Bucky had been taking down.
“And my instagram post?” Peter looks at Tony, he walks over to where Tony’s standing; he’s just at the age where getting hugs off your Dad is becoming uncool, but Tony pulls him in for a hug anyway.
“Great, that’s great, but, Tony they made signs.” Steve can’t get the looks of hatred out of his head.
I know, I know I said that the chapters would be bi-weekly but I am terrible and wrote this anyways so here you go. Some warning for this it includes some character death, and violence, and a little bit of gore. It's necessary though, enjoy!
“I wonder who has a higher mental age, Clint Barton or the actual teenager?” Tony mumbles as he slips into a stool, he places his head on the counter and starts laughing, or crying, he can’t really tell.
The next morning dawns with a hazy pale glow, golden rays spread through the room as Tony opens blurry eyes to the rapidly brightening sun. The light glitters through the half blackout windows and lies across the bed. Tony turns first one way then the next, looking at the two men who are both stretched out beside him; he can’t help the grin that appears on his face. Bucky’s hair is spread across the pillow, long dark locks ripple out in a kind of halo; his hand is tangled in Tony’s where it rests on his stomach.
“‘Kay,” Peter nods and follows Tony’s lead, he really is a small kid; he’s only about 4’6. Tony could lift him with ease, which he knows isn't normal. Peter moves almost silently too like he’s some cat or spider.
“Cap, I’m going in through the roof,” Tony tells him, with little room for Steve to question, he dives for the hatch, letting his repulsers take care of the Hydra agents that were waiting for him there. “Bye,” he smiles at them, forgetting for a minute that they wouldn't have been able to see it through the suit.
“I don’t think I do,” Tony shakes his head, his eyes. “God. What the fuck would my dad say- actually don’t answer that, please.” Tony holds up his hand. “What the fuck am I gonna do?”
“That was mean- Holy shit!,” Bucky breaks off as his phone starts to buzz with notifications, “I regret everything, I think my phone is broken. How many people are going to retweet that? Why are they following me, I don’t have anything interesting to say.”
“Fine,” he does as he’s told, “hi team!” Tony says he’s trying for bright and happy, rather than shitting his pants. But his voice is lacking his usual jovial tone, he knows what he’s going to find at the end of the corridor, and its weighing on his mind.
“You never asked, Stark,” Bucky smiles ruefully, “don’t think I’d’ve remembered if you’d asked me a couple’a months ago anyways.” He shrugs, “the recipe only came back to me tonight.”
“I think I’m okay,” Peter mumbles, Bucky gets up and starts walking towards Steve, “Bucky?” He hears his name and stops looking back at Peter; he raises an eyebrow in question. “Can you maybe come see my friend, Ned, sometime? You’re his favourite, and I think he’d die if he got to meet you.” Tony looks slightly offended, but he has this fond look in his eye as Bucky glances towards him. “Doesn’t have to be tomorrow or anything, just some time.” Peter looks like he's having trouble keeping his eyes open.
“Yes, Captain,” JARVIS’s volume is low enough that Steve is pretty sure he only heard thanks to his super soldier hearing. He thanks God for the AI’s intelligence, before realising that JARVIS was built by Tony so of course, JARVIS is going to have some sense.
“Right- Okay- Yeah,” Peter stumbles over the words a bit, making Tony’s heart constrict in his chest, he looks so young and scared.
“Beefburger!” Bucky nearly yells, “we heard of it from my little sister! She said that mom saved up for weeks to take them there for her birthday, holy shit, that place was supposed to be the fucking best. Do you remember Stevie? She stole a menu for us and drew a picture of her burger on the back?”
“That’s what I’m afraid of,” Tony whispers, as he turns to Clint, his brown eyes belie everything that Clint has ever thought he knew about Tony Stark. “I can’t fix this one. Not this time. There’s no trace of them; JARVIS can’t see them, he’s scanned the entire globe and nothing. I programmed a whole new algorithm, which probably should earn me another PhD by the way, and still nothing. I re-wrote part of the International Space Station’s code; hacked into NASA, which was easy just so you know it only took me an hour and a half, and. Still. Got. Nothing. Captain Fucking America ran around New York City, talked to the world’s best spy organisation, and the World Security Council, and nothing. I have nothing left to try, nowhere left to look, and no one left to turn to. Even with all my fancy toys, and my money, and contacts, there is nothing left for me to do. Do you know how that feels? I fix things, Clint, it’s what I do; what do I do now that I have been rendered completely useless? Because I can’t fix this.” The last words are gasped from a throat that is closing up; Tony has to stop talking as tears start to well up. He runs a hand through his unkempt hair, sighing shakily as he squares his shoulders.
“This one,” she traces the star with her fingertip, her body is tense, like a coiled spring; her brow furrows as she rubs the nape of her neck, “yes. This is the mark of the Winter Soldier. I can guess who’s this is,” she whispers as she traces the spider, the spider with the star on it’s back.
“No,” Ben shakes his head, “no, that’s not going to happen.” He’s obviously having trouble breathing, and his speech is becoming more and more slurred. “You take care of our boy, you make him good, Tony Stark. You tell him that I love him, that his Aunt May loves him, that his mom loves him.”
“That’s the thing, Tones; we found them alive. There are no bodies.” Rhodey watches Tony fall apart. He’s seen it before; he’s been the one to build Tony back up from the ground, but not like this. It has never been like this before, not so whole and all-consuming. “They don’t remember the last year, nothing, their memories must have been completely wiped.”
“No you won’t if you lose them then you won’t be able to shoot arrows at things,” Bucky grabs Clint and pulls him into the room; the others all came pouring back in.
“What should I do?” Steve asks, looking slightly lost as he clambers down, when he’s on the floor he starts picking at the sleeves of his shirt, a nervous gesture Bucky knows well. His eyes are wide and worried.
Thanks for reading, sorry this update took a while, honestly, i had two exams last week so that's why. I'm done with finals so updates should be a bit more on the regular side. Leaving comments and kudos keeps me writing!!
from my family to yours, have a very merry christmas, and if you don’t celebrate christmas have a very good day.
“Probably not, but you’re going to find out sooner or later,” Wanda says from behind Clint, she’s taking off her uniform, discarding the leather gloves and pulling her hair out of the tight ponytail. Even just by the way she’s standing she is miles apart from the scared teenager Clint took from the HYDRA facility. “You should show him now, Peter, before he gets the medical report.”
“Oh yeah, Steve, of course, I knew. I had a son and completely abandoned him and his mother. And now I am super fucking upset that he’s standing at my door because god fucking damn it I thought I had gotten rid of him,” Tony is going slightly hysterical.
“Yeah, this is okay by me,” Steve smiles, running the tips of his fingers down Bucky’s cheek, “this was worth the wait.”
“What did the doctor say, Dad?” Peter mumbles, it is the first time Peter has ever called Tony ‘dad’.
“Fuck,” he gasps, putting a hand on the wall opposite him to steady himself, “fine, guess that’s you tellin’ me I need to go see the guy.” He mutters to his arm, it twinges again, the fingers moving in an uncontrolled spasm. “Okay, okay fine, I’m going in.”
“You gonna be okay, kiddo?” Tony asks. “Do you need to talk about what happened more?” Tony pats Peter’s head as the boy leans back in bed, snuggling against the pillows.
“Yeah, but I don’t have a medical license,” Tony counters ruffling Peter’s hair, “okay you can ask for Bruce or Doctor Chavez to do it, but I can’t give you a blood test, Petey.”
“She said that your ankle is broken and that they did a shoddy surgery job on your wrists but the web-shooters aren’t infected or anything,” Tony says, he’s completely resolved to telling Peter the whole truth. “She said that she doesn’t know what’s making you heal yourself so fast, so they’re going to do a blood test or two.”
“You were taken, by HYDRA, we think,” Tony starts, “you were taken from a training exercise, which I guess you remember. We don’t how, or exactly when, or even where you were taken. We barely know what you’ve been doing, we have an idea, but we were hoping in time you’d tell us yourself. Bucky has already been doing the treatment, but I wanted you to have some time.”
If you’re reading this, then something has happened to May and Ben and this folder has ended being passed to you by their will. Inside is all the evidence that Peter, who I hope is old enough to deal with this all, is your son. There is a DNA test that Ms Potts helped me to conduct, and a timeline with provenance associated. You are also welcome to add your name to his birth certificate if you want to.
“Right, kiddo, now it’s time for my gift to you,” Tony stands, Peter looks at him, his brows are furrowed; he’s confused. “Come on; you gotta be wondering why you weren’t allowed in your room after you got up this morning.”
“No, we don’t know if the kid is actually yours, you can’t just believe him like that. His mother could have told him to come here and get money from you-“
“Is tomorrow at eight good?” he asks, somehow, despite the kissing, he still feels nervous asking Tony on a date.
From where he’s standing he can hear the breath in Tony’s throat catch in horror; they all know how traumatised Peter is, two sets of parental figures dying in his short life has left the kid a wreck. Tony is doing all he can; he and Peter talk over shared dinner every day, it’s more talking than Tony has ever done. He also has spoken to Peter about therapy; they’ve been looking for the right person for the last few weeks.
He does as Bucky says, moving forward and into the secret room on the other side of the panel. Bucky is slumped up against a wall, his hands pressing down onto his stomach; there’s a wound on his leg too. Steve can a small puddle of blood creeping out and away from him, an agent with some sort of gun is lying a few feet from Bucky, apparently dead. Bucky is pale, too pale, but he smiles up at Steve anyway.
“I can’t believe we’re going to Beefburger,” Bucky grins, hopping off his stool, “and I get a slick freshly painted arm as well, could this day get any better?”
@stephup dadt was a terrible thing the army lost many good soldiers because of it it should never have happened i am glad that i could help in whatever small way if there is more that i can do all people have to do is let me know<<
“You know,” Bruce sighs, rubbing the bridge of his nose, “you two are terrifying when you club together. Yeah okay, James, I’ll teach you to make the curry if you stop grinning at me like that,” Bruce smiles though, “come on.” Bruce grabs Bucky and his bowl and leads him through to the pantry. “I’ll start by getting you to try and guess what spices are in there. Tony’s in his lab, Steve.” He throws over his shoulder.
“Fuck,” Tony says standing up, “J let him in.” He’s freaking out, trying to remember what the hell happened back then, but the memories are too frayed and patchy to be clear. “Tony,” Steve breathes, “did you know?” Steve is looking at him with his wide blue eyes; there is no judgement in them; mainly curiosity.
“Sure, he sounds pretty cool,” Bucky smiles, “I’ll have to see what Doc Banner says about me going outside the tower, but as soon as I can I’d like to meet ‘im.”
“Look, Peter,” Tony begins, “Bucky got hit, it’s pretty bad. Bruce is with him. He’s a fighter though, too stubborn to die you know, like a grumpy cat, he’s got a few lives left I think, ‘kay? I sent Rhodey, Tasha, and Thor back into the building to do a more thorough sweep of the top floors, to see if we could get a bit more info as to what was really going on in there.”
“One of the HYDRA or AIM agents whatever they were shot it with those things they were using, the doctors at the hospital wanted to have a look at it, I remember Stevie telling them not to touch it but I’m not sure what the hell they did,” Bucky shrugs, pretending that he’s not enjoying feeling Tony’s hands running over his arm. “The sensation has almost gone as well like they fried the artificial nerves.”
“He’s like some sorta cat, ain’t he?” Bucky comes back into the room, three mugs of cocoa balanced perfectly on a tray. “Wouldn’t surprise me if he started purring.” To Tony’s credit he does nothing but sits up with a slight glare at Bucky, but he takes the mug with a thanks before moving so he can lean into Steve.
“I know,” Steve mumbles into his hair, one hand on the back of his head, stroking and tugging the short strands there lightly. “We’ve got the go-ahead to see them; I was just waiting for you.”
“Stark! Your child is truly made of honour, a wonderful continuation of your prodigy,” Thor shouts from the kitchen.
Clint resists the urge to bang his head against the desk, he wants a pint of Ben and Jerry’s, a nap, some pizza, and his dog; they don’t even have to come in that order. Mostly he just wants to find his friend and the kid who is definitely family he just hasn't worked out how yet. He is also, very, very tired; he’s barely had a break in the past few days and his body is so close to shutting down. He is completely unaware that Natasha is passing him a five-hour energy until she's pressed it to his palm.
Bucky is handsome, even when he’s as badly hurt as he is now, he’s handsome; Tony can see why he was popular with the ladies at the camps. There have been many a story about Bucky and the ‘dames’ from Steve, and even a few straight from the horses’ mouth. He’s started coming to Bucky and Steve’s weekly poker nights; there hasn't been a word of complaint from either of them, only a kiss on the cheek from Steve and small welcoming smile from Bucky. They sit, they drink even if two of them can’t get drunk and the other is only drinking apple juice; they talk about the war, the battle of New York, Afghanistan, and they play poker as a way of distracting themselves from the memories the words pull from their minds.
“Oh,” Steve says, then his face breaks into a smile, “I thought for sure you were going to tell me you were done with this. With us. Are you sure about this, Tony? I’ve done some reading on this and-“
“Do you want me to put it on you now? I’m going to dull the sensations for a bit, not completely but I don’t want you to be overwhelmed,” Tony takes the arm as Bucky nods and gets into his chair; he’s practically vibrating with excitement, Tony is too, he wants to know if all the nights of getting to bed a three am were worth it. He takes the normal joints and connections and hooks the arm to them, making sure that the quick release is fitted and working. All the time he’s working he narrates what he’s doing, he tries to make it seem like it’s for Steve’s benefit, but he’s pretty sure that Bucky knows who he’s doing it for. “Okay, now it’s just this button here, look, you might need to know where it is. This button here turns on and off the neural transmitters, those are the things in charge of sensation; if you ever feel overwhelmed or anything then just press this for five seconds to turn them off, or a short, sharp press to turn them up and/or down.”
“Have you had anything to eat, since last night?” He finds himself saying, “because Steve made extra bacon and you know, I don’t know if you like bacon but we have lots of other food if you want. You don’t have to, but if you’re going to be here for a while, then you might as well have food.” He smiles weakly putting the folder carefully on the coffee table. “Can’t go looking for your Aunt and Uncle on an empty stomach.” He shrugs when Peter looks at him with wide eyes.
“Always took care’a you, Stevie,” Bucky looks at him, still leaning into his side, and Steve is struck by the realisation that maybe his feelings aren't as unrequited as he thought they were, because they are definitely having a moment. He tenses up, almost imperceptibly, because Tony is somewhere in this tower, Tony his boyfriend, Tony who trusts him. “Always going to take care’a you, Punk.” Bucky looks away and the moment is shattered, scattered to the wind, but Steve knows that he can’t ignore the fact that it happened.
Clint has never seen Tony so still, not even when he’s hurt; he’s always in motion, whether its thoughts visibly racing through him or actual movement. Clint knows that when Tony Stark is still, something very, very wrong. Clint rubs the bandage that covers his forearm as he touches Tony’s shoulder lightly. He moves quietly, and if Tony isn’t in his right mind, then Clint doubts he was heard; he didn't want to scare Tony. Clint knows he looks a sight, he always does after a mission like the one he’s just returned from; he doesn’t know what to say, there are no words that could help Tony. Clint just sits next to him, knowing that Tony may shut himself up in his lab but that he also craves being around people.
“The scan is finished, if you want to go in there now you can,” the doctor smiles and unlocks the door into the room with the machine.
“What did he do?” Tony asks, perking up, and standing to move into the kitchen but not before he casts Steve a grateful look. “Thank you, Steve.”  Steve stands and follows Tony into the kitchen.
They sit down, all of them, all together, and open their presents. Tony can’t remember a better Christmas. The last three years had been hard, so hard, but now Tony has his family and his friends and he can’t quite believe how happy he is.
“Right, come on then,” Tony wheels Peter down the hallway, Peter is quietly, sleepily humming the Star Wars theme tune.
Their legs are tangled in one big heap, flush together, skin on skin. Tony rubs his toe in circles against a calf, enjoying the feeling of down hair; though he wasn't sure who the leg belongs to. Bucky, who is usually stoic and almost grumpy when awake, seems vulnerable in sleep; his brows are relaxed, and his jaw has lost a lot of its usual tightness. Tony can see that he has some of the longest eyelashes he’s ever seen.
It has been six long, long months since Peter and Bucky were last seen and a year since they disappeared; even Tony and Steve are slowly losing hope. Four months ago they retired from public life, preferring to let the others manage Avengers’ press stuff. They still fight, every day against HYDRA and AIM and every other person or people who would take peace from the Earth. But, none of them can put the loss of two of their own from their minds. Steve often finds Tony sitting alone in Peter’s room, silently crying for the boy he had only had a short amount of time with, mourning memories they never got to make. In a way, knowing that they were still out there somewhere is even worse. It gives them hope, which seems unfair to Tony because he knows that even if they do get them back, they won’t be the same lover and son as they were.
“Fuck,” he groans as he fumbles, half blind, for the towel he’d laid out by the shower. He’s back in his rooms at the tower, if Tony had been there, he’d be in Tony’s suite with the shower that shoots water in every direction. Instead, he’s in the rooms he’d furnished himself when everything was terrifying and new, and he didn't know what a jet tub was.
“Yeah, sure, Steve,” Peter mumbles, the surprise of being rescued and the adrenaline that brought is starting to wear off; Clint knows that if they don’t start moving now, he’s going to end up carrying Peter to the quinjet.
@sgtjbarnesofficial it would be an honor to interview you we could help spread your story the more people you reach, the more people you help<<
“Parker?” Tony remembers something about that name, it brings back memories of dark hair and bright blue eyes, “show me the video feed, J.” The AI does as bid and Tony can see the kid. He looks terrified, his clothes are worn and they look like they need a good wash. Tony is shocked by how much the boy looks like him.
“Yeah,” Clint nods, “this is not something you can hide, Pete,” Clint says as Peter looks to him, he’s tense and obviously scared. “Just do it, he’s going to find out eventually, plus it’s kinda cool what you can do.”
“Got cleared this morning,” Bucky shrugs, shooting two lizards at once, one of them without even looking. “Wanted it to be a surprise but you know, I guess these bastards had other ideas.”
“I know!” Tony half shouts, he looks panicked like someone just poured ice water down his neck, “I know, honestly I’ve been winging it since the kid came in. There’s a paternity certificate in there; he’s really mine, and I never knew, all the time he’s been out there and there’s so much I’ve missed. Now, though, I’m here and I’m going to make it right, you know Cap. This information that I’m his dad is out there, it's in some database somewhere anyway and it would only be a matter of time until someone nasty found out. Isn’t he safest here, with you, Clint, Bucky, Tash, Bruce, and Sam, anyway? Wouldn't you guys keep him safe?” Tony’s babbling, which he only does when he’s scared out of his mind.
fellow gay veteran here thank you for having the courage to come out. got dishonorably discharged because of don’t ask don’t tell, we need more people in the army to share their stories. and welcome to twitter @sgtjbarnesofficial<<
“Bucky got hurt but not cause of you, he should have waited for back up before he went in,” Steve shakes his head, ruffling Peter’s hair, enjoying the way he pouts. “It wasn't his fault either, mind, sometimes things like this happen; with us, things like this happen more often than normal. It’s no one’s fault, not really. It took me a long time to learn that, but you’re a smart boy, Pete.”
“Yeah, I heard Fury in the kitchen with Dad,” Peter nods, “he said that I was too strong to go to school, he called me dangerous.”
Time passes as he sits there watching Peter sleep, at one point he’d started to burrow further into Steve. Then he’d just sighed and stopped moving, Steve is seized with so much love for Peter, he never thought that he would feel this way about a child. Steve knows that he came to terms with never being able to have a family in the way everyone else had one a long time ago; now he does have one, and he loves them, all of them. He doesn't hear the door open, but he hears Tony’s soft laugh as he walks into the room. Tony’s eyes are sparkling with mirth as he takes in the sight in front of him. Carefully, he unwraps Peter’s arms from around Steve’s waist, and lays him down again; he pulls the duvet up to Peter’s chin and presses a kiss to his forehead, before catching Steve’s hand and pulling him up into an embrace.
“JARVIS has twitter huh?” Bucky turns to Tony with his eyebrow raised, “didn’t think he could do that kind of thing, what with being a computer and all.”
“Shit, I forgot about Peter, he’s going to hate me; I’m not even ready,” Steve tries to wiggle free, “Tony come on, I gotta go train your kid, lemme go. How am I going to tell him that I can’t jump off buildings because honestly I just want to sit here and look at stupid pictures on the internet?”
“Mr Barnes’ condition has not changed, he still remains stable, but critical,” JARVIS responds, Steve imagines that there’s some softness to his tone. “Sir has not left his side since he sent you out. Would you like a live feed, Captain?”
The quinjet is silent on their way back, Steve is talking in a hushed voice to Fury, though they're arguing he has no wish for Tony to hear what Fury is saying. The SHEILD director is spouting some nonsense about Tony being a liability, that Tony now can’t be an Avenger because he has the added responsibility of a child. Fury wants him to bench Iron Man for the foreseeable future; Steve knows that doing anything of the kind would break Tony. He tries to hold in his anger. He really does. But Fury is spouting all sorts of nonsense, and Steve really can’t reign it in any longer, he sees red and then he’s shouting.
“Hey, you said you liked my arm, right?” Bucky glances back at Peter, who is safely cuddled up in Stark’s arms; Peter nods. “Maybe, in the morning you can watch Tony do some upgrades on it if you want?” Peter whips round to look at Tony with pleading eyes.
“East or West of here, Captain,” he asks. He doesn’t want to make any decisions at the moment. A part of him has shut down, the part that would be cracking jokes and forcing humour through what they're doing. What is left is a burning pit of fury, it boils up inside him, swirling and hissing through his mind. He knows that any decisions he makes from now on will be clouded by the fury; so he surrenders himself fully to Steve, trusting him implicitly with everything. “Steve, please.” He chokes on the words.
“Thank you, James,” JARVIS’s voice echoes through the room, even though he’s speaking softly. “Sir’s heart rate and breathing are both back within normal parameters. His brain function is calming significantly.”
“Have you really not seen Jurassic Park? Where were you?” Clint chooses this moment to walk into the kitchen. “The hot pockets were out of date, I ate one anyway, but even I can’t turn that into a depression meal. Do we have any pop tarts?”
“Negative,” Steve’s voice is crackling, but Tony can hear the desperation in it. “There’s no sign of him; he must be in another cell in your quadrant. Keep searching Iron Man.” Tony knows that Steve is trying to give him orders, to keep him focused and on his game. He gives in. Letting the Captain choose his next move.
They stand infant of the tree, Peter insists on taking a selfie before the actual photo, so he can post that on instagram, or whatever. Tony just uses twitter to argue with bigots, and to remind everyone what charities SI is giving to; but he has quite the following on there. Bucky is the surprising one though, he has more followers than even Tony, and apparently is very good at ‘shit posting’ or whatever that is. So they gather in front of the tree, Steve is kissing Bucky’s cheek Tony has his arm slung around Peter’s shoulder, Steve and Tony’s hands are twined together. They’re each wearing stupid Christmas jumpers; Tony even has a Santa hat perched atop his head. Each of them gets to vet the photo when it’s been taken. Steve emails it to himself, because he’s a dinosaur that can’t figure out Smessage. Tony grabs his phone after Bucky’s finished putting a cartoon penguin sticker on the photo.
“What about me?” Bucky melts out of the shadows, his new arm has a bright red A on it, but the rest of his uniform is the same as it had been when he’d worked for Hydra. Minus the face mask and racoon make-up.
They break apart, Steve smiling at Bucky, and joining him at the table. Tony hovers a little, hesitation clear in his posture, his shoulders are set in a tense line, and his eyes are uncertain. Steve huffs, a small sound; one only Bucky picks up on, but Tony catches the movement. He smiles gratefully, as Steve gestures for the door, Tony’s out the room in a flash leaving only a faint whiff of cologne in his wake.
“There’s a small hatch in the roof, Sir, it should be big enough for you to fit through, there are two agents on the roof to your left,” JARVIS answers, sounding like he was proud of himself.
“I guess, I just didn't like the idea of him being in the hospital because I got kidnapped and he had to come after me. What if one of you guys had died? It would be all my fault and wouldn't have been able to stop it happening.” Peter’s lip wobbles dangerously, Steve wonders if Peter is okay, he looks the kid right in his eyes before he speaks. He doesn't want to slip into Captain America mode, so he tries to respond as Steve Rogers.
“On it!” Clint disappears with a shout, his bow disappearing into the building. Steve can hear Tony and Clint land with a soft thump; he turns his attention back to the swarm of agents that he, Natasha, and Sam are currently trying to clear. He wishes that they had a few more people, he decides that in the morning they’d send a memo to Scott Lang.
“Sir decided that I should get social media to monitor the sites for mentions of him that could prove useful in the future,” JARVIS adds.
“Please, take him, he’s been crawling all over the ceiling, Clint the fucker showed him the air vents that he can now get into. I swear I’m going to kill that man,” Tony rolls his eyes, finding the catch where the arm meets Bucky’s shoulder. “The whole spider-kid thing is going to take some getting used to, I mean, of course, I obtain a child, and then he gets turned into a web-spinning-ceiling-dwelling-kid. Just my life, right? I already lived with two WWII soldiers, two ex-assassins, an ex-carney, and a scientist that got a little too friendly with gamma rays, as well as the Norse god of thunder; why not add a spider-kid to the mix?”
“‘M not curled up like an eighty-four-year-old woman. I just like books and cocoa is that so hard to believe.” Bucky mumbles, as Natasha shrugs her shoulders and leaps up to the air vent. “Wait.” Natasha aborts the jump easily and turns to him. “I think,” Bucky takes a breath. “I think I’ll take some of that vodka actually.” His voice is croaky and full of emotions, Natasha shoots him a sympathetic look before she tosses the bottle of vodka at him and curls up on the bed next to him. “I’m happy for them, you know, they’ve been through so much. They went through me being brought back, mess that I am, they’ve gone through Pete, and I’m happy that they get to be happy-“
“It doesn't mean no forever, Pete, just that we need to talk through things a lot more before we agree to give you the treatment.” Tony smoothes back the hair from Peter’s forehead, he smiles at Steve to thank him for putting things into words, “for now I just want to make sure you’re safe and as happy as possible, we can keep talking about this and we’ll go to some therapy sessions where we can talk some more with someone who knows what they’re talking about. How does that sound?”
“You’re going to be fine Tony,” Steve murmurs, dipping his head down so that he can whisper into Tony’s ear low enough that the rest of the team can’t hear. “You are going to be a great dad.” And if Tony pretty much purrs like a cat, then Steve won’t tell a soul.
“The Show Must Go On, I made you listen to it a month or so ago, it’s by Queen.” Tony says looking too shocked to say anything else, “damn super soldier hearing.” He mutters, but he looks more abashed than anything else, a faint splotch of pink dusts his cheeks.
“Steve,” Tony says, shaking him slightly, “it’s six pm, Bucky and Peter are supposed to be back. Did they come home? Did I sleep through them coming home?” Tony asks, he’s slept through things before, but he knows that Steve never sleeps through anyone coming home. The super soldier hearing he has stops him from doing so; he wakes up from the sound of the elevator moving, from the sound of Clint rummaging through the fridge even when he’s wrapped up in their room.
“Yeah,” Clint nods a small grin on his face, “he’s on his way. He uh, got himself stuck in a bit of a sticky situation; he shouldn’t be too long.”
“You can stop pretending to be asleep, Pete, JARVIS already told me you were awake buddy,” Steve smiles as he walks in the room, there’s a light on by Peter’s bed; he’s huddled under the covers with only a small tuft of hair visible.
“JARVIS,” Bucky says, “mute the music, please,” he asks the AI nicely because mamma Barnes didn't raise no animal. The AI mutes the music without saying anything.
“So,” Bucky rocks back and forth on his feet, he thinks for a moment, Peter hasn't stopped crying, but his eyes also haven’t moved from Bucky’s arm. “Hey, Peter,” He says, “I’m Bucky-“
“What do you want, Tony?” Bucky turns to him, sliding his arm around Tony’s back, he’s got a glint in his eye, but he keeps a respectful distance. Tony pretends not to notice the way Bucky’s eyes slide to his lips.
“It is very much not your fault, not even a little bit,” Tony says, “it’s normal to feel this way but, trust me, Peter, you did so good getting to me and none of what happened is because of you. Do you want to know more, we can ask Doctor Banner to talk to you if you want to know more?”
He can see in through the tiny window in the door; this room was made for housing people who they wanted to keep an eye on. Mostly in case someone was severely injured and had to be kept under observation. Bucky looks almost the same as he did, his hair is longer and in worse condition than it had been. Peter had changed so much, so much that Tony didn't want to think about it. He pushed the thought to the back of his mind and opens the door.
“We should order, I’ve been waiting to try these burgers for like 70 years,” Steve grins even as both Tony and Bucky roll their eyes at his joke.
The AI is silent for a few beats. Tony can hear the sounds of battle coming from somewhere else in the building. “I’m sorry, Sir, I cannot find a pulse.”
“Sometimes, things that happen to me trigger memories,” Bucky explains, ignoring Tony’s impatient huff and hand gesture. “Tonight, watchin’ you comfort Peter, it reminded me of when Steve’s mom-“
“Yeah,” Peter says handing it to him, “didn’t read all of it, just the first few pages, but they seemed so…” He gestures a little, his fingers shaking; he gives Tony a slight grin.
“You can only try your best, Tony,” Steve sighs, “it’s going to be hard, but you’re the only relative he has left, and you might have only met him a couple of days ago, but he clearly likes you well enough. You’re a family now, like it or not.”
“Uh huh,” Tony takes the Doctor’s hand, “is that your real name? Because, man that must be a fun one with the kids.”
“So, you’ll never guess where we’re going tonight,” Tony turns to Steve, a smirk painting his face. “Actually, you might, because I hunted out somewhere that actually existed in the 40s.”
“Fuck weapons, this is much more better,” Tony stops himself, trying to make sense of the words that are coming out of his mouth. “Coffee, I need coffee.”
“It’s Rajma Dal,” Bruce is stumbling into the kitchen, he has a blurry, tired look that tells Steve he’s spent most of his time today in the lab, probably buried under a mountain of work alongside Tony. “It’s really just kidney beans and spices, you know, super simple. I could teach you to make it if you want?”
“Yeah, I’ll comm the others, make sure they’re okay,” Steve nods, a flush rising and spreading across his cheeks. Tony actually winks at him before he ducks inside, laughing at the silly little dance Peter is doing on the coffee table.
“Mr Stark,” the words are followed by a moan of pain, Tony can barely hear them, but he goes over to Ben as quickly as possible. He snaps the faceplate off so that Ben can see him properly. There’s blood pooling on his shirt, on his chest, Tony presses on the wound applying pressure. “Mr Stark,” Ben gasps, he’s smiling slightly though. “You and I both know there ain’t no coming back from this.”
“J, run those numbers through to rnd,” Tony looks up at the ceiling, “and bring up the specs, please.”
He moves off without a second word, sprinting after the others, it takes him less than five minutes to catch up with them. It seems like the hidden room is more of a corridor with several different rooms branch off it; the empty rooms are set up in ways that look like they were used as labs. Steve shudders, thinking of Peter being kept down here on his own, in the dark and damp. They move slowly, methodically searching each of the rooms for Tony’s son, but there’s no sign of him, not until they get to the last room. It’s a cell really; there’s a steel door with a tiny food flap and a window cut into it. Peter is crouching in one corner, the rest of the room is empty of everything, there’s not even a bed. The kid looks perfectly healthy and normal, or he would do if the corner he’s crouching in had been on the ground.
“They wanted to let me tell you, but I’ve been… a little busy the past few days, so you’ve had to wait. Sorry, kiddo- well you’re not a kid, now, still, I reserve the right to call you kiddo, kiddo.” Tony tries to smile, he almost kind of manages it, but it turns out to be just a weird jerk of his mouth.
“Oh my god,” Clint gasps, laughter erupting from him. “I’m going to leave you kids to it, come on Peter lets go, you can kick my butt at whatever game you want while we eat all of these pizza rolls,”  he walks out of the room, with a huge plate full of pizza rolls; he takes Peter by the shoulder on his way past Bucky. “You guys have fun talking about all that adult shit.”
“Tony,” Bucky picks up the arm, “this is crazy. I never had anything like this, I can’t believe this is mine.” His voice is reverent like he’s afraid to touch it, he holds the arm delicately in his hands. “It don’t weight much a’ anything does it?”
“Um,” Steve’s mind works at three hundred miles a minute, playing out different scenarios at the same time. “Great, you can either assist Hawkeye with the ranged attack or stick down here and deal with the left flank. Don’t push yourself,” he pauses to kick a lizard into Natasha’s blade. “don’t push yourself into something if you’re not ready, we don’t want a Winter Soldier scare.”
“Peter,” Bucky is entirely out of his depth, he has no idea how to explain things to a thirteen-year-old.
“I am going to stop you right there, before I end up having to kill you,” Natasha deadpans, looking at Steve with something fierce in her eye.
“I remember,” he says, nodding even though Bucky can’t see him; he rounds the corner, only a few seconds away from his friend.
“No, no, I don’t wanna,” Peter shakes his head, he looks completely lost, “what’s going to happen to me now?”
“How is normal good?” Tony sniggers, he’s fiddling with the Iron Man bracelets, Steve knows its nervous tick. He wants nothing more than to hold Tony’s hand.
“Sorry,” Tony grumbles, though he doesn't sound particularly sorry; Steve can see an unasked question in his eyes. “That was, intense.” Suddenly they’re all laughing, as though a cap has been let off from a bottle full of pent-up steam. Something has been released, and they can finally let go; all of the hiding and worrying can finally stop, it’s an intoxicating feeling.
“Yeah, move upwards, we’re on the sixth floor so we’ll meet on the fifth. Cap and co’, work down then start moving upwards. We’ll all meet on the second floor.” Tony says, “Sixth floor is about two minutes from clear.”
Bucky follows Tony’s lead, slipping into the suit Tony bought for him, he’s never worn it before; he’d scoffed at Tony when it had been thrown at him. Now he’s grateful to have it, he’s heard Tony call it his second armor; he can see why. When Tony steps into his suit, walls come up around him, and he wears that horrible fake smile like it’s been plastered on his face. Bucky wants to wipe it off, but he can’t do much apart from kiss Tony’s lips quickly as they head downstairs.
“I do,” Steve nods, “Bucky was always the one who knew more about comics than me, he always found the best ones. It's very important to have friends like that.”
“Hmm,” Bucky smirks, “you know your ears always go red when you’re lying?” He laughs out loud when Steve blushes hard. “Don’t worry, Stevie, you’ve always been a last minute shopper. The others are getting here a little later, Clint refused to get over here before ten am, cause he sucks. Bruce said he’d be here earlier to help me and Tony cook. Go get a shower or you’ll miss them arriving.” He runs his hand across Steve’s shoulder.
“Like you can talk,” Bucky mutters but he’s laughing too, blue eyes brighter than Steve has seen them in a while. “You eat twice as much as me, the amount of pasta you eat could’a fed us for a week back in the day.” Steve smiles wider as Bucky’s old Brooklyn accent makes an appearance, he’s missed it in the past few days.
“Steve, we’ve been through so much over the past few years,” Tony begins, his voice is surprisingly steady. “And without you, I don’t think I could possibly have survived it all. I know we’re already a family, the four of us. But I wanted to make it official, I wanted to show you that I’m committing. You’ve helped us all so, so much and I want to keep you forever, if you’ll allow it. This is it. So, Steve Rogers, will you do me the honour of being my husband?”
“Nightly,” JARVIS answers, “Sir has asked me to wake him when his heart rate elevates during sleep. However, it is better if he is not woken. Sir often does not return to sleep after experiencing a nightmare.”
“Tell him, Stevie, you should tell him,” Bucky’s happy for Steve, he really is, but he can’t help feeling like he’s missing out on something. He feels a small part of him shrivel up and die, the part of him that had hoped, in the new century that Steve and he would become something more than best friends.
The battle is hard, it takes a lot out of them, but soon enough they seem to be reaching the end. All of them are outside a room that has been barricaded from the inside. The Hydra agents are making their final stand. Tony knows they have Ben with them, that if any one of them makes one false move, then Peter will have lost both his aunt and uncle; he knows that it will be his fault. Steve is in front of him; even Captain America hasn't been left unscathed, there’s a massive cut just above his left eyebrow, it must have bled a lot because there’s a broad red streak trailing down his face. Tony looks up at him asking a silent question, he’s not wearing the face plate, and Steve presses two fingers to his chin keeping it in place as he looks at Tony’s face. Steve moves to pull away, but Tony grabs his wrist, not willing to let the comfort go then. There’s an eyebrow raised in a question, but Tony shakes his head, the rest of the team is looking at them; there’s a strange feeling in the air like time has paused. Then a shot echoes from the room and they’re in action again, Tony slams down the face plate and kicks open the door.
“Gross,” Natasha shudders as she pulls the blade out of the lizard’s head, “why do I always have to be the one who-“
“I think we should find a payphone and get SHEILD to come and pick us up,” Bucky mutters, “God knows what we’ve been doing and where we’ve been all this time, but I don’t think it’ll have been any kinda good thing, Pete.”
“Must have been hard in the forties, what with you know the whole like dick and die thing,” Tony grunts, he’s got the screwdriver in his teeth, his hands buried in the wiring of Bucky’s arm.
Okay so updates are gonna be shorter from now on, honestly 3-4k per chapter was hard for me to do, and it's harder now what with being at uni and doing my thesis and three other essays I have to do this term, including like two exams so yeah expect updates to be 1-3k in length!
“Here, chug this then go speak to Tony and Steve, they’re probably wearing a hole in the carpet downstairs at this rate.” She smiles before calling a team meeting and jumping out the second story window.
“Murderous alien lizard things,” came the distinctly unimpressed reply from Clint. “Can’t seem to find a source, am going to need a lift to a higher position. I’d prefer it if the Hulk didn't give me a lift this time, I was picking bits of building out my hair for weeks.”
“Shit,” Bucky swears, he’s just outside Peter’s room now, almost at the living room. “Hold on for a second, Stark.” He runs into the living just as the yelling starts, Tony’s face is dripping with sweat, he’s crying out for Pepper, Steve, Rhodey. His hands are fisting the seat covers on the couch, and he’s thrashing so much its a wonder he’s not fallen off yet. “Oh no you don’t,” Bucky catches Tony in his arms. “Hush, now, Stark. C’mon you’re safe, I gotcha, you’re safe here.” He’s muttering in Tony’s ear, hoping that he can hear him. It takes about a minute for Tony to calm down enough that Bucky’s pretty sure the nightmare is over.
The world passes them by as the moment seems to drag on for far longer than it should, Steve looks at Tony, noticing the lines on his face from where he smiles. Tony’s hand on top of his is lightly calloused from his time in the shop; Steve can see the web of thin white scars from too many hours in the workshop. There’s dust, dirt, and not a small amount of blood covering Steve; any other time he would feel slightly embarrassed by it, but Tony looks the same. His face is layered with smudges of red and brown, without even thinking about Steve raises his other hand to cup Tony’s cheek. It never even crosses his mind that the rest of the team can see them, because, honestly he doesn't care. Tony leans into the touch, even though it’s slightly awkward, Steve’s breath catches in his throat. Time passes, it feels like hours but must be no more than a few seconds before JARVIS’s voice echoes through the quinjet and the moment is shattered.
“Huh, JARVIS, give me a keyboard, I need to reply to a few of these,” he taps out replies to the tweets, ignoring the ones that spew hatred. He wishes those he’s inspired to come out the best of luck while informing them that if things don’t go well, the safe houses are ready to go; they only have to text JARVIS to get the address.
“I will enter that into my protocols,” JARVIS acknowledges, “it seems that Sir is starting to stir, his heart rate is elevated.”
“He has a lot of opinions, he needed to get them all out somehow, plus he’s useful; he needed an account to monitor Twitter for me, sometimes he even announces SI things,” Tony smiles a little fondly.
“What?” Rhodey looks at him incredulously, raising an eyebrow. “Steve permitted us to work on James. Tony you can’t hide this from him, this is too big, he needs to know; he won't just let a year of his life go without fighting to know what happened to him during it.”
“Hey JARVIS, how many re-tweets are we on at the moment?” Steve asks; he still looks at the ceiling when he talks to JARVIS, it makes Tony grin every time. Like JARVIS is living in their ceiling, which now that Tony thinks about it, he may as well be. Which is creepy, so he shelves that thought.
“Nobody calls them ‘flicks’ now, Barnes, the kid’s in Bruce's lab, I think they’re going over advanced cell biology. Rate the kid’s learning he’s going to be in and out of MIT by the time he’s eighteen.” Clint is digging through the fridge in the kitchen, “Oooooh hot pockets!”
Peter takes a breath, he pulls away from Tony, moving back a few feet before he jumps and lands on the side of the quinjet. Tony shakes his head, making sure that he isn't hallucinating; that his son is really hanging from the front, the vertical side, of a quinjet. Peter watches his dad carefully before he turns and crawls up the side of the quinjet, Tony can’t stop his mouth from dropping open in shock, his son is crawling up a wall like it is an entirely reasonable thing for a thirteen-year-old boy to do. There is no way for him to react, none of the many parenting books he’s bought has prepared him for his son sticking to walls.
“If I even get custody of him,” Tony mutters, “I talked to Pepper, she said it’ll be a fight, too much of my backstory in the press, too many failings. Too reckless, too distracted.”
Sorry, this chapter took so long, honestly, I lost motivation to write this because I got Very Busy but I'm back and updates will continue. Let me know what you thought of this!!!
He takes one calming breath before his places his hand on Bucky’s chest, “we need to talk about this. We can’t do anything before we talk, I don’t want to ruin the friendship I have with you and the relationship I have with Steve by jumping in too quickly. I’ve jumped in too quick before, and I lost one of my best friends because of it.” Tony remembers Pepper’s face as she told him that she no longer held romantic feelings for him, their split had been as mutual as possible, but they were still not entirely on speaking terms. “I won’t do that with you two, so we need to talk.”
They work through the night, Tony’s been flying around in Iron Man longer than he ever really has before. He works for two days straight, not stopping; not sleeping until he lands on the roof of his tower with a thud, he’s empty handed of course. There’s no trace of them, only a single thread of Peter’s webbing remains on the roof the tracker last placed them on. Nothing beyond that; not on the roofs or on the ground, Steve has been searching the city from street level while Tony flies above him. Now he’s exhausted, only the suit, which JARVIS has taken control of is keeping him upright.
“Bucky,” Peter tugs on his sleeve, “Bucky, everyone is staring at us, why are they staring? We didn't crash into something again, and I don’t think I’m bleeding. Unless I have churro dust all around my mouth, wait where’s my phone? It was in my pocket, I swear if I dropped it Dad is gonna-“
“If you think we’re sittin’ this thing out, Stevie, just cause we’re a little tired and beat up, then you’ve lost your damn mind,” Bucky nods, squeezing Steve’s shoulder with his metal hand, “what did I always say,” he pauses in mock thought, “I’m with ya till the end of the line, pal and this ain’t it.” He’s grinning, the line had become something of a private joke between them, though it was still as soothing as it had always been.
“So, kid, are you okay?” Tony asks, “Cause whether you’re really my son or not, showing up here in the state you’re in is tellin’ me that things aren’t exactly peaches.”
I'm on holiday and time and wifi have been less than available, so the next chapter will be up at some point in the next three weeks or so.
The first time Bucky sees Peter is when he hears the screaming, he recognises the sound from the countless times he’s heard it coming from his own mouth. It wakes him up, his ears are still sensitive, and he still sleeps lightly. The noise doesn't sound like Stark, or Steve, it sounds like it’s coming from the guest room in their shared suite. As far as he knows the room isn’t supposed to be occupied; Colonel Rhodes is somewhere in Europe, and Sam has moved out to his own apartment in the tower. His ears quickly pinpoint where the sound is coming from, and it is definitely the guest room. Getting out of bed is simple, despite the fact his room is a mess of discarded clothes and various bits of weaponry, but his eyes are well adjusted to the dark, so it is easy for him to find his way to the door.
“What d’ya mean?” Bucky asks, looking up at the ceiling the way he’d seen Tony do a thousand times. “What does that mean, JARVIS?”
“The guy was a member of the Ten Rings,” he begins, “he was killed by a bullet to the back of the head, we’ll have to wait till the post-mortem to find out what kind of bullet.”
“Okay, that can wait till you’re ready then, but not too much longer. We would like to keep Peter in overnight, tomorrow night, but we are also aware of his mental health; if your AI could keep us updated on Peter’s status through the night, then there is no real reason that he shouldn’t go home. We would like to see Peter attending therapy sessions once a week instead of his usual bi-weekly sessions, just for a month or so. Apart from that, there is nothing else, Peter will need to stay for a few hours just so we can keep an eye, but you can go ahead and take him home.” She smiles, it’s kind, and understanding; Tony can’t help but smile back to her.
Bucky can’t help but start laughing too, Tony is completely bent double and leaning on Bucky to keep standing. It’s the first time Bucky has seen Tony like this, and he can’t help but fall a little more in love with him. Tony runs a hand through his hair as he tries to stop laughing, he has the goofiest grin on his face, Bucky wants nothing more than to run his thumb over Tony’s bottom lip but he holds himself back. Tony’s hair is disheveled, it curls lightly as it flops slightly over his forehead, Bucky has never really taken the time to look at it properly, he’s always just assumed it was brown, but he sees so many different colors in there now. He wants to reach out and wind his fingers around the soft silky strands, but he stops himself before he gets there.
You might not remember me; I don’t really expect you to. You were in state to remember anything then, that’s why we only went on two dates before I broke up with you. Not before the mistake had been made, honestly, Peter is the best thing that has ever happened to me; and I don’t regret the act that brought him into the world. I didn’t want to burden you with knowing he existed, I know how you felt about kids; I hope that’s changed, Tony. You are the only one Peter has left now, and you are going to take care of our boy.
“Why won’t they tell me what happened, Dad?” Peter looks up at him, his eyes wide and confused, big and brown and just like Tony’s. “No one will tell me what I was doing for a year; it’s so weird like I feel as though I was just here yesterday, but then I look at the date on that calendar, and it’s messing with my brain.”
“It was, um, good? I mean, the plot was weird? Why would you remake dinosaurs, that sounds like the opposite of clever, but yeah I mean it was good… the dinosaurs looked so real, Stevie, the things they can do nowadays, it blows my mind every time. And the main guy was pretty cool too, yeah it was a good flick,” Bucky grins and sits next to Tony, “so where’re we goin’ for burgers tonight then?”
Your kudos, and comments mean the world thank you all so so so so much, honestly I had no idea this would do so well, thank you.
“It wasn't easy, that’s for sure, but we lived in Brooklyn, there was a pretty decent gay scene there if you knew where to look. Most of the other people around there just turned the other cheek, didn't see what they didn't want to, that kind’a thing you know?” Bucky smiles a little, remembering Brooklyn as it had been, “it was okay, we got by. But now, now I’m living, it’s nice to know that I won’t get arrested because of who’s hand I wanna hold.”
“Please, Mr Stark, call me America. America Chavez,” she walks out the room, white lab coat swaying behind her.
“When have we ever got what we wanted?” Coulson pats Clint on the shoulder, “I’m going to make an official report with SHIELD, other organisations are going to want to be warned that the Winter Soldier is active.”
“Who’d have thought that Tony Stark would be so good with PTSD, huh?” Sam says the other two look at him with raised eyebrows. “Okay, I’m missing something, aren’t I? This is what I get for joining the team two years late.”
“I said I don’t wanna talk,” Bucky’s gruff, his voice is gravelly, he draws in on himself; Steve can see him shutting down like one of Tony’s computers, the light inside him seems to wink out. “You got Tony, that’s good, great. He’s good for you, I don’t remember seein’ you this happy, Stevie. Not even when we were in the Commandos, y’know, I don’ wanna get in between you an’ him.” He shovels more curry into his mouth, “hey, we should go thank Big Green for this, it’s darn good though I’m not sure exactly what’s in it.”
“Uh,” Peter scratches the back of his head, Steve takes the time to properly look at him. His hair is greasy, and his face has bruises and scratches all over it. “Use a knife?” Peter bites his lip, looking a little guilty.
“Yeah, well,” Bucky breathes again, the sound is wet and bloody. “I wasn’t jealous of you, Stevie. Do you remember when you ’n’ Tones got together? How I couldn't look at him for weeks even though he was workin’ on the arm?”
“It’s alright, kiddo, we got you now,” Clint murmurs, “Cap, I’m going to get him out of here while you de-web yourself, alright? Sam, you stay with Cap, and Wanda, you’re with me.”
“Steve, tell me you’ve found Ben alive and well,” Tony pleads over the coms. “May is down; I repeat May is down. There’s nothing I can do.”
Tony stops talking as Steve kisses him quiet, he usually would be annoyed, but right in that moment he can’t bring himself to care; he’s too busy focussing on the way Steve’s hand runs through his hair. There’s heat in the kiss, and desire flows through Steve’s touches, but something there’s something different in the emotions that are pouring through Steve to Tony. He can feel how grateful and loving Steve is in the way his hand winds its way through the hair on the back of Tony’s neck, in the way his fingers play with the short curls of hair that rest there.
“Sir,” JARVIS says at four thirty in the morning, a whole eight days after Peter’s kidnapping, “I have Mister Parker’s location.”
“We’ll get you back to the tower; I have the best doctors in Manhattan there, we even have Doctor Banner. He’ll get you through this, then when you’re better you and Peter can go home.” Tony rambles desperately trying to stop the flow of blood.
“So what you’re saying is that they don’t remember systematically executing two entire terrorist organisations, and bringing down four world governments. You’re telling me that my son and my-“ Tony chokes out a breath that looks painful, “you’re telling me that my son and my lover have no memories and that they think it is still like 2014 when it’s 2015, and that they’re completely normal?”
“Like a whirlwind,” Bucky snorts, “we ain’t in Kansas no more, Stevie.” Bucky bumps his shoulder against Steve, its a move that used to make Steve stumble, or at least break his pace, but now it barely even moves him.
Steve backs away from him, giving him a way out, which he takes but not entirely; he’s still close to them, just not in the heated way from before. Tony smiles up at him, before taking Steve’s wrist, waiting for Bucky to offer his before taking it, he leads them out of the workshop. They take the subway, with the old baseball cap, sunglasses, hoodies, and jeans technique; Tony wants a relaxed evening, one where they don’t have any veneer over themselves. He wants them to be as stripped back and open as they can be; that’s something they could never do in fancy clothes at a posh restaurant.
“How many times, Barnes, do I have to tell you that I have enough reasoning skills to know that it wasn’t you, not really. I know that you’d never do anything like that now. Should I record myself saying that I forgive you so that you can listen to it once a day?” Tony shoos him out of the workshop, “now go take my son to get ice cream, maybe see a movie or something, there’s a new Jurassic Park thing out; he’d like that.”
“But, I love ‘im,” Bucky sighs, he feels so empty like he’s lost in the middle of the ocean without a compass to guide him. “I spent so long denying that part of me, the part that-“ he takes another deep breath, holding a pillow to his chest, “the part that was attracted to fellas, you know? I spent so long talking myself into silence about it, maybe I just, left it too long.”
“Yeah,” Peter smiles up at him, he looks so grown up that Tony’s heart squeezes, “what’s for dinner?”
“'Have you been living under a rock the past 50 years?” Tony blurts out, an incredulous look on his face.
“You know, I caught him stuck to the window, trying to climb out and on to the roof? He said he could stick to almost anything now, so I threatened to put him in a huge bathtub if he did it again. The look on his face was priceless, Bucky, I’m telling you, you should have been there. He turned pale and promised not to do it again, made sure he knew I was joking though, I’d never do that to him. His therapist told me to try and normalize his powers a little, you know but it’s hard.” Tony scrubs at his face, getting oil on to his forehead. “We’re going to try and get him back to school for September, I don’t want him to grow up like me. I want him to feel normal, he’s going over to Ned’s in a week which I think-“
“Sergeant,” is all Tony has to say, his voice wavering a little bit; he hopes the team will ascribe the wobble to the comms.
It’s all over the internet in fewer than thirty minutes. Tony knows ‘cause it’s already trending he’s had twitter being monitored by JARVIS for any word on any of them. He’s watching the hashtag climb the ranks until it’s number one. JARVIS is scouring through it, reporting any of the hateful tweets (of which there are more than a few), Tony watches as the AI shows him the nice ones.
“You’ve outdone yourself this time,” Steve walks forward, he doesn't touch the arm until Bucky relaxes his hold on it, a silent signal that Steve picks up on; Tony is proud that he notices it too. “This is like a work of art, Tony.” He places a hand on Tony’s shoulder, rubbing his thumb in a circle; Tony leans into the touch, smiling as they both watch Bucky trace his fingers over the arm’s almost invisible joins.
“Tony,” Steve says over comms from where he’s taking down about six agents at once. “Be careful, Hawkeye can you get up on to the roof and provide back up for Iron Man. Tony’s turned his comms off.”
“Only one of the greatest bands of all time,” Tony murmurs, he’s looking at Steve with an odd expression on his face, “Bruce made curry, there’s some leftover in the fridge, we left enough for both of you. Uh, Steve, you okay?” Bucky hops off the stool and busies himself with the curry.
“Sir,” JARVIS says, “Ms. Potts is on the line, it is about your press conference today. She is quite insistent.”
Peter shrugs but he’s smiling, looking up at Bucky like he hung the stars, “yeah, I’m tired,” he yawns and shifts about a bit.
He speaks to Steph, the veteran who works for the newspaper; it’s an online thing, but they also have a youtube channel, so that his interview can be filmed as well as written down. Bucky’s excited about that, maybe he can find his feet here, fighting for things he believes in without the violence that he’s accustomed to. Tony’s happy too, he watching Bucky talk through the details with Steph; his feet are propped up in Bucky’s lap as he lazily fiddles with some Stark Industries design. This feels far more intimate than anything they’ve done in the bedroom, its a feeling of being closer than they’ve ever been; no matter the sex or lust, Bucky knows that this is what he wants. He can see himself growing old with Tony and Steve.
“So,” Bucky begins as they make their way through to the bedrooms where they’ve been hiding Peter’s present. “You wanna tell me why you can’t keep your eyes off Stark? I mean, more than normal.” There’s humour in the words; Steve can pick it out amongst the question, Bucky’s wearing one of his wry smiles. “Stevie, don’t lie, you can’t keep nothin’ from me.” Bucky says, and Steve knows he’s right.
“Incorrect, on both counts,” Strange mutters, looking down at Bucky, “I am a doctor and the Sorcerer Supreme, not a wizard. And there is something that magic can do to help him that medicine cannot do, trust me, I would know. If I may,” he raises his eyebrow toward Bucky.
“Pete,” Bucky croaks, “I think we’ve been gone a little longer than we thought.” He points to a missing poster that was stuck up on the side of a wall. Both of their faces are staring back at them from the photo on the poster. They were about seven blocks from the Avengers Tower, right where the two of them had gone to get churros, what they thought was only thirty minutes into their training exercise “That says we’ve been gone a year. Do you have anything with the date on it?”
“Third floor clear, there’s no one here,” Natasha sounds every bit like she’s just done two gruelling missions within a day of each other. “I am unhurt, Clint has a nasty cut on his forehead but he’s using the nanobot stitches as we speak; are we clear to take another floor?”
“I wasn’t jealous of you, dumbass,” Bucky’s voice is barely a whisper now, “probably unfair of me to do this right now but, I’m dyin’ so cut me some slack. I had to tell you that I-”
“Tony,” Steve places a hand on his elbow, “can I have a sec?” He really doesn't want to tear the man away from his son, not just yet, but his duties as team leader are catching up to him. He knows that he needs to get Stark thinking about how he’s going to take care of the kid while Tony leads the kind of life that he does.
“Sir and Mr. Barnes started quite the storm amongst the press, it appears that one member of the audience ignored the no live tweeting rule,” JARVIS answers, “they were banned from future conferences, but the damage appears to have been done. Ms. Pots has come and gone, she is talking through the next move with the PR department at the offices in San Fransisco. Mr. Barnes and Sir are upstairs talking with Peter. They are waiting for you.”
“Actually, I was thinking,” Tony says, “I wanna come out like properly, I know the press haven't exactly kept things a secret; they’ve been snooping into my business for years, but I’ve never confirmed what they’ve all been thinking. So I thought, if I can do some kid good by telling the world who I am, then why not? But it’s me right, so I gotta do it in some big way, so I thought I could set up a charity that provides safe houses to LGBT kids that get kicked out. Safe houses that allow them to stay in school do their work, have lives.”
“That’s my boy,” Tony says proudly, smirking up at Bucky, “wrecked by a thirteen-year-old, new lows Barnes, new lows.” He shakes his head in mock disappointment; Bucky says nothing, choosing instead to saunter out the room with Steve hot on his heels.
“In an abandoned apartment complex in Anchorage,” JARVIS replies. “I have not been able to gauge on Mister Parker’s status, Sir.”
“You should have seen it,” he says, “their faces, it was wonderful. I’ve already started planning the Stark Industries float for Pride this year, and I’ve sorted out funding for some different charities, we should be doing more. There are always people who need help.”
“I know,” Bucky nods, watching the others leave, so it’s just Steve and him. “I’ve done missions when I’m a little tired before, Stevie.” With this he squeezes Steve’s shoulder again, “we’ll get ‘im back, don’tcha worry.”
“Okay, what about guards? Are there any guards nearby that I need to worry about?” Tony looks around the space.
“Great!” Bucky grins, “I could take Peter out for ice cream, if that’s okay, I know he’s been bouncing off the walls since he got back. Not having the arm means I can get used to the new less high tech prosthetic you built.”
“Tony, I need to ask,” Steve pauses, taking a breath, “what if we don’t find Peter’s family? What’s the plan here? I don’t want to upset you, I really don’t but these things have to be thought of.”
Steve can't hear the rest of that sentence because he’s being flown higher and higher into the air, Tony doesn't set them down until they get back to the tower. He’s deposited on the balcony of Stark Tower, as Tony’s bots pull the suit off him. There’s something in his face, Steve notices, a glint in his eye that isn't post-battle relief; it looks like anger. Tony’s dark hair is soaked with sweat, there’s a small cut on his cheek, and another on his arm. Steve knows he probably looks worse; Tony has the suit to protect him from most of the damage; there’s acid dripping down Steve’s thigh that has already worked its way through his suit. He can feel it burning, but he doesn't move from under Tony’s gaze.
He walks out the door, part of him not caring, but another part wishing he’d been better. He’s not quite sure what better means but he still wishes he had been. The elevator whirrs to a stop just as he leans up against the opposite wall. Thoughts speed around his head at a thousand miles an hour, he hopes this Peter kid is cool; he wants them to get along but he’s also thinking about what Clint said. Honestly, it would be shitty of whoever it was to send a kid after him, he hopes that's not true, and that Clint is just his usual paranoid self. The doors to the elevator open with a slight hiss. Peter Parker is small, just like Tony had been at his age, the more Tony looks at the kid, the more he can see himself. They have the same shaggy brown hair and deep brown eyes, though Peter is a lot paler than he is.
“Right on to your uncle, but what made you come over here?” Tony asks, looking at the kid over his glasses, with what he hopes is a kind encouraging smile on his face.
Tony stands behind the glass wall the separates the CT scanner and the computer room; he can see Peter lying in the huge metal tube, Peter looks perfectly relaxed, but his heart rate is elevated, and his breathing is slightly too quick for Tony’s tastes. He wants nothing more to grab Peter and take him back to the tower, to keep him there and not let him leave for anything. He knows that he can’t do that, he knows that Peter needs to see the doctors, that they need to check nothing else is wrong. Tony would rather be anywhere in the world at that moment, his body aches in at least six different places; he’s pretty sure a cut he has on his thigh needs stitches, but he will not let anyone touch him until he knows for sure that Peter is safe.
“I,” Steve sighs, reaching into the air vent above his bed to retrieve the box, “I just realised, I’m completely gone on ‘im, Buck.” There’s no sense in keeping it bottled up, Steve knows, it would come out eventually. Bucky knows everything about Steve, has done since they were young, Steve remembers the whispered confessions they shared as they curled up together. “Think I’ve felt this way for a while, I’m just so used to burying those feelings deep down, hiding that part of me. It’s still a shock when I walk down the streets and see two fellas holdin’ hands, you know?” Bucky nods, it’s jerky, and his shoulders are tense. “Buck?”
The tower was empty when Steve gets in, Bucky’s arm is slung over his shoulder; he’s stumbling a little bit cause he’s still a bit high on painkillers. They ride the elevator in silence, Bucky is leaning heavily into Steve, his breathing is a little irregular, but Doctor Strange said that it was to be expected. Steve really wants nothing more than to fall into bed, he wants to entwine himself so entirely with Tony that he forgets who he is; he wants to listen to Tony’s soft snuffle as he sleeps, he wants to feel normal for a few hours. He doesn't want to leave Buck though, those web pages he’d read on polyamory weigh heavily on his mind, he has no idea how to broach the subject with Tony though. How can you look at the person you love, and ask them to let you love another? Shaking his head, he pushes the thought out of his mind and steps into the communal area, helping Bucky into the room.
“The murder of a high profile Ten Rings member. No trace of the murderer. The room locked from the inside.” JARVIS answers as Tony turns to Clint.
“A blood test,” Peter’s face screws up, if Tony didn't know better he would say that Peter is pouting, trying to get out of it. “Do I have to?” He knows though that Peter is actually terrified.
“I see,” Steve smiles a little, “let him know I am on my way so that he can quickly fake being asleep.”
“It’s okay, Bucky, I got you,” Tony says carefully moving around Strange as he takes Bucky’s hand not the side opposite to the wizard. “Thank you, Doctor Strange. JARVIS let Steve know that Bucky’s awake.”
“Sir, Mr Parker is one floor away,” JARVIS’s voice echoes through the silent kitchen, “you may wish to go out and meet him.”
“Tomato sauce doesn't count as a vegetable, Clint,” Tony shakes his head, “seriously this isn't a frat house. And can you stop fletching your arrows on the breakfast bar, you’ve left little tiny scraps of shit everywhere.”
“Oh no you don’t,” Steve stands in front of the door, blocking Tony’s exit. “You’re going to sit at the breakfast bar, drink some juice and eat a proper breakfast.”
“He is the picture of physical health, though he is confused about the situation this morning, he appears to be understanding,” JARVIS replies, his voice is somehow fond, Steve knows how much the AI has grown to care for Tony and his family.
“Peter,” Tony retracts the hand of his suit and buries it into Peter’s hair. He takes a breath, thinking about what to say. “Pete, I’m sorry you felt that way, buddy. I will do everything in my power to make it home every time.” He picks Peter up, and spins him in a circle, setting him down watching him run back inside; he turns to Steve with a small smile on his face and a quirk to his eyebrow that tells Steve they are going to continue whatever it was they’d been doing. “Steve, are you coming? Gotta make sure my boy has the whole family for lunch on his special day, right?”
“With a little bit of cinnamon and marshmallows, in the pan on the stove?” Steve murmurs his eyes going slightly glassy and unfocused at the memory. “You used to spend ages trying to make it over the shitty little stove in our apartment.”
honestly thank you all so much for the 500 kudos im fucking dead... and let me know how you all enjoyed the talk, i know they haven't even ordered their burgers yet but they're impatient and honestly so am i.
“Alright J,” Tony looks at Steve with panic in his eyes, “can you guys stay here; I’m going to bring him to the living room but, can you please?”
“That’s exactly what they did, that’s why it's spasming too; you learn fast, Barnes,” Tony smiles as he sticks a screwdriver behind his ear, “whatever kind of gun they hit you with fried pretty much all the circuitry inside this thing, did a number on the plating as well. You’re lucky I’m so good at what I do that the rest of the thing held up, lesser engineering on it and it would have completely broken.” Tony muttered as he examined the arm.
“How do you survive?” Clint asks, but he’s smiling a little too, “could you come to Bed-Stuy at some point? Simone’s TV is playing up, and I think some wires got twisted, but I have no idea how to fix it.”
“It hurts, like fuck,” Bucky’s voice is weak, but there’s his familiar dry sense of humour bleeding into his words. “Think I got shot by some gun but there ain’t no bullets, not so much blood too, gun must’ve cauterised the wound,” he takes an awful shuddering breath, “it hurts so bad, Stevie, please,” another breath, Bucky’s voice is getting weaker and weaker; Steve can barely hear it, “hurry up.”
“Tony,” Steve says as he steps out of the elevator, “there are about one hundred people out there with signs. They made signs Tones, what’s going on?” Tony and Bucky look up at the sound of his voice. Bucky gives him a small smile, one that tells him they’d be talking later. Tony walks up to him, a grin plastered on his face.
“Steve,” Tony starts, “I’d forgotten his mother’s name. I can’t even remember the year that I- that Peter was conceived, I don’t know what I was doing, where we were. If I were a judge, I’d never put me in charge of a kid.” He turns away from Steve, burying his face back into hands.
“Oh,” Peter moans, “Dad, and Steve. If we’ve been gone for a whole year, what about Dad and Steve? Do you think they were taken too? Are they okay?”
Steve pads through the living room, spotting the presents under the tree. He’s been prodding at his for the last few weeks but he’s not been able to tell exactly what they are. Natasha’s present to him is probably the most intriguing. It’s a long black box. It has a red ribbon tied around it. But apart from that Steve has no idea.
“Um,” Steve says, looking up at Peter through the flap in the steel door, “right. Okay.” He says before ripping the door off its hinges. He realises then that Peter didn't know who was outside the room. Steve works it out as Peter shoots something at him which sticks him to the spot. “Pete! It’s me!” He shouts his hands up, “it’s Steve, we’re here to rescue you.”
“Is he there with you? Tony, what the hell is going on?” Pepper sounds a little flustered now like she’s stumbled upon something she really would rather not have. “Please, just both of you get down here, and make sure you look presentable, you don’t have time for hair and make-up now. Presentable means suits; not a pair of jeans without oil stains and rips, Tony.”
“He can also speak for himself, I am here because I support this project, I support Tony and the rest of the LGBT community. All of the Avengers do. I am here because when I grew up, we didn’t even talk about LGBT issues. It was illegal, a taboo to be hidden and swept aside. People were being killed for who they wanted to love, and it still happens today, maybe not to the same extent, but I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do something to help.” Bucky sighs, he’s shaking; Tony can feel it through the table, he can see in the way Bucky is sitting. “I couldn't live with myself because, as a gay man, it would be wrong of me to do nothing.”
“They’re fine,” Bucky points to an article in the paper, the headline at the top of the page reads ‘Captain America and Iron Man: Give us back our family’. Peter smiles looking at the words, it builds something warm inside him, taking over the black feeling he’s had since he found himself on the street.
“Yeah, I think I’m just going to stay up here a bit,” Tony says, yawning, the suit doesn’t come off though; Tony raises an eyebrow. “JARVIS, you can take the suit off me now.”
“No, thank you JARVIS.” He pauses, then figures that JARVIS is as good as anyone else in the tower to ask his question too. “JARVIS?”
“No, it’s been broken fairly recently though, and it’s been set out of place, see here, the inside part of the tibia is slightly wrong. That must be what is making Peter walk funny, though this fracture looks to be about a few weeks old. This would be within the time that Peter has been in your care, though I am sure you would have noticed a broken ankle.” The doctor considers this for a moment, she chooses her next words carefully and slowly. “Peter, did they inject you with anything apart from the stuff that makes you stick to walls?”
“Language,” Steve says as he finds his arms full of a thirteen-year-old boy. “Hey, it’s alright, I got you. Are you hurt?” Steve relaxes as soon as Peter shakes his head, “we’ll talk about the ceiling thing later, okay?” Peter nods. “Right. How do I get out of this, then?” He gestures to the webbing (?) around his feet.
Strong arms reach out for Tony, and he allows himself to snuggle into them, trying valiantly to ignore the sun as it calls for him to wake up. The whole world seems to come together and settle in its rightful place, as though this is how things should have always been. Contentment radiates out from their heap, where Tony is ensconced in Steve’s arms. For once in his life Tony’s brain is quiet, no stray thoughts move through his mind, he is completely content, with Bucky at his side and Steve at his back.
“I am already scanning the local area, sir,” JARVIS answers. “Would you like me to expand the search citywide?”
He reaches the end of the corridor, getting to the tiny cell JARVIS told him about. Tony looks inside the cramped room; there’re scratches all over the walls from some previous occupant. A pile of dirty hay sits in a corner, apparently, that’s supposed to be a bed, but it looks like its alive with all the insects that are crawling around in it. There are dark black stains all around the room, splatters of it going up the walls, which are dripping with damp. Tony shudders as he sees the high barred window; a pigeons nest is perched on the ledge, but the bird has gone, probably scared off from all the noise. May is in one corner; she is lying very. Still, her lips are blue, and her eyes are closed. She’s covered in dirt and blood; there’s a pool of it surrounding her. If Tony hadn't studied the picture Peter showed him very carefully; he wouldn't have known it was her save for the clothes she’s wearing. Tony sighs and swears loudly, the realisation setting in that Peter may have lost another relative.
A slightly strangled noise escapes Steve’s lips as he watches Tony and Bucky, the table is nearly split in half as he takes in sight before him. Never in his dreams has this talk gone as well as this; he had half dreaded this, he had laid in bed thinking about what would go wrong, now though he’s watching the two people he’s in love with kiss, and it is the best feeling. Bucky’s foot finds his; Steve taps Bucky’s toes, a silent approval of what’s happening. He can see the waiter studiously not watching their table, the kiss becomes more heated; Steve coughs a little uncomfortably.
Tony is in the kitchen, his hands curled around a cup of cocoa, a tablet is propped against the milk; JARVIS is playing a video or something on it. He humming softly, though sometimes he slips into singing; he’s in track pants and a stained tank top, Steve hears Bucky draw in a sharp breath, he assumes because of what just happened and how close Tony was to it. Tony’s hair is ruffled like he just got out of bed, there’s pillow marks on his face; the warm gold light that streams out from the one lamp on in the room makes his skin look so soft and warm that Steve just wants to bury himself in it. His foot is tapping some distant rhythm on the footrest of the stool, his track pants have oil and paint stains, they are also very baggy and very familiar. Steve stifles a laugh as he realises that Tony is wearing his track pants, there is nothing he wants to do more than to draw the scene in front of him, but he forces himself to cough.
Alaska is as cold and icy as Bucky remembers it from the last time he’d been there. The building is just a little ways out of the centre of Anchorage. Most of its windows have been blown out in some way shape or form, and broken glass litters the forecourt. The corrugated iron door is rusting; there are large holes in it where water has been dripping down and corroding the metal through. Bucky is glad his night vision is almost perfect because Alaska is dark, he’s almost sure that if he looked up at the sky a myriad of stars would be visible. The darkness does mean that the HYDRA agents think they have cover, they don’t. The gun is one of Stark’s best, it handles beautifully, and it built for Bucky himself; it’s so intuitive he barely has to twitch the trigger. He and Clint have taken out about fifteen before the forecourt is cleared enough for the others to go in, Clint hopping down from the roof to follow Natasha. Bucky stays outside, hoping that everyone makes it out alright.
“Do you even live here?” Tony shoots back, “thought you had a shitty apartment in Bed-Stuy? Why are you here eating my pop tarts and interrupting my conversations?”
“That ain’t my old arm,” Bucky whispers in his ear, “that ain’t the HYDRA arm is it?” His voice is shaky and filled with a hidden depth of emotion, something that Tony has never heard from Bucky before.
“Bucky?” Steve looks at him, they’re still fighting the lizards, but Steve is completely focussed on his best friend.
Tony feels the walls closing in on him, the room is suddenly too dark; Steve is suddenly too close. His chest feels like it is being crushed under the pressure of a thousand imaginary waves of icy cold water. It feels as though there is nothing he can do, that he is in a car that is spinning off the road and there is nothing he can do to stop it. Steve is saying something to JARVIS, probably asking him to trace Bucky’s last known location but Tony only hears it like Steve is behind glass. His body has become his enemy, his lungs won’t work properly and his brains won’t think anything but ‘not again’ the words repeat for him two thousand, three thousand times becoming more and more garbled with each repetition. Tony knows that he’s having a panic attack, he is violently aware of it, he can pinpoint the exact moment worry became fear which became something more. His entire world is off its axis, spinning wrong; he feels like he exists somewhere slightly to the left of where everyone else is.
They walk down the corridor towards Peter’s room, Tony keeps his hands over Peter’s eyes, before he stops in front of the door. He tells Peter to keep his eyes shut as he opens the door and leads Peter inside, the rest of the team following behind. Steve lets out an audible gasp, the room has changed from the boring guest room Peter had been living in before; now it is a teenage boy’s paradise. The walls had been an impersonal beige; now they’re a light blue; there’s a mural on the wall with the largest amount of blank space; the whole solar system (and more) covers it, some of the stars even twinkle with a soft yellow light. Half of one of the other walls is a chalkboard, at the moment its covered in the specs for Bucky’s arm and the Iron Man suit. The bed has been replaced with a high sleeper; there's a sofa and a desk under it, the sofa looks like its a fold out one so that Peter can have friends to stay. There’s a worktop which looks like it’s a miniature version of Tony’s lab on one corner; and standing beside it is a smaller version of Dummy, the bot who Peter had fallen in love with the first time he’d sneaked into the workshop. Natasha is looking at Tony with a smile on her face; Steve has never seen her look so soft before.
“Can’t she just let me sleep? What press conference?” Tony sighs, cracking open one eye, feeling cold from where Steve has left his side.
“How dare you,” Tony nearly shouts, “you threw yourself into that with no warning, no plan, and you call me reckless. You could have been killed, would have been if we aren’t all freakishly in tune with each other. This was too much, too much risk-taking; I was only there in time because Barnes yelled for me.” He pushes Steve into the window; they haven't even made it into the tower. “You’re supposed to be the leader of this team, do you have any idea what I would- what they would do if you died?” Steve shakes his head; he’s in shock, the way Tony is speaking to him is something he’s not heard before. “We’d crumble,” Tony rests his head on Steve’s chest. “I’d crumble.”
“Fine,” Peter sighs, “it was worth a try, Doctor Chavez, don’t want to bother Bruce.” He yawns, it’s a whole body thing, as though he’s lost what little energy he’d gained by sleeping on the ‘jet.
“It’s all my fault,” he croaks out, “I didn't get to you in time, if I had gotten to you earlier then they wouldn't have died.”
“You’re not that you anymore.” Steve is shaking his head again, Bucky feels like he’s intruding on a private conversation, but he doesn't want to leave Tony, he doesn’t want to leave either of them. “Sure, you might have been that person once, but you ain’t him anymore,” Bucky smiles as Steve’s Brooklyn accent slips out as it always does when he gets frustrated. “Who is the one that makes sure Wanda gets out of her room to eat? Who is the one that can get Bruce to calm down the fastest? Cause it sure as hell ain’t me. Who was the one that sat up with Bucky that first night he was in the tower? Who was the one that kept me sane when I was out of commission for a month? Who is the one that keeps makes sure every new member of the team never feels left out? Who gave over his goddamn tower for us? Who makes sure there’s always food? You, Tony, not me, not Fury or Phil, you. That doesn’t sound like someone who would make a bad father to me.”
“Uh, well, I feel like I needed a connection to the addition to the foundation; this is a personal thing for me. Being bisexual myself,” The room erupts into a cacophony of noise, the press go crazy when Tony speaks, he just smiles and continues to talk above the sound. “I felt like I needed to do something for kids like me, for kids who experience the same kind of issues that I have also experienced. I wanted to give back to a community I feel that I have been separated from my whole life, so this is me giving back.” He nods and looks around the room, “any other questions?”
The scene of the murder looks exactly like every other murder scene Clint has ever seen, and he’s seen more than his fair share. The guy was killed by a bullet to the back of the head, that’s pretty clear to see. He was obviously kneeling, facing away from his killer, he’d been tied up with something, there are still grooves in his wrists and on his arms from the stuff, but there is no trace of it left. Clint’s inspected the vents and even those are clear from any trace evidence; the cops have fingerprint swept the scene and nothing has turned up. Even Natasha looks baffled; she’s talking to Agent Coulson in hushed voices. Clint sits on the desk that’s in the corner of the room, it was clearly an office of sorts, but there are no papers or books left. He’s running his fingers over the wood, feeling the grain of it when he notices the mark.
“Why just LGBT youth? Why not all homeless youth?” The question comes from the guy with Fox News round his neck. Tony feels Bucky stiffen beside him, “why would you discriminate?”
“Fuck,” Tony says, squeezing just a little tighter, “Bucky, are you okay?” All he gets is a quick grunt of yes in confirmation before he turns his attention to the man in his grasp. “Right, party time is over shithead, who do you work for?” He slams the agent into the closest wall, making sure that the rough concrete shreds the clothes and skin from the man’s back. “Come on, it’s not like they're going to be able to save you, you fucks took my son; if there’s something you should know about me is that I don’t like it when people take my shit. So come on, who do you work for?” Tony holds the man a solid two feet off the ground; there's sweat and blood trickling down the man’s face as he gasps for any air he can take in.
“Of course, Sergeant,” JARVIS says mildly, “try entering the numbers 1,2,1,6,1,9,9,1.” Tony freezes, he has an agent by the neck, the man is quivering with the flow of air to his brain being restricted.
Tony’s gaze is sharp, calculating as he looks at Bucky, “what do you mean?” he asks, brown eyes focussed intently.
Tony nods at this; he seems satisfied with Bucky’s answer, they spend the rest of the elevator ride down to the press room in silence. Their hands are brushing as the doors open on into the green room, Pepper rushes at them as they step out the elevator. Tony is bubbling with that nervous kind of energy, the one he always gets before he steps in front of the cameras, it’s the kind of energy that will leave him drained once it’s gone. Pepper’s talking about something that sounds like it could be significant, but Tony is too busy watching Bucky get put through the pre-conference ritual.
Peter is sitting at the breakfast bar, listening to Clint explain his arrows, he’s got one hand on a fork and the other tracing the arrows’ fletching. Clint’s smiling, always happy to talk about archery; Tony looks on, both hands curled around a coffee mug. Steve watches him, dark brown eyes catching the few rays of warm morning sun turning them the colour of whiskey. Tony has this tiny small smile on his face; he’s resting on the countertop, he looks so gentle and soft; he was breathing slowly his head angled towards Peter.
The burgers had been just what Steve had imagined as he’d read Bucky’s sister’s letter all those years ago in France; now though Steve is being dragged into the penthouse by his wrist, out of the corner of his eye, he can see New York glistening below him. Years have passed, but the city still has the same soul; he feels Tony move behind him, Tony’s arms encircling his waist and Tony’s lips against his neck. Bucky is there in front of him, broken and remade, the same but different all at once; but he still has the same core, the same soul, much like New York. Steve draws Bucky to him, their lips touch, and Steve is home. He sighs into the kiss, smiling as he feels Bucky’s lips turn up at the corners; Tony is running a hand down his back.
“Hey, J, what happened to the-“ Tony turns on instinct, looking around to see Bucky standing in the entrance to his workshop, the fingers on his metal arm flexing and spasming. “So, you did actually damage it?” Bucky nods, Tony walks towards him. “Honestly, did you think you could get by without coming to see me about it? Because I’m looking at that arm and I kind of want to cry, what the hell did you do to it?”
bi means two so whenever you encounter a bisexual, there is a smaller, angrier bisexual hiding nearby. watching. waiting.
“Yeah, Tony,” Steve sighs, still ignoring the way the rest of the team is most definitely staring at them.
That tweet makes him stop and think, he takes about two minutes to think of a suitable reply, he glances at Tony who’s looking at Steve profile. Bucky takes a breath, this is what he wanted to do, this is why he came out. To help people who may be in the same situation as he was. The woman’s profile picture shows her with what must be her girlfriend, he clicks on her profile; she’s a reporter for some LGBT newspaper. He smiles as he replies.
Bucky’s whole demeanour changes in a matter of moments, he’s smiling brightly a Bruce, like he hasn’t just been rejected by his best friend. “That’d be great, Doc, thanks. I used ta cook, you know when Stevie was too sick. Never was great-“
They’re deathly silent, Tony and Steve, as they take out every Hydra agent in the room; it’s almost methodical the way they work together to deal out blows. It must only take them five minutes to take down fifteen or so men, because, Clint and Natasha have only just started to patch up Ben’s wounds. Ben is breathing, Tony is relieved to see, but only just; the breaths are shallow and short, they seem to be painful too.
“Alright, Sergeant, we need back up on the lower ground floor, can you come in,” Steve sounds a little out of breath, but Tony tunes it out as more agents pour up from the staircase.
“Steve, can we talk?” Tony says as soon as Steve enters the common area, he stiffens up, almost imperceptibly. Tony realises what he’s said and corrects himself, “not a bad talk, I promise.” Steve relaxes and walks forward towards him, Tony meets him, pulling him into a little hug; kissing his cheek, he says, “just wanted to tell you that Bucky, you, and I are going to get burgers and talk about our feelings and grown-up shit tonight. Clint’s watching Peter, he’s out with Buck right now, but they should be back soon.”
“Talk to me, Buck,” Steve says through the comms, switching to a private channel so as not to distract the team.
Tony finishes the letter with tears in his eyes, he remembers Mary, he remembers her breaking up with him; he doesn't remember much else though. For the first time, he properly looks at Peter, and he sees so much of her in him that it makes him choke up a little. He isn't even mad at Pepper for providing his DNA without asking him. Reality is slowly setting in on him and he’s pretty sure he has no idea what to do.
“Yeah, you’re right. Mission first,” Steve nods, he knows that this is Tony trying to distract him from Bucky, but he’s grateful for it. He moves to stand, but not before he presses a kiss to Tony’s forehead. “I’ll get your son; you save my friend.”
“I was in Siberia, being cryogenically frozen and then brought out to kill people, forgive me for not being up to date with pop culture.” Bucky sighs, he tries to be annoyed, he really does, but he can’t help the warm feeling that bubbles in the pit of his stomach and worms its way up through his chest. He’d been floating for so long, aimless, with no family to ground him; but now, now he has everything he’s ever really wanted.
“Let’s see, is it going to be like that time you asked me to come fix your DVD player that was so ancient and hopeless? Because honestly, Clint, I am not sure I can deal with that again,” Tony says shaking his head but the gesture is full of fond exasperation. “Yeah, of course, I’ll help her out, just tell her to give Pepper a call, and she’ll put something in my diary.”
“What does Mister Barnes have to do with the whole thing?” A girl with the red Buzzfeed logo around her neck asks. “Is he emotional support or did he have a hand in the foundation’s inception?”
They take their seats in front of the ravenous crowd of press, flashes go off as the paparazzi take pictures; Tony squints, it is still far too early for this, he has totally not had enough caffeine to deal with what’s about to happen. He watches as Pepper sits down behind the cameras, she smiles as he flicks through the cards she handed to him. They tell him precisely what to say, he mind flashes back to one particular press conference, one where he’s put down the cards that had been handed to him, it feels like his life began for him at that moment. Still, he decides that this time, he’s going to stick to the cards that are in his hands, he looks downs at them and then looks at Pepper. A small nod from her and he begins to speak.
“He did?” Tony raises his eyebrow, but he’s still wearing that soft, sappy look; Bucky feels himself die a little more inside.
“Go home Steve,” Tony says, pressing a kiss to Steve’s hair, “I’ve got him. Don’t worry, I’ll be here; I won’t leave him.”
“In that case, I’ll just leave and take this vodka with me. You know I was totally up for a meeting of the ‘I hate men club’ but,” she sighs and rolls her eyes, before heading for the air vent. “I guess you’re totally fine, Barnes, that’s why you’re curled up here like an eighty-four-year-old woman while Stark and Rogers are having a cosy little board game night in the communal room.”
“Maybe something less,” he takes a breath, “eye-catching you know, this arm ain’t exactly subtle, Tony, it gives me away when I’m trying not to be noticed.”
It’s not until later, once they’re all sitting at the table in the kitchen that Steve is hit by the freight trains that are his feeling for Tony. Bucky notices him tense; their legs are pressed together under the table; he turns to Steve with a questioning eye. Steve just shakes his head, and turns to laugh at something Natasha said; Bucky grabs his wrist under the table and tugs three times.
“Yeah, yeah, sure Cap,” Tony nods, not taking his eyes off his son, “just lemme get some more coffee, not sure when I emptied this mug but there’s nothing in it and that should be against the law.” He pours himself another cup, lifting the pot in Steve’s direction; Steve smiles a little and shakes his head.
“Ugh, if that’s you when you’re out of shape I can’t wait to get my hands on you when you’re back in peak physical form,” Tony leans forward and squeezes his bicep. “Yeah, I think it’d be better for Bucky to take Peter the first time he tries jumping off a building, not that I encourage that, I’d just prefer for him to be with someone when he does it. He’s my kid. He’s going to do anyway, I just want him to do it with adult supervision.” Tony pulls Bucky up so that they’re face to face, Steve turns around in-between Tony’s legs. “Make sure he comes back in one piece, yeah Barnes?” Tony grins as he kisses Bucky on the lips gently, before deepening it. Bucky can feel Steve’s eyes on them, burning into the back of his head, before he breaks the kiss with Tony and turns to Steve.
“Good,” Ben shudders, his breath rattling in his chest. “Raise him right, Stark.” He says, and then he tenses once before he releases a puff of air, and his chest doesn't move again.
Also I'm going into my final year of university in september so that means I have a thesis (10,000 words) due and I am working on that before I go back in the fall. So yeah... updates are going to be few and far between.
“Sir, I have completed a scan of the building, using data from the Avenger’s night vision goggles, there is a reinforced room with a significant electromagnetic signature on the lower ground floor; it seems that Sergeant Barnes is the closest to it,” JARVIS says.
“Sorry, Cap,” Tony mumbles, “didn’t want you to try and stop me.” He doesn't get a proper response to that, just a huff of air which could have been a small laugh.
“Steve,” Tony says, but he knows that Steve is already moving as fast as he can. He can see Bucky’s vitals dropping even as the seconds go by; all he can do is kick through the agents swarming the stairs, trying to get to Bucky as soon as possible.
“With all due respect, Sir,” JARVIS sounds serious, “I do not think that would be in your best interest, not until your energy levels are within more normal parameters.” Tony considers this before he passes out on the roof.
“Stark, I’m here to help, if you can’t help but be annoying then at least you could be quiet.” Strange steps forward, there’s a green light coming from the ugly necklace thingy that’s sitting around his neck. His red cape thing rises behind him, and Tony looks down to see him floating about four inches from the floor. It's a little extravagant for Tony's taste, the whole floating thing, but the wizard doesn't seem to be a threat so he lets it slide, for now.
“Why don’t we do presents now?” Steve says, running his hand through Tony’s hair, his other hand is resting Bucky’s ankle. He’s not sure he could feel more content than he is right now. And, he’s reluctant to leave his spot but, Tony is getting more and more restless beside him so he’s not sure his peace would last much longer anyway.
“They were supposed to be back,” Tony says, his voice a little hoarse, his arms coming up to circle his knees which have moved to his chest. “This wasn’t supposed to happen again.”
“JARVIS, gimme options,” Tony asks as he dips and dives past the Hydra agents that had crowded around the warehouse.
“Approaching New York at a speed of 2,500 km/h, Sir,” the AI says, “all relevant authorities have been informed of your arrival; Ms Potts has Mr Parker in the rnd lab on the twentieth floor.”
The remote alarm that’s always attached to each Avenger goes off at that moment; they look at each other once more before they pull away. Tony activates the bracelets even as he’s stepping out the car, the Iron Man suit covering him quickly, moving over his body like liquid. It only takes Steve a moment longer to suit up, before he’s joining Tony in the car park.
“Hey, Tones,” Rhodey smiles, as he walks into Tony’s workshop. “There’s something you need to hear, something you need to see, buddy. But, they want to make sure you’re in the right place to see and hear this. So they sent me.” Rhodey lays a hand on his shoulder, not even commenting about the shattered cup and computer on the floor; that’s how Tony knows it’s serious.
Honestly, Steve forgets if Tony is the child and Peter the adult. He chuckles, but then he’s presented with a small, square box. He looks up. Tony is kneeling in front of him. On one knee. Bucky is grinning, he’s fiddling with something in his pocket. Steve’s throat knits itself shut. Tony is taking a deep breath. The others are smiling as they gather around them.
“Yeah,” Tony nods, “yeah I can do this.” He’s shaking when he stands; his knees can’t find a way to keep him upright. He half collapses before Steve’s arm works its way around his waist, holding Tony against his body.
“Are you guys done making out? You know that really isn’t appropriate for the common areas,” Clint mutters from behind them, “honestly, I think you scarred Bruce.”
“Yeah, I’ve just been teaching Buck, figured I could teach you both at the same time. You got anywhere else to be today?” Tony asks, one of his arms snaking around Steve’s chest, pulling him closer.
Their gift to Peter, a teddy wearing a small Iron Man helmet is a huge success. Bucky had remembered Peter telling them that he’d lost his childhood teddy when he’d moved all his stuff from his aunt and uncle’s place into the tower. Peter’s eyes go wide as he sees the bear’s ears peaking out from the helmet; he tries to act all grown up as he thanks Steve and Bucky, but they both notice how the bear never leaves Peter’s side. The smile Tony gives them is worth everything, it’s small but full of warmth; he mouths ‘thank you’ at them as Peter sits the bear on his lap. The rest of the team hand over their own presents; Bruce’s is a hand built chemistry set (which clearly states that it is only to be used under his supervision), Natasha’s is a set of vintage Captain America comics, Clint gives Peter a nerf gun (he pulls out one for each of them with a wide grin). Peter thanks all of them profusely, he’s grinning and laughing with frosting from his cake smeared all over his mouth.
“Uh, yeah, thanks Tony, think I ate something a little funky is all,” He relaxes back into the chair, letting Tony get at the part where the arm becomes his shoulder. “And now is fine, might as well, the alarm hasn’t gone off today. How long will I be out of action for?”
Peter’s room is down the hall from Tony’s; it has a sign on the door with his name on, which is written on a plastic Captain America shield. Peter had said it was too babyish when Tony had suggested it to him as they walked through Target, but it had ended up in their cart anyway. He smiles, it feels really good to be home, he’d spent so long in the hospital with Bucky that he’d forgotten the little quirks of the tower. There’s only one small difference, the webbing which covers the door, Steve raises an eyebrow but pushes into the room anyway.
“Aw, Natasha, no,” Clint mumbles as he drinks the energy shot. “Right then, why I always have to do the shitty tasks I don’t know but here we go. I don’t want to do this I just want a nap and my dog.”
“Oh, that’s the ‘not a date,’” Peter nods sagely, as though he knows everything in the whole universe. “I get it, and honestly it’s cool with me, that means three times the awesome presents right?”
“Really?” Tony laughs and raises an eyebrow, “really?” Peter nods laughing a little himself, “wow, okay I think Clint is ordering pizza as I speak, that good?”
“Kids are good actors,” Clint shrugs, “I would know,” its one of those strange moments where Clint, who is usually so quiet about his past makes a reference to his life so casually. The other two stop and look at him, but Clint has shut himself off again and his face is closed.
“Lucky we got you, huh?” Bucky smiles, passing Tony the wrench before he even asks for it, “are you going to have to replace much of it? Only I’ve been thinking of a different color scheme for it.”
“It would never be quite warm enough, ‘specially when the weather got worse,” Bucky nods as he walks out the room.
“Right, so what about the new suit you were making me, the one that had vibranium threaded through it? You said that sewing was never your forte, but you were trying to find a way to combine the original material and vibranium?” Steve maybe isn't as gifted with science as Tony, he’s never really taken the time to study it, but the serum has given him a brain that could handle things better than he’s ever been able to. He’s trying to take advantage of it, he’s never had the opportunities he has now and he owes it to everyone to use his brain; he knows he does.
“Go to the little flashing green light,” Bucky gasps for air, “there’s a panel there with a keypad, enter the code, 1,2,1,6,1,9,9,1.”
“If you two are finished, then go suit up,” Tony’s voice comes from the suit, all cold and impersonal, but the worry and dread that have coloured his words in the last few days are still evident. “I want my son back.”
“Barnes, if you complete that sentence,” Tony stops himself from saying something that would have been equally rude. “Not in front of Peter.”
“We should get back,” he breathes, but he doesn’t move, “Peter, I need to talk to Peter, I promised to take him to Coney Island.”
“I am a functioning adult, Steve; I can take care of myself,” Tony grimaces and tried to dodge around Steve to get back to the safety of his lab.
“No,” this time Tony raises his voice, “I fought for so long for him to have a normal fucking life, I did everything I could to keep him from things like this. And I only got a year, that’s not fair, they got longer with him than I did. So if he doesn't remember that, then all’s the better, I will tell him what happened, but I don’t want him to remember it. When he’s been told he can decide for himself. I cannot make that call for him; I won’t make that call for him. But right now, I want to hug my son and kiss Bucky Barnes so damn hard that if you don’t let me go and see them right now, Rhodey, I will suit up and blast past you anyway.”
“No, you nearly burned down our apartment, we had to get the fire crew in and everything,” Steve snorts, Bruce turns a little pale. “It was fine though, and it’d be nothin’ that JARVIS couldn’t handle. Don’t worry Doctor Banner, Bucky can control himself.”
“Shit-“ Peter crawls off the ceiling, dropping down easily, as if he’d been hanging out on ceilings all his life, and lands next to Steve. “Steve! Where’s Tony? Where’s the rest of the team? Oh hi, Clint! Sam!! Wanda, you’re all here! Where’s Bucky? Where’s Natasha? And Thor? Are they okay? Are they hurt, I hope none of you got hurt trying to rescue me.”
“Hi, kid,” Tony croaks out, “come on we can head through to the living room and you can tell me everything.”
“That is the biggest pile of shit I have ever heard,” Clint laughs as he sits at the breakfast bar, stealing some of Steve’s toast. “You are barely even an adult, let alone a functioning one. Thanks for breakfast, Stevie.”
“Something like that,” Steve says, after getting a small nod from Tony, “I’m here to make sure that everything’s okay.” Peter seems satisfied with that, so he nods and carries on following Tony to the offices.
“No, no it’s not,” Tony shakes his head, breaking the hug and pushing the box towards Bucky, “I made it new for you, I know you didn't ask me to; I didn't get rid of the old one, I actually did the same colour scheme for that one too. In case you wanted that one. But uh, this is new, all of it. It’s almost all vibranium, like the one you’re wearing at the moment, but this one allows you to feel sensation. Touch, pressure, rough, smooth, hot, and cold, everything; you’ll be able to use it just like your flesh arm. Um, so, yeah… I was actually thinking about making a titanium-gold alloy version, one that’s less expensive to produce and pumping them into the VA.” Tony looks away as Bucky’s eyes grow ominously wet.
“You’re not going to mess things up, and, he’s not straight.” Bucky shrugs, he sees Steve’s raised eyebrow and grins. “No straight man would look at your ass like that.” He says, enjoying the blush that paints itself across Steve’s cheeks and down his neck, disappearing below the collar of his t-shirt. “Come on, the kid’ll be gettin’ impatient, and the others will be wondering where we’ve disappeared to.”
“Something nice, but not too nice, and a little funny too; we should revive Steve’s account, I made him one ages ago, but he never uses it.” Tony looks up at the ceiling, “JARVIS is Steve done in the shower now?”
Bucky’s eyes open about a second after. There’s a horrible choking sound as he tries to breathe through the tubes, but Strange is there carefully removing them. Tony knows the feeling, of something choking you, making it so no air can get to your lungs, the sense of fire spreading through his chest. He shakes his head and says Bucky’s name, softly, just loud enough for the super soldier to hear. Bucky turns to see Tony standing there, then he melts, he goes limp and relaxes.
“Yeah, kid. Couldn’t have you living in the old room if you’re going to be here forever,” Tony finds his arms full of a sobbing thirteen-year-old boy. “You alright, Pete? You need some time? Actually, it’s nearly midnight; you should be getting to bed, are you tired?” Peter shakes his head, but he’s yawning, Tony smiles. “If you go to bed now, you can have chocolate chip pancakes for breakfast tomorrow.” That sentence gets the desired reaction; Tony shoos the team out of the room as Peter scrambles for his pyjamas.
“I want to go back to school!” Peter almost yells, his voice is raised above a reasonable volume, and he looks panicked.
“That band with the lead singer who was bi?” Tony nods a little proudly, looking at Bucky with surprisingly soft eyes. “You sing good, Shellhead,” Bucky grins, moving away from Steve and sitting on the barstool next to Tony. They make a handsome pair, Steve’s mind wanders, all glossy brown hair and tan and pale skin mixing.
“Gross,” Tony jerks back when he hears Peter’s voice, his son is grinning even though he’s trying to make a disgusted face. Tony steps back, letting Steve pass him, as he reaches for Peter who flings himself into Tony’s arm without further ado. Tony finds himself being bowled into the couch, which is crammed into a corner of the room and not built for a fourteen-year-old who is almost taller than Tony. Tony, who isn't tiny himself thank you very much.
“Yeah, she ain’t my type,” Bucky tries for casual, but he fails, “you know, she’s missing certain things and has some things that I ain’t really in to. Honestly, if Stevie weren’t with you, she’d have more luck with ‘im.”
After Peter has calmed down enough, Clint, Sam, and Steve join Thor, Rhodes, and Natasha to do one more completely final sweep of the building, before they burn it to the ground. They don’t find much, but there is a box of files that had been stored in a hidden alcove. Natasha finds it, it’s full of pieces of paper in Russian and about twenty memory drives. Tony takes it from her, he can upload the drives to JARVIS on the quinjet so the AI can start decrypting and filing the information.
“Okay,” Tony nods, “okay. I will.” He is dimly aware that he’s crying, the tears streaking down his cheeks and dripping off his chin. “I’ll take care of him.”
“Mr Parker is in the elevator, sir,” JARVIS says breaking the tension, there’s a collective breath from all three men in the room. “He appears to be in good health, though he is sleep deprived. He is also exhibiting signs of extreme stress and anxiety.”
“Only five seconds more Peter, take twenty deep breaths, and we’ll probably be done,” the doctor sitting next to Tony says as he moves the cursor down the screen. “Has Peter broken this ankle before, Mr Stark?”
“Bucky,” Steve chokes out, they’ve stopped moving; Steve desperately wants Bucky to look at him, but he won’t, his long hair obscures the side of his face closest to Steve. “Buck-“
“Hey Petey, you’re okay, we’ve got you,” he says slowly, as though Peter is a frightened wild animal. “You’re gonna be okay. Do you mind if I help you into the chair?” His frantically beating heart is soothed when Peter shakes his head and holds an arm.
“Meeting with Fury at twelve, then I promised Peter I would help him train a little,” Steve shrugs, “I could reschedule the meeting? Why it won’t take that long will it?”
Burger Heaven is perfect, it looks as though the design of it hasn't changed since the fifties; Tony can see how excited Steve and Bucky are to be somewhere that isn't too far removed from a time that was only a few years ago to both of them. He smiles as he takes in the yellow Formica topped tables and chrome fronted kitchen, complete with window; there’s a bar with white stools and banquettes with cobalt vinyl covers. Steve is grinning as they’re lead to a bigger booth, one meant for four; slides in first, to his surprise it’s Bucky that presses in next to him. He doesn't hate the feeling of Bucky’s thigh squashed against his, though, he likes the heat of it. There’s something about seeing the open adoration on Steve’s face that warms him from the inside out. Tony surprises himself as he considers these feelings, he was going to tell the other two that he didn't want to be part of a throuple, that he was happy to try out the V relationship. Now he realises he doesn't exactly want that.
Tony is standing outside the building, he’s taken the suit off; though Clint can still see Bucky’s blood that had wormed its way through the suit, he shudders slightly, hoping no one else notices it. Peter rushes forward when he sees his dad, Tony smiles and hugs him close, until Peter pushes away with a small grumble of ‘not cool Tony’; but Tony knows that Peter really does want a hug, and he draws him in again. He presses a kiss to the top of Peter’s head, and Peter makes no noise of complaint, even though it’s only been a week.
“You don’t have to do this for me, you know,” Tony says quietly, fiddling with a cufflink; it’s shaped like a tiny version of Steve’s shield, though to the untrained eye it would be easily noticeable. “I don’t want you to feel like you need to do this, not just for this charity or me.”
“Hey guys, where’s Bucky?” Peter says jumping down from the wing, “Did he not come? Is he okay? What about Natasha, and Bruce, Thor, and Rhodey?” He’s rocking on the balls of his feet, his arms swinging loosely at his sides.
“I want to announce the Stark Homes Project,” his hands are shaking, “a project that is going to be rolled out nationwide in the next year. The Stark Homes are safe houses for LGBT young adults, too many of our LGBT in America are homeless due to hatred and bigotry. These kids are left alone with no one, they need a safe place to go, with employees training therapy and full access to online school programmes, the Stark Homes are going to be that safe place. Questions?”
“We’re going to get the cleanup squad in; they’re going to bring May and Ben back to New York, while we go to the debrief; I’ll make it quick. Actually, I’ll do the debrief on the quinjet; Fury will have to deal with it.” Steve says, placing a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Then you’re going to go home, and explain what happened to Peter, and you’re going to be there for your son.”
Thank you all for leaving the kudos and the comments you have! It means a lot to me, really it does and I really appreciate every one of them.
“Tony has PTSD, or he did have, after New York, Extremis, and Afghanistan, you know,” Steve pauses, “he’s recovering, but he still sometimes has panic attacks.”
“Yeah, Pete, they have to make sure that you are okay; the only way to do that properly is to take some blood. Or, I supposed if we asked him really nicely, Bruce could come and do it; cause you trust Bruce, right?” Tony sighs, “Would you be okay with a blood test if Bruce did it?”
“This is all for me?” Peter gazes around the room in wonder, “you did this for me?” He looks at Tony, clearly on the verge of tears.
“You’ve been here for four days, Steve,” Tony says moving so that he sat beside Steve, he’s looking at Bucky; one of his hands comes to rest on Bucky’s wrist just above Steve’s own. “You’ve been sitting here without eating or sleeping. I know you can go for longer than average without either, but I also know that you need a break. At least a shower and some food.” Tony turns to face him, his other hand stroking across Steve’s face and into his hair. He pulls Steve’s head down and rests it against his shoulder in a kind of hug. “Please, go and take care of yourself; if there’s any change, I’ll have JARVIS notify you.”
“We can talk about that,” Bucky mumbles, “I know exactly what you mean. I’m already seeing a therapist for it, so maybe if your dad says yes, you could sit in on one of my sessions and see if you think it’ll help for you to go too.”
“I’m almost there pal; I need ya to stay with me okay?” Steve says, his stomach is sinking, he hopes that the serum HYDRA injected into Bucky is enough to keep him alive.
“You did?” Steve smiles, his eyes lighting up as he turns into Tony, “I wasn't sure there were places left.” He’s so excited that it melts Tony’s heart.
“You are currently on three million re-tweets; the majority of the comments are overwhelmingly positive,” JARVIS says, and Tony swears there’s a little bit of love in his voice.
Bucky grins and huffs out a slight laugh, it’s all he can manage with Stark’s hands literally in his shoulder. The arm comes off quickly, more easily than it ever did, since Stark last got his hands on it, and Bucky is sure that when he gets back, there will be two or three new things for him to learn about. Stark is smiling as he talks about Peter, it’s such a soft look, his face has gone from genius scientist to proud dad in a matter of minutes.
“Well, if we’re going to keep doing this as a team, then I need to get with the programme,” Tony mutters, though the suit amplifies it anyway. “Okay, clench up Capsicle.”
There’s a tense moment where Bucky just sits in the chair, he’s breathing really slowly, trying to calm himself down. Tony hops from foot to foot, hoping that the arm is working correctly, he’s almost tempted to ask JARVIS to scan Bucky’s brain, but he holds off. Steve comes up behind him, resting a hand on his waist, grounding him; Tony feels all the nervous energy that had been surging through his body dissipate a bit. Bucky opens his eyes, they’re blue and electric, and alive in a way Tony feels like has been missing since the Winter Soldier had taken over. There’s a huge grin stretched across Bucky’s face; he rushes to his feet, and deliberately paints a line down Tony’s face, down his neck, and across Steve’s hand.
Tony, for once in his life actually does what Steve says; he gives into the call of sleep and drifts off, letting the darkness take him. He remains asleep until JARVIS buzzes, he groans and considers telling the AI to ignore the call. Beside him, Bucky moans and puts a pillow over his head; Steve chuckles. Tony can feel the bed dip from where Steve has sat up, the pressure increases as Steve actually gets up.
Steve is still, his hand's rest by his sides, swinging there uselessly; he doesn’t know what to do. It takes him a minute before he realises that Tony’s finished. With his hand trembling he reaches down and lifts Tony’s chin so that he’s looking and him in the eyes. He moves the hand that under Tony’s chin so that it cups his jaw, Steve strokes his thumb across Tony’s cheekbone. Tony is entirely too aware of Steve’s leg that is slowly but surely making its way between his own.
“Curry,” he says, in a quiet voice, he smiles at Steve gesturing to the steaming bowl in front of him. “Sorry, I didn’t wanna start without you, but I’m gonna fade away if I don’t put some food in my face in, like, a hot minute.”
“Tony, I love it,” Bucky looks at him, really looks at him, Tony is standing very close; their shoulders are touching where they’re bending over the hologram together. Tony’s deep brown eyes are worried and unsure, a look Bucky never expected him to wear. “Always thought I should get rid of the star now ‘m back to workin’ for the right side.” He squeezes Tony’s shoulder, “and the black is good too. Thank you, Tony.” He wants Tony to know how much he appreciates everything he’s done for him, Bucky never expected Tony to forgive him for everything he did. Tony had done more than that, he’d brought Bucky into his home and given Bucky everything he’s ever wanted. Tony relaxes as he glances at Bucky’s face, and breaks into a smile. It’s that moment when Bucky knows that he’s fucked up, he’s gone on both Tony and Steve, and it’s pulling him in two. He coughs and pulls back slightly, Nat’s voice in his head echoes, telling him that it’s okay, but his heart won’t let him believe it. “Блядь, почему я?” He whispers, Tony pulls back too, concern etched in the line between his eyebrows.
