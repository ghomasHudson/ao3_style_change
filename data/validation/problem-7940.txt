This horrible de ja vu of looking at the faces of people he loved and know they were dead.
Tony snickered, “And they are moody, I know how pep gets. Should we get them ice cream? Hey Jarvis queue up Ally Mcbeal for Capsicle and the Space Viking, That time of the month.
“I don’t think we’ve met,” He spoke evenly with all the confidence exuded at countless board meetings and press conferences. Stark held out his hand with that photo flash ready smile of his. “Tony Stark.”
As the call, ended Tony was touching down on the balcony landing, the suit disassembling around him.
The man paused taking a folder from his coat…oh Christ what was this now. Photos of Tony with his pants off with some pop star -would not be the first time. This is why he did not like being handed things.  “My name is Emil Rockwell; I was a friend of your fathers a very long time ago.”
“I told you to go before we left Clinton.” Phil chimed in from the quinjet. “ I can switch on the tracking in Caps boots if no one has him.”
The first time i lost you i swore never again, yet like a foolish child i found my time lacking and looked for sport in your world. It was at war and i thought perhaps i would find what it meant to serve a cause rather than fight by the side of those who never cared. I wanted ..to feel something perhaps.
AU- College
“Yeah yeah…” The little red mer pulled his hand back eye the blood seeping from his palm.
Thor frowned as the baby cried weakly; he could since the brokenness of the child’s voice. “My father’s hair was dark in his youth that is how. Much as I suspect the father of this child. You are a cold creature indeed Amora, betraying my brother by trying to pass his child off as mine. Do you desire a crown so fiercely?”
Life doesn't work that way, there is no quick fix and there are some scars you carry all your life. That's not to say that your heart is incapable of healing. However, wishing upon old adages that 'time heals all wounds' is not how you do it. It takes work and daily diligence, it takes accepting that someday won't be good.
Natasha needed more information, seeing Loki in his own element would give her an edge. Some might think that was exactly the wrong thing to do, that isolating the enemy in unfamiliar territory was the only way to get the truth. That wasn't wrong; it was a tactic that could be employed depending on ones query. However, getting Loki to come to the tower for a sit down was not going to happen.
Breathing deeply the omega relished in the last few moments of solitude. They needed to go back, the appointment was not over and if they were really going to do this the right, way they needed to give the baby every chance at health.  “Tony, I think I’m ready to go back.”
Being here rather than home in the cabin helped to also separate the feelings in his head. Right now his home- only reminded him of countless days alone. The small tile bathroom left him with only memories of sitting on the chilly floor while staring aimlessly at a locked door.
Steve relaxed into the embrace things finally felt like they were getting back to normal. While it was true that nothing would never be the same, it didn't mean it had to be bad. “That sounds good to me. Jarvis, would you?”
Next to her, Sam peeled a few potatoes. “She means it; I won’t stop her.”
The omega didn't seem to care enough to answer, just turned away and tried to curl up away from the Doctor.
“I just need you, and I kinda need ya not to faint.” Steve attempted a little humor and it worked
Actually... “Fine...”Tony grumbled after imagining Fury as the old kid-cooking granny in the Hansel and Gretel stories. Moreover, the dramatic swish of his matrix outlet mall coat. “But this early really?” he tried to appeal to his mates merciful nature; maybe this could wait a good hour or...four. Maybe…
“Sir, I have Doctor Simmons on line one.”
Bruce liked to think that he was a good judge of character, he had been to a lot of places and met a lot of people after all, so when he looked at the man before he knew he was telling the truth. Part of him felt bad for thinking otherwise. Yet to Er' is human isn't it? Maybe that's why Loki had managed to slip so far through the cracks. They all had their preconceived notions about the both of them. “Can you tell me what those problems are. It might help figure out how Loki got this way and maybe how to help him.”
The nation was going to raise their stars and bars, wailing tears from every front porch across the heartland. It would take a week tops for every fading musical artists to put out tributes and every street artist out there to cover blocks and train cars with the chiseled visage of Steven Grant Rogers.
“Be quiet Anthony I do not care how bored you are.”
Natasha took a sip of her tea, he was calling her bluff. Fake it until you make it. “Satisfaction brought him back. We say that too.”
Tony took it well, until he stood up and just kept muttering the word “baby” and hit the floor. Steve was almost 100% sure that the inventor had a stroke until a nurse cracked a capsule of smelling salts under the brunette’s nose that brought him back around. At which time Tony denied ever fainting, called it ‘
It was quiet and methodical, in a way more intimate than anything else as Steve tilted Tony’s head back taking off a strip of stubble. This was the second pass with the razor to get things cleaned up.  Afterward when Tony took a towel and cleaned off the remaining shaving cream, Steve pulled a face and touched the billionaire’s smooth chin.
Should he tell Steve about the phone call with Hansen? It wasn't like there was much ole Cap could do about it right now anyway, and he knows Steve is already stressed enough.
Romanov didn’t comment as she left, casting both men a look before shutting the door behind her.
However, things did not seem to be going as planed. It had been a couple of months since his heat, and Steve was starting to wonder if he was going to have another soon. He shouldn’t, he knew that because most omegas only have two a year maybe three when they first start. Nonetheless, with his hormones in god knows what kind of state he wasn’t sure. The idea of something being wrong again made him nerves. What if he could never be normal? What if it would affect his ability to bond?
“I want nothing from you. Get out of here and never return, if I see you again I will kill you self.” Thor would have gladly thrown her out but he thought first of his nephew sheltering in his arms. How unfortunate for a child to be burdened with such a heartless mother. “Guards! Take her way and see that she is well outside Asgard!”
Later that night Thor had smiled and kissed his brothers head, “you were very brave brother.”
“I…” Steve muttered looking up at him with heartbreaking eyes filled with tears. “I love him…”
The slim boy rocked forward from the over exuberant gesture and glared at the floor. He could have handled the company anyway. This did make things easier though, Tony could not think of a fate worse than being an omega. Those poor people got the shortest end of the stick when it came to society it really was not fair. Even then when the Omega suffrage movement had come so far, there was still staggering equality in wages and social views. Maybe one day he could help change that, wouldn’t the old man love that?
The cemetery was huge, and Steve stood at the gate for a long time - single red rose in hand. Tony deserved this much.
Barnes wrapped his arms around the slender waist of his mate. “There’s no rush darlin, when it’s right it’ll be right.”
The wake of victory the country would mourn the loss of another hero; they would all believe the narrative passed down that the brave young, Alpha, Steve Rogers. Gave his live to save the world from the destruction brought about by evil. Because that was the story they wanted in those days. It was the only story that would have been accepted. So that was the story they told.
“James, what are you doing?”
It's in those moments of quiet contemplation that the answer is always the same.
"I'm fine. The food is fine." the food was an inferno blazing down his esophagus and likely eating a hole through his sternum. Did they cook this battery acid?
They found their way wrapped around each other, sharing warmth and the soft glow of the reactor, all the while Tony hummed the soothing bars the song until he felt Steve lax against him.
Amora still was not worried, a man’s heart is a soft and easily swayed thing in her skillful grasp.
Steve lead the charge throwing his shield and using his fists to dispatch the metallic soldiers, the rest of the team working together to destroy the android decoys  left and right that ran about the city causing chaos and destruction. As far as Villains went, Scorpio was still on the ‘underwhelming’ end of the spectrum. The only thing he had on his side was numbers, and maybe hostility.
“It's positive...we're having a baby.”
“Just open the bay doors do it now.” Steve said already unfastening his seatbelt and heading toward the back.
“Pete we talked about this buddy, now back to bed.” Tony got up from his workbench staggering just a bit; he pinched the bridge of his nose to clear his head. “Daddy is working; we will talk in the morning ok?”
They all talked for a bit before Pepper started to nod off;  she had been having trouble sleeping due to the very active pup. Bruce And Natasha excused themselves, Banner heading into the kitchen to put on a kettle.
Steve glared over his shoulder, however it lacked it’s usually fire and just seemed cute.
If he rid the primitive little world of it’s avengers then what could they do to stop him?
“Stark.” There was warning in his tone, warning that even Nick didn’t believe. He couldn’t stop this man, not now. All he could do was fall back on the past and play on Stark’s emotions. “Is that really what Steve would have wanted, for you to go off and get yourself killed.”
However, it wasn’t, when Tony looked back he saw only a very concerned looking Thor whose voice was just starting to break through the fading shrill noise in the inventors ears.
Al Kurt could do was shake his head as he poured Loki more tea. “He never listens.”
“How’s things over at Camp X-brats, you guys do macaroni art and roast marshmallows with your eyes?”
Steve kept watching for any kind of reaction, but all Tony did was stare at the floor with his eyes darting back and forth as if he was trying to melt the linoleum with his thoughts. It was not a good sign, or at least it did not seem like one. The solider wanted to believe that maybe this was Tony’s way of working it out, that any second the engineer would leap up and yell ‘
“I picked out the color, hope you like it.”
That's it.

“Here.”
Maybe even six if there was an accident- and wasn't that just awful that he was sitting her hoping for a fender bender or a damn pile up just to get some time to huddle alone in a corner and scream.
They all turned to see a white haired man with a mustache in a well-tailored suit.
After nearly an hour, James had gently coaxed him into a warm shower where he carefully held him as water rained around them. His alpha had been so patient as he gently washed his skin and hair. Dried and even dressed him, it all felt like a blur. Sometime around breakfast Loki began to regain himself, like a fog parted ever so slightly. There was, nevertheless, a heaviness in his chest but not so oppressive as it had been hours before. His therapist had said this was normal. Loki hated that she said that.
Tony grinned and leaned into the camera, “Have a nice day Jemmakins, tell Fitz to come down and science with Bruce and me sometime!”
Steve was enraged, how could Fury even compare this to any of the calls he made in the field. “I could have handled this!” he grit, fist clenched at his sides. Steve was holding back an urge to punch the other man. Everything in him rebelling against what little respect he used to have for the man. When Fury told him that the world had been under the impression that Captain America was dead for over six month, he lost it.
“I said…. I think Jorry needs to go to little eel’s room and I should take him out before we leave. We really don’t want to come back to that.”
And immediately wanted to kill Tony Stark.
“Barnes, what's going on.” Tony was out of the nesting room and moving down to the penthouse bedroom. Still naked and wobbly from spending the last few backs in the 9x9 padded den with his omega. He clearly wasn't as young as he used to be (still in fighting form thank you!) First order of business would be a quick shower and pants...maybe coffee in the shower...(Focus Stark!)
A large warm hand fell on the inventors shoulder, followed by a broad chest molding to his back. “You won’t ruin this.”
Wow...Cd's are still a thing?
Loki entered his quarters and noticed Jormungand sparking unhappily as the sea serpent cornered a shivering servant girl. This would not have been unusual considering the overgrown eel tended to put most on edge, much as if Loki’s other pets whom were no longer allowed in the palace walls. However, what made this different was that the servant girl was holding a red-faced screaming babe.
“I was just thinking, Peter and Wendy will be starting per-school soon, then kindergarten so they won’t be as much of a handful at least for most of the day. In addition, the team has grown a lot in the last few years. We hardly ever get called out on joint missions any more, I haven’t had an assignment in a few months actually.”
Natasha, having spotted the two from a distance, walked up to see if they were all right. Only to see something she. was not to sure about. “Thor…um, what’s that you boys have up your noses.”
“Are you hungry? You haven’t been up yet and you need to drink that vitamin sludge Simmons sent for you.” Tony said kissing the bare shoulder closest to him.
"Nope..no taking this now." Bruce slid the plate away and called the serer over to ask for a glass of milk. "Just hang in there I promise this will help. Just drink your water ok?"
Title:DIY disaster
Nothing about what he was currently looking at had anything to do with traditional delicacy or dishes to promote a healthy offspring. This was fatty over-processed crap.
“Unca Loki...why you crying?”
Report her findings? “Loki there's nothing I could say that would result in you having to leave, I know you're not doing anything sinister here, you aren't a danger to anyone”...aside from yourself, she wasn't going to say that though. Taking a jab or two now wasn't wise. He was trembling even more now and Natasha knew he could see it but even the overly self-conscience omega wasn't even trying to hold it in. Adrenaline – her mind supplied. It was the fight or flight response and Loki was intent on fleeing it seemed. This prompted the alpha to push more comfort and ease from her end. If you had told Natasha a few years ago that, she would be trying to comfort Loki. She would have suggested a number of medications you might like to try to handle those delusions.
Tony looked around as the room filled up, he was fuming but wouldn’t out Steve in a room full of people. “Sit down Rogers.”
Oh norns this should be brilliant…: Loki
Simmons hesitated, “Well, yes. However, Steve, I can assure you that the percentages of healthy babies between both bonded and unbounded omega is very close. Given that you are in good physical health and the babies are progressing nicely I see no need for you to do anything you don’t want to do.”
The scene made him remember the nights when their roles where reversed, when it was Steve waking in the night soaking wet with sweat and head still echoing the sounds of screams and bombs. The way Tony would peel him out of his nightclothes and talk about anything and everything. Explaining something as intricate as advanced mechanics or as trivial as an article about some new fashion fad.   Words were Tony’s weapon and in those nights when Steve felt like he was right back in those muddy foxholes - it was those words that brought him back.
Thankfully, Hulk had been there to snatch the billionaire from the sky and slow his descent. Steve ran over to the prone form of his friend shouting orders “Get the face plate off him!”  His heart pounded as Steve silently prayed, ‘do not be dead…you stubborn bastard don’t you dare die.’
“Steve?” Pepper called out as she stepped off the elevator. She too had been watching the news feed from her office, the sight of her employer and friend tumbling  into the bay did nothing for her stress levels. However, knowing that Tony’s pregnant omega had seen the same - was much more worrisome.  “Steve?”
“y-yes.”
“Guten morgen! Loki!” The bright morning greeting proceeded a genial wave from a pointed tail.
That day had ended in triumph, if bittersweet for all their losses. There would be many more battles on both land and sea. Captain Rogers would hand pick his crew from those he trusted most. Natasha Romanov, deadliest woman on the seven seas. James Buchanan Barnes, sharpest shooter in the world and Steve’s best friend. Samuel Wilson, best navigator and sharpest sailor Steve had the pleasure of ever meeting. It was a small crew at its core, the military gave them others to join their ranks but this group was one he trusted with his life.
“No…don’t wanna.” Peter whined mumbling into Tony’s neck.
If Steve chose his old friend, Tony would step aside. It would hurt but he would, but he’d have to hear those words. Steve would have to tell him to leave. Until then, he was in this with all he had. Seeing Steve laying on the ground bleeding had done something to the inventor. Something about holding the omega when he feels apart, he needed Steve and part of him truly believed the other man needed him too. Maybe he had felt this for a while now, biology be damned. Even if Steve had been an Alpha like the stories said, Tony would still be standing here wanting him. Needing him…and falling in love with him. He would still be making his case even if it was a losing battle.
After a while, Tony picked Peter up and got him settled back into his bedroom, they ate pizza and watched Jungle Book.  For a few precious hours, Tony could forget. Until that night when he put Peter to bed with the promise of a trip to the zoo in the morning.
Steve sat there holding the little black and white print out, Simmons had stepped out to go get Tony. What was he going to say to him? How could he do this to Tony… things were so new between them and this. What if Tony was angry?
Whatever the case, the elevator doors opened and Stark was allowed passage up to the penthouse.
Fury had yet again underestimated.
Oh and there was a can of worms Steve thought he’d be able to dodge if they just kept talking about Loki. “He knows, I told him after… we haven’t talked about it a lot cause…well he’s a lot like Howard I guess in that respect. He just kind of shrugs and makes jokes then gets a drink.  I know he doesn’t blame you or hate you. I’m not sayin the two of ya are gonna watch the game together and shoot the bull- but he wouldn’t punch you in the face at this point.”
AN: I will be using elements from the Iron Man Extremis Novel , which is what Ironman 3 is loosely based on. I am cherry picking elements to fit this story line.   This chapter we will be learning a lot more about the avengers pack and the challenges for our couples.
“Of course! We shall speak at the feat of victory to follow!” Thor said giving his hammer a swing and obliterating an approaching tank.
“Do your worst Sargent.”
, that’s what he told himself.
Today especially, anytime they went into the city, more specifically Avengers Tower, Loki always felt like he needed an additional layer of 'armor'. Looking his best was Loki's way of showing he was still just as formidable, even if her wasn't the one standing in a court square demanding mortals to kneel.
“Indeed, I suppose it shall.” his voice seemed hollow even to his own ears.
“SHUT UP!” Tony shouted with a huge grin on his face. “Tell me there’s tape of this; did it happen in the tower? Oh sweet HD, please please. Jarvis! Tell me we have footage of this!”
They say when you fight the good fight, you should be proud when its over.
Following morning yoga was a shower and then down to the lab to sketch while Tony worked.  The engineer had since suspended any  projects that would cause hazardous or generally unpleasant fumes. It was sweet really, though the later was more due to how sensitive Steve’s nose to stomach reaction was becoming.  Poor Barton was cooking bacon on a hotplate out on the balcony at this point after a very unfortunate breakfast incident a few days ago. The scent wafting off the savory strips of pork sent the omegas stomach rolling harder than the Atlantic during storm season.
Tony waved as he jogged out to the elevator; he had woken up with a craving for his favorite pastries and the elixir of life known as espresso. If you are Tony Stark that means nothing less than a triple-shot just to feel human.
The alpha furrowed his brow and glared up at the digital clock on the wall. There was never time, there was always something else pressing. Loki wasn't some modest omega that when all dizzy at the thought of his/her alpha being away. It was probably nothing.
Loki couldn't help but laugh, “Oh that's terrifying.”It gladdened his heart to believe his friends cared that much for him.“ I should be heading out, though.”he reiterated before finishing off the last of his tea.“We are meeting a bit before to group the children by what they are most interested in.
Some demons though…could never be exercised.
Thankfully, this was not such a visitor. Tony realized that the moment he gained a proper look at the front vanity plate baring a large X.
When Tony entered the room, he noticed someone else was already taking vigil by the Captain’s bedside. Call it instinct but the engineer pulled his shoulders back and stood a little taller in front of the other alpha.
Time past and Steven grew, he was smaller than most and often ill. In the night she would watch him struggle through fevers, his narrow chest rattling with every breath, she thought her wishes had crippled him. Sarah tried her best to keep him well and always taught the boy to hold his head high. Yet, she knew he deserved more, Steven needed a father.
She waved him off and set about her task. Steve had his own task to attend to.
It was a usual weekday afternoon; Tony was busy working when he happened to look over his shoulder to make a comment to Steve when he noticed the omega was asleep.
“Oh god… is it my birthday.” Tony crowed watching Clint and Natasha exiting the quinjet.
He would give them this, sitting there on the front row of the church, holding his boy and staring straight ahead with no emotion on his face. His eyes guarded by dark glasses, guarded because he knew if they could see his eyes then his carefully crafted façade would be broken.
Her face softens a fraction, “I know. I'm taking the week, I'll be back to work next Tuesday. Oh and Tony...don't play with Steve like you did me. No one deserves that.”
Steve also had his own list to go through, taking his leisurely days checking them off one by one. He learned so much in those first few days that it was almost overwhelming.
“Tony…” Doctor Banner intervened, “The tower is advanced enough that I can have anything we might need brought up here it’s not that big of a deal. If Steve feels more comfortable here I think you should just let this one go.”
Everything that was missing from his life now.
So in honor of the holiday season i fired up my Christmas playlist and will be posting oneshots across all the fandoms I'm in! Enjoy
Steve cursed and pushed Tony up the embankment a head before hefting himself up, “Tony, get to the quinjet. We brought one of your old armors just incase, I don’t think the one you have on is going to be functional enough to fight.” Steve said looking over to where Coulson, Natasha and Clint where lined up picking off the quickly advancing troops. There wouldn’t be much time.
“Thanks.”Steve looked over to the sweet sadness shimmering in Loki's green eyes. “I wasn't always like this. I'm sure you know all about that.”
Peter had been sick for the past week, the pediatrician said he was just the flu - that didn’t make Steve feel any better. The omega was at his wits end fretting over the sobbing two year old.  Steve felt completely powerless, he had hoped Peter would inherit the serum but he didn’t.  Maybe if he had the little boy wouldn’t be hurting right now.
“I call it a lesson in not to trust someone just because their wearing a suit. It might save their lives one day.”
“Looks like I have no choice then. Should we get some air Captain?” The agent put out his hand for the other man to clasp. Rogers did so smiling, clapping one of his large palms on the suited man’s shoulder.
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose. “You're doing what?” This was happening..Of course it was.
Red Skull laughed, “It is so much more fun this way. Seeing your comrade kills you, or perhaps…you will kill him? I would love to see the famed Captain America with blood on his hands.”
Now Tony found that he was the one thinking to much and what point was it for them to watch a movie when no one was actually watching it.
Tony was mumbling along to the music moving a holograph of the suit around with his hands, he had been looking at some new specs to lighten the armor. “What would I do without your smart mouth….what’s going on in that beautiful mind…All of me loves all of you ….all your perfect imperfections...”
'Proficient students, capable teachers.' Nothing personal, these were all throwaway buzz words people used in advertising to make whatever they were selling sound more palatable to their audience. That's exactly what Loki was doing here, he was selling this story. The product was himself.
“The Triskelion HQ, nothing beyond that since SHIELD doesn‘t know about Fury.  Steve and Natasha have both been labeled as persons of interest. Tony; look I know Steve is your friend but why this sudden interest in checking up on him? I understand this situation is all shades of bad but this is Captain America were talking about here, I’ve never seen you put this much effort into anything that didn’t directly affect you.”
With the later, is where you find true horror.
The AI replied.
Why didn't he know that his alpha wanted to sleep in or do fun naked stuff. Mostly the sleep in part though is Tony was being honest with himself.
He shook the thoughts away before easing his way out of bed. His nose wrinkling at the sensation of being naked in the tie back gown. He really needed to stop ending up like this, or at the very least have, a spare set of clothes in the quinjet.
He kissed her cheek, “Yeah, but you will have a very special job just like Daddy, you will have to take good care of your mate. You’re my big brave girl aren’t you ?” he tickled her and made the little girl smile.
James felt his omega relax and Loki's breath even out. It wasn't much but it was an improvement. He tried to be careful of the IV Bruce had put in on the back of Loki's hand. Gently arranging his sleeping love beside him, trying his best to keep him comfortable. The days ahead were going to be hard, this was one of those things that had to get worse before it got better. He wanted to believe Loki was strong enough, that he was too but then...he looked down at how far his lover had declined right under his nose. Loki must have been wearing glamours 24hrs a day for him not to have noticed this.
Barnes squashed the thought before it could take hold. This wasn't about him; this was about his friend and...Pack mate? James hadn’t officially joined up with the Avengers but he imagined it was a similar bond on some levels. He honestly hoped Loki would one day change his mind about the rest of the team. It would help them all to have people they could rely on.  Natasha specifically was the kind that would go to hell and back for you. Teeth bared and eyes on fire before the devil himself. She was just like that.
Therefore, she would show up unannounced throwing him off from the beginning. He wouldn't turn her away of course because Loki wasn't raised that way. He'd want to prove himself the accepting host, might offer her tea in some fancy looking cups. So much like his armor and his helm, Loki needed visual distractions.
Tony has worried. Really and truly freaked out beyond words because wow… he had feelings. Of course Tony knew he had feelings he just didn’t think about them as much as he should, which is basically at all. Because if he sat with them too long things got deep and uncomfortable. Sure he’d been able to open up to Steve, and there in lay the answer to that question that he hadn’t even known how to ask his entire life.
It was going to be a long week, but hopefully now that he had one less thing on his mind- Tony could look forward to something better, something that was going to change his life forever. Even know, closing his eyes and leaning back just breathing in the moment Tony could see it. Ten tiny fingers, ten tiny toes, and countless potential. He hoped for another son, he loved Wendy to pieces but a foolish part of his heart wanted a little boy that was all Steve. A little golden haired boy with big blue eyes and all the joy and wonder for the world around him. All those Times Tony thought he wouldn't ever want this where like distant memories. Every fear he had about become like his old man had been washed away with first steps and first words. Those apprehensions had faded behind vibrant paint handprints on the fridge and height notches on the wall.
“Honey I'm Home!”
Bucky looked over to Steve with a little nod. “I see your done playing possum punk.”
So if Tony could not get mad. He could damn sure get even.
He stood quickly, a split second decision to walk back up the field rather than use magic. It wouldn't matter with Kurt, the man had the ability to move freely through the school much like Loki ( if one did not account for the stench of brimstone and sulfur).
Then again, Loki was a great actor. He could smile in your face and sell you ocean front property in Arizona while interesting a nun in contraception. He was that good. James knew it and maybe he could smell the bullshit from a mile off and just didn’t care. It was easier to put blinders on than analyze anything to close. Loki was fine.
“Captain Rogers, are you well?” Jarvis asked again. The poor AI had been trying to rouse Steve for some time now when the Captain’s vitals spiked signifying a nightmare.
“Coming.” Dry your eyes, just don't say anything. Remember how disappointed he was last time. You don't want to hurt him like that again. Loki slipped on his mask heading out, looking as perfectly groomed as ever. Hair glossy and neat, brushed out of his face, wearing a black buttoned up shirt and well-fitted slacks. James always-said Loki looked like he was one-step from the runway at all times.
He felt like a fool waiting on the mezzanine, while the servants prepared a room for his ‘soon to be mate’. They looked at him oddly when he had requested separate sleeping quarters. Whispers among the rubes ‘maybe the prince hasn’t the taste for fair things’, ‘perhaps he is Ergi’. Loki had never loved or even felt love for another before Amora, if Loki was perfectly honest he had never even had carnal urges for anyone. The idea of it seemed…complicated and messy. Another reason he was such a disappointment to his father he supposed.
No, place that far. (Stony)
His muscles ached and bones creaked from the winter chill and yet he couldn't bring himself to bother dawning a coat on the few times he left the house. The icy breeze painting his pale cheeks red and draining the color from his fingertips.
“There is, and he or she can’t wait to meet their big brother.” Steve said placing his own larger hands over his sons.
Tony could handle a happy Steve, a extremely focused Steve, and even an annoyed Steve. However, it was the little spurts of crying that sent the former playboy into a panic.
He shook off the thought considering that there could simply be a storm approaching. Now that he thought about it, things did feel as if they were shifting the way they did before a storm. Yet this was not the season for that.
Steve looked so submissive like this, Tony had no idea the effect on him would be so immediate. Part of him wanted to tell Bruce to leave them and lick a strike up the soldiers’ exposed neck. The inventor fought the thoughts away. Now was not the time, they needed to help Steve first and foremost.
Pushing a strand of hair out of Loki's face he kisses him again. He'd go to the ends of the earth and beyond for this man. James just wished Loki could see that, he knew why of course. When he was on the run he'd felt that bitter stab of pain around his heart and the voices in his head that said 'you're worthless, you're a monster, you should have died in war.' James knew what that was like to find yourself in a grave you dug in your own mind. How easy it was sometimes to just cover yourself up and call it a day. Loki didn't believe him anymore but Loki obviously stopped believing in himself.
“So…no?”
Bruce tousled his hair and folded his arms. “Yeah, It's well I just don't have a great deal of data in ether case. It's hard to recognize the whole picture when you feel like you're stabbing around in the dark.”
“Yeah I get that now, and if this is sleeping in I think I’ll stick with being an early riser.” Steve said, settling back into the bed.
That was before.
Barnes was really starting to understand why Loki hated going shopping.
Steve grinned “Poor Buck.”
"Fine. Better? Is this what you want? To see the once false prince looking like the wretch he truly is. Does the justice of it please you? Should I prostrate myself at your feet and take the lash? Or has that fallen out of favor these days?" Loki held his hands out in exasperation. He wished Stark would stop playing this game of false concern and just take his revenge or mock him. Just get it over with...anything but this.
The Gala had been exceptional as it was every year. Fine food, wine, decorations, celebrity guest lists. The avengers all enjoyed the evening  and smiled for the cameras.
“Coulson. My office.” Fury barked, it would seem the director was in rare form today, coat unfurling and everything. Not that this was not a commonplace occurrence at SHIELD HQ. Let it be unsaid that the director didn't possess style. The cantankerous man had it in spades with an attitude to match. Fury wasn't just a spy he was the spy, as once noted by Stark — Even his secrets had secrets.
Tony turned his back on the old headstone, his feet felt so heavy yet so light. Looking back at the car sitting on the street a few yards away. He didn’t even have to call out.
The idea itself was purely accidental; he received a package to his office that should have gone to Phil. Coulson and his damn memorabilia.
There was a time Tony would have scoffed at the idea of following rules, if anything he had been the type to tell you that rules are meant to be broken. Really the whole idea of rules where more-or-less, suggestions. Thankfully, Tony did manage to grow up over the years.  Finding at least a modicum of value in having some guidelines in life.
Steve sat up, the top of his head brushing against the top of the awning. “You know what I’m talking about. Don’t worry; I’ll have my things out by the end of the week if not sooner.”
Loki hesitated as if trying to formulate a swift yet believable reason to decline, but he was slow. “I...”
“Pepper…she put it in the closet, with everything else of yours. It’s locked up actually cause…” Tony didn’t want to say it, Pepper was afraid that Tony would have slashed his wrists with Steve’s straight razor. He saw it in her eyes the day she came in and stowed everything away in the safe with explicit directions to Jarvis not to let Tony in.
It was clear to Tony that he could not do this without Steve; he’d call Pepper in the morning. He had to do what was best for Peter.
Sarah Rogers
The soldiers cheeks warmed watching a much younger, much cockier version of the Alpha he knew. The way something’s hadn’t changed, the way Tony spoke and gestured, and that grin.
that bounced around in his brain like lead in a steel drum.
I groan covering my face. “Could you not say it like that.” uncouth bastard.
They had talked about it the night before, it had been a particularly difficult day in the tower. Loki had was in the game room when all the kids came running through. The look on the poor man's face was heartbreaking.
The omega’s grip went slack and Steve rolled onto stomach raising his hips slightly.
Tony could see the wheels turning behind those blue eyes and interrupted the negative thoughts with a kiss, offering another suggestion “Nope, you’re back can’t take that and I don’t want to risk you falling. Try getting on top.”
Inspired by Rodney Atkins - He's Mine
He supposed there had been a moment where he told himself- ‘end it now, your falling to deep.’ Yet like a foolish hungry child he said back to that small voice of reason ‘She will fall to, she will see that we are two of a kind.’
“Perhaps we are a bit hasty in our judgment...” Thor started but was cut off
He wasn’t going to act on it now. Friend’s don’t do that.
Nope.
“Tony…Tony wake up.”
The word hung heavy around the young sirens heart, “So much for an easy first week as royalty.” She shook her head and muttered.
Steve wanted to melt right there, just die because this man had ruined him. Following Tony into the bedroom, he was forced down on the bed to take part in his second favorite activity with the inventor. Kissing. Tony liked to say Steve was so innocent because he loved to just make-out like a teenager. The real reason was because there was something so beautifully intimate about the act. People could have sex with strangers, but a Kiss...men wrote songs about kisses.
Tony stood back and watched his mate pick up the test and look it over. Steve had a good poker face, for a moment Stark had kind words on the tip of his tongue. Maybe at least that bit of him was still human enough that they could try again and if not..then they could adopt. That was until he saw a soft smile beginning to form at the corner of the blondes mouth and twinkling blue eyes met his. “Is it...” he already knew the answer of course as that little Brooklyn smirk broke into a wide grin.
He could do it now; he could lock up the suit and let someone else fight the bad guys for once. He had monsters under beds to vanquish and the alphabet to tackle, and as crazy as it sounded that was important. More important than anything. Steve supported the idea, of course he wanted to be sure it was really what Tony wanted to do and not what the engineer thought that his husband wanted.
This was not the first time Tony had gathered this little marry band of mer for some obscenely dodgy game. There was always ‘the next thing’ with Tony, he loved to try everything and push just far enough till something broke - often times that something was him.
Peter spoke animatedly pointing at the different colorful shapes and explaining how each one was a different piece of equipment in the lab. The bots all whirling and beeping as they were each mentioned as a feature in the child's art.
Natasha set her cup down and watched the pronounced thrum of the vein in the omegas neck, his pulse is high... nervous but doing a good job concealing it otherwise. This didn't look good, he was being evasive which considering who she was dealing with it could mean a multitude of things.
She wasn't going to argue with that, giving the man a grateful smile she dashed out to catch a cab, shaking her head when she spotted Happy waiting at the curb. “ Hello Ms. Romanov. The Boss told me to come pick up you and Sergeant Barnes.”
Loki prancing around in a European looking bathing suit. All long lines and alabaster flesh, eyes guarded by a pair of large dark sunglasses as he waves his hands commanding jets of water and soap like an orchestra leader. The arches of water raining droplets over the gods lean form.
Widow could see his mind working trying to pull together all the details. “We had Friday pull CCTV camera footage. They pulled up in a van and tossed a couple of flash grenades. Looks like three people plus the driver, likely inhumans considering it only took two of the bigger guys to overpower Steve. Paired with the fact we only see our third boy for a second before he clocks you in the head with a crowbar. We‘re thinking super speed or maybe even teleportation at short range.”
There were no parades, no accolades, not that he wanted them now. Steve didn’t know what he wanted. The one thing he knew for sure was he couldn’t bear to follow the orders of dishonest men anymore.
Steve rolled his shoulders and sighed. “No really, I’m happy for you Buck…I mean at least one of us will get to go right.”
The photo changes to a young woman with her hair pulled back wearing a high collared blouse and pencil skirt.
“It’s to early for this..” He muttered leaving the room as the lights dimmed to a soft blue
“I’m sorry about …that.” He said gesturing to the boxes. “I just know I can’t really go out right now and I didn’t want you to have to go out and get them for me at all hours.”
They did not make it that far. Halfway out of the main hall, Tony listed ford and his uncle scooped him up. Loki magic already unlatching and removing the heavy armor to try to give the boy comfort. That’s when they saw it.
Back then, all he wanted was Steve. He had these great ideas of coming home from the war to the sweet little omega and settling down. Then Steve changed, not just in body but in other ways too.
FUNNIES cause i did ruin y'all last time.
“Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?”  Steve said staring down at the slightly shorter man.
Of course his ridiculous brother even liked the music of Midgard and Loki was never one to be upstaged so he purchased what the people of the realm call an Ipod.  Thus began the epic journey of his musical education and ..the rather sexy side effects of an Asgardian prince ‘getting his groove on’
Starks face washed with relief, confusion and a little irritation all at the same time. “Then what…”
(Johnny Cash version)
Loki was in his room, well technically he was in Bruce's room cause he had moved all his things in and was using the floor given to him as his " Work and meditation chamber", Having magicked a portal in the room and everyone was too scared to now enter that floor - lest they end up on Jupiter or something.
It felt like his soul was shredding in two, Tony had no idea if this was death but if it was he desperately wished it would just hurry the hell up. This felt worse than being swarmed by jellies of getting a fin snapped by an angry barracuda. If only it would just come to an end.
Fury turned and pointed at the screen. The former representations banished from sight leaving a brand-new more sinister set of visuals. “Hydra is now under the control of a woman calling herself Madam Hydra.”
Steve was trying to appeal to the rational part of his partners mind. Tony was a numbers person, he was analytical and surely, if he really thought about it he could see the wholes in the story.
He couldn’t. “I’m sorry… I have to make it right. They took everything, I have to end this.”
She thought it over, he wasn't going to give up that much was easy. "If I say yes. What did you have in mind."
Instead, Tony just shrugged his shoulder.
It felt good to hear the inventor’s voice pick up. There was hope there.
Considering all the work his arm would need (that only Tony could fix) It was just easier. Not to mention his obvious aversion to the SHIELD med-lab. James more than trusted Bruce whom he considered pack, rather than some nameless faceless SHIELD agents. No thanks, all those cold tables and lights were just a recipe for disaster with a mind like his.
Time felt like it passed differently at SHIELD. Of course, that wasn't the case at all (or at least not in a way, anyone could prove) still, perception was a funny thing.
His vision fogged as he felt arms gently wrapping around him, wrenching him through the water that suddenly felt hot and oppressive. “Darc...”
“So Capsicle, how are my magic fingers treating you?”
The next victim was Bucky; the former asset was in the gym when he noticed the towers other former villain resident enters.
Tony had been a little worried about the gift, but after really thinking about it he thought it would be a good way for Steve's little side to work through some of the hurt he held over his lost friend. "Do you like it sweetheart?"
“The common floor also has three guest bedrooms and baths, just in case ya know.” Tony explained as he showed Steve around. You can stay in one of those or pick a private floor. The one just below the penthouse is completed; Pepper was just getting together some catalogs for furnishing.”
“It's Phil, come on you know only Tony calls me that.” Coulson tried keeping his banter conversational and realized in an instance that this Loki isn't the one from those years ago. Intellectually he had known that, but something about seeing him so open and vulnerable drove that point home.
A slight smile curls on Loki's mouth. “intent to regal a new victim about young Steven Roger wanting so much more in life. James may have beaten you to the punch I'm afraid.”
“Tony…” His hand shot out instinctively to the side of the bed to try to wake his alpha only…the inventor was not there. “Jarvis… someone…”
“I know you do.” Tearing off a few squares of tissue Tony wiped the omegas face “it’s going to be ok though, how about we get out of here because this tile floor is hell on my knees. I’m no super soldier ya know.”
Bringing a ragged looking Barnes into the common room after Loki was safely sleeping, the pack gathered around the man. Pepper and Natasha flanking him on both sides. No one spoke for a while and maybe that was for the best. James just sat there with his head in hands as the women rubbed his back and Bruce made a cup of tea. Steve and Tony sat opposite and waited until Banner pushed a warm mug into the brunette solders hands.
After lunch was nap time, much to the complaining pups distaste. However, both of their parents knew that the little ones would just be cranky or crash early in the evening making sleeping through the night impossible. Once the twins were both gently away to dreamland the couple retreated to the living room.
I wake up in Tony’s bed, I know because I have woken up here enough times before. Ma would be so disappointed. She raised me better than this but Stark is so damn persuasive and attractive. He reminds me of Clark Gable and I always had a thing for him. Weak excuse I know.
“Because it would be like Chihuahua attempting to mount a pitbull?” Natasha said before sipping her water.
Riding up to his floor Bruce could hear Loki's voice piping through the elevator speakers. "Stop...stop singing...." Banner silently prayed but it wasn't stopping. If anything Loki was just getting more into it by the chorus. "This is a nightmare....he will kill everyone...I might let him. No I can't do that thats wrong, maybe just Tony. We need Tony, he pays for things...Pepper pays for things so maybe....No,no can't kill Tony. I'll tell Steve. Steve will guilt him to death."
Sirens meaning Plural…that was another part of the mission.
“Captain.”
Tony checked the suited stats, full power and all systems operating at 100%. Barnes wasn't anything to shake a stick at, they would be fine. “Yeah I'm in the upstairs control office now, looks like one of the freezers is currently running. I'm thinking we go ahead, kill the power, and thaw them out. I'll meet you on the main floor service entrance. That's the only way in and out of the basement.”
Maya Hansen was an old associate of Tony's. They had met a number of years ago during a technology summit in Switzerland.  It seemed that the lovely beta scientist was in hot water. Truthfully, Tony could just barely remember the woman, while yes she had been beautiful, Tony was still in his 'wine, women, and song' phase. He did vaguely remember she had been working on some innovative and exciting tech in the biotech discipline.
Unfortunately, despite their joint efforts team was starting to get pushed back by the overwhelming forces.  Steve realized they needed to get this together; he didn’t like not having eyes on all of his team so he called out over the coms for them to regroup.
….they were good, not just anyone could handle that shield…only a super soldier. “That you Barnes! Didn’t get enough Stark blood on your hands? I would have thought if anyone had respect for Steve it would have been you, or did your little magician boy toy give you the make over? I wonder how reindeer games will feel when I ship you back to god land in a box… See how he likes it.”
The omega found himself leaning against the wall with the water pelting his back. He hated this, hated feeling this alone, it wasn’t fair and it wasn’t right. However, he’d done this to himself hadn’t he?  He should have told Tony no, should have waited… should have done a million other things.
“That makes perfect sense considering the harsh conditions of their world.” Hank pointed out. “The pack presence, omega interaction, not to mention adequate sources of food and water. Why produce a new generation into a harsh world where they would be unable to thrive?”
“I'll be right out.” Loki's voice sang through the door.
One day in particular, Tony had come home to find several large boxes sitting in the penthouse, the side of which read “WISE SNACKS” in bold letters. The shipping information stated that each box held a 300 count of product.  The total order was about $600 plus expedient shipping.
I could scarcely believe my eyes, that the norns would form such a face from the dust of the grave and breath life with in it again. I thought my heart mad, surely this couldn't be.
An hour later, 'damn it Tony', Steve was showering while his alpha snored, at least now he'd be able to dress in peace.
Both men readied themselves as the lift doors screeched open. Two on one should have been no problem, should have been. However, what lay in that dark cramped alloy container was anything but human. Glowing gold eyes shone back at them for a brief moment before a blazing flair of fire shot out.
Warnings- Mentions of suicidal thoughts.
Tony could still remember every single school play, science fair, or sports day that Howard never came to. He was damn sure never going to repeat that mistake if he ever had kids, then over the years the goal became to not ever have kids.
“It will be nice, won't it? Seeing all the kids again” James said as they followed the caravan of Suv's into the countryside. Eyeing his silent partner quizzically.
“You used me!” Steve was furious stalking up to Fury who did not appear to care for the other man’s aggression.
Obie had insisted Tony calm down at least some; his freewheeling lifestyle image might have hurt the company, that’s where Joanna came into the picture. A beautiful omega from an influential family, and Tony’s fiancé. He didn’t even love her; he wasn’t sure what he felt…even if he was capable of it anymore. Stark thought he just didn’t work like other people. He was too smart to be jaded by the fairytales of love and happiness. The more he looked at her though the more he began to wonder if it wouldn’t be so bad. She was kind and she was always there, maybe…he could pretend. Maybe he could learn to love her.
Tony turned to see Peter standing at the door, the inventor glared at the ceiling a moment - Jarvis should have warned him.
Banner growls his cheeks flushing emerald. "Take me up or you won't like what I do."
Steve looked up in those big brown eyes that held nothing but warmth. Tony was there, holding him by the shoulders then touching his face. The room was sloped, dark and warm; the only light was calming blue from the rector.  “Right here with me now hon, come on.” Tony’s voice cut through the ice.

Meanwhile, the director of shield was none to happy to hear about what was going on at the avengers tower.  Fury had been patient with Stark for far too long and knowing that the billion dollar burr in his ass was now housing an ex criminal and ex assassin (regardless if Barnes worked for Shield now or not).
As some of you know I write for my anxiety and depression, well trying to make this perfect did nothing but make me a ball of anxiety. So it is a short chapter because I was so deeply unhappy I just wanted it to be over.
Sounds of exotic animal calls and African chants filled the tower. This probably wasn't the weirdest thing that Tony had asked of them but....whatever.
A shuddering breath leaves his lips and Steve reluctantly places the photo back on the side table. “I’m glad…that you're ok. You know that. But I can't feel you Tony. Our bond, you realized it didn't you? It's broken. I thought...I'm still not sure this is even real.” His voice breaks because damn it if this is just his mind-giving ghosts of comfort...if he really is that far gone what will happen to the kids?
The point was the heavy and uncomfortable erection in his jeans. “I’m burning in hell.. That’s what this is. It’s hell and  I am in it.” The billionaire tore out of his clothes as fast as possible before flopping back on his still unmade bed. “God I’m fantasizing about a guy my old man could have fucked…that’s.. That’s hell.”
“Gimme 10 minutes.” The alpha nipped at his ear grinding his morning erection into the soldier’s stomach.
Stevie pouted when he saw it. "Dada im'a big boy.."
“No…no its not..none of this is ok.. ..Tony…. Tony I’m so sorry..”
If you just smile”  Tony sang softly leaning his cheek against the top of  Steve’s hair.  He thought of his mother, how she used to put on that old Nat King Cole record and sing to him. It was bittersweet, though he’d like to think she would be proud of him now.
“Of course Sir.”
Inspired by: Mariah Carey - All i want for Christmas is you.
Reality was dangerous, reality hurt you. The truth splayed you open for all to see, for any to exploit if they so wished.
Well he hoped to give her a hell of a show.
“Nada… nope null, non. Do not care J, my building. Now make it so number 1!”
“I know baby. That's not your fault. But you can get through this, just think about how far you've come and all that you lived through to get here.”
“Tony… Tony please.” Steve twisted on the floor tugging hard at the glowing restrains around his wrists. “Don’t…please don’t…”
Barnes wished he had something better to say, Mallen was now standing and things are looking even worse as the once human flexed his hands and grotesque claws grew from his charged looking hands. “How long do you need.” He asked chancing a glance out a shattered window. Outside it looked like Coulson and his team are taking a beating as more hydra goons arrived. They were knee deep in this and the only was out was to just trudge straight through.
There was a pause and Jim thought perhaps the suit had finally given up the ghost, but then Jarvis’s voice returned.
The only people Steve had welcomed had been the other pack omegas. Pepper had taken on a strangely maternal role; however, the more Tony thought about it he supposed it wasn’t that strange. How many years had Virginia Potts been ordering him around and keeping him out of trouble?  Yeah, so maybe Pepper was a “mom” type.  Ever since Steve had opened up to the team, the other omega had quietly flanked him. Offering kind words and solidarity.
Steve smiled and kissed his son’s forehead, “Yeah you are buddy, I bet you're real excited huh?”
The apple clearly did not fall to far from the tree. Bitterness was all he had to keep him warm, that and the anarchist cookbook.
Bruce gave them his best and wished he had better answers. The team had poured countless hours and research and this was the best they had to offer. Of course the couple understood and were thankful for the help.
Natasha had to admit, the mer were in trouble and she could see from her vantage point that there where children among them. The fact that they were not human, at least not entirely, meant nothing in the grand scheme of things. “I’m with Steve, I can’t watch anyone die. We get down there and with our weapons, we might be able to turn the tide. If we do then their leader may be more cooperative with us in finding the one who killed Stark's kid.”
“This is all very interesting honestly, the thickness of your skin for example is different to ours and even Thor's. I suspect that may have to do with your peoples indigenous habitat. Cold climate adaptations on so on.  As far as any physical issues that might be causing problems.. I can't say I see anything alarming other than your current weight. That is obviously stress related.” Bruce slipped off his glasses and sat down in front of the couple.  “I wish I had better answers for you guys I really do, unfortunately I don't have anything to compare this data to.  However, I can say that a lot of your internal structures are very similar to a humans and because of that I have to consider things like the Stress  I mentioned earlier.  Anxiety  and Depression are not something to be taken lightly, our minds and emotions can have a huge impact on how the body works .”
Steve let his head falling back and spine arch when those smug lips found a home around his erection.
Steve’s brow furrowed and honestly hoped this wasn’t what he thought it was that she wouldn’t ask to ‘see’ anything. He was sure Bruce had told her what he was but he really wasn’t ready to have to give visual confirmation to this woman. “Depends what it is.”
Tony would laugh and point out that he was 19 and there was not a damn thing the old man could do anymore. He was not afraid of Howard anymore, he was not the scared kid who hid in closets when the man he called father would be so blind drunk waving a belt around. Not the child who coward and hid his face in his knees when the sound of screaming grew to loud, when slamming doors knocked the pictures from the walls. Tony would never be afraid of that again.
Tony was now up and flitting around the room snatching up a plastic hospital bag with what was left of Steve’s uniform. He assumed Agent had the shield - probably guarding it like a mother hen, or praying to it. Who knows with Phil, he might have licked it clean. “Right well how about we start by me busting you out of this joint?”
“Um..Flowers? What do you think J can I send Steve Flowers or is that weird?”
“Stay. Just stay. Tell me I am unbroken, that I am not the monster I know I am beneath this skin. Lie to me Thor...lie to me.”
Over the last few months, she had spent a lot of time with Loki. In that time she had learned he wasn't at all what she was expecting. He liked to read and learn about life here, history and art. He was thoughtful and even kind. Most of all she quickly realized how unsure Loki was of himself and his abilities. The omega was constantly challenging himself. It was almost painful to see Loki wrestling with arbitrary choices that most people take for granted. His depression and anxiety had dug their claws in and ruled every facet of his day. When to get up; what to eat; what to say; everything wasn't just a yes or no it was an essay question in his head.
“I know...” Natasha responded dejectedly.
Amora still had not returned.
“Ah yes…well.” She stalled looking back at the chart and flipping a few pages. “It’s just…I noticed something so… Doctor Banner told us about your nature and the recent treatments he has administered. However, he did not divulge any personal information and so just to be clear at what I’m looking at here I have to ask.”
“Let’s go,” Natasha said ushering everyone out.
Steve cringed a little; he knew this was difficult considering Thor was in Asgard and Sam was out with an injury. Therefore, as far as air support all they had was Tony. Coulson had some of his agents assisting in watercrafts while they tried to corral the creature into a docking area and perhaps force it on land.  Much to the agents chagrin, the creature seemed to know the team’s intention and was striking out with its many tentacles.
*Featuring Agent of Asgard Loki /Daddy fetish
The screen flicked through various shaded of grey and the wand moved, “Right, now here is your uterus…and here…oh…”
What a body it was too. All lean muscle and fair skin, the kid had a cocky grin and he knew exactly what he was doing when he sauntered into Tony's office. Ever since Tony had become Director of Shield and by extension was now overseer to these kids who were suppose to be the next generation of Avengers, he'd been dealing with Loki's shit.
“We need a few things, I would have gone for them but you could go to the shops if you like.” Loki said abruptly, tugging the sheets tight around his body.
Recalling his alphas words made a warm feeling curling in the pit of his stomach.
“No… no please, anything but that… he…he will be furious. Please I beg of you for the safety of my child, as well my own life. Call Prince Thor.”
Steve moved as silently as he could through the foyer and sat down bench, leaning his head on his alphas shoulder.
The ginger rolled her eyes, “Yes Tony you get coffee now.” she said reaching out and ruffling the alphas hair before setting off for aforementioned coffee.
Frigga looked to the old woman, as the image passed between them, a horrible vision of a life not yet lived filled with mistakes and pains, a life ended…
“Sorry?”
"He can't... it's not..." He mumbled looking at her with such confusion, begging and pleading in those deep brown eyes that this had to a bad dream.
He gathered the omega in his arms and jostled him lightly. “Please Steve..” He said, retracting the gauntlet to pat the side of the Captain’s face. Trying as hard as he could to ignore the tremble in his own voice.
He followed the sound of his father's voice to the kitchen. Steve was standing in front of the stove with a dish rag over one shoulder. The smell of burgers cooking and homefries in the oven. "Your dad will be home in an hour or three. ... Knowing him. Anyway, why don't you go get washed up for supper?"
His calluses were gone, that scar on the back of his right knuckle from where he first built Dum-E back at MIT was gone. He was so proud of his goofy little bot, even if Dum-e could try his patience most of the time. Tony remembers how the school paper took his picture and he cut it out to send home.
The omega scrubbed his palms over his face muffling the words that had played again and again in the back of his mind ever since he came out of the ice. “What if the past is all I have?”
That place had been his punishment and salvation.
That quick lunch never happened though; just as Steve was stepping out of the shower, when the call to assemble went off. He tossed his towel over the rack and was heading to the wardrobe to suit up, any discomfort forgotten in the flood of adrenaline.
There are a lot wonders and joys of pregnancy. There are also all the things that don't fit into a vogue photo shoot. Like the morning sickness, swollen ankles, mood swings, rosachea, and last but not least – really weird cravings.
Steve had to admit it did feel better. “You can’t do that all night.” He mumbled trying to relax back into a pile of pillows under his back.
Even so with all the positives, Loki felt the annoyance of his preheat since the early morning. Given, he was in a better state than he had been weeks ago, and while he was still not well from months of neglected self-care. Loki was on his way back, learning day-by-day that is wasn't selfish to take care of himself, that he rightfully deserved it.
The omega’s brows knitted, “What do you mean, anything that was wrong with me before would have been corrected by the serum.”
Just like that Tony found that he had something so different yet so wonderful. And for once he didn't even go looking for it, if he wanted to get poetic about it he would say that it was fate. Or as he joking commented in his wedding vows. "I had a husband on ice for 70 years waiting just for me."
“Hmmm idunwanna sign anymore Pep…mmmthen gimme th’ pink glitter pen fuck ‘em …”
Natasha stood up to refresh her drink, speaking as she poured herself a vodka tonic “Punish is one thing, if Stark wanted to he could have stopped at the Hydra he leveled back in October. We all would have helped him. He doesn’t want help or even to stop Hydra and Aim. He just wants a body count to even up the scales.”
“Some things you can't just fix, life isn't that easy. You and Tony really need a lesson in that.”
Running from the mirror and into the shower his hands shake trying to twists the knobs as hot as possible. He'd rather burn than stand there crying or worse...fall to his knees in a pathetic heap and vomit. “Stop stop stop...”Begging this oppressive feeling to pass, for the vice suddenly tightening around his chest to release.
"Sorry to disappoint. Why don't you go play house with someone your own age lokes." Tony said, watching the annoyed young man start to pace in front of him. He knew the kid had a short fuse as most do at that age but this was a little more desperate than usual. Something was going on with this little stunt and Tony was sure he didn't have enough time or energy to deal with an angsty melt down right now.
The billionaire darted to the elevator and waited impatiently for the box to take up to Steve’s floor. It bothered him even more that Steve had been so blindly terrified he didn’t even notice that the glass partition didn’t even go all the way around the bed.
And here i am..just the third man
“Oh gee Tony I’m great, just having my uterus squeezed like a lemon. So ya know, amazing, I could do a USO show.”
"Anything your heart desires. I wish only a moment of your time, to see you smile and listen to your wit. What do you say?"
“I promise Tony.”
Steve shook his head as he too lured a large group by running to the east. As expected, the move pulled the attention of a good third of the auto-mounted soldiers. Rogers then spun on his heels with the shield at the ready to engage them, smashing into the snowmobiles as they crested the snowy dunes.  The Shield flew through the air knocking several other minions off their feet. What ever he couldn’t hit or slam into got some old fashion hard work when the soldier dug his feet in and slammed his palms down on the hood of an approaching winter vehicle. The rider trembled trying to unholster his weapon.
As a result, The Captain was currently holding his bleeding side with his back pressed in a corner. He looked over to his shattered com, Barnes had destroyed his only link to his team.
Steve glare, “I’m serious Tony, we aren’t getting any younger and I want the twins to experience having younger siblings.”  Steve would never say it, but he also noticed more gray in Tony’s hair and part of him worried. He knew there was a chance that his aging would never quite catch up to normal and that he would lose his Alpha. He would spend years alone missing this man, but he would have Peter and Wendy. Maybe he just wanted more children because it in a way…those children would keep their fathers memory alive.
Tony couldn't figure it out, why in the hell had  James stayed around him this long. Why anyone stayed around a self absorbed mess like him. With his problems, his addictions, his a difficult personality.
“Would you please tell me what you’re seeing?” Steve tried to speak calmly get the edge in his voice was unmistakable. Why were they talking over him, why would no one tell him the truth?
It felt like it took to long for Barnes, it felt like an eternity watching Loki writhe and grit his teeth against the pain.
It was this moment they would never forget, not the pain or the anguish. This would remain vivid as the moment there eyes watched the lights over the lift glow and the grind of mechanics raising the steel box from the deeps. Because this was the last time things would be the same, the last time one of them would ever feel human.
“So we use the units here as a baseline for other drugs, that’s what your suggesting?”
Loki grew bitter and in that bitterness he takes it out on the little pup, leaving the child in the care of the palace servants.
It was getting too damn hot and the weight of what’s left of his armor felt like molten metal on his too tender flesh. His vision whites for a moment before returning with the throb of his own pulse racing through his temples. It's so strange hearing the roar of his own damaged heart. He wonders briefly if it will even stand up to this kind of torture or the poor little gin soaked thing will just give up before Extremis can do a damn thing.
Tony could feel the headache starting. “Killian...why is that familiar? “
“Right, yeah sorry about that. Ya know we could just start using that service that Stark does. I mean if they can stock the tower and the compound…”
Yet not all was gilded gold and shining with gems.
"Such intelligence, you obviously like your fathers. I'm sure you will be very good at murder Frisbee and ...whatever Stark does. "Now, I am Loki."
Jane intercepts him with an affectionate embrace and a kiss. He takes a moment just to breathe her in, there is nothing in the whole of the nine realms as peaceful as this. Being away for months as the All-father sleeps had been an arduous test. Yet here she was, as steadfast as always. Thor pulled away from the warm welcome to look wistfully at her, so warm and beautiful. Once again thanking the Norns for favoring him with such a woman.
“Daddy…”
“No buddy no, oh baby no.” He pulled the little one into his arms and thought for a moment Peter had gotten bigger. Kids grow so fast and he had missed it.  “Shhh. Its ok, I’m right here I promise. I’m so sorry buddy, Daddy was just working that all. I’ve been working really hard that’s all.”
He expected perhaps a chaste press of lips, or even Loki to turn away and play coy. What he wasn't prepared for is for those long elegant hands to grasp his face and pull him into a bruising demanding kiss.  Stealing every ounce of air in his lungs and forcing the solider to wrap his arms around that tall lean form in front of him and slid metal fingers through raven locks.
“Steve!… Shit…” Tony threw his arms out to catch the larger man as he pitched forward. Stark was thankful he hadn’t decided to take the armor off when he first found Steve or he wouldn’t have been able to hold the omega up under his own power. “Steve come on, Steve open your eyes baby. Come on Steve.” Tony’s voice came out in hurried shouts as he tried to maneuver the soldiers dead weight around as they both went down.
James dropped a kiss to his omegas hair. “We're gonna be okay.”
Phil tugged over a chair and sat down, taking a moment to straight up his tie and cross his legs, “It did happen though and you’re both adults. Listen, I know I’ve never been in this situation but I do have children. Clint’s became mine the moment I bonded with him, and I’ll admit I was scared to death. I had no idea how to be a parent, to be honest I was surprised Clint was so good at it. It’s a hard job but it’s also one of the most rewarding.”
Watching his infant son struggle to thrive, spurred Howard to dig through everything he had built or imagined over the years. There had to be something in the piles of scrap, something in the rattling corridors of his supposed genius mind that could save his child. The was no way he could do the things he did , be the man he was if in all his works there wasn't something he could do.
“Is it? Or is that the lie you tell yourself to make this seem righteous. You know I used to think Steve was bad about that sort of thinking. Truth is…you just cant stand losing, you couldn’t stand that your record as director of shield was a joke. So you wanted to make that one final push, and you sacrificed who ever was convenient.”
The noble Captain made his way through the blood murky waters as his team and the mer folk battled fiercely the thrashing behemoth. It was challenging to navigate beneath the waves where light refracted through the liquid heavens and played tricks on the eyes. Even so Steven did his best to determine the specific location based on Natasha's precise directions. Before long he was with in eye line of the Stark-mer look-a-like. If Howard Stark's son was still alive perhaps, the old inventor would let go of his genocidal plans.
“Don’t use Star Wars puns against me J.” Tony sassed right back. “Seriously though babe…snacks on the throne? I’ll admit there were some times in college when I had the drunken shits and ended up having ramen in the bathroom but that was out of multitasking necessity.”
This is were i will store all the dirty dirty shame. feel free to request pairings
They faced each other on the mat, having lain down some ground rules. “Do you mind if I play some music while we…engauge?”
The ravenette eyes him with a wicked little grin, this couldn’t be good. “Sergeant… I seem to be without a sparing partner, would you mind. One does need to keep the skills sharp you know.”
“Well come on in, Peter wanted Loki to read to him so they should still be up to that. We've got em all packed up so whenever you're ready, I think there's still some breakfast left over if you wanna fix yourself a plate.”
Today however, there was no terror inducing pasta sauce to smear all over the nice white lounge.
Barnes fell back as the Iron man armor took the brunt of the inferno. A while of the repulsor charging fills the air as Stark returns fire. A mass of glowing flesh in the shape of a man came forward with speed and grace. Mallen had avoided the beams of searing power and punched Stark straight in the chest plate, sending the suit careening back ward with a hard clang into the concrete floor.
“What do you want us to do Cap?" Sam's voice echoed across the line backed by the shrieks of the beast.
Looking back on it, Steve could see why letting Tony help was a bad idea.
“Tony…”
“Really creepy?” Sam finished pointing to the ornate fixtures and strange devices held in glass display cases. “It’s like a war museum, everything that’s been developed in the last 20 years”
Before someone else had to feel the bitter sickness of waking up alone in bed meant for two.
He ruffled a bit at the statement. "Yes well neither was I,  as for the risk well...I had believed the reward greater than a flesh wound."
This new suit looked more like the old Mark versions. There was some talk about incorporating some research Tony had from a Dr. Maya - it was called Extremis, Steve didn‘t know a lot about it, but he trusted Tony. The inventor said that the tech was still a few years ahead before he did anything with it, if ever. He did not elaborate.
Coulson shrugged his shoulders. “Well Captain I think you know by now that what Nick says isn’t always the truth. Of course, it took a while for them to... repair things as you might imagine. So at the time I suppose it was for the most part accurate.”
America had lost its first Avenger.
If providing food for an omega made Tony puff up a little – he tried not to show it. He didn’t want Steve to think he saw him differently or make the other man feel uncomfortable. Contrary to popular belief, Tony Stark does in fact have a heart.
‘You love me right darling?’ she would say, stroking her hold fingers through his hair. Those smoldering blue eyes staring deeply into his, she was such a skilled Liar. Surely, she had put the silver tongue prince to shame with her greatest ruse.
“Indeed I do not care what you think, however you mortals are meddlesome creatures with the penchant to tattle-tale like mere pups at the first sign of disturbance! I find concealment to be a far better option that giving you or any of your ilk more ammunition of which to use against me!” He seethed wanting nothing more than to fling the woman out of the cabin all together. Loki knew he was taking this to far but he was so damn tired and all he wanted was to be left alone. Then Romanov appeared and who knew what she would tell James if she had the chance.
Tony was still sitting on the side of the bed right where Steve left him, just staring at his hands.
There wasn't any sign that Loki brought any food or water into the nest and from the smell, he hadn't left to use the bathroom either. “Loki can you here me?“ Nothing, James felt his skin crawl with images of pale cold skin and glassy dead eyes. All that pain Loki had been carrying around came crashing back. What if he’s done something…what if…No. No he wasn’t going to think like that.
She would arrive just before sunset and perch on craggy stone that jetted out of the inlet, its shining black surface reflecting the fiery sky above her. The siren would stretch out on and fan her tail soaking up the warmth from the stone. All the while, her fingertips danced over the glittering gem nestled in the hollow of her throat.
There had been some among them who took delight in punishing the land walkers, sinking ships with their songs. Beckoning sailors to their deaths. Others still, who chose to learn from human kind by trading their magic with the more desperate mortals.
Loki felt the blood boil in his chest, or no. it was boiling it was freezing.
Naturally she hadn't, Melinda wasn't the most fond of children of any age and even less a fan of teenagers. “ He's going to be here.”
“Ya know I like it when you get all serious and demanding, it’s hot.”
This was the conversation that Steve was silently dreading. Not that he was going to show it right now, but it was true. All night he had lain next to Tony -pretending to sleep when he had really been thinking about this conversation. Preparing as he would prepare for battle, he had to be able to sit here, listen, and show no fear.
Natasha hummed and took a seat across from him. Crossing her long legs and enjoying the way his eyes fought not to follow the action. Clearly men from every planet where still just men. "What makes you think I'll agree to go anywhere with you? "
Steve lifted his palm to look at the little makeshift bandage. “I hope you’re feeling better. I brought you all some dinner by the way. It’s not much but I think between the four of us we will be ok.”
Not like this, choking on his last breath while chaos reigned down around him.
Tony would never get to hear that voice again.
"It's ok doll, it's just me." He smiled softly and slipped the spoon past Tony's lips before setting the bowl down and retrieving a dishrag that hung over one shoulder, wiping at the inventors eyes. "There, see? Ain't no shame in it, I used to feed the punk like this when he was to sick to do much else sides' roll over to puke in a bucket. Least you haven't done that so your battin a' thousand. "
Bruce smiled at him with that soft sweet look, yes he'd done well to trust this man. Banner turned out not to be such a dull creature after all.
Loki rolled his eyes, “I assure you Jor has a finer pallet than that. You may take the child to the healers if he is unsoothable.”
“Yep, m’fine, tired.”
The eldest prince made his way through the halls until he was just outside his brother’s chambers. He knew by now the guards had alerted their father, their mother would know and soon so would the kingdom. It would be better for Loki to learn of his child from family rather than the gossip of the court.
“Yeah, can you come lay down with me? It would really help.”
Tony looked at her tearful reflection in the steel cabinets. “Thank you Pep,” Tony smiles sadly and for old times sake tipped his head forward, “That will be all Ms. Potts.”
“The way I see it Mr. Stark want’s to go after the people responsible for his husbands death. Maybe you don’t realize this Colonel Rhodes, but we want the same thing. An end to tyranny.”
11 hours and the contractions were closer together and Simmons kept saying “almost”.
Steve didn’t say anything, he wasn’t up for an Omega pow-wow at the moment but he didn’t want to be rude. Finally Pepper spoke again, “So, why are you up here and not beating some sense into your Alpha?”
“Yeah yeah..Hey.. You alright there Cap?” Clint says.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Bruce hedged looking at the video call screen, maintaining an artfully passive expression.
Things had been looking up, Steve and Tony’s relationship seemed to be flourishing since Steve moved most of his things up to the penthouse.  A lot of the team thought Tony might not do well with someone in his personal space constantly; however, with SI, the Avengers, and Shield - they both had enough time apart that the more combative aspects of their personalities did not clash. They complimented each other in such a way that the team often joked, calling the pair an ‘old married couple’. For all the bickering they could do (and there had been some dozies) they were fiercely protective of one another.
The inventor leaned into his alphas advances, feeling the cold metal fingers sliding under the band of the back of his jeans. Tony arched let out a little gasp, he loved Buckys arm, there was something so taboo about the synthetic appendage. The sound of the gears moving as the solider manhandled him sent a chill down his spine.
Now Stark ...hell, he wasn't mentally ready to touch that with a 10 foot pole.
Returning home to the tower, Loki felt an unusual sense of profound peace settle over him. It was almost frightening to feel like there was anything worth smiling about after spending so much time dwelling on anxiety. Perhaps giving up on this dream of a paternal child wasn't the end of the world. After all, If his dear friend Kurt could be so happy then why couldn't Loki? If Frigga could love him and cherish him as her own then why couldn't he?
“We all know how this story ends.” Loki said, he had been given back his life to live again but still… he was the same inside. Still the monster beneath lying skin. Still the extra son, what good could he be?
“I smelled pie when I got off the elevator, I'll assume Steve's been here.” She said leaning in the doorway.
“You have so much more to give than you know.”
( any of the above never ended well for anyone. In darker days before, Howard finally put the bottle away- thanks to an ultimatum from his wife that she would walk away forever otherwise, breaking such rules would end in house call from the Stark family's personal concierge physician. One particularly nasty evening on Tony's first visit home from boarding school had ended with a broken wrist. Howard hadn't been able to look at him for week after that and increased his allowance, as if that was a substantial enough apology.)
Her mother had been so happy to see her only child marry so well. It did the old woman good to watch young Sarah draped in white and adored with spring flowers. Finally, able to leave this world knowing her child was cared for.
“While I think in some respects he has improved in others… well. Look at it this way..” Bruce gestured  as he spoke, “If Loki had a disease - say, a fever or an infection, we would treat it after discovering the problem right?”
Loki turned to eye the slight blond as he ran between the two alphas chasing a ball they were tossing over his head. “Is he ill often?”
Loki has no wish to stand here any longer, he has seen to it that the alphas are alive and at least he can deliver that news. Part of him breaks when James reaches out to him. Loki steps back from the pleading hand, he doesn't deserve it not now. He can't let him any closer, never again... “I'm fine...I can not say the same for you ...” He says quietly and Barnes looks like he wants to brush off the fact that he looks like 100 miles of bad road.
Steve looked back at Tony lying so still in that hospital bed. "I can't leave him... He means too much to me."
Clint couldn’t help but try to lift the mood. “That’s what she said.”
“Don’t fucking touch me? You got that and by the way, nice kiss Judas. Coming here to tell me how to run my life. Et tu Bruce?” Tony called into the living room. Banner not meeting his eyes. “Yeah thought so, ya know it’s funny all of you seem to know what’s best for me, and how to help me. Where the hell were you when Steve was out there dying? Barton, you and your sister assassin pal just stood around with your thumbs in your ass while Hydra killed my husband. So you will all kindly understand if I say fuck you and fuck your opinions.”
That’s when it made sense to the physician why the omega was holding back, super strength…Steve was terrified he would injure the twins. “You won’t I promise you, they are part of you and we already know they have been protected this far correct? So give me a big push ok? Count of three and bear down for me dear, here we go. One, two, three.”
The alpha sat up and took in the seriousness of the conversation. “You know I’m with you on this, I would have if you said so the day after they were born. I know how hard it is to stand up in front of the world and tell your secrets. That said, you don’t have to be pregnant to do it.”
There was always some meddlesome mortal that had to make him known. Worse, Thor. His blundering brother simply tried too hard to 'help'.
Steve looked wide eyed at the screen, two small bean shaped silhouetted wiggled in a sea of black. Twins… them where having twins. Before Steve could comment or have any feeling on the matter he felt the grip on his hand loosen and looked over to his alpha that now looked pale as a sheet mumbling the word. “Twins” repeatedly.
Bruce made it there before him, thankfully, the beta had the good sense to wait, Bruce knew Tony and Steve had something going on and walking in on an omega on the edge of heat with out their alpha present was just asking for a bloody nose. In Banners case, it was more likely to result in bringing out the other guy.
Happy birthday to me! and here's our first chapter. Art at the end.
Perhaps he was so in trawled with the ancient inter workings of the old machine and the melodic tones reverberating around him that he didn’t notice the subtle footsteps crunching along the gravel path between the barn and the farm house.
Peggy wished it was that easy, wished there was some magic left in the world. The same magic that Howard claimed took his son, so that she could find that scaled witch and rip the very heart out of her. She wished there were angels and fairies, wished there were a million things she could not see and stopped believing in as a child and that even one of them could turn back time.
However, right now this wasn't just Loki standing before her crumbling. This was the omega of her pack brother, that's who James was to her – weather he like it or not. By extension, Loki was hers too, and she never left pack behind.
Howard didn’t say anything as he was nearly melted against his work desk. Peggy moved around picking up drawings and looking over the schematics. “Bombs…really Howard?” Had he really fallen this far? The one thing Maria had never wanted him to do ever again. Yet here he was, playing right into Stane's money grabbing hands. “ I thought you said military inventions to preserve life or defend a solider were one thing but mass destruction was another.”
This would have silenced the room if it hadn’t been for Tony choking on a meatball when Steve used the word ‘mounting’ in a sentence cause now that mental image wouldn’t go away.  Pepper managed to clap her hand on her boss’s back a few times and get the edible going down the right pipe.
Coulson took a small device from his pocket; it looked like a cross between a tazer and a pocket watch. “Nifty little toys we have now, wouldn’t you say Steve?” The object touched the sleeping guard’s neck jolting the man out of his chair and into a twitching heap on the floor. “I really like calling you Steve.”
You were always on my mind -willie nelson
Steve sighed in relief, “Thanks J, can you tell me how Tony’s doing?”
“Will the two of you get a room!” Clint groans at the kitchen entry. Thank you Hawkeye. Thank you so much.
Their leaders mind was already made up, come hell or high water they were already in too deep. Even now hydra was assembling around the perimeter to insure that they would not be interrupted. Mallen looked over Beck's shoulder and spotted the silhouette of a woman standing at the far end of the warehouse. Her features obscured in darkness, so she was here to see if Killian's little toy really worked then.
The young man was so pale and his breathing labored. The young Mers gill slits trembles and flushed a brilliant red. “Dad…. there…there’s a woman…she…” Tony whimpered his eyes blinking open those glazed with pain.
He moved over their heads to get behind the approaching troops firing toward the Hydra agent’s backs. This tactic proved essential in parting the troops as some turned around to chase him.
“ok then…”
“I know…” The alpha said peeling off his own shirt, the light of the reactor glowing and filling the nesting room with a soft bluish white hue. “I know.” He said again touching Steve’s face. “I’ll be honest babe, I’m scared shitless. I don’t know what kinda parent I could be and I don’t want anything to happen to you.”
Peters parents were not thrilled when their little omega first brought home Wade Wilson. It was about as bad as when they found out the boy was secretly Spiderman. Wade (in his general lack of mind to mouth filter) thought they would like him better by mentioning he was the deadly mercenary known as Deadpool.
Days turned to Weeks and weeks to a month then two, somewhere in all this things changed. Bucky went from the guest room, to the sofa in the master bedroom, to the bed.
The two chatted over coms as it this wasn’t a possible life or death conversation.
Tony pulled his hand away;
Not after this. The ice didn't kill him but this? This was going to destroy him because Steve has put too much into this; he believed in this life and gave every piece of himself to it. Every thing in him Loved Tony. He would have never believed in loving someone that much, never in a million years and thousand lifetimes. Then it happened, it crept up and crawled into every corner until all was left belonged to brown eyes and rough hands.
There were rows of armors out on the launch deck and all the avengers present for what Tony assured was going to be a very important day. They all thought the important day would have been when He and Steve had finalized the adoption papers to bring their new son home..which was yesterday. But no here they were at dawn, outside with...was that the theme music from lion king playing? Yes. yes it was.
Being pregnant was one thing, Loki could handle that...he was god! Blessed with glorious purpose after all. However, being being pregnant and left to babysit a toddler?
He was turned by the shoulders, Natasha again. “Tony, I need you to listen careful and stay calm.”
“Not as yet sir, Doctor Banner is on site and has determined the creature seems to be a culmination of several other creatures and enhanced with an unknown element. Should the beast make landfall - I assume the hulk may be added to limit property damage.” Jarvis replied.
“I work with what I’m best at.” Tony shrugged and grinned when he saw the slow smile Steve was fighting down. “Exactly, now come on Bruce bun and the English muffin are waiting.”
Following their bonding, Steve’s nightmares came to an end. For the first time in weeks the soldier slept through the night peacefully.
"Take away that suit of armor....what are you?"
Sam dawned a pack with thick metal arm bracers. “Old man Stark dose know that I can’t fly under water right? “He said, activating the bracelets as a halo of red glowing light mimicking wings appeared.
"Daddy said..I'm a good boy?"
Thor had a promise to keep, a promise he had broken before. “I won’t let it and you won’t either. I will never give up on you Loki. You must have faith in yourself.”
“So, is it just me or is this place…”
Tony shook his head. “I’m surprised you know that reference.”
“I'm serious James; you are one of the few things on this unfortunate ball of mud that keeps me sane. You can't possible leave me behind, it would be completely irresponsible. So do your duty to SHIELD, but do not be so foolish as to give your life for them.”
The screen lit up showing Loki’s bedroom, music swirling through the air. It was clear Loki had done some…alterations to his floor - of the magic variety. The room didn’t even look like a room anymore.
What Xavier finds worries him greatly. A disordered mind a wash with loathing and abysmal darkness, memories in tattered little boxes and shattered mirrors bearing the image of a monster. The grotesque monster was a caricature of the man before him. A hideous thing with hollow eyes and sharp teethe. Was this how Loki saw himself?
Except it wasn’t, because Tony knew for a fact he had stared at Steve on more than one occasion in the past hand thought about those lips and those hands and all those wonderful and completely deviant activities that could take place. He just never acted on it.
"I love you. Every part of you" James would say. Only when they were alone in their bed. The quiet darkness wrapped around them like a blanket. That's when the soothing words meant most.
Tony felt his heart skip a beat; did they escape one monster just to be plucked up by another? “How do you know my name…?”
“Aww come on sugar, just once?”
Tony tried not to laugh, “Ok, moving right along. What’s this news you have for us?”
It was 4 years after when Tony first got sick, he didn't tell anyone but Pepper found out. When Steve came home she told him. " He thought about you, he wouldn't let me call though, he had Friday look into things and knew what you were doing. What you were trying to do. He didn't want you thinking about him and getting yourself killed because you were distracted."
Loki had never really had 'friends' and spending some free time with Pepper and Steve made him feel apart of something he never felt before. There was once a time when the omega turned his royal nose up at the idea at standing around gossiping like a group of old maids. There was once a time when the omega twisted his royal nose up at the idea at standing around gossiping like a group of old maids. Yet, Frigga had never been that way, he fondly remembered the group of omega that she surrounded herself with, ones that would enter her private gardens and speak freely as if she was not the queen. There was something so free about her gentle face when she was around them.
Coming down from the orgasm, Steve blinked up at the ceiling and shivered reflexively at the pleasant tingling claiming his extremities. By then Tony had made his way back up the bed and was kissing  his chest.
Loki had lied to his alpha, but why?
When the fog cleared from the alphas brain, he felt the twitch in his groin and the strain on his back. Tony wasn’t as young as he used to be. “Steve you asleep babe?”
Even if he did not remember it clearly, James had always been out on the street with the first signs of life. There was always work to do or go out and find, always some sort of trouble to get into- or get Steve out of more often than not. From the time he could tie up his own shoes James always had somewhere to be.
“You won’t, your friend Tony. I know you are still in there somewhere.” Jim got to his feet and walked slowly toward his friend, it was a foolish thing to go but it didn’t matter. Reaching out he took the armored hand lowered it. “ That’s it, lets just calm down and talk ok?”
To add to this was the alphas own puzzling behavior. The first day after the heat Tony wouldn’t leave him alone, but now it was hard to get a read on the inventor as he flitted around the tower like a ghost. Never hanging around Steve any longer than he had to, always citing some project that he needed to get to. The last few nights, Steve spent alone on his own floor, staring up at the ceiling and wondering what it all meant.
Phil moved to the other side unbuttoning his suit coat before sitting down. “If that was the case Stark would have been hog tied and brought up here to do it himself. I have a few agents that would have gladly volunteered.”
“Feel like you're letting him down?”
The unsaid words of “You should too.”  Lingered in her gaze. That was a whole other conversation that Barnes did not want to have right now.
“Bucky…what’s gotten into you?” he asked just as the other boy dropped the file in his lap.
Steve hated covering one lie with another, but everyone said it would be better this way.
“You feel so good, so hot and tight. Fuck I could die here.”
Tony snorted and crossed his arms, “Of course I have.”
“Daddy, how did the baby get in Papa's tummy?” Wendy looked up at her father, her questioning glance soon joined by her twins.
Natasha rolled her shoulders, “You won’t say no to me when I say we have a job. Now, everyone wash up we need to see a man about some monsters.”
Welcome to Avengers TV! This is your hand and helpful guide to our upcoming programming!
Peter sniffled and clung to his neck, “Papa said it wasn’t good for you to work so much. You have to sleep and eat good.”
“Hey, it’s ok. I know it hurts but daddy’s gonna make it all better.” He said fondly unwrapping the blanket.
Steve looked over the papers and tried to force a smile, he had been trying for months to get into the army. They wouldn’t even let him into the recruitment office most times. He was an omega; therefore, not allowed to serve. Not to mention he was small and sickly, even when he was able to mask his scent he couldn’t pass the physical. “Hey that’s…great…really swell.”
Now to the alpha's absolute horror, he was the old man in the room. Young alpha's with too much privilege and all these high ideals in their heads were starting to take a foothold. Still wet behind the ears (In Tony's opinion) who's idea of a good time was going to some weird restaurant that served craft beer with names like “Rose Rock ale” and “Citric dream logger”. Talking about going gluten free and how their Omegas took yoga. Spending the week with alphas that had soft hands and even softer egos. He's sure he made one of them cry.(Sorry, not sorry)
“When the fires are consuming you, and your sacred stars won’t be guiding you…I’ve got blood…blood on my name.”
“You take such good care of me, have you been getting lessons from Pepper?”
However, every dream has to end.
Bucky eyed the torn flier and picked it up, “Steve won’t like it.” He commented reading further down before quoting the opening line “able bodied men with experience at sea.’ kinda counts me out don’t-cha think?”
Steve agreed but Tony could tell when he left the room the omega was still in a poor mood. Sure enough, went Steve joined him in the seating area he looked like a kicked puppy.
“Everything looks perfect.” Doctor Simmons said as she switched on the Doppler monitor’s sound and allowed the rapid whooshing sound of the twins heartbeats fill the exam room.
“If you need me, just call.”
“Bucky Stop! You don’t have to do this!”
Coming home after a mission was not as it used to be. There was no revelries or joking, no pizza in the common room. …No Steve to peel out of that deliciously tight uniform. No rough hands that could turn to satin on his skin. No full lips brushing his jaw and smiling against his pulse point. It felt offensive to the senses that he could still feel it if he closed his eyes tight enough. The muscle memory creating a tingle at the base of his neck. Looking down the hall out of the corner of his eye - still expecting to see blue eyes shining in the low light under dripping wet blond hair.  If he tried... Really tried, if he drank just enough, Tony could see him standing there. One hand poised on the wall and a towel hanging dangerously low on lean hips. How Steve’s skin always looked a little pink because he tended to turn the hot water on full blast. The little freckles on his shoulders or scar just behind his ear hidden along his hairline. Something before the serum, something only Tony knew about.
Steve lifted his head and tugged at the thick chains around his wrists, vabranium maybe?  His back was aching from the position but he wouldn’t tell them anything. It pissed them off to, every time he was asked anything about, Shield, the avengers, Stark Industries, hell even the weather. He just repeated the same over and over.
It was late one evening when she called his name. It just sounded different that time . She held his hand and told him how proud she was of him . Steve started to cry.
As the group of former military ascended the stairs to the main door, they were in awe of the sheer scale of the place. If Stark wanted to intimidate any visitors he did the job well. Knocking on the massive door, Steve looked back over his shoulder at the others. They had all been quick to shove the good Captain out in front.
Inside I built a wall so high around my heart, I thought I'd never fall.
“This may not be something we can do.” Bruce said. “other than to help Loki feel accepted and safe. Even then, we have no idea if that would be enough to balance him out or if there are any other additional factors. Trying to give him medications would be a moot point not only due to his metabolism but that because he is another species we can't predict the reaction.”
Strange huffed and made a few symbols in the air before a small glowing arc appeared over little Peters forehead. "just for show i promise" he quietly told the Captain. Before taking the squirmy little infant and walking out to the middle of the towers launch deck. The rest of the avengers had gathered around and the proud parents looked on as the Doctor raised the child up to the morning sun.
“That is true, however, the process is a bit more forgiving for mutant children.” Loki spoke in a matter of fact way.
Even worse, was the public’s response, the cheering in the street, children wearing black iron man masks with glowing red eyes? Civilian’s who took to the streets dragging out and beating individuals accused of being ‘hydra sympathizers’. Steve wondered how many innocents had been harmed or even killed from wrongful accusations.
“Tony I don’t mean it like that,” Steve soothed, leaning in to kiss the now clean jaw. “It’s soft, you’re very handsome.”
Tony looked to the visors read outs, Human signature body temperature just above normal even in this climate. Height, weight, all analyzed and then the read out turned blue - Identification Complete: Steven Grant Rogers-Stark
Steve wanted to curl up and die when he saw Bruce and Tony enter, by now he had stripped down to nothing with little more than the balled up bed sheet to preserve his modesty.
Steve ground his teeth and god this wasn’t how it was suppose to go at all, “That’s not it.. That’s..”
“That’s it, now sit down.” Tony said tugging over a rolling chair with his food and nodding to it. He waited until the omega sat down and ran his fingers slowly through Steve’s scalp and over his shoulders. “Ok, arms up sunshine.”
Ashamed of the things he had done and the lives lost at his hand and indirectly. It was not hard to tell by the icy glances that many here felt his life here now as just another shattered illusion. The overwhelming anxiety crept and crawled over his skin as Loki tried to calm his internal dialog which laughed along with every passing glimpse.
It wasn’t until they rounded the corner were two armed guards were stationed and Phil pulled a small object from his pocket and motioned for him to wait.
Natasha reclined back against her lover’s chest, Bucky protectively wrapping an arm around her waist. “Because, all he has left is faith. He has to believe in this because if we can’t…then everything he’s worked for means nothing.”
“Ok I’m going to touch your gland,” Bruce warned before plying gentle pressure around the swollen node that rested along the upper sternocleidomastoid muscle of the neck. His touch met with a hiss from Rogers. “It’s inflamed, which isn’t uncommon in older omega that are unmated; however, it’s the pain reaction that concerns me. It should be sensitive but not painful.”
“Well...what's it say”
For Tony, all the rules just felt oppressive.
“Don’t cry babe, I’ve got you… I’ve got you.”
Tony could hear Steve panting and watched the security feed as the omega curled up in the center of the bed, sheets and pillows wadded up against the headboard. Steve looked completely out of it -reaching blindly for a glass of water on the nightstand.
The other alpha shook his head and flinched slightly. “Trust me, I'm feeling like dried up shit. Hopefully the doc won't be to pissed having to patch up my sorry ass.”
There was a loud boom from above that shook the building. “What took you so long Stark.”
Like how the children in the tower ran around like little wild animals during play time – with the exception of Nathaniel Barton who tended to draw back when the volume grew too loud. How this worried Clint about the little boys ears.  How Pepper liked to spend her Saturday nights catching up on her guilty internet pleasure – youtube game channels.  Loki found himself smiling as he halfway listened to Tony and James argue over what flavor of ice cream was the best, ( they were both wrong – it's birthday cake).  Through all of this, Loki realized that all of these people hadn't once had an unkind word to say to him. They just wanted to help him, and as hard to stomach as that was ...deep down – Loki wanted to be helped.
However, he could not just come out and say it. That was…well it was somewhat lame. He wanted it to be special, something that he and his Alpha would treasure for years.
“That’s right, I’m here.. I promise you I’m here..”
He let out a slow breath as the inventors fingers slipped into him again. “Tony…”  The name fell on a breathy note as the omega arched against the mattress, fingers twisting into the sheets.
In a few years, Tony would surprise everyone by perching on Sleipnir back and speeding through the current whooping at the top of his lungs. Not that anyone would question…mischief must run in his blood.
“Jee thanks Stark, didn't know ya had such a way with words.” Barnes said looking up tiredly.
To make matters worse, Tony had been sent off on a mission in Steve’s place. Therefore, for the last two weeks the former soldier found himself milling around the tower in an increasingly sour mood.
They left him, they wanted to be there when Bruce explained things to Peter, even though Banner swore he could keep it together. Pepper wanted to be sure.
Wrangling the rambunctious pair to get dressed and be calm as they headed down to the lab floor had been a remarkable feat in and of itself.
Truth was a far colder thing, staring back at the omega on a little plastic digital readout. The words
Steve did not sound fine, the slurred speech and thickened accent did not project fine in the slightest. Tony tracked the location of his com and redirected his flight path. “Yeah because that sound’s reassuring… I’m on my way old man.”
This time there was more at stake, more of them had things they couldn't lose. It's different when you have little to nothing to come home to. Going into battle used to be a rush. While the adrenaline still flooded their veins there was always an under current of dread for each of them.
“Or, try this on for size! You me.. Hot tub, lets just see what happens?”
Burying himself in deep, Stark thought he was burning. There was something even better now than the first time. Steve arched and gasped reaching wildly and their hands clasped as the alpha started to move, their intertwined fingers resting over the mass of life they had already created.
"Tony, I need to talk to you." Her eyes where shining and tip of her nose was a little red. It occurred to the mechanic then that Jarvis hadn't announced the group's arrival. Still no alarm bells went off, not yet.
Something in Steve’s expression went cold, something that told Tony what he already knew was true. That Steve knew SHIELDS files were wrong and said nothing. Captain America wasn’t as virtuous as everyone believed.
“Tony.”
Natasha took her hand back and thought over the conversation she had with Barnes during their stake out. Clearly, Loki wanted a family just as much if not more so if this had devastated him to this degree. Taking their continued childlessness as a personal failure. “Are you sure? Have you been to a doctor? Or talked to your Alpha about this?”
The skies grew black and now the water was glowing a violent lime green that seemed to grow from somewhere deep beneath the surface and envelop everything. The temperature was dropping rapidly and the harsh winds picked up. Whatever this was it was beyond human understanding.
Loki waved him off easily enough with one of those barely there smiles of his. An air of easiness that the alpha had missed. If felt like the turning of a page and deep within him James felt the tug of hope that maybe, just maybe this was the start of something better. Perhaps the journey was a long one but one he was happy to take with his Omega.
“Of course Captain, would you like your usual or to try something new?” The AI asked primly.
The omega sat there shoulders hunched forward with a slight pink tinge to his cheeks, “Nope, that about gets it.”
Breakfast was semi quiet, more so than it usually was with Peter. That was another thing that made Tony worry. Another thing that was his fault. What if Peter had anxiety and it stunted his speech? What if his son just stopped talking one day? It wasn’t as if Tony knew how that sort of thing worked. His childhood hadn’t been the best but in retro-spect maybe, that was why he was so awful at being an adult. The last thing he ever wanted was for Peter to turn out as he had.
Steve had always found it amazing how his mother could do that to. Pepper was cut from the same cloth, poise and grace that covered an ironclad wit. Steve could see why Tony hired her. He allowed himself to be sat down on the leather sectional, the other omega patting his knee in a gesture of solidarity.
Because Steve didn't come back.
Bruce moved around to ease the billionaire back into a chair. “Good job Tony not only did you manage to impregnate a national icon but you’re an over achiever.”
The following days went much the same, bouts of slow teasing between the apex of heat and rut.
“Sir, Captain Rogers is not responding to my hails.”
Steve did his best to calm down and think rationally, he would have remembered something like being frozen again. He had to remember, but the more he thought the less plausible answers he was getting and that was crushing.
“Oh shit… J give me a visual of Steve’s room!”
“Of course, take all the time you require.” He leaned in close with hesitation, she allowed him to place a kiss on her cheek as though they were brother and sister. “I love you Amora.” he wanted her to say it, to look in her eyes and maybe see something change.
“So why not let the secret die with you, better yet why not just warn Steve... or hell, you could have gotten on Fury’s radar, why come to me with something that supposedly this important? I‘m sure you know I‘m not exactly the poster boy for nondisclosure. I mean I did tell the entire world that I‘m a super hero and most like to play that a little closer to the vest, what with secrete lairs and solitude. ” Tony clenched the still closed envelope.
Something in Steve broke at that revelation, “What?”
“Steve’s been taken.”
Tony had come home that afternoon looking worn but happy, he'd said they were making progress. The couple curled up in bed just taking familiar comfort in each other after such a trying day. The alpha smiled kindly and gently stroked his mates chest. “We have a plan babe, it's not super solid but it's better than nothing.”
SHIELD knew more than they let on because James suspected if this were some sort of biochemical agent then they wouldn't be here just watching. This would have been a snatch and grab at the least...and a termination mission at the most. Therefore, it must not have been anything particularly nasty to the public at large.
This was all a shameful tactic but Loki just needed to be alone right now. He needed time to breathe and he couldn't do it with James so close. The alpha would know instantly something was a miss and then they would have to talk... no he just wasn't up for that right now.
Hurt - Disturbed
Isolating the signatures to one room in particular, Vengeful locked on and the repulsor blast sent the filthy windows and tangled miniblinds blasting inward.
Of course Tony would do that...
Broken promises, broken relationships, broken dreams. Everything about him was broken, he was splayed open and left craving the barest of human affection. A gentle hand that had no motives would have been so welcomed but then...then he couldn't trust such gentleness not anymore. Loki found himself drowning in the thoughts he tried so hard to lock away. Sleepless nights spent staring at the clock as the digital numbers ticked on until dawn - taunting his weary eyes.
“Kinda, the baby will be a part of daddy and me. He or she is going to love you very much, just like we do and when the baby is big enough you’ll have someone to play with. Won’t that be nice?”
To be seen and not heard, is not such a foreign concept, even in the halls of Asgard.
“J, Call Barnes, Buckaroo and I need to have a word”
Right now though Steve didn't know what to do with himself. Sitting around watching TV seemed like a waste of time. He wasn't used to such a sedimentary lifestyle. The Captain couldn't even hit the gym due to doctors orders.
It had been so long since he felt this that he’d almost forgotten, now trying to stretch out and breath through the discomfort he could remember this all to well. He should have noticed it; of course, he hadn’t back then either.
They didn’t say anything for a while, Steve simply sat there stone faced while Tony wrapped his hand. Finally, the brunette couldn’t take it anymore. “This has nothing to do with thinking you can’t take care of yourself. I know damn well you can, this has to do with things you don’t know about. Things that my old man found out about and never got the chance to check on. Damn it Steve, we‘re friends aren‘t we?”
Maybe Jarvis could tell how serious Tony was or maybe he’d just grown concerned with the way Steve was pacing and inevitably ended up standing motionless in front of the nesting room. The poor omega looking like he craved the comfort of the space but too stubborn to give into the instinct.
“Isn't it Tony? I'm not stupid. With Christen or Maya, hell even Tobias I knew what that was. That was you getting your eye caught on something pretty and once you had it the magic was gone. That was you getting a little too drunk at a fundraiser or hell even you just being you! This though.....no. Don't sit there and tell me it's not what I think.” she seethes and he tries to sooth her temper but its a lost cause.
This isn't what Nick wanted to hear, complications left room for error. The unknown was more dangerous than any weapon. Unknown got people killed. He tosses the folder onto the meeting table, photos and files spilling across the glass top.
Loki wanted to wait until his mate was at least half way through before he tentatively proposed his idea. Watching carefully as he tucked into his own meal, eventually finding his moment.
“Ok…”
Fashion, music, cinema- Loki found it easy enough to assimilate with the culture. Then again he had always been like when traversing the realms. He liked to fully amerce himself in a new world and  all of its life.
He just felt uncomfortable under that sure and steady gaze as the other man stood there in the door way. They hadn't seen each other in a while (Tony had been drink out after a particularly nasty encounter with his father which ended in the youth sloshed on cheek whiskey for days.) Pepper had covered for him while he sobered up enough to face Bucky.
“Welcome back Sergeant, is there anything I can do for you?”
“Not finished Steve, now sit. Phil would you be so kind as to make some tea?” Pepper’s tone easily shifting from scolding to cordial.
Bruce crossed his arms studying the numbers, it could work…or they could possible O.D a living national treasure. At the end of the day this would be Steve‘s choice. “If we do this we start low, we will have to wait until the heat starts and then see what direction we need to go. Stopping it or  helping you at least have it safely. Then after we see were your at, it could be that once you get through it then the serum will recognize it at a normal body function. That’s the best case scenario anyway.”
Sitting alone on their bed, theirs...the word seems so peculiar now. Like this space isn't big enough for him anymore. Steve had worked so hard to put away that uncomfortable feeling of being too large for his skin. In this moment, he felt thrust right back to that scared kid who was suddenly walking around in a six foot frame he didn't know what to do with. Banging his shoulders on door frames and bumping his head in cars.
Stane tipped his head and took up his coat from a nearby chair, “see ya Howard, oh and I’ll let you know about those new specs. I really think we can do some great things moving forward. You’ll feel much better with the work.”
“The captain is resting under order of Ms. Potts; she would like to speak with you.”
“Steve? I think its dead.”
In an instant, the heroes where back in the thick of it, Tony moved to back up Thor in destroy the heavy machinery. Clint, Steve and Natasha go after jeeps. The archer shooting the jeeps drivers and heavy gunners, Rogers muscling his way through with the shield and Widow batting clean up on stragglers and kicking drivers out of their seats.
Steve cringed internally “Sorry, I would have helped if I had known...”
Tony would have laughed if it didn’t hurt, trying to roll over as the current tugged at the heavy suit. “Yeah that’s a no go, daddy’s’ gatta take care of business J. It’s sweet though that you’re worried about me.”
“It’s no trouble really.”
Asmuch as he would have liked to relish in her beauty and take solace in her touch – there was another matter pressing in his mind. “Have I missed much? I noticed Duchess was in my mother's gardens and had hoped Loki was visiting, but he wasn't there.”
The door of his cell blasted inward with a flash of blue light.
“Steve….fuck.” Tony pinched the bridge of his nose watching the soldier storm away.
Title: Match for Cap
The lights where dimmed and a garment bag hung on the back of a chair at the bar. The long black bag had a little card with his name on it. Steve turned the little square between his fingers, the writing on the back wasn’t Tony’s and on the front was the address of a tailor. He unzipped the back and saw a suit, expensive - Brooks Brothers, a name that even Steve knew from his day.  This had to be a thousand dollar suit if not more.
“Yes. Yes…” Steve drooled pressing his hips back until he felt Tony’s thighs pressed his. “So deep Alpha…please…”
AN: Would anyone be interested in a winterfrost-centric  book 2?
Everyone should have really showered Bruce Banner in praise for keeping the world safe from certain extinction on a daily basis when his Bea was in a mood.
“I suppose so.”
Steven did not know what to make of what he'd just witnessed. Was this a power all mer possessed or just this one? The Stark-look-alike seemed shocked. “Hey calm down it's alright please let me help you.”
Steve was not above voicing his opinion on the cocky brunette’s behavior.
James needed help.
Not surprisingly Tony responded to said shovel talk with a cheeky wink and a comment of ‘only breaking in’ the good captain. Pepper of course knew better than to think Tony would ever purposefully hurt anyone. Still, she felt some odd kinship with the memory of Sarah Rogers. Someone needed to look out for Steve, and it had been her station in the tower as a ‘den mother’ of sorts in Stark Industries.
Natasha glared at him, “We won’t loose him. Steve isn’t dying, we won’t let that happen.”
and he wasn‘t even sure if the old man really meant it. Maria…well, by the 80’s if she wasn’t in a Valium haze she was away at her functions and would only favor Tony with a sloppy lipstick smearing kiss and those big teary brown eyes when she told him she loved him. What did he know about being a parent? The only things he’d ever raised were just that - things, he had his inventions and the bots. Real living attachment was hard to maintain and what if he did something wrong? What if let their kid get hurt, or worse - what if Tony …No, he didn’t want to think about that because there was no way he would become that.
Loki wanted to hear the words ‘it’s going to be fine.’ but he knew James would never patronize him like that, never lie to him. His alpha would not say such a thing because he didn’t know. Not knowing was the worst because somewhere deep inside that dark voice whispered in the omegas ear ‘it’s not going to be fine, it will never be fine again’
Meanwhile the youngest royal was feeling awful.
Peeking in once more on his alpha, still drooling into the pillow, The Captain gathered up his duffle bag headed down to the garage. Hopefully by the time he had the pups fed and a dozen of Tony's favorite pasties in hand, the alpha would be wake enough to handle them for the day when he dropped the little ones off and headed off to the Triskelion.
Loki took the bottle and squeezed the flexible plastic gently. Within the silence of the room the cracklings seemed too loud. Conceivably it was merely in his head, maybe everything was too much and he shouldn't have tried to come out today. Perhaps it had been too ambitious.
Of course, Steve was right. There Tony was spread out dramatically on the sofa absolutely dripping with lamentation. It was funny in a way because Tony Stark never did anything halfway. “Tony.”
“Baby, come on Steve, say something sweetheart.”
He's up and dressing, slipping on a started shirt and black tie like battle armor. All the while maintaining a cool lit- not even an ounce of sleep in his voice to suggest he did such a thing at all. Asking questions and demanding a visual was second nature.
Steve rolled over watching the two people he loved most sleep, Tony was curled on his side with Bucky at his back -metal arm draped over the omegas baby bump. Rogers never thought he would ever have this, yet here he was. It may have taken 70 years but it was worth the wait.
Tony.. where was Tony. Had they hurt him? Was he hear somewhere? Where they doing the same thing to him?
“This is really good.” Steve commented, already on his third slice.
This wasn't just enhancing what a man had in his heart- this was perfecting and creating. This came from the mind and the human mind was one dangerous place. James knew that better than anyone.
Bruce wasn't exactly thrilled to find out he had accidentally passed on his genes to his reformed villain boyfriend. However, the soft look on Loki's face as he stood by the windows of their home, one hand protectively over the high slope of his stomach, made up for it. It more than made up for it. Sure, was it weird – absolutely. Finding out that the Jotunar were intersex and thus the possibility that this wasn't just a prank was...enlightening. Also, terrifying. Though not so terrible as the months that followed.
Still, wandering place to place, chasing down a cure for the creature he so foolishly - unknowingly unleashed.
The response was a crunching sound followed by a muffled “fine” yeah that was weird.
“Daddy!!!” Two little heads popped up from the sofa and clamored over to him.
Tony cringed at the old slang term, but that was where Steve came from and where all the anger was coming from. Tony had just opened up an old would and Steve wasn’t done.
Something that was both sweet and painful. For all the years Steve had spent in the ice, it was this one moment that he wished like hell he had been there for Tony when he really was this age.
With a sharp intake of breath Tony blinked away unshed tears, he needed to get back to work. The others had not been supportive of this new Tony Stark. They said he should step back, take a breath; think of what Steve would have wanted.
Bruce fished in his bag for a hormone testing kit. “Ok Steve I need you to open your mouth for me. I promise it will be over soon, just a little swab.”
“If you want the best for me, let me do something I know how to do. Let me show them all that there is more we can learn from the above! I’m not going out there being stupid! I’m innovating!” Tony screamed, fists clenched before storming past his father.
“Please remain calm Captain.”
“Of course not, we only want what is best for you Loki.” Charles reached out taking one of the other males long slender boned hands between his own. “Just because someone stumbles and loses their path, doesn’t mean they can’t be saved. Please remember that Loki.”
There was a time Natasha had made the drive up to the compound at least once a week while training the new SHIELD recruits. Other times she'd head up with Tony to make repairs or adjustments to the quinjet.
“Wha…”
“Nearly two years...” the words were chocked and Loki damned himself for it. He didn't want pity, he didn't need it. “It just doesn’t …I never…”
“Dad…. something…something’s coming…” Tony’s eyes were wide and afraid, he didn’t know how he knew but he did, there was something out there and it was getting closer. Something terrible, evil and filled with hate. It was coming to tear them apart. He needed to warn them, needed to warn everyone but he couldn’t. The world grew dark as his eyes rolled back in his head.
Loki smiled, a year or so ago that would have worked. Peter would have sternly glared and watched his bear for any sign of thievery. Children grew so fast and became so bright, looking at the little boys twinkling brown eyes Loki knew this little boy would grow up to be just as smart if not more so than his alpha. However, it wasn't necessarily pride that Loki felt. More than anything, looking at the pup just hurt.  Peter was such a sweet child, such a gift to have him here but at the same time, he reminded Loki of all the things he could never have. Never would here be a bright little face sitting on these counters everyday asking to help make breakfast for their father. “What a bright boy you are.” he said, voice breaking with out his permission.
“No, I wasn't scheduled. May I offer you a drink agent?”
Tony watched the older alpha go, Stark's morning coffee and sweet run completely forgotten he leaned back against the steel wall of the elevator as the doors closed once again. “J, Lab F floor.”
Tony felt another little volley of thumps against his leg, which was now pressed against Steve’s stomach. No wonder his poor omega wasn’t sleeping,
“Nat! You're home, why didn't you call? I would have come to meet you.” Pepper frowned and rubbed her belly. “I Missed you” She said before glancing over at Bruce, “We missed you.”
Whats new pussy cat! Loooooookiiii
He had asked Pepper to keep him informed on the status of Steve’s current mission concerning the Winter soldier. Not that he was checking up on Steve or anything, he was bored and it was either that or face-time Bruce who was in Brazil looking at plant spores.  Really Bruce was too excited about fungi to be normal. “Anything else Potts?”
Worse, the nights he dreamed of the invasion, not being in control of The Other or Thanos, not the chittari or being captured.
“You wanted to talk! I wanted to talk but apparently you had better things to do!”
“Good or I would have hogtied and dragged you down there myself.” Steve snorted and rolled onto his back, dragging Tony’s hand with him and planting it firmly on his stomach. “You promise me Stark, here and now that you will be here for these kids. I grew up with out my pa and that’s not right for a pup. I don’t want that for mine.”
“It must have been arduous to struggle so.” Loki looks a bit sad thinking about his Alpha and Steve as children going hungry. “I was spoiled I suppose. As a noble prince I naturally wanted for nothing as a boy.”
The agent smiled raising a hand in greeting as he righted his posture from leaning against the door-frame. “I know this might come as a shock. Came as a shock to me honestly. It’s amazing what medical science and a little SHIELD underground tech can do.”
“That’s just it, everything will change.” Steve then explained the situation in depth, the journal.. The uncertainly of his upcoming heat - which they had no idea when would happen. The plan to deal with it, it felt good to really talk and the calming presence of those who shared his biology helped.
"Shut up Casey, no one believes your shit you old Irish bastard." One of the men said lighting the cigar jutting from his lips. "Sirens... huh, what kinda fools ya take us for bub?"
“Mr. Stark.”
“Did you think I would be so callus not to see you off to battle? I have even extended such a kindness to that oaf of a brother mine. It would stand to reason I could trouble myself a few moments to see my oaf of an alpha off, would it not?” Loki spoke, folding his arms over his chest. Trying as he might to look put off and bored, but his alpha knew what that look really said.  It was all the little pout in the noble’s lips and the slight rise of his shoulders.
Barnes smiled and glances over to where Loki was arguing with Thor about something. It was always something with those two. “Of course you won’t, we got this thing for high maintenance brats don’t we?”
Entering the apartment he followed the pheromones back to the nesting room, Loki has the presence of mind to go there which was a good sign.  However, the state he found his omega in was less than ideal. The ravenette was crushed into a corner ringing with sweat, his eyes wide and hands balled up until the knuckles where a ghostly white.
‘good’ he thought. ‘I hope there’s nothing left but rubble.’
“That almost tickled.” Mallen said grabbing the right gauntlet in his massive glowing hand.
It was exactly one year later when Edwin Jarvis came pounding n Peggy and Angie’s door. It was pouring rain and the man was soaked to the bone and trembling.
“Bucky used to love this. It was a real treat to get fresh fruit in the tenements. Mostly it was just canned every now and then. My Ma would pitch in a few pennies with Miss Barnes, and they'd get what they could at the market.”Steve said brushing flower from his hands.
“It’s your show. G’head.” how bad could it be, he’d been stuck in a yoga lesson with Banner and that god-awful classical shit before.
“Did you not have class today? I guess I'm lucky anyone was home.” She chuckled and sat down across from him. Loki had put a good bit of distance between them.
“He’s only a few days old. Please, if you don’t help him he won’t survive. Doctors, Priests, none of that is going to help him right now. What he needs is something more, and this was the only shot I had. I’ll give you anything you want…just… I want my boy to live.” He was desperate.
This of course Bucky knew, his hindbrain purring at the keen tumbling form his lovers lip at the teasing touch. “Come on sweetheart, you wanna be good for me don’t ya?” the alpha nosed at his pregnant lover’s neck.
The owner of the shined leathers tugged at the wrist of his black gloves. Looking out at the able bodies at his disposal, all fodder for the cause. If all these men died it would mean nothing, it never meant anything. Only one thing had meaning and that was complete superiority.
The team touched down on a field inside central park and the battle began. As usual, the Captain took point directing each of the avengers to where they were most needed. This was his first time out in the field as a group since telling everyone about his nature. Part of Steve expected reluctance from the alphas yet was pleasantly surprised when he wasn’t met with any.
“Honestly?”
Now the three of them sat in the quinjet buckled up side my side. Barton and Stark kept looking back at them laughing.
“Could do a slide too.” The widow quipped kicking a solider in the throat.
Crashing in through a service hallway outside of the private entrance Tony tried his best to refocus. The bond was gone but he was still an alpha, even with all this shit in his veins he wasn't going to let it control him, wasn't going to let it steal even more from him. Part of his brain growled at his petulance but he stood his ground.
“Of course, I want them to be safe and healthy you know that.”
“They haven't noted the changes that we have. I get that and that being said – I know everyone will be on their best behavior. The director intentionally included.”He stated looking very self-satisfied.
Till the end of the line.
Watching someone you love get weaker and weaker isn't easy.
“That wasn't so bad huh?” James smiles and kisses the back of his hand. He's right of course, the exam wasn't bad.  A bit embarrassing at some points when he had to disrobe, but nothing overtly traumatizing.
“Tony…”
The door closed behind him and Clint turned, still holding the tiny socks. Pietro was standing there with an unsure little smile. “It …has been a while and I thought maybe it was time, do you think we could?”
Green annoyed eyes slid from the porcine rim to the large oak door. Duchess growling softly at his side as the beast agreed that no one should be disturbing them. Loki waved his hand casting a seeing charm on the door, the center glowing and opec - allowing him to see whom it was currently darkening his door step.
Phil was the one who brought out the suitcase and helmet. “Go, I’ll have Clint handle your paper work.”
Bruce eyed the ship cautiously before following, he did not want Tony to go alone and get hurt. Tony might have been older but he was small for his age. Bruce was nine and Tony had just turned 11 yet they were still the same size. “Tony…Tony where are you…” Bruce called out in the darkened hull of the ship.
“You know that's not true babe.”
The thunderous sound of tiny feet rocketed down the hall; Steve barely had enough time to nudge Tony awake before the bedroom door slid open and a tearful little ball of energy launched onto the bed.
Natasha pulled out her phone with a nod. “Clint, how’s it look?  Yeah.. Let’s just say the cavalries just arrived. Can you get me an ETA for Riverdale park?  Yeah that’ll work, oh and… see if you can get your hands on the Shield.. don’t ask just do birdbrain.” She snapped the phone shut with a soft smile.  “We roll out in 10, ever been to Kroyak mountains Cap?”
If i posted a story about !Abusive Tony/Skinny Steve would anyone read that? it would be kinda dark. Just wondering!
“Sweetheart, why don't you go lay down for a bit while I take care of dinner then after I’ll run you a bath. Sound good?”
Tony instantly recognized the restraints; they were some he made for SHIELD. Seems hydra borrowed quite a few toys from the former when Price was in charge. A little fiddling with the mechanism had the cuffs released. Tony frowned at the raw red lines left in their wake. Intellectually, he knew the serum would protect Steve form his injuries but still…it ached to see him like this.
“How… I thought it was bioelectronics. There's only so far you can go with nanite tech before you end up all terminator and that's nothing like the serum.
Tony sat there on the front row of the church listening to some priest drone on about peace that knows no understanding and the embrace of heaven.  Tony didn’t feel at peace. He would never know peace or understanding again. Steve was his peace.
He'd have these words spoken in a low silken voice next to his ear.
Steve shook his head, “Your Daddy’s a lunatic..” drumming his fingers over his stomach. “Guess its just us then.”
“Captain, I hate to have to ask as I know this is a sensitive subject for you.” Simmons started but pushed ahead with a nod from Bruce. It had to be done. “I will need to do a pelvic exam.”
Those words never felt more real that right now.
The long sat on the foot of the bed in the soft blue dress. It was cotton, pale like the sky and buttoned all the way down the front. It was perfect.
“Whatever you’re doing with Tony, I won’t let you use him.”
Loki wanted to scoff at the idea of needing anyone. Even so, he knew better than to discredit the words of Asgard’s Queen. Frigga’s magic was special even among their people. She had what some might call ‘sight’ of things not yet to be, or not yet set in stone. While she could not direct this magic, specifically she did have visions from time to time. Her intuition was also unmatched.
“To late son, should’ a stayed home by the fire.” Steve said as he proceeded to throw the snowmobile and rider.
“In my pussy.”
“Thanks Jemma, could you tell Tony?”
“We cannot meet the creature head on Thor, you must command the warriors to flank creature and lure it out. This is a beast like any other and dull witted!” Odin shouted back, making his way around the crumbling remnants of what was left of the palace entrance.
Peggy hung up her hat and coat by the door and shook out her hair, this was worse than she thought. Howard had always been rather flighty and sensitive, no matter how much he denied that fact.
Tony’s head snapped up at the words, “What?”
"What show was that?" The soldier asked, despite the niggling in the back of his brain saying he wouldn’t want to know. He hid his worry well, he hoped it was just going to be something foolish like ‘oh the building that fell on you’ or ‘the explosion that sent you flying into next week... literally.’ those were things he could deal with. Things that could be resolved and he could go home to his family.
Loki knew she didn’t want it, didn’t care at all and perhaps found the idea of his affection disgusting. He could tell by how she plucked the necklace from his fingers as if it was something deadly. Eyeing it at arm’s length when she told him how beautiful it was. Nothing was going to change.
Steve got the shield up and dug his feet into the snow. Still the blast forced him back a good 8 feet. “Damn it Stark!”
The yellow eyed male sighed, “You mean because you are not strictly human.”
Tony’s shoulders slumped and he glared at the plating and various pieces. “With great power comes…. gaudy ass duds…doath grandmother know we wearith her drapes.”
The soldier stopped, “Tony, did you ever see the body? Didn’t you think that was strange?”
Tony let it slide, “This ones nice, I think you’ll like it.”
Loving someone isn't effortless and it never will be, it's those nights that you can't stand the sight of someone – but saying ' I love you' anyway, because you want those to be last words they hear if god forbid they never hear anything else.
The alpha growled pleasantly. Yep, Tony was going to be impossible now.
Steve Lifted the mer into his arms and was soon breaching the surface. The young man groaned and head lolled side to side. Stark's kid was in grim shape that was for sure. Weather or not it was from the battle raging below or something else. Steve would have put money on it having to do with the light glowing in the youths chest. Speaking of...what that light getting brighter?
Tony’s eyes snapped open at the massive roar that Hulk let out. “What just happened? Please tell me nobody kissed me.”
They planned it. The third heat after they bonded, they would start trying. No charms or chemical prevention just let things happen or not. It didn't at first, and that was ok. They didn't stress it and hadn't told anyone. A year later, they hadn't even thought about all the times in between that there had been no fruit from their efforts. It was what it was.
“Aye Aye Captain!” Clint shouted with a salute
Art is mine, drawing armor is ..hard be nice.
"I am silent because it is quiet obvious that my feelings mean nothing to you. Moreover, there is a child mere meters away and you know my feelings on quarreling before small ears." Loki crossed his arms over his belly.  He was not happy about this in the slightest, today was his day to relax not watch the Stark-Rogers spawn.  It wasn't that he didn't like Peter, truthfully he did, he just didn't interact with the child much.
This was different though, this was the usual – 'I don't socialize with mortals' air that Loki had from time to time, this was something else, something dark that clung on the tall slender man like a led coat.
Steve was not handling being benched well. He was the leader, a soldier, a man of action...he was also pregnant.
Stark bit the side of his fist. Whatever amazingly great thing he’d done in a past life to deserve this… he was thanking his lucky stars. Or in this case Stars and Stripes
3. Amiee Allen - Calling the maker
It was time to pick up the pieces and do the only thing he knew how to do, Tony Stark was going back to work, and hell hath no fury than a man with nothing left to lose.
Sure, maybe he couldn’t beat Tony in the ‘silent self loathing’ department. He was damn close though, and from an outside perspective, it was troubling.
“Water is fine, or perhaps some lemonade. You know I have a terrible sweet tooth.” He smiled kindly.“ How have you been my boy?” the professor politely asked as Loki made hos way into the kitchen adjacent to the sitting room.
Steve had never been so grateful that despite everything Tony didn’t bat an eye at the request to remove the arm and try to save Bucky. The engineer just set his shoulders back and went to work. He’d even been there when Steve woke up in the infirmary yet again, Tony hadn’t said anything about what Bucky had done, and he just held his hand.
For a faint moment, Steve could smell the distress on him and turned. Their eyes met briefly before Loki can calm himself and insist that nothing is wrong. It is wrong and they both know it. Steve follow his eye line and realizes what causes the slip in the other omegas usually impenetrable facade.
Thor slipped inside, the baby now slumbering against his chest, “Brother, I must have words with you. Something…Amora…” He didn’t really know how to finish that statement.
The captain wasn’t sure why…but it felt right, it felt like the only thing he could do. He took his lovers face in his hands and placed a kiss between the engineer’s tired eyes. “I love you and I forgive you, but I need you to forgive yourself.” Steve felt his own tears threatening, hoping this was the right thing.  Tony did all of this under some banner of revenge all in His name. So if in someway he could absolve those sins he would try. He would take it all if he could. “Please…I can’t lose you to this anymore than you could lose me.”
Loki pulled away and stumbled, Bruce reached out again to catch him. “Look at me...what am I worth now? You would spend your life playing nursemaid to me, David?” Loki's voice was laced with pain as he spoke Bruce's middle name, he'd liked it so much from the moment he'd learned it. Bruce loved to hear him say it because other than his own mother... Loki was the only person alive who used it. There was something so beautiful and special about hearing it fall from his lips and now..now it sounded like a cry for mercy.
Steve looked up, brows kitting for a moment. However Stark beet him to the response.
“Sir”
Pre-heat had started mid morning, having become much easier to settle into the last couple of years, Steve almost felt like a normal omega. Able to mark the calendar with a small margin of error. Provided there were no upcoming important mission or Intel suggesting something was amiss in the great big world. Of course, since Bucky had returned and the team had extended and reached out to other exceptional individuals – Steve found himself with a more predictable scheduled these days.
When the EMT’s arrived at the tower Tony had Steve had already left with Thor, having had to convince the man that riding in the car ahead was better than using the hammer, they all agreed that the pack would be there to welcome their newest little member.
“Tall, dark and broody came back here?” He interrupts; as Stark is often want to do.
Only it seemed just when Tony Stark was ready to be the responsible one. Someone else had other plans.
The thunderer smiled and put a heavy hand on the omegas shoulder, “For you friend Steven, I would indeed. Son of Barnes is your shield brother, I understand your pain and would do my utmost to alleviate it.”
Loki will never forget hearing his mother scream for healers as his Brother entered carrying the seemingly lifeless child.
Even considering it now Loki wondered if he was even one-tenth the person she was. She would never have fallen as far as he had would she? The bitter words of his mind condemning his own weakness were hard to shake. He could almost imagine that if he were to have a child he would crumble at the first sine of their pain. Would they be cursed to suffer as he had or would their parentage of human and Frost giant cause even more maladies? Loki tried his best not to focus on his fears, that was what steered him down this road in the first place.
Thor hauled his thin brother into lap, not caring if anyone should enter and discover them in such a childish position. He could feel Loki trembling with tears and everything in him was screaming to guard his family member. “Even if I can not I will be here for you in any way I may. Please, brother, tell me what I can do to ease your pain.”
“I’m sorry Jim…I really am, but your friend is gone. Time you learned that the hard way.”
“Tony it’s not just about being convincing. Look, last time - well we weren’t exactly ready. I wouldn’t change our lives now for the world because I love those kids and I know you do too; but I really want this. Not just for me but for us.” Steve reached out and took his alphas hands. “I want us to do this together.”
Even being around the assassin brought back memories of Howard’s journal. The mentions of how close Barnes and Steve had been. It wasn’t hard to see with those pained longing looked from the blond that the same might still be true. Maybe this whole time Steve wanted to be with the man he knew, the friend he remembered. It was clear that there was something there and  a person never forgets their first love.  Tony found himself sick at the thought, how so much could have been different if Barnes had never fallen into enemy hands.
Alas, for the alpha things stopped just short of skin-to-skin, it was hard to be so respectful of Steve’s wishes but Tony was managing. He was in this for the long hall and if he had to court until his next heat then he was going to do it. Even if that was months away.
“Right away Sir, anything else?” Jarvis was sounding a little too pleased.
His eyes scanned the diagnosis and a big grin spread under his mask. "Why would I be! We're gonna have a little spiderling! I love you petey pie.....and you are so hot to me right now. Think of all the hot sweaty..."
Pepper hummed to herself a moment before leaning back against the low wall. “He did the thing…the Tony thing.. Actually no maybe it’s a Stark thing.”
“So should I have some smelling salts on hand this time around Tones?” Bruce commented wryly.
As soon as the door shut Bruce looked over at him ."Loki..."
"I can't deal with this right now."
“Tony…” Steve wrapped his arm around his alpha that night in bed, snuggling up to the inventors back.
“Steve, are you ok?  talk to me.” She moved closer and began rubbing the blonds’  back only to find it lightly damp with sweat.
So armed with tea, a stack of adult coloring books, and pens – Bruce Banner made an attempt at soothing the other Mr. Barnes.
Loki wished there was an answer to everything, some magic in the world that would somehow undo the wrongs he felt. A way to turn back the clock and never know the things that hurt him most.  Life didn't work like that, there is no reset button and once you pierce the veil thats it.  He found himself compartmentalizing and tucking away all the difficult emotions because he was ready to feel them. Feeling them meant dealing with it and dealing with it meant talking about it.  That...was something he not going to do.
Tony rolled his eyes, “Yeah well now the sinks not worth anything, come on sugar. This looks intensely uncomfortable and I can’t leave you in here, Pep would murder me if I was well-rested and you looked like a zombie because the twins decided to stage a revolution.”
Darcy fell into a fit of giggles. "No ya dingbat. Call her up and ask her out. Like..netflix and chill or a movie if you're wholesome."
Stark rose from his chair and walked over to the fireplace. “Sergeant, I have no illusions about getting anything back. I can tell you however, that you can regain anything if you work hard enough, if your smart enough- even if it’s just a scrap of dignity. If only you know where to look.” Stark pressed a button on the mantle and the framed painting above the fire turned to revel a darkened case. With the flip of the switch, the case lit and showed its contents - A metal arm.
“I think we all need to sit down and talk about this. Bucky can't do this alone, I know he thinks he can but I don't think anyone could handle this alone.”
“Mallen's parents were killed in a gunfight with the FBI over weapons violations in Texas. They were some of those off-the-grid types, tinfoil hats included.”
Tony couldn’t work, his brain was going 90 miles an hour thinking about how he could just hand Steve the journal. Finally settled on just sending a bot up to Steve’s floor with the journal so yeah …not the bravest but what can you do. After reading through it himself, it just all seemed too personal. Sure, he and Steve were friends but there was a line that was crossed in those pages. A line that left Tony feeling strange about what sort of relationship had Howard had with Steve. The way it read… well it was ambiguous at best but there was a certain amount of familiarity there that spoke more that friendship and wasn’t that a mind fuck.
It did not take long for Mallen and his merry band of miscreants to end up on the radar of dark authorities. Men like him with blood sodden resumes were hard to come by these days, what with earth’s mightiest heroes and SHIELD back on the scene.
“I’m hungry.”
To make things worse, Barnes realized the electrical shock had fried his com link. By the looks of the armor, he assumed Stark wasn't fairing much better. This was worse than what they had anticipated. “Why the hell is he so damn strong, you said this stuff worked like the serum? Physical perfection is not a fucking fire breathing monster Stark!”
---------------------------------------
"Can you breathe alright?"  Bruce was touching his face now and the doctors hands felt nice and cold.
“Well, you don’t eat enough as it is.”
Stark had seen the research, the nanotechnology's process of redevelopment was a violent one. Extremis essentially broke down the human body and rewrote every system from the ground up in a matter of hours. Once perfected the progression could be even faster. It was violent and messy, a large empty freezer would be the perfect place to be if someone wanted to take it for spin.
Pepper smirked crossing her arms against her silk blouse. “Name five things then that you care about that don’t have anything to do with you.”
Thank god for Pepper, the omega woman was a godsend. She took over most things for Tony so that he could do as he pleased. With in reason of course, the ginger might have been an omega but that did not mean she was a pushover. She showed not only Tony but the board members of SI that she was a force to be reckoned with. Then there was Howard’s old partner Obadiah Stane, he became the puppet master and all Anthony Edward Stark was, was a poster boy with charm and good looks. Sure Tony tinkered in the lab and came up with some genius things for the weapons company.  When he wasn’t half under a skirt or half in a fifth of whiskey Tony could be brilliant. He could be exceptional and charming… the point was he didn’t want to be, because every time showed his face he had to listen to old clients of his fathers gush about how sorry they were about Howard. What shame it was to lose such a great man, funny they never said a word of sympathy for Maria.
Peter jumped up and down “Unca Loki is real funny.” His sister promptly disagreeing and showing her favor toward her Uncle Bucky. This then dissolved into a “nu huh and ya huh” shouting match.
Tony’s hands were so much larger in the armor; Steve hesitated for a moment before resting his own there. The metal articulated gauntlet shifted and curled harmlessly around his fingers.  It seemed…warm in a way, maybe by the energy that flowed just below the surface.
James knew when he made it back to his floor, that something was wrong. The scent lingered out into the hall where there elevator was located - it was familiar but sour. Tinge with fear and loathing.
“Petey, Wendy babies...” Feeling a lump form in his throat as he hit knees and held his children. These are mine, this is whats important. “Where's Papa ?”
The soldier stood there looking down at him pulling a handgun from his belt. He motioned with the gun for his captive to stand.
Even as skilled as she was, this mission didn't require a two of Shields top assassins.
“Cut the crap.” her ginger browns twitched into a V. “Do you have any idea what that little stunt could have cost you?”
Oh if only everyone could mind their p's and qu's though. No this had to end like most things did for him ..humiliation. Later of course Bruce would be comfort and bring ice cream- that mango flavor sherbet that he likes oh! and wavy crisps please!  But for right now Stark's little sprog just had to utter those horrid words.
Omegas are seen as weaker, something to be protected like little dolls. They were usually small and demure, kind and nurturing. Tony remembered his mother had been like that, she was smart enough to hold her own with the old man but she never got the chance. A lot of omega’s had it like that, even if they had an opportunity society made them feel bad about wanting it.
Thanos had been disappointed by the performance of Asgard’s fallen prince, perhaps he didn’t need a noble to seek out domination; perhaps what he needed was a General. One that would incite the rage of Midgard’s heroes and bring them in close before delivering the killing blow.
Steve stood in front of the surveillance monitors, watching as a very different Iron man took on the enemy. Watched the flash of newsreels that depicted Tony Stark as “The Avenger of death” Clad in jet-black armor, as he took no mercy on the battlefield. The dark figure ripping into vehicles, haling out hydra agents, and crushing their skulls. Flying into the air with a screaming man and dropping him to the pavement below.
“I assure you this has nothing to do with a patent; it’s about a very important project your father was involved in during the war.”
Natasha delicately nibbles at a spring roll, “Not my place to put a time table on that, or anyone else for that matter. If you guys want them or not, that's up to you.”
“Entering the building now.” Barnes responded promptly. His tone flat almost mechanical. Something about that always rubbed Phil the wrong way, having worked with Barnes enough to know that the man was far more than the killing machine Hydra had once made him into. Still, he wondered if this part of the Sergeant was simply a way to keep that part of his skill set separate.
I was in big trouble.
Little Peter sat on his knee and looked at him with big glittering honey brown eyes. "Pweety!" The child cheered patting at loki's hair. This wasn't soo bad being complimented on his good looks and rightly so. "Pweety! Pweety Lady!!"
Love is a tightrope of emotions and despite the deathly spiral below – you finds yourself willing to run head long down the narrow way. It is accepting things when your stubborn heart wants no part in it, it’s saying ' I believe in you' when you're terrified.
by Tony to take Loki out of the tower for the day.
Maybe he shouldn't have come when Steve called, maybe he should have known better when he was facing off against people he called friend. Maybe he wouldn't have ended up locked in the RAFT.
The little boy rubbed his eyes; they were puffy and red from crying. Peter had not been sleeping and been extra sensitive since the funeral. Those first few days after, he clung to Tony fearing his daddy would disappear just like his papa.
The asset nodded once.
“Did you honestly thing your pitiful trinkets would equal such a thing as life? No foolish man, I require a life for a life.” She said mater-of-factly.
Bruce stepped up then, “It’s important that you know now so you can think about your options.”
The other men laughed and joked before the stout rough looking one, still with his cigar burning between chapped lips, kicks his feet onto the table. "So then what did you wish for? I know your broke and still ugly as ever so unless it's something we can't see." he paused pointing down with a vulgar wink. "What did you ask for?"
It felt like a sudden pop, like when you sit down in a dark bathroom and fall right in the cold water because someone left the seat up.
Clint and Natasha flank their group of soldiers while Coulson took center.  The archer began targeting the machines and providing cover for his teammates while his assassin counterpart moved swiftly in to finish off stragglers with her bites.
I saw Tony and Steve on the Triskelion
“Grilled cheese sandwiches want one?” Steve said with an easy smile. The morning had been a rough one. Tony had to head out to work on a few projects and make a few meetings. Steve, of course, ushered him out the door with promises that everything would be fine.
"Me Petey!!!" the little one giggles and clapped.
The visit to the Mutant Academy elevated Loki's spirits in a way nothing else had. While it was true there were still no answers that could support him physically he had another answer. Somewhere in all of this sadness and pain there was a single thread of hope. That was a small but precious something that he'd not had until now. A proper direction for his energies to focus upon. A direction that didn't feel like a twisting road into the darkness. In a way...it was a new kind of a sincere hope. A hope Loki wanted to much to cling to because even if his body had failed his mind had not, his heart had not. As withered of a thing as it maybe perhaps it was still worth something. Feasibly he wasn't an awful thing meant to be punished for the deeds of his past. Perhaps, in his penance he could help someone else left alone and lost, another unwanted soul.
"Sweetheart I could never hate you. Is this about you and wade? Peter listen you know that your dad and I would have rather you two waited but we understand."
When he pulled up Steve’s ITunes he expected to find nothing made after 1945, loads of big band and swing. That was not the case, knowing what he knew now however made this easier to understand. Tony wondered if he had seen this before what he would have thought. Maybe he would just have mercilessly teased Rogers for all the Celine Dion and Celtic Woman. Tony flitted his eyes down the lists and spied a collection titled ‘T’ strange name for a play list but knowing Steve he’d probably been trying to type something and then clicked out of it and couldn’t figure out how to change it.
Amora watched the ship sailing through the dark seas. It was a modest craft of wood and copper, the smoke from the engine rose into the night sky from a flue just behind the cabin. The ship itself was second to what else she saw, or perhaps ’who’ would be the better term. The siren noticed the captain of the tiny vessel was a handsome man. His dark hair and eyes gave the man a piercing gaze. The kind of man who thought much and acted swiftly.
Like it made it better to call it 'normal', like it made it fair. All he could think of was how he wasn't prepared, how could he ever become used to this? There were times that he wondered dully if lies would be far better. Sure, there wasn't any of that fancy ' closer' she liked to tell him about.
The inventor looked up from the wall of holograms; it was the new suit design. “Steve was never reckless Pep; he was so by the book that he could have written it and look what it got him. Now if you don’t mind I have a revenge to plot and unlike those catchy proverbs, it actually is better served hot. Piping fucking hot and preferably up the rectal cavity of my enemies.” Tony spun around moving components left and right, the old suits seemed to bulky now; he needed more speed and more silence. He wanted something that was build to kill.
