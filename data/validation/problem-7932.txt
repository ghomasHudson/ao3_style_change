“Let me guess, they disrupted them? Scientists always have fail safes, Steve, for pretty much everything”
“I have my whole city to lose,” Steve answered. “Lives of the innocent.”
“Go ahead, Steve, I’m all ears”, Tony prompted him, letting his pastry at side and licking his lips.
“It’s really him!”
“Nothing much… Nothing exciting is happening, it’s pretty boring without you here.”
He disliked fighting, but there was something about a threat against his home that would trigger it, no matter how much he tried to harness it in his training. He couldn’t imagine the thought of losing everything he had - his friends, family and home - and being surrounded instead by death and desolation. It hurt him.
“Her name is.. Margaret Carter.. usually goes as Peggy..”, he asked the voice.
But Tony looked suddenly horrified. “Your life is not short; you’re a demigod,” he said, his tone serious. “And I’ll keep you safe. That’s what friends do, they protect each other.”
“We’ll do what we must to ensure that nobody else will die in any other universe.”, Steve replied, fists clenched, staring at Tony through the glass. “And if he doesn't listen, we’ll use force, again and again.” Tony’s words echoed in his mind, about what he would do whatever it takes to save their Earth from the incursions. He shook that thought as far away as he could. “This isn't about asking nicely for his consent, Reed. This is about saving his life, in every universe out there.”
“Don’t you want to rest for a bit? We can depart whenever you think it works for you”
“Before Reed found you… he found different version of you from other universes.”, Steve started, giving him some time to process. “According to him, they all fell from the sky, just like you did, but…”, he stopped, lifting the sheets of one of the closest tables. “…not all of them were lucky… in fact, you were the only one who was left alive… and we still don’t know why.”, he explained.
Steve lowered his shield slightly, mulling over Tony’s words. He’d lost his temper. The fact that Tony wouldn’t listen to him was why he resorted to such violent measures but, in truth, that was against what he was taught. He said he wouldn’t spill a drop of blood, and yet he saw the blood stain Tony’s lip, and knew already he had lost the battle which he had started.
“I know how you feel,” Tony said, “that’s exactly how I view certain items in my possession.” He stood on his toes to inspect the helmet carefully. “Does that helmet have a story? What are the wings for?”
“So, what now?”
“You seemed much more of comfort there,” Steve said, plucking grapes off the small branch and popping them into his mouth with a small flick.
Steve wasn't angry. In fact, he wasn't sure what he was feeling. Shocked, confused, scared, guilty. Every corpse that was staring at him was a grave reminder of what he did; he killed Tony Stark. Of course others would insist that it wasn't his fault, that Tony chose to risk his life and stop the impending incursion, but if Steve didn't push him to do it, he would still be alive. It was messed up to think like that, he knew it, of course he was angry and betrayed that his best friend lied behind his back and used him, erasing his memories, what he held close to him, but now he was gone.
The tension started to heat up, and next thing they knew they were arguing hard, yelling at each other. Everyone had something to say, something to use against each other.
“Who are you? Name report and universe of origin?”
His mind immediately went to his friend most likely sitting outside with his girl; maybe Bucky wouldn’t be thrilled to join the fight again, but what if he could help him touch Natasha again with both of his hands? It could really help everyone.
It felt strange to think that Steve and him shared a deeper understanding of each other, that some of their most painful experiences, that they weren’t aware of just yet, were connected. They could help each other, he was sure that he could, but until Steve asked him to take him to Brooklyn, just like he first requested, he was going to be silent about his new adjustment to that world.
Steve looked at him with a hopeful expression. “So you will save my people? You’ll prevent yours from invading?”
Steve gave him a smile, but it wasn't happy in the slightest. A sad smile. That was exactly what Tony needed, but he didn't seem to get anything more these days. “You’ll see.”
Living on his own again hurt a lot. He didn’t trust himself alone with his thoughts, but he needed time to think about his position in the new future he found himself trapped in. That was his first mistake, he had to stop thinking that he was trapped, but try and adjust. Tony was making that process easier for him, and part of him was calling himself a true idiot for declining his offer to stay at the Tower while he made up his mind. The man seemed to have true and humble intentions, he wanted him to be there with him, but Steve turned him down, not wanting to be just another burden. Of course, if he dared to tell Tony that, he would get reassurance and tell him how wrong he was.
“You can use Mr Stark’s name, sir”, he pointed out, making sure that Steve was seated just fine before ordering the suit to start with the soft buzz, the length starting to vibrate itself, starting slowly before picking a faster pace, wanting to give Steve some sort of more control over him.
“Going somewhere, flag man?”, one of them taunted, circling Steve with the rest of his goons following.
Tony nodded, getting back thanks to the other’s help, wearing the Gauntlet and running towards the marked exit, avoiding the rocks that were coming down their way hard and fast.
“I want to promote freedom amongst my people, and yet I’m not free myself,” Steve said, moving to touch one of the silver bracelets that were around his wrists, rubbing at them.
“You blame yourself too much, Athenian. Punishing yourself won’t give you anything. And I doubt your mother wants to see you like that either,” Tony said in a softer tone.
“I have a home”, the blonde said as he straightened his back. “Back in Brooklyn, it was a small apartment but I left it untouched before the war, it must be around..?”
“Since when were the Athenians so blood thirsty?” Tony asked with a snort, spinning the spear in his hand.
“This is Tony Stark, everyone here comes in-”
“Do you think that you’ve won, Tony? That is all over?”, the mutated man spoke in a strong, strangely horrific voice as he hit his giant arms on the ground.
But Tony wasn't willing to let him leave yet. “Prove your people right in what sense exactly?” he replied as he returned the icy cold stare. “And to answer your question, I was willing to accept your offer to help but I wanted something in return."
With another loud cry, he grabbed the spear from the man and stabbed him with it, kicking the body away as he dropped to his knees, letting Steve hold on to him as he scanned the wound with his eyes. His hands trembling as he placed them over the wound, trying putting pressure on it, but his hands only grew bloody in a matter of seconds.
Steve nodded, placing his scripts to one side as he walked over to the table, admiring the large amount of food, especially meat.
“I can see why your people think of me more as a demon than a human,” Tony nodded, less annoyed now and more trying to understand, to learn. “But I can’t let go of something that easily, I have a name to preserve, responsibilities. And if I’m bound to be a demon for eternity, well…”
“I’ve changed. Maybe I want to be remembered for something good for once, not for being responsible for killings across the globe. And no matter if that formula is successful or not, people will die and get hurt, because I would allow it. This is not happening now, so you better accept it, pal”, Tony said, eyes fixed on the older man to show that he meant every single world and that he wasn’t scared of his empty threats.
Tony let out another huff when he could hear Steve, loud and clear, clearly intrigued by what was happening, and he cursed himself internally for not being able to see Steve’s beautiful face at that very moment. He shut his eyes and tried to imagine him instead, trying to comprehend that he and Steve were actually together, so close, after finally confessing their attraction for each other. “Steve...”
“I owe you, son of Ares. I want my people to be safe, that’s why I came here. I said I would teach you to be more human too, is my teaching not enough?”
“Steve, wait!” he called again, standing up, only to be stopped by the blonde who stood in front of him.
Ever since their relationship took a whole different turn and they started spending their nights in Tony’s king size bed, Tony got accustomed to Steve’s nightmares. The first couple of times he pretended that he didn’t notice, and stayed awake until he made sure that Steve’s breath returned to normal. The Captain wasn’t exactly up for talking about the content of them, and Tony didn’t want to pressure him, especially after their first nights together, when Tony was the one that had a horrible nightmare. Steve woke him up, shaking his shoulders, and it was then when he realised that he was shaking, the trembling stopping as soon as Steve pulled him close. He didn’t have to explain, Steve knew that he dreamt about those months in that cave, years ago. After all, he had seen the footage, even if Tony didn’t want him to do so. He didn’t want Steve to treat him differently because of them, but he was pleased when Steve didn’t give him that treatment.
Steve nodded thankfully, waiting patiently for a few moments before there was a knock on the door and Tony returned from the hall with fresh trousers and a dark blue shirt.
“Of course not. I don’t often hide anything from my mother but she mustn’t know of this; she would think I am even more foolish than she thinks I already am for going to Sparta in the first place,” he said, pursing his light pink lips, brushing his hair back behind his ears with his free hand. “The fact that you find killing amusing, however, leaves a lot to be desired.”
“Bucky really didn’t exaggerate, you do look stunning, Ma’am”
“You have to learn how to control this, just adjust the strength, it’s not too hard”, Steve laughed, gesturing at his legs. “Is that..Natasha, was it?”
“I don’t know,” Tony said, shrugging lightly. “Maybe? Maybe it is fate after all. You are drawn to me?”
“I’ll be entertaining the guest in my chambers,” he finally announced to the guards as he nodded to Steve to follow him, walking past the tall pillars and into his inner chambers.
“Look at that boy, Tony, he can barely stand straight, trust me, I’m doing him a favour”, Steve said with a huff as they walked inside the enormous glass elevator. “Besides, I needed to stretch my arms”
“Because you were certain of your people,” Steve said sadly, “I cannot change destiny... And you will lead your army and destroy my home.” He took a couple of steps away from Tony instead, walking over to the corner where his scrolls were resting, kneeling down next to them to pick them up. “You must be proud, Spartan.”
Her voice was dripping poison, and under her mask there was without a doubt the most sadistic smile. There was no guarantee that she would let them go out unharmed if he handed her the artifact, but his options were limited, and to be honest, he didn’t fancy being shot at and left for dead in a random cave in Argentina.
Tony blinked a couple of times when Steve held him, always considering embraces as a way to show genuine appreciation. And he did the same in return, his hands firmly around Steve’s back. “I can try and show you what I know, but you’ll have to help me as well.”
“You can’t trust me. Not right now. So if you come with me back inside, I’ll let you know everything that you want to know. Every answer will be yours, no takeback on that”, Tony explained, offering his hand to the soldier.
“Let’s try that tomorrow”, he suggested.
Steve nuzzled Tony’s cheek. “I would like that,” he said, “but in Athens my only place to rest is within the temple, and I would much rather have our own.”
“Tony.. just let me explain, a break would-“
“Still bitter?” Steve asked.
“Outside..?”
Tony heard his words and couldn’t really reply, what was he going to say anyway when Steve clearly made his point? He had pride, Spartan pride, and if someone didn’t wish for him to be his associate, he wouldn’t plead for it.
“We’re not a team, we’re a time-bomb”, he heard Bruce saying from behind his desk, shaking his head.
“I was.. kidnapped before”, he started saying. “A couple of years back”
“In this instance, I am not following blindly; I know she is looking out for me. Her intentions are to protect me from what plagues those who open their hearts,” he said, and he had never really answered that question until just now.
“I know you will...” Steve said, facing Tony as he stood opposite him, staring into his eyes. He lowered his brightly painted shield, wrapping his arms around the man.
After what it seemed endless hours of agony, Tony having to make sure that ice was untouched and that nobody did anything to get in the way of the Captain’s transfer to the main scientific headquarters of the camp, he was finally gazing upon the Sentinel of Liberty himself, lost amongst the different kinds of equipment, men with masks running around, making calculations, adjusting the temperature of the room as the ice was starting to melt around the frozen soldier.
“Morning”, he greeted Steve with a smile, passing him a coffee mug that got ready for the both of them.
“You really think that? That he didn't do this for me…?”
Steve smiled to the kiss, looking up and noticing the telescope. “Oh, you never showed me what this does,” he said, leading him over. “Where did you get this?”
“Ready to go?”, he asked, and his voice sounded to calm.
“See? He says it himself, he didn’t see me or feel me," the smaller man replied stubbornly, leaving the blonde to frown and turn his gaze to the men in the bed yet again.
“I don’t either, it felt...perfect,” he said, “to trust myself in your hands. And you really looked after me.”
He tracked the sound to the couch, and picked up a couple pillows until he found the phone. He plopped down on the couch and looked at the caller ID. Now it was really weird, if Pepper was calling Jarvis should have automatically put it through, he knew that Tony had been waiting for this call. "He pressed the button, opened his mouth to answer-
The girl, Wanda Maximoff, had stumbled on the part of him that had been affected by Loki's scepter, and apparently it was like an exposed nerve. She hadn't seen what he had, dealing with the Other, but she had seen a weakness to exploit, and now instead of blue eyes, he had red eyes as he was forced to work on Hydra's Serum.
Natasha watched him for a few seconds. "Fatherhood suits you, Stark." Tony looked up at her, frowning a little. "I've seen you before Afghanistan, and you're completely different, you're tamer, not so drunk."
Tony sat on the floor on the side of Mary's bed, tablet balanced against his knees. He let Mary's parents have the two chairs in the room, and Peter had insisted on getting in the bed next to Mary. Tony had helped him find the best spot so that they didn't really jostle Mary's injuries. He reached up, rubbing Peter's leg absently as the boy talked to his Mama. Peter had been really quiet when they first walked in, waiting until he was able to get settled on the bed, then started talking, little tears at first.
“I think circumstances were a little different,” Steve told him, grabbing a little bowl of applesauce. He was going to see if he couldn’t get Jamie to finish it.
But, the way Tony was feeling, the empty feeling in his stomach, the pounding in his head, the shaking in his hands, it wasn't alcohol induced. He hadn't had anything to drink last night, or even the night before. He'd had a lot of coffee that morning, working down in the workshop, but he was pretty sure that wasn't what had sent him careening for the toilet.
Wait. Allergies. Pepper was allergic to something.... Some fruit, right? Pepper had asked Jarvis to keep an emergency supply of Epipens in the house, just in case. Where were they??
"I don't think he will, think about where he took Peter." Coulson smiled. He had given valuable knowledge to the Smithsonian for the exhibit and had already gotten a private tour. He knew that Peter would love it, and subsequently Tony. "It anything, we might be sitting there for a couple more hours," he chuckled.
"Tony, what's going on?" Steve asked again.
"We have an accord then." Loki smirked as a breeze shifted through the garage. Tony felt a shiver run down his back and he closed his eyes. "Thor, you have already called for the Arbiter, yes?"
Was Tony not happy with the way she was? Would he try to evolve her as well? She hoped not. Steve had promised to never force her to evolve if she didn’t want too.
"It's not going to replace any of your pencils, just pens, but also markers." Tony moved to stand next to him, pointing at the pen as he went. "The tip is retractable, but it also has several different settings. Ball-point, fine-tip, broad, flat, round, even a calligraphy setting. There are over five-hundred different colors programmed into it, so you can get everything just right. Really, it pretty much works off of an advanced color wheel. But, for those rare moments when you just can find the right color, you can make your own."
"But a lot of information was still lost during the war, and that's the time period that he's from." She wiggled her nose a little. "If I make up a plan, will you look it over, and promise that it won't get shot down right away?"
“Oh, is it?” Tony chuckled. “Are you sick of the public appearances already?”
So why did Tony feel so damn lonely in his Tower?
"He may surprise you."
"Yeah," Tony said quietly. This man reminded Steve of the man he talked down from an anxiety attack last year. "I'll see you both soon, everything is set up. Peter will be happy to have you both here." Mary's Dad said his farewells and Tony hung up the phone, grabbing it, and just gripped it in his hand for a second. Steve felt like he was intruding suddenly.
“I don’t teach self-defense,” Bucky said.
Tony’s faceplate dropped and Jarvis brought up something on the HUD, Steve’s voice washing out a bit. “Sir, I’ve detected an impact on the window surface of the eighty-third floor.” Tony frowned, watching the security footage pop up. He could just catch something hit the window, then bounce off, like someone had thrown a rock. Jarvis sped up the footage to play live and they saw something hit again.
"A lot of things are always on my mind." He peeked his eyes open to see the very unamused look Tony was giving him.
"Not even by the first name?" Tony said in an exaggerated, shocked, gasp. "I'm mortified, Agent."
“Shut up, Barton,” Steve hissed, frowning as he watched Tony. Hazel eyes moved, too quickly to be normal, looking at Clint as he got closer to Tony.
Tony held Peter in his arms as they walked through the halls of the hospital, thinking to himself that this was the absolute oldest that Peter could be while being held. Tony wasn't weak, not by far, and Peter was still small compared to other kids his age, but he was almost eight and he was a lot bigger than he was at four.
“I’m not showing off my butt for everyone here,” Steve told him, hands back to on his hips.
“I can’t, Tony,” Steve said with a chuckle. “I’m debriefing with Coulson’s team in twenty, and then I have to meet with someone from PR about getting on top of the Captain America reveal.”
"My radio's on, Sir," she told him, nodding. She knew that Fury wouldn't tell her sit out just because Coulson was sweet on her, or because she had a son; he knew that she was as good as, if not better, than most of the SHIELD agents he had.
There was a silence, after a couple of moments, and Thor was speaking softly with the Arbiter. When Tony was sure she was gone, he pushed himself up, confident his legs would hold him up, and walked over to Loki's little prison.
Tony pulled a couple things from the bag on the floor of the backseat of the car, Peter watching with interest. They were sitting in the parking garage by the Smithsonian Museum, getting ready to go inside. Mary had went to DC early, Coulson had wanted to meet with her quickly, and Tony said they would meet up her after he got his time with Peter, like he told her before she moved.
Tony hurried down to the door that would lead to his workshop, Jarvis letting the door swing open for him. The workshop was safe, it was familiar. As he stepped inside, his robots rolled over to him, being careful when they saw that he was holding Peter still. He motioned to the couch that sat in the back, and the robots rolled over, pulling the blankets off with claws, trying to rearrange pillows for him. This was safe, this was familiar.
.' She stood up, looking for him now, forgetting that she playing into the scene. "Then you're off your chair, in one exquisite movement, wondering, searching, sniffing the wind like a dapple deer." Mary noticed that Phil was dancing with her mother on the dance floor, a little familiar smirk on his lips. He had even helped! Mary decided to go with it, moving towards the dance floor, other couples still there.
Tony shook his head and pulled out the chair with Peter's booster seat. He was smaller than other six-year olds, just like Tony had been, but he was almost done with the booster seat. Peter climbed up into the chair and Tony pushed it back in, taking a seat next to him, Steve sitting across from them. Tony bit back the little smile he felt twitching at his lips, and instead took a big bite of his food. He should not feel this okay with such a domestic scene. It was just the stress of the past week, and the fact that he hadn't really slept. That was it.
"These guys come from legends, they're basically Gods." Steve snorted a little at her words, grabbing his shield and securing it to his arm.
"Mama! Help me, Mama!" He wiggled around, giggling, reaching out for Mary.
"It doesn't change the fact that all of this was hidden from me," Steve argued, frowning at her.
"Steve?" He looked up to see Coulson at the door, tablet in hand. He nodded with his head and Steve nodded.
"Where's Mama?" Peter asked, looking around the room, waving at Coulson who was sitting down. Phil smiled at him, giving a wave back.
"I think I'd like that," Julie said with a nod. "I think it would make me feel a bit safer."
"Outside help?"
"Tony?" Steve asked quietly, and Tony grunted in response. "Is it true?"
"Little funny," Steve said with an easy smile. Tony rubbed at his chest a little, feeling a bloom of warmth.
Unbeta'd, and Marvel owns more of this than I do. Also, all music/movies/tv shows belongs to those that wrote/performed/produced/etc them. I use them for humor and good times.
"Mr Odinson is still downstairs with Mr Loki. They have not moved all day."
“Speaking of the new kitchen,” Steve quickly grabbed a rag to try and grab the dollop of applesauce that was falling from the spoon, and missing. Tony made a face when he felt the room temperature food hit his leg. “I thought you said that the Penthouse was only going to be two floors.”
“He says with confidence,” Steve said with a smile. “It’ll be good to get out of here, Buck. In fact, let’s escape them now.”
A deep sonic pulse traveled through the air, and Tony gasped as it passed through him. His hands shot to his chest, the red liquid seeping through his shirt, trying to merge with his arc reactor. It was too much, it was power, it was weak and yet strong, and it needed a place, needed a body, needed a
"Don't go turning into my Ma," Bucky warned.
"No," Steve shook his head. "You might have been over-compensating for something you didn't get enough of as a child, but everyone else who's moved in has had the option to say no. If anyone thought that it would be detrimental to Peter, Mary and Phil, or Rachel and William, wouldn't have moved in." Steve reached over to steal one of Tony's fries now. "You're right, mine are better."
"I'm sure I'll welcome the distraction later when Mary's Mom decides that I'm in open season again," Tony muttered.
Tony looked at the guest room, leaning against the door jamb, taking in the current decor and layout. It was right by his room, the Master Bedroom.
“She is his clone,” Coulson answered, a little amusement in his voice. “There’s a good bet that he was a little like this.”
"I need to hear those reasons," she prompted. There was a bit of silence, but she could hear things being moved around in the workshop. She knew when Tony was in his workshop when they talked on the phone. "What did I tell you last week, Tony?"
Tony saw Julie watching Steve now, and figured that this is what he must not have told her. "He got the order saying that his parental rights had been terminated, and he wasn't happy about it." Steve had gone back to get the rest of the information from Bucky after bringing Wade back down to his mother. "Apparently he's been keeping an eye on them, and he's seen you coming around, too." Tony raised an eyebrow when Steve looked at him with the last sentence.
"Key!" Tony shouted, and Loki smirked a tiny bit. Tony never looked away from Loki. "You'll wake her up-"
"Still sore, but I didn't bump it while I was sleeping this time," he stated, watching Steve go through his morning ritual. He combed his hair through first, then started to brush his teeth. Tony still felt a little rush of giddiness when he saw Steve's toothbrush next to his own, and vice-versa down in Steve's bathroom. "Took a pain killer, non-narcotic," he added when Steve side-glanced him. "I should be good to go for the rest of the day."
"You practically gave me the SKU number, Tony," Rhodey rolled his eyes good naturedly.
"-to know there was someone there? You said that he wasn't Hydra." That was Meg. He inched in slowly.
"So, not a social call, then," Tony said, then shrugged.
Loki was sitting, and he had a new accessory, something over his mouth, that actually looked a little painful. If the glare he leveled at Thor was anything to go by, it must have been. Steve had walked in as well, and frowned a little when he saw the mouth piece. "Is that necessary?" Steve asked, glancing between Thor and Fury.
“Papa.” Jamie parroted dutifully.
"And where is your seat, young man?" Rachel asked her grandson with a smile.
"By brooding?" She asked, tilting her head at him a little.
"Are they Doctor's like Uncle Bruce?"
“Don’t ruin it,” Tony said with a wave of his hand, looking back down at Jamie. “Yes, Aunt Meg has good ideas sometimes, but she just needs to let Daddy have the glory. Because Daddy is amazing. Daddy.”
"An ant has no quarrel with a boot." Looking up she could see the ceiling starting to chip, no, it was more than that, but the structural integrity was being compromised.
Tony stopped at the doorway to Peter's room and looked in. He pushed down the images from his nightmare, and watched the boy sleep. The reassuring rise and fall of his chest was mesmerizing to him right now. Peter was there, in his,
“Yeah, that thing, with the not doing it online.”
“I think maybe we need it a little longer than that,” Steve commented, feeling Tony tense a little. “You’re starting to look like a raccoon, baby. It’s not a terribly attractive look if that’s not what you’re aiming for.”
"Did you tell him about Peter?" Steve asked. Tony turned his head a little to look at the man.
“You need rest more, and you also need to be able to have the attention span to give to your family, and those Avengers call-outs.” Tony gave her an unamused look. “We both know that you can run on low batteries for a while, but eventually those give out. Usually at the most unexpected time.”
The door beeped once, sliding open. "Tony." He paused at the door, not turning around. It was William, not Steve. Tony walked inside the workshop, then held the door open for Mary's father to follow him. He took the invitation, the door sliding closed behind them. Tony practically collapsed on the couch, burying his face in his hands.
"Wouldn't miss it for the world, kiddo," Steve told him with a smile.
"Always a way out," Steve let out a little chuckle. "You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be someone else's hero."
Julie was holding onto baby Rowan, while Rachel was cooing over baby Conor in her arms. Mary stood between them, glancing down the road. "You three look like you're about to spring a trap," Tony said as he walked over to them. "Dangerous."
Surprisingly though, Tony hadn't had a lot of interaction with The Neighbor. Maybe because it was winter? Maybe because SHIELD was actually using the man for missions now? Tony wasn't sure, but he rarely saw him when picking up and or dropping of Peter now, and never saw him outside the apartment building either. When Tony mentioned the sidewalks and parking lot being cleared of snow, Mary had mentioned that Steve woke up early on those days to get the sidewalks for everyone, before continuing his crazy need to go for a morning run. Tony would deny it until he was blue in the face that he didn't spend any extra time thinking about The Neighbor. Good thing he stay in his lovely state of denial.
"Deflect, Jarvis," Tony said. "I-"
“Indeed. And it seems that you have ended up in front of me, needing my help.”
Phil ran a hand through Peter's hair, Tony distantly thinking, again, that Peter needed a trim, and the boy stopped before he could start rambling. Just like a Stark.
"A birthday present from you, Mr Stark," she smirked back at him. "Everything looks beautiful. The chairs are going up outside as we speak."
"Your birthday is coming up," Peter said, pulling him back from his thoughts. "Are we going to have a party?"
“You look good in them, really good.” Tony smirked at Steve’s admission as he sat down next to him. “Unfairly good.” Tony snorted softly. “I never knew that you had prescriptions, but why make the change now?”
“You seem less stressed now,” Steve told him, rubbing of his calves with his hand.
“Did you really think that Wade would be able to keep his mouth shut about anything?” Tony questioned. “Not when he’s excited about something at least. And apparently trying to get Peter in on it, too.”
Tony took a couple of silent breaths as they approached the podium, all the reporters and cameras having finished set-up. They were all standing, while all the occupants inside had chairs, benches, and cots to sit in. They seemed unaffected by the press conference about to happen, and eyed Tony, Steve, and Pepper as they walked through, curious.
"No one said that it was going to stop, but it can get easier to deal with," Steve continued. He stepped in front of Tony to block his path to the elevator. "Coping mechanisms, and talking-"
"Because you're so far from being right, it's almost laughable," Bruce said as he got up from his chair. He grabbed peter's plate, earning a bright smile and a
Her jaw dropped a little. "You have a prototype from Tony Stark himself? How did you manage that, and can I get in on this??" Steve chuckled and let a little smile turn his lips up when he saw another song pop up in his playlist. "That's a smile of familiarity. Do you work with him??"
"Yeah," Tony nodded, and watched Peter. "I knew that might happen." Steve saw the weariness in Tony then, saw how it weighed on him. The two of them had basically been keeping up a long distance relationship for the past four months, with visits as much as Steve could keep up, and then everything sort of metaphorically, and literally, blew up. Tony had been kidnapped, and as soon as he got home there was the prospect of a baby to take care of and keep safe, and Peter coming home. Tony had barely slept, and Steve had recognized that a nightmare had woken him up that morning, not aware of it until just moments before it was too late, and he still wasn't able to relax. How Tony was keeping it all together at this moment was beyond Steve.
“Trying to seduce me, Captain?” The elevator doors opened and Tony quickly ducked down, sliding around Steve to jog out of the cart. “It won’t work!”
“If my math is right, which sometimes it isn’t,” Danielle said with a smirk, having heard him use the phrase before, “you’ve already been working on, physically, another thirty-two suits. How do you have room at the smaller Malibu location for all of them?”
"Tony?" Tony blinked when he heard Mary's voice again, and remembered that she had asked him a question.
"Yeah, yeah," Tony said waving his hand, unable to talk without his hands even over the phone. "Shoot me a call once you're all settled, or if you run into any trouble. I'll get that little spitfire of a kid over to see you after that." She thanked him again and the line disconnected.
“You can’t talk yet, though,” Peter said. “Because you don’t get to call Mr Steve anything other than Mr Steve, not yet. You’re lucky to get to call Daddy your Daddy, too, and I’m doing you a big favor by letting you have him.” Steve bit his lip. “And I get to keep my art lessons, cause Mr Steve is the best, and that’s all mine.”
"Peter," Steve put a hand on the boys arm, and he looked up with big eyes.
"Lots of positive attention," Tony agreed. "And now he's something that takes some of that away," he said with a little scrunch to his features. "It's either going to go surprisingly well, or be a tremendous disaster, and I'm hoping for something in the middle." Tony caught Steve's look. "He's an extraordinary kid, well behaved, but he can have an epic tantrum if he wants. I've only seen it a couple of times, but I'd rather it not happen at all. Maybe I spoiled him with too much? Bringing his family and friends here?"
Three days after the press conference, Tony collapsed face first on his mattress. It was late, and Jarvis had locked him out of his workshop for the rest of the night. Steve had insisted on actually going out now, with the rest of the Avengers, sans Bruce, to help in the city. He said he was still going to help Tony with the Tower, but they would be able to help more with removing left over alien corpses, and rubble and debris. One good thing about all the extra work was that he could keep avoiding the talking thing with Steve. Once Tony got home he would immediately find Peter, and Wade most of the time, and spend time with him. When the boys were asleep, Tony would sneak downstairs to the workshop to put in some work into the Tower re-model.
"Not a fan of dancing?" Tony heard himself asking.
"I will let you get another hour or so of sleep, before Peter wakes up, and we'll talk soon," Tony said, feeling his ability to socialize with other humans starting to dwindle.
"What I did was personal, and had nothing to do with SHIELD," Mary re-iterated, a bit softer and kinder this time. "People make mistakes, but I stand by my actions." Steve still held respect for her; at least she stood by her decisions. "Whatever your personal thoughts about Tony, as a Stark, are, are yours to keep and work out." Steve nodded. He had a lot of new thoughts about Tony.
Steve put two glasses of juice down in front of Father and Son, and couldn't help but smile. It was just he and Bruce in the kitchen at the moment, and Steve knew that Tony felt comfortable enough to let go in front of them, to not have to put on a mask. He was slightly amazed at the quick change though, the man that was lost in his mind in the bedroom, and the father out here that acted like nothing was more important than making Peter smile. It was now Steve's mission to make sure that Tony's birthday stayed this way.
"Will you?" Steve looked at him. "Try to sleep, that is?" He ran his thumb softly under one of Tony's eyes. "Much longer and it's going to look like you got into a bad fist fight."
"Where the hell is Thor? He needs to wrangle his crazy little brother." Loki sneered a little, but smirked a little at Jarvis's response.
His hands stopped, a small gasp coming from his lips when Steve's fingers traced the skin around the arc reactor. The crisscrossing of scars around the modification that had once been too sensitive, always covered, then dulled by the palladium poisoning. It seemed the new element had brought feeling back once against to the area, and Tony was pressing his head back into the mattress as Steve explored the skin there, careful to not touch the reactor itself. Bright flashes erupted as the sensation raced through Tony's nerve endings.
“I trust you that you won’t try and murder me in my sleep and run off with my savings, if that’s what you’re implying”, Tony shrugged. “Besides, we could use some trust around here, especially you. You need someone you can trust in this world, right? And I’ll gladly be that person”
“How many times do I have to tell you to call me Bucky?”, he frowned, giving Steve a nudge on his shoulder with his good hand.
Tony stood up again and started to dress up, fixing his tunic, noticing how Steve seemed to look at his general direction.  “You’re not, don’t worry about that,” he reassured him.
“Don’t you think that this feels like… a kidnapping…?”, he asked.
“Breaking news! Well known industrialist billionaire Tony Stark has been missing from his privates quarters in New York earlier this morning. Personal assistant Pepper Potts says that signs of struggle were observed in the scene, and police forces are doing their hardest to invest a case of kidnapping, similar to the events of two years ago”, she said.
Reed was quiet, taking in every little clue that they might have gotten, even though in typical super villain logic, he was sure that Kang would reveal his oh so great master plan soon enough.
Steve nodded and handed him the brush, lightly taking his wrist to help guide him. “Like this...”
Turning his back to him, he headed outside the room, locking it behind him. He had to do this, Tony forced his hand, it was for his own good, he kept repeating to himself. He avoided looking at the anger in Tony’s eyes; it was better to be hated by him rather than seeing another corpse join the ones already in the morgue. It was time for him to pay a price; to be hated by someone who he loved… did he really think of that? That he loved Tony…? He shook his head again. This wasn’t the time to question his possible feelings for someone who wasn't even alive any more; he really had to stop doing that, it would hurt less more, but it seemed that he never, ever learnt.
Steve walked up to him. “I had to leave very early to walk to Thebes,” he said. “I suppose I am tired.”
Tony rubbed his head, thinking about the question. “It might not be the same to others, but that’s how I express gratitude towards you,” he said.
But for now, he wanted to give Steve some space, he dragged him into this crazy Stane business when they had just left the cemetery. Tony didn’t know who Peggy was, but asking Jarvis made him well aware. He knew how it felt losing a lover, someone who he could possible consider a life partner. Rumiko Fujkawa was for Tony exactly that, but she was taken away from him in the worst possible way. Herself being the heir of one of the biggest Japanese companies in the market and Tony Stark’s girlfriend sure made her a target for the Yakuza, and while Tony was taken away, tortured in Vietnam, she was assassinated on her way to America, to learn more about her boyfriend’s abduction. After Tony was released, there was one person he wanted to see, and that was Rumiko, and to be told that she was buried away in Japan was the most devastating thing he heard in his entire life. Months of alcohol dependence came by until he was able to stand on his own feet again and move the expeditions outside New York for the search of new energy resources. Yes, he experience the heartache that Steve did before, and he knew how it felt, he was able to feel and understand what was going through his mind when he stood by Peggy’s tombstone and holding his hand was an act of impulse, something that he would like to have happened when he was standing in front of Rumiko’s own shrine and mourning her passing.
“Don’t worry, I’m used to being up early for training and school," Tony reassured him, rubbing his eyes. “How was sleeping in a Spartan bed?”
They eventually started to get along, and much to Tony’s dismay, his father seemed to be a common subject to discuss. Steve was a clever man, he picked up how uncomfortable that topic seemed to make Tony, and Tony was grateful when Steve dropped his father as a conversation starter.
“Excuse me; I thought I did, my mistake," Tony replied, knowing well from experience that Steve wouldn’t would want the excuse, walking fast to keep up with him. “So… do you have any business back in Athens?”
“I only came here once, you know.”, Steve broke the silence, his eyes fixed on the tombstone and the flowers around it, refusing to look up. “During the funeral… I couldn't say anything to him when we were left alone…”
“That would be me”, a female voice was heard as the elevator closed, a tall, elegant red haired woman walked in, her heels echoing in the large room. “Pepper Potts, Mr. Stark’s personal assistant. You must be..”, she said, looking at Tony while her hand was extended to Steve. “Mr. Rogers..?”
He was scared of being picked on, especially by someone who had such a sharp tongue. As a child, he was picked on. Not directly, but he'd been isolated because he was clearly different, not only in appearance due to his straight long hair and pale skin, but because he was a demigod.
Tony smiled to him and looked straight back into his eyes, grateful for the company now that the Athenian, of all people, was by his side.
“Right. Someone ignored my phonecall...”
“His name is Nathaniel Richards. He caused us so much trouble in the past; being able to travel through time and taking anyone he wishes with him can be catastrophic. We ended up in so many different timelines trying to fight our way back to our own when he faced him before. He joined the Council of Kangs after a couple of times that we defeated him; they have more power when they’re together, and we can clearly witness this right now…”
“Please, don’t let it be too late...”
The men were confused, looking around for the exit, the walls and ground shaking, rocks falling down and taking out a few of them.
"Peter won't be back until dinner time tomorrow, and I've got no alcohol in the penthouse." Tony held up the glass again before taking another drink. "It would just be a shame to let this leftover champagne go to waste."
"Didn't help that most of the tourist sights had been hit by bombs or gun-fire," Steve added. "I was pretty noticeable in my uniform back then anyway."
"Even after getting your new build?" Tony said with a motion to his body. "You've got some hidden grace and footwork in there, I've seen it."
"Yeah," Steve said with a nod. "But I don't really know much about blueprints, and specially the ones that Tony uses. You have your own floor?"
“He’s just extra happy that he gets pancakes on a non-Saturday day,” Tony said as the trio went to the dining table.
"True facts, my young friend. Alright, so who am I then? What color lightsaber do I get?" Tony rubbed his hands together. Jamie had been watching him, and she looked at Steve, clapping her hands together once, and trying to imitate Tony. Steve took her hand and rubbed them together a little to make her giggle.
"I've contacted Dr Banner," Jarvis spoke up helpfully. "He is on his way."
Hai there! Crazy world, huh??  I was just want to say that you're all amazing, sticking around as long as you have! I really appreciate it, I love seeing it, and I'm glad that I can bring something that so many people like. I hope this doesn't disappoint! Here's the chapter that's going to set up the next big installment of the Proof series! I'm starting to feel like Disney+ with all my little plots all over.
“There’s an outside pool, and an inside pool,” Peter said to Steve as the older man stared out the window. “And Daddy has a path that goes right down to the water, to a secret beach.” Peter was looking over Steve’s shoulder as they came up to the front, the large statue sitting in the round-a-bout.
"He's still excited to be home," Steve told him as they went to rejoin the group. "You'll see." Somehow that managed to pull a smile from Tony.
"Sir did some quick thinking to remember that Miss Potts keeps extra Epipens around the mansion," Jarvis informed Mary, and Tony almost wanted to facepalm as Mary's eyes widened a little. "He then got his personal physician to the mansion."
"Alright, let's go." Tony smiled at him, smothering his face in messy kisses, making the little boy squeal and giggle.
"Am I interrupting?" She asked quietly, and Steve shook his head.
“Dr Banner gave me some pain medication not too long ago, and I think it just kind of fuels my imagination.” She preened a bit, batting her eyes at him. “Oh what am I doing? That does nothing for you. Need to get some guy with amazing lashes in here.”
"Mr Stark, are you gay?" Tony almost laughed at the question.
“But, what if-“
"He'll worry, for sure," she agreed.
"Thanks for taking one for the team," Coulson said with a little smirk.
“They wouldn’t open for me for years,” Howard said. Evelyn almost growled at him, her little body giving a full body shake once, like a bad shiver.
“And you’re volunteering, Sir?”
"Because I promised," Tony repeated, whispering in Peter's hair. Jarvis responded for in the affirmative. Coulson would be there in ten minutes to take Peter to the Hellicarrier, while Iron Man would make a straight shot for Germany.
"Wow," Steve breathed out, looking over everything.
"Jarvis?" Tony asked, hearing everything power up. "Are you there?"
Steve smiled at him. "Jamie Antonia Rogers." Tony's eyes widened a little. "Well, she wouldn't be here if it weren't for her Daddy." He wrapped his arms around Steve's neck, pressing his forehead against Steve's.
"You didn't get a blanket," Tony said absently, not looking at him. Steve blinked a little; he had completely forgotten around it. Tony kicked his legs out, lying across Steve's lap, and his feet pushed the blanket out with them so that it covered Steve's legs. "Alright, everyone settled in? Good? Good. Let's start this thing!"
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath before reading anymore. Howard had been testing him as a child, had been cultivating his talent? The pages made it sound like his father had been working with Arnim Zola, the man who had helped the Red Skull. But why?
"It's getting worse."
“If that’s something that would make you feel more comfortable, then I can help you pick someone.” She leaned forward a little, and Tony felt himself relaxing just a tiny bit. She was the least intimidating woman he had ever met, and it was throwing him off. “The most important part of coming to the sessions if that you feel comfortable. This will be a safe space for you, Mr Stark, and I won’t be in the least bit offended if you prefer a male professional to a female one.”
“You sure? There’s a lot of traffic around, we’re probably at least forty minutes from the Tower with no traffic,” Tony said, stopping by the door.
"Yeah, yeah," he waved her hands off, but caught one of them. "I know. After he sang to me," Mary raised her eyebrows, "I had to tell him I loved him, too. I told you, just sweet on a whole other level. I actually think he's trying to make me the woman in the relationship." Mary smacked his arm and he chuckled. "Now, I'm a Daddy to someone else, and all I can think about, when I'm thinking about that, is, am I gonna screw up?"
“Implants?” Rhodey asked with a curious eyebrow.
Tony shook his head, taking one of the baskets from Steve. “Nothing big, I’ll tell you about it back at the hotel.” Tony wasn’t sure what Steve would think about it, wasn’t sure if he would be ready to not only come out publicly, but also come out publicly as in a relationship with Tony Stark. “Some people are starting to guess that it’s me, and they’re taking pictures. Low key, no mainstream yet. There are some adorable pictures out there though that I have to show you.” Steve glanced at him as they put all the stuff on the counter to ring up, Peter hanging on to the edge. “I’ve already got Pepper taking down anything with Jamie in the pictures, just in case.”
"The Stark Tower?" Is that what Bruce was talking about? "That big, ugly," Tony turned his head towards him to glower, "building in New York?"
“Fuckin’ menace.” Tony punched Steve’s arm.
"Jarvis, lights," Tony murmured, pushing himself up. He was in sweat pants, but pulled off his t-shirt that was drenched in sweat now. As he pulled on a new shirt, he slipped on his shoes, heading down to the workshop, snapping the bracelets the entire way down. Maybe he could get the punching bags up before Steve woke up, surprise him at his next workout.
“I’m noticing that a lot of the food here is easy to make,” Tony called out from the kitchen. “Lots of snacks, too. Last time I saw stuff like this,” he paused a bit and Steve walked to the entrance of the kitchen. Tony looked at Steve with a knowing smirk. “Well, I think I have an idea of what you have planned.”
Songs played by Tony on the piano -
"Do we have any other leads?" Steve looked up at the two spies. They were temporarily distracted when Bruce came in the room, immediately taking a seat next to Tony. Tony heard Steve start his conversation up again, but Bruce was shoving his tablet into Tony's hands.
Steve reached over and put his hand on Tony's arm, nodding to him. "I'd do it again, without hesitation."
Let me here your thoughts! Leave it here in the comments, or if you want to write more, or start a conversation, I have an email for that! Just for all of you! MegaraNoelleWrites@gmail.com
“So far, just some pictures floating around Twitter mostly,” Pepper told him. He pulled away the phone, putting it on speaker as he stepped into a corner, out of the way of other shoppers, but still able to see his family. His chest warmed at the thought. Jarvis pulled up several social media sights, bring Twitter up front. “Random people snapping pictures, not sure if it’s really you or not.”
"And I'm gonna be a bad-ass-" Wade started.
Tony thought he felt his lower lip tremble a little, but he swiped a hand across his face. "Thank you, Rachel," he said after a second. "I, I really needed to hear that."
"Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in." The man just did what he wanted, whenever he wanted. And he left Peter alone. Did Peter even know about Mary yet?
“You think he will?” Mary asked him. “Get triggered, that is.”
As he spit out the last of the toothpaste he heard his AI pipe up. "I would recommend a blood test, Sir." Tony frowned a little at the suggestion. "With my limited scanning, I can find no foreign substances that would cause you to be sick."
Tony leaned over, dropping a kiss on top of Peter's head as little hands grabbed at the sleeves on his arm. He had made the doctor check over Peter first, to make sure there was nothing wrong him before letting the Doctor tend to Tony himself. He knew that Steve wasn't too far away, getting his own injuries treated, even though they all knew that he would be healed by days end because of the Super Soldier serum.
He sighed and sat up a little straighter. “You know, it partially has to do with the nightmares. But, I didn’t lie, I’m not having those again. Rather, I’m not having the living nightmares.” He put his glasses back on, the lenses darkening slightly into sunglasses, something for him to hide behind. “I still have nightmares of Those nightmares, does that make any sense?” Danielle hummed, nodding, giving him her full attention.
“Traitor,” Tony mumbled, slouching a bit in his seat. “Alright, what happened after Star Wars,” Tony asked Peter and Wade, turning back to them. “Did you get to the castle?”
“Babe,” Tony murmured, a small smile on his face. “I know that this feels wrong coming from my mouth, and that really, you should be saying this too me-“
"Finding a barber is less of a priority when you're traveling the world," Bruce said, smiling a little when Tony let go. "I do have half a mind to let you die to heavy metal poisoning now, though." Tony frowned at him, and Bruce raised an eyebrow. "The SHIELD Agent that picked me up?"
“This doesn’t feel very-“
"Yeah, exactly." He sighed a little. "I'm handling that, got a routine down, after how many years? Now, let's throw in another child, a baby, one that I almost-" Tony took a breath. "They wanted me to experiment on that girl, that baby out there learning how to crawl. They were going to make her into a weapon, and they were going to make me do it." His eyes trailed down the hall a little, words echoing through his mind. "What right do I have to her? Just another life to screw up with a past that won't seem to leave me alone."
Peter was running to the door to open it as Steve stepped out, Jamie on his hip. “Hi, Miss Meg!” He heard Peter call out and smiled a little. As he got closer he saw Peter looking up at Bucky, who was meeting his gaze right back. Steve knew that Peter could get shy, but he wasn’t acting that way now. Steve thought it was a curious reaction. “You must be Mr Steve’s friend.” Bucky let out a little grunt and nodded.
If Tony had thought that there would have been another way, to fix the engine, to stop the attack, and to keep Peter with him, he would have done it. Anything to stop the pain that he felt when he heard Fury's voice. "Coulson is down."
"I do," Steve nodded again. He reached to grab some plastic wrap for the lasagna and cookies. "By choice, before you ask that as well."
"Daddy," he exclaimed, sleep still in his voice. "Still here."
“Mr Steve! You’re back!” Steve grinned at the voice of Peter, calling out as he and Tony emerged from a hallway, the boy on his Daddy’s back, arms wrapped around Tony’s neck. Steve noted that Tony looked a little lighter, a smile on his face, and looked like he may have gotten some sleep recently.
"Okay!" Both boys grinned, making themselves comfortable on the big bed. Tony nodded to Coulson and left the room, closing the door most of the way, hearing the excited voices of Peter and Wade talking immediately.
“Jolteon,” it chirped out, looking around. “Jolty.” Tony grinned as he watched Vee talk to their newest addition, then looked over as he heard another crack. The black egg was going to be next.
The man chuckled a bit, never moving the gun, or his eyes. "And go into the monologue where you learn about our plan? While I'm sure that you'll probably die, one way or another, I'm not going to take that chance."
"Ah," she nodded a little, understanding now. "Cars have come a long way, engineering has advanced probably faster than you could have imagined." Mary knew that Tony would probably be able to help Steve understand a lot of what's changed, but she wasn't sure that it would be a very good idea. Coulson had given her the history lesson on Captain America, (better than what the files had said), and she knew that he had known Tony's father. And Tony's father was a taboo subject with him, so these two meeting at the moment probably wasn't a good idea on several levels.
"You little-" Tony laughed, trying to grab onto his son before he ran over to join Wade in their dance around Steve. "I think it was a tie!"
“Um,” he ran his eyes through the papers before answering. “Tony, call me Tony. Mr Stark was my Dad, Anthony was what my mom called me.” He signed the papers he needed too before slipping the papers back over to her. “You’re willing to take me on as a client?” Danielle looked up, and interested look on her face. “I’m Tony Stark. I have a whole slew of problems, and those are the ones that don’t touch the reasons on why I’m Iron Man. And I am Iron Man, I’m an Avenger, and I get call outs often.”
"When we had this conversation, I was expecting a lot more blushing coming from you, Cap." Steve raised an eyebrow at Tony. "I thought I was going to be dealing with a lot of Forties morality, and all that.
“Sorry,” Steve stuttered out between breaths, still laughing. “I just- You were so committed to the look! Full points, seriously.” He grinned, giggling, and leaned in to kiss Tony, tugging on his lip a little with his teeth. Jamie made a noise and pushed at their faces. Tony rolled his eyes and kissed Jamie’s nose. “Alright, alright, let’s go watch a movie before Peter hunts us down.”
," he heard Steve's voice whisper, but the man in front of him was dead.
"The grandparents are Hydra, too." Steve put his hand to his ear, turning the comm unit back on, and Bucky was grabbing his wrist. "Have someone waiting outside the house." Then he was out of the room.
"Yeah, you know me, I keep strange hours," Tony murmured, before standing up again. He saw Steve's bright blue eyes looking at him and Tony had to bite the inside of his cheek. "I tried to sleep again and had a nightmare," Tony confessed. "What are you doing awake so early? Because this is early even for you."
Virginia "Pepper" Potts had called him after 10am, (still too early in his book), saying that he had an appointment, and it wasn't something that she could field for him. Pepper managed to trick him into getting there ten minutes early, telling him the appointment was an hour earlier than it actually was. She was starting to know him too well, maybe he should start thinking about hiring a new PA.
"Get to the parking lot, run there. Now." Tony said, trying to keep his voice as calm as possible for her. "Jarvis, first car that you can lock on to, unlock it, start it, and get her into it." The AI confirmed, showing Tony which car he had triggered on the screen. Back on the camera feed, Tony could see that the two women were up and had fired their guns up into the air, the crowd scattering. There were a few hero wannabes though, and Tony closed the screen as he saw the pistols being aimed. She wouldn't need to know about that if something happened. There was nothing they could do right now.
"Yeah, of course." Steve hugged Peter a little when the little boy laid his head on his shoulder, looking at Tony. Tony reached forward with his good arm, bopping Peter's nose.
“You had better think I look good,” Tony reiterated. “Because you are stuck with this.” He motioned his hand up and down his body. Jamie grabbed his hand and set it back down on his leg.
"Babies need a lot of attention," Peter said, both Tony and Steve detecting a bit of pouting in his tone. He turned his head to look at Jamie, and Jamie was now looking right back at Peter. "She's still small, I bet she can't even walk yet."
"-and you wouldn't want your son to see anymore violence." As George lifted a second finger, Tony felt like he had just been slapped with it. George grinned, but it wasn't a pleasant one, it was a shark that had gotten its prey. He reached into his pocket and pulled out some folded up papers, handing them to Tony.
"Can we go swimming now?" Peter asked quietly, smiling.
“You’re going to be, what? Twenty-eight?”
“Peter!” Tony leaned up, looking around.
“I don’t think he ever ‘scorned’ her,” Mary told him. “I’m not sure Peter is capable of scorning anyone who didn’t deserve it.”
“You’re stinky too!” Peter giggled, then managed to slip down, rolling away from Tony. Tony gasped, putting his hands over his mouth in shock. “I said it!” Tony sat up, going to get up and peter laughed and took off running, Tony right behind him. Peter slid into the bathroom and shut the door, giggling on the other side.
"For reasons."
"I'm already in, Tony," she told him, pulling off the panel to get access to the circuits.
"Hey, Petey," Tony said, going over to take him from his mothers arms.
"Why so quickly?" Steve asked as he opened the dresser and pulled out his last pair of jeans that were clean. He really needed the clothes. He was probably going to have settle for the one red shirt he had left as well. Steve had planned on going back yesterday to grab some clothes, but then, well, Tony had happened.
“Dinner is usually a nice way to break good news,” Meg murmured, drawing her legs up underneath herself on the couch.
Steve leaned over the phone, picking it up to look at it. The song changed again and Steve raised his eyebrow. "Okay, that's the original Paint It Black, not the cover. Usually phones aren't able to play songs on their own, and like no one is able to hack Starktech, at least not new models."
Steve looked at Tony, blinked once, then nodded. "Alright, you know what, I've got a mission. Thanks again for the harness, Tony. I'll let you know how it works out." Tony gave him a little salute.
"Well, I grabbed what I made, but they didn't leave me in that lab all the time." Tony took a drink of his pop. "I didn't have time to mess with their computer systems, but I tried not to record the entire formula for them. Aren't you supposed to be watching Meg?"
"He's a spy, Captain." One more name to use that wasn't Steve. "He's
"Be careful Tony, I'm not going to ruin Peter's vacation with a phone call saying that you got hurt," Mary said to him, reluctantly giving in.
“She’s takes after you so much.”
"Almost done," Peter grinned. "Is Daddy back from DC yet?"
Steve was fidgety, looking over at Bucky, then back to Meg. She cursed under her breath and ran her hands through her hair. "This is so not what I signed up for. I was expecting to come home, see my kids, and maybe try and get some more rest."
“It was Soooooo much fun!” He bounced around then ran over to look at the pictures.
"But it's your birthday," Mary told the ecstatic little boy as he pulled himself up into his booster seat. "That means your get special pancakes." There was a little gasp as Tony leaned against the wall, filming Mary and Peter.
“Soooo, if it’s my birthday, then does that mean I get to listen to whatever music that I want?” Steve asked with a smirk, pulling his phone back up. Tony groaned loudly as another song was added to Steve’s, in his opinion, horrendous playlist.
"Yes in fact, I demand it," Tony said with a grin as he pulled out a long sleeve shirt and some jeans. "I have to regularly feed my ego. It's really for the safety of everyone."
Tony licked his lips. "What had you expected?"
“Look outside”, Steve whispered, his eyes wide open.
As they made their way, Falcon, who stood by the temple gates, saw the white horses and chariot pass by, catching a glimpse of Tony and Steve as they passed by. He frowned, heading in to the temple to inform the goddess that he guarded.
“You’ve been what, stalking me..? Oh, wait a minute here...”
It was beyond his control, the way that Tony would scratch him made him unbelievably happy, like a proper canine. He was grateful for Tony’s devotion and patience, he spent hours with him training, making sure that he still acted human regardless of his feral state. Steve wanted to let him know that he had everything under control, but the only way to confirm that was to offer Tony a human like hug, his huge hands, covered in gold fur, wrapped around the smaller man’s frame. Tony not so secretly enjoyed it, it was warm and comfortable.
“You! I was having those weird accidents because of you?!”
By helping her he meant looking after her temple and trying to do something productive before his next ‘adventure.’ Perhaps he could train or help with the army if anything needed doing.
“A heartbeat”, he exclaimed, blinking a couple of times. “That’s not possible, it’s been over seventy years, how could he even be alive?”, Tony said, his mind trying to desperately find a logical explanation.
“No, I would like to find out about the whereabouts of some people and then visit them. I’m sure you can locate them with your tech, I tried to access it last night but they asked for a password”
They parted just moments later, and Tony could see with pleasure that Steve’s cheeks were slightly pink, a strand of hair dangling just above his right eyebrow.
“I am serious, I am working if you didn’t notice. I’m trying to see what Fury is hiding from us, and I’m pretty sure I’m going to find out something big. Some things just don’t seem fine to me, Rogers. Stop thinking like a soldier for now and be more suspicious”, Tony replied, looking at him while stuffing his mouth with a handful of blueberries.
Tony smiled and pointed outside again. “Do you see this huge tower?”
“Aha, so you do like my company”, Tony said with a softer smile. “Well, I can’t be Tony much, but I really enjoy it now. I enjoyed myself when we were watching that play, when we talk... What about you? I like Steve more than the guy hitting me with his shield back in Sparta.”
“Is caring impure as well?” Tony asked him. “People express their feelings through different actions, Steve. I showed my gratitude towards you with that kiss, for example.”
“Shall we go by chariot or by foot?” Steve asked.
When Nick Fury stepped into the gym, filling him in all the details about Loki and the Tesseract, Steve Rogers wasn’t pleased with all the new information that he acquired. The files under the persons being called in for the Avengers Initiative however, had a little surprise in them. When he saw Tony’s name, or let’s say, surname, written, his heart filled with hope, the photo of him resembling the younger Howard Stark he personally knew. Same posture and cocky smile, Steve thought they would have a similar character as well, and it would be nice to have someone with links of his past to talk with.
“I can knock you down without a drop of blood. I do not succumb to blood lust, like you,” Steve said, taking a step back and holding his shield in front of him.
“So, what you’re looking for... is this?”
He was kept busy almost at all times and that’s exactly what he needed; a mind like his own needed this, he needed to escape the nightmares and anxieties that would hit him at the most unfortunate and inconvenient times.
That’s how I learnt how to make good weapons; from the best. It’s a medallion. It protects me from basically... Well, everything”,
Tony’s own fingers moved lower, too, his hands sliding down onto Steve’s waist to hold him in place as his tongue moved lower, licking the base of Steve's neck, looking up to Steve for his reaction a moment later.
“Watch your mouth, soldier. We can do this the easy way or the hard way. You’ll sit down and let Reed here run the tests. Then we’ll figure out what happened and how he can prevent more… of you… ending up here. Cooperate and you’ll return home soon, all right?”
“First you are eager to kill us and now you aren’t?” Steve said. “You are right; I do not understand you in the slightest. Now move, I wish to spend as long with my people as I can, my time is limited.”
They walked outside, into the cold snow again, the landing pad at the left of the giant tent filled with helicopters, waiting for them and the rest of the crew, that seemed to be running around frantically, unpacking everything and bringing down the tents.
Tony’s eyes widened, his breath cut short. He was staring at an almost perfect copy of himself, eyes shut, skin at its palest. Looking around, he almost tripped on his way to the nearest bin, falling on his knees and throwing up with a series of loud noises.
“Steve!”
Steve laughed a little, nervously. “I... I did,” he said, hunching his shoulders as he recalled the images from the dream. “Your expression and your voice...”
“It looks like I got nothing else to teach you, Mister Stark”, he smiled, cheeks flushed red as he pushed back that blonde mane of his.
Steve laughed, kissing the top of Tony’s head lightly. “Do you wish to stay with me still? Even if I return?”
Eventually the sun set and the stars began to shine bright in the sky. Steve found a resting spot, kneeling down by a tree. “We should probably rest,” he said.
“Is this how you usually do things?”
“And you managed to do that,” Tony said, looking around for the thing he would need to gather for their journey and his stay in Athens. “Perhaps we can practise at some point, teach other some tricks."
“I’d rather not have everyone addressing me as Captain America, Stark. And also, I don’t want to see my face on tomorrow’s papers or anything like that. In fact, I want this to be kept a secret, don’t make a scene , don’t tell the word about me, are we clear?”, he decided, offering his own hand to Tony this time around.
. Tony Stark was right there, battered up, bruised, beaten up bloody. His eyes were glassy, the once bright blue colour faded away.
“Thank you”
“I see how it is," Tony nodded as he led Steve, walking through the city and out of the large, city gates, following the path that he knew that was going to take them to Athens. “So, you came here on foot before?”
“No, this can’t be right”, Tony muttered, his eyes widening as he was sitting on the floor, running his fingers through his messy hair, not caring if his hands were still covered in petrol and other dark liquids.
“How do you make them work? All the functions of your legs are directly linked to your brain.”
Steve stared at Tony, looking deeply into his eyes and hearing hope in his pleading. He felt his heart skip a beat and he let out a shaky breath as he exhaled, his bottom lip quivering. He didn’t know why, he just felt as though he understood, in a way, the expectations Tony had to bear. But he pitied Tony too, for being unable to let go of being a God, to just be human.
“Your kind are bullies, I should have expected as much,” Steve said, letting his hair fall from behind his ears to cover his face as he turned away from Tony. “Your ideas of friendship are questionable.”
“You know, I’m glad that we found your apartment in his condition.. you may not able to live here but.. you could at least visit once more”, Tony said to comfort him, to which Steve nodded.
The blonde leaned closer, eyes shining a bit, peaked interest.
“I wouldn’t mind hearing that from you more often," Tony said with a soft chuckle, tilting his head to Steve’s touch of his lips. “And what about last night?”
When he looked down, he spotted them, those bright, piercing eyes, looking up to him. He froze in place, staring back down, too intimidated to even swallow down.
“What is it?”
Tony blushed faintly. “I feel strange when you touch me as well,” he said, unused to talking in such a gentle way, “but not in a bad way. It feels right, as though it’s meant to be. You are a brave man, Athenian, and your bravery has rewarded you the safety of your people.”
“You have no idea.” Tony muttered, turning to look at Steve when he felt his gaze. “What about you? Did you change upon meeting me?”
“Oh I’m not taking what I learned for granted at all,” Steve said. “I just don’t have a knack for certain things.”
The blonde shook his head finished his drink. “Shall we?”
“Don’t try to play that card on me! A break means you’ll leave and never come back, just tell me that you’re leaving me now, it will hurt much less”, the billionaire replied.
“Tony”, Steve cut him again. “Tony, get inside!”
Steve nodded. “But I have never slept alongside anyone before,” he confessed, looking at Tony’s lips to see them curl into a smile. He seemed so happy, just like when they had been at the amphitheatre.
“Yes, I know, we’ll just have to wait”, Tony interrupted the scientist. “Adjust the room temperature to the normal levels”, he advised as some men from the medical team approached to connect the soldier with wires, just in case he needed the extra push to keep him alive.
“The Infinity Gauntlet...”
“Violence is never pointless; we are not pillagers as you deem us to be. We fight for honour and freedom; we protect this country and deal with anyone who stands in our way,” Tony replied as he watched Steve’s hands and then met his eyes again. “Innocents are never involved, Athenian; perhaps you need to educate yourself about our manners.”
Steve sighed a little, looking into Tony’s eyes. “So do I. I’ve never been close to anyone...” He trailed off, his hands reaching for Tony’s hands.
“You lied to me.” Steve simply said, his voice abnormally calm, haunting even. “Avengers world? Us building this world from scratch? Together? While you… you were destroying another world behind my back?”
Tony gave Mary a one armed hug, the suitcase rolling along behind him. “I’ll be sure to get lots of pictures, and I’ll only lose him twice.” Mary groaned and Tony grinned.
"Yes!" Tony shouted as Steve started the water in the shower. He walked in to grab his toothbrush. Steve shot him an annoyed look as he was pulling off his shirt, and Tony grinned. The first time Tony had walked in before Steve had gotten into the shower, he had made Tony leave, not wanting a show while he got undressed. By the fifth time, Steve had given up on that, mumbling about just pretending that he was back in the army showers and that he was supposed to have something called privacy or something.
"Do you have concern over the Captain's safety?" His AI asked, even as a screen popped up, gaining access to SHIELD's servers.
Tony was a natural showman, that was obvious, and Steve was unable to see this Anthony as the same Tony who was Peter's father, that loved the little boy, and agonized over not being able to him. The business man on stage didn't sound anything close to the man who had anxiety attacks at night about deep dark secrets that he couldn't leave in Afghanistan.
“Fairly normal,” Steve said after a moment to think about it.
Steve took a few extras turns, trying to lose any tails they might have gotten, before he hit the bridge to Manhattan and took a straight shot for the garage in the Tower. Jarvis had opened the garage doors just enough for Steve to slip in, before they were closing and locking again. He stopped the bike and was bringing Wade close to his chest again and slipping off, sliding to his knees to hold onto the boy.
“Stop focusing on the song,” Tony whined a little, curling over Steve’s head and shoulders. “It’s not important-“
“We’re doomed.” Tony grabbed one of his t-shirts and slipped it on. “You could have told me that earlier, I wouldn’t have slept in so much.” Steve raised an eyebrow at him, slipping a button down on over his white tee. “What? She’ll start to get used to him, and then she’ll think he’s the fun Uncle!”
"No, see this isn't a game." Oh yeah, he Was at work. That was the Colonel voice coming out. "You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. You understand that?"
"There is one more thing," Coulson interrupted him, with that infuriatingly calm voice of his. "The assassin who attacked you twice," and that had Tony turned around, "you said he had a metal arm, right?"
“A man cannot change in a matter of days after two encounters,” Steve muttered, brushing back his hair.
“If I offer you my hand you will break my fingers,” Steve said, pulling back with a heavy huff of breath. “I know you, Spartan.”
“Did I do anything? What’s the sudden love for?”, the soldier said with a small chuckle, ruffling Tony’s hair.
Tony watched as the man’s gaze seemed to lower as he revealed such an intimate detail of his past, not sure if he was regretting saying it. Tony couldn’t help but step a bit closer to him, even though he doubted that the Athenian wanted his comfort.
“That changes not the fate of my people, this plight is pointless,” Steve said, “Love is something I know nothing of, nor can I teach you about such things.”
“I didn’t start this, but if you're going to be persistent and stubborn.. we started this, together”
It was true, they really did, and hunting for treasure wasn’t something that Steve ever considered. All it really took was an adventure by legendary Tony Stark’s side to change his “career” path.
“Vibranium..not much of it left in the world now..At least not in our possession, Wakanda’s pulling a hard trade for it, and who can blame them? Everyone’s doing their best to survive..”, he muttered, mostly to cover up his nervousness. “This, gentlemen, is without a doubt, Captain America’s shield”, he announced, but it seemed that nobody else really shared his excitement.
“I hope they do, I wouldn’t want to see your efforts wasted,” Tony said with a nod, adding quickly, “I mean, it would be a shame, wouldn't it? We are supposed to lead the way but it gets so hard sometimes.”
The voice came from the short man in round glasses with the receding hairline. His accent was strong, possibly German. Steve couldn’t exactly tell, it was almost like the man was trying to hide it.
“This is impressive”, Steve said, able to tell that this was indeed revolutionary technology. “So you just talk to it..Ask it different things?”
“I don’t want to be rude, but I think that I can do without a soft bed or a new apartment.”
“And you are welcome in Athens when you suffer from illnesses because of your ‘bravery;’ our doctors are quite experienced,” Steve said with a smug smile.
“Good. Don’t make a mess without me”, Tony chuckled, waving at the Captain, who waved back and leaned against the window, admiring the rest of the precious view. Ever since he woke up he seemed to be exposed in all sort of different experiences, and this sure was one of them. “I wish you could see where I am right now, Ma”, he said with a smile, sitting on the floor and resting his head against the window, closing his eyes for what seemed like a moment. The next thing he saw was Tony leaning down to him and poking his cheek slightly.
“This is not the only reason why I came here”, Tony said, rubbing the back of his head and feeling Steve’s gaze upon him. “You didn’t really talk about it so I figured out that.. if you want to vent in a way.. feel free to do it”, he finally added, hoping that Steve would get the hint.
It did make sense to him to trust Steve. After all, he was just like him, a child of the Gods, having to face so many troubles and problems above his abilities.
Tony blinked in surprise at Steve’s actions, even though it was pleasant. “How was your sleep?" he asked, wrapping his arms around Steve's body to kiss him back, pushing his hair out of his eyes.
“Answer my question,” Steve said, looking at him with a serious expression, eyes softer than before, feeling his heart suddenly skip with fear as he asked it. “Would you treat me as you did before if I were to? Hypothetically. Would you bully me in front of your people?”
“I am not renowned for my grace,” Steve said, removing his helmet to place it back. “In fact I’m known for quite the opposite.”
Steve shut his eyes, resting his head on the pillow, adjusting himself just a little under Tony and glad that he was still so close to him. Tony's warmth was comforting.
“Well… he’s not exactly cooperating… I had to force him to follow me and let me take care of those injuries, and trust me, it wasn't pretty.”
“No, not at all, help yourself out”, Tony gestured, watching the soldier disappear behind the glass doors and sighing to himself. It was true, Stane was becoming more of a threat now, and he wanted to keep quiet about Steve being who he was, following his request. Stane somehow found out, and could potentially use it to his advantage in the slyest way that Tony couldn’t see from a mile apart, unlike his encounters with Justin Hammer. And then there was Steve, who strangely enough chose to defend him way more than he thought he would. Maybe in a way he thought that he was paying Tony back for what he did for him so far, and it did make sense to Tony, after all, Steve was a man with certain moral values, out of this age. And yes, part of Tony thought that Steve wouldn’t survive in this world, later having to curse at himself for forgetting who he was really dealing with, a man who fought a war and grew up when this country was at its worst. He wasn’t an innocent young man, he was a trained soldier capable of doing great things, of maybe killing even, he was able to survive and defend himself.
“Call me Steve. And maybe I was”, the Sheriff corrected with a polite nod, getting up as well.
Steve opened his eyes and peered over his hand at Tony. “I’ve never had that sort of dream before... You and I...” he said, biting his lower lip.
Tony walked with Steve into the main chamber, walking past the numerous statues of Ares, reminding him of who he was supposed to be, how he was supposed to act while he was in the heart of his city, but he didn’t want to disappoint Steve, not after their talk in Thebes.
“I’m going there. They aren’t getting away with this, not a chance. It’s not just about me, have you seen those people? They still don’t have anything left, they had their lives thrown away and didn’t even get a replacement like I did.”
Steve walked a couple more steps, able to resist the urge to look over his shoulder to see Tony for only so long. When he did, he saw that Tony still stood staring after him, looking so lost. It had been strange before to see him as a man of power, in his prime. And then suddenly there he stood, alone and meek.
“Did you see that?!”
“Steve Rogers would be more than just good enough.. maybe even better than Cap”, Tony replied with a faint smile.
“I like being around Tony better than being with the son of Ares,” he admitted, “He seems kinder.”
But Steve was unsure. “Shield myself?” he asked, leaning back on the edge of the bath as he allowed Tony to move closer. “This is friendship, isn’t it? Or... Is there more to it?”
It seemed as though Steve had been drawn there by a duty to instil peace, but allured by the looks of the man before him - a man who was somehow already managing to get into his large heart. He was brought down very quickly by how harsh Tony was with him. He had been warned in the past of sirens at sea, but never once did he think he would ever encounter someone who seemed just like one.
Tony blinked a couple of times, waiting to see if he would say anything else, but he kept silent, not discouraged in the slightest when people starter to murmur around him. The new sheriff looked surprisingly young, and didn’t even greet him. Surely, he had no idea who he was dealing with. He coughed and raised an eyebrow when the man ignored him. Sighing out loud, he stood up and walked over, leaning his back against the wooden counter, inspecting the man’s profile.
“Can I try?” Tony asked as he watched Steve and the little shapes he created, taking in every detail and technique.
“Why wouldn’t I?” Tony nodded, pleased with Steve’s happy reaction.  “You’ve showed me so much; I should be able to do the same."
“Can you believe this? How do they work so well? I swear, they are so strong, I tried to grab a jar this morning and it just broke in my hands...”
Steve’s eyes widened slightly, looking over at Tony with a confused look. “You’re... Not in love with me?” he asked with a shocked expression. All this time he was led on to think that Tony was, and hearing his confession suddenly made his heart plummet.
“It’s me, isn’t it? That’s my beard there," Tony said with a smile, leaning closer to examine Steve's work. “It’s really accurate, if I can say that.”
“Who said that you are?” Tony asked in confusion, not really understanding why Steve seemed to have taken his kiss as a bad sign. “I’ve only asked to be your friend; I don’t remember asking you of anything else.”
“Steve… I had to, we had no choice, we could either save ourselves or have both our worlds disappearing, we couldn't-“
“He doesn’t have the guts to hurt me”, Tony shrugged. “At least not directly. He’s like a snake, sly and slithering around trying to have his way, but I’ve made it my goal to stop him at all costs. In fact, it’s actually fun to piss him off, you know”
“You know… we should get you back home”, he blurted out before he could stop himself.
“Hold on there!”
Tony’s helmet lifted up, eyes widened in surprise. “Where did that come from…? We’re not done with Kang yet, I can’t go, remember?”
“My gifts outweigh yours, Spartan. You threaten my people with such ease and with such a sharp tongue, I’ll be sure to put an end to that. My people will remain safe, that is a promise.”
“What’s up?”, Tony asked, causing Steve to snap out of thoughts.
Steve heard him call out in the voice that made his heart throb with agony, watching as his own man had run past only to be slain. He was conflicted. He saw his man being killed and yet he couldn’t help but run up to Tony, quickly looking down at him with tightly gritted teeth. “You promised me... my men would be safe,” he shouted, with a mix of rage and sorrow in his voice.
“Obadiah Stane”, Tony said with a sigh. “He’s been around the company for years now, he was there when my father was still alive and thinks that I owe him great time for that”
“I gave you.. I gave us many chances, Tony.. we always end up hurting each other, love shouldn’t work this way..”, Steve replied calmly, his soldier persona coming on now.
“Of course I do!” Tony said. “I just wanted to make sure that you know what you’re asking for."
“Don’t you dare come any closer, don’t you fucking dare!”, he yelled. “You see, you can’t do that! Don’t trick me like that, don’t give me everything then take it away from me, I’m not your play thing, Rogers! I trusted you, I let you in, and I did that once before in my life. And when I started to believe that everything was going to be fine, you just.. give up.. great team leader you are there, I thought the Captain would never surrender”, Tony snorted, his voice breaking down as he talked.
Steve would go on with his day but it seemed that he just got really..unlucky. He would trip down the stairs, have a cupboard open right into his face, get a ball thrown at him, nothing seemed...natural. He wasn’t the type of guy that believed in bad luck, but he often found him trying to remember when it was the last time that he crossed paths with a black cat or broke a mirror. It was starting to trouble him that most of those strange “accidents” almost costed him a few of his teeth. Drinking so much milk as a kid seemed to have proven useful now; a tooth got chipped but that was the worst that happened to him so far.
being with them seemed the right thing to do. Besides, Pepper seemed to be properly happy with Happy (what an surprise, Tony used to think to himself), and Pepper even urged him to find someone suitable to be my Tony Stark’s side.
Steve stared at him for a moment, “My mother abandoned me, Tony, and there is very little chance of my people listening to my words. This was meant to be my redemption.”
Tony smiled as he started walking; making sure that Steve was behind him as they walked out of the city, nearing a chariot.
His eyes fell on a Captain America toy figure which looked worn out, the star on his costumed doll self fainting away. He figured out that this was indeed a personal collection, and wondered how much Tony probably had to pay to afford all those things; Steve knew that they were the real deal, but he also knew that more shields existed, for an instance, and that the billionaire probably offered a lot to have his own little corner in this room dedicated to America’s hero. Inspecting the figure, he lifted the delicate shield that it had on its back, seeing something written there. Squinting, he tried to read up on the rather messy, childish handwriting, and for a reason he couldn’t explain, it did made him smile.
“I will not kill you, Athenian. I don’t believe in what the Fates see, I’m not letting anything happen to you" he said in the same tone.
Steve nodded, letting out a couple of short breaths. “S-shall I..?” he stuttered, sitting up a little.
“I had to keep myself busy. You left a gap in my life, Rogers.”
Happy’s smile seemed genuine, and Steve nodded to him before they made their way downstairs and into the car.
Tony watched as Steve approached him at his own pace, wanting to keep his eyes open to watch the handsome, perfectly shaped face as he brought their lips together, but he couldn’t help but shut them, overwhelmed with emotions.
Steve had known this would happen if he came to Sparta, that he would get his morals questioned and picked apart, and who was he to walk into a land and change them entirely? He kept quiet with a bitter look on his face, narrowing his eyes a little and pursing his lips tightly.
“Please, Tony.”
Steve moved from one to the other eventually, sucking at Tony’s body, taking his time in tasting how sweet it was.  He gazed up at Tony for his reaction, licking his lips as he continued to kiss down Tony’s beautifully shaped body, along his olive skin.
“We need him here.”
The top floor of the Avengers Tower was occupied by Captain America, Bruce Banner, Thor, and even Black Widow and Hawkeye dropped in to help. Maria Hill offered her services just as much as everyone else, and Rhodey was spending all his time trying to locate his best friend.
As soon as the gods disappeared, they all started to chat, saying a few last things to each other, Bruce accepting Tony’s offer to pass by the Stark Tower, Clint and Natasha suddenly talking about some top secret SHIELD missions they were going together, and next thing he knew, Tony was standing opposite Steve.
Tony rolled his eye as he turned to Steve who tilted his head in curiosity, wanting to find out what that was about.
“Like I said, the booze’s on me, but don’t abuse that”, Tony said, adding a small laugh to indicate that he was in fact joking, standing up and fixing his waistcoat. Even if Steve tried not to pay attention, Tony was indeed a fine man, someone that all the ladies in town would swoon over. Who was he kidding; they probably did every night he sat down by the bar.
Steve held his breath as he gestured to Reed to shut down the communicator, to which Tony responded by slamming his fist against the glass again.
“I won’t be a burden,” Tony said. “I’ll just head back to Sparta, get some provisions first. My job here is done.”
“I know. You can spot everything from here,” Tony said as he raised his hand, trying to point at the constellations. “The North Star, Orion’s Belt. I’m sure I can see more.”
When the alert came in, the thought of what day it was just vanished from his mind, suiting up in no time and flying out. From what he gathered, Natasha asked for help in what should have been a stealth mission, an easy one for her. The wrong intel was fed to them, and the AIM lab she was meant to infiltrate had a little more manpower than anticipated to be taken out in a stealthy way.
“I didn’t specify that,” Tony said, finding himself staring at Steve, searching his face. “I always find boar hunting really interesting. So are you saying that this, uh, friendship, is a secret? Our secret?”
Steve moved lower, kissing Tony’s torso and moving to suck the skin on his chest softly, just as he was ‘taught’.
“Do you wish to touch a star? Well, I’m going to build something, better than Daedalus, and bring the brightest star for you to hold. Then we can place it back to the sky," Tony said with a bright smile, looking over to Steve.
Just like any other night, Tony stayed awake until he made sure that Steve was asleep. When he finally heard the man’s light snoring, he closed his eyes, trying to drift away to sleep.
“Do you want it as well?” Tony asked a smile curving one corner of his mouth. “I mean, me coming with you?”
“We call this, Operation Rebirth. We are planning to take veteran soldiers like you who were injured in battle and give them what they lost back, but only better.”
Steve looked and nodded.
“Was he married?”, he asked, leaning against the door, a safe distance being put between them.
“I knew it had something to do with that," Tony teased. “You know if you carry on doing that...it’s going to be really hard for me to actually get off the bed," he said softly.
When he was finally released, he made his way back to Deadwood, trying to recover like nothing happened. Instead, he demanded the release of the local sheriff and is immediate replacement, something that was dealt with right away. Needless to say, he took measures the ensure that repetition of the incident in future would be prevented, and hired a buffed man who went by the name Thor to always be around in the saloon, providing him with a place to stay and drinks. Just providing a service along with drinks was enough for the new muscle of the saloon and kept him content, so Tony focused on getting back his clientele instead.
This man worked with his father back in the day, in fact, most of the things Tony himself knew about the Captain, besides facts stated in his old film reels and comics, were drunken statements of his father. To hear everything that happened back in the day from the hero himself however, was a different case. Those thoughts really kept him going, but eventually, he lowered his head, the tiredness of the day getting to him.
Steve looked at him carefully. “Perhaps...a rest is needed. And after that rest I can decide whether I wish to stay.”
Tony stayed quiet too, not really knowing how to act around Steve. He was afraid that every time that he tried to make a nice gesture, he was messing it up again. “Where do you live back home?” he asked eventually, with genuine interest. “What's it like?”
Steve probably agreed since he remained silent. He didn’t do anything to be proud of, not really, ever since he woke up. He was working on adjusting to this new century and life, but that was about it. It wasn’t even his mourning stage, at least that’s what he thought, but sitting down holding on all those memories sounded like that period of his life. He nodded and picked up one of the comics, flicking through it, and then he noticed a box in the back of the closet, a larger one that the one he was holding on to.
Nothing seemed to have changed, the body still looked cold and it was still pale, and the man’s eyes didn’t even open, not once.
The soft pants and moans that were audible made Tony shiver inside the suit, finding it so hard to stay quiet, not when his lover was in such a state, so alluring and enjoying what was given to him. Without thinking about it twice, he muted the suit, finally able to let out a groan, panting inside the suit as he pushed the slim finger deeper inside, gutted that he was taking no satisfaction other than seeing Steve’s face and listening to his changed voice; it was still a big step for both of them.
“Well, a man can dream,” Tony said with a smirk. “Now, we never tell Mama how much I got you guys to eat.” Tony pointed at the two boys with his fork. “They’ll both have my butt for giving you so much unhealthy stuff.”
“True, but I was little Wade’s favorite babysitter when his parents were working.” She glanced back towards the school, then faced Bucky again. “Are you enjoying this little slice of freedom?” She lowered her voice and stepped closer to him. His finger twitched, the knife sliding down his arm. “I’m playing the long game, something that even you don’t know about. How long do you think you’ll be safe in that little Tower? Under protection of Tony Stark? Steven Rogers?” Hilda snorted softly. “We’ll get them both, preferably alive, but we’ll make do.” Her hand grabbed his wrist as the knife slipped into his palm, slamming it back against the car. “You won’t make a scene, not in front of the school. Lucky for you, neither will I.” She tapped his nose, then took a step back. “I’ll be seeing you soon, Soldier. Better get those two boys home, yeah?” She started to walk away from him. “Tell my niece hello, would you?”
"I wasn't a hamster!" Peter protested.
“Agreed,” Steve said to them. “You three come back inside-“
“You should go with the tie,” Peter told him. “If you look important, then the people will give you more stuff for me.” Tony couldn’t help but snort.
"Now, slam all your weight into it!" Tony saw the door fly forward, slamming into the first woman and knocked her off of her feet, and into her companion, both landing on the floor. "Run!" Meg appeared on camera, jumping over the first woman, attempting to get past the second, when a hand went out, grabbing her ankle. Tony heard her gasp in surprise and watched her hit the floor, putting her hands out to try and catch herself, and saw the phone slide across the floor. She screamed for help and Jarvis gathered another camera feed to show others heading towards the bathrooms. Meg kept screaming, kicking back at her attackers, while a crowd gathered.
As he crossed the street to the block where Dr Strange was, Tony felt a soft tingle travel down his back. He glanced over his shoulder but didn’t see anything. When he turned back, the townhouse stuck out like a sore thumb, and yet no one paid a second, or even first, glance to it. There had to be a scientific explanation for it. Magic be damned.
Tony put a hand on his stomach, still feeling a few twinges in his muscles. “Yeah, point blank.” He frowned and looked down at the no longer struggling woman. “What the hell happened?”
"Sorry," Steve said, slipping his hands in his pockets. He needed to grab some clothes from his apartment. "I didn't want to interrupt anything." He motioned towards the door.
"If you get all your homework done before bedtime tomorrow, then I think that you can have a sleepover with Daddy." Peter whooped and Steve couldn't help but chuckle with Mary.
“I’m happy staying like this for a while,” Steve told him, glancing over Tony’s shoulder to see Peter and Jamie, faces relaxed in the sleep. “At least Peter’s mouth isn’t open yet.”
Tony had pulled out a few more personal notebooks of Howard's, and was flipping through them, looking at random equations, drawings of a cube, when Bruce returned with a film projector. It was set up, and within fifteen minutes they were watching a old reel of the Stark Expo. Maybe Tony could use this, drum up the public support. He'd use the complete version of course, but he could use this stuff.
"His Granma is out of surgery," Tony whispered to him. "They'll know more in the morning, but she's stable." Wade nodded, then closed his eyes again, trying to go back to sleep. Tony watched both boys for a couple more moments before he left the bedroom, leaving the door open just a crack.
"Will you have a few hours?" Steve asked. Tony didn't say anything, focusing on his hands. "Stark."
"Someone's gotta do it," Tony said. His tone wasn't bitter, sounded more,... resigned, than anything. "Since I can't do it at all, and I know that Peter likes you, I'm not too worried."
“Who, me? Dramatic?” Steve rolled his eyes a little. “Says the man going to see his best friend, and try not to lecture him about teaching the boys to apparently do acrobatics.”
"Thank you, Coulson," she smiled at him, kissing his cheek. They both stopped, blinking a bit at the action. "For a lot, last night, and today." She hurried through, sure that her cheeks were blushing a little. Coulson nodded a little, and pat her arm, ruffling Peter's hair a little, and slid out of the limo.
"Dummy and You can help you with any other presents for Peter," Tony started to say as he headed for the stairs up to the bedrooms. "And Jarvis can give them directions to help as well. Don't give them anything fragile though, it's why I haven't put Butterfingers on present duty."
As he opened the text files with his notes, he watched recent news pop up to the side. It had been an automatic feature that Mary had set up for him, to keep him updated on the world now, so he could compare and contrast the past as he learned it to what was happening now.
"If you don't go, I'm going to kick you," Tony told him. "But you better take lots of pictures." Tony pulled one of the prototype Starkphones out of his pocket. He had planned on giving it to Steve on the way back to the Tower, but this worked, too. "Peter will never let you live it down if you don't have something to show when you get back." Steve blinked as he took the phone. "It's got all the important numbers in there, and I got that number. I'll let you know the second something happens here." He was purposely trying to avoid things that might make Steve feel guilty for leaving, but they both knew that they were talking when Mary woke up.
“Thanks for reminding me,” Steve said as he stood up. “I need to meet some of the delivery men downstairs in a couple hours. Don’t worry, I’ll take over the rest of that ‘domestic’ necessity.”
"Couldn't be more serious," Tony answered, dropping into the leather chair behind his desk and pulling open some drawers.
"No," Tony said with a little snort. "I could buy Disney in an hour if I really wanted, too." Steve didn't deny that was possible. "I don't know, just, a feeling I can't explain," he shrugged. "Didn't say no, though. I know they'll have an amazing time." Steve kissed him softly before Tony tucked his head under Steve's chin.
Steve frowned a little. “And what do we do then?”
“Forty-two??” Steve looked at Tony with big eyes. He had seen some of the suits, and the more recent ones weren’t just upgrades of the current Iron Man armor. They were different colors, different body styles, they looked like they all had different functions. Steve was sure that there were multiple hidden functions. “The one that I walked in on, thirty-nine? That one looks almost like it was space grade.”
“Is there anyone else that might know? Maybe something about magic?” Steve asked, shifting his legs so he could pull Tony into his lap. “Maybe the Fantastic Four might know something about the portions of space that you saw?”
"No, Mama. Color," Peter argued.
“I bet they work on Stark,” Bucky said with a quirk of his lips. Tony shot a glare his way.
“Try raising him,” Mary murmured and Tony shot her a look, causing her to grin again.
Tony pressed past Steve, and this time he wasn't stopped. Tony grabbed his collar, pushing him back up against the door. "You're not getting a cent out of me. You think that you're the first person to try this with me? I will bury you in so much legal-ese and lawsuits that it'll make your head spin. I know your kind, and the demands will never stop coming."
"Daddy, Daddy, Daddy." Peter's voice came down the hall, the little boy hopping on both feet towards the two men. "Granpa says that dinner is ready."
"There's less than fifty guests," Coulson told Tony. "Not much herding to do."
William and Rachel walked into the room a moment later, Coulson putting down a new carafe of coffee, and a new mug in front of Tony. He managed to go through coffee like a thirsty man in the desert. "Hi Granpa! Hi Granma!" Peter waved, still sitting in Tony's lap. "I saved you seats over there," he said, pointing to the two empty seats.
Steve brought one hand up, tilting Tony's head back down. His fingers were soft against Tony's skin, and Tony closed his eyes. "Did I mention that there were a lot of unfair things about you? This would be one of them."
