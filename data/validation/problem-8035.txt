He could hear her pull a breath in, louder in her surprise. Some people thought they knew each other well enough to predict every movement. They knew each other well enough to still throw each other for a loop now and then, the way not many could, past the experienced spies’ eyes.
“Yes. But the ramblings of a trauma survivor matter little against video evidence, prior record and the assumptions of the horde.” T’Challa barely moved as he spoke, clearly a man not given to gestures or fidgeting. “I am to understand that there was some new physical evidence brought to light.”
“What I don’t understand,” His voice began, entirely without permission. Peter glanced up, as if sensing this was something different, because the kid had goddamn superpowers even in this. “-is why you keep on fucking limiting yourself to the rules binding other people.”
, the one thing he’d wanted for so long, almost desperately; the one thing he’d known to be right- seeing it happening introduced a strange hollowness in the pit of his stomach. There was relief somewhere,
“What.” Tony couldn’t recognise his voice.
“I didn’t set this up-”
“The Director will see you now.”
Peter’s feet were still sticking out of his pathetic excuse of a bed, knobby ankles and all, blindly groping around for a doodad he’d cooked up in eighth grade at summer camp. That very description made Tony’s brows shoot up into his hairline, but before he could back out, Peter had already hoisted himself up onto his mattress; head disappearing into wooden and metal chests that could be a serious health hazard if they fell from that height, whose bright idea was that anyway?
He wandered aimlessly, feet carrying him past Flinders Street all the way down to Elizabeth’s, chatter and music seeping in and out of his eardrums. The stream of people seemed to bend right suddenly; so he turned right with them, on to Collins Street. Carried along with the flowing crowd…not unseeingly, but with flashing lights and bright dresses and neon banners all blending in his vision together, like someone had upended a glass of liquid on a watercolour painting. Colours flowing freely, till everything was washed out.
“I…..look Cap.” Sam heaved a massive, dramatic sigh and Steve’s eyes rolled before he could even begin on whatever tangent he was going to start now. “You know I got your back. You do. And when you go around kissing leggy blondes….I’m all for it. But you gotta admit, this thing with Sharon
“Getting humiliated in front of kids? Less so ever since I left high school, if you’d believe it or not.”
, but somehow couldn’t seem to escape past the blockade in his throat-because he liked to be honest, and watching a man you didn’t know for ten hours
Finger outstretched, Tony gave a tentative poke of his own. ‘
When Tony lifted his head next, mostly to blink through the blurriness – the workshop was silent. Crap, missed the solo.
“We’re not children, Rhodey.” He wanted to sound constant. Unaffected. But a thread of inexorable tiredness leaked into his words anyway. “Can’t let a dispute risk the loss of lives now, can we?”
He wasn’t even fully stretched out. He was kneeling on the mattress, neck bent at an absurd angle, arms straining for something placed on a moronically high shelf-probably a home job, judging by the nails hammered into the flaking plaster.
He cleared his throat; a minuscule sound that didn’t leave the confines of the suit. Neither did the trembling. It would take time, to work his way back to honesty.
The roof above his head was dark. The walls around him too-though as the seconds ticked away in his mind and his vision adjusted, details began to emerge. The walls were a dark grey, unpainted concrete damp in patches, creating shapes and swirls. A single, hanging fluorescent bulb gave off light-a dim yellow that licked against the overlapping tin sheets the roof seemed to be constructed of, gleaming dull and silver. He could see rust flakes at the joints.
“Bring presents.” Tony got to his feet, knee cavities perfectly lubricated and uncreaky. Huzzah for small mercies. “Maybe an Itsy Bitsy Spider mug.”
Steve closes his own eyes, brushes his mouth over the corner of Tony’s, where the wrinkles begin – the place missing just a few extra lines.
, but of course, that was neither here nor there.
Besides, it wasn’t like Tony Stark wouldn’t think of searching for a tracking chip in a device sent to him by a man who’d literally driven his weapon into his heart.
“SHIELD wasn’t home to you?”
Maybe he’d have voiced that, several years ago. When he’d believed he could do anything. Idiot.
“And you will stay there for six goddamn more if I have anything to-”
the talking? Hey, and speaking of things that can kill you.” A humourless snort. “We didn’t have to blow up billions of public property. I didn’t have to fight against a woman I would have bled out dry to keep safe. Wanda didn’t have to fight the only person she’s formed a real connection with after Pietro. Scott didn’t have to put his life with his daughter on the line for his hero. Rhodes didn’t have to snap his spine.”
So he blinks, and Steph’s eyes are looking a little glassy and he can tell because she’s too close, all of a sudden, too, too close-and something incredibly soft and
What Tony had was Steve, here at the end of it all, imperfect and unvarnished and glorious; and for all the scars that Tony’s beating heart had sustained over the years, in this particular moment – he couldn’t find it within himself to be afraid.
“You’re welcome Tones.” Rhodey returned, just as simply. And for a second there, the room was peaceful.
“But that’s all you do.” FRIDAY was starting to sound almost distraught, and god. When had her vocal assemblers gone so completely out of control? “You go to meetings with politicians and businessmen, and work, and do everything you’re supposed to do- but you’ve been spending lesser and lesser time with other people, with the lone exception of young master Peter-“
(He thought he’d admired it in Steve….the naiveté of his idealism. But of course the tables turned, and he despised himself- because the only naïve fool around here was him.)
Rhodey’s mouth primmed itself into a forbidding line. He noticed- of course, he noticed. “The old nightmare again?”
And Sam stepped forward, to say what, he didn’t know-except something small and cylindrical caught under his shoe, unsettling his heel. He blinked at Stark for a detached moment, foot moving back instinctively-and Stark ducked down, moving much quicker than a man wearing tons of armour should. A second later, his shoulders uncurled and spine unbent, and Sam stared at the implement held aloft delicately between two fingertips.
He knew the sound of this record- it was set to an orchestra of a deep, grieving, aching sense of loss. It had played in his head ever since he woke from the ice; yet this, this current one plaguing his mind, was somehow utterly different- punctuated by something thick and twisting, stabbing at his heart at odd intervals, gnawing at his feet in restlessness. This was the difference between having something precious snatched from you, and letting something go from your own hands. Except……letting go was supposed to be accompanied by something like peace, wasn’t it? Resigned sacrifice, but acceptance.
“My best friend.” There was no mistaking the affection in Rhodey’s voice, even with how quiet and withdrawn it sounded. There never was. Constant and unwavering and never leaving and all those stupid, stupid things. “The genius who revolutionised the world of artificial intelligence and robotics, but who still considers clean energy his biggest achievement. The business man with billions of dollars to his name. The superhero who saved a planet. I never thought I could love something more than flying a plane, but you gave me War Machine and….” Rhodey’s eyes were glimmering in the light. “And I could
“Latitudinal asymmetric thrust, ladies and gentlemen. It’s a thing.” Rhodey did the pencil-twirl thingy between his index and thumb – Tony had never been able to manage it himself, and it made him terrifically jealous. “The military never did understand how to rope SI back into a contract. Instead of generals with bristling moustaches and weak-ass intimidation, they should have just chucked their inept designs at you and you’d have been all over that with a red pen out of sheer frustration.”
but that was too hard to voice, and he told his tongue to change direction, but it listened to him too well. And what came out was:
Tony stayed silent.
“Every week, I go up to the terrace.” And it was strange, that for all the bouncing around that their conversation had been doing, that this particular one should feel apropos of nothing. But Steve was speaking slowly, lips carefully feeling out the words, eyes seemingly fixed on an absent point above his own shoulder. “The pool. I ask JARVIS to…to reduce the temperature. And I try to get in, as far as I can.”
Even Christmas. Clint snags a thumbnail under the wrapping paper and peels it open from the middle; lifts the box set of
Even before New York, he never really liked the stars.
It’s practically encoded into the DNA of a futurist: mingled with the marrow of their bones. The regret, muted ache and white-hot agony by turns, propelling him faster and further like a stallion under the lash. He can’t wait for all the variables to reveal themselves. He can’t even wait for the problem.  Time is his enemy, and he has to,
“Dum-Dum was chewing on his third stale cigar of the day, said it kept him awake. Gabe kept crowding him, tryna get ‘warmth’ from the lit cig, but everyone knew he just liked the smell. Reminded him of summers at Tampa.” There was the smallest smile whispering at the corners of Steve’s lips, rawer than if he’d broken apart and wept.  “Buck was convinced the mission was my way of getting back at him for all our Coney Island trips, but I wouldn’t’ve picked these odds. Nine-car steamliner, hurtling down a mountain railroad at a hundred miles an hour. Ten second window.” Tony had never heard numbers…hurt, like this. They were bluntly cut syllables, dulled like they’d been repeated within the privacy of a mind stuck in rut a thousand times, their finality inescapable. “Ninety foot gorge.”
When they parted, Steve expelled his breath in a long, dragging, gratified sigh. Tony smiled. “Besides, I don’t know if I’ve ever shared this with you, Steven – but I don’t give up easy.”
…yeah, she leaves. Yeah, it eventually wears on her, being the crux of Tony’s everything. But Tony doesn’t resent her, not even for a second. It’s like resenting air when you’re being dunked in a barrel of water. It isn’t hurting you. Its absence is.
“So I’m stuck there asking the obvious, which is, ‘why do you think you should marry her?’” And he’s trying to hold on to the lighthearted tone, he was, but it’s hard to not let sincerity sneak in when you’ve got Peter Parker watching you deliver a toast in his honour, luminescent in his happiness. When you’ve got a crowd of people you love and respect hanging on your every word – and Steve Rogers at the back of said crowd, glass untouched in his hand; gaze undimmed by time, as steady and unwavering as it was twenty years ago. “And Peter answers back, the most assured I’ve ever seen him, ‘Because I want to’.”
“Tony, I’m not sure this is supposed to be here.”
“What?” Steve resisted the urge to glance around wildly, as if Sam had been spying on him through the numerous cameras mounted on the walls and had caught his little struggle and subsequent moment of victory. Miraculous as modern day technology was, Sam was an ordinary American university student, who did
He doesn’t.
Opposite him, Natasha straightened up. Met his eyes, and gave him a tiny nod.
Rhodey snorted. “How old is that movie now, forty years?” His hand was still moving unerringly over the page: long, straight strokes. “And you know it isn’t just that. They give me ten requirements, I’ll give them…five extra features on top of that, max. Someone asks
“I gave you that info at the Raft, didn’t I.” It was Sam’s turn for a humourless smile, barely lifting his lips. “Wouldn’t have done that if I didn’t, in all.”
“New A.I.?” FRIDAY enquired. She was getting better and better at not coming right out with her concerns about Tony’s general screw-y behavioural patterns. On some level, that thought hurt.
- superheroes would lose every single inch of the little credibility they still had, and everything that Tony had fought so hard for, no matter how headstrong and misguided, would be lost-
The smile rose to Steve’s eyes more than his lips, quiet and faint. “Yeah.”
“I…..don’t nanny you.” FRIDAY sounded almost uncertain. Dammit, Tony should have worded that better. When was he ever going to get things right? “I look after your welfare, as my predecessor did before me, because it is my duty. You need reminders for your sleep, and eating, and work hours, and-“
“It’s a biologically compatible metal. Doesn’t react with, or negatively affect body tissue. Even used in the treatment of certain cancers.” Tony remembers the darkness in Bruce’s eyes the first time they’d met, that ill-meant, sardonic smile. Remembers the split-second judgement of mercury-doesn’t stick to anything, deceptively toxic to the environment. He knows better now. “Besides, one of platinum’s biggest uses is actually as a catalytic converter in automobiles. Turns the harmful things in exhaust to environment friendly goop. I think he’d appreciate that.”
“So I’m a
“Fabrication complete.” FRIDAY intoned, that soft soprano the only sound paring through the chilly workshop air.
“Sometimes your heroes aren’t all they’re cracked up to be.” And…damn. There it was. The little contemptuous, angry voice made of concentrated hurt. And he’d been doing so well too.
, watched on smilingly from the distance. Maybe it was just the Dr Pepper talking, but this felt like one of the moments all those other moments had been leading up to. “I think you might be what marriage is supposed to look like. And here’s to ten more years of schooling us in being awesome.”
He had the time now, so he took it. Several selfish seconds, of staring at the brown eyes so inescapably close to his, the ones that had spat contempt at him and offered a home to him and widened in betrayal at his actions. Steve memorised it all, like a painting he’d never be able to put to page – the blood-crusted mess of Tony’s hair, the silver in his eyebrows, the gaunt hollows of his cheeks, the resolute tilt of his chin. The brightness of him, the tenacity, the inability to walk away – like red still lingering in the sky long after the sun had gone down.
It was like feeling his atoms implode, the burn beginning from the tips of his fingers and scoring past muscle, sinew, nerve – the blood in his veins on fire, working up his arm and charring everything in its path. His eyes rolled to the back of his head, ground rushing up to hit his spine–
him the last time too.”
crooning in the background. “Hey FRIDAY, are you having me on?”
Steve looked up. Tony looked……he had a three-piece suit on, a recent look he’d picked up that he was now sporting everywhere(from his father, from his father, so that people would take him more se-) and perfectly groomed hair, and was walking through the throng of reporters alone. He had ‘fired’ Happy after that Extremis mishap, and Pepper was…..right, they weren’t. He had resources though. Surely he could employ someone to keep the media at a distance, stop them from clambering all over him, shoving mikes into his face. But Tony Stark didn’t even need that. He could project an aura that made you want to keep a ten-feet distance, fling out fast-flying jabs that would insult your dressing sense and your mental faculties and your purpose in life (but never family, because Tony would never be so crude) before you could blink thrice.
- whoa. Okay, diminished pain but a stupid amount of dizziness…was there water around here somewhere? Coffee maybe?
“Damn right I did.” Tony affirmed with pride, scarfing down the cheese in a single gulp. Mm, cotija. “And still no grandkids for Uncle Tony.”
“Heard of him first in Canberra. Among other things.” Tom’s words drifted on the breeze, quiet and ephemeral. “I’d gone there years ago, did a Bachelors of International Relations. Came back home eventually…but I suppose I never stopped thinking.”
“We make mistakes. We fuck up. The problem with your side,
Anyway, this really wasn’t supposed to be dragged out this long. One highly immature conversation featuring Wordsworth, whichever psychopath wrote nursery rhymes, and Chester Bennington. But apparently it’s only just the beginning, because when Tony drags himself out of the armchair he’d sacrificed his back to the next morning, there’s an actual piece of paper waiting for him on the coffee table. Paper, my my. Talk about museum artefacts.
“Not going to happen Rhodey I’m coming and there is nothing you can do to stop me,” Tony said stubbornly using the voice they knew he was serious and that he wasn’t changing his mind.
they didn't want to brainwash him for they did not want to risk the lose of weapons they could of optain from him so they kept him under lockdown. Tony stark was saved by the end of the third month by vision and spiderman aka peter parker.Tony didn't know he was pregnant yet he was getting sick as the days past he was worried about what they did to him everybody was. He was gaining weight he couldn't keep in food. He was tired all the time so he decided to run the test he refused to do in his return as so he discovered what hydra as done to him and of the pregnancy.
“Hey you okay, Friday said you needed me” Rhodey said, taking a seat next to tony.
“Tony hey”
“and where do you think your going stark didn't think we're going to let go of you that easy now did you, you're going to pay for what you did back there but first its time for your medicine,”
“Steve”
“Alright, Mr. Stark could you tell me what had happened,” the doctor asked as he gently examines Tony's Stomach.
“I know baby that’s why your daddy tried to save and protect him,” Tony said looking up at the ceiling cradling mason close “but he went the wrong way about it and it got people hurt”
“Tony this is Bow Johnson, he is one of my most loyal students, bow you know tony stark, now bow you are here because we hope you can help Mr. Stark, he needs you to help him with some of his forgotten memories”Charles introduced them he knew he was playing a dangerous game and that Erik was right he should of just ask but something was ticking at Charles.
Frowning“Mr. Stark are you all right,” T'challa asks.
“Well wasn't that sweet” the guard mocked the look of amusement in his eyes the fact that the guard was amused by death made tony realize that sick bastard like this didnt deserve to breath“none the less” the guard continues pointing the gun at tony again “It doesn't change a thing time to die stark”.
“Or someone did, but stark paid them off not to say anything” Clint chimed in.
Sitting him on the bed Rhodey pulled off his shirt and laying him down, Tony was already asleep when he tucked him into bed.
“You have a name for her yet Tony,” pepper asked sitting on the edge of the bed, oh he had a name, a name he was in-depth too even though he knew he didnt own her anything but she had saved his baby and that was all he could ever wish for.
“Change it, I was willing to find a God Damn Way To Change Every Fucking Word And Law On that Contract The Minute They Fucking Signed It” Tony's voice rising with every word he spoke.
*******************************************
“A diverse council” T'challa question with a confused look on his face, it was actually kind of cute not to mention T'challa was a really handsome man with his*No no-no Tony dont think about that*Damn his hormones had spiked for the last month and with the dreams he has been having was not helping he was straight like an arrow he liked his woman all blond and blue-eyed, with a beautiful smile that he could stare at all day.
“Fry add going to see Charles Xavier to the almost full list to do please and what about the super soldier DNA”
“He's dealing just like everyone else is,” Sam says going to stand before Natasha “it was a big change for all of us”.
Grabbing one of the folders T’challa starting to go over it mumbling a “ah” as he went.
“Because I felt it you were worried,” mason said relaxing in her father’s arms taking in the smell of the soap he washed with cologne and motor oil it soothed her to an almost sleep state.
Tony felt warm, warmer than he felt before safe, protected wrapped in a cocoon of security there was only one word he could name to explain what he felt right now it was Home the soft bed underneath him and the fluffy pillow his head laid upon he never been more comfortable, feeling a warm hand cupping his cheek Tony slowly opened his eyes, a blinding white light shone in his eyes making it hard for him to see anything but the figure of the person sitting with him on the bed but he knew who it was he couldn't explain how but he knew.
{Tony} keep doing what you're doing but keep it low with all the new shit going on in the world it wouldn't be so hard for the council to decide to bring back the only Organisation that knows how to get rid of them.
charles saw something was wrong, tony breathing was harsh, there was pain showing on his face, Rhodey had also noticed this he stepped forward going to comfort his friend.
“Exactly, Erik, Jean was only Ten years old when her abilities manifested but now we have a child who used her powers to protect he father while she wasn't even born yet ”
“It does seem quiet unreasonable but I do understand a bit of force these are superhuman and mutants we are talking about force is necessary on occasions”.
“Tones you were nonresponsive for almost ten minutes where did you go,” Rhodey asked after pepper giving tony an equal amount of worried stare.
“Come on tony you need to be faster than that” Pepper chuckled sitting back as tony chased mason around the couch all while she giggled uncontrollably.
“Alright lets do it but whatever he sees in my memories will not be spoken of in any way and he would keep it to himself” Tony said sternly he didn't want this to come back and bite him in the ass, but he also know Charles was a respectable person he could trust him a little.
coming out of his daze turning towards pepper while taking a sip“ ask Rhodey he read from a pregnancy book that coffee intake is bad for the baby so he got rid of it including the really expensive coffee so I hope you don't mind tea” he simply stated with irritation he loved his coffee it helps him to think and stay awake now he can't have any of it and tea is just untasteful for him and its not working at all seemingly to Accept it she shrugs
“God i dont know what to say, I'm lost for words, steve if you're seeing this then it means you've found out about our daughter and i gave this to you to watch, in this drive im going to record everthing that happens in her life i know it won't be the real thing but its the only thing i can think of so you won't miss completely everything in her life” tony moaned rubbing his face with his hand“Why is this so hard” Letting out a sigh“ okay first thing first you probably want to know how she was created and how she is your daughter, to tell you the truth i don't exactly know myself the only conclusion i could come up with is Biogenetic engineering on an Extreme-scale so far as it seems, semen genetically created from your genetics and a womb, genetically created from mine trust me its insane and confusing all at once, look this is not the way i wanted you to find out about our daughter i wanted to tell you myself but i have to settle for this I'm sorry i had to keep her away from you, i had thought it would be better for her to experience a normal life before she was thrown into the life of superheroes, and danger its why I'm retiring so she wouldn't have to watch her old man die, Again im sorry you deserve to be part of her life but we needed precautions i cant tell you how sorry i am for not allowing you to see her but i will tell her about you the good and the bad she deserves the truth of both of us,”tony spoke softly regret lased his voice, rubbing his stomach trying to sooth the restless baby kicking around about in there she could feel he was upset about something but she didnt understand.
It didn’t take a genius to know what mason meant and it gave Charles even more reason for him to do what he needed to do “okay sweetheart I need to ask you something and if you don’t want to answer and if the answer is no then ill completely understand” Charles said hesitated he didn’t want to scare mason.
“Tony maybe you should try whole pieces of fruit maybe she would like it,” Pepper said taking the cloth out of Tony's hands “Why dont you take mason to the park you know she enjoys it there”.
“he wasn’t in his right mind back then sweetheart something bad had happened to your uncle and he was very hurt and we didn’t know if he was alive some bad people come for him and hurt him some more but I have forgiven him for it but papa is still mad at daddy for not telling him” tony said
“I just don’t understand it, Charles, she just made him come alive, no I.A no old age robotic batteries or power cords nothing just poof a glow of white light and there he was alive” Tony explaining wildly gesturing with his hands.
“Steve?”Sam asked looking around the room looking for steve but no trace.
Shaking his head Rhodey hated his stubbornness sometimes“What about shield” Rhodey ask it had been years since shield/Hydra had fallen well not completely they have been working off the radar and in the dark ever since doing god know what.
“Yes i did” was the only reply he received.
Laughing Tony took masons hands in his own “, yes, and since you have been such a good girl Rex can come too” tony said gasping as mason knocked him over with her joy.
“Okay maybe your right," Tony said interrupting Rhodey's ranting rendering the man silent“Maybe your right he doesn't need to know but i just...thought it would be better for her to have both her parents to be in her life to be there for her when she needs us”.
“hay Vision could you take mason for a bit, tony needs me to go get the kid and tony doesn't want Mason out in the public,” Rhodey asked snapping vision out of his thoughts.
Leaning against the wall trying to pick himself up to brush his teeth and taking a quick shower as rhodey and Friday make plans with his doctors.
“I knew you were a traitor, should have gotten rid of you month ago” the Guard pointing the gun toward her “But no they had to need you i bet you even played apart of convincing them they needed you just so you could be neer stark”.
With the sound of banging and grinding metal gone tony concentrated on the beat of his babies heart while the world around him go dark.
“TONY, I know go already before you make the king wait” pepper interrupted tony before he could go on about something she already knew it was the first time he had left anywhere without mason she was almost 24 hours with her papa but this time she couldn’t go not because he thought wakanda was dangerous but he was scared mason would wander off and run into one of the Roque avengers and he really didn’t want to think if she ever run into Steve.
“i was, the question is tony why aren't you on the couch in the living room or better yet in bed where you can rest?”Rhodey replied knowing what his answer would be, he had to push he couldn't let Tony put any added pressure on himself as he always does even if it wasn't his job or his problem, he's and the baby's health depended on it even thou it was still strange to even think of a man with a baby yet stranger its his best friend and brother, he has had a protective feelings over tony since M.I.T now its more overpowering than before he couldn't stand tony getting hurt not before and not now.
“Gumdrop” Tony called as he walked out the lift and towards where Rhodey was sitting he could see he was out of breath sitting down “you up for a little road trip snookums”.
“Mr stark was this an affair”.
*“Tony we need to talk, *
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
“Its an Earthquake Boss, the whole world is experiencing it,” Friday said.
“Wake up”.
•••••••••••••
“Nat what is it,” Sam asked walking towards her.
“Thank you your highness, i also want to thank you for your invitation into your beautiful country its quite lovely if this wasn't such an important matter i would be an honor to explore it” Tony said politely and professionally smooth talking had always been tony's gift no matter the debate or argument he was in he could always talk his way through But T'challa was an another matter.
* I know but I'm right here you can do it*.
“You look beyond tired why don't we get you to bed” urging tony up by his shoulders Rhodey walked Tony to his room.
Time passes he lost track he thinks it been one or Two months the guards and doctor come in regularly to clean the wound and change the bandages the first time he saw the stitches he screamed another scar to his freak of a body by the time of his death he's going to look like Frankenstein monster.
“We need to go, they found the farm,” he said as he lifted laura onto the chopper before climbing into it himself
“is he going to be okay,” Tony asked pointing at the kid.
God Steve didnt know when he started wanting this so badly having tony in his arms felt so right, he never had wanted this, but now that he had it he didnt want to let go
“To tell you the truth tony I haven't been completely honest with you, the thing is I can't see inside your mind and to even attempt it would cause extreme pain" Charles explained the utter confusion on both of their faces speared him on“Tony you have an energy shield protecting your mind keeping out unwanted attention”.
“The diverse Council what does it entails, limits, restrictions it is a big process i take it you have a plan in order,” T'challa said taking a sip of his wine.
‘Tony’ was all Rhodey got out before Tony stopped him.
His emotions were running high and he has had a hairline temper trigger he was tired of being cooped up he needed out and with fury's surprise visit a week ago made it worse, he wanted to demand fury to tell him if he knew all along but given who he was talked to he already knew his answer and that didn't help at all so he kept cool, showed nothing slapped on his mask, a mask which usually gave him great comfort, NOW send chills down his back and sat a ball of disgust in his stomach, he hated the lies, necessary, but still he hated them.
“ you're pregnant, Mr. Stark.” he answers.
Stifling a laugh Rhodey wiped away a fake tear and joked “that is so touching man I'm so proud“ finally giving in Rhodey laughed.
“Oh don't you worry gumdrop, i already have a plan,” Tony said giving him a brode smile, leaning backward rubbing his swollen stomach while Rhodey was completely memorized as he watched the baby move beneath Tony's hand.
“She is”
5 Years Old
Having had enough with the restriction, Steve stood while lift tony with him setting him back on his feet making sure Tony was steady he shoved his pants down his legs kicking them off as he worked on Tony's pants shoving them down to, he gips the back of Tony's thighs lifting him up again, allowing tony's pants to fall on the ground and to wrap his legs around Steve's hips, crotch to crotch steadily grinding against each other.
“You shouldn't do that to us, sweetheart,” rhodey said to mason kissing her head as she headed to towards the worried father and godmother “You're going to give your father a heart attack and your godmother gray hair” Rhodey chuckled as pepper glared at him handing her off to tony.
Landing next to rogers as the team finally got disposed of the Monsters “Rogers you need to go, go before i do what i have to do” Tony said hearing the sirens of the authorities get closer tony know if they get here before Rogers was gone tony was going to have to arrest steve and he didnt want to do that not after steve saved both Tony and their baby go he wanted to tell steve but it wasn't the time or place.
Looking at his stomach tony placed his hand on his barely formed bump he muttered “you know this is really not a world you want to be born in its shit and I should probably try and stop cursing" he chuckled.
“They aren't there if you know anything that you're not telling us you'll regret it,” the suit said mason had to try and not roll her eyes at the suit he had always been all high and mighty whenever he was in charge it was sickening“ And clean up this mess on the floor” Mason let out a batted breath as they left the suits yelling to the other guards to find the rest she hadn't seen the ash dust-like particles on the floor when she had entered she wondered where they had come from and what it could be.
Steve bolted awake and off of the bed letting his sketchbook and pencil clutter to the floor before coming too, still, a little disoriented he glanced around the room looking for tony rubbing the sleep from his eyes, finding no evidence of Tony's presence a brief feeling of confusion and sadness filled him having realized he had been dreaming.
“They’re great and all but I can’t take care of them like a can a puppy,” Mason said as she placed another piece of metal on the robot puppy that she was building.
He had now completely retired from the Avengers and also as iron man, although when help was needed he would put on the suit or control it when called for, and when he needed to clear his mind he sometimes go for a fly but he gave up being a hero so Mason would not lose him when something went wrong.
Three Years Old
Pulling and pulling Tony tries to get loose but with no success his mind had cleared enough to see through the camera's but the cuffs weren't locked by any electrical so he was still stuck, at least he could get a warning when anyone came his way, at all accounts Tony was mostly left alone the doctors check on him from time to time to see if the baby was fine or if he was ready to pop but other then that he was left alone.
Watching as Steve left the room Sam turned to head to his room only to come to a stop, Natasha standing against the wall staring at where Steve had left “You okay” Sam asked.
“Of course” he walked Rhodey whatever door “And Colonel, when whatever happened, is over let’s talk again I might be interested in, what we discussed”.
All Tony just wanted to do was turn to his side and go back to sleep if only the voice who keeps calling his name would get the picture, moaning tony tries to open his eyes again, Tony swore as the first thing he spotted was a very worried looking Rhodey staring down at him how he got at Xavier's mansion Tony had no idea but he knew what was in store for him.
“Now Macie your father says you have progressed with your powers can you show me,” Charles asked sitting in front of mason he looked at tony almost assuring him that he meant mason no harm, seeing Charles had worked out a plan to help his daughter didn’t help his nerves he was extremely overprotective.
Hi look who is finally back I know I know I was gone for a very long time I really tried to come back sooner but when life gives you lemons you make lemonade or in my case lemon marang pie lol but any case I'm back with 3 chapters yay and also if you read it there is a time skip in chapters it was put there purposely so it won't drone on and get boring
He couldn't understand his mind was a fog and it felt like he was floating why was he here how did he get here but nothing came to mind as the elevator dinged announcing his arrival Steve stepped inside, wide-open space greeted him there was no furniture only roof to floor windows and right in the middle of the room was a playpen with a baby inside a baby girl playing with her toys, feeling a pull steve moved towards the pen as he got closer he saw the very likeness of tony in the baby to her brown mess of hair and the brown of her eyes as she looked up at him giving him a toothy smile “Da Da” she giggled.
“Are they safe” T'challa ask Tony admired T'challa even when Barton family wasn't his problem he still cared to know if they were safe hell he had a whole country to run Barton and the rest of the Avengers weren't his problems but he still took them in along with Barnes.
“Just please get me the hell out of here” knowing and hoping he will never see this place again he let vision and peter walk with him out of the door.
Oh and the Wakanda meeting up next and what do you mean dying.
Taking masons pinky in his own as childish it may seem tony felt as if it was deeper than any promise that he had ever made “I promise with everything I have to my every breath I take, my heart and the fighting strength and will of my soul I will always protect you and I'll never lie to you no matter how hard it is or how sad and hurtful the truth will be, and I'll always love you my beautiful sunflower ”kissing Mason on her forehead and gently putting her in the crib looking down at the beautiful baby girl he swore to himself that he will never drink a single glass of Alcohol again he needed to stay sharp and  focused to protect her, no one and he meant no one will ever hurt his Baby girl not as long as he's alive she will be safe and happy
‘No, No, okay look i will have Friday give you all the details, report to you on how the visit and the drive went and ill even let happy drive again’ Tony said giving Rhodey the smile he knew could win anyone over, he needed to do this himself to prove that he could handle things on his own that he wasn't some helpless pregnant teen who got knocked up and depended on everyone for everything.
The redhead daintily made her way over to Danvers, the ladies automatically sliding into a relaxed sway, hands fitting over shoulders and hips. But no one was looking at that: all attention was firmly caught by the two men in the centre throwing their limbs out like the jitterbug had gone out of fashion, and they were determined to retrieve it from its shallow grave. It was shoddy, with jumps gone wild and kicks out of time-and Steve could hear Tony’s laughter above it all, clear and free-spirited and
Tony could feel the pressure between his teeth, at the back of his jaw – hard enough to splinter. “The pact was, only during an emergen–”
down those ideas, show the kid how they actually
“Course I do.” Tony’s in turn getting deceptively stronger, even though he wouldn’t stop looking at the blank screen. “Manchurian Candidate, remember?”
And Ross paused in response, for reasons undecipherable, his eyes scoping over Tony for several seconds. When he spoke again, there was no smile arrayed over his features like a production; but no hostility either. “Sometimes Stark, I wonder if you know yourself at all.”
“I know.” Natasha acquiesced. There were lines under her mouth, when she smiled – quiet and open and unpretentious. “I just like it here.”
of American civilisation, and you know I’m not comfortable with that kinda pressure.”
(So much of his work at the VA had been about leading the rootless vets to identify their own issues and problems. Flaws in their belief systems. Being honest to yourself took you a quarter of the way to recovery.)
Through glass doors, he could glimpse a shadowed space beyond, with shiny wooden floors and grey walls. The doors gave way silently with a push, Steve stepping through inside.
‘Still, warn a man next time, Merida,’ Tony hissed. He turned on his heels and walked back to the force field. He reached out and touched it with his hand. Nothing much happened. Yes, there was resistance, but it didn’t burn him, nothing melted, there was no fire, nothing. Tony took a few steps back. If this was just a wall, he could blow a hole in it.
Tony used his repulsors again, the green showed, Tony shot again, and the green showed again. But the green was everywhere. There was no hole. Tony tried again. He felt, but he could still feel the wall. Again and again, but nothing changed.
Steve swallowed heavily, looking away from the woman in front of him. 'My skills,' he answered softly. 'I had a customer who was into… rimming. I have done it before, but not often and he seemed.... unimpressed. I did satisfy him, in the end, but he didn't seem pleased. I felt bad about it. He paid for something I couldn't give him. I thought one not super happy customer was alright, but I still asked Cassandra and Julia for help. They taught me some tricks.'
'Yeah, but not today, you look terrible,' Sam said as he handed Tony the coffee.
Tony took a deep breath. 'He is not just another orphan boy. We've been friends for years and since six months ago, he is my boyfriend.'
'You okay with what we're going to do?' Steve asked. 'Because if you're not, we can pick another one. No problem.'
The Shield base was deserted. There was no one there except the dogs. They were fed though and there was fresh food in the kitchen as well, both for the dogs as for Clint an Tony. Clint cooked them a simple meal, while Tony went through all the information he could find about the genetically engineered soldier. There were books, maps, reports and pictures. Tony searched through all of it, but there was no info about the soldier or the dragon. It only described the path they would have to follow and about the outside of the building. Nobody had ever gone any further, no one had lived to tell the tale.
‘Maybe she just made a mistake and she meant you’re great for her,’ Tony said, a frown on his face. ‘Just go, and if it’s a guy you tell him ‘sorry mate, Pepper made a mistake’ and you leave again.’
'Why are you best friends?' he asked.
Sam, it had to be Sam. It was his only option. But how was he going to do this? Should he tell Sam? Probably not. He and Steve were really good friends, they'd talk about it. All Tony could do was slap that ass and hope for the best. With a bit of luck he wouldn't receive a slap in the face in return.
'Cut!' shouted the director and with that all the cameras turned off. Immediately everyone started talking and all the contestants wanted to try each other’s pastries. The director cut the chatter off and told everyone to go to the elimination room. Tony, Buddy and Mauro sat down behind a desk, Tony had the donuts in front of him and was munching on one, as the bakers lined up in front of them. The camera crew took their place again, and a few minutes later they were filming again.
'Yeah, sure!' the boy said, a bright smile on his face. 'I'll help!'
Clint was on the verge of tears when he heard those words. 'See, Captain America wants me as his sidekick! I'm going to fight alongside a real hero!'
'Could be better,' Steve said, coughing a little. 'But nothing broken, just some scratches and a tiny body.'
‘Shut up, Barton. Why do you even need this soldier, Fury?’ Tony asked. ‘If you’re going to do more experiments on him, I’m not even going to discuss this any further. If you’re going to lock him up here in your headquarters, the same. Super heroes aren’t allowed anymore. Why do you need him?’
‘NO!’ Tony shouted. ‘No, sorry, no, just come over as quickly as you can? It’s important.’
‘Others?’ Tony asked.
'I meant a mascot or something,' Steve explained. 'A figure that does cool sciency things. We can put it on the flyers, on the walls in the workshop, but also on the toolboxes. We can make it some superhero who builds himself all kinds of stuff to fight bad guys or something.'
'You have to practice your undercover skills,' Steve chuckled as he sat down as well and took off his heels. 'But you did okay. Did you notice anything about the other...employees?'
'The things you asked for,' Bruce said. 'Let me know if you need help.'
Steve laughed. ‘You’ll have to buy a bigger car.
'Are you hurt?' asked the man.
The rest of the plane trip passed in silence.
‘Don’t you want me to be happy?’ Tony asked. He started to get a little angry and he smacked the lasagna with too much force on his plate.
'Well, there is one thing,' the guy started. 'I had a job interview. Could you maybe give them a call to let them know it wasn't really my fault that I didn't show up? I might still have a chance. I think the lady was named miss Potts. I have her phone number in my bag somewhere.'
'It took us hours to get here by sled,' Clint said. 'The snow goes on for miles, you can't run that!'
‘Why don’t you go to a soup kitchen or something?’ Tony asked, one eyebrow raised.
‘I’ll take a look at what they got, you check if the spark plugs are affected,’ Steve said. He walked into the house and searched through the room where they kept all kind of equipment. Eventually he found some boxes with car parts on top of a shelf. Everything that looked useful he brought back to Tony.
‘Maybe we can make a deal,’ Fury suggested, just before Tony could storm out of the room. ‘I’d love to see you go, but your technology is useful and yes, we’re earning money. I have agents I need to pay.’
‘Alright, yeah, great, yeah, we can do that’ Tony said. He grabbed one of his cards and put it in Steve’s breast pocket. ‘Text me your address and I’ll pick you up. Friday, at seven. It’s a date!’
'I've got to admit that I'm very good at mouth to mouth, you might like it,' Steve shot back, with a rather flirtatious grin.
‘I’m really tired, guys,’ Steve said. ‘They have bedrooms here, right? I think I’m going to take a shower and sleep a little. Guess running took more energy than I thought. I’m really sorry about this.’
'Alright, listen up, we've finally got permission to work on Ronan's illegal prostitution network,' Nick Fury, head of one of the New York police departments, said. 'Our team will do the undercover part. Our job is to bring down the leaders, the pimps, not the prostitutes themselves. You have been researching this and you tracked people down. We know who we're looking for, but we have to catch them red handed.'
When a guy in jeans and a black jacket walked in Sam gave a warning. That was their man from uniformed police. Slowly Steve made his way towards the guy and smiled at him. He felt stupid as he tried to make his movements look seductive.
‘I’m sorry,’ Tony said. ‘That’s harsh. Couldn’t they let her in here as well?’
Julia started talking, more to Steve than to Tony, but that didn't matter. He was telling his story and that's what mattered. Steve was supportive, asked questions, and made sure Julia told everything. Especially names. It was really important they got Ronan's name.  Thankfully Julia mentioned him several times and even showed his tattoo. It was all the evidence they needed, all they had to do now is let these men write an official statement at the station. That would take a whole lot of convincing though.
‘What do we do when we find something?’ Clint asked. ‘Shouldn’t we search for the dragon together? I’m pretty sure we should fight it together. Or you on your own. You have an armor, you can’t get burned. Maybe you should just find the dragon and I’ll find the soldier.’
'When it cooled down I can help you fix it, if you want,' Steve offered. 'We might get it to work again, and then you can drive to a garage to have it properly fixed.'
'I don't know, crashing it wasn't that hard,' Steve answered as he sat down in one of the chairs.
‘Alright, alright, no need to threaten,’ Clint said, holding his hands up defensively again. ‘I’ll be on my way. What do you want me to tell the others?’
'Bisexual, like you.'
'Oh my God,' Tony groaned. 'I'm dead. She is going to skin me alive.'
'Hello handsome,' he said to Tony. 'Long time no see.  You've got your eyes on Julia, don't you? Wasn't I good enough for you?'
Steve sighed. He had tried begging before, multiple times, but he hardly ever got enough money to buy himself some food, let alone pay rent or buy the meds he so desperately needed. He could also do without the annoying comments and the scoffing when he asked people for some change. Sometimes people even pushed him away, though most of them were afraid to touch a ‘hobo’ like him. That hurt more than any of his health issues.
'Dragon?' Steve asked. 'You're calling Natasha a dragon? Don't say that to her face, she'll skin you alive. With good reason.'
Suddenly someone crouched down next to him and helped him picking things up. Tony looked at the big hands, muscled arms, broad chest, and the face of an angel. For a moment Tony's hands stopped moving.
Steve smiled at Tony. 'Thank you. I think we should go. I want to see the world.'
'Captain, we can't...'
'I want some of what they...' Tony said, looking up, stopping mid-sentence when he saw Steve. 'What the hell are you wearing?'
'Fuck off, can't you see I'm busy?'
'We were dumped in a van, with some others, who wanted to cross as well. After we crossed the border the van stopped and we were forced into another van. They separated the old from the younger people and brought us to an empty warehouse. I got separated from my sister. They raped me. I don't even want to think about the things they did to her. They forced me to sleep with guys.'
'That's what my boss told me,' Tony said as he put on his suit again. 'The castle doesn't really help, you know, it looks like something from a fairytale. Natasha is the dragon and you're the upgraded damsel in distress. Now help me get Clint out of her claws.'
'I can't believe people still think you're innocent when you can say things like that with a straight face,' Bucky groaned. He had been monitoring Steve that night.
Tony rubbed his eyes. He really wasn’t ready for this. Slaying a dragon and getting some super scary soldier from the arctic, no problem, but with an idiot like Barton, impossible! He wanted to strangle the man. Nobody would miss him, right? He should just do it already, grab one of his Iron Man gloves and shoot. No, that would blow a hole in his plane and he kind of liked his jet. Luckily the crew brought them food and that shut Clint up for at least fifteen minutes. Tony enjoyed the peace as long as it lasted.
'If you need me, I'm in the pool,' he said to Tony who was playing with his phone.
‘Thank you?’ Steve answered, not sure if he should take it as a compliment. ‘So, what’s your name? And who is the guy we’re looking for?’
Steve and Clint left. The moment the door closed Clint did a little victory dance. There was indeed an agent waiting who brought them to their rooms, on the top floors of the building. Steve gave a quick goodbye before he disappeared behind the door. Clint stepped into his own room. It was white and looked sterile, but it was worth it if it meant he got to be an official super hero! He hopped around in his room a little, checking all the cupboards, the bathroom and even under the bed. There was nothing, it was really boring. He watched TV for a while, but there was nothing interesting, so he decided to take Steve into the city for some dinner.
‘Yeah, I love red wine,’ Steve answered. He knew he had to act like Bucky, but Bucky didn’t like any kind of wine and this atmosphere was not okay for beer.
'Shit,' Tony muttered. 'What do we do now? You can't cycle, but you can't walk either. We should at least get you off the road. Is it just your ankle? Everything else is fine? You sure? I don't wanna accidentally hurt you.'
‘Thank you, Thor, you’re the best,’ Steve said with a bright smile before he and Tony made their way to the elevator.
'He is the guy I accidentally hugged this afternoon,' Steve confessed with a deep sigh.
Fury ignored the two of them.  'If it works out we're going to start other groups in other cities. The six of you are an experiment. As for introductions, you all know Iron Man and Captain America from the news, Natasha Romanoff, code name Black Widow, familiar with a lot of different fighting styles, Clint Barton, also known as Hawkeye, he is an archer, Thor Odinson, he can control thunder, and Bruce Banner, who sometimes changes into an enormous green rage monster.'
It was a perfect project. Not only would kids learn to love science and engineering, it also created a few dozen jobs for people who had seen too much during the war and had a hard time rebuilding their life. If this worked, they could make it bigger and start doing the same in other cities. It was just the best thing Tony ever came up with, and he loved the enthusiasm of the others, but he just couldn't listen to what Sam was saying.
'I thought you knew me,' Tony said with a grin.
Bruce was next. Bruce was his friend, he would accept it, but Tony warned him first. The scientist had a bit of a temper and you didn't want to be on his bad side. Unfortunately Bruce didn't let Tony slap his butt for no reason, so Tony had to tell him the entire, embarrassing, story. Bruce laughed at him, of course, but agreed in the end. Tony would ask Steve and Bruce to stay behind after the next meeting. It was all planned out, which made the entire thing even more embarrassing.
Tony's eyes shot open. 'With you?'
'Stefanie?' Steve asked. 'That's what I was thinking about, but I could be someone else if that's not fancy enough. Fawn or something.'
'Thanks, nice to meet you, Lauren,' Steve said with a bright smile, before he quickly changed into his dress. He didn’t forget his mission though. The guys didn't look like they were forced, but when he put his make up on, Steve noticed some of the guys had something tattooed on their arm. It looked like a hammer. Steve couldn’t see from this distance, but he could see they all looked  alike. He had to look into this. It was a lead!
‘I’ve been waiting for half an hour,’ Steve said. ‘I was a little tired when I actually arrived, but I’m all better now. Made some food too, if you guys feel like eating. There wasn’t much, so it’s nothing special, but it was a long trip.’
Steve was walking towards the reception building when there was a loud bang somewhere behind him. It sounded like a gunshot, but when he turned around there was only a car and a lot of smoke. He quickly walked to the car and asked the driver if he was alright.
'I think I need bigger wings. With these I will fall,' Tony agreed. 'And I have to practice on the hills. I'll run down the hill and the wind will lift me up in the sky and I'll be flying! You'll see! Maybe I should put a rope on the wings, like a kite. Do you wanna help? You can hold the rope and we'll run together! I gotta make new wings first, so it will take a few days. Will you come back? To hold the rope?'
‘I might have asked around a little,’ Steve admitted.
'My favorite subject,' Steve said as he showed the painting. It was Tony, not even halfway done, but it was definitely Tony.
'Whatever!' Clint huffed. 'You think he'd make me a legal hero when he can have Captain America? No way in hell, I don’t stand a chance. I doubt he'll hire anyone else. The Captain and Iron Man are probably more than enough for him.'
'Steve. Steve Rogers,' Steve answered.
Steve laughed. ‘Work related. Like you said, my contract is ending and I have a few ideas I wanted to discuss with you. Like Iron Man comics.’
‘Steve, I need a favor from you,’ James ‘Bucky’ Barnes said to his best friend.
‘Are you kidding me?’ Tony asked.
‘Great!’ Steve said. ‘I’m sure she will love it.’
‘Does your friend have a suit like that or isn’t he a super hero?’ Steve asked.
For the next two weeks they toured through New Zealand, following Steve's plan, visiting campsites in the area, seeing the most beautiful parts of the country. The nights were hell, but the days were the most fun Tony had had in a very long time. They climbed mountains, walked around the bluest lakes they had ever seen, and went whale watching. They visited the zoo to see kiwi, went shopping in Wellington and made a helicopter flight over the highest mountain of the country.
‘I’m Tony and it’s all about that guy over there,’ the guy said as he pointed to a group of people near the bar. ‘The one with the good looking woman who is fake laughing.’
'Too bad, I don't have beans,' Sam said. 'I don't have a fancy coffee machine.'
‘Normally you offer your date your jacket when they’re cold,’ Steve said, holding Tony’s hand a little tighter. ‘You offered me your sweatpants. Not the same, but still pretty damn romantic.’
"Which one?"
"Yeah, that's it. It was just an accidental small fire, no big deal. Iron Man happened to be nearby, saved everyone. "Kris clutched at the straw. "It's late. I'm tired, I want to sleep."
"I offer my life to you, to fight with you until my last breath, my old friend." Thor stepped out next, patting Tony on the shoulder.
"Nuisance! Cross space amnesia! Damn it!"
"I'm asking you and him, how did you come to light? For all I know, you are very good at concealment. He was very good at disguise."
"You punched him?" Tony interrupted.
“Yes. I mean, I feel the same way about you. It's cold and wet." Said Peter awkwardly.
“That means a lot to him, Cap.”
"Believe me, that bed has been unused for so long, it is cold." Steve wrapped his arms around the man who was running away. "And I miss you."
As the guard escorted Man-Bull to his cell, Tony turned to Steve next to him and said, "We should do a tally, count which group captured the most prisoners. I think the two of us will win."
"I don't want any more of that luck. He's a playboy, and I'm not interested in him." Said the golden-mask girl.
He has no armor, he can't get in touch, Jane had left in a Quinjet. I’m the one who caused him to be in danger without protection again. Steve hit the ground in remorse.
"He's not like Whiplash. Whiplash is a human. His whips are powered by his base. But Electro himself is electricity, he has already merged with it." Tony analyzed.
But Tony was not flurried. He said calmly,
"Trust me, I can handle it. Quickly, a lot of people are knocked unconscious by you."
"Oh, if I say I'm willing..."
The streets of New York City.
"Wait a minute."
"Little bastard, you have a temper, but your fists... Tut, tut, like cotton. Let me tell you what a real fist is."
“John, they're not good people. Those men with Italian accents are not nice people. Get a real job. The Great Depression is over. Everyone has gone to work."
"Tony, look at me. I want to ask you something."
"Since you've arranged a date..."
"This is a short cut. Next time you come, you can take this way that leads straight to my bedroom."
"Okay."
"Well, I think I'm still missing a little bit, and what else?" Jane said.
"Thank you for causing us to be locked up."
"It was meant to be his."
"You can think of it as my return on the day you let me go."
"I was just in a hurry." Remembering that night, Tony felt a little shy.
"Hey, girl, don't pay any attention to that bastard if you're smart!" Shouted a tall, stout boy with a cap askew.
There was no echo, the place beside him was empty. No need to read the message. It must be Avengers Daily. Tony rolled over on his left side again, landed on Steve's accustomed side. With the familiar smell, continue to close his eyes.
"I'd be honored to be the first to know about it." Tony said.
"So be it. There's one last thing I'd like to ask... Will everything be the same when I wake up? Will some people still be the same, in the same place... For example... You know..."
The policeman looked at these men knocked over, shook his head.
"I'm sorry I let you down." Tony said.
"All right, Doom, what do you want?" Tony said.
"These government officials who do nothing all day are just messing with our minds." Seth grumbled.
Tony's next words were interrupted by a bat. Tony was flexible, flashed across, directly holding the attacker's wrist, his thumb pressed the weakness on it. The attacker rictus, his bat has dropped on the ground. Then Tony made a beautiful over-the-shoulder fall, throwing him to the ground on his back while kicking the bat under his feet.
"Today seems to be back to the past, those happy days when everyone got together."
When he finally pushed open the door and looked at the bench they had just sat on, Steve was gone.
"I'm sure, Tasha." Steve glanced back at the Black Widow and walked out the gate, quickly surrounded by a group of reporters.
"I told you, I'm not doing it again. Don't go into education mode." Tony interrupted Steve.
"Young Master Anthony, Master Steve, good night." Jarvis said calmly.
"But I'm not him!" Tony said defiantly. “How about this? Let's make a bet. Tech VS. Fist. I'll wear armor and you use your old shield and fist. If you win, I'm going to take these courses. If I win, you cancel them.
"Really?"
He was falling, falling high in the air. A World War II fighter airplane shrinking before his eyes. He opened his mouth, shouted, but he could not hear his own voice, nor could he hear the roar of the propeller. In fact, he couldn't hear anything. Then he fell into darkness.
"I see."
"Would you like to dance with me? This piece of music is perfect for a beautiful girl like you."
"Okay, I'll call an ambulance on the Quinjet."
Thinking of his high-profile announcement of this "secret" just now, Tony blushed. He tried to cover up his embarrassment by changing the subject quickly.
A restaurant near Columbia University, New York.
"I can't stand you, artist guy. Don't you have any other hobbies than painting? Now... Well, I don't think you'll like the idea. You definitely do not like the idea, but there's no way..."
If it was the refraction of light that made Spymaster invisible, it was impossible to make him lose solid form. But he just vanished. Steve looked at Tony, and saw that Tony was not surprised by what had happened. He asked incredulously.
"Because you're so slow and I'm so bored waiting for you. I need to say something."
"Tony, calm down."
"He did say a bunch of weird things when he showed up, and now I remember what he said, 'Today I'm going to bring all of Manhattan to my white wedding!’.
Tony raised his body a little, kissed Steve's bare chest, then slowly kissed him down, past his strong chest, past his hard belly, moistened his navel...The sheet under Tony was wrinkled, rubbing the bare skin of the back. His head disappeared into the depths of the quilt finally. He found it, held it in his mouth, licked it around, turning over the folds with his tongue tip.
"Wow, Quinjet has this function." said Hawkeye, touching the crooked jaw.
"Actually, I think it's better this way." He held the picture up in the air and looked at it carefully. "It's a lot more lively with the addition of red. I love it. May I keep it?"
"Look, we're not that different. Because that's what I said." Said Doctor Octopus. "But then they brought up the New York City thing. You know that dimension black circle in New York City a few months ago. Because the power outage also badly damaged my lab. But you, Avengers are always the heroes after the event."
Tony didn't resist this time. Instead, he put his arm around Steve's shoulder and leaned on him as he walked. They passed Dr. Octopus, who was already creaking and sparkling in the doorway of the lab, and then they passed the ninjas and Zodiac agents, who were slumped various in the cave.
"What's the matter?! Can your spider sense no longer be more sensitive?"
Tony looked wistfully at Steve. I shouldn't have thought those things at that moment, I shouldn't have brought them to bed, but now... Tony put on his clothes, picked up his backpack as he spoke.
New York City, Secret Armor Base, four hours ago.
"There should be." Once again, Tony aroused desire, lying back in his arms.
Kris DeGann, Level A Contact: Tony, you haven't been to campus in a long time. Your friends are all worried about you. I'm worried about you. I haven't thanked you for the last time. Maybe we can go out together when you are free. As a thank you, let me buy you a drink or dinner.
"But ma 'am..." The security chief hesitated.
"Good morning, Steve. Did I miss lots of it?"
"Aha, these bad guys always come back!" Tony shrugged at the direction of Whiplash.
"At least you're not up to some evil plan this time, so count me in. Ouch!" Hawkeye got a kick from Wanda this time.
"Well, thanks to the bad weather in the UK, otherwise I wouldn't have had the patience to read the fine print of all the Avengers codes and understand the ‘hidden rules’." said Tony sarcastically. "I always thought saving lives was the first job of an Avenger. Apparently, the one who repeatedly told me the 'first task' and signed these agreements had a better explanation than I did. What do you think, Cap?" Tony put an emphasis on the word "Cap".
American Heroes Rescued, British Bears Silenced -- The Times
"Black Widow, this is Iron Man. Cap is taking care of his personal affairs, so don't call him unless Galactus is coming." Tony curtly interrupted, then added, "And Happy New Year, Tasha. Do you remember? It's New Year's Day. Who wants to have a meeting? No one."
"Better not make it too bad. I don't have much money to build a new one."
"Stay behind me and be careful not to touch anything." Steve walked in front along the kitchen counter, half bent, with Bucky following.
"Not this time. My cousin saw Iron Man and Captain America had a fight in Central Park about an hour ago." Said another.
"I didn't run away."
"Steve, no, not yet. There's so much grief now, it's getting out of hand. Don't drag me into the picture. So don't say anything mushy, you know I hate crying goodbyes."
"I surrender! Because my stomach hurts, ha-ha." The boy with dark curly hair was holding his stomach and laughing. "It was so funny! My stomach hurt with laughter."
Tony got it done easily last time, teaming up with Iron Man is more reliable. But as a newcomer, he doesn’t have a say right. Spider thought sadly.
"Then I will wait for you to take me back, my knight. Shall we talk till dawn or do something else? Surely you didn't just jump into my bed at midnight to talk to me about Beast?"
The next day, the Krats Magic Toys was as it had been before, grey and eerie, strange and horrible, with no customers.
"Are you still in love with MJ?" Tony suddenly understood.
Television footage cut to the entrance to the Avengers Mansion, where many protesters held signs that read:
What is the topic of that paper? Tony had completely forgotten about it. He added to the memo: Paper due by the end of the week, priority 5.
What's my reason for staying? Vaguely, Tony knew the answer, but he did not want to confirm it.
Decorated by Paige, the Magic Toy Shop had a lot of colors. She tied ribbons to the models and ornamented the shelves with shining stars. Steve put his painting in the show window of the shop. The decorations did help to attract some customers. Jarvis received them, none of whom realized that Jarvis is actually an Android.
"Have you met James? “
"This guy should be the last one." Tony took Man-Bull to the prison guard. "He hid out in a cattle farm. Let us have a hard time."
‘I’ll come with you, I’ve been in New York before,’ Natasha offered.
'I'll put Bucky on it,' Sam promised.
'Are you alright?'
‘I was kinda hungry myself,’ Steve admitted. ‘Takes a lot of energy, so I already had some, but there is more.’
'Tell me about yourself and what you're doing here,' the owner of the nightclub said.
Tony waited for his friend on the hill the next week and wasn't disappointed. Steve showed up with two big bags full of feathers. They all looked perfect, undamaged, ready to use in Tony's wings.
Tony flew up and started hitting the robot with his repulsors. Nothing happened. From the top of the building Clint shot two explosive arrows at the crawling machine, but they hardly damaged the steel shield of the robot. Neither of the two heroes could get through the exterior layer, no matter what they tried.
'Heeey, mister Stark, good to see you, man, thanks for coming!'
His company, Stark Industries, was taking over the world. Whatever kind of machine you needed, you could buy one with the Stark Industries name on it. About 60 per cent of all computer, phones, laptops and tablets that were sold were from Tony’s company. But they also produced laundry machines, hair dryers, microwaves and televisions. There were engineers that dedicated their time to creating hospital equipment and they even had a department for mechanical limbs. Tony’s stuff was sold all over the world and his factories were everywhere, giving people in many different countries jobs with proper payment.
Rhodey served dinner. He had cooked it himself, so Tony couldn't help but tell them about how he ended up in bed for a week after eating Rhodey's food last time. Luckily his cooking had improved and the meal tasted great. Steve complimented him several times.
The two blonds left, talking excitedly about their love for dogs and how these dogs were super cute and well behaved. Tony sighed. He dropped the armor and followed Natasha as she gave him a room.
'Perfect! That's a wrap everybody, time for lunch! See you next week,' Tony said as he got up. The others packed their things as well. 'Oh, Steve, can you stay for a moment?'
'Yes,' Steve answered. 'If I were alone right now, I'd probably go on this trip with her, maybe travel to the next village together and then we'd both go our own way again. I met a lot of really nice people that way.'
With a sigh Steve Rogers put on the jacket of the only suit he owned. He didn’t wear it very often, but he was invited to the opening of an exposition of an old classmate. Steve never really liked said classmate very much, but showing up in these galleries was good promotion for his own work. He had to make new connections and get to know as many people as possible, so maybe, one day, he could have an exposition as well. For now that was still a dream, and to be honest, he was a little jealous of his classmate.
Olivia took another sip from his water, fighting back tears.
‘No, just leave,’ Steve said from the dark.
They ended up in a cave where the water was really quiet. They hardly moved in their tubes when the guide told them to turn off their lights. As it became dark, hundreds of little green lights appeared on the ceiling. The glow worms were almost like stars, the longer you looked, the more lights you noticed. It was beautiful and Steve wished he could make a picture.
‘I live with two friends who were in the army as well, that’s how we met,’ Steve explained. ‘We’ve been through a lot. We didn’t have much money when we quit, so we decided to share a place. All of us make more money now, but it’s still nice to live with people who understand you and who you can talk to. You probably understand it as well.’
'Breathe, beautiful, no need to be scared, I'm here to help,' Tony said, as he sat down on the bed. He gestured Steve to do the same. 'I'm with the police, Manhattan department. I'm researching illegal prostitution. Is there anything I can help you with?'
'Then I'll promise to protect you from everything else. You can stay with me until it's your turn to rule the country. Now hop on!'
Steve sat down on the bed next to Olivia and wrapped an arm around his shoulders. He tried his best to comfort the other man.
‘Tony, I don’t know what you’re thinking about, but the meeting ended five minutes ago,’ Pepper said, waking Tony from his daydreams. ‘I made notes of everything that was discussed. Please read through them and tell me if there is anything you don’t agree with. Also, this is not happening again. If you zone out again during the next meeting I will embarrass you in front of whoever of this group it is you’re having a crush on.’
Steve changed into his pajamas and prepared the 'beds'. He unzipped the sleeping bag, so they could use it as a blanket together. The tent was so small they had to lie close together anyway. When Steve was done, Tony still hadn't changed clothes.
'Yes, I was born in the same year, there were only a few, so I was assigned to you.'
They both showered and changed into something without oil or paint stains. Tony drove them to Rhodey's place and they happily greeted their friends. They drank something together and caught up with each others lives. Rhodey told them about his job at the air force and his wife explained her new job at the hospital, while Tony said a few words about his company and Steve talked about his future exposition in a big art gallery in Manhattan.
'Why should you decide that on your own?' Tony asked angrily.
'Do you want to talk?' Steve asked. 'I've been through a lot of shit too and I know how nice it is to have someone who listens. I won't tell anyone, don’t worry.'
‘Can I sit on the back?’ Tony asked as he parked the car. ‘Because then I would like to try it.’
'It looks boring,' Tony commented as he picked up the slice. 'Like a regular slice of cake.'
'Steve Rogers, and I'm hitchhiking, so I don't have a car. Not enough money for a car. All I have is a tent. It's big enough for two, if you want to stay with me. Might be a little bit more comfortable than sleeping in your car. We could try to fix it tomorrow.'
After a few hours Tony checked his maps again. ‘We should have been there by now,’ he said to Clint. ‘We were going in the right direction, we had the right coordinates, it should be somewhere around here.’
‘Yes, I’m the only one, made it myself, actually,’ Tony said proudly. He loved talking about his Iron Man suit. ‘The technology is pretty new, but the guys you’re going to work for will help you to catch up with time. They’re good, but if they’re not, demand that I will help you, okay? I can tell you all about this new world!’
As quick as he could Steve ran to the man to see if it was really Redwing he was trying to hit. When he noticed the black and white wings and the blue belly there was no mistake, it was Sam’s budgie. The man who was trying to kill the bird was big and bold, but he had a grey beard. Redwing didn’t seem to care that he couldn’t make a nice little nest in the man’s hair, his beard was good enough. Too bad the guy didn’t seem to like the little bird.
Steve chuckled. 'I did, yes. But I didn't steal them. I got them from the people in the village, close to where I live.'
‘Oh, so it was a guy, huh? Was he hot?’ Bucky asked.
Tony gave his friend an angry glare. ‘It was love at first sight. The poor guy didn’t stand a chance, there were hearts in his eyes from the moment he looked at me. It had nothing to do with you.’
‘So I don’t get to take her home for the night?’ Tony asked.
For years they met each other on the hill to create new ways to fly. As they grew older their ideas got better. They looked at dead birds to see how their wings worked and tried to recreate them. They tried to copy everything, but it just wasn’t the same on humans.
‘Thank you,’ Steve answered, a slight blush on his face. ‘Since we’re using red and gold for this project, I thought Iron Man should wear the same colors, so I made a more detailed drawing in color.’
‘The guy at the bar, the one with the goatee, he thought I was a stripper and tipped me fifty,’ Steve said as he drank from his beer. ‘He felt bad when I told him I wasn’t and let me keep it as an apology. So vodka on him.’
Steve didn't have much, so he was done quickly. He helped Olivia with all his things when he noticed some of the other guys were pushing small packages with pills or white powder between their clothes. Steve wrote down their names in his phone and texted them to Sam. Maybe this wasn't the time for a drug search, but they could at least take the drugs from them. He was a policeman above all.
The paperclip once again helped him to get in. Steve stepped inside and closed the door behind him. The door was hidden from view by the stairs that led to the next floor, so Steve couldn’t see anyone and no one could see him. First he listened, then he looked, but there really was no one there. The entire room was empty. Steve couldn’t believe his luck! He got into Tony Stark’s penthouse! He actually did it! He could barely stop himself from doing a little victory dance. He had to focus, getting in was only a small part of this mission, now he actually had to steal something. Steve walked through the room, looking around. The television was a no go, it was way too big to carry downstairs. Steve probably couldn’t even lift it with his scrawny arms. But there was a Starkpad on the coffee table. It would fit in his backpack. He might be able to pay his rent if he sold that. There was a laptop on the bar that separated the living room from the kitchen. It wasn’t too big, he could probably grab that too. Everyone in this building was carrying around stuff like that, so it wouldn’t even look suspicious.
'Thanks for listening,' Olivia said. 'You're not forced to do this, are you?'
'Does that mean I can tell my story to you?' Olivia asked. 'About Ronan?'
'Me too, I got all the comics,' Tony confessed. 'I masturbated over his posters and watched all the porn about him.'
The moment Tony set foot in the changing room, he froze like he was struck by lightning. There was a very fit man trying to pull a super small white shirt over his ridiculous shoulders and pecs. Tony was sad to see the abs slowly disappear under the cotton. Time seemed to pass in slow motion, until all of the beaty was hidden and a cheery voice greeted him.
‘Okay, this isn’t working, Cap, do you have a plan?’ Tony asked as he landed next to Steve.
‘You have to help me,’ Bucky groaned.
'We'll navigate with the stars,' Tony said.
Steve told him he’d be there as soon as possible and Tony felt like kicking himself for yelling at the man. If he ever wanted to try asking Steve out on a date he would have to start acting like his usual smooth self again soon, because all he was showing now was an impatient, childish, bored, bossy kind of Tony. Not even Tony liked that Tony. He had to turn back into his charming self!
'Oh Tony, you know you have a special place in my heart,' Steve said, stroking Tony's cheek, making eye contact with Julia. 'You can always convince me to change my mind, handsome.'
Tony could still feel that aching thing in his chest when he remembered Steve's phone call to tell him his mother was going to die and that he wanted to tell her about their relationship before it was too late.
Clint looked up now as well, pushing his sunglasses down to get a better look. 'Is that a Captain America costume?'
'I want Tony and the guy who was monitoring him to talk to the group that has just left,' Steve said, ignoring the surprised looks of the prostitutes that had been his colleagues. 'Sam, take Bucky and talk to all these guys. I heard Nat is back, bring her into this as well, pair her up with Clint. Is Clint available? Let them take statements from these guys as well. Before you let them go give them coffee and a place to change. Not the bathrooms. I'm going to join Tony.'
Steve’s held his breath. For a few seconds he stood still, until someone bumped into him. He couldn’t believe it. He couldn’t believe that Tony Stark was waiting for him. Steve ran towards the other man and wrapped his arms around him. Tony grinned widely as he wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist in return.
'We could still end up without witnesses,' Bucky said. 'They're scared. We can't risk this without knowing for sure at least one of them is going to take this to court.'
An eight-year old Tony held the hand of his butler Jarvis. He practically dragged the man around, because he was so eager to get to play in the playground. Tony's parents were always busy, they didn't have much time for their son and playgrounds were childish, inappropriate. But Jarvis cared about the boy enough to let him be a kid, despite what his parents said.
'Hey, Tony,' Steve said, hiding behind the bushes as Tony walked to the door. Tony stopped and turned to his secret friend. 'You need magic to fly.'
Steve looked at the group, but he had no clue who Tony was talking about. None of the women really stood out and they all seemed to fake their reactions. But it didn’t really matter who it was. He just had to pretend to date this good looking guy and he’d earn two hundred dollars. Maybe tonight wasn’t so bad after all.
Sam walked back into the kitchen, muttering something about not being their maid, but both men in the living room knew he was only acting like it bothered him. Sam loved taking care of people.
‘Well, there was one thing that was hard to deal with,’ Steve replied. ‘We had to explain two little boys how it was possible that both Santa and daddy broke their leg. They were both very drunk, but you can’t say that to a six-year-old. We said that daddy was helping the neighbour with the Christmas lights when he heard Santa fall down the stairs. Daddy wanted to rush to his aid and fell of the ladder. I didn’t think they were going to ask why only dad was in the ambulance, but thankfully mom came up with a story about elves and Santa being magic and a broken leg couldn’t be a reason to cancel Santa’s most important day of the year.’
'You're one of the best painters here,' Tony said. 'Very nice. I like the skyline with my tower on it.'
'I don't want to leave you alone,' Tony said, frown on his face.
'Thank you, mister Stark,' Steve said. He felt incredibly hot and he hoped Tony wouldn't notice.
‘If it’s a hot girl and she and I have a spark, I’m not going to give her to you,’ Tony said as he fixed his tie. ‘Jacket or no jacket?’
'Most romantic thing a man ever said to me,' Steve laughed. He took the donut off his finger, put it back on the plate, and handed the plate to Tony. 'Enjoy them.'
‘Do you like wine?’ James asked.
‘You sprinted twenty-seven miles and when you arrived you cooked us dinner?’ Clint asked. ‘After twenty-seven steps I can’t even cook anymore.’
'So if I go out like this, people will think I'm an idiot that dresses up like some fictional character? I guess I should change then.' He dropped the comic on the table and walked out of the room. His happy mood was completely gone, his breakfast was left untouched on the table.
Before she could finish that sentence Steve had dropped everything so he could pull Tony into a kiss. It was short, but sweet and the way they smiled at each other told Pepper that they weren’t putting up a show for her. She couldn’t stop a smile herself.
‘Yes,’ Sam said with a heavy sigh. ‘Is he here?’
The trip to Manhattan seemed to take forever, and Steve was glad to get some air on his way to the gallery. The place was beautifully decorated for the event and smartly dressed people entered the building. Steve felt like he didn’t belong, but he put a smile on his face as he entered. He was handed a little flyer with information about the exposition, and a glass of champagne. Steve stuffed the flyer away, not really interested in the art, before he made his way through the crowd, looking for familiar faces. He only saw a few people he knew, so he went to greet them, hoping they would introduce him to the important people in the world of art.
‘Thanks,’ Tony said. ‘I love cars. Saved for a long time before I could afford this baby, but she was worth it. Do you like cars? Do you own one?’
‘Shut up,’ Tony interrupted. ‘I told you I work alone. I work alone because I like to be left alone. So you either shut up, or I’ll ask the pilot to crash this plane into the ocean!’
'Only to tease the hell out of you,' Sam joked. 'Now you two take your place. I'm going to make some photos of you. We'll put them on the special phones you'll get. They have a tracker and everything.'
Some of the guys followed the policewoman, some stayed behind. Steve elbowed Julia to make him go as well. The guy looked scared, but Steve smiled and whispered it was going to be alright. The moment they were out of the room, Steve stepped forward.
Tony laughed. 'Just leave it here, I know a few people who will love to try them. Sit down, tell me about the contest, would you like some coffee?'
‘Oh, so that is the difference between Tony and James then?’ Steve asked, a wide grin on his face.
Sam rolled his eyes, but let Tony in anyway. Sam walked to the kitchen, but Tony stopped in the living room, where mister muscly angel was sitting. The blond looked up and smiled when he noticed Tony.
‘He’s not here, miss Potts,’ Steve said from the kitchen, where he was cutting salmon. ‘Will you stay for dinner? It’s sushi night tonight.’
'I'm Steve,' the blond said. 'Nice to meet you again.'
Tony told the lady his sizes quickly before he continued to read the flyer. Walking, swimming, climbing and tubing. Of fucking course. But the flyer said it was also for people who weren't in perfect shape. Great, hopefully his 'no shape at all' would be good enough. He followed Steve outside where they dropped down on a bench in the sun.
‘Did you make this?’ he asked surprised. ‘Did you make an Iron Man?’
'Stefanie and I can help with that,' Tony said. 'Try to keep them calm, guide them through the right doors, so they won't end up mixed with the guards. We can do that. We just gotta make sure not too many have gone upstairs yet. We don't want to drag a bunch of naked clients out of there.'
'You're amazing, Stefanie!' Lauren said. 'An amazing liar. I can’t believe you’re a cop! I'm going to miss you.'
Steve sat down on the couch, while his friend got them both a glass of water. Olivia sat down on the bed and took a large gulp. He took a deep breath before he looked Steve in the eyes.
Being an eccentric billionaire wasn't as easy as Tony had thought. He couldn't just slap anyone's butt and it also had to be in front of Steve. If Steve didn't see it then what would be the point?!
‘ARE YOU STUPID?!’ he shouted. ‘I stood right next to that! You could have fucking killed me! You’re the most useless sidekick ever!’
'Ashley, tell us what you got!' Buddy said.
Tony was pacing through his office when there was a knock on the door and Steve walked in.
'No, I think you're cute,' Tony said. 'Okay, yeah, Captain America is hot, but, Steve Rogers is pretty cute as well. I wouldn't know which one I'd choose.'
Steve put the card on his nightstand. He was going to call first thing tomorrow.
‘It wouldn’t have been necessary if I had been on my own,’ Tony said. ‘Let’s move on. The quicker we finish this, the quicker we can go back again.’
‘How did you even know what flight I was on?’ Steve asked when they separated. They walked towards the parking lot where Tony had a car waiting.
Tony left. He had Happy drive him home, where he went to work. He had to finish that phone and now that he was home, he could do some actual work, where his hands were involved.
Steve didn’t have time to answer, because a voice came from his radio. They had to get on their way to an incident where someone might have been shot.
Tony was suddenly scared to hear Steve’s answer. He quickly shut the door and drank the rest of the coffee.
Tony hid his face in his hands and groaned. ‘So everyone knew? I’m going to have to fire all of you and force you to keep your mouth shut about it to the press. It was nice working with you, but the project is over. I’m going to crawl in a corner and die now.’
‘I can’t,’ Natasha answered, a smirk on her face. ‘I volunteered.’
'I can't say I mind,' he said with a small smile. 'I'm actually saved by my knight in shining armor! Are you shocked that true love exists, that magic exists, or that your true love is Captain America?'
Tony smiled. It was his first meeting with Steve. The first of many. Jarvis had talked to Steve's mother and they agreed it would be good for the boys to meet more often. Tony was grateful. His life would have been completely different without that simple agreement.
'I'm glad you had fun.'
‘No, we’re not going to do this again, are we?’ Clint groaned. ‘You know, Tony, I’m pretty tired as well. I’ve been driving that sled for hours, I’d like to sleep a little as well.’
'Come over tomorrow at seven-thirty pm and bring one of those outfits,' Ronan said. 'We'd like to see how you'll handle things. If you do well, my assistant will give you a contract. It's a shame I can't be there myself to see it, I'm out of the country, but Nebula rules this place when I'm gone. Good luck, Scott, I'd like to see you again. You're a nice addition to our club.'
Tony groaned. ‘Get out of my seat. If you’re coming with me, then not in my seat!’
‘It’s really too bad your own shirt is still dry though,’ Tony said suddenly. ‘I wouldn’t have minded seeing you in a tiny shirt.’
And there he was, on a motor bike. Tony recognized him even before he took off his helmet. No one else had a shoulder to waist line like that. Tony was about to run outside, but when he was at the front door his coffee kicked in: he didn't even know his name! It would be awkward and weird if he would run out without a reason. He needed a reason! Tony looked around, searching for something, anything that could make him go next door. His eyes fell on the coffee in his hands. That was it!
‘Did you really think you could just march into the apartment of the biggest tech guy in the country without setting off any alarms?’ Tony asked. ‘I have to say I admire your courage,  nobody else ever tried to get in here. I checked the cameras, you went through a lot of trouble for a guy who just wanted to eat bananas. You could have picked a grocery store, it’s a lot easier.’
Steve shrugged. 'I haven't seen you fight. The armor looks impressive, but I could stop you when you sneaked up on me. I'd have to see what your suit can do first.'
'Yes,' came the short reply.
‘There is something we’ve been looking for for a long time,’ Fury started. ‘Some agents found it, but they died on the mission and couldn’t report back to us. We don’t know exactly what is there, but we need it. You might be the only one who could get it for us, Stark.’
'So I heard,' Steve said, showing his brilliant smile again. 'Are you going somewhere?'
'Of course.'
They sat down in the slightly wet sand and started building. Soon they had a castle and a dragon and they were arguing who of them should play the princess. In the end they decided to both be princes and to slay the dragon together. With sticks they stabbed the sandy monster, until it fell apart and half destroyed their castle. They were about to build a new dragon when Steve's mother called him. For a few moments Tony was disappointed, he wanted to play some more, until Steve returned with candy. Tony's eyes lit up. His parents never gave him candy, it was unhealthy. Steve didn't have much, but he happily shared it. Tony gladly accepted. They ate it with their sandy hands, but it tasted better than anything he ever had before.
‘Maybe you shouldn’t have named a white and blue parakeet Redwing,’ Steve joked as he checked his balcony. The only bird there was a fat pigeon, no budgie. ‘Sorry, he isn’t here. Are your windows still open? He might come back on his own.’
‘So we know where we can get out again,’ he explained as he stripped off most of his clothes. It was incredibly warm with all the lava. ‘Not bad for a sidekick, right?’
‘I have to confess something too,’ Steve said. ‘And it will sound weird after everything you just told me. I’m not James Barnes. My name is Steve Rogers and James Barnes is my best friend.  Natasha got that blind date for Bucky, but he got himself a date with a colleague on the same evening. He begged me to take his place and go for him, so when things didn’t work out with his colleague he could take my place and date you.’
‘Three of them are broken,’ Tony said when Steve was back. ‘Did they have any spare ones?’
'Hi!' the young prince greeted the mysterious boy. He was pretty small and rather thin. 'You’re not really allowed in here. How did you even get in?'
Tony opened his mouth to say something, but then closed it again. He chuckled. 'You look at the wrong parts. You have amazing eyes and beautiful hair. You're stubborn, sassy, and strong, I like it.'
‘Stop yelling at my door and come in already,’ Tony shouted from inside. When Rhodey walked in, Tony came out of his bathroom. ‘I’m not that much of an ass that I would forget about your date. I still don’t know why I agreed to this.’
'I can try,' Steve said. 'I'll make something for the next meeting and  you guys can decide if it's good enough, okay?'
'Really now?' Tony laughed. 'Need to take a look at the real deal, so you won't accidentally make a mistake?'
‘It’s not,’ Steve answered, not intimidated at all. ‘It’s my friend’s bird. It escaped and I helped him look for it. It never attacked anyone before. So, how can my friend and I make up for it?’
'What?!' Steve asked, anger in his voice. This guy was a cop?! Did Fury think he couldn't do this on his own?
Steve's big wings spread widely. He moved them a little, like trying them out, before he jumped up and flapped his wings to lift them up in the air. He climbed higher and higher and Tony looked down to see how everything got smaller and smaller. Then he noticed something else: his father's army was climbing the hill. They had been on their way to get Tony, to kill Steve. The moment they saw the dragon they prepared their weapons. Tony held on a little tighter.
Steve used the eyeliner before handing it back. Olivia's arms were bare, so he quickly read the name on her arm. Ronan. It was written in very curly letters and therefor hard to read, but it definitely said ‘Ronan’. He could have known. Steve hoped Sam got a clear picture of it as well. It could be evidence. Olivia looked uncomfortable, so Steve threw him one of his blinding smiles before starting a simple conversation about make up. He is glad when Olivia responded and when Lauren interrupted them after a few minutes Steve was okay with that, because he made great progress.
He took a bite and chewed. It wasn't bad, not at all, but this was not what he had not asked for. He wouldn't eat this if it wasn't some sort of holiday. He swallowed it and put the rest of it back on the plate.
'Great job, man!' he heard Sam say in his ear. 'Guys, Steve is in!'
'I thought the fake titties weren't doing it for you,' Sam laughed.
‘Well, I… I had a great time,’ Steve said instead.
‘Deal,’ Sam said, a grin on his face. He knew that Steve really didn’t mind having the cute birds all over him. He was never going to grow out his hair.
‘See you Sunday,’ James answered as he opened the door and got out of the car. Right before he closed the door he looked around and gave Tony a sweet smile. Tony felt like he melted. He waited until James got inside safely, before he made his way back to Manhattan.
‘Nope,’ Clint said from the backseat. ‘We got tools and some spare parts though. Or I think we have, I don’t know a damn thing about cars.’
Tony stepped forward and knelt down next to Steve. 'I will take care of him, Mrs Rogers. He can live with me, no problem. I'm going to take care of him.'
‘You will be given a home, here in New York. You can train in our facilities and study here. Ask for whatever you need and you will get it. Money is not a problem. I heard you used to have a motor bike, so we will get you one, or a car, if you prefer. We’re not telling the public yet that you are Captain America though, so keep a low profile for a while, get used to this age. When we need you, the press will find out about you soon enough and we’ll tell them a story that they will believe. We found some rare footage of the forties with you in it and some documents that speak of the serum that is used on you. Speaking of it, we made you a new suit. Here is your contract. Take it, read it, and I expect it back by tomorrow, either with your signature, or with a note about the things you want changed. Any questions?
After that kiss Tony had given Steve a piggy back ride to the car. It had been the first and last time he had been able to do that. Tony went to MIT after that summer, so he could only see Steve during breaks. Tony remembered how he hardly recognized his own boyfriend when he came back weeks later. Same face, but Steve had grown taller than Tony and he had gotten a lot of muscles. He had looked so happy and healthy. He had grown from adorable to super hot. Of course they called each other every week, but the sneaky bastard had kept it a secret, to surprise Tony.
‘Normally I’m on my bike,’ Steve answered as he put his clothes in his locker. ‘I’m in the pilot with ambulance motor bikes, to see if we can shorten the response time. With my bike I can get through traffic easier. I don’t have all the equipment an actual ambulance has, but I can make a start and brief the other paramedics.’
Tony apologized for marching in like that, but Sam wouldn't hear of it. He was welcome to join them. They drank coffee, but switched to beer not much later. After Steve consumed almost an entire bag of chips they decided to order pizza. More beer came out of the fridge and the people who weren't playing were eating. Tony found out they didn't play any war games or first person shooters, and when he asked why, Steve explained they had both lost important people while they were in the army. Because of that they had met each other, but the games could trigger memories they'd rather forget. Tony apologized, but Steve waved his apologies away. These nights were to have fun and there was nothing wrong with playing Zelda games, right?
'It's hard to believe all those things really happened,' Clint said. 'Were you there as well, Nat?'
'Rhodey invited us over for dinner tonight,' Tony said as he entered Steve's work room where the blond was painting.
‘I love cars,’ James said. ‘But I have a motor bike, it’s easier to use in the city, I never end up in traffic jams. I can’t afford both a car and a bike, so I stuck to my first love.’
'I'm Lauren,' said the guy next to Steve. 'If you have questions, just ask me. I've been here for a few years already.'
Steve was flirting with a policeman when Tony walked in. Tony waved, a big grin on his face. Steve winked at him, before turning back to his 'client'. He did keep an eye on Tony though, to make sure he found Julia, until he noticed Nebula's glare. Steve quickly went upstairs and didn't see Tony anymore afterwards.
‘I do not have a crush,’ Tony stated. ‘But thanks for the notes, you’re an angel, you’re perfect, you know I can’t do anything without you.’
‘I do, Tones, and that is exactly why you should tell him,’ Rhodey said. ‘He is going to find out anyway, it’s better if you tell him about this stupid situation yourself and laugh about it together, before he finds out himself and thinks you’re have lied about everything.’
James agreed. ‘Yeah, sometimes you see things you can never wipe from your memory,’ he said.
‘Great job, now whatever dragon is in there, you woke it up!’ Clint shouted through the hole.
‘Yeah, unlike the blind date you are going to meet,’ Bucky said when he eyed Steve. ‘Really Steve, you look like an old man, take off those pants and wear the jeans Natasha bought for you.’
'I'm sure you look great in a negligee, but I'd be a terrible plumber,' Tony said. 'I'm afraid I can't make your secret fantasy come true.'
'Eh, yes,' Steve answered, insecurity visible on his face. 'You didn't know?'
Tony laughed. ‘You have humor, and that for an old man. Just keep working, so we can get into the plane and warm up. Maybe I should fly us to my house in Malibu. It’s nice and warm there.’
He walked out of the room and found Rhodey with a tray full of cups. He introduced himself to the man and followed him into the room with waiting guys. Tony was already there. He grinned when he noticed Steve.
Still Tony didn’t give up and started with the construction of the wings. He formed the outlines, making sure he could attach feathers everywhere, so there wouldn't be any holes. He made the wings big, really big, with several leather bands he could tie around his arms. Proudly he looked at his own work. He might be ten, but he was a smart boy, his teachers told him so very often.
The coffee shop was only a few blocks from his place, so he walked there. Steve came there often, he would bring his laptop and get some work done when Bucky and Sam were too loud again. It was fun to live with friends, but it was impossible to work when the two of them were home as well. Sometimes they were like kids, always trying to distract him.
Julia chuckled. 'Most new guys are nervous and we have to help them out. Within a week you walked around like you owned the place and became like a big sister to almost all of us. You helped us out so many times, I want to help you catch this asshole.'
A raster in the ceiling was pushed aside and a guy dressed in black and purple dropped from the vents, landing on his feet, a few meters away from Tony. He was wearing sunglasses and carried a bow and arrows on his back. The guy held up his hands, showing that he wasn’t there to fight.
'Our living room, bedroom, and my workshop are filled with paintings of me already,' Tony grinned. 'Where will we have to put this?'
'Sixty minutes!'
Bucky laughed as he elbowed his friend. 'That's what being hot does to you when you're a police officer. Now you get to dress in drag and be super pretty on camera!'
'I'm sorry to hear that Scott, but I'm glad to hear that our club has a good reputation,' Ronan said, obviously faking pity. 'But if you want to work here we have to see if you make a pretty lady.'
Tony wrapped his arms around Clint before he flew off.
'I have to bake?' Tony asked, fear in his eyes. 'I promised that? On television? No, no, no this must be a mistake! I don't even know how to turn the oven on! I'm not going to make a fool of myself on television again! Tell them I'm too busy.'
'I don't have magic,' Tony confessed. 'But I want to fly. It looks so cool! Like birds and dragons! I want to touch the clouds!'
With a heavy sigh Steve fell on his bed. He really didn’t know what to do next.
'No need for mouth to mouth,' Steve smiled as Tony stepped out of his dressing room.
'I know,' Tony whispered before he kissed Steve. 'I know.'
Steve laughed as well. 'No, but planes back then looked so different. It's beautiful. Last time I was on a plane I had to crash it in the ocean. Almost got myself killed.'
Of course a car was waiting for them as they arrived at the airport. Tony's driver brought a big one, so there would be enough space with three adults in the back. Tony himself drove them to Shield, Clint, Steve and driver Happy on the backseat. Steve sat by the window and looked at the magnificent city. Things had changed so much. Everything was flashing and there were lights everywhere. It was overwhelming, but Steve wanted to walk through the chaos. He couldn't, not yet, but after he met his new boss, he definitely would!
‘I can’t. I have a meeting with the director after you,’ Clint said. ‘It might take a while, I think he wants to see my abilities for himself.’
'You look, and sound, like you could use some sleep instead,' Sam said with raised eyebrows.
Meanwhile Tony stood in the hallway, his hands clenched, biting his bottom lip so hard he tasted blood. He had come to ask Steve out for dinner. Just something casual, just as friends, to get to know each other, maybe more, one day. He liked Steve and he was positive Steve liked him as well. Until he overheard the conversation between Steve and Clint. He couldn’t hear everything, they were talking softly.
"Steve?”
"Have you any proof, Tony? "Tasha said.
“Look out!" Steve was quick to take Tony, rolled over to the side of the street, ducked behind a car, and then rolled out of the car into a nearby alley. His movements were masterful.
"Well, I only lie to you."
At the time when they had been chatting, Tony's body had warmed up again with the little stroke, hardened underneath, and the fluid of desire had dripped down upon him, bringing more damp cravings.
Looking at the taxi going away, Spidy took a breath, stretched out his hands ready to launch the silk swing home to sleep.
"Can I talk to you for a second before that?" Wanda said.
"I've got it."
Chapter 00
"I literally sneaked into the hospital on foot from that building." Steve said innocently.
“What?!"
"It's not true, I'm not making it personal."
It had been a long time, longer than he had ever had sex with Steve, but Tony still didn't want it to end, just as it had been when they first kissed. He wanted it to stay in his body forever, so that they would never be apart. He wanted to take him away and everything they've been through, but Tony knew he couldn't, so he could only hope that time stops at this moment. But time was not a line. The past, the present and the future mixed together were just now, and he had only now.
"Well, Steve, bring back any old memories?"
"And snot, Peter."
“Steve!”
Though he covered his ears tightly, the sound of his mother's sobs reached his ears. They were arguing.
"Thanks, Clint. You did a good job, too. Nice shot." Tony said.
"I know."
"I've just told you a secret, a secret of my true identity." With that, Spider-man took off his mask.
At this moment, an electric light struck over.
After a while, Peter saw that Tony got up and left the room. Then there was a splash of water in the bathroom not far away. Peter breathed a sigh of relief, replaying the scene in his mind and quickening the movement of his hand... Then Peter fell asleep.
"And we haven't run into any emergency today."
"Not for nothing." Tony said. "After S.H.I.E.L.D. took him into custody, they confiscated the equipment at his lab, so they still have the samples. I've got the samples back. See."
"Maybe you should try to find out from outside the lab."
"Tony, where are you going? Don't do it yourself." Steve was going to stop him.
"I think you'd better let me out first? I can give you a hand." Said Spider-Man. Then he looked at the fallen guard, and added: "Or it's okay not to help you."
"If we hadn't attacked your base, foiled your plot, how did the black circle in New York disappear?" Tony said.
Even though it was three o 'clock in the morning, Tony was still wide awake. He got up, got out of bed, put on a coat, and slipped through the living room to the communal bathroom. Kris was still asleep when he came back from his bath. Tony turned on his wristwatch, put on his headphones, and listened to his voicemail message. He was not in a hurry now. He was even a little bored, so he listened to every unanswered message. Investors messages, Jarvis’s message, Jane's message, Wanda's message, Brennan's message, tennis coach, climbing center, high-tech exhibition, flower shop, the hotel, travel center, car salesman, estate salesman, encyclopedia salesman... After listening once, Tony listened a second time to make sure he hadn't missed a single message. Tony felt a little lonely in his heart. He manually adjusted the system, adding Kris to the S-level contact list. He turned on the strong light on his wristwatch, lit up Kris's desk, rummaged through the guest book, and then wrote a note with a pen.
The light was strong enough to illuminate the narrow corridor. There were several bloody tracks on the floor of the corridor, leading towards the door. It was clear that the person who had left the tracks had left the house. Krats went further into the living room. Joseph Rogers lay motionless on his back on the living room floor, his eyes wide open, his face smeared with blood. Krats crouched down and felt his breath. He was no longer breathing. He touched his wrist. His pulse stopped. He was indeed dead. The body was surrounded by shards of glass. Beside it was a round shield of red, white and blue, still stained with blood.
"Tony, are you all right?" There was anxiety in Steve's voice.
"Finally, you speak. Calling yourself in the third person, aren't you afraid of logic snafu that causes your program to crash". Said Tony sarcastically.
"As soon as I walked in, I was thinking... When is the right time for me to take you? I mean if the main character slips away at the beginning of his party..." Steve whispered in Tony's ear.
"Hum!" The leader took two more steps, the others closed in further.
"Is that so? What if I do this? Or this?"
"What is it?" Tony asked.
"Did you draw them? Lots of him."
Then Steve fell asleep leaning against Bucky.
"Not so much. A little."
Chapter 20
“What's the big secret?" It took Tony 30 seconds to realize. "You mean that. I didn't really want it to be a secret at all, at least not on the level of 'who I am'. It just happened, and I let it happen."
"And that is probably all. I transferred Doctor Octopus's commission from Zodiac." Tony lay flat next to Steve, and spoke to the ceiling. " I have to stay in the lab all the time. You know the rest."
"Can she? We're on a street in Washington D.C." Tony replied with a shrug. He had already converted the location of the ID card, he said confidently.
"My name is Kris DeGann, I'm here to bail Tony Stark." A girl with short brown hair, shiny brown eyes, wearing a jacket, jeans and sneakers, said to the police.
"Why? I'm just a human being..." Tony looked at Steve. He really didn't understand.
"Like this, or that?" Steve whispered in Tony's ear as he unbuttoned his belt, half dropped his pants, and stroked between his legs. Tony's body became gripped by desire.
"Well, let's go."
The golden mask girl's words had been ringing in Tony's ears ever since he came back from the uninhabited Island. He tried to shake it out of his head.
“Thank you for bringing him back yourself.”
"Wow, she's so beautiful. Can I keep it?"
Walking down the gloomy corridor of the prison, Steve asked with a serious face.
"I'm glad you like it. Now let's go inside and I'll help you with your shirt. I'll make sure it's clean."
"Do you need any help, ma 'am? It looks like you have got a few injuries."
"I'm sure they will continue to complain about us for many years." Tony answered with a shrug.
Then Steve walked calmly into the vortex. All the while, Tony watched his red, white and blue back disappear into it.
"I'm sorry, Bucky, I was so scared. I'm not as brave as you are. I can't beat him. I can't beat anybody. I... Will you despise me for being only a coward?"
"I can go with you." After recovering from the loss, Steve dragged Tony. He doesn't want to separate now.
Avengers Mansion
"Say what you will. I mean, after tonight, nothing's going to change between us, right?"
"Something like that."
Peter bent over and picked up the little girl, who put her arms happily around his neck. Then Quicksilver and Crystal came along.
Tony shrugged and replied, "I've accepted the fact that I'm not him. It's no use being hard on myself. I can't solve problems his way, so I'll have to use mine. But no matter what, the sun will rise tomorrow and life will go on. Tony Stark's life goes on, Iron Man's life goes on. At least I'm trying to keep them both going."
"You help me recall. I am under pressure now. I can do nothing."
"This bump isn't air turbulence, is it, buddy?" Said Spider-Man.
"Stark’s dead. Why is his hired hand still here?"
"That... Hm... Snowstorms! Yes, it's a blizzard. They need Tony back to help make the weather controller."
These sensations whetted Peter's lust. As he watched himself roll out of bed, walk to Tony, embrace him from behind, bend down and kiss his neck, kiss his bare body, kiss every inch of his skin... take him by the hand of rubbing desire, put the force upon it... let him follow his gift, groan and gasp... let him release, let him sprawl in his arms, powerless and content.
"You mean you're going to help me stay at this age?" Tony could not conceal his delight.
After thinking about it, he added: Call Maria Foundation to restore Central Park, priority 4; Fix Steve's shield, priority 3; Build an old fashion motorbike for Steve, priority 1.
"I told you Cap wouldn't lie."
'I'm not him! "Tony concluded angrily.
"Well..." Tony's stomach growled unseasonably.
"I will prove it, I will, Sunset. But first I will prove my worth in your bed."
"What? Tony."
"Start at the beginning."
"You got it; I did." Steve shook off his sadness and laughed.
Steve got it right on the second try, the
, perhaps into the background, perhaps somewhere else. The last time he’d watched one of Tony’s videos had been of that ill-fated, infamous birthday party-
“Wanna tell me about the interesting things you’re looking at?”
- that being a fun and supportive….fucking
T minus fifteen.
(even if there was almost no doubt about what was waiting for him at the other end, a nightmarish landscape of snow, metal, blood and betrayal).
ha, Steve was just cheating off of him now-
And it’s strange, how they fight and fight and fight (though a little lesser these days) on every topic under the sky, and yet this is the one place their minds seem to meet. Flowing together, parallel streams-poetry and metallurgy.
His fingertips tautened on the rim, white as bone. He tightened his jaw, dug the fucking piece of metal into the stretch of floor before him, leaving a groove, bearing some weight- and staggered on.
The creeper wheels squeaked as he moved a couple metres back, the suspension chains hooked into the Mark XVII’s pauldrons gleaming mutedly in the light. “The things that I like are rarely the things that I should do.”
“We won.” She breathes, and Tony thinks deliriously
That…that flicker of an expression could almost be called a smile. “If you remember, Mr Rogers, I fought
SHIELD told you to stay silent, and wait for the captor to begin the conversation. More information to be gleaned, that way. Army told you to say nothing at all, except your name, rank and serial number.
Steve smiled. His weight shifted forwards, bobbing on the balls of his feet, eyes watching the light that had just turned yellow. Any second now.
“Because.” Steve repeated, and those eyes had never looked less like a liar’s. “Because you are my friend.”
Apparently.
A shadow flies by overhead, accompanied by a very familiar drone. Tony resists the urge to sigh. Goddamned Doombots.
His voice was quiet, but immoveable, all traces of apology erased. “You said it yourself, Clint. You made your choice.”
Okay, he was making some progress in this direction. He was approaching the fringes of the-no, shit. The sidewalk was cordoned off by rope, the way cut off by a large Cadillac occupying the space. Down the road, he could see an entire parade of cars lining both sidewalks: a Packard 180 just adjacent to the Cadillac, a blue Nash 600 a couple of doors away. The Cadillac currently in his path was a Series 62; Mr Demero had had one of those, gleaming turquoise body and cream roof. And there it was, in form if not in colour, transported straight out of nineteen forty one: perched on a Melbourne sidewalk, with a
“It’s a
It went without saying that this address wasn’t exactly public knowledge (though he’d made a very literal address public knowledge before…ah, old mistakes. Never quite stopped tasting bitter). If it had made its way through his filters, then there was nothing malicious in it either- no concealed virus hoping to take down his private framework, hacking into the Iron Legion. It was safe to open the video attachment. Though of course, the last time he’d viewed one-
-“ and Tony could feel his lips curve up as naturally as anything, god- Peter reminded him how easy it used to be.
“Yeah yeah, I’ve gotten the party line, you can see yourself out now.” Tony muttered. The forgotten water bottle was sweaty in his grasp.
“There’s nothing to be scared of, Tony.” And Steve’s jaw softened, lines of severity melding into the sunlight streaking across his face, eyes glimmering in faith and voice ringing steady. “Not when I know people like you.”
Play.
Ah, those innocent days when Peter would rather spontaneously combust than use the a-word in front of ‘Mr Stark’. Tony pinched a scrap of cheese from Peter’s plate, the latter barely blinking an eye. “Well, who told you to enter holy matrimony at twenty-one, then?”
Steve opened his eyes again, and dully noted that he’d have to acquire a new laptop.
“It’s not weird.”
“Kid….” Steve began, then winced halfway. The churning deepened. “Clint missed one of the kids’ birthdays?”
enough to think that he was the only one suffering from the quiet?
“I’m not taking care of you.” The words escaped too fast, too direct. Tony watched the waving hands still, the light in Peter’s eyes shutter.
The mattress dipped behind him; Steve had moved closer. His voice was calm, careful. “You think we waited too long?”
“Why, a leader took up the cause of course, as one always does.” Stark lowered his chin, stared at the light emanating strong and clear from his own chest. "We’ll call him…Captain America. He steps out of the annals of glorious history…looks around the world today, and he doesn’t like what he sees. The rampant destruction, the breaking of sovereign laws, the unchecked power, the sheer presumption and
And despite the impassive faceplate, expressionless and wrought of titanium, despite the voice modulator…Sam still heard it. The lightest, most delicate touch of contempt on War Ma-on Rhodey’s words. “Rogers and I can handle the civilian evac.”
.” He bent down, hands feeling about wildly for several straining seconds before finding it and seizing it off the floor. Several seconds of silence fleeted by- nothing registering except the heartbeat drumming in his ear amidst the almost feverish concentration of trying to bring the recording up as quick as feasibly possible.
It was a sharp, sharp jab – Steve heaved a breath and laughed with it, laughed till his eyes were faintly blurring and his chest hurt. Straightened up, meeting twinkling green eyes that he’d thought once upon a time, were cold and unreadable. “You’re not getting off that easy, Romanov.”
“Captain?”
But that was it, wasn’t it. Honesty was a privilege; Tony had been schooled in that fact by now.
Tony cut the repulsors. He landed on his feet with a squelch, boots sinking through the silt and water lapping at his ankle guards. The absence of the steady whine in his ears made the rain echo louder.
Air rushed into his lungs in a desperate surge, of a sudden, and barely a second passed before Steve was flinging the device to the side and scrambling off the bed, stomach twisting uncontrollably. Not five minutes later, his forehead was propped against the smooth porcelain of the toilet seat while his mouth retched; throat pulling out every remnant of food he’d swallowed in the last six hours and more besides. Disgorging every substance in his innards, it felt, till his body was hollow and flopped over the bathroom tiles, breathing harsh and vengeful.
The Bentley toppled over to its side to cut off Tony’s path, impact juddering through the air as it lost further balance and flipped completely to flatten the Lambo next to it. There was a shard of… ow ow
“So, that’s settled.” Rhodey’s eyes flicked to the side, words pushing his way right through, the stubborn dickhead. “The UN are not green-lighting our little side mission though. Not with the world’s attention it’ll bring. And as awesome as our flying robot suits are-”
“As much as I appreciate you taking your leadership pointers from LinkedIn,” Tony felt his lips relax into a smile, inadvertently gentle. “It’s really not you, and it’s most definitely me.”
“Was that an ‘old, useless relic’ dig?” Tony approximated a glare to the best of his ability. “And after all I did for you when you were a midget.”
is what the UN wants us to go help with.” And the diagram of the ocean heaved up, the holograms shuddering in place, long ripples originating from the centre and cascading outwards. Tiny figures appeared alongside the circular lines, seismic readings gone wild.
(Two scenes, playing in symphony behind his eyelids. Captain America and the Winter Soldier dueling it out on the ramparts of a falling Helicarrier; him and Nat throwing desperate blows within the bowels of another one, the entire memory filtered through a cool wash of blue.)
Steve stared at the helmet, the doomed words making their way out of his mouth forlornly. “I don’t understand.”
Tony wasn’t listening to this. He refused to. “Do
have agendas, Steve!” Tony clearly had no such compunctions, because up the hands went, and twisted through his dark hair, leaving a mess behind. He took a challenging step forward, almost daring Steve to bristle. “Tell me that this mess with your
“I have a few of her effects. They must’ve heard, already, but someone should tell them in-person.”
“It’s stunning.” Tony said unthinkingly; and fuck backseat designing and banter and Rhodey’s smug little smirk anyhow, because it
“Fourth.” FRIDAY corrected, starting up the morning headlines in a helpful feed on the mirror-screen instead. “Miller commented on the call that at this rate, the very least I could do was go to dinner with him.”
Morning was fully upon them, the first rays of sunshine rendering Manhattan too bright to look at; glass towers and steel facades aglow with light. Though they were crouching partly in the shade of Avengers Tower, a small patch of yellow-gold had begun to make its away across the bridge of Steve’s nose, contrasting with the unfair brilliance of eyes that wouldn’t stop looking at him. Steve wouldn’t stop looking at him, and Tony spared a moment to wonder if Steve too had acquired fluency in Tony’s masks; just as the passing years had necessitated Tony’s ability to peer past Rogers-branded righteousness.
“So you don’t think that all that’s best of dark and bright meet in DUM-E’s aspect?” It’s a very, very shabby joke, but Stephanie is smiling a little tremulously and looking shaken for reasons Tony can’t yet comprehend. He still can’t stop smiling.
“Seemed to work for you just fine.” Peter returned automatically, his eyes widening at his own audacity a split second later. “I mean-”
, differently-“
And here was where he had to thank Sam again, because it would have been more than a little humiliating to ask Tony to clarify what he meant by that. But there was no time to think about that, because words were brimming up frantically in Steve’s chest-
He’d thought he was going to blow it up large, hang it in the penthouse foyer when all the Avengers eventually moved in. Hah.
“I do, and his wife is there, and his kids are there, and nothing is going to happen to them.” Stark’s mouth twisted, like the assurance burned. Or the fact that he’d had to make it. “Or to him, if he goes back and keeps his head low. Besides there…there’s someone waiting there for him.”
There was a dilapidated shelter just before the irrigation drain, on the far end of the field, barely more than four bamboo sticks entrenched in the mud with a pile of hay slopped atop with a prayer to high heaven. It was this structure that Tony made for, slow and inexorable. When he finally ducked his head and stepped through, the clamorous beat of rain against gold-titanium faded to a muted roar. He turned.
Steve Rogers, of the I-was-the-weirdest-thing-created-by-science, absently-patted-Butterfingers-on-first-introduction, considered-Tony’s-arc-an-interesting-accessory variety, was apparently arse over dick
Next part: Tony and Steve finally meet.
“You’re not a team player.” Rhodey said, and Tony’s chest pulled in painfully one more time. “You know that?”
“You bet your ass it is.” Rhodey grinned, speckled skin of his jaw creasing into thousands of tiny lines. “Damn, you should’ve seen the project before I came on. The previous guy put the engines in line with the centre of mass, to avoid asymmetrical torque, which worked well enough until one of the engines went boom at high latitude–”
A building whine climbed through the air, like systems coming alive to full power. A
“Between you and me, again, I think he’s worried he’s lost a bit of his mystique.” Tony yawned, covering his mouth a little belatedly. And it was just four in the afternoon too, fuck this shit. “I told him on a mystique scale from Homegrown Hawkeye to Sorceror Surly, he was a–”
It was only time before he met Scott, after all. One extra Particle than he had, one trip to the forties and back – and his self could be spared the pain of thirty years in the ice.
His brows were beginning to pull down, a crease forming above the bridge of his nose, his hand twitched with the urge to fast forward to the end of the recording; to see if there actually
“So do you, don’t you Steve?”
leave a crater in the wall- and he’d broken enough things for a lifetime.
The office itself hadn’t changed much, except for possibly being barer and stark-er than it was the last time he’d dropped in – and that was stark with a small
“I…I don’t quite know, J.” His voice had never sounded this hoarse. Had it? Maybe Afghanistan. Fuck, he hated deserts. “I had memorised the coordinates, but the suit’s dead and I can’t seem to remember them right now.”
Charge. Blast. Charge. Blast. Two at the neck joint (cracked like eggshell the last time, so easy, so pathetic), three at the knees, two concentrated pulses right at the centre. Charge. Blast. Blast.
“You’re right, it isn’t.” Tom turned around and took two steps away, large frame hiding what his hands were bustling over in the corner. “I’m not wearing a cape.”
Tony glanced up, eyes wide and surprised in response; then seemed to recoil into himself. “Doesn’t matter.” He flung out, all pretences of humour and restraint gone. “You’re still as unprepared to compromise as you were months ago, Rogers; don’t even dare to pretend any different.”
. “Why, you gonna look me up online? Hunt through my Facebook profile, epitome of the lazy modern-day stalker?”
He winced, looked down- to see callused fingers pressing into purpled skin: there was a line of deep, vividly dark bruises congealing in a thick line, neatly bisecting his chest- darkest near the heart. His eyes clenched shut almost immediately in response, but then the nightmare images came back: Obie’s bald pate, mouth snarling and flecked with spittle, short and stubby fingers stretching towards the arc reactor except then the fingers started gleaming silver and metallic and-
Five more steps and they came to a stop, feet sinking slightly into the muddy sand. Steve began by folding his knees, then gingerly bending at the waist-Tom holding his arm up all the while. The grip slackened and Steve hit the ground with a thump, the impact thudding up his tailbone, all the way into his spine. He stretched his legs slowly, heels drawing vertical lines into the roughened sand, arms drawing back with scraped palms resting against the same gritty ground. The supporting touch left his arm, and Tom settled himself by his side-legs folding comfortably into lotus position, like it was his front porch. Steve supposed it was.
.” before he threw himself into the same well of memories he’d just clawed his way out of, except this time he had control. Just to prove he could, despite fear and trauma and hurt and everything else, the reckless bastard.
(Wow, real subtle right there, brain.)
Tony leans over, and flicks the cover of the folder open. Steph’s features are still pulled into a glower, marked by ill-disguised frustration (over a freaking bagel. Really, this was just getting ridiculous), but she chances a look down. Then she looks again. And keeps looking.
“Because I’d rather not explain to my wife that I was over an hour late to my ten-year anniversary party looking for my lucky Black Widow cufflinks.” Peter was emitting at the rate of approximately five words per second – impressive really. Moments like these, Tony kinda got why they called Peter his spiritual heir. Also – holy shit that was MJ stalking through the crowd towards them, resplendent in red and calmly murderous.
“Tony, you’re gonna leave bruises.”
For saving the world, apparently. And Bruce did it again and again and
“Tom.” The man said, an unfamiliar accent licking at the tail end of the word. He placed the little clay tumbler carefully on a stool a couple of paces away and turned back around, corners of his mouth upticking into something reassuring.
Moisture was beginning to pepper his face- from the rain, ocean spray or the air itself, he didn’t know. Steve pressed his lips together, tasting water. “The other things, that you remember. What are they?”
Natasha stilled. Behind the shield of banter, the fond, biting grin – Steve could see now that her eyes were too bright. Gleaming with a layer of something liquid and unspilled, eyes reddening – streaks crawling in from the corners, overwhelming the whites. “Yeah?”
The conversation kind of degenerates to a whole lot of bullshit after that. Thor tries to take it back to him and his epic thrice. The third time, they actually let him get through a fifth of it. Clint sniggers at every line that could be an innuendo. Which, considering that every third line begins with
It was all silent, all still. Ash caught in mid-air, immobile. Weapons thrown and not yet landed. Snarls on unmoving faces, bodies contorted into the fight, friends and enemies all stretching around about him. Frozen in time, and Steve a man out of it.
“You were supposed to be here an hour ago.”
“I’ll find them.” Steve affirms. Clint nods, and walks back to the van, where Cooper sticks his head out of the open windowpane and gets his hair ruffled teasingly for his efforts.
.” Steve cut through unconcernedly, like his default good manners weren’t good enough for Tony. “It’s strategy based. I can tell.”
of War Machine’s boot as he stepped forward and just a little in front of Iron Man, sightline to the arc reactor severed abruptly. Saw Steve’s shoulders padded with Kevlar curl in, just half an inch, as he made the same realisation. “Iron Man has the exact location, Falcon can fly over with him to check it out.”
He actually doesn’t think it until they’re halfway through their fourth battle as Avengers. (…fourth. He’d never thought he’d stick it out this long. He never thought his...battlefield promotion, in a way, to a fully-fledged Avenger would actually hold). But Tony’s executing a barrel roll in some unglamorous dockyard off the east coast, and he’s about to blow the heads off some automatons on the downward spiral when the afternoon sun glint off vibranium almost blinds him.
“You’re inhaling the skin cells from the feet of your great-great-dead grandpa.” Tony observed, if only to drown out the death throes of the mattress squealing under Peter’s knees, and the specs in his head that couldn’t seem to stop-
But he was starting to think that maybe that wasn’t the only important thing that happened that day.
Steph isn’t even
“Like…like stainless steel.” Tony stammers over explaining himself, but Steph keeps nodding encouragingly like the angel she is. At least he hasn’t fallen over his feet like the four other morons they’ve crossed paths with today. Steph is wearing shorts.
“After everything that-after us.” His words were dropping like rocks, ill-hewn and utterly unsatisfactory. Clint moved his eyes to Nat’s, willing her to see. The missions, the blood. Fury, Hill…Coulson. Homes and hidey-holes, enemy bases and foreign cells. Mind control and ledgers and books read out loud. “I’d never blame you for the way you think. For not thinking like they wanted you to.”
Tony watched the man in the mirror, and told him what he already knew. He was currently crumpling up the evidence in his hand, shoving it down his pocket for the next time he’d need the reminder.
and tilted about its axis: a merry, merry, merry-go round. His head hurt, his neck even more so. The suit was so heavy.
“Chatting with Mr. Patel at the bodega three miles away. Helping Wanda control her powers.” It was like feeling the dark give way, lightness stealing in – till his vision was wrecked with it, till keeping his eyes closed was no longer an option. “Morning runs with Sam. Sparring with you.”
Tony swallows past his mouthful of bagel and chokes a little; Steph slaps him on the back with ridiculous force, eyes glimmering in amusement all the while. “Well?”
Another whirr, and Steve watched them in action again- except the distance covered this time was too short to leave a trail. A strangled sound of pain slipping through the white noise screaming in Steve’s eardrums- Bucky, Bucky, that was Bucky, Bucky biting through his lip in pain as he landed flat on his stomach; but all of it was overlaid by a voice, words paring through Steve’s brain, almost hysterical in their calmness-
governmental control…but then Tony was the closest friend he had, and Steve tried to imagine his reaction on finding out that Steve had disabled the suit; hell, him
There was another tempting little cheesy strip hanging out the bottom fajita, Tony’s fingers were positively itching. To cheese or not to cheese? Gah, who cared, you only lived an average of four times, being a caped crusader. And so through a mouthful of snatched dairy and more than a little beef: “The main thing, and don’t you think I haven’t noticed you avoiding it with your ten-dollar words – you were supposed to be here an hour ago.”
So i couldn't find a mutant that had the powers i wanted so i made one ill be adding to the tags soon and Btw
“Where is she Rhodey,” Tony asked he wanted to see his baby girl he needed to see her after waiting so long and almost losing her he needed to make sure she was safe with his own eyes.
Sitting with the president a long time ago Rhodey would have been honored to be here but now after being here for some time all Rhodey wanted was to go home to Macie and tony, he had gotten to talk to the president from time to time but he was always cut short when he had gotten to really talk to him about the reason he was there in the first place and to tell the truth it was starting to piss him off so today he was going to make sure they talked whether the president like it or not.
Tony handed the phone to T'challa who looked it over it was just an Ordinary phone plane and simple untraceable no less, he would have gone for the stark phone but if ross did find barton and his family one way or another he couldn't be able to link tony to them.
‘No your right I’m no mason, but I am a part of her you may call me Enigma” Enigma said it was strange to hear mason voice but knowing it wasn’t the little Macie he knew was disturbing but he was curious “I can see your mind working professor you want to know what I’m doing here and why I am here and I’ll gladly tell you”.
Laying on the cold hard cote tony thought of how much his life had changed, while in Afghanistan he found a purpose to fight to save people that needed it the most and where he found love with pepper although they are no longer together ever since Ultron they still loved each other, she just couldn't be with him as long as he puts his life in danger by being iron man he couldn't blame her he already hurt Rhodey when he fell from the sky.
“please don't talk about puking right now my stomach is already turning"Tony groaned” I know everybody is worried but I'll be fine I always am". As Tony lay back down again he added "if it gets worse I will go check it out okay" closing his eyes hoping he would get some more sleep he heard a soft thank you from rhodey before he drifted back to unrestful sleep.
It wasn't the first time they were requested the Avengers were on a mission when the throne was   taken over by Erik killmonger and only Arrived back when it was dealt with T'challa had informed them that he was going to reveal Wakanda to the world and it may gain unwelcome attention so they had to be more careful about how they deployed their missions he was just glad they were able to continue that T'challa understood the need to be able to protect people from harm so he didn't ask or even imply them to stop even with the amount of harm it could do if they were caught which made him, even more, determent to not get caught.
“Come on Mason, it's dinner time, you want your food don't you nice yummy yum in you're tummy” Tony tried to coax mason out of her hiding place but he knew she wasn't going to fall for it since she hasn't fallen for it the other times they had tried it.

“ professor Xavier yes thank you and please its tony Mr, stark is my father, and thank you again for agreeing to meet with us there is something important we need to discuss,” Tony said as they shook hands“ in private ” he added looking at the other mutants that had come with Xavier.
“Hay hay I know that look, I'm fine, great actually, so don't worry, take a shower and we will go and if it will make you happy then happy will drive” Tony smiled as he stood patting Rhodey on the shoulder.
“A puppy” Tony mumbled as he watched her work he knew she had wanted a puppy but tony wasn’t an animal person and even thinking about hair on his clothes makes him want to scream “What about your friends”.
“implantation of a womb in the lower part of my stomach” Tony said numbly he didn't want to explain it but he could understand the curiosity he just hated the feeling of being observed, “I don't know exactly how they did it so I'm sorry I can't explain more”.
What did frighten him however was that he was going to announce her existence to the world along with his retirement there were many threats out there that would use her to get to him he couldn't handle it if she got hurt because of him, thank god for JJ, but there was a promise he needed to make.
