It’s almost a whole month of anxious brainstorming before it finally,
Here is the thing, with consequences: If you don't see it, you never learn the lesson.
And he wonders, for a moment, if Thor has always been like this, always had this almost somber side to him, or if this is a recent development – and what exactly has happened, to change him like that.

She takes a glance at the tiny plate before him, the one they brought to the table along with the coffee cups just so they could pretend they are not running with absolutely no sustenance for almost 24 hours. She and Sam snagged a few bites almost immediately, but Steve hasn’t touched a single cookie so far. Nat must’ve noticed he isn’t eating much these days.
and it’s making him flustered all over again like Tony is still fifteen and very very charmed by the tiny class president. “Because I don’t remember you being...”
“I’m not blaming you.” Pepper says, hastily, grabbing his hands and wrists firmly, trying to force him to focus. “Tony, listen to me. This is not about blame.”
Bruce looks like he’s having his entire perception of the Universe rearranged right before his eyes. Tony can understand – if not for the situation they’re in, to explore these new ideas and concepts with Thor would definitely be something he’d be very interested in. Tony has no qualms about expanding his knowledge in areas that are not his expertise or not of use in his work life; Knowledge, for him, used to be a source of infinite amusement and wonder, puzzles and challenges that would fill his days and nights with questions just desperate for answers, for riddles so eager to be solved, a hunger he can’t sate – but he can’t give in to the temptation now.
“Well, for Sarah Rogers, I wouldn’t have minded that.”
“This metal, wasn’t there any of it in his place, along with the mold for this?” Rogers asks Thor off to the side, pointing to the gauntlet prototype.
“It is.” Tony admits. “We had an issue with that strategy in Argentina. No casualties, thankfully, but a lot of property damage. The legal team took an alternative proposition to the UN after that – instead of asking for permission upfront, we should
“Now you have.” Steve gives him a plastic smile, knowing Sam can see through the cracks of his poorly constructed politeness, his patience wearing too thin for him to keep himself in check. “And you can leave.”
“Doesn’t
“Divide and conquer.” Tony half asks, half clarifies, looking at Rhodey for support, to receive back a sharp, assured nod.
“And that’s it?” Bruce asks, sadly. “That’s all we’re gonna get?”
As you've surely noticed, I talk a lot. Not only that, I am an insufferable debater, and I love analyzing details that have seemingly no importance whatsoever, from every single angle I can think of. I'm also a firm believer that the devil is in the details - and details are a very... troubled aspect of the MCU, sometimes ignored, sometimes completely distorted, sometimes not even considered. So I'll go through it all, one by one, and we'll see how far I can go - and exactly how deep the MCU could've pushed our heroes if they wanted to.
Once again, something that is not quite fondness, but it’s also not just surprise, floods Tony in a warm rush of sensation. It’s – It’s mindboggling, honestly, even if it happens over and over again, to see Nebula
The one who looks worse for wear, actually, is Bruce. The others look fine, as far as you can call them that, but Bruce is in a whole entire level of distraught before Tony. He sits between Thor and Natasha, his hands wrapped around a mug, fingers drumming anxiously around the ceramic, body hunched – and his eyes are

“He’ll be fine.” Steve says, because he wants to believe it. Because he can’t think about this right now. Not while they’re here. “Tony is strong. He’ll hold himself steady.”

Rhodey takes half a step forward unthinkingly, responding to the spike of raw and uncontrolled emotion in Bruce’s voice, and both Tony and Thor flinch – not because of Bruce, but of Rhodey’s reaction, and a suffocating feeling of grief and shame falls upon Tony like a heavy blanket, despite not being him the one who moved, but far too aware of how the movement will be perceived by Bruce’s mind.

“I thought I could offer some help, in any way I can.” Thor raises his shoulders a little, a shadow of the innocence and pure heartedness he used to wear on his sleeve still there, still softening him at the edges, and it does ease the ache in Tony’s chest, if not by making him feel better, by making him at least glad

The sight of a crowd makes a rush of adrenaline pump into his veins, a brief moment of confusion quickly drowned beneath a dangerous sense of
Howard was never very present in Anthony’s life, and she doubted very much that Howard knew what the stages of child development were. He probably considered them useless anyway, because Stark men were always geniuses, and geniuses don’t fit in any normal child development scales. So, who knows how far he had pushed Tony’s intellect and responses, and how much he could actually understand and learn. Maria loved him very much, but she’d be the first person to admit that Howard is exactly the kind of man who would program his son to be able to tell the entire periodic table even before teaching him basic things like the name of colors or what the fourth of July means.

The stranger considers him for a quiet second, and then, slowly, starts to make way around the desk Jarvis occupies, placing himself in his line of sight to be inspected. A very calculated action. Jarvis reads a lot of information in that move – the courage to put himself in line of sight, the assurance of his footsteps, the slow inspection he receives back -, and when they are front to front, Jarvis releases a deep breath.
This is his burden to carry.

It’s the shoulder Tony knocked into when he wobbled and nearly fell when he tried to get up, he realizes. Shit, he probably detached something of hers because of the impact. Just like the rest for her, it looks made of half flesh, half metal, so her joints are probably mechanic too—

“I still am concerned about the Accords.” Steve says, and he sounds nonsensical. Like a child, stomping their foot on the ground when they are annoyed when their parent isn’t listening to them, as if T’Challa is somehow being purposefully difficult and ignoring Steve’s worries. “I still won’t agree with them.”

“It’s just easier that way. Everyone did it.” Steve explains, but Tony isn’t sure if it’s meant to be a comfort or something else.

Steve doesn’t even have proof that this is truly what was going on, but once the idea formed in his head, he can’t remove it. He enters the workshop confidently, JARVIS easily allowing him in, and Tony doesn’t even turn around to greet him, still bent over an engine of sorts and very carefully ignoring Steve.
But he feels bad anyway. He never liked to steal. And Tony is not an enemy, despite all that happened, and destroying something he helped build feels particularly wrong, especially now. After Ultron. After cutting ties.

Steve doesn’t know how long has passed, how long he stood there in silence, arguing with the voice in his head like a complete lunatic, almost having a mental breakdown in front of Wakanda’s king.

Which is just as irrelevant and ridiculous as his observation about Natasha’s hair is. It’s not a big deal. It’s not. Apparently, they all had a makeover while Tony wasn’t looking, Thor included. It is literally not something relevant at all.

“When he captured me in Seoul.” She reminisces, in cautious words. “He was… weird.”
“I didn’t help them.” Tony says, because it feels like the truth. He’s not sure if it is, but it’s too late to think about it anyway. “I couldn’t.”
“Then all of a sudden, you buy them a private island or something.”
The worry in Bruce’s eyes is so clear and tangible, nearly like a physical touch, and Tony’s chest aches with how much emotion the proof of Bruce’s care for him can reach, how much he wishes he could accept it easily and let himself bask in the comfort of knowing that Bruce wants to

But that’s not it. That’s obviously not it. The answer is staring Tony right in the face right now, glaring and familiar, so ironically close to home that it almost makes him want to laugh.

From here on out, I will loosely divide this fic into arcs - and in each one, we'll discuss a different character, and address whatever issues need to be addressed by that character, and take a deeper look into their relationship with Tony. I say loosely because you'll be able to see clearly their starting point, but you probably won't be able to see the ending point, not for all of those arcs. Some issues transcend a two-person relationship. Some issues involve all of them. Some issues never end. The lines will get a little blurred sometimes.
They lay there. And they wish it was enough.
My God, that is A Chapter. Look at that word count. I definitely went too far with this one.

“Alright, alright, sorry, didn’t mean it that way.” Clint raises his hands in the universal sign for surrender. “But you are one crazy bastard, Sam, and don’t act like you don’t know what I’m talking about.

Clint turns to Natasha, giving her a fond look. “You never trusted them.”
“Easier to creep closer.” The man hums, as if he agrees. After a moment of silence, he asks instead: “You wanna know why I’m asking instead of just dragging you away into a cell, Mr. Jarvis?”
“The vision the Norns gave me was a revelation.” Thor says quietly, much more quietly than Tony is used to hearing his voice, eyes blue and gold and filled with a knowledge Tony can even begin to unveil, clouded by sorrowful wisdom. “I went to London looking for answers on how to defeat Ultron, and they gave me more than I bargained for – the Maximoff girl showed me the Mind Stone, and the Norns showed me the rest. And I think that’s important.”

Rhodey scares the living hell out of Tony when he suddenly walks in, the War Machine suit following close behind, and he doesn’t even hesitate in walking past Tony and into the elevator, all of them shuffling easily to allow room for the bulk of the armor, still leaving an open space right in the middle, a space Tony could easily fit into.

“Clearly not, because Tony signed and he is out there, fighting as an Avenger, and we’re the ones hiding like criminals.”
But he listens.
“Okay.” Tony exhales, a little taken aback with the direction the conversation took, not expecting Thor not to press the issue of Tony’s clearly messy state or his solitude in the workshop. If this was anyone else, Tony’s sure they would have pushed – he’d been ready to argue or distract or even

It's a bit hard to keep track, but if you decide to watch the movies again very closely, you will notice that there is a lot that we know, but the Avengers don't. And this is such a heavy weight for us to carry, letting it affect our views and our opinions of their actions without allowing the characters to deal with them on their own, demanding trust when they only have half of the story to tell.

“But he didn’t have
Building a slightly more compact version of the reactor into the machine is not really a problem, procedure-wise, but the need for secrecy becomes even more imperative after he’s done it. It actually makes him a little concerned. He hadn’t planned this in advance, had not even considered it would be necessary, but as the months came and went and he struggled to find something that would fix some of the critical mistakes his programming was causing, the arc reactor was the only solution he could find that wouldn’t take at least five more years to develop. It was already at hand. No one except Vanko knew Howard had the reactor and he needed to hide it, somewhere not even Vanko could’ve found it if Howard didn’t want him to, and suddenly, his new project was there, the perfect opportunity, the perfect circumstances, and Howard just couldn’t resist.

It’s a feeling that is not quite anxiety, but it’s also not anticipation. It’s eager, but not comforting. Steve was never one for nervous ticks, but sometimes, he does feel the inexplicable urge to bounce his leg or twist his hands together, or keep

But Steve made him blueberry pancakes.
Cap shrugs. “Pretty much.”
Steve will do it alone, it’s fine. He can do it.
“You ok, man?” Sam asks, quietly, but when Steve hears the lock click he shifts his gaze to the door, just a second before it opens, and the sound is what startles Sam into looking backwards, successfully interrupting their entire conversation.
“It could be a trap.” Sam reasons, putting his gun away in his holster, as Natasha also relaxes and deactivates her Widow Bites.
The furious voice inside of Steve’s head growls, affronted and disturbed, and he has to squint his eyes shut and shake his head to keep it at bay, gripping the phone so tight in his hand that he hears the faint sound of the plastic casing cracking at the corners from the pressure.
“God, Rogers.” Tony says exasperatedly, and it’s ruined by the smile that stretches so wide across his face that it hurts his cheeks. “You’re lucky you’re pretty, or else I’d let you starve.”
Tony is—
“Yeah?”

Thor steps forward, extending his hand to reach for the ring, cradling it in his palm with great care. He inspects it for a long moment, turning it in all directions and bringing it very close to his face to inspect the details, even though, from where Tony is standing, it just looks like a normal, totally simple, not at all important ring.
“Vision.” Sam suddenly calls, and they all look at him, surprised by his sudden outburst, and Vision hesitates when he sees Sam give a dry gulp and stand up from the couch.
If Tony is not actually embarrassed to talk to Steve, Steve is

, and she didn’t understand why Steve kept dodging her – but now she does. She does, and she’ll destroy him for it.
He thought Tony was gone. He hadn’t allowed himself to think about it when Thanos came, he didn’t – he had refused to think about it, he draped himself under the safety of the rush of adrenaline that came with wearing the cloak for the soldier, the weight of responsibility the took upon himself every time he allowed the persona of

They are like Wong, too. There’s going to be thousands of them out there.

She kept the lights on. The windows open. She knew about him.
“And if we don’t push through this now, who’s gonna avenge it?”
Steve will not stop Clint, if this is what Clint thinks he must do in order to make his amends.
“We are not gonna split.” Natasha says, with immensurable distress in her voice, and her gaze, when Tony finally manages to cease his staring contest with Barton to look at her directly, is fiery and pointed, as lethal as one of knives, unbreakable determination. “Stop it, Tony.”
“Thanks, Tony.” Steve says anyway, smiling wide. “Felt like I should make the last page justice. I’ll have to buy a new now tomorrow.”
“Too long.” Steve smiles, and steps back so he can make room for Tony to step forward, and only then Tony realizes that the other people present, meaning the people he just rudely and loudly interrupted in favor of his flawless act of totally not being affected by the sight of Steve, are Wilson and Sharon.
And Tony shudders with the strength he can see in them, with the force Nebula seems to be able to carry even when she has apparently lost it all, a force not even the entire universe could contain.
“There is no need for that. I appreciate the hopeful words, but… From the way these last few years have developed – the outcome of my past battles, I find hard to have any hope that this tragedy might have not struck her as well.” He laughs, full of self-deprecation and sorrow. “Like I’ve said, I haven’t spoken to her in years. And yes, I’d like to know if she’s out there, if she’s well, but I understand that, with the time restraint we have hanging over our heads, my search for her out there in the ashes would bring me nothing but more despair.”
Thor looks taken aback, overwhelmed by Bruce’s outburst. “Dark matter and dark energy are powerful forces. To control them means to control one of the universe’s foundations itself. Even in Asgard, our most powerful sorcerers don’t have a full grasp on their properties and strengths. It makes sense than an Infinity Stone would rule over it.”
Tony’s fault.

Tony doesn’t want to leave before he can figure out how.
Wanda chuckles, and her laugh sounds wet and a little broken, but she doesn’t cry.
She hasn’t been her usual self ever since they met inside the Raft, actually. Steve’s noticed. He knows she is not happy with their situation, but to be fair, neither is he. None of them are. They would all rather be home, training and helping people as they should, as they had done for years, with none of this Accords mess or feelings of betrayal hanging over all of their heads. They’re losing so much

But then, he asks himself who would he be, if he had never been at war.

“Nothing I didn’t expect to find.” Rocket discouragingly says. “Out of everyone in this room we’re the ones with most experience in space-travel, and everything written there is pretty much what we already knew. It seems like the guy was studying wormholes and space-jumps, you know, basic stuff. We use it all the time, with the ships and all. Metal boy here has seen it.”
Steve wasn’t actively trying to stay alone with Wanda, but Clint stepped out for some extra groceries and the opportunity just presented itself. He has to admit he has a soft spot for her, but they don’t interact much, besides from the hours they spend training together at the Compound and that one, very painful conversation they had after the incident in Nigeria.

Natasha swallows dry. “S’not like we can wait.” She grumbles, nodding to herself. “This is bigger than all of us.”
He misses having his shield with him. It’s almost like being naked, going into a mission without it, and he grabbed one of the guard’s guns just for safety’s sake, even though he hates firearms with a passion. He keeps glancing at it from the corner of his eye, just by the keyboard he’s typing in, keeping all his senses alert to any indication someone is coming close to the control room. He knows there’s still a few guards walking around, patrolling the halls and the upper floors. If he’s spotted, Steve won’t ever be able to come out. He’ll be trapped here, just like the others.
“We need all the information we can get on those things. Make sure we’re not missing anything. Especially something that might get us killed.” Rogers says, but there is no fear in his voice. Only conviction. Only certainty.
He grits his teeth, pain aching all the way up to his temples from the force he applies to his own jaw as he does it, but he stands still and makes sure is tone is very polite when he answers. “Of course.”
He turns around, and for a split second, Tony’s heart lurches painfully with anticipation—

The image mimics the flickering of the light at its core, the constant swirling of energy beneath the smooth surface of the blue cube, and with it, almost like an illusion, the projection board gives the barest of flickers, as if it could feel its power from the image alone.

Not that Tony had seen it much, with his own eyes – but Tony thinks he knows more than most. Because he had been there. He had been… He had been back at the Compound when Vision started to roam the hallways aimlessly, the books he found so interesting no longer hold his attention, to find him in the kitchen, staring at nothing, looking frighteningly human and not human at the same time.
“All I could do is bring this back.” Thor raises the enormous gauntlet a bit, calling attention to it. “The mold he had in his forge. It’s not made of the same material, I don’t think, but it was all I could bring with me. Figured it would be better than nothing.”

He wonders if Steve’s afraid. It’s hard to imagine him being afraid of anything, but then again, Tony didn’t imagine they would ever sleep together, either.

Tony doesn’t know how to respond. It feels like this is eerily similar to all their previous arguments about this, but
Tony, silently, hopes he doesn’t lose that in the middle of the way. He
“Tony.” Rogers exhales, softly, after a silent beat. “We won’t leave without you. I promise.”
“We’re not a threat.” Steve says, curt and firm, believing it to his very core, wishing Bucky could see it as easily as he can. Bucky is not a threat, not anymore. He’s in control of himself. The Soldier is gone. None of them are threats now, they are just people trying to do what’s right.
Rhodey waits for a few seconds, it seems, but then, goes back to sighing, this time harsh and forceful, before he brings his head up and pushes out his chest, all traces of exhaustion successfully hidden in less than a few seconds, as he straightens his spine and assumes the posture he always does before duty, sharp professionalism honed to perfection after years of his service.
“Is he—?”
The suit touches down on the landing pad, and, as soon as it does, it starts to disassemble, the parts shifting neatly and opening up, revealing Pepper, rattled, and dirty and ragged, still in a formal white shirt and a pencil skirt, barefooted, her hair stuck into a mess of a ponytail and dirt smeared on her cheek, eyes bright and wide with terror and as breathless as he feels.
All he knows is that the mere thought of it makes his heart constrict in the most bittersweet way, a wishful thinking and a fierce desire, the so naïve expectation that T’Challa might be right. That when that day comes, Steve will realize it in the form of a long-awaited ringtone, the phone between his hands finally,
“Gamora would have never let him get the Stone without a fight.” Nebula says, mournfully.
“Get me in, see what you can do.
“The Infinity Stones are powerful, and their power is not something to be reckless with.” Wong ominously says, hands clasped together at his back and chest puffed out, unafraid of Tony’s or anyone else’s backlash, sure of his words. “Even with just the Time Stone, only the Sorcerer Supreme has enough control over its power to use it – and even then, we never have full control. The Stone has a mind of its own, and it doesn’t bend to just anyone.”
He’s not sure he can handle the idea.
The cold reminds him of the cave at night. Of Siberia. He trembles, not just from the chill.
“You’re flying back to Wakanda?” Tony asks, frowning deeply.
“Somehow, I can’t doubt that.” Tony affirms, out of his depth, the breathlessness he feels far less related to his physical strain than he’d like to admit.
“I know.” Steve smiles sadly, and for a moment, he’s speaking both to Sam, and to himself. “I just hope he can forgive me.”
The words almost don’t compute in his mind. For a second, Tony can’t feel anything but the purest form of

Natasha shrugs, jerkily.
(I don’t care if it kills me.)
This one last time.
“What?” He repeats, “Huh, yeah? Eight? Eight is fine.”
“Of the Winter Soldier.” Steve lowers his head on instinct, feeling stupid for the way his emotions spiral out of control when he thinks about it, and he has to step aside and turn his body away from Sam, turning to the glass wall, to give himself the illusion that he is not completely exposing his aching heart to his friend as he confesses this. “Killing Tony’s parents.”

Through it all, even though she had never said so, not in so many words, Steve had always known that Natasha’s feelings of protectiveness for Tony ran far deeper than she’d like them to believe. For Steve, Natasha had displayed undying loyalty, far more than he deserved, truly – but for Tony, what she felt was softer, almost more dangerous in its vulnerability, and if he were any capable of giving this thought any attention, he would realize how important this is. But he can't.
And Steve wants to believe that, he wants to, so badly, but—
It takes a long, long second for the words to catch up to him.
He tried to sleep, but every single time he forced himself to relax his body would burst into uncontrollable shivers, as if his muscles were rebelling against him, injecting adrenaline in his system and denying him an escape from the cruelty of consciousness. He then got up, and decided to do some push-ups; and by some he means about 600 of them, without even breaking a sweat, but that is useless too because he can still hear himself think. He’s feeling trapped inside this room, no matter how spacious and beautiful it is. He looks around and instead of walls he sees bars, keeping him confined and isolated, forgotten by everything and everyone outside these walls.
“What else can I do?” Steve derisively says. “Somebody’s gotta do it. The fight won’t win itself.”
Bucky was alive. It was on the

Tony’s mouth opens without his command, a jolt of instinct he can’t suppress fast enough to avoid the movement altogether, but no words actually make past his lips; His breath catches, throat closing in like he’s swallowed a bee, uncertainty clawing at him like gashes of knives, shame burning hot at his nape.
Lang has other types of association to make than the rest of them do. He wasn’t there – but he admits remembering most of the public information about 2012 and 2015 quite well, the news on the attacks of New York and Sokovia broadly spread thanks to TV and paper, as well as Natasha’s public hearing after the fall of SHIELD in late 2014. A few things he has to be brought to speed on, much like Nebula and Rocket had, but it’s surprisingly easy, considering how little he questions the existence of magic crystals with the power to level the universe and how well he already knows the Avengers, from the news over the years and… everything else. All in all, he catches up quick and seems to understand why they are bringing in so much information to the table, and promises to do what he can to help them skim through it as fast as possible.

After the closest thing you can feel to death, without actually dying?
He understands where she’s coming from. Past his worry, his screaming, almost overbearing instinct to refuse and keep her where he thinks she’ll be safe, he gets it. Both Tony and Pepper are fixers, they ache for purpose when they are left idle, and they can’t stand the idea of not helping when they can. And they need all the hands they can get. Tony reacted so viciously against the idea of being left behind while the others flew back to the city, what argument could he have against Pepper following them? Pepper, who Tony knows can hold her own, better than he can sometimes, Pepper, who will never forgive herself for standing still when she could step forward and help.
“Hm.” He murmurs. “I don’t like when people hand me things.”
“I know.” Because he does. Bucky is the strongest person he knows, and Shuri is a genius. She’ll find a way to help him. But it’s not
“I was just informed. He is moving all Avengers business to the compound, and removing all Stark Industries property from the building, moving it to another location. Across the country, apparently.”
“She showed me the Red Room.” Natasha confesses, in a tiny voice, cracking at the edges. “My training. My… graduation.”
“And you are injured and can’t help.” Nebula snaps back. “We need reinforcements.”
Is that cowardly?
But… But he guesses that, the same way Steve feels like Bucky’s fall is his fault, Bucky must feel like all of those things are his fault. Steve won’t pretend to know anything about the intricate connections and specifications of the human mind, he is no scientist or scholar, but if there’s one thing he
Pepper walks backward until she’s out of his reach, shaking her head helplessly, and Tony watches miserably as the full extent of the damage fully registers into her, and she puts her back to him and walks to the counter of the bar, pacing, hiding her face from Tony very much on purpose, distressed. She lays her hands on the counter, her shoulders hunched, and
Like he knows he’s being watched – and he probably does – Rogers lifts his gaze and turns around, and stares right back at Tony as he stops by the door.

“Not exactly, but I was the only survivor on board. Banner survived because Heimdall sent him away. I do not know what Thanos would have done to him had he stayed.” Thor shakes his head. “He wanted me to witness his destruction, but I do not know why. He killed Loki for attempting to attack him, but he did not kill me when I promised him the same fate.”
“They have consciousness.”
It’ll pull until it snaps, if one of them doesn’t let go.
He doesn’t know if that’s best.
Steve raises an eyebrow at him, and says nothing.
How long has it been since Tony last saw Thor? Jesus, it’s been a really long time.
“We lost.”
“The ship’s not the problem, problem’s the fuel.” Rocket grumbles. “I doubt you have what it needs here, considering space-travel is not something you all do.
But still – Pepper knows him like no one else does.
But they believe in him. At least, these two – and Thor, so it seems – do.

“This is insane.” Rocket complains.
Tony is not sure where he’s going.
“I’m Deputy Chief of one of SHIELD stations.” The man concedes. “But the title is not really that important. Soon, it might actually be outdated. Might be a little higher up the ladder than expected.”
Yeah. Alright.
Tony stops suddenly, realizing he’s getting stressed over it again, and takes in a deep breath to calm himself down.
“I got it.” Steve says - his voice low and a little distorted over the speakers in Tony’s watch, a little worse for wear, but still a better comfort than anything else he could have asked for. “Nat is getting the files to the UN as we speak.”
“I’m sorry.” Wanda pleads, before Steve can say a single word. “I’m sorry for what I did to you, in Johannesburg. I will never do that again.”

“Good.” Steve puffs his chest out, just a little, like he’s proud of himself, and when Tony finally gets out a business card from his wallet and awkwardly writes his personal number on the back, it takes all his strength not to react to the brush of Steve’s cold fingers against his when he grabs the paper.

Steve watches the world around him with a weird feeling of detachment weighting down on his stomach. He observes quietly, cataloguing somewhere deep in his mind the way a stout man by the counter gets powdered sugar all over his mustache when he bites into a pastry. He counts the rhythmic beat of the pointy shoes of the lady two tables to the right, as she fidgets in her chair while taking a sip of her hot tea. He loses himself in the low but constant stream of words coming from the news broadcast on the tiny television behind the cashier. It all sounds distant, like background noise, static flooding his ears and making his fingers feel numb around his cup of coffee.
Scott takes in a deep breath, and then he just blurts out his next words. “I’m thinking about going back and turning myself in.”
Jesus fuck, what if someone really stole it?
“I go every morning, Tony.”
“Right.” He murmurs, in a disbelieving tone. “You gonna eat that last cookie?”
Tony would thank her if he didn’t know any better. Who knows what sort of creepy telepathic conversation they’re having right now. He doesn’t even know what Natasha is alerting him for. Is she trying to stop them from fighting? Well, that’s nice of her, but Tony doesn’t really care right now. He’ll fight Rogers if he has to, even if he is
“I would not hand it over to
“Yeah, get me on that too.” Tony quickly decides, storing away his annoyance over SHIELD’s lack of security for another, much, much later time.
So, when he finds himself alone in almost two weeks, the first thing he does is open up the comm line and call T’Challa.
(He’d stayed awake.)
But he doesn’t do it on purpose. He truly, truly loves her, it’s not a farce, he’s not lying – but the way his brain works sometimes, he doesn’t get it himself, and he doesn’t know how to stop. It’s that why they fight all the time? That Tony has these impulses he feels like he can’t contain, and Pepper can’t live with Tony doing this over and over again? It makes him feel like he’s the worst person alive – because what kind of selfish bastard forgets about his fiancée because of some shiny, sparkly magic books? What kind person is he, that he’d rather let this gap between them get wider and wider, that would
He picks up the call and says hello. He sounds like a dying man.

He turns off the computer in a hurry, rearranging all items on the desk as they were before. Maria won’t even know he was in here. He’ll have to come back later, when she’s asleep, to he can look at the new files and folders more carefully, and maybe he can reverse-engineer them to figure out where they’re coming from.
“Will they try to reduce his sentence?” Natasha quips in again.

“What’s wrong?” He asks, softly, so the others won’t hear. “You’re jittery.”
Howard and Maria Stark are dead. A car crash, the news will say, and very few people will know the truth, even in the many years to come.
Is that also part of that dark place in him, the piece of his mind that demands that he keeps control and vigilance over his teammates? Is this another proof that he is terrible at letting go, of problems, of people, even when they are not his to keep?
There's no people.

, and then we’ll see if Cap can destroy any of them. Tony would like to see him try.
(It makes him scared.)
By the fourth month, Steve could feel the way his jaw hurt whenever he looked at the phone, an almost imperceptive grinding of his teeth, the feeling of something dark and ugly growing deep in his guts, something that made him feel
It hurts, it hurts.
(Idiots, all of us. All of us.)
It’s no more than a whisper, so Tony doubts any of the civilians could have heard, but it’s possible, because the man on the floor says, just at the right cue, “Just leave us here. We’ll be okay, you can leave.”
“Not good
Thor nods, though Tony is sure he has no idea what Tony is talking about. “I asked the Norns’ guidance when Ultron threatened us with the help of the HYDRA twins. I saw—” He stops, and he looks like he reconsiders his words a thousand times before he settles on what he’s actually gonna say, very carefully enunciating when he does, “I had a vision.”

(And he understands.)
Finally.
Maybe that’ll make Steve’s mouth taste even sweeter later.
“I want to go back under.” He confesses. “Until it’s safe.”

How can he make this right?

Tony exhales slowly. “It’s a figure of speech, Smurfette. Do you know what those are?”
Tony looks back to Rogers, out of instinct, hoping to see any sort of hint as to what he should do, a silent command or discreet indication, but he gets nothing. Rogers is not even looking at him. Whatever it is that he’s thinking, he’s thinking

You have no barriers left. Everything you had holding yourself together, it crumbles down along the rest of your world, turning into a pile of broken pieces at your feet.

in some sort of way. How else would he describe it? Bruce always spoke of Hulk as if he was a different person – so Tony tried his best to think of it that way too, to be respectful of Bruce’s feelings on his other half. Honestly, he doesn’t know if there’s any accuracy to it on scientific terms, but he thinks it doesn’t matter much; Bruce is the one living with him, inside his skin, every day.

“Clint.” Natasha warns, stepping closer to him, her eyes reprimanding.
(Just a man in a can. Nothing more. A man in a can.)
“I need FRIDAY.” Tony says mostly to himself, ignoring her grumbling, starting on a mental list to keep himself occupied, to have just the smallest comfort of pretending he has a plan to work this out. He ignores thoughts of the kid, he ignores everything else. “Where is the ship?”
“He seemed to be fond of the place.” Thor says, extremely sorrowful for some reason. “It’s the only explanation I can think of.”

“Yes.” FRIDAY says, automatically, but then her tone turns regretful, because she

“You know how hard it’ll be to fix this, don’t you?” Sam murmurs in a sorrowful tone. “I know you want to fix this. It’s just… It’s just the kind of guy you are. I’ve seen the phone.”
Steve raises his sketchbook and shows him the drawing, his neck flushing unbearably, but he stands strong, holding Tony’s gaze confidently, unafraid of being genuine with him.
Steve actually likes the guy.
“They are requesting permission to access the hangar and the tools to fix the ship, Boss. It seems like something might be stuck on the interior that is preventing the motors from functioning correctly.”
And it doesn’t

Tony blinks. “You do?”

T’Challa seems surprised by his question; Whether by his soft tone - so unlike the other times T’Challa has heard him speak, probably the first time he has allowed himself to be unguarded in the king’s presence ever since they met -, or by the

“There’s no chance this guy didn’t use the Stone on his own?” Natasha inquires Thor, with just a hint of steel in her voice. “Are you sure no one else touched it since you left it there?”
“I’ll see you later.” Pepper affirms in a whisper, her eyes locked onto his, so he cannot twist her words into anything other than what they are. A kind promise. Truth. “Okay? Call me if you need me.”
You've seen the trailer, right? You must have. Just so you know, the trailer is the only reason why I'm updating this now, because this chapter was supposed to have two other scenes, but I can't say silent for the life of me so I need to mention a few things. So, SPOILERS AHEAD.

Steve wants the same. The only problem is that Steve’s family is broken.
“We’ll find something.” Tony affirms. “And if we don’t, we’ll create something.”
Seeing the Quinjet now stirs something odd inside Tony’s chest, even past the dread, even past the anxiety; something a little tender, a little sad, something he’ll push down, far, far away, and never allow himself to think ever again.
Ross, the son of a bitch - says, without a single speck of remorse. “I suppose now is when you tell me you won’t help me find him?”
Steve sighs remorsefully, looking away for a brief second, feeling the familiar ache making itself known inside his chest – but surprisingly, it doesn’t hurt as much now. It still throbs, it’s still tender, but it’s healing.

“You think he could’ve gone back to where he found her?” Tony asks.
But how insensitive would it be, if he did?

Tony arches one eyebrow. “You sure this isn’t an excuse to get me to buy take-out for you?”
“You never fooled me, Tony. You were a very good actor – you could fool a lot of people. But never me.” Pepper says; And isn’t that true? Isn’t that the biggest truth of all? “You never were the soulless businessman people wanted you to be.”
“We can’t just ignore the environmental threat.” Bruce mutters insistently. “If we divide, me, Tony and Rocket can get into the lab as soon as possible and start running tests and finding a solution to get rid of the ashes. If we could reach Shuri—” he trails off and looks hopefully at Natasha and Rogers, but Natasha only averts her eyes and shakes her head minutely, and Bruce’s face falls for a moment.

Take care of yourselves both physically and mentally, keep in touch with family, friends, and loved ones through whatever means feel more comfortable to you, and remember - we are practicing social distancing as a safety measure, but we are not alone.

This seems to be a revelation to all of them.
Are you?” Rocket jabs, and Tony is so distracted by watching their childish squabble he almost misses the turn in the conversation as they both shift their focus back to him. “A genius? Can you get us out of this?”
“Nat.” Steve insists, as his voice sounds accusatory even though he doesn’t mean do it. “We need to talk.”
“I’ve been a spy for a very long time, Cap. And if there’s one thing I learned from all those years, is that governments fall every single day. It’s more dangerous to stay under the jurisdiction of the US than the UN.” Natasha says. “Being trapped under the thumb of a single nation is worse than being trapped under many nations. When you have a lot of people distracted with something, is much easier to slip out through the back door. Much easier to find loopholes. Much quicker to find a way to wiggle out of a bad place. I would know, I’m a specialist on it.”
(Who knows?)
Sam hums, but otherwise does not react.
Bruce looks at him, grateful and afraid, and Tony knows what it feels like to be the only one in the room screaming arguments that don’t penetrate through people’s stubbornness and refusal to listen, so he really can’t berate Bruce for his fear of them not grasping the big picture of this issue. They are all people who constantly need to make harsh decisions over what to prioritize, what is immediate and what can wait; but for Bruce, who can analyze the data better than the others can, probably better than Tony himself can, the long-term issue can look just as scary, if not more.

“I’ve read three versions of it so far.” Clint comments, keeping his tone very lighthearted, as if avoiding starting any sort of bad reaction; whether from Wanda, or from Steve. “It changes every time.”

– it rushes into Tony like a hit of a drug, loud in his ears and burning into his veins, just as impactful as Roger’s veiled concession, because if they are considering it, Tony might actually convince them of doing this. It’s not the best plan. It’s the worst of plans. Tony knows how easily this could backfire, and he knows that considering his track record, it’s not a novelty that they are doubting him. They don’t… Tony knows what they think of him. Of his risky ideas. But now they have no choice but to agree, because Tony isn’t spewing this out of his ass; the proof is right outside, in the sky, in the air, and it’s just his anxiety talking, this is the
“Everything is fine, thank you for your concern.” T’Challa kindly says, his voice giving none of his curiosity away, despite the fact that his eyes sparkle with inquiry all the same. But there is a knowing smirk on his face, not smug but soft, as if something in Steve’s demeanor amuses him in some way.
– JARVIS had been concerned all the way through. The insistence in redoing tests with every single element in the periodic table and every combination of elements at least five times hadn’t been all at Tony’s own request.

Tony’s mouth clicks shut painfully.
His hammer. His eye, too. His different appearance. Oh –

Dammit. He misses Tony. He misses Rhodes and Vision. In a weird way, he almost misses Fury and Hill too. Steve gets so damn attached to people, he can’t help it, because he’s know ever since he was little that there’s so few people in this world you will actually keep for a long time. Life is fickle. People change. Time passes. But Steve has had so many things taken away from him he can’t resist the urge to fight back, to bare his teeth and attack, to hold his ground, even when his ground is unsteady, simply because it’s
“Yes, it has.” Steve agrees, his voice surprisingly tired despite the fact he

How? How does such a thing happen?
Which implied she has done it before, while Tony was unconscious.
“He’ll do it again if he has to. We’re not there anymore. We’re not Avengers, here. If the Avengers are ever needed now, he’ll go anyway, with or without us. Because that’s what he does, because he doesn’t know how to stop. He fights, even when he’s in disadvantage.”
Tony lets himself sag back into his seat when the room goes silent again, feeling like he has just been hit with a truck, or an entire convoy of trucks – or maybe just a giant, purple alien with the biggest weapon ever created. It’s like he has been drained dry, his body just a husk, his head pulsating and aching incessantly, exhaustion seeping into his bones like stains into cloth. Not even the kind of exhaustion that would make him shut down and sleep for days, because that type of exhaustion Tony knows far too well. No, the kind of exhaustion that makes him feel like his limbs are about to fall off, all strength of his body melting and dripping away, while his mind is too alert to shut down properly, as his body does.
But that had never been Tony’s intentions. His dreams. He never

“You’re right.” Steve mutters, and it is a strain for him to do so. It feels
When no one springs forward to confirm or refute her theory, she leans back heavily, far less graceful than her usual movement, and sighs heavily.
“They’re gonna break the gate.” Bruce whispers, distressed.
“Honey, please.” He begs, his body pushing forward against Nebula’s hands, unconsciously, trying to reach closer so Pepper can feel him, even though it’s futile. “I still need to look for whoever is left. I can’t do that from anywhere else. I need FRIDAY to help me.”
(Why?)
But before he can get a single word out to inquire about it, a rustle of movement catches at the corner of his eye, from far away, over Bruce’s shoulder, and Tony turns his head instinctively, totally forgetting himself, the automatic response to stiffen up and prepare himself for an attack too raw and real for him to stop it, and everything that happens after that is just a blur.
“What’s that?” Thor asks.
“You’d be surprised.” T’Challa cryptically says. “For two people that seem so different, you are very alike in some matters. Giving up is not something you two know precisely how to do.”
(Together.)

He knows it sounds bad. He knows it’s risky. But—
“Okay, but what about the wormhole?” Bruce inquires, leaning forward so he can catch Thor’s attention. “What makes a wormhole different from those jumps? Why isn’t

Steve looks at him like he’s amused, smirking at a private joke. “Jerk’s late. I set him an alarm and everything, but you know how he is.”
is what snaps him back to the memory, the sour taste of it blooming back in his tongue, the bitterness associated with it coming back all at once.
The only reason why Tony’s breath doesn’t hitch is simply because he stops breathing at all, just for a second, because he feels like he’s watching something happen right now, something big, and not even the elusive and quiet interior of the workshop is enough to mask the feeling that suddenly rushes through him with unrelenting force.
It’s… It’s kinda insulting, actually. Clint was right. He wouldn’t do this to Nat. He wouldn’t do this with any of them. And if Wanda isn’t a child, if Wanda isn’t his charge, why would Steve do something like that?
The idea that she might distrust him completely now is shattering, it’s
for a second. They seem so caught off guard that it somehow to keep them still for a while. Thankfully, Tony doesn’t seem to have harmed anyone, or so he hopes; But he can’t be sure, and the size of the crowd doesn’t let him accurately account for everyone who should have been hit by the current.
And now it’s after. Now, it is no longer in his hands.

“Agamotto was the first to discover there were other Stones like the one he held, and he began a research to discover what were elements that created and controlled life in the universe. From learning about the body and soul, he learned about the universe, and the knowledge that there should be more Stones out there balancing the scales of life became obvious.”
“In Scotland.” FRIDAY replies, and as she pulls up more screens to show whatever footage she managed to find from Scotland, and there it is – Wanda, being shoved inside a store through the window, breaking the glass and falling on top of chairs and tables.
But he must. He must, because Steve’s mind is obviously in the wrong place, even if he wants to believe is heart is still on the right, and he needs someone else to tell him that because by now, he knows how this goes. He knows he gets too deep and he can’t find a way out of his own defensive, aggressive logic. His own teammates had seen to that. First Natasha, then Scott, the Clint, then Wanda— all of them, little by little, hitting all the soft spots in the fortress Steve built around himself until there was nothing left to protect the struggling mess beneath.
And he agreed over and over again, as the days passed and Ultron successfully evaded them while trying to build himself a fancy new body –  why go to the trouble of sneaking around, when he had the power to render them completely useless if he had wanted to? Tony made him, he made JARVIS, he made all of them, he

“That’s – uh – hm.” He forces out a laugh. “It’s not personal, don’t worry. I just— I had a great night, don’t worry—”
“Ya know.” Rocket pats his knees, as if he’s dusting off his clothes casually, before standing up on the table so he an Tony can be eye to eye, and to call the look on his face predatory it’s almost too much irony for even Tony to bear. “We keep hearing about this big fight you all had and that’s all fine and good, whatever, it seems like you’ve got your issues, who doesn’t, am I right? But it seems to
“A… pot?” Tony asks, almost inaudibly, because forcing even the smallest words out of his mouth and into the air feel like disrupting this moment too harshly, a cruelty Tony doesn’t have in his heart to do.
Not this time. Tony will try to stop it this time. He’ll rack his brain out, he’ll try, because that’s all he can do, with odds like these.
Here, with no trust between them.
Tony isn’t sure what he should do.
“This. Separating.” Bruce gestures vaguely, and he daringly steps close to the table that displays the mockup Gauntlet, leaning over it with his hands, eyes tired and face grim. “I thought the point was to not to lose sight of each other. Who knows what can happen when they’re out there?”
himself from not liking that tone, that tone that he now associates with some bad things, with the memory of a time of willful ignorance and a lighter heart, that had come at a very high cost in the end. A thing that, to this day, Tony won’t allow himself to think if it was worth it or not.
(She might be right.)
The Guardian immediately presses close to him and knocks their shoulder with his, using their body as a wall for Tony to support against, letting out a pained noise and a hard flinch when they collide – but the support is enough so Tony won’t fall straight into the rocks below if he tries to move. Tony thinks he might’ve hurt the Guardian somehow, even if his shoulder is the one that’s going to bloom in a deep purple bruise in a few hours if the sharp sting of a metal object hitting his deltoid is any indication, but he can’t manage to do anything but sigh in a small, shaky breath, even if only slightly relieved that the support allows him not to put his entire weight on his legs, that are starting to feel like jelly more and more, with every moment it passes.

Even if they are renting two separate rooms, Clint is usually around when Nat and Sam are away, trying to give Wanda some space to practice and think in peace and quiet for a few hours. Steve doesn’t really mind the company – after all, if there is one thing he has now is too much free time, too much silence and too many thoughts, so company stops him from getting too carried away and he appreciates it.
Steve is not one to dwell on such matters, usually. Truth be told, he’s probably the one who avoids thinking about it the most, because after he’s woken up, everything he does is to avoid looking backwards too much, fearing he might get lost in his own head if he allows himself to miss it. It’s exactly what he did at that night at the bar, so many years –

“Until when?”
now. He’s losing it. He’s losing all his strength and he doesn’t know what to do to make this right. “We can’t trust them blindly. You know that. You saw what happened to SHIELD. How can you trust them after that?”
Tony stiffens in her embrace.
Steve rubs his hand over his face, wishing he could just walk away from this conversation and never talk about it again. But he can’t. Sooner or later, he’ll have to tell them.
For a second, he thinks Steve will punch him – but he quickly tells himself
“How many were there before?” Nebula inquires, looking at him, but Tony is just staring ahead, unblinking.
additional data, replacing the projections of the Earth with close-ups of a clear sky on the left and a cloudy, dark, bleak shot of a huge swirling mist, so thick Tony could feel the phantom sensation of it in his fingers, could smell in his mind if he allowed himself to recall the scent.

“No.” He says, and that, at least, tastes like a truth on his tongue.
“You guys came in the Quinjet.” Rhodey points out, raising an eyebrow. “Are supposed to just leave it here?”
All he knows is that he hears the words and he prays that they are true, because he has no other option if they prove themselves to be false.
Lang knows Rhodey already, sort of. That’s easy – though it doesn’t make Lang any less terrified of Rhodey in any way, and Tony kind of lets him fret about that a little bit, because it’s mostly harmless, and Rhodey will appreciate it, even if he doesn’t admit it. The other two, though; Tony is not sure who Lang is more excited to meet: Thor, the literal Norse god, or Bruce, the legendary scientist with seven PhDs.
“You wish, Birdbrain.” Tony throws him a smug look, and he desperately wishes he had brought his sunglasses. He has to settle for the hope Natasha is satisfied with his torment, and barely waits a second to turn around and begin to step back from the group. “You can’t afford me!”
People scream in surprise, bodily throwing themselves back and taking down entire lines of the front rows of the crowd, jolting and jerking away from the bars as the electric current hits them with a painful shock to their unprotected skin. They scramble back, afraid of touching the bars, and, miraculously, they
“Do they need help?” Thor inquires, gazing quickly at them all as if to assess if he should be moving when they are.
(Why am I using it again?)
“I’ll be fine.” Pepper assures him. “I’ll do what I can to get those R&D guys with the equipment they need, and we’ll ask FRIDAY for any help if we need to. I’ll help Agent Ross and Agent Carter on comms. I won’t go out there unless they call, and if they do, I’ll let you know.”
He sees
Oh, but that doesn’t feel right at all. He can’t do that. Not after everything he’s done to keep Tony safe. Not after Mr. and Mrs. Stark have been killed for it. He must protect Tony, no matter what, because who knows what Howard has put inside him and left there? How many of his secrets is Tony hiding?

He wants to believe Steve. He really does.
He would, though. It’s true. Tony would come back to her, if she wanted him to, after… after this is all over.
Because they have no other choice.
“Yeah, I bet you didn’t.” Clint lets out a hollow laugh. “Listen, all of you are loners and I get it, good for you, but I’ve been married for years and I

Something painful grips his stomach tight in his belly.
“There’s room in the west wing, now?” Natasha asks, too casually, with only the appropriate hint of confusion for it to sound innocent, but with a heavy, blatant presence of curiosity under it.
Tony and Rogers share a deeply confused look, startled by the quick, unexpected decision, but Tony can see in his eyes that Rogers knows no more than he does at this point. He’s just as baffled, just as stressed.
Loud, angry, sharp judgment, wrapped up all pretty in a shiny box of
Being witness to this makes Tony’s chest hurt in the best and worst of ways.

He sees the
"But you have to remember." Wanda says. "If Vision can forgive me... Stark can forgive you."
“The Convergence is an event where all the Nine Realms align across the universe. An alignment that takes millennia between every occurrence. In 2013, they aligned. And though not many beings can feel it, much less see it, it is there.” Thor explains, making gestures to try to aid his words, but without any visual to back up the words, it just looks like… a very weird imitation of hand-wavy magic. Or maybe every bit of weird hand-wavy magic. “Yggdrasil, the Tree of Life, is constantly moving. Sometimes, the branches that hold the Realms align, and it opens passages between them. One of those passages led Jane to the Stone.”
(Not anyone else’s.)

“Much like the Sorcerers use dark energy without the help of the Stones, we must find a way to fight back against the Stones in Thanos’ Gauntlet with matching power. Stormbreaker hit him once, but if the Stones destroyed the Gauntlet, it is possible they could break Stormbreaker. It is not a certain strategy.”

Steve had been Tony’s priority.
But on his
“He can’t be obsolete! He’s one of a kind, and he’s not one of your common machines so you can keep prodding and changing him, Howard!”
Tony freezes, and, irrationally, almost asks her to stop.
Tony missed him, when he moved to the West Coast. He didn’t want to stop talking to Steve, it just happened. Steve had always been amazing. And gorgeous. And Tony liked him, a lot. Of course he missed him.
“Seventy-two, last I heard.” Natasha signals to him with her chin. “Go. Steve will want to see you.”
Tony’s eyes widen, a terrible, heartbreaking recognition dawning on him, brutal in its wake, and he can only lay there, frozen, as the machine makes one tiny sound to indicate it has completed its job and Bruce occupies himself by pulling it away, getting his hands busy to distract himself, not noticing that Tony
As expected, it makes Barton bristle like an angry cat. It’s visible how it pains him to be restrained. “I would like to, yeah. Can we—?”
“What is going to happen to him?” Wanda asks, her voice quiet and insecure, sitting so still she hasn’t even touched the food yet. “If they find him guilty? Will they put him back in the Raft?”
And it catches her off guard, so much Steve sees the flash of hurt in her eyes so clearly he’s sure both T’Challa and Sam saw it too. And she doesn’t pull it back, once it does. It’s almost like it floods her and she can’t hold it in, taking a blow straight through the heart, exposing her feelings like an open wound in a single moment of vulnerability.
Bruce looks at Tony with a questioning gaze, then Rhodey, then Thor, as if he’s weighing their opinions – but there’s nothing to be done other than to say the truth, no matter how horrible it is.
They are cautious. But maybe this is what they should have done from the start.
Tony’s ears register the sound of the armor approaching even before his mind does. He knows it like the back of his hand. He can hear it approaching, soaring through the gloomy sky, heading straight to his direction, and he gets up hastily and shakes in his wobbly legs, looking out through the glass walls and into the great field surrounding the Compound, his eyes darting from side to side like a stranded man, looking for incoming help in the horizon.

He doesn’t know what the true answer to this is. He just doesn’t. He thought he did, but now he’s not sure, because what good did acting like this do?

Steve can see that. Her present is difficult, and her past is even worse, conditioning her to a life of masks and suspicious glances, of taking nothing at face-value and doubting
“I suppose you’ve heard the news.” Steve says, nonsensically, because of course he has. The man is a supporter of the Accords and the king of a nation who abides by them. Of course he has heard. “About Scott, surrendering. Going on trial.”
But it’s true. The more he thinks about it –
“Not as angry as Tony is, I’m sure.” Steve comments, depreciatively.
The dark surrounds them, merciless, ruthless – and the world grows cold.
- and he misses the sound of the call disconnecting, but that’s alright.
Now is not the time.

And it doesn’t last. He should’ve known better.
He can’t see if Vision squeezes back, because in a mere second it’s over, but that little display of affection tells him more than months and months of living together at the Compound ever did. When he thinks about it, as Sam said, it’s very obvious. But it feels… very different now.

What was he thinking?
Tony stares at her, paralyzed in despair, and as she stares back, the iron-clad resolve that burns bright behind them is terrifying, and Tony can’t look away.
“These are not just decorations.” Thor explains, looking up to them with dead certainty in his eyes, motioning to the ring with a small motion of his hand. “These are spells, like the ones on my hammer, and in Stormbreaker. Meant to harness energy from the very essence of the universe, and use it to produce power.”
Tony doesn’t even think about what he’s doing until he
She looks at him with wide, exasperated eyes, nearly pleading for his agreement; As if this is madness, as if hesitation is madness, as if she can't understand why he's saying this, why he's even considering such an outlandish option.
Pepper wants him to compromise. Pepper wants him to stop and think it through, to find alternatives, to
“And he hasn’t messaged back after that, has he?” She shakes her head in response. “It’s probably because ‘friend’ is not a category he recognizes. No speech pattern is adequate to use when talking to you, so he just doesn’t say anything.”
“If Tony’s the sugar daddy, yeah.” Natasha shrugs.
“I had to say something.” Pepper confesses simply. “Before it was too late.”

Tony attaches the cable, and hopes this entire thing doesn’t blow up in his face.
His body is so tense and his heart beats so loud he can barely hear himself think, so he almost misses what Visions has to say. But he doesn’t. He listens, as carefully as he can, carving each word into his brain like a tattoo, trying to grasp every detail, every shift of Vision’s voice, any hidden meaning that might be laced between his words, because Steve

It’s Thor’s turn to give him a wry, false smile.

“I cannot stop him from doing what he thinks it’s best.” Wanda lets out a breathy laugh, something fondly exasperated, the same way Clint does. “I am afraid. I will always be afraid that they’ll put him back on the Raft. But I trust him.”
For a second, he stares at her, a mix between scared and daring, not truly jutting his chin out in defiance but very nearly doing so. If Tony had the option, he would retreat, turn his back to her with a charming smile and an annoying one-liner, to push her away in the most effective and quick manner, but Nebula has already seen
