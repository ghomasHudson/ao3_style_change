A ring on Steve’s finger.
“Forgive me,” he says, voice meek. “My… my immaturity gets the best of me at times, father.”
Or like a shield.
“First drawer on your right,” Tony breathes. Steve keeps going, moving from one ball to the other, sometimes opening his mouth a little wider to suck both at the same time. He enjoys the short, gasping breaths Tony lets out – he loves those sounds, loves knowing he’s the one who’s causing them. “But he’s –
, Tony thought, his stomach twisting at the sound of what couldn’t be – shit, it
“Fine.” Tony fishes the phone out of his pocket in a theatrical gesture that he makes sure to make as douchey as possible. “Hi, Pep, my love. What can I do for you?”
, which is about the most Tony thing in the world, so it’s fitting that it fills Steve with both exasperation and fondness.
Steve nods, encouraging. There’s a frantic energy coming from him. Tony bets he himself doesn’t fully understand it.
“I hope so,” Rhodey says, and the lack of agreement stings inside Tony’s chest, the mere possibility of the alternative too painful for him to even acknowledge. Rhodey lands a hand on his shoulder. “I want him to get better too, Tony. We all do. But you’re just…” He swallows, and Tony knows he’s thinking of how much he wants to spell it out, trying to spare Tony the hurt by not saying what they both know to be true. “You know what he does to you.”
Tony just grins and shrugs in response. Steve feels his mouth curling in a reluctant smile, but he makes a point to shake his head in disapproval anyway.
“I know it was also my fault,” Steve says, apparently taking Tony’s silence as agreement. “But something like that can’t happen. It’s not right.”
Only then, he realized he had probably woken Stark up.
“Huh?” he says, eyes blinking open slowly, taking in the mostly dark room. It’s that weird, off-putting feeling of waking up:
“Are you going to your floor?” Bruce asked, raising his head from his phone. “Tony said he’ll be coming home in a few minutes. He’s asking if you want dinner.”
“How is this
“Well, I wouldn’t go
“I’ll do it,” Tony says without thinking, but as soon as the words come out, he knows he wouldn’t have it any other way. “The nanites are already adapted to my physiology – I can tweak them so they won’t affect me. I’ll go in, wake Cap to reality, and then you turn everything off and bring us both back.” He doesn’t wait for Bruce answer, already on the way to his worktable. “Come on. From my estimates,” he starts picking up his tools, opening schematics on panels in front of him. “We can get this done by the morning.”
Tony’s mind distantly notices that being in a dream didn’t make Steve suddenly learn his clothing size.
He opens his mouth, ready to spill some excuse to leave, but Tony beats him to it. “Just follow him, Cap,” he says, and the bitterness in his voice is like a slap on the face. “Come on, you want to leave, right? Do what you do best.”
“Not all of us have free time to troll on Twitter, Barton,” he says. Then he turns to Steve, who’s watching him with wide blue eyes that almost make him forget how to form words. “So? What’s all the fuss about?”
Tony feels as the covers are lifted back to his shoulders. He barely has the time to enjoy the warmth before a small kiss is pressed on his forehead.
“Sounds good,” Tony agrees. He knows he can’t avoid Steve forever, especially not in his dream world. And he’s done enough recon work by now – it’s time to start laying the groundwork for what he actually came here to do.
Steve smiles, seeming a little confused. “What are you talking about, Tony?”
When they were still deep in the denial,
He asked that question a lot, Steve noticed. And he couldn’t bring himself to explain that yes, it was – everything was so much more than okay, and Steve’s heartbeat was steadying, and the images of the desert never seemed so distant.
Tony wants to hate him. He really, really does. Bizarrely, though, he finds that it’s harder to hate Barnes when he’s not thinking about things other than Barnes’ own fucked up existence. It’s easier to hate Barnes more as an afterthought than as the sole focus.
“’Course it is,” Tony counters, his brow furrowing.
When Tony speaks, his voice is much softer: “I like spending time with you. Even if it’s, uh. To do nothing.” He shuts his mouth and swallows. “Sometimes that’s. That’s all I want.”
Stark scoffs. “I think he will, darling.” His casual tone is forced. “We—me and him—we have definitely not done anything even remotely close to this.”
“Goddamnit, will you stand still? I’m almost done, you’re gonna end up ripping them off—”
“I want you to—uh,” Steve cuts himself short, moistening his lips. He catches Tony’s eyes watching them hungrily and his face heats, pleased. He knows he’s not the seductive type. To be able to hold their attention like this, then, it’s—well, Steve is finding it a little hard to speak. “To, to fuck me.” He knows his delivery isn’t perfect, but he’s certain it doesn’t matter as he hears Stark’s sharp inhale of breath. The sound fills him with confidence, and he wants to keep going. He flips himself in the middle of Stark’s legs, and leans forward, propping himself up on his elbows and lifting his hips.
,” Tony says, walking towards him. His eyes are wide and his gaze searches Steve’s face frantically. “How are you feeling?”
on the tender spot between Steve’s neck and shoulder.
“Speaking of sleep…”
“How do we get him out?” Tony interrupts. It vaguely occurs to him Ross must have partnered with a tech company, definitely a Stark Industries rival. He feels no curiosity over who it was, though, not now, when the only thing he can see is Steve’s pale face and the only thing he can think is
Tony sincerely doubts that.
There’s no cause for alarm, though. It’s just Tony, hurrying inside with rushed steps, moving through the crowd to reach his seat. He’s wearing a grey suit that’s definitely more expensive than anything Steve's ever owned, but his tie is a little crooked and his breath is uneven. He’s wearing
“I promised him, though,” Steve points out, and Tony groans.
“Seriously?” Steve sounds disbelieving. “You did all this just to use me as a human comforter?”
“I know,” he tells Barnes, because of course he does. He knows how Steve is – has literally seen inside his head now – and he knows how much they can hurt each other, and he knows he wants Steve with every fiber of his being, so much it pains him to think about it, and somehow, being wanted back doesn’t make it any easier.
“Is that all, then?” He asks, barely bothering to hide his eagerness, as soon as Obadiah pauses to breathe.
, but he knows he can’t say that.
Then Steve’s smile grows, and so does the warmth in Tony’s chest, and God, why isn’t Steve this happy all the time? Like, always?
“Oh,” he says, and he’s back to his usual man-out-of-time voice, probably feeling old and stupid, the excitement from before already a distant memory.
That’s not unusual – they spend most days in this manner, hardly ever crossing paths. Howard has his obligations, his duties. Tony… Howard doesn’t know what he does, and, to be honest, he prefers it this way.
The man squinted his eyes at him in response. “Oh, you little…” He cut himself short, drawing in a breath, and looked at Steve, a bright smile plastering his face. “Yup, he is. We’re very sorry to bother you, sir, so now, if you could just…”
Howard clenches his jaw. He searches for the next words to say, but his silence apparently works better, because after a few moments Rogers speaks again.
He expects to feel taken aback, but just like before, it’s different. The intensity in Tony’s face isn’t directed at his leaking cock, but at the full extension of Steve’s body. Steve is enveloped, devoured by that gaze. He takes a breath, but no air reaches his lungs.
“Shut up,” Tony says, in a hurry. Steve’s eyes dart back towards him. “Shut the hell up right now and listen to me. I love you. You—you love me.” Saying it sends a wave of warmth through his chest, and Tony swallows a sob and grins through tears. He rests his forehead against Steve’s, feels his breath on his. “Holy shit, you love me so much, it’s ridiculous.”
“No. No, darling,” Stark interrupted, light laughter in his voice, and Steve’s anger deflated. It was dangerous, how Stark could do this. “That’s the last thing I want you to do. I was just wondering if you’d want to turn around and then, maybe… I could come closer?”
“What I’m about to ask you has no relation to our alliance,” Rogers continues, his voice a lot steadier now. “I come here only in behalf of myself, and what I’m about to ask, I ask as a man, not as a soldier.”
and that developed into a back-and-forth.
Steve’s distant expression melts into a small grin. “I’ll be happy to speak, it’s not an issue. I get it. For a lot of people, it’s really important that I… y’know. Fancy fellas. And if it can help someone, then I will talk about it anytime I can.”
Steve blinks, a little astonished at how casual he’s being, but he manages to give a shrug with a tentative smile. “No better place to be than at the snack table.”
“We’ve been through this. He’s still—”
Howard didn’t mind being late to the party. He’d leave the alliance for after the king was overthrown if he could, but Gods know that would lower his negotiation power considerably. He was left with no choice.
, already. “Okay. How well do you follow the news?”
Tony gives him a nod, too hungry to speak. He takes a bite of his pizza and chews under Steve’s gaze.
Steve just stared at him blankly, then spread his paws and slumped down again. His big blue eyes sparkled with something Tony recognized as a challenge.
No wonder Tony flared up about it, Howard thinks as he swallows another glass. Tony was always obsessed with the knights’ tales, the ones Maria read to him before bed.
Tony can smell disaster even before he steps into the room.
“How come you don’t know any of these things?” Steve asks with a raised eyebrow. “You work with tech.”
belong to Stark, and the man just didn’t care enough to search for him. That made Steve furious, but he decided to channel that anger into energy to try and find the dog, who didn’t choose to have such an uncaring owner.
Tony’s eyes don’t buy his reassurance. “I’m an idiot,” he croaks.
is literally anything that involves disagreeing with the little tyrant. I once turned for telling him he'd had enough treats.”
, the proper answer echoed in Steve’s head, just as he actually opened his mouth to say, “No.” He swallowed. “It’s… fine.”
Steve thought.
Rhodey lets out a loud laugh, throwing his head back. “Oh, man. See, part of me just wants to make jokes about famous playboy Tony Stark going chaste for Captain America, but I actually think this has gone on for too long for me to make fun of it.” He lands a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “You need to talk to him, once and for all.”
And Steve. Through these adventures, Tony found out so much about him – little things like his favorite ice cream flavor (rocky road), the kind of movies he liked (mostly sci-fi and fantasy, but he was also fond of animations), the fact that he liked buying the newspaper to do the crosswords. He learned things about Steve that Steve himself couldn’t tell, like the way he walked, the way his eyes crinkled when he laughed, the way he brushed his bangs off his forehead when he was nervous or embarrassed. Things a person could only learn by spending time with him, which Tony was doing in ever-growing levels – and yet, worryingly, it never seemed to be enough.
As he types – a little slower than most people would – a name into the search bar, Tony’s heart kind of breaks.
He kept the massage focused on Steve’s upper body for a while, raising both hands to the back of Steve’s neck to firmly press his fingers, one by one, against Steve’s skin. Steve felt as if his neck was being elongated, relief climbing to his head and spreading all over his body.
“Feels good, doesn’t it?” Tony whispers in his ear. And it does. It feels wonderful.
Like a glitch.
“Here.” Stark set up a pillow at one end of the couch, unraveling a blanket right over it. “Do you need anything else? A glass of water, maybe?”
Tony wants to shrug, but he can’t.
“Hello,” Tony replies. He sounds equally breathless, but his hands clutch tighter and his expression reveals nothing. Rogers’ smile falters a bit, and as Tony watches him, there’s a caution in his eyes that hadn’t been there before.
. So Tony panicked and bought him a slightly smaller bed than everyone else’s, in a sad attempt to not seem
honestly, and Tony has missed him too much to let either one of them ruin this moment.
They scramble to get their things ready in time to go meet all the guests who are going in the returning pods (the Asgardians, Thor has told them, can party for weeks in a row, so the ship is going to take a while to return). They barely speak, too busy picking up the pieces of clothing they left scattered around the room.
Tony sighed and picked up the ball.
“You know that’s not what I mean,” Rhodey replies. He runs a hand over his face, pinches the bridge of his nose. “Tony, maybe you’re not the best person to handle this.”
Perhaps, Howard wonders, she already knew, then, that she would leave. Perhaps she was trying to compensate for leaving way before she gathered the courage to actually do it.
He stopped, unable to finish the sentence, and Stark gestured enthusiastically to the room around them, where Monet was napping on the carpet, Anakin and Frodo were chasing each other in circles and Lola was still staring at them with a serious expression. Dummy yapped at him happily, then jumped and did a pirouette.
For a second, Jarvis seems as though he’s about to protest, to remind Howard of his many meetings today. But then he doesn’t say anything, only gives a small bow and heads towards the kitchen.
Tony has the feeling that he’s gonna love cleaning poop and having to entertain overly excited drooling dogs as much as Steve loved trying to perform for a bunch of five-year-olds, but, hey. There’s no harm in trying, especially if it makes Steve smile like that.
“He clearly likes you,” the woman commented when Steve picked him up. “He was so scared when I was checking for his chip, the poor thing, but with you holding him, he looks ready to fall asleep.”
Just as the priest begins the ceremony, with a prayer in Sokovian, Steve’s enhanced hearing catches the sound of the saloon’s door opening. His head snaps towards it immediately, his hand reaching for his back in a reflexive motion to grab a shield that isn’t there.
stage, it was hard to notice, because they didn’t sleep together that often. Now, though, they spend most nights altering between which bedroom is closest, and Tony realizes it doesn’t really matter if they’re in Steve’s floor or his penthouse: Steve always wakes up at an ungodly hour. He doesn’t even need an alarm – no, he’ll just naturally be up before the birds, pressing a small kiss to the back of Tony’s neck before rolling off the king-sized or queen-sized bed, depending on which bedroom they were in.
“A lot, actually,” Stark said. “I actually think I remembered it more then than I do now, because stuff keeps fading. Anyway, the point is—while I was… dead, I wasn’t just unconscious. I went somewhere. I… talked to some people – or, hell, some
He’s not really confused anymore. He is, after all, a genius, and as blindsided as he was by the world in Steve’s mind, he’s clever enough to have taken all the information in, by now.
In his rare free time, Howard retreats to an almost hidden room on the top of the southern tower, a place that he could call his workshop if he still had time to work. The servants aren’t allowed to come inside, so it remains exactly in the state as Howard left it in the last time he came up there. The floor is cluttered with rejected projects – unsharpened blades, broken launches, even something Howard vaguely remembers as an idea for an unusually shaped battering ram. A thick layer of dust covers all these unfinished objects like a blanket, keeping them safe in their inertia.
“If he’s me, then he wants you,” he says, simply, holding Stark’s stare when he turns to him. “And he’s probably thinking the exact same thing.”
It was the honesty in his tone that threw Steve off. There was no trace of the occasional flirty demeanor Stark could show at times. Instead, he seemed sincerely worried, and Steve didn’t know what to say. He was not used to having people worry about him. Maybe he should have rejected that – fight against seeming so weak Stark apparently didn’t think he’d manage to sleep alone – but he felt disarmed, caught off-guard by Stark’s kindness.
Sam doesn’t seem to agree, though. When Steve replies, he rolls his eyes and huffs a breath, saying: “Well, be sure to tell me when it does.”
Tony quips, but his eyes shine with such happiness and tenderness that Steve feels dizzy.
dramatic.” Stark waved his hand dismissively. “But I think I did want a second chance, and I think I made a promise in exchange for it. Problem was – well, whoever the people upstairs are, their system seems a little flawed, because, since I was forgetting everything, whatever it was I promised was
“What if I don’t stay like this?” Steve asked, because he couldn’t resist—the warmth of Tony’s touch was spreading all over his body, creating a giddy feeling that made Steve want to giggle and say silly things. “But you gave me back rubs anyway?”
“Okay, fine, I did.” There’s a strident note in his voice, and a burst of fondness floods Steve’s chest. “I messed it up, okay? It was supposed to be—I wanted to—” He gestures aimlessly with the soaked flowers. “I messed it all up.”
And right now, looking at Steve’s face, he has the distinct, surreal feeling he’s not the only one.
“You—God
He clasps his hands together again, as if he’s not holding Steve’s heart in them.
Tony’s hands were shaking. He couldn’t do this. It was—it was crazy, and stupid, and yet, he was going to do it, wasn’t he? He shut his eyes, remembered the weak, muffled sob he had heard a few moments before. God help him, he was going to do it.
, he thinks, silently hoping Tony can somehow read his mind.
“Like, the actual, physical newspaper?” Stark raised an eyebrow at him. “That’s—well, that’s kind of adorable, honestly, but not the point. What I mean is, how well have you followed news about
Tony clenches his hands into fists. Just like with Steve in the bedroom, he almost wants to argue, to say Barnes he’s wrong, he
Tony wonders how did this happen. Because– it’s a bug, a failure in the machine, it… it has to be. Right? He runs a hand through his hair, sighing.
Steve took a deep breath, calming himself down. He’d try just one more time around the block east from the park, this time searching every nook and cranny to see if the dog hadn’t just hidden somewhere, afraid of the noise of the thunder.
. Well, until now, I guess.”  Tony raises his hand, almost touching the man’s fancy suit. “Did you just come through the portal?”
Since Tony doesn’t immediately answer (because there’s a marching band leading what is apparently an eternal fourth of July parade in his chest), Steve then apologizes for sending the memes in the first place, and, look—if nobody
that ringtone.
“Are planning to smother me with covers?” Steve ignores him, having a little difficulty opening up the duvet – it’s a little overwhelming to hold. “Is that what we’re doing?”
“I’ve been told.” Howard makes a gesture towards Rogers’ glass. “Come on, don’t let a man drink alone.”
He clenches his jaw. There’s no sheet over him, and he feels incredibly exposed, naked on the bed. He’s still watching Tony, who remains unaware that Steve'’s awoken. His mind races through the night’s memories, and embarrassment builds up inside him. Tony had thought he hadn’t been with anyone before – he definitely noticed Steve’s clumsiness and his lack of technique. He'd probably expected something more, maybe was interested in testing Steve’s enhanced abilities in bed, and then all Steve had done was… lay there. Christ - he nearly came before Tony even took off his pants. He hadn’t even been able to undo Tony’s
The clock on the wall announces lunchtime is nearly over. Howard pinches the bridge of his nose. He has a meeting with Odin’s ambassador after this, and then there’s the discussion of their exports with Obie, and then, of course, there’s Rogers…
The thing is, Tony
Tony lets out a sigh that he seems to have been holding down for hundreds of years. “I forgot the flowers,” he says.
“Oh, don’t be fake,” Stark chastised, but he was smiling, seeming a little pained. “Anyway. Once I started taking control of things, I realized I wasn’t fully informed of what was really going on under the tables of the company. You see, I was technically the one who ran it on paper, but in reality, I mostly contributed with the projects. Whatever else was happening didn’t matter, because… Well, frankly, because most of the time I was too drunk to care.” He looked at Steve directly, and though his speech never changed, his eyes suggested every word was taking great effort. “So I found out the company was double-dealing – actually, scratch that—the guy I
Steve blinks, slowly. “So you’re not together?”
“This isn’t funny,” he said, snapping his arm away from Stark’s hold. “Look, I won’t pretend to know what your deal is, but I’ve had enough. Maybe the tabloids think it’s funny for you to act crazy to get out of trouble, but I—”
He opened his mouth – not knowing what he’d say, just knowing he wanted to say
He turns to leave, but Tony’s hand stops him, holding his wrist tightly.
Maria was the one who encouraged Tony to keep creating. Howard had warned her against it, had said Tony needed to focus less on being creative and more on being productive, but she hadn’t listened. She never listened.
“So, about yesterday…”
The next day, Howard barely sees Tony.
After Peter and Gamora kiss, they’re pushed with everyone else for pictures, and from there it’s impossible to find a moment to speak with Tony alone, since they’re always surrounded by people. Steve doesn’t get a chance to do that until the reception.
as if it was going to be just her and him.
Howard frowns at that, though his eyes remain at the door.
“I did,” Steve says, reverently, running his fingers through Tony’s hair. “And I liked coming over, too. I might not be able to help with story time, but I’m okay with doing other things. The people in the kitchen seemed a little overwhelmed.”
“Doing what?”
This isn’t entirely true – Howard could, he imagines, send a few more men to meet the Captain’s forces. But that would weaken their own defenses more than he’s comfortable with. He’s already playing a large risk, allying himself to the Captain’s cause.
“To put it simply,” Tony says. Stark’s fingers touch the surface lightly, and Tony flinches – he isn’t used to people other than Steve touching it. Stark immediately recoils his hand. “Sorry. It’s just—”
“Can I kiss you?”
Steve smiles. The ring on his finger is a welcome feel, a daily comfort he’s grown used to in the past years. He smiles and thinks of Tony’s smile, and he knows that in the end those five seconds weren’t just his to give away like that.
“I—” He meant to say
“I’m not the one who should have thoughts about this, sir,” Jarvis says, rather pointedly.
was Steve’s only thought as he hurried back into the living room. Then,
Tony stares so firmly at the gauntlet; it’s as if he’s talking to it.
“Everybody is staring at us, I hope you know that,” Tony whispers, after a while. Steve doesn’t really care – he leans forward, his forehead almost touching Tony, as they spin. “For someone who shuddered at the thought of moving to a beat, you seem to be doing alright, Travolta.”
There it was – the small, fluffy Pomeranian he had seen at the park, blinking wide brown eyes at Steve, his tongue hanging happily from his mouth. His tail wagged when he saw Steve, and he lunged for him, running to stand on his back paws and jump at him.
When he wakes up, he goes straight to his worktable and tells FRIDAY he wants a scan of Steve’s brain.
“No, sweetheart,” Stark says, with a sad smile. He strokes Steve’s bangs off his forehead. “He’s not as receptive as you, I’m afraid.” At Steve’s frown, he adds, “Oh, don’t get me wrong – he’s absolutely wonderful, and”—his fingers trail down over Steve’s face, finding his mouth, and his thumb strokes Steve’s bottom lip—“I think he might be even sweeter than you, when he allows himself to be.” His voice grows wistful, gaze distant for a moment, as if he’s imagining touching the other Steve instead. “I just don’t think I’m the person he’d want to see that.”
Steve takes the flute to his lips and takes a sip, but he already feels a little drunk.
“Yeah.” Tony raised his hands in a surrender motion, but his eyes didn’t yield. “You’re right, he didn’t. I asked.” He stood up, finally dropping the casual act to look at Steve with a wounded expression. “Because you were avoiding me and I didn’t know what else to do. So I decided to surprise you during your doctor appointment. Sue me – you won’t be the first, or the last.”
Tony comes first, this time. He sinks over Steve’s body, boneless, and after a second he’s already whispering apologies, hand lowering to take hold of Steve’s cock. Steve lets him stroke him with those skillful fingers, but he’s stuck on the look in Tony’s face, on the expression he got when his orgasm hit. The way his eyes fluttered shut and his mouth opened. The feel of his body shaking.
“Is Bruce here?”
, lips glistening as he looks at Steve’s face. “Everything okay, darling?”
The cat meowed again, in defiance.
He and Bruce finish working on the new batch of nanites around six a.m. Bruce is yawning, but Tony is in full work mode, ready to crank out twenty more hours without batting an eye. There’s no need for that, though – FRIDAY modified the design accordingly, and everything is ready to go.
Tony’s smile grows into a laugh. His eyes sparkle, bright and wide, as he looks at Steve as if what he’s just said is the most wonderful thing he’s heard all day. “Good point,” he says. Then he drowns out his glass and snaps his fingers, not looking away, and the poor waiter, who Steve had forgotten completely about, comes closer to give him two more flutes. “Thanks, buddy,” Tony slips a bill over the tray that Steve is pretty sure is a 100. When he turns to Steve, he raises his glass to meet his. “But you should know, Cap, that both people have to drink to make it a toast.”
Of course, that’s only if the rebels lose. If they win – and Howard knows there’s a good chance they will, otherwise he wouldn’t have given them anything - the Starks would be on the throne.
“Fine,” Howard acquises, his head already beginning to ache. He places a hand on his temple, rests his elbow on the chair’s arm. “I’m giving you this, because—because deep down, I know how it goes. And you know, too.”
Tony tries his best to not seem too eager, but it’s a challenge. He’s been wondering how to bring up this topic with Steve for
Tony tilts his head. “Did you ever…?”
The next morning, Tony finds him in the middle of breakfast. His hair is messy and he’s still in his sleeping attire.
From then on, it only gets worse.
Steve followed him. He barely paid attention in the bedroom, though; his eyes were immediately drawn to the huge bed in the middle, covered with layers of fancy, red bedding.
The movie suggestion is a bit of a guess. Tony has seen (okay, maybe watched) Steve reading Tolkien’s books around the Tower multiple times, when he was using his floor for whatever mission they were working on, and yes, maybe he entertained the idea of buying two tickets for the newest Hobbit movie a few times then, in that period between the Chitauri and Ultron, when he and Steve were able to establish something that resembled a friendship just enough for Tony to dream of more. But he never actually got around to asking him, and for a moment it feels like he’s putting himself on the spot with this offer, letting real hopes slip inside this fantasy.
Tony thinks, following as Steve walks towards the compound’s entrance.
And Tony isn’t getting out of his lawn anytime soon.
Tony spends almost fifteen minutes fidgeting and pacing in the bedroom before deciding that fuck it, he’s already knee-deep in torture, why not just poke the wound where it’s freshest and most sensitive?
Dinner was… surprisingly great. Granted, Tony was almost vibrating off his chair, but Steve didn’t seem to mind. He had been outraged by the prices, which Tony found both exasperating and adorable, and after a moment of initial awkwardness, they fell into an easy, natural banter. Steve was a great listener, Tony found. He heard everything Tony said with the utmost attention, but he wasn’t always quiet either – he’d interject with a blunt wit that made Tony grin a little ridiculously at times, and he’d nod at Tony’s rambling as if it were worth listening to.
“Or—or maybe I can, but I shouldn’t, and I also can’t, I. I really think I can’t. It’s just, I don’t know. Anything that hurts, hurts more coming from you.” He inhaled, air filling his lungs like needles. “Like… a million, a bazillion times more. I can’t explain it.” He exhaled, his chest empty, his eyes burning. “Don’t ask me to explain it.”
Steve’s eyes find his, and Tony doesn’t look away. “What thing?”
He asks, his eyes finding Steve’s.
Tony scoffed. “I know you did,” he said, and he probably seemed incredibly dismissive, saying that and looking at the elevator and not at Steve, but that was probably for the best. Safer.
“Good morning, sunshine,” he drawls out when they break apart. Personally, Steve thinks he’s the one who looks like sunshine, smiling like that and irradiating so much warmth.
Tony hadn’t
Tony swallows. He steers himself. He needs to be focused, no matter what he sees.
Steve has a headache.
If Tony’s brain were a research lab, he’s pretty sure now would be the time when the glowing rock in the study room turned out to be toxic, and every scientist was running around at the same time turning on alarms. “I. What?”
“You’re the one moving,” Steve replied, because of course he did, and Tony snorted.
He wants to punch something.
“Okay, then,” Stark said, and his voice was like honey, dripping with sweetness and a silky undertone that crawled under Steve’s shirt and made his breath feel short. “I’m going to bed now. Goodnight.” He turned off the lights, and the darkness seemed cold in contrast to his voice. “If you need anything, just let me know.”
“Tony, Tony, Tony,” Obadiah says, as if he’s talking to a child. “It’s dangerous for the Captain to veer into the city. We have negotiated through a messenger. He has never been here before.”
“I’m gonna take a shower so you don’t kick me out of the bed for stinking,” he says, rolling his shoulders forward in a stretching movement. Tony feels a little hypnotized by the muscles of his back, so much he barely feels thankful when Steve closes the bathroom door behind him.
In a world where nothing around them is real, the truth is too heavy, and every syllable burns Tony’s mouth. In this moment, he’s certain he will fail. He can’t do this. It’s too much, to be in this dream world that’s supposed to be Steve’s but feels like it should be his own.
“—Stark,” Tony heard, his head spinning as it did when he woke up too suddenly after a vivid dream. “Captain Rogers, Mr. Stark!” The voice called again, growing more frustrated.
Busy holding a baby, Tony considers ignoring it, because Steve had been so nervous and excited to come along with him for the first time to the Smithe Home for Children. It’s fair to allow him some alone time with the kids. From the time Tony has spent with them (almost three months, regularly, now), he has gathered that they can be very fun little monsters, and he wants Steve to get the full, surreal experience of trying to tell a coherent story to a group of five-year-olds.
Steve lets out an embarrassed chuckle, in all his boy scout cuteness, and, really, it’s a miracle, how this is the same man that rode Tony last night until he came so hard he almost went blind. It’s amazing.
“I trust your genius,” Rhodey says. “It’s the rest of you I’m worried about.”
Tony had rolled his eyes and ignored him.
“It’s more comfortable than anything you have nowadays,” Steve argues, as he stands there in his 40s beach suit, which consists of a pair of blue shorts that looks like they gave up halfway to becoming hot pants (much to Tony’s disappointment), absurdly paired with a brown belt.
“Uh. A day in?”
Steve turned his back to him. Tony’s chest tightened. No matter how many times this happened, he would never get used to it.
“Yeah.”
Nobody but him seems to notice Tony’s late arrival. The ceremony proceeds as is expected. Steve watches, patting Sam’s back when he can’t hold back more tears as Wanda and Vision say their vows. He’s mostly impressed by how much Wanda glows, figuratively and literally at some points, when magic sparks around her in what seems like an involuntary reaction. It probably is – there’s no trace of her usual tense demeanor, just unabashed, unrestrained happiness.
“Tony, will you
He opens his pants in one simple, sleek movement (Steve almost doesn’t hate the belt anymore), letting Steve see the tent of his underwear. Steve feels a possessive, irrational rush at the royal blue color, but his mind goes blank when Tony takes it off, revealing his thick, gorgeous cock. Steve’s mouth waters at the sight, and he’d be shocked with himself, he really would, if he weren’t too busy thinking
The man standing in front of him doesn’t look the same as Tony remembers, though. His hair is a little shorter and he’s wearing casual gym clothes, his metal arm (Tony’s stomach twists as his eyes land on it) intact and visible.
Steve placed his hands in his pockets, stopping at a traffic light, knowing the man was likely to catch up to him. If it was a robbery, Steve at least could make sure the guy didn’t see where he lived. Besides, the street was empty, which meant no innocent passerby would be at risk in case of a confrontation.
He’s headed for the last room, from where Natasha sent him a signal when she confirmed that was, indeed, the place they were looking for. As he rushes towards it, FRIDAY shares some readings of tech waves and signals she picks up, but Tony doesn’t hear it. He can’t hear anything right now.
“I’ll request another bedroom,” Steve said, voice impossible to read. Regret flooded Tony in a hot wave, his face heating.
“I want to start by thanking you for all the aid you have provided us,” he says, and there’s a rehearsed quality for every word. He himself doesn’t seem comfortable saying it, as if he’s only doing it because he must. “Without your generous contribution, we’d be doomed.”
Of course, it took
Steve swallows. “No,” he admits, and lets his gaze go to Tony’s cock, beautiful and already leaking. It’s as if Steve can feel the salty taste of the precome in his mouth already, and he trembles at the thought. He raises his eyes to Tony again, licking his lips in a silent plea.
When Stark is only halfway through unbuttoning his shirt, Tony is already kicking his pants off his ankles, and he gets impatient.
“It’s all a matter of habit,” Tony says with a joking roll of his hips.
And ran he had. Right into Tony Stark’s couch.
, or at least not fireworks like the ones Steve knows. Maybe it’s magic – according to Thor, Loki was instrumental in the wedding’s planning.
Everyone thought he was dead. Hell, he should have been. It had been a miracle he made his way back to the base, nearly a corpse, after almost five months lost. The sole survivor of a lost unit – and for what? There was nothing left for him at home, as he soon would find out.
a spiteful, mean-spirited voice whispers in Tony’s head,
“You never told me,” Tony says, and even saying it hurts, the truth weighting over them like an anchor. “You knew, for years, and you didn’t tell me.”
the intel they got with the captured HYDRA members to form future strategies to rally basis, because, as Fury put it, he couldn’t plan battles he wasn’t sure he’d be able to fight yet. Even if it was a matter of
Uneven.
Except then Steve showed up, with a button up shirt and a leather jacket and a bright smile, and Tony’s brain promptly melted and leaked right out of his ears, so. They ended up going.
“Anthony will be so happy to have you around,” Stark insisted. Steve rolled his eyes – he vehemently refused to refer to Stark’s cat as anything else. “Please. I’ll give you fluffy pillows.”
“If we are indeed the same person, I think I can safely say I know what you have in mind,” Stark drawls, slowly. His eyes are back on Steve, though, as he takes a step closer, stopping in front of him. When he speaks next, it’s almost in a whisper: “And I can hardly say I’m opposed to it.”
– is apparently enough to turn Steve’s brain to mush.
Steve clenches his jaw and focuses on not staring at Tony. They haven’t spoken since Bucky’s wedding, not even through texts. They haven’t seen each other since Steve left in the morning without waiting for Tony to wake up.
it a dog? – licked his cheek softly. “
They never really talk about it (of course they don’t), but Tony is aware that it isn’t a serious thing, what they have. It
“Did you get lost on the subway?”
He does his best to push away these thoughts. The best way to handle them, he finds, is to focus on what he knows for a fact about Steve – namely, that he’s the bravest person Tony ever met, and he wouldn’t string Tony along for such a long time if he didn’t want him. No, he’d sit Tony down, stare at him straight in the eyes and tell him:
I want to thank Sheron, for the beta and advice; and Jay, for the prompt and for being so patient! I hope you enjoy this!
“Let me go then,” Rhodey interrupts, landing his free hand on Tony’s shoulder. “I will be back before you know it. And you…” His dark eyes sparkled knowingly even as his expression didn’t betray anything. “You can watch over him.”
As the clothes keep coming off, Steve, a little embarrassed, has to admit he’s risking hurting his neck by how fast he keeps turning from one Tony to the other, not wanting to miss a single movement, so he decides to go sit on the bed, where he can watch them both.
“What—” Tony forces his eyes to open again, against protests from every part of his body. He manages to half-turn and catch a glimpse of the bedroom.
“But Tony has a knack for—for making impossible things happen.” Steve’s voice wavered, and he looked down for a moment, a small smile curling his lips. “And the more time passed, and the more impossible it got, the more I… I fell for him.” He raised his head, staring straight at Ayesha. “I can’t even tell you when I started loving him. All I know is that one day I couldn’t keep denying that I did, and I do, and I don’t think I’ll be able to stop someday, even if he doesn’t love me back.” He paused, breathing heavily, as if a huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders. “Anymore,” he added quickly.
He wonders if Steve knows he misses him.
, he couldn’t help but imagine how it would feel to have Stark even closer – to feel the silky touch of his skin, the weight of his arm, the raspy sound of his breath.
Steve’s stomach twisted. He wanted to tell Tony everything he was feeling – the discomfort, the embarrassment, the frustration, the fear – but the words wouldn’t come out. Part of it was because he felt unable to say those things to anyone, but another part, he knew, was because this was
Tony’s eyes widen, and his hand goes to his head, self-conscious. “What? Uh, yeah, I—I missed my appointment with my colorist. Kinda rude to bring it up like this, Cap, I wouldn’t—Ooh.” He blinks, frowning for a moment, and then raises his eyebrows. “Is that… Is that a thing?”
. How you had to put it all aside to save the universe. How you forgave each other, and embraced your love again.” A flush painted Steve’s cheeks, descending down to his neck, and for the first time Tony realized he wasn’t as much as looking at Ayesha as he was avoiding to look at Tony. “An unbelievably beautiful story.”
“Thank you so much for doing this, man.” Quill shakes his hand with a bright grin. Steve, who is profoundly regretting the decision to be here, nods with a strained smile. “Captain America as my groomsman. Take that, Drax!” He turns, addressing the other men in the room. “Oh, and the rest of you guys, too. You aren’t bad either.”
“You know. The—the people-thing. The you-thing. Love. Call it however you want.” He shrugs, his voice going faster at every word. “The point is—I’m not good at it, at all. But trust me, I’ve been worse. And, lately, after everything that happened, I guess I… I thought I was getting kind of good at it? I mean, I thought I had at least gotten a grip on how it should go, and I was trying to… To make it easier, I guess. To… to do it right.”
“Yeah,” Tony says as he sits down. He somehow wishes they could have this conversation without having to be so close. He needs his brain at full capacity for this, and feeling his leg touch Steve’s thigh lowers his IQ considerably. “Yeah, everything is… fantastic, actually. Amazing. I--” He turns to Steve and feels his voice softening. “Really, it’s been so amazing, I can barely believe it.”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake.” Stark sighed. “Listen, I’d transform right now if I could just do it on command, but it doesn’t work like that. I just need you to…”
His intent was to keep the kiss chaste, making it a slightly longer than usual peck, but then he felt Steve’s arms flying to his waist, pulling him closer. Tony’s chest met the firm barrier of Steve’s, and he shivered in response, and then Steve parted his lips, and, well—Tony’s mind went completely blank, effectively shutting down at the heat of Steve’s tongue. Tony’s hands tightened on Steve’s cheeks, angling his head to give himself better access, and he could feel
A high-pitched yap called his attention: The smaller dog was standing on its two back legs, tiny paws gesturing at Steve with enthusiasm.
about him.
Steve blinks, taking in the man standing in front of their door. His skin still prickles where Tony had been touching him until the door burst open and Tony jumped back, thinking they were being surprised by Clint making a stupid joke or Vision being inappropriate or—well, anything else, really.
“At least the whores want me,” Tony’s face seems to shake for a moment, but he doesn’t back down an inch, and his voice is cutting, sharp. “At least they’re not terrified at the thought of bedding me, as they are at the mere mention of you. You must know, right? That they whisper among themselves of how old and decrepit you have gotten, and how they fear you will one day solicit their company - though, most of them aren’t sure, father: are you even capable of performing the job? Since mother—”
“Me and Steve?” He asks, when he finally manages to compose himself a little, with a large smile on his face. Tony wonders how many times in his life Steve has seen that smile – brattish, almost arrogant, but still friendly. “What the hell are you talking about, man?”
Steve frowned, but he didn’t want to pursue that line of interrogation. From what he had gathered so far, Stark was a very strange man, and Steve needed some more useful information from him at the moment. “What
Tony follows him, because Tony never knows when to leave him alone. “Were you drinking alone?”
Again, he doesn’t need to look to know Rhodey rolls his eyes. “You suck at playing dumb, Tones.” He walks towards Tony’s worktable. “Nothing yet, huh?”
“Can I…?” he asks, hovering his hand in the air, and Tony nods. His eyes are big and gorgeous and impossible to read as Steve raises his hand to the reactor. His finger traces the sensitive skin around it.
Steve frowns. Sometimes Tony does this thing where he’s twisted a thought in his mind so many times he seems to believe Steve can read it, and so when he talks, it’s as if he thinks there’s already a conversation happening.
They spend a while kissing, Tony’s hands everywhere on Steve’s body, over his clothes. Some of the touches don’t even feel sexual, as if Tony is just feeling his shape, his lines. Steve takes advantage of the moment to do the same, running his hands over Tony’s lean muscles, wishing he could memorize the feel of every inch of skin.
, which Steve had never seen before.
“What if you turned around?” Stark whispered. Steve’s eyes widened. For a second he thought Stark would… But no – of course he wouldn’t, and Steve shouldn’t even think about that, because he’d push Stark away if he came any closer, wouldn’t he? And yet…
His eyes are closed, but Steve keeps watching him, wrapped in the lines around his mouth, the subtle but delicate curl of his lashes. “Thank you for the flowers,” he whispers, because it occurs to him he should, and he hadn't yet. “And for being a great boyfriend.”
That hadn’t been a new thought – actually, it bordered on repetitive at that point, echoing in his head anytime he watched Steve do basically anything - but it apparently resonated with something in Tony’s sleep-deprived brain, because the next thing he knew, he was rambling about reservations that he had made for him and Pepper, and how Pepper had cancelled, and how he missed eating steak, and if Steve wanted to have dinner with him.
Fair enough, Tony supposes. “You know… this. Us.” He gesticulates awkwardly between them, and Steve’s smile grows, fonder, giving Tony some extra courage. “It’s been… so, so great. I want you to know this.”
Stark moved a little closer, and then he stirred, turning towards Steve. In the dark, it was hard to see his face, but Steve could make some of his features, and just that already clutched his stomach, his heart rushing when he felt Stark’s breath brush his face.
“What happened?” Tony asked, dropping himself on the couch. The room’s luxury bothered him, because he could tell it was more of a passive aggressive move than sheer generosity. More of a
“What if… What if he just doesn’t want me?”
Steve grins brightly, arms going to Tony’s waist and pulling him closer.
owe him.
He was so distraught, he took a wrong turn when he found his street, going in the opposite direction of his apartment. He realized the mistake quickly, though, turning on his feet in a swift movement that quickly turned clumsy as he bumped into someone who was walking right behind him.
Steve inhales sharply, eyes flickering to Tony’s face. “I do,” he says, and poof, like goddamn
Afterwards, the conversation flows easily. Peggy doesn’t ask him much about his reality, clever enough to understand there are things he just won’t answer. They talk about the post-War, about Peggy’s new husband, about mundane things. They remember old times back at the base and laugh.
Nevertheless, the picture was undeniable proof. Steve clenched his jaw and reluctantly passed the puppy over to Stark.
(It’s actually really embarrassing, because Steve’s suite is the only one that has a queen-sized bed. Everyone else got a king-sized bed, and the only reason Steve didn’t was because, when they were giving the Tower the final touches, Tony stood in his lab with the schemes of each floor in front of him and he realized everyone else’s floor looked like a normal version of an extremely luxurious suite, whereas Steve’s was
Tony ran his hand down his face, coming over his mouth. Steve just stood there, and Tony had the irrational urge to shake him. Not only were they lying to one of the most ruthless species in the galaxy, but their leader had seen enough cracks on their fake romance to attempt to insert herself in the middle of it. What a mess.
Century, which is a bit surprising, though not much – Steve being Steve, Tony rationalizes, he probably couldn’t want to just go back to the 40s after seeing the social advances the future brought.
“I know this,” Tony says, huffing a breath. “I’m talking about…” He trails off when he catches sight of Howard looking at him. “You know what I’m talking about. You know him.”
They end up not getting much sleep afterwards, but Tony is definitely not complaining.
He looks around, vaguely acknowledging Natasha’s presence along with many panels showing a flood of data. His gaze darts around the room, and he stops in his tracks when he finds what he’s looking for.
“I don’t want an armor,” Steve smiled. He looked away, his head turned to the opposite direction, so Tony hopefully couldn’t tell his eyes were misty. “But thank you, Tony.”
It was a pretty standard op, just some regular ass-kicking in Midtown. Today’s lunatic did manage to get a hostage, but Tony and Thor had handled it very well while Steve, Natasha, Clint and Hulk took care of his minions. In the end, nobody got wounded. The guy’s boyfriend hugged Tony, in armor and all, when he bought the man back safely.
Because the thing is: Tony loves volunteering. Sometimes the kids are moody, other times they’re more cooperative, but one thing that never changes is that they operate on a bizarrely individual logic that only makes sense in their heads, and they don’t see why it wouldn’t make sense on everyone else’s, which kind of fascinates Tony.
When Maria left, on nights when Howard stumbled through the hallways to get to bed, his hand on the wall to steady himself, he heard sounds coming from Tony’s bedroom. Muffled, uneven sobs, impossible to mistake for noises that came from working.
“Everything okay?” Stark asked.
And Tony is, of course, standing right next to Steve, because they had been tangled together less than a moment ago, when Tony stripped Steve’s shirt off him with precise, determined movements.
“Bullshit,” Tony countered, and his words cut through the insistent cloud of Steve’s misery, certain and unwavering. “We need you—your… your leadership, okay? Hell, I’ll build an armor if that’s what it takes. Nobody’s benching you, Cap.”
Steve thinks before answering:
Stark raised an eyebrow slowly. “What do you
, researching and learning every detail about the brainwashing of the Winter Soldier.
Bruce had said Steve, in his current form, was most likely not in possession of human levels of reasoning and logic. Still, Tony found it hard to remember that.
else in the world other than…
Tony glanced at her for a moment, and saw as she and her servants did a small courtesy bow. Then Ayesha smiled, apparently satisfied, and turned towards the door, walking away. The servants hurried after, seeming a little unsure of what they were doing.
“Hey,” Tony grins, his voice calm. He has done this many times before, Steve reminds himself. It’s nothing new to him.
Tony turns his head, his interest increasing momentarily. “Did he say anything we don’t know?”
“Tony?” He asks, from the doorway. Something about his posture seems momentarily foreign and then immediately familiar, because, Tony realizes, it’s stiff. “What are you doing?”
“Mind your tone when speaking to me,” Howard says, but the words come out hurried. He thinks he can glimpse tears on the corners of Tony’s eyes. This both infuriates him and makes him wish to turn around and leave.
The second he said it, something seemed to lit up in Steve’s head, like a lamp. “I,” he started, unable to not sound disbelieving. “I’m a god of…”
Tony’s stomach twists and he clenches his hands too tight. Right, he thinks. Steve’s happiest dream would never be complete without his best friend.
Ayesha scoffed. “Your
, the firm pressure against the fabric not nearly enough to quench his yearning.
Right now, though, things have calmed down, and Steve is a little shocked to realize Sam isn’t making a joke, but sincerely asking. Which is ridiculous, because, even in the off-chance of Steve getting…
Tony rolls his hips forward, a hurricane of kisses and touches growing more urgent, more intense. He scrapes his teeth over Steve’s nipple, then sucks on it, hips keeping up friction against Steve’s needy, leaking cock.
As the kiss deepens, Tony takes his hand to Stark’s crotch, palming him over his pants in a swift movement that wins him a gasp from Stark’s lips. He starts to unbuckle Stark’s belt, focused on the kissing, and Steve distantly acknowledges that they both must be fully aware of what it's doing to him, kissing wildly and pushing their crotches together, Stark’s fingers sink into Tony’s buttocks. Wet, exaggerated noises make Steve’s cock twitch, and he needs to touch himself, grabbing his erection over his underwear.
as if he was a baby. “Well, maybe Anthony, but he coughs up fur balls – he’s hardly in a place to judge.” He paused, then added, his voice much softer, “I wouldn’t tell anyone. But, of course, it’s just an idea – only if you want to.”
“Gorgeous,” Stark sighs, and Steve’s dick twitches at the praise. He gives Tony’s length a wet kiss and lowers his hand to touch himself, but Stark stops him, holding his wrist. “No, none of that.” He lowers himself over Steve’s body, his chest against Steve’s back, his erection pressed against Steve’s ass as he comes close enough to whisper in Steve’s ear: “That’s for me to take care of, sweetheart.”
“That’s easy,” Tony says, a little frantic. His mind is already running through schematics. “I can program them to pick them off one by one – it will take a little longer, but it would be a matter of seconds.”
“Right,” Tony agreed. All things considered, they really
“Steve?” Stark called, and when Steve looked up, his light blue eyes seemed hesitant again, and Steve couldn’t find it in himself to ask him to sleep on the floor. It would not be fair, and deep down, Steve couldn’t bear the thought of trying to spend the night on that bed alone.
Steve can see that it catches Tony by surprise. A flush colors his cheeks, and Steve kind of wants to thank Stark, because he loves when that happens.
He waits for the Captain with impatience.
Steve had to be able to tell, by now. Christ—even if hadn’t
, but the words didn’t come out.
“You… Excuse me,” Howard forces himself to say, a hint of annoyance slipping under his bewilderment. He feels as if he’s being mocked somehow. “Ask me for what?”
But he hadn’t expected the look on Steve’s face. He could have expected a lot – including an angry reply that turned into a screaming match, and hell, maybe that was his
Steve’s eyes widened as if he hadn’t been sticking his tongue
“This isn’t a hallway conversation,” Stark said, stepping forward and taking the Pomeranian on his arms. The dog – Steve couldn’t see it as anything but – wriggled a little in protest. “Oh, come on, you’ll have time to cozy up to him later.” Stark turned to Steve, his expression a little hesitant. “Can we continue this in your apartment? Because let me tell you, some alcohol would not be a bad idea.”
“Are the aliens like Thor? Is he going to fight Thor?”
“You. Uh.” Tony stands there as his brain melts, leaking out of his ears and flooding the sand with genius I.Q. “You… own one of those?”
Tony would make light of it, mostly. He’d shrug exaggeratedly, rolls his eyes, make a flippant gesture and say “Who cares?” or “How should I know?”.
Steve stood in silence for a moment, and then the unwillingness of being unfairly rude to Tony won out his conflict. “Okay,” he said.
“This isn’t funny.” Steve abruptly stands up, and Tony notices how his hands shake a little, even as he clenches them into fists at his sides. “I don’t know what kind of joke you’re trying to make here, Tony, but—”
Steve is opening a pizza box and placing a piece on Tony’s place when he says, “Good job, today.”
He finds Tony, finally, near the bar. He’s behind the counter, alone.
“Good,” is all he can say before Steve pulls him closer, clearly not giving two shits about morning breath as he kisses Tony as open-mouthed and sweet as he had last night.
The room is dark, lightened only by the reactor’s glow, and the realization makes Steve’s heart feel so tight he can’t breathe.
did a number on me last night,” he scrapes his teeth over Steve’s throat, looking up just to see his cheeks darkening even more. “Almost rode the life out of me, in fact.”
: the knot in Tony’s throat vanishes, giving place to a warm, delicious feeling spreading from his face to his chest; and he suddenly doesn’t want to leave the room ever again.
Steve smiles and shakes his head. “I’m not upset. If anything, I’m thankful you stopped me from embarrassing myself even more.”
Tony frowns. “And what do you suggest?”
He closes his eyes. The rain roars outside, but all he can hear is Tony’s heart.
sleeping with him, this is absolutely ridiculous, you can’t be that spoi—"
“I was counting on you to say that.” Stark gave him a bright grin. “There’s a lot that we can do – that shelter you work on, for instance? Could use an expansion, and then there’s…”
. Stark chuckles, rubbing his erection up and down the crack of Steve’s cheeks. Tony grins against Steve’s jawline, and lowers his hand to remove his own boxers, hurriedly shifting to kick them away.
“Nope. He’s like an all-american Sleeping Beauty,” Tony says, internally grateful for managing to sound casual.
Steve can’t speak, so he just nods, and Tony does just that. He curls around Steve’s body and holds him as if he’ll never let him go.
Howard feels as if he can see the anticipation growing in the room, almost as a cloud forming over them. The guards don’t bother hiding the shock in their expressions, and even Jarvis can’t fully disguise the curiosity, his eyebrows quirked.
, but the contact was steady and comforting and he felt too weak to do that. So instead he drank, taking long sips, only now realizing how dry his mouth was. “There you go.” Stark smiled, his eyes dark blue in the soft lighting, and that smile broke something inside Steve’s chest, something aching and scary and that, coming to think of it, was probably long broken already. “It’s over now. It’s okay.”
“Leave me alone,” Steve said coldly. From the little he knew about Stark’s public persona, he guessed this was probably a schtick of his. Maybe his fans liked it, but Steve didn’t have to entertain him any longer.
Steve’s eyes find his, though, and whatever he sees seems to reassure him enough, because the room around them starts going back in focus, taking shape and going back to look like the real world.
Steve opens his mouth, ready to argue, but then he finds that he can’t find words to speak, because suddenly his mind is invaded by images of an alternative reality where Sam isn’t speaking nonsense.
“What?” Tony echoes, ridiculously, because he really can’t bring himself to say anything else.
“Everything okay, Stark?” Tony flinches at the use of his name (his father’s name). “You look like you’re gonna be sick.”
“Not yet,” Howard replies. He’s a little taken aback; Jarvis rarely asks for explanations. “There are questions I need to ask first.”
was there. In my bedroom. I thought I was seeing things”--he grimaced--“but then I started to remember.”
Tony thought, a little distantly.
“Don’t be jealous,” Stark says. Then he smiles, and Steve can catch a glimpse of that same strange, subtle sadness. “I’ve got problems of my own.”
“That sounds incredibly difficult,” he replied in a solemn voice, and Tony laughed, because, fuck yeah, someone with a sense of humor. Those were apparently hard to find anywhere in the universe, it seemed.
Steve grins, face full of wonder, and his hands go up to hold Tony’s wrists. “Because,” he lowers Tony’s hands from his face gently. “You were
(For a moment, a part of Tony had almost reveled in that, in that raw display of anger all over Steve’s features. His own body was shaking, blind with fury, and he
“Actually,” Tony’s voice lowers even more, so only Steve can hear, “I had… something else in mind.”
Also, he’s smiling.
Tony presses his lips together in a thin line. His eyes must spell out the anxiety spiral in his head, because Rhodey’s face turns more determined.
Panic rises in Tony’s chest –he hasn’t sent the signal yet, he can barely believe what is
whenever he wants to, Tony is more than happy to help with that. He’s just not getting away anytime soon.
married for God knows how long, and Steve is immersed in this fantasy to the point that he thinks it’s real. Okay. Okay.
looking at Tony. “We don’t need to talk about it, let’s just—”
“Well, clearly it has, since she’s giving herself one more chance to slip her room number into your pocket.” Technically, the palace’s rooms didn’t have numbers, but Tony didn’t have any time to care about that. He was way too busy trying to pry the mental image of Steve hooking up with the Golden Lady out of his head. “Did you talk about this with anyone?”
It was such a jarring sight, compared to Steve’s dirty, old futon, that his stomach twisted. Everything about the bed was decadent and so unlike himself that he couldn’t help but think
“Yeah. I guess I. Did. Maybe.” He sounds like an idiot, so he searches for an excuse, desperate to find anything while his brain is too focused on the way Steve’s eyelashes look when he closes his eyes. “I… I need some sleep.”
The goal was, in Bucky’s words, to catch up. He and Gail were doing fine, the email said, but they – Jesus fucking Christ –
As he passes the door to Tony’s room, he thinks he hears a noise. It’s late, but Tony keeps odd hours; his schedule outrageous due to his parties or the time he devotes to his own pet projects. Howard imagines this is what he must be doing now: wasting time crafting something they don’t need and have no use for, as opposed to doing something actually helpful, such as attempting to upgrade any of their catapult models.
Steve controls his grin into a more schooled smile, but he still
He made a post on Facebook, and, talking to a few people from the shelter, managed to gather together a small search party. However, even after two days, they didn’t find a single sign of the missing Pomeranian.
Tony stares at him, and Steve thinks: this is it. Tony will refuse, and Steve won’t push it – has no right to even think about it – and he will go.
“I’m afraid not yet, my lord,” Obadiah’s voice sounds compassionate, but there’s a glimmer in his eyes that leave no doubt this is the moment he’s been waiting for all night. “The rebels sent a raven to the city walls last night. Captain Rogers has requested an audience with you.”
Steve’s heart raced. He had vivid memories of being mugged and getting into fights with bullies when he was younger and smaller. Nowadays, his size tended to keep ill-intentioned people away, but now… was that what was happening?

“What about Stone Inc.?”
“Is everything okay?”
, that evil voice whispers in Tony’s ear, but he tries to brush it off. Steve would
He loves, loves,
“Gold?” Howard asks, his fingers tapping the table. “Power? Climbing to the throne, you’d hardly need him for either of those things.”
“The Captain of the Howling Commandos,” Jarvis announces, as the door opens and a man steps inside. “Former Captain of Pierce’s guard, Sir Steven Rogers.”
His eyelashes were obscenely long for a man, Steve thought, distantly, his face heating. The thought angered him slightly, as if Stark had somehow forced him to think it.
Steve shook his head in disapproval. “’The
As the lights went off, though, he felt a light, soft thing touching his feet. He laughed and squirmed as the ticklish sensation of what were undoubtedly Frodo’s licks climbed up his leg. Then, he felt Frodo’s weight as he climbed up the couch and settled on Steve’s Dummy-free leg.
Again: he was trying to be nice. Elphie was right, no good deed went unpunished.
The reaction seems to please Tony, who pulls back with a shark-like smile, before turning his attention to Steve’s neck and shoulders. Steve jolts at a slightly stronger bite, his body boneless against the work of Tony’s mouth, and he’d easily fall on his back in the mattress if Stark’s body didn’t show up behind him, his firm chest against Steve’s back, strong hands holding Steve’s waist.
Steve turns. Tony immediately lets go off his wrist, as if he’s been burned. He stares at Steve with a pained expression, making a fist with his hand and pressing his knuckles to his mouth.
Steve took a steadying breath. He felt foolish – now that he was actually starting to calm down, his reaction to a simple bad dream seemed nothing short of pathetic. The images of the dream dissolved slowly, fading like old pictures, and all that was left was a strong, almost overwhelming sense of embarrassment.

“Yes,” Tony replies, and Howard feels a tinge of annoyance at the indignation that fills his expression, as if Howard has insulted him deeply. “He used to live here, years ago, as a child. Don’t you remember?” He frowns as if the possibility honestly confuses him. “He tended the stables. How could you not remember?”
should be angry.
Tony actually snorts, spreading his arms. “I’m talking about the fact that I’m not a Sinatra guy, Cap. I don’t have anything against the guy, but I don’t listen to his music in hotel rooms for fun, and I sure as hell don’t
as Tony leans forward and presses inside, but it’s a fucking delicious burn, the feeling of being filled up by Tony, just Tony. Steve can’t help but squirm, his knees tapping Tony’s shoulders as he fights to sink more, to take Tony in fully.
“Can I ask you something?” Tony hears himself saying.
“No,” Tony said, immediately. “No, this is not happening. I refuse.”
When Tony turns, Barnes’ image is slightly wavy under the kitchen lights, and his pale blue eyes makes Tony think of another pair of blue eyes, one he has loathed and loved for years and now desperately needs to see again.
Then Tony pulls away and takes a deep breath, resting his forehead on Steve’s shoulder. “Jesus. Look at me—said I was going to do what you want and then practically hump you like a horndog.” He props himself up by his arms. “Give me one second.”
Speaking of kids, Clint’s catch up to them immediately, surrounding Tony with excited voices and even more excited questions.
They don’t speak on the way to the room. Tony says something, Steve thinks, but he can barely hear it, too focused on following his steps, on staying moving before he stops to think about what they’re doing and wakes up.
His heart feels strangled, as if someone is squeezing it so tight it’s a miracle it can still contract enough to keep beating. His next words come out roughly, his voice hoarse: “Love you, too.”
He swallowed, angry at himself for knowing what he would say, well-aware he’d regret it deeply by the morning. “Okay.”
The next step is the bathroom, which, just like the bedroom, is full of tiny differences, small details that let Tony know it’s not just his. Two sets of towels, two toothbrushes, and so on. Tony sees a shampoo of his favorite brand except meant for blond hair and immediately knows:
When they’re finishing desert, Tony gives him a long, thoughtful look with those brown eyes, and Steve shivers.
The curse goes straight to Steve’s groin, and his moan is lost around Tony’s dick. Tony keeps going, in and out, exiting slowly but pushing himself nearly all the way in when he pulls Steve’s head forward.
humans to do anything,” Stark continued. “But they can give some of you the means to do what they want. So some humans are chosen to be… like, the manifestation of specific things that are supposed to be important. You’re blessed with special abilities to help guide humanity in a better direction. Uh, do you know Greek mythology? Like… Percy Jackson and stuff?” Steve stared at him, shocked at the abrupt change of direction, but he nodded. "Okay, so, uh, you must know—they had legendary heroes in the Greek myths, right?”
“Hey, you,” Steve says, and—He’s not talking to him, Tony thinks. He—he must be talking to Barnes. Steve would never look at him like that.
Stark seems to read his mind, because he starts pumping his fingers in and out before pulling them all the way out in one slick movement. Steve huffs out a muffled protest, the absence of Stark’s contact nearly unbearable. He thinks Tony must notice, because he increases his rhythm, making his thrusts shorter and faster. Saliva starts pooling in Steve’s mouth, some of it leaking, sticking to his jaw, but Steve’s cock is leaking too, because it’s so good to be filled, to feel his mouth and throat loosen to take in as much of Tony as possible.
“Reports? Really?
Tony, everywhere – and, when Stark grabs his buttocks, he can only sigh, resting his head on his shoulder and leaving his throat exposed to Tony’s mouth, that eagerly begins kissing up his jaw.
, that same voice supplied.
Tony says, his eyes studying Steve carefully.
“Right,” Steve said. That still wasn’t enough – the reality of being back in that body was enough to overwhelm the rationality that it would all be over soon – but it helped.
“Oh, my god,” Stark said, sounding tired. “Okay, I
Then he closes his eyes and leans forward, resting his forehead against Tony’s.
. But it will.” He turns, picking up his phone, dialing Bruce up. “I don’t know how could I have missed it. This isn’t a regular coma, those nanites are forcing his brain into a specific constant pattern. It’s not natural – it will wear him out. Not right now, sure, maybe not even tomorrow, but
Steve gives him a sympathetic smile – does he get it? Is he feeling the same thing?
And, sure enough, there was Stark, standing across the hallway, tilting his head towards Steve as if he was actually worried.
“Do you need some help with that?” Tony asks, challenging, with a raised eyebrow.
Tony eyes the mighty buttocks, because of course he does. They’re not Steve’s, but you have to work with what you got.
Steve’s knees reached the back of Stark’s thighs, and Steve stopped both moving and breathing.
He wants to keep working, but he also wants to be useful. Right now, it’s impossible to do both. Still, the thought of leaving Steve makes his chest feel tight.
“Here.” He leans forward and motions for Steve to raise his hips, propping a pillow under him. Steve’s heart pounds heavily on his chest as Tony comes closer.
Stark stared at him in silence for a beat, then sighed. “Listen, it’s not what it looks like. Well… Okay, in fact, it is a
Steve, touch him and hold him and make him smile that huge smile.
“I've been told I’m full of surprises,” Tony replies, alluring. He takes a step forward and Steve shivers at his expression, his friendly grin sharpening into something more intense, focused. His eyes are blazing, and Steve swallows, heat curling low in his belly.
“Tony,” Rhodey interrupts. Tony looks at him, sustaining his worried, tired dark gaze. “Maybe if you took a break and let someone else look at him—”
Steve nodded, wordlessly. Tony splayed his hands, his two thumbs pressing under Steve’s neck, drawing a circle of light pressure, and it hurt for a moment, until it didn’t, and Steve had to hold back a sigh. Tony’s touch was steady and strong, and his motions brought relief to Steve’s neck and shoulders, as if pushing every muscle to its respective spot. Even with the oil, the contact with Tony’s calloused hands eventually grew warmer, and Steve melted a little at every squeeze.
Tony nods as a reflex, thinking he must have misheard, and then Steve closes his fingers around Tony’s wrist and starts pulling him towards the door. He smacks Barnes’ shoulder with his free hand. “Talk to you later, Buck.”
Now, though, it’s all such a fucking mess. Tony can’t stop thinking about Steve’s hands – Steve touching him, holding him. Steve saying he couldn’t imagine not falling in love with him.
him there. Stark’s behavior was abhorrent, but nobody deserved that, or at least Steve thought so - and so he had allowed Stark to sleep on his couch a few times, and dragged him back to his own apartment when he couldn’t do it on his own. Holding Stark’s head when he was throwing up his guts in the toilet was far from Steve’s idea of a pleasant evening, but, well, someone had to do it. And it wasn’t as if he had anything better to do, anyway.
Later, in the privacy of his bedroom, halfway through the blessed bottle, Howard does try to remember the stable boy Tony was talking about. He has a vague memory of an extremely sickly boy that the squires joked would probably get stomped by the horses while caring for them. He can’t remember his face, though, and he isn’t sure he ever learned his name.
“Yeah, yeah, fine, you’re adorable,” Tony said, raising his arms in defeat. “Though, to be honest, you’re always adorable, it’s just that now you’re consciously using it to your advantage. That spell turned you into an evil, manipulative fur ball.”
Howard waves him off with a flippant gesture. Rogers stands up.
The flush finally appears in Tony’s cheeks, but it’s not of shame, but anger.“He’s not—” His mouth shuts with an audible click and he stands abruptly. “I should go.” He turns on his heels as quickly as possible, walking in large strides towards the door.
“Geez, no, nothing
“I’m not.” He looks away from Tony, eyes also finding the unavoidable view of Thor’s ass. His flush deepens, and his gaze quickly shifts to the sand. “I just wouldn’t feel comfortable in something so… revealing.”
He shut his eyes. Then, after a moment, he felt the couch shifting as Stark sat next to him.
“Sure,” Bruce agreed.
A few months after Steve adopted Frodo, he started to notice something strange.
When he gets to the room, he punches the door open.
Howard stops, turning towards him, feeling his face heat in fury. “No,” he says, keeping his voice calm. “No, me and the Captain finished a bottle together. He left a few moments ago, on his way to courtesan’s chamber, I believe.”
As he takes the drink to his lips, he can see, from the corner of his eye, the way Rogers’ nostrils widen as he takes a deep breath.
Steve clenched his hands into fists. He would never get used to Stark’s penchant for pet names. In his life, the only other person who had ever called him darling had been Gail.
Steve lets Tony’s fingers climb up his wrist, towards his palm, until they finally curl and hold his hand. He holds it back tightly. “Okay.”
“Regardless of what childish fantasies you have been feeding, Captain, I’m sure you have heard Tony has a very extensive—and, uh, let’s say varied—list of conquests.” He lets the sweet taste of the wine flood his mouth, slipping it under his tongue before he swallows. “Does that not concern you?”
“Now I know how Rhodey feels,” Tony groans. Steve lightly pinches the side of his hip.
,” and he sounded pleading, and Tony’s heart ached, and—
Steve stays quiet for a whole ten seconds before Tony feels him shifting.
“Never,” Steve says, after a moment, his voice solemn and serious, as if he’s never been more certain of anything else. “I would never regret it.”
Maria, Howard thinks, her name echoing in his head like a single note from an old, sad melody. When he’s alone and his tongue tastes wine, it’s easier to remember her. He remembers her laugh and inquiring, curious eyes; remembers how she had sat on his lap on their wedding night, and how she’d recoil in bed years later whenever Howard slumped down to fall into a drunken slumber, very careful to not even risk touching him.
biased.
And Tony knows this isn’t sensible, that they shouldn’t, they
“Will you listen to me now?”
“Alright.” Steve nods, but his hand still lingers on Tony’s shoulder, his thumb drawing a small line on Tony’s collarbone. “Just wanted to make sure. I know we started off messy.” His mouth curls in a shy smile, but it’s so fond, Tony kind of wants to freeze time so he can capture it, because he didn’t know such a huge amount of affection could fit in such a tiny expression. “But we’ve moved past it, and I’m so happy we did.”
Steve looks away, at the ground, his expression growing pained. “You and Ms. Potts? I knew there was something between the two of you, before, and—and then, I mean, you talked about her so often, and you call her ‘love’ and everything, so, I thought…” He turns towards Tony, those bright eyes looking impossibly blue with that same shy, hesitant hope. “Aren’t you?”
“Dance with me,” Steve says. His voice isn’t as firm as he’d like, coming out softer than he means to, but he extends his hand.
) talks about the subject. “I mean, there wasn’t Tinder, but people still went out, got naked and bumped uglies. It wasn’t the dark ages—and, for that matter, people were having sex in the dark ages, too.”
?” Clint asks, a thousand times more skeptical, and Tony gestures flippantly at him.
“He says he wants to know what you’ve decided, sir,” Jarvis says, twisting his hands. “He says… He says ‘go away’ is not an answer.” He pauses for a moment, then adds: “He says he will continue to come until you answer him.”
It’s probably a testament to how right Rhodey is that Tony doesn’t even dispute that. He looks away, his stomach churning.
“You’re killing me here,” Tony breathes, his hand running through Steve’s hair. “Shit, you’re beautiful. I know if me and him keep echoing each other it will start to get creepy, but—” Stark laughs, and Tony’s mouth twists in a grin. “It’s the truth.”
“But, I mean, you know you don’t have a death sentence, right? A lot has changed since everyone declared you unfit for duty. Everything you have is either treatable or manageable. Sure, you can’t rip off car doors anymore, but—” He paused, and Steve heard a sharp inhale of breath. “The shield isn’t heavy. All you’d need is a little practice with it, to get the hang of your new body balance. At worst, you could get some new gear for extra protection, but that’s it. You can still fight even if your body functions differently – look at Rhodey.”
Steve’s chest tightened as he took the way to get back home. He could only pray the dog was alright at this point, and, though he knew there wasn’t anything more he could do, he still felt sad and anxious, desperately wishing he could still help in some way.
“You’re delicious,” he says. Steve blushes hot, and he notices Stark is also flushed and winded, as he makes a gesture towards Steve’s body that’s almost awkward. “May I…”
“Which one of your doctorates led you to this groundbreaking conclusion?” Tony replies, focused on his latest modification of the nanites. He raises his head, though, even as he keeps working with his hands, modeling outcomes for FRIDAY to calculate.
“Oh, my God,” Steve says, a strong flush coloring his cheeks. “So, the—the movies… And that time in the kitchen… And all those times you’d—” He stops himself, taking a hand to his face. “Oh, my God. This is fondue all over again.”
Steve’s mouth curled, and he wanted to tell Stark he didn’t
He’s a little clumsy as he moves closer until his cock is only a few inches from Steve’s face. Steve watches as it bobs, flushed, and he can’t help but lean in, his hands going over Tony’s thighs, burying his face in Tony’s crotch. He inhales, pleased by the musky scent of Tony’s cologne mixed in with the smell of sweat and precome all over Tony’s girth.
“No,” Steve says, almost pleading. “That doesn’t make sense. You—”
Tony, however, doesn’t seem phased. “Everyone can dance,” he replies, as if he’s saying something incredibly obvious.
Or—on second though, no, he didn’t. For all the old issues he was having to face again, the thing that bothered Steve
“That sentence is so absurd I think if I spend too long thinking about it, I might dissociate,” Tony says, but he doesn’t move away when Steve takes a closer step. He inhales sharply. “Do you, huh… What are you—”
be better.
It’s just that looking at him brings back the image of the most painful things Tony’s ever felt. Things like the images of the hand who strangled his mother or Steve Rogers turning his back to him.)
“Hmf,” Tony says, slightly muffled by the pillow. He isn’t capable of stringing together anything more coherent, so he can only hope Steve catches the crystal-clear disapproval in his grunt.
Tony’s hand snaps forward to hold his arm, keeping him steady. “What happened? Why did it take you so long?” He asks, frantic, and it occurs to Howard he was clearly waiting to see the result of the meeting. Then, disgust crosses his face. “You’re drunk.”
“Hey, buddy,” he whispered, coming closer to the crate.
“Steve,” Tony breathes. “Who do you think I’m in a relationship with?”
“No,” Tony replies in a hurry, his hand flying to his pocket, ready to throw the damn phone out of the window if that’s what it takes. “No, it’s okay, I can just—”
Steve grins. They’re close enough to the dance floor that they don’t need to walk much. The song playing isn’t exactly slow, but it’s far from a fast one either. As the singer goes on about going through a silly phase, Steve stops in front of Tony awkwardly, his heart beating so fast it feels like his chest is going to explode, and lands his hands on Tony’s hips.
Once, they’re in bed, and Tony asks him:
, turned to look at him, and his face was pained and frustrated. His features were reddened by a heavy flush, the type you get after some heavy exercise, and he was beautiful, because he was Steve. “Just—just let it go, Tony, okay? It’s pointless. Just forget it.”
Steve vaguely acknowledges the bed shifting for a moment as Stark leans to open the drawer and grab the lube. “Oh, I bet he isn’t. But this isn’t just about him.” Stark’s hands find the back of Steve’s thighs, caressing his muscles in an upwards motion. “You said he’s pretty everywhere. I intend to see to that
“Why wouldn’t I?” Tony asks, watching Steve’s vitals as if they haven’t stayed the same for the past hour.
“No,” Tony breathes, and it’s only then that Steve realizes he sounds exhausted, and looks it too. “No, I mean—I was supposed to have arrived earlier, but I forgot the flowers. And I thought about calling Happy and asking him to take me to the store, but he was already on his break, and I think he’s going to meet May, and—” He stops himself, seemingly realizing his rambling. His eyelashes are dark with water, one or two drips still holding in between a couple of them. “I thought I could just get to the store and pick up the flowers myself. Of course, that was before the world started to fall apart.”
Tony snapped a picture with his phone, because fuck if he was gonna miss an opportunity like that, and then raised an eyebrow at him, moving his leg a bit, and Steve leaned towards the free space on his chair and dropped a tennis ball on Tony’s lap.
. A friend of mine managed to save my ass at the last minute, when they attacked the van we were in.”
It goes like this: maybe Steve just doesn’t want him.
Tony leans in. “It must be shocking,” he says, studying Steve’s expression. “Seeing it all at once, and with so many people on your back, too, trying to get interviews, get you to speak at Pride…”
“No.” Rogers’ response is immediate. “It doesn’t concern me in the slightest.”
, from his breath to his eyesight to the angle of his vision, had changed in a heartbeat, and Steve had a hard time figuring out what bothered him the most.
Captain Rogers doesn’t seem very impressed with it. He walks inside with slow steps, his posture straight. He is a tall, burly man, wearing dark garments that Howard suspects may be the only piece of clothing he has that hasn’t yet been tainted with blood of the king’s soldiers.
could call me whatever you want, but for the sake of the situation let’s just go with Stark, as well.”
“Depends,” Tony says, and his gaze is scorching. “Is that you want me to do?”
“Stop saying that,” he scolds, and Tony chuckles softly.
“Why the hell didn’t you tell me that?”
Steve held him close, watching as he nestled to his chest, his dark eyes blinking slowly as his body relaxed. He looked so sweet and comfy that, though he knew that wouldn’t usually be advisable, Steve leaned forward and pressed a kiss to the puppy’s small forehead.
the situation in his boxers, at all. “It’s too confusing. Isn’t there something else we can call you? Anthony?”
Rhodey doesn’t take the bait of his childish answer, instead coming closer to also watch Steve’s vitals, looking over Tony’s shoulder.
In the dream, he was never unsure. Every time he looked at Tony, he was flooded with overwhelming certainty,
“Lord Stark,” he says, and Howard gives him a nod and motions for him to stand up again. He complies a little too fast. “Thank you for meeting me tonight.”
Leaving the stones is the easy part. Afterwards—there’s little hesitation.
hadn’t shrunk him, he had nothing to do with this - but Bruce didn’t seem to mind, only typing something else in his tablet. Steve shifted a little, and the already sharp pain in his back increased for one excruciating moment before quieting down once he returned to a more forgiving position. “How about the reverse ray?”
“Why do you want to marry Tony?”
“Would it matter if I didn’t?”
“Dance with me?” he asks, and Steve blinks, confused. He’s entirely unprepared for the question, and his mouth opens without any sound coming out, so he hurries to close it, clicking his jaw.
phone rings, sound breaking through the short distance between his and Steve’s faces, completely shattering the moment that was basically given to Tony on a silver platter.
Steve is right outside the bathroom door. His hair is longer, his beard is still there, but there’s something about
Steve’s fingers are almost rough, still calloused and scarred from the early battle, and Tony wants to take his hand to his mouth, kiss each finger at least once. He spares both of them from this cheese fest by clinging to Steve’s waist and tilting his head upwards, brushing a kiss against his chin.
“Stop moving,” Tony chastises when Steve makes the ghost of a motion to pull away. Even then, though, he peppers his words with kisses, following along the line of Steve’s jaw, his silky skin with only the lightest touch of stubble.
He hurries to his bedroom again to pick up his old, extremely warm and comfortable duvet, and when he goes back, Tony’s eyes widen.
“Captain,” Howard replies, intrigued. He had expected a hardened, grizzly warrior. Instead, the man in front of him looks like a painted image of a knight – the beautiful, almost angelical image dreamed up mostly by those who have never known a real battle. Howard half-expects him to inform him he has just defeated the dragon that kept the princess prisoner. “I understand you wanted to speak to me?”
Rhodey doesn’t laugh. Instead he finishes placing the electrodes and sets his hand on Tony’s shoulder, letting him lie down again. “We’re ready to go.”
Tony gives a small shrug that doesn’t match the intensity in his eyes. “Yeah? I don’t know, it’s not an opportunity one gets every day. I wouldn’t mind making the most of it. But of course, it’s just an idea. If you don’t want…”
The water started light, with just a few thin drops, but it didn’t take long for it to grow stronger. As the rain drops grew ticker, it soon became impossible to look for anything, as it was getting harder to even see what was in front of him.
Of course, he was completely wrong. The dinner would just be another opportunity for them to fail at seeming like a happy couple, which could have disastrous consequences. It was hard to see all those gold, holier-than-thou pricks as a threat, but Tony had taken a look at their battle ships when they were touring the place, and it was good stuff. Underestimating them would be a mistake.
Steve's orgasm washes over him, and he comes all over his belly with a loud, embarrassing high-pitched sigh. It’s blinding, white-hot pleasure that stops Steve from seeing or hearing anything for a moment, and then he sinks down, boneless, into the mattress, Tony’s thrusts growing shorter and more urgent.
“Okay,” Steve said, his heart hammering in his chest. He removed his shirt in one hurried, nervous movement, as if he was pulling a band aid.
Someone who can dance with him.
Steve straightens his back, knowing his face is probably fully red by now. He isn’t sure of how Tony –
“Tony, this…” Steve's eyes dart away for a moment, looking towards the room around them, and Tony hurriedly leans closer, so close he can feel Steve’s hitched, panicked breaths.
Silence fell at his final words, suffocating like a cloud of smoke. Tony blinked rapidly, panting, as he stood up in an abrupt motion. He hurried towards the door, shaking, aware that he had said too little and too much at the same time.
see Steve again, it’s not by his own choice.
Howard clenches his jaw. “We cannot afford to spare any more soldiers.”
- he’s looking for.
Their weird sync continues, on the rare occasions Tony whips out the armor to help the team with a mission. Without the sex, though, it doesn’t extend to anything else.
When the music stops, Peggy’s hands go to his face, and she whispers, not a question,
Tony’s voice is also unrecognizable, hoarse and low as one of his hands goes to Steve’s neck, grabs his hair. “
“Oh, God, sorry,” Steve said, blinking raindrops away to try and get a look at the person. Then, a high-pitched yap startled him, and he knew who it was even before his eyes managed to focus on the man’s face. “You! You—were you following me?”
Howard doesn’t acknowledge it. Instead, he stalks to the corner of the room, where there is a chair, and sits.
Thor is next to them, sunbathing. As soon as he stands up, Tony finds out at least
“I really do. Tony and I, we—we’ve been through a lot.” He swallowed, and his eyes flicked towards Tony for one second, wide and glassy, before turning to Ayesha again. “Most of it wasn’t pretty. And for someone on the outside, it may seem impossible to think this could end up with us, here, together. I know,” his voice trembled just a little, the slightest amount, in a way anyone who didn’t know him wouldn’t be able to tell. “Because every time I thought about it, it seemed impossible to me, too. Many, many times.”
If he had known, he would never have entered the ship.
He sits up and, a few steps from him, Tony gives him a smile. His hands are in his pockets – his hair has tinges of grey, but he’s younger than he was the last time Steve saw him. Steve stands up and walks towards him, noticing he’s younger himself – younger as he was the first time Tony died.
The praise flows through Steve like a warm, pleasant wave. His head hangs back a little, falling over Tony’s shoulder, and Tony’s hands also climb up, cupping Steve’s pectorals, pushing them together and lifting them a bit.
inside of his goddamn ideal fantasy world, Tony thinks, his mouth curling in an involuntary smile.
“Oh.” Tony blinks. “It’s—it’s a little bigger than yours.”
Tony has no answer to that.
“Meeting the Captain can’t hurt,” Obadiah agrees, running his hand over his beard. “Perhaps we can gather information on his next assault.”
It was in one of those tiny, half-second long breaks that Tony heard someone clearing their throat. He was ready to ignore it completely, his eyes fixated on Steve’s glistening, already puffy lips, if Steve himself hadn’t grabbed Tony’s wrists, lowering his hands and putting some distance between them.
And Steve said yes.
Another sob.
“Sure, sure,” Steve doesn’t sound like he believes it, but his voice is amused, as if he thinks Tony’s just being modest. “Anyway – I thought we could have a day in, then. I finished the paperwork with the latest mission reports yesterday.”
fine, darling,” Stark drawled, and Steve was startled by his clear, sober voice– another rarity. “If you don’t mind me saying.”
“I’m fine,” Steve hissed, finally managing to clumsily get himself to stand up. God, he hated that cane. Hated having to use it, and, more than anything, how helpless he became without it.
His body moved almost without him noticing – and the keyword was
It’s an impulsive act, and, when he raises his head, he feels embarrassed, worried Tony will find it silly. But there are no words for the look on Tony’s face, when Steve’s eyes find his.
that Tony could even ask that, because, no—it’s not good, it’s so much more than good, it’s everything and Steve needs more, needs
reached a point where he was able to take care of two dogs and still balance his life and work like a regular person. He could not, in any imaginable circumstances, take in another stray.
When they got to Steve’s floor, Steve turned towards him and smiled – a large, sincere smile that knocked Tony’s breath right out of his lungs.
“You’re not listening to me.” Stark leaned in, his voice growing firmer. “You said he
“Absolutely.” She turned towards Steve. Aside from a small glint in her eye, you really couldn’t tell she hoping for a chance to get into his star-spangled pants. “What do you think, Captain? Should I tell my servants to set the table for us?” She said
Tony feels his face flushing. His head is dizzy, blood roaring in his ears at Rhodey’s words. He thought Steve could… but never like that. And now… Tony can’t keep his brain under control – Steve
Tony watches as he goes away, and when Steve turns his head to take one last look, he’s smiling, and Tony can’t help but smile back.
The stable boy turned rebellious hero - it’s quite the fairy tale.
Steve stared ahead, unable to focus on anything. Dummy, apparently mistaking his shock with hesitation, lunged for him, jumping to his lap in a move that would have been impossible for a dog that size that didn’t regularly defy the laws of gravity. He stretched his tiny body to give Steve light licks on his chin.
When they finally get out of Tony’s cabin, the door closes behind them. They stare at each other, standing awkwardly.
Some people could say what Tony’s doing is lying, but he disagrees, because he isn’t faking it at all when he grins back.
“So, are we, uh, going to watch the movie?”
hated it. He would have preferred to be turned back into a baby, if those were his only options.
It’s Tony, of course. But it’s Tony in a dark suit and a deep red tie, holding a glass in his hand. He has a smile on his lips, his characteristic goatee perfectly trimmed, and his hair is a light shade of grey, his features seeming more intense by the contrast.
“Go dance with your husband,” Steve says, because he doesn’t want Bucky or Sam to waste time worrying about him tonight. It’s their night. “I’m fine, Mr. Wilson.”
A few, fine strands of light escape through the curtains, letting Tony know it’s probably too-fucking-early o’clock. Steve is standing up, right next to the bed, and even in the dark Tony can see he’s wearing a t-shirt, which, no. He shouldn’t be wearing clothes. Who let him put on clothes?
Life with three dogs in one apartment wasn’t easy, but Steve made do. Having Sam and Bucky nearby definitely helped, and, though, in the past, he had been forced to spend a few weeks living off ramen to buy food for all his children (as Bucky put it), things became pretty stable once a few of his political cartoons went viral and he was hired to draw for an extremely popular webcomic. The payment wasn’t anything exorbitant, but it paid his bills and allowed him to work from home and spend time with his dogs, so Steve wasn’t complaining.
Steve’s lips twitch in that blinding smile he was trying to keep down. “I do,” he says, voice giddy. Tony feels himself grinning back.
Before he… stayed behind.
Steve blinked, momentarily too shocked for words. A rush of blood climbed over his neck, and although the suggestion was—was
“Steve?” Stark called, and it vaguely occurred to Steve it was probably not the first time he'd done that. “Darling,
Steve feels like he’s floating, and he thinks he must’ve fallen asleep, because the light touches of Tony caressing his neck and kissing his face are too good to actually be happening. He forces his eyes to stay open, though, reluctant to miss that sight of Tony, over him, touching him. He’s so beautiful it’s impossible, and since this seems to be a night for impossible things, Steve wants to at least believe he can be Tony's a little longer.
As the hours went by, walking with Steve through the MET’s hallways, watching the way he frowned thoughtfully at a few pieces and stopped to analyze every detail, Tony’s thoughts changed. Museums could be fun, he realized. Museums could be… witty, and smart, and sweet. Really, museums were so, so…
The grin that takes over Bucky’s face is almost giddy. “Shuddup.” He pushes Steve’s shoulder. “I mean it, okay? If I catch you alone by the snacks table, I’m throwing you out.”
“This is bad,” Steve said, as soon as they stepped inside the bedroom.
“Yeah,” Tony interrupts, because he doesn’t want Steve to be sorry, now. He just wants him to be there. “I’m sorry, too, but.”
He took frantic steps, and it was a miracle he didn’t knock his toe on anything as he walked around the couch. Steve had his face turned towards the cushion, and Tony could see his back, see how he was shaking. His sobs were being muffled by the cushion, and he had no idea Tony was there, awake.
Before Steve arrives, Tony looks at the pictures.
“He’s still adapting, I know, you’ve said it a couple hundred times already. But that doesn’t explain anything, Tony. All jokes aside, okay, he isn’t ready for sex, I get that. But how does him not adapting to the 21st Century stop him from kissing you? Or holding your hand? Or, I don’t know, actually acting like your boyfriend at all?”
So Tony is back at number two. And, see, this one – it makes Tony’s heart ache, sometimes, because he so wishes he could take matters in his own hands, here. He wishes he could grab the lapels of Steve’s old, grandpa shirts and kiss the life out of him, regardless of who saw it, to show Steve it was okay, he can have this now. He so, so can.
He never tells anyone.
On the third day, Steve went on his walk alone. He knew he was maybe overreacting – tons of dogs went missing every day, and worrying about them all was sure to drive anyone insane – but he couldn’t help it. He had always loved dogs, and he had felt a special connection to the fluffy Pomeranian, with his bright, curious, brown eyes. It broke his heart to imagine how scared and confused he must be, desperately trying to come back to an owner who couldn’t care less about him.
Steve’s hand goes down, blindly finding the band of Stark’s underwear, his back pressed to Stark’s chest. Steve pulls it, causing a light snap, and Stark gasps against his mouth.
“Sir, I suggest you take the call,” freaking
, is what Tony means.
“Ross claims it’s impossible,” Natasha says, her voice just the slightest amount quieter.
“Uh… yeah,” the man said, after a moment of silence. “Yeah, yeah, he totally is.” He made a flippant gesture. “He’s probably just roaming around, it’s fine.”
Steve raised his eyebrows. “Is he yours?” he asked, uncertain. In his arms, the dog only nestled closer, not showing any sign of recognition.
“Sometimes,” Steve agrees. His hand comes up to Tony’s hair and ruffles it. “But don’t go getting any ideas in that genius brain of yours, ok?” His other hand, still around Tony’s waist, gives him a light squeeze. “You’re stuck with me, mister. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.”
Tony lets out a noise, quickly forcing his eyes away from the sight of Steve’s big, warm hand interlaced with his and the thin, discreet gold band, right on Steve's ring finger.
He could feel Stark’s gaze on him as he settled in. Hurriedly, he pulled the covers up, not wanting to feel exposed.
“He adores you,” Stark said, sounding amused. Then, in a whisper Steve couldn’t be sure he wasn’t imagining, he added, “I can hardly blame him.”
A soft meowing sound announced Stark’s cat’s presence. Steve felt as it climbed next to him, curling in a warm ball next to his thighs.
Steve’s answer is weak, his voice thin.
Steve would have laughed, he really would, if it didn’t seem like every cell in his body was catching on fire. His mind fills with a single image of himself and Tony and—
, he thought. Inhale. Exhale.
Steve takes a sharp breath. It shouldn’t feel big, to do something like this, but... it does. It feels as important as the times Steve has faced threats against the world, and even a little scarier.
“Thought you said there hadn’t been any progress,” Steve says drily. The man at the door smiles at him, his lips curling upwards just the tiniest bit.
Steve sighs, looking at him with those half-lidded, glass blue eyes, and boy, isn’t he a vision like this, sleepy and pliant. Tony starts working on those muscles he knows so well by now, with steady, firm squeezes of the back of his neck.
The topic of sexuality comes up right after a mission, of all times. They’re both already in their casual clothes, most of the debriefing hell thankfully already handled (except for the report that, of course, Steve will submit later).
“Hello,” Rogers says, breathless. Howard has no doubt the man completely forgot his presence the second Tony stepped inside the room. For a moment, he feels almost as though he’s intruding, because Rogers’ focus on Tony is almost inappropriate. Howard knows better than to be fooled by it, though.
Steve closed his eyes, a rebellious sigh leaving his lips without him meaning to.
It’s such a strange feeling, having time as an ally rather than a curse, but Steve comes to accept it, gets used to it. He talks to Tony a lot, loving listening to his voice, loving making him laugh, loving even arguing with him when they inevitably do. He loves Tony’s skin and his armor, but above all he loves the spot where they meet, where one ends and the other begins. That place inside Tony that’s so bright Steve thinks he may go blind and not miss being able to see.
He desperately wanted to get inside and forget about that ridiculous show he had given Stark in the middle of the night. But, of course, he couldn’t.
is a scam, Captain, and I’m not—”
. From Stark Industries? Steve had a vague memory of watching maybe two minutes of an interview with the man in some edition of the Oscars before switching channels. There had also been a huge scandal with the company earlier that year, when they decided to stop manufacturing weapons, but Steve didn’t remember the details.
,” Steve insists, but it’s a faint effort, because Tony is a man on a mission, here. He might have been caught off-guard last time, but now, he knows better. He has a sleepy, pliant Steve Rogers in his arms right now, and he’s definitely not letting him get off that easily – or, hm, okay, actually, poor choice of words, Steve can totally get
When the fireworks start, Steve’s first reaction is to reach for his shield.
“I like your bed,” Steve whispers, as if he’s telling him a secret.
And, oh—Tony really likes when he says that. It’s— recent, but it’s been happening a lot, lately. Each time, he thinks he likes it more.
. It’s just… so ridiculous, so juvenile. It’s absurd. It should be hilarious, but instead, Howard finds himself growing angry.
it just… was. I—I can’t explain.” He could, he really could, but he also
He forced himself to inhale deeply, his mind a whirlwind of thought. Was that all because of Bucky’s email? Was a single message enough to send him in such a miserable spiral of memories, even after all this time?
His voice is silky, dripping with honey and promises, but the interrogation at the end still poses a clear question, a way out for Steve if he needs one.
He leans forward, head resting on Steve’s shoulder, eyes never leaving his.
He shifts, leaning a little closer. Tony’s cock touches his cheek, wet and hot, but Steve ignores it, tilting his head until he finds Tony’s balls, nuzzling them just the slightest.
—” He thrusts forward, hands going to Steve’s ass and tightening it around his dick, and Steve has no idea what he’s saying, no idea what sounds are coming of his mouth, except that they all mean
he thought, lips curling in a reluctant smile.
But, right now, climbing on the bed next to Steve, he doesn’t feel angry. He just—wants Steve to come closer.
Steve’s lips curled in an unavoidable smile. He was glad he had closed his eyes – he had the feeling he wouldn’t be able to keep himself together if he was actually looking at Tony right now.
Tony knows he should take the time before turning. He knows. But the thought of Steve Rogers, alive and awake, in front of him, is enough to make all rational thinking leave his head, and he turns immediately, like a planet chasing the Sun’s orbit.
“I. I’m going for a walk,” he said, slamming the door loudly behind him.
Steve raised his hand to pet him, momentarily entranced. The dog licked his hand.
When Howard opens the door to his chambers,Tony jumps, startled.
A voice took him out of his momentary pleasure. “…Darling? Are you okay?”
As hosts, the Sovereign had many chambers, Tony noticed. He and Steve walked past endless golden corridors (
Tony rolls his eyes.
But the moment passes, and Howard’s head hurts, and he believes the Romanoffs’ bottle may be hidden behind the beans cupboard. So he keeps walking.
“Yes,” he says - too breathlessly, perhaps, too fast, but he—he doesn’t know how to do this, how to match Tony’s smoothness.
He presses a light kiss on Steve’s shoulder, already used to those times where Steve tenses up, clearly thinking his mind is somewhere else.
“This might be a little cold,” Tony warned, and it indeed was – his hands lay on Steve’s shoulders in a careful, slow motion, and yet they sent a chill down Steve’s back, slick with some kind of oil. “I’m gonna start on top, alright?”
Tony must nod in response, because he doesn’t say anything, letting the silence stretch between them in a way so uncharacteristic Steve wonders if he’s given the wrong answer.
Steve gave a stiff nod. Through his eyelids, he noticed when Stark turned off the lights, the darkness enveloping him.
“Uh, if I may—High Priestess, Ayesha, honey, I, I think this is a big misunderstanding,” Tony interrupted, desperate to defuse the situation. “Me and my hus—”
with him? Those things weren’t supposed to
On the weekends, after their first walk of the day, Steve would leave the three of them at Sam and Bucky’s apartment and head down to the shelter where he'd had Monet checked for a chip and now volunteered.
And then the elevator doors opened, and Steve got out, and there was no kiss but really, that had been even better. The doors closed, and Tony rested his head on the wall and smiled like an idiot at the ceiling.
“Okay,” he says, pressing a kiss to Steve’s forehead.
“Let it go,” Steve finally,
Steve tensed up. “But what?”
His hope is to distract Tony enough to get him naked. Instead, his attempts grow clumsier as the kiss grows harder, and Steve ends up popping a few buttons of his shirt off, in his hurry to remove it.
“Uh, right,” Stark said. He didn’t coo over the dog at all when Steve handed him over, which bothered Steve more than it should. “You see, he’s notoriously camera shy, that one.”
Steve finishes buckling his belt, then walks to the pile and pulls out his shirt and jacket. His tie is easier to spot, hanging from the corner of the mattress, but he doesn’t bother putting it on, picking it up and stuffing it in his pocket instead.
“He won’t say anything,” Tony counters. “Besides, it’s not as if you will be meeting for the first time.”
have known, right off the bat, who it was.
want to?”
“That’s… that’s great,” Stark said, and it was probably Steve’s imagination, but his voice sounded a little strangled. “I’ll turn the lights off, then, if it’s okay with you, darling. If… if you need anything, please, don’t hesitate to wake me up.”
Tony huffs out a breath as he becomes aware of his surroundings. The soft, welcoming feel of his king-sized bed, along with the pleasant warmth next to him, is rudely interrupted by movement that makes some of the covers slip away from Tony’s shoulder.
Steve can’t hold back a chuckle. Tony’s grin grows, pleased.
“Your son’s hand,” Roger replies matter-of-factly. “In marriage.”
They keep going, each setting their own pace, a cascade of noises and praise flooding the room. The sounds echo in Steve’s ears, and it’s impossible for him to focus, but he can vaguely grasp Tony’s usual rambling, filled with wonder and admiration, and Stark’s breathy endearments, sometimes whispered as if they aren’t meant for anyone else to hear, not even Steve.
Just as he says that, Tony’s hand slides over to Steve’s stomach, strong, skillful fingers barely touching him, knowing full well just the lightest brush will drive Steve crazy. His hands come up and down, teasing, never going below Steve’s belly button, deliberately nowhere close to his already throbbing cock.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, as soon as he comes closer. Tony looks up at him, eyes wide.
Steve knows well how – by keeping crazy hours working on projects and only going to sleep when absolute exhaustion hits, completely messing up his biological clock. But this isn’t the time to go into another lecture about Tony’s work habits. “Let’s get you out of these clothes,” he says instead. He loosens Tony’s tie, taking advantage of the way he’s staring blankly ahead to start unbuttoning his shirt.
He’s still feeling a little giddy at the reception, as if Vision and Wanda’s happiness is in the air. As he watches Sam and Bucky grow more and more immersed on a trivial discussion that Steve is certain neither of them care much about, he decides to step aside—whatever is this thing going on between his two best friends, it’s a thing they haven’t decided to talk to Steve about yet, so Steve thinks it’s better to give them some privacy to deal with it when it becomes too evident.
His jaw is lax, his mouth helpless as Tony keeps going, the stretch of his lips mixing with the slick, continuous movement of Stark’s dick inside of him.
“Because you already know,” Howard tells him. The burn on his throat is pleasant enough to keep him talking. “The words under our banner – you’ve read them. ‘Made of iron’. That’s what Stark men – you and me – are, Tony.” Another sip. “And iron, you see, it’s quite useful, for many things. It’s strong and it makes great weapons.”
A stunned silence followed his words. There was something cold in Steve’s voice, but also burning. Tony blinked in shock as he inhaled deeply, apparently composing himself before continuing.
“Yeah,” Tony says. He’d be upset, but, honestly, he’s a little filled with a scientist-like wonder at the thought Steve could genuinely think that. Not only because it’s something he didn’t foresee in any of his theories, but because he has a feeling there’s an insight there he hasn’t grasped yet, but he feels he’s very close to.
He watches as they run to her. Oh, to be young and unafraid of death.
Stark gave him a satisfied nod. “Yup. So I started looking for you, and, of course, now I had company,” he gestured towards the tiny Pomeranian, who gave an excited yap as if he understood every word. “I think he’s meant to be, like—a spirit guide, maybe? Anyway, I started calling him Dummy and it just stuck.” He shrugged. “It was really stressful to be around him at first – no offense, but I’m more of a cat person – but soon I found out
And he was so, so tired.
After hours walking around his neighborhood, Steve was feeling a little defeated. He also didn’t find anyone looking for the puppy, online or otherwise, which proved to him that, unfortunately, the dog probably
“We can talk to him,” Tony says, standing up, walking towards the panel. Bruce looks at him puzzled, but he continues, touching and marking specific spots for FRIDAY to copy. “I can develop a couple of these in an hour. Half an hour, maybe. We modify it so it responds to Cap’s brainwaves, and someone can get inside his fantasy, and—”
His eyes dart around the large room. There’s a scribe boy next to Obadiah, taking note of his every word with unfailing precision. Jarvis is next to him, his posture very still and eyes focused, expressionless, exerting his wonderful ability of hiding in plain sight.
He cursed, fist pushing back to slam against the door in a way he would never admit how painful it felt.
And there is that longing look again, and Steve doesn’t care for it. He raises himself slowly and turns a little, pulling Stark to kiss him over his shoulder. The kiss grows long, Stark’s scruff a little stingy around Steve’s already puffy lips.
