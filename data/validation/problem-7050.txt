Peggy shifts to face her. “I am going to tell you what I told my niece Sharon when she went to join SHIELD. People would much rather see you in the places they think you should be but you need to fight and show them that you’re brave enough to be there.”
“Shhh. Pep is on the phone,” he says and smirks at the bright red color that spreads over her murderous face.
“Now Ben don’t be rude. If Mr. Stark wants to talk lets hear him out.” She walks back inside motioning for him to follow.
Bucky gives a hard laugh at that. “And she’s a troublemaker? Oh I’m going to love seeing you run around like a chicken with his head cut off.”
Tony files out of the door with the two women behind him. Over his shoulder he calls, “I’ll be back as soon as I can Kiddo!”
“Why don’t we go try these on?” Steve says as he turns. He stops and looks down when he feels her tug at the clothes he is holding.
“Bruce and I will keep digging through these schematics,” says Nat. “You and Sam start narrowing the list.”
Bucky hesitantly followed behind her. As they passed the snack table Steve made a thumbs up gesture and turned it up and down with a questioning look on his face. When Bucky just shrugged he threw up his hands. Bucky flipped him off as they disappeared down the hallway, towards the bedrooms. Nat held open the door to the spare bedroom, and he stepped in. She followed after, closing the door.
“And we agreed that I’d bring you here. Didn’t say shit about getting you in.” He yells when she jams a widow bite into an open wound. “FUCKING HELL!!!”
When he rears back she knocks the gun from his grasp and connects the junction of his neck with the end of the baton, flipping the electric shock on. He spasms and falls to the ground as another guard rounds the corner in the alleyway behind her. She dives behind a dumpster as he fires at her. While bullets impacted into the metal and trash, she draws her own gun.
She nods before handing Mari a tissue. “Thank you for talking to me sweetie. I just need to finish up with Steve and Tony. Okay?”
“Damn it he dared!” Steve curses as he launches himself out of the closet and breaks into a full run out into the hall.
“Yeah.” Tony turns and grabs a box of wipes as he retreats out the door. He wipes at his suit hoping that the damp toilettes can save the fabric. “Ew.”
“It’s an adjustment, I’ll admit. But I’m glad you’re here. Really. You belong with us at the tower. Whether that’s as an Avenger or Mari’s new babysitter I don’t care. That’s up to you.”
Steve pauses in scrambling to lean over and open the oven. Inside Sam can see a roasted chicken. Steve smirks, closes the door, and goes back to the eggs and bacon.
“Well you’re past most of the paperwork and you’ve been cleared to have a child placed with you. Now it is just a matter of matching you up with one. You were wanting to adopt an infant boy?”
“Hey!” He moves the container to the other side of the blender and tickles her sides. “You want to ruin dinner too? Mae and Ben would be disappointed.”
Steve sighs. “I’m sorry Kiddo.” He puts the cleaning supplies in a cabinet under the counter then walks over to scoop up Mari. “Papa just got a little stressed. We want today to go really well for you. We promise, you’ll really like it.”
“That was mean. I’m sorry.” Steve reaches behind him and grabs the discarded cold compress. He presses it where Tony’s hand is clutching his bruised side. He holds it there even as Tony rests his hand over Steve’s. Steve leans forward and presses his lips to the back of Tony’s neck. Speaking against his skin he says, “I’m glad you’re alright.”
“Scoot your caboose Bennie.” Mae bumps him with her hip until he moves over. She pats the cushion on her other side. “Well come on, you can’t see them from over there.”
“On the servers. We keep these files as a hardcopy and if someone makes a search relating to them I hear about it. Can’t hack paper.”
“I got it.” Bucky says before she unfolds herself out of her chair. He grabs two mugs and pours the coffee in them. Then he goes to the fridge and grabs whipped cream before spiralling that on top. He throws the can back in the fridge before grabbing a cinnamon stick from a container on the counter next to the machine and sticking it in one of the mugs. He walks over and hands her the mug with the cinnamon stick. “Here.”
Steve rolls his eyes as they start fighting and wrestling again. “Come on guys…guys. Guys! Knock it off! Don’t make me-”
By the time they have the kitchen and dishes clean, the pizza shows up. They put on Alice in Wonderland as they eat the pizza. When it is time for another round of Mari’s dialysis they watch Tarzan before turning in for the night. The next morning, when Steve comes in to check on her after his jog, he finds her under the bed again. He pries her out from underneath it and massages the soreness out of the muscles in her neck. They have a quiet breakfast where the biggest thing that happens is Tony accidently pouring coffee into Mari’s orange juice and taking a mouthful. Steve laughed so hard at Tony’s disgusted and gagging face that orange juice came out of his nose. Later in the day Tony showed Mari his suits and how they worked. They ate leftover pizza for lunch and made mac n’ cheese for dinner. After a dialysis session they put Mari to bed. A few hours later, when Tony climbs into bed he finds Steve laying wide awake and staring at the ceiling.
A second later Steve walks through the doors again with his eyes cast down at the floor. He rubs at the back of his neck and glances up at them. Bruce meets his eye and looks at Tony with a pointed look. Steve looks at his husband’s tense shoulders and the bruises and scrapes littering his torso and arms. He walks over taking off his cowl. Bruce takes the shirt Tony had tossed aside and lays it next to him. When Steve is closer they nod at each other and Bruce leaves with a reassuring squeeze to Tony’s shoulder. Tony looks up to watch Bruce leave but his eyes catch on his husband. He glances away and to his hands.
Steve places his hand on Tony’s bouncing thigh. Tony stills and looks into the deep blue eyes of his husband. The brunette gives him a forced smile before staring back out the windows of the lobby. They are sitting in the cushioned chairs of Avengers Tower waiting for the arrival of the biggest change in their lives since they said “I do”. Tony was having trouble staying still as anxiety rolled off him in waves. Steve watched quietly, giving his husband firm touches here and there to remind him he was not doing this alone. Tony suddenly stands and straightens his suit as a beaten up Honda parks across the street. Steve looks up to see Mari’s social worker, he’s pretty sure her name is Ms. Flander; help her out of the car. When she stepped away to remove a large roller out of the trunk, Mari threaded her arms through the straps of a purple backpack. He stands and takes Tony’s hand in his own. This is actually happening. Through all the arguments, paper work, and red tape, they’re finally starting their family.
“As long as I can reach the keyboard I always have security clearance,” she replies in a petulant tone as it fades down the hall.
“No. Clint and Sam did another sweep around the coordinates we got, still just abandoned warehouses.”
Tony’s face does not change but Steve can see his shoulders loosen up a fraction. Steve’s mouth quirks up. He pushes himself up the bed and climbs behind his husband. With a firm grip he massages at his shoulders. “You need to relax Pip. Worrying isn’t going to do anything except give you even more grey hair.”
“Clint also says the tooth fairy is real and that’s-” He pales when he sees her jaw drop and her eyes widen. “ANYWAY, we’re picking out schools for you.”
Tony keeps an eye on him for a moment longer before turning back just in time to see Mari sneak another strawberry.
There is an awkward silence that hangs in the air as everyone just stares at each other. After a minute Mae asks, “That photo you were looking at earlier was taken a few hours after she was born. Would you…like to see more baby pictures?”
Tony scoffs. "That pompous ass? No, he spent all that money bringing his family home over to the states. I'd bet Dummy that his Caped Italian hoo-ha is sitting in there right now."
As they escape the playground, Bucky tugs a tissue out of his back pocket and tries to clean up her face. “Your parents are going to kill me.”
“That is true, but I heard from Natasha that you did much more than that.” Thor says, leaning in with a knowing smirk.
“You’re seriously asking me? Mr. Fabulously Insecure? The guy who is still freaking out about the fact that you somehow convinced me and everyone else that letting ME raise a tiny human being was a good idea? Steve, Baby, I’m still stuck on how to have a conversation with her and I’m already at a severe disadvantage with the whole no cussing thing.”
Ms. Flander looks down to give Mari a reassuring smile but sees Mari is still looking over her shoulder. She shakes her arm. Mari snaps her head back to look at her and the social worker jerks her head towards Steve. Mari turns her gaze forward and Steve feels his smile broaden when her face lights up.
The two heroes laugh as they rush to do what she says. Mari calls out directions but she stumbles over the words and has to keep the pages close to her face. They repeatedly have to go to the pages themselves which leads to the couple bumping into each other and trying to work around the other. Things quickly go downhill when Tony grabs a pan to close to the heat.
“Speaking of toys, THESE,” Tony motions with wide arms to the stuffed animals on the bed. “All yours. And over here is your closet.”
“Hashtag shut your face and smile.” Tony goes back to invading Rhodey’s space and holds up the camera again.
“His name is Chameleon. He’s a Russian spy turned mercenary,” Natasha says as she walks around the table that is projecting an image of the criminal in question.
He decides to check in on her before he heads out. He cracks the door open wide enough to poke his head through and hopes he does not wake her. His heart drops to his stomach when he sees an empty bed.
Tony grunts, not looking up from the file in his hands. Steve stands and leads her back to the elevator. “Ma’am.”
Mari shakes uncontrollably as tips of a dark clawed hand reach under the bed. She jumps at the sound of a sharp chirping. The hand jerks back and the monster stands. It growls deep in its chest as the chirping cuts off with a beep.
Steve nods. “Good. In the meantime, since we have a name now, throw out some of your espionage lines. Sees if anyone knows who he’s been talking to. Tony when you get a chance, maybe send out some of the Iron Legion to see if they can maybe find Buck from the skies. I have a feeling he’s gonna be sticking close.” He turns to leave.
“Be careful! And lang-“ Steve rushes to Tony's side and takes the pan. He winces and roughly shoves the searing pan onto the stove again. “-HOT!”
“It’s just because Steve and Tony are so high profile. If anything goes wrong it’ll be all over the news so CPS is covering their butts.”
“Come see my room. Come see my room.” Mari pulls on their hands hard. She tugs them around Steve and Tony and down the hall.
“A five year old human child! Although the human part is still under review. I’m starting to think maybe she’s an android in disguise.”
Tony turns back when Ms. Flander says, “Mari seems to be settling in just fine, but I do have one concern. I spoke with Dr. Krevin. He says you cancelled Mari’s last two appointments.”
“Egg whites? Seriously? Are we superheroes or fucking geriatrics?” Clint demands but the sound of a register going ka-ching sounds over him. “…what the fuck?” The sound goes off again.
She closes the folder and picks up her sketch book. “You’re the man from the museum right? Your picture is in Papa’s exhi-“
“They already hate me. Looking like I’m from Mr. Roger’s neighborhood isn’t going to change that. Besides, you’re stressing out the k-i-d-d-o.” Tony nods down at Mari who is looking between the two with her hands fretting at her hair.
“Roger that. Hawkeye, I’m coming up on your nine o’clock. Wasp, you help get that jet up in the air. We cannot let Strucker go. Falcon, give us air support. If you can hear Thor moving around it’s not going to be long before he comes bursting through that rubble on his own.”
Steve picks her up and puts her on his lap. He then rubs her shoulder making small shushing sounds. “It’s okay. Let me take a look.”
Tony blinks an eye open to glance over his shoulder. “You uh…planning on doing some abdominal crunches?” He rocks his hips back only to wince at the pain that shoots up his spine. “Shit.”
She takes a deep breath and climbs to her feet. She lowers a shaky foot to the next step and moves from the railing, slowly releasing her grip. As she steps away, the structure gives another loud groan and jerks. She yelps and flings back to the railing.
As they round a corner Steve sees what he has been dreading. The edge of the park and the start of the city. Bucky cuts along the line of scrimmage in a football game as the players throw themselves at each other. They jerk to a stop at the sudden interruption and create a mob of people to be clustered in Steve’s path. Instead of dancing around Steve stops by the young man holding the football.
“My money is on one Margaret Liddel.” He steps closer and pulls out a sheet from the folder with her picture on it. “Not long after the two became engaged we started having problems with the system. Files would go missing, they’d be altered, corrupted, you name it, it happened and Paulson’s file was always one of the ones affected. The more we looked into it the less we found.”
The young tech laid against the console as the throbbing in his head grew more and more pronounced. With each pulse it felt like a bat to the head. Or a Russian bitch punching him in the face. He pushes his roller chair away from the computer and across the room to his bag. He rummages around until he finds his bottle of pain meds. The bottle keeps slipping from his hands as he struggles to twist off the child proof cap with two of his fingers in a splint. Just as he starts to make head way on the lid the metal door swings open and clangs against the stone causing him to jump. The motion sends the bottle flying.
Clint shrugs. “I can’t say if she’ll talk or not but...she does want to. Even if she won’t say it out loud.”
“Come on. Out from under there you little bed bug,” he says as he slides her out and lifts her up to sit on the bed. He remains kneeling in front of her and she rubs the sleep from her eyes. “Why were you under the bed? Did you have a nightmare?”
The ball spirals through the air and plows square into the back of Bucky’s knee. He stumbles and rolls across the ground. He uses the momentum of falling forward to rise back to his feet. He gets half way up before he is tackled back to the ground.
“We’re not together anymore and now is not the time for this conversation,” says Rhodey, a blush spreading across his cheeks.
“And who’s to say that he suddenly won’t be himself again but you won’t notice because you’re too busy trying to save him.”
With a shriek she dives for the door and tears down the hall into her room. She slams the door and wretches the window on the opposite wall open. When she hears the crashing of the monster clambering down the hall, she ducks under the bed. The door to her bedroom slams open and she covers her mouth to hold in her yelp. She watches as dark legs move to the window and hears two sharp sniffs. The legs turn away from the window and step back to the middle of the room.
“The doctor is h-handling it.” The nurse scrambles to continue. “She’ll be okay but Doctor Callaghan isn’t putting in a new catheter.”
He gives Tony an exasperated smirk before ruffling Mari’s hair with a gentle hand. “I think we’ll be fine after some ice cream.”
“We’re on call for the day. I was going to help Nat with looking for Chameleon but I can stay here if there’s something you’d rather do...” Steve sets the mug aside and leans against the counter.
“No.” Tony pulls him down so he can peck a kiss on his husband’s lips. “But that is all I have answers for.” He gives the back of his neck a squeeze before letting go and turning to follow Mari to the elevator.
The tech screams and shoots his hands up into the air. “I don’t work here anymore. He fired me.” He jabs a finger at Nefaria.
“I never really thought much of how you presented yourself. Walking peacock if you ask me. But Maggie, Mari’s mother, she didn’t trust you or anyone in your company. She definitely didn’t trust SHIELD and Hydra. There was a lot you surround yourself with that she didn’t trust. Now, Maggie was a bit eccentric but she was never wrong. I never knew how she knew the things she knew but she did. If she knew of a reason not to trust you and your organizations then I’m damn well not going to forget that when dealing with you.”
Ms. Flander looks up to see Tony poking his head through the balcony door. Steve is hovering worriedly over his shoulder.
Tony surges back up and captures his husband’s mouth. He bites and sucks at Steve’s lower lip and the soldier cannot stop the groan it pulls out of him. Tony reaches up and runs his hands through Steve’s sweaty blonde locks, ruffling his helmet hair.
“Jarvis is down?” Now that definitely was not right. Jarvis ran most of Tony’s life. There was no way Tony would not shut him down without a good reason. Without another word he went to his ruck sack and pulled out his satellite phone. It was a Stark phone and encrypted against even SHIELD.
He turns her around, much more gently this time. He ruffles her hair as well. “Good. Now bed.” He waits for her to get at least halfway to the hall before returning to the table. “Do we have a location?”
Tony pries Mari’s hands off his shirt and hands her over before taking Bruce’s seat. He gathers the bits of metal, then picks up what’s left of the head.  Without looking up he holds out his hand and says, “Hand me Mari’s glasses.”
“I’m sorry Kiddo. Papa has gotta go find his friend. He needs me.” Steve tears himself away and steals himself against the screaming wails behind him to go get his bike.
Tony starts to relax when a small smile forms on her lips. He clears his throat and hands the toy back to Dr. Krevin.
“Alright Hannibal, let's get you cleaned up.” Tony walks away with Mari chattering on about what happened.
Tony chuckles as he rights the recipe so it is facing Mari. “Just tell us what the book says to do.”
“That’s not why I’m-well not entirely I-“ Tony sighs and rubs his temples. “May I come in and just explain why I’m here?”
Mari lifts onto her tiptoes to look onto the table top. Her eyes catch on one of the sheets with a group of smiling children on it. “Are you buying me friends?”
She nods and wraps her arms tighter around his neck. He runs his hand up and down her back as his breath comes back to him and his heart returns into a normal pace. After the thrumming in his head dies down and he can hear more than his own heartbeat, he groans while he climbs back to his feet.
Tony arches an eyebrow and looks to the assassin. With a smirk he asks, “How do I get in on some of that action?”
The girl turns to glare at Mari. “No. He’s never wrong. And neither am I. Better get that into your head now Stark.”
They get their small feast of hot dogs and find a quiet spot to eat them. Tony and Steve thank every deity above that Mari ends up liking the tofu dog. At least until Steve lets her try a bite of a chili dog. Then she proclaims that one as the, “dog above all other dogs”. That in turn leads to a debate between her and Bucky about whether the chili dog or the New York dog reins supreme. They stay in the shade for a little while until Steve catches sight of some paparazzi making their way across the park. He sighs and gets everyone moving.
“Calm down, it’s a genetic disorder.” Bucky puts Mari on the ground behind him. “And she only reacted after your kid pushed her down.”
Tony grabs one of the bottles Steve placed on the counter and takes a closer look at it. “Ah. My arch-nemesis. Adderall, we meet again.”
Mari only sighs and takes the hand. Before the woman can start leading the way she turns to Tony and says, “Don’t forget what I said about those kids.”
“I suppose that’s Pops’ problem,” Tony says in a dry voice and shoots a glare at Steve over his shoulder. “See you at breakfast grease lightning.” Tony gives Bucky’s shoulder a light punch before walking down the hall.
Nat reaches into her jacket’s inside pocket and pulls out a baggie with a large caliber bullet inside. She tosses it and he scrambles to catch it. Clint hides his smile by eating another hand full of popcorn. Bruce dumps the bullet into his hand to examine it closer. His eyebrows raise when he sees the red star painted on the bottom. He looks to Nat.
Out front Tony slides into the passenger seat of an armoured SUV. He turns to Happy and shoots him a smirk. “Let’s roll out.”
“Clint mostly. He likes giving her material that he can't use without fear of reprisals.” Sam flips over the empty bowl and plops projectile porridge into it.
Mari leans around the opposite side to look at him. “You’re War Machine right…or is it Iron Patriot?”
Steve closes the distance. Now that he is closer he can see the dirt and blood speckled on his husband’s shirt. There is a dark bruise forming on his cheek bone and he has an arm wrapped around his waist. His attention gets pulled to behind Tony when he hears a small voice go, “Papa?”
As Mari turns and tries to burrow her head out the other side of the hanging of clothes she hears Tony say, “Purple and yellow? Really Steve? At least try to coordinate. Here.” She pokes her head out in time to see him trade a pair of jeans with silver stitching and a pale grey scarf with the yellow leggings Steve was holding. Steve rolls his eyes before turning back to Mari.
“I’m just gonna…” Steve flails a hand towards the hall. Then he is skirting around the couch and darting out of the room.
“Ok.” He finishes tying her sneakers then lifts her off the bed and onto the floor. “Go tell your Pops to change clothes so we can head out. And if he’s washing dishes still, explain to him what a dishwasher is used for.”
“Need to barrow this son.” He swipes the ball out of his stunned hands and throws it as hard as he can. Steve takes off soon after it.
“Wait!” They look up at the sound of Mari’s shout and see her chase after the frog that is hopping away. She realizes she forgot her crayons and scrambles to pick them. After she gathers the crayons in her arms haphazardly she returns to her chase. “Don’t leave! I have to study you! It’s for science!”
“Which is why they're in the shake.” Tony turns on the blender. When her hands fly up to cover her ears against the loud whirring he covers her hands with his. Once the mix turns into a thick liquid he switches it off and pours it into two cups before screwing a lid onto the smaller one. He hands her the smaller cup and holds his up. “Salute.” They tap their drinks together before taking a swig. He chuckles when her face screws up. “Don't like it?”
“Oh is someone jealous?” Tony shoots back. “Don’t worry. We’ll get one too.” He leans to the opposite side and into Rhodey’s personal space. Holding up the camera so the two of them are in the frame he says, “Smile!”
“She barely broke the skin. Maybe next time he wants to hurt other kids he’ll remember he’s not the only one that can throw a punch.”
“No need to be so formal. You can call us Steve and Tony or something else if you want. We’re going to be family now. No Misters needed,” says Steve.
Tony turns and stares at the door Steve took Mari through. “I’ve got three broken ribs and a bruised ego. I’ve been better.”
With that he disappears around the corner and they soon hear the swish of the elevator doors opening and closing. Steve scratches at the back of his neck with a heavy sigh. He stares down at the papers scattered across the counter between him and Tony. He looks at Tony from under his lashes. Tony glances up and catches his eye.
Tony rolls his eyes. “And what else is new?” He claps his hands and turns back to the table. “Okay, we have an ass to kick and a location to kick it in.” He selects the New Jersey location and enlarges it. “Sam and I will come in from th-“
“Well yeah but…I’m pretty sure the reason HYDRA froze me every few years was so they could save on food stuffs. You’ve got to spend a fortune on food alone.” He picks up two of the platters and moves them to the dining table.
“The nanny. Good day ma’am.” With that he turns and goes to scoop up Mari, only to find her gone. After a quick glance around, he sees she’s over by the original little boy. He has his toy back and they are talking. Bucky walks over and scoops her up. “Time to go squirt.” Bucky glances back behind him to see the woman jerking her phone out of her bag.
“You make it sound like I go out jogging for the sole purpose of annoying him.” Steve says as he slides Mari her plate.
“That’s because Steve was meant to be a Dad…or maybe a Grand-dad considering his age…either way Steve is the paternal one. Not me.”
Clint rolls his eyes. "Point is they are made by a third party that likes to sell to both sides. So this could still be related to Count Douche-ula." He stares right into Steve's eyes when he says the nickname.
“Hm? Oh!” Steve stands and takes the baby from Tony’s outstretched arms. “Why don’t you go clean up?”
She steps forward and shoves the bear in her arms at him. That’s when he notices the bandage wrapped around its head.
“Good.” Tony straightens up and Steve frowns at him. “Start with a scan of Pep’s computer. Then I want you to scr-“
“And let me guess,” Steve turns towards Tony. “You’ve refused medical attention because you’re just fine.”
After being dismissed from the penthouse and dumping his dirty socks in his hamper, Clint made his way down to the Avenger’s nerve center. When he walked in, he found Nat and Bruce combing through chunks of information on the holotable.
“Yes. How come you said I was wrong when I asked if you were the man from the exhibit? You’re Papa’s friend right?”
Steve zips up his jacket as he walks down the hall to head out on his morning run. As he passes Mari’s door he stops and stares at it with a small smile. It was still hard to believe that this was happening. Steve could still remember the painful squeeze in his chest when he had been plummeting toward the ice and realized he was not getting the future that he and Peggy talked about. Then the sad resignation when he had woken up seventy years later and found his world was gone. Even when he had gone through the awkward courting that Steve and Tony called their dating life he had accepted that kids just were not going to happen for him. But when the self-proclaimed playboy had surprised him with a proposal he had begun to entertain the idea again. Finally, things were working out for him. Not in quite the order he had planned but like his mother always told him, beggars cannot be choosers.
“When are they coming over again?” Tony asks as he turns off the tablet and slides it away. He props his head up on his arm and looks over at his husband with a pout.
Tony stops trying to untangle the brush to give her a confused look. “Have you seen Princess Diaries?”
Mari jumps up and tugs at his pant leg. “But-but Daddy- Daddy, Papa’s trying to take away my cereal and make me eat yucky porridge.” She starts making grabby hand motions at him so he picks her up with a chuckle.
“Clint found some new recipes online.” Bruce says as he goes to one of his cabinets. He comes back with a brown bottle and hands it to Tony. “Here’s your iodide. Take Mari and go bond.” He kneels down and says to Mari in a stage whisper. “I bet if you say please he’ll show you the switch for the big A on the side of the building.”
Tony looks between the two images and grimaces. “That son of a-“ He glances at the top of Mari’s head. “…butternut.”
Black Widow’s tires squeal as she rounds a corner. As her bike speeds down the side road she hears half a dozen other bikes speed around the corner. She shoots a look over her shoulder. Four of them have faster models and are closing in on her. She leans further down, trying to create less drag. It does not give her much of an advantage and soon she is forced to duck as the goon on the bike next to her swings out a baton. This exposes the arm hole in his vest. She lashes out and lands a well-placed widow bite into his arm pit.
Steve rips open the package of bacon and throws the strips into the pan with a loud sizzle. Sam hands him another pack that he rips open to add to the pan. While they sizzle away he takes the bowl of egg mixture Sam hands him to pour in a separate pan and scramble.
“Because it was illegal to be anything but straight back then. I hated having to force myself to be something I wasn’t but I really wanted that white picket fence, kids, family dog…and I enjoyed being around Peggy so I thought if I had to pretend I wouldn’t mind if it was with her. But then I went in the ice and I thought I had lost my chance.” He couldn’t help the shivering that over took him. His body always started to tremble as he remembered the painful bite of the cold and the burn of ice water in his lungs.
Steve sighs and pushes Mari’s plate toward her again. “At least eat half your eggs and then we’ll go get ready. Ok?”
“I should be but the system is so bogged down I can barely do anything. I need something with more power.” Tony stands. “We’re going to have to cut this short fellas. Good work, we’ll call you.” He strides to the door and out into the hall. He hears Pepper say something to the scientists before rushing after him.
Steve sighs and rubs at the back of his neck. “I guess you’re right. I just don’t want to lose you again.”
They wait and the elevator quickly brings them back up to the apartment. The first thing they hear makes Tony groan in frustration.
“Sam. Sam Wilson.” He holds out his hand and Mari gently grips a finger to give it a quick shake before coiling back behind the couch. “I’m a friend of Steve’s.”
Tony can’t help the small smile that appears on his, even if it does not reach his eyes as he watches his husband.
“It also enhances the dreams.” Bruce brings up a study the Count did. “Makes them more real. Therefore the body’s reaction is more visceral.”
Sam and Steve look up to see Tony shuffling in with a dozing Mari on his hip. He’s in his sweats and black a shirt with his arc reactor shining through and Mari’s glasses hanging off the collar. Steve smiles to see Mari still in her Captain America pajamas with the sleeve straining around the cast on her arm.
“That we-“ Steve sighs. “Do we have to start this argument again so soon? I just want to go to the park with my husband and daughter. Please. After yesterday-“
“I am indeed ‘the’ god of thunder. Although I believe there may be another named, Zeus but I doubt he can match MY prowess in the battlefield for I have fought the serpent Hakurel.”
Tony blows him a kiss and turns back to his phone. “Jarvis run Margaret’s picture through SHEILD’s database.”
Steve turns and sees Mari at the pantry pouring Coco Crunchos into her mouth. “Mari no! You put those down right now.”
She frowns at the older woman. Was she serious? “I’m small. And sick. All I hear are reasons. I have more,” Mari says slowly.
“Like the red queen. Minus the whole having us beheaded. You’re going to have to wait until you’re ten before you start can trying to knock us off for the inheritance.”
“I pulled this out of the wall. It nearly hit the entertainment center.” Bruce holds out a large caliber bullet.
“You’ll have to switch to hemodialysis. Don’t worry, Mr. Stark pretty much owns all the equipment on this floor so I’m sure we have a machine you can use.”
Tony glances up from where he was wrapping a blanket around Mari. She had fallen asleep on him while they were waiting for Bruce to finish Bucky Bear’s surgery. He stands up as carefully as he can without jostling her. Then he takes slow steps to where Bruce has the bear laid out on the table. He’s got a collection of small metal parts sitting in front of him next to the bear. When Tony leans down for a closer look he threads a hand in her hair so he can keep her head pressed against his chest.
Tony nods and follows the doctor into the office. He did not know what exactly to expect but it was...more colorful than he thought it would be. The walls were the same shade of beige as the walls in the waiting room but these had brightly colored posters. All had smiling faces of children, animals, and cartoon characters. There was even a “Hang In There” cat poster. On the couch were pillows shaped and embroidered like emoticons and some of the shelves had an assortment of toys. Tony quirked an eyebrow at how high they were kept, far out of reach of grabby children. He followed the therapist to the opposite side of the room. Over by the windows was a rainbow colored circle rug with a couple bean bags and a larger chair. Mari was sitting on a green bag looking bored to tears.
The stranger looks up at her and his face melts into a soft expression. “…yeah. Your Pops. Anyway, I have something I need you to give him. It’s important.” He holds out the manila folder and Mari sees that his other hand has flesh fingers.
Tony looks over his shoulder and sees Mae set a tray with a pitcher of lemonade and glasses onto the coffee table. She sits on the couch next to a glaring Ben and picks up the pitcher.
They make it up the stairs and into the medical wing. The floor was mostly empty and Steve’s eyes quickly found Tony where he was being examined by Bruce and talking to Pepper’s secretary. As they got closer Steve could hear their conversation.
“Right away sir.” Happy pulls out into traffic after the click of Tony’s seat belt. “Everything in order?”
Mari climbs out from under the desk and wraps her fingers around his. He marches her back towards the door.
Without looking she tosses a shock pad and when it makes contact with his forehead he jerks and shakes before passing out. “Jackass.” She continues looking through files. It is not long until her eyes land on something. “Well that’s interesting…”
“Oh my god! Finally!” Clint takes a beer and grabs a seat. He leans back to balance on the back legs of the chair.
Bucky turns to Steve and opens his mouth only for Steve to interrupt with, “Don’t say it. You’re not going anywhere. Even Tony agrees with me on that. He’s just...being…”
“You said we’d go to Disneyland if she hacked Jarvis didn’t you?” Steve looks at him with an unamused look.
Ms. Flanders sighs in frustration again and holds Mari’s arms against her sides. Mari glances up before beginning to jitter.
“Then maybe skip the foreplay and fuck me already.” Tony lifts his hips so Steve’s cock slips along the cleft of his ass. He runs his hands along Steve’s spine, causing a shiver to jolt through the soldier. When he reaches the tight muscles of his ass he pulls him forward so even more delicious pressure is applied.
Steve rolls his eyes at Tony’s attempt at a deflection but says, “We’re parents now Tony. We know everything.”
They again have convince Mari to hold off on the Disneyland trip till the spring. She was not keen on this plan at first but Tony pointed out that while he said he would take her if she won he did not say when. He was pretty sure it was the only point that had saved them from a tantrum. Steve’s wound ends up healing two days after his return. The rest of their vacation is spent with lazy days of playing games, impromptu dancing, obnoxious singing, and getting certain children to promise to hack into Jarvis no more than once a week. Their little bubble together soon gets popped when Steve and Tony have to return to work. Steve went straight to active duty but Tony took a more administrative position. He trained with the team but stayed behind from missions unless Ironman with a Tony filling was essential. Luckily there had not been any missions where Tony could not send in his suit and control it from the tower. Because of his new role Mari was able to sit in the Avengers office with him while he worked. Steve tried to persuade him into taking her to the daycare but he was adamant that he would not let other people raise his kid. He would not make the same mistakes his parents did.
“Well if you ever change your mind, as a former playboy, I am more than happy to offer my contacts.”
She lowers the bear so she can glare at him full on. She takes a deep breath and straightens her back. Bucky can’t help but smirk when she reminds him of Steve. Steel in her spine and a look in her eyes that just dares him to take her on. And the pout was adorable.
“Do you honestly think Brit’s sound like that?” Steve asks as he pulls Mari’s medication out from the cupboard and sets it in front of Tony.
“Thanks for sharing Jim,” says Sam. “It’s good to hear things are getting better for you. It takes a lot of hard work to get to that point. Takes a lot more to stay there. You remember how I’ve told you that we carry our trauma around with us.” When most of the group nods, he continues. “Well people tend to think that recovery means we slowly unpack, piece by piece. That can be the case, sometimes. But most of the time, we just find better ways to carry it.”
Suddenly there is a large boom and a flare flies through the apartment. Mari shrieks and rushes into Steve’s arms, clinging to him. Everyone stands and turns towards the elevator as they hear rumbling music and thumping footsteps. But there are no vibrations from the steps.
Her eyes go down to the shadow moving under the door down the hall. The sound of shuffling paper and something knocking against the wardrobes can be heard through the door. Mari moves closer with soft footsteps.
She pays them little attention as she goes to the kitchen, puts her plate in the dishwasher, and comes back out drinking from her sippy cup. She looks around at all the adults staring at her. “...hi.”
“One 1940’s solider of the shiny variety, coming your way.” Clint hits a button and a side compartment pops open from his bike. He didn’t have enough time to grab his archery set before they left, but luckily Tony had stocked his bike with a spanking new cross bow. Complete with flash bang arrows.
He sighs and looks at his watch. He looks to Mari who is trying to secure her toy to one of the ornaments swinging parts. “Hey Kiddo, how about an early snack time?”
“Not if we don’t let it. Have Romanoff or Barton or Wilson or fucking Pym look. He’s a fucking Avenger now, for some reason, I’m sure he has little ant buddies all over the city that could dig up some dirt. Isn’t the whole point about this team thing ‘sharing the burden’?”
Bruce swipes the file across the screen and examines the next set of data. While on her mission, Natasha had sent him some encrypted data. As Jarvis was able to unlock files Bruce would comb through them. So far it had not been anything interesting, just studies on sleep patterns and the brain when it dreams. The newest file seemed to be a schematic of some sort of chip. When he leans forward he hears a rapping on glass. He turns towards the door and sees Tony with Mari riding piggyback. Mari waves from over Tony’s shoulder.
“Attagirl.” He pours the porridge into the bowl and then grabs a spice shaker to dust the top with cinnamon.
“Oh good because I’ve always feared the day when Avengers Tower would be attacked by a FIVE YEAR OLD.”
“Barton, what have I told you about moving through the vents?” Steve demands as Sam and Bucky pick their chairs back up.
“No!” She squeezes his thumb and wraps her other hand around his wrist. “We haven’t had snacks! We can still do apple crafts!”
When he comes into the room Tony is in the adjoining bathroom splashing cool water over his face. He wets a wash cloth and tries to clean some of the sweat from the back of his neck. Steve leans against the door frame, eyeing his flushed cheeks.
The nervous man snaps his mouth shut and looks dead ahead of him. The door opens and Natasha pushes him forward. He stumbles but leads the way. When a guard comes walking down from the opposite end of the corridor Natasha lays a soft touch to his lower back.
“Jarvis, lights on in the closet please.” From under the door they see the light come on. “Ok. On three. One. Two. Three.” He flings the door open and winces when Mari jerks back into his sore ribs.
“If Jarvis says nobody is in there, nobody’s in there.” When she still seems apprehensive he gives her the signature Stark smirk. “Hey, you’re in a room with two of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes. I guarantee that if there is anything in that closet we can kick it’s a-“ He stutters at the death glare Steve gives him. “-ppendages.”
Steve wraps him in a towel and pulls him against him. “How about we get her stable on the ground before we launch her into the air.”
“Yay.” She lays them on her bed and rushes in the direction of her closet. She stops short and freezes.
When she turns back down the hall Steve stands and turns to see Tony giving him a sly smile. “What?”
“Don’t know. So far the only files that have been decrypted are run of the mill neurological studies.”
Fury arches an eyebrow. “Seriously?” He pulls out his wallet and puts two bills in. Tony sets the jar back on the counter. “You gonna bring your kid out here to sell me cookies next?”
Clint puts down his fork and signs, ‘This count as new fucking vocab?’ He throws up his hands when he hears ka-ching and Sam chokes on his bacon as he breaks into laughter.
“You’re still here, aren’t you Peterdottir. Come out, come out where ever you are.” It punctuates its sentence by throwing the dresser across the room.
Steve nods and presses his lips to Tony’s cheek. “I’m glad to hear that. I’ve got plans to keep you around for a long time yet.”
“HA HA! It is I! The coolest most amazing hero in the-HEY!” Clint shouts as Tony drags him back by his quiver.
“Well not all of it. I make extra since we usually have other people swinging through but yeah.” At Bucky’s stunned face he says, “Come on, you know the drill. It comes with the metabolism. Don’t you eat a ton?” Steve turns back to the stove and stirs at a pot of porridge.
Tony slides the utensil under her grasping hand. “We should get her into theatre. I think she’d do well.”
“I’d be honored.” She takes a cookie and breaks it in half. She holds one half out to Mari. “I won’t tell if you won’t.”
“But I can’t remember what happened. I can barely remember that it happened at all. Just a handful of memories. And she obviously doesn’t want it back,” says Bucky.
“I’m not making this about you! This is about us!” Steve realizes he’s yelling by the end but he can’t find it in him to care.
Steve leans down and lowers his voice to a gentle timbre. “Hey. It’s okay. I can understand why you’re nervous but you don’t have to be. Tony and I just want you to meet everyone because you’ll be seeing them a lot around here.”
He smirks and closes his eyes, giving her a little wave. “I feel your pain I really do.” He yawns and chuckles as he hears her mournful groan disappear down the hall.
Bucky waits. And waits. When the pile starts to rise above the rim he tries to swipe at the box. “Hey! Leave me some!”
He sighs and mumbles under his breath as he changes the documentary to Princess Dairies. “Kids these days…” he goes back to extracting the brush. Then he moves to putting a natural product into her hair in an attempt to loosen up some of the tangles. It starts to lay flat and Tony pulls away once it is in a manageable state. “Ah-ha! Think I got it!” His smile falls when her bangs poof back up with a pop. Mari looks at him in the mirror expectantly. “…..I hear fluff is in this season...”
She takes another drink before Tony takes her off the counter and sets her down. He rinses the blender cup before setting it in the sink. When he turns around to put the fruit back in the fridge, he nearly trips over her. Instead of moving on to the living room she just stands there, staring at the fridge's reflective surface and tugging at her hair.
Bucky chuckles and stands himself. “You’re probably right.” She turns to leave but he grabs her wrist to stop her. “Wait. Um...thank you.”
Tony leaned back and mulled that over. The file said that they had been given all the appropriate notifications but there were a lot of vital files missing from Mari’s case and this lined up with what she had told him about her time in the system.
“So...why didn’t you say anything? If this was to give me something that HYDRA couldn’t take then why didn’t you say something? Why did you let me forget?” Bucky was trying to keep his voice down and keep calm but he couldn’t fight the anger. He had something. Someone. Someone who he apparently loved and loved him. The one thing that was good while he was still the soldier and she had left it in the dark. He opened his mouth to snap something else but he stopped. Her eyes were squeezed shut and her shoulders were shaking.
“Um,” a portly woman sitting behind the desk opposite them breaks in. “Now that Mr. Stark is here, maybe we can proceed with things?”
The doctor immediately stood and went after her. Tony was slower on the uptake and struggled to get out of his bean bag. By the time he got out the doctor was crouching next to the desk.
Tony leans back when a large arm wraps around his chest and pulls him backwards. He’s about to protest when Steve speaks into the phone. “Have Nat and Pepper take over Jarvis. Tony is going to be off for at least today and tomorrow.”
Bucky turns to watch Tony storm out onto the balcony with Steve close on his heels. They start arguing again before the glass door completely shuts. When the glass closes their loud voices turn to soft murmurs. Bucky sighs and runs a hand through his hair. Just as he contemplates slipping out before they notice he hears a small shuffle to his left. He turns to find a little girl glaring daggers at him with a teddy bear in her arms. Great. Someone else who has a reason to hate him. He waits for her to say something but she just glares at him.
Mari stops squealing and Tony looks back at the therapist to see him frowning. He lowers himself back down and folds his hands. “Continue.”
“You’re not going to win your case. You’ve lost every motion you’ve filed, social services ignores all your complaints, and no matter what happens it doesn’t change the fact that you still can’t afford to give her the help she needs. And if I wanted to I could have a whole team of lawyers bury you in paperwork. But she was taken from your care because you couldn’t afford her, not that you didn’t love her. You wouldn’t fight this hard to get her back if you didn’t care which confuses me because the reason she was put up for adoption was because you had no contact with her for over sixth months.”
“You didn’t hurt me.” Steve helps him sit up and lays him against the headboard. He takes Tony’s hand and holds it over his own heartbeat, taking deep slow breaths. “Just follow me. Breathe. You’re home, you’re safe. It’s just us. You’re safe.”
She sits back up and looks at the sky and the tall buildings. Then she pouts and starts looking over Steve and herself. He shifts his hand and her shoe comes into view. She lets out a shout and points to her foot. “It’s the little glittery stars on my shoes!”
Steve leans over and whispers, “Yeaaah. Bucky used to get like that too after a few shots of moonshine.” He turns back to Mari. “Well, did you and the absolute mess want a snack?”
Which is why Tony Stark, billionaire, ex-playboy, philanthropist, comes out of the elevator and onto one of the corporate floors of the tower, with Mari balanced on his hip, a Polly Pocket in his breast pocket, and a butterfly clip in his hair. He marches into the Pepper’s office with her secretary trailing behind him.
“No but Mari is my daughter. Not ‘I think of her as my daughter’, not ‘she feels like a daughter to me’. She is my daughter and I’m not going to give her up but she misses you two and Mari can only benefit from having more people in her life that love her. So, let me and Steve show you how much WE love her. We’ll bring her to visit or you can come to the tower, we want you to be part of her life.”
That seemed to jolt Steve out of his trance because he snaps his mouth shut and turns to Tony. “Were you aware that the team is betting on when our daughter will hit various developmental stages?”
Tony shoots her a glare and leads Mari over to the sitting area Pepper has off to the side of her office. He sets the bag on the coffee table and pulls out Mari’s coloring book & No Mess Markers. She sits down on the carpet in front of it.
“If we didn’t trust you, we wouldn’t have invited you. Besides, even if you did Hulk out, there is a whole floor of heroes up there, including Thor, which you would have to get through first. I’m not asking you to go up there and bounce her on your knee like Santa. Just say hi. Eat some cake. Have some punch. Make sure Clint doesn’t do anything else that’s stupid tonight.”
“Ok over here you have your dresser and vanity WHICH,” he pulls a remote out from the drawer in the nightstand and hits a button. “Doubles as your TV.” He turns it off then returns the remote to its drawer. “You’ve got a desk over there, here’s your toy chest and book shelf. We can put your dialysis machine over here.”
She scrunches up her nose at the pills and turns her face back into Tony’s shoulder. “I wanna go back to bed.”
Tony takes the mug back. “Just one more hit.” He inhales half the concoction in one long pull. “Ugh.” He hands the mug back as a shiver runs down his spine.
The Count opens his mouth only to be interrupted by the tech sitting next to him. “Boys, your both pretty. Can I have just one moment of quiet? You’ve been at this for two hours and I need to focus. Believe it or not, I’m not tapping at this thing in an attempt create a sick beat.”
“Mn?” Mari murmurs as she leans her head out from her cocoon. She looks towards the wall where she heard her father’s voice and wipes at the sleep congealed in the corners of her eyes. “Da?”
Bucky nods and heads after Sam. As they near the door he whispers to Sam, “Why is a social worker visiting?”
Tony frowns and steps into the shower. “You know, you’re starting to be a metaphorical as well as physical pain in my ass.”
Bucky only arches a brow at him before turning back to the man running the stand. “I’ll take two chili dogs with onions and extra cheese and two classics with everything on it.”
“How many times have I told you not to run off!?! Now stop bothering this man and get going. We’re late for your doctor’s appointment.”
“There are too many bread crumbs that lead to this district and we have nowhere else to look. I’m not leaving until I find something.”’
“Get it out of here! Now!” The Captain orders. He brings up the shield just in time to deflect a bullet.
“There has been a shot fired into the south side window,” says Jarvis over the speakers. “I enacted security measures and calculated the trajectory of the projectile.”
The man looks out from under his cadet cap and scans his eyes up and down her. He then gives a grunt and points towards the ocean.
“It’s okay. It’s just a flesh wound,” he says, not missing the deep frown on Tony’s face. “But look at you! Did Tony give you a makeover?”
“Distract me.” He lifts his head and reveals the panic in his face. Steve tightens his arm around his husband as Tony’s breathing becomes faster and shorter. He feels the man begin to tremble. “I need you to distract me.”
“We’ve got hostiles coming out from the surrounding forest. Two of the prison transports got out but they downed the one with Strucker. Agents are trying to get it in the air again. Hawkeye and I have it covered but we could use some back up,” Wasp says.
“You and Steve can keep your hot smolder to yourselves. I’m just waiting for the freak out. They’re usually very entertaining.”
A few minutes later the now severely beaten man is limping along a dock with Natasha following behind him. He stops in front of a concrete dock.
Tony tosses the magazine back on the table and looks around the waiting room. The walls were a beige paint that was chipping where the chairs had knocked against them over time. In the corner were a box of toys that were so dirty he would rather take out his arc reactor for Mari to play with than risk exposing her to whatever was layered on those toys. He glances over at the receptionist who has ear buds in and continues to file her nails. She catches his eye and winks. He looks back up to the clock and sighs, running his thumb over his vibranium wedding ring. Twenty seven more minutes. Twenty seven more minutes before he could get Mari and leave.
Mae pours him a glass. “Before we continue…Mari…how-how is she?” She hands him the glass with a shaking hand and Tony takes it with a nod of thanks.
While Steve looks at her head, Tony stands there, shifting from foot to foot. He reaches his hand out twice but each time it drops when he thinks better of it. He coughs once. “So, uh, what’s the prognosis Cap? Should I start building bionic parts for her or what?”
If anyone reading this knows Icelandic feel free to correct me. I unfortunately don't have any Icelandic connections nor the time or talent to learn the language so I resorted to google translate. May the language gods have mercy on my soul...
“Why would he want those? He would have already had access to them if he made himself a login profile.” Steve asks.
When the next mission came up, Bucky expected to be asked to tag along. But Steve took him aside to have a heart to heart about his role. He was relieved that Steve offered him the choice to stay behind. He had been at war for too long and civilian life was really suiting him. Although he didn’t expect that to mean he was the new nanny. Anytime the Avengers were called out on a mission Bucky would keep an eye on the squirt. And when they realized that Bucky was recognized less often, he took Mari to the park more. She was less likely to be hounded by paparazzi and fans if Steve and Tony weren’t there. Bucky could tell that bothered them. A lot. So when he took her out he made sure to send them short videos and pictures with the phone they gave him.
“Yes. From what we can figure he was making a stimulant that could cause nightmares or dreams with varying intensity depending on the frequency it was exposed to.”
Before entering the hall Mari glances back over her shoulder. Something serious was happening. That much she can tell. Something about a weird dream machine? But no one is telling her anything. Again. She turns to return to her room but movement catches her eye. She looks to the window on the wall adjacent the elevator. There’s something shiny and small crawling along the surface. She looks back at the table again but all the adults are focused on the projections. She tiptoes closer to the window trying to move as slowly and quietly as possible. As she got closer she could make out the shape of a small bug on the high set window. When it moves around its shiny exoskeleton catches the light and glints. It’s no longer than an inch. Coming out of its small head is a wicked looking needle, making it resemble a scary looking mosquito. Images of it biting her or laying thousands of eggs in her ears while she sleeps flash in her mind. A shiver races across her skin and she looks around for something to swat it with. When she doesn’t see anything she whispers her plan of attack to Bucky Bear. Then, with slow precise steps, brandishing Bucky Bear, she approaches the mosquito. It buzzes close to the glass, landing a little higher up. As she gets under the window, her grip on her bear tightens. Then, before it can move, she jumps and swings Bucky Bear as hard as she can at it.
A warm wetness spreads across her palm as she shakes her father’s shoulder. She pulls her hand back and tries to make out the stickiness on her hand. She goes to the lamp on the bedside table and pulls the chain. Her eyes widen when she sees the substance on her hand is red. She jerks her head up to her father’s sleeping form and sees red soaking into the sheets and splattered on the wall and across her parents’ bodies. Tremors quake through her body as her mouth struggles to form words.
“Thank you for sharing Mr. Stark.” He turns to Mari and holds out the toy for her. “After hearing that, why don’t you share what you told me earlier?”
“I’m letting you keep him. He’s yours now luv.” Peggy reaches a shaking hand out to push the bear closer to Mari’s chest.
Steve smirks before turning back to the tech who is watching him wearily. He thumps his hand on the machine. “Well go on. Tip tap. Hit a button or something.”
“So it really did happen. I wasn’t just confusing things. And your name is actually Natalia isn’t it?” Bucky starts to lean forward. Finally, he can start putting some of the pieces together.
Tony pecks a kiss to her head when she nods in understanding. “I love you Kiddo. Ok Pep!” He stands and props his hands on his hips. “Ready to be bored out of my mind.”
“Not now Jarvis,” Tony snaps as he bunches up Steve’s shirt to run his hands over the sensitive sides.
After a minute she slowly crawls out and Steve lifts her up onto the bed. He pulls the covers up and tucks them in around her.
“It was a production okay," says Clint. "We had to give it a name. A lot of people lost a lot of money on you two.”
Steve shakes off Tony and throws his hands up. “I’m done with both of you.” He storms over to the couch. He picks Mari up and sets her on his lap to listen to the rest of Thor’s story.
“We have a child with a compromised immune system, I don’t know what is so hard to understand about that. I mean Clint shows up with a cold and a couple days later she’s at the doctor’s in the same spot.”
Mari sighs and takes it. “Cranberry cube. They’re low in phosphorus and promote a healthy immune system and dietary track.”
Tony groans and runs his hands over his face and through his hair. “Fine. But we contact them on my terms.”
“Of course I can get through it. The Count only hires the best and the best I am. He wants a way to get at Stark, I’ll get him a way. No doubt about that.”
“Yeah well, War Machine is more qualified and whoever thinks raising a kid isn’t a full time job has obviously never had one.”
“He’s just doing his job. Now,” Steve turns to Mari and Ms. Flander. “If you’ll follow me this way ladies.”
Mari curls up in a ball and mumbles behind her knees, “I’m not supposed to do what strangers tell me to.”
Bucky reaches them just as Mari grabs a sand pail and whacks it into his face. The boy screams and drops the toy before running away, yelling for his mommy. His two compratiates following after. Bucky picks her off the ground as she scoops up the toy.
“There was a security breech to steal some confidential files and the tower’s systems were compromised.  During the intruder’s escape he set off an explosion in the stairwell. No casualties, three injured. The intruder has yet to be identified but all systems should be back on line within the hour and the tower is secured.”
Tony turns and gives his husband an annoyed frown. Ignoring this, Mari gasps and turns to her social worker.
After clean up and prep the new family eventually make it out to the car. The following debate of where to shop was solved with a coin toss. Tony won which meant flashy and overly expensive. They arrive at a posh child’s boutique. Steve and Tony at first try to have Mari pick out her outfits but they give it up as a lost cause when she becomes distracted by the multicolored size tags that have fallen off some of the hangers and starts disappearing into the center of the circular racks to collect them. They agree that she may be better suited to a consultant position.
“I’m not going to lie Pip. I freaked out, nearly throttled an agent when we got here because he wasn’t giving me the information I needed fast enough. Today was scary, for all of us, but it’s not going to happen again. Because we won’t let it.”
Steve’s stomach drops but he simply falls into Captain mode. The Captain does not lose his head, remains focused and calm no matter the situation. “Why? Is it on our end?”
“Hey! That is the talk of a quitter! Are Earth’s Mightiest Heroes quitters, soldier?” Tony asks as he loads the ingredients onto the counter.
Mari gasps. “You really are Thor!” She hunkers into couch mumbling, “ohmygoshohmygoshohmygosh.” She gets off the couch and runs to stand in front of him. “Skilurðu mig núna?” (Do you understand me right now?)
