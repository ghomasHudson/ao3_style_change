"You're alright, kiddo," Tony hummed softly, "Papa's gonna go get you a band-aid and stuff."
"Sorry. I've never really been in a house this size before. Not around where I lived, anyway. It’s exciting to take all of it in." He explained. "I probably sound like a huge dork, just getting excited by a spare room..."
Tony laughed and accepted the spoonful, licking Steve's hand before pulling back, licking his lips. "Thank you," he murmured.
"Only trouble you really cause is running that pretty mouth of yours." Steve smirked, running the belt lightly up Tony's bare backside slowly. "Need to stay quieter sometimes."
"Bed. Yeah. I need sleep, after today," Tony yawned, closing the closet doors once they were done, "We can invite the others over tomorrow for Christmas things, if you want."
Slowly, Tony tugged Steve's shirt up, pulling back to toss it aside, running his hands up his chest. "You're so gorgeous, holy fuck," Tony breathed, taking a nipple into his mouth and gently biting on it, sucking it sensitive before moving onto the next one.
Well, I felt you had a bit of a problem and I figured I'd help out." Steve grinned to him, petting at his hair. “What were you dreaming about?”
He crouched down so he could properly kiss Steve, booping their noses together.
"Tony, what's the matter? If the idea of going on a date bothers you that much, you can say so. It was only a suggestion." He soothed gently.
He whistled, shoving his hands in his pockets.
Tony turned his face away from Steve. Steve's face turned to one of worry.
"Oh yes he does," Tony rolled his eyes, "Believe me when I say he does."
"It showed up when I was about sixteen. It’s the words your soulmate will say to you when you first meet." He explained. "Daddy's is close by his neck."
Steve scooped the boy up in his arms, pulling him into his lap, rubbing at Peter's back soothingly.
After Peter was bathed and put into his pajamas, Steve had him scooped, carrying him toward he and Tony's bedroom.
"You got a booboo, honey?"
Tony flushed slightly and
'Yeah, I like that one a lot, actually. Let's do that.' Steve hummed with a small smile, Tatianna nodding in understanding as she prepped to work.
"Right," he eventually replied, staring blankly as Peter filled another page with a Christmas tree and presents, "Happy."
Steve grabbed onto Tony's other hand, stopping him.
Steve cooed gently as Tony sucked at his neck. "I know what you should dress up as on Halloween when it comes around.”
Tony gently lifted Sammy from his carrier and took him over to the nursery, making kissy noises at him. He set the baby on the diaper station and grabbed a new diaper and an onesie, smiling at the grey elephants that dotted the material.
"Mhm. Okay, but make sure you get it done," Tony replied, "Monday morning specials aren't exactly the best for algebra.
Tony nodded, reaching down to get a blanket once he felt the shivers start to come over him.
"Diagnosis, Rogers?" He asked.
With a soft laugh, Tony curled up with Miles the shark, easily drifting off to sleep.
"Hey Steve, wanna come and hang out with Bruce and I tonight? We're having a video game marathon later.".
Steve moved to straddle Tony's back, hands grabbing on by the man's shoulders and rubbing into them gently. "Wanna massage you up first. Get rid of that stress."
"You guys ready to meet Sammy?"
"No doodling," Peter confirmed, licking chocolate off his fingers, "I wuz weally good, pwomise!"
Peter sniffled and nodded, still a little upset.
"Mr. Stark? You all right?" The blond asked, offering a hand to help Tony up.
"Yoga. Meditating. Something to try and ignore the noise." He said softly. "I may work in that sort of business, but it’s weird to hear friends getting down and dirty."
"We'll have to bundle them up, but I'm game," He chuckled, patting away Sammy's wandering hands, "We can pack a picnic, if you'd like."
"Steve, I'm sorry. I just hit something big and wanted to work on it, and I completely forgot about it.".
"Y'make me feel soooo good--" he purred happily.
we got hitched, but y'know. It's been a looong time since we've done
He had lost this Tony the same. The Infinity Stones' power still too overwhelming to the other's body when he snapped; When he saved their universe.
"I don't think he could pronounce it, I'll be Dada till he can," Tony huffed, going over to Sammy to pick the baby up, "Isn't that right, squeakers?"
"He's relaxed now, just be quiet." He whispered, petting at Sammy's fine curls.
"S-s'been awhile," Tony moaned, rolling his hips down to meet Steve's thrusts, "Been too long--"
"What do you expect? I never had to pick anyone up with any before." Steve kissed back happily, cupping Tony's face and licking softly against his bottom lip, asking for entrance. "Mhmm."
"Thank you!" Peter said thankfully, tugging at Tony's shirt. "Daddy! What's da surprise???"
"In here, Tony!" Steve called back with a chuckle, glazing up the ham to put in the oven. He headed over and kissed Tony and Peter in greeting, and giving Bucky a quick pat on the arm.
He rocked his hips lightly, picking at the button of Steve's jeans.
"We can bring them over later when they are done. You don't have to drive back out here, Tony." Natasha insisted, coming up to gently pet Peter's head. "You get to feeling good soon, little spider." She whispered, kissing the boy's cheek.
"I love you," he whispered.
“Shut up," Tony grumbled, retrieving the pants.
Tony sat down on the floor in the spot Steve cleared. Steve shortly followed suit, sketchpad in hand.
'They seemed nice and helpful. Definitely comfortable with who they are.' Steve said carefully, looking up at Tony with a weary smirk. 'Getting made over though is surprisingly exhausting, though. I dunno if that's normal or if its just because I'm...'
"How do you want me, love?" Steve asked with a gentle purred. "You want my mouth? Want me to work you with my tongue and lips?"
"He's six," Tony grinned, "A
Peter unbuckled himself and buckled his penguin in his place, hopping out of the car to grab Steve's hand. Steve read the message and put his phone back in his pocket before taking Peter's hand as they walked inside.
He put the paddle back and grabbed the crop, smacking it against the back of Steve's thighs without warning.
"Then just let go, baby. I'll help you get there." Steve panted in his movements, reaching to take Tony in his hand and pumping in tome with his thrusts.
Psych talk and a child's innocence.
"Pete? Time to get up, sweetie," he murmured.
He exchanged the bottle for the teething ring, smiling fondly at Sammy. Sammy suckled on his bottle contently, looking beside him and reaching out to Peter as he and Steve walked into the kitchen.
"Mhm, that's the word," Tony's voice came from the hallway, causing Sammy to squeal. Tony poked his head into the room with a grin, waving a teether ring at the baby before giving it to him.
"Again, I want to apologize for the wall. He really had the best intentions for Clint." He explained. "Thank you for watching them, though. We appreciate it."
Steve looked back at his husband, a nervousness running through him seeing Tony's expression.
Steve gasped in faux-offense, pouting slightly.
"We'll figure it out, hon. We'll just explain it to him and ask him what he thinks." Steve said softly as they cooked up the soup. "We'll ask him more about what's been happening, then we'll ask his decision."
It wasn't long before the front door opened, a familiar squeal followed by a deep laugh.
He sat back down on their bed and curled up, pulling a blanket over himself.
"Sir?" He asked quietly.
"Ba?" Sammy asked, looking up at Steve, "Ba ba ba ba ba--"
"The kid broke his glasses," he finished weakly.
The blond gently brushed the device with his fingers, raising an eyebrow at the other before following through.
when he could barely crawl a few days ago."
"Well, that would definitely cause some deep seated problems." Rhodey hummed, writing on his notes. "I know you probably won't like talking about it, but I need to know when this all began." He said carefully.
When Bucky picked up the phone, he sighed at the dreamy voice at the other end of the line.
"You can sleep, baby. Your tummy's all full and you need your afternoon nap," He murmured.
Sammy giggled happily and grabbed his teether from the blanket while Peter leaned over and grabbed one of his books, opening it on the floor in front of him.
He cried out and groaned softly, trying to stay upright with stars dancing in his eyes. Steve followed right along with Tony, feeling him clench harshly around him and coming with a loud moan. He laid against Tony's back as he fell, leaving open mouth kisses along it. Tony panted heavily, already feeling the arousal building in his gut again.
"That'd be great, keeping him from getting hotter just a little. Good idea." Steve nodded, smooching him back. "We can give him Bucky's ponytail. It might just help a little."
Oh my god," Tony wheezed, running over to pick up the box, "They're--oh my god, Stevie, they're edible underwear--" He grinned, dissolving into giggles.
Tony looked back at him, shocked.
"Anthony Stark!" Steve said in faux appall. "I can see that the swats will not be enough. I'll have to up your punishment."
Steve huffed a slight laugh at that. "Well, that's because he doesn't feel like matching. And he hadn't really decided to go out anywhere much before we met. So he's a little out of practice."
"Don't get salmonella," Tony laughed, kissing Steve back nonetheless, "You've got a pile of french toast with your name on it, and coffee's in the pot. Pipsqueak and I'll clean up in here, then get ourselves ready, right champ?"
His eyes began to fall, tiredness creeping up in his body. When his eyes finally shut, he was in that familiar dreamscape once more, hands still barely holding to that chair as the humanoid figure was the closest it had ever been in their encounters. Before Steve could attempt to say anything towards the figure, a voice came from the form. The voice spoke in a husked baritone, warm and soft. Steve stilled at the familiarity of the voice, the form speaking to him in a voice he had not heard in so long. It tugged at his heart, hearing the words spoken so calm, so reassuring.
, Tony.
Steve happened to know exactly what questions he wanted to ask, so he spared no time in between.
Tony rolled his eyes, fondly kissing Steve's brow.
Steve looked at him apprehensively.
Peter thought for a moment, then nodded.
"But we are not calling them today. I have dinner on and your son is exhausted. After we eat and he is back in bed, we can do a little something. Deal?"
He drew the boy up into his arms, dancing him around the room until a familiar female voice drifted in from the hallway; Peter scrambled out of Tony's arms, squealing as he latched himself onto Pepper's pantsuit.
"So, there are still waffles in the kitchen for you, guests are gone which leaves the couch completely open for movies and cuddles," Steve explained, nuzzling Tony's neck sweetly.
"Maybe I love a lot of things, but a lot of those things involve you, so--" He shrugged with a dopey grin, smooching Tony's lips.
"Shhh..." Steve quieted him softly, slicking up his fingers and pressing two in to stretch him a bit. "Ask, and ye shall receive."
"Ah--" he cleared his throat, already feeling the hairs rise on his arm, "--If I told you, you'd probably use it to your advantage, and I
He took to setting up Pete's new bookshelf, smiling fondly as he stacked books on it.
"Schmidt. I know that name." Tony strode forward, hand outstretched. "Tony Stark, CEO of Stark Industries," he introduced, "A pleasure."
"Peter... C'mere. I want you to listen." Steve insisted, taking Peter in his arms.
"E's diamonds?" Peter asked, looking confused up at his Daddy.
"Why don't you go down there with Daddy and I'll meet you guys? I'm going to clean up then I'll grab your things for your algebra, okay?" He offered, smooching the top of Peter's head.
"Thank you, Sir," he murmured.
"I'll take that as a yes?" Steve chuckled into Tony's ear. It was filled with such joy and warmed Tony from the inside out. Tony just hugged him tighter and whispered back with a large smile on his face.
The blond rolled his eyes fondly. "I can't do that to other people's children. But a good explanation works just as well. They are usually pretty good after that."
Shameless self-promotion over lol.
Tony stepped into the room from the shadow of the doorway, leaning against the wall.
"I didn't know Clint sews. Even better if they're homemade." Steve mused happily. "And I'll work on that. We need to get it done as fast as we can without shirking the craftsmanship. Take Your Child to Work Day only lasts so long."
Steve leaned in and kissed Tony's cheek comfortingly. "It'll go fine, Tony. Especially if Pepper says he knows his stuff." He hummed, stepping out of the car and opening the door on Tony's side. Steve offered a hand for Tony to take, offering a gentle look.
He turned his head to kiss Steve's cheek, putting his hands over Steve's hands.
Steve's eyes fluttered shut as Tony kissed along his skin. He hummed contently with the presses of lips, feeling loved and cherished. He mewled slightly as Tony moved further down along his body, trying to keep as still as he can.
"I know, bubba. I know." He answered, heart hurting a little at how pitiful Peter looked. Steve petted the boy's hair softly, kissing his forehead. "I'll get you some saltines in a minute so you can have something in your stomach, okay? And they should help your tummy a little, too."
"Yeah," Tony replied, still dazed slightly, "It'd be convenient to move the diaper station too, or at least put it closer to us, so we don't wake Pete up by opening doors in the middle of the night."
"Yeah, love?" Tony called. He gave Steve a quick kiss before the door opened, smiling fondly at his little boy. "What's up, pipsqueak? Blow something up?"
"Mama--" he whispered, voice cracking till he finally cried into Steve's shoulder.
Peter pouted up at Tony, but snuggled into him anyway, eventually crawling in under the hoodie, poking his head out with Tony's.
"It's no harm, Tony, he's only six," Bruce reminded him gently, "But he
"We gonna go to d'gift shop?" He asked, tugging on Steve's hand.
Steve just moaned loudly, feeling Tony hit his spot over and over. He lasted a few more thrusts before he came with a cry, face buried into Tony's chest. Tony grinned into Steve's chest, only thrusting a few more times before feeling Steve clench, thrusting up to the hilt before coming, moaning loudly into Steve's neck. Steve panted against Tony's chest, leaning against his body and leaving open mouthed kisses on his skin.
Peter grinned excitedly at the idea, nodding furiously.
"Hi," Tony mumbled, barely able to speak, "M'gon pass out."
"Tony Stark, and this is my husband, Steve Rogers."
Before Tony could speak his stomach growled, causing him to laugh in embarrassment. "Yeah, food," he mumbled, sitting up and making grabby hands for the tray.
"All right. Since you seem to think you're getting something in it." He teased with a grinned, taking the stocking and heading off towards his art studio.
Steve huffed softly, playing with Tony's hair. "If that’s true, then you aren't allowed to sniffle and pout at me about it."
Tony grinned, leaning up to press a kiss to Steve's cheek.
TW: None
"Now," Rhodes continued "now we work on helping you see and accept that you can overcome this terrible event of your past. That yeah, back then, that situation had left you broken. But that doesn't mean you can't mend and be stronger from mending."
"We wanted him to be used to us before we invited others over." Steve said, a little guiltily.
"No, I yelled at them for talking about it and not including you," Tony replied seriously, reaching up to card his fingers through Peter's hair, "Uncle Clint's a big jerk sometimes."
"Yeah. Yeah, that was better." He hummed sweetly. "Not as harsh and in one small spot. Felt better."
"No... I don't like being able to see myself while we do this." Steve murmured back. "It feels weird. Makes me uncomfortable. Sorry.".
"Steeeve," he murmured, slipping his hand into Steve's underwear.
"I--I--
Peter nodded softly, letting Tony scrub him up. His eyes were still a little puffy, but by now it was mainly from needing sleep. He about nodded off before Tony's voice chimed in at him.
, Daddy," he whined, casting his book aside in favor of wrapping himself around Tony's leg.
"I don't know," Tony replied hoarsely, still slightly rigid, "I haven't-- I haven't had nightmares in
Tony poked his head into the room, face carefully blank as he looked at them.
"You and Sammy are just as important as the other, Peter." Steve explained gently. "He just requires a bit more attention right now until he is able to do things himself. It makes it a little more difficult to have just time with you, but I'm trying bubba. I'd like us to just have us time. I always have ever since we adopted you."
"Then we better get home before that happens!" Steve gasped back playfully, scooping the boy up as they left the store.
"Hold your horses--" Steve said teasingly, pulling his fingers away and going to grab the cock ring. He sauntered back over to Tony, slipping it on carefully and kissing the nape of the brunet's neck softly. "Better?"
"Steve," He started, looking down at his hands for a moment "Do you know why I volunteered to help you?"
Peter sniffled and nodded, latching onto the front of Steve's shirt.
to fall asleep, but last-minute planning always wore him out. He snorted in his sleep, accidentally waking himself up, immediately hearing tiny giggles.
"Homeschool?" Peter bit his lip and nodded.
Tony bit down on Steve's nipple, smirking at the blond's whimper.
Peter ooh-ed, reaching up to gently touch the tattoo.
"I know." Steve responded back just as quiet. "But that's what you told me. Then said I don’t deserve someone like you. But that is far from true, love. I just wanted you to know that."
"Mmm, can't wait." Steve grinned, nuzzling Tony's hand before stepping under the shower spray. "I'll have a surprise on Christmas that even
Steve nodded solemnly. "Yeah. Yeah she does, bubba." He said softly.
Well," Tony drawled, "Only if I flew in
Howard became furious.
"Steve Rogers.".
He gave Steve's hand a squeeze before hopping the bike to hold the door open for him, ushering him into the warmth of the restaurant.
The blond nodded, heading up the stairs and looking around for the boy. He spotted a small mass out of the corner of his eye, pretending not to see the boy and waiting for his moment to strike. Peter scooted farther into the shadows, relief flooding in his chest when he thought Steve hadn't seen him. He started to crawl away, trying to get back to his room.
"Sorry I got sick and ya had to get me." He pouted.
very comfy," Tony replied, reaching up to stroke Steve's hair, "But you can't lay on my completely, silly,"
"Any amount of time is too much time," Tony groaned, parting his lips slightly.
"Probably," Tony whispered back, "Do you wanna put Papa down for a nap so we can do big boy stuff?"
"That doesn't mean you get to tease your father either, Peter." Steve said with a raised brow as they made it to the hospital parking lot.
"Ba ba," he chimed.
"They should be in the dresser. That's where I put them when I do laundry." Steve replied with a hobble into their room to dress as well. "If you've worn them, then lord knows where they could be. You are like Peter and his shoes." He laughed to himself.
"I already know what I'm getting you, pumpkin," Tony grinned, "I've known for a couple months. Just gotta wait for a time to smuggle it in here." Tony hummed lightly, dancing his fingers up Steve's chest. "It'd be fun if you went, though. I'd love to see that crimson blush on your face from seeing all the sex supplies."
"Every single line. Ma thought it was the cutest thing ever. Lord knows if I could even remember it all now.".
"So good, baby. Always so good."
He started with the most recent ones. A "Happy Birthday" text from his mother this morning, most of the rest were college announcements, but then he stopped before the next message name set. Steve Rogers. He stared at his phone for a long time before hesitantly tapping the screen and unleashing the messages. He read through each of them.
"You're always around, how could I?" He smirked up at Tony, rolling his hips when he was ready.
?" Steve gasped. "You're lucky you don't have a concussion or broke something, baby." He cooed, kissing at Tony's head.
"Yessir, anythin' f'you, sir," he moaned, taking a deep breath.
Tony angled his hips downward, gasping as he felt Steve tighten around him when he brushed his sweet spot. Even so, he kept his pace slow, shivering at Steve's nails down his back.
"I did." He replied, loving how Tony blushed. "I heard from Steven's caretaker what you two had been doing at school, and I am very disappointed in you for it."
"Tired. Feeling guilty that Pete knows about my scars, and I'll have to explain them-- but I'm trying not to think about it," Tony mumbled, turning over to curl up to Steve, "I'm just glad he's okay."
"Can I wear m'light up sketchers?" He asked, pointing at them in the closet.
"Oh my god. Don't even
He smiled softly and smooched the blond's temple once he sat, grabbing the shampoo to start massaging it into Steve's hair.
Tony grinned, shaking his hand.
"Can't have him, mama spider, this one's mine," Tony declared, trailing behind her with boxes.
He quickly splayed himself over Steve, nuzzling into his neck.
"I'll go clean the kitchen, then," he hummed.
Before Steve could finish, Tony had gone. He sighed, but complied, carefully slipping on some pajama pants and changing out the sheets on their bed.
were the burning fish. I was just worried."
Sammy's lip wobbled as he looked up at Tony, tiny whimpers escaping from his lips.
"But youse is married to 'im. Why's he worried about a lady?" Peter pouted, not really getting it all.
"So, based upon your dream, what thing are you wanting to try next?" He asked with a small smirk to his lips.
He and Steve had signed the papers not four hours ago, and were on their way home from the agonizing wait of approval that had officially made them Stark-Rogers rather than Stark-and-Rogers.
He sighed happily, pressing his cold nose against Steve's breastbone.
Steve went to grab the paint and brushes they would use, setting it in front of the mural.
"--It could be a soulmate side effect," he continued weakly.
Tony heaved again, tears streaming down his face as he choked on his own bile. He sat back when he thought he was okay, only to retch again. Coughing, Tony closed the lid and flushed it away, raising the lid again just in case.
"Most of it is planned more for this evening, but I figured we could head out to the city for a bit today, do things you want to do." Steve explained with a hum, sitting next to Tony happily. "And I can give you your surprise later tonight--".
Steve ran after Tony with a laugh, easily catching up with him.
Tony blabbed while he took the mail, not even looking at it while he tossed it behind him. Steve's face warmed a bit, thankfully not enough for a blush. But he nodded carefully in reply.
, He thought, not thinking there was someone listening.
"Ba ba ba ba ba ba?" Sammy babbled, patting gently at Peter's hand.
"Dat's why I came ta get yous!" Peter grinned. "Cuz we gotta move my stuffs and den read 'bout Spidahman."
Pepper followed with a little boy still clung around her leg, even as they made it to the living room. "Hello, everyone. Merry Christmas."
He gave Steve a huge smirk, daring him to comment on it.
"I don't think I can move," Tony muttered miserably, hanging his head, "...I love you too."
Tony shooed Steve in under the blankets, tucking him in under the mound of fleece.
"It wasn't a bad move. Besides, I think it would be hard to forget you. Especially with a confession like that. You ramble and its adorable, honestly." He laughed.
"Oh. Missed that."
He grinned, happily taking his piece and digging in.
"It helps with his teething though," He did point out, "Since that one back tooth still isn't all the way in yet."
"Oh yeah, so strong. Definitely. I can lift a whole child by myself," Tony drawled, rolling his eyes, "You and I both know you're the insanely strong one here."
Tony moved closer to look towards below the arrangement of the pieces. There were two pieces of paper printed with text taped to the wall beneath them.
Steve smirked back, kissing Tony's cheek in return.
," Natasha murmured, rubbing the small of Bucky's back.
The soldier wasn't sure what exactly to make of this. Tony was never one for leaving letters. He usually just had JARVIS inform him if the man wanted to meet him for anything. Actually, Steve was usually the one asking Tony to meet him places. And why the entertainment room? Nobody ever uses that room. Whatever they could do in there, the team usually just does together in the main room of the residence floors.
He sighed happily, completely relaxed.
"So does that mean you're taking his name?" Bucky asked curiously.
"Good. You offer it to him," Tony whispered back, smooching Steve's cheek.
"We scared the hell out of Peter," Tony muttered, placing gentle kisses over Steve's abs, "We should go get him."
He took the kids to Peter's room and climbed into the hammock, setting Sammy so he could watch Pete doodle on his notepad.
"We need a night where I can do this to you under the stars," Tony hummed, bending down to kiss the moles and scars and marks on Steve's chest, "Just...explore. Taste. Nothing too off the end, but like... As if it was our first time again."
Steve chuckled to himself, just continuing to pet Tony's hair as the other slept. Steve did not speak, but thought. Sent nothing but loving and comforting thoughts to Tony through the bond to aid in a good rest.
"Mmm, y'just sayin' that, Stevie," Bucky laughed, stepping off the stool.
"Steve?"
"Rude," Tony scolded with a laugh, "And we're coming up on our sixth anniversary, too."
"I wasn't angry at you. Just a little annoyed that you essentially told our son I was the lady. A lady in general." Steve hummed, leaning with the touch.
"Hey there." He hummed contently, looking back behind him. "You okay?"
"Oh, do ya now?" Steve hummed up at him, leaning with Tony's touches. "I'm not even allowed a hint? I mean, will I have to pack for warm or cool weather?"
"I still spoil you, little brat," Tony hummed, raising an eyebrow again, "You'll never have to work a day in your life if you don't want to."
"C'mon in," he called.
"These past two days have been weird, and I have seen some weird thiiIIING-- hey!" The genius laughed, feet twitching as Steve played with them. "That tickles!"
"Tough luck squirt, but I can't let--".
Steve made a quick garbled noise as Tony took him in, trying to stay stand straight.
"Just tell them your leg's been asleep for a long time," Tony hummed, "Let them see my handiwork. I'm not ashamed."
"Yeah, yeah," Tony rolled his eyes, taking the baby into his lap, "I think you should go down for a nap too, Mister."
"I'm seven, Papa, not four," Peter huffed, rolling his eyes as he padded to the pantry.
"All right, Mr. Sassy britches." Steve chucked, smooching the boy's cheeks. This earned an offended squawk from Sammy, the babe smacking his leg.
"Still looks funny," Peter mumbled, nuzzling at Steve's neck, "M'
He pulled back once he was a bit calmer, nodding at Steve's proposal.
Steve nodded softly, leaning with the touch before he stood up off the couch. "All right.
"Maybe this'll teach you to be more
Peter rolled his eyes and hopped down from his stool, padding over to Steve to show him the extent of the damage; he was completely covered in flour, his face and hands sprinkled with dough, and what looked like eggshells in his hair.
"We're definitely doing more role play. I've never seen someone flush so fast by just seeing me in glasses," he mused, "And I can adjust the cuffs to be my size. Anything you wanna try? 'Cause I'm a pretty open person."
"Yes, your question," Tony snorted, "You asked me what I was doing, and then I asked you back to clarify. You didn't clarify."
"You may be hungry, but we'll have to teach you how to eat without getting it all over yourself." Steve chuckled, watching the boy try and wipe his face. "Or I stop making messy food, but I don't want to do that."
-- He caught himself in a half-choked sob, clenching his fist.
It completely went over Peter's head, but Tony laughed behind his hand, having to brace himself against the wall.
He grabbed Bucky into a big hug, lifting him off the ground.
"We won't, baby. Never. Promise." Steve assured with another smooch. "Now, since you're all settled in here, you want us to read to you?"
Tony squinted, vision starting to swim again.
"Think you can watch him while Papa and I move some stuff?" Tony asked, ruffling Peter's hair.
, you about gave me a heart attack."
"Ooh, I like the penguins. The baby ones are cute and fluffy." Natasha smiled softly, sitting down on the couch and bouncing Peter on her knee as the boy giggled.
"Whoa, hey, c'mon! I was just trying to find someone! You don't need to do that!" Tony squeaked, backing away slowly and falling back on the ground.
He attacked Peter's feet with his fingers, grinning at the boy's squeal.
"It's not algebra, its middle school math," Tony laughed, coming over to peek at Peter's work, "We're just calling it algebra, Papa."
choked on his lomein, but he caught himself with a clearing of his throat.
When the carriage came to a stop, Steve remained in his seat, allowing for Tony to exit first.
Steve smiled softly as Tony came back in, kissing his husband's cheek when he managed to wiggle back under the covers.
Steve took down every bit that Tony gave him that he could, a strand of saliva from his mouth and a bit of come at the corner of his lips when he pulled away. The blond breathed a bit heavy, licking the mess from his lips as he stared down at Tony.
"We're not, honey, we're both young and chipper," he murmured quietly, rubbing Peter's back, "We're not going anywhere. Promise."
"It’s more than okay, Tony. I've never slept on silk before." He smiled softly, changing into pajama pants. He walked over and led Tony onto the bed with him. "As long as you're happy with it, I'm happy."
"N--no..." He murmured in his sleep, hands tightening against Tony's sides.
Tony looked out the window, a happy purr in his throat. "We should go for a walk. In the sunshine. Ooh-- there's a little bakery I wanted to try, they might have fresh scones this early--" Tony made eyes up at Steve again.
Steve swooped in and gave Tony a peck on the lips happily.
He continued with comforting caresses, sending thoughts of reassurance in waves. Tony shook his head and brought his arm out from under the blanket, carefully unwrapping the bandage.
"You missed it. Peter finished my awesome tattoo and Sammy was blowing kisses like no one's business." Steve said softly.
"Sorry lovie, but this is faster than a bath," Tony murmured, making Peter's hair stick up into a mohawk, "You look silly."
Tony preened under the praise, going up on his tiptoes to properly kiss Steve, full on the lips. He hummed happily, wrapping his arms around the blond's neck.
He heard a voice call to him, but couldn't think of who it belonged to at the moment. It continued to call to him, and arms wrapped around him in a way to try and calm him.
"When you start to get a bit better, you can lay in my lap and I'll play with your hair, alright? We'll watch a movie together," he hummed, "Sound good?"
Tony chuckled, letting the robe slide off his arms and drop to the ground.
"Hold on, let me get this straight. You're only seventeen."
He pulled the plug out and slipped the vibrator in, making sure it was in snug before flicking it on. Steve made a happy, high-pitched hum when the vibrator started, small waves of pleasure thrumming softly up his spine. He laid his face against the blankets on the bed, letting himself enjoy the feeling.
"Let me take it out of the oven so I don't burn the house down first, huh?" He grinned, moving to the kitchen.
," Clint yelled up the stairs, "
He stripped out of his pajamas and pulled on the black pair of frilly panties, slipping his sweats back up his legs. With a shiver, Tony grabbed the leather paddle from the closet and set it on the desk, only deciding at the last moment to slip on his glasses.
"And you are sweet." He answered back with a hum. "Sweet, kind, and caring to me always. I got so lucky. So, so lucky." He said softly, eyes shutting for a moment.
Bucky's eyebrows perked up for the moment at that, looking to Steve for some explanation. The blond subtly gestured towards Natasha, Bucky turning to see her glancing back with a smirk. Bucky looked back at Tony with a quick look of approval before heading over towards the redhead.
Steve looked worried.
Sammy garbled up at Tony, little feet kicking as he was on his back on the changing table. He stuck a hand in his mouth to chew on since his teether was still in the crib.
"Wittle fella?" Peter pursed his lips, "M'noh
"Didn't try to keep it from you." He murmured softly, looking back. "It just didn't ever come up in conversation..."
"Still, I just--mmm..." Steve whispered, hips involuntarily twitching upwards into Tony's hand. "You're insatiable, you know that?" He murmured softly.
He sat down and skimmed through to the origin of Spiderman.
“I am cheeky. I've heard it’s one of my best qualities," Tony laughed, rinsing the soap out of his hair.
of stress. And too much isn't good for you. Not in the same way too much chocolate isn't good for you. The bad way." The blond explained as eloquently as he could. "Can't be totally silly all the time like Uncle Clint, but you can't be too serious, either."
Steve rolled his eyes softly, leaning at Tony's touch. "All right, fine. Although you babysitting is a given as an older sibling, y'know." He chuckled, turning to kiss Tony back sweetly.
"You are awful and neither of you get dessert," Tony scolded, trying not to laugh at Peter's gasp.
"Did I...did I hurt you?" He asked quietly.
"You're okay, sweetie, you're alright," Tony murmured, "Let's put you in your favorite onesie so you're all comfortable for snuggles, okay?"
"I have a baby care book if you want to read it," Tony teased, laughing when the boy nodded, "Really?"
Natasha rolled her eyes softly, turning instead to Peter and giving him a big smooch.
"Hows we gonna gets Daddy's gifties inside, so he don' see 'em?" Pete asked, snuggled up to his penguin.
Knocking on their bedroom door, Tony picked Sammy up from Steve's chest, only slightly protectively holding him.
Red crossed her arms, sharp eyes on Tony. "State your business."
love you." He soothed, rocking the boy slightly.
have an affinity for blood, thanks."
•I really wanted to talk to you about something.
Tony tucked Steve in, nodding as he kissed his forehead.
"Better hustle," Tony grinned, pulling Steve up and off once the bike was off, "C'mon. Go. Now."
Clint let loose a small grin as he shook hands.
“We meaning you, Stark, and Dr. Banner?” Sam chimed in, earning a look from the group from his tone.
"Me too. Very much." Steve gasped, a smile twitching at his lips. "Alone time. No one would hear us if we're loud." he mewled as Tony pulled away.
He grinned and bounded off to the bathroom, quickly scrubbing himself down after putting the lingerie in the laundry hamper.
"Yessir."
"Papa, what’s d'inta'active museum?"
He gave Steve a pointed look before getting up to pour a second cup for himself, scooting up onto the counter. Steve rolled his eyes playfully as worked on dinner, humming a tune as he worked.
He smiled softly, curling up to Steve's chest.
Tony pulled back almost immediately, worry clouding his face.
"All right. And I'll make sure you see the pictures, okay?" Steve said fondly, walking over to grab the book.
"Oh my god, we're going to get to have a baby!" He grinned, Hugging Tony to him. "A little tiny person. A tinier person than even Peter to take care of."
"--To make love--"
"I see Peter managed to coax you up for blueberry pancakes, huh?" He said with a light chuckle. "Pull up a chair, I'll get you a plate. Coffee's brewing, too."
Tony sniffled miserably, switching his position so his head was in Steve's lap. He nuzzled at Steve's stomach, ignoring the wet patch his tears were making. Steve shushed him comfortingly, leaning down to kiss his head gently as he did.
He was met with a gorgeous, blond, muscular, -did he mention gorgeous?- man, bright blue eyes that rivaled the color of the ocean itself. The human's eyes naturally gravitated lower, doing a slight double take as hipbones almost made a perfect gradient into scales.
"Y’know, whoever picks soulmates deserves a raise," Tony laughed softly, lacing their hands together, "I'm still in shock over you."
Tony grinned cheekily before putting his goggles on, getting to work on Bucky's arm.
Steve gave a shiver of want at the sight, trailing his hand down Tony's back before slipping his fingers in again.
"I should probably teach you a lesson, about misbehaving at school and trying to keep it from me." Tony sat up, pulling his fingers away from Steve. He stood, feeling his heart thump in his chest; grabbing Steve's arm, he dragged him back to his workroom, sitting in the chair behind the desk.
"I'll do it," Clint grinned, setting forth to making piles of gifts.
"Otay. An' we gotta gets Daddy's gift," Peter hummed, flushing at the kiss.
"I don't want to build weapons like that, Howard! I will not be a murderer like you!"
“Understood. All right, fellas. Let leave and get to work so we don’t assault Cap’s nose with so many weird smells.” Nat addressed, ushering Sam and Clint out of the lab. She looked back at Bucky, raising a brow as he stood in place.
"Yeah! Yeah!" He said excitedly, wrapping his arms around Tony's neck and nuzzling the man's chest. "Papa said he was makin' s'ghetti. Did he make s'ghetti?"
"I hate that you answer like that," Bucky sighed, twirling a pen in his hand, "Especially since you never pick up your goddamned cell phone."
He paused, looking over at Steve.
Tony's breathing became more rapid.
said he wanted t'show me somethin' and I didn't know it'd escalate that far--"
"But you wouldn't eva lets ladies give ya special kissies!" Peter gasped, holding onto Sammy. "You says thats only for Papa."
"Daddy got hit in deh chest," Peter piped up, simultaneously enjoying Steve's bewilderment and Tony's annoyance.
He smiled fondly over at his husband, leaning over to give him a quick kiss.
"Don't eat too fast, Petey. You'll get a brain freeze. Or a tummy ache." Steve warned softly, taking bites of his Cookie Dough ice cream as he sat across from Peter.
." Steve grin, moaning quietly as Tony worked him. "So, so goood." He gasped.
"Nothing's wrong, its just-- you're enjoying yourself, clearly." Tony pointed out, careful hands roaming Steve's chest while his thoughts of what to do ran wild.
The blond nodded, leaning in for a quick kiss before leaning to dig for the lube in the nightstand. Displaying his spoils with a smirk, Steve set out to slick up his fingers.  He dragged his fingers gently along Tony's inner thigh before poking them gently at the man's entrance.
"I still love to tell you in every way possible.
"He's a good kid, he really is," Tony murmured back, reaching up to pet Steve's hair, "We got so lucky, Steve. So damn lucky."
"You ready for this?" He breathed.
"Hmm... I think a break today would be good." He hummed thoughtfully, remembering how Tony had felt before sleep. "In the mood for kissin', cuddlin', and movies. After our guests are gone, of course."
"These are called feet, not fins. They help us stand on land along with these little puppies." Tony explained, warily wiggling his toes again. "They are toes. The feet and toes attach to the legs and knees and that's how we can walk."
"Peter, sweetie, do you need some help with your clothes?" Steve chuckled softly, picking up the boy and resting him on his hip.
"Adopted," Peter muttered, flipping over to bury his face in his pillow, "I wish yous an' Daddy never 'dopted me. At least Sammy's got
"Then I won't stop touching until you tell me too, Steve." the engineer assured, trailing gentle fingers along Steve's abdomen. "I want to make you feel good."
"P'good. Daddy an' Papa 'aven't been yellin' so I can sweep," Peter replied, swinging his feet.
"Fuck," he breathed, kissin at the sheen layer of sweat on Steve's neck.
"Maybe. But we'll love him all the same," Tony chuckled, waiting for Steve to lay Sammy down before going over to envelop himself in Steve's arms.
"And if it doesn't work, we'll find something," he mumbled.
Peggy returned his look with one of worry.
"Of course, and you'll be our lil Spidey," Tony hummed, "Maybe Papa will think up a superhero for Sammy, hm?"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
to letting Howard get to me. Peter knocked on the bathroom door in the middle of it all and told me I wasn't allowed to break Papa's heart."
Tony laughed, putting a hand on Steve's chest.
With the end of May drawing near, along with his birthday and the big unveiling of Steve's project, Tony had been having a pretty good semester end. Steve still needed to decide for his final piece, so he and Tony had been spending time together regularly. So much so that the girl at the café kept looking at them in a judging way. Most of the time Tony dismissed her, occasionally sending her a look that said "Mind your own business, lady.".
"Good to hear." Steve nodded amusedly, glancing inside. "Well, I'm making breakfast, so if you could round up everyone for me, that'd be good."
He winked at Steve and grinned, happy to climb back up onto the blond's chest.
Sammy whined at that, lip wobbling before he curled up to Steve, nearly wailing into his side.
Sammy giggled softly and reached out for Peter, dropping down onto his stomach to attempt and crawl over to him. He whined when he only got partway, squeaking when Peter helped him up.
"Can't sweep dere by mahself." Peter said softly, curling into Tony. "How come you 'n Papa is sad? Is it cuz ub wut I did?"
Steve kissed at Tony's face gently. "You will be good. You just have to have faith in yourself about it, Tony."
"Heavenly Lord, bless us this day and bless this food to our bodies. Be with us tonight as we spend time together as a family, and be with Tony as he works through this with us."
She stood patiently in the entryway as Tony went to retrieve Steve.
"See? You're safe and warm with us, Petey," Tony soothed, rubbing his back, "Even Sammy's worried over you, sweetie. You're okay, shhh."
"I love you, too. And you are always forgiven, gosh Tony." Steve whispered back as he hugged Tony tight. He kissed at Tony's neck until he remembered the state they were in.
"Well that’s just how it was made." Steve explained, petting Peter's hair. "They may look funny, but it helps them see prey from the side. So they could be moving forward, but be looking right at 'ya.".
Still crying, Peter nodded, letting Steve pick him up out of the tub and wrap a towel around him. He hiccuped as he tried to settle, bottom lip quivering as he was put in pajamas.
Tony laughed, crooking his fingers again.
"You're very good f'me. Very good. But relax, 'kay?" Steve whispered, leaving loving kisses from head to toe, just cherishing the man.
Steve chuckled at the boy, walking over towards the markers. "All right, we can color. But if you use markers, we are using the Color Wonders." He pointed out. "You just got a bath and we don't want you messy again."
He held his hands out to Tony and Bucky, smiling as Clint begrudgingly went along with the hand holding.
"You'll find that my approach to punishment isn't as direct. I prefer to tease. Play a game of wills." He purred, running a slicked finger over Tony's entrance.
"You two have fun," Tony hummed, leaning into kiss Steve and Peter's cheeks.
Tony hummed appreciatively, relishing in Steve's cock nudging the back of his throat. He scraped his teeth down his length when he pulled off, slipping his tongue into the slit before grinning up at Steve.
"Oh, baby let me see." Steve said in concern, rushing over to Peter and looking at the slight, bleeding cut on his knee.
Tony kissed the side of Steve's neck, sighing in relief when the movie started to wrap up.
"We're okay, hon! I'll explain when we are out!" Steve called back, turning attention back to Peter. "That's why I was iffy of you seeing that movie. It’s not real baby, you're okay."
Work has just had me super busy, and hasn't left me much time to write. So this chapter is a little longer to make up for it :,D
"I know. I wasn't talking about that yet." He explained, rolling to face Tony. "Was just jumping onto it. Wanted to see how comfy it was--" he hummed, curling up on the bed.
"We are supposed to be at the gallery opening in about an hour, in case you forgot.".
"Tony? Tony, will you come out here, baby? So we can talk and spend time with you? Peggy's gone, so you don't need to hide out, sweetheart."
"Hey, on the way home we have a little surprise that might make you feel a little better, okay?" Steve offered with a small smile, rubbing Peter's back. "We'll grab Sammy and head home, bubba."
"He's my smart lil bub," Tony cooed, smooching Peter's forehead, "Just like his Daddy. Real proud'a him."
"Is Pete down for a nap?"
"You can do it, Samms," He said quietly, holding his arms out.
Tony cooed at Sammy while he changed him, putting him in an onesie covered in sailboats.
"We were beat, man. Sorry," Tony chuckled, not at all surprised that Peter leapt up to go see Bruce, "Did y'all sleep well?"
She chuckled softly, a genuine smile on her lips, "My aunt will be taking care of me, but in the meantime, I'm trying to get as many of my eggs signed off as I can before I'm not legally able to."
"Hey you, shush, no he didn't," Tony said, voice muffled slightly by his pillow, "Behave."
--" He moaned, starting to bounce up and down a bit.
"Thank you, buttercup." the blond laughed, but snuggled into Tony anyway. "Not often I'm the one wrapped up in arms. My big, strong husband…" he smirked contently.
"I've become such a goddamn slut since I met you. It's fantastic."
"Then why are you blushing then? And using your phone as a distraction?" Steve asked curiously, cocking his head as well.
"Steeeeve," he whined, throwing an arm over his eyes.
"Steve," he whimpered pitifully, holding back a choke as he felt him pull out, "Fuck, Steve--" Tony took another breath, shaking slightly as he came down from his high.
"You're being good now, baby," Tony hummed, picking up the ruler from the desk, "I want you to tell me how it feels."
Tony laughed quietly at that, shaking his head fondly.
"Okay Sammy, bubby's going to feed you breakfast today, okay?" He informed the baby before turning to Peter. "Hold him carefully and don't tilt his bottle too much."
"Something like that," Tony mumbled, peeling a fingernail off and tossing it out the window. He ducked his head, stomach rolling even when he felt the car come to a stop in the garage.
"It might do you good to get a nap too after we visit Daddy." Steve chuckled lightly as they headed to the workshop.
"I can't wait. But you are helping me clean it afterwards." He smirked, hugging Tony close.
"...What...?"
"All we have to do is tease Pete about his girlfriend from ballet," Tony replied seriously, grinning.
Steve rode him out as Tony fell from his high, taking him a bit longer before he came as well. He left open kisses along Tony's spine as he fell himself, running gentle hands along Tony's skin soothingly.
suck your dick," Bucky grinned, enjoying Steve's groan, "Yeah, we can take the little ones off your hands. When do you want to hoist them over?"
"And I'd hope he still does." Steve's voice rang in as he entered the lab, looking at his boys before joining them on the couch.
Steve shook his head softly as he started to lead the boy's out.
"Okay, you go hide, and I'll hide, and we'll get him," he whispered back, helping Peter to the floor.
"You heard the prince, he wants his pizza nibbles," Tony laughed, sitting down next to Steve.
He put Peter down, handing him the lighter plates. Peter helped along, enthusiastically setting every bit he knew went on the table.
Tony whined softly and spread his legs more, gasping when Steve thrust into his sweet spot. "God, please Stevie, right there," he moaned, scrabbling at the table for purchase.
"Sorry, Steve," Natasha's voice came through, clearly irritated, "What James
"I expect you to fuck me back if I do." He growled into his husband's ear, nipping his ear lobe before pulling back and heading for the desk.
"M'busy," he said, voice cracking, "Whaddya want?"
"Hey, Tony, baby, what's wrong? Don't cry hon, it’s okay..."
Comments are super appreciated!!!
He smiled, even though it didn't reach his eyes.
"All set for the adventure. Just hope Sammy doesn't cry when we leave." Steve murmured as he got in the car.
"He told me not to be fraternizing with my boyfriend on school premises..." He hummed, looking back at Tony with false shame.
"He might, but not because he's mad. Just because he likes chewing." Steve mumbled, finally opening his eyes. "He'd never be mad at his bubby."
"Rats. Y'all are a bunch of rats," Tony joked, hugging Steve back, "Well, let's get this party started, ladies. First
"I resent that," Tony hummed, throwing a cookie back at Clint's head when he laughed.
no more taking him out of the crib without our permission, okay?".
Steve made a soft noise at that. "You don't have to reward me for that. I'll do it, anyway. You deserve it." He stated with a kiss. "We can just go to go. Have fun, y'know?"
"S-sir--" Tony dissolved into babbles and groans, whining as he rolled his hips back. "I'll be too busy wondering about your panties, Sir," he breathed, putting his head on the desk and taking a deep breath, "God, Steve, you're so fucking
Steve opened the door slowly, slipping inside with a soft look on his face.
"You don't... understand, I have to... see...".
"Good or bad?" Tony hummed, massaging the tiny red line that was on Steve's ass.
"It’s not dumb. I get what you mean..." The blond whispered to himself since Tony had already left. He was right, it made it seem like it was something they had to do. Steve never meant it that way, but is that what it had evolved into? He didn't want that.
"Welcome home, Steve." Tony whispered gently, wrapping an arm around Steve and pulling the man close as he began to lead them both out of the void. "I think you'll like it here. Got quite a few people who've missed you. Peggy and Nat having been itching to see you again. And Erskine? Jeez, that guy has been waiting to talk to you longer than any of us. But I have missed you the most. Not that its a competition or anything, but it
"Uh-huh, but I can't do it," Peter explained seriously, "I t'wied, but I can't hold 'im up t'do it. Daddy told me dat m'only 'sposed t'let you and him do it."
Steve and Peter had said goodbye to Peggy, Steve adding her number and new address to the contact list on their fridge. A sudden twinge of pain pulsed through him from the bond, leaving him automatically worried.
"Once," He decided, "So far, at least. And that's saying the words in those order."
Beg? He had to beg? Well, with Tony, he definitely wasn't beneath begging.
"Not weird," Tony protested softly, laughing into Steve's neck, "I never have a quiet night. I can't stand the quiet." He gentle massaged the dimples in Steve's lower back, pressing open kisses over his neck. "What'd you think? Too much for you?"
Steve let his eyes look Tony over for a moment, looking somehow attracted and slightly bashful all together.
Steve looked to the other man warmly, unable to stop looking at those eyes, wow. They were large, warm, and welcoming.
"Hmph--"
The blond gave a careful look and nodded. "He was building on the beach and I was curious.".
Clint begrudgingly handed Bucky a twenty from his wallet, in which Natasha took it from him and stuffed it in her bra.
"Yeah! Yeah!" Peter wiggled excitedly. "I lub when Santa comes 'n leaves presents! And I've been pretty good this year." He said matter-of-factly.
"I'm all for Chinese," Pepper laughed, arms wrapped around Peter, "We can make Clint go get it."
"Don't let me come, Sir, please, wanna last y'a long time," Tony breathed, taking the opportunity to crawl back from the edge, "P-please, Sir--"
"You don't understand, the guy has some sort of vendetta against me. He has just been looking for a reason to fire me." Steve chimed before he headed into his apartment to change.
"You're such a cheesy romantic," Tony mumbled, laughing into Steve's skin, "Such a cheesy
"No, no, I'll get my phone, it's just on the table-- Coffee would be lovely, I would ask for Irish coffee, but I don't have any whiskey on me."
Steve thought about it, and to be honest a lot of the other art majors fit that description. A few fit it to a T.
"We get to go shopping for baby stuff and we can start painting the nursery when we get home," Tony breathed, almost crying from the happiness bursting from his heart, "Oh my god, Steve, a
"Steve, honey--"
"That's our cue to leave," Bucky said with a laugh, watching Clint sullenly follow Natasha, "Have fun, you guys. Call if you need anything."
"Don't wanna mess up," Tony replied softly once he'd finished and stepped back from the wall.
"Yeah. I mean, I already have the genius, and having the suit? I could shove it in Barton's face," Tony grinned, "And it would be fun to fly around."
Tony grinned lightly.
"I believe it." He chuckled, finishing things up and swooping in to kiss Tony's lips. "Now, let’s get out of here before we're all pruny."
"You've always been a seaman," Tony replied, trying very,
"We're going to hope that doesn't happen for his sake, though." Steve sighed, looking Tony softly. "I'll call the doctor tomorrow and get him checked over just in case. Get him taken care of."
, mister." Tony rolled his eyed again and leaned up on his tiptoes to kiss Steve, gently pushing him back toward the bed.
"Damn, Tony. Such a great mouth. Always feels so good--" Steve praised, petting Tony's hair in encouragement.
"Y'know what? You keep poutin', I'm just gonna keep kissin' you 'til you stop--" Steve sing-songed, kissing at his face softly as they laid in the bed.
Tony took a breath and continued.
"Sometimes it takes a while for the initial shock to completely pass. Once that happens, you'll know. Grief all comes in stages." She explained, petting at his hair and humming softly.
"Well then, that will be something to use on our vacation. Along with my stocking stuffer." Steve grinned softly, leaning in for a quick kiss.
"Dunno whatcha talkin' about," Peter grinned, an idea already swirling in his head, "I'm a good boy, Daddy said so."
“I’d say someone is definitely hungry. Good call, Bruce.” Tony hummed in amusement, standing to go and grab Steve another plate of food and something to drink. Once he had the blond settled with his spoils, he took his own plate and ate at some bacon while he moved to join Bruce in their findings. “So, what do we got going on, Brucie?”
"I never made the bet!" Steve called back, stacking up waffles.
Steve thought, looking between the two of them.
"Gladly." Steve murmured back, thrusting his fingers in and out of Tony. He undid his pants, relieving some of the pressure from hearing all the brunet's noises.
Tony returned to his phone, about to play solitaire when it was plucked from his hands.
A blush ran down Steve's face and neck, all the way down to his chest as he grabbed the gag and crawled slowly over to Tony. He sat down on his knees looking up his husband and handing the gag over.
He helped the boy go and wash his hands, ruffling his hair in praise as they headed off toward the slide.
Peter eagerly climbed up into Tony's lap with Bumblebee, animatedly talking about the toy while he snuggled up to his Daddy, head resting on his shoulder.
"He's being bullied at school, I figured that's what it was--"
With that, he toddled back upstairs to his parents' room, crawling back up on the bed to snuggle his way under Tony's arm.
of that...."
"Adult things," Tony replied honestly, "Nothin' you need to worry about."
He cleared his throat.
Tony quietly reached up to stroke Steve's hair, shutting the laptop and pushing it aside. He drew up his knees, turning to press a kiss into Steve's hair.
"Hush," Tony rolled his eyes, going over to take Peter into his arms, "She calls all her friends 'sweetie', Peter."
"You feel so good, baby. So warm and fantastic,” he whispered against Tony's ear.
Tony cleared space in the room for Steve and the delivery man, grinning at bed frame and mattresses. He paid the man and tipped him, sending him on his way.
The blond chuckled softly, offering his hand like one would a dog before patting the claw. "Well it’s very nice to meet you, Dummy." He grinned, the bot beeping back before turning to Tony again. "You did good building him though. I've never seen a robot with its own personality before."
"I'll give Buck some notes to help you get better."
"Oh yeah, I forgot about that. I guess I just like hearing others admit I'm a genius~".
"Nah, I'll get up. I'll be dragging for a bit though," he yawned, swinging himself out of bed.
Steve knew exactly what he was going to ask first.
Once the food was finished, Steve went upstairs to wake Peter first. He saw the door open and the boy gone, hurrying to their room just to be sure.
He sighed happily, scrubbing the grease and oil out of his hair and skin.
...."
"Well, now you will. And since I have handcuffs, it'll be easy," he grinned, opening his eyes as he propped himself up on his elbows.
One night when Tony had the nightmare, it continued after its usual ending. This time when Steve yanks the ARC reactor out, Tony falls to the ground in the cold snow like a sack of potatoes. He cannot move, only feel himself go into cardiac arrest and look up into the frigid air. The last thing he sees is Steve looming above him, ARC reactor in hand. Steve crushes the device as if it was made of paper and drops it next to Tony in the snow, then turns and walks away with a wicked grin plastered to his face.
"I can't wait for it." Steve grinned happily, petting Tony's hair as it lay. "Just you and me, no schedule. No distractions. It'll be so perfect." He whispered contently.
"Well, I'm actually hungry, and I know you're going to fuck me senseless again, so there's that," Tony purred, a smirk on his lips.
He happily skipped over to sit next to his son, plopping a kiss on the top of his head. Steve hummed thoughtfully as he sat in his place, picking up his fork to eat.
"My paper from Bio 401," Tony mused, flicking through his old notes, "Damn, Pete. This is some advanced bedtime story, baby."
"Nuh uh. Wanna spends time wiff you," Peter mumbled, rubbing his nose into Steve's neck.
He captured Steve's lips, slowly tugging his hips closer to his own.
He felt the shiver go down his back, but Tony ignored it in favor of checking messages on his phone. Tony sighed once the waiter took their order and menus and left, cursing the blush on his face.
"Like that better?" Tony murmured, massaging Steve's cheeks again, "You definitely responded better."
"If you really want to work on it that bad, you can work on it the day after tomorrow." Steve explained, tucking Peter in and kissing his forehead. "Tomorrow, you and I are going out for a father/son day of our own. How'd you like to go to the aquarium?"
Nevertheless, Tony climbed up to the top of the slide and sat down, helping Peter into his lap.
"And kid, next time you wanna draw me Lucky, why don't we actually go to the pound and look at the dogs?" Clint murmured softly, tucking a stray hair behind Peter's ear.
Steve smooched Peter's face happily and sent him on his way, starting up the mixer getting the mix started all up as the iron warmed. Peter skipped up to his room and wiggled out of his onesie and undies, standing nude as he stared at his closet.
“U? What do have there, sweetie?” Tony asked, carefully moving U’s tail out of the way before he stopped and froze for a moment.
"I usually do,” Tony shrugged, making no move to get it off.
"This is quite a bit, Tony. Plus with the room? Kid can't ever say we don't love him." Steve chuckled, wrapping up another shirt. He leaned in with a kiss on the lips, nuzzling Tony's shoulder when he realized his hair was still damp.
Peter skipped over to the bed and stood on his tiptoes, leaning over to kiss Tony's temple.
"Love you too, octopus," Tony chuckled, snuggling up to Steve's chest, "Dunno how you put up with all my shit, but I'm glad for it."
Steve kissed Tony's cheek, just holding him, close and comforting. "As long as you're sure. And you can talk to me about anything whenever, just so you know, okay? Anything bothering you." He assured.
"Right. Right. In the baby classes." He said calmly, eyes in the road. He was quiet for the moment before speaking again.
Peter gasped in shock, causing Tony to bust out laughing, placing kisses on Pete's face.
"Mmh--" Steve moaned against Tony's lips, whining softly as their hips brushed. He gasped softly when their lips parted.
He moaned softly, whimpers escaping from his mouth. Steve worked on opening Tony up quickly before tugging his fingers away to slick himself up.
"In a
Steve purred back, leaning into the touches. "Don't worry. I have something like that picked out for you.   And it’s well hidden--"
"Being stubborn is just in the Rogers' genetics. It's just science." Steve joked quietly. "But they will be a well-mannered child as well. We're good like that." He preened, leaning in for another smooch.
Tony peeked an eye open, sleepily reaching up to pet Steve's hair.
"Yeah. I'll come make us breakfast." Steve hummed, rubbing tiredness from his eyes before scooping Peter up and heading to the kitchen. "I'll make us all some pancakes then you can help me bring some to Daddy, okay?"
"Yeah, come on in," Tony called, checking himself over in the mirror.
Steve nodded back, humming in thought. "If you'd like it, then we can try the power play thing sometime." He said quietly. "And the couch sounds fun. Definitely was quite a way to wake up." He chuckled.
"Not yet, no. First I need details of your relationship with your brother, the scene of the crime, and
Tony finished up dinner before poking his head into the guest room, smiling fondly at the tiny notes left for him from Pepper and Natasha; he tossed their sheets in the laundry room and grabbed the huge stack of papers left for him, swiping the windex and making his way upstairs. He couldn’t hold back his grin at watching Steve sleep, wiping down the desk before starting on his mound of homework.
"So, there was obviously more. Considering you were found out under the bleachers." He pointed out, tapping the belt against his leg.
Tony happily trailed in front of Steve, blinking innocent eyes up at him. "Whatcha wanna do, babe?"
Steve moved around with Tony's adjustments, finding the material actually pretty comfortable around his neck. He fiddled with it a little, messing with the clip.
"Alright, so do I just-- let the blockage drop?" He asked.
"Maybe, but how close were you to the target, Clint?" Steve asked with a raised eyebrow, smirk on his lips. "Because five feet away doesn't count as being an expert marksman."
"Fuck--" Tony laughed breathily, slowly thrusting into Steve. "Ti amo più che la luna, oltre le stelle, tu sei il mio tutto," he muttered under his breathed, getting his hands under Steve's back to help anchor himself.
Steve tried to hold back from it, he really did. But Tony started to work his neck once more, and he couldn't help it. He came in Tony's hand, letting out a quietened whine as he did.
bad at dancing." Steve chuckled, shoving Tony playfully as they walked. "But I'll take you up on dance lessons. That way, if you have a benefit to go to, we can sweep the other dancers with our skills."
He blew a raspberry on the boy's stomach, grinning.
He leaned in to leave gentle kisses all over Tony's face, humming happily as he thought. "Do you think it’s strange that we used what happened to the boys' plush penguin as our murder mystery?" He asked quietly.
dumb, the only spanking going on under this roof is between you and me."
It was a pattern; Change, show, repeat. Steve would step out and show Tony, trying not to flush from the other's eyes on him and smile in reaction. He would ask him how the clothes felt on his skin, if he could move well in them, and even turn arounds for a full look before either OK'ing or denying an outfit. There were far more yeses than no's, so the blond assumed that was a good thing.
"How?" He finally said, clinging to Tony more. "With a video like that being on the internet of all places, how the fuck did he never get arrested for that?" He said through gritted teeth, a tear leaving his eye. "How could they let someone with that big a name off with something like that? To his own fucking
"Oh c'mon, Daddy. We're just having a little fun, is all," Steve teased gently, scooping Peter up and leading them over to Peter's room. "We were planning to play a little anyhow."
"Hmm... Getting some things unpacked will be good." Steve hummed softly. "Not everything, just some things. And then we can go ahead and play," He purred playfully.
good--"
"Did you
"And that's what worries me." Steve said with a chuckle. "I know what happens when you are 'interested' in something. It basically means I'm gonna be your little experiment."
He yawned, settling down for the night.
"Still sensitive..." He pointed out, kissing Tony's chest.
"Hey--"
"Love you, lil bug," he whispered.
Steve gave Tony puppy dog eyes, a soft pout on his lips, "I'm not a meanie... I'm sorry, honey..."
Tony nodded, flitting out the door to start his tasks before Steve could argue. The blond sighed as Tony went on his way, a shiver running up his spine as he curled up under the blankets for warmth. Curled up in a ball and encased in his cocoon of blankets, Steve quickly fell to sleep.
Peter quickly finished his sandwich and reached for a juice box and carrots, happily munching down his lunch.
"It's Steve." The blond said as he appeared. "You have quite a bit there, huh?" Steve gave a careful look.
Peter nodded quickly, doing just that as he ran into the room. He dried off his body and his hair fairly quick, moving to slip on his underwear and try to get his clothes on properly.
"Oh, damn..." Steve groaned, already almost completely hard under Tony's touches. "Well, taking what you want is certainly one thing." He smirked.
the silly one."
Steve looked to Tony, tilting his head a bit.
Tony put on a fake smile for Steve's sake, getting up to put Sammy in his bassinet. Steve could feel the real emotion behind Tony's smile, feeling bad for him. He turned to Peter with a serious look.
He kissed the top of Steve's head, holding him a bit closer than usual.
"--In here is a couple places that past couples have gone to, as well as daycares and babysitting services if the need arises. Personally, I'd go to Miss Lewis for the classes. She's a very solid, strong woman who knows what she's doing."
"Shut up," Tony grumbled, sipping at his drink, "You know I have caffeine in my veins."
"Don't take too long," he called, walking back toward the basement.
Steve pulled out a small black box, opening it to show a slightly worn gold band. "It was my dad's engagement band. He gave it back to my mom saying he'd be back for it and her when he came back from the war."
He gently washed the lather out of Peter's hair, slicking the curls back before grabbing a washcloth.
"Sounds like a plan to me." Steve hummed contently, curling around Tony gently.
"Pete--" Tony poked his head into the room and rolled his eyes. "Put some clothes on, kiddo."
"Yeah?... Ooh, Papa, I like whatcha did wit da livin’ room. Vewy nice."
"Anything else to talk about Doc? Final diagnosis?" He laughed weakly.
"Good night, Steve. Sleep tight." Tony whispered back, kissing the top of Steve's head at the sandy blond curls.
"My question?" Steve asked curiously, humming in thought and trying to ignore how Tony was laying on him. "What question would that be? I don't recall a question."
." Steve moaned when Tony stroked his sweet spot. He raised his hips to get it to happen again.
"Look at you, big boy! Sitting up all by yourself." Steve said happily at the baby. "That’s a big job. Good job, bubba. We'll have to show Daddy sometime when he's awake."
Clint at least had the semblance to look guilty while he pushed his plate away.
"Good morning, Sleeping Beauty." He teased playfully, kissing the tip of Tony's nose.
Peter giggled at that, ducking his head bashfully.
"Mm hm." Steve hummed against his lips.
Tony complied with his instructions, letting his eyes drift shut.
Steve watched with hurt of his own in his expression, sighing almost forlorn.
"You wanna do the honors or me?" He murmured, wrapping his arms around Steve.
"Fuck, I love you guys," he sobbed, turning to kiss Steve back. Tony choked on his tears, eventually mustering up the strength to try and calm himself down so he could eat.
"What're you two grinnin' about?" Steve asked playfully, raising a brow. "That usually means you're up to somethin'."
"Relaxing, taking our time... I haven't mapped your body out in so long, I miss it," Tony murmured, stealing another kiss, "God, I can't wait."
"Hey, you do more than you think and are so good with Peter. You're good
"You don't have to get me anything big, Tony. I'm happy with whatever I get." Steve hummed back. "But yeah, Peter is spoiled. But at least he is always grateful and that’s all I could ask for."
"Be good," Tony had said before he left.
"I got it," Pete promised seriously, helping them unbuckle Sammy once they parked in Bucky's driveway.
"Both. All of the above. Multiple times," Tony breathed, whining when Steve pulled back, "We've been doin' this dance for
"Dadddddy," Pete held out his arms, blinking blearily, "Up."
"Aw, that's very sweet munchkin. Thank you." He grinned, smooching the boy's cheeks.
"I don't wanna break the desk," he giggled, "Hurts m'back."
He took his clothes from his Papa and slipped on his underwear, letting Steve zip his bear onesie up around him.
"Well, you
"Yeah, I needed it. Pep's gonna be calling me to come in, no doubt she and Bruce and them have been texting me--" Tony sighed into Steve's chest, forcing himself to breathe and not think.
He pulled his fingers out, if only for a second, to line up and gently push himself into Steve.
Peter nodded, picking up his fork.
He smooched Steve's cheek, a dorky smile on his lips.
"Steve, honey, I love you, but if you sing another chorus of "You are my Sunshine" I'm going to cry again," Tony mumbled, sniffling against Steve's chest.
"I got a few other things to take with us," he drawled, smirking, "I have a small-ish suitcase full of stuff to use. We're gonna have a really good week together."
Bucky moved his arm around a bit carefully, double checking everything.
"Goooo," Peter whined, frowning when Clint picked him up.
“I'm usually a chatterbox anyway, so I'm totally not opposed to telling you, leaving you notes," Tony hummed, trying to ignore the shy blush on his face, "You know I'm not good at this mushy stuff but I really am trying and I
He got quiet, eventually starting to curl in on himself. Steve was starting to get worried now.
Tony kissed Steve, putting his nose on his pulse point before standing and shuffling to his phone, starting to answer messages.
"That... this hasn't happened before." The blond said softly, shuffling a bit and finding that it made his issue more uncomfortable. "What makes this do this? Does this happen to you?"
Steve sent him a smile, soft and warm as he helped Tony out of his seat.
"No one should have to go through that, especially not a kid." He said seriously, wetness prickling at his eyes in frustration, but not allowing them to fall.
"Hmm... Well, you did say you were going to try and make it to where
The blond sighed as the panties were pulled away, freeing his cock from its confines. "And I'll gladly wear them if it makes you happy. As long as Bruce supplies, I'm not complaining. These are hella comfortable."
Peter curled up in the towel happily before putting it around his shoulders.
," Tony laughed, quickly pumping his fingers in and out before adding a third one, "We've got precious time, sweetcheeks, and I intend to use it."
He let everyone snuggle up around them, feeling a bit strange since he barely knew the people, but that soon subsided. It was all there as a comfort. Tony fell asleep amidst their combined warmth; when he woke, he had been moved back to his bed with just Steve, exhaustion clear on the elder’s face.
The blond hummed softly in sleep, stirring and settling softly into his chair. He sighed aloud in a half sleep before settling again. Tony waited for Steve to still before slipping out of bed, finding his clothes and exchanging them for his hospital gown, quickly going to the bathroom to wash his face. He wrung his hands dry, not surprised to see Steve and his judge-y look from across the room.
He nodded seriously, clumsily reaching down to pull his hospital gown up, showing Steve the red and white lacerations running up his thigh.
"Love you," he whispered, putting his head down and going to sleep.
What did I just hear out of your mouth?" Steve said, swooping in and grabbing Peter by the back of his pants and sitting him back down. "And you are still in time out. What has gotten into you, lately?"
"I'll probably wake up by the time we get back," Tony grumbled softly, trailing behind Steve to the parking lot, "Which means I can give you the show I promised."
Peter giggled, kicking his feet a bit in the water happily. He moved his hand down and put a glob of soap on Tony's beard, going into more giggles.
The man's expression was soft and warm, welcoming towards him as he stepped closer. He smiled at Steve with a longing, warm brown eyes starting to look a bit wet as he held his hand out for Steve to take.
He grinned, knowing the blood rushing to his partner's face wasn't due to gravity, like his.
"More than okay. I have a higher pain tolerance than most, Rogers," Tony panted, kissing him back, "I wanna do that again. A lot."
"3 weeks? No. Okay, months?"
"Now I'll show you something a little different." He said, twisting out and twisting back in, arms crossed and back against Steve's chest.
Steve's confusion deepened.
Tony laughed at that, his high-pitched laugh that made his stomach hurt.
"He really is. He great with science and math, but also likes to take pictures. He takes pictures for the school paper." Steve explained with a grin at Peter.
Tony fidgeted, tightly fisting the sheets.
"He is just so fascinated with that." He explained, running his hands comfortingly along Peter's back.
“Awe, c’mon Cap. I know you can get hit by two trucks and walk it off no problem. What’s three more gonna do?” Tony teased gently, earning another groan from the other. “In all seriousness though, I don’t blame you for just wanting to lay there unmoving. Your whole physical form shifted species in less than a minute, and last I checked, that is incredibly painful.”
Steve grinned lightly, leaning in to kiss gently at Tony's cheeks to cool them down.
Steve sent a quick swat to Tony's backside, running a soothing hand over it.
He grinned sheepishly at Steve and tried to straighten his back, gasping slightly at the pain that raced up his spine.
He looked up at his Papa with red-rimmed eyes, still sniffling.
"Not telling. No looking, either." Tony scribbled down his list, folding it and putting it in his pocket before Steve could look. "Thank you, sweets," He grinned, easily gulping down the cup of coffee in three sips.
"Whiner-- fuck," Tony breathed, letting himself fall back against the pillows.
"Please, Tony." He panted lightly, breaking the kiss to trail kisses along Tony's neck. "Please... Please..."
"Spoiled. Spoiled rotten." Steve whispered back with a small twitch of a smirk on his lips. "Well, you go and make Peter breakfast like you said you would and ask him about going to Bucky and Nat's, and I'll text Bucky about it while you do that. Fair?"
dinner." Steve clarified with a hum. "You were very good with waiting and very sweet with your baby brother. I'm proud of you, Peter."
"I could always sing you to sleep? It works for Peter." He chuckled. "Or I could gently kiss on you until you fall asleep. That would be a win/win."
"This is true. You must be well lubricated with all your talk to yourself when you work." Steve chuckled, turning to kiss the tip of Tony's nose. "What other ways do you keep things well?"
"Don't gotta beg, baby." Steve smirked, kissing at Tony's spine as he pulled out his fingers and worked to slick himself up.
Steve didn't know what to do for the project, which made him worry. The project wasn't due for another two months, but Steve didn't like to put things off, especially when it came to his artwork. He felt he needed to find his subject and find it fast. He pulled out his sketch pad and sat on the nearest bench, looking for something interesting to draw. Plants were too commonplace, so that choice was out. Steve looked around the concourse area, waiting for inspiration to strike.
"Yours?" he asked, rubbing his neck nervously.
He pulled back, albeit shyly, bottom lip between his teeth.
Tony laughed softly at that, nuzzling at Steve's chest again.
He stood and let Sammy hold his hands, beaming as the baby started to let go, squealing happily.
...!" Steve moaned with a slight growl in his voice, just mostly becoming a noisy mess after that. It was all getting to be too much. He couldn't do anything about it with the cock ring still on him.
"Alright you two, no PDA," Tony scolded, bringing in their plates from the kitchen.
"Well at least he tells the truth like we tell him to." Steve smiled as they headed downstairs. "I tell Peter how cute he and you are all of the time. Don't I, bubba?"
"They can't be innocent forever," he murmured, "I-- I'm gonna go give him a talk, alright? You can comfort him after, if you want."
"Those two'll be inseparable, no doubt. Sammy cries if he can't have Peter around." Steve hummed, starting to set up to make some eggs.
"M'hongry," he garbled around his thumb.
"I'm assuming Stevie wants to introduce us to the lady downstairs," Tony said softly, sitting up with Sammy on his chest.
"Yeah, y'can come in. Door's unlocked."
"Shh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Relax, Tony. Relax." Steve tried to soothe, holding Tony close to him. "Sometimes I forget how much younger you are, and I get onto topics you shouldn't have to worry about, I'm sorry, hon."
Steve nodded softly. "Yeah." He murmured. "It basically feels like it’s more routine and not special and intimate like it usually is."
Peter nodded, eagerly chowing down his breakfast. Tony laughed, sipping at his cup of coffee.
Steve sent a small smile their way, coming up to hug the two. "I love both of you boys. You are both my sweet boys."
"'Course, bubba. Go get your clothes on and I'll work on the rest."
He let that sit in the silence a moment before speaking again.
of what you'd like to do since you've got the sprout next door," Bucky mused, getting on top of a stepstool, "That's gonna be my Christmas present to you. Unlimited gift cards for letting the squirt chill at the cool house so his parents cannot be celibate elderly people."
"Mmm, donuts," Tony mumbled, yawning before letting his eyes slip shut, easily drifting back off to sleep.
Peter rolled his eyes, but didn't say any more, opting to dig out his dark green crayon to scribble in grass. His tongue poked out of his mouth while he doodled, trying to concentrate.
"Just do it. C'mon and come for me, Tony. I know you want to, so just let go, c'mon."
' all deh time, an'-- an' Gwenny says her parents yell lots an'--" Peter burst into tears, covering his face with his robe.
The blond chuckled when they separated, looking over to Peter. "Now you aren't the only one sticky." He laughed warmly, turning to peck Tony's lips again.
"What's wrong, love?" He murmured, "Just don't like it?"
Steve shrugged softly. "I don't think I'd mind it too bad, honestly. At least if I was exposed to it enough." He hummed in thought. "As long as people don't invade our complete and utter privacy." He said, giving Tony's hand a squeeze.
"If the cops come, you get to explain," he wheezed.
"Well, you can hear me all you'd like at the cabin." Steve breathed. "Right now, I need to be as quiet as I can make myself."
Tony rolled his eyes and grabbed Pete's towel, waiting for Steve to finish cleaning him up.
Peter just sighed in exasperation, rolling his eyes in perfect imitation of Tony.
TW: referenced past child abuse, self-harm, mentions of burns, talks of suicide
The second piece Tony didn't remember. It looked like he was sleeping, but his face looked completely peaceful and relaxed. This piece's canvas was a calming blue color, the lines slightly darker and flowing softly on the canvas. Both of the first two pieces just blew his mind. With how he had felt lately, he didn't think he had ever been able to make such expressions.
"He's gonna be a handful as a teen," Tony groaned, thunking his head against Steve's chest.
, I won't give you a blowjob."
"I try," Tony drawled, propping a knee up on the bed. He crawled over Steve, leaning down to nibble at his neck and collar. "Want you t'fuck me good, Steve," he murmured lowly, slipping a hand into Steve's boxers, "Want t'ride you."
"See you both in the morning..." Steve whispered sweetly to them both, hoping that they would all feel better in the morning. He kissed them both softly before shutting his eyes and letting himself fall asleep.
He snagged a blueberry from the box and flicked it into his mouth, moaning at the tangy taste.
I don't believe that for a minute," Tony tsked, "I get all these calls from the school that you get pulled into the principal's office. And you didn't think I'd find out?"
"Mmm, well, that part isn't until later, and you'll see why," Tony replied softly, gently necking Steve, "I'd rather let tensions out, if that's okay. Instead of hopping into bed."
"We can do that real quick before we get you settled into bed, okay? We'll take his bandaids with us."
Tony whimpered into his kisses, slowly turning himself around and sagging against Steve, wrapping his arms around him.
"Anyway, I am just calling to ask if you'd be willing to watch the boys for a night sometime soon."
"It’s okay, bubba." Steve answered softly. He leaned down to kiss the boy's head and pet at his hair. "Do you want me to stay in here and read to you before bed?"
He buried his face in Natasha's stomach, inhaling her scent of lavender and jasmine, instantly feeling his nerves be soothed.
"What am I gonna do with you?" The blond said to his husband fondly, shaking his head with a chuckle.
Tony snorted, reaching up to stroke Steve's hair.
"Love that y’
"It all about a comfortable pressure and pace; Whatever makes your body feel good, alright?" Tony continued, hand wrapped around Steve's and slowly starting to move them up and down the blond's member in slow strokes.
Bucky moved a bit closer towards Natasha and Clint, crossing his arms carefully.
"C'mon, Tony... Come for me... Take me there with you, baby. So close..." Steve moaned, thrusting up hard into Tony to nail his sweet spot.
"We can also talk about 'you literally taking care of me' business," Tony mumbled, sighing as he was lowered into the bathtub, "I really like this side of you."
"Universe decided to play nice with both of us in that regard, I suppose." Steve smiled softly, backing up as Tony pushed him. He fell onto the bed as the back of his legs hit the side, looking up at Tony from that position.
He paused. "Quietly."
"Sowwy, Daddy," he deadpanned, not apologetic at all.
Tony sighed happily under the covers, quickly falling asleep and snoring against the pillow in no time at all. The blond headed over towards the guesthouse first, knocking on the door and being greeted by a half asleep, bed-headed Bucky.
okay with that." He hummed excitedly, kissing back, and resting his hands along Tony's hips.
"Otay!" Peter exclaimed, hugging his penguin to his chest, "Den I can give Daddy his shark, right?"
In Steve's arms, Peter let himself be put down, attempting to take his day clothes off.
"That would be rude to the guests, and besides--" Steve started, blinking for a moment. "How are you doing that?"
"You're not greedy, baby. This is something normal for siblings." He explained. "Especially newer ones. But trust me when I say that I am trying my best to give you both attention."
. It was... Bad. At four I was already building circuit boards from scratch, making mini bots out of my alarm clocks and whatnot. I thought I could make Howard proud, but it just-- backfired."
Sammy hummed non-committedly, reaching up to pat Steve's face. He snuggled down next to Steve, happy that he finally got his Papa all to himself.
Steve's chest hurt a bit hearing that, taking a deep breath before speaking. "Peter please, we need to talk to you, baby."
"Alright buddy, Papa and I'll move the clothes, and you move the toys, okay?"
"Just because we adopted you, doesn't make you less special or love. If we hadn't adopted you, we wouldn't know what our lives would be like. Certainly wouldn't know how to take care of a kid or a baby." He stated. "We may have not conceived you, but you are still our boy. Our first, intelligent, and loving little boy. Heck, you are so much like daddy, no one would know you aren't blood related."
"It's your birthday, we can do whatever you want to, Tony." Steve smiled softly at him. "Today's supposed to be pretty warm too, so a walk would be great. And I might get a bagel myself at that bakery. But yeah, we can go for a walk today."
stuff, Steve. I want hardcore sex ASAP. I demand it."
"Then we'll go once we feel like moving," Tony decided, "It's a gorgeous place, Steve, it really is--"
"So...?" Steve answered back with a smirk of his own and a raise of a brow as he slowly worked his ways closer to Tony.
"Totally getting a fireplace. I can watch you chop wood shirtless,” He grinned, laughing into Steve's chest, "Don't worry babe, I'll keep you warm."
"Yeah, later." He grinned sweetly. "There better be one time that you'll only speak to me in Italian the whole time, too. So you know."
"He spent five hours without food, I'd be super hungry too if I were him," she hummed, letting the baby finish off the bottle.
"Take care now, Mr. and Mr. Stark-Rogers," she teased lightly, showing them out to the waiting room.
He grinned, easily dragging the box off to his workshop.
you blushing, Tony. Wow." Steve chuckled, moving to set food on the plates.
Tony really couldn't help the whimper that leaked from his throat, biting his tongue to try and keep his cock from twitching.
"Mhm."
Sammy continued to whine softly, slowly petering out as Tony bounced him.
"Are yer legs tired?" He asked, sitting down on the blanket and tugging Sammy into his lap, "Wanna read?"
"Not exactly... Am I in trouble, Mr. Stark?"
"Damn, still so tight, baby. Even after almost a whole hand?" He huffed, a slow burn already working up his spine.
"Yeah, yeah." Steve smirked, reaching to palm Tony gently through his boxers. "Because this is the 'no sex so we have a place to stay before meeting the parents and not smelling like sex' room."
"I love you too," Tony whispered back, gently smooching him back, "So much. So, so much."
"Love you too, Tony." Steve chuckled lightly as Tony nuzzled, getting tickled a little. "Love you
Peter nodded, already half asleep in Tony's arms. Tony stood, gently carrying Peter over to the bed before laying him down, pulling the covers up to his chin. He grabbed his pajamas and quickly changed, sliding under the warm blankets to curl up to the little bear.
"Noooo," Peter whined, kicking the seat lightly, "Daddyy--"
"I love you," he murmured.
By the time Steve was done talking, Tony was already asleep again, snoring softly into Steve's palm. Steve let out a small laugh at that, trying to relieve some of the tension in his body.
The feeling of outliving that Tony as well, however, still didn't settle any better.
Tony grinned, placing sloppy kisses all over Steve's face before plucking the ring from its box, slipping it onto Steve's left ring finger. "Oh my god," He choked, happiness swelling up in him, "I might cry."
"I'm sure I would. But ask me again when I actually remember everything. Still sure I'll say yes, but it wouldn't hurt to ask." he grinned playfully.
"Go ahead and try. I went twenty six years without having sex. I could deal with however long you could with it." He hummed. "And what lesson would I learn?
Fury pinched the bridge of his nose, letting out an exasperated sigh as is right-hand-merman swam up beside him with an expression to match.
"Mhm. I think this is right. Right? I mean, I don't
"They keep happening, love." He said quietly, pulling Tony in gently and stroking his hair. "Is it nerves? Is that why they keep coming back?"
"I'll ask, I'll ask," Tony laughed, setting Peter on his feet, "You know they'll say yes."
Steve got up from the bed and headed over to Tony, offering up his arms to take the baby.
"What?" Steve asked curiously until he stepped in front of the mirror, flush crawling down his body.
specifically?" Steve whispered to himself, appalled at what he had seen. "Why
"Actually, I'm writing code for Dummy to learn how to shake hands," he grinned, turning the screen to Steve.
"I look forward to it." Steve grinned, slight heat on his cheeks. "I'll be sure to fit it into my work schedule. But when it’s warmer out, we're going for a run now and then."
"I want you, Stevie, so badly," He breathed, letting go with a wet 'pop', "Wanna watch you finger yourself open for me."
Steve rolled his eyes fondly at the other as he tried to roll onto his back, grunting as he managed and plopped back down on the pallet. He looked up at the other carefully, clearing his throat and breaking the other out of his thoughts.
"Just don't let him be giving you trouble, Tony. You keep me in touch." She warned, kissing his cheek. "I'll leave these papers with you to go through. Let you spend time with your... friend. But I expect you to explain this all to me in more detail later."
He grinned, nuzzling Steve's neck to show he was teasing.
Tony gave a few of the things over for Steve to wrap, pushing the tape dispenser over.
The blond bit his bottom lip for a moment in thought, bracing himself for what was sure to be a scolding.
Steve hummed in response, nuzzling up to Tony and kissing at his chest.
"That sounds like a great condition. Also means you have a plan, and I can't wait to see it," he nearly purred, kissing at Tony's blush.
Tony laughed, taking the opportunity to easily clean the rest of Peter off, wringing out the washcloth before letting the water go.
"You're certainly fit enough for twenty years younger," Tony murmured, "You have more stamina than me, like /damn/, Steve."
"I'm 'tay... tank you, Daddy." He said softly finishing off his sniffles.
wanted. And loved. And cared so, so deeply about, Tony. And you better know that now if you didn't know before." He explained softly. "And what made you think I wouldn't say yes? I was the one who managed to bring it up, what, the first or second day I knew you?" He huffed in a chuckle.
"No need to beg, love." Steve hummed, removing his fingers. He moved Tony where he was laying back on the bed, pulling him into a heated kiss before moving to slick up.
"EXCUSE ME?".
He lifted up the pad slightly to show Steve the sketch of Peter's room.
"Son of a--" Steve said nervously, quickly bandaging up the gash and scooping Tony up. He rushed up the stairs and headed into the kitchen, looking for the keys to the Mercedes, some juice and something sugary to eat before heading out to the garage.
." He whined, his arms growing tired and unable to hold his upper body up anymore.
Tony gave Steve a unbelieving look.
"Basically." Natasha said softly. "But not all at once. It can be overwhelming that way."
Peter whined softly until he fell asleep, whines turning to quiet snores between the two adults.
"Glad you like it." Steve called back as he went to get Sammy a bottle. "As for how we met, it’s an unlikely story."
Peter tiptoed over to the edge of the bed, going up on his toes to try and climb up.
'KEEP OFF BEACH. OR ELSE.'
"Maybe. You do have more knowledge in that field than I do." He chuckled, finishing up in the shower and stepping out to dry off. "My surprise for both of you, you'll never guess."
"Did I wear you out already?" He teased.
"At least you were trying to do something nice, baby. But you know you can't be drawing on walls without permission, right?" He asked the boy softly.
Steve kept back the slight pang of sadness at Tony's response as he parked the car, getting out to help the other regardless. "We'll get you settled and I'll make you a quick sandwich to take with your pain medicine, all right?"
Tony sighed softly, reaching up to brush away the tears that threatened to fall.
"Whatcha wanna do, pip?"
“You seem remarkably calm about this, Steve.” Tony pointed out, glancing over at the blond “Especially for someone who is going to have to deal with 9 more transformations at least until we can get some sort of information.”
"Okay," The boys chorused, happy to hunker down on the couch.
"Dammit, what the hell does he want?".
"You'd want a whole army of kids if you could have them, wouldn't you?" Tony murmured, gently scratching at the base of Steve's neck, "Hopefully, we'll have heard back from the surrogate when we get back from the cabin."
"Can you laugh again honey? Hmm? You did so well!" Tony praised, gently bouncing the boy on his knee, "Do I need to tickle you to have you laugh for the camera?"
Steve flushed for just a quick moment at Tony's new position, stilling for the moment. "That's a different thing. That's controlled hits." He explained softly.
"Yeah, as we got older, she just told Buck to call her by her first name. They knew each other long enough at that point." Steve explained, resting back against the couch with a soft hum.
"Speaking of talking, I have something I need to talk to you both about a little later in private." He murmured.
Nodding, Tony kissed Steve's ring hand, sniffling before being able to settle down. He coughed, drew the covers up around them, and promptly fell asleep against Steve's chest, snoring loudly. Steve smiled to himself hearing Tony snore, holding him close in a form of comfort. Tony obviously had some damage when it came to people caring for him, but Steve truly did love him dearly, and would do whatever to make Tony know that. He left a feather-light kiss on the man's cheek before shutting his own eyes and drifting off to sleep.
"No no, hon. I will clean the kitchen once Peter is taken care of." Steve insisted softly. "Stick around and help me get the rugrat cleaned and clothed?"
Tony didn't drift off to sleep; he stayed up until he was sure Peter was out, then returned the boy to his own bed, tucking him in. It was around five in the morning when his body forced him to sleep, sending him into a dreamless state curled into Steve's side. Steve had woken a couple hours later, feeling small hands pushing against his arm softly. He poked his eyes open to see the small hands were Peter's.
"Don't gimmie those eyes, only Pete can do that," he muttered.
Steve leaned in slightly, elbows on his knees and hand pushing his glasses up.
"As for occupying, I can take him out for a Father/Son day of our own." He suggested. "Go to the park for a while to play in the snow before it melts, go out for cocoa, and just spend the day together."
The text binged only a minute to later, to which Tony turned off the computer and headed back to the bedroom.
, silly," Tony laughed, "It'll be in the next couple months, very soon. As soon as we get the papers signed." He continued to smooch Steve's temple, nosing at his soft hair.
"I meant with how smart he is and caring and kind. And sweet. Kind of stubborn, but that can't be helped when we're raising him." Steve explained, kissing Tony's cheek soothingly. "The difference is the environment he's growing up in that causes some differences. He's all of the qualities that I love about you, be happy of that."
"Anything you want to add?"
"It’s not a bad thing, Tony." Steve grinned, walking towards Tony, wrapping arms around him. "You are perfect snuggling height."
"Can I sit at dah tay- tayble?" Peter tried, carefully enunciating the word.
Things were running smoothly, but Tony felt their was still a small disconnect. So he offered an invitation to Steve that allowed him to venture where no outsider was allowed to enter before...
"He is right. Time for boys named Peter to be asleep. Especially when they are sick." Steve agreed, kissing Peter's forehead.
Steve stirred from the pokes, grumbling softly. Without yet opening his eyes, he flopped down onto Tony's chest, snuggling at it.
Steve gave a soft smile at that, kissing the top of Peter's head.
"How you have such strength, I'll never know," Tony chuckled, "Come on in, Doc. I'll get my checkbook."
Sammy giggled happily at Tony, patting his beard before settling against his chest, sucking on his thumb. Tony smiled fondly, grabbing one of the muffins from the box before giving Sammy his teething ring.
Tony nodded, slipping his fingers down to Steve's entrance again.
"Steve!"
"Clinton was clever, I will give you that." Steve chuckled lightly. "Nine letter word for deep love and respect...?"
Tony shrugged.
"Well, that’s the technical term for it." Steve answered innocently. "That’s how I know it. Put that in your crossword." He joked lightly.
Tony laughed at that, putting his cup aside.
"Daddyyyy," Peter griped, sitting down with his plate, "Stop bein' gwoss wiff Papa an' eat."
Tony rubbed the stinging from his eyes, sniffling quietly.
Sorry it has been so long since an update! I have started to try and get back into writing again, and have been working on updating this series and “You Want Thingamabobs?”. I will be alternating between the two on updates, so please stick around!
"It’s about four in the afternoon." He answered, petting Tony's hair back softly. "You feeling okay? You seem sluggish."
while. You still aren't even in school yet. We wouldn't expect you to do things like that, okay?"
"Nothing wrong knowing how to cook things that don't involve a microwave." He said seriously.
Steve looked to Tony with faux concern on his face. This was kind of fun.
"Told you," she hummed, turning back to Sammy.
"Chatter, Tony. We don't want that." He murmured, trailing fingers down the man's spine.
"Peggy, don't look at me like--"
"They's some'a m'friends at ballet," Peter hummed, clutching his penguin to his chest, "Are we gonna make cookies?"
"Steve? Hon, whenever you're done fiddling up there, the gang's here to wish us off," Tony called up the steps, juggling Peter on his hip.
"And that’s just fine that he is interested in the science and technology like you." Steve explained. "It just-- the way you worded it. It makes me feel like what I am teaching to Peter is a complete waste of time..." He murmured, turning to look back at the baby.
"Tony..." He said, shaking his head lightly. "You know that I would never...right?"
"You can hold him whenever I eat, I promise." Steve hummed, playing with a giggly Sammy.
Steve was quiet for a long while before he finally broke a bit, breath shaky as he fell into a seat on the couch.
"It's ah--well--"
Tony wrapped his arm around Peter and gently pushed them down the slide, careful to not hold too tightly. He laughed at Peter's stunned expression, setting him on his feet at the end of the slide. Peter looked up at Tony still a bit stunned with a grin growing on his face.
"Good job, Buddy," Tony grinned, taking the blanket.
"Daddy? Papa?" Peter's voice called behind the locked door softly.
"Yep, 358," Tony reminded him, peeling off into the street, "Now, Peter, when we get there, you have to stick by Papa and I, alright? You're gonna have to sanitize and not touch anything, okay?"
Peter grinned and smooched Steve back, turning to give Tony his gift.
"Uh-huh. We's getting da good stuffs." Peter said matter-of-factly. "We's gonna eat 'n swing 'n slide n' all sorts a'stuffs!"
"Hi," he mumbled.
about it, and it won't be for a good couple years down the road," Tony whined, "I'm just thinking, Stevie."
Before he had started to drive, he texted Tony and let him know they would be home soon. He peered back at Peter with a smile, just thinking how adorable his boy was as he pulled into the parking space at a Walgreen's.
"Well, that was a nice way to wake up," Tony murmured, slightly dazed, "What was that for?"
"Yeah, yeah, I'm doing better, I've gotta reinforce these walls though. Soundproof 'em," he murmured, reaching up to pet Steve's hair, "I thought you were angry at me for telling Peter to call you Mommy, and if you wanted to opportunity to talk we could do it semi-privately. And I actually needed to get work done. That too."
"Oh my god, Steve--" Tony laughed; if he didn't, he'd start crying.
Steve shivered, but this was for an entirely different reason than being cold.
cuddling," Tony grinned back, easing Steve up to help him out of his shirt, "I miss your body warmth."
"Old, Brucey. Probably Smithsonian-worthy, but they'd be better in use than on a shelf," Tony hummed, lacing his fingers with Steve's hand, "Now, the flask is slightly cracked, but the rest of it is operable, if you'd like to use it. Decoration's all good, too--"
"I miss them," he managed, closing his eyes to try and keep his tears in, "God, I miss my mother like hell. She should be here to see her grandson, even
"Bye!" Bruce yelled from his place, walking towards the back door, "If you all need me, I'll be trying to get
Moans escaped Steve's mouth quicker and quicker even though Tony kept slow, gaining in volume each movement. Each thrust was on point and filled with pleasure as he felt himself barely dangling at the edge.
"See? You're okay," Tony soothed, gently bouncing the boy on his knee while Sammy nibbled on his teether.
"I want to marry you," he blurted, "As soon as possible. We'll go to the courthouse, and we can do the fancy ceremony later if you want, but I-- I really want to be yours. Completely. God, I've needed you so much in my life, and fuck me if I'm gonna push you away." He paused. "...Again."
"But you said we was going to the 'quariuuuum," Pete whined, stomping on the bed, "You said Daddy was goin'!"
"We are proud of you for showing Sammy though, Peter. Just do it with our permission from now on." Steve said with a small smile.
"I love you, too. I'm sorry it got to the point of missing me when I'm right here." He hummed softly, kissing Tony's cheek. "We just had a lot going on."
"Mmm. Vacation," Tony murmured, letting his eyes slip shut, "Wake me up f'lunch. Or dinner. Whichever."
"What sort of fun are you wanting to have, love?" He asked softly when he entered back in the bedroom with a hum, tapping his fingers on the desk.
get dressed, and I--" he grinned, sticking his tongue out at Steve, "I get to set up the house, so to speak."
"Uh-huh." Peter nodded softly, leaning in Tony's touch. "When you come back, we all gonna have cuddles, right?" He asked innocently, bright brown eyes looking up at his daddy.
"I do though, baby," Tony smiled weakly, pushing Peter's wet bangs to the side, "I know exactly how many times I've messed up, too. But I try not to think of it, 'cause every one of them has helped me as much as it hurt me."
Tony stood quietly in Steve's arms, not really wanting to return the hug: he felt disgusted with himself, more guilt prickling on his skin. He let Steve hold him for as long as he needed to, staying in his own thoughts.
"You alright, Tony?" He asked softly, reaching to soothe Tony's bottom. "Now then, how would you like to earn your extra credit?"
Steve leaned down to capture Tony's lips as he finished pushing in, kissing him deeply as he started to move. He hummed breathlessly against Tony's lips, the starts of friction feeling fantastic.
"You seem like it. I'm in the Rosen dorms. I suppose its more science-oriented there.".
"How about you sleep with Papa and me tonight?" He whispered, smiling fondly at the boy's nod, "Alright, I'm gonna tuck you in, then Papa and I will get ready for bed, and we can have lots of cuddles."
He smiled, only turning when a tiny yawn caught his attention.
Peter continued to pout as he listened to Tony, staying silent the whole time. He started to sniffle lightly, keeping tears from falling from his eyes.
Steve sat down beside them on the bed and smooched Peter's cheek lovingly.
Tony grabbed his favorite blanket off the back of the chair and wrapped it around himself, about to get comfy when he phone chimed.
"Essentially." Steve reiterated. "It’s because you are the starter of making things naughty." Steve grinned, waggling his eyebrows playfully.
"Well-- I mean, you can, but I'm not sure you'd like what you'd find," he replied quietly, "There's stuff out there from my rebellious phase before I met you, and-- a video of Howard that a butler of mine managed to get out. It's... heavy, Steve."
"That was beautiful." Steve said before he groaned softly with Tony's movements. "Definitely wanna hear more of that." Steve grinned sweetly. He place his hands on the back of Tony's neck and ran his fingers through in encouragement.
"Steve! Just the man I wanted to see!" Tony chuckled, ushering the blond over. "C'mere, I want you to try something for me. I promise it won't hurt." He assured, holding out a device that looked almost like some sort of collar.
"What way did you think it would go?" Tony laughed softly, scratching his stubble against Steve's cheek.
The boy shook his head softly, shuffling his feet a bit.
He leaned in to kiss Tony's cheek before he left. "Drive safe. See you soon."
"Not surprised. Nat's a domineer," Tony laughed, looking up at Steve, "She probably made Clint and him go at it for hours before she joined them."
Steve huffed a small laugh, a bit bashful of how close Tony was getting though the only just met. But it felt right, though. Must be how soul mates worked.
"So Daddy, what do ya say we get things set up to make those cookies?" The blond said with a grin, looking over at Tony.
Johann's wicked grin grew wider at the thought, knowing what he could grab would help his power and cause a bump in the merman's attempt to win the human over.
Everyone's car was parked in the back, unseen from the sides and front of the house as they came up on it. As he went to unlock the front door for them to go in, he opened the door up slowly and offered for Tony to go in first.
"Ah--yeah, it has." Steve gasped, adjusting to the digit. "Too long for our own good, anyway." He murmured, rolling his hips to tell Tony to continue.
"You're a hell of an officer in my book," Tony purred, tugging the blankets up around them, "Just like I'm a teacher in yours. Which we should do again. Soon."
"I got's a penguin, too! Can I show Auntie Tasha my penguin, Papa?" Peter asked as he bounce with excitement.
Peter blinked and nodded, still too young to quite understand. He gave Steve a smile and leaned up to kiss his cheek, drawing him into a hug.
"It doesn't feel like it's been a year since the accident," he mumbled.
"So gorgeous. So gorgeous how you take in my cock so willingly, baby. So, so good—“
"You've already done that. And I know you'd keep doing that without even trying." Steve said softly, reaching to caress Tony's cheek. "You are so good to him, Tony. He looks up to you so much, so you must be doing right."
"Bye Papa," He said sweetly, grabbing Sammy's teether ring and blanket before going over to his room.
"I have a feeling this will become frequent." The blond hummed, allowing Tony to curl up on top of him. "What other ways do you suggest? Being a doctor, I know of substances to help, but I would like to know what you suggest, detective."
"Then that should be a good indicator." He smirked back, kissing Tony's cheek. "Let’s get the boys."
"Wanna make love to you. Slow and relaxed. Let me work you out from all the stress you have dealt with lately." Steve explained, gently setting Tony onto the bed. "Will you let me do that to you?"
"I know how you are, and there is a 97% chance I need to fix you up a bit." Steve insisted, cleaning up the dishes and leftovers.
He got quiet, smiling into Steve's belly.
"Oh please do call him. I believe he would find no disrespect to either." Schmidt simply grinned back, a wicked one it was, "Mr. Rogers knows the rules and that I am a grand stickler for promptness here. And he comes in ten minutes late after I gave him time off on his last shift. I do not see that as disrespectful." He stated smoothly. "Besides, what is one simple security guard to men in our profession?"
When Tony woke next, the bed was cool. He frowned at the lack of a warm body, but quickly retracted his thoughts when he heard tiny feet pattering down the hall.
"No kidding. To put it in terms for Steve, the place would probably look like a painting by Jackson Pollock." Bucky chuckled, Steve giving him a playful punch in the arm.
"Pete's gonna have a lil brother or sister," he whispered.
Steve chuckled softly at him. "Well, I'll just have to buy you some so you can practice, Anthony." He laughed, smoothly filling in the rest of the silhouette. "I can help, if you'd like me to?" He offered softly.
"Seven letter word for severe mental or physical pain. Wow, today's puzzle is depressing." He murmured.
He leaned into Steve's embrace, letting his eyes drift shut. Steve petted at Tony's hair gently, trying to soothe and relax him as they sat in silence for a while.
Everyone in the room was a bit surprised as the TV came on itself, Pepper wearing a pleased smile.
Steve silently nodded, kissing Tony back before getting off of the bed. He stripped out of his clothes and went to the nightstand to grab lube and began slicking up his fingers. He crawled back over Tony again on the bed, reaching down and carefully pressing two fingers at Tony's entrance.
up for it," Tony purred, snuggling up to Steve, "I'm thinking of it as a reward. Since you're so good for me."
Wedding bells.
The blond hummed contently, flopping down beside Tony and crawling to the other's side, kissing at his face gently.
smoochies."
"Meanie," the boy whined, going limp in Steve's hold.
Tony sent back comfort through their bond, scooping Peter up from Steve's lap to hold him.
"This is moving just fine for me, Tony." He said back softly, brushing over Tony's bangs. "This is perfect for me. I promise."
Peter shucked his overalls and underwear off, easily climbing into his bubble bath with a happy sigh. He poured a generous amount of shampoo into his little hands, quickly lathering up his hair.
e me?"
"Now get my belt for me and lay across my lap."
A small beeping noise started to come from Tony's pocket. He pulled out his cellphone and the beeping stopped. As Tony unlocked the screen, the voice of an older English gentleman emitted from the phone.
you." He kneeled up, pressing kisses over Steve's cock through his panties.
"Yeah." Clint replied. "Hey, are you sketching for your project?".
"Oh, so she gets to be in cahoots, then." Steve hummed. "Don't know why Tony had me call then, but is tomorrow night good for you all?"
Sammy babbled at them before reaching up to Tony, kicking his legs.
Steve started to scoot back into the deeper water, before Tony stopped him with a question.
He got up from the bed, shoving his hands in his pockets with a smirk. Steve groaned as Tony got up, hanging over the side of the bed and reaching for Tony.
"Now who's squishin' who!" He yelled, keeping his hands on Steve's chest to keep him down.
You've taken him out of his crib
Steve nodded carefully, give a serious and stern look.
"You and that outfit." Steve said jokingly, shivering slightly at Tony's feet. "But yeah, Bruce and Clint seem cool. And they all seem to be there for you, so that's all I could ask for."
"Mmm, never a tease," Tony chuckled, tugging Steve's briefs off and tossing them aside.
Peter giggled again, shrugging.
He caught Steve's lips again, hungrily drawing him deeper into the kiss. The blond complied eagerly, moving his hands down to tug off Tony's pants. He made a happy noise as he felt something familiar. He pulled back and looked down with a grin.
“I heard. Got into a heated argument with a Mr. Eugene Schmidt. Threatened him, witnesses say." Steve stated nonchalantly, playing it up. "We do not take threats lightly, Mr. Stark. Hope you have a good lawyer."
He popped bread into the toaster, hopping up onto the counter. Fiddling with his cup, Tony kicked his legs.
"That's why we got collars," Tony hummed to himself, continuing to scratch Steve. He grinned, feeling Steve shift on his leg.
He ate the sandwich Steve placed in front of him and managed a few swallows of tea, sitting back when he felt full.
"Why? What's wrong?".
Peter stuck his tongue out and buried his face in Steve's shirt.
Maybe he should look up things? Just to see. But he was going to ask Tony about it first before he did. Just so he knew about what he was going to do.
"....Papa?" He whispered, a forlorn look in his eyes.
," Clint grinned, earning a groan from Tony.
Steve looked back surprised. Howard Stark was the biggest name in business here in Manhattan. Who knew his soulmate would be important.
Steve had been walking briskly towards Tony's dorm, worrying himself along the way. He was trying to think of what all he should say. I mean, he was still a little confused on how he himself felt about the whole subject, but he figure he needed to at least try and talk about it with Tony and just go from there.
"K-kay... 'M sorry, Daddy. 'M sorry." The boy said pitifully, nuzzling into Tony's shirt.
"Shut up. Wait till I'm really subby, I'll make you bathe me," Tony chuckled, nuzzling into Steve's chest, "Of course I'm comfy. It's all the belly fat."
Steve nodded, placing a hand on top of Tony's around his waist and petting it softly.
"Yeah, thanks,
Natasha nodded. "Yeah, everything is set up for Steve to organize as he'd like." She explained. "I know most people are particular about how things like that are placed, so I'll leave that to you."
"Alright, enough sap," Clint announced, "How much longer till dinner? I can smell the ham, and I
"Over my lap, Stevie."
"I know, bubba. Papa had this happen before." Steve hummed softly. "I'm really allergic to a chemical in Tide detergent. Gramma bought it once for us and I went into anaphylactic shock trying to put on a shirt."
"I know, baby. Once the nurse comes and checks you over, we can leave and you can sleep while we drive home, okay?" Steve soothed, petting at Peter's hair.
"Yes. Your ass is gorgeous in satin," He hummed, kissing Steve back before moving down to nibble on his neck, "More gorgeous in nothing, but still pretty damn hot."
"We'll never leave you behind, baby bear. Never ever." He assured at a whisper.
Sam made a curious garble over at Peter, wiggling his free hand over at the boy.
"Kay," Tony murmured, pulling the blankets up around themselves before settling down, easily falling asleep.
"Captain
," he mumbled softly.
The group all took care in comforting Tony so he stayed calm as he tried to eat. Tear-soggy toast never tasted good. There was another ring of the doorbell, Steve going up this time to get it.
"Terrible. Absolutely terrible." He whined, head starting to loll backwards.
"M'glad, 'cause I'll always be brilliant. And charming. And loving," Tony teased, smiling softly at Steve, "God, I'm so head over heels for you. I feel like a teenager."
Steve groaned at Tony's nails in his back, moaning as he felt Tony clench around him. God, he missed that feeling. He gave a few more shallow trusts before he came inside Tony's warmth.
"Loser."
He bit his lip, tapping at Steve's chest.
The blond panted softly against Tony's lips in the kiss, humming quietly at the taste. He reached up to gently cup Tony's face, pushing forward slightly to make the kiss a little deeper. Tony chuckled and let Steve have his way, swiping his tongue over the roof of the blond's mouth before pulling away.
"It is, and we like it that way," Tony huffed, helping Peter out of his day clothes before putting him in the bath, floating his ducky over to him, "You'll understand when you're older, sweetheart. It just seems weird 'cause you're still a youngin'."
"I lub yew," he mumbled into Steve's pant leg, hugging him as tight as he could, "I didn' mean t'make ya upsets--"
"I know baby, but in
speak. His body was thrumming, muscles twitching now and then as he tried to relax. He eyes started to shut as he felt Tony messing with his hair, slowly leaning over and leaving a feather-light kiss against Tony's shoulder.
"Even so, you should ask before just taking him, okay?" Steve explained. "Something could happen."
Steve just shrugged with a laugh at that. "Hey, Jersey's out of the state, so I could at least say that." He chuckled, rolling over and burying his face into Tony's stomach. "As long as the motel hasn't had a murder in it."
After not getting a response from the red-headed Russian, Tony deleted all the messages incase Steve wanted to snoop, grabbed his wallet and keys and headed upstairs.
"I'm not going to push you off the bed, Tony." Steve huffed softly. "I'd still like to know
"C'mon Pete, let's go play in your room, okay?" Tony murmured, taking the boy's hand with a gentle squeeze.
"Oh great," Tony groaned, "Incessant baby talk. It begins."
"I'm pretty sure there would be a lot of legal problems if you went around the airways in the suit." Steve hummed. "But the spandex would be doable." He chuckled.
Look at all those presents Santa left. I wonder who all
Tony mouthed 'Mommy' over Peter's head, grinning.
He took his time to strip himself down to his briefs, spreading Steve's legs before kneeling between them.
getting divorced. We love each other too much."
"I can't wait. And I shall attempt to do the same for you." Steve grinned before heading back to his own apartment, humming happily.
"That one should probably stay private." Steve said quickly, light pink on the tips of his ears. "Not sure how guests would feel about that, y'know. But all that other stuff sounds good. The house will look good when it’s decorated."
He smiled softly, melting into Steve's embrace.
"If you like these, we can look into getting you a bigger size. See how much your ass can swallow."
"I don't see how chewing on fingers is like me, but I can see the determined part." Steve smirked, letting Sammy chew his finger.
Tony furrowed his eyebrows, pouting slightly.
He paused to let the blood rush to his head, sighing once he could skip over to the nursery.
Once it was set, he weaseled his way under the covers with Tony, instinctively wrapping himself around his husband.
"Steve, he got away!" Tony called, snickering.
"Come here," he voiced, "Hands and knees, soldier. And bring me the gag."
Steve hummed softly at the boy as he started to rinse out his hair.
He paused. "And you're gonna join me."
Steve ran his fingers along the lace delicately, looking up at Tony with puppy dog eyes.
"Right. I would. And I'd say it more." Tony frowned. "Bringing up women in bed? Rude."
"That sounds like a wonderful plan." Steve fully agreed, shuffling in the room behind Tony and moving to change. He quickly snuggled underneath the blankets, lifting them up for Tony to sneak in.
He reached out to Tony, fingers carding through his husband's hair as he continued to work him.
"See? All better," Tony hummed, picking the baby back up, "No need to cry, sweets."
"Fuck," Tony muttered, leaning up on one elbow, "You're so pretty with my cock in your mouth, babe." He smirked, running a hand through Steve's hair before pulling his head back, slowly thrusting up into his mouth.
want, baby?" Steve purred, nipping his lip back as he moved back in. "Whatever you want. A little extra Christmas gift for you."
"Ah, cheer up, Bruce. You get to be in Stevie's story too, don't you worry," Bucky grinned, leaning against the door frame, "I'm guessing mine'll have to do with my arm, right?"
"You haven't been insensitive, Tony." Steve reassured softly. "You've had a lot to deal with the past few days. I've had years to deal with this. It just resurfaced again in light of everything, but it'll die back down again, too. I've been more concerned with helping you through everything than that."
? It's gonna be fucking fantastic," Tony breathed, adjusting the ice pack so he could cuddle up to Steve, "Mmm, I have to give you your gift too. And we gotta use Bruce's stuff that he gave us."
The blond grinned, locking their door just in case and capturing Tony's lips soft and slow. He hummed the tune of 'Baby, It's Cold Outside' against them playfully as he stroked his husband's sides lovingly.
"Of course, baby, I didn't forget about your cuddles," Tony murmured, leaning down to kiss the boy's temple.
"So, counter or wall first?"
"Of course you're not. Neither am I. I just know that there are people who don't wanna know." He explained softly. "Otherwise I would. I
"Me? The touch craving one? Uh, that would be
"Peter? Keep a close eye on your brother for me. I need to go check on Daddy, okay?" He asked softly, kissing Peter's head before heading down to the shop.
"Don't question it, you'll do fine," Tony snapped, knuckles white as he roared into the garage, "Upstairs, my room, I'm so fucking angry--"
"Well, he is a kid," Tony muttered, leaning onto Steve, "He can swear when he's older, but not when he's my innocent baby."
"Fuck, Steve, gonna--can't hold much more,
"Then be quiet," Tony hummed, not surprised at how well Steve responded, "He's too young to know." He gently nibbled on Steve's collarbones, slowly pumping him under the sheets.
"Mmm, you almost caught me in my last bout. When Dad died. For the bastard he was, still hurt like a bitch. And I did the day I met you. Before I met you. I'd just cleaned myself up when you gave me my mail." Tony laughed weakly, a choked sob hitching in his throat.
"Of course, love." Steve smiled back softly. "I'll be back, don't go anywhere, okay? Love you."
"That’s not what I meant by any of that, you know. But I will apologize. Sorry." The red head said quietly, keeping eye contact regardless.
The stylist looked between Tony and Steve with a small sense of shock on his face before lightly grabbing Steve by the shoulders.
"I don't doubt it. Except in nightmares, but who
Pete eventually clambered into the room in his shark onesie, climbing on the bed to lay down next to Sammy.
"I'm so sure that’s why." Steve said teasingly as he watched Tony snatch up the baby.
"Mmm, good, pleasantly sore," He murmured, "Need a shower before we go."
"You should learn to be less offended when the intent is well meant." Steve laughed, rolling his eyes, "Best mind your hands, mister. You're only allowed to get slightly handsy on the bike, during the movie, and behind locked doors." He warned playfully.
"Dey look funny," Peter giggled, "Its eyes are weally wei'd."
"Sorry. I just wanted to be sure." He said quietly, stroking Tony's head gently. "Need me to get you anything or do anything to help out?"
"It's not a problem at all. I'm glad to help out all I can." Pepper explained fondly. "I'll always come help out if you need me fast unless I am out of state or country."
"Alright. Manly things." Steve said in a deep voice to sound tough, only leading him into laughing. "Okay, alright. No feelings talk. Gotcha."
Comments are always always appreciated!!
"Wake me up if Bruce shows up early to deliver the stuff," he mumbled, "I fully expect him to be."
"You're doing well." He repeated. "That's all I could ask of you is to do your best and do well. Proud of you."
"I can't wait. Sounds like a good time--" he chuckled, moving to stand up. "Let’s get things started then with the wall, here."
"Get some sleep, and when you wake up I'll take your temperature," Tony hummed, smooching his temple, "I'll be back later."
"A stowy they tell
Tony frowned.
"I'm so grateful to have you guys. I couldn't ask for any better friends. Thank you."
He immediately dashed for the pile of plushie around the store, carefully selecting his victims to take home. Steve smiled at the boy's reasoning and giggled at the half boy-half plush mound that was running back to him near the cash register. He picked off the penguin covering Peter's face, giving the boy a grin.
"Oh goodness, he'll be a terror when he starts moving around." Steve laughed nervously. "Sure to give me a heart attack from keeping him from getting into things."
Tony hummed happily, slowly snuggling up into his warmth. "Always enjoy," He mumbled back.
Steve's cheeks warmed for a moment at Tony's action, moving to change into some painting clothes before he could think of what could be in store later.
"What, I can't kiss my son in public?" Steve grinned, booping their noses together for good measure. "C'mon, we'll get ice cream, the shark and the penguin, and go from there."
Eventually, Peter grew into his boyish nature, finding backtalk and his Dad's language much more fun than behaving himself. And of course, on the day that Tony
"You feel so good, Tony." Steve praised. "And you're so good to me. Y'take such good care of me. So sweet."
a bludgeoning. It is very clear that my brother was meticulously torn open!" The younger replied.
"Mmm, maybe, but now that you can read my thoughts through the bond, it gets a little tricky." He admitted with a playful grin.
Steve obliged and set it beside the younger. The brunette then picked it up and perused through the pages. As he looked at the sketches, Steve got slightly nervous. The guy had a great pokerface. Not a sense of acknowledgement towards the sketches. There was a very slight reaction however when he reached the last sketch. It was the one Steve did of the guy. Steve's face grew hot as the brunette closed the cover.
"Not really. He's just been thinking some stuff isn't big boy stuff, or 'he's too old for it.'" Bucky shrugged carefully. "I personally think it’s all fine for his age."
"Whoa, buddy. Don't get ahead of the game, there." Steve chuckled, swooping in to grab the griddle before it could fall and hurt Peter somewhere. "Gotta be careful with that, Peter."
Tony thumped his head back again, tugging on his bonds. "Yea, yes, please, fuck me Sir, make love later," he whined, needy, "Please,
He laughed, pulling back to take another sip of his coffee.
"I would like to add on to the baby news a little." Bucky said carefully. "Natasha, Clint, and I talked and... eventually we're gonna adopt." He said with a small smile.
. They're my family."
Tony rolled his eyes playfully, tugging the boxers down to kiss lightly at Steve's cock.
"It was during high school." Clint explained. "I started trying to stick people together based on their body language and actions around each other. Everyone relationship that I put together is still going strong today, and the name stuck. There is a lot a person can say without words, and around this Tony kid you are saying A LOT.".
Clint snorted, not at all surprised at Tony's formalities, "Yeah, yeah, Stark. Now you can rub it in Howie's face, yeah? Now go help Nat get your stuff while I talk to the big guy."
"Yeah, you can curl up to me, bambi," Tony teased, kissing him back, "Pizza sounds amazing, dearie."
He brushed his fingers through Steve's hair, sighing softly.
Peter quickly sat down at an open table, stuffing his face with the cold treat.
Bruce intently looked at Tony.
Stay in suspense, my lovelies~
for Steve, like it was never an inconvenience for him. But Steve knew it had to be. From some of the talks the engineer (one of the things Tony explained he did for a job) had with the woman that had came to the mansion when Steve first arrived, he had gathered that Tony was a
"Thank you." He hummed, rolling his eyes at the shirtless comment. "Let’s see, so far I have been a schoolgirl, am going to be an officer, and now you want a lumberjack. Anything else you want on the list?" He asked with a laugh.
"Can't have that," he hummed, grabbing a cockring, "Now honey, I know you don't like these, but you
"I think he sees us doing it, and Peter, and he wants to do it too," Tony laughed, sitting down with Sammy in his lap, "He'd got about a month before he'll start to crawl, then we'll have to reinforce everything and everything with corners."
Steve sauntered back over to the bed with his belt in hand, cracking it in his hands as he looked at Tony.
"I'm so excited to go skinny dipping, you have
." Tony was practically hopping by the time they got to the shop, picking out a loaf of bread and a blueberry scone before going back out to meet Steve. "Ready?"
"You're so fucking good Steve, such a pretty mouth--" Tony managed to last a few more seconds till he fell over the edge, moaning deeply as he came down Steve's throat.
"Sorry. Haven't really looked at anyone like this in a long while. Trying to use
He leaned over and kissed Steve again, only pulling back to grab a notepad and pencil from his side drawer.
laughed. He sounds just like you."
Steve nodded again, slowly standing up to get out of the tub and dry off. He leaned against Tony for a moment, kissing his cheek. "Then we'll go see the house?" He asked softly.
"Steve, looking like that, you are gonna be the death of me one of these days." Tony nearly moaned, crawling up on the bed in front of the blond and looking the other over. The nervous flush clearly ran down Steve's body, almost all the way down to his toes.
"Um...." Steve said a bit nervously. "If you think you can handle it, munchkin. But we'll have you do it on the couch, okay? Just in case." He explained.
"Peter Parker used to be an ordinary, average teenager. Until one day, on a school field trip to a genetics laboratory, he was bitten by a radioactive spider that had snuck loose." He began.
"Shhh, honey," Tony soothed, relief blooming in his chest, "He didn't know, bubby. It probably freaked him out to see doodles on the walls." He glanced over at Bucky, grateful to see him nod. "See? Everything's okay, sweetheart, no need to cry."
"We'll have to tell Peter we have to go take care of some business before we leave so he doesn't freak out when it’s just Pepper here."
Peter giggled, skipping along as they headed to the checkout.
"When my fever breaks, will you lay with me?" He asked softly. "I shouldn't be contagious then if I am now."
"You sure can, can't ya?" Steve grinned, kissing Tony back before heading back to the oven to pull the pizza out. "Once you can eat without getting
"Back up a second." Tony interrupted for a moment. "Did you just admit to a handsome guy- i.e. me- being apart of the reason you went to a sea witch to become human?"
Tearing cloth was heard, followed by a strangled scream and a gruesome sound of skin against skin, lasting much longer than it probably should have. As soon as it stopped, the video camera was shoved in a pocket, ending the video and audio.
Steve did nothing but pant and nod in agreement, taking a moment before rolling off of Tony with a huff of breath. His nerves twitched, still feeling his high.
"I've always wanted to try these," he laughed, "Look, there's other flavors--"
Steve turned to look behind him with a small smile.
Peter sniffled and shook his head, staring up at Steve. "Why?" he asked, lip trembling.
Steve hummed in agreement, looking out the window and watching the scenery a bit.
"Well that's very good Peter. That takes a strong will. Especially with your Daddy and Papa." Natasha pointed out with a smirk, making Steve's cheeks go red again.
Tony quickly finished up his breakfast and sat back with a happy sigh, giving Steve a lazy smile.
Sammy whined up at Peter, but grabbed at his ankles again, slowly tugging himself up into a standing position. Peter grinned and held Sammy for a moment, then let go, backing away.
"She said deh last soulmates was born in deh '90s," Peter explained, "New soulmates aren't bein' born."
"This is Bucky Bear. He was my most special toy since before I was your age." He explained. "I thought I had lost him. So to have him again is very special to me, squirt."
. It’s my fault, anyway. I was determined." Steve said softly, cupping Tony's face. "I'm fine. Are you okay?"
Steve rolled his eyes playfully, smirking back at Tony. "You are relentless, huh? There are subtler ways to ask for a blow job, y'know?"
"I know, right? The way that they use their ingredients really makes it great," Steve hummed into his slice, "And I eat more because I burn it all off quicker, energy-wise. And someone has been helping me burn off more energy here lately." He smirked, splitting a breadstick and offering half to Tony.
"I'd have to break the disk if you did," Tony chuckled, kissing Steve's cheek.
He grinned, smooching the top of Sammy's head before passing him up to Steve, taking his bowl of cereal.
, what a vision that was.
"Well, babe, it's gonna be a hell of a ride, but I'm pretty much as—as this it gets," Tony replied weakly, pulling back only to pack up the medical kit and pull his sweats back on, "I'm difficult." He shrugged helplessly, staring at the ground.
"That was an accident, daddy." Steve replied, giving Peter one more smooch before placing him back on the couch. "But be good, okay? And help keep an eye on your brother and your daddy."
"What happened to just cuddling, huh?" Steve said back, raising a brow playfully.
"If I did, I wouldn't be able to leave," Tony snorted, "and I want to save my appetite. We can stop in on the way back, but there's no way in hell I can go in there now."
"Fire...?" The brunet said softly as he made it to the kitchen and stopped in his tracks, the sight in front of him a lot less terrifying than he thought the situation would be.
"All buckled up and ready to go, kiddos." Steve grinned, kissing the tip of Sammy's nose before shutting the door and packing the bag in the trunk.
"You wanna sit, kiddo? I can read to you, if you want," Tony asked, petting Peter's hair.
"No need to be upset, munchkin." Steve said calmly, petting Peter's hair with one hand and playing with Sammy's fingers with the other. "You did okay, buddy."
Tony nodded.
"He does. Rather fluently, actually." Steve stated with a nod. "He tried to teach me a little, but he just ended up confusing me." He said with a quick chuckle.
"Yup. Sure have, man." came the voice of the said owl, but instead a guy in a purple shirt and covered in bandages showed up out of nowhere and stopped beside Tony.
"Where would we even
"Don't worry, I plan to fatten him up a bit. Get meat on them bones." Tony chuckled flatly. "But I would like you to help us build him a style. Poor thing's never been made over."
"Ah. I see." He chuckled warmly.
"If you sing that song, you both are getting put in time out with no dessert," Tony interrupted, shooting Steve a glance, "Also, you and I have talked about
Steve smiled softly at that. "You guys are soulmates, too." He asked as a statement, not really ever realizing it.
"It'd be nice if she could, wouldn't it?" He said quietly. "She's an angel, though. So she can't really help in that way anymore."
"Okay. Okay, I need--phone, coffee, shower, you showering with me in case I fall over, ah, a blanket, and Clint should be over if he texted me--"
"Hmph." Tony huffed and turned away from Steve's stomach, pouting. "Meanie, and I'm
"I dunno if I should, you being bad but you enjoying this." He purred, going to slick up his fingers and warm the lube up before tracing it lightly against Tony's entrance. "I think I should tease you a little--".
Steve returned the handshake and introduction with one of his own.
, and he and Nat have taken care of me for much longer," Tony grit out, swallowing the aspirin without touching the water.
Peter shifted uncomfortably before squealing and bolting up for his room, not surprised that he got swooped up.
"Love you," he murmured, running his hands up Steve's chest to tug his shirt off.
"Anything, babe," Tony murmured, "Toy Story? A Bug's Life? Ooh, we haven't seen The Little Mermaid in a while." He patted Steve's hands to unwrap so he could stand, grabbing his quilt from the end of the bed.
The blond stood carefully with a grunt to shut off the water. "Now let’s get dried and dressed and go get out babies."
“Morning. I figured you might be really hungry after changing last night, so I made sure to make plenty.” Bruce offered with a soft smile, heading towards the chamber with plates. “There’s some for you too, Tony. I figured we’d all eat while I look over last night’s data and see if we can prep for tonight as well based on the data.”
"Just remember to do that only when we've stopped the car." Steve grinned, offering up his hands to hold as they headed into the hospital.
"Love you too, peanut," Tony hummed, quietly leaving the room and shutting the door behind him.
Tony laughed, putting a hand on his face as he passed his phone to Steve, showing him Peter's browsing history.
"Because, you look kind of upset.
Tony smooched Peter's cheek, ruffling his hair before returning to his own schematics done in paint.
"Yeah baby, that's the drip bag, it's what helping keep your allergy away," Tony murmured, running his thumb over the boy's hand reassuringly, "A few hours and we'll be able to take it out, get you bandaged up and go home, okay? We can all sleep in Papa's and my bed tonight, extra special."
"Not dat I can think of at the moment..." Peter said innocently. "Is there something you think I'm s'posed to tell you?"
Tony reached out to grab at Steve's shirt, burying his face in the familiar warmth of the cashmere sweater.
was written on his collarbones, which probably meant his soulmate was a street worker. Which, inevitably, got him kicked out of the house.
"Meanie," Tony muttered, turning his face away from Steve, "No kisses for you. You're a big meanie."
"Please, I said 'm sorry," Tony tried again, whining.
"It's doesn't, but you'd look sexy," Tony muttered, "Now shut up and help me get these pajamas off you."
"Hey Cap!" he shivered out. "What are you doing out here in Tennessee?".
Steve let out another chuckle before answering.
This didn't cut it. This just
"Up?" Peter asked, kicking his legs.
"Oh yeah?" Steve smirked back, nuzzling against Tony's ear. "Do you like to be played with, Tony?" He whispered against the man's ear before pulling away with a soft laugh.
"Go 'way!" He called, slightly teary at being caught.
"What's wrong, Tony?" He asked softly. "I mean other than your injury. Knowing you, I know that's not what this is about, babe."
Peter shrugged silently in response. "I wuz in ma bed dis mornin'." He whispered, seeing Tony still asleep.
"Mmp--!"
"Maybe. That's only one suggestion, though. I'll need you to work your magic to get us in to the morgue so we can see the body," Tony continued, fiddling with his pipe as he put his hand on his hip, "Think you could get the corner to sneak us in? If not, I'm sure we could get Clinton from the Yard to get us in. He owes me a few, anyway."
Tony resisted the urge to chuckle at that last statement. The whole experience was something Steve really wanted, and even though he had only known the merman a short time, Tony wanted to give him everything.
"I know you do, baby, but you shouldn't run around nakey anyway, even if it’s just Papa and I," Tony chuckled, scooping Pete up and setting him on his hip to take him downstairs.
"How long does it take to drive to the house?" He asked curiously, biting into his toast.
Rhodey then turned to Steve. "This is where you and all the others are going to come into play. You all have to continually give him that assurance of 'you do not have to do this by yourself. We are here to help you.' And if you already are doing that, then you keep it up until Tony feels it has finally clicked."
"We're so sorry, kid." Nat said softly, genuine sympathy in her voice.
Tony hummed quietly, giving Steve a fond look.
Peter took a look at the boots and gasped in excitement.
He was quiet for a second before he felt the tremors come on again, and he burst into tears, clinging to Steve.
"Mmm, I always have fun," Tony murmured, spreading his hands over Steve's chest, "Lots of fun."
Peter nodded, taking Steve's hand as they walked down to the kitchen. He stood on his tiptoes to get the peanut butter from the fridge, grunting as he carried it over to the counter.
Tony plucked Peter's and his aprons off the rack, tying the little one around Peter before donning his own.
"You are so old fashioned. Roll in the hay?" Tony snorted, smooching Steve again before getting up, "Yes, yes. A few things. C'mon."
He smiled triumphantly, turning his head to look at Steve.
Tony gaped at the clearly graphic drawings on the walls, jaw open as he started at Clint scrubbing off a particularly large penis. "
"No Russian at the table-- Peter, wash your hands before presents, kid. You're all sticky."
"Fair. This school does allow the occasional physical punishment in the form of a spanking," he explained, "It would be over fairly quickly, your slate would be wiped and we'll go back to our normal routine."
"That's why we are going to try and pull you away from that mentality. That's the only way we are going to be able to help."
"Right, right. We can't forget Bruce's gifts." Steve hummed as he nuzzled Tony's neck. "They'll just add to our 'fucking fantastic' time." He repeated with a chuckle.
. He's texting Nat, and apparently he wants tomorrow night. I can't tell you why, though."
Steve laid Peter down softly in the bed, tucking him in and then going to clean his trash can out.
"Is this why you wanted my psychology papers on positive reinforcement?" Tony accused, watching the boy flush, "God, Pete, that's-- that's
With a happy sigh, Tony stroked Steve's hair till the blond fell asleep. He smiled and curled up as tightly as he could, easily drifting off to a light snooze.
"Right." Peter said with a nod. "Don't worry, Daddy! I figured it aaaaall out 'n dere is no messes. Pwomise."
Tony thought that he probably should go, despite the whole action going against his original plan. As much as Tony tried to avoid Steve, he felt he needed to go see what Steve had worked so hard on for the past couple months. Also maybe to give Steve an explanation and a proper goodbye. Tony looked to see what time it was.
"But--" Tony shifted uncomfortably, shrugging.
In their bedroom's en suite, Tony put his head in his hands, not quite sure if the new guilt he was feeling was any better. With a wince, he stood to clean up any evidence, stowing the razor away before shuffling to bed, forgetting to bandage himself up.
"Nothin' wrong with sentiment, baby. It’s a good thing." He rubbed Tony's back gently before breaking the hug. "I'll go over and get dressed, then we can go."
Tony scrabbled back from Steve, looking up bleary eyed before bursting into laughter.
"Bubba."
"He's just really happy, Peter. He's dangerous when he is happy." Steve joked with a warm chuckle.
"Steve-- Steve, not yet," Tony groaned, tugging him off, "Don't wanna come yet, wanna be in you first."
He clambered off all them and stretched, grabbing all of them to drag them up to the guest room.
"Mhm, remind me of that when you leave for Che Stark," Bucky hummed, trying not to grin at the look on Tony's face, "You hungry, Pete?"
Tony grinned, tugging Steve towards theatre 5. Following behind Tony, Steve helped him pick seats in a row near the middle. Steve checked to make sure his phone was on vibrate before slipping it back into his pocket and taking Tony's hand again. Tony turned his phone off completely, bumping shoulders with Steve before curling up in his seat, resting his head on Steve's shoulder.
"Okay." Steve said simply. "I was just teasing. But if it...affects you like that, then I won't say it." He smiled softly, kissing Tony's hand quickly. "Promise."
Tony tiptoed upstairs after he'd cleaned up the kitchen and flicked off the lights, smiling softly at his baby boy before heading to bed. He collapsed on his side, snuggling up to his pillow.
"Mmm. I got it."
"They're donuts, Tony. It’s not too bad once in a while." Steve grinned as he ruffled Peter's hair. "Plus he was extra, extra good for his Auntie and Uncles. He earned it."
?" Tony was sure his jaw dropped to his chest. "Honey, you are absolutely
He faltered for a moment, chest thrumming in his chest. Panic seized him at Steve's silence, fearing he'd gone too far.
Steve glanced over at Tony, smirking slightly.
," Tony whined, sucking a hickey onto Steve's neck, "Babe..."
"M'sowwy," He cried, sitting under the hot spray, "I didn' m-mean tuh--"
"Alright. But no sex like that for at least a week so we can know you're okay." He insisted.
Tony pushed away, leaving the arms of a confused super soldier.
"Uhh--"
The blonde did a spit take with his tea, blue eyes wide at the brunette.
Steve's pace started to quicken, hand pumping himself and hips thrusting upwards to meet the strokes. More frequent moans of want started to escape Steve's lips, the sounds themselves bringing Tony along in the want of touch.
Steve leaned up quickly, looking to Tony apologetically. "I’m sorry. I forget that I'm bigger, sometimes," He admitted, "Want me to grab us towels?"
"Oh my god," Tony snorted, laughing into Steve's chest, "You--Nope. I have nothing to say, otherwise I'll laugh too hard."
"Sowwy," Peter mouthed around his last bite, swallowing it with his juice, "Can I go put the movie in?"
Tony laughed, nearly stumbling at the shove, "Watch your strength there, bambi. Yeah, yes, next foundation benefit we'll dance, I mean-- are you ready for that?"
"Awe, he's just like you, Stevie," Tony teased.
"Otay." Peter wiggled to be set down, sitting down outside the door.
Steve started walking towards Tony, reaching towards him. Steve grabbed onto the ARC Reactor in Tony's chest. Tony tried to fight back and keep Steve away from it, but he couldn't move. He was cold, frozen in place.
He sighed happily, content to fall asleep in Steve's arms.
Clint howled in laughter from the hallway, causing Tony to blush slightly.
"Sorry, sorry..." Steve repeated, feeling it had happened all a bit too soon.
Tony gasped. "You're gonna deny me sex?
He dissolved into wordless noises, tugging up on Steve's hair so he could buck up into the blond's mouth. Steve followed with the tugs, giving a deep hum when he started to feel Tony nudging at the back of his throat. He massaged Tony in time with his mouth, starting to bob. The blond managed to take the other down until dark tufts of hair brushed against the tip of his nose.
"Experiments? Do you wanna learn about the suit?" Tony chattered, hugging the boy close as he skipped down to the lab, "Or we can work on your spiderman suit. Maybe we'll have it ready in time for Halloween!"
"Fella? Really? You're such an old man," Tony snorted, "Yeah, yeah. A few things. Dunno if you'll like them, but they're there." He shrugged, leaning down to kiss the top of Steve's head. "I mean, I'm totally not opposed to using them
Steve leaned up and kissed the man's lips gently, grinning up at Tony. "You must really like me in panties, huh?" He asked, raising a brow.
"All right, Aqua Man. Scoot over. I'm coming in." Tony grumbled fondly, heading towards the bed and crawling under the sheets. The blond smiled back at him, huddling up close once Tony was settled underneath with him. "Hang on, turn around. This might be more comfortable..."
"Tony..." Steve said worriedly, "What's wrong?"
He bit his lip shyly, waiting for Steve's command. Steve grinned at him, walking closer to Tony and playing with the waistband of Tony's pants.
"You are very adept at teasing, Mr. Stark." Steve murmured, looking at Tony and leaning with the touch. "Almost as good as you are with sleuthing."
Bruce squeezed Tony's hand, smiling at the tiny squeeze back.
get over how good you are with your mouth," he moaned softly, tugging on Steve's hair.
"You didn't fail as a parent, sweetheart. You were being firm but fair, and that's what he needed." He said softly. "It was going to happen eventually. Otherwise he'd be a terror. I... I felt the same. When I was dealing with him and the paint. I thought he'd hate me for it..."
Tony looked stunned, too bewildered to really say anything.
"What exactly was it that exploded, Peter? No one got hurt, did they?".
"We could take one to have as a spare if something happens to yours or my bike." He offered. "Donating the rest would be nice, though."
"For however long it takes your brother to come out." Steve said with a chuckle. "So it'll be a while, bubba."
He shivered under Steve's touch, trying to ignore the roll in his abdomen.
He took up residence on his favorite spot on the couch, grabbing the blanket off the back and wrapping it around himself. Tony glanced over with a fond smile, secretly pulling out his phone to snap a few pictures before returning to his work.
"I'm sure your pop won't mind a sandwich for a light lunch." Bucky shrugged. "As long as you eat the dinner, he'll be glad."
"Ah-- I can see why ya like 'ta do this. Feels good--" He praised, a bit of his accent coming through.
Steve hummed in thought, a soft smile on his lips from the kiss. "Mmm... Sure. We can have waffles. Just gotta get the waffle iron going, okay?" He explained as he sat Peter in his chair. "You wanna help me make the mix?"
Despite all the aggression being thrown around at the moment, Steve kept his voice low and quiet.
"I love you, too." Steve smile gently, letting Tony curl up into him and rubbing the man's back gently. "See? These are the things we can talk about like this.". He hummed sweetly.
"He's, what, two days old? He's fine." Clint scoffed, looking at the baby.
"Non posso esprimere quanto ti amo, Steve," Tony panted, still keeping a slow pace, "la mia anima gemella, il mio vero amore, un marito di essere e un protettore e
Peter looked up and over at his fathers, giggling to see Tony nearly asleep. "Daddy's always sleepy, huh Papa?"
"Mom'll let you have a swing. If he's drunk, we'll definitely let you."
Steve whined softly from the hit, but mewled as Tony kissed and soothed the mark. He felt another smack, a small moan escaping his lips then.
"No. I mean, yes they are sensitive for merfolk, but that's not why it feels good." The man clarified. "I meant your touch, specifically. Its gentle and soft, but inquisitive; careful not to overstep or poke and prod. Its soothing and... tender. It feels so good..."
Steve woke next later in the morning, bleary eyed and arms still wrapped around Tony. He tried to keep still, allowing Tony to continue to sleep soundly. Tony yawned around ten, slowly blinking as he woke up.
"That might be a downside, but we'll get used to it. No stinky diaper is going to stop us." Steve chuckled. "And fussy mother hens can be baby obsessed, too. I keep on imagining what'll be like, and I really shouldn't until the baby is actually existent, but I can't help it."
"I'm planning the honeymoon," Tony replied immediately, "I know where we're going, but--you have a passport? We'll get you one if you don't have one. I'll take two weeks off, Pep'll probably want me to not work anyway--" Tony babbled on, a huge grin on his face.
"That's no excuse to be having sex at your age, Steven," Tony replied, watching his ass turn from a pink to a dark red, "That's-- I cannot believe this."
"You heard me, bud? Didn't mean to wake you," Tony sniffled, letting his tears drip into Peter's hair, "You should go back t'your own bed, sweetie."
"Don't worry, I will," he teased, "Don't wanna have gross baby germs all over me."
Peter looked up from his doodling place at the table, glancing at the small flute of frizzy drink.
"Shhh, don't apologize, m'own fault," Tony huffed a laugh, "Yeah, I think so."
"Yeah, yeah, mother hen," Tony grunted, putting his cold nose on Steve's chest. He sighed happily, easily sleeping away most of the morning. Yawning, he stretched, confused as to why the bed was cold. "Steve?" He slurred, poking one eye open.
"Just a minute, wiggle worm." he hummed, changing Sammy's diaper and onesie, getting him all clean and fresh.
"I know where they are! Thanks, Papa!" He shouted, startling Sammy as he ran off.
Tony winked, climbed out of the car and popped the trunk, grabbing his suitcase and the (slightly) smaller sleek suitcase.
"That could be helpful. Thank you, Tony." Bucky answered back, chuckling at Peter's reaction.
"We just bought a house!" Steve exclaimed, pick Tony in a hug and spinning him around. When he set Tony down, he cupped his face and brought him into a deep kiss happily.
Tony flushed more, tugging his hand back to put in his lap.
"I was a perfect lil baby," he repeated quietly.
'Thank you, Tony. This is brilliant. It about killed me not being able to say anything.' Steve said with a grateful sigh. 'I mean, I would've endured, since it was my decision to trade my voice... but I am glad I have a second chance so I can communicate with you.' He finished happily.
"Sorry," Tony croaked weakly, laughing quietly, "Not how I envisioned our first night."
Sorry if this chapter seems short. It runs parallel with the next chapter, as to even out the length with perspectives
"Pete? Can Sammy and I come visit?" Steve called. "Sammy wants to spend time with you."
"Thank you guys, again. We'll talk to you soon." Steve called with a smile, heading out to the car and getting Sammy settled in his seat.
"Ah--"
"That's my good boy," Tony praised, hugging him tightly, "Take care of Samwich, and I'll see you tomorrow morning, okay?"
"Underwear
Tony worked fast, considering Bucky only lived a few blocks down. He made sure lube and condoms were in each nightstand and desk drawer, that the bed was made and the desk clean--
He paused.
Peter held his nose and closed his eyes tight as the water poured, sputtering his lips with a giggle when water fell on his face. He cracked his eyes back open when he felt hands in his hair and scrubbing. The boy reached his hand up and made an almost grabby motion to try and help scrub.
"Noh held. Ev'ybody needs t'be held. M'too old for silly," Peter announced, flipping to the next page of his book, "S'a dumb word."
“Bucky!” Steve nearly whined, groaning as he covered himself fully in his blanket. “They didn’t have to know about that, y’know. You jerk.”
," he whined again.
"Doctor Rogers, Stark," Natalia greeted, "I would shake your hand, but as you can see, I'm up to my elbows in bile."
"Yes, hello, little squirt," Tony chuckled, ruffling the boy's hair.
Tony nodded, squeezing his hand back. "We can talk more tonight, er,
bad."
TW: none
"God, I love you," Tony breathed, putting his hands on Steve's hips, "I love you so much--"
"I won't kill you, anyway." Steve hummed, filling in the lines of Tony's shape. "Just think of it like a coloring book and you should be fine. You're just filling it in." He grinned.
He took a second to adjust, tightening his grip on the curls at the nape of Steve's neck.
"Hey bambi, you want breakfast?" Tony asked, leaning down to smooch Peter's head.
Tony rolled his eyes, happy to drink down the rest of his coffee with a happy sigh.
Tony laughed, leaning over to smooch Steve's forehead. "I don't mind if they're the end of us," he mumbled, trying to put on a brave face, "It's worth it. They're worth it."
He stopped as he saw the box in the toe, blush on his cheeks as he set his stocking aside.
Bruce lightly shook his head at Tony's naïveté.
"Where were you today, exactly?"
Steve hugged him close again, shushing Tony softly. "Slow down. Just breathe Tony, and take everything a step at a time, sweetheart. I'll go get your phone and make some coffee, okay?"
"Oh! Well, hello little sprout!" She said a bit surprised, glancing up at Steve. "Is he yours, Steven?" She asked curiously.
"Once you're done, go wait in the car. I'll be out in a few minutes," he hummed, kissing the top of Steve's head while he passed on his way to the stairs.
intended."
"I'll say." Steve panted, limbs twitching as he lay and fell from his high. He turned and left lazy kisses across Tony's face. "That went a different direction than I thought it would. In a great way, wow."
"Didja find what you were looking for?"
"Oh man, I did forget. Thanks JARVIS.".
He grinned, leaning up to peck Steve's lips.
"I'm sorry. I can't believe I hurt you like that."
"I'll be upstairs, call me when dinner's ready," he muttered, escaping again.
Steve's breath was shaky, a couple tears slipping out against his wishes. "Daddy would be so heartbroken especially if you felt unloved by him..."
charming. Looks like we both got lucky, huh?"
"Right. Sorry, kiddo, Papa and I will try to keep to ourselves," Tony grinned, winking at Steve, which earned another groan of disapproval from Peter.
“Fuck yes," Tony gasped, spreading his legs just a little more, "Always loose for you, baby, m'such a slut f'your cock--"
"Now Peter, you have a bedtime for a reason. Boys your age, big or little need rest to help them grow and be healthy." Steve said calmly, rubbing Peter's back. "As you get older, then you get to stay up later. But right now is bedtime, bubba."
"Ya goof. You are a big goof." He sighed gently. "When I feel like moving again, I' putting it out."
Tony wrapped an arm around Steve and waved till they rounded the corner, then started to tug on Steve's shirt toward the house. "Steeeve," Tony hummed, "Stevieeee."
Tony turned around, body rigid and a none too amused expression on his face as he looked back from Steve, to Dodger, then back to Steve.
He sighed softly, lifting up Steve's shirt to kiss at his abdomen.
"I tend to not skirt around my desires, Rogers," Tony replied, voice dropping an octave, "I get to my point. Unless you have objections?"
"Yes, let's invite our friends into our bathtub," Tony snorted, tugging Steve out of the room and down to the first floor, "Down here's the living room and a movie room, kitchen, laundry, the boring stuff."
"I think he's a restless one," Tony murmured, turning his head to the side, "He probably wants to toddle around. It'd do good to wear him out a little."
"After I dragged you here from the hallway," he confirmed, "I'm sorry if the young-thing made you uncomfortable--"
Steve wrapped a towel around himself and grabbed Peter new clothes and socks. He helped the boy slip into his clothes, getting dressed himself before scooping Peter up. Peter clung to Steve as he was brought out to his bedroom, holding his arms out to his Daddy. Tony took the boy from Steve with a gentle sigh, exchanging him for Sammy before sitting down with the boy on his lap.
Tony grinned, hiking up Peter's shirt to blow a raspberry on his tummy.
"Babies are messy..." Peter murmured, staying snuggled up to Tony as Steve walked over and petted the boy's hair.
"Steve, I am so sorry.  I shouldn't have acted like I did, you didn't do anything wrong. I just-- I got into it with my dad, and you how my relationship with him is so I wasn't in the best of moods. At that time I was angry and confused and I--".
"Hmm, you'll have to be more specific, baby." Steve hummed, moving to get at Tony's level. He stroked under the man's chin sweetly, kissing softly at his face. "How do you need me?"
“Three months?!” Tony asked back incredulously “What the hell?! Why is it that anytime we actually need that asshole, he’s away for such extended periods of time? Its a load of bullshit.”
"Daddyyyyy," Pete complained, flecks of dough on his face, "It wasn'
He moaned as he quickened, starting to feel Tony tighten around him.
He huffed softly and brushed the boy's bangs to the side, laying down to cuddle up to him.
"Oh, honey, it's your fever," Tony murmured, petting his hair, "Just gotta wait for it to break, love."
"Lub you Papa," he whispered.
Tony looked to Steve for a brief moment of quiet, and
"I apologize if this is the wrong address," The woman started with an English accent, "but I was told I could find a man by the name of Steve Rogers living here?"
"It would be good to put him there. Or cover him up at least so he's not cold." He hummed.
"Shellfish allergy," he blurted, slightly out of breath, "He-- benadryl--"
Steve grinned proudly, a slight blush on his cheeks as he nodded.
He sighed, reaching up to card his fingers through Steve's hair.
He returned to the kitchen, sidling up behind Steve to kiss between his shoulder blades.
"I was kidding about the coloring books. Unless you really want one." Steve chuckled, looking at Tony's handiwork.
"Only the once, Sir, I promise," Tony lied.
Tony whimpered quietly and let Steve map him, staring down at him with full-blown pupils.
Peter looked particularly offended at that, glancing over at Steve.
"The fiercest of them all." Steve pointed out, moving Peter dramatically. "Faster than a Hammerhead! Fiercer than a Great White! Even Poseidon quivers before him!" He announced.
Tony yelped, quickly dissolving into a loud moan.
Steve smirked up at Tony at the comment, before giving a small yawn. He curled his legs up onto the couch and snuggled up into Tony's side before shutting his eyes sleepily.
He leaned into Steve's arms, protectively rubbing his chest.
"How much would it cost me for the summer?" The merman asked, knowing the summer season would be starting shortly. It seemed the perfect time to explore and enjoy the warmth of the land.
He started to hum softly, swaying them gently to the tune.
Peter pursed his lips and sighed, leaning against Tony's chest.
? I have a better show planned for you sweetheart, but if you still wanna see Ouija, I'm game," Tony chuckled, sliding out of the booth.
Steve looked at Clint defensively.
"Okay then. You and I will watch a movie together after dinner. Whichever one you want to watch, just you and me." Steve smiled, petting softly at Peter's hair.
"Daddy yes," Tony laughed, smooching the top of Peter's head, "I love you, honey. Very much."
"You love it, Rogers," Tony laughed, smiling happily at the room, "The en suite is amazing, huge jet tub. Could fit us and other people."
Peter scrunched his nose at the poke, but eventually gave in with a sigh. "Otay, I guess." He grumbled softly, resting his head on Steve's shoulder.
Tony was already hard at work at his table, noise-canceling headphones slipped over his ears so he could concentrate on the motherboard in front of him; a few curses escaped his lips when he accidentally burned his fingertips, but he didn't bother to go put them under cold water, opting to work himself out instead.
As the door closed, the blonde felt a light blush fill his cheeks.
He frowned, flicking an eyebrow up as he looked at Steve, opening his mouth as soon as the phone rang.
"'M not horrible. You're just adorable when you laugh." Steve grinned, settling himself above Tony. He leaned down and kissed Tony's lips sweetly, a big grin on his face. "You're actually adorable just being you, but whatever."
"You're so cute, baby," He hummed, poking Peter's button nose.
"Exactly. He always knows." Steve agreed, wiping some sauce off of Peter's face. "So you gotta be sure to sleep through the night."
“Quite the sniffer, Steve.” Natasha chuckled, tilting her head as she thought for a moment. “Does that mean you can smell us? Is all of us here overloading your sense of smell?”
Steve ate with them, giving a soft sigh as he relaxed. This was a good difference to the tensions of not even an hour ago.
"Ooo, an artist. Did you ask him to draw him like one of his French girls, yet?" She grinned.
Peter watched as Tony headed away, turning back to look at Steve. "How come Daddy wen' go work?"
"But you don't have to do this alone. Never will have to. I'll be there for you, always. I made that promise, remember?" Steve smiled softly, kissing Tony's knuckles lightly.
"I dunno, if I were him and could get away from my parents to a place I never got in trouble..." Tony harrumphed, dancing his fingers down Steve's chest.
"Okay. We have everything and you know the room number and all that, right? So let’s go." He said anxiously as they started to back out of the driveway.
It was quiet in the vehicle the first few minutes on the way home before Steve finally spoke.
"Mhm, squirt here's never getting paint ever again, but other than that," Tony drawled, "He's been good."
All Tony could do was whimper, only lasting a few more seconds before coming in Steve's hand, completely coating it, his chest and the bed in white stripes.
"I highly disagree with most of that, but I don't feel like arguing about it." Steve chuckled, smooching Tony's cheek. "He is a mini you. Just as cute, too."
"Am I... Am I really getting that much bigger that it’s noticeable?" He asked softly.
With that, he stomped out of the building, somehow managing to drag Steve behind him. Steve glanced back once more before they exited, seeing Eugene's face start to turn red.
He brushed past Bucky to find Clint, not surprised that Natasha took his bag while he melted into the man's arms.
"Better take yours while you can, Peter. You know Daddy and I love cookies." Steve chuckled, eyeing Peter's hand. "We might gobble up all the cookies, even the one in your hand!" He said, playfully mouthing at Peter's fingers making "Om Nom Nom!" noises.
The bot whirred over at its name, nudging Tony with his claw.
With that, she motioned her head in a specific direction and left.
"Taste good? Not too cold?"
"He even helped take care of Sammy and helped him crawl around a bit." The blond continued as he bounced Peter on his lap. "Pete's being a great big brother."
Sorry its taken a bit to update. I am making this up as I go with only a few major points that I actually have in mind of using, so I have to have time to think this all up.
He scooted down to between Steve's knees, quickly slicking up his fingers before prodding at his entrance, slipping one in.
He walked over to Steve's front, leaning down to smooch his cheek. Steve smooched back softly before Tony headed back again.
baby."
"Yeah, he is. He's brilliant. So many degrees in things I couldn't even imagine..."
He raised an eyebrow at Steve, a quirky smile on his lips. Steve rolled his eyes with a grin, continuing to eat.
didn't know how much you were hiding, Rogers," he murmured.
"I suppose, but they are just rough sketches. Most of my better work is all back at my dorm or in the studio.".
Sammy noised at him and put his hands on his face, eyes wide as he played with Tony's beard.
The girl's face turned into a glare.
"Mhm. Watch when we go for walks," Tony smiled, "He holds my hand tighter whenever a lady walks by and looks at me. He's very protective."
"Tony--" Steve sighed, heading after Tony. He lifted up the end of the covers, looking at the man. "What're you
Tony waved a hand at the other chair set up across the desk.
"Sorry, squeakers, Papa's eyes are the only ones that work on me," Tony sing-songed.
!" Peter yelled indignantly, smacking his little fists, "M'jus'
"Well then, that dumb smile you had makes perfect sense~".
He gave Steve a quick smile, a tiny yawn on his lips as he worked.
"It’s not that. I love seeing you and looking at you when we make love. I just don't like seeing myself." He murmured back. "I want my attention to be on you. No distractions, love."
"That didn't hurt and you know it," Tony laughed, rocking back on Steve's lap, "You like it."
"Who is it?" He eventually asked.
be old before he would be." He assured.
Steve's eyes followed Tony as he left, giving a soft sigh before turning back to Peter.
Tony snorted at that, shooing Steve off.
"I dunno. You've become very responsible here lately." Steve hummed, hugging Tony warmly. "You're grown up." He teased lightly, stealing a kiss.
"Thank yoooou," Tony sing-songed, nuzzling into Steve's chest, "And for the record, I have sensitive eyes. I do
Steve smiled to himself as Tony travelled up the stairs, finishing up his cup and collecting his wallet and keys as he headed towards the car. Tony rifled through his desk, checking for anything he might have missed; some things he needed to replace anyway, but it all looked alright.  He grabbed his wallet and jogged back downstairs, smiling to see Steve waiting for him in the passenger seat.
"It's cold," he warned, gently pushing it in up to the first bulb.
"I've always wanted you to use these on me," he murmured, "Or a hairbrush. God, just
Steve twisted the reactor and pulled it out of Tony's chest, far enough that it was only attached by its wire. Tony just stared back at Steve's grim expression, watching as the blonde held his lifeline is his hands.
He shrugged again.
? Offended." Tony grinned, leaning up to peck Steve's cheek.
