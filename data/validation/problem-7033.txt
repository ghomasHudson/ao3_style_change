“Master Peter, it’s good to see you,” a metallic voice rang out as soon as Peter entered the front Lobby. It was closed, but JARVIS must have seen him from the cameras outside and unlocked the door for him.
spend it with Dad. And if Pops had anything to say against it…then he was just a big fat cotton-headed ninny-muggins.
“The only thing I want you to do is stay with your daughter. Don’t worry about money, don’t worry about how long it will take for a recovery. She, and your family, can stay as long as needed. There are guest bedrooms down the hall, and if you’re hungry, I have a fully stocked kitchen that is for your use. If you have any questions my staff will be happy to help you.” Tony said with a small smile. “We’ll need to have a debriefing with your family about what happened to you daughter…” Tony said as he looked over at Bailey, who still had that smile on her face. “But I’m sure you have an idea. We’ll also need to have a conversation about the future of that baby. But we’ll do that at a later date,” Tony said before moving to the edge of the bed where he patted on of the girl’s feet. “You hanging in there Kiddo?”  Tony asked.
Pepper’s eyes widened and she turned to look back at the screen for a moment. She had suspicions, but Tony only confirmed that. The woman’s eyes scanned Mary’s face on the screen. She looked so happy in that picture. She had a kind smile and her honey brown eyes had a sense of knowing as they stared back. Pepper had never meet this woman, but she knew that she was smart and witty, and would probably give Tony a run for his money.
“Hey Pete,” Bailey said as she took a step towards the boy. “This nice man is going to get us out of here and take us to a safe place. Doesn’t that sound nice,” She said as the boy turned his gaze to the girl. He stared at her silently before looking back to Steve, and then back to Bailey. “He’s a nice man. He won’t hurt us,” Bailey insisted as she continued to walk towards the little boy.
“Of Course,” Dr. Lucas said with a nod. “I will get back to you as soon as soon as I find anything else. In the meantime, I have an optometrist and a pediatrician scheduled to come in tomorrow to look at everyone. We’ll just have to go off of what we find there,” the man said.
“The long hair though? Either grow it out more, or get a haircut. The midway-mullet is not a good look for you, even if you do pull it back,” Tony teased.
“Steve?” they called out, making the other man still. Shit. How had he not recognized that voice when he had said sorry? Honestly, Steve should have ran, but instead, he just stood there, practically shaking as the other man moved around him to get a better look.
“Peter Benjamin Star-Rogers you get in here right now!” Steve called. Oh boy, Peter thought. He used the full name. Tossing himself out of bed, the sickly boy shuffled out of his room and down the hall into the kitchen where he assumed Steve was. And he was correct .
“Congratulations Boss,” FRIDAY said in her cool voice. “You’re the proud father of a bouncing baby boy. Peter and you are a match.”
“I’m well aware Cap,” the inventor said, tilting his head to the side. “So are you from a different dimension, or are you from the future?” Tony asked, wiggling his eyebrows.
“I-I’ll get another one,” Peter muttered quietly as he turned to go back into his bedroom and get dressed to go outside.
“No,” Peter whined as he clung to Tony like a vice. “Stay with me please. Don’t leave me alone,” Peter howled.
Fifty years. It had been fifty years and finally, finally, Steve was returning the time stone. At first he was afraid that his one-hundred-forty-seven-year-old body would not be able to take the jump back in time, but he some now made it intact. The old man appeared on top of a building. It was some sort of rooftop garden, and a bald woman in yellow garb stood a few feet away from him, her arms crossed in front of her.
“We’re in New York, Tony,” The voice said as the fingers of the hand began to run through Tony’s hair. “We’re in Brooklyn, on a side street.It’s June 21st and it’s nine thirty. You’re here with me, you’re husband, and you’re safe,” the voice tried, but Tony just let out another strangled gasp.
He was out cold, still in his rogue Captain America uniform, and Tony couldn’t help but think that it must be very uncomfortable to sleep in something like that. Part of him wanted to wake the captain up, but in the end he only stared at him for a moment before moving on. Steve needed the sleep. If he was uncomfortable, he wouldn't’ be sleeping so hard. Or at least that’s what Tony told himself. Anything to excuse himself from interacting with Steve.
When Peter returned back to the apartment, Steve was already asleep. The apartment felt dark and cold. Where was the warmth that Christmas was supposed to bring? Where was the family? Where were the friends? Where was the
Once the girls were taken care of, he made sure that the younger kids were doing okay. They were in another part of the wing, and it seemed like Rita and her team were taking care of everything. Tony was quick to make a call to Xavier's school for gifted youngsters about the children, and he was told that they would send a representative to him in the following days.
Of Course when Steve agreed to marry Tony, he knew that he would outlive the man. They had talked about it quite frequently. Tony knew that it bothered Steve, but he wanted to make sure that Steve was okay with the idea. So they talked about it quite a bit over the years. And finally, after forty nine years, the day came.
The inventor found himself stumbling in between people as he tried to get out into the open. And even though he was free from the group of people watching the movie, he could still hear the damn explosions. Each boom speeding his heart rate up more and more. So he ran. He wasn’t sure where he was going, but he just had to get somewhere safe. Somewhere where he could be alone and just breathe.
“But I did the same things as the other Steve,” The soldier explained, to which he got no response from Tony. The two sat there for a moment before Steve finally continued. “All I can tell you is I am sorry. I am so so sorry. What I did to you was unacceptable. I lied to you, and it wasn’t to protect you, it was to protect me and Bucky. It was incredibly selfish of me. And you had every right to be upset. I never should have done what I did,” Steve said, pulling Tony away from him so he could get a look. The inventor just blinked back up at him with wet eyes, his brow knitted together in frustration.
“Lila broke her arm last week, so Laura has her hands full with that. But other than that they’re good,” Clint said simply. There was no malice in his voice like the last time the two had spoken on the Raft. In fact it seemed like the good old days. “Sam told me one of those kids down there is yours…” Clint then said, and Tony sucked in a breath.
The inventor didn’t even bother to fold the diaper up, he simply scraped what he could off of Peter and then tossed it away before wiping Peter down with some wipes and setting the boy’s legs down.
“Hey Peter, do you know how to use a toilet?” Tony asked as he reached into the cabinet to get either diapers or pull ups, depending on what Peter said.
That one decision to stay for just the night turned out to last for forty nine years. Forty nine  years of laughter and smiles. Fighting and tears. Apologizing and working together to make things work. Forty nine years of love.
“Well you know what my body is saying?” Tony asked with a chuckle as he took the tie from around his neck and wrapped it around Steve’s, pulling him closer until the two men’s foreheads were touching.
The soldier loved the small curl to Tony’s lips when he smirked; he loved those big brown eyes that were shaded by long, heavy, lashes. Steve loved Tony’s loud laugh and confidence in almost every situation. And the man loved Tony’s true self when he was away from the public eye. He didn’t care what the news tabloids said about Stark. He didn’t care what the man had done in the past.
“Yeah. Okay,” Peter nodded before standing up. “I better get his ham home before Pops starts to worry,” Peter laughed sourly as it turned into a coughing fit.
“What do you mean by that Peter?” Steve asked as he forgot about the plate and sat back down in his seat.
The inventor pulled the sheets over his shoulders and rested his head in the pillow. As he closed his eyes, though, a voice came over the speakers.
“No!” Peter screamed this time as he began to crawl up Tony’s side so he was now almost sitting on his shoulder.  “No, No, No,No, No!”
And in the next second Tony froze. It looked about how he thought it would look, but the smell hit him pretty quick. Tony could only sit there as he tried to keep his composure while trying to suppress the urge to gag.
“Don’t say that,” Tony suddenly said, his face still buried in Steve’s shoulder. “You’ve always been my Steve. Ever since we had that conversation on the bench, you’ve been my Steve,” Tony hiccuped.
“Sam. Clint. West Wing. I need you here now,” Steve called over his com as he began to make his way back towards the small child he had left at the front of the wing. But as he walked, something made him stop.
“What are you looking at Rock-of-Ages?” A voice suddenly said a little too close to Steve for him to be comfortable. Tony was directly behind the brothers, and he was suddenly looking straight at Steve. Their eyes locked for a moment and then Tony was smiling. “Sorry this creep is staring. He doesn’t have any manners,” Tony said, and suddenly he was gone, falling back in place behind the group.
“Right. Yeah.” Peter said as his eyes flashed down to his wallet, and suddenly his stomach dropped. His card. It was gone. He only had a five dollar bill. The rest of his money was all on his card and his card was in his actual coat pocket. He had pulled it out to buy the Nyquil and never put it back. “Shit,” Peter hissed under his breath as he looked up at the woman. “I-I’m so sorry. I-I thought I had my money with me but I guess not. I’m going to have to put the ham back,” Peter said, feeling his ears and neck turn red from embarrassment.
“That’s right, safe,” Bailey said, trying her best to put on a smile. The small boy looked at her hand and then back at Steve before taking the offer. The two wrapped their hands together and Bailey slowly led the boy out of his small prison.
“Okay,” Peter said as a sleepy smile appeared on his face as well. The two layed there in silence for a long moment before Peter’s small voice spoke up again. “G’night daddy,” Peter said, his eyes almost all the way closed. “I love you.”
“Then who will watch Peter?” Tony asked, his eyes now solidly on the boy. He was eating, but it was clear that Peter was listening with interest.
“Oh,” Tony hummed as he raised his brows in surprise. “Since when did Captain America speak Spanish?” Tony asked with a chuckle as he leaned in closer, his breath hot on Steve’s skin.
“Yeah, that’s fine,” Steve said with a nod as Tony turned to leave the hallway. “Actually, I have a  physical file on the kid if you want it.” Steve offered.
As Steve listened, he could only frown. Was this what Tony had been going through in the few weeks that followed Siberia? If Steve would have known this was how Tony was dealing with that event would have chosen an entirely new path.
“What the hell is this place?” Sam asked as he looked at the boy and girl who stood beside Steve. “Who are they?” he then asked, motioning towards the pair. As he spoke the boy became visibly nervous and moved behind Bailey, using her as a shield from the strangers.
Since the day Steve had woken up from the ice, he had been fighting a battle. Sure, he had been out of commission for seventy years, but to him it seemed like he had constantly been on the go. And since the battle of New York, he had kept very busy. In the last eight years he was working for SHIELD, the Avengers, or doing his own thing. So the act of laying low didn’t sit right with him. And all of this started ever since he had rescued his team from the Raft and branded a war-criminal. Steve had to do something.
“Well, well, well, Mr. Rogers, you definitely took your sweet time getting back here, didn’t you,” the Ancient One said. Her tone was harsh, but she had a smile on her face and kindness in her eyes. “Did you have a good life?” she asked, walking closer to Steve as he held out the stone.
“Thank you Tony,” Steve hummed as he took the billionaire's hand. The boat had made it back to shore and the two were stepping off. “I had a great night.”
Peter had never been inside a Target before, and he thought he might have to hunt down the food department, but all of his worries fell away as he entered the sliding doors. The food department was a lot bigger than he imagined and as he walked down the isle of never-ending frozen foods, he wondered if there even was a meat department. It seemed to be like a light and the end of the tunnel, though, as a small shelf space full of brightly wrapped items could be seen. Ham.
“To a degree, yes. Like I said, I looked at the blood sample, and It looks like his DNA has been infused with something else. I’m still trying to figure it out, but it is definitely not found in humans.”
As he walked further and further down the lane, Peter started to wonder if all the hams had been taken, but at the last cooler, there seemed to be a surplus of them. Good.  Peter looked around in the bin for a moment, trying to find the perfect ham. After selecting it, he slowly moved towards the checkout counter. All of this walking was really starting to wear him out.
“Nah,” Clint said, shaking his head. “He left the base as soon as Steve said he was calling you. He wanted me to come with him...but I can’t just leave this place unprotected. Especially with the kids here,” He said, crossing his arms over his chest. “I figured I would hang around till you got here,” he explained.
“Tony?” Steve asked carefully as he rested his hand on the other side of Tony’s shoulder, only to get no response. “Tony?” Steve tried again, a bit louder this time as he squeezed Tony’s shoulder.
The first stone Steve returned was the Aether. It was the most logical, seeing as he had to also return Thor’s hammer. It was one less thing to carry around with him. And as soon as everything was back in place on Asgard, Steve decided to be a little selfish and do something for himself. He had all the time in the world to return the remaining stones. So he went and saw Peggy.
“You did good,” Pepper said with a kind smile as she put a hand on Tony’s back. And from there, they moved on in silence. They passed another room where Tony saw another family through the window. Tony assumed it was the other girls family, but didn’t want to bother them, so he chose to continue on.  As Tony rounded the corner, he saw that there was a figured asleep on a couch that was in a small waiting room next to the wing that Tony was about to enter.  And who could it be but Steve Rogers.
“I know you Steven Stark-Rogers. If there is a will, there is a way for you to find trouble,” Tony joked. “Just be good, m’kay? Remember, I love you.”
“Okay Bailey, we’re going to get you out of here. You hear me?” Steve said as he began to shuffle down the hall with the girl in his grasp. “Just follow me and we’ll get you home.” As soon as they passed another door, though, the girl stopped.
“But Peter. He’s depending on me!” Tony said quickly, trying to desperately get the subject off of Steve. He would rather die than proceed down that road.
“Jesus Fucking Christ!” Tony screamed as his heart leaped up into his throat. The man knew that it was Peter, he absolutely knew. Even a split second before he reacted Tony knew it was likely that it was his child, but his body was on autopilot. As Tony screamed his bolted upright and practically dove over onto the other side of the bed. It was silent as Tony just sat there blinking back at the two eyes that returned his gaze.  “Peter?” he finally stammered.
It was like a switch had been flipped because suddenly Tony was shooting up into a standing position, pulling at his tie as he desperately tried to take in more air. His eyes were wide and desperate and he was making loud gasping noises.
“It’s really good to see you Tony,” Steve said, his blue eyes flickering up to meet Tony’s. The man studied him for a moment longer before speaking.
“Well next time, instead of just standing there and watching me sleep, you can just wake me up. I won’t get mad, okay? And there will be less screaming on my end,” Tony said, a small smile pulling on the edge of his lips.
Hi everyone! Sorry for the long wait for an update. Life has been a bit busy, but I'm still plugging away! I hope you guys enjoy!
The find had put him on edge as he swept his side of the base, and he now began to think that perhaps they would find people that were being held there against their will.
“Allright, it’s settled then,” the inventor hummed before pulling away from Peter slightly so that he wouldn't smother the boy in his sleep. Peter still kept his hand in the same spot on Tony’s chest, but his eyes wandered up to his father’s face, looking for comfort. And that’s exactly what he got.
When she had talked to Tony, it was clear that he was very distressed. Pepper knew how sensitive Tony was with issues like these, and now to be thrusted in one...she couldn’t imagine what he was going through. By the time she pulled into the compound it was almost six o’clock at night, and it was starting to get dark.
“Cars, an air condition unit and... your heart,” Tony admitted as he pressed his head further into Steve’s chest.
Now that Peter wasn’t latched on to him, and Tony knew that everyone was safe, he felt absolutely drained. He wasn’t even sure if he could make it to a shower. Sure he smelt like piss...but he was willing to sacrifice his sheets for a nap.
Honestly, Steve thought he would only stay the night. But the night turned into two nights, and those two nights turned into a week and that week into a month, and after a year of staying with Tony, the genius asked him to marry him.
“I hear ya’!” She laughed. “But it’s almost Christmas. Once Christmas is here everything will be better,” She said with a smile, just waiting for the form of payment from Peter.
“You kind of have to when you’re on that list too,” Clint said drily as he leaned against the wall. “You look well,” He then mentioned, though he could only see the outline of Tony in the dark.
“Peter! It’s good to see you again,” Rita suddenly said as she approached the two. “It seems like Steve gave you the plush I gave him,” Rita said as she stopped and looked over Tony’s shoulder. “Thanks Cap,” the black haired woman said with a smile.
“Unfasten the diaper and lift the child’s legs up. Wipe up as much mess as you can with the diaper before folding it in half and throwing it away. Make sure his bottom does not touch the mat until he is clean. I would suggest having wipes nearby to clean up the rest, boss.” The AI responded.
I'm sorry these chapters are so short. I feel like I should be doing more, but unfortunately I don't have a lot of time to write during the week. And I just get so excited about updating that I cut my plans short. (This chapter was suppose to be double in length. and I got too excited so you're just getting what I wrote so far.)  I'm sure I'll be one of those fics that has like 40 chapters. RIP me. (okay, maybe not 40)  - Anyways, enjoy!!
“Thanks Pepper,” the bearded man said with a tired smile before stepping to the side to let her pass.
Pepper didn’t even know what to say. She had seen Tony in almost every mood and situation, but this was definitely a new one for her. She wasn’t sure how to react.
“I can’t do that to you Tony,” Steve said, shaking his head. “You have only known me for a month in this world. It would be like having a stranger living with you. That’s not fair.”
Steve saw red as he watched the girl fall to the table as the men carelessly left her alone. They were obviously more focused on their own lives and Steve was not going to let them get away. So the man jumped into action, he first grabbed the child and lowered her to the ground so she would not fall from the table before he took off after the three scientists. The first two he outright killed. He had hit them rather hard, and the blow had damaged organs, killing them quickly. The last one, though, he made sure to keep alive. Unfortunately there was a cyanide pill hidden in their molar that they used, and soon, they were dead as well.
“I put in an order when we were on the Jet. I figured our younger guests would like some comfort,” She said and then looked at the other two children. Both were holding dolls. The boy held what looked to be a hulk plushie, and the younger girl was curled around an Ironman doll that was almost as big as her.
“What about Peter?” Tony asked. He tried not to show how hesitantly he had asked, but his voice gave it away.
Even though Tony opted for the faster method of travel, there was still time to think. So many questions were running through his mind. How had someone received the means to make a child that shared his DNA? How old was the kid? Had the kid been experimented on? Was he hurt? Was he functional for his age? And soon Tony was going down another rabbit hole of questions like: Where am I going to keep him? What if he needs major help? Can I even do this? Can I raise a child on my own?
As Steve stayed close to the edges of the room, his eyes landed on Tony who was with a group of SHIELD agents, Thor, and Loki. It looked like some sort of commotion had just happened, as Tony was being helped off the floor. Steve watched as the group conversed for a while, and then suddenly they were walking towards him. Thinking quickly, Steve pressed himself back in a corner, grabbing a pamphlet to hide behind as the group made their way past him. As they did so, Steve’s eyes wandered up to catch a glimpse of the people.
“Of course,” Steve said with a nod and then it was silent as the two men looked anywhere but each other. “Why don’t you come in,” Steve said as he waved his hand, motioning for Tony.
. Do you know what that means?” Steve asked before biting down on his lip, still trying to keep his cool. It took the sick boy a moment, but things seemed to click.
“I think it’s time I face the music and go back to my own time. I’m sorry if I lead you on. I just think-”
“No Pepper,” Tony interrupted. “Steve...He-he called me...he said he found a HYDRA base where they were doing a breeding program and he found a kid with my DNA. I just got the results back and. God. Pepper, he’s my kid,” Tony said, his breathing picking up in speed.
Steve Rogers knew that he was in love with Tony Stark. That much he was sure about. In the past, and the moments leading up to the now, Steve knew that to be truth. He just didn’t know how much he loved the inventor.
,” Steve muttered under his breath as his blue eyes finally flickered up to meet the inventor’s chocolate orbs.
Soon Pepper was at Tony’s bedroom door. She paused at the entrance, not really sure what was going to happen in the following moments, but prepared herself for anything.
“Oh. So you like a firm mattress, huh? Well, we’ll get Pepper to change that so you feel better when you sleep,” Tony said as he began to sit up.
, if they would have never found Peter, HYDRA would have turned him into a deadly tool. He would have been the ultimate weapon. He could have easily infiltrated them and taken them down from the inside.
“You can sleep with me every once in a while, but when you get older, you’ll be too big! You’ll have to sleep in your own bed then.”
Tony was surprised to wake up to sun filtering into the room. Normally he was awake before the sun even came up, or he was asleep when it was already daytime, causing him to use the curtains. This was different though. The room was bright and
“Steve,” Tony muttered as he approached the blonde. “Get some rest. Everyone is safe, you’ve done enough for now.” With that Tony walked out of the med wing and made his way to his private suite.
The fact was that he loved Tony, and the man seemed to have the same feelings for him as well. There had been many conversations that lasted late into the night about their relationship. “Are you sure about this,” was said quite often by either of the men, followed by quick nodding or a small grunt to confirm the question. In fact, they had only been “officially” dating for a little over a week. There were small kisses to the lips and holding hands, but so far that was the extent to how intimate they were together. Tony was willing to go the pace that made Steve feel comfortable.
Different questions kept circulating through Tony’s mind and before he could answer any of them, he found himself outside of a small building on the edge of Washington State. He stared at the building for a minute before removing himself from the suit, only leaving a gauntlet on his right hand for protection. After All, this was a HYDRA base.
“Like I said, it’s no problem. I just want you to get better, okay?” Tony said as he turned to look at everyone else in the room. He now noticed that there were two younger boys asleep in the chairs. Both were in their early teens, if not younger, and Tony figured that they were Bailey’s brothers.
Soooo....this is my first full-blown fic (not just a one-shot) when it comes to the MCU. Go easy on me please! This idea came to me while I was at work, and I'm not sure how it ill pan out...but I thought i would just give it a go.
“Oh! The Captain curses,” Tony said in mock shock, pulling a hand over his mouth before laughing. “Look. We all do shitty things, we’re human. And if I said we’re cool, then we’re cool. So get out there and apologize to future me,” Tony says, a smirk on his face.
“Perhaps I’ll go back myself,” Loki hummed, making Steve’s eyes flicker back up to the trickster. “I’ve been wandering through space and time with the tesseract for quite some time now. I am tired. Life did not go as I thought it might. Perhaps some time at home with the family would do me some good.” Loki chuckled.
“Hey Peter. Is it okay if I hold you?” Steve asked, putting a large hand on the boy’s arm. “Just for a little bit.”
“Now don’t get into any trouble when I’m gone, okay? I’ll haunt you If I hear you’re up to no good,” Tony warned, his voice still soft.
“I-I only speak a little,” Steve stammered in embarrassment as his allowed his hands to feel the fluidity of Tony’s hips as they swayed. “I took up another language after the ice,” Steve explained. “Well, Spanish and French that is.”
“Don’t say that. Not after everything I’ve just done to you. I don’t deserve it,” Steve said, his heart heavy. “I think I came to the wrong time. I honestly should just give up this fantasy I have that we’ll somehow be able to be together. Peggy didn’t work out, why should I have thought this would be different?” Steve huffed, pulling away from Tony.
It honestly looked like a standard hotel room. Two double beds with a nightstand and lamp in the middle and a black couch on the side. One teenage girl slept on one of the beds with a baby girl next to her. The other bed was taken up by a toddler boy who was lazily sprawled out over the bed, making it hard for someone else to easily sleep on it. And then on the couch another teenage girl slept, slumped over the left side of the couch while a little boy slept on the other end, his head resting in her lap.
“I’m not going to lie, that kind of scared me,” Steve laughed nervously as he looked down at his husband, only to realize that something was wrong. Tony was still rigid, his eyes wide as he stared at the space directly in front of him. As more and more explosions ripped across the sky, Steve began to feel Tony trembling beside him, and if he actually paid attention, he could hear the man’s labored breathing.
“Don’t leave me. Please,” Tony said, gripping Steve’s shirt. “Pepper is gone, the team is gone, I’m so alone and I don’t think I’ll get through the night by myself,” Tony said, his voice cracking in desperation.
All thoughts about going home vanished from his mind as Peter pressed on towards the tower.  Tony might be gone for the Holidays, but if he was home, Peter would drop by for a bit before heading home.
“Sure. I know about all of the Avengers,” Peter said with a shrug. “I know about Natasha Romanova and the red room...and a lot more. I know about Dr. Bruce Banner and his work with gamma radiation. And then Tony and his Iron Man suits. I know how they are built and how to shut them down and stuff like that...but that’s only for the old suits.” Peter said in a quiet voice.
“My, my, my. You look a little worse for wear,” the trickster said as he looked Steve up and down. “Having a rough time?” The only thing Steve could think to do was let out a strangled laugh as he took another swig of his drink, almost choking on it.
“But what are you leaving behind?” Peggy asked, her eyes sad. Steve actually stopped then, and took a moment to consider what he would be leaving behind.
Of course Tony left a laundry list of things to do. “Make sure you call the authorities and tell them you’ve found the girls, but don’t tell them who you are. You’re are wanted criminal afterall.”, “Make sure you let the parents know that I will be sending down a private jet so that they can see their girls.” and “ Don’t give them too much information though. We don’t want to freak them out. We can get them caught up when they get here. Just let them know their daughters are alive.”  There was of course more, but Steve had to stop the brunet.
He waited till he was alone before he looked at the file. He waited till he had F.R.I.D.A.Y. running on HYDRA’s system before he opened it. He waited till he was seated before he finally sat down and opened the thing.
Also, thank you all for the lovely comments you have left on here, as well as talking with me on Tumblr, I really appreciate it!!!
And Tony obsessed over it, making sure everything was perfect. From the food they ate to the route the yacht took, to even the kind of blanket they would sit on in the grass while they watched the movie. Everything had to be perfect for Tony’s amazing and wonderful husband.
“You are not the Captain I am familiar with, are you?” Loki pried after a moment of silence. And Steve opened his mouth to tell the trickster off, to tell him to leave him alone, but suddenly Steve was word vomiting all over the place. He had never experienced a time when he didn’t have control over himself, yet here he was, telling his sob story to someone he considered an enemy. Thanos, the time heist, the fact that
“Yeah! I wanna play with Mr. America,” Peter interjected enthusiastically as he slammed his little fists on the table, sending two apple slices a few inches into the air before they landed outside of Peter’s plate.
Tony didn’t know why, but for some reason his heart swelled with admiration. Even though they disagreed about certain things, Clint was a good guy with a good heart. Lately he had always been thinking about Steve’s band of fugitives with a negative outlook, but this put things into perspective.
“Is this seat taken?” A man asked as Steve sat on a bench, looking out over the largest of the reservoirs in the park.  He’d been sketching the water with the buildings looming in the background. And he was too engrossed in his work to really look up at the man, but he wasn’t rude.
“Great. Let’s go.” Tony laughed as he took Steve’s hand and began to lead him out of the room. He was ready to undress his boyfriend and go to town on him. He knew Steve felt the same way. “Are you sure you want to?” Tony then asked as they reached the door.
“You’ll keep looking into his DNA, though, right? Make sure we know what’s inside of him.” Tony prompted.
“Friday, call Pepper,” Tony muttered as he sat up in bed. There was a short wait and then suddenly Pepper’s voice came over the system.
So Steve opted to sitting on the sidelines at an empty table and drink his drink as he watched his boyfriend dance in the mix of the other people. And Steve had to admit, Tony was a damn good dancer. He seemed to be able to dance to every style of music, even when he was tipsy. But nothing could prepare Steve for what was to come.
“Yeah Petey, you can call me dad,” Tony said.  Peter seemed to accept this as a good answer and simply closed his eyes before shifting slightly into a more comfortable position. “Good night...dad,” He muttered.
“If there is anything we can do to repay you. Anything at all. Please, let us know,” Russell interjected, causing Tony to let out a small laugh.
?” Peter asked, motioning towards the TV as he noticed the movie was starting again. It must be TNT’s “continuous Christmas Story programming” that they had every year.  “I love that movie,” Peter then admitted.
“Yeah...he called me a few hours ago. He seemed really upset,” Pepper explained as she looked the man up and down. It had been a long time since she had seen Steve. And honestly, if this were any other time, she might have a few choice words for him. But the woman deemed that this was not in the right moment.  The one thing Pepper noticed, though, was how rough the man looked.  “You look awful Steve,” Pepper muttered. “When was the last time you slept?”
“I’m sure you can Peter. But it’s going to be awfully boring, and you’re going to have to behave so that the adults can talk,” Pepper explained with a kind smile. And even though Pepper had good intentions, Tony couldn’t help but feel put off by that statement. He felt like that was something Howard would have told him. And by God, he wasn’t going to do anything that reminded him of Howard.
Tonight was a little different, though. Tonight Tony had drank a little too much and was feeling anxious. Parties could do that to a person; especially if the mayor was the one hosting.
A heavy sigh escaped Tony’s mouth as he slowly climbed into bed. His aged body popped and cracked as he leaned forward and pulled the covers over him. “Lights,” Tony commanded, and soon he has laying in darkness. And Tony tried to fall asleep, he really did, but the day’s events were still running through his mind.
“-And you can take him anywhere you want. When you get scared you just need to hug him and he will keep you safe with his shield,” Steve explained.
“I’m here alone, and I would like to keep it that way, so please leave,” Steve huffed, turning his attention back to his drink.
“I think we all have,” Tony said as he made his way towards the mouth of the hall “Thanks, Goodnight Pepper.” --  It was only eight thirty in the evening, but Tony was absolutely exhausted. As soon as he put Peter to bed, he was going to crash.
On his days off, Steve would frequent Central Park. It was a nice place to people watch and sketch. It had been such a long time since he’d done anything with art. Steve had only been here for about a month, but it had been the best month he’d had in a long time. He couldn’t get drunk anymore, no matter how hard he tried. Sure he didn’t like it, but it’s better for him—in this month, he was healing.
As Steve was leaving the tower, through one of the side doors, the man stilled, hearing a voice from down the hall. It was Tony’s voice. And even though he knew it would be problematic if he was caught, Steve still followed the voice. Just so he could see Tony again, if only for a moment. See him talking and breathing. Seeing him alive.
“Tony,” Steve huffed. It was obvious that the soldier was hurt by Tony’s words. “You were my world. You still are. I mean, when I came out of the ice, when I woke up, I had no one. Nothing. I was so lost and broken, But then you showed up. And even though we bickered back and forth, you gave me a second chance. You gave me a purpose, somewhere to belong. Tony, you gave me a home,” Steve said, his heart breaking for the millionth time that day. “I love you Tony,” Steve said, his voice cracking. Tony just looked at the blonde for a long moment, his lips pressed in a fine line as a single tear fell from his lashes.
“Will it hurt?” Peter asked, his voice wobbling slightly as he pulled his free arm away from his body and held it out for Tony to take.
Steve let out a heavy breath, not aware that he had even been holding it, before letting out a nervous chuckle. More and more fireworks began to go off in the sky over the river, and Steve did his best not to show that he was shaken up. It did help though, that Tony had jumped at the noise too. Though now that Steve thought about it, the inventor was still sitting pretty rigid in his grasp.
In the golden sunlight Tony could only think of how important Peter had become to him in such a short time. Tony had been in kind of a dark spot in his life...but Peter was like then sunshine. He was there to make it better. Brighter. The elder Stark wished he could stay like that forever, just the two of them sharing that moment. But after a while the little boy’s eyes lazily opened.
A warm feeling was creeping in Tony’s chest and he tried to process his emotions, and it didn’t help that Peter replied with a “Love you too.” - Before he could do anything about it, he was out the door with Pepper.
It wasn’t like they were in a relationship anymore. But they were close friends, and Pepper had been there for him through thick and thin. She would be livid if she found out Tony had kept this from her.
“Wh-what’s wrong buddy?” Tony asked suddenly as he pulled away from his son to get a better look at his face.
“Don’t be sorry Peter. It’s not your fault,” Tony said with a nervous smile before taking the baby powder and applying it to Peter. Within a few minutes Peter was standing back up again in a fresh diaper.
His super metabolism always burned off any earthly alcohol he consumed. But here in space, he could drink three cups and he would be set. And so Steve drank, and drank, and drank. He needed to forget his botched plan to spend the rest of his life with Peggy. He needed to forget that the only other person he had ever loved besides her was gone, no longer apart of his world. He needed to forget.
“No,” Pepper hummed thoughtfully. “Not now. I’ll let Tony do that when he’s ready. Thanks for the offer though,” She said with a smile. “You should get some rest though, seriously,” She said, cocking a single eyebrow.
“Then that’s all I can ask for,” Tony said and suddenly he was pulling Steve’s head closer to his own. In one swift moment, Tony’s lips were connecting to Steve’s forehead, giving him a sloppy kiss. The two stayed like that for a moment, Tony just humming softly as Steve sat there in shock. “I love you Steve Rogers. Always have. Always will,” Tony breathed as he pulled away. “Now, how many stones do you still have to return?” Tony asked, his tender tone gone.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Steve hummed as he pulled Tony away from his chest so he could get a good look at him. Even with his eyes puffy from crying, and snot running down his face, Steve could honestly say Tony was the most beautiful thing he had seen. “I’ve got you.”
“Really?” Tony asked in disbelief as he turned his head slightly. “I hate it. It’s so stupid. There’s no real plot.” Tony said with a heavy sigh, only to laugh a second later as the younger brother fell over in the snow because he had on too many coats.
“Car. I see a car. And-” The man paused, taking in a strangled breath. “A n-no parking sign. And-” Suddenly Tony’s head was tilting up to look at the source of the voice. “I see you, Steve.”
great? I mean what did I ever do for you that would make you go off on some manic adventure in space the moment I die?” Tony asked, laughing lightly.
“You don’t know that Pepper,” Tony said dryly as he just blinked at the woman. “He’s so smart and he’s scared and-”
“Oh Tony,” Pepper gasped as she peered down at the sleeping boy. “He’s absolutely precious,” Pepper cooed as she leaned down and gently carded her hand through the boy’s choppy hair. “He looks just like you did when you were a baby,” She hummed quietly.
Tony did his best to ignore the fluttering feeling that he felt in his chest, as well as the way Pepper grinned from ear to ear.
“I’m okay!” Peter said quietly as Tony grit his teeth and rolled his eyes at Friday’s commentary, unaware that Peter had even said anything.
“Tony,” Steve said carefully as he set his book down. “I-I’m not who you think I am,” Steve said, his eyes wary.
“No,” Peter said innocently, shaking his head before finishing the food in his mouth. “I slept with daddy all night! I was too scared and the bed is too squishy,” Peter said before taking some eggs in his hand and shoving it into his mouth.
“ Subject 009 - “Peter”. Born August 27, 2013. Mother: Mary Fitzpatrick-Parker. Father: Tony Stark.” He read out loud before looking at the picture that accompanied the first page. “Peter,” he muttered, wondering who gave him that name. He was going to read more, but all he could do was stare at the picture. The kid definitely had Stark hair. In fact, it reminded Tony of his mother’s hair, even if it was messy and poorly cut. And his nose was a stark nose. The one thing that stuck out to him those were the kid’s big brown eyes as they stared back at him. They actually reminded him of Bambi’s big eyes from the old Disney movie. As Tony looked at the picture longer and longer, though, he could only come to one conclusion.
“Friday, where’s Tony?” the CEO asked as soon as she entered the building through the garage entrance.
“You too Spangles,” Tony said, his voice shaking ever so slightly. “Is the kid in there?” he then asked as he nodded towards the doors. Tony was desperate to change the subject to anything that might keep them from talking about their past.
Steve looked it over for a moment, remembering that they had stolen the car when they had first arrived in 1970. Steve was about to say something but Tony just shook his head and pushed him towards the car. They both got in and soon the two were sitting in silence. Steve could only wipe away the tears that were slowing down as Tony stared at him.
After purchasing the only item he was there for, Peter walked out of the store and was heading for the subway once more when he looked around at his surroundings. Only one block away stood Stark-Tower. Hell, how had Peter not noticed the area he was in!?
His chest constricted as he ran and Tony felt like he was going to pass out from lack of oxygen. His head was spinning and the anxiety that was building in his gut made Tony think he wasn’t going to make it. And suddenly Tony found himself falling to the ground. The hard concrete dug into his knees and ripped his pants, but Tony didn’t care. A strangled cry bubbled from his chest and the man just collapsed to the ground, his chest heaving up and down as he rested his forehead on the cool ground. Oh God. He couldn’t breathe! He couldn’t breathe!
“Alright, well, I’ll just give you him then,” Tony said as he began to peel Peter away from him. “Let me know if you find anything serious, or if you need me. I’ll be back when I can,” Tony said.
“Yeah,” Steve said as he turned his body to look at the doors behind him. “They’re all sleeping now. We had an issue with a crying baby, but one of the girls got her calmed down,” Steve explained. “You’re kid was up for a while...but I think he tired himself out,” Steve said with a small shrug. “All of them have had a long night.”
“Wait,” Steve said in shock as he leaned forward towards Peter. “You even know about Bucky?” Steve asked. Peter shrank back a little more and his eyes went back to his lap as he began to grab at his own fingers with nervous energy.
Now that Peter was out of his arms, Tony moved quickly, not knowing how long Peter would be compliant. He first washed his hands and then slipped on blue medical gloves before opening up a cabinet.
“G-Good God.” Tony said in between gagas as he desperately tried to get his breathing under control.
“I can’t Steve,” Tony said, his hand sitting on the door handle. “As much as I want to. And God do I want to. I can’t,” And suddenly, Tony’s voice was shaking. “I wish I could stay and make all your hurt go away, because it kills me to see you like this Steve. But I can’t. I have a wife and daughter back home. And I’ll never do anything to hurt them. Because they are my world, and I love them. They saved my life. I owe them everything. And if I stay here with you...I’m afraid I could lose all of that. And I can’t. I’m sorry,” Tony said, and suddenly the two were sitting in silence. The only sound was the sniffling that came from both men.
“C’mon Peter, just for a minute. I can’t do anything when you’re taking up half of my side,” Tony sighed heavily as he gently tried to shake Peter off.
After about five minutes Tony cleared his throat and turned around to see Steve who was just standing in the doorway. With a motion of his hands, Tony directed Steve into the hallway with him before closing the door.
“Sounds good,” the archer said as he hoised up his bow and arrow. “Good luck with the kid,’ He then said as he turned towards the door.
With that Steve walked back into the communal living area and picked up the large folder that had the kid’s picture on it.
Steve looked at Sam for a long moment before looking back down at the folder in his hand. The picture on the front was of the little boy named Peter, and Steve’s interest grew. So he opened it up, and read carefully.
“I didn’t recognize you with you beard,” Peter said, his eyes trained to the table a few inches in front of him.
“They are still classified as missing,” Tony muttered, not even looking up at Pepper. “Their family has no idea what has happened to them and it sucks because I have to give them the news that their loved ones are dead.” Tony said, his words having a little bit of a bite to them.
In the end, it was much larger than any of the men would have expected. The location was heavily guarded from the inside. It had guards posing as park rangers in the front room, but as soon as they saw the three enter the front door, they jumped into action. Of Course the group took them down with no problem, and from there they moved through the building. They quickly found a staircase that led them to a lower level where they found room after room of HYDRA agents. At first there were the standard rooms: Labs, rooms with computers, living areas. But then things began to change drastically. Steve definitely knew something was wrong when he found a small closet-like room that held three female bodies. They couldn’t have been dead more that a few days and the sight made Steve’s stomach churn.
Tony could feel it getting worse and worse, and his eyes flickered up to see more and more colorful explosions across the sky. The rational part of his brain was trying to tell him that he was safe, and everything was fine. He was going to be okay, he just had to wait it out. -- The other part of his brain though, was screaming at him to run. And hearing the concern in his husband's voice was enough to convince him that he needed to get out of there.
“I don’t need an apology Cap. We’ve already done this,” Tony hummed, a small smile on his face. “I forgive you,” Tony said, patting Steve on the shoulder before reaching for the door handle. “Now if you don’t mind, I have a universe to save,” Tony said, giving Steve a smile.
Unfortunately the survivor number was drastically smaller than the ones who were dead. Half were women and girls who were either shot in the head, starved to death, or seemed to have died from complications while giving birth. The others were new born babies or toddlers.
Steve suddenly stopped, his breath catching in his throat as his eyes shot up to Peter. What had he just said?
,” Tony said as he slowed his hips with the music before stopping. “And my hips don’t lie Steve,” Tony said as he wriggled his eyebrows. “Okay,
“I got it Tony. Don’t worry,” he said as he set a hand on Tony’s shoulder. The entire time Tony was running around, though, he was still holding Peter. The man had tried to hand him off to Rita after they landed, just for a bit, but the boy went absolutely ballistic. In the end all Tony could do was carry the boy around with him.
was dead and Peggy could see through his heartbreak. As Steve finished up, he suddenly realized that he was actually crying.
“Alright, alright. Mr. America can stay with you,” Tony said with a heavy sigh as he rolled his eyes. It was clear Peter had a thing for Steve, and the inventor wasn’t sure how thrilled he was about it.
Things got worse, though, when Steve walked through the door at the end of the hallway.As soon as the door opened Steve saw three scientists a good twenty yards away crowded around a table. In the center of the table stood a naked child who was no more than a year old, being held by their arm so they were standing up. The girl was crying as the men poked at her with some device and her crying continued as each scientist stopped to look at the person who had entered.
“When you got me and the others out of that place...I didn’t recognize you because you had a beard,” Peter explained, his eyes still avoiding Steve as he spoke. “But you’re Steven Grant Rogers, Captain America. Born July 4th, 1918. Right?” Peter asked, his large brown eyes now flickering up to meet Steve’s.
“When did you become so sassy?” Tony grumbled as he rolled his eyes before getting up and stepping towards the sink to wash his hands.  Looking back at his son, Tony sighed. “Okay Peter. While changing your diaper is great, and I feel like we’ve really bonded, I honestly don’t want to repeat that. So try not to go in your diaper, okay? It’s okay to have accidents, don’t feel bad if you do go in it...but if you have to go to the bathroom, just tell me and we’ll work on that. Okay?” Tony said wearly as he eyed the little boy.
“I found everyone’s file,” he said as he set the five folders on the coffee table before sitting down across from Steve. The blonde leaned forward and leafed through each vaguely. As he came to the last one Sam cleared his throat and leaned forward before tapping the top of the file. “You really need to look at this one.”
“I don’t want to know Rogers,” Tony said, but his tone was soft. “I don’t need to know,” Tony muttered, his hand still on Steve’s face. “But do we do it? Do we bring everyone back?” He asks.
“I was going to ask you the same thing,” Loki said, his eyes never leaving Steve’s form. “Last time I checked, you were more of an Earth man,” Loki said, raising a single eyebrow.  “So where is the rest of your Avengers? Is my brother here? Are you here to-”
“We really did make a great team, huh? You and me,” Tony said, a weak smile pulling at the corners of his wrinkled mouth.
“It was nice to meet you,” Tony said as he turned back to Russell and Lynette before backing towards the doorway. “You have a very brave daughter,” Tony said before giving a quick wave. “Have a good night everyone,” Tony said and then exited the room. But not before he heard a wave of “thank you”s coming from the room.
To Peter’s credit, he was quiet after that. He didn’t squirm around in Tony’s arms, he didn’t make a lot of noise, and he didn’t complain. He just sat there and watched the world around him move as Tony did his thing.
“That may be what your Tony needed, but I don’t want that. I want you. All I have ever thought of was you. Stay. Please. Just for tonight,” Tony begged. Steve sat there for a moment, his mind whirling.
“I mean, I’ve see them and people use them but....I’ve never used one.” Peter said as red began to creep up the little boy’s neck and onto his face. Tony figured as much, but the more he thought about Peter’s answer, the more upset he was getting. The little boy had to have been going somewhere, and as far as Tony knew, the children had not been kept with diapers on. And if so, the were not fresh. Honestly, Tony felt sick to his stomach, but he tried to not let it show.
Steve probably told Tony a little too much information. But at this point in time, Steve had stopped caring about things like that. Right now Tony was sitting cross-legged on the bench, scrubbing at his chin.
The first thing he did was get a haircut. It wasn’t as short as he would normally keep it, but he figured Tony would he satisfied with the outcome. He then got a job in construction. It wasn’t much, but he was able to get a small apartment in Brooklyn. And he just existed there. In a world where Tony was alive and thriving. And maybe he couldn’t be a part of his life, but Steve was okay with that. He was happy just being able to watch.
“Hello?” he heard a female voice call from behind one of the doors he was walking by. “Hello? Is someone there?” He heard again. Her voice was shaking and Steve’s blood ran cold when he heard just how young the girl sounded. “Help me please! Someone’s in here!” She said as her voice rose into a panic and she began to bang on the door.
To say that Tony had a panic attack was an understatement. He hardly let out a reply as he struggled to suck in air, but he successfully did so, telling Steve he would be there before promptly hanging up. It took him a while, but slowly he began to compose himself. After that, his brain was running into overdrive.
“Shit,” Steve hissed under his breath as people watching the movie began to complain about Tony standing up. But Steve didn’t care because Tony was having a panic attack. “Tony,” Steve said, trying to get his husband’s attention but suddenly Tony was bolting through the crowd of seated people and was making his way out of the park.
“Hey there Pete,” Tony said as he shifted in the chair so that he was leaning closer to the bed, his elbows resting on his knees. “Did you have a good sleep?” He asked.
“You know your dad is Iron Man?” Steve asked, to which he got a head nod. “And you know how his old suits work. Inside and out?” Steve asked, getting another nod. And all Steve could do was look at Peter in shock. Because
“I appreciate it Clint. Seriously,” Tony said as he did his best to look at Clint in the eyes. “You can leave though,” I have a team coming soon. F.R.I.D.A.Y. can watch the place with my suit till they get here,’ Tony explained.
“I don’t want him to think I’m bad,” the little boy stammered as the tears began to fall. “I don’t want him to be mad at me for knowing secret things.I don’t want him to hate me. I-I wish I didn’t know them but they
The warm golden light of the sun hit Peter’s round cheeks and highlighted his brown hair, making it look almost golden. And from where Tony lay, he could still see the rise and fall of Peter’s body as he took in long breaths. And...was that snoring? It was soft and scratchy, but definitely there.
“You should get some rest Cap. Your room is still where you left it,” Tony said as he tried to wave the blonde off. If
“I thought I would take a crack at it,” Steve said as he adjusted his posture. “It’s nice to see you Tony,” Steve said, and he meant it.
“Good morning Peter,” Pepper hummed as she leaned on one arm and reached out with the other to snag an apple off of Tony’s plate. “Did you sleep okay in your new bed?” she asked, pulling off a few seeds before popping it into her mouth.
Tony’s eyes surveyed his surroundings before his eyes fell onto the little boy who was taking up most of his king sized bed. During the night Peter had wormed his way away from Tony and underneath the covers before sprawling out on his stomach. His little arms and legs took up a lot more space than Tony thought a kid his age could. But in all honestly didn’t mind Tony.
“Hey now,” Steve said calmly as he reached out and pulled the little boy up against his chest. “If Tony knew about this, he wouldn’t be mad,” Steve said, trying to sooth the boy. “Your dad loves you, you hear me? He wouldn’t be mad, just a little worried,” Steve said. The little boy was now shaking against his body, and the man couldn't help but feel bad for thinking (even for a moment) that Peter as some sort of threat. He was a little boy who was scared, and who felt safe enough around Steve to tell him the truth.
“Okay,” The boy finally said in a shaky voice as he held out his arms so that Steve could take him. As Steve pulled Peter out of Tony’s arms, the inventor felt his slightly damp shirt being peeled off his his body. The material followed Peter for a brief moment before falling onto Tony’s cool skin and the sensation sent a shiver up Tony’s spine. The inventor shifted for a moment, but tried not to make a big deal out of it.
“Hey Spangles,” Tony huskily muttered as he came within a few feet of Steve, still dancing. “C’mere.” With that he lifted one hand and did a come hither, motion with his index finger. And as if by magic Steve abruptly stood up and made his way over to the dancing man.
Pepper just happened to be at the New York location when Tony made his call. Normally Tony was the one to cancel meetings at a moment’s notice and take care of situations, but now it was her turn. Pepper was quick to clear the rest of her day, and she was soon heading towards the compound. Within two and a half hours, she had arrived.
Peter suddenly stopped squirming and turned his head to look up at Steve with his big doe-eyes. His breath hitched in his throat for a moment and Steve was afraid he might have another attack, but the boy just stared at him.
“Vaguely,” Pepper said as she adjusted her grip on the coat she was holding. “All he said was that you had found his son in some sort of secret lab I guess.” Pepper lulled into silence for a moment before looking up at Steve. “How old is he?” the woman then suddenly asked.
“I could stay with Peter,’ a voice suddenly called out and the three looked up to see Steve Rogers standing at the threshold of the room. It was clear that his presence had taken them by surprise and the solder cracked a sheepish smile as he took a step closer. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to sneak up on everyone. I just came in for breakfast and couldn't help but hear your conversation.” -- Tony blinked a few times as he looked at Steve. He was trying to process if that was actually a good idea, but before he could say anything someone else spoke up.
“Your cologne and....the trash,” Tony muttered as his eyes flickered open to see that they were seated a few feet away from a pile of trash bags waiting to be collected.
“I’m sorry,” Peter finally said, his voice shaking as tears began to collect on the edges of  his eyes. “Please don’t be mad! I-I just had a nightmare and I woke up and-”
“Nah,’ Tony said waving Pepper off. “I’m sure there is a toy in Peter’s room he could bring to play with. Or he can watch something on the tablet. I’ll have Friday download some games.”
And lastly. Would anyone be interested in hearing my spotify playlist for this fic? I have one, if it would help set a mood or anything...I just don't know if ya'll would be interested. Just let me know.
In the end, Steve didn’t even stay the night at Peggy’s. He gave her a hug, a quick kiss, and was gone. From there he returned the soul stone, and then the power stone. As he walked past the still unconscious form of Peter Quill, a thought crossed his mind. He should just stay in space, check it out. It had obviously not worked out the way he thought it would with Peggy, and there was no reason to go home, not yet. And with the time traveling thing, he could take all the time he needed. So Steve decided to be selfish another time. He snuck onto Peter Quill’s ship. He hid from the man and a pink skinned woman in a back closet, and when they landed on another planet, Steve got off.
“Not a problem ma’am,” Steve’s voice sounded from behind Tony. The shorter man almost jumped out of his skin and he turned on his heel to see that Steve had followed them out of the room.
“That’s fine,” Steve said as he dug a phone out of his pocket. “Just leave. I’ll take care of this myself,” He said. With that Steve strode towards the door and into the room here all the children resided, leaving Sam alone.
“Sounds like a plan for now,” Tony laughed as he pushed his legs over the bed and stood up. “Alright. How about we change your diaper and go get some breakfast!” the man suggested as he began to move towards the door and then down the hall towards Peter’s room.
“So let me get this straight. You are here to return the stones that you took so that my world doesn’t fall apart. And you needed them to defeat this big cosmic evil being...and you succeeded?” Tony asked. Steve could only nod. “But you’re hanging around here because you miss me? And you can’t stand to be in a world where I don’t exist anymore,” Tony said, raising an eyebrow. “Is that correct?” Tony asked.
Tony suddenly stopped mid-turn and his mouth fell open. The exact same time, his glass cup came crashing to the hardwood floor, sending glass and bourbon in every direction. Steve winced at the sound, but never took his eyes off of the man who was looking at him like he was some sort of specter.
Tony was a little surprised, though, when the boy didn’t wake up after he had put him to bed. He figured with Peter’s sensitivity to the world around him it would wake him, but he was wrong. It just proved to him how wiped out the little boy was.
“What, I can’t just come up here to visit Peter?” Pepper said innocently before taking another apple off of Tony’s plate. The inventor scrunched his nose together and stuck out his tongue, but the woman simply shook his head. “I did come up here to see Peter,” she continued. “But I also came to tell you a few things,” Pepper said as she shifted herself to look at Tony a little better.
“How are you doing today sweetie?” The old woman at the register asked as she began to ring Peter up.
“Hey! Don’t tell the kid that,” Tony whined as he took the lancet he was holding and held it over Peter’s small ring finger before pressing down.
“Goodnight squirt,” the inventor hummed, leaning down and pressing a gentle kiss to the top of Peter’s head before leaving the room. “Friday, If Peter wakes up and he’s scared, let him know where I am,” Tony said to his AI once he was back out in the hallway. - And now here he was laying in bed, desperately trying to get his mind to calm down so that he could give his tired body a rest.
“Oh,” Tony said, deflating slightly at the sight. “Well...thanks...I guess,” He said, shifting a still whining Peter in his arms.
Tony stood over the bed, watching as Peter’s chest steadily rose and fell with each breath. He was here. He was going to be okay. Nothing bad was going to happen to him.
“There is no reason to thank me,” Tony said as he let go of Russell’s hand and put both of his hands up in a defensive position. “I hardly did anything. If there is anyone you should be thanking, it’s Captain Rogers,” Tony said as he pushed his hands into the pockets of his black sweatpants.
“Hey bud, you still with me?” Tony asked as he leaned against a counter in a private room in the wig, bouncing Peter gently in his arms.
Peter knew he probably shouldn’t have said something like that to Pops, but he was a grown man, he could handle something like that, right?  And it wasn’t like they were newly divorced. Hell, they had been separated for over ten years, which was longer than they had been married. Besides they seemed to be very civil towards each other when they were in the same room. It’s not like they hated each other’s guts. In fact Tony had told Peter once that he would always love Steve…no matter what…but Steve…he was different.
“Well,” She said carefully. “If it helps any, I ran into Steve. He said he had stayed with Peter till he fell asleep,” Pepper said.  Tony only let out a huff and shook his head.
“I’m sorry Steve. I’m so sorry,” Tony cried. “I ruined our night. It was supposed to be perfect and I ruined it!”
From there the two made their way to the park and it was better than Tony could have imagined. The weather was beautiful, the lights from the city looked perfect and their wasn’t a tone of people. And if anyone seemed bothered by Captain America and Ironman leisurely walking around in three piece suits, they didn’t say anything.
“Wait,” Steve interjected, his voice a little louder than he would have liked it to be. “Stay with me. Just for a few days. You have all the time in the world. Just...stay with me for a bit longer,” Steve said, almost desperate.
“His mother gave it to him,” Tony muttered, still not taking his eyes off of Peter. “It was one of her last requests...or at least that’s what it said on their files.”
And Steve was right. Peter calmed down quickly, and by the time he was finished with his fit, Tony had collected a blood sample and had put a plain band aid on the wound.  Well, if this was how Peter acted towards a finger prick, Tony wasn’t sure how he was going to do anything else.
“I’m sorry isn’t going to cut it Peter! I can’t feed them this! They could get food poising!” Steve said, letting out an aggravated sigh as he leaned against the kitchen counter.
This story is constantly evolving and I have some BIG plans for this! Hopefully I will get into a good grove and be able to update once a week, if not bi-weekly.
“Yeah. Everything about you. Even stuff before you became Captain America. I know about Mr. Barnes and I know about your shield and-”
“Oh Peter,” Tony said, trying to ignore the feeling of his heart climbing out of his chest. “I would never leave you.”
On any other given day, Peter would opt for web-slinging. But in the state that he was currently in, that wouldn’t be such a good idea. So the boy just took the subway.
“Tony, you need to calm down. Please,” Pepper cooed. It was clear that the Inventor was on the edge of a panic attack.
“She doesn’t have any. Both her mother and father are dead, no siblings, no aunts or uncles. And the only family I could find for her husband was his brother and wife. Other than those two, he has the same story,” Tony said as he scrubbed his face with one of his hands before looking up at Pepper. “I don’t...I don’t know if I can do this...do that...call them and tell them that-”
“I know,” Tony said, figuring out how to phrase what he was trying to say. “But you were staying in a really bad environment, and those people didn’t treat you right. You might not feel sick or hurt...but I need to make sure that everything is doing okay on the inside of you, where I can’t see. Okay?”  There was silence for a moment and Tony was afraid Peter wasn’t going to replay but a small “okay” seeped out of his shoulder.
“Good morning Petey,” Tony said as a broad smile spread across his face. “Did you sleep okay?” asked.
Once they were past the doors, though, the thought of Steve being there filtered away. Because now he could see the small children in each bed. All three were either asleep, or looked like they were on some sort of medication.
“I will, in a little bit. There were some teenage girls that we found too. I contacted their parents when we got back here and they just arrived about an hour ago. I’m just going to get some extra pillows and blankets from the guest rooms...they want to be with their daughters after all.” Steve explained.
“Then that’s all I need to know,” Tony said, gently patting Steve’s cheek before pulling away. “So how long has it been since we brought everyone back...since I bit the dust? What have you been doing in all that time?” Tony asked.
“No, nothing’s wrong,” Steve supplied, a smile back on his face. “I just can’t believe how much you had planned for tonight,” the blonde admitted. “I figured dinner would be about it.”
“Then that settles it. Steve will watch Peter till we are finished,” Pepper said as she stood up and grabbed Tony’s arm, hauling him out of his seat. “Let’s get you looking presentable. They will be here soon,” she said and began to tow the man out of the room.  “We’ll be back later Peter, just be good for Mr. Rogers and do what he tells you to do.” Pepper said with a small wave.
Secondly, have anything you want to share with me about this fic? Or want to find some stuff/extras for this fic? You can find it under the hashtag: "YAMS Fic" on Tumblr.  I've decided to do a little bit more on Tumblr with this fic so that's what is behind that....(and Honestly, I just started the hashtag today, so don't expect anything for a little bit.)
“I’m calm. I’m calm,” Tony said as he took a few deep breaths. “Pepper, I’m sorry to ask you this, but would you please come over. I know you’re busy with the new deal but-”
While waiting for the woman ahead of him, Peter’s eyes started to wonder, and he found himself staring at a strawberry-banana smoothie drink in the cooler ahead of him. Peter figured he should have something slightly healthy in his system to help fight off this could, so he plucked it out of the cooler and onto the counter.
With some peanut butter and jelly sandwiches divided up between the three, they all sat in front of the TV, watching talking dogs work together as Pepper cut Peter’s hair. Even after Pepper was done, the three ended up watching an additional four episodes of the dogs. They were just too witty and cute, but of course Tony would never admit that out loud.
The soldier had only been in Peggy’s home for a few hours. He had explained everything. The ice, time travel, Thanos and the snap, and even the Avengers. He fully expected her not to believe him, but she seemed to take everything in stride.
His large brown eyes snapped over to Steve’s and he felt like the kid as looking into his soul. His brown hair was lazily cut as some of it was much longer than other strands that framed his dirty round face. As Steve observed the room he noted that it looked like the boy had been drawing something in the dirt floor. The thing that really hit Steve, though, was the smell. It was obvious that the child was using this small cell as a bathroom and the only thing Steve could think was that this kid looked like a wild animal.
As Steve made his way into the common area, he saw a figure hunched over the kitchen island. They were holding a cup of amber liquid in there hand, while a larger bottle sat on the counter. The closer Steve got, the closer he could tell who the person was. Tony.
“Okay!” the little boy replied as he slid off of the bed and followed Tony out of the room. By the time Peter and Tony were in the bathroom the man could tell that Peter was waddling uncomfortably.
“Not helping friday,” Tony said through his teeth. Suddenly Tony couldn’t hold it in anymore and his body convulsed as he leaned away from the stinky mess and let out a horrible gagging noise.
Steve had been conflicted all day. It started with one thing, and then it began to snowball from there. He felt guilty when Peter had tried on the glasses. He insisted that Peter wait, but when Peter said he wanted to surprise Tony, well, he couldn’t say no. The boy seemed so eager, he didn’t want to dampen his spirits.
so Steve waited a little longer in the alleyway before making his way back to the underground bunker. What he was not expecting was to ram headfirst into someone as he rounded the corner.
By now Tony was wondering if Peter was afraid of settings like these. He had been raised in a lab. He couldn't blame this kid if a trip to the doctor set him a little on edge. It was something that he would keep in mind. In fact, Tony might have to get creative with other doctor visits, but for now, he would try to do his best with what he had.
“A stop light,” he muttered, closing his eyes as he leaned into the larger man. “And steps...that go into a building,” Tony gasped.
“Okay sure,” Tony said hesitantly as he stood up and walked back over to the cabinet before returning shortly with the items. “Now what?”
“I love you too,” Steve said, a smile on his face. “Now get some rest okay? I’ll be here when you wake up,” Steve said, leaning forward and giving Tony a kiss on his forehead.
“It looks like it was,” She said, taking the time stone. “So what will you do now?” the woman asked.
“You too bird-brain,” Tony said. And he meant it. “Laura and the kids doing well?” He asked. He figured that’s where Clint would be. The house was never on any files, and there was no way Tony would give up Clint’s secret like that. He wasn’t that heartless.
Tony followed close behind as they made their way inside the room. They walked into what looked like a large communal living room with many couches and end tables, followed by a kitchen, and soon they were walking down a connecting hall. Steve opened the first door and motioned for Tony to walk in first.
The space stone was the first thing he decided to return. Dr. Strange had taught him how to use the time stone to revert the stone back to the tesseract. After doing so he collected himself and returned back to Camp Lehigh. He had to be pretty close to when he had left the base the first time, that way the tesseract wasn’t missing for too long. But there was no way he was going to risk running into
“Both you and Tony are so concerned about my sleep schedule,” Steve said with a tired laugh as he shook his head.
Steve slowly raised a hand and waved slightly at Peter before backing through the door and closing it. The blonde didn’t even waste time as he looked over at Sam and said, “I have to tell Tony.”
“He’s not even the kids father and he’s willing to be with him, even if he’s exhausted,” Tony grumbled.
Dancing was not Steve’s thing, though. That much he knew for sure. He always stepped on people’s feet or didn’t get into the groove of the music. The last thing he wanted to do was embarrass himself in such a public place. And even though Tony pleaded with him to dance, the blonde still refused. Tony didn’t need to know that his super-solider-boy-friend was a klutz, especially when their relationship was in its infancy.
1.) I would really like to update weekly but right now I am starting a new job so things are a little busy. Getting a chapter out every two weeks is a little hard, but hopefully things will change so it can come out regularly. Sorry about that!!
It was if time had stopped for a moment because Peter just stared at his hand with large eyes. He didn’t move. Hell, he didn’t even breath. And when Tony thought everything might be okay, Peter let out a high pitched scream as he squirmed in Steve’s grasp.
“I’m sorry Tony,” Steve said after a long time of just sitting. “That was out of line for me to say.”
2.) I wish this chapter was longer, I'm sorry! I just wanted to get an update out to all you lovely people!
“Oh my God!” a loud voice sounded from the kitchen down the hall. Peter’s heavy eyelids slowly slid open as he listened for the voice to sound again. It sounded like Pops, but in Peter’s groggy state, he wasn’t quite sure.
“How dare you underestimate me Mr. Stark-Rogers,” Tony chuckled as he stopped at a vacant blanket near the front of the crowd, only to pull Steve to sit down on the ground with him.
“Jesus! You followed us? Can’t you take an order and get some sleep?” Tony whined before catching what Rita said. “Wait. You gave Steve the Plush?” He said in a accusatory tone.
Steve stood up slowly and made his way around the table so that he and Peter were on the same side. Once Steve was near the boy he crouched down so they were able to look at each other with ease.
The compound was fairly empty as Steve made his way inside. From what he remembered, it used to be bustling with people. This was, however, after his squabble in Siberia. Half of the Avengers were on the run, and Steve was sure the other half had been pushed out by Tony. He was always one to brood.
If Peter wasn’t on medication, he probably would have ran up to it, but decided on just walking. When he got there, a big sigh of relief washed over the boy. It was just the ham he was looking for. It was wrapped in a silver wrapping, but it was still a honey ham. Hell, it was even a little bit bigger than the one Steve had. He should be happy when Peter brought it home.
Peter approached Tony quietly, and set a hand on the man’s shoulder, waiting for him to respond. Tony shifted slightly and let out a sigh, but he didn’t look up at Peter.
“I was in space,” Steve said. “I returned the power stone and just...decided to stay. I would say it’s been a good six months, but I don’t really remember much of it. I’ve just been floating around,” Steve said, his gaze falling to his lap.
“Oh my God, Steve!” The woman said, pressing her palm against her chest as she tried to collect herself. She was clearly not expecting to run into anyone. “Tony said you were here,” She said after a moment of catching her breath.
“Peter?” Steve asked, rounding the corner from the living room. “Did you get the Ham?” He asked. He clearly seemed to be in a better mood.
“Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it,” Peter huffed as he closed the door so he could get dressed with a bit of privacy.  After pulling on his jeans, Peter grabbed his Stark-phone and looked up the number to their local super-market before calling them. And low and behold, they were going to be open for another forty-five minutes.
In all honesty, Tony had no idea if he had actually fallen asleep. He remembered laying on his back and staring up in the direction of the ceiling, the room completely dark. He remembered that his mind was running a million miles an hour...and then he lost time. His eyes had adjusted to the darkness and he could make out the shape of the light fixtures that hung from the ceiling. He could see the corners of the room and if he looked around, Tony was sure he could see the general shape of all the furniture.
They sat there in silence for most of the time, and every once in a while talked about the weather or what the other was working on in terms of science projects. Suddenly Peter found himself not even wanting to go home. What would Steve say? It wasn’t by law or anything, but it was an unspoken rule that Steve had Peter for Christmas.  In fact Peter had only been at Tony’s twice after the divorce for Christmas day. And one of the times, Peter had been very uncomfortable and miserable due to the crippling separation anxiety he had directly after the divorce. He was attached to Steve. It was something that he got over with time, but Peter was sure Tony was aware of it during that time. He felt terrible for acting so rotten. He was sure it made Tony feel horrible.
“It’s okay Peter. You tried. We’ll figure something out,” Steve said with a kind smile. And with that Peter stopped in his tracks. He acted like everything was okay. But it wasn’t okay. It was Christmas. Peter was sick. Steve was disappointed in Peter. They had no tree up. There were no Christmas songs being played. There wasn’t going to be a reading of
“Oh just hold on beloved,” Tony chuckled as he squeezed Steve’s hand. “We’re not finished yet,” he said, only to get a confused look in return.
“Mr. Stark,” the man said with wide eyes as he extended his arm forward.  “My name is Russell, and this is my wife, Lynette,” the man said as a woman appeared at his side. “We’re Bailey’s parents. We- We can’t thank you enough. F-For brining our daughter back to us,” Russell said as tears began to fall down his face.
“No, that would be fine,” he said with a nod. “The compound is on private property, no one will come snooping around for you there. And my team is trusted plus they’re under contract so if they say anything well…” he paused. “Yeah, that will work,” Tony said with a nod. “Plus, Vision will be happy to see you. I think he’s tired of only seeing me around the place.”
“Oh Tony,” Pepper sighed as she hugged her jacket close to her body and proceeded towards the stairs that seperated the business part of the compound with the living quarters. As she rounded the corner, though, she nearly ran headfirst into a large man who was headed in the opposite direction.
So the soldier rounded up his teammates who were willing to help and they tossed around ideas of what they could do. In the end, they agreed on taking down HYDRA bases that were either still running, or hidden. They would simply hop from one base to another, eliminate the threats, save people if need be, and then sift through all of the files and information that was left over. It wasn’t like SHIELD was going to do it. And Steve couldn’t leave with a good conscience, knowing that all of that information was up for grabs to whoever wandered onto the site.
So I re titled my fic.  I have a better idea for where I want this to go and felt like this was a better title. Anyways, I honestly had no idea what to name this when I first started.
Tony seemed to sense Steve’s presence because he suddenly whirled around, staring at the man with large brown eyes. He was a mess. His hair was pushed in every direction while bags sat under his eyes from sleepless nights. His eyes were visibly bloodshot, and honestly, his skin looked a little too pale. It was obvious he was not in a good state.
“No. Please don’t. I want to leave it as a surprise,” Peter said with a small smile as he entered the elevator. “Please take me to him,” He added.
“I know you do,” Tony said with a nod as he patted Peter’s back. “I know. I love you to, okay Peter?” He said, looking his son dead in the eyes.
“I’m not sure. I was thinking I would go back to my timeline. I have something to drop off,” The old man explained, holding up a large, Captain-America-Shield-Like object.
Peter remembered going around the city with Pops and looking at all the buildings that had Christmas lights. He remembered laying a blanket out with him on the floor next to the Christmas tree and watching Christmas movies every night until he would fall asleep. And on Christmas eve, Steve would read
The file suddenly fell to the floor and papers scattered everywhere as Steve sharply looked up at Sam.
Honestly, Peter would have thought that Tony was in his lab, but as the elevator went by that floor, Peter became a little confused.  The elevator soon stopped, though, and the doors opened to the top floor. The commons area.  Suddenly Peter wondered if Tony had a guest over. It’s not like Peter was against Tony having someone over…he just didn’t want to interrupt them, but surly JARVIS would have said something. As Peter walked deeper into the floor, though, he saw a figure sitting on a couch, watching TV, their back towards the teen.
“N-No, it’s okay Peter,” Tony said as he pushed himself back to the side of the bed he had been sleeping on. “Did you have a nightmare or something?” he asked as he stretched out his arms, taking the little boy in them.
“Sam,” Steve preseed. “I have to do this,” Steve said as his voice began to shake. Just the thought of talking to Tony again put him on edge. After all, the last time he talked to him, or even seen him, was in Serbia, and now he would be calling to tell him this kind of news? This situation was definitely getting him worked up.
“Your hand on my head,” Tony stammered almost instantly. “The concrete, my knees, a-and your jacket-” Tony said, realized that he was clutching on to Steve’s suit jacket for dear life.
It was months later when Steve finally got the wake up call he was needing. He had wandered the cosmos, hitching a ride from planet to planet, drinking himself away, and telling himself that one day he would bring the remaining stones back. Honestly he had no idea where he was, not that it really mattered. All he knew was he was in a bar, and the alcohol was bearable.
“I do,” the man said as he motioned for Tony and Pepper to follow him towards his desk. Doctor Lucas sat down in his chair and began to type things into the computer as he spoke. “All three children have a few things in common. Malnutrition, a little bit of dehydration...and worms.” The doctor said, causing Tony to raise a single eyebrow. “Actually everyone who was held captive has worms. After talking with the older girls, it is my understanding that their food was delivered to them on a dirt floor that was never cleaned. Honestly it’s not surprising. But all of them are are being treated for that now.” Dr. Lucas said, trying to put Tony’s look of panic at ease.
“I’m using the card Dad gave me. I hope you’re okay with him paying for Christmas dinner,” the teen huffed before closing the door and marching out.
“Peter will,” Tony interjected. “I promised Peter I would be there, and I’m not. Pepper,” Tony said, almost pleading as he said her name. “That kid was depending on me and I let him down. If I can’t even be there for him...If I can’t...God. Pepper, I’m screwing things up already.”
Also, my wonderful friend and coworker, quellthefire, commissioned some art from the previous chapter! It's by ribkadory (Go check them out on Tumblr!) and I'm in love with it!!
“You meant a lot to me,” Steve admitted, his ears turning red as blush consumed his face. “You were such a good friend to me. And I wasn’t to you,” the man said, staring at Tony.
So I had time on my hand today and I was so motivated by all your comments, so I whipped up a quick chapter. Sorry, I get excited easily. Honestly I haven't proof-read any of this, so I apologize.
“Yeah well....I was going to get some rest but Peter was having a hard time being away from Tony so I stayed with him for a few hours till he fell asleep.” Steve explained.
“Yeah Peter, you got it right.” Tony said as he nodded, trying to figure out how to get to the next question he was about to ask, but Peter beat him to it.
“I’ll be back soon buddy,” Tony said quickly, trying to get in a quick goodbye. “I love you,” he added on before he brain could stop him. He didn’t know why he had said it...it just sort of fell out of his mouth.
“Okay. Clint, take these two and the baby down to the living quarters. Get them something to eat, see if you can find a change of clothes and get them a shower or something, let them rest. After you have that I need you to go back up top and stand guard, make sure no one else get’s in the building. Sam and I will find the others and bring them to to your location,” Steve said as he turned and looked at Bailey. “Can you stay with these two by yourself for a little bit while we get the others?” He asked. “If it’s too much I’ll have Sam come with you as well,” he offered.
The inventor raised a single eyebrow because, wow. That was a definition straight out of the dictionary.
Peter was still shaking but at Tony’s offer the boy instantly relaxed. His body wasn’t shaking as much and his uneven breaths had calmed down. The little boy simply raised an hand and rested it on Tony’s chest, directly on top of his arc reactor scar before a muffled “Yes please,” escaped his mouth.
“I have a team coming, they should be here in a few hours. You can go, I got this,” Tony said quietly.
“Good, good,” the blonde hummed, a sad smile on his lips as he hugged Tony a bit tighter. “Two more things Tony. Two more.” So Tony tried to focus up and find two more things that he could see.
In the end, Peter ended up only buying the smoothie and was back on the subway. He drank the entire smoothie, but could hardly taste it. Peter wasn’t sure if it was because he was sick, or because he was so upset at himself that everything lasted awful.
“You look like you could use some help,” Steve said with a tired smile that only pulled up on the left side of his face. “Don’t worry about me, I’ll be fine. Why don’t you let me call their families,” Steve suggested.  Tony couldn’t say no to that face, even if he did have mixed feelings towards Steve. So he let him.
, and the entire family was sitting around the table at the Chinese restaurant as the employees sang “Deck the halls,” very poorly. It was Pop’s favorite parts in the movie.
Steve’s eyes were locked on Tony and as soon as he got close enough, his eyes dropped down to the man’s hips. Tony only chuckled as he danced closer to Steve, bumping into him with his hips every once in a while. Steve simply raised his hands and hesitantly hovered over Tony’s constant swaying hips.
