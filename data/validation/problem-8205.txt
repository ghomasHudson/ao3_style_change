Steve flushed.  “Tony,” he said.
Tony pulled on the mirror to help himself raise his head, look back at Steve through looking into the reflective surface.  Steve’s mouth and chin still looked wet, his lips red and swollen and shiny, and Tony shivered with a self-conscious wave of heat, knowing that had come from—come from licking at
Tony circled the tip of his shoe around Steve’s cockhead, once, twice, then he got the sole up over it and pushed down, pressing Steve’s hot, achingly flushed cock, already painfully hard and wet, down against the floor.  He wasn’t even pressing down that hard, but as Steve’s sensitive tip hit the floor and rolled against it, then the rest of his cock followed, with that gentle insistent pressure, the pain that sparked through Steve had him giving a choked noise as overwhelmed tears of sensation sprang up to prickle in his eyes.  Tony flexed his foot over Steve’s cock, pressed down a little more, and the pain tore through him like a hot glorious wave, making Steve go cold all over, then hot, sweat springing up, and pleasure pounding impossibly deep and hard all through him, tugging behind his navel, in his brain.  He heard himself give a rough cry, full-voiced and low, torn right out of him, felt his head loll back heavily against Tony’s steadying hands.
Tony smiled to himself, a little.  Beautiful, he thought.  Beautiful was good, too.  Beautiful was so good.  “All for you, big boy,” he breathed, watching his own teeth white against his lipstick, the curl of his tongue.  He really did look—pretty, good enough to eat.
Tony huffed out a laugh.  “Yeah,” he said, giving Steve a look that seemed fond, affectionate.  He stepped forward, sat down on the side of Steve’s bed, and hesitated just a moment, then took his hand, pulled it back down to rest on his chest.  “You stay still now, all right?” he said.
“So,” Tony said.  “I’m all yours.  Are you going to wake me up for an early morning bit of the old in and out?”
They lay like that for a long time, Steve’s big body shivering against him, his lips pressed against Tony’s thigh, saliva drooling out into a big wet smear against it as Tony pet his hair, rubbed behind his ears, at the back of his neck, into the hinges of his jaw, and Steve breathed unevenly.  His big hand was still clasped loosely around the base of his own cock.  Eventually, though, his breathing evened out, his abs quivered, worked, and then he was opening his eyes, pulling his hand away from his dick.  It was covered in his own come, and he made a face at it and wiped it off on the covers, then down his own side, before he looked up at Tony.  He was biting his lip, and his face looked uncertain, despite all of Tony’s praise.
“Mmm, you like that, huh,” Tony murmured against the back of his neck, lips soft and mouth dragging soft and wet along Steve’s nape.  “You like me deep inside you.”
At some point, Tony fisted his hand in Steve’s hair and half dragged him, half guided him, up on shaky legs, still biting his chest with sharp, painful pleasure, sucking bruises out of the skin, then pushed him back, back, back.  Steve could barely think—his nipple was a throbbing ache, a reflection of his cock except that this one Tony
to rub off on Steve, against his stomach, and the prickling need in his cock had nowhere to go, his breath practically sobbing in his throat.
Tony was still smiling at him; he could see it out of the corner of his eyes.  He curled his hand more firmly around Steve’s and squeezed, rubbing his thumb against the heel of his palm now.
“Look at these gorgeous tits,” Tony murmured, sliding down in front of Steve to his knees, guiding Steve’s face up to his shoulder, even as his hand went back to his chest, stroking and teasing.  He was there, kneeling in front of Steve, a moment later, squeezing his thumbs tight against Steve’s nipples until his breath creaked out of him on a high-pitched whine that sounded like a door hinge that needed attention.  “Shh, shh, I know, I know,” Tony said in a soothing tone, leaned in and pressed a wet, hot kiss with teeth into Steve’s neck, just beneath his jaw, never letting up the pressure against his nipples, circling his thumbs firmly, until Steve was gasping, jerking his hips, throwing his head back and squirming helplessly.  He could feel his already peaked nipples growing even harder, firmer, under the friction Tony’s thumbs provided, the friction Tony had so far only given his cock with the sole of his shoe, felt his nipples going hot, hot and flushed, even as he found himself pressing his chest up into Tony’s touch, panting, chasing the feeling, every brush of Tony’s thumbs sending referred pleasure down to his dick.  He barely noticed as his cock jerked, sending precome spattering against his inner thighs, the kind of wet and messy that usually embarrassed him, made his cheeks, his chest, his ears, his whole body, burn with humiliation.  “Look at that,” Tony said, “when you flush your areolas go
“God,” Tony breathed.  “If—if you’re sure.  You were so good, baby, so good.”  He pushed himself up enough to press a kiss to the back of Steve’s neck, his ear, his hair, and Steve shivered pleasantly, hid his smile against his arms.  “So, so good,” Tony murmured, lips traveling down Steve’s neck, behind his ear, against his pulse.  He traced his fingers lightly over Steve’s chest, his clavicles, rubbed at his pecs above his nipples, and Steve shuddered, because oh, oh, that was sensitive, felt his cock jerk again, tiredly.  “Couldn’t have asked for better, or for more.  You give it up so beautifully.  You give me everything.  You’re perfect.  Are you sore here?”
“Steve is fine,” he managed.  His voice shook.
“Yeah,” Steve said blurrily, head hazy and thick, his voice scratchy and rough, hoarse, but to him it felt obvious.  “’Course.  Always.”
Tony laughed and dragged a finger down the center of Steve’s chest, flicked it gently in the wet little pool Steve’s precome had made on the inward dip of his belly.  “I don’t know, big fella,” he said.  “You leak like a faucet someone’s broken in half.  So sweet and so wet.  I could slick you up with your own precome; who needs lube with you, huh?”
Steve sucked on his bottom lip, cast his eyes down, somehow made bashful by being called that.  Princess.
Brock arched his eyebrows at him.  “He’s not what?” he sneered.  “A cock hungry whore like you?  That’s the truth.  I don’t think anyone could want cock as bad as you do.  I didn’t even have to pay you for it, did I?  You just got down on your knees and bent right over like the best little cockslut in the world.  No way Stark would be a cock-hungry slut like you who needs his ass beat black and blue to spurt off.”
Tony panted, trying to obey, and slowly his breaths slowed, something uncoiled inside him, and he felt a warm wave of slow soft easiness wash over him, the tightness in his belly smooth out, soften into something hot and liquid, the ache in his cock somehow settle into him, like it was part of him.  He leaned his sweaty forehead against Steve’s shoulder, gasping.  “Oh,” he managed.  “S-Steve.  Sunshine.”
The mirror was mostly clean now, and Tony had to bend down almost to the floor to get the rest of it, lick it up off the frame.  It pushed his ass up, as he arched his back, tried to lean down, so of course that was when Steve set his lube-slick thumbs at Tony’s damp, softly massaged into open relaxation hole, pulled him slightly apart, hands gripping his ass cheeks and parting them as his thumbs slid in, and pressed his mouth, soft and hot and wet, to the soft slick open rim of Tony’s hole.  He kissed at the rim of it, soft and sweet, then sucked a little, until Tony shivered, moaned a little, uncontrollably, at the soft wet suction against such a sensitive place, rocked on his knees, and then Steve was kissing him again, but more lewdly, like he would have kissed his mouth with tongue, licking into him, sliding it wetly along his rim, his inner muscles, in and out, flickering and wet and warm.  Tony trembled, vividly aware of the wet soft strength of Steve’s tongue at his most intimate place, of the stockings pooling and slipping on his legs, starting to slide down toward his knees, of his cock throbbing and nipples prickling and the saliva that was sliding into his goatee, all across his cheeks and lips, the soft ache of his jaw.
“You’re not useless, Tony,” Steve said, firmly. Sternly.  The way his jaw set made his head throb.
“It’s not a requirement,” Tony said breathlessly, but he wasn’t pulling away.
“Do my best,” Steve said, smiling a little.  Being good and obedient hadn’t been his strong suit even when he was a soldier, but somehow he always wanted to do his best for Tony.  He curled both arms around Tony, hugged him close, let his body relax into his, against him.  Tony was all lean muscle and strength against him, under him, and Steve just wanted to curl up around him and never leave.  Nothing felt as—as good as this, as perfect, as—as safe, as this, curled up against Tony in Tony’s bed in the mansion, the bigger-than-king bed that fit both of them with room to spare, that smelled like Tony, soap and aftershave, the crispness of clean cotton sheets warm and soft and fresh on his skin, the firm but soft pillows that he could just sink into, Tony’s living warmth there against him, the reassuring security of Tony’s presence, his strength, his comforting presence and how he made Steve feel sheltered and looked after and, and loved in ways Steve didn’t often let himself feel.  He always tried to be—to be strong, not a problem or a burden or a drain, doubted he’d have imposed himself like this on most of his other lovers, but Tony always made it feel more than okay, like it was a favor to him instead of the other way around.
So he started slow, with this—it was a thick mop, but still just about the lightest flogger they had, and he stroked it over the round, rosy cheeks of Tony’s rear before he swung back and hit it against his skin. He went easy, kept it light, knowing that even then, it would feel more intense against the skin of Tony’s buttocks, already stinging and warm from Steve’s heavy hand.  He couldn’t help but revel in the way that Tony gasped, lifted his rear up into the strokes of the flogger, even as Steve let it slide down over his thighs, a silky tease over the sensitive skin, up and down the inside of first one thigh, then the other, before he teasingly flicked it up against Tony’s perineum, his balls, his cock, not hard enough to hurt or with really any force at all, and made him gasp and shiver, moaning and rocking on his knees, before Steve brought it back around in a gentle drag against Tony’s warm red rear, smacking lightly across it.  Tony moaned, dragged his face against the pillow, hands curling into fists in the covers, and rocked back into it.
“Of course I am,” Tony murmured.  “I don’t want to be anywhere else.  Shhh, honeybunch.  Relax. I’ve gotcha.”
, he’d imagined being at the mercy of the pirates and his belly had gone tight with want.  But this—he hadn’t thought anyone would be, would be
“Oh,” Tony breathed, blinked.  “Oh, I.” His cock throbbed between his legs as he realized what Steve was asking.  “Of—of course, sugar plum.  I’d be happy to.”
“Your jumps,” Tony said. “They’re perfect.”  He grinned.  “And here comes your coach, so let me see myself out.”  He flipped Steve another little salute and turned away.
“You’re going to come for me,” Tony murmured, soft against his back.  Steve could feel the soft scratch of his facial hair against his sweat-damp skin.  That was, it had to be, one of the best feelings in the whole world.  “You’re going to come for me, honey, I know I’m going to get you there, yeah, I know what gets you going, sweetheart, I’m right here—” his hands slid up in a long sweep over Steve’s skin from his hips, up over his side, and then they were pressing into his sensitive tits, squeezing where he already felt bruised, and Steve was crying out, tossing his head back, aching as pleasure spread through his whole body, went straight to his cock, from the bruising pain of it.  And then Tony’s fingers squeezed at his nipples, teased over them, and his fingers found the clamps and did something, quick and nimble, and
It was like a punch to the solar plexus.  It almost hurt, just as bad.  Steve felt himself go cold, then hot, felt his face flame even hotter, hot as blazes, hot enough to heat a cup of water, it felt like probably.  “I—no,” he said lamely.
“You’re such a good boy,” Steve murmured, stroking the insides of his thighs now, with the backs of his fingers, making Tony shiver, feel hot all over.  “So sweet.  Thanks for taking care of that for me.”
It didn’t take long at all for Steve to come, but it was hard, furious, overwhelming.  He came and came, and Tony could feel it dripping out of him, down his legs, the wet pulse inside of him, and then Steve sagged over him, gasping, with a breathless gasp of, “Tony,” before he squeezed his hips, pressed a kiss between his shoulder blades.
“Love having your tits clamped up, your little nipples all hard, look at you, squeezed all tight from it,” Tony murmured, and Steve panted, squeezed his eyes shut, because it was so—Tony’s words alone were making him tremble and shake, making his cock jerk, making him hot for it all over.  “How’s that feel?” Tony purred.  He tugged on one clamp and Steve bit his lip against a cry, managed to swallow it into a loud moan.  “Hurts?”
Tony sniffed a bit, caressed Steve’s face a little more, callused fingertips soft against his skin, then both his hands fell to curl over Steve’s pecs, against the clamps and his sore nipples, holding them and supporting them gently, as he bent his head and he gave Steve that kiss, as their lips touched gently, softly, as softly as flower petals, as a cotton blanket gentle over his skin, as silk.  Steve moaned, felt his mouth fall open, and Tony’s tongue swiped gently, so softly, wet and warm, along his bottom lip, warm and soft as it dipped inside his mouth and made him shudder in Tony’s arms.  He moaned, arched up into it, sucked on Tony’s tongue, and Tony kissed him deeper, and something in him unspooled, went even softer, soft and pliant and easy and sweet.  Tony made a soft noise, one of pleasure, and Steve went even deeper, pliant and easy, for him, couldn’t help it, he just wanted to give Tony everything, give it all up to him, give him everything he had to give.
Steve was beautiful, so beautiful, flushed and staring down at Tony, eyes soft and hot and adoring, and Tony’s mouth was open, saliva drooling down into his goatee, he couldn’t quite swallow all of it back, but he couldn’t seem to care, just working himself, rubbing himself up and down on the big heavy cock inside him, feeling it hot and thick and demanding and yet soft on his needy, clinging insides, the pleasure soft and warm inside him, building with nowhere to go, yet he couldn’t seem to care.  Steve’s hands traveled up and down his body, squeezed, kneaded at his ass, moved down and pulled his cheeks apart, rubbed at the rim of his hole where he was spread wide, rubbing in soft little coaxing circles there, and Tony just moaned, his mouth wet, and Steve said, “You’re doing good, Tony, so good, so, so good, sweetheart.  That’s it, keep riding me, working me, just like that, that’s it.  Atta boy.”  And Tony just moaned, helplessly, the warmth of the praise spreading through him, glowing all through his body, in the tight clench of his body, and worked himself even harder.
“You better,” Brock grunted, his hand rubbing against Steve’s erection through his briefs, all rough knuckles and rougher palm, until Steve could feel himself leaking, feel his sensitive tip catching on the fabric and rubbing until it hurt, until it burned, and Brock just rubbed him harder.
But he’d been wrong about that.  Sure, Tony didn’t like it if you played up the corporal punishment side of the thing, and he didn’t have schoolboy fantasies; it was one of the few things about his own likes and dislikes he’d volunteered quickly, easily, relaxed and smiling.  Or volunteered at all, really, but that was a different story.  But Tony had just said, laughing, “I guess if you go to a boarding school, you either end up with a rock-hard naughty schoolboy punishment fantasy, or you get the exact opposite, and, well, I was the opposite.  Doesn’t do it for me, at all, really.”
“Yeah,” Tony said breathlessly.  “That’s the way my perfect pain slut likes his pleasure, huh?”  He tugged ruthlessly on Steve’s stinging nipple, until he was crying out, mouth hanging open, panting.  “No sweetness for my sweetheart without an awful lot of
isn’t in question, stud.”  He kissed Steve’s shoulder again, smoothed his hair back, and Steve sighed, thought about how he felt seeing Tony’s thighs covered in bruises, even when Tony would rock his fingers into them and sigh, eyes going heavy-lidded like that was the hottest thing ever invented, the twinge of guilt he always felt deep in his stomach, and he let Tony push his thumb in against his hole, fuck him in and out a few times with it, rough and heavy against his tender, pouty rim, and was content with that, even as only that much had him gasping and squirming with heady, almost too much sensation.
He got to blow Steve in the shower, and by the time they were falling into bed, Tony still in the cage, he felt so—so relaxed, so easy, so warm and soft and good.  He rolled over, pressed the cage against Steve’s thigh through his soft pajamas, his boxers, pushed his face into Steve’s chest, nosing against the key on its chain around Steve’s neck, against his dogtags, though his shirt, and sighed.  “Good night, sweetheart,” he mumbled.  “Thank you.”
, and Steve had forgotten how to breathe, like asthma all over again.
There was a firm, callused hand, a little dry and cold but still warmer than Steve’s skin, pressed to his cheek, along his jaw.  He sighed out a breath, found himself turning his head, pressing into it, without consciously telling himself to do it, as if he was watching himself, but without opening his eyes.  Tony’s thumb pressed against his cheekbone.  It felt good.  As much as he was feeling, focusing on, tracking on anything.
“You look like I’ve had you,” Steve said, “and boy, have I ever had you.”  He stroked Tony’s sides, gently, and Tony trembled under him. “Look at you, sweetheart,” Steve murmured.  “My little princess, with his loose stockings down around his knees and his garter belt and his skirt pushed up around his waist so I could get at his pretty cock and his panties pulled down to reveal his hole and that pretty cock.”  He reached down, stroked Tony’s belly again, rubbed it with one hand.  Tony squirmed, feeling hyper-aware of his soft cock between his legs, his exhausted panting, his liquid, tired muscles.
thing now that he’d had come up his nose, honestly, but Tony didn’t think it would be best to say that.  “Worried that you were a bit taken aback by the experience,” Tony said, finally.  “It’s not to everyone’s taste, you know, giving head.  I’m not quite sure what I expected the first time, but it definitely wasn’t that.”  He grinned up at Steve, ran his thumb, his fingers, along his jaw, over his chin.
Brock had fisted his hand in his hair and dragged his head back and Steve had gone even hotter, even brighter all over, had gasped aloud, even as he said, “Can I hear that again, Cap?  You red-faced slut.”
Tony was very warm under his arm when Steve draped it around his shoulders and nuzzled into his hair on the way to the kitchen, leaning happily against him, snuggled into him even if it might have been easier to walk if they were more separated, like he never wanted to let Steve go.  Steve didn’t make it any easier for him in the kitchen, either, wrapping his arms around him from behind and setting his chin on his shoulder as Tony got them big mugs of hot cocoa and homemade marshmallows and dollops of Jarvis’s malted milk whipped cream.  Tony set the cookies down on the table and the two cups of cocoa beside it with a kind of triumph, pulling back a chair, but Steve didn’t let go of him, just sat down in the chair and pulled Tony into his lap as he went.  Tony yelped, but didn’t struggle, let Steve pull him in, big and tall as he was.
Tony caressed his cheek again, let his head drop to Steve’s shoulder, the brush of his soft hair a welcome weight, and then he was straightening again and his grin was changing, becoming more mischievous.  “You’re hard again, you know,” he said.  “Already.”
, oh, God, it hurt so good, so damn good.  Tony tugged again, and Steve groaned again.  “That’s it,” Tony said.  “Let me hear it, big boy.  Let me hear your voice.  Groan so gorgeously, just like that, for me.  So gorgeous.”  He gripped tightly, twisted, dug his nail in until Steve was whimpering, panting, then moved to the other, gripped,
“That’s not exactly the point, mister,” Tony said, and there was an odd roughness in his laugh, in his voice, along with an odd gentleness.  “I have to give you some kind of reason not to throw yourself headlong into danger all the time.  De-incentize it somehow.”
Steve pulled off, lapped gently at the head, licking at it, around it, tongue so warm and wet over the sensitive flesh, and then muttered, hoarsely, “It’s real, Stark.  I’m here.  Believe it.”
“You always do,” Tony said, smiling softly at him and tracing his fingers down over Steve’s chest, over his t-shirt between his pectorals, tracing over the muscles and then down his side, in a gentle way that made him shiver and press closer, not in a sexual way, just because the light, simple caress felt good, made him shiver with the awareness of his skin and muscle, even as Tony’s fingers lingered lightly over the tape over his ribs through his shirt, under the blankets.
At the Grand Prix Final, almost three years ago.  Steve had been there, just to cheer on his teammates, of course.  He’d seen the whole thing.  He still wasn’t sure if he’d admired Tony for skating more than he was horrified by the blatant disrespect, the inappropriateness of the whole thing, or the other way around.  He should have withdrawn, everyone had said.  Given some other skater his spot, rather than make a mockery of the whole event. Maybe that was true, but Steve—well, Tony had worked for it, he’d thought.  He’d understood why he’d wanted to skate.  Even though he … probably shouldn’t have.
Brock choked him while he fucked him, looped his belt around Steve’s neck and pulled it tight, and Steve cried out and nearly came each time, but never got quite close enough.  “God, you can’t be quiet, can you,” Brock said after the third time, “Just can’t quite do it, you needy piece of ass.”  Steve had no breath—or words, really—to respond.  Finally Brock dropped him, let his head fall back loosely into the bed, and concentrated on fucking him, and Steve fisted his hands in the bed and let himself be fucked.
“Oh,” Tony said.  “You mean the,” he gestured at the babydoll, neatly folded beside them.
He knocked on the door, because it was only polite, then let himself in with the key Brock had given him, closing it carefully behind him.  “Brock?” he called out.  “I’m here.”
“Good?” Steve murmured, and Tony could feel his smile against his skin as he turned his face against Tony’s jaw, laid a kiss there.  He reached up, stroked gentle fingers along Tony’s throat, against his jaw, squeezed his shoulder, holding him up with his damp, come-sticky hand on his hip now, then rubbed his stomach again.  “You still there, fella?”
putting his own orgasm off; he could feel Tony’s cock hot and hard through his slacks pushing up against his back the way Tony was holding him, the bulge of his hard hot length against his spine, while he lavished attention on Steve; he could feel him a little wet through his slacks, his underwear.  It made Steve feel—feel helpless and greedy.  He could hold off, he knew he could, but—but Tony seemed to enjoy it, a lot more than he did, the holding off, so maybe it was all right.  It was torture for Steve, the waiting; his whole body was already pulled tight with need, with anticipation, hope for another orgasm, and he felt like a needy, wanting mess, an embarrassment, out of control, a quivering wreck, totally in Tony’s hands now, and he loved it, had to bite back a sob just at the twisting, wonderful, out of control thought.
Steve smiled at that, a pleased light in his eyes even as he flushed deeply all over again.  “Yeah?” he breathed.
“Hey there, fella,” Steve said, and kissed him.
“Aww, sweetie, I try,” Tony murmured, feeling a warm flush of pleasure up into his face himself at that.
, stud.  Now that you can do that, I’m yours for life, you know that?  All you have to do is get down on your knees and suck my brains out through my cock, and—”
His toes, his ears, the little whimpery noise he made when Tony rubbed at his prostate and he bit his lip despite himself—those were all things that hadn’t changed about him at all since the serum (he remembered stroking himself off, fingers deep inside himself and one hand around his cock, and hearing himself make that same noise as he bit himself against it, and throbbed with humiliated need and the desperate hope that no one had heard).  He didn’t often think about that sort of thing in bed, but the thought just came to him and lingered for a while, because maybe that meant Tony would have enjoyed Steve in his other body, too, just like this, and that thought made something throb so beautifully and so painfully in his chest that his breath caught and his eyes stung and he almost fell forward onto his crossed arms to bury his face in them, just barely managing to keep himself up.  And Tony just praised him; “Good boy,” he said, “good boy, good boy, Steve, so good for me, so, so good for me, cupcake.”
Steve nodded, looked around for his clothes.  Brock tsked at him.
Honestly, she and Bucky had just signed up for this show because Steve had—he needed the money, but they didn’t really, and he was grateful for the moral support, just having them around. Everything was so different now that he’d bulked up and started winning, and he wasn’t—used to it.  The attention on him.  Coming out of practice and seeing the press outside still made his stomach flip and roil uneasily.  Having his friends around, having them with him, it helped.
“I, uh, I, I love you, too, sunshine,” Tony said, stammering and sweet and unsure, and God, Steve loved him so much.
Tony grinned.  “You betcha, champ,” he said.  He twisted around on Steve’s lap—also distracting, with that fine rear end of his moving and rocking all over him—and leaned forward, picked a gingerbread wreath cookie, and held it to Steve’s lips to take a bite of.
“Shh,” Steve murmured, against the soft, sensitive skin of the curve of Tony’s ass, just above where it met his thigh.  “Let me?” He kissed up along it, gently, then went back in for another soft lick, capturing another trickle of come as it leaked out of Tony’s body, down along his balls, chased it back out with his tongue and sucked more out of his hole.  “I want to,” he murmured, and Tony felt hot all over, but he nodded, let himself go lax, spread his legs a little more.
Steve could still feel the shock of horror when he realized they were trying to recreate the serum.  Again.  Make more of him.  He’d wondered if they’d been making them for HYDRA, he’d wondered, he’d—he swallowed, hard. “Some scrapping at the start,” he muttered.  “It’s hardly—”
“Yeah,” Tony said, and laughed again.  “I nominated myself for it, you see.”
“I don’t know about that,” he said.  “I’m no good at any of this domesticity stuff.  But I can follow orders.”
Tony rolled his eyes at him, but there was a trembling smile on his lips that looked as if it might have been tears in another second on anyone else.  “Yeah, trying not to, babe,” he said.  His hands were on Steve’s face a moment later, straightening his head, and even with everything else, the touch of the firm, hard, callused fingers and strong palms sent a tingling burst of sensation through Steve, made his skin heat. The nickname did, too.  Every time Tony called himself something like that, Steve found his belly knotting up with stupid pleasure, found himself blushing. He knew Tony didn’t mean anything by it, but it still—it made him happy.  That Tony called him silly nicknames, even now.  It let him know that their friendship was doing all right—when they’d been on the outs, every time they’d been on the outs, Tony hadn’t called him anything like that.  Tony checked Steve’s eyes, a gentle thumb against each of his eyelids, then sighed.
, oh, God, Tony had just touched his cock to—to
“I’m not gonna get scared away from you because your dick went down my throat, Stark,” Steve said gruffly, against Tony’s thigh, the soft crease between it and his wet dick, sticky with saliva and precome, his chin brushing his balls and his breath warm.  “I know what I signed up for.  I
Tony pulled down a little nervously on the front of the filmy lace skirt he wore over his panties and garter belt, smoothing it out with careful fingers, looking at himself critically in the mirror.  He wasn’t sure why getting dressed up like this always seemed to make him feel so—so fragile, vulnerable and exposed and open to Steve in a way he didn’t feel even naked in front of him, and certainly didn’t feel in the silky lacy panties he wore every day under his suits, even when Steve was running his fingers over them, touching Tony’s cock through them, even pressing his face to Tony’s hip, rubbing his cheek softly against the fine lace, against Tony’s cock through it, breathing out in apparent wonderment, long and deep like bliss, the way he did sometimes.
Steve wanted to promise that it would be all right, that he’d make sure it was okay, that no one gave Tony a hard time, but he was afraid that would be too much.  They hardly knew each other, after all.  He would just make sure that no one gave Tony a hard time, and then, maybe next time, thought it felt presumptuous even to think about a next time, but maybe then Tony would feel well, safer, accepting an invitation from him.  “All right,” he said, and smiled at him.  “Great.”
them.  You look absolutely beautiful, Tony.”
“I’m just glad you liked it,” he said, and it was so sweetly sincere that something seized up in Tony’s chest, a lump clumping in his throat.
Tony winked up at him, reached up, ran two fingers over his wet, lipstick-smeared, come-spattered lips, feeling their hot raw puffiness, the wetness of come over the stickiness of the lipstick, until his fingers felt coated in it, and he reached out, pressed them into Steve’s skin just above the jut of his hip, leaving a red kiss of lipstick there against his skin.
.  He could see Tony’s lips forming the words, but they didn’t really make any sense. Steve dragged in his breath, blinked again, and felt a swoop of vertigo as things started to come back together again. He’d been thrown free of the building in an explosion.  He’d landed on his back in the street, which was why he’d been staring up at the sky. His shield and his shield arm were lying on his chest.  The ringing in his ears slowly started to subside, but with that came a wave of nausea and the absolute conviction that if he so much as tilted his head he’d puke up his entire guts, the feeling crawling over him like a horde of Hank’s damn ants.  He swallowed, gulped, uncomfortably.  God, his head hurt.
Afterward, when Brock pulled out, he was still groaning and shivering, his cock sore but burning with need, even when Brock cruelly flicked the tip, his sensitive cockhead, and made him gasp and groan and almost sob.  He was so wet, he was leaking, and he knew Brock’s rough fingers came away smeared with it.
The thing was, Steve wasn’t always that patient in bed, but when it came to fucking like this, he’d perfected the art of going slow.  It always felt like it took a long time for Tony to come from anal, even with a hand on his cock, but Steve just held him steady and kept up a constant pace, stroking Tony’s cock gently the whole time.  Tony couldn’t seem to do anything but feel—the constant warm strokes and gentle friction against his cock, the way Steve knew just how to rub his thumb over the head, stroke him down the shaft, rub at the base of it, and always the pressure and throbbing, sweet pleasure inside of him at the same time, until all Tony could do was to buck up away from that intense building sweet, hot heat inside him, then push himself back down into it again, desperately seeking it.  Steve was patient, seemed focused on making Tony feel good, slowly working him up, building that pleasure with his pulls on Tony’s cock, the constant pleasure on his prostate.
“And God, Tony, your nipples,” Steve murmured, reaching up and touching one gently.  The touch to the sensitive peak made Tony gasp, squirm under him.  Steve rubbed it gently, slowly with his thumb, making pleasure shudder through Tony’s body, and he sighed.  “I couldn’t take my eyes off them,” Steve murmured.
.  You were so lovely.  I was just worried it’d been too much of a shock.  I want it, I wanted it, I love your mouth on me, sweetheart, honey, love it.”  He found himself sweating, hot, almost trembling.  He felt dizzy at the idea that Steve would want to suck him off that badly, enough that he would—would actually spend time thinking about it.
it, wet and sensitized and trembling, every time Tony slapped Steve’s sore, hot buttocks and made him clench down instinctively.
He should say hello. Steve straightened up from his own stretch and wiped his hands on his sweats before he started across the warmup room.
“I sure want it to,” Steve muttered, almost breathed, then smoothed his hand up over Tony’s thigh, stroked along it, and then over his hip, before he leaned in.  There was a moment of his warm breath gusting damp over the head of Tony’s cock, and then Steve closed his eyes and leaned in, opened his mouth a good few seconds before he got it around the tip of Tony’s cock.
,” he muttered.  “You like whatever I do.  No matter how clumsy I am or—or inadequate, and then you turn around and act like you gotta be perfect for me every time.”
“Nah,” was all Tony said, and turned his head, brushed a soft, smearing kiss against the base of Steve’s neck. “It was good.  You pushed me just … just enough.”
“Okay?” Tony said.  His fingers were curling around Steve’s, intertwining with them, and he reached up again, stroked his thumb along just under Steve’s chin, along the underside of his jaw.  “You’ll let me get them to put you back under?”
Still, Tony let himself work both of them up slowly this time, let his eyes slide mostly closed as he closed his fingers around Steve’s cock, ran a hand down to stroke and roll at his balls, letting Steve’s hot, thick cockhead and sweet musky taste slide back and forth over his tongue, dragging his mouth open wide, even as he hollowed his cheeks and sucked on him, played gently with his tongue along the ridges, the underside, over the head, flicked it gently against the slit.  It always felt so good once he got into the rhythm of it, and Tony found himself squeezing his legs together, soft silky stockings rubbing together at his thighs, the feeling shivering and bright, as if that would give him any stimulation on his tightly captured cock as it throbbed beneath his panties and the garter belt, pushed down tight against his skin even as it hardened and plumped up and he could feel it leak a bit of precome, wet and messy against his skin, as Steve’s hot musky length filled up his mouth.  He could feel the steady pounding of Steve’s heart in his hot, hard length over his tongue, and Tony’s mouth felt wet and sticky and strange with the lipstick, made him all the more aware of it.  He could taste the lipstick on Steve’s cock, on his own tongue.  He was determined to smear it all the way down to Steve’s base, to leave a ring of it there.
He started with Tony’s shoulders this time, dragging the tails softly down over his back between each strike, with no force, let them tickle over the small of his back, before he’d bring it back to the other shoulder in a light thud.  Tony shivered, flinching lightly once, twice, then sighed, seemed to relax under it, all the tension going out of him.  Steve reached out, brushed his other shoulder just to check, feeling the looseness, buttery and soft, of the muscles under his fingers, then smiled to himself as Tony just sighed, shifted on one side slightly and pushed back into the touch, and then pulled his hand back, brought the soft flogger down again.  He went a little harder with it, now—he could go harder with the lamb fur anyway without damaging it, and now that Tony had relaxed, he could take some solid thump with the velvety softness over his skin.  Tony went loose under it, sinking into the pillow, hitching his knee up again, his legs spread wide.  Steve shifted so he could wrap a hand around his ankle, stroking the skin gently as he worked on his shoulders.  The flogger was easily light enough to use without worrying much about his balance or his other hand, and he liked the control of holding Tony’s ankle loosely in his own hand, the way he could feel his pulse thudding in the thin skin under the bone if he rested his thumb there.  Tony just sighed and went even more loose and relaxed under his hold.
“You’d rather just lie there and suffer?” Tony demanded tightly, but his thumb was rubbing gentle circles into Steve’s skin again.
And now here he was.  Giving into his baser desires.  Seeking out one of his subordinates for sex.  Steve sighed, rubbed one hand through the sweaty hair at the back of his neck and shook his head at himself.
And he was asleep a moment later.
This one was bunny fur, white and silky soft, and Steve never went that hard with it, partly so as not to damage the tails.  He didn’t like to start hard with Tony at all—if Tony wasn’t good and warmed up, it really hurt for him.  Even if Steve didn’t warm Tony up enough, he’d see Tony wincing with real discomfort (but not saying a word about it, of course), and that wasn’t what he wanted for him, not until he was deep, deep in it, and it was pleasure-pain, not just the kind of pain that sliced through you like ice, made Tony tighten up and his breath come tight and straining in his chest.  Steve never wanted that for him at all, as much as he reveled in drawing the warm, hot, dizzying pleasure-pain and sensation of the other out of him.
“Thank you,” he murmured, and just let himself relax.
Tony groaned, turned his head and knocked his cheek against Steve’s.
“Nah,” Steve said.  “You’re very, very nice, sweetheart.  You’re always very,
“Yeah,” Steve said, and slapped his round, red rump lightly, but loud enough to make a sound, hard enough that Tony jolted and then gave a groaning, breathy laugh.  “For now, buster.”
and pushed in, and oh, God, it was so
“I’ll try not to,” Steve promised, catching Tony’s hand in his and pressing a kiss to the palm.  He could feel Tony’s little shiver of pleasure all through his body, feel more than hear the way his breath caught, watched as he looked up through his eyelashes at Steve, Steve thought mostly unconsciously.
“I like to know that I’m pleasing you,” Steve said, meeting his eyes, all honesty, pure sincerity, and Tony was really breathless now.  “You always make me feel so damn good.  I’d like to return the favor.”
He was already hardening in Tony’s hand, though, hot and heavy under his fingers.  “Yeah,” Tony breathed, “but you can always go again. I want you to go again, sweetheart. Honeymuffin.  Apple pie.  I got all dressed up for you.  I want you to, to use me.  Show me how much you like it, please?”
Except that his head hurt, and his mouth tasted like dust, and there was wetness trickling down the side of his head.  Steve realized it wasn’t an asthma attack, but his brain wasn’t tracking, and he wasn’t sure what it was, or what had happened, how he’d ended up like this.  Nothing seemed to be making all that much sense.  He tried to sit up, but his body didn’t seem to want to respond, to move, and he had a feeling he’d just sort of twitched.  It still
“Why would I hate you?” Steve asked, feeling his stomach twist strange and bitter, a sour taste in the back of his throat.  “I barely even know you.  I don’t know the first thing about who you really are.  I’m not going to hate someone for being better than me.”
, and he pressed his fists to his forehead and gasped, and then Rumlow was sliding deeper into him, and it felt so good, felt like he’d been empty and waiting for just this and never realized, a big cock deep inside him, and then Rumlow had started to thrust, had pulled at Steve’s hair, had dragged at his shirt, and it had felt so, so good, so good that Steve had gone away in his head again, something going soft inside him, inside his core, so that it barely seemed to matter that he was getting hard again, that his cock was thickening up between his legs, against his pelvis.
“Steve,” he groaned, practically whispered, whimpered, jerking his hips up helplessly, spasmodically, into Steve’s hand.
And then Brock had laughed, had called him easy for it, eager, an easy slut just waiting to be mounted, and he’d spread Steve’s hole out on his fingers and drizzled, poured lube over it until Steve was shivering, then he hadn’t felt cold at all, as Brock’s thick, heavy, hot cock was pushing into him.  He jerked at Steve’s shirt, bound it up in his hand, and laughed as he said, “Sure hope you don’t mind a little barebacking, little filly, ‘cause I sure ain’t finding a condom now,” and smacked Steve’s rear so it stung, and his cock was so hot and heavy it left Steve gasping.  It had to be as thick around as a soda can, and Steve felt like he was so—so full, of heat, the stretch—oh, the stretch, it was so
He forced his eyes open against the pain, feeling like he was squinting into the sun.  His eyes were watering, and they felt like they didn’t want to open.  Sure enough, opening them made his head throb even worse, a hot wet heavy feeling of tears build up in his eyes, and he couldn’t see anything but a blur anyway.  A light, sort of white blur, which supported the idea that he was in a hospital, anyway. He could feel needles connected to lines in his hand, anyway, the tape sticking them down to his skin.  He blinked, blinked again, dragged in a deep, heavy breath that was at least easier than it had been, in his blurred memories of whatever had happened before this.  He remembered struggling to breathe, wondering if he was having an asthma attack.  His breath rasped a little in his chest and his throat, which felt a little sore, but it was coming easier now, less heavy.  Steve figured that was good.
Tony had to smile at the way he had his jaw set like he was going into battle.  He brought the callused tips of his fingers down over Steve’s face, caressing his cheek, his jaw.  “All right, slugger,” he said.  “That’s a deal.  I’ll give you tips, if that’s what you want to do.  But trust me, you did perfectly fine the last time.”
That same tone of wonder and awe was in Steve’s voice now, as he said, breathlessly, warm against Tony’s neck, “You look so pretty, Tony,” looking over Tony’s shoulder at the two of them standing in front of the floor-length mirror, big warm hands skimming over Tony’s hips, along the short flirty skirt of light blue silk and lace, down under it to wander over the soft blue and white cotton of his garter belt, tracing down the straps where they bit lightly into Tony’s thighs, then back up again.  His eyes looked big and blown, he was biting his bottom lip, flushed furiously down his neck and over his chest, down past his nipples (already perky and flushed themselves, standing out from his pillowy pecs with arousal) and he couldn’t seem to stop running his hands over Tony’s hips, his belly where it was covered by the garter belt, down over his thighs, and that was totally,
“Sorry,” he gasped.
Steve groaned, panting, eyes fluttering dazedly open as he looked up at Tony, dragged his tongue up under his cockhead, over the tip, long and slow, making Tony moan aloud again and bite his lip, and then he blinked, shivered, and rolled obediently to one side, spreading his legs and tilting the upper one back to push his cock forward, putting it more on display, even as he clutched at Tony’s thigh, his knee, as if to steady himself.  He looked up at Tony again, half uncertain, as if to ask
, that made him feel
“Mmm,” Steve groaned at that, the vibration traveling so perfectly along Tony’s cock, and he pressed closer, opened up his mouth a little bit more and let Tony’s cock slide just far enough to flirt with the back of his throat, then pulled himself off nearly to the tip again, lips tight, providing him with suction until Tony was moaning.  Through his own pleasure, Tony was vaguely aware of Steve’s hips jumping, how he pressed them down into the bed and rolled them idly, the big broad length of Steve’s erection obvious behind the soft, clinging fabric.  Steve whimpered, at that, and the feeling of that noise around his cock shot to Tony’s belly and coiled tight in his balls, throbbing hot in his groin.  Hell, was Steve really that into it?  Sucking Tony’s cock?  It seemed impossible, improbable in the extreme, and yet there he was, idly rolling just one big broad thigh against the bed to press his cock into it just a little, flushed all over and hot against Tony’s legs, blatantly turned on.
“I know,” Steve murmured, soft, left his hand flat on Tony’s belly, feeling the slight softness over the muscle, letting the warmth of his palm bleed through Tony’s soft t-shirt. “I always know, Tony, sweetheart.” It wasn’t exactly true; sometimes he forgot, to his own shame, took Tony for granted, his sweet, careful way of caring, the little details that showed his love and care, and his generous nature, but in the back of his mind, he felt that certainty, that—reassuring knowledge, that Tony cared for him, that Tony would reach out and take care of him if he faltered or stumbled or began to fall.
“Yeah,” Steve managed.  His head felt hot and heavy, dreamy and soft and slow.  It was all he could think of to say.  He spread his legs a little more, pressed his chest up, offering himself in every way he could think of, let his head fall back to expose his throat, his lips part.  “All yours.”
“I’m your good luck charm, is that what you’re saying, big guy?” he said.
“It’s good to see him back,” was all Steve said.  “And … uh, clean.”
, he thought, but didn’t seem to be able to follow it up with anything, not when he was still panting for breath and couldn’t seem to get any air.  In those first few moments, he didn’t have the first clue what had happened to him, and part of him wondered if he was waking up into an asthma attack.  It was so hard to get a breath, and for a moment he was back in his narrow bed in the tenement where he’d lived, cold wind whistling through the walls as he shook with cold sweat and tried to get a good breath, straining his chest so hard there was nothing but pain in his seized-up lungs.
Tony was quiet for a moment, pulling off his skate and flexing his toes, then tugging off the other. “I have to admit,” he said, as he straightened up, “your attitude is a new one on me.”
Steve pulled off just long enough to rasp, “That’s the general idea, yeah,” and then his mouth was back on Tony’s cock.  His hips pressed down into the bed again.
, and it had taken him a long time to work up the courage to give Tony a kind of a sex toy for their anniversary, but he’d done it.
“Well,” Steve said.  He grinned up at Tony.  “What about me?  What do you think about me?”
And oh, God, how had he known?  It had been the only thing Steve could think, as Rumlow got his big hand through Steve’s belt loops and tugged and he spread his legs for him, let him push him further up against the wall as his other hand had squeezed at Steve’s neck, against his throat.  He’d never thought he was being obvious—had his eyelashes given him away?  How?  What had he done that had somehow shown—but he’d always wondered, what—what it would be like, and when he jacked himself sometimes he slid his fingers into himself and
needs, right, princess?” Tony asked, and winked at him so obviously Steve could see it even with his dizzily pleasure-blurred vision, the way his head felt hot and full.
of it, spreading him out wide, pushing against that sensitive, intimate place, but then he was opening wide, giving way, and he felt Steve slip into him with that sudden sense of give, of slight vertigo, it always gave him, as Steve’s thick warm heat spread him open and pushed inside.
“Feel so good,” Tony moaned, head lolling against the pillow, bound hands lying limply above him, twining his fingers softly, as if unconsciously, into the blankets. “Please.”
His mouth felt soft and wet and hot, so damn hot, around Tony’s cockhead, and he let the moan that built in his chest escape him, let his hands slide down and clutch at Steve’s hair the way he wanted, to steady himself.  Steve gave a little mming sound, as if of pleasure, and the vibration around Tony had him gasping for breath, panting.  He could feel his chest heaving, and Steve ran his palm up and down over his hip, as if gentling him.  His hand was so warm.  Tony just—it just felt so good.  He could feel his heart pounding.  And then Steve ran his tongue over him, hot and wet and perfect, and Tony was afraid the sound he made was entirely pathetic.
“Oh, I’m gonna,” Brock growled, almost grunting, “trust me, you big needy slut,” and then he smacked Steve’s cock so hard, between his legs, with the back of his hand, his knuckles, that Steve felt tears come to his eyes as the shock went through him, the pain starting a moment later, as he doubled over, gasping.
Steve’s eyes fluttered, he gulped, once, then again, swallowed, looking down at Tony, his eyes blown, dark, then dragged in a long, ragged breath and fell down to his knees, reaching up with both hands and cupping Tony’s face.  They felt sweaty, and Tony smiled at that, proud that he’d got him that worked up, into it, turned his face and left a red smudge of lipstick against the heel of Steve’s hand with a kiss.  It made him feel warm, glowing, the satisfaction of Steve’s hot flush and glazed eyes and breathless smile, of the taste of Steve’s come on his tongue.  “God, Tony,” Steve gasped.  “That was … that was …” he ran his thumbs gently along Tony’s beard, all soft warm strength, damp and radiating heat against his face.  “That was so good,” he whispered, lashes fluttering, and swallowed again.  “You’re so, you’re so beautiful.”
It actually felt good, that was the thing, soft and good on his throbbing, used asshole, the softly aching, sensitive inner tissues, Steve’s mouth so soft and gentle as it moved over him, his tongue laving inside him, cleaning him up, leaving him dripping and wet and prickling with soft, wet, needy heat.  Tony could see himself in the smudged mirror, now, his own wide eyes behind his mascara and, amazingly, only slightly smudged eyeliner, the slack helpless sag of his open mouth, the deep flush suffusing his face, down his chest, the hot perky peaks of his rouged nipples and tousled hair and disheveled lingerie, the crooked babydoll and soft panties around his thighs and sagging stockings, and his soft cock hanging limp and floppy between his legs, nestling into the panties down his thighs.  Tony moaned, because somehow the makeup, the lingerie, combined to make him look even more fucked out and used, and because he could see Steve’s hands flexing at his hips, on his thighs, see Steve behind him in the mirror, head bent earnestly to his task, feel exactly how earnestly, how deeply, Steve’s warm tongue was cleaning him out inside, licking every trace of Steve’s own come out of Tony’s dripping, well-fucked hole.
“Um, thanks,” Steve managed. He swallowed, bit his bottom lip. Tony winked and reached for his earbuds again.  “Good luck. It was nice meeting you.  Uh, again.  Tony.”
“Tony,” Steve said, laughing.  “Tony, it’ll heal.  It’s just a little chapped, is all, I—”
“Aw, you shut up,” Steve said, laughing as he pulled himself up over Tony’s chest, pressed him down into the bed with his welcome weight, and cupped both hands around Tony’s face.  Tony found himself smiling up into his gorgeous, glorious smile, lifted his arms just enough to link them around Steve’s vast forearms and hang on.  “Just glad you liked it, is all.”  He rubbed a hand up, through Tony’s hair.  “You always do it so nice for me.”
Tony ground his heel down lightly, tapped his toe against Steve’s base once, twice, and he shivered all over at the sudden shock of adrenaline, of fear, of pain that quickly transmuted to pleasure and lit up every nerve in his body until he was prickling and hot all over, alive with vivid sensation just from those little taps.  Tony pressed down again, and Steve gave a strangled noise of pleasure, feeling hot blood flushing to the very tip of his cock, hot with painful pressure as it throbbed under the sole of Tony's foot.  Tears of overwhelming sensation formed in his eyes, and one slipped free, slid down his cheek, leaving a trail that felt shockingly cold against his hot skin.  “Good boy,” Tony breathed.  “You take it so well, baby, so, so well.”  Steve went hot and liquid at the praise, felt something untwist inside of him, because Tony had said he took it well, he thought he took it well.  His thumb circled against Steve’s cheek, brushing away that tear, rubbed gently against his eye, brushing tears away.  Steve knew he’d be holding onto Tony if his hands weren’t bound, would be clinging to his strong forearms or clutching to his hips, curling his fingers clumsily in his belt loops or his waistcoat or his shirt.  As it was, all he could do was sway forward, press his face to his waistcoat, feel the fine weave of it against his hot face.
), but as always, the sight of Tony’s triple axel practically gave Steve an inferiority complex all by itself.  There was just no one else skating who did it like him, and he looked even stronger on it than he had earlier that year.  Any day Steve got to see Tony Stark’s triple axel was a good day. But there was so much more than that. Tony was skating to Frank Sinatra, now, which was a change of program from the exhibition he’d been doing earlier that year.  Steve wasn’t quite sure if he should admit how Tony’s interpretation of the music got him a little hot under the collar.  Tony was
“Nah, I’m the only plumber your
“Yeah,” Tony said, still husky and low and thick.
He moved to straddle Steve, and Steve’s warmth immediately bled into him as Tony spread his thighs out wide, feeling the stretch in his hips as he settled down over Steve’s strong, muscular thighs, his legs.  Steve looked at him, licking his bottom lip, already looking breathless as he ran his hands up and over Tony’s thighs, rubbing gently, massaging against the muscle. “How’s that feeling?” he murmured, rubbing his thumbs deeply into Tony’s muscles, kneading gently but firmly. “You like that, being locked up for me?”
“Apple strudel?” Tony asked without moving his head.  “Pumpkin pie.  Vanilla mousse.  Gingerbread bunny.”  He skimmed his finger around Steve’s ear again, down his neck, walked his fingers down his chest over his belly.  “Eggnog cupcake.  Peppermint frosting.”
“That’s my old-fashioned guy,” Tony said, smiling fondly, and kissed him again.  “Gonna get Jarvis to make you malted milk every year,” he said, against Steve’s bottom lip, and curled his tongue hotly against it, into his mouth.  Steve groaned.  Tony rocked into him, his body all heat and muscle, kissed damp, wet kisses deep into his mouth.  “Make you a malted milk cake for your birthday, red, white, and blue,” he murmured in his ear.  Steve shivered.
“Hey there, fella,” Steve said, feeling his own smile widen.  His voice came out sounding husky and thick, scratchy and low.  He must have dropped off.  That hardly ever happened to him, but, well, he was tired. “Sorry for checking out on you.”
“That’s what I like to hear,” Steve said, and gave Tony two, three, long strokes over the smooth metal, like he would over his cock, leaving Tony shivering with the sensation, vividly aware of the pressure, the whisper of warmth even through the smooth, confining metal.  “That’s perfect, Tony.”  His hands slid back, squeezed at Tony’s thighs, rubbed gently over them, massaged, kneading, at the curves of Tony’s ass, making him shiver again, suck in his breath, at the sensation, the pleasure that sent through him, the way it made his cock throb in the cage.  “I’d like to get you ready to ride me,” he murmured.  “Slick you up, work you open for my cock.  Get that clean little hole all wet with me.  How does that sound to you, Tony?”  He squeezed Tony’s cheeks, pulled them apart, pressed a thumb softly, suggestingly, against the smooth rim of Tony’s hole, still tight despite the long enemas he’d taken that had already relaxed him a bit inside.
“Shhh,” Tony murmured.  “I’ll save the lollipop between your legs for later, hmm?  A special treat just for me.  Biggest one in the whole damn candy store, am I right, peaches?”  Another sucking, biting kiss against Steve’s neck, and Tony’s fingers left him, letting Steve shiver and shake through the aftermath of overwhelmed pleasure, even as Tony’s fingers rubbed over the curve of his pectoral, the others at the back of his neck, over his shoulders.  “I’d say you’re the vanilla to my chocolate,” he murmured in Steve’s ear, fond amusement in his voice, “but we both know you’re not vanilla at all, are you, champ?”  His fingers tugged at Steve’s nipple with each word.  “Not,” tug, “one,” tug, “little,” tug, “bit.”  And his fingers bit inward on a harsh, cruel pinch that had Steve letting out a wild cry of pure pained pleasure.
Tony raised one eyebrow, then smiled again and nodded.
, he’d done a
“Plus, you know, a nasty head wound and bruises all over your face,” Tony said, with a forced little laugh.
“Hilarious,” he said.  He had something in his hand now, a cloth of some sort, and was pressing it against Steve’s head.  It
“You’re good luck for me, too, Winghead,” he said, and Steve must have gone red all over, must have blushed.  He felt hot all over, anyway, even if maybe his slightly burned face hid the flush.  He dropped his eyes, ducked his chin, couldn’t help it.
, Tony.”  He rubbed gently the rim with two fingers now, massaging the tight muscle.  Tony was still just a little open, a little relaxed, from his clean up, and he felt shivery and hot as Steve rubbed wet, slick lube all around and over his sensitive skin, making him feel all the more aware of that part of his body, even as his cock throbbed dully.  Steve tugged at him with his thumb, rubbed it gently over him, relaxing the muscle as he rubbed at it again and again, and then pushed his finger against the tight rim insistent but gentle until it slipped inside.
It was a strange sort of feeling, no direct pressure on his cock, just warmth and friction along his thighs, along the lace of his stockings, hot and humid where Steve pushed up against the crotch of his delicate panties, just tiny little jostles of his balls.  Tony could see himself in the mirror, Steve behind him, and he looked—well, he looked debauched, sweaty, with curly hair hanging over his forehead, mouth swollen and still painted red, though it was sticky and uneven now, nipples hard and plumped up, the rouged buds seeming so obvious through the babydoll every time Steve’s cock thrust between his legs and Tony swayed forward as if helpless against it.  Steve’s cock was visible between his thighs, the big blunt head dripping precome on the floor, sometimes catching the front of the tiny skirt, even as Steve’s hands pushed it up over his ass, held it hitched up around Tony’s waist, and it was strange to see no evidence of his own cock, the skirt concealing the bulge under his garter belt.  Steve’s hands looked huge on his waist, and Tony felt—felt small and delicate and vulnerable and beautifully tousled, wrecked, just there for him to use, for Steve to get off between his thighs.  Sometimes Steve would look up, stare at them both in the mirror, like he couldn’t get enough of what he was seeing, and it would always make Tony feel hot all over, down to his toes.  And then Steve slid his hand up, started rubbing under Tony’s lacy little skirt, against his garter belt, gripping and squeezing and rubbing up and down against his cock, through the girdle and Tony’s panties, making his trapped cock throb, until Tony was panting, gasping and whimpering himself, despite himself, Steve’s hand so hot through the fabric, the friction so startling and hot and bright, so that Tony found himself rolling his hips forward desperately, helplessly, feeling himself leak where his cock was held tight against his skin, somehow loving the helplessness of it as Steve pawed at him and fucked between his tight, straining thighs at the same time, so that he was very aware of the garter straps biting into his skin.
Steve was flushing all right, but he was also stripping his cock desperately, the hot, wet slapping noise of it filling the room.  He was panting, his eyes screwed shut, and Tony knew what it looked like when he was about to come by now, what it sounded like, and those little desperate grunting noises, that
“And it didn’t even come out your nose,” Tony said, on a loopy little giggle he couldn’t seem to help, running his thumb up over Steve’s bottom lip, then his top one, under his nose then up over his cheekbone.
“Now there’s a worrying answer,” Tony said, lightly, but his hands skimmed down over Steve’s back, around his sides, patting down over his hips and up over his chest, as if to check for injuries, and Steve could feel Tony’s body tense under his.
“Mmmph,” Tony said, and kissed at Steve’s thumbs, then leaned down, let Steve draw his face to his.  He opened his mouth, coaxed Tony’s mouth down onto his, and Tony followed his lead eagerly, and then they were kissing, Steve running his thumbs softly over Tony’s cheeks, petting his facial hair with them, stroking gently.  Tony moaned, shifted over Steve, writhing until they were pressed closer together, his hands carding through his hair, shivering and shuddering under Steve’s hands as he coaxed Tony’s tongue into his mouth, rubbed his palms up and down over Tony’s back under the blanket, over his shoulders.  Eventually, Tony pulled away, but only to press another soft, deep kiss to Steve’s lips, then another, then another, playing a teasing game where none of them were quite heated to start building to anything, but all of them smoldered with promise and the deliciousness of tasting Tony, of his breath in Steve’s mouth, the taste of him down his throat.
The soft glow of euphoria—of being used hard and put away wet, of Brock saying he wanted him on a—on a what, more permanent basis?  Of being
“You goof,” he said.
“No, it’s true,” Steve said, deep and sex-rough, raspy and honest.  “Gosh, look at you, you’re so beautiful, you’re so lovely like this, Tony. You love this, don’t you?  Cock all trussed up for me, sweet and obedient and perfect, with me inside you, filling you up.  You love having your cock all locked up for me, giving me your pleasure like that, oh, sweetheart, oh, thank you.  You love it, you’re so lovely like this, so sweet.  Just look at you.”
“I know,” Steve said without thinking.  Wasn’t she supposed to be warming up with Bucky somewhere?
“Careful,” Tony breathed, grabbing at Steve’s hair in helpless pleasure, petting it mindlessly, urging him on.  “Don’t want you to choke.  Feeling so good already, sweetheart.  Natural cocksucker, aren’t you, big guy?  That’s it.  You’re my good, talented cocksucker.”
Of course it was honest, Steve wanted to say, would have said, if he could think straight.  He honestly
“You’re being generous,” he mumbled into Tony’s shoulder, all the same.
“Uh, no,” Tony said.  “I mean, I, uh, God, I sure hope you’re gonna be fine, buddy, but you’re not going right back to the fight.  You broke your arm, hotshot.”
Steve stroked a hand through his hair as he pulled away, slid his hand down Tony’s chest, thumbing gently at his nipple, and Tony shuddered under him, opened his eyes to half-lidded slits because that was about all he felt capable of just then, he felt so dizzy and warm with sensation.  “I want to make you feel good,” Steve said.
Tony narrowed his eyes at him as he pulled away, bent to take off his skates.  “No ego on you at all, is there?” he asked.
about him.
“Y-yeah,” Tony said, self-conscious, on a little self-deprecating laugh, feeling hot all over, flushed.  “I, I guess I am, sugarpie.  It still feels,” he had to lick his bottom lip, take a deep breath, because despite the reduced sensation, the confining metal, it felt
Steve moaned, opened his mouth wider and took Tony deeper into his mouth, made out with his cockhead a little more, let it fill up his mouth, his frankly unfairly long lashes fluttering over his eyes, his face very flushed and his mouth wet and swollen as he let Tony fill up his mouth.
“Oh, Steve, Steve, darling, my dear, handsome, stud,
“Such a good boy,” Steve murmured, reaching out to stroke his palm over the top of it, through the fabric.  Tony shivered, breathed out and let his eyes slide closed.  Steve’s hand was warmer than his, broad and powerful and strong, and he felt the warmth of it even through the cage as he closed it over the cage, Tony’s cock, through the silk, rubbed gently.  “You like this so much.  Did you think about me while you cleaned yourself out?  Are you all nice and clean inside?”
Steve groaned, felt it gurgle in his throat at the angle Tony was holding his head, as Tony flexed his foot again, pressed down a little harder, and pain and pleasure swept through Steve’s body all over again, turning him hot with it, hot from the inside out, red hot.  “Yes, sir,” he breathed, and he could hear the way Tony sucked in his breath, felt the way Tony’s fingers tightened in his hair, against his neck and jaw.  He thought about Tony’s expensive shoes, glanced down to see that expensive black leather shoe smeared with his own fluid, the sole pressed down against the messy hot flushed length of his cock, obscene and huge and purple-red where blood was surging against the thin tissues, messy and wet against the floor, and another desperate whimpering noise tore out of him, his hands clenching helplessly as his stomach pulled tied with desire, with need, just at the sight of it, at his hot, leaking mess contrasted to Tony’s cool elegance.  He felt hot and big, overlarge and ungainly and helpless and messy while Tony was all cool competence and control, standing over him.  He felt helpless, entirely in Tony’s hands.  He knew he was drooling now and couldn’t seem to help it.  His mouth felt very wet.
“And then you can do whatever you like,” Tony said.  “But usually I’d start slow.  You know.  Play with the head—get my tongue in the game.  Flirt with the underside a bit.  Map things out, so to speak, until I’m comfortable with the cock in question.”  Steve was turning even redder, even hotter under his hands, breathing hard.  Tony moved his hand back up to caress his throat, his jaw.  “You don’t want to try to put me down your throat,” he said.  “Not yet.  Give that some time, you know.  Work up to it.”
“Cupcake . . .?” Steve managed, feeling himself go bright red, probably all the way down to his damn toes, which wanted to curl, tucking themselves up against his feet, because of course they did.
Tony’s fingers squeezed at his nipples again, and Steve twitched under his hands despite himself, moaning, even as Tony’s hands came up to brush touches against Steve’s elbows, up and down his arms, down over the underside of his biceps, dropped to trace gently over the insides of his thighs as Steve caught his breath on another gasp.  Tony’s face felt warm against his neck as he murmured, “There, I’ve gotcha, big fella,” and pressed a kiss there, wet and soft just under Steve’s hairline, another behind his ear.  “I’ve gotcha, sweetheart.”  His fingers slid back down, over Steve’s collarbone, tracing it gently, Tony’s thumb circling in a slow pattern over his skin, before his fingertips feathered down over Steve’s pectorals, making him hiss a breath, suck back his own saliva again and bite down on his bottom lip against a moan as Tony’s fingers teased fresh sensation out of the hot, prickling, sensitized skin.  Steve felt so warm, so warm all over, even as his shoulders and rear end prickled and his cock ached, even hotter than the rest of his body, his nipples throbbing and hot and tender and almost numb.  Tony tugged at the weights, teased at the clamps, at Steve’s nipples.  “I bet when I pull these off, you’re gonna come,” he murmured, and bit lightly at Steve’s ear in a way that made him give a helpless wavering breath that was more than half a moan, tilt his head back against Tony’s shoulder as his eyes slipped closed.  He rubbed his fingers into Tony’s hair, massaged them gently into the springy, curling strands, rolled his cheek against Tony’s shoulder.
“Hey!” Tony said.  He tried to reach it with his tongue, but couldn’t.  He shook his finger at Steve.  “Hey!  That’s not fair!  This whipped cream is a delicious masterpiece; don’t waste it!”
“Are you, are you gonna do that?” he managed to ask, and it came out so breathy and hoarse, raspy.
“Not Cap?  America’s Most Valuable Player?  Yankee Doodle Dandy?”
“That’s it,” Tony breathed.  “You still feeling good, there, champ?”
as the best cocksucker in New York State,” Tony added.  “I’ve had plenty of time to pick up little tricks here and there.  ‘Course I put on all the bells and whistles.”  He winked down at him, smiled.  “It’s you.”
“Yeah,” Tony said.  “I said that already, honeybunch, I said—”
Steve nodded, his jaw setting.  He rolled over, shifting himself back, until he was in between Tony’s legs, then scooted forward.  He put both hands on Tony’s hips this time, big and warm and heady, pressing him back gently into the pillows.  “I sure will,” he said, looking up into Tony’s face, all determined sincerity, and then he was pressing Tony’s thighs gently apart and ducking his head down.  He curved both his hands around Tony’s cock and his balls, and then took the head into his mouth again, suckling gently, wrapping his tongue around it, and then going deeper, bobbing his head up and down.
Steve propped himself on one arm on the sofa.  “Did you know, Tony,” he said, “honey, baby, darling, honey bunny,” Tony was looking more and more delighted with each endearment, hugging the plate of cookies and bouncing on his toes, “sugar, darling, dollface, angel, my sweetheart, you are the absolutely most thoughtful, most adorable, most wonderful lover a man could ever have?”
“Hell,” Steve muttered, then swallowed.  He leaned in, pressed a kiss to Tony’s shoulder that made him tremble with a strange heat and more tingling sensation, then to his jaw.  “What if I want to please you?” he asked, gruffly, still not meeting Tony’s eyes.
Oh.  Was that why that side hurt so much?  Steve shifted his eyes over to look, trying not to move his head too much, but the slight movement still made him want to hurl.  And yeah, well, his arm was definitely twisted under him at an unnatural angle.  Clearly Tony hadn’t had to use his genius brain to diagnose that one.
“Oh,” Tony heard himself moan.  “Oh, oh, Steve, Steve, honey, you’re gorgeous, that’s gorgeous, you’re so good.”
This one was another fur flogger, this one made out of Spanish lamb wool fur.  It was softer, woolier, felt like velvet to the touch, plush and a little harder, a little heavier, the leather buffed velvety smooth on the other side.  Still, it was more sensation than anything, with no pain, just a soft poofy thump that would tingle and slide over Tony’s skin, go a little deeper into the muscle.
“That’s it,” Tony groaned out.  “That’s it, that’s just perfect, just how I wanted, slugger, that’s perfect.”
He thought he heard Tony mutter, under his breath, “Oh, sweetheart, that ship sailed a long time ago,” but that . . . couldn’t be right.  Maybe it’d been something like,
“Now, don’t be like that,” Tony said.  “I like you warm.”  He slid his hands onto Steve’s shoulders, rubbed in slow circles.  “You should see the other guys, right?  How many pieces are they in?”
Steve nodded immediately, fervently, not opening his eyes, jolting his head up and down.  Tony found himself smiling, biting his lip, looking down at Steve, running both hands through his hair now, fondness twisting tight and bubbling up inside him until it almost made his throat hurt.
“Okay, so, that’s a strong pulse, that’s good,” Tony was rambling.  “Sensors—let’s see, colder than he should be, yeah, that’s a given, shit—”  Oh, he was—he was brushing Steve’s hair back off his forehead, that was—that was really nice, too, the way his thumb slid along Steve’s hairline, gently, the way he carded the strands back.  “God, that’s a low metabolic rate—brain activity lower than normal—” he hissed between his teeth.  Steve thought,
“How do you want me,” he murmured, pressing their cheeks together, running his hands up and down Steve’s chest, over those hot, heaving pecs, pressing, teasing at those red, flushed, perky nipples, squeezing them between his fingers, rubbing at them. Steve dragged in a harsh breath, shivered under him, hands sliding down, squeezing at the back of Tony’s neck. “C’mon, just let me know, big guy.”
“Get your cock out, darling,” Tony said gently, as gently as he could with his breathing ragged and his voice hoarse with want.  “I want to see.  Can I see?  Will you show me your cock?  Show me how turned on you are?  Show me how hot you are just from my cock in your mouth?  Yeah, you want to, right?  Let me see it, slugger.”
, curling his tongue around the tight little peak until Steve’s whole body felt like it was on fire from sensation coming just from that point, from Tony’s tongue against Steve’s hard, pebbled tip of a nipple.  Tony sucked, played his tongue against the clamp, rocking it back and forth in a way that made the pain tighten, hot and tight and stinging, and pulled off and blew over the skin again, and it tingled cold and then hot, and Steve breathed out in a helpless noise.  And then Tony did it all over again on the other one, and if anything it was even more intense, as one nipple prickled in the cool air against the wetness covering it and Tony’s warm, soft mouth sucked on the other.  Steve whimpered aloud but didn’t realize he had until he heard his own voice, low and soft and wrecked.
