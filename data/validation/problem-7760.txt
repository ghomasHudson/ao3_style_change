Peter’s eyes go back up, focusing on the Goblin in front of him. Slowly but surely, Harry’s face slowly shifts back towards another, familiar and more friendly face. A face that looks as exhausted as Peter is feeling at the moment, with dark circles under the eyes and an unshaven beard on his chin, hair messy and sticking everywhere.
“Sure, lay it on me!”
“Draw me a flower,” Yaël answered dryly, while leaning with her elbow on her desk. Who would think such a brute could draw? He told her he had ‘many years of practice’. She didn’t even bother to reply that she was older than him.
“I don’t know, I think there’s somebody else? I mean, I’ve seen her looking, caught her staring sometimes. I guess she never really got over him and got tired of trying.” Harry then shrugs, being vague about something.
The alarm went off.
“Oh, like old times!” Peter calls out, walking out of his Dad’s reach to join Steve at the table, where he takes the box with his preferable pizza and carries it to the couch. Steve sits down next to him, grabbing the remote control and pointing it at the screen.
Damn…
“Uh, yeah, he kind of saved the man. Peter somehow opened the doors, even though Tony had told FRIDAY not to let anyone in. Why?”
“Uh, yeah that’s good,” he says. Hilde starts dragging Sam along before noticing Tony standing there.
“Yes,” he assures him. Tony clears his throat and nods then, too. He grabs the book closer and starts to stand up again before letting out another sigh. Then he leans back in his seat and shakes his head.
That’s when Ned calls.
“Sir, Spider-Man has been spotted in the city, but according to the sensor the suit is still in Peter’s shared apartment with Mr. Storm.”
“Oh, hopefully not so, no! Although, I’d really like you to be more loyal,” Loki smirked back.
The way he was interested in her normal, daily life, was what made Charles such a sweetheart.
Wait, even Wade knew about it? Why didn’t she- no, no, she shouldn’t get angry about this.
So it’s true…
“Wait, what are you doing?!” the old man panicked as the freezing reached his fingers and made them unmovable. It happened so quick that they didn’t even had the chance to handle against it. Once they were fully frozen and unable to move, Yaël tapped some left over, unfrozen, fluid from one of the guards body and used it to freeze her chains. But she didn’t have enough time as others had heard weird noises and came to check on what was happening.
To say that Peter had been panicking the entire time his body had lain on the ground as if it were dead is an understatement, and to this day Peter still doesn’t understand how the guy had been swinging along with him back then.
Tony has no idea what has been going on with Steve’s team, or with Peter’s. He hardly sees them during the day, maybe just slightly during breaks. They arrive here at nine in the morning, and they leave again at seven in the evening, mostly exhausted – or Tony is, at least. Peter and Steve seem to have better stamina than he has.
“Have you called Steve yet?” she asks.
“Wait, what? What’s going on?” he asks in confusion.
“That’s a good way to go; trying to stand your own in this world. I can admire that, Peter,” Steve tells him, and Peter feels a little bit of shame at the praise. It’s not because he
jetlagged right now, no?
Enjoy!
How is he any different from his father? At least Howard didn’t beat Tony’s mother… Did that make him better than Tony?
“Oh Bruciebear, how I could have used your wisdom right now,” Tony mutters while leaning forward to have a look at a microscope, but unable to place whatever he’s seeing in front of him. That’s probably too old to look like how it’s supposed to look like.
It’s almost nine in the evening when he’s finally crawled his way up to the top floor of Stark Tower. It always takes a few minutes, due to it being a freakishly tall building. The wind’s always a little bit stronger here, too. When he gets to the balcony, he stands in front of the door, pressing his hand against the window and waiting for FRIDAY to respond. When she doesn’t, he groans and pulls his mask off.
It’s only typical for Peter to go to the compound as soon as school is over. Happy is already waiting for him, being as distant as always – Peter just figures it’s more a thing about being uncomfortable around kids and teens rather than him just not liking him. Through the crowded traffic, Happy curses at incompetent drivers once every while. Peter doesn’t point it out, knowing he’ll only be met with silence.
are you wearing?” he put his hands in his pockets after opening his vest because of the warmth. The poor soul always had to wear a costume, being a receptionist in THE Stark Tower. Yaël looked down. Oh, right, her lovey-dovey-act.
“Oh my, I thought these were lost at Oscorp,” May says as she skims through it. “And that
Plane…What the hell?! “Wait, are you going to Berlin?”
“Nah, don’t want to die this evening,” Peter shrugs. Then he takes a pillow from next to him and throws it on Tony, who drops the tablet on his face because of it.
Peter doesn’t complain. He guides her to the apartment. It’s empty as far as he knows, since Johnny’s probably still with the others of his team. The lights are out when he gets in. With a loud sigh, he takes the first few steps, throwing his bag on the couch and taking in the environment around him.
“-course I don’t mind your company, but there’s just some things I like to do alone, Tony. Visiting Peggy  is one of them.”
“Dude, after all the
Right, so what now? Someone probably already called for an ambulance. Yaël walked back to the crashed car and saw Wade, already trying to crawl out of it. Some people were actually puking from looking at his completely disfigured face, which was already healing too. She could hear sirens coming closer.
“FRI, can you call May Parker for me?” Tony asks. “Can you tell her that Peter’s in a tough spot, and that he needs her right now?”
“Doesn’t that hurt?”
“Now give me the other suit,” he says, not clarifying on it. FRIDAY knows what suit he means. And indeed, after he blinks the Iron Spider suddenly stands before him in all its red and blue glory. Tony lets out a huff, suddenly finding himself laughing. It actually worked… he can’t fucking believe it.
problems. Often, Tony finds himself envying them. In a lot of occasions he finds himself wondering to himself what his life would have been like had it been different.
“Steve… you’re not… out, yet, are you?” he asks hesitantly.
“Her brain’s scrambled and she don’t remember a thing,” he explains. Peter then nods in understanding. Sadly, that is one problem he can’t really help with. Then he decides to just… show her that he’s got issues, too, to show her that she’s not alone.
“Uh, guys?” Peter starts, reaching out for his new friend but failing to get her attention. Then, as if the universe is trying to screw with him, a loud explosion disturbs the peace going around here. The figure flying in the air passes right over them, as if he’s trying to taunt Peter.
The night started with Wade showing up at her apartment, carrying a big box and throwing a piece of fabric at her. The piece of fabric happened to be a very open dress, which Yaël didn’t want to wear. But she came to realization that all her clothes without holes in, which weren’t a lot, were in the laundry.
So carefully he takes him into his arms, carrying him bridal style as he brings him to the bedroom. He nods towards Natasha who is in the same position but only headed to the elevator.
kind of muscular, so it’s not
“Come on, Parker,” Peter mutters to himself, shaking his arms and legs a few times before running after the Captain. His heartrate is speeding up the closer he gets, and his fists are clenched so tight that he almost doubts there’s enough blood passing through.
And the craziest part about it? Flash doesn’t instantly start insulting him. Instead, Peter gets to hear a story of Flash’ adoration of Spider-Man, out of all the heroes. Of course, Peter’s only listening in little bits, his attention drawn to Felicia who has somehow also appeared at one point. He grins when he sees Johnny has lost the interest in the art-student, and instead he and Felicia are dancing together. Closely. He averts his eyes when she gives him a long look with those blue eyes of hers.
“Yeah, uh, sorry I didn’t tell you. It wasn’t really a good time to bring it up,” Steve says apologetically. Tony understands what he means; he wasn’t sure if there was even a relationship to mention in the first place.
After that, she’s off into another street, and Peter is left standing there with money in his hands, again. Letting out a long sigh, he decides on where he should be going next. So he jumps up, swinging his way down a few streets until he gets to the bridge.
,” Peter answers. He sounds… distant. Understandable, since he’s taking care of his unconscious father right now. He should be focusing on that, instead. “
The voices are getting louder. Steve holds his breath for a moment when Natasha tells him to be quiet. When the group of people passes them by, she motions for him to move forward again. Quickly, Steve follows her into the garden house.
“Peter, you’re mind is all over the place! You haven’t even hit me
“Ask away, friend,” Thor assures Bruce.
He can’t complain.
“Just came back from working out. Wanted to check on you two, see if everything’s alright,” Steve explains. Peter snorts a little bit, but he puts his stuff down.
“Oh, you mean the friends that don’t force me to use my powers like you did?” Yaël corrected him sarcastically. Yes, she knew he used her to make sure she’d be safe from Thanos, but she still didn’t have to be happy about that. Another shock went through the ship as they got hit again. Yaël tried her best to keep balance.
Yaël sat down and gave Steve his glass. It was quiet for a moment as he stared at her. Not in a creepy way, but it was clear that he was looking for answers.
“No, not about that,” Loki waved his hand. “What do you mean with being together in the past?”
“Call her up. Maybe I can come by a bit earlier,” Tony mutters. He starts up the car at last, turning the wheel while hitting the accelerator and moving forward. In his rear window he can see Fury look as jhe drives off.
, his mind tells him. Tony automatically puts a hand on the man’s cheek, slowly caressing his skin as their eyes make contact.
tinkering around in the workshop. So he surprises everybody and their mother when he asks Liz as his date.
“How do I know this isn’t a suicide-mission? You know she’s dangerous, Yaël!” X answered sternly.
He closes his eyes, tries to sleep. It doesn’t come. He hears the machinery from all the rooms around him. The nurse of the night walks around, controlling all of her patients. She comes into his room once in a while to check his parameters, or change his IV bag. Tony can count it up to three times until he figures that it’s morning again. Feeling exhausted, he wonders why he couldn’t sleep. It’s not like he hasn’t been trying, but his mind is just too full.
“Johnny, I’m a little busy at the moment!” Peter calls out.
Thor gasps, pretending like he's insulted. Hilde and Bruce roll their eyes as he starts up another explanation on how there's no way they could win from them. Nobody listens anymore, instead waiting for Tony to pull up the boxes and open them.
“He thinks it’s too high a risk,” he explains. Peter nods, looking down at his hand fidgeting in the covers.
“Give it to me,” she said, while signing with her hand after he told her he saved the fragment on his phone, but hadn’t dared to watch it yet. She sat down onto the bed, next to him and held the phone in front of them so Peter could see the screen too. “Then we’ll do it together; I don’t remember much of it, either,”
“I love you, Peter. You do know that, right?” he asks. Peter puts his head on Tony’s shoulder and closes his eyes.
be a criminal. And he’s sure Tony’s already working on fixing this.
The day is filled with laughter. More so than Peter could have imagine having after the crappy way he’s been feeling yesterday. Aunt May takes a lot of pictures, and they watch the parade and fireworks in the evening.
“Normally I would hate asking help from others, but you might be right,” Tony mutters. He taps towards the screen, copying the files into a large message and addressing it to King T’Challa’s younger sister and Reed fucking Richards. “Any other smart people on our list?”
Once Mr. Stark returns with a steamy cup that smells a lot like a hot chocolate, Peter takes it over with lightly shaking hands, offering the man a small smile in gratitude.
Peter and Harry caught up, but Peter wasn’t aware that his friend was sick; the same sickness that had befallen Norman Osborn. The thing that had killed him. They talked about lots of things, Peter told him about Gwen. Meanwhile, at Oscorp, a man called Max Dillon died in a tragic accident. Only, he didn’t die as much as he was reborn. Panicked at his sudden ‘electric’ state, he started wandering around on time’s square. Peter tried to calm him down, but after a while the guy freaked and went crazy.
Ah, well, at least for an hour people will be rid of the annoying Deadpool, Peter figures. But that doesn’t remove the fact that, right now, nobody’s driving.
“It’s fine, just sensitive,” Peter mutters to him. Johnny gives him a worried look before turning back to the door of the elevator. Is it him, or is this ride downstairs really long? Peter glances to the side before slapping his forehead.
Peter swallows, forcing himself to walk forward a bit, but still not arriving at the door before he stops himself once more.
“Alright, now I’ll tell you one,” Peter returns. “How does a crazy person travel through the woods?”
“I don’t know what to do… How do I fix this? How do I fix myself?” Steve sounded frustrated.
Tony glares at his best friend, biting down the strong urge to punch him in the face. He ignores the sad looks he gets from the others, feeling only so close to kick everybody out.
It scares him, but more than that it breaks his heart; knowing that his son has so much going on inside of him and that Tony can’t help him even though he wants to so much.
“No!” Peter starts, shaking his head. The tears are threatening to fall down, but he still keeps them back. “No, no, no! Please!”
“I don’t really know if we actually were together or not,” Yaël said carefully, trying to fix the mistake she just made. “And now we’re not.”
But to make it worse, other members of the Avengers have joined. Not all of them, but he can still see Sam and Clint, with Scott next to them. Natasha’s there, too, though without Bucky. To make it worse, there’s a whole crowd of people standing there as well.
for him.
But what good will that eventually do? To postpone it does not equal to avoid it. He can’t help but sigh, eyes closing when the first drop of rain lands against the window he’s staring through. His eyes go down for a second, landing on the burn-mark the Bifröst left when Thor decided to go home a while ago. He wonders how the guy is doing at the moment, but he’s probably better than Tony…
, you know it’s urgent,” Steve retorts for the fourth time as well. Now dressed in his full uniform, he’s the exact opposite of Tony, who is standing there buck-naked.
Dr. Cho had been surprised, indeed, but she accepted the sample without any question and with the promise that she’ll have answers in fourteen days. They agree on him returning here when the day comes, and then he’s off, finally getting out of the building.
“No thanks to you,” Tony says lowly.
“I’m fine, kid,” Tony assures him.
And that thought leads him back to the Black Cat. What is it she wants from him? Does she want… she couldn’t want to just sleep with him, right? She doesn’t even know him, nor know what he looks like! She just wants to know him better so she can outsmart him. That’s probably it.
“Michelle,” Harry mutters, still staring at her when she takes her place at the table. She gives Peter and Ned a questioning look, but they just shrug.
“Give me a minute, alright?” he asks. Bruce lifts up his thumb. Ned, Harry and MJ carefully join Bruce into the elevator. When Bruce makes a joke about not getting him angry right before the door closes, Ned’s face turns awfully pale. Peter ends up laughing the moment he sees it.
(See the end of the chapter for
That was when he met Sam for the first time. The guy had been funny, kind, and easygoing. And after Natasha picked him up, she had looked at Steve with a raised brow.
“What is this place, Tony?” Steve asks, a little confused. Tony doesn’t say anything. Their hands are still tied together, and before they know it, they’re standing in an open room, filled with people dancing like their lives depend on it. Everybody in the darkened room is laughing, the spotlight continuously falling on whatever couple is dancing in the center.
Fuck, shit, crap. This isn’t what he needs. Tony hurries into the elevator and keeps his head down. Finding a pair of sunglasses in his inner pocket of the jacket, he quickly fishes it out and puts it on.
Steve then nods. “Right,” he mutters out, running in the direction Tony remembers the suits are located. He’s extremely aware of Fury looking at him suspiciously, but he tries to ignore it.
“FRI, still no sightings of Spider-Man?” Tony asks again, probably for the fifth time already since he came down here. After realizing the boy had left the building, he and Steve had put their argument on hold. Instead of continuing it and talking it through, Tony just locked himself in his workshop after failing to bring Peter back home.
“Tony! Stop messing around! Get the drinks out of the fridge!” Tony holds his hands up in the air in surrender.
“Listen, I don’t know what you want, but-“
Yaël didn’t even had the chance to react before it happened. Smooth and quickly, Nilla slit Raido’s throat.
And Tony’s breath catches, because that’s the voice of Mary Fitzgerald.
He’s not surprised that Ross refuses to listen to him when he came up with the facts. Ross doesn’t care about proving Barnes’ innocence. All he wants is him behind bars. Tony is not going to try to change his mind. He knows his facts, and knows, right now, what the right thing to do is.
May looks at Tony, who is still holding the journal in his hands. Steve is still next to him, equally silent. Before Strange can continue, Tony gets on his feet and approaches the sorcerer-slash-neurosurgeon.
Peter kneels down next to him, pressing his finger against Tony’s neck to search for a pulse. When he finds one, he lets out a relieved breath. Then he starts shaking him, ignoring the stench of puke around him.
As soon as she run into her room, she slammed the door behind her and locked it. Her breathing went sharply and felt like a state between sobbing and hyperventilating. She ripped the bags open and pulled out a bottle of whiskey. Her hands were shaking so heavily, the liquid dripped out of the bottle as soon as she pulled off the packaging and the cap off.
Peter nods, though he doesn’t verbally respond. As the screens finally change from some other generic trailer or another random movie to an actual news report, Peter can see smoke and flames rising up in the air.
Peter shrugs, unable to hold back his own grin.
Just don’t.
“Peter” he asks, wondering why the teenager would be calling again so soon.
Peter frowns. He doesn’t know what that means. Or maybe he does, but he doesn’t want to understand it. That would mean it’s reality.
“Oh, hurray,
“And you still have no idea why that is?” Peter shakes his head.
“Did anyone ever tell you how glorious your hair looked back in the days?” she grinned while staring at his locks.
Peter is almost sure his mother has something to do with this – despite the fact that she’s been dead for years. Perhaps Mr. Stark sees a lot of her in him, or maybe he just wants to protect her only living son. In any way, Peter’s not going to make any remarks about that. It actually comes in quite handy, when it comes to his plan to get to know the man.
“Michelle, hi,” Peter says, not really
“I mean, I have the proof if you want to see it?”
“Heh, yeah, I kind of scared myself too…” she mumbled, thinking about watching herself getting buried.
“Your woman did well against Hela!”
“I know! Get there!” he snaps back. There’s no time to be kind right now. His son’s life is on the line! He can’t even afford to be sad about all the corpses he has to run over. They can mourn about that later.
“So it seems,” Natasha said with a light smile. “Tony’s in bed.”
Bruce shrugs. “That’s the problem, I suppose. Maybe she shouldn’t.”
“Wade, I’m pretty sure Cable isn’t going to be happy you took his watch,” Charles chastises him, though only barely.
Steve chuckles nervously. “Yeah, I guess he did,” he mutters out. Tony snickers behind the suit, letting out a little gasp of surprise when Steve yanks at his arm to make him stop.
Perhaps too strong. Too sticky.
Thanks for the sweet comments and kudo's! I always smile whenever I get a notification. It really helps me through this story! Big virtual hugs to you all <3
“Tony, you need to get out of here!” Steve suddenly shouts. Tony hadn’t heard him come back.
“Yes, he did,” Mary manages to lie eventually, though she’s clearly still taken aback. She walks up to where Tony figures Richard’s desk should be. There she grabs a file. “He said that he would get it tomorrow but I needed to get out of the house for a bit and thought I could grab it.”
Peter gets up again, reaching out for it. MJ stops it.
“I’m betting I could beat that,” Tony adds, attempting to lighten the mood.
“Hello, how are you?” he asked her kindly.
Peter admitted. Yaël sighed.
Peter only realizes he’s fallen asleep when he wakes up much later; the window indicates that it’s already night, showing a darkness in the sky from outside and the millions of city lights from all the buildings. New York never really sleeps, after all.
Peter listens, following Happy through a small hallway that leads to an open space with large windows. In the middle there’s a table with a case resting on it. Peter wonders how he was supposed to find it on his own?
“Peter? I thought you wouldn’t call me anymore,” Steve admits. Natasha hisses at him that he needs to hang up now, but Steve waves her off. He hasn’t had a chance to talk to Peter in a long while, he needs to hear what’s going on.
“So, what, you came here to rip them a new one?” Peter asks. He starts walking forward towards the couch, dropping down on the three-sit. He’s not too surprised that it’s actually very comfortable. All too aware of Natasha staring him down, Peter clears his throat again.
She doesn’t really look at him as she takes out a few papers from the envelope. Peter wonders why she’s stalling this; wouldn’t she know the answers right now? Does she really need to go through these with him?
Peter sags back against the tree. His vision is once again cleared, and the first thing he sees are the deep brown eyes of Tony Stark.
The bot whirs after getting an instruction. He rolls away towards the little kitchen-space to get to work. Tony doesn’t look at it. He passes his hands over his face, taking another deep breath. Has it really already been fifteen days since his fight with Peter?
“Uh, yeah, it’s a bit complicated. We speak two languages, but in our dialect, we mix those two,” Yaël scratched her head, how could she remember the two/three languages she spoke, but not the name of the planet she came from? “One language is a specific one from our planet itself. The other one is Norwegian.”
* Yaël sighed, why was she even trying?
“Hell, no! I’m doing this!” he returns. Harry snorts and nods. As Peter starts to explain where he currently is, he hears something in his ear. It’s Rhodey and May.
“That may be so, but c’mon, we’ll be late for the fundraising! You know Pepper will kill us if we’re not there in time.”
“And the team wants to talk to you,” Natasha adds.
She felt Peter stare at her.
!’ and right when I thought he would refuse, do you know what he says?”
“Don’t you dare spoiling it!”
“Guys! I was searching around for a Christmas present for Tony but I don’t have any ideas! What do you buy somebody who can afford anything?”
He’ll get a chance to talk to Peter later. First he needs to fix the ship.
Susan is sitting next to Reed. Despite her husband being distracted with whatever is shown on the screen of their laptop, their hands are still holding. Reed has just always been one to keep his eyes behind a screen. At first Sue minded, but after a while she learned to work with it. Now, she has her way to distract the man.
“What did he mean with us having some ‘catching up to do’?” Peter asked curiously as they walked back to the gate.
Chapter warnings:
"Right, that's what you- right, okay, God, Jesus fucking Christ..."
“How is he?” she asks calmly. Tony gives her a sad look while shaking his head.
Tony turns around in confusion, seeing the pensive look on Mary’s face. He’s about to ask what she means when she continues.
If Tony notices his change of behavior, he doesn’t point it out. Instead, after they’ve gone out of the elevator, he just squeezes Peter’s shoulder and heads for the kitchenette.
“My brain’s like a computer now. Just trying to make a connection,” he explains curtly. He squeezes his eyes shut while he tries to go through the last bit of effort. It’s almost like there’s a ‘ding’ going in his head when he succeeds.
“No, I want to stay in school, I just… I needed to talk to somebody,” he assures Tony. “I’ll be fine, just… can you tell me something? Doesn’t matter what.”
Michelle then picks up her bonnet and ties the scarf around her again. She gives Peter a long look.
Looking at the yellow, happy flowers, Tony can’t help but smile. He can recognize Steve’s style in there immediately. It’s in the perfect, neat lines, the little attention to detail. Tony loves everything about this artwork, even if it’s public property.
Felicia starts walking next to him, fishing Peter’s book out from his arms and reading up on the front page.
Wade pulled her out of her thoughts. “Yeah, or Sweden or Austria or wherever the fuck you come from.”
Peter is surprised at his own acting.
“I CAN HEAR YOU TWO!” Tony shouts from in the bathroom. Peter laughs, jumping up from his seat and getting to the cabinet to take a glass for his own. After filling it with a bit of coke, he sits down on the stool, watching the tablet sparkle up the water.
“Who’s MJ?” Peter asks.
Iron Man counters to the Captain’s sudden outburst.
I didn't have the chance to post last week, so I'll be posting two chapters this week instead :)
“That’s a lame nickname, must be a lame guy.”
“Well, Barnes here said it’s you, while Clint says it’s Steve,” Sam explains, pointing towards the two men. Tony crosses his arms together, nodding.
Tony throws her a glare, but decides not to act on it again. They’re here to talk things through,
The three wince for a moment, but then Clint jumps back up.
“Which he didn’t know at first,” Ned points out, while literally pointing his egg roll Peter’s way. “You got yourself back up on your own.”
“Call Steve,” he says, or he thinks he says it. He’s not too sure. He repeats the ‘call’ gesture once again, nodding towards Johnny. The boy nods, putting on the mask and walking to the side. Peter smiles despite himself, dropping back down on the ground and putting his hands on his stomach.
“A business-talk? Haven’t had those since you grounded me,” Tony mutters, knowing he’s being a bit childish about that, but in all honesty, he doesn’t really care about it.
“You love Steve, don’t you?” he asks. Tony’s eyes then move up to Steve, who is trying to make himself look small next to Peter. Without daring to look up, he starts fumbling with his fingers. Peter reaches out to stop him.
“What do you mean? You’re not with them?” Peter asks.
“Oh, hi, Peter. When did you get here?” he asks, though not standing still to talk to him but instead heading to the kitchenette. There he fills Tony’s glass again, heading to the medication drawer and picking out a good painkiller that matches with the current pharmaceutical therapy he’s following.
He can’t face him; not now. Too much has happened. Even looking at Steve’s face and realizing that he’s the one that brought that blood there…
“Do you require my help?”
“The guy probably quit. Don’t worry, we’ll get him back on the scene,” he says, sitting himself back down on the chair before throwing another item of clothing to Peter. As he catches it, the shirt around him goes back into tent-mode. “Now try on the pants!”
They’re arguing again. Peter can hear it through his door, hear them shout at each other. Usually it’s about stupid things; who left the toilet seat up, who forgot to hang up the laundry… It’s always something silly like that.
The day Michelle Jones accepts Harry’s proposal to go on a date is the day Peter thought he would have seen elephants fly. By that, he means that he would never have thought it to happen, but yet, it still does.
“Nothing could make you look
“I’m pretty sure Steve loves that.” Pepper has this fond look on her face. “But, Tony, I’m sorry about what I said earlier. About Peter…”
He tinkers a bit with some devices he brought along to pass his time. He has a phone call with May, tries to contact Peter but fails to catch him. It’s school, he tells himself. Peter won’t pick up. There’s an update from Vision, who says he’s going through all the past sightings of the weapons. It’s a shame they don’t have any facial visuals on the Vulture.
“Sure,” Peter says, not really believing the tough-girl act she’s trying out here. “So you know him, or…?”
"Well, I think you remember enough for today. "
Steve joins Thor to a secluded room. He squeezes Tony’s shoulder to indicate that he’ll be back. Tony just waves at him.
“You told me once this is where you and Bucky used to go when you were younger. You also once said to me that these flowers on the door were actually painted by you, though it looks like they’ve been repainted a little while back.”
“Right, not that it wasn’t fun to catch up and all, I really feel like I need to go to sleep now. “
It’s a never-ending battle. Whenever Peter thinks he’s almost got it, he just ends up right back at the beginning with an even worse headache for it. His last fight isn’t helping him, and after a few minutes his back is already aching, still not healed from the hard blow he’s gotten during that battle with him and one of Hammer’s rogue androids – and of course he got another warning from the Avengers, telling him to stay away from the danger.
“Bless you, young lady. Bless you.”
“Because of our son, right?” he asks carefully, feeling a little bit smug when he sees her open her eyes in surprise.
Peter starts walking around in the room, trying to take a good view of everything there is. He can see some sort of prototype for one of Widow’s weapons – Peter doesn’t know how it’s called. A bit further there are a pair of Falcon’s wings, but these obviously took a beat, damaged in combat. Peter wonders if it’s a result from fighting the Goblin.
“It happened years ago!”
Here we go! I don't know what came over me, but something towards the end of the chapter came out of my fingers before I even really realized it. I never intended to go that way when I wrote down the baseline of the story, but on the other hand it made perfect sense to me.
He smiles before he can think better of it. His finger passes over her face, so close to his on the photo. Instantly, Peter wishes they ware a bit more in the future, where he could just invite her over without it being awkward.
“He’s awake, just his typical self, I would say. A bit annoyed that a teenager managed to hack FRIDAY somehow, of course,” Steve says with a laugh, but Peter sees that it doesn’t reach his eyes. Steve looks exhausted, to say the least.
“That’s strange, your beliefs never laid with Jesus.” Yaël turned her head. There he stood, not Steve, but the black-haired man. He was wearing some kind of brown, worn cloak which covered his whole body, so she couldn’t see what else he was wearing underneath. She couldn’t even see his feet by the length of the thing. Yaël had the feeling that Steve wouldn’t enter these kinds of dreams anymore now that she remembered him.
Yaël breathed on deeply and rubbed the palm of her hands against each other. It had been a long time since she had done this, from before the accident. She sped up and as she breathed out again, she opened her hands. At that exact moment she steered a massive amount of fire against the glass wall.
“He’s going to be out of school for a while,” May suddenly says as Tony is starting to nod off. The man looks up, seeing May still staring down at Peter in concern. In agreement, he nods.
“You’re even ready faster than Tony,” she says with a wink. Peter snorts, not really surprised about that. The fact that Tony has been needing a serious shave and haircut, he can figure that it would have taken a bit more time. MJ is the next one to walk out. It’s weird, seeing her so much fancier than normally. Her wild hair is straightened out, her normally baggy clothes replaced by slim dark pants and a white shirt with on top of it a black coat. She gives Peter a wink before sitting down again and taking her book. Peter smiles back at her, feeling a sudden urge to kiss her but keeping himself from doing that.
Steve lowers his head but nods in agreement. Tony rolls his eyes, leaning his head forward until it’s resting against Steve’s chest, giving him a reassuring hug. Without speaking up, he lets FRIDAY order the usual for them.
“I CAN’T!” Tony shouts back, grabbing his arms and softly shaking him. Then he lowers his head until the top of his skull is resting against Steve’s chest. “I fucking can’t.”
“Of course, you did,” Loki let out a bit dryly. And with that, he pulled his knives and slid through the first zombie that stormed towards him.
“Things are crap, but you know that I guess,” he finally says. And then he starts talking. About his youth, his father talking about Captain America as a way to get Tony to do the right thing. How his Dad, after a while, decided that Tony wasn’t worthy of being compared to Steve. How Tony hated Steve from that point on, until they
After getting some fancy clothes pushed into his arms, the team leaves Peter’s room to give him a bit of privacy. Peter carefully changes, trying not to make wrinkles in the clothes. It’s not a suit, really, but it’s still formal in a way. Peter is at least glad there’s no tie. He gets into the living room and shows his look to the people there. Pepper, especially, seems pleased. She hands him a pair of dark sunglasses (the sun is shining brightly) and gives him a thumb’s up.
“C-can you give me some water, please?” Yaël asked, her voice sounded hoarse, like she had been screaming all day. The man looked down and frowned thoughtfully.
His shift goes along well enough, going from seven until ten. It’s not much work, but at least it’s a little income he can offer Aunt May.
for Steve, for Peter.
“FRI?” Tony asks.
“It’s alright, man,” he says. It’s not true, of course. Whatever happened, Harry has something to do with it. And if Peter doesn’t want to alarm him, he needs to keep this in check and make sure Harry doesn’t find out. After all, he doesn’t remember anything about that night.
Peter’s a little sad when they have to leave again after the fireworks, but seeing as it’s a school day tomorrow, they have to leave now. It’ll already be past midnight when they return home, and he needs to get at least a little bit of sleep.
“No clue. When I asked Tony about it, he said it didn’t matter since everything turned out alright anyway. He was being very shady about it.”
“I just want to inform you that I’m going to play dumb as I already lived through this scenario once and I still remember all of it, just so you can see this memory as it happened.”
Peter obeys, allowing Natasha to guide him to where he needs to go. When she points to a whole group of people sitting there, looking deep into discussion, he frowns.
“Don’t tell me you don’t want my son to play?” he asks with a smirk. Clint and Sam both shut their mouths, while Scott just leans back in his chair and waves his hand.
What he doesn’t expect is for Captain America himself to open the door.
Wade lost his senses, Yaël was sure about that. Why would that freaking psycho start shooting at this boy?! With a few steps, Yaël put herself and her shield in front of Peter. Yaël checked on the teen, hoping he wasn’t hurt. Her mouth fell open and she stared at him, hanging on a wall like he pasted his hands and feet to it.
Giving Ross a playful smirk, he knows he’s gotten himself out of this one for now. Keeping eye-contact with the former General, Tony waits until the chopper is back into the rainy sky before relaxing completely. Pulling the mitella off, Tony counts down ten more seconds before taking a deep breath.
Getting to his chopper, he’s followed by a suspicious looking Thaddeus Ross, who is doing the exact opposite of laughing.
With Tony out of the country for some Stark Industries-stuff, Peter is spared from the warning he was no doubt going to get at the mention of going to a party.
She shakes her head as well.
“But you’re just so… passionate. You care about Sharon, you care about your inventions. You care about your children, even though they don’t like you all that much. I’ve seen you with your daughter and it warmed my heart, Tony, I-“
“You can’t go, Steve. It’s too dangerous!” Clint throws in.
“Where you’re from?”
“I SHOULD PUT YOU IN AN ENORMOUS BLENDER AND LET YOU DIE AGAIN AND AGAIN FOR ETERNITY!” Yaël poked against his chest while barking.
Peter remembers the conversation he’s had with Felicia about it. After running into her somewhere in the evening, he asked her if she wanted to join the group.
“Right, I get it, the other me is an ass. I guess being kidnapped and held captive in a cave, forced to build weapons, was at least good for something…” Tony snaps. He’s a bit tired at the accusations he keeps on getting. It’s not
“Thanks,” Peter climbed out of bed, grunting a bit from being sore. Yaël nodded, watching him move carefully. Did he want her to help him or not? What did she need to do in such a situation? Maybe he’d rather get out of bed on his own, or maybe it’d be kind of her to support him or something… So instead of doing anything at all, Yaël kept staring at him awkwardly, relieved as he finally got out. Besides, that slight scruff he got going on was kind of fascinating. It had always been hard to imagine Peter with facial hair.
So he stayed in his year, his parents agreed. And when they died, there had been nobody in his class that came to comfort him. At least, nobody but one individual.
“I’m not gay,” Steve defends himself almost too quickly. Tony shakes his head.
It’s been a while since he’s had a good morning lie-in. Last time he woke up next to Steve… heck, he can’t even remember it. Living together, that’s not really a thing you think about; when will it be the last time?
A hand snitched away the phone as soon as she started typing. “Could you at least make the effort to act like you’re interested? I’m not drawing flowers because I like it, nor because I like you.”
Steve just looks at Mr. Stark with a strange expression, and then starts walking towards the door without saying anything. But right before he gets to the door, he turns around again.
Peter almost literally jumps up out of his seat. Sure, his dad might have become the chief of the ‘protect-Peter-squad’, but he would allow at least this, right? Excited, Peter nods, grabbing his books and dropping them in his bag.
“Yes, very, very much so, yes.”
Yaël shakes her head. “Actually, Steve did. Told me you’ve hit a rough patch. For a long time they weren’t even sure you would come along.”
’ but they had been together, in a way.
“Tony, I know you’ve hit a rough spot right now, but you can’t keep doing this to him,” Pepper finally says in a lower volume. Tony doesn’t look up, just shakes his head while keeping his eyes on the floor. “Where’s Peter? I thought you said he came home?”
Tony takes a few seconds of silence. A few scientists pass them by with their small monitors in their arms. A few people in scrubs and isolation-masks approach the crash-site again. As they perform their inspection, Tony turns around, slapping Fury gently on the back.
After Happy drops him off, the chauffeur opens the door for Peter and starts walking away again without saying anything to him. Peter just shakes his head before grabbing his bag and throwing it over his shoulder. It rained a bit earlier, so the grass is still wet.
“It’s for of the lighting and the video footage,” she explains shortly without really explaining anything. Steve frowns, but he doesn’t speak up again after that. Eventually, the hosts come walking in. They’ve had contact with them a lot in the past few days, but never really has a program for the evening been announced to them. They said they would tell them the day itself.
It’s Sharon Carter, the grand-niece, who comes to them first. Not really knowing anything about Peter, she gives him a short nod before grabbing Tony and pulling him into a strong hug. Tony, who has been composed for the entire ceremony, ends up letting out a few tears against her shoulder as the emotions suddenly get the better of him.
And so, Tony starts explaining. He talks and talks, taking a couple of seconds once in a while to find his words. He notices Peter looking at him with hard, wet eyes, mouth stuck in that grim stance. And once he explains about everybody's deaths, Peter's death, Tony hears Peter gasp for air next to him, seeing him sitting there with tears in his eyes. It’s only then that Tony realizes he’s been crying as well.
in this relationship,” James says, pointing up a finger and hissing when Natasha slaps it away again.
Peter knows better, of course; he’s spent until almost midnight to clean up the Penthouse – despite FRIDAY telling him not to do it – and only stopped when a furious Aunt May called him back up, in search for him.
The three of them laugh, and then Peter goes to give Harry a strong hug.
“Bruce told me something… about the serum. You don’t want it anymore, don’t you?”
Steve stays quiet for a few seconds. Then, he closes his eyes, lowers his head and nods.
And that’s when Peter realizes there
Yaël walked to her little fridge. “What do you want? I have water, or beer, or… oh jeez, this milk is bad news, yo!” She threw it in the bin. “I also have orange juice!”
Peter manages to sneak in Yael room for about an hour. He’s followed by Wade and Wanda, and the four of them are seated on the ground with dessert room-service brought along with countless of drinks. And Yael talks, about where she’s been. And it all sounds extremely weird. The fact that it almost completely matches Bruce’s story is indication enough that she’s not lying. There’s stuff she’s not saying, but nobody asks after it. She’ll say it on her own time. After she finishes, Wade starts talking, too. Bringing up a story about another one of his small adventures with Logan somewhere in Spain. How they got there, he’s yet to clarify. It leads to lots of laughter and tears in the eyes.
“Uh, sure,” Steve had muttered, gesturing at Sam that he would need a few seconds. Sam had waved back, starting to look inside the room for further clues. “What’s wrong?”
“Of course!” Tony’s cousin almost shouts, happy that she’s getting the chance to help out. Tony and Bruce stand up simultaneously, though Tony has to hand his tablet over to Bruce so he can take his crutches in hand. Together, they leave the living room behind them, getting back to the elevator to get to the workshop.
“You went to space?” Peter asks, a bit surprised at that bit of information.
“You know about me?”
Yaël was actually the one he wanted to hang out with. It’s been a little while since he last saw her (that must be when she came to his house with ice cream and the old Superman-movies back when he was still stuck at home with his wound).  The fact that she’s not answering makes it clear to Peter that, while she’s been there to look after him, he hasn’t really done the same for her.
It lasts for too long. Even with the small toilet breaks X requested (probably after having read too many thoughts), Peter feels like he’s about ready to climb up the walls. Literally, with the next break he’s running towards the side of the room and climbs up until he’s hanging over the ceiling.
were the one who ended up in danger when that robot mistook you for him because of that stupid mask.”
“Okay, I promise,” Ned assures him, still not sounding entirely keen on what is coming next. And then Peter starts talking. He explains
“Eh, I kind of, eh, had this dream-“ aaand she went with the dream-story, great. “It was about a man I think I should know, but I actually don’t know him at all. Okay, that sounded crazy, but I-“
How did Harry escape? Who helped him? Where was he planning on going?
“Admit it, Tony. You don’t like him patrolling in the evening.”
Just as he’s about finished with putting together a few requirements he has for the new… suit… FRIDAY’s voice comes up again, causing for Tony to jump up.
“Ooh, look at this dress!” Wade said as he pulled out some skimpy, deep blue dress. Well, actually, it wasn’t that reveling, it just looked like an extremely tight dress.
Eventually the man knocks his stick against the bars.
“Yes, you, in your thoughts, five times already in the two days we’ve been communicating like this,” he answered her a bit dryly, trying hard to hide his own grin. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d say you’re flirting with the five-decades-younger-version of me.”
“So, uh, these accords. I heard you signed them, Vision?” Peter asks. Yaël looked up. Did he, now?
Tony never knew of her death; it had reached the newspapers, but Tony had been in the rehabilitation back then to get over his depression. Nobody told him about it afterwards because nobody’d think he cared.
“You have a kid, right? Liz, if I’m correct?”
Out of the blue, with a weird sounding shriek, Miek started moving again and woke up.
“You’ll see. I won’t spoil the surprise,” Tony says with a grin. Then he gives him a pat on the shoulder and leads him out of the little room. The suit disappears again into the column. The windows slide back close.
He never dated a girl called Stacy. He would remember that, wouldn’t he?
“I’ll get’ya a new one,” Tony mumbles next to him. Peter shakes his head quickly, protesting immediately.
Then Peter is swinging away. But he’s not going fast enough this way. So he drops down on the first car that he sees arriving at the school. There might be a bit of smugness when he sees it’s Flash. Remembering the Batman movies, Peter scrapes his throat, masking his voice.
Peter stays quiet. He knows that he got the vaccine when he was a kid, but that’s about it. Nobody really talks about these kinds of diseases, so he knows close to nothing about it.
“Right, so, once Loki gets everything back in order, Thor throws a big feast to celebrate the victory. That’s actually when he announced Jane’s pregnancy. It was all really nice.”
Peter looks up in surprise, seeing Mr. Stark pointing at him but not looking, staring Steve right in the eyes. It’s Steve who turns his head to catch a glance on Peter, noticing immediately that Peter must have heard. It can’t be too hard to see; the teenager feels that his eyes are wide, that his mouth has fallen open, that he’s sitting up straight like anybody who just heard something shocking.
Peter waits for Karen to hang up on the call before letting out a long breath. His heart is still beating fast, but this time for a whole different reason. He can’t believe
“We are all different paths, different memories you can chose to follow. You can choose who you want to follow tonight.”
“Maybe it was my fault, I left you, maybe it was my fault what happened afterwards…” Yaël didn’t know what he was talking about, but she shook her head and whispered.
“Now Harry tells me I have to ask her to senior prom! He’s out of his mind!”
“Yes, the weather is particularly hot today,” T’Challa agrees when he sees Tony adjust his wardrobe. Before they can walk outside, a person (a butler?) hands both of them a bottle of water. T’Challa thanks the man in his native language, and he gets a bow of the head in return. Tony watches it happen, and then he takes a grateful swing of his bottle. The two start walking again afterwards.
“HEY!” somebody shouts. Peter turns his head to the source of the sound, only to have a boot kicked in his face. Peter lets go of his web, smashing against a building and dropping down on the ground. Luckily, he wasn’t too high up, though the drop still hurts like hell.
“Oh, you’re hurting my feelings, Peter!” Clint counters, lifting a hand to his head dramatically. Scott uses the moment of distraction to his benefit. “Say do you have any ideas as to what we could do for team-activities?”
“C’mon, can’t you just make an exception this one time?” he tries. He can’t just do the thing without at least trying to convince her to get him off the hook.
“You have any suspicions as to why she would break up all of the sudden?” Peter tries, ignoring this feeling inside of him. Harry sighs dramatically.
“No!” Peter shouts in panic before pointing his hands in the direction of the device and sending a web to it in the hope that it’ll stop the fall. At the same time the goon picks him up and throws him towards the wall, causing for the phone to swing into the air and land somewhere even further.
FRIDAY says. “
“This is for killing my uncle,” Peter hisses towards him, ready to throw the final blow. That’s when he realizes he’s been hearing voices all around him.
“Yeah, I mean, why wouldn’t I? I want everybody to know how hot my boyfriend is by agreeing to do it, you know?”
Tony remembers all too well how that woman almost literally kicked his ass back at that café. Without his own armor to protect him, he’d been sure he was done for. Still, he can’t believe he actually made it out of that mess.
“No, no, no, Steve, you don’t understand,” Tony clears his throat. “Convince him to sign those divorce papers. Tell him about me, tell him about what I’ve told you. Steve, I’m not
“Ned, I don’t want a girlfriend!” he hisses at him, heart beating fast. Why is he suddenly so nervous?
“I suggest you tell him to hand back the suit. You’re the most experienced here, so I suggest you hold it until you deem him ready to wear it again,” Gilette says. Ross breaks eye-contact then, turning to the woman with a mouth fallen open.
say that he didn’t want to see him for now. Natasha must have passed the message along.
“You keep on being saddled up with our problems all the time,” Tony mutters out. He can’t help it, he feels guilty. Sure, nobody can blame Peter for feeling the way he is, but Tony just can’t believe that he put Steve through the exact same situation once before.
“You do know I love you, right?” Tony suddenly feels the urge to say. Steve’s breath catches in his throat. Then he closes his eyes, leaning into Tony’s touch gratefully.
Of course, it’s mostly Peter who did the planning, and Ned trying to stop him, constantly reminding that it was crazy. The plan is stupid, and probably deadly, but Peter needs to know.
“Yeah,” Peter just sighs out. He’s not getting closer to his answer here, and he’d rather have it by tomorrow so he could arrange the meeting with Stark if it would be necessary. Or at Oscorp, even though Peter feels a small chill at the idea of returning there without Gwen in it. No, that’s probably not such a good idea. Surely there are other place he could try out for biochemistry.
So Yaël told him that he should do that, and Peter smiled. It was clearly the answer he needed.
“Uh,” he starts, holding up his hands in surrender. “I- uh- I surely want to meet h-her, but if today’s too much trouble, I- I- I guess another time, uh, is alright, too?” he tries.
Nilla noticed that Yaël wasn’t paying attention, so she shuffled a bit closer. When Yaël looked up, she saw Nilla open her mouth in a very recognizable way. Yaël ducked and jumped away, towards the door as the flames surrounded her. Before she closed the door behind her, she heard her sister grumble and hiss. It was clear the woman wanted her dead. Yaël pulled out her card so the door got locked again. Then she noticed her lab coat’s sleeve was on fire around the shoulder.
Then he walks up the stairs. Corsage in hands, matching the color of her dress (because Peter had the foresight to ask which color it would be, and all she did was send a closeup off the fabric off the dress, not revealing anything other than the color). He presses the bell, takes a deep breath and then waits.
That afternoon, Thor and Jane get married.
Happy counters.
“Well, don’t we all want that one thing we know we can’t have?” They were walking through the halls to see what damage was caused where, just so Charles would be able to give clear orders once he unfroze time.
“This,” she panted with tears in her eyes, “is how my powers got released for the very first time.” Yaël wanted to look back at Raido, but X grabbed her chin and forced her to look away. So she looked at the king, who looked at bit shocked, but signed at Nilla, who quick and smoothly, even though she had just stabbed herself several times, crept up to memory-Yaël and knocked her down with the back of her blade. The castle stopped collapsing and started to immediately rebuild, as the king and a few of his servants were steering earth.
“So wait,” Yaël tried to understand it. “There are more of these stones and there’s, like, a weapon inside of me?” Some guy walked through the gates, hood over his head, hands in his pockets.
Violins start playing and Steve suddenly pulls Tony out of his chair, starting a dance as well. It’s a bit awkward since Tony doesn’t know the steps at all, but while Steve continues to lip-sync, his eyes never leave Tony’s.
“Where is it…?” he mutters to himself, going through his stuff while still holding his glass in the other hand. He only realizes after a minute that he’s been sticking out his tongue during his search. It takes a few minutes longer until he finds what he’s looking for.
He stops again, looking behind him. The light is still right there; there’s a straight line that divides the two places. Tony tries to turn back, but no matter how much he tries to get there, the light seems to be getting further away from him. So he stops, turns back to the dark.
“Ho there, Tony,” Rhodey chuckles out, slapping him gently on the back. Tony can’t help but let out a long, shaky breath. Why is he feeling like he’s at the verge of crying?
“Her powers are very shifty, I’ve seen her sick before and with just a flu she managed to burst a window.” Steve rubbed his eyes.
It didn’t take Yaël very long to detect an issue she hadn’t calculated in.
“Shar, uh, hi,” Steve stutters out. Sharon raises her eyebrows at him, but she still manages a smile, looking amused.
Peter nods. It could do good to escape from all these people. He does consider the family, warning them about stepping out for a moment before actually going. Steve and May seem worried. Tony just nods and hugs him shortly.
“Does the signal need to be continuous? Or is just one ‘beep’ of it enough?” Peter asks, holding in a giggle when the marker travels over his stomach.
Bruce sighs before putting a hand on Peter’s shoulder.
“Yaël, she blew herself into pieces, I’m sorry I have to put it like this, but you have to leave.” It was her fault, she had made Nilla mad like that and so the girl probably started steering too much fire in a fireproof cell. Nilla probably baked herself to death. Had it been an accident, or did she do it on purpose?
delicious, Tony realizes by now. Of course, he would have loved to stay a bit longer, spend some quality time with Steve, watch his son get better under the hand of Mantis.
?!” LL asks, helping Peter back on his feet. Peter allows him to pull him up, putting his hands on his knees while he tries to regain his breath. He’s probably not really exhausted, but just pretending to keep people from noticing anything weird.
“First of all; no more discussion of all this having-children crap, alright? We know where we stand on this, let’s just not bring it up anymore.”
“Easy, Rogers, don’t get your panties in a twist,” she said. “You know it’s not that big of a deal anymore, right?”
Steve has such a few things he’s passionate about. Tony vaguely remembers the guy mentioning them, and of course once he’s heard it, it stays in his brain for a long time. That’s how he’s managed to plan out this entire evening without any trouble.
I'm back!
And they say goodbye after that. Natasha punches him in the arm again, just for good measure.
Shit, he wasn’t even picking up! Yaël hung up before she even heard a beep while still staring at the bottle.
“Shut up, Tony,” Pepper says, resting a hand over her eyes as she notices Vision’s growing confusion. She looks at him apologetically. “I’m sorry, just ignore him. He’s being annoying.”
Oh, god… what was she doing?
“Who are you?” Peter asks, keeping his hands up in a gesture that tells her she should keep her distance. It seems like it doesn’t stop her at all as she takes a few more steps forward. She has a big grin on her full lips, and her green eyes look playful. She looks vaguely familiar, but… Peter can’t just place where he must know her from.
Steve hadn’t looked at him after that. He just left the Penthouse, put the chair back into the lab, and then left the tower in its whole. He went for a jog, one that lasted about three hours, which he performed in clothes that were not at all meant for jogging. After that, he took a shower. He stayed under it for at least an entire hour.
Steve is quiet on the other side of the line. Peter wonders how it’s like on his side; unable to get out of the rubble fallen over him in the explosion, stuck with his unconscious partner who is probably the only one right now who can calculate their way out of that situation.
He keeps his mouth shut about their destination the entire ride, but it doesn’t take a genius to figure out they’re headed to Brooklyn. Steve, who seems about just as nervous as Tony is feeling, is practically jumping up and down his seat. What this guy’s fixation is with Brooklyn, Tony wonders if he’ll ever know.
“Barnes is with him, isn’t he?” Tony asks, already knowing the answer.
“That restaurant was a good one,” Steve remarks, giving a quick glance in the mirror. A smile forms on his lips, and the dimples in his cheeks come back up. As he expresses his fondness, the lines around his eyes become more visible. Tony loves them; they’re just perfect.
“I’m just putting them down in the bed, if that’s alright?” she asks. Tony nods.
“I’ve been through many things that others my age haven’t,” Peter tells her back, and Dr. Cho nods in agreement while lifting her eyebrows. Mr Stark left about fifteen minutes ago after making sure that Peter’s well taken care of, and that has given the teenager some time to think. It helps now that his head is clear, though.
Peter falls asleep by the time his mother agreed to go out on a date with his father.
saw this coming,” Sam mutters. “I’m just more surprised about the fact that this is only your first date; we’d expected you two to be together for far longer than that.”
He lets go of it again. The star hovers a bit in the air. Then, suddenly, a shape seems to emerge from it. Tony flies back a bit when he sees somebody standing next to him.
“How could you tell?”
“I made that thing, I get to use my own toys once in a while,” Mr. Stark counters. “Besides, I pay for this entire building. If you want the honest truth, you’re all even more than a handful! If I have to hire another cleaning-maid, I think I might actually just build one from scratch.”
Tony looks up from the couch, seeing Pepper standing in the living room, standing right next to the little bed he assembled only an hour ago. Peter’s already in it, fast asleep after crawling around the Penthouse all day.
After taking another sip from her coffee, Yaël drops down the mug and dries her upper lip.
“Oh, I’m going to miss this,” Steve mutters.
He’s got to make it right. He’d rather do it today, but the fact that Steve sent him back home means that he won’t be convincing Tony today. It’ll have to be tomorrow, Peter states.
“Look, that was a complicated situation,” he started in that typical way of his.
“We’re practically raising my teenage son together,” Tony adds playfully. Barnes frowns at that, still keeping his gun up.
Steve knew that as he was often the one finding Tony wandering around in the tower in the middle of the night as the two of them couldn’t sleep due to the nightmares.
But luckily, with that Mr. Thompson looked at the clock and told his wife their soap was going to start. So Yaël helped them clean the table and thanked them a thousand times before stepping into the rain again, this time with an umbrella she got from Mrs. Thompson.
When Peter enters the workshop, he's not too surprised to see Steve sitting at the desk next to Tony. He drops his bag, evades Dum-E loose affectionate arm, and salutes the pair sitting there.
"Welcome back, I trust you kicked some ass out there?" Tony asks, suddenly appearing from the hall with his hair sticking out wildly and grease-stains over his shirt. When he gets to Steve and Peter, he kisses them both on the cheek before starting up the coffee machine. Steve reaches out immediately to pull the plug and stop him.
much gold on Earth for a group of people that has no money at all – but it looks impressive, nonetheless.
Someone roughly knocked open the door, it made Yaël jump and look behind her. Two bodyguards stormed in and before she even had the time to think about what the freaking hell was going on, they grabbed her arms and one of them said: “Miss, you have one minute to leave this building in peace.”
“Welcome to Wakanda, Mr. Stark,” the King says, still holding on to his hand in a strong grip.
Tony grits his teeth together upon seeing Norman Osborn walking up to Mary, who turns to look at Tony and finds that he’s no longer here.
” Tony then asks.
Heading to the kitchenette, Tony takes all he needs to prepare his hot coco. It’s what his mother made for him whenever he wasn’t feeling well, and he knows Peter isn’t going to feel well after this. The way the kid looks up at Steve, watching him with such adoration. He’s going to take it really hard.
“Does he like you back?” Yaël asked.
“Wow, you’re very cold…” Yaël said as she pulled her hand back.
“Dude…” Peter mutters, giving Tony an unimpressed look. “Why do you keep on doing that?”
Ned just stares at him with his mouth fallen open.
But with any other person… he doesn’t. And when he saw the footage of himself with Felicia, things he didn’t remember even doing… Peter can’t help but feel disgusted at every bit of it that reminds him of… sex. Damnit…
. That’s all he can do right now. He figures he should start with Tony. At least, to him, he can give the whole story. Then, after he can get everything straight, he can try and figure out this mess.
“Please, Charles, can’t you see the kid has his own troubles? I don’t want to bother him with mine,” she replied, even though she sometimes got the feeling she wanted to crawl out of her own skin, which Charles immediately intercepted of course.
As Mantis sits down, Peter heads to his bedroom. The door is open, the inside dark. He’s got no clue how he left it before he headed back to the tower. It’s not like he pays attention to that kind of thing. Peter turns on the light, heads to his closet, and startles when he finds a figure on his bed.
The two walk together through the hallways until they get to a door that leads them outside. The beginning of the fall hasn’t reached Wakanda just yet, seeing that the temperatures still seem at its highest. It’s probably why T’Challa is walking around in nothing but a light pair of pants and a short-sleeved shirt. Tony wisely kept his coat inside, and rolls up his own sleeves.
“Oh, come on, Steve, seriously?” Tony calls out. Once again, a couple of gazes are landing on them, and Rhodey pokes them in the back.
“Now, for the matter of the Avengers and their role in the former disagreement with the accords,” the man starts immediately afterwards. Peter closes his eyes and sighs. He’d forgotten that they’d indeed not discussed this yet. Tony notices his discomfort and squeezes his shoulder for a moment.
But what the news can’t give him are the inside details of that family. And so, JARVIS fills up the gaps. Like this, Tony learns that about two years into their marriage they started to fall out of love. They tried to fix it by having another child, which worked for a short while. Natalee joining them was more of a surprise. The two of them haven’t even slept together since Natalee’s birth. Instead, JARVIS tells him that they came to an agreement; they can sleep with who-ever they want, as long as it’s out of the eye of the public. Tony Stark from this universe really didn’t want to get divorced.
“Well, I figure both of us pretty much got it off our chests back then. You got anything more to add to it?” Peter asks, wanting the conversation to stay away from that particular topic for now. He’s aware that they need to discuss that – because obviously there must be
“You know, I’m right here, I can hear everything,” Peter mutters.
Peter lets out a long breath and rubs his eyes again.
, and I couldn’t save her, and Flash doesn’t get to laugh at that because my
“Seriously, the
Instead, he calls up for a cab, helps Johnny inside, and passes on the address. With Johnny’s head snoring on into his lap, Peter lets out a sigh while looking out the window. His mind goes back to this Black Cat. Who was she? And where is she? She’s got dangerous stuff with her, so he really hopes his Dad is after her, otherwise this would be pretty stupid.
“The fuck, Wade…” Yaël mumbled to herself. But Wade must’ve heard her, because his laughter suddenly rumbled through the whole restaurant. Yaël kicked him under the table as she looked at Peter with a I-am-so-sorry-I-brought-this-mentally-ill-raisin-to-this-restaurant-face. Wade leaned back to laugh even harder and when he finally stopped his concert, he sniffed a bit as he dried his eyes.
“Why did you do it?” Peter asks, getting to the matter immediately without bothering to beat around the bush. The Cat turns her head slightly, but he still can’t see her face due to all that light hair. It almost seems white from up here.
“So, what’s next?” Rhodey then asks. Tony, without much effort due to Extremis (and the serum from Steve’s liver, though according to Bruce that amount has already diminished quite a bit) takes the box from the ground and carries it all the way outside.
It looks like Stark-tech.
Peter fakes a smile. It fools Felicia, who squeezes his shoulder one more time before giving it a light punch.
“You have anything in mind, Tony?” he asks. Tony opens his mouth, but nothing comes out. Quickly, he turns to Steve, who shakes his head fondly, smiling widely upon seeing his partner being so unprepared.
“Is that Peter’s other dad?” Bruce asks. Tony feels something uneasy in his stomach as Bruce says the words, but he can’t deny that it’s the truth. Despite not being related by blood, the man still partially raised Peter up to a point.
“So you’re leaving?” he asks, knowing that, if they are, he’s not going with them. He’s not even near to be cleared for Iron Man again. Sure, he’s been taking his meds and his session with Dr. Wynedell earlier today hadn’t gone too bad, but his moods are still too unpredictable. He could still seriously hurt somebody if he were to lash out again. Mostly himself….
“Hi, uh, yeah! I was wondering if, maybe, you could help me out with something?” Peter asks. Pepper looks a bit surprised at the question but then smiles.
“Right.”
Of course, once they’re in their hotel room, and Peter has dropped the suit on the bed with multiple little tools lying around, he hands Ned the cable that will connect the suit to the computer.
She stops talking, letting out another deep breath. Her fingers fidget together nervously.
“Wanda, hey,” Peter greets her, realizing he hadn’t sent her anything for her return.
“Not like we have the money for it, anyway,” Peter mutters, thinking back of how his aunt and he are barely getting through with paying the bills as they are. She’s already doing extra shifts at the hospital behind his back, and he’s been trying different jobs and managed to finally find one that didn’t get him fired after the first week, even though it barely pays.
“Kid, I don’t really want to ask this, but I
“Holy crap, I’m so sorry!” he starts, already reaching out for the other person to help him, only to see that it’s Ned.
“Uh, yeah, I’m fine. What’s up?”
Peter rolls his eyes internally, instead biting his teeth together and holding himself in when he wants to ball his hands into tight fists. To be honest, after yesterday, he really doesn’t need this.
“Steve,” Tony almost whispers out. Steve simply smiles in return, a bag with presents in his hands.
“The Helicarriers… They would have… look, Bruce and I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for you, so thank you.” Tony put on the sunglasses and started walking out of the room. Steve started to smile, then, looking back at Tony’s retreating back.
Peter thinks for a moment, looking down at the arc reactor but then thinking better of it. He wants it to be a surprise, after all.
“Uh, let him up,” Tony says quickly. Alternate Steve, here? What does he want? Do they actually get along, perhaps?
- Being a hero doesn't automatically fix your relationship
Everybody looks at Tony like he’s crazy, and for a moment Tony even believes it. He scrapes his throat again, not caring if it hurts from doing that too much.

, Cem said to Yaël with lights of joy dancing in his eyes.
- Very Protective (Aunty) Nat
“Guys! I’m finally here! You should have called me! Where can I help?”
“Uh, do you have any more of those feedback-papers that I have to fill in for school?” Tony asks in an attempt to lighten the mood a bit. For his internship, in order to earn himself more grades at school, Peter has to hand in some documents with positive feedback he’s gotten from his workplace. As far as Tony knows, at first Peter handed it to Francis back when he still worked in the tower. Now, Tony, too, has already gotten a few of them.
Tony smiles lightly.
“How can I do what?”
He grins when he gets a wink in return. He tightens the straps of his backpack and looks out the window, though seeing nothing but darkness. They’re underground, after all.
“C’mon, Dad, can I please come in?” Peter begs. Despite that he doesn’t sweat in the suit, he would really just want to take a shower and relax a bit on the couch for the evening.
“Dude, it’s me you’re talking about. Are you really that surprised?” Tony asks, playfully.
He’ll stand by him. Forever, and ever and… Tony sighs happily against his mouth. When he hears somebody scrape his throat, the two pull apart, realizing that Peter is still sitting there awkwardly, kindly keeping his eyes averted.
“Not your smartest move, Yaël,” the man said dryly, but he did nothing to help her. After a struggle, Yaël got rid of the flames, but was still stuck with some smoke and she was oh, so cold from using fire as she used a lot of her own body temperature to create the flames. She coughed and rubbed her eyes. Her heart raced as she started to panic.
“Ah, my boys grow up so fast,” Tony jokes, pretending to flick away a tear. Peter snorts. He winks at Wanda when they pass each other, suddenly feeling the need to tell Yaël about this. But he can’t, because she’s disappeared without any warning.
Peter doesn’t really feel like having an emotional talk right now. His emotions are all over the place; one moment he’s pissed, and the next he’s at the verge of crying his eyes out because of abandonment issues. He should get it together.
“I’ve noticed,” Peter mutters, thinking back of how Natasha practically addressed him as her nephew. It’s weird, to suddenly have so many people caring about him. “I don’t mind it, though.”
Peter’s speechless. Unable to come up with any good answer, he balls his hands into fists and looks down to his feet.
I felt like it was needed to portray that the accords didn't only involve the Avengers. New York is full of heroes after all.
“Jesus, have they been feeding you at all?” Peter asks, a bit shocked at the skinny appearance of the person that was once his best friend. Harry’s permanent grin goes back up, bringing wrinkles in his scarred cheeks. He looks truly crazy, with that distant look in his eyes.
Charles frowned, well, by this time he probably already read what was going on in her head. Yaël scratched her hand.
“Wait, what? You don’t know what happened to you?” Yaël shook her head and signed at the sofa’s. “Let’s take a seat.” This was going to be a long talk.
So Steve calls. Again, and again. Until after a while, somebody picks up.
Peter clears his throat, feeling his cheeks warm up.
“Where’s Steve?” he asks, and Tony points to the front door.
“Too busy!” he returned, ridding himself of the conversation by jumping out of a jet.
“Huh, Spanish?” Peter asks when he realize he can’t understand a single thing written down. MJ scoffs.
Having arrived at the hotel Happy drove him to, Peter asks for just a minute before dropping down on the bed. He’s feeling a strong urge to pull the mask off and take a deep breath, but the chances of Happy walking inside are too big, so he doesn’t.
“I wanna eat with Dad,” she calls out. Tony can hear Peter sigh, and somehow it breaks his heart. What the hell happened? Who are these other two kids? Why is Peter dressed in a high school uniform?
“This isn’t over,” the other woman said, grabbing back both the brother’s attention.
When there’s a sudden hand on his shoulder, Peter startles, swinging out his arm in an urge of self-defense he can’t explain. Turning around, he finds a familiar figure standing in front of him.
that something isn’t right. Of course, it’s also not surprising that Tony would deny that when they’re asking for it.
“Yeah?” Peter answered from behind it. Okay, that was the cue to walk in.
“Yeah, I know.” Suddenly she heard police sirens. She looked back at Jason who stared right back at her, both understanding that there was a chance they were coming for her. Yaël turned around and started walking away, leaving the park again.
I've been slowing down on my writing lately. I really need to see Black Panther soon to get back into the hype, because we're getting dangerously close to the last chapter I've written (chapter 6!). But no worries, there's no way I'm dropping this story! :D
“It’s the eighteenth of November, Dad,” he says. “You’ve been here for about ten days now.”
“Tony, how much did you take?”
Steve nods, taking the device and turning down the volume. After Natasha’s happy with the result, she motions for them to get back outside.
“I’m hopeless? I’m pretty sure something’s burning back there,” Tony points out when he catches that stingy smell. Steve pulls away rather quickly, running back to the kitchenette and actually getting out a few curses that make Tony feel all tingly inside.
little wine during parties or anything of the kind. He keeps himself away from the dangers of alcohol with the help of Dr. Wynedell, his psychiatrist. In the past few months, he’s even gotten used to his heightened strength, though the amount of inventions that have come out since he’s got it is still significantly lower than normally.
“Mr. Stark! We’re so sorry! We didn’t know this would happen!” Johnny says, clearly panicking, as he’s holding a tiny, naked baby in his hands. The baby is squirming, kicking its feet with his eyes squeezed shut. Crying, filling the room with its high-pitched shriek that makes Tony wonder if that’s why his father didn’t really like him in the workshop.
-“ Of course Stark immediately assumed what happened, and he was probably going to point his finger at her for making his son feel so bad.
And then Peter notices it, too; a younger – but not
“Should I leave you two alone or…?” the righteous voice of Captain America suddenly says from behind them. Both Tony and Natasha turn around to find the soldier standing there with his hands on his hips and his eyebrows raised. He’s smirking though, so at least he’s not annoyed.
to it like everybody has over the years.”
Yaël thought she heard knocking a few times, maybe she even heard someone yell, but it was extremely hard to get a hold of the thin, hazy line between reality and chimera.
“Two months later, they get married at the beach in Malibu. And from then on, they are known as Steve Rogers-Stark and Tony Stark-Rogers.”
“Well, no, it’s not the new beginning of a decade and I want to take your habits and rituals in account. Steve happened to have the same idea as he actually came over to pick you up and cook for you in the compound. I thought, maybe we could just celebrate with the three of us?” Well, what a weird but wonderful birthday had that been!
Because she had decided to get to her sister a few weeks ago, she had been looking for a person who’d be able to help her. And since Stark wasn’t really an option (should she have tried to ask him? No…right?) and she didn’t want to put Peter nor any other Avenger in an uneasy position, she searched for another person with an easy access to the Tower or the Compound. Well, maybe she was taking risks she shouldn’t be taking if she’d just asked nicely to Tony, but maybe… maybe she was too stubborn.
Trying to call up Peter leads him to voicemail. The phone is turned off. He’ll try again later. Peter needs to know that he’s alright. Surely,
“Thanks, stone,” she mumbled to herself while limping down the pile.
With tired smiles on their faces, the two stay there for a little while. Seconds tick by, the moment where they have to leave coming closer and closer.
“We just need to hold her off until everyone is on board,” Brunhilde stated.
“Dad, tell me, please!”
The same mind that offered him an imaginary conversation with Gwen earlier.  Maybe she – actually he, since the conversation was built out of nothing more but his own thoughts – was right. Maybe Peter can’t really figure this thing out by himself. Maybe he
“Stephen, can I have a word?”
. Why didn’t Peter say that he was out of meds? How long has he gone without them, even? Have things like this happened before in the past few weeks without Tony knowing about it?
“Ah, Mr. Stark!”
Eventually, the last strand holding on gives up as well. With a shout, Peter finds himself sucked into a portal made of bright light. And at first he feels something warm over him, but after that, it’s only dark.
Natasha. Peter smiles. They must have found a way back for him. Peter turns back to Gwen and kisses her one last time.
“Tony, are you ready to go?” Bruce asks from outside the door. Tony stands up, with that accidentally getting a good view of his entire chest. He gasps in surprise, closing his eyes immediately.
FRIDAY still states the obvious, and Tony shakes his head and throws his arms up. She got him, there.
Peter nods in understanding. He just doesn’t know if it’s possible for Bruce to manage that, somehow. After all, hasn’t the guy been trying to get his portion out for years?
Of course, that one phone-call from Oscorp changed everything.
“I got them off your back, don’t ask me how. They’re just grateful that you got the man, and they don’t want you to sign. Not yet, at least,” Tony assures him. He taps his watch two times, and suddenly the pillar opens up. There, a shiny, new suit lights up. Peter’s mouth falls open, because this… this isn’t-? Wait, what?
“Anyway, I don’t think they’ll be there. They haven’t been active since Midland Circle, haven’t they?” Peter asks. Ned shakes his head. Happy then parks the car in the underground parking underneath the tower. Quickly, the two teenagers jump out. “Thanks Happy!”
By the time he’s finally back under the covers, Tony’s already taken place on the bed as well. There’s enough place for both of them, but still Tony has banished himself to the far corner of the mattress. With his hand in Peter’s hair, the boy starts drooping off.
“If you can get the image of Charles biting you out of my head, sure,” Steve jokes. Then he gets back inside the room.
“You were brought here by ambulance after your son found you. You have a tube to your stomach to clean it out. Are you feeling any discomfort?”
“That’s odd, you told me you quit band-practice last year,” Tony says, playing along for now. But the anger inside of him is getting damn stronger each time. “What’s up?”
“What happened to you that changed you so much?”
“Yeah, we can go at my house, or maybe yours? You can choose!” he says, but Peter shakes his head sadly and hands the phone back.
“I know you will.”
“I love you, too,” he responds.
“We need more than three of them, Tony. We have enough people that are prepared to evaluate their progress, you won’t even have to be much of a part of it.”
“No, I don’t have an idea indeed,” Peter says. “Why do you hate me like this?”
“You’ve got a concussion, as well, hence the dark room, including two concussed ribs. Dr. Cho will come by later to give us some more information,” Aunt May finishes. Peter startles a bit when he suddenly feels her lips on his forehead, but then he lets out a long breath.
Tony counters. Peter glares at him. They both know there’s no Avengers to speak of. Come to think of it…
As Ross drones on more and more about something called ‘the accords’, Tony can’t do much more than agree, because the only words that stand out to him are ‘Avengers’, ‘damage’ and ‘put in check’. No matter how much it pains him to say it, but he can’t agree more.
“STOP!” Hela growled, making another spear that flew right through Yaël’s hand. Yup, she was going to die. There was no fucking way she’d survive all the blood loss Hela had caused.
“Thank you, Mr. Stark,” Peter says, nodding towards the man who isn’t even seeing him right now. Peter decides not to pay too much attention to it, and starts making his way towards the door.
When she was finished, she looked up. Somehow, Hulk managed to jump into the spaceship. Someone dropped something about a fever, another one said something about missing the coronation. But Yaël let herself sink into the black water again. It was way more comfortable there than it was being conscious.
“I have a little problem, no biggie, rather smallie…”
“Our- what?” Steve asks, confused. Tony just huffs out a disbelieving laugh. “Tony and I aren’t together?”
“Open up that reactor of yours, huh?” he asks, and Peter jumps in action, taking the Arc Reactor back from where Mr. Stark dropped it, and then fumbles with it a little bit until it’s open. Instead of taking it over from Peter, Mr. Stark just directs the glowing blue triangle towards the open latch inside the reactor. Peter looks at it with a mouth fallen open, aware that Steve is still standing there and observing as well.
Oh no, he didn’t.
Ned tries to be kind, not asking questions about what happened and respecting their privacy. Michelle doesn’t even seem to care about it. It’s mostly the others that are being annoying as ever. The people that have never talked to him before suddenly come up to him, holding up a newspaper or their cellphone and asking for clarification.
“Okay, uh, good. I don’t think I’m mentally ready for that,” Tony admits nervously. “Ned, you’re staying here for dinner?”
. Tony doesn’t know what he’s thinking and what he’s saying anymore. It doesn’t matter. The adrenaline is still too high.
Now she could just peacefully stare at the flames and listen to the voices.
“Can you just… tell everybody I love them?”
They’re discussion is stopped when all of the sudden Thor walks forward. He’s greeted by Heimdall at the end of the aisle. The gatekeeper slaps his shoulder shortly before pulling him into a hug. The man is going to be the one to lead the ceremony, which is why he’s standing where he’s standing right now.
“Wade, do you have a deathwish?!” Yaël yelled at him. Wade looked back at her with a bit off-looking grin.
He heads back to his room running his hands through his hair, he’s tired, relieved, but tired. Hopefully he can actually get some sleep before his flight tomorrow morning. He’s packing up his stuff when he hears a knock on the door. When he opens it Steve is standing there, looking down at his feet quickly.
Pepper and Happy have been fighting over me and normally you know I’d be all about that but its over who’s best man I should be. Happy will probably win since I’m walking Pepper down the aisle (her dad died a few years back, lovely man) and she’s nothing if not reasonable. Well depends who you are but she loves him so I think she’ll let it go. She wants to plan almost all of it herself, which I personally believe is going to stress her to no end but also both of us are chronic micromanagers so I understand. She’s actually not as bad as me normally but I think the wedding is bringing out her dark side, she expects competency as the bare minimum and unfortunately, she doesn’t always get it. Well not the first go around, she Always gets it on the second, everyone is scared enough by then that they’ll do whatever she wants.
I really want this to go well for her, after everything that’s happened… she deserves it.
He sighs, “then we don’t have to, but I don’t want to be hurting you, even unintentionally, and I can’t fix this if I don’t know what’s wrong.”
Rogers,
Do you think we can fix it?
Tony doesn’t wipe off the tear but he does rest his hand on one of Steve’s, as gently as he knows how, and it’s the hardest thing he’s ever done, but it’s also the easiest.
So, that could’ve gone worse? I only really meant to send one message but it took you a while to respond and well, it’s fine. God, I sound like a teenager, its fine. You know its funny, I was dreading sending that message, I spent, far too long composing it, and now its fine. I’m okay with it, I’m still not okay with you but we’ll deal with that later.
I wish I was more okay with all of this, I also wish I was less okay with it. Instead I’m stuck inside some sort of limbo where I miss you but you also feature prominently in my nightmares and I don’t know how to deal with that. How do I deal with the fact that I still care about you when I can’t look at myself without thinking about what you did?
Rhodey sighs and glances at Tony, “well I guess this is it then.”
It’s still quite early, Tony rarely sleeps much if he sleeps at all, and with a resigned sigh he shambles over to the hotel’s coffee maker. The coffee it makes isn’t great, some might consider it bad, but contrary to what is probably popular belief, Tony doesn’t care all that much about what type of coffee he drinks. Of course, the beans he usually buys are fairly high quality, but after years of drinking shitty burnt 3am coffee at MIT and whatever concoctions DUM-E handed him, all that matters is that the caffeine makes it into his system.
So you see, that’s not really what hurt, I mean I didn’t enjoy watching him die, watching him struggle. I didn’t enjoy it, and it hurt, not as much as it could’ve but it did... But he killed my mother Rogers, I had to watch, she called for him and he killed her, he killed my mother. I am glad you stopped me. I don’t want him dead, I know it’s not his fault. I just, god, I wish it hadn’t been like that. Everything went south so goddamn fast, it all went to shit
Its easier to talk to you when I know its only really in my head.
His watch beeps and Tony sits up and joins Rhodey at the window.
“Yeah I’m fine, I’ll be fine, I just need a minute. What, exactly, uh, happened, from your point of view?” He runs his hand through his hair and rubs his face.
“Don’t be, it was my idea anyways, thanks for trying.”
I’ve got a date set up for the “family reunion”. There’s a government facility in Sweden that’s willing to host us from the 13th to the 15th. I’m still a little numb to the idea but, I guess we’ll see how it goes, I am looking forward to seeing everyone. Looking forward to seeing you  I’m not actually upset about the prospect of seeing you I miss you a lot so that’s something.
The doctors say Rhodey’s progressing really well, he can walk pretty much fine with the brace on now. He tries to tell me its not my fault, that he doesn’t blame me, but it is. I shouldn’t have dragged him into this, into this life… I didn’t mean to, I tried so damn hard to keep him safe… I don’t think he blames Sam either, although I don’t think he’ll be buddy-buddy with him anytime soon. I know I don’t deserve it but I am so lucky to have him as a friend. He’s been there since MIT you know, since I was 15. We were roommates for the first year, well, sort of, more like I slept on his couch more than in my own bed. We met at a party, I was trying to impress some of the older kids, of course. I hated that I was so much younger than them, and they hated it too, but I had ridiculous amounts of money and I desperately wanted friends so they pretended to like me as long as I paid for things. I was wasted, not too horribly, but pretty bad, and Rhodey, mother hen that he is, realized what was going on and decided to help me get back to my room. After that well… couldn’t seem to get rid of him, he started sitting beside me in class, and bringing me food because he knew I wouldn’t remember to eat. Eventually I stopped trying to get rid of him, because “I didn’t need to be taken care of”, hah, and that was that. It took me a little while to realize he didn’t have any ulterior motives.  He’s been by my side ever since, saved my life more times than he should’ve. He’s the one who found me in Afghanistan you know, looked for me the whole time, drove his superiors up the wall by the end of it. They were so sure I was dead but he knew, he knew I wouldn’t give up, wouldn’t die. No one else ever stuck with me like that, except Pepper, but he was first. I finally believe him when he says he’s not leaving. Took a long time to get to that point but, I’m there now… well mostly. I was worried he’d leave after what happened but when I told him that he just gave me that look, the one he gives me when I’m being an idiot, which is frequently, and then punched me in the shoulder. So, I guess that means he’s staying. He deserves better than me but if I can, if I can be even just a tiny bit of what he is to me, I’d drop everything for that.
I’ve had a migraine for four days and no it is not from lack of sleep. Ok, well, maybe a little bit but I’ve been getting around 6 hours a night which is a lot for me, and I’ve been drinking less coffee too, it’s terrible. Unfortunately, I can’t stop looking at screens which I know is making it worse but there’s so much work to be done and I can’t just stop. Hopefully it’ll get less painful soon so I can get my work done faster but I’m not really expecting it to. Writing like this isn’t doing wonders either so this is all you’re getting from me today.
Tony – BTW, meeting is set. T’Challa knows the details
There’s a soft knock on the door, Rhodey’s, and he lets himself in, coming to sit on the edge of the bed.
It’s cold when he steps off the plane, not freezing, not yet, but it’s brisk, and Tony finds himself breathing in deeply. It’s bracing he thinks, and it’s just what he needs to clear his head. The eight-hour flight had been full of worry, too much time to think, not enough to distract him. Luckily with it being a (mostly) private jet he was able to get some work done and pace down the length of the aircraft in relative peace. Relative because Rhodey and Natasha had come along, Natasha had shown up completely unannounced the day prior, had been sitting at the island finishing her reports when Tony had returned from a meeting at SI. He was proud to say he hadn’t been startled but he had been somewhat surprised, having assumed she’d just show up in Stockholm the day of the meeting.
“Probably.”
Nat appeared this morning, found her eating ice cream on the counter at like 3am. I’m proud to say that it did Not scare the shit out of me, which might have been partially because it was 3am and I’d been awake for, a while but still. I’m glad she’s back, and I’m glad its not awkward around her. It feels like it should be but she’s already apologized, not that she had really much to apologize for, and I’ve apologized and we’re okay, we’re good. That’s 2/6 but I doubt Thor will be back for a long time so I’ll settle for 5 if I have to. Bruce probably won’t come for a while, if he does at all, he didn’t have any part in this whole mess but I think he’s trying to avoid stepping on toes. It was pretty tense here for a while so I don’t blame him. Lord only knows where Clint is but I extended the invitation anyways. It’s still quiet but Rhodey’ll be here until around when you come back and now that Nat’s here… I don’t know, it all feels a bit easier. I’ve known her for longer than the rest of you, even if part of that was while she was undercover and we’ve always worked well together. She doesn’t put up with my bullshit and for some reason she actually seems to like me most of the time. It feels like, with her here, like maybe it could all work out, who knows. At the very least I think we should try. We can't go back to the way things were before, I know that, that's not what I'm trying to do. Well it kind of was at first but it's not anymore. I just want things to be okay, I want
You know ever since then I've had trouble sleeping in good beds? They feel wrong, too soft, I feel like if I fell asleep in them I'd have a hard time waking up and that's dangerous. When I got out I was looking forward to finally sleeping in my bed again but I ended up having to sleep on the floor for a week until I got a new mattress. Things are never the same when you come home, no matter how much you want them to be.
You know I’ve barely touched the armor in months. I’ve been working on it on and off of course, I’ve never really been able to stop doing that but, I don’t actually remember the last time I flew. I couldn’t after you left me there in Siberia. You shut down the main reactor so I was on back up power and it was safer to walk back to the entrance and call someone, especially since I was in such rough shape. Luckily there hasn’t been any real need to put it on, there was an incident a few weeks ago on 8th, nothing major, just some shitty Hammer Tech causing trouble.
I love FRIDAY to bits and I’ve still got her running some stuff but… JARVIS was always different, he was the first proper AI I ever built (second if you count DUM-E and I usually do). I was 20, I had built the first version of him earlier in my teens but I got him properly online then. He’s been with me ever since, and I honestly don’t know what I’d do without him.
Hey folks! Sorry for the wait, this semester has somehow managed to be more stressful than the last. They're really outdoing themselves here. This chapter is however longer than usual so I hope that makes up for it! I also think this is going to be a lot longer than I initially planned but I'm okay with that. Not sure exactly when the next update will be but I only have a month and a bit left of school so ideally when that's over I'll have more time to write!
Oh god, thinks Tony, they didn’t get all of them.
10:30
“Anyone would think you’ve never seen a cheese board before.” She smiles lightly, raising an eyebrow at him.
Rogers,
Cap. Why couldn’t you just tell me.
It’s Tony who speaks first, mainly because he knows Steve won’t. His throat is dry and the words don’t come out like he wants them to. “A beard huh?” It’s a shitty conversation starter as those go and they both know it, but it’s easier, easier than everything else that’s unspoken.
He eventually attempts to retreat to the couch to finish his work when the kitchen is commandeered to make food. He said that they should just get it catered but Steve had just given him a look, said ‘ten people Tony’, and Tony had given in. He’s probably right as per usual but it meant that now Tony is getting dragged away from his (very important!) work to help. Nat and Steve are working to make the bigger dishes while Tony has been set to help with the appetizers and drinks. Clint has been tied to the couch and is attempting to play Mario Kart with his feet. He’s doing surprisingly well.
1:13 PM
Steve lets out a huff of air, sounding almost amused, “yeah, figured I might be cold in Wakanda.”
Clint gestures at him with his spoon and responds through a mouthful of cereal “Look who’s talking, you look like an anthropomorphised raccoon.”
“You holding up okay? You were kinda agitated back there.” Steve looks up rather quickly at that, almost as if he hadn’t noticed Tony sitting down beside him.
“Alright, alright, you have my phone number I know. Now where’s the finger food, I’m starved.” Tony smiles as he ambles off, going to bother Clint who is trying to hoover up all the appetizers with the force of a dyson.
Thank you for your patience, enjoy <3
Tony lets his arm fall beside him, “Do I though? Do I really know? What if he does something I don’t expect, or says something I don’t expect and it all falls apart?”
“I think we should talk Tony, something happened there, and I don’t want it to happen again if I can help it. I don’t want you to pretend like everything’s okay when it’s clearly not.”
“Ans I’m supposed to find that comforting how?” Tony can feel his head turning to give him a Look which he elects to ignore.
Steve,
Me: Now that school's over I'll have time to write!
“Because you already know about those,” he mumbles into Rhodey’s shoulder.
“For what it’s worth, it means a lot to be back here, thank you for giving me a home again.” He smiles ever so slightly and walks out, not waiting for a response. Not that Tony knows what the hell to say to that anyways. He turns back to his work, his mind quiet for the first time in a while, but he finds himself unable to focus.
Clint shoves back at Nat, not even looking at Tony, “No idea, it was just on, lot of hot doctors though.” At this point he turns to wink and is immediately kicked hard in the ribs. Nat gains supremacy over the couch (as per usual) and rests her feet on Clint’s lap, stretching out.
“JARVIS called Rhodes but he couldn’t come in, I was just on the phone with him.”
I really don’t want to have to use this phone.
I need to actually talk to you, which I am still dreading, I need to hear it from you I need to hear it properly, I need to know. I don’t want to hear what you already told me because we all know that was just some bullshit, I want to know the truth. I can suspect all I want but I want to hear it from you and I know you won’t lie to me this time.
I always hoped she would leave him but I knew she couldn’t, I was lucky I could, she made sure I could, she protected me as best she could. I wish I would’ve thanked her more. The last time I saw her I was 19, I was home on a break from school, getting my second or third degree I don’t know. She and Howard were going on a trip, she played piano, I was shitty to dad, they left. A little while later I got the call. I don’t think I regret what I said to him but I wish I had said more to her.
(See the end of the chapter for
Rhodey ends up asking JARVIS to put on Fantasia instead, it’s a safe choice. Light enough and familiar enough that Tony ends up falling asleep less than ten minutes in, half sprawled on Rhodey, the dim light from the screen barely lighting up the room. It’s a much more restful sleep than his earlier attempt. Rhodey stays for the rest of the night and Tony only wakes up when he has to leave in the morning. It kind of sucks to be alone again but he’s grateful for last night so he waves goodbye, and mumbles something to that effect before he falls back asleep.
October is here and its time to confront some issues, or some people, or both. Everyone is very emotional and very tired.
“Doesn’t mean I don’t worry about them. Do you think you’re okay to go back to sleep?” Tony makes a non-committal grunt. “Okay, I’m assuming going upstairs is a no-go then?”
I apologize for the heavy amount of text here, things will be a little bit better formatted as we go one but as these are supposed to be letters I spaced them more like how I write on paper
We’re gearing up for the wedding this week, Monday and the wedding is Friday evening. Pepper is painfully stressed so I’m taking her on a spa day for her bachelorette party. I’m not technically her maid of honour but I am unofficially part of her posse and I know how to plan a good party and her bridesmaids all know it so her sister graciously offered to let me handle it. It does however mean I have to plan two parties because I’m doing Happy’s as well but Rhodey’s helping me out with that one. No there are not going to be strippers I know you’re making that face and you can stop. Happy would never, hasn’t in years and neither have I honestly. I haven’t done much partying since Afghanistan and I can’t say I miss it really at all.
Rogers,
“So this is resting?” From anyone else it would sound judgmental but Steve is keeping his voice gentle, he sounds more worried than anything.
Tony – I’ll let you know when there’s news
“Well that was fucking embarrassing. Hey JARVIS let me know when he’s out of range of the elevator, and account for the hearing.”
Rogers,
“It is! I am worried, about that, I might also be worrying about other things but I am worried about something going wrong. I made a lot of plans but I can’t predict everything and things could go south fast.” Rhodey raises an eyebrow at that and Tony turns his gaze to the window, staring at the city beneath them. “What if- what if he still hates me, what if I still hate him?”
This weekend has been, eye opening, to say the least. I'm not quite sure what I expected to happen, I don't think I really expected anything, I expected to be angrier at you that's for sure. I don't know why I'm not. Maybe because I've already forgiven you, or at least I think I have, I think that's what this is. I think that when I saw you I knew I had to. I'm a lot more emotional than I expected. I didn't think, I didn't think it would be like this. After everything, after all this, I still know you... and I don't, I don't know if that's a good thing. I feel like it is, it feels good. I didn't expect that. I thought it'd be hard, I thought it'd be hard to be in a room with you and be near you and see you and it was... It was, but then you gave me your hand and it's not anymore. You're still there, just like you've always been, and I'm still here and I still love you still care about you Ugh. I can't word this properly. It doesn't really matter if no one's going to see it but I hate not being able to get the words out. I know how to write well, I have PhDs, they make you write for those. Whatever. This government pen is also shitty I hope you know that, so is this paper. They're not spending the big bucks here that's for sure, the room's not bad though. I've slept in worse, but worse could also mean a cave in Afghanistan so the bar isn't that high.
Tony glares at him but there’s no real heat in his gaze, “I resent that comment.”
I don’t want to be upset and angry forever.
“He didn’t, at least not until I asked.”
Speaking of though, he’s bothering me about how late it is again and I should probably just give in at this point so goodnight.
All the new Avengers have been extended the offer as well, but most of them have elected to spend their time at the compound instead. He knows in some ways it’d be better to have everyone in the same spot but honestly, he spent very little time there, and its better not to have all your eggs in one basket or whatever. If he’s honest with himself it’s mostly because he finds the whole place just a bit too clinical, and after everything that’s happened it brings back too many bad memories. He’d much rather be in his actual home with the people he cares about most in the world. Although he still can’t convince Rhodey to move in, he’ll get him one day. T’Challa is going back home to run his country as expected, Bucky is still there as well, it wouldn’t be wise for him to leave while he’s still going through the rehabilitation process. Steve, well, Tony’s not sure where Steve is going or where he’s currently gone. As soon as the conference disperses Tony loses track of him, it’s a little disappointing but he can understand.
“Thank you Tony.” Steve stands up, lets out a long breath, and squares his shoulders. He turns back to Tony and offers his hand again. He takes it.
Rogers,
Anyways they’re getting married pretty soon, end of September actually. Being friends with me does allow you to get a venue fairly quickly, and she really wanted to get married in the fall, its her favourite season. It’s really nice to have some good news for a change.
“I think you’re right.”
Rogers,
Okay I don't have an excuse for how long this took but I hope you enjoy it anyways! I'm trying to write more lately but also uni just started back up so that's going to be most of my life.
The next time Tony reappears in the land of the living, Clint is sitting on the couch. He’s eating some horrifically sugary cereal and watching some hospital drama on TV. Tony is honestly not surprised, even with it being almost nine at night.
The room is nice, not luxurious, but Tony doesn’t mind, its better than he was expecting. He grabs a bottle of water and sits down in one of the chairs beside the small gas fireplace. The door closes behind Steve, he’s hovering there, unsure. He looks smaller than he ever has to Tony, none of his usual charm or confidence is there. Tony closes his eyes and waves him over gently, waiting until he hears him settle into the other chair before he says anything, but Steve speaks up first this time.
Don’t ever tell him I said any of this, he’d tease me for it for years and he’s already got more than enough dirt on me.
Also, we’re ignoring some canon here in that the whole bruce/nat thing never happened and also clint doesn’t have a family, itd be kind of weird if he did and then came to live at the tower anyways. Also as much as I love ragnarok we’re ignoring it ☹ it doesn’t super fit with what im doing so alas, it must go
Tony – You’re officially no longer a war criminal. Congrats
Tony – Full pardons and negotiations are on their way
Steve,
“Anyone who knows me would know that I have.” He rolls his eyes back at her and they work in companionable silence, moving to another platter when they’re done. It’s nice to spend time with her, they’d gotten all their weird apology conversations out of the way back when she moved back in, and if he’s honest, Tony had already forgiven her long before that. He’s known Nat longer than any of the rest of the Avengers, even if you don’t count ‘Natalie’, which he still kind of does, they built up a rapport! So it was easy to let her back in, to dismiss her concerns with a wave of his hand and give her a hug. It wasn’t as if he could just shut out everyone who turned their backs on him, then where would he be. He’d have like two friends, maybe, and that would just be sad. There are some things that are not so hard to forgive, and it’s not like he doesn’t get why people would pick Steve over him, who wouldn’t really. Anyways, it’s good, they’re fine, and he’s not just saying that for once.
“I’m just, gonna,” Steve gestures awkwardly towards the bathroom.
“JARVIS I can’t believe we’re letting in strays now. He’s going to make a mess on the carpet,” Tony says even as he falls into the love-seat beside the couch.
So, anyways, I got your room set up again. I didn’t want the staff to do it, they don’t know where things are supposed to go. I mean JARVIS could’ve told them but they’re never on our floors anyways, they also have more than enough work to do cleaning up the labs in R&D. I should probably give Riley a raise, I think he’s due for one soon anyway and I honestly have no idea how he got those scorch marks out. Plus, his daughter is starting to apply for college. I need to go over accounts before December. I know I have people for that and I’m not CEO anymore, but I still like to go through it myself and Pepper indulges me bless her.
I’m honestly not really sure what to talk about. Feelings and shit probably, how do I feel? Tired, old, like I don’t have time to feel either of those things with the whole world on my ass. There are some days where I consider retirement but you know I could never do that. This is my responsibility, I can’t just walk away, not while I can still do some good.
Howard? I doubt it… I avoided bringing him up like my life fuckin’ depended on it. He was a real piece of work, don’t know about when you knew him, but he must’ve been different. If you’d have seen him back when I was young, I’m pretty sure you would’ve punched him. God, wouldn’t that be so satisfying, watching you knock the bastard out. I never got a punch in myself, I knew it’d be a lot worse if I fought back, figured that one out through experience.
“Seems like it.”
Rogers,
My therapist recommended that I write, keep a “diary” or something. I don’t like the idea, and I already talk to myself enough as it is… but, I’m trying to move on, heal, I don’t know. Writing to you makes me feel less crazy than writing to myself. This doesn’t mean I want to talk to you, I really truly don’t, but you’re not ever going to see this so it doesn’t matter I guess. If you want to know why I’m writing this on paper, (ugh physical medium) apparently “You can’t write as fast as you type and it forces you to consider your words”. As far as I’m concerned that’s also bullshit and I can write very fast so I have no idea what she’s on about.
Tony runs through the interaction again during the press conference, it hadn’t been terrible he thinks, part of it had been almost pleasant, but it had also been incredibly awkward and Steve hasn’t looked at him all morning. He groans internally and resolves to put it out of his mind, he’s done more embarrassing things in his life for sure, it’s not like Steve’s never seen him half-awake and it’s not like he’s never seen Steve half-naked but it feels far too domestic, far too much like what they used to have and Tony’s not quite sure how he feels about that.
“Don’t be ridiculous.” Steve’s face falls.
“You are a traitor J, this is treason.” JARVIS ignores him.
Y’know I feel like these have stopped being like journal entries and more like letters, the only difference being that I am, Never sending these anywhere. I told my therapist what I was doing with her suggestion a while ago and she seemed a little surprised but she approved. It does feel, cathartic in a way, it also helps me keep track of time, and my life a bit… I don’t, really like to talk about the things I talk about here. There not things I would bring up to pretty much anyone I know, maybe bits of them to people like Rhodey and Pepper but, not everything. I can’t tell them a lot of these things, hell I still can’t write down everything, but its getting easier I think… and its helping. I think, I hope.
Tony – Will do
He’s still got his head down when he hears the door to his left open and shut, he barely hears the footsteps and he briefly hopes its Nat but he knows its not. Steve doesn’t say anything, just sits down beside him, on his right, giving him access to the door, and Tony is stupidly grateful for that, that small kindness. He can hear Steve’s breathing, low and steady, and he tries to match it, tries to calm down. They sit like that for a while, just breathing, before Tony looks up. He avoids looking at Steve, would rather look at anything else because he knows what he’ll see if he turns his head and he doesn’t know if he’s quite ready for that.
Tony doesn’t even register being on the floor until it happens, one minute he’s staring, steely-eyed at Steve, trying to find an opening, and the next he’s on the ground. What he does register is that Steve is looming over him, a hand still on his chest from the way he flipped him.
“Of course sir, although I must suggest that you do as you said you would and get some rest.”
It’s just his luck that about an hour later someone knocks on his workshop door. It takes him a while to register it, he only hears it because JARVIS has turned down his music. Steve is at the door, Tony grimaces but puts his work down and gestures for him to come in.
Rogers,
I am drowning in paperwork, actually drowning. Pepper thins the herd as much as she can, bless her, but there’s still so much shit. There was always a lot for patents and deals and what have you and that all got a lot easier when I made Pep CEO but I am working with mountains now, bounteous piles of crap. Most of it is accords stuff, or other superheroing minutiae, she can’t really deal with all of that for me unfortunately. I pick up my own messes now, especially after Stane and the palladium… I don’t like leaving those things in the hands of others, and even less after New York and Sokovia. Alas, I’ve probably taken too long of a break from this crap, time to dive back in.
I don’t 100% know what day it is, I don’t really know if I care? I’m pretty sure its morning. I moved back to the tower, the compound is too quiet, I hate it. It’s quiet here too, but its our
Rogers,
“Can you explain how it is exactly you managed to receive a pardon when you so clearly acted against the wishes of the common public?” He’s young, Tony thinks, and he’s clearly just trying to antagonize everyone, thank god, that makes this a lot easier. Steve keeps his expression carefully neutral, as he starts to open his mouth Tony leans forward towards his mic.
12:10 PM
“We were sparring and when I pinned you, you just stopped moving and wouldn’t respond. I thought that leaving you in the gym would probably be a bad idea so I carried you here, sorry…”
“Yeah yeah, you don’t need to worry about me Steve it’s fine, I think I’m gonna just have a bit of a rest.”
Its quite a while later when he comes out of his daze, rubbing his face with his hands, predictably getting grease all over himself. The music was lowered to a more reasonable volume at some point while he was working, JARVIS likes to do that to ‘Preserve his hearing’.
Steve’s bag is quite small and Tony frowns at that before he remembers how much of his stuff was left behind at the compound. Still, there isn’t much back at the tower now either, he’s gonna need some more clothes. Steve has never really liked having lots of stuff, Tony knows that, but it still feels wrong that he’s only got what, 10 shirts? That however is a problem for later, the current problem is that he and Steve are quite close together as they walk out of the airport, a little too close for Tony’s liking actually. He doesn’t want to move away though, doesn’t want to make him feel bad so he’s just going to have to put up with it until they get to the car. The walk is almost agonizing, its not long, he got a good parking spot, but they don’t say much, Steve politely asks after Pepper and Rhodey and Happy, and Tony responds equally politely. It’s awkward. Now that they’ve gotten the apologies out of the way neither of them is quite sure what to do around the other. Tony’s heart rate is far higher than it has any right to be by the time they get to the car and he’s fairly certain that its loud enough for Steve to hear. It’s a bit better once he gets into the driver’s seat but he can still hear the blood rushing in his ears. Probably not a great state to be driving in but he’s done it before. Luckily Steve hasn’t notice, or if he has he’s being much too polite to say anything. Tony’s not sure why this is so different from the conference, why everything feels so loud and bright and fragile. The part of his brain with any common sense left, which sounds remarkably like his therapist, reminds him that he is in fact letting Steve back into his home and how that is an extremely big deal. The rest of his brain, which unfortunately sounds just like him, says that’s stupid. He’s got himself slightly more under control when they arrive at the tower, the cool fall air helping to soothe his nerves slightly. They’re standing in the elevator when someone finally speaks again.
“Hey Tony.”
Tony yawns and briefly thinks he should’ve arrived the day prior but then again that would’ve just afforded him more time to worry in an empty room in a foreign government facility. Rhodey and Nat are behind him, talking quietly about one thing or another, Tony can’t bring himself to care enough to try to listen in, if it was important they’d tell him.
Hopefully I can or this is going to be really awkward and terrible. I wish you would’ve given me an actual date when you were coming back, waiting like this is agonizing. At any rate I should get back to work, there’s a lot to do.
“Oh?” Tony says quietly, he doesn’t seem to remember any other words.
I still can’t believe you gave me a flip phone, this thing is fucking archaic. No, I’m not calling you. I said I didn’t want to talk to you and that point still stands. I will however, complain about this absolutely philistine technology. Speaking of that though, what kind of bullshit letter was that Rogers? “The Avengers were your family”, cut the crap. They were our family, or did you not notice how half of them sided with you and left, I feel like that one would be a little hard to ignore. I know sometimes you feel like you don’t belong but come on… you were our leader, our fucking stalwart hero. Not perfect, but good, and honest (hah). Wonder when that all changed, when you decided I couldn’t handle the truth. When you decided you knew what was best for me… As if it wasn’t to spare yourself.
12:30 PM
It’s quarter to 5 when his phone rings, Steve will be heading into the arrivals area in a few minutes. He heads over to the edge of baggage claim, throwing away his half empty coffee cup and brushing off his suit nervously. Damn he really needs to get a handle on those tics, he’s in public this is just silly. It feels like an eternity before he sees Steve, he always stands out in a crowd even without the uniform, oh huh the beard’s gone, Tony is good with that, it’s nice to see his face properl- and that train of thought is abruptly shut down. It’s only a moment later that Steve sees him, his face shifting almost imperceptibly from a polite but neutral expression to a faint smile, his lips twitching upwards as he gives Tony a nod. Tony realizes he’s smiling far too late after it happens and just lets it be.
Tony, sitting in the back since he’s no longer really an Avenger, keeps his eyes on everybody in the room. He notices Rhodey, who is facing Ross completely, with his left elbow leaning on the table as he listels intently. He’s always been good at these type of things; briefings and debriefings. He can keep concentrated on all the boring stuff that is usually said. Right now, he seems in his element, despite the uneasiness that is easily read off him.
“I’m…afraid,” Yaël gasped between her words and started to feel lightheaded, black dots appeared in her vision.
“Uh, I’m Iron Man,” he explains.
“Peter, come on, open up! It’s Rhodey!” somebody says. That’s when Peter realizes that the pounding is not just in his head. It’s his head reacting to the noise coming out of the hallway. Peter sighs and walks out of his room with careful steps. Once he’s at the door, he realizes he might not really appear his best. He’s sure he can convince Rhodey not to tell Aunt May, or at least he hopes so.
That place was designed for people like Loki, or the Mandarin. The Avengers shouldn’t be in there…
So when he dances with Wade – Thor help him – Peter shouldn’t be surprised when his drunk ass comes too close to his face again. Peter pulls back immediately, getting some laughter from the group.
Somehow, she got in this way too crowed and noisy living room. Who even lived here? Wait, how long ago did she get out of that cab? Someone offered her a drink, she willingly accepted it. Why was she here again?
“I feel great, especially now,” Peter says, pulling away from Natasha while the grin on his face stays wide. After that, Peter turns towards Barnes, who is still standing next to Natasha, though a bit awkwardly. “We’ve met before, but I’m Peter.”
So they get something together. Wanda and Clint try and distract the guards while Steve, Bucky and Sam attempt to sneak out of the castle. The plan is fool proof, and they even get themselves all the way into the city. It’s only then that they realize Steve doesn’t have any papers. They don’t allow him on the plane.
“Sure they are,” he returns. “You have something for us?”
“Uh, I don’t suppose it has anything to do with my science project?” Peter tries, only to receive a scowl from both Mr. Morita and Mr. Stark. Peter gulps, knowing this is not the right time to be funny. “Or maybe because I punched a bully in the face?”
I might have finished writing the third chapter of the sequel to Being A Stark yesterday. As it turns out, I'm having trouble finding a name for the title. In case anybody has any ideas for it, don't hesitate to let me know! I'll add a little summary for it in the end notes :-)
Bruce shakes his head.
“You designed all of this yourself, didn’t you?” Tony asks, walking towards the web against the wall and pulling on it. He smiles when he sees it won’t come off. “How did you do it? You messed around and accidentally got to it?”
The perfect example is at the dinner table. May and Rhodey are there as well, giving each other quick smiles and awkward glances that make Peter want to roll his eyes. On the other side of the table, there's Natasha and Bucky, the two of them looking a bit out of place as they observe the happenings around them.
he thinks. Or maybe he says it. He’s not sure.
“Oh, yes, class, we have a new student from today. Mr. Lyman, right?”
Natasha sighs.
It’s evening, only an hour after they’ve managed to get rid of Venom as Peter came to call it. It’s locked up, put safely away in Tony’s lab where they’ll deal with it in a bit. Right now, though, it seems like everybody just needs a moment to breathe. So after the Avengers have returned from Strange’s, and everybody’s up to date with everything, the group disbands for the evening. Rhodey, Barnes and Natasha are the first to get back down, wishing everybody goodnight before they head towards the elevator. Vision is next, immediately followed by Wanda. Clint and Sam take a moment longer to get rid of, but eventually, they, too, head downstairs.
“Dude, she’s my chick, we’re married! The girl is my property, I even pee on her every now and then!” Yaël curled her nose a bit after Wade’s reply. But she wasn’t thinking fast enough to talk back, this was all so random.
Tony feels weird, having to park his car in the street like this. Before he can get out of the car to pay for a parking ticket, Steve’s already on the job. That stubborn bastard. Tony smiles slightly while looking down to the ground, still not really able to grasp how lucky he is to have Steve.
“Well, she surely didn’t have an appointment,” Stark answered dryly. For some reason, the secretary didn’t answer to that anymore.
“Karen, where exactly are we?” Peter asks.
“Oh, he’s a real smarty! He was even doubting to study electrical engineering or biochemistry.”
Bucky was somewhere still inside of there, and I was ready to die to get that part of him back out.”
“Oh, T’Challa is like that, too, sometimes,” Nakia returns. Tony shakes his head and frowns at her. “I mean with the dealing with his problems by himself-part. The kicking me out-part he hasn’t even dared to try, yet.”
Horrified, out of breath and with a heart beating too fast, Tony looks up at Steve, who seems equally shocked by what just happened. Then, Steve pulls the shield away, throwing it to the side and leaning down onto his elbows as he tries to catch his breath.
“Peter… Stark. I’m Tony’s son,” he repeats. He can understand Bruce’s confusion in this.
“So you and Stark, it’s going well, isn’t it?” Sam asks. Steve shrugs.
“Hey, I don’t blame you,” Yaël says. “I mean, you’re a Stark. Your social skills already leave much to be desired.”
“Tony, I just lost Peggy. I didn’t really think-“
“Please, you don’t understand; I can’t go back to the old suit! This is all I have now; I’m nothing without this suit!”
Tony nods. “Boyfriend,” he says with a smile. Or… wait, is he? There was a thing about their relationship, wasn’t there? Something he’s forgetting. “He’ll come, soon. He’s been away.”
Hanging out with Natasha was easier. She was this sort of woman that wouldn’t take his crap. She would kick his ass at any given moment, and she would die to keep your secrets. Granted, Natasha Romanoff was easily the most secretive person in the world, and it was pretty hard to get a read on her. While Steve knew pretty much every member of the Avengers’ backgrounds, Natasha remained pretty vague, still.
“Yes, just come in,” he says, voice still raspy. The door opens while he walks back to his bed. Suddenly there are arms surrounding him and a girl about his size hugging him tightly. He chuckles a little bit, patting her back. “Here’s my Munchkin.”
, really? The only sympathy she’s shown him is when he was just about to get dumped, giving him cryptic messages about the both of them being fools when it comes to love.
Right when Peter wants to walk back to the door, still muttering out curses under his breath, a cold chill passes through him. A warning; something is about to happen.
“You might have mentioned it once or twice,” Tony responds. “It’s not surprising, though, since I’m quite easy to love.”
“If I’m so important now, then tell me why the king and queen banished me in the first place.”
to me, Steve?” he asks, not hiding the pain in his voice. He doesn’t care if others can see them, doesn’t care what they’d think. All that matters right now is Steve; making things right.
“I have news,” Steve suddenly said, pulling Yaël from her thoughts. She looked up smiling, unable to hide her relief. ‘I have news’ sounded like he was going to talk about himself. “Tony and I… we are to-tog-, well, we are in a rela- eh-“
“Oh, Peter,” Steve whispers next to his head. His hand goes straight to Peter’s hair. Peter grabs on to his back, not wanting to let go at all.
- Bullying (this story we're REALLY going to start working on Flash, be sure of that!)
“Yeah, and you’re Peter, right?” Ned asks in return. When Peter raises an eyebrow, Ned just shrugs. “People talk around here, you know,” he adds. Peter knows he’s talking about Gwen, and the fact that he’s failing his classes. He wants to say something, but suddenly the teacher looks at him with a stern expression.
“Tony, when did you get here?”
A soft noise next to him startles him, and when Peter turns around, he finds the girl’s messy purple hair underneath the sheets. She’s got her back towards him, but it doesn’t take a genius to understand what this looks like.
“Yaël? Is it you?” Steve sounded tired, but hopeful.
While Steve gets to the gym, Tony decides to head to the common room. Maybe there’s somebody there he can say hello to. There’s no door, just the opening – Vision accidentally pulled it out when he was trying to use it for a change – so Tony wanders in easily, without any warning. On first glance, there doesn’t seem to be anybody in here.
Ross didn't only go to see the Avengers in regards to the accords.
Tony doesn’t even look up.
“Like I’ve been tossed against a building a few times,” Peter tries to joke, but neither Aunt May nor Tony seem to be laughing. They now sit at either side of his bed, but while Aunt May keeps her hand on his, Mr. Stark seems hesitant on reaching out. Instead, he turns his head towards Steve, who is still standing at the door.
There’s another grunt of pain. Peter curses at himself for being so weak. Slowly but surely he gets back on his feet, only to be tackled by Venom once again. This time, there’s no ground to land on. They’re falling into the open air, Peter trying his best to hold back Eddie’s fists while at the same time reaching his webs towards the buildings around them. He needs something, anything, that would make him stop falling.
Stark, that drama-causing guy…
“Dr. Doom,” she says, starting to explain the situation to Steve. Tony doesn’t listen, instead standing there on the balcony with his arms crossed, knowing that he’s pouting. Clint sees this as an excellent opportunity to start annoying him.
Peter walks through the front door as if nothing ever happened. He shouldn’t be surprised that both Johnny and MJ are seated on the couch, both with controllers in their hands while racing each other in Johnny’s silly game. Peter smirks when he sees it, realizing they haven’t heard him enter.
He can take care of this, himself. He can prove it.
“What’s the rush?” Tony asks in confusion.
Steve picks up almost immediately.
“Come on,” Yaël said with an unbelieving smile on her face. “Like you are going to leave a room filled with people staring at you to come and check on me. I know you’re not really standing in front of me!” She gave his leg a friendly tap with her elbow, expecting him to disappear, but the man felt solid.
