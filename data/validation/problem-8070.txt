And every time they pass Peggy in the halls and Steve turns that same bright smile on her, Tony feels washed cold and brittle. The vise in his chest tightens and tightens until he can barely breathe, and he feels as though he can shake apart into a million pieces if not for the warm press of Steve against his side.
“Hey, everything okay?”
“As my love wishes,” Steve says, turning Tony around and bending to scoop him up.
“Yeah,
Steve doesn't seem to mind. He seems all too happy to see Tony whenever he plops down in his lap during lunch, when he spots him sitting high in the bleachers overlooking football practice, when he waits by Steve's locker to go home with him.
Steve, Tony decides, is a little shit. And Tony—Tony is so very, very fucked. Especially when Steve has the audacity to ask—
He supposes it’s all good and convenient. This way, Steve will have more time to spend with Peggy without Tony hanging around him like a desperate puppy begging for scraps. He’s certain his presence is keeping Peggy at arms length, and he frowns, just wondering now why Steve hasn’t made more of an effort to win her back. Tony hasn’t pushed it because he’s been selfishly enjoying Steve’s attention, but what’s Steve’s excuse?
, he reminds himself. They must always be moving forward. There is little point in dwelling on the foregone past.
“Holy shit,” Loki echoes.
Tony scoffs in mock outrage. “This is
?” Tony snarls, tired of this conversation. He wants to leave right the fuck now. “It doesn't matter anymore,” he adds for good measure, but the words telling Steve the letter doesn't mean anything stick in his throat and refuse to budge. He deflects. “You're with Peggy now. It doesn't matter. The letter does not matter.”
A low simmering hunger claws at his belly, the feral side of him that only Steve can bring out coming to the surface as he watches his husband dress in the mirror. The gala tonight is important, but all priorities suddenly disappear when Steve looks so resplendent in his finery, all dark velvet and silk and gold.
"'Sup,” he had said to the other occupants of the table when he sat down next to Steve during that first week. They were all gaping at the both of them, staring at where Steve and Tony were linked by their hands, looking shellshocked. “Tony Stark,” he had said pompously, relying heavily on his best and most plasticky smile to keep the nerves from showing.
They make popcorn and fight over what to watch. Eventually Steve wins and they work their way through two episodes of the original series before Steve finally concedes to watch the reboot, and only because Tony makes his best puppy eyes at Steve. The sun has long set outside the windows, casting the living room in long dark shadows, the only illumination glowing from the TV screen.
Steve rising out of the water is a sight to behold. He breaks from the surface with a cascade of droplets raining from his body, a monsoon dripping from his illustrated skin. Tony tracks the rivulets of water sliding down Steve’s chest avidly, eyes following the drops as they trail along his husband’s perfect golden inked torso and feeling fiery hunger flare redhot in his belly. He feels greedy and jealous watching the water touch his husband so intimately when he himself is still too far to reach.
Tony feels like he wants to cry, and stronger yet is the urge to fall at Pepper’s feet and beg for forgiveness for his stupidity. He doesn't know what to say, can't even begin to form the words to beg, and her expression softens as she holds out her arms. He falls gratefully into her embrace, thinks he might be close to sobbing as she strokes gentle hands down his back.
“Ma!” Steve sounds mortified, blushing furiously red. He's still laying on top of Tony, hands pinning his arms up on the armrest and neither of them have gathered enough of their wits to scramble upright. “It's not what it looks like, I swear—”
“And you deserve the world,” Jarvis continues. “You deserve someone who loves you that much, someone who thinks you're the center of the universe and accepts all of you. Someone who thinks you're the most beautiful being in the world, someone who will fight for you. I was very much hoping you would find this love when I saw you with Steven.”
The enormous house is full by the time they arrive, packed to the rafters with the team and their friends, people from school, and even members of the opposing team. Someone found the controls for the speakers and there's loud music filtering from the sound system with enough bass to make the floors shake. There's a makeshift bar on the dining room table covered from one end to the other with bottles of everything from bourbon and whiskey to beer and soda. Someone tries to push a drink into Tony's hand as they weave through the crowd that's taken over Thor’s cavernous living room.
before his tenuous hold on lucidity finally gives and he slips down into the darkness that swallows him whole.
Everything happens in rapid fire flashes. Their team makes immaculate play after play, but the other team matches them point for point. The first quarter wanes into the second, halftime a brief respite for both sides to catch their breaths. The third quarter starts with renewed vigor, both teams trying their best to snatch the lead. The end of the fourth quarter is drawing to a tense nail biting close when the final play is handed off to Steve. The score is still tied.
He is not the only one to get his letter.
so when he’s wrong. So seeing Loki look unsettled wakes Tony up faster than the coffee, and he can't help but feel a chill crawl down his spine.
Steve huffs a sigh but there's a smile pulling up the corner of his lip and laughter dancing in his eyes. “First,” he says, in the obstinate tone that Tony's grown to love, “it's gross that we’re talking about my mom knowing anything about my sex life. Second, it doesn't mean we should confirm her suspicions.”
Tony quietly swears up a blue streak when he realizes it's Pepper and he really doesn't want to deal with this right now. Everything is such a mess, he's going to hurt her and Rhodey one way or another, and they're going to realize it's not worth it to be his friend, he's too much effort, he's too messy, he's too selfish, she probably read the letter already, he can hear the confusion and regret in her voice, and oh god why did he ever write those letters he's so dumb and stupid and childish to do something so ridic—
Tony pauses, pushing away slightly to look at Steve. “Yeah, I do,” he finally says after a beat. He hates how low his voice gets when he says it and he's certain Steve knows he's not just talking about body parts. “I really fucking do. I can't fucking believe the first time you said that to me, you were telling me to brush my teeth.”
“In the darkness, two shadows, reaching through the hopeless, heavy dusk. Their hands meet, and light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun.”
!) children.
Afterwards when they’re laying in bed after Steve licks the come out of Tony before filling him again, Tony rolls over to lay on Steve’s chest. He smiles warmly at his husband, but completely ruins the soft moment when he says, “you liked the panties.”
“But—“ Steve starts to protest but stops when Pepper puts a hand on his arm. He nods. “Okay. I’ll see you back in our room?”
“Oh, did we?” he asks, perplexed. He tries to recall but his memory is failing him. “I don't really remember.”
“Well, I'll take your word for it, Steve,” she says lightly, the corners of her lips tilting up. “But a reminder that you have a perfectly nice bedroom upstairs,
“Don't be so dramatic, Tones,” Rhodey sighs, still holding Pepper’s arm. “It's only like four hours away.”
“So, that was nice,” Tony says flippantly. “Thanks for that. But I uh, really gotta go. Dear old dad has something for me. Emergency Stark business. Important Stark Industries stuff. Yep. Super urgent SI thingamabob,” he adds before clamping his mouth shut against the rising urge to ramble. “I'll see you later, Rogers.”
“Pepper?” Tony asks, the word choking in his throat.
He can see the quickening rise and fall of Tony’s chest as the moments pass and Steve’s hands dip lower to linger at his hips. If Steve spreads his fingers, the span of his hands can almost entirely encircle Tony’s waist. That’s a thought that’s always heated Steve to the core, the very notion that he can hold so much of Tony in his hands. Seeing it in the mirror quickens Steve’s breath and fans the embers igniting in his chest.
“So,” Steve replies, his knuckles white as he grips the counter.
Tony drags him down for another kiss, and Steve can taste salt on his lips. He blindly reaches up to wipe the moisture from his husband’s cheek, his thumb a gentle caress along the curve of Tony’s jaw. He’s unsure whose tears they are, but he kisses Tony’s face until the salt is gone, listening to the echo of Tony’s thudding heart pressed against his own.
“Tony.” There's the pity in Steve's voice again, and Tony has had enough of that from him for this lifetime.
“I dunno,” Steve says with a crooked smile. “It certainly adds another level of excitement to do it in public, doesn’t it?”
“Oh,” Steve says, his cheeks slightly pinked. “Ah, I didn’t make that, sorry. I didn’t think you would want me to cook for you so I’ve been going to that diner we met at? The one in Brooklyn, it’s like twelve blocks from my house. I figured you liked that place since it was your suggestion to meet there and the sandwich I had that time was pretty good and Ben’s deli is too crowded in the mornings so I just go get your—“
It takes Pepper shoving a very unsubtle elbow into his ribs to snap Tony out of his temporary stupor and he turns to glare at his best friend. “Close your mouth, Tony,” Pepper chides softly. “You’re going to catch flies like that.” Her tone is gentle despite the teasing, but Tony can see the worry in her eyes.
Steve hums quietly. “No,” he decides. “Actually, I’m going to write her a thank you card,” he says before pulling Tony back in for another kiss that makes his toes curl.
Steve raises his head off Tony’s lap and sits up. Tony tries his best to school his features when Steve looks at him with alarm, large hands reaching over to pull him close. The stroke of Steve’s fingers against his jaw and the press of Steve’s forehead against his is grounding, but Tony still feels out of his depth as his phone shrills and shrills in his hand.
“I don't want to trouble Happy like that,” Steve replies, frowning slightly.
“Wow.”
“Humble too,” Natasha adds, accepting another fry from Tony’s hand.
“Tony, can we please talk?” Steve asks, and Tony wishes he would stop saying his name so plaintively.
“It’s not across the country—”
perfect? You’re complaining your boyfriend is treating you too well,” she says flatly.
That thought doesn’t stop him from pulling Steve close though, and wrapping his arms around Steve’s broad shoulders as Steve nods and leans down for another kiss. It certainly doesn’t stop him from helping Steve tug his clothes off and draw him close until they’re pressed skin to skin. It doesn’t stop him from breathlessly crying out Steve’s name as Steve busses tender kisses down his body, from neck to ribs to navel and finally to take Tony in his mouth.
“That was what you wanted,” Tony points out. “That was the contract. You don't have to explain anything to me because I fucking get it, so if that's all you want to talk about, we’re just repeating ourselves over and over again—”
“Just turned one,” Rhodey says quietly and the guilt and horror and panic screeches to a halt in Tony’s head.
,” Tony breathes, angry at himself all over again. “I can't believe it's already December.”
Tony tries to have as normal of a day as possible despite everything but he still feels blindsided when the first note comes because he had somehow forgotten Steve's self-added stipulation.
Tony struggles to be fair, because he’d spent nearly a month in space with no communications, and everyone understandably probably thought he didn’t make it. But, he’s here now. He’s—home.
“I want to,” Steve says simply, but he draws away. Tony misses his warmth and instinctively steps closer to Steve. He fits so perfectly in the slot of Steve's arms, it hurts and aches and burns and it's stupid, it's so, so,
He looks over at Tony snuggled up against his shoulder and knows he’ll need a course of action to prove over and over how deserving Tony is of admiration and love, how much of that he already has. Good thing Steve is nothing if not a man with a plan.
Steve instantly turns an endearing and rather alarming shade of cherry and Tony has to resist kissing him again. He turns before he gives in to the impulse and tries to ignore the stares as he walks away, Steve’s gaze feeling the sharpest and hottest between his shoulder blades.
“Your note for today,” Steve says, pushing it towards Tony.
“Trust me?” Steve asks.
Morgan grabs his hand. “Ready,” she declares.
“I would never stop you from anything,” Tony replies softly, reaching over to squeeze her hand. “Especially not anything that's paving the way for your world domination.”
Tony lasts an embarrassing total of one and a half minutes, surprised he even made it that long when Steve is looking at him like that. He only makes it past the minute mark because he’s counting the seconds to stave off his orgasm. He’s tumbling off the edge when he feels Steve’s hand trail down from the base of his cock to press his palm up against his balls. Long fingers reach back to trace gentle circles around his rim, a soft touch that electrifies every part of Tony and he can feel the heat rushing from his belly down, toes curling against the floor and his harsh grip on Steve’s hair must hurt. He tries to warn Steve, but Steve only grips his thighs tight and swallows, sighing as Tony comes down his throat.
Rhodey’s smile widens. “I know,” he says gently. And of course Rhodey knows. He’s the only one Tony’s ever told of his childhood crush on Captain America. “I remember the Captain America posters in our dorm, years and years ago, and the action figures. Remember that one time I walked in on you with th—”
Tony inhales sharply and doesn’t have the heart to tell her it won’t be the same without her son there. “I know, Mama, thank you,” he says instead.
Tony laughs as he helps himself to Steve's soggy fries.
Steve scrunches his face a little. “It’s—the exhibit looks interesting. It’s only going to be around for a few weeks, but if you don’t have time, it’s fine—“
That was really not anything Tony could have expected. “Are we breaking up?” he asks, perplexed. He's really not sure what this is about and he's wracking his brain for what he might've done wrong.
“Are you alright?” she asks, her brow furrowed with concern.
Steve sighs. “Sandra is my friend,” he says. “The soda is just because she’s doing me a favor. It’s my way of thanking her. I don’t take advantage of this special privilege because I would never want her to get into trouble because of me. It’s not about what you can do for people, or how much you can pay them to do something for you, Tony,” he says, and Tony doesn’t have a reply for that because that’s all he really knows. In his world, everyone has a price.
They seem happy enough to Tony whenever he passes them in the hall, laughing and joking with each other, Steve's arm always casually slung across Peggy's shoulders. They're looking for all the world like they're wildly in love. He tries not to think about the rumors, and how they could've possibly started and ignores them because they're none of his business.
Tony's whole world grinds to a screeching halt, and the shock hits him so hard, he nearly falls over. His knees are weak and his legs are unsteady, he thinks he might throw up.
“I can ask Happy to drive you back later,” Tony says, trying not to sound like he's begging but he desperately wants Steve to stay. He doesn't want to be left alone with his cold realization, to have to face it by himself, and think of what it'll mean for the not too distant future. “Stay for now.”
Are they there yet? Can they say these things to each other again? Can they be like they were a lifetime ago when this kind of bantering came as naturally as breathing for the both of them, Steve matching Tony’s sharp tongue wit for wit?
Tony shakes his head adamantly. “When we get home,” he says, and he thinks he means it this time. This has gone on for long enough, and he doesn’t know if he can keep doing this when it’s all a farce. He needs to know what Steve decides, one way or another, and he thinks maybe he’s had more than his share of borrowed time already.
They get lost in each other, pressed as close to each other as possible in the chair with Tony straddling Steve’s lap as they kiss. Steve’s big hands are already sliding underneath Tony’s jacket, brushing up the back of his sweater and pulling the hem from his pants to reach skin. The first touch of Steve’s palms against his sides sends a full body shiver down Tony’s spine and heats him to the core. Steve’s touch is reverent where he runs gentle fingers along his ribs, careful along Tony’s right side where his scars are raised and red and sensitive, heavy keloid ropes he’s still self conscious of on the bad days. But Steve’s touch always burns him from the inside out warm and slow, and he can’t help but feel whole in his embrace.
“We’re going to get started on some cookies,” Loki declares, his voice too bright, too cheerful. “You're just going to get underfoot and mess up the recipe again. Shoo! Off with you.”
“Got a stipulation though,” Steve murmurs when they finally pull away, but he stays close enough to press their foreheads together as though he’s reluctant to part too.
He nearly drops the slip of paper that Steve presses into his hand between second and third period in the hall and almost collides into a freshman when he turns whipquick to see Steve hiding a smile behind his hand as they pass. He holds up the paper and looks across the hall at Steve with a raised brow in question, but Steve only winks and adjusts the strap of his bag on his shoulder as he walks away, Tony staring after him this time.
He can hear the growl in Steve’s tone when he replies, “fuck
“So,” Tony says, cupping his hands around the mug.
Despite the rocky start, their fake date ends up being a lot of fun. Tony hadn't expected it, but Steve shows a lot of interest in NASA and the history of space travel with keen excitement for the exhibit bordering on giddiness. They tour the planetarium slowly as Tony babbles at Steve, unloading information on him in a continuous nervous stream and Steve smiles indulgently and lets him ramble about the Hubble telescope and how when they landed Apollo 11 on the moon, all of NASA’s computing power can fit inside of a modern thumb drive. He prompts Tony along with interesting questions, and they spend much of the afternoon circling the space exhibit as they talk.
Tony’s eyes are downcast in their reflection when he says with an overly bright voice, “Just peachy, sunshine. Let’s go to bed,” but Steve doesn’t budge.
thing,” Steve says. “You can't keep calling me by my last name. That's really weird for people who are dating. You need to start calling me by my actual name.”
Jarvis smiles sadly as he places a plate of cookies in Tony's hands. “Lies are unbecoming of you. Now I believe your friends are waiting,” he says. “Also, do visit us after Christmas when you have the time. Ana has been complaining about how she hasn't seen you in nearly a year. We don't only exist on birthdays and holidays you know,” he chides.
Tony isn't sure how long they kiss for, but it's not for nearly long enough. He's breathless by the time Steve moves away, the end of the kiss tapering off slow and languid, turning into sleepy little butterfly kisses peppered along the line of Tony's jaw before ending with little nuzzles of Steve's nose against the sensitive skin of his neck. Tony's heart is jackhammering out of his chest, painful and stuttering but he can't get enough of this, can't get enough of Steve. He curls his fingers into Steve's shirt and holds on tight.
your business and this is about
one on the team after all, he has plenty of other things to look at, and the world certainly doesn't revolve around Steven fucking Grant Rogers, not that Tony cares about him one tiny bit. “What is he? Goalie?”
“Guess so,” Steve agrees softly.
can fell his empire. Pen is mightier than the microchip and all that.
the result would be. I was stupid to get so invested.”
That shuts Steve up. He watches silently, no longer trying to explain whatever it was he was trying to explain as Tony reaches into his bag and pulls out the tablet they had signed their contract on. Tony tosses it at Steve, who fumbles the catch and they both watch silently as the tablet falls onto the slush covered concrete. The screen cracks, and isn't that a pretty analogy, Tony thinks.
,” Steve breathes as he hitches Tony's legs higher, large hands spanning the curve of his ass to hold him open. Steve’s thrusts stutter as he looks down to where he's grinding into Tony, the rim of him stretched wide and pink.
They're distracted on the way to the kitchen for food when Steve laughingly asks Tony to dance as a slower song shuffles onto the speakers. At first, Tony doesn't think he means it but Steve's eyes are wide and earnest in the low light.
If I had had words to speak such a thing, I would have. But there were none that seemed big enough for it, to hold that swelling truth."
“Clint's right,” Bucky interjects. “Steve is probably the dorkiest loser out of all of us.”
Tony sighs. Steve pets his hair reassuringly.
“Okay,” Loki says, raising one elegant brow.
Steve has been getting increasingly panicked about him if his texts and notes are anything to go by. His messages keep asking him how he's doing and his little handwritten notes keep imploring him to eat and reminding him that coffee does not count as a food group.
“Here,” Tony interrupts, not listening. He’s glad Steve seems to be in a much better mood about the situation, but there are things they need to clear up. He shoves a tablet into Steve’s hands. “Sign here, here, here, here, and here, and initial in these spots.” He helpfully points to them with the tip of his pen.
Tony's brain screeches to a grinding halt. “Wait wait wait wait wait,” he cries, finally managing to stop Steve's tirade as he holds his hands up. “Stop.
Tony has already put her through so much—she deserves every happiness in the world. She deserves everything he was never able to give her.
Tony slips out of bed, not bothering to pull on a robe. He helps himself to a cup of coffee just to feel a little bit more awake, breathing in the sharp dark aroma. His gaze sweeps around the suite as though Steve might pop up from behind the couch at any given moment when Tony hears the splash of water just outside on the balcony. He bites back the smile that threatens to form. He should’ve known.
“You got it, Sandra.”
“He's coming home in two weeks,” Pepper reminds him.
They pass the tree tucked in the corner of the living room Tony had helped decorate two weeks ago. It's so tall, the top of the star is brushing the ceiling. It's bedecked in lights and a hodgepodge of ornaments Sarah has from her family passed down through the generations, with presents piled beneath the lowermost boughs. There are stacks of candles flickering merrily in the defunct fireplace, the mantle strung with holly and sparkling gold garland. Christmas carols are playing on the radio and Tony can see Sarah puttering around in the kitchen as they step through the entry.
“I love you so much, sweetheart,” Steve says, all playfulness dropping away into earnest honesty.
“I’m never going to surrender!” Tony says, feeling giddiness bubble up inside of him. The hysteria must be infiltrating his brain as it runs haywire from the overload of the tickling and Steve's warm weight bearing down on him. It's just too much.
Tony sighs, already feeling overwhelmed by everything bearing down on him all at once. Good things only last so long for him, and even having a couple of days for a weekend to spend with friends has been a luxury. It’s back to work as soon as they get back to New York the next afternoon and Tony expects he’ll be spending every spare hour in the lab from now until graduation.
Steve looks wonderstruck. “Married,” he echoes, and takes Tony by the hand to lead him to bed.
The team had turned out to be pretty cool once they all get used to Tony doing his Tony Stark thing and learned to see past the bullshit. Tony begins to think maybe it's not all that bad as he leans back against Steve’s chest. Maybe he can survive this, he thinks, as he watches Clint Barton and Bucky sign furiously back and forth, arguing about the details of their next D&D game as Thor interjects every once in a while. His voice is a loud jarring boom in contrast with the low voices and rapid fire sign language Clint and Bucky prefer.
Steve intimately knows the pain of hating his own reflection. He’s suffered through years of broken disconnect, not seeing the weak sickly boy from Brooklyn in the hulking soldier who stares back at him in the glass. It had taken Tony and ink and no small amount of pain to reclaim the biggest parts of himself and seeing the same ache he once knew in Tony's eyes breaks Steve’s heart.
Tony sighs, dropping his hand on top of hers. His heartbeat beneath both their palms is sluggishly slow despite how fast the thoughts are whirling in his head. “Thanks for coming, but you don’t have to worry about me. I’m not sick or dying or anything. I’ll get over this.”
Tony doesn't quite know what to say to that, but his chest freezes cold at the thought of Steve enlisting. It's the same cold feeling he gets when he thinks of Rhodey's future in the Air Force, when his best friend will be overseas and there will be nothing Tony can do to protect either of them. He thinks of his father's weapons, and the words bubble up to beg Steve to never consider something like that, but it's not his plea to make. He can easily pay Steve's tuition to any college he likes but he knows Steve would never take his money. Not strong independent Steve who works hard for everything he has. It would be insulting to even offer.
The reprimand Tony is expecting doesn't come. Instead, one of Steve's hands covers his own on his chest and his fingertips are light where they tenderly touch Tony's cheek, thumb sweeping over the dark smudges under his eyes. His lips follow his fingers, a gentle kiss pressed to Tony's cheek followed by the softest of sighs.
“Heya Steve,” the man says and nods a greeting at Tony, politely not saying anything about the tabloids at the front of his store splashed with Tony's face and family business. “Long time no see.”
Tony sighs again. “I'm sorry for thinking otherwise,” he murmurs. “I'm sorry for not trusting you to be the mature one, because we both know we can't count on me to do that like ever, but I should've known you would've understood and made everything okay.”
He builds his first robot from the discovery channel engineering kit Jarvis and Ana gave him for Christmas, a box of mostly plastic building blocks and rudimentary circuit boards with a handful of blinking lights. It's a simple thing, but Tony has never been satisfied with simple. He doesn't really care to build a toy bot arm that swivels back and forth. No, he wants it to have fingers and dexterity, and he wants it to be able to close those fingers to pick things up.
“Yeah,” Tony finally concedes, laughing a little, the sound mirthless. “Tough parents, huh.”
“No,” she says. “He doesn’t know anything anything about this aside from the letter he got. He had nothing to do with sending them.”
Steve’s hands are frantically pushing the jacket from Tony’s shoulders and he hurries to help him. Next goes the turtleneck and Tony’s belt. They get flung unceremoniously to the side of the chair as they both get to work on his pants. Those get pushed down too, and Tony has to momentarily leave Steve’s lap to get them off.
“And you really are like Spock,” Steve says after a yawning stretch of silence. “You're incredibly smart and focused. I've never met anyone as smart as you. But you're also very hard to read. You have all of these layers and you build all of these walls to keep people out because you don't want people to see your real emotions.”
you,” Steve interrupts. His eyes are wide and wild and desperate and painfully, excruciatingly honest. He moves as though to step closer but visibly forces himself to stop. “I fucking
“It’s improving,” Tony admits, his expression softening as he looks at his husband. He sighs with satisfaction. “But it could get even better.”
Steve had weighed all of ninety pounds soaking wet when he came running to Tony's defense years ago. Steve had taken on four bullies twice their size and gotten two black eyes to save him. And here is Steve saving Tony again.
“Oh my god,” Tony groans, finally giving into the urge to cover his face with his hands. He waits until Sarah walks out of earshot before reminding Steve, “bad porno.”
Steve looks dazed as his eyes flick from Tony’s face and down to his tags hanging around Tony’s neck resting on his chest and down again to the panties he’s wearing, black silk and lace stretched obscenely over his erection. Steve doesn’t answer for a long moment, simply touching and running his hands along the thin lace band sitting on the crest of Tony’s hips and following the pads of his fingers over the cut of the panties on the curve of his ass, and further back to where they disappear as a strip between his cheeks.
That’s Steve standing in the entry to his lab calling his name, and Tony is sorely tempted to throw his soldering iron across the room. He does not want to be in the same room as Steve, not now, not when everything still hurts so much, not when he’s still licking his wounds trying to pick up the scattered pieces of himself, and maybe not ever.
He had wondered if they're just random classmates Steve sees and sketches from observation, or if the sad eyes framed with long lashes and the rough hands with a slightly crooked pinky Steve always draws belong to someone in particular. Someone Steve can't stop thinking about. And now Tony knows. He’s the one Steve is always drawing.
“And then Sam, T’Challa, a lot of the Wakandans who helped us. Then Wanda went, and Vision with her after Thanos took the Mind Stone. And Rocket’s friend Groot. We lost T’Challa’s sister. We lost Fury, and Hill and—“
“It felt real at the end,” Tony says, “I really thought it was, but I was an idiot, and I only saw what I wanted to see. I wanted so badly for Steve to care about me, I managed to delude myself into believing it for a little while.” He laughs bitterly. “They've been calling me smart my whole life. Prodigy, genius, futurist. But they're all wrong. I'm not sure what's worse: getting into the situation in the first place, or actually thinking Steve liked me. I was an idiot to ever get myself into this mess, J.”
,” Tony replies, his voice little more than a breathy sigh. He can't help but notice the way Steve's eyes dilate at the sound. “I'm going to fucking kill you if you stop—” his voice breaking apart into a stuttering gasp as Steve presses open mouthed kisses along the column of his neck and the side of his jaw. “Yeah, this is
Tony snorts. “Like who? Loki? Natasha? Don't be ridiculous. Pepper and Rhodey would never believe any of us could date. Any combination with the people I mentioned would be a disaster. We would kill each other, or more likely they would kill me. Besides, Pepper saw
“I'll stay with you,” Steve says. “I'll keep you company.”
“Good!” Rhodey says cheerfully, smiling at the both of them. The smile grows blade sharp as he addresses Steve again, “so that means I don't have to tell you I
Tony feels like a little boy all over again, remembering all the times he sat in his mother’s room and watched avidly as she applied her makeup and dressed up for galas and balls and events. He had always been entranced seeing her go from beautiful to breathtaking with the swipe of a red lipstick and a line of black kohl around her dark eyes. It was a privilege to be asked to help her with her necklace, to fetch her earrings, to help her pick a pair of shoes to go with her dress.
All the nerves seep out of Tony’s body when he sees Steve’s smile, and he’s left only with the swelling emotion in his heart and the wet prickling heat in his eyes. He can barely breathe for the emotion that clogs his throat.
“It’s a good thing I love him,” Tony says, his voice dipping to a low intimate quiet as he drags his hand up from Steve’s shoulder to cup his jaw. He can feel the bob of Steve’s throat as he swallows, eyes half lidded as he stares down at Tony.
“I would love to see your work,” Tony says honestly, pushing the thought of Peggy away for now. He lowers his voice so only Steve hears. The others return to their lunches and bickering, but this feels private somehow, and for whatever reason, he doesn't want Steve's friends to overhear them.
“Nope, and Happy has the night off. We might even have to take the subway,” Natasha replies cheerfully.
Tony sighs and puts his phone down. He’s about to dive back into his lines of code when the lab doors open and Pepper walks in.
Tony breathes through his nose and nods tersely, making up his mind. “I’ll just be a moment, Happy. Thank you.”
“My room,” Steve repeats as though he doesn’t quite understand, “is, uh, really—messy. It’s messy!”
Steve doesn’t look like he’s holding back his punches, but Natasha is fast and agile, dodging around his fists and deflecting his blows like they’re nothing. Tony watches wondrously as Natasha twines her legs around Steve’s neck and takes him crashing down onto the mat. Not for the first time, he wonders if she has some super soldier serum in her veins. He watches as they smile at each other, soft and almost intimate as Steve gets up first and then helps Natasha up too.
“State champions!” Bucky crows loudly, his arms linked around Thor’s to carry Clint on their shoulders.
“Holy shit,” Clint gasps when they approach the heated indoor pool.
“Not if we don't want it to be,” Tony replies. He kisses Steve again. “This is what they expect of us anyways,” he adds, the careless sweep of his arms encompassing the still cheering crowd and Peggy who is watching them from her huddle of cheerleaders. He doesn't want to talk about this. He's already aching to kiss Steve again.
He knows the future set ahead of him. It is unchangeable and unbendable, chosen for him before he was even born. He does not need to be good at writing to build weapons for his father’s company.
Steve chuckles. His cheek is pressed flush against Tony's and Tony can feel the smile curving Steve's mouth as he says, “I guess we're all a bit nerdy. Don't let the football uniforms fool you.”
“Does it work that way?”
“Are you doing this to torture me?” Steve asks, his eyes flicking up to Tony’s face again. His voice is gravel rough and his grip on Tony’s ass tightens.
Tony is running through the grass and throwing himself into Steve's waiting arms, laughing when Steve swings him up. Steve's large hands are cupping the crest of Tony's hips and he's curling his legs around Steve's waist and he's pulling Steve closer and in and then, his lips are pressing against Steve's, warm and soft and pliant and—they're kissing.
He locks himself in his basement lab for lengthy hours at a time so Jarvis would have gone home before he goes back upstairs. He can't find it in himself to talk to even Jarvis at the moment, everything overwhelming and painful. He knows Jarvis means well, but it's hard to stomach the idea of anyone, even Jarvis pitying him. Everything still feels too raw and sharp and he just wants to be alone.
Tony hesitates for a moment before he replies. He sees no reason to hide anymore, not if what he fears is true. If the letters had gotten out, Loki will find out sooner or later anyways.
“Well, you weren’t speaking to me at that time, and no matter what I tried—”
be ashamed of you. Besides,” he says, fondness slipping into his tone, “how can I ever be ashamed to have such a gorgeous silver fox on my arm?” Steve leans down to hook his chin over Tony’s shoulder as they lock eyes in their reflection.
“Oh wow,” Tony says, still chuckling. “Are you sure the kid wasn’t just trying to get nudes of you guys?” he jokes. “The whole team naked at the same time? I'm sure
Tony clutches at his chest dramatically. “Ouch, you wound me. I’ll have you know I’m an incredible catch. Brains as well as beauty. And an inheritance to a weapons company with a buffet of stock options all bundled up in one amazing package. Military liaisons sold separately.”
Tony stretches, arching his spine off the chair as he raises his arms, the entire curved bow of his body on display. He watches as Steve’s eyes track his every movement like Tony had done to Steve when he was getting out of the pool. Steve’s gaze feels like a liquid hot caress as it slides down from Tony's face to the long lean line of his torso, and further down to where Tony’s legs are splayed open in invitation. A deep curl of satisfaction blooms in Tony's chest when he sees the hungry expression on his husband’s face and he widens the sprawl of his thighs.
Tony heaves a loud sigh. “Fine,” Tony concedes imperiously, tossing the towel to the side as he sits up. His expression softens as he looks back at the small fond smile on Steve’s face.
Tony doesn’t realize he whispers the name until Nebula relaxes marginally next to him as he slumps down, the black dots seeping into the forefront of his vision. Her strong hands are gripping his shoulder, fingers digging in painfully, but all Tony can focus on is
Now Tony has a lot of things in his life that he regrets doing, starting with ever thinking he could live up to Howard's expectations to writing the very letters that led up to him giving Steve Rogers his first kiss, just so he can avoid talking to his best friend. If mess isn't his middle name by now, he doesn't know what is.
Tony sighs, realizing despite kissing Steve, he hasn't said anything in answer. They need to work more on communication; not talking to each other was what put them in this mess in the first place. They need to do better. They need to communicate more because he realizes enough to know it's both sides messing this up. They were both dumb enough to make assumptions of each other without putting to voice the words of what they meant to each other. The whole mess is as much Steve's fault as it is his own, and he promises silently to himself that he's going to do better, they're both going to do better, because this is too important to fuck up again.
. “My clone wrote it? I was framed? I was hacked?” The eyebrow climbs ever higher into Steve's hairline with each ridiculous thing Tony says as Steve patiently waits for him to get it all out of his system.
The sentiment is nice, he supposes, but Peggy doesn’t even know the half of it with Howard. She has no idea how far his demands stretch and how far his hold reaches, claws sunk deep beneath his skin from day one and he’ll never be free. She might know a thing or two about tough parents, but Howard is a whole other animal.
“I’m fine,” he repeats, plastering a press smile on his lips as he shoves his phone into his back pocket. “Peachy, honky dory, and just swell.”
“Yes I fucking do,” Tony snarls. He steels himself for the killing blow. “It was nice being fuck buddies with you, but it never meant anything.”
“You're so dumb, you know that?” she says, and he wholeheartedly agrees.
Steve makes a sound like he's choking on a laugh. “Not my finest moment, sorry. But I meant it then too. It just slipped out at the time because I couldn’t help myself—God, Tony do you even know what you do to me? I can spend my whole life trying to draw and paint you like that morning, haloed by sunlight in our room, wearing nothing but the sheets and the marks I left on you.”
, “Just breathe. Gosh, Tony I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you so badly. I thought you heard me calling your name. Jesus, I’m so sorry. Breathe. Just breathe.”
Not his then. The new revelation cuts deep anyways, even as he’s flooded with relief that he hasn’t missed out on the first years of his own child’s life. He can’t exactly blame Pepper for moving on when he’s been gone for so long. She had thought he died in space, after she begged him not to go.
Tony looks around the room, following where Bruce’s gaze went. He stares at the new tech he’s never seen before, the gleam and glow of machines he doesn’t know the functions for. The window outside shows the grey sky, old and new all at once, the skyline in the distance that was once as familiar as the back of his hand now looks like a crumbling line of jagged broken teeth, a stranger he’s never met. His eyes land on the chart at the foot of the bed and the date marked at the top makes his blood freeze cold in his veins.
That will never not take Tony's breath away, to see his claim on Steve’s skin in red and black and gold and unfading permanence. Steve is beautiful like this, pale skin colored with Tony’s mark, and Tony is reminded again of the surprise and flare of dark obsession he’d felt when he first saw Steve’s tattoos for him. His fingers find their way along the ladder of Steve’s ribs and further up to ghost the edge of his nail against a pierced nipple and Tony shivers together with Steve as they close the space between them.
don't even love me.
young thing? Well, which is it?”
Outside the enormous windows of the Fifth Avenue townhouse, snow slowly drifts down from steel grey skies, fluttering onto the concrete grey below. Inside, the kitchen is warm with laughter and sugar and flour.
? You can’t even lie to your old man on his big day? I’m disowning you and writing you out of my will. Peter is going to inherit your share.”
Steve's other friends had the common decency to not make any other comments on his new relationship and Barnes had ignored him for the rest of the day. Tony was perfectly fine with that. The other team members were friendly enough and he knew Thor by proxy of his stepbrother Loki.
Tony finally, and very reluctantly turns. Steve is there standing behind him with a determined set to his jaw, holding that damned letter. Tony wants to reach out and grab it from his hand and burn it but it's far too late for that.
Steve laughs and steps back. Tony immediately wants to reach up again and draw him in again but Steve is already moving away to his side of the closet. Tony watches the long strides as Steve walks up to his rack of tuxes, carefully pulling a black velvet number off the hanger before going to the other end of the room with his jacket in one hand and shoes in the other. Tony eyes the red bottoms hanging off his finger with no small amount of happiness. Steve has come a long way from ill fitting suits off the sale rack and brandless dress shoes to bespoke Faragamo and Louboutin. Tony is very proud of him.
“I'm not a very good dancer,” Tony warns him.
have this.
“Is that lipgloss?” Steve asks suddenly, his eyes lingering on Tony’s lips.
There's talk of a party at Thor's house as the stadium slowly empties, where there's an abundance of expensive alcohol and a distinct lack of caring parents.
“We are going to set some boundaries,” Tony says the next day.
Tony thinks nothing more of the matter and forcibly pushes it from his mind. Not his business, he reminds himself.
Tony stays carefully still as his daughter uncaps the tube of strawberry flavored lip gloss in her hand and meticulously dabs the applicator at his mouth, mindful to keep the color within the lines of his lips. The gloss is sticky and tacky on his mouth and Tony can feel it smearing on the side of his cheek a little, but he makes no move to wipe any of it away.
“Bullshit! Is it the soda? We could’ve gotten her sodas if she wanted but she’s never let my friends and me out of the school gates during lunch, no matter what we offered her,” Tony says.
Steve gently cups Tony’s jaw and draws him in for a real kiss, slow and lingering until it grows heated and Tony opens beautifully beneath his lips. Steve can feel his chest tightening and his core warming when he has Tony pliant and soft in his arms like this, and he deepens the kiss with tongue and teeth until Tony tries to turn in his arms to face him.
“Did Pepper get one?” Steve asks, and here his tone sounds off. Strained.
A second sound, one that instantly sets him on edge and immediately silences their laughter comes comes from the cover of trees to their left. Footsteps crashing through the brush.
Jarvis sits next to him and doesn't say anything for a long time. Tony is grateful for the silence. He thinks if he opens his mouth to say anything, he might start sobbing and never stop. He doesn't know if he's ever hurt so much before. The pain is excruciating and firebright in his chest and nothing will alleviate it.
“Janet van Dyne,” Tony says.
“Fucking dead is what you'll be soon,” Loki replies, merciless, yanking hard at his arms. “We're going to be late for the game. The only seats left are probably the highest sections now, and it's all your fault.”
“Um, yeah,” Tony replies. “How is he even real? Maybe he’s a robot or something programmed to infiltrate humanity or like maybe he’s some kind of experiment on how to be the perfect romantic partner—”
"I feel like I could eat the world raw.”
Tony can barely breathe for the emotion clogging his chest and throat as Steve takes him apart. He doesn't think he's ever loved anyone so much, or ever will love anyone this much again. And that's the kicker, isn't it, to fall in love with someone he can't have like Steve Rogers not only once, but

came out) and finished it around March, but I didn’t feel confident enough in what I had to post it.
“Gorgeous,” Steve murmurs, his own voice sounding breathless. His desire for his husband will never not overwhelm him, regardless of what Tony looks like, and Tony is always beautiful. Steve doesn’t think it’s much of a hardship to spend the rest of their lives reminding Tony of that.
“Tony—”
Steve smiles, and pulls him in.
Steve wants nothing more than to cradle Tony within his embrace and protect him forever, shield him from the horrors of the world they know and the evils that seek to tear them apart. As much as his husband would object to that, it’s in Steve’s nature to want to protect the ones he loves with a single minded ferocity that applies to little else.
“How’re you enjoying the wildlife?” Bucky asks, grinning wide as his eyes track the bruises and marks decorating Tony’s throat and chest. The lowest ones taper down beneath the band of his swim trunks, and Tony smirks as he turns, a sarcastic pirouette to show off the marks above the dip of his waist.
“Tony,” Steve murmurs breathlessly against his husband's lips with a shuddering moan.
Peter had laughed as he took their photo, even as Tony griped, “wow, that was lame, Rogers,” because that was the best comeback he could manage at the time, secretly loving the dumb clichés Steve liked to use. They had smiled goofily at one another and there was warmth swelling in Tony’s chest until he thought he was going to burst with the affection he had felt for Steve in that moment. He had barely managed to turn back in time for Peter to catch his smile for the camera as Steve nosed a kiss against his jaw.
Jarvis already has a plate stacked high with the cookies he baked that morning waiting for him. He's smiling softly at Tony from where he sits at the counter, sipping his tea.
“You're not old,” Tony protests.
After the weekend, rumors start traveling through the school like wildfire, not that Tony has been paying attention in particular. He still hears about it because that's all anyone would talk about for all of Monday.
He’s grateful to Loki and Pepper for keeping the football team away. He sees Loki bodily shoving Thor away in the halls and he gives Loki a weak smile as he hurries past, Happy on speed dial. It’s only fourth period but he can’t do it, he can’t make it through the day, he has to go home. He turns off his phone.
“He left you a note,” Jarvis says.
“Tony…” Steve sounds exasperated.
Tony hums. “Yeah,” he says, and turns over to reach up for Steve, trying to pull him back in. But Steve, the bastard, laughs again and leans away.
day?” he tries sheepishly, digging into the bag to find a chicken parm, still warm and wrapped in foil.
Tony pauses with one foot in the door to look back at her silhouetted against the snow and dim moonlight. Her dark hair is a stark contrast to the white of the landscape, black shawl wrapped tight around her shoulders and fluttering in the light wind. The plume of smoke from her lips makes her look ethereal, a wraith in the winter night. She really is very beautiful, he thinks, especially when she smiles so softly.
“Not beautiful. Captain America is a liar,” Tony breathes against Steve’s lips.
A growl would be the only way to describe the noise that comes out of Steve as he pounces, claiming his lips with a harsh kiss. Tony arches shamelessly up to meet him in a wet desperate press of lips. Steve carefully stretches him open again as they kiss, his fingers moving in slow thrusts that brush the exact spot that has Tony seeing starbursts behind his eyes. It's ridiculous how quickly and easily Steve learned every sensitive part of his body and all the right touches to make Tony electrified with pleasure.
who kneels down in front of Tony and reaches out with shaking hands as though to touch before he hastily withdraws, remembering he no longer has that privilege when Tony flinches. Tony doesn’t pay any attention to that when there’s the low cautious hope burning in his chest that if
Part of him wonders if this is all an elaborate joke, one last stab while he’s down. But a look at Steve’s face tells him everything, the open honesty and the wild desperation in his eyes. Tony thinks of what Rhodey told him.
Tony has never cooked before. He had often baked with Jarvis and Ana when he was little, but he hasn't made anything more complicated than a bowl of cereal in years. He hasn't had the time to learn to cook since his responsibilities at Stark Industries grew so he's not much help in the kitchen, but he enjoys watching Steve and his mom throw together a simple meal, notices the warm way they tease one another and realizes that's who Steve gets his sense of humor from.
They had chosen a terrible day to visit the museum. They had not had the foresight to realize weekends are extra crowded and the museum is overrun with children and their parents, all eager to run through the exhibits and exclaim over dinosaur bones and shiny rocks.
Tony is so eager to show his dad his creation, he runs into his father’s study the very night he finishes the final touches, the tiny bot cradled protectively in his arms. Here is the first bot Tony made, all by himself. It is his first taste of creation, and what a heady feeling it is, to make something that
“I’m good, I’m good,” Tony rasps, desperate and overheated and greedy. “I can take it. Steve,
“Now,” Pepper says, with steel in her tone that brooks no room for disagreement, “you're going to go home and sleep. This project can wait.” She holds up a hand when Tony starts to protest. “It can wait. You're no good to anyone if you collapse on top of your laptop. Get a good night's sleep and I'm sure a solution will come to you. It always does,” she says fondly.
. I broke that promise once, but I never will again. Today, I’m renewing that oath, and I’m promising you
Sometimes on the weekends, they take the train for fun. Tony doesn't like to admit it, but Steve brings a sense of magic to everything they do, even something as mundane as taking the subway. They've taken the train with no destination in mind before, going from one end of the D line to the other, which takes them from the very tip of Brooklyn to the edge of the Bronx. They do it for the simple pleasure of letting the swaybacked rocking of the train lull them into quiet conversation and they spend lazy weekend days riding all over the city, transferring to other lines on whim.
“Whatever you think you saw,” Steve tries, “was not what you think it was.”
Jarvis takes a sip of his tea and sighs. “You're going to have to explain, Anthony. I'm not quite understanding what you mean.”
,” Steve echoes in stuttering gasps, sounding ruined and wrecked and all
… Only mutually approved posts on social media… No kissing… Wow, this is a lot. Tony, how are we supposed to sell this relationship if we don’t even touch?”
He had been dreading coming back to school all summer, his anxiety skyrocketing after Rhodey left, but he’s eternally grateful he at least has Pepper and their small group of friends.
“Yeah okay,” Tony agrees, his eyelids already drooping. “Fine. You win this time.”
Tony can't quite help the smile that tugs at his lips, and he's sure he looks like an idiot as he all but traipses to his next class. It's so silly, to feel his heartbeat quicken simply because of a couple of words on a piece of notebook paper. Definitely spontaneous onset fever. That's the only possible explanation for his suddenly erratic heartbeat and the strange warmth building in his chest.
Almost every Friday of autumn going into winter is reserved for football, and Tony fucking hates it. He's not sure why anyone cares so much to watch a bunch of lugheads running around a field scurrying after a weirdly shaped ball, no matter how nice of a view their asses in spandex tights might be.
how it was going to end.”
“Give me a minute,” Steve laughs, equally breathless as he throws an arm over his eyes.
Peggy sighs softly. “I know a thing or two about demanding parents,” she says, smiling ruefully, not pretending she didn’t hear at least the tail end of his conversation with Howard. “I was originally from London,” she continues. “My mum is very firm about our grades regardless of how many times we moved.”
Rhodey stops in the doorway of his workshop, hesitating.
“Yes you are,” Steve agrees softly, sliding his fingers gently through Tony's hair. Tony leans back against his legs and tilts his head up for a kiss.
The class has just started learning letter writing and correspondence, and Tony hates it. He sees no reason to write letters that are meant to be sent through snail mail when there were texts and emails and instantaneous communication with modern shorthand and popular colloquialism. The idea of a physical letter on paper feels archaic and wasteful. What's the point of waiting so long for something when they can communicate at the speed of light?
Tony hesitates. “Me too,” he finally whispers. He finds that he means it, and in the space of the next breath, he forgives both Steve and Barnes. Understands them for who they are, and in the face of imminent death, what really is the point in holding such a grudge?
“I thought that was all I could have!” Steve says, his voice rising. “I've liked you for almost four years and I thought if this was all I could get, I would take it. I told myself I was going to be okay with whatever you were willing to give me. I thought it would be enough. And I thought I could just help you with whatever you needed and deal with my own side of things without pushing you. Because anything was better than the radio silence we had between us for the last few years! I was literally willing to have any little scrap of attention from you, and—look, I was a fucking idiot, okay? I thought maybe if I gave it enough time and tried my best, you might like me back—”
Tony sucks in a sharp breath. A child. Is it his? If it is, why hasn’t Pepper brought them around to see him? Does he have a kid he’s missed nearly four years of their life running around? His head is spinning as he croaks, “how old?”
“Little do they know,” Steve says wryly, “
. His hands scrabble for purchase along the wide breadth of Steve’s shoulders as he fucks Tony with his fingers, careful as always to stretch him enough to take his cock.
“In a bit,” Tony promises as he slides off of Steve’s lap to kneel at his feet. He looks up at Steve from beneath his lashes as he settles on his knees, knowing what that look does to his husband. Steve stares down at him with his lips slightly agape. There’s a wondrous look in his eyes as he slides gentle fingers back through Tony’s curls, a guiding undemanding touch. Tony starts to remove his glasses when the grip in his hair tightens slightly.
He hears Steve sigh. “Tony, please.”
Tony realizes what's happening. He's making himself an easy offering, and why shouldn't Steve have some fun while he's waiting to win back the person he truly wants, when Tony is so shamelessly eager? And just like that, the happiness dims a little in the short distance between his living room and the kitchen.
“Okay!” Tony interrupts loudly. “That's enough of the Let’s Embarrass Tony Hour. Who wants cookies? I want cookies. I love cookies. It's cookie time.” He hops up off the floor and runs for the kitchen before anyone can reply, the sound of their laughter trailing after him like merrily ringing bells.
Afterwards, he and Steve collapse on the sofa with rapid onset food coma. Tony can do little more than loll his head over the sofa back to blink blearily at Steve who looks just as dazed as he feels while old Christmas movies play ignored on the TV.
“You're going to learn one day to not just go along with everything he says,” Rhodey says wisely.
Natasha’s hand tenses against his for a second before she pulls it back. She’s silent for a long moment. “What if,” she says slowly, quietly, as though the words are being dragged from her, “I told you I know who sent them.”
“It's just going to get worse from here,” Tony mumbles. He feels cold all of a sudden, the warmth from his sandwich dissipating with his good mood. He didn't get the chance to grab his jacket before they left school and the autumn wind is ruffling through his hair, sending shivers across his shoulders. “They're ruthless when they find something new to latch onto and they won't let go until they've turned over every stone and ripped everything to shreds.”
