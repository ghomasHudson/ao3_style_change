Well, if they thought that their guns equalised the Iron Man they had another think coming just as soon as he'd separated them from the civilians.
Iron Man flipped him the bird and shot upwards. As he rose through the air the communicators relayed his friends' voices as they entered the lobby.
"It's hostile." Iron Man snatched up Captain America and lifted them both high into the air, as the ornithopter – or whatever else Tony had called it – glided towards the Manhattan shoreline while the helicopter spiralled down towards the surface of the Upper Bay.
And nothing was going to go wrong. Repulsor technology was Tony's own invention and, unlike the ARC reactor, had nothing of his father in it. Combining the two had originally produced the Iron Man armour, but since then he had done little else with the concept. Perhaps that was because he had always thought of the repulsors as military tech and was concentrating on clean technology as the main money-earner for the future.
He turned back to the artefact, only to be hit by a wave of dizziness. The strange glyphs swam before his eyes, forming and reforming into something close to sense.
"Or of my council, yes. But you also need to 'take a hard look', in your case, at your staff. The information that you were using vibranium came from somewhere."
Jean had raised herself on her elbows, which was more than Steve could do. "You are not Victor Von Doom," she said. "He's dead. He created you and others in his image and let you all believe you were the real Doom. But you aren't."
"No experimental data, obviously. But it takes about a minute for blood to circulate the human body."
Blackness fell over him. He could hear nothing, see nothing, even though he was still yelling at Pepper.
What's more, while Steve was still staring at this apparition Tony had retrieved the bottle with what sounded like muttered thanks – and had he called that thing 'Dummy'? – and was concentrating on filling his glass, the neck of the bottle jittering on the edge of the glass as his hands shook.
Tony nodded. "Do you know magic Kung Fu?" he asked, with as much seriousness as he could manage. "Captain Rogers has a history of violence. He'll be looking to complete his mission but he can't do that, because I have everything he needs for it. Point that out to him, if you have to. But dodge. Please."
It was still night as they came in to land, somewhere, Tony estimated, near the equator in eastern Africa, perhaps not all that far from the Indian Ocean. No lights were visible through the windows except the white and yellow dots marking a single runway. The lighting was sophisticated but, despite the surprising length of the runway, the airport wasn't large, to judge by the lack of taxi area lighting.
The reactor was glowing steadily now, and the suit's eye-slits were bright with power. Steve wished he could see Tony's eyes behind them, to judge if he was telling the complete truth.
He wondered if the man he was not – the man who had a real claim on the name 'Steve Rogers' as well as Captain America – really had been that stupidly patriotic. He hoped not. There could no doubt that he was wearing that man's body, but their minds – his mind – were not the same.
Rhodey winced. "I hope not," he said, then added, "Probably. What does Fury want from you, Tony? Apart from a new helicarrier?"
She was tall and lithe, her hair trimmed into a practical fuzz and she wore loose cotton pants and shirt, both contrasting strongly with the heavy gold necklaces that protected her throat and upper chest. Her stance was easily recognisable as that he had been taught in the classes on martial arts, in perfect balance. Whatever she was, 'warrior' had to be part of it. Hatut Zeraze? But T'Challa was relaxed on his seat.
And, in a moment of shock and weakness, he had asked Tony to stay with him tonight, putting that friendship at risk. The other man had agreed so readily he could have no idea of the hidden urges that prompted it.
"And you don't think it's kosher. Well, I'd have doubts if Fury told me my own name, so I'm with you all the way on that. Apart from a general disinclination to trust Mr Number One Spy, why do you think there's something fishy about this data? Not that mistrusting Fury isn't reason enough."
He forced his eyes open in time to see a Wakandan warrior remove the-watch-that-could-summon the- armour from Tony's wrist and pass it to the White Wolf, who examined it in a way that suggested to Steve that he knew exactly what he was holding.
"However, we are now here to extend an invitation to you to travel to Wakanda for negotiations concerning the supply of vibranium."
"I don't know. From here that cloud looks more in Nassau County than to Queens, maybe. Bruce left a couple of hours ago. Said he was going over to Culver University, wherever that is."
"I suppose. It was a wild couple of years. I made friends, but they were mainly with other people in the superhero game, or spies, or mutants, or mad scientists. Then Dad came back and there was an alien invasion. All of Team Iron Man's identities were outed. It had been hard enough pretending to be an adult – now I had to be one and really, really adult at that."
"You," Hennis growled, nodding towards the elevator control panel, which had less than half a dozen levels marked: the garage, the lobby, the executive suite, the research centre, and the penthouse. "Take us up top."
Tony's stomach was churning as he watched the limo come slowly down the ramp into the Tower's private garage. He had not spoken to Pepper since their break up, but he wasn't able – or, indeed, did not want – to avoid the scheduled Stark Industries Board meeting.
"We intended to speak to you at tonight's gala," Ndungu added. "When we could not locate you, the delightful Ms Virginia Potts told us you would be here tonight, so we sought you here – and are grateful that you agreed to see us."
Jean, also freed from the spell, rose vertically into the air, her hair lifting around her in a cloud of fire as she flung out a hand and invisible force tore the metal mask from the Doombot's face, revealing another, more human mask beneath, then peeled that away so that a humming mixture of wires and pulsing flesh was exposed.
Howard was pointing out major features – they were apparently on something called Long Island, which seemed appropriate as he couldn't see either end, and the city was New York – the name sounded vaguely familiar but there was nothing attached to it in his memory – when Iron Man appeared below them, soaring up into sky in a great curve over the wide iron-grey Sound, with a second figure, purple and silver instead of red and gold, at his flank.
As it was, once he had sent the armour back to its storage niche, he had to catch his breath before checking that all the guests had left, then initiating the house's security, specifically barring anyone even remotely connected with SHIELD from entering – except for his father, but there he had every intention of getting his story in first.
"Are you blaming SHIELD again?" Pepper's hold on her temper seemed to be slipping, but Tony wasn't going to be intimidated.
It was a relief to shed the armour and change into a clean tee and jeans, but there was no ignoring the realisation that this was no longer home. But Stark Tower hadn't felt like home, either, without Pepper and Steve.
Their lips met in a kiss that was full of need. Then there was nothing but Tony in the entire universe, nothing but Tony and the need for union with him. Tony kissed back just as ferociously, one hand still clasping Steve's, the other raking into his hair. Steve was no longer aware of where they were, just of touch and scent and Tony gasping his name.
"I got a call from Deputy Director Hill. She said you weren't answering your cell. And General Fury wants to see yo— us. Now."
"Yes. Some time ago. He isn't like Tony. Being a hero isn't a necessity for him – just taking care of me. He thinks I'm wonderful."
And he hadn't had time to sulk properly in the workshop before Mrs Arbogast had called with the news the SI jet Pepper had been using had developed an engine fault and had had to return to O'Hare before it was twenty minutes into its flight to a meeting with EU finance ministers in a castle somewhere in the Bavarian alps.
"Troop carriers," Tony said. "You know, Colonel, you're the first person who has bothered to ask for my help and you've put forward a decent idea of your own. Once I figure out the detail and get it built, you'll be the first to know."
"Probably, but we seem to have lucked out with the quality press and the tabloids." Bruce squatted down besides Tony and began absently to fiddle with the electronics. "There was... er... a much bigger story."
"He broods if he's left to his own devices," Tony said crisply. "He's also got a nasty case of PTSD, though that's hardly surprising. Jarvis and I are keeping an eye on it."
Before he had a chance to respond, those doors, behind which should have been only an open shaft, the car long gone, doors which should have been sealed and the shaft inaccessible, with Jarvis in control, opened.
Jan put a hand on Steve's arm. "Steady, Steve. Tony is surprisingly difficult to kill. He went missing in Afghanistan for three months."
Fuck it, he'd hated the CEO job, and Pep was welcome to it. He could be Chairman, and research engineer, and superhero (and liking two out of three wasn't that bad) and do all those jobs better than anyone.
Tony was looking... stunned? "Christ, Steve. That's... Look, you think I don't— I know exactly what it's like to lose you, and that's been the worst... It's been worse than being tortured in a cave in Afghanistan, worse than dying of lithium poisoning, worse than falling through space, worse than finding out Pepper had betrayed me, worse than anything. If you care about me at all, Steve, you won't put me through this again. Please."
"I'd rather I had you to myself too," Steve said, "but I guess that's the price we pay for being Avengers."
"What the hell?" he shouted, though Jarvis and no doubt Steve would hear him even if he whispered. "That fucking thing was dead, as in doornail, not breathing, going
"Indeed it is." Without waiting Tony's order, Jarvis opened the doors to the elevator. "Mr Stark is waiting for you."
Steve wasn't sure what to make of that, but Tony was never bothered by the lack of a reply. "This is one of your 'bombs'," he said, lifting the lid of the case to show one of the spheres from the ornithopter cradled in packing.
"Just exploring the possibilities," his father said placatingly. "Tony, why are you so defensive about this man?"
All the same, Steve wiped the controller clean of his fingerprints – just in case – then heaved the unconscious body of its nominal owner into a sitting position, propped it against his own knee, and used its right hand to manipulate the controls.
Tony laughed, then sobered. "Pepper is... has been... necessary. I can't put it any other way. She's been my right hand for over ten years. I can't imagine life without her. But that's not why I came out here. I gotta talk to someone, Steve, an' you're the only person I can trust not to laugh in my face."
Tony sighed, and washed the capsules down, draining the glass, which he retained as he wandered off towards the storage area.
"Ah." Bruce's lady, Betty Ross, worked at Culver. "Don't you find it suspicious that suddenly you're the only Avenger available and then Fury calls
"Put it down." Tony slammed his arm across both of Pepper's, using his Extremis enhanced strength to knock them down onto the bench top, sending the device rolling from her hands.
Steve held back his retort. Tony had earned the right to that crack. "Nothing to see up here," he said. "Give me a lift down?"
Steve grinned to himself, and hurled the stone, not at the group of men surrounding Okoye, but at the one who was still watching the tunnel. Even before it struck home, he was leaping from the top of the shipping container to land right in the centre of the group of mercenaries.
Jan gave one of her characteristic snorts. "Honey, he wouldn't have been able to stop talking about it."
He looked down at the sketchbook and winced. While his mind had been wandering, the cityscape he'd laid out on the pad had acquired a series of doodles, almost all recognisable as Tony Stark.
The utility belt also contained ammunition, some sort of candy bars, a first aid kit and currency. And a wallet that contained official identification – the usual declaration of identity signed by someone whose name appeared to start with an F and end with a Y without much of a middle – and a metal badge, yellow and enamelled in black, a stylised eagle holding a shield, with vertical red and white stripes, identical to the one he had torn from the tunic.
"No!" Tony interrupted him. "There's some sort of toxic gas on the fourth and probably everywhere by now. And a body in the lobby. Possibly one of yours."
"Maybe, but I'm right. If you're going to act like this you'll be barred from the armoury unless I'm here."
"Shrinks." Tony couldn't keep the disgust out of his voice. Pepper had kept trying to get him to see an analyst, but he wasn't about to waste his time with someone nowhere near as intelligent as he was. "Hadn't that still-in-the-forties shtick taught them anything? Anyhow, you lost Steve with that ploy. But I want to know Peggy Carter's true status; deceased, insane, senile, brain dead, taken over by aliens, whatever. And evidence that I can believe and, more importantly, that Steve can trust."
"He isn't here," Tony said quickly, remembering that Jarvis knew of his decision to keep Steve's death a secret, but reminding him all the same.
Behind them, someone uttered an explosive word in a language Steve didn't know. He glanced back through the hatchway into the cabin to see Shuri running towards the tail, Betty following at her heels.
"I'm working on it..." There was silence for a while as Steve dismissed report after report. Lights were going out and changing colour on the map in patterns that he hoped would, eventually, be significant.
Neither of them said anything. Steve was breathing harshly, his face turned away from Tony, whose heart was thundering in panic behind the ARC reactor.
"And where did you hear about that? No, Steve, not precisely. But close enough, I guess. I need to be sure of my own control, in case it happens again. I can't afford that weakness. But you were never meant to see that, Steve. No one was. And SHIELD couldn't tell you about it because I never told them, never told anyone the details."
The plane had landed and was taxiing across the bumpy tarmac towards the boarded-up terminal when, Steve, peering out of the window with a look of nostalgia on his face, announced that, "Looks like there's a welcoming committee."
Tony sighed. "Reasons. It's not automatic. If I'd been there he would have been, and Steve and Jan could have done it at any time via satellite communications. Jarvis didn't suggest it because he was monitoring them through that link. When that went down, it was too late. Jarvis lost them. So ultimately, my error."
He wasn't sure why he was so angry; Pepper still cared about him, even if she had found someone new. Okay. That was fine. So long as whoever-it-was made her happy, didn't hurt her, that was fine, it was, so long as it wasn't Steve...
He didn't want to kill, because no one – with the exception of one of the would-be kidnappers' own – had actually been hurt so far, and this was going to be difficult to explain to the police in any event, but he had to disarm and disable them quickly, or the other two would be gone with the woman, so he couldn't be particularly gentle.
Then, "Come on, let's untangle you," Tony said. "I tell you, Steve, I'm going to throw a big time fancy dress party, invite the press, and make you wear this outfit – why are you wearing a fucking sword, anyway?"
"—you just ignore me when I've come all the way from LA to see you, and you know how much I—" Tony saw the realisation hit her hard. "You did dump me!"
The Iron Man rose upwards, so they could see the whole of the base below them. At the centre of the chaos was a giant hole, its depth masked by the blown smoke, but the size and shape could not be disguised; long and narrow, wider at one end than the other, the hole approximated the outline of one of the great Chitauri war engines.
Unable to bear that desolate voice, Tony slid an arm round him, and, instantly, Steve turned in towards him, burying his face in Tony's shoulder.
It hit exactly where he had aimed, exploding at the base of a massive tree. The flash and bang was followed immediately by both the screeches of fleeing monkeys and the creak of straining wood, then the thunderous crash of the tree falling. Before the first shock waves hit their vehicle, Steve had thrown three more arrows.
Tony took as deep a breath as he could, told himself to put his trust in Steve, and hurled himself through. Heat and light and noise hit him like a wall. He staggered, but strong hands caught him and hauled him upright, then into the shadow of the building they had just exited.
Tony said to Steve, with utter certainty, "You are not the man who originally wore that body, but the only part of him that survived death is part of you, even if his memories aren't."
Transferring an arrow to his right hand he hurled it into the night, not at the attackers, but angled to the right.
"For pity's sake, do I have to make myself any damn clearer? Yes. I am sure. Yes, please fuck me. Yes— oh, Christ."
Meanwhile, Tony was greeting the gorgeous redhead with obvious delight. "Jean, it's great to see you."
"Sit." Thor had somehow teleported to stand next to Tony to place a hand on his shoulder without him noticing. Now that hand pressed down and Tony's already wobbly knees gave under the pressure, but there was a chair waiting for him.
"Hey! Hey!" Hank, who had been standing blinking sleepily, suddenly came awake. "Careful with those!" He hurried over to take care of his equipment himself, and Jan followed at his heels.
Tony shook his head. "Boy, I never thought you were delusional. What happened to that eidetic memory? I've lost count of how many times I've hurt you – you make me so angry, sometimes. I hurt you last night. Thor took me to task for it. Gently, but, yeah, he did."
"Yeah, she's a big city girl and she's more devoted to Stark Industries than she ever was to me. She's in love with business and power broking, and she may end up as, I don't know, Chair of the Fed or the IMF or the WTO. Anyway, the farm is now a research facility for me, and Bruce, when he comes back, and Jane Foster and Erik Selvig, when they're not in the field. There will be others, as well as Enhanced needing sanctuary and training. You could help us with that. That alien invasion that's coming will be worse than the Chitauri, worse than Ultron and Loki. That was Thor's message. And I wish the hell he'd come back because we're gonna need him. Just as we need you."
It was perhaps the only thing he could have said that would have given Tony pause. He said, "Steve's doin' okay."
"Sure. New battle suit. This way." Iron Man inclined his head towards the unlit depths of the hangar. "I need to get out of this tin can and shower. You coming—? I shouldn't have said that, should I?" he added, as Steve burst out laughing.
Tony snorted. "Oooh, boy. She must be really taken with you. Didn't you know that when she was my PA one of her jobs was to evict any wom— anyone who had outstayed their welcome?
"Watching the idiot box again, Rogers?" Tony retorted, feeling immeasurably cheered to know his partner was keeping watch, even from the other side of the continent.
On the way home he took a detour out over the coast, smashed each vial between his hands, and let them drop into the sea.
and ugly. I sent the nuke into it, and it exploded and, do you know the quote about, 'I am become Death, destroyer of worlds'? Because that's what the guy who set off the first nuke ever said. And I get to be Luke Skywalker – you must see those movies. Only instead of Darth Vader for a father I had Howard and I'm not sure which was worse, and you were the one frozen in carbonite anyway... And all I could think of was how beautiful it was out there, and how glad I was I'd seen it, and how if I hadn't been there it wouldn't have been the aliens or Loki who killed the most humans, but fucking SHIELD and its masters. That was worth dying for."
"Sir," Jarvis reported. "That wasn't lightning. It came from the top of the Tendring and Sons Telecommunications Tower, which is three hundred and nineteen yards east of us—"
He had just finished dressing when Tony called him into the sitting room. Imagining all sorts of disasters, he was through the door and to Tony's side in half a dozen strides.
"Velasco. Velasco. Oh, my God. Jarvis, where did he take that Chitauri troop carrier-thing? Please tell me it wasn't McGuire."
Behind the afterimages, Steve saw the helicopter thrown across the sky by the repulsors, saw the beam projector on its belly exposed, and the missile, accompanied by the glowing fireflies of the Jericho weapon, strike the projector.
It was infuriatingly sensible but he couldn't think of anything else to say right now. "Her resignation came about as a result of a – fuck it people, we broke up. My fault. I can't fix my personal relationship with Ms Potts but I don't see why the company should suffer because I'm an idiot with women."
Tony, meanwhile, was into the vehicle's front seat, assessing the controls. The vehicle was floating a couple of feet above the ground so whatever powered it was probably still running. The control yoke was like that of a conventional aircraft but, instead of a rudder bar under his feet, there were two pedals within reach of his left foot, and a short bar under his right.
Tony hadn't wanted him to see the telltale changes in his eyes that meant he was accessing machines with Extremis. But now he had the lead he wanted, and a whole lot of that promising information downloaded, he needed just a few more seconds...
"Thanos himself told us," Natasha said. "Before Thor killed him. He used the Stones to destroy themselves."
Through all this, Steve was the perfect tactical control, but Tony knew that was a mask, that he wanted, above all things, to be on the ground – or, in this case, the ocean.
Steve was breathing hard, seemingly unable to gather enough words to answer. Finally, it came. "I couldn't call Sharon – she'd told me she'd have to arrest me. Sam... vanished. I thought Nat might... I called her. She said she couldn't help. That she had no power to help, that she couldn't take the risk. She told me to come to you."
"I'll be fascinated to learn how you know all this, Stark. You gave the Air Force the means to acquire a leviathan. Did you give them one of those bombs too?
The armour took five minutes to arrive and by that time Tony was cursing Jarvis, Steve and Fury in equal proportions. Once it closed around him, however, and he was in the sky, he ordered Jarvis to locate Steve on the assumption that SHIELD was taking him to where Natasha and Clint had been lost.
The SUV he had seen from inside the gates was one of a pair, with a bright blue and yellow cab sandwiched between them. A dark haired woman Steve didn't recognise was putting up passive resistance against the two men in dark suits and sunglasses who were trying to load her into the further of the SUVs. A middle aged man, plainly the cab driver, stood beside his vehicle with his hands held high above his head, though the three men carrying some sort of vicious looking automatic carbines – or maybe SMGs, because the line between the two weapons seemed to have become blurred during the time he was in the ice – were not even covering him. Instead they were looking wildly about them, though their weapons remained still.
Steve smiled at him, "Thank you, Happy." The shield felt good in his hands, comforting and familiar. Equally familiar, though, was the prickle of awareness, of unease. Since the serum, that instinct for danger had seldom let him down.
"They didn't 'privatise world peace', alienate the US government – our best customers – humiliate Hammer Technology—"
"Well at least he's never minded her bossing him around," Tony said, but he was relieved all the same. Happy was a steadying influence in Pepper's life, far more so than he could ever be, and Happy deserved some good luck.
"Hmm." Bruce's expression was far too analytical. "Why not? He's legally vulnerable. All his documentation is ... faked?"
specialising in karate and kendo, and passing much of the practice he learned on to Tony and Happy. Their instructor in close combat, who had trained Marines, police and film stunt men, immediately recognised the moves that Steve had learned in a hurried week's training in England in 1942 (arranged by Peggy) as being Fairbairn-Sykes methods. His response had been, "Holy shit, you
He bounced up to them, ignoring that that was doing to his ribs. "Hey, you found him. Hi, Bruce, glad to see you've recovered from attack by Jan. Few people do, let me tell you. Did you break that window? I'm not sure the insurance covers attack by superhero. And finding a garage to fix it will be difficult enough..."
Pepper finally decided to take advantage of this sudden change in his habits. She cleared her throat. "Tony, Jarvis tells me that your diary is clear today except for the charity gala at the Met tonight—"
Whatever answer Cap might have given was lost in a dull crack that seemed both muffled and deafening. The penthouse shuddered. Tony's first thought as a long-term California resident was that it was an earthquake. But this was New York...
"We have to think it through, if we're going to protect him, whoever he is," Howard said. "Neither of us has qualifications in biology or medicine, but there are people who could help.
"Damn it, Tony!" Rhodes shouted. "Velasco and I persuaded the government to give you this one last chance to cooperate—"
Jan's eyes had narrowed. Suddenly, she looked like the scientist she undoubtedly was. "We don't know. It worked beautifully on this—" She waved a hand at the glittering object laid out on the floor. "—which was living, sort of, though silicon-based. But the results of testing on lab animals haven't been so good. Sometimes they shrink out of sight and we never see them again, sometimes they shrink and shoot back to their normal size – or, occasionally, larger – within seconds. What's really worrying is that the more intelligent the creature, the more likely something is to go wrong. Luckily, we don't have any primates, and I won't let Hank go looking for stray dogs."
The 'private dining room' was purposely small and plain, its French doors currently folded away, and a balcony looking over the hills towards the sea. The table was set for two, with spotless linen, silverware, and sparkling crystal, the chairs high backed and comfortable, and the paintings on the white walls included a Van Gogh landscape.
Tony hesitated, fighting the impulse to turn back, fling the contents of his arms aside, and fill them with Steve instead.
The Doombot clanked across to the fallen artefact, lifted it in its hands and unwrapped it. "This is a thing of great power," it said, its eyes turning to Tony. "It is unsuited to you. This belongs to Doom, who will use it to retrieve his family's souls."
The hammer reached the tower first, smashing through the steel and concrete. The missile followed in its path but, unlike Mjolnir, it never reached the other side.
Behind the scream of the aircraft's engines and the deceptive chugging of the rotor, Steve could hear another, more familiar noise.
"But the Soul Stone exists on Vormir right now," Natasha protested. "Clint has – will – take it to our future—"
Tony was beginning to believe that any Hatut Zeraze left had managed to escape Wakanda; which was just as well, as only his repulsor-based weapons were usable, the rest being out of ammo. If he couldn't find any more targets he might even have to return to the city or the research centre, and right now he just wanted to keep shooting things.
Jan put her fingers over his lips, stemming his words. She didn't even glance at the floating letters. "Also, because I have an advantage Pepper Potts doesn't – I was your go-between as a pre-teen. I didn't understand what was happening then, but I do now."
Steve could feel Tony's self-confidence, and his certainty that Steve would pick up and follow his lead. And he was going to—
He needed to get the full story out of Jan, who at least had the background scientific knowledge, if not in quantum physics, but that also would have to wait for several hours.
Once he had Rhodey settled on the sofa and had offered beer, which both Steve and Rhodey had refused, he poured himself the large whisky he was sure he was going to need and settled in a chair strategically facing him. Lori, beer in hand, watched with amusement from her perch on the edge of the armchair.
Tony blinked at him in surprise. "Never seemed like the right time," he admitted, a little wistfully.
"Yeah. Lucrative an' still open. But it ain't popular. Not when it means going up against Captain America and Iron Man. Be even less when the trade finds out you've added Hawkeye and the Black Widow. But this is wasting time I haven't got. This wasn't a kill contract and it wasn't aimed at Stark."
The gun whined. Tony flung himself aside, but something invisible caught him in vibrations that threatened to shake him apart. The last thing he saw was Steve charging towards the self-styled White Wolf. Then the shaking threw him into the dark.
Shaking his head, Steve did the only decent thing he could do in these peculiar circumstances and followed the dance of light across the floor, until the doors of what appeared to be a private elevator opened to admit him. As he stepped inside and the doors slid silently shut, Steve thought to ask the question that he should have asked immediately: "Why call me? Miss Potts—"
Since when had Jarvis started calling Steve 'Steve'? As far as Tony knew he'd never done that with any other human.
"You have not seen what I have seen. Why do you think I needed T'Challa not only biddable but deprived of his ability to speak to the Panther God?" Hunter asked. He drove the point of the syringe into his arm. "How long before it takes effect?"
"Loki." Selvig said it with deep hatred. "Both he and the Tesseract are better off Earth." He frowned. "So would— Did Thor take Loki's staff with them too?"
A shock of pleasure, of desire, ran through his nerves, his stomach, his veins all cumulating in his groin. His hand wound into Tony's, and Tony gripped back, fierce and desperate, pulling him up onto the jetty.
Tony sighed in relief, though he kept it off the suit speakers. There was one more thing, something that Hill was unlikely to find important in the chaos of this evening, but something that had unexpectedly haunted him since the helicarrier fell.
Tony had almost dropped the ball once on this one and he wasn't about to make that mistake again. "Phil's duty meant a great deal to him," he returned, voice and expression as bland as he could make them. "He saw what – and who – was needed to get the job done." For the first time he looked at the man beside him with suspicion. He had no evidence that this man was who he said he was, but even if he was legit...
Tony was dozing when he heard the sound of the machinery that lowered the ramps to the tunnel that led to the ruined barn outside the valley. It galvanised him into rolling out of bed and struggling into his pants, before hurrying to the storeroom just in time to see the SUV, its front passenger window missing, come barrelling up the ramp and brake abruptly. The doors opened, and Steve, Hank, Jan... and oh, thank Christ, that was Bruce, full sized and plainly unharmed... got out.
Before him, there was nothing but sky. Desperately, he grabbed for a handhold. As the metal deck tipped at an angle that was rapidly approaching vertical he saw the lights of a city far away and the dark of water rushing towards him, a hundred, eighty, sixty feet below.
Furious, Tony retreated to his own workshop, only to be totally frustrated by the SI research department, the results of the latest computer runs, and his own failure to find anything to interest him.
"Hi." Tony slid an arm round Steve's shoulders and leaned against him so that he shared his view of the displays; there was a map of the North American continent overhead, covered in tiny coloured lights, and, surrounding it, satellite views of unidentifiable forest and desert and mountains, Facebook pages, rows of tweets, muddy videos, blurred photographs, and messily designed digital newspages.
Tony's anger was surging, so hard that he knew he wasn't able to contain it for long. "You think there'll be anything left of it?" he snarled. "Still hoping to harvest the super-soldier serum, Nick? Didn't you get enough from your zombie corpse?"
Tony threw a glance to where Steve was blocking the entrance to the kitchen and relaxed a little when he shook his head.
"Fine, fine," Tony said, trying to scramble to his feet even as Howard grasped his arms to support him. "Just a tumble."
Tony shook his head. "Must have been earlier, I guess. Maybe an hour or so." He brightened. "Which suggests I may be imagining a connection after all."
Tony grinned and took a sip of the excellent Bourbon. "He would probably have tasered me, but the Avengers owe him. Not that we were close, but the two Avengers who knew him better than anyone and the one he was trying to save can't be here, so I guess I'm it – the team rep, whatever. Are you family?"
Something rose in the shadows and padded into the light. For an instant, Tony thought it was another dog, even larger than the others, but the firelight gleamed red on white, not black.
He was lying on his front, propped up on pillows so he could breathe normally – but pain ripped across his back with every breath.
Sif pulled the grey's reins over its head, and then looked down at Thor. "Are you sure you do not want me to accompany you?"
"No," Tony said. "But I may have encountered them... it... whatever. I may even have been both interrogated and hacked by them. Jarvis!"
With breathtaking suddenness, Mjolnir shot from where it was lying at Steve's side, dragging him by the loop through his belt towards the nearest wall. Tony and Natasha, as one, threw themselves after him as the Ancient One raised her hands and shouted words that neither of them understood, even before the sounds themselves began to lengthen and deepen, as if a recording was slowing almost to a stop. The hammer speed faltered along with the Ancient One's words though it remained airborne – and so did Steve. That enabled Tony to reach for Steve's belt and pull it away from his body, so Natasha, who had produced a knife from somewhere – had Tony imagined her into existence with hidden knives or had she done that herself? – slashed through the leather.
Steve shifted restlessly in a seat that had somehow reclined into a real – if slightly narrow – bed. He couldn't complain that it wasn't comfortable because it was, like nearly everything associated with Tony, luxurious.
Asgard? How could he be in Asgard? The last place he remembered being was Wakanda and that kingdom, strange as it might be, was very much of Earth. Tony had been there. They – White Wolf – had been going to kill Tony. He'd stopped that, at least temporarily, by taking the drug meant for Tony – he'd been dying, had known it...
Tony groaned, and laid the tablet aside. "That's what Gene – the guy who sent it to me – thought. He was wrong. Not for the first time, either."
"I've killed assassins before." The man's hands, large and calloused, spread wide. "But everyone's in debt to you right now, including me. That makes me twitchy. So I'm out to pay off as much debt as possible."
There was nothing Steve could say to that; what he could do was kiss Tony with all the tenderness he could summon.
Tony lay back, turned his head into the pillow and closed his eyes. He had a lot to think about on the long ride into Manhattan.
And it shattered the remains of Tony's resistance. "No! That's... that's ridiculous. You know something? I'm sick of being sensible." Tony held out a hand. "Just remember that if I do anything that hurts you or that you don't enjoy, you tell me then and there."
"I tried," Velasco said, with a wry grimace. "But since they backed the wrong horse with Hammer they're smarting so much they don't want anything to do with Stark Industries, even just paying for patent rights. And there's stuff that ain't in the patents. Isn't there?"
"'That big ugly building in New York'," Tony quoted, with a chuckle. "You do know that most New Yorkers think it's an improvement on the original."
"Anything else?" Natasha asked, with a raised eyebrow. "Fury's phone number? Everyone's security passwords? The helicarrier overrides?"
Rumour had it that Janet Van Dyne, who had inherited a fortune when she was a couple of years older than Tony, was dating Dr Henry Pym and had taken him firmly in hand.
"Oh, I'll think of something," Tony assured him, and Steve could hear the amusement in his voice. "But, y'know, red-white-and-blue, there are still the security cameras. We could just have gotten here too late."
His own emotions, though... was the only reason they were more intense that Tony had become his emotional lifeline in this strange cold world of the future?
Steve was still watching him closely. "I think you need a long soak in a hot tub," he said. "Jarvis, could you fill the bathtub, please."
But it was not because he was walking away from his friends, his rescuers. After all, he was leaving for their own good. And this was the same unexpected feeling he had had as they had driven to Xavier's, a compelling need to rush back to the house, a feeling that had eased as they drove back.
"I know. But it should have warned you that Barnes was a walking time bomb. Have you found him yet, by the way?" If there was one thing calculated to push Steve's buttons, it was Barnes. And Tony had no sympathy at all for Barnes or for Steve's... obsession... with him.
"It's nice up here, but I don't fancy making love in the open with all these insects about. There are comfortable beds back at the cabin," Steve added hopefully.
Always supposing Hank had bailed out at all. If not, then both he and Bruce had been transported to who-knew-where, but certainly into the midst of a technologically high-powered enemy.
!" Tony took a deep breath, still not sure why he was shouting at Steve but unable to stop himself, even now. "And you preferred that or falling to your death to waiting for reinforcements—"
"So would I, for the moment," Storm agreed. "Right now I don't have much trust in the Pentagon left."
It wasn't really a change of subject, and it irritated Tony more than it should have done. "We're getting along fine," he said sharply. "Bringing him up to speed on the modern world; man has a lot to catch up with."
"It's a straightforward pickup," Tony said. "They've got a lot of scientific equipment on their truck, as well as Foster's scientific team, my driver and Thor. That's why we need both aircraft. Steve and I are going as insurance."
Steering a careful course, T'Challa glanced continually between his charts and the automatic pilot. Then, without warning or sight of land, he shut down the engines. The view through the dome vanished, as if shutters had been dropped on all sides.
"It's... um.. structural. Keeps the roof from falling in on us if we crash. Stark Crash Pole... and you're not buying this are you?"
"Did what Dr Erskine told him," Tony said firmly. "Besides, you can own the serum, but not the men it might create. But the serum wasn't patented and if it had been the patent would have run out. And you couldn't claim a man recruited over seventy years ago was still in the army, though the Pentagon is trying. Which is hilarious because they don't even know if he's the same man, or, if he isn't, if the same serum was used on him."
"Sitting up in bed with his helmet on, cursing the fact Jan and I won't allow him to go charging off into the night contacting more ants. To be honest, I doubt most of the colonies would notice the shrunken Hulk unless he started ripping up their nests, but Hank thinks the Hulk must have left the valley, though how he'd do that, considering his current size..."
Suddenly able to move, Steve flung himself across the room and snatched at the Doombot's remaining hand, holding it still, his muscles straining against an enhanced strength that might exceed his own.
"Oh yes," Tony said grimly, but he was thinking how his experience had been very different from this man's – and Coulson's apparently.
It was a disturbing word, one it was difficult to reject because Sam seemed content to follow in his – in Captain America's – wake. Unlike Tony – and Thor, Bruce, Natasha and Clint, come to that.
Iron Man rose into the air. "Oh, and one more thing, Nick. Your informant at SI is about to go silent; you'll get nothing more from that source."
Leaning out, Steve grabbed the black clad man by the arms and hauled him inside as Tony spun the vehicle on its axis, sending the warriors flying.
After that, it would be a case of retrieving bodies. It was not an idea he would ever be comfortable with.
"Never heard of them," Tony responded, because he hadn't, and he thought he knew just about every acronym the military had come up with. Which was a lot.
"For you, perhaps," Steve replied. "We may need umpires. In which case, you have Natasha and I have Tony. Fair?"
Though Tony flew as high as he dared and poured on the power, the trip to the East Coast took more time than he probably had to spare. At least he was moving faster than the hurricane. This suit was three times as fast as the Mark III, in which he had confounded the Air Force on his way back from Afghanistan where he had exacted a most satisfying revenge on the Ten Rings.
Clint raised an eyebrow at Steve as he took a chair beside John Storm and opposite Natasha, and he was frowning as he looked from him to Tony and back again.
Steve opened his eyes in time to see Thor looking with narrowed eyes at an extraordinarily beautiful woman with rich dark gold hair caught in an elaborate style and threaded with pearls. Though her creamy skin was unlined, there was experience, wisdom and maturity in her expression. She seemed familiar, though Steve could not remember where he had seen her before – and surely he could never have forgotten her...
He could hear Steve chiding him that they needed a plan before action – and that to make a plan you needed intelligence.
"Oh, don't worry, Stark." It was the mercenary leader who spoke. "It wouldn't work on you. It's been tailored specially for the Black Panther here. I am assured by White Wolf that your fate will be quite different."
"That's my Watson, er – Jarvis. How close are the manufacturing bots to completing the repulsor powered transport modules?"
"According to Mr Stark, there was a battle with a woman who Prince Thor refers to as Karnilla, Queen of the Norns. She disabled the Iron Man suit, which was downed in the ocean. Mr Stark says he did not lose power completely, and the suit eventually returned to the surface, where Thor located it. Thor brought Mr Stark aboard the helicopter where Ms Romanoff replaced the arc reactor core with the spare you had suggested she take with her."
"Finished," Tony said, signing the final paper with a flourish. "I've made two amendments, here and here."
"Sit down, gentlemen," Xavier said, in his soft voice. "Steve, Tony briefed me on your problems. As he will have told you, I am a telepath – a 'mind reader' in the lay term of your era. In this instance, in order to help you I must probe far below your surface thoughts. I need to be sure that you consent to this. If you want back out now, I will not pressure you or take offense."
"The Panther god's temple is on that island and the nearer I am to him the more likely he is to listen to me. He can lift the magic that protects Wakanda, and allow your armour in."
Tony looked down at the glass in his hands. "If you hadn't said that... maybe I...  maybe I wouldn't have thought I had to prove you wrong. So as I hung onta that nuke I was thinking about you and the gang and New York and that I really hoped Hulk had pasted a good one on Loki and then JARVIS suggested I call Pep—"
"Well, I was only seven, man, and so were you. Made more of an impression on me. So once I'd figured it out I flew here as War Machine. I couldn't spot you from the air, so I left the armour in the woods and headed for the farm. But I, well..."
"Because I knew people would ask her and I didn't want her to have to lie to them," Tony said cheerfully. "What's so urgent, Rhodey? I'll be back in New York in a couple of weeks."
"Asgardian magic," Tony said, as he lifted Steve in his arms. "Thor must have called his hammer. Which, unfortunately, exists in two versions right now. The god of thunder and lightning is going to get a different kind of shock when a duplicate turns up." He chuckled. "Oh, I wish I could be there to see his face..."
"Why should you think that? They have insurance. Actually, I may buy the place. They wouldn't normally allow us back, but I have a fondness for the penthouse suites. Good memories," he added, with a theatrical leer.
that we had not, at least officially, supplied anyone with vibranium since the then king had arranged for a sample to land in the hands of your father early in the Second World War. But after the Battle of Manhattan, it seemed ... feasible ... that you had, indeed, gained access to it, not least because you had duplicated Captain America's shield."
By the time Tony emerged from stowing all three men below the walkway, Steve was in his underwear attempting to get into White Wolf's suit. He'd thought his Captain American uniform was tight, and the suit Tony had designed was no better, but White Wolf's was definitely going to pinch.
"Clint, do you really need to come in? If so, there's a place prepared for you. I've told you that. Steve's told you that."
Hennis shook his head. "You're lying, Mr Stark. You know that and I know that. If you continue to be obstructive I must insist on searching your penthouse and research facilities."
Tony woke slowly, in contentment, knowing, without memory, that all was well with his world. Despite a few aches, probably from – oh, yes, Steve hauling him out of a crashing car...
"I take it they don't teach history at MIT," Bruce said dryly, wandering over to peer at Tony's work.
For a few minutes, though it seemed far longer, it felt horribly awkward, with both men stiff and unmoving, trying not to touch. Then Tony said, "Okay. I guess neither of us is going to get any sleep like this," reached out and settled Steve's head against his shoulder, then wrapped his arms loosely around him.
That hurt, but Steve refused to let it show. God only knew, Tony had been betrayed by enough people over the last couple of years: it was no wonder he was wary of giving complete trust, even to his team, to his lover.
The music had changed to something soft, rhythmical. As they swayed softly in time to it, Steve could almost imagine they were dancing. Which would have been fine if it wasn't for the effect Tony's closeness was having on him.
The air screamed past his ears as he fell towards the ornithopter. Water and glass walls flashed in the sunlight to either side, glowed gold on the Iron Man armour swooping towards the plume of smoke from the downed helicopter, glittered on the wing struts that were so like bones...
"Steve?" Even as he spoke, reality came crashing in. He blinked Hank Pym into focus. "Hank." He sat up abruptly. "What's the word on T'Challa?"
White Wolf snapped a single word which stopped the warrior with his hand hovering over the light in Tony's chest. "You're awake. Interesting," he said, in English, and Steve wished desperately that he could see his face behind that mask, to judge his intent.
Tony took a deep breath to ask her how he was supposed to know when he had no idea what the time was now, when Bruce said, "About half an hour."
"Yeah. She's an old enemy of Thor's. Apparently Loki told everyone in Asgard that she was dead," Tony said, with only a quick, furtive glance at Steve. "I do worry about their judgement sometimes. Hubris. Or does that only affect Greeks?"
"Well, not so much, obviously," Tony said, his voice muffled by the contortions needed to don the suit while sitting in a car, "but it should be adequate for a guy in a cab."
They ate the pasta in near silence. Tony had arrived bearing a bottle of red wine and wearing, not the jeans and tee Steve had expected, but a formal suit that made Steve feel under-dressed in his chinos and wife-beater.
"Yeah," he said. "I've been in their hands, but those were thugs in a cave, not sophisticated, not scientists, so maybe this weather is natural..."
The reply, though, was from an immediately recognisable source. "So long as it does not breech any of the restrictions within my programming and protocols – the instructions I operate by – I am at your service, Captain," Jarvis said.
The air had the dry feel of air conditioning, which convinced Tony that the computers were somewhere close.
"Not sure," Steve said, jerking a thumb at one of the tunnels. "He says he's withdrawn to meditate before making any decisions. Though he'd be better off asleep. As would you."
"This." Marilyn pushed a small hard case, presumably containing a cell phone, across the desk. "She said the company had issued it to her, but she'd forgotten to hand it back. But she was also insistent that I give it only to you, personally, and that there was something on it you needed to see."
"Doom's dead," Tony said. He was finding that, like Jean, he could sort of reach into the Doombot's – and it was a Doombot – electronic systems but could not control its mind. Damn it, there were just too many organics.
"Pity. I'd expected him to be waiting on the roof." Even as he spoke, Tony knew he was pushing too hard, that Steve was either going to floor him or walk out, but he couldn't stop himself.
Pepper's eyes widened, just a fraction, but Steve felt certain that that was a danger sign. "Damn," she said, in a far too mild tone. "Damn. Why, Steve? They've been friends for... well, for over twenty years. I used to envy Jim Rhodes for being closer than— so close to Tony. He even stole Tony's tech – the so-called War Machine armour – and Tony let him get away w— forgave him." She paused, and then added, as though Steve hadn't figured this out, "As far as Tony's concerned there's no greater crime than taking his tech. So, what the hell did Jim do?"
"Let me know if that changes," Tony said, then, with trepidation, he dialled the number of Pepper's private cell and waited to see if she would pick up. She had spoken to Steve, but Steve hadn't dumped her.
"Yes. Which is why I've spent today making sure they won't be able to identify you even if they find you. And why Pepper has no idea you exist."
"Anyone who came from the Attorney General's office or the Department of Justice in general?" Natasha asked sharply.
Bruce and Tony exchanged glances, but it was Steve who replied; "They'd certainly be interested in it."
Three bars and two casinos later, he was half-listening to an inferior torch singer while waiting for the pole dancing to start when, from the corner of his eye he saw a fair-haired, tall, broad-shouldered young man in a blue silk open-necked shirt leaning with his back against the bar, disco lights playing across his face. For a split second, his heart stopped ... Steve... He caught his breath and turned, taking a step towards him, an instinctive smile lighting his face...
The door slid open at her touch, allowing them access to a large, windowless, blindingly white room.
"Of course," Tony said, "but right now we don't have a clue about where the teleportation portal took him."
Bruce looked from one man to the other, then smiled. "Since when did you two become a double act?" Then, at their identical wide-eyed innocent stares, he added, "So, it was the Other Guy. I'm sorry, Tony."
It was a pity he couldn't just release a missile and blow the tower to bits, but he wanted that tech – control of the weather, Christ, the lives he could save with that tech – so he would have to clean out the rats' nest by picking off the humans.
"There's nothing to suggest you're bisexual even on the most disgusting websites or the most libellous tabloids," Steve insisted. "Lots of scandal, but not that."
"It's Tony's private plane – and he's big into systems redundancy," Jan said, "so I'll bet it does. Come on, Betty, let's talk to Carol." She flew off, Betty following in her wake.
"I can't hear any of you." Steve was shouting, though he probably didn't realise it. "I hope to God that's just the racket. If you can hear me: the alien troops are exploding, whether they're dead or alive. Repeat: the enemy is self destructing."
Maybe coming here wasn't the right decision but the alternatives looked much less promising; even, in some cases, disastrous, not just for him, Natasha and Steve, but for the world... the timeline.
Tony sighed. "Yesterday was only the third time I'd seen her in the last year," he pointed out. "She's still one of my best friends but... we never had much more than that."
While annoyed at Jarvis's sudden and inexplicable silence in the latter stages of his journey, Steve followed the smell of chlorine and arrived on the terrace beside the swimming pool without mishap.
He leaned back against the door, feeling himself beginning to shake. He'd safeguarded StarkEnergy, made sure Pepper would be safe, and cut off the information flow to SHIELD at its source.
"I'm on the Tower helipad waiting for a SHIELD chopper. I've had a message from Fury. Apparently there's some sort of incident over in Queens. He's lost touch with Hawkeye and the Widow."
"Blast you, Fury, this is no time for your political games," another voice interrupted. "Velasco here, Stark. If there's a chance either of you can locate survivors, go for it."
Tony was surprised. "Do you know him? I've sold stuff to his company but only through his management and research staff."
Tony had found who or whatever was controlling the storm and stopped them or it; they were all sure of that, but no one claimed to know what had happened to him afterwards.
"Also, Whitney hasn't stopped talking since she woke up. She was hired by the Doombot, which she thought was Doom. It thought it was too, as most of them do. She also described the way Steve took her and the Doombot down. Fury came round demanding I hand Steve over to him. He searched the place – I escorted him personally into the armoury, but didn't let him take a closer look at the armour or the equipment. We'll have it fumigated before you come back.
Behind them walked half a dozen soldiers wearing the same battledress as those they had disposed of back at the research centre.
The minibombs were new. One would easily destroy the whole laboratory section. A minute later, it did just that, but by then Iron Man was gone.
Bruce fiddled with the pencil in his hands, his eyes on the computer screens, "Yeah. Well, how are you and Steve getting along now?"
Tony dropped quickly towards the ground, looking for the bright blue of Steve's uniform suit, and there it was, in the midst of a group of darker-clad SHIELD agents.
Steve felt the heat rise into his face, but he nodded, once, and if the car's driving line wavered at that point, it could just have been that Tony had taken his eyes from the road.
The Natasha from his time had gone straight to Vormir with Clint, and only he, Tony, Scott and Bruce had been here in New York.
"Jarvis, beach lights on. Open the door to the beach and send the elevator down, but hold it just above the lobby."
Yeah, well, Tony said to himself, hiding his smirk. T'Challa probably wasn't going to get the real thing back so easily.
He thrust for the surface, caught a breath, and dived; sculling in the direction the wave had carried him. After all, he had glimpsed lights in that direction.
Had Steve seen Classic Trek, Tony wondered, trying and failing to repress his grin. If not, he would have to educate him, so he would understand why he was now grinning from ear to ear. "See you in the Big Apple, Fury. Stark out. Jarvis! Arrange for my personal jet to be waiting at... let's see... nothing too close... Wichita will do. And make sure the suitcase armour is on board. Steve, can you get your gear together and the truck fully unloaded?"
Natasha had been examining Steve's head and shoulders where they hung on the back plate of the armour. "There's a hole in Steve's suit. It's very small, but there."
"Yeah. Only source is Wakanda and that wasn't even known until—" Tony stopped in mid flow, because Wakanda hadn't been revealed to the world until a few years ago and – vibranium? When had that been known, been given that name? Had it been when the shield had been forged? And had Cap ever been told what his shield was composed of? "Do you remember vibranium and Wakanda?" he asked cautiously.
"And you thought I was gonna sleep through that?" Tony managed a smile, though the thought of Pepper's incessant nervous chatter was enough to aggravate the headache.
"Satisfactory," Pepper said, hesitating a little so she was in step with Tony as they entered the Board Room.
Tony didn't seem to hear him. "When I was herding that nuke towards the portal and I was sure I was gonna die, I called Pepper on her cell and, whaddya know, there's reception in the stratosphere and even the mesosphere. Who knew? But Pepper was too busy watching you being heroic on the TV, being baddass and saving the world, so she didn't pick up. An' today she'd finally gotten around to checking her missed calls an' noticed when I'd called her, and that was fine. She cried on me a bit, then asked me why I didn't leave a message an' y'know I couldn't give her an answer. So I told her I was at a loss for words."
Though Steve was trying to ignore the sense of the words, he couldn't stop his lips twitching at that.
"Chaos," Tony said. "It's even possible the Presidential elections might have to be postponed – for the first time ever – except if the unaffected States didn't agree, which they wouldn't. Either way, there could be riots. Some reputations would be ruined. And one or both Presidential candidates might not have made it through the hurricane itself. Whether it killed them or not."
He was beginning to regret his precipitate decision to confront Wakanda on its own ground, but Steve's solid presence beside him was a comfort. That they were both unarmed bothered him, though, and he hated being out of touch with Jarvis even more.
"You're not a ghost!" she shouted, winding her arms round his neck and kissing him on both cheeks. "Damn it! Tony said you were dead."
Howard's next shot hit dead centre on the Big Green Riding Hood's chest, but it didn't even seem to stagger him.
"Oh, I cared," Tony said. "I still care, despite it all." He petted Steve's hair for a while, gathering his courage. "What did the Witch show you, Steve?" he asked at last. Then, when the other man remained silent. "She showed me all of you, dead and defeated – and your dying words were blaming me for not doing enough to save you, to save the world. I think that's why I seized the opportunity, that night at Barton's farm – because I might never have another chance at getting close to you. Natasha still won't tell me what Wanda showed her, though she might tell you or Bruce... Bruce. We know what happened when she got to Bruce. And Thor, that something was wrong in Asgard. And as we haven't seen him since he went back, I guess that's was true. So, Steve..."
His own arm, reaching for his best friend, seemed to stretch out to infinity and still not reach, still not touch him.
"I won't let the reporters eat me, Steve. In fact, I'll be home for dinner. Ciao. Jarvis, faceplate up." Tony removed his foot from the creature's foot – the only part of its body low enough to the ground for him to pose with any dignity – and faced the barrage of journalists. He could see at least ten camera teams. Momentarily, he wished heartily for Pepper...
"No to all three. There's a chance I may still be needed in Seattle and Thor tells me Steve has to rest." Jan would have his head when he got back to New York and he was all for putting that off for as long as possible. "I'll let you know when I have anything else, and how you can help. That's all, folks."
Desperately, Steve caught Tony's arm and pointed to where it had abandoned the artefact and, instead, was beside the coffee table, bending to pick up the black-stoned ring.
Meanwhile, SI's insurance premiums had skyrocketed, and Pepper, ringing from Toyota City (and how cool was that, and was there a Stark City anywhere in the States at which he could establish a company address for snail mail?) had spoken of getting a Lloyd's syndicate to take on the risk.
Tony winced, not sure which circumstance was more ominous. He said: "Don't disturb Hank. When Jan gets back or calls in, tell her Steve's alive and so am I. You don't need to tell her to call me because she will anyway."
"Well, you're the strategist. What would have been the result if Sandro had actually hit the mainland?"
"Bruce was concerned," Jan continued, "but said that you must have a reason for accepting that invitation and that it must be a good reason if Steve was letting you get away wi— Oh, Tony. I almost forgot. I'm so sorry."
"He's aware," Tony said. He turned back to Hennis. "Give them a minute and you'll have your answer. Meanwhile, I'm curious as to why you are here instead of the NYPD." The answer would be a lie, of course, but Tony needed to stall just a little as he worked through the ramifications of Hennis's claim.
"I agree," Okoye said. Then, "Perhaps we should—" Her voice was drowned in a great roar, the sound of an enormous cat that shook the ground under their feet and raised waves on the lake.
The new knowledge was exhilarating and, surprisingly, made it easier to make it through the bouts of hateful flash-memories.
"That my phone and bike were bugged, presumably by SHIELD. That we were followed from the Tower, but not all the way to my apartment."
"Not possible, Colonel." The man who answered was tall and wide-shouldered, but he wore his too-expensive black suit and designer sunglasses so unhappily that Steve knew he would be happier in any other clothes. Possibly jeans and a tee? Or maybe uniform? Battledress?
Jan, however, beat him to the punch. "Betty's on her own path to find Bruce. And she may find some answers to our questions on the way."
"If it is on computer or somewhere with paper records and public researchers I can commission, then yes, Captain."
"It would certainly be wise to warn Director Fury that we have the capability," T'Challa replied, his deep voice holding no hint of humour.
And Steve was suddenly afraid, that he would die and that the body he occupied would die, and Tony would be left alone. Or maybe it was that he'd give in to that temptation, become a thief as well as a murderer.
"Eleven years and two months." There was an odd note of disappointment in her voice as if he, too, should have kept an exact track of time.
"You're wrong," Tony said, with certainty. "Vision is already on the case. On Hydra's case too, as it happens. He's liaising with Fury and Sharon Carter, and Natasha and Wanda are working with him. They may not care about Barnes personally but they know how much he means to you, Steve, and they'll do everything they can to break him loose and save him. Promise me you won't interfere."
"I've pushed my authority beyond its limits," the Colonel said, "and I think MacTavish knows it. He won't want the responsibility of having Storm and the girl around – won't want to know anything about them. He'll let me carry that can. The prisoners are a different matter. He'll hold them as long as he can, officially at my request, unless you want to take some or all of them with us for interrogation?"
Steve shrugged. "Tell me about it. When I knew Howard he was much younger than Tony is now, and, on the surface, they were very alike. Below it," he shook his head. "I don't think I ever got below Howard's surface, but he came close to ruining my chances with Tony."
They were right behind her as they started down the steps, but Lieutenant Storm stopped so abruptly that Steve almost ran him down. "Wow! What the hell is that?"
Tony shrugged. "I'm not a lawyer, but unless anyone's record equals Perry Mason's, they don't stay on my team."
Unless Tony was putting on a show of indifference towards him in order to keep their... affair... secret.
He comforted himself with the hope of coffee, particularly if it was the wonderfully rich coffee grown in nearby Kenya or a local equivalent. As they crossed open ground and climbed the steps past guardian carvings of leaping leopards, he sniffed hopefully. There were many smells, mostly unfamiliar, and none of them suggested coffee, not even when they passed through the eaves-high bronze doors.
Tony dived towards the baobab, which would provide decent cover, jinking to the left as he heard the high-pitched whine of the gun firing.
Hill shrugged. "Once Fury knew Stark was coming back to New York he set a watch on Stark Tower. Once we saw Hogan and Potts were heading out through the Holland Tunnel, he figured this would be where you landed, even if your ultimate destination would be McGuire Field. Stark wouldn't have been allowed to land there – currently nothing is – but no one could stop him landing here. And no one is going to delay him with red tape on his own airfield."
The thing howled. "Doom is invincible! You cannot kill Doom!" even as the blast exploded out of the left side of its jaw. Steve twisted the barrel so it was pointing upwards and fired another long blast.
"He didn't have the opportunity either," Tony admitted. "Or when he did there were more immediate topics to discuss." He sighed and slumped back down into his chair. "The timing suggests that that monster in Seattle may finally have convinced Fury that there is a leak in his organisation. Step one would be to close down their computer network in case they'd been hacked."
- you want or need that I can give you is yours – except the armour, not that you need it but— Anyway, there's an apartment prepared for you, a whole floor in Stark Tower—"
Steve and Bruce exchanged glances. It was Bruce who said, "Maybe you ought to give her time... Let her think it over."
Steve was still hesitating, wondering if a reply would be a betrayal of Tony's trust. On the other hand, this was Pepper, and Tony had made no attempt to swear him to secrecy. He said, cautiously, "They had an argument which they both handled badly. I think Tony sees Rhodes's loyalty to the Air Force as a personal betrayal."
Normally, he would have made the coffee himself, but right now he needed the caffeine hit, so let U handle a triple espresso, with Jarvis supervising in surprising silence.
"The winds obey me," Thor replied, "then suddenly they rebel. Each time I turn the storm someone or something turns it back towards the north and west. I ask the winds to die, they obey, but then strengthen again. Someone with great power is fighting me for control of the storm."
T'Challa leaped straight at his brother, so they tumbled together across the ground, undistinguishable in their identical white costumes.
Surprised once again at his own stamina – because he certainly didn't work out – Tony circled round the back of the cabin and entered through the kitchen door.
Pushing down panic, he scrambled to his feet with a little yelp of pain as he stood on some shards of... plastic?
Steve may not have understood most of that, but he didn't argue. Even as he struggled into the suit, which didn't seem particularly heavily armoured, though he trusted Tony, he heard the thwump-thwump of a helicopter. Both men looked up to see it passing overhead, heading out into the bay.
"Hi, Legolas," he greeted, forcing cheerfulness into his voice. "Got something interesting to tell me? Is our Golden Oldie Agent Agent's granddad or an extra from
"Not only that," Danvers said, "but I know for a fact that less than a year ago that was the case. There's been scuttlebutt about this new spacecraft, but I thought it was a load of bullshit. Until last night."
"You were not dealing with me, then. I am the White Wolf, leader of the Hatut Zeraze and am charged with protecting the people and traditions of Wakanda from threats both without and within. You are such a threat."
"There are seven thousand six hundred and thirty two Stark employees currently in the building, which is slightly below average for daytime, sir, with approximately one and a half thousand working at night and weekends."
It was when the rest of them were sprawled on the sofas, chatting amiably over the remains of the frozen pizza and ice cream, that Illyana had stepped out of one of her glowing discs, followed by a whole gaggle of spandex-clad teenagers led by Summers and spoiling for a fight. It turned out that Illyana had gotten temporarily lost in space-time, otherwise they would have been here much earlier.
"She's in her nineties," Steve pointed out. "I don't think either of us could face that right now." He abruptly changed the subject. "The uniform's not important either," he went on, determined to be rational about this though the betrayal by the government,
Steve had spent a good deal of time in Tony's workshop over the last week, but this was the first time he had seen the floor littered with half a dozen large packing crates, with Tony was hammering down the lid on one of them in time to the heavy beat of what Steve could not bear to call music. When that stopped abruptly, he grinned at Steve. "Hi, Cap. I see Pep didn't throw you out.
"Silence! Or I will have your tongue cut out," Hunter threatened. He was frowning, but not at Tony. "Blood. You people have never had access to T'Challa's. So this has to be—" He took a step towards North. "If you have harmed Shuri—"
The group guarding the portal could not have missed her if they had been asleep on duty. Which they were not. Every gun fell into firing position.
"What can I get you?" Steve asked. "Bruce and I have been having a late breakfast, and there's pancake mixture left, and plenty of bacon and eggs. Bruce tells me he makes a great omelette."
Steve waved the defensive protest aside. "I don't mind that. I've been grateful for it, at times. What bothers me is that if you tell him to keep me in the dark, he will, just the way he seems to be helping you keep Natasha and Clint and Jan—"
"You are distracted, your Excellency," Clea interrupted. There were beads of sweat on her forehead and, though the glow of the necklet had faded a little, she was still plainly in pain. "Once you have mastered the artefact, Stark will do your will."
Dragging himself onto the mud, he found himself crawling over a dead body. He jerked back from the shattered torso, as his stomach finally rebelling and emptying itself over the corpse. Though it seemed to have little in it but water.
"Electro-magnet. Keeps... shrapnel in... his chest... from reaching his heart. If you want to kill him... us... at least... do it cleanly." Steve was pretty sure they didn't actually want them dead – at least not yet. Otherwise they would probably never have reached Wakanda alive.
Steve was plainly expected in Pepper's office suite, because a secretary waved him through to the PA's office and the PA, presumably alerted by the secretary, was already on his feet to usher him into the inner sanctum.
"I have not spoken to anyone who saw them arrive but they are garaged at the university, in the research centre, though some have now moved to the sacred mountain," she replied.
Except that his right back and side were a mass of bruises, black and yellow with red-brown streaks of newly-formed scabs.
"Because the Attorney General is hand in glove with the Pentagon over the copyright lawsuits. He's been consulted on the attempts to seize the ARC reactor technology too, though the main mover there is the White House Chief of Staff, who's been bought off by Roxxon Oil," Natasha explained. "Do you really think we were wasting our time in Washington, Stark?"
T'Challa looked at his brother with contempt. "Envoys who were not even Wakandans. You involved countries that already fear us when we need them to be allies."
"Before Loki. Before the Chitauri. Fury knew, but Thor made it clear we had come to the attention of forces that could destroy the world. They aren't going to go away. We need to be ready."
The shock of the armour hitting the water rattled his teeth and made him bite his lip. Though he could feel and see nothing, he knew the armour must be sinking.
"There is a call on from the local police frequency about the e-StarkStore in White Plains that perhaps you should hear, sir." Jarvis did not wait for acknowledgement, because the voice changed to that of a woman, rough and urgent, plainly scared and trying to control it, with the sound of gunfire behind. "— wholesale destruction – probably a terrorist attack — Oh my God, the things are running wild! There's blood and limbs everywhere. That one cut right through— We're retreating. Guns are useless. Repeat, guns are useless. They cut right through Kevlar—" The voice cut off, then came through again. "Sir! You can't go in there—"
government, hurt deeply. "In fact, the government may be right that it holds the copyright. You've been wanting to upgrade my body armour, Tony; now's your chance. I'm more worried about my shield."
Fingers probed tentatively at the side of his neck, feeling for a pulse, then circled on his skin, a reassuring touch. "Go back to sleep, Cap," the American voice said gently. "It's okay. We've got you. Everyone's safe. Sleep now."
Without a word passing between any of them, Steve found himself hoisted onto the grey's back by Hogun and Volstagg. "Go!" Thor told the Warriors Three, as Steve desperately tried to get his feet into the stirrups.
"No, just to my security." Tony was firm. "And I'm trying to understand the actions of yours. What incompetent allowed you to make an unscheduled return to the White House when it was right in the path of Hurricane Sandro?"
Steve looked longingly at the flaring ring. His enemies – the ones who had tried to kill Tony – lay on the other side. He was tempted to leap through and deal with them there, but until the Iron Man suit arrived Tony was desperately vulnerable. Not that it would do any good to point that out to him...
"He's my fiancé," Tony said. "His name's Stevens, soon to be changed to Stark. Or Stark-Stevens. Or Stevens-Stark. Whatever."
"Captain, hurricane Sandro has suddenly increased from a category two to a  category five hurricane. It is already the largest Atlantic storm on record and it is heading straight for the New England coast. It may make landfall anywhere between Washington DC and Maine, but the likeliest trajectory seems to be New York and Boston. It should make landfall in less than ten hours."
"Colonel Carol Danvers, USAF," Tony said, grateful to have at least one piece of information that Pepper didn't. "She's a... friend of Rhodey's. So she was flying the plane, not—" He cut off the rest of that sentence just in time. Pepper was angry enough already without him mentioning the only pilot he knew Steve had access to. Steve didn't have a pilot's licence. Not that that would have stopped him...
Steve carried his duffle down to the garage, where he found Tony rummaging in a large sports bag. It appeared to have been neatly packed – originally.
He had to give this up, instead of clinging to a stolen friendship and a desire that couldn't be consummated – that he wouldn't allow to be consummated.
"Probably a good thing. I don't think he has much time for wunderkind. Ow!" Howard added as Tony poked him with his elbow. "He's reclusive and can be touchy. But your mother was friends with his wife. She was called Maria too," he added. As always, there was sadness in his voice when he spoke of Tony's mother. "I'll go through Jan Van Dyne."
This time Steve met his eyes as he smiled, open and honest. "I know. But it's not the first time and, to be frank, if alcohol affected me at all I would probably have needed someone to do the same for me."
Thor had lost everything, yet he was giving away the greatest symbol of what he had been. A broken – no, shattered – god, he was fleeing into space to escape the guilt of what he had let happen to the Nine Realms. He had also been Steve's last reason to stay with the Avengers.
"It wasn't Rhodey," Tony said again. "He's not dead. I mean, I've no evidence he's alive, but at least he wasn't in the suit. So there's that. Not that he'd ever give it up willingly. Maybe that's why he wanted to see me, I don't know. But what else could I have done, Steve? If he's dead... He still could be dead..."
"Did anyone remember to evacuate Captain America?" he asked. Tony was still haunted by his first view of the World War 2 hero on board the helicarrier, still imprisoned in a chunk of iceberg or pack-ice or glacier (he'd never thought to ask which.) Through the misty ice he'd still been able to see Cap's ridiculous but famous red white and blue uniform with the ludicrous little wings on his cowl.
However, he was still effectively blind and had to allow himself to be manoeuvred into what was presumably the passenger seat of the SUV. Even as the engine roared to life and the vehicle jerked forward, Steve's slightly breathless voice came over the communicators. "Bruce, do you have Tony?"
Tony resisted smirking. It took a real effort, but he managed it. "Oh, and when you tell Fury about this, you can also tell him to keep the blonde who looks and sounds like Peggy Carter away from Steve."
Hennis's gun was now pointing directly at Tony's groin. "I'm tired of this," he said. "Give us Rogers or, even if you survive the blood loss, your playboy lifestyle is over."
"Some of it," Steve said. "I mean, that people have been to the Moon, is like stepping into a science fiction story. And that Germany and Japan are now peaceful democracies, that's great. The internet is fantastic..."
Then a voice – he thought it was White Wolf's – barked what was unmistakably an order in an unknown language.
"Told you," Jan's voice said and now there really was laughter in it. "If I wanted to harm you you'd both be dead or unconscious by now, but we're on your side. Whoever they are, the guys who abducted you aren't Air Force – aren't US military of any kind."
"None of your fucking business," Danvers told him. "And aren't you sorta engaged to your PA – sorry, your firm's CEO?"
"Thanks." With that worry dismissed, Tony downed the rest of the contents of the glass and reached to replace it on the tub-side table and exchange it for his phone (the only smart phone on the market that came with waterproofing as standard, though this one was far from standard.) Just before he touched it, it burst into the theme tune from
Whatever he said was going to be wrong. It always was. But he hated silence, and this particular silence was unbearable.
Tony quirked an eyebrow. "Well, I didn't want make Bruce angry with me; you know how green he gets. He was really worried about you being alone."
Steve turned to give him a quizzical look, and Tony raised his glass in an obvious toast. "Thanks for the retrieval."
"The Panther tribe, at least, will wait to see what member of the family of their tribal chiefs is beloved of the Panther God." All the same the Panther sounded... uncertain.
"Okay, Jarvis," he whispered, the nano-microphone against his throat picking up the words. "Let's show 'em what we can do, just the way we discussed."
He'd underestimated the scale, too. The 'huts' were large, and clustered into linked groups of five or six. Ahead lay an inner compound, also surrounded by a barricade, but one apparently made from the same yellow substance as the hut walls. The SUVs stopped before high wooden gates with inlaid from top to bottom with ivory and bronze. Squinting against the reflected light, Tony could make out scenes depicting combat between men and ... gorillas? There were high lookout platforms on either side, manned by what appeared to be ceremonial warriors armed only with bows and spears.
"You're fine. Being listened to by Captain America is really flattering. All you need to do is learn to flirt a little. Watch Tony. He flirts with everything."
Well, he could give it a shot. "Captain America isn't here. Just Steve. Who is worried about his friend Tony."
Tony had lived his life with the knowledge that, if he was involved, these things were seldom accidental. He bore Jan to the floor of the limo, but she suddenly vanished from beneath him, leaving her clothes in a patch of scarlet on the floor and taking to the air in a flash of wings.
"Hey, saving New York, right? And dying, don't forget that." Tony's grin was manic, but there was pain behind it. "Thinking I wasn't going to be able to say, 'See? Wrong about Stark?' to you."
Though, short of tying Tony up then locking him in the workshop, Steve could not think of a way he could have stopped him – and that would have put an end to the friendship that meant so much to him.
"She was working for SHIELD, supplying them with information about me and you and Stark Industries. Had been for years."
He managed to stop himself smiling at the quip. "So how much has Fury been paying you for your information? Though now I come to think of it, you've played Government advocate at every turn, so they've probably been paying you too."
But the Wakandans watched in total silence as one of the hounds Tony had seen earlier lolloped across the compound, gave the waiting man a cursory sniff, and sat between him and the vehicle.
The air was full of dust. Behind it, there was a noise that was vaguely familiar, of something large moving inside the cloud.
"This one, if you insist." Iron Man relinquished one of the bags, which was much heavier than Steve had expected. "It's yours, anyway."
Again the exchange of glances. "No, he was neither," Clint said. "Phil Coulson put those files together – under protest, because he didn't agree with the psychologists."
"Not just 'missing, presumed dead.' He'd been declared dead. But Dad never gave up on him and he was right."
"Honey, I'm pretty sure that you'll never be ignored – not when there are hetero women or gay men around."
The right wingtip touched the surface and the ornithopter tumbled, ass over tits, as Dum Dum would have said, into the bay.
Bruce looked down at his hands. "He listens to you and I just wanted to see... "His eyes lifted to meet Tony's." You're a volatile combination."
"C'mere." Tony pulled Steve forward and wrapped his arms around him, and there seemed nothing for Steve to do but return the favour, resting his head on Tony's shoulder.
"Because she stole something I never meant anyone to use. And Tony's fond of her. They used to date, I think. And he did destroy her father's dream – and him. Obie – her father – used to be my friend. He may have been a total bastard but he loved her and I'll do what I can for both of them. Come on, son. The food's getting cold."
Even as he finished pulling the last knot tight, the man's legs came up, kicking for his groin. Steve twisted to block with his thigh. The man avoided contact and spun his way to his feet. Steve had seen films where people did something similar, but had always assumed it was a special effect. Now he realised he was facing an all-too-real martial artist.
Tony shrugged, which was quite a feat in the armour. He was rather proud of the articulation. "I did okay. Call it a trial run."
"Do you remember a woman I hired on Pepper's instructions last year? I think she worked with you both for a while. Natalie Rushman. A redhead. Very well qualified but left in a hurry shortly after that disastrous affair at Stark Expo."
"And good morning to you, too," Tony said, recognising the voice. He switched the phone to speaker and put a finger to his lips to warn Steve. "Jarvis, offline for precisely five minutes. No record of this conversation."
No, he was finding it difficult to sleep because there was no warm body beside him. How the heck had he gotten so addicted to Tony's presence in so short a time?
Tony moved fast, finding it surprisingly easy to block Steve's path to the elevator and stop him by grasping his arms. Steve's eyes were wide, deer-in-the- headlights wide, and far, far too bright and he was, fuck it, shaking – or shivering? – in Tony's grip. "Oh, no, you don't run away again. At least, not unless you tell me why you came here in the first place."
If she wanted to assume he only meant himself, she could do so. But he hoped she might share her feelings as he was sharing his.
He was drifting through that state where his dreaming intersected with the real world, aware that he was dreaming, but also aware that he could choose to dream on or to wake up, when Tony's voice drew him out into wakefulness.
Stark nodded, as if that confirmed what he had suspected. "It's Rogers," he said. "Steven Rogers. Steve."
Steve's back was so beautifully sculpted in bone and muscle that Tony caught his breath. The bruises were pale yellow, almost invisible because the rest of Steve's back was a patchwork of pink, newly grown skin – dear God, the damage had been even more extensive than he thought...
"She's taking a chance," Steve answered, "but the odds are good, even if they decide to take her up on it. Unless the Lieutenant and the girl are bad guys."
They'd never have reached it in time to save it. That alone justified Tony's decision to go after the ornithopter, which was just about to cross the shoreline at the very tip of Manhattan Island.
Steve had withdrawn his hand, allowing Tony to bury his face in a cushion, though he wasn't sure if he was disappointed or relieved. He certainly didn't need to see Bruce's raised eyebrow as he asked, "Do you want me to go on?"
He cast a careful look over her to make sure she was unhurt, then turned towards the limo. Its driver had not moved. "Happy..."
"Hi, Cap," Stark said, looking at him... appreciatively? He also seemed nervous. "Care for some brunch?"
Selvig ruffled his stubble with the back of his hand and an air of satisfaction. "Ah. So it is you."
"Bully," Tony accused, but his eyelids were sagging. Even so, he noticed Steve's wince and felt a moment of regret. Not half as much, though, as he wished the room would stop rocking and greying in front of his eyes. He swayed back into Steve's welcome support. Nor did he protest when Steve lifted him to his feet; in fact, it was, sort of... nice. In the end, he didn't remember reaching his bed.
"Actually, you were the one who set me on the right track, Tony. Way back when, you suggested that the Chitauri themselves might be weaponry. The so-called Leviathans have far more processing power – more brain, in layman's terms, though the semi-organic silicon 'neurones' are spread throughout its body – than is needed to control that body. They receive and broadcast both information and power – don't ask me how, but that is what they seem to do.
"She did not, sir. At her request, I isolated the data set and scanned it; it contains nothing dangerous. She assured me I would know when to use it and that, at that time, you would give me the order to do so."
"You didn't have those built overnight," Steve said. "Normally they take years of development— Why do I think you're grinning behind that faceplate, Stark?"
He didn't need to guess what it was meant to do, though, and it had nothing to do with Dr Henry Pym's work on the Chitauri tech.
"If Wakanda reneges, they'll answer to me. But they won't. They don't want your agents, just to be left alone. Is it a deal?"
"Yes," Thor said, with that supreme confidence that came, Steve supposed from being a god and his mother's son. Though Odin might be even worse...
Tony eased himself into a sitting position, trying to conceal how painful it was to move. In front of him, reflected in the chrome trim, the glow of the arc reactor was bright and steady.
"Only to tell her I'm on my way. I'll handle it." Though Tony was not at all sure that he could. He stopped the car just inside the gates and turned to Steve, who was watching him warily, the way he had all the way back from Xavier's.
"Pepper." He succumbed to temptation and took hold of her shoulders, shaking her slightly as he said, "Pepper, I – was – not – sleeping – with – Steve... or Rhodey, come to that. How long have you known me? Ten years?"
Angrily, he blinked back the tears that still came to his eyes at the thought of his old unit, keeping his face turned away from Tony until he was under control again. Not so long ago, they would have been tears of anger, but that had been blown away in the wreck of Manhattan. The people of his city had needed him, as had his new teammates.
"Cap," Iron Man said, "there are things I don't want anyone else to see. I need you to distract those guys while I collect what remains of War Machine: there might be something left that shouldn't be in the wrong hands. Just let me get the First Aid Kit from the transporter, and I'll give you a lift to the road."
"Forgive me. It's just I haven't seen any evidence of the playboy. Of course, now I've met Ms Potts I kinda understand you laying off that one."
"Right." Tony reached for a tablet and began sketching, the design appearing in the air in front of him. With his right hand, he was tapping figures onto a keypad, without a single glance either down or to where the numbers were appearing in the air.
Steve pulled the stick over to the right, shoved the wing-beat lever to its fullest extent and gently pressed his foot down on the right hand side of the rudder bar.
Steve's eyes were unfocused. He shook his head violently. "None of you understand. I've been running on empty for so long. Like Bucky... but you... you're... I've tried. I know I've let you all down. I can't—" Tony could feel the shaking growing worse as he took more of Steve's weight. "Why... why would you want to help me...?" His eyes rolled upwards and he slumped into Tony's arms, bearing him to the floor.
That took care of his erection. Unfortunately, the feel of the cold water caressing his skin turned to the imagined touch of Tony's metal-clad hands, which threatened to bring it back. Desperately, he put his efforts into concentrating on each stroke: on the beat of his feet and the stretch of his arms, on the dip and turn of his head and how many strokes he was taking between each breath...
The landing was as smooth as any Tony had experienced and they disembarked into a hot pre-dawn which was likely, he thought gloomily, to get much hotter.
Tony thought about the crates of vibranium, about what Natasha and Clint might have learned in Washington and what Pepper might be doing there, about accelerating the StarkEnergy programme, about getting Erik Selvig to look at the remains of the portal, about the SHIELD agents stationed outside his building, about the meetings he had to attend, the research he needed to do and about Steve's death and the decisions he would have to make about that, sooner or later.
Tony hadn't been sure what the gun did, and he still wasn't after the crackling red light had surrounded the 'honour guard' and felled them in an instant. T'Challa, meanwhile, had taken down the man who had been questioning him, if that was what he was, in a flurry of blows worthy of Captain America himself.
It didn't work. "I'd hoped she might be," Steve said, blushing painfully. "After the war, y'know. But that was seventy years ago." His voice, which had started out tentative, was becoming more resolute by the word. "I know I can't go back, that she probably doesn't want to be reminded, even if she remembers me." For the first time, his eyes met Tony's, and he seemed to find some reassurance there. "But I was tempted just to hear her voice."
"Great." That meant that the version of Jarvis downloaded into the suit was strictly limited until he could exchange information with his main servers. Tony peered into the darkness. "Anything on sonar?"
"I never claimed to be a soldier. Right from the beginning, I told you we weren't. And you make an awful spy, too, by the way. You give Natasha hives."
"Scanning isn't violating anything. At least, not if it's undetectable. Let's do it. And start breaking through their firewalls. Mentions of 'vibranium' or, of course, me."
Even as Stark Tower on that fateful day in 2012 materialised about Steve, he had a moment to realise that something was horribly wrong. Instinctively, he  reached for his non-existent shield... when case containing the stones exploded in his hand, a rainbow flash hurling him across the wrecked lobby, his shoulder burning as if Tony's arc reactor had embedded itself there.  He had just a moment to curse himself for his mistake before he crashed to the floor and lost consciousness
A tall woman with black hair in a waterfall of curls down her back burst from the pavilion, holding a small, egg-like object cupped in her hands. Its intense, icy light illuminated features inhuman in their symmetry, but was swallowed in the darkness of her eyes.
Steve let out the breath, trying to control it so that Tony didn't realise he was doing it. "Was that at the same time as I woke up?"
"Starks always go large." There was laughter hidden in Natasha's voice though you would have had to know her well to hear it. "I saw your Malibu mansion, remember?"
"Except that you plainly weren't meant to come to us," Howard said. "No one could know that Tony would find you – and SHIELD thinks you're dead."
The voice did not exactly add, "Rescue me, sir," but the plea was there in the rising pitch and volume.
"No! No, it's just... well, if I'd believed this was even possible I wouldn't have been caught without condoms or lube. I had no idea you were bi. I'm not inexperienced, but it's been a while. And I want this to be good for you."
Steve let out a breath of relief: Tony was actually going to tell him. "So what is it?" he asked, trying to keep even a hint of accusation out of his voice. "C'mon, Tony, you've obviously been sitting on something. Now give."
Steve quietly released his seat belt, checked he knew how to find reverse gear, and plastered as stupid an expression as he could manage onto his face as the bigger of the two men, wearing coveralls and a scowl, strode over to peer through the broken window.
"Where he was seriously injured, acquired that damn device in his chest, was tortured, saw the man who saved his life killed..."
"Thank..." Steve swallowed the word 'God' afraid that it might be regarded as an insult. But that didn't matter. Thor's word was good. Tony was safe. That was all that really mattered. He slipped into sleep.
"I was sent on a mission to find Jim Rhodes," Danvers said. "I haven't accomplished that yet. And if there are traitors in the Air Force, the Air Force needs to set its own house in order. I can't do that alone. If you're all willing, I'd like to work with you. As for you, Lieutenant, we aren't sending you back to be kidnapped again – at least, not until we have some idea of why those imposters abducted you."
Though aware he was being distracted, Tony couldn't refrain from lecturing. "Bruce explained it to me. Hulk is different, more rational, when Bruce deliberately triggers the change. This time he didn't. How's Hank?"
Steve hauled on the hand, pulling Bucky up towards him, and pain lanced so hard into his back that he had to bite back a scream...
"And let Nat have a copy once you're sure it's safe, Jarvis," Tony ordered, "and send a record of this briefing plus your video of the attempted kidnapping and the helicopter-submarine to the Tower, marked for the urgent attention of Barton and Romanoff. They may have some ideas."
"That's between you and her," Marilyn said firmly. "But it's not why I wanted to see you personally – and, though I presume that ever-present super-computer of yours is recording these proceedings, I want your assurance that, otherwise, this room is secure."
Steve noted both Howard's careful phrasing and Tony's visible flinch. And, of course, the samples against which Hank Pym had compared his own DNA had to have come from somewhere. He doubted that either Tony or Howard would have asked Fury for them. But just how had Howard known that Steve had 'assaulted' anyone?
"I sorta got that when you suddenly added that bit in about 'forsaking all others' into your vows," Tony said, but he sounded absurdly happy.
He should never have tried for a relationship with Pepper. He'd only done that once before – but that disaster was best forgotten, had been forgotten. He had been betrayed then, just as he had been betrayed now. But this mess was partly his fault too. He'd let Pepper manage him for years, because he hadn't wanted to bother, so he'd done what he found interesting, and left the rest to her and Obie. It wasn't surprising that, when he decided to face his responsibilities and take charge of his life and his company, she sought new ways of managing him – and it. Then, when, faced with his impending death, he'd offered her... well, everything ... it was no surprise that she'd grabbed it with both hands.
"Precisely, but if we wait for politicians to do what's right for the long term but damaging in the short term we'll wait forever."
"Well if that is indeed the case – and I believed it to be so – why, when I proposed that she become my wife, did she refuse? In front of the entire council! I have not had time to cultivate women – indeed, it would be dangerous to my position – but you—"
"Undisturbed," Tony replied. "I'm disappointed in your super soldier vision – I was expecting at least a built-in infra-red night sight."
"Not sure," Steve mumbled into Tony's neck. He raised his head to look into warm brown eyes. Surprisingly, what occurred to him at that moment was that the reason Tony had given all his suits glowing demon eyes was that no one could have been scared by his own. "I had no one," he said, "nowhere to go, no place in this century, just the expectations of Captain America hanging over me... Now I'm not Captain America and freer for it. I've got a place, a home, and friends here and in Asgard and Wakanda. And you. Most importantly, you."
Steve grinned. It totally transformed his face. Tony almost wanted to hide from what the brilliance was doing to his hangover. "Not exactly. But I had to make sure they were ready to fight the next day."
Then the woman's face lost all expression. She said two unintelligible words and then the artefact, in its plastic wrapping, appeared floating in the air in front of her, dripping water. Even as the Doombot reached for it, it jerked into flight, straight towards Tony. The Doombot reacted by throwing one its balls of energy at Jean, and she and the artefact crashed to the floor simultaneously.
"Alive, certainly," he said, as he lifted the man in his arms and carried him over to a cot almost hidden in the corner of the room. Laying him on the mattress, he adjusted him into the recovery position. "And unconscious, otherwise they would have certainly woken up when you clanked in."
Damn it, he thought he'd gotten this panic at seeing Tony in deadly danger under control. At least there had been no one present to see, least of all Tony himself.
Steve turned and ran for the door, knowing that Iron Man would be right behind him, even if he hadn't heard the hiss of the servos and the metallic thudding of the boots on the rubber flooring.
Tony shrugged. "I don't think it's relevant. We all stand on the shoulders of giants, and Richards would have been a giant in theoretical physics, had he lived."
"Well, I'm not. You could just have asked! Or probably heard my heartbeat, given how good your hearing is."
"It is almost stationary," Jarvis reported, "but is still building in strength, if slowly. This defies all known hurricane behaviour."
Jan was reaching for the Hulk, but Steve fended her off. "No, it's okay. Hulk, it's just fine. We came to help you."
"I have noticed," the man said, hesitantly, "that he seems to be in more pain when his friends are with him. Perhaps there is a reason."
"You've never seen me with a one night stand," Tony said sharply. "Steve, what happened that night shocked me. Not because you're a man – I've had affairs with men, a couple of them serious. But I was in a long-term relationship with
Howard grinned at him, making no move to follow his order. "He's a robot that thinks it isn't. All of them think they're Von Doo– wait, Whitney's coming round! Don't let her get the mask!"
What had he heard Obie tell Pepper once? "The best way to get Tony to do something is to tell him he can't."
"They're less competent than I am, and I'm not treating eye injuries," Bruce snapped. "Good evening, Director." Bruce's hand tugged insistently at Tony's arm, and he responded to it while really, really wishing he could see Fury's face.
In the shared areas of the Avengers quarters, though, Tony had his own way. Not that Steve was allowed to use to kitchen area, because Tony had made it clear that he expected him in the penthouse or the workshop, if he happened to be there himself, for breakfast and dinner.
Iron Man came in to land using the workshop entrance, allowed the robots to strip away the armour, leaving him in a rumpled lightweight suit that had cost a fortune and would, no doubt, cost almost as much to put back into its original pristine condition. Tony flung the crumpled jacket over U, followed it with his tie and sweat-soaked shirt, grabbed an ancient but clean t-shirt out of a drawer, and headed towards the bright lights and colours that indicated the holographics were in operation.
he added, to himself. Which 'storm'? Both 'storms'? And how does this tie in with the War Machine's attack?
"Not on your life," Gene said hurriedly. "That thing practically screamed 'send to Tony Stark' at me. Not to mention earned me a visit from Madame Masque. No. It's all yours. Now, are you going to introduce me to your friends?"
The great head turned towards Clea, ignoring Tony. "Princess of the Dark Dimension, this is none of your concern."
Clea rolled her eyes at both of them. "Not in this case. 'Soul' isn't a precise term but it's the only one you have in human languages. It can mean many things. Try this: the body creates the mind and the mind shapes the soul."
"We can use it to get my lord to safety, and—" Okoye broke off as Hank Pym, clad in a pair of red coveralls, with the helmet Tony had built for him masking his face and blond head – for which Tony was pathetically grateful – appeared at her side.
Then, in the army, he'd unlearned all of that, learned instead to catch sleep anywhere and everywhere, in each quiet or noisy moment, however cold, wet or uncomfortable he might be at the time.
A hand fell on Tony's shoulder, squeezing hard enough to make the armour creak. "Does our comrade yet live, my friend?"
The floodlights were out. The only illumination was provided by the arc-reactor-powered light in his chest plate and that did not even reach to the edges of the cave.
"Set that aside for the moment," Howard said. "We will explain, I promise. I don't think they're after Steve, Tony. Unless someone outside this room knows he's here. As I understand it, the Doombots have a measure of independent intelligence, plus Doom's ego. Its creator tried to steal your tech before, so maybe it remembered. Meanwhile, what about Fury?"
At once, a strong arm slid behind his back, and the goblet was held close to his lips. It smelt wonderful. He sipped at it cautiously, and the thick liquid soothed his throat as instantly as it warmed his stomach.
At his back, Tony was shifting uncomfortably, plainly unable to decide whether to sleep facing Steve or with his back to him. He understood that, because he had the same problem.
The sergeant tossed the rest of the liquor down his throat. "There's somethin' been buggin' me," he said, in an entirely different tone. "Phil, now, he grew up on stories of Captain America, most of which he got from me."
"Kids are pretty unlikely considering the serum altered my DNA," Steve retorted. "Not to mention it didn't alter my personal... preferences."
Or perhaps that ought to wait, for the usually talkative Tony was, Steve noted, abnormally quiet as he flew them the eighty or so miles to McGuire. And what little he did say was through the Iron Man speakers, not Tony to Steve over the communicators. Of course, this might be because he was busy talking to Jarvis, SHIELD and the Air Force but, if so, Steve was not allowed to hear those conversations.
"And charged. Don't dare let them hit my shields again. Still recharging." A trap for him, which Cap would have already worked out. No use telling him to use that advantage to leave, though. He said, "Nothing outside – except cops. Power source must be in here somewhere. Is anyone here still alive?"
He had missed the part of the conversation with the cops, but it was plainly not a confrontation. One of the patrolmen was apologising for stopping them. "Guess the curfew doesn't apply to you, Mr Stark."
Glass and metal flew in all directions. A wheel bounced towards Steve. Without thought, he shifted position, scooped it from the air and hurled it at the armoured figure, which raised a hand and blasted it to its component atoms.
Manhandling Captain America, even in the armour, would probably have ended in disaster and, even if they had been close enough friends to share a hug, there wouldn't have been much satisfaction in it with metal between them.
Tony was just pouring himself a second glass of brandy when Steve arrived and came to lean companionably beside him against the side of the truck.
Tony rose on his boot jets, quieter than the birdsong and the plop of a fish out in the lake, higher than the roof but not higher than the tops of the trees. He positioned himself above the French doors, then descended vertically at speed, threw the doors wide and raised his hands, palms outwards, repulsors charged.
Frigga shook her head at him. Once she was alone with Steve, she came to stand looking down at him, a smile on her face. "I hope Fandral took good care of you," she said.
"Me either," Rhodey agreed, unexpectedly. "But isn't it better to undermine the bad from within rather than fight it head on from outside?
"You look after Virginia Potts, Stark," Hill said gruffly. "She's worth ten of you." She grinned, suddenly. "She's also damn mad at you right now." With that, she ducked into the helicopter, which lifted away into the night.
There was a blinding flash of light and the aircraft began spinning, its undercarriage skids scraping over the top of the wall, sparks cascading down and scorching the already parched grass.
In the personal darkness that followed, he felt himself grabbed from the rear, only it wasn't flesh that was snatched but his tee shirt as he was hauled into the air.
"So the Wasp is Jan, and I presume you are 'Betty'," the girl was saying, as she took the seat next to her.
But, in fact, a woman appeared through the portal and strode towards the battlesuited men. The ones who had been seated leaped to their feet and the whole group stiffened to attention.
In a way, he'd been grateful for the distraction, though he wasn't looking forward to reading the mass of files downloaded onto his StarkPad. He'd've already been immersed in them, except for the trouble refuelling the jet.
"It may be more than a faction," T'Challa said. "An attack on me is more likely to come from your State department. My agents here are working on it, along with the Embassies of our allies, but I have more faith in your computers and your contacts, Stark."
Left isolated on the Greenway, Steve had become all too aware that people were playing 'spot-the-superhero' and felt incredibly self-conscious and exposed to every cell phone in the vicinity. He shifted his shield to his left arm and was wondering if he ought to exercise his rusty PR skills when the realised that the powerful man in the dark suit making his way as casually as he could – which wasn't very – through the growing crowds was not only vaguely familiar but someone he recognised – Tony's chauffeur-cum-bodyguard who had been introduced to him simply as 'Happy'.
A bright white light cut through the murk, bouncing from the swirling mud, a dust storm in the water. The wall of debris was pulled aside and Iron Man's glowing eyeslits appeared above the brighter circle in the breastplate.
Maybe Steve should have kept the White Wolf costume after all. It was good for a laugh, with that cape and those shoulder pads.
Steve heard what sounded like someone choking back a laugh, probably Clint. Then Natasha said, "What were we supposed to think, Stark? First of all Clint lost contact in what the National Weather Service are calling an 'unusually isolated squall' and what the press are shouting was an 'unprecedented mini-storm', and when we got it back, you were apparently asleep and had given Jarvis instructions not to wake you."
Steve made his decision instinctively. "Jarvis! Open the gates!" he shouted, grabbing the woman by the arm. "Run!"
Besides, with any luck, it would make him look older. And a bit badass. Maybe he could make it a Tony Stark trademark...
There were so many emotions: shame at what he had done, fury at the way Tony had tried to conceal the failure of the ARC reactor, fear that he had done so much damage to him that Tony would never forgive him—
"Changing it afterwards, Rushman," Tony told her, with the last of his breath. Then the world went away again.
"Thank you." Tony said happily. He glared at Hennis. "There, you have your answer. Now get the hell out of my building."
"Are you sure he's dead?" Natasha demanded, scepticism plain in her voice. "After all, he was supposed to be dead for seventy years."
He had no doubt she meant it, would have fought the Chitauri with anything she could have laid hands on. Like Peggy.
"Sit down, Capta—." He broke off as Tony shook his head at him, but continued smoothly. "Coffee? Orange juice?"
Jarvis kept him updated on Sandro and Steve occasionally came through with comments on their latest discoveries and speculations about Ross's files.
"Yes. Mr Stark is in the process of completely rearranging the building so all of the Avengers will have personal suites, among other things. It was one of the things he and Ms Potts disagreed about. He did not consult her about that – or the renaming of the tower."
"I will project a holographic image of what is happening at this moment," Jarvis said, and suddenly, half the room was filled with light and people. Though they were perhaps a quarter of their normal size they looked totally real, rounded, alive, moving, just as in the TV ads for the new Stark Games console – whatever that was, exactly. The reality was stunning and, just for a moment, Steve simply marvelled at the technology.
"It would be better if we still had Hulk, Cap and Thor," Natasha said bluntly. "And with no offense to Van Dyne and Pym here."
Tony's eyes opened, blinked a couple of times, then he smiled at Steve with such sweetness that, for a moment, it drove everything but desire out of Steve's head. "Hey," he said.
"SHIELD agents have moral standards? Well, Coulson did, of course, but he's dead, isn't he? Fury certainly isn't above using sex—"
And Tony fought him, struggling even before his face had cleared the water, and yelling, "What the fuck?" as soon as there was air in his lungs.
Meanwhile, Tony had put the finishing touches to the next iteration of Iron Man and set the manufacturing bots to work, dealt with reports from Seattle and Stark Energy branch offices and...
Jan put her head on one side and regarded him quizzically. "You really aren't good at understanding people, are you? Pepper built her life around you and Stark Industries – but mainly you. I'm a threat. I've known you far longer than she has and she doesn't really believe I see you as a big brother rather than a potential lover. She also thinks I lead you astray, rather than the other way about. I'm a few years younger than she is but had created my own business and made a fortune I didn't need while she was still your assistant. And I'm a woman. She doesn't see men as the same sort of threat."
Black wasn't really Pepper's colour, particularly with her bright hair tucked away beneath an equally black hat that shaded her face. Even the blouse under the designer jacket of her skirt suit was steel grey. He wondered if she would have been so conventional at his own funeral or if she would have followed the instructions in his will and worn red and gold.
Steve, though, had dropped both his hands and was looking at Tony's revealed chest in a kind of horror, not at the arc reactor, which he was on record as finding 'beautiful' but at the bruises and scrapes that covered every inch of skin.
Clint chuckled. "Yeah, well, you're prejudiced. And Nat's got some kinky suspicions about you and Steve."
Then Thor and Sif were galloping along the Bifrost and Steve's horse was galloping with them. Steve gripped the front of the saddle, wrapped his legs as far as they would go underneath the grey's belly and attempted to find his balance.
"Yes." Okoye had also, plainly, pulled herself together. "Captain Rogers and I came by sail boat. How did your party arrive?"
"I... see," Pepper said, and Steve was suddenly sure she saw a great deal more than his words had revealed. Indeed, she looked dismayed.
Tony shrugged. "Bad memories. Obie used to play the previous one that stood here sometimes and Pepper doesn't like modern jazz, which is what I mainly play – used to play."
He had been surprised when the hammer had slapped into his palm, signalling that he continued to be worthy of it.
Pepper rose from behind her desk and came to greet him. "Steve, thank you for coming. Coffee and danish?”
"Sure." Tony rose into the air and shaded his eyes with a gauntleted hand, peering along the troop carrier's spines.
"Steve, what's wrong?" Tony asked. "When I woke up and you'd gone, I was  scared you'd lef— you'd decided sex with me was a mistake."
"Perhaps, but it wasn't a fighter that took off half an hour after the helicopter's arrival," T'Challa said. "It was a long range transport and it was heading across the Atlantic."
"Something I once called the Jericho," Tony said, and he could hear the smirk in his own voice. "Think yourself honoured."
He conceded the point to Stark, unable to do anything but shake his head. Then, "Food?" he reminded Stark who grinned, looking even younger.
"Piece of Asgardian tech. What all this—" Tony waved an expansive hand at the cityscape, "— was about."
Tony was on his feet. "For God's sake, Dad," he said, around a slice of toast. "She thinks the sun shines out of Fury's ass and she's already applied to be a SHIELD agent when she finishes college. She won't believe what we suspect they were doing with Cap, so even if we swear her to secrecy, we can't trust her not to let it slip to SHIELD because she
"That's what Phil promised too," Pepper said, and Steve could hear the break in her voice as the line abruptly went dead.
"Thank you. Thank you. I didn't expect you to build them. I... uh... I'll just go and check them out." Hank was moving reasonably slowly as he started for the door, but by the time he reached it he was running.
Tony looked doubtful. "SHIELD may have briefed her," he said. "I would have done, in case the press contacted her for a quote. And you're pretty unmistakeable, particularly to someone who... knew you that well."
Tony shook his head. "You can't be that physically intimate with someone you already... care about... without it changing things. It changed things with Pep, believe me. Last night... we were high on adrenaline and relief. You – we – need time to think, to decide if what we have now is enough, or whether we want to... take that risk. Now, go and have a shower, or a bath. Borrow my razor and get rid of the beard."
There was an even longer pause, then Pepper said, "But can he remember your social security number?"
Who weren't all Wakandan. Though not all of those in battlefield greens were white. They all had guns, though, not spears, as if the spears weren't dangerous enough. Soldiers, then, probably mercenaries, because that uniform wasn't that of any National army Tony had encountered in years of selling armaments to the world.
"Everyone know each other?" he asked breezily, seating himself with a studied casualness, though in truth he didn't hurt as much as he'd expected. "Good. We'll start with you, Danvers. Did you have a nice chat with the Air Force secretary?"
"SHIELD took advantage of Steve and tried to hold onto him by feeding him misinformation. I resent that, by the way, on principle. No-one – least of all Steve – should be lied to just because they're useful because, you know, they become less useful that way."
"But how come we're here – in Stark Tower – presumably at the aftermath of the Battle of New York—?" Natasha asked.
"That's it! Fury is—" Tony bit off his words and Steve had the suspicion that that sentence was going to end in a threat. "And Bruce? Is there anything about Bruce?"
The helicarrier was lying on its side in the central channel of Long Island Sound. Someone was going to have to find a way to remove it – or possibly blow it up, and would they let him do that, did you suppose? – or shipping was going to be seriously impeded.
"Below us!" Storm yelped, as, in a blink-and-you-miss-it moment, something small and grey zipped past them.
"And on whom you have not the slightest claim. If Captain America isn't dead then, wherever he is, you imprisoned him illegally and I'd advise him to sue you for every cent you have. As for Mr Stark's friend, he makes no claim to be Captain America, and we do not do so on his behalf."
"I don't think we were in shot," Tony said, plainly in tune with his thoughts. Neither of them would want those shots out on the net. "Cameras seem to be movement sensitive. Anyway, if there's anything embarrassing on record I'll wipe it."
"No!" Tony shouted, turning to face it. "All of you, get out of here. Run, right now, and keep running."
"Oh, we can both do better," Tony said, "but that was pretty damn good. Remember what I said about 'No'? I am certain that if I'd said 'No' you would have stopped. I didn't."
"Hi yourself." Her appearance might have been Western, but her voice was pure New York. "Aren't you all grown up now?" She stroked her chin with her fingers, miming a beard.
Huh? If it was real, the DIA and USACIDC were going to be pissed. "Hey," Tony said brightly, "are you the Army equivalent of the NCIS and, if so, have you got any hot Goth scientists, because I've met the beautiful deadly foreign spy and that kind of thing isn't all it's cracked up to be?" He hoped Natasha would forgive him if she ever heard about it.
"We're going fight them," Tony went on grimly. "I think we'll have public sympathy, as well as legal precedent. They never patented any of the elements of Project Rebirth and they've got no evidence of any later success. Erskine died a long time ago and if anyone else has any kind of claim I guess it would be my Dad, so Stark Industries is about to start a nuisance counter-claim."
Damn it, he had to stop comparing every woman he met to Peggy who had, with her usual pragmatism, fought through the rest of the war, changed agencies, changed again, helped set up SHIELD, become a high ranking agent, then head of the training section. The fact that the file had said nothing at all about her personal relationships suggested to Steve that whoever had compiled it had omitted that material to protect him.
Tony shook his head, unable to express his admiration. "Tell me again why we never got involved, Jan."
"Hey, he's a portal whisperer. And I may have given him a few clues. Pathetic ones, but clues none the less. Meanwhile, all of you need to get out of there ASAP."
Watching a muttering Tony locate the bottle of Scotch and pour himself a large helping, Steve was horrified to discover that he not only wanted to snatch the drink from his hands, but to take him in his arms and kiss the need for it away.
Tony was hot and sticky by the time they came out on the bank of a wide river. Walkways on stilts stalked out into the water, linking platforms on which stood brightly painted dwellings – too large and solid to be called 'huts' but too small to be called 'houses' – and rows of troughs overflowing with vegetation. The tide was out and the few boats remaining moored to the stilts bobbed against the lower rungs of the wooden ladders linking platforms and water.
Jan rolled her eyes while 'Helen of Troy' grinned at them both and said, "Jan, aren't you going to introduce us?"
"We have not met," the warrior said. "My lady has hidden— I need to get back before she returns and realises I am gone. I can use the portal—"
And one of the reasons he had those extra days was the pair of Jiminy Crickets in his ear that had made him pause before every reply – and that had given him a few moments to actually think about what he wanted to say. Towards the end of the meeting Steve and Bruce had been remarkably quiet, save for occasional murmurs of approval.
"I already have. I held a Board Meeting and I own ninety per cent of the voting shares. You can take either cash or Stark Industries stock or a mixture of both. Marilyn has the papers drawn up. I'll do the CEO job there myself. But, as Chairman of SI, I'm going to keep a closer eye on what we're producing – and who we're selling it to."
The stars were still bright on what was presumably the western horizon but there was already a touch of light behind the high hills to the east – and was that a higher, isolated peak? He blinked, and there were only stars.
He couldn't let that happen. They needed protection, or something, anything that could be used as a weapon against the armour.
There was no sign of the Panther, but Steve's familiar silhouette stood out black against the glow of the firebox.
"They'll be expecting us to make a run for it as soon as they realise we've escaped," Steve replied.
But it wasn't the glory of that autumn morning that etched that breakfast onto the memory of the three people bickering amiably in the penthouse kitchen, not even that it was the last moment of calm before the approaching storm, but that it was the last time that the three of them would eat breakfast there together.
Tony posed with his armoured foot on the body of the huge, bear-like creature that had been rampaging through the Seattle suburbs and tried to ignore the faintly green tinge visible where the light from the midday sun touched its charcoal-grey pelt. Also the information Jarvis was feeding into the HUD, which included a faint trace of modified gamma radiation.
"You left it in the SUV! Do you know how much it cost? It could be stolen, held for ransom, melted down for scrap..."
Besides, people were beginning to turn their heads to look at them, some with disapproving frowns, some with indulgent smiles. Tony wasn't sure which he hated most. So he took Pepper's hand and led her quickly – well as quickly as she could manage in those heels – out onto the balcony that embraced the window wall that almost circled the house, giving spectacular views of Long Island Sound and the lights of New York's towers in the far distance. They would still be in view from inside, but that was, in itself, a kind of protection.
"You're not invulnerable. Be careful, Tony. I'm beginning to suspect the rest of us are going to need you."
"Hawkeye and Widow, the stealth armour will transport you down once we've assessed the situation. Jarvis will be piloting. A-Jet2, once they're out go high into a holding pattern and wait for my call. And don't crash into A-Jet1."
Tony said, "Not so bad. The Hulk, along with Jan and Hank, saved the day, but he chased our enemies into a teleportation portal, presumably right into their filthy hands. The portal was destroyed behind him. We've heard nothing since." Not quite a lie. "We had to deal with a Hulk incursion," had been too vague to make anything of it here.
Tony jumped to his feet, ready to carry on the argument, but Steve caught his eye and shook his head at him. "Leave this to me," he mouthed.
"Steve, if I had contact with either Mr Stark or my digital clone I would tell you at once." Jarvis sounded as worried and distracted as Steve himself.
"So she asked me what I'd have said if I had gotten through to her, and I didn't actually remember – so I said I'd've thought of something—"
"You were asleep in the workshop at that time, sir. After that, there was no opportunity. The UN ambassadors had arrived and I was instructed to remain silent. After that you were out of contact. I assumed Captain Rogers had told you."
Tony frowned to himself. The name was familiar. Someone else had mentioned it and not that long ago. Wait! "She was one of the crew of that nut Richards' backyard rocket that exploded in orbit," Tony said.
"You don't get it, do you, Steve? One woman – admittedly probably an Asgardian witch – deactivated an ARC reactor with a word. How I survived is unimportant. We have dozens of big ARC reactors due to go live across the world, with new plants being built to meet expected demand. Unless I can find a way to neutralise her and her kind, that's a real threat, not just to my plans, but to everyone."
"That does not sound good," Barton said. "How come Jarvis wasn't uploaded to your private plane, Tony?"
Steve had just come back early from a run, persuaded to turn back by a gnawing apprehension that he put down to worry over Tony's safety. It wasn't logical, of course, and arriving back to find Tony unharmed and working, he hurried to take a much-needed cold shower.
Their destination was a palatial apartment where a tired and plainly worried Okoye was waiting for him. Her first words were to the point: "The portal?"
But that would leave Steve isolated in New York, and almost certainly in danger. And the one thing he was sure of was that Steve wasn't leaking information to SHIELD or anyone else, because Bruce's location was still secret, as were the results of Hank's research, and the repulsor and ARC and Iron Man tech were untouched. Steve hadn't even been unfrozen when SHIELD had first gained access to Stark Industries and the Malibu house, hadn't had any chance to communicate with SHIELD or anyone else on his way to Vicstar Field where Pepper, Happy and Hill had been waiting for them. Pepper, on the other hand, had hired Natalie Rushman, had been on first name terms with Coulson, had known about the Avengers, which might have been something he'd confided to her when he was so sick (but not that the Initiative had been cancelled), had spent most of Coulson's funeral and wake talking to Fury and Hill, had known about every single instance where he had been attacked, had probably leased the Arctic research ship to SHIELD, and had spent far too much time recently trying to get him to come to terms with the government...
Tony swung away. "So you're John Storm," he exclaimed, in what sounded like glee. "By the myriad tentacles of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, am I finally going to get to ask you who the hell would want to steal your dead sister's DNA?"
And then there was the Tower. Avengers Tower, apparently, if the Avengers were going to exist in the future.
"Tell me you didn't tell her that too?" Steve might be hopeless around women but Tony – well, he had thought Tony suave, charming and a bit of a lady-killer though a tad eccentric. It was beginning to look as if he was wrong.
Frigga smiled at him. "That my son would risk that wrath to save your life was enough to assure me that it was the right thing to do. Besides, Thor feels the loss of friends very deeply. I would not have him deal with that again, if it is within my power."
"Give me a moment," Steve said. The serum had done something to his memory, but it wasn't as if he could recall everything that had ever happened to him without effort. He concentrated, remembering. That conversation had taken place in the kitchen in the penthouse. Pepper had been cooking... "We were talking, about you, among other things. She said, 'He isn't willing to let go of you all anymore than he's willing to let go of Iron Man. What's more he's never liked SHIELD or Director Fury; keeping you, Natasha and Clint Barton off SHIELD's payroll is another way of thumbing his nose at both."
"One last thing:" Clint said, "Wakanda's apparently interested in you. That won't mean anything, I guess. We think Wakanda is based in East Africa – at least, its interests seem to be represented by Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda, though they're scared stiff of it and ain't talking. Best guess is that Wakanda is an enclave, kinda like Swaziland, or it's a tribe or a secret society. Maybe all three. There was something happening in East Africa – and by something I mean like Hulk or Thor something – around the time you were under attack by Hammer, Tony, but we didn't manage to get in, according to Coulson at any rate. Thanks for attending his funeral, by the way. That meant a lot to us. We'll be in touch again when we've got more info. Ciao."
Tony had tried to make light of Pepper's betrayal – if it really was a betrayal – but it must have been traumatic for both of them.
Morganti – if it was Morganti – made a note on the digital pad let into the wall beside the refrigerated unit, signed it, and left.
–  were huddled behind the receptionists' desk. If Jarvis dropped the shields they would all be perfectly safe, but it would leave the visiting civilians exposed and alert the intruders to his resources, which was the last thing he wanted to do right now.
Tony shot back. To the SHIELD agents he said, "You have a choice between putting down your weapons and surrendering to the Wakandan authorities or dying here and now. I'd make it fast if I were you."
Tony could not tell how they were reacting, because the world had darkened as the afternoon rainclouds were circling above on a rising wind. It didn't look... natural. Maybe the Panther god was getting annoyed and about time. Well, if the rain came it would calm them soon enough.
tells me what to do." It was a lie – Pepper had spent the last – eleven years and two months? – running his life, or those parts of it he didn't care much about. No longer. He snatched for self control, taking a moment's pause because Pepper's importance in his past life deserved the respect he hadn't given Rhodey. "It might be a good idea if you started looking for a base outside the Avengers part of this tower."
"He's asleep," Tony said, recovering from his surprise. "Tell me truthfully, Thor – is he going to recover? I mean fully recover?"
Tony felt his shoulders tense, though he tried to keep his voice steady. "Gee, and here was I thinking Iron Man was a national icon too. Or maybe an International Icon. But Captain Rogers is on the Avengers payroll, not on the Stark Industries payroll."
Which was probably true, but all he felt was relief that he could stay here with Steve and his bots. Sometimes he was amazed that Pepper's clothes were still in his suite in the tower, though, to be honest, she was no longer in his bed as often as she used to be, especially when he was. Well, he certainly couldn't face her tonight. "In that case, I'm going to nap down here while Jarvis orders us up some pizza. The usual for me, Jarvis. Steve?"
Tony needed to make it clear, and quickly, which side he was on. For a few moments he hesitated, unwilling, even now, to move against SHIELD. But there were both American and Wakandan lives to be saved and SHIELD had no place here.
