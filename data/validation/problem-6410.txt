Agatha nodded.  “I have confidence she did, but I will make certain.  While I quite enjoy Stephen’s rather…”  Her mouth pursed.  “Laissez faire attitude towards our shared discipline, Clea knows full well the long term effects of errors.  She will not risk it.”  She swept a hand up, and a shawl swirled into existence around her shoulders, floating into place with a flutter of fabric.  “Wanda, perhaps you should return to the council?”
"Right," Steve said, sinking down at the long, polished stone counter.  He set his cap down next to him on the stool to his right.  "French.  Got it."  He found himself smiling at nothing in particular.  "Of course Mr. Stark has a French chef."
Thor shook his head.  “Dance, I can, and have.  And would be pleased to show you how we dance in Asgard.  But the dances of which they speak-”  He waved a hand at the others.  “Of these, I am ignorant.”
“Yes, that’s…  That’s actually exactly what I’d heard,” she said, but she was smiling, wide and bright and real, and it took the sting out of the words.  “But he talks to you more than anyone else, so…”  Her smile faded, just a little, it was still there, but it seemed strained now.  A little uncertain.  “I don’t want to make things awkward, either, so I thought, maybe, if he has a significant other, or someone he’s seeing, and he’s keeping that private from the rest of the team, which, you know, that’s his right, but if that’s what’s happening, the person he’s most likely to have told is you.”
Bruce managed to smile back.  “Just fine.”  His eyes were locked on her skirts.  Tony didn’t blame him.  The fabric, if it could be called that, was moving in a very disconcerting way.  It was like a computer simulation that hadn’t been fed the right data, causing it to move in ways that didn’t quite obey the laws of physics, about to glitch out at any second.
Natasha sighed, her arms crossed over her chest.  “About two hundred deep, he decided that if he put enough Jell-O into the pool, he could make a gelatin trampoline out of it,” she said.
Rhodey shifted, his hands folded neatly on his flat stomach.  "Stop being lazy.  Fix the kid's kite."
Steve’s hand fell away from Tony as he took a step back, as if the physical distance could end the conversation.  “No orphanage in the city’d let a single cop adopt a kid,” he said, his voice tight.
DJ reached out, one little finger tapping the tip of Tony’s nose.  Tony wrinkled it up, scrunching his face into a squint, and DJ let out a giggle.   “Better?” Tony asked.
“Just write something up and put my signature on it, God, it’s like I have to do everything around here.”  Tony dug through the noodles with his fork, chasing a chunk of sausage.  “Jarvis?”  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Jarvis pause, looking in his direction.  Tony kept his head down.  “Thank you.”
"No, thank you, I'm not-"  He made a grab for his plate as Bobbi slipped it out of his hands.  "I don't need-"
“I don’t think I’m telling tales out of school to say that every member of this household was out of options when they reached this door.  Most had no funds, nowhere else to go.  This was the point of no return for almost all of us.
Tony let out a soft, sleepy sort of sound, his eyes half closed.  “Sorry.  Kind of...” He blinked, his hand falling to the dip of his flat stomach.  “Kind of out of it.”  His head lolled to the side, and he smiled up at Steve.  “I'll make it up to you in the morning.”
“It does.”  And with that, she was gone.  Tony took a deep breath and reached for his coffee cup.  He considered the cake.  “Jay, is it possible for pastry to look ominous?”
Bruce paused.  “Point taken,” he said.  He picked up a large box.  “Remember when Sitwell gave him a pack of 500 Pixie Sticks for his birthday?”
Frustrated, Steve headed up the hall, checking each door he passed, each window.  In some part of his head, he was counting steps, marking distances, looking for weaknesses.  He’d memorized the floorplan days ago, and his patrols kept his occupied, but there was little to be gained from them.
“I vote bigots,” Steve said, and he looked a little less like the living dead now.  A little less traumatized.  Tony was glad.
“Pretty sure that’s the porn parody Tony Stark,” Tony said, the words out of his mouth before he could stop them.  He looked at DJ, who was working his way through the whipped cream pile with alarming speed.  “Not that there’s-  I wouldn’t-”  He stopped.  “Do you-”
“Please tell her,” Tony said, with more patience than he was aware that he possessed, “to get on the elevator.  And Jarvis will bring her to the right floor.”
“No,” Tony said, frowning down at his phone.  “The singing’s normal.  The outfit, though?  You should be worried about the outfit.”
“It's the cross I have to bear,” Luke agreed.  “You put me in black, and I'm going to be deeply disappointed in you, Jan.”
Steve looked at his mother, who was watching him, her cheek balanced on her palm, smiling at him.  “Are there fairies in America?” he asked.
“Steve will veto,” DJ said, and he could hear Val giggling, even though she had both hands clapped over her mouth.  Franklin was just rolling his eyes, because he was too cool for this, or so he kept telling them.
“The world is confusing and people don’t make sense,” Steve mused.  “He and I, we’re just trying to figure it out.”
"What, you don't frolic?" he asked, wiping his hands on a rag.  "You ought to give it a try.  All the best people are.”
“No, I have the most amazing idea for a deconstructed mimosa,” Tony said, and Steve buried his face in Tony’s shoulder, laughing out loud.  Grinning at the ceiling, Tony stroked his hair, letting his fingers linger there, loving the familiar pressure of Steve’s body against his.  “Want to know what’s in it?”
“It was a stepping stone, back then.  For the cooks who couldn't afford a real place, or couldn't find a landlord willing to rent to them.  You drove a truck to save up for a proper place.”  Isaiah shook his head.  “Now we got a bunch of white boys serving ramen tacos to stockbrokers for twice the price you'd pay for a whole meal at a proper diner.”
“And I think he likes me, we shoot hoops sometimes, and Jess convinced him to play badminton with us-”
“Oh, I couldn't, one doesn't call one's betters by their first name, me Ma'd be rolling over in her grave,” Happy declared, and just like that, he was maneuvering Hammer through the crowd with an admirable sort of grace. In a minute, they were absorbed by the crowd and gone.
“After all, they were offering me a position that included room and board.  I could save almost every cent they paid me.  We were used to lean meals and cold rooms, and I couldn’t imagine what we’d have at Stark Manor would be any worse than what we’d manage on our own.”  She nodded.  “I calculated.  How long we’d have to stay, before I thought we could survive on our own.
"Sir, you have company," Jarvis announced, his voice brisk.  Rogers slipped through, an expression of surprise washing over his face.
“Oh for Christ's sake!” Morrison said, his face twisted into an expression of disgust. “Have you no shame?”
Trip smiled, and Steve took a deep breath, his chest aching.  “May your love lead you ever on, may it provide a safe harbor in turbulent seas, may it provide warmth in the depths of winter, and may it be the light that guides you home in the darkest night.”
“I...  Didn't?” he said, and Jan narrowed her eyes at him, her little mouth set in a scowl.  Steve blinked, suddenly not at all sure.  Maybe he had been doing that.  “Sorry?”
“He absolutely was,” Pepper said to Rhodey, her chin braced on his breastbone.  “He was-”  She made her eyes huge, fluttering her eyelashes.  “He did the thing.”
“Yeah,” Steve said, a little breathless. “I like your blanket, too.” He shifted Tony to the side, grabbing a random piece of dark cloth. “Give me a second, and I'm going to take it back off of you.”
“Well, yes, you set this up, you-” Tony waved a hand back at the soundstage. “This certainly wasn't my idea, buster, and now we're going to be dealing with press requests for the next year or so, really, what was that, that was just-”
“Well.” Bobbi’s head tipped to the side.  “I never said I was smart.  Besides, The Kingpin’s a fair man,” she said.  “Prone to acts of unbelievable violence.  Possibly insane.  But mostly, fair.   And uninterested in his people’s private lives or histories, as long as they were loyal and made him money.”
Rhodey clapped a hand over his mouth to muffle his laughter.  “In my defense, random rich white men are not to be trusted where I come from.”
“One second, Jay,” Tony said, crossing to the sink.  He turned it on and stuck his head under the sink faucet, the cold water enough of a shock to make him swear.  But it also cleared his aching head, even as it numbed his face.  He pulled back, gasping for breath as the water rolled over his face.  “Right.  Okay.  Better.” He swallowed.  “Morning, Jarvis.”
“I refuse to add to the hipster aesthetic of this scene,” Tony asked, waving a hand at the room at large.  “Your converted warehouse Brooklyn apartment.  Your secondhand couch.  Your sourdough bread and handmade preserves and your books of 19th century poetry and your-” He plucked at the blanket that was draped over his hips.  “Your vintage afghan.”
He stopped, gave his head a quick shake.  “I say stupid things,” he said.  “All the time.”  He looked at Steve.  “So what was that about?”
“This may come as a shock to you, Clint, but SHIELD has a vested interest in keeping tabs of StarkIndustries assets,” Phil said.  “Because when Stark inevitably goes off the grid, it’s easier to track one of his planes than it is to track him.”
"He sustained a series of hairline fractures throughout his system," Bruce said.  "So he looks bad."  His eyes fluttered, hard and fast. "His body is focusing on fixing the worst of it, there's an internal triage going on, he's protecting his core, his organs, his skeleton are getting the attention.  The surface stuff, it, uh, it looks bad, but it's all surface."
“Because I do, I have many, many things that I'd rather be doing,” he said, striding up the hallway.  He was pretty sure he was trailing ribbon in his wake and he was pretty sure he didn't care.  “There's, there's so many things that I'd rather be doing, and-”
“Mostly cause he knew that,” Happy said, bracing a foot on the edge of the kitchen table, rocking his chair onto its back legs. “Hell, everyone knew that.”
Steve wasn’t really sure why they were talking about Pepper, but he nodded anyway.  “She’s good at it.”
Tucking the empty bottle under one arm, he pried the cigar free from the arrowhead, brushing loose tobacco free from the gleaming tip  “Look at that,” he mused, his head tipping to the side.  He rolled the shaft between his finger and thumb, letting the light play across the metal arrowhead.  “See that?”  He flicked it towards the head of the mob, who flinched back.  “The barbs?  They make a real mess of whatever they go into, you know.  They bite in deep, and when you take it out…”
His fingertips tingled, and he realized that his hands were flexing at his sides, spastic, uncontrolled movements.  They formed fists, the bones straining with the force of it, and then went lax, twitching against his legs, against his chest, against his face.
Tony took a step forward before he turned back towards Steve, one hand reaching him.  “Welcome home,” he said, and Steve caught his fingers.
“Why in the name of all that’s holy am I awake?” Tony asked.  Steve was still laughing, his face buried in the back of Tony’s shoulder. Tony reached back, trying to pat his hair with a clumsy hand.  “I do not want to be awake.”
“Can we not talk about it?” Tony rolled over, his back to Steve for a second, and Steve set his file aside.  Tony's shoulders were set and tight.  “Just...  Just once, can we not talk about things, can I just...”
With a pleased sound, Nat rolled to her feet and crossed the room, snagging Tony by the back of the shirt when he attempted to inch his way to the door again.  “Do not make me get the restraints.”
Steve let his eyes shut.  Took a deep breath, and then another.  “I’m going to ask Tony out,” he said, and that was the first time he had acknowledged that plan out loud.  He waited, his chest tight, for a sense of doom, for world to punish him for that.  For wanting something he couldn’t have.
“Has he been on the internet?” Tony asked, and he knew the answer before he even asked the question.
"Because 'marriage' has a very specific meaning for a lot of people,” Joy said. “And this arrangement might be acknowledged as legal by some entities-”
Sam ignored him.  “Jan roped a bunch of our teammates into it, but you were late and I had a counseling session that I couldn’t just ditch,, so the session had already started by the time we got there, and instead of interrupting them, we just decided to shoot some hoops.”
He slid off his stool, darting over to the tool chest.  An instant later, he turned around, the socket wrench held in one hand.  Tony grinned at him.  "Yes," he said, and DJ grinned back, his face going pink with something like pleasure, or maybe relief.  Tony held out a hand, and DJ bounced across the floor to give it to him.  Tony grabbed an old plan and flipped it over, spreading it blank side up over the workbench.  He grabbed a pencil.  "Socket wrench," he said, writing the words out in simple block printing, then tracing around the contours of the tool.  DJ boosted himself up, peering over the edge of the bench, his dark eyes bright.
Steve set his thumb on the edge of the cap and flicked it free, and the soda immediately gushed from the neck, white foam splashing over his knuckles.  Cursing, Steve dropped his mouth to the neck of the bottle, trying to catch as much as he could before it ended up on his sketchbook.  Bubbles went up his nose, and he coughed, soda overflowing his lips.
Tony paused, dusting flour from his hands, and realized that Peter was staring at him, his face hopeful.  “What?” he asked.  “Why are you asking me?  I’m not making it.”
Beyond the shelter of the tree’s branches, the wind kicked up, and the branches swayed, leaves floating down to land on his head.  He reached up, picking one out of his hair.  “I suppose that’s as close as I’ll get to tears,” he said, rolling the stem between his finger and thumb.  He tucked it into his pocket, and turned his attention to dinner.
“Glad to hear it.” She handed Steve the other cup, considering the tabletop.  “Well.  Not a bad job.”
“They're making a kite, I'm sure nothing will end up on fire.” She paused, her brow furrowing.  “Unless they try to strap an engine to it.”
“Because I’m terrified that you’re going to end up with a bullet in your head,” Obie said, blunt about it, and everyone went still.
Tony's head came up, squinting at Steve.  “Alarm,” he said, and it was adament.  “Al-”  The word trailed away, and Steve pressed a kiss to his forehead.
“I know, I didn’t think he liked hockey,” she said, her head tipping to the side, her eyes narrowing, “maybe he does, or maybe it’s just-” She made an ‘I don’t know’ gesture, half shrug, half wave.  “Sports?”
Ignoring his misgivings, Steve reached for the door.  A bell rang as he pushed it open, but it was almost drowned out by the creaking of the hinges.  Steve stepped inside, letting it swing shut behind him.  “Hello?” he asked, dusting his hand off on his hip.  The doorknob had been even dirtier than he’d thought it would be.  “Are you open?”
“Because when you-” Tony stressed the word, “Antagonize the guard, then they take that personally.  They come back.  Over and over.  To ‘keep an eye on you.’”  He tossed a ledger into the box, and covered that up with a few pieces of broken mechanisms.  “What I did?  I fixed his watch, I smiled at him, and I sent him safely, and politely, on his way.”
Steve kissed him again, and Tony knew he was only doing it to distract him, and he didn't care.  “Come with me,” Steve whispered.
“Steve's in my bed,” Tony repeated, the words forced out from between set teeth.  “How the fuck do you think I am?”
“Right.  Do we have plans for either of our captives?” Clint asked, his arms crossed over his chest.  Natasha gave him a look, and he shrugged.  “Look, I’m fine with hiding a body, but I’d like some time to figure out where we’re dumping it.”
Seemingly satisfied with that, DJ took Mrs. Parker’s hand and gave them both a wave.  A moment after they left the room, Furbro stood, stretched, and jumped down off the bed, padding after them with a flick of his tail.
Sam’s head tipped forward, and he looked up at Steve from under the line of his eyebrows.  “Right,” he said, his voice quiet.  “What just happened here?” he asked.
She shrugged.  “Because everyone else asks questions,” she pointed out.  “I call you, I call Jane, I call Thor, even if I call Harris, everyone-” She spread her hands.  “Everyone asks questions.  I call Clint, and say, ‘I need you to come pick me up, right now,’ and the only thing he asks is ‘where are you?’”
“Hi,” Trip said, and a pair of dark, unblinking eyes peered at her from under the hood of the sweatshirt.  She smiled, and the kid smiled back, shoulders hunched under the weight of the fabric.
“She’s never bothered with the lobby before, so it’s hard to say if she’s developed a fondness for it,” Tony said.  Across the workbench, Bruce was subtly trying to gather up his things.  Tony pointed a finger at him, and Bruce froze.  It didn’t last long.  Tony frowned at him.  “No.”
“I’ll see if I can’t find you a small glass of something more palatable,” Jarvis said.  He smiled down at DJ.  “I made DJ a cup of warm milk with chocolate melted into it.  It might not be much, but it certainly seemed to be appreciated.”
Steve stopped, his mouth pursing.  "Do we not tell our dates what things cost in this modern world?" he asked.
“Let’s go,” Bobbi said, and though she addressed the group, she was looking directly at Steve, her eyes sharp.
Tony stared down at the...  Thing that was wandering around his library floor.   It was a tangled mop of brownish orange fur, and judging by the way it was moving, it was probably a quadruped.  It had something like a tail, a fluffy banner that fluttered in the creature's wake, a distinct kink halfway up its length.
“Oh.”  DJ blinked at him, slow and careful, and he was older, he was not the small child Harris remembered any more, but that motion, the slow, precise way he blinked, that was familiar.  “This isn’t…  What I meant at all.”
“And neither does Rhodey, but that's two in like, twenty.  I know more of his dating history than you do,” Jan pointed out.  “Tony already likes Steve, everyone likes Steve, now we just have to set Steve up as-”
"I mean, we could've, but actually checking invitations at the door is so gauche," Tony said.  As everyone laughed again, he gave them a polished grin.  "Easier to elope than deal with that."
“And he’s going to make sure of it,” Sam said, offering her a piece of heavy, dark bread and a thick slice of cheese.  She took it, grumbling under her breath.  Sam grinned as he sliced another piece free and tossed it to Bucky, who caught it without even looking up.  “Bucky, she’s going to stab you, and no one’s gonna stop her.”
“We’re very different people, you and I,” she said, laughter audible in the words.  “I do it because I can, and Tony pays for it.”
Ellen studied the timeline.  “Stark's never managed to keep a relationship quiet for more than a few weeks,” she said.  She walked to the beginning, tapping each face as she passed.  “Most of them, it was public in a matter of days.”
“The people who need to believe already do.”  Nicholas smiled.  “T’Challa’s missive didn’t reach me unopened.  And I’m sure my reply was more public than I would’ve liked as well.  Which is why I met with Wilson in person to assign him to go and fetch you.”  He paused, his eye cutting in Sam’s direction.  “You were slow, by the way.”
“A bit,” Steve admitted.  He yawned, one of his hands coming up to cover one of Tony’s.  “You’re the one who woke me up in the middle of the night, stole my shirt, and started invading my privacy.”
“The damn greenhouse,” she agreed, as they ducked through the doors and down the stairs to the kitchen.  It was quiet and still now, a pot of coffee on a back burner and a napkin covered basket the only sign of the chaos to come in the morning.  Bobbi paused, just long enough to fish a scone from the basket, tossing one to Steve and taking one for herself.
“Happy’s off getting a drink,” Tony said, ruffling DJ’s hair.  “Do you want to stay with the other boys?” he asked, and DJ nodded.  “Then we’ll go with Steve and the others, and meet you at the end of the movie.”
“Let’s go,” he said, heading up the road with his usual broad stride, the flasks rattling with each step.
“Do not lose her,” Tony repeated, and hung up before Clint could tell him what he do with that request.  But judging by the sound of his text notifications kicking in, Clint wasn’t letting him have the last word.  Tony found that comforting, for some reason.
“Just so we're clear,” Tony said, and he didn't know how to end that, so he just gave a firm nod and headed for the gym.
Tony sucked in a breath, his white teeth clenched beneath tight lips.  “I need your help,” he repeated.
Harris stared, confused, as the Roomba rotated and floated right back where it had come from.  Another bump, another rotation, and he realized, something, or someone was pushing it.  Nudging it.  The way he did.  And the Roomba just kept going right back.
“And we all knew what I meant, what I was referring to, so I don't see what the difference my word choice really makes,” Morrison said. “It was implied, and you're-”
“But it won’t” Tony sing-songed at her, bracing his free hand on his hip.  She skipped to the side, trying without success to find the right stone to step on.  Tony grinned.  “Jan.  It only works for me.”
“I believe this conversation was something of a relief to him,” Jarvis said, his voice soft.  “And he has not slept well in some time.”
"All would agree, there were none less likely," Thor said, swinging Mjolnir idly from hand to hand.  Everyone scooted their chairs away from him.  He didn't seem to notice.
Tony’s eyes canted downwards, a wicked smile curling his lips, and Steve felt his face heat.  “Trust me,” he said, his voice a low, warm purr, “I noticed.”
“It's not for anyone,” Steve said, giving him a stern look.  “It's-” The camera flash went off, and gritted his teeth against the impulse to hide behind the poinsettia's spreading leaves.  “It was on sale.”
“You leading or following?” Luke asked Steve.  Steve stared at him.  “You...  Gotta figure that out.  You know that right?”
He stayed where he was, letting the others leave the room ahead of him, and before he followed them, he looked over at May.  She gave him a smile and a slight nod, and it hurt to return the gesture.  Then he was out the door, pulling it shut behind him.
“We've checked the other bedrooms,” Pepper said.  “We keep most of them locked, but we've checked them all.  We thought he might've gone down to the library, or the billiard room-”
"Let's be honest, we all know it was gonna happen," Clint said, unconcerned.  He sat back down, straddling his chair and folding his arms on the back.  "It was less the money and more owning it."
For the first time, Tony seemed to hear him, his steps staggering to a halt.  Steve let out a frustrated breath.  “You are going to be a handful, aren't you?” he said, steering Tony back towards the bed.  “It's the middle of the night, what are you doing?”
Harris took a deep breath.  “Right,” he said.  “So, and I’m just trying to make sure that I understand where you’re coming from here, DJ, okay?  So you think that you being here, that the reason any of this happened, is because you’d been thinking about that email?”
Jarvis gave him a look.  “No, but it sustained you more than once.  A slice of bread and a cup of milk was enough, even in this house.”
“Thor’s got a tray of them,” Steve said.  Halfway to the door, he stopped, and Sam almost walked into his back.  “Napkins?”
“I'm very optimistic,” she said, and it was the most Russian she'd ever sounded, the words flat and utterly without intonation.
"Close enough," Stark said.  "I want an even number of people at my table, Jan, and you made this mess, you can fix it."
May these whispers, as small and weak and disjointed as they are, make things a little easier for you, when ever you find them.
“Right.”  Steve headed for the sink, grabbing a dish towel from the drawer.  “You’re a bit messier than usual.  Wanna tell me what happened?”
Steve looked up.  “I imagine so, and a crying shame it is, too,” he said.  He smiled, just a little.  “You shouldn't have to pretend here.  This-”  He waved a hand at the room. “This is your home, isn't it?  I'm the interloper.”  He shook his head.  “No point in pretending for me.”
A spike of guilt shot through him, and Steve turned on the sink, splashing water on his face and neck.  He caught a glimpse of his face in the mirror as he straightened up, and there was something haunted in his expression, a hollow, empty look to his eyes.  He looked away, reaching for his pants.
Tony pushed himself upright, his hands braced on Steve’s chest, and that was nice, that was so nice.  “I’m getting my fucking flowers back.”
“Forgive me.” Jarvis took the seat, his hands folded neatly in his lap.  “I find it difficult to dispense with the niceties, no matter how much sense that would make.”
“Excuse me?” Tony asked as Steve burst into laughter.  Tony tossed a pillow at him without even looking in his direction, and Steve ducked under it.  “Where the hell is this sass coming from?”
Steve took a deep breath.  “He's sick,” he said, because DJ needed the facts most of all.  He needed calm. As long as Steve stayed calm, hopefully DJ would stay calm. “He's at my place, because he's sick.  I'm going to take care of him until he feels better, so he's not alone.  He's going to be fine.  But right now?”  He gave DJ a smile.  “He's sick, and he fell asleep.”
Tony shuddered, heat sweeping over him. “I'm going to start taking clothes off now,” he said, his voice measured and even. “Maybe yours. Maybe mine. Don't know. Don't care. As long as someone ends up naked, and I get touching privileges.”
Pepper exhaled, and it was a sigh, he knew it was a sigh, but she was doing her best to cover it.  Tony appreciated that.  "Tony.  I can't stop you."  She spread her hands.  "We both know I can't stop you-"
Laughing, Steve pulled his hand back.  “Fine,” he mumbled into his pillow.  “See if I try to check on you  again, you ungrateful ass.”
Tony looked at the kid, who was looking around the interior of the plane with an expression of faint curiosity.  “Never have,” he said.
She gave his arm one last squeeze, and stepped back.  “Pepper, how do you LIVE with him?” she asked.
She nodded.  "Came out to tell you, that window of yours is creaking again."  Her eyes slanted up towards the ceiling that separated their apartments.  "Best you check it's closed tight tonight, else you'll hear of it, wasting the heat and all."
“More important, you think there’s even a chance that you’re in danger, drop the phone and run for it,” Steve said.  “Understand?”
Which was different.  Comforting.  Harris didn’t dismiss him out of hand.  Didn’t give him empty words and ignore what he was saying.  Harris just sat there, his glasses crooked on his nose, his hair sticking up.  DJ dug his toes into the carpet, his hands braced on the edge of the table.
“I got up to get a drink of water, and, uh, the Ancient One here was waiting for me just outside the bedroom door,” Harris said.  He rubbed a thumb behind the cat’s ear, and it let out a rusty growl of a purr. “I figured that it wanted pets.  So.” He shrugged.  “I’m not good for much, but I sure can pet a cat.”
“We could, but we're not going to,” Steve said.  He pointed at the screen.  “How much time does he spend shirtless?”
“It's not, and I'm sorry, I should've-”  Steve shook his head.  “I should've realized.  But I never-”  He rubbed a hand over his head.  “Your place was closer and better and-”
Steve took her hand with care, all too aware of the fact that his hand was probably filthy.  But her grip was firm and strong, her small fingers squeezing his without a flinch.  "Ma'am," he said, some of the tension going out of his shoulders.
Tony turned his head, pressing his lips against the hollow of Steve’s palm.  “I do,” he whispered, the words dropped like a kiss against Steve’s skin, and Steve felt a tear roll down his cheek.  Tony looked up at him, and he was grinning, his whole face lit with the warmth of it.  “I do.”
He raised a hand in a vague wave before throwing the fridge door open and leaning into it.  “Hey, Carol?”
There was a moment of silence, then Tony said, “So you’re looking at this wrong, botbrain.  You’re not the reason for the fight.  You’re the reward.  Every time we have a…  Creative disagreement-”
Harris and Tony both turned in their seats to look back at him.  “What?” Tony asked, as the light turned green.
“Glad I could be of service,” Steve said.  “And does that mean the door’s going to be unlocked from now on?”
“You’re barefoot,too,” Tony pointed out, but he let Steve pick him up, looping his arms around Steve’s neck.  “I’m humoring you,” he said, as he tucked his cheek against Steve’s shoulder.
Jarvis’ lips twitched, the smallest little flicker of amusement crossing over his face.  “Because you do.”  Tony snorted in disdain, and Jarvis gave him a look.  “You might be able to fool the others,” he said, a faint barb to the words, “but I’ve known you from the time you were in short pants, and despite how much time you spend denying it, you do have a plan.”
“Why do I care about the opinions of anyone in this room?” Tony asked.  “You’re all wrong, and I think that’s what matters.  DJ?  Do you believe in me?”
“I think a good American boy like yourself’ll be just fine.”  She saluted him with her cup before she set it back on the table.  “No matter what.”
DJ smiled.  “I can leave now,” he said.  His fingers plucked at the edge of the cup’s lid, pushing it up and almost off before shoving it back down.  “If I want to.”  He looked back at the window, the tension in his shoulders relaxing a little.  “But yes.  It’s home.”  He looked back at Fury.  “Or something like it, I guess?”
"In honor of our young guest, Mrs. Parker has made strawberry shortcake," Jarvis said.  To DJ, he explained, “It's one of her specialties.  Quite good.”
She turned around fast enough to catch the look of shock on Steve's face, and a smile broke over her face.  “Calling in the troops,” she said, crossing to the pantry door.  A moment later she emerged, a bowl of eggs braced on one hip and a basket of potatoes in her other hand.
"I do not like this word," Clint said, staring at the ceiling of the elevator.  "That's a bad word.  Jarvis, what the fuck?"
"Oh, really?  You don't know what I'm talking about?"  Sam made a humming sound under his breath, his body rocking backwards as he crossed his arms over his chest.  "Maybe the 'jumping out of a plane without a parachute' thing?  Or the 'trying to stop a car with your body' thing?  Or the 'trying to punch a demi-god' thing?"
“And he loves you, so, he'll show up,” Pepper said.   She set the tablet down, resting her hands on either side of it.  “Tony.  Please don't take this the wrong way-”
Steve took a breath, and it looked like it hurt, it sounded like it hurt.  “Sit here,” he said, his voice reedy and thin.    “On, on the bed, and-”  His voice trailed away, leaving Tony to fill in the blanks.
Peter snagged the page out of the air.  “Don’t listen to him,” he said to DJ, who was watching the whole exchange, a grin on his face.  “Math is very interesting.  Not as interesting as science-”
Jan fell into step beside him, her feet flying over the polished floor of the hallway.  “Tony.  He's fine, and-”
“And instead of doing that, he took my money and made the shirts I was hoping to never see again into something that’s going to live on my couch forever,” Phil said.
Steve wrapped an arm around his shoulders, and Tony let his head fall onto Steve’s shoulder with a groan.  “Whoever told you that was lying,” Steve said, pressing a kiss to Tony’s hair.  “Maliciously.”  Tony groaned again, long and pained, and Steve smiled against his hair.  “You did good, Stark.”
She nodded.  “I think you just might be right.”  She extended a hand to him.  “No promises.  But I'll look for your boy.”
He stepped forward, one foot slicing through the fog of dust and smoke that covered the floor, and it hit with the sound of metal on stone.  “You move.”
“Uh, I’m okay,” Bruce said, retrieving a bowl of leftover pasta from the fridge.  “A little too rich for me.”
“I never got the chocolate sauce out of that shirt,” Darcy said.  She snapped her fingers.  “How about the guy having a heart attack at the movie theater?”
Without looking up from his pan, Clint snagged a turnover and tossed it to Steve, who snagged it one handed out of the air.  “Because you’re finally making progress.”
“They say money.  I…  Don’t think it is,” the kid said, the words slow.  Careful.  He met her eyes.  “It’s not.  But they say it is.”
“Never mind.” Tony dug his pencil into the page, wanting to wrap his fingers around it and stab, as if the fragile lead tip could do more than break against the wood of his desk.  As if wielding it like a knife could provide some measure of control or protection.  “Never-”
Steve burst out laughing.  "No, you don't like the rain?" he asked.  “Or no, you're not coming out?”
“I grew up in literally the same building as you, and your Ma was as normal a lady as I ever met, so I’m guessing you’re just naturally a little punk.  You might finally be bigger than me, but you’re still a little punk, Rogers.”
Clint just shrugged.  “They started it.” He flipped his bow around, snagging it with picture perfect timing.  “I'm just finishing it.”  He slung it over his shoulder.  “Don't let 'em see it hurts you, Cap, or they'll just keep doing it.”
Steve shook his head, settling back on the couch.  "This is the worst thing I've ever seen," he said, but he was grinning at the screen.  "Where did they get horses?"
“This is absolutely true.”  Steve threw his arm around Clint's shoulders.  “Come on.  Let's go have a nice, leisurely breakfast.”
“Waking Steve,” Jarvis said, with such perfect timing that Tony wished that he it was possible to punch his AI.  He could probably go downstairs and punch a server or something, but doing that in a towel was just asking for trouble.
Tony's eyebrows arched.  “What, about the sex stuff?”  He huffed out a breath.  “Pretty sure that's my line, Cap.  You didn't ask for this.”
“I’m not going to hack the fountains,” Tony said, and DJ muffled a giggle in his folded arms.  “And if you three don’t zip it, we’re going to turn this car right around and go back to the airport.”
“Tell her that you're a charming ass, and you can take 'no' for an answer,” Steve said.  The door to the hotel flew open, and Sam stumbled out, swaying on his feet as he glared at the sunny sky.  Steve waved to him.  “Sam's alive.”
“You keep telling yourself that,” Tony told her as Jess peeked around her shoulder.  “Morning, Drew.”
He reached for the hat that was hanging on the back of his chair.  “The King’s Ball is in just over two month’s time,” he said. “Which is, of course, why the Wakandan delegation is entering the city.  They won’t be the only ones.  By that point, I will be expected to name an heir.”  He looked at Steve.  “Things’ll be coming to a head, very soon.”
“I don’t see why,” Steve said, turning the page of his book.  “Clint’s snoring doesn’t bother me much and Darcy seems like a trustworthy sort.”
Harris’ hand came up, fumbling at the pocket of his coat for an embarrassingly long time before he managed to get a grip on it.  “I-”
Bruce pulled his glasses off, polishing them on the hem of his untucked shirt.  “He should be fine,” he said with a slight smile.  His eyes darted amongst them, blinking rapidly.  “Head injuries are tricky, but it looks worse than it is.”
Johnny twisted his head to the side as best he could.  “Are you the bouncer?” he asked Steve with a grin.
“Jarvis, that’s how you live your entire life,” Bobbi said, folding her arms on the banister.  “I’m fairly certain that that’s your family crest.”
Satisfied, Hank went back to his work.  “The City Guard is fine.”  He reached for a knife.  “Mostly.  It’s the King’s Elite you should be watching out for.”
Tony reached for his coffee cup.  “To recap.  Chefs of New York.  Stop being fucking lazy.  Diners of New York. Stop being fucking racist.”  He saluted the camera with his cup.  “And we’ll all get fat and happy and probably die of clogged arteries because goddamn, kale is still fucking nasty and if I hear the word ‘superfood’ one more fucking time I’m going to clock someone in the back of the head with a frying pan, Bugs Bunny style.
“I like it,” Steve admitted.  “It’s…  It’s nice.”  Which was a very vague way of dealing with his very complicated feelings.  “But it’s not like any of his others, so I was…  Concerned.”
He reached out, his fingertip ghosting over the tip of DJ’s nose.  “They’ll believe you are doing everything you can, and sometimes, it’s just…”  His voice trailed away.
Harris made a pained sound, and Tony reached out, catching his belt, and shoving him towards the chair.  He dropped like a stone.  “It certainly would,” Tony said to Darcy, who was poking at the front of her shirt.  The fake arc reactor they’d found at the costume shop was visible through the fabric.  “Stop fussing with it.”
“And he didn’t stay there,” Tony said.  He waved at Jarvis over his shoulder.  “Do me a favor.  Make dinner?”
“How long?” Tony asked, and Steve stopped.  Tony leaned in.  “How long?”  Steve opened his mouth, and Tony’s hand shot up, his index and middle fingers pressing against Steve’s lips.  “Don’t answer that. Don’t-”  He leaned in.  “Kiss me.”
“He’ll be here soon enough,” Jarvis said, busy slicing bread at the sideboard.  He glanced up, bread knife held easily in one hand.  “And to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit, sir?”
“We can burn them,” Tony agreed.  He nodded against Steve’s shoulder.  “I’m fully in favor of this.”
Steve shoved his hands into the flowing water, splashing his face.  “Nope,” he repeated.  Bucky made a disbelieving sound, and Steve caught himself grinning.  “Not right now.”
But when the started down the aisle, Steve felt the last of the tension leaving him, dissipating like fog in the wind.  Outside, the chapel had seemed cheap, and run down, but on the inside, it was warm and cozy, light flowing in from high, arched windows.  The aisle lead up to the front of chapel, where Trip waited behind a lectern, and rows of white wood chairs flanked each side of the small room.  Clint and Tony were on one side, and Harris on the other, all of them looking back and smiling.
Harris watched them go, trying not to grin.  Darcy, for her part, just leaned her chin on the top of the cafeteria case, looking sadly at the fruit cup.  “Give it up,” Harris told her, poking through the ‘grab and go’ containers of sandwiches.
"Really.  I'm not going to ask what you're basing that on.  But...”  Tony squinted at the 'cat.'  “No taste for human blood?" Tony asked him, trying to keep a straight face.  DJ shook his head.  "Really?  None at all?"
“He’s young, he’ll accept it one of these days.”  Bobbi flicked a hand in Steve’s direction.  “Did he get one?”
“My point being, most people here could carry me and any box I choose to pick up, so I'm just going to avoid that humiliation and stay here,” Sam said.  “Keeping tabs.  Keeping everything running.”
The tendril snapped straight at him, and he released the light that he’d been holding, coiled tight against his palm, and it went off like a firework.  “As far away from here as I can get!” he yelled, and his hand latched onto the strap of his backpack.
“They call him the Nomad,” Bobbi said, and it took everything he had not to flinch.  “A big, broad man.  Seldom speaks.  Fights like a demon, but never kills.  Occasionally, he’s reported to have a knife, never a gun.  Always-” She reached out, running a fingertip along the rim of the shield.  “A shield.”
Despite what Miss Potts had said, the kitchen was well lit, warm and smelling of coffee and yeasty dough.  The counter was spread with stacks of ledgers and files, a tea pot resting beside the largest pile, steam curling from the spout.  Steve glanced around.  "I think you're safe," he said, making Miss Potts laugh.
He ducked his head, his lips ghosting over Steve's throat, and Steve made a sound that was straight out of his hottest dreams. “Now,” he whispered against Steve's jaw, “if you want to spend the next hour making out back here, that's just fine with me.” His eyes flicked up to meet Steve's. “Really. That's just fine.”
“I've been yelled at by all and sundry already today,” Tony said, his teeth clicking around each word.  “So if you've got opinions on this situation that I won't particularly like, I can pencil you in for Tuesday, or Thursday if you want to do a pre-breakfast meeting.”
And he absolutely didn’t miss that.  Tony took a long sip of his coffee, letting it burn all the way down the length of his throat.  No.  He didn’t miss that at all.
“Because that’s what it cost to fulfill every single outstanding Christmas ‘Adopt-a-Family’ request that was on file with the Maria Stark Foundation,” Tony said.  He dropped his hand back to his side.  “He bought everything.  On every.  Single.  Request.”
Ty leaned back in his chair.  “They realized my latest papers aren’t up to my usual standards,” he said with a wry twist to his lips.  “Almost like someone else wrote them.”
“Mine stayed on the rack,” Tony said, watching as DJ and Rogers loaded up the trunk.  He shook his head. “I rented a car.  And it looks like I’m going to have to rent another.” He tossed the back door of the car open with a theatrical gesture.  “Keep mouthing off, Mini-Me, and it’s going to be a minivan, and you’re going in the trunk.”
“Jan!” Steve made a grab for her, and she danced around him staying just out of reach.  “Give me-  There's nothing wrong with my clothes!”
Tony nodded again.  “This was the first time you were taken away.  And it took me a while to find you, to bring you back where you belonged.  It was the first time you were alone.  It was the first time you were...”  He tried to smile.  “You were forgotten.”
“Why did you bring it back in?” Tony asked, wondering if he could stand up straight.  He decided not to risk it.  “Parker.”
“Well, now I do,” Steve said, meeting Carol’s eyes.  She was turning red, and he grinned.  “Are you…  Are you BLUSHING, Danvers?”
There was a long moment of silence, as he just studied Steve, his face unreadable.  Finally, his chin dropped a fraction of an inch, the barest hint of a nod.  “Welcome home, Captain.”
“Every time I open my eyes and you're there, next to me, sleeping or reading or scowling at your phone because some vendor got above himself-”
“How long have you known?  Who’s your doctor?  What’s the diagnosis?” Tony asked, and he was frowning for some reason, his face tight, his eyes sharp beneath the hard line of his brows.  “I should’ve known.”
Teeth flashed, bright and white, and the man reached up, pushing his hood back.  “You always were a clever one, Wilson.”  He pushed himself to his feet, drawing himself up to his full height.  He was tall and broad, with square shoulders and a steady stance.  One eye was covered by an eyepatch, scar tissue extending from beneath the black silk.  He was bald, a neat beard framing his stern mouth.
Duck pulled off his glasses.  “Ellen.”  He leaned forward.  “You're a good reporter.  You've got good instincts, and good sense, but for this-”
"Even if I did, I don't think anyone here'd bother to obey it," Rogers said.  Behind him, Tony heard the heavy, measured tread of his feet towards the workshop door.  He didn't bother to look up, or back.
Sam smiled.  “So, you're not the 'friendzoned' asshole,” he said, his voice gentle.  “You value Tony's friendship.  It's not something you're using to get him in bed.  You're not manipulating him, not trying to pressure him.  You're just...  Showing him that he can't do any better, honestly.”
He fell silent, listening intently.  “See, Phil agrees with you, just get it done.” He nodded.  “He’s pragmatic.” His eyes caught Phil’s, and he grinned.  “Goal-oriented.  That’s your son.  Get it over with, and stop worrying about it.”
Natasha glanced in his direction, her spoon never slowing.  “This is almost enough to replace the pies you ate yesterday,” she said, considering the fruit.
“Why?” Tony echoed.  He reached for the wine bottle, filling first his glass, and then the other one.  “So many reasons.  But mostly…”  He set the bottle back down.  “Do you think the war’s over?”
“Diiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiie,” Jan said, and Carol just blew her a kiss.  Jan tossed her head, her hair swinging in a perfect arc around her cheeks.  “Now.  Steve.”
Drew swiveled around.  “I can’t handle this,” he said to Harris.  “I can’t-”  He swung back around.  “You look just like him.”
“Ah.” Jarvis gave the button a curious look.  “It's been so long, I hadn't thought it worked any longer.”
He gave Steve a faint, warm smile.  "We could, of course, make up a room for you in the servant's quarters.  However, that would not be available to occupy immediately, there is a great deal of cleaning and moving of furniture that would be required before that would-"
Steve sighed as Bucky dropped his tankard to the table and crossed in front of Steve to retrieve his pot from the fire.  “I don’t see anyone letting you starve,” Steve said, trying to keep his voice flat. “You’re-”  He pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Shuri.  You can’t stay here.”
An instant, and he knew how this would end. He's slipped through Death's fingers before, leaving a trail of blood on the sand behind him, leaving something else along with it, some shattered and fragmented part of himself.
The innkeeper didn’t even look up as they entered his attention focused on the ledger book spread open in front of him.   Half a dozen coins, polished and bright, stood out amid the piles in front of him, and he gestured behind him with a twitch of his head.  “Back parlor, my lords,” he said, his voice rough.  Bucky took a step forward, his booted foot hitting the ground with a thump, and the man looked up, peering through the smoke from his pipe.  “And my lady,” he amended.
Tony's fingers drummed against the sides of the sink.  “And how did this end up with him in bed with me?” he asked.
Another beat, so predictable that it became a source of comfort.  Jarvis thinking, in his own lightning fast way, how to phrase what needed to be said.  DJ liked knowing that he wasn't the only one who struggled with words, at least sometimes.  “I have never lied to you,” Jarvis said at last.
Steve didn't look up from his sketchbook. “Out here.” He dragged the tip of his pencil across the page, barely noticing the mark he'd left behind.
Peter blinked at him.  “Oh,” he said at last.  “Because, when Aunt May says ‘earmuffs,’ she wants me to cover my ears, mostly so she can yell at you and I thought that was what-”
When he looked up at Steve this time, his gaze was steady.  “That’s the last I saw of him.  Stane lost his mind, said he could identify us both, I told him, no one would listen to a kid, but he didn’t want to hear it.  Gave me a gun, and told me to handle it.  Once and for all.”
“Ever evolving, sir, and might well be different tomorrow night.”  Jarvis opened the connecting door, revealing DJ waiting on the other side.  Jarvis smiled down at him.  “A case in point.”
“Don't make such a-” Tony gave him an indignant look.  “Pepper's gotten more out of this relationship than I have!  That's-”  He leaned over.  “What have I gotten out of you, Rogers?”
A minute later, he was pushing the door to DJ’s room open, relieved to find Steve standing in front of the windows, his attention focused on the latch that held them shut.  They’d left the room the way they’d found it, with DJ’s clothes and belongings scattered across the floor.  The doors to the wardrobe hung open, toys and books in a heap beside it.
"No, but Howard had been marching you in front of the press and the public since you were born, so..."  Steve stared at him, unsure why the answer mattered as much as it did.  "How old?"
Steve stared at him, and Clint grinned.  “Three doors, three people.  Rhodes, Miss Potts, and Mr. Stark himself, all standing in one of them, all of them holding guns in what could only be called a professional manner.”
“I don’t want to be charged for that, and I meant, I didn’t think it was a real thing.  That people did.  Then I met you,” Steve pointed out.  “And your disconcerting laughter.”
“I do not think she needs encouragement, but I like to give it, anyway,” Nakia said, sliding out of the saddle in a lithe, easy movement.  Behind her, the men did the same, with less grace and a lot more grumbling.  She flicked her wrist, wrapping her horse’s reins around one hand in a practiced gesture, and looked at Shuri.  “Shall we negotiate, my favorite royal?”
“This results in a very peculiar problem,” Jarvis said.  “Where the child hears, so often, and so conclusively, that people would only choose to be near them, would only choose to associate with them, because there is a financial benefit to that association.  Though few would admit it, I do not doubt that most come to believe it.”
The photographer seemed to be struggling to find something to say.  From the back, someone else called out, "So how do you think about it?"
Stark nodded.  “Right.” He held up a finger between them.  “Also, I get to win an argument of my choosing at some point in the future, whenever I want to call that in,” he said.  “I don’t care if I’m right.  I don’t care if I’m utterly wrong, in fact, that’s probably when I’m going to call this in, because you owe me, and I get to play the ‘you fucking left me and I was pretty sure you were going to die and that I had lost everything’ card and I get you to agree that the sky is orange, even if it clearly, absolutely is not.”
Tony started to shake, and Steve grabbed for his shoulders, the move pure instinct.  But Tony's head tipped up, and he was grinning, he was laughing, his face flushed and his eyes bright.  “So, what?” he asked, and everything cold and still had been washed out of his voice.  He sounded so happy that Steve couldn't even take offense at the laughter.
“Not having sex on your front porch, Tony,” Steve muttered into Tony’s throat, his mouth hot and desperate.
Harris was sitting on the couch, his feet braced on the coffee table.  Darcy was sprawled out next to him, her head on his lap, a blanket tangled around her shoulders, leaving her legs mostly bare.  She was sleeping, her breathing slow and heavy, her face half-hidden behind her hair.  Her fingers were tucked up tight under her chin, the blanket clutched in her fingers.
“Of course he did,” Steve said.  He propped his chin on one hand.  “So.  You had no idea what he was saying.”
He raised his head, just far enough to aim a glare in the phone’s direction.  Maybe if he ignored it, it would go away.
Steve set his coffee cup down before he spilled it.  Or snapped the handle off.  “Yeah,” he agreed.  “That.”
DJ paused.  His eyes slid to the side.  “Yes,” he said, drawing the word out.  Then he shoved a forkful of cream and sugar into his mouth, as if to stave off any other awkward questions.
Tony nodded.  “He’s completely fucked the Foundation Budget, you know that, don’t you?  They think I’m the one who did it, and now there’s a surplus and it’s-  It’s chaos over there, Steve.  So many very upstanding members of society caught between gratitude and wanting to murder me.”
Stark's lips kicked up in a lopsided smile. “Judging by the expression on your face, though, I'm assuming this isn't one of them.”  He unbuttoned his cuffs, rolling his sleeves up.  “What've you done to my engine, Rhodes?”
Tony took a deep breath. “He’s not simple,” he said, and Obie threw his hands in the air.  “He’s not.  He’s almost done with his clock, did I tell you that?  Put it back together, without instruction, without plans, by memory, it’s-”
“And now Bruce,” Natasha continued.  “And they couldn’t A. buy that much Jell-O and B. transport that much Jell-O. However, know what’s much smaller than the pool?”
“I believe in multitasking,” she said.  She grinned at DJ.  “Will you ride the roller coaster with me?”
Keeping her talking was the best way to keep her distracted.  “Something else?  School?  Friends?”  In his ear, Nat was whispering a particularly vicious Russian threat, and he heaved a slight sigh.  “Friends are just...”  Clint shook his head.  “Never save anyone's life, they just never let you forget it.”
Tony took the coffee cup out of her hand, hoping she had a sip left.  No such luck.  “Is this your way of saying that you want to come out with us tonight?” he asked.  “Because you’re always welcome, Pepper.”
“In his defense, he would’ve eaten the toast, too,” Steve said, making a half-hearted grab for DJ as he passed.  DJ ducked under his hands, giggling as he went.  He continued across the room, his feet following a set of rules only he could understand. Tony held out a hand, without even looking down, and DJ caught it, using it to swing himself around Tony’s legs.  He peered past the panels, out into the yard.
“Resonance,” Wanda said.  She held up her hands, red light arcing between her fingers. Furbro darted around her arm, one paw flexing as he tried to catch the threads.  “Almost a tone.  To a trained ear, you can tell the instrument that plays a note, the composer of a melody, perhaps even the identity of the musician.”
Tony shook his head, grabbing the railing with one hand and pulling himself upright, the muscles of his arm pulling taut.  “There’s no ‘close enough’ when it comes to timekeeping, sir,” he said, swinging his body up to brace one foot on the railing and the other on the side of the building next door.  Precariously balanced between the two, he peered up into the mechanism above his head.  The pulley system that allowed the awning to be retracted had clearly failed, and Tony tugged at the knotted cord.   “Precision.  One should strive for precision.”
“That’s how we know that they are uncontrollable, Clint,” Phil said.  He reached for his pen.  “And every state you crossed and every building you set foot in and every magic user you looped into this conversation has resulted in another form for me to fill out or report that I need to file, so I’m going to repeat, do you really think that annoying me right now is your best plan?”
Or any of the rest of it, really.  The constant conversation or the disapproving looks or the snarky comments or the way that Steve had managed to integrate himself into every single element of Tonyy’s life in a surprisingly short amount of time.  He didn’t miss the way that Steve checked the locks on the doors and the windows, hovering, fussing, with that worried look, as if he actually cared if something happened to-
“This is undignified,” Steve told her, as Carol turned on the sound system.  Jess came barreling across the floor to leap onto her back.
“Then why haven’t they?”  The blonde opened his mouth, and she held up a hand.  “Not here, not now, I get it, whatever your documentation problem is, as long as they’re adults, I do not care, but why are they doing it now?  When they can’t do it legally?”  She paused.  “Not to be rude, honey, but is this their idea or yours?”
“Change the locks,” Tony said, the words broken up by giggles.  “Steve.  Just-”  He lost it again, laughing so hard that he was struggling to breathe.
Sam dropped his hands.  “I think he’s trying, in his own-”  He shook his head.  “Special way, to convince me to give you a chance.”
She looked back at him.  “A need that no one else will see coming.  If he's right, then that means we'll have a captive market.  We'll be selling, months, perhaps even years, before anyone else.”
He’d learned to stay quiet.  Breakfast, his father said, with that stern, leaden voice that he hated, was for quiet contemplation of the coming day.  He didn’t tolerate talking before he’d finished his meal.  And after he’d finished, he’d stand, greet them both a good day, and take his leave.  Most of time, Tony hadn’t known if he was relieved or disappointed by that.
“Hush, you,” Tony mouthed at him, and Steve went back to stirring his stewpot, still laughing.  Tony went back to the video. “Steve can't have a cat, just like I can't have a cat, because we work too much.”
“Is it our turn to watch you?” Phil asked, considering the cooling racks of cookies.  “I thought you were coming over tomorrow.”
“These paint tubes are empty, Cap,” Carol said, holding up one flat, rolled up tube.  She gestured at it.  “This...  This is empty.  There is no paint left in any of these.  These are trash.”
“Let’s be honest with ourselves,” Trip said, leaning forward.  “If the frame is nice enough, no one’s going to bother reading it.”
Agatha held up a hand.  “How many women in your life have asked you, quite politely, to please stop talking?” she asked, her lips twitching.
“Shhhhhh.”  She leaned in as well.  “Just breathe.  In.  Out.   In.  Out.”  She breathed with him, her breath whispering over his hair, leading him, showing him how.
Jess hopped off of her stool, reaching across the narrow space and unlocking the door long enough for Rhodey to slip through.  “Thanks,” he said, nodding at her. “Did you save me a-”
“They always are, now we can just blame erections,” Tony said.  He stripped off his shorts and stepped into the shower.  “Which is better than blaming how much we hate each other.”
“Wha-” Startled, Steve let Greer tug him down the hall and around the corner.  A few quick steps, and she was shoving a door open, pulling Steve along with her.  Steve’s head swung to the side.  “Wait, isn’t this the women’s locker room?”
Happy tugged on the brim of his cap.  “Been a good year or more since I’ve been to confession,” he said with a grin.  “I imagine this’ll take a while.”
Stark came striding across the garage floor, tall and lean, his dark hair artfully disordered, his goatee neatly trimmed.  He moved with a fluidity, with a grace, that caught the eye, his back straight and his shoulders square.  His hands were tucked in his pockets, his artfully tailored jacket flowing easily over his slim form.
Rogers' face was red now, a flush spreading over the fine bridge of his nose and his high cheekbones, extending all the way to the tips of his ears.  But he soldiered on anyway, and God, Tony was starting to appreciate the way he just kept charging forward, singleminded and ruthless to his goal.
He slid off the bed, and wandered in the direction of his own room, rubbing at his eyes as he went.  Tony followed behind him, his hands still held loosely in his pockets.  “First thing we’re going to do,” he said, “is teach you how to wash your own face, because this seems a less efficient use of my time.”
“You wanted me to,” Tony said.  He hooked a chair with one foot, dragging it away from the table and dropping into it, all loose limbs and easy grace.  He propped an elbow on the arm of the chair and rested his chin on fisted hand.  “Didn’t you?”
Steve stared at the sky, his jaw locked, his hands braced on his hips.  Sam patted him gently on the shoulder.  “You can swear,” he said, his voice sympathetic.  “This is a swearing situation, Steve.”
“If you cut off the front of them, you can-” Steve started, and Carol reached for a trash bag.  Before he could stop her, she swept the paint tubes off the table and into the bag.  “That was mature,” he told her, and Carol leaned in, almost nose to nose with him.
There was a faint click, and the shelves shifted, the contents rattling with the small movement.  Tony slipped a hand behind it and pulled it forward, revealing the dark, twisting stairs down into the basement.  He wriggled through the gap, the box held over his head.  As soon as he was through, he fumbled behind him, grabbing the handle in the darkness and pulling the shelf back into place.
“Yeah,” he said. “I've got a thing, too.” He paused. “I might not be back until late tonight. You know. Dinner may not.. Might not happen.”
Pepper gave him a sympathetic look.  "Steve.  You're not..."  Her mouth went thin.  "You tend to tell the truth in interviews.  Which is an admirable quality, really, it is-"
His phone rang again, and this time, it was Clint’s ringtone.  He picked it up.  “I changed my mind,” he said.  “Get back here.”
But he was nearly back to the theater, moving at a quick pace already, when the familiar sound reached him, followed by the sound of screams.  And he’d known, in an instant, that he’d made a mistake.  He’d made a mistake in leaving Tony and DJ to bring the other boys to the trolley.  He’d made a mistake in letting them come to the movie to begin with.
“I have, and we’ll make a go of it,” Steve said, straightening up.  He dusted his hands off on his legs.  “You’ve never been afraid of a little hard work before.”
“I come to drop off donations and I get to wash dishes,” Steve said, emerging from the bathroom with a thermometer in one hand.  “So I don't want to hear it from you, buddy.”  To Tony, he said, “Open up.”
“Let me explain something here, neither of those numbers is comforting,” Tony said.  “Who are you calling?”
“And that’s when you realized he was still alive?” Bucky asked.  The fire crackled behind him, and he gave it a suspicious look, but didn’t stand.
"Oh, Rogers's a good egg," the boy said, offering Pepper the milk.  "They'll joke with him, make no mistake, Miss, but no one's gonna cross him if he tells 'em no.”  He gave her a bright grin, his freckled nose wrinkling.  “They know better than that.”
DJ dragged a wet rag out of the bucket, slapping it against the polished floor.  “Ready,” he crowed, grabbing the rag with both hands.  As Steve watched, amused despite himself, Peter grabbed DJ’s feet, lifting them up and tipping him forward so his weight was balanced on his hands, and the wet rag clutched between them.
Steve stabbed a fingertip against the folder.  "He's been arrested more than a dozen times, sir.  He's got an arrest record longer than half the breadlines in his city.  He got picked up at age eleven for discharging a pistol in the middle of a street fight.  We've got him for bootlegging, attempted murder, half a dozen organized crime rackets-"
It hadn’t paid off.  He had low standards and yet, the content of the cup still didn’t manage to satisfy them.  But it was available, and it was hot and he was desperate.
“Friends, yes.  School’s harder,” DJ said.  He picked up a cup of soup, but made no move to open it, just rolling the cup between his hands, as if he was warming his palms.  “I have a girlfriend.”
He had an instant to see the confusion on her face, and then she disappeared behind a wall of red and green leaves.  “Oh.”  The leaves rustled as she tried to get a grip on it.  “I-  Thank you.”
“If they have, I haven’t listened,” Tony said, but Steve was still in his bed, bare and beautiful and getting toast crumbs in Tony’s sheets.  Satisfied, Tony headed for the door.
“And that's just fine.”  She curled a leg under her, rocking forward and standing up with the sort of grace DJ couldn't even understand, let alone attempt to replicate.  “Doing what you expected to do, that's always going to be easier.  But you still have the choice.”  She leaned over, offering him a hand.  “That's the important thing.  It's your schedule.  You can change it, if you want to.  If you need to.”
"I'm going to repeat: you got your tongue.  Stuck.  In the neck of an Evian bottle," Steve told him.  "And then you wrapped yourself in every towel in the room and tried to climb into the only bed soaking wet."
Tony folded the napkin back around the food, not willing to eat it.  Not yet.  It was going to be a very long night.
“We got our wedding picture taken!” Darcy said, leaning around Clint to thrust it through the open car window.
Steve ignored him. “I will be pissed,” he said. He leaned in, bracing his hands on the conference table between them. “So we will get through this, and I'm going to have a good hard look at any press release Marcy comes up with before it goes out, and when it's all over, I am still going to need you to be my friend.”
“Right,” he said, going back to his coffee.  “Because that would be terrifying.” His eyes darted up.  “Not because of you.  Because of Doctor Domagic.”  He stopped again.  “Not that you didn’t have a life before him.  I think you had a life before him, I’m honestly not sure, but I’m pretty sure that I need to believe that he wasn’t your first experience with-”  He stopped.  “I’m not asking for your dating history.”
“Christmas,” DJ agreed.  He disappeared under the tree, coming up with an envelope and a big box wrapped in red and gold metallic paper.  He handed the envelope to Steve, who took it with a smile and pressed a kiss to his head.  “Christmas!”
“I’d like to live through the weekend, so no,” Pepper said.  She stole another of Tony’s quick pickles, her eyes narrowed as her teeth sank into the crisp chunk of cauliflower.  “Maybe Sam will-”
Tony smoothed a hand over his chest, his fingers light on the fabric.  "What do you think?"  He dropped into the chair opposite Steve, the movement graceful and controlled.  He tossed the napkin down between them.  "I think it suits me."
“Right,” Tony said.  But his lips were twitching. He glanced at DJ.  “Isn’t that great?  You’re going to see a movie.”
“And the whole ‘making everything about me’ thing has immediately backfired,” Tony said, and Steve loved him so much it was a physical ache.  Tony glanced back at him, light playing across the planes of his face, along the curve of his lips, lighting sparks in the depths of his eyes.  “Fine.  I know when I’m outflanked.”
Steve tossed it back in the box.  “Shut up and eat your dinner, Tony,” he said, his face still red.  But he was laughing, too, his eyes bright.
"No," he repeated, giving Steve a look.  Steve just grinned at him.  "Do not encourage her."  To Jan, he said, "If you want plates, you can rent them."
She paused.  “The desert at night is the closest I’ve ever gotten to being…”  Her voice trailed away, and she reached for her cup.  “It made my head quiet.”  Her nose wrinkled.  “If that makes sense.”
Steve followed him out into the hall, doing his best to ignore the crashing sound behind them.  “Huh,” he said.  Jarvis glanced at him, his expression inquisitive.  Steve shook his head.  “Sorry, I just-”
Steve’s chest ached.  “I…  Wanted to,” he admitted.  “I tried, I suppose.  But you’re not-”  He took a breath, and when he let it go, he let go of something else with it.  He wasn’t sure what, but he was suddenly sure.  Everything felt right, in a way that it hadn’t in a very long time.  “You’re not what I expected.”
“No spitting on the floor,” Natasha said.  “Clint picks up bad habits so easily it’s not even funny.”
“He went with you,” Clint interrupted.  His eyes darted towards Harris.  “You.  Harris.  And DJ.  As soon as we walked into the room-”
“No, thank you.” He turned, giving her a quick wave over his shoulder.  “I’ll leave you to figure out exactly why I need all of that.  Have a good night.”
“I just ran a few miles,” Steve pointed out, as Jan dragged him towards the elevator.  “I think I've stretched.”
The hardest part, as it turned out, was getting Stark out of the basement.  It was Pepper who was sent into the depths of the house, finally emerging with her arm tucked securely through his.  He seemed confused by the situation, blink up at the clear blue sky with a bemused expression.
Tony stared into the dark depths of his cup, exhaustion sweeping over him.  None of it made any sense, really.  He’d been working almost constantly, both in his workshop and down in the sub-basements.  But when he finally managed to collapse into his bed, he’d found sleep hard to come by.  It wasn’t as if he missed Steve.  Sure, he missed the sex, but he’d gone without sex before, and for a hell of a lot longer than a week.
“It doesn't bother you,” Miss Potts said, and it wasn't really a question, but Steve answered it anyway.
“He…” Bobbi paused.  She looked at Natasha, who raised one shoulder in a half shrug.  Bobbi looked at Steve.  “He didn’t send us.  But he didn’t stop us.”
Steve smoothed a hand over his hair, pushing it back so he could catch a peek of Tony's face.  “For what?”
Clint let out a bark of laughter.  “My ancestors weren’t even French,” he said, his chin bobbing in a nod.  He diced an onion, the blade still moving with dizzying speed, and reached for another one.
Slowly, deliberately, he refolded the page, smoothing the creases to a knife edge.  “Of course, this changes nothing.” With an almost offhanded flick of his hand, he tossed it into the fireplace.  “Officially, Happy’s in charge of security around here, but he’s not exactly good at the job.  Too friendly, or maybe not friendly enough.” He paused, his hands propped on his hips.  “He’s not suited to the job, I think even he would agree to that, so this seems like the perfect time to shift some people around.”
“Yeah, I’m the-” Jess broke off to yawn, her whole face scrunching up with the force of it.  “I’m the crazy one of the group.  Stop biting my style.”
Tony let his head fall back against Steve's shoulder, his feet following along with the steps, the ridiculous, stupid steps.  “Jeans, boots,” he said.  “What part of this is so hard to understand?”
“My house, my people, my mistake,” Tony said, cutting him off with ruthless efficiency.  “What's wrong with the room?”
“I’m not saying we’ll actually go through with it, but there’s traffic and I’m bored,” Darcy said.  “DJ.  My man.  Heist?”
The man looked down, at the watch in his hand, and then back at Steve.  “I can fix it,” he said, his voice quiet.  He smiled, slight and strained.  “I apologize.  I shouldn’t have taken it.  But I can fix it.”
Finally, Steve's hand fell away from Tony's, hopping onto the bike.  Tony's hand hovered in mid-air for a moment, wishing that the warmth of Steve's fingers didn't fade so quickly.  He tucked his hands in his pockets.  “Okay, so-”
“What’s the message?” DJ asked.  Fury paused in the act of taking a bite of the sandwich, and DJ leaned forward.  “You said.  Message.  What was it?”
The officer nodded, a pleased look on his face.  Then he looked back down at his forms.  "Now.  Purpose of visit?"
Steve reached up, gently touching the edge of the gauze that was visible over the top of Tony’s shoulder.  His eyes darted to Tony’s, and Tony sighed.  “I don’t know if you noticed the state of Mjolnir,” he said with a wry smile.  “But there was a small altercation.”
Steve caught his arms, his grip light, just enough to force Tony to keep facing him.  “We are going to find him, Tony.  We are going to find him, and bring him back.  And you need to be here.  You need to be waiting for him.  Or I can’t bring him back.”
“You did that just to see my reaction, didn’t you?” Tony asked him.  DJ gave a firm nod.  “Also a legitimate strategy.”  He looked up at Steve.  “I take it that this is going to be a bit of a wild ride.”
Both hands went back to the steering wheel.  “He’s got steady hands and doesn’t flinch from the sight of blood, let me tell you.  Just likes plants more, I guess.”
DJ shifted his backpack up on his shoulder.  “Thank you,” he said.  He smiled, and Rogers reached out, his hand resting lightly on DJ’s back.  DJ looked up at him, then to his father, and then back at the rest of them. “I’m not sorry.  That I came back.”
Her eyes were slits now, sharp and hard.  “So you want to do a chargeback?  You go right ahead.  I won’t even contest it.  You want to sue me?  Fine. Pretty sure Bernie already hates you on general principles, so she’s probably got a filing ready to go.  But I don’t think you will, because if you do, you’ll have to find yourself a new artist, and Tony?”  She smiled.  “You’re lazy.”
"He thinks he is," Steve said, catching the boy by the collar of his shirt. "Okay. That's enough, Romeo."
"I can imagine."  Steve shifted in his seat, still terrified that this tiny, fragile chair wasn't going to hold his weight.  "Tony.  There was two guys out there.  Two, at most."
“For that, I do apologize,” he said.  He looked at DJ.  “I would never have let you in if I truly thought you were in any danger.”  He took a deep breath.  “You know that, don’t you?”
Tony gave his head a toss.  “Yes, but on me, it looks wildly romantic.  The papers all say so,” he said, and Steve laughed, the sound muffled behind his fingers.  Tony grinned at him.  “However, your point is taken.  I’ll draw us a bath.  I’m going to regret telling Jarvis I can do it, now he’s going to make me handle it for myself from now on.  And it’s not that I can’t, it’s just he does it better.”
“It is always for the best to acknowledge your limitations, sir,” Jarvis said.  “Are we expecting anyone else for dinner?”
He walked along the table, pausing next to Tony’s chair.  He held out his plate, and when Tony reached for it, Ty met his eyes with a smile and let the thin porcelain slip from between his fingers.  It tumbled to the floor and shattered with a crash.
"Waxing the floor," Stark continued, his hands braced on his narrow hips.  His head tipped back, the long curve of his neck freckled with plaster dust.  "Building chairs from scratch.  Weaving a rug-"
“He doesn’t like anything crossing the wards,” Happy said, an apple in one hand and a tea cup in the other.  He took a large bite from his apple and continued to talk, his mouth full.  “He thinks it weakens the blessin’s, you know that.”  He wiped his mouth on the back of one wrist.  “Lotta people stomping around makes him anxious.”
Tony arched an eyebrow.  “I mean, you left me to freeze to death, cold and hungry, and he fed me and gave me socks, so-” His lips curled up in a wicked smile.  “He's looking pretty attractive right now.”
Tony tipped his head in her general direction, his eyes still locked on the screen, his mouth open wide.  Jan braced a fingertip against her cheek.  “Really,” she said, her voice flat.  “We’re really doing this?”
“We’ve been fake married like ten times for missions!” Clint said, and Nat smacked him gently on the back of the head. “Seriously, it’s a legitimate-” She smacked him again.  “I could start ducking, you know.”
“Well, glad one of us believes in me right now.”  Before he could change his mind, Tony bounced his knuckles against the door in a rapid, staccato pattern.  “You awake?” he called.
“If you were sane, you would've called the police after the first one,” Bruce growled against his shoulder.
Steve set his cocoa aside and reached for the envelope DJ had given him.  “I like mine,” he said.  “No wrapping paper to clean up, and-”  He pulled the card out of the envelope, his eyes scanning over it, and he abruptly fell silent.
"They sell them that way now, means nothing," Tony said, just to watch the pained look sweep over Steve's face.  He grinned.  "That caused you physical pain, didn't it?"
“No, we cannot, because tomorrow, you’d suggest that we wait until Monday and then till next month, and next thing I know, it’ll be three years from now and you’ll have skipped every single diagnostic that is on the schedule,” Tony said.  He pointed at the charging stations.  “Come on.  Phil’s civil liberties violations will still be there tomorrow.”
Startled out of his voyeurism, Steve looked up in time to see a tall, slim man in a plain black suit come striding across the room, his well-polished black shoes beating a steady tattoo on the damp tile.  He had a briefcase  in one hand, and a faint, enigmatic smile on his face.  His dark eyes found Steve's, going narrow for an instant, and then he turned back to Stark.
“MacIntyre,” Clint agreed.  “And while I love the kid, he’s not on that level.  He is nowhere near that level.”  He spread his arms wide.  “I, meanwhile, kept them under control, sorta under wraps, and absolutely in one piece.  So while my plan was a very, very bad plan, Phil, it was 100% the best option I had at the time.”
Either they didn't understand English or they were pretending they didn't so they could avoid talking to him.  It wouldn't be the first time.  But as they ducked past a display made to look like the bow of the Titanic and ran across the floor of a New York disco, circa 1975, he found himself laughing.  “I don't know where we're going, but can we go back to the Titanic, because that, that was amazing, seriously, I don't even know what's happening here, but that was an amazing work of engineering considering that it's plywood and canvas and a lot of duct tape, so-”
He stopped in front of Steve, and held out a hand, palm up.  “I’d be happy to take a look at it for you, however.”
Bucky stared at her, and mumbled something under his breath.  Next to him, Sam grinned.  “You should be used to being outsmarted by the thirteen year old by now,” he said.
“No, Parker, you may not have the key, we discussed this at ten pm.  You are taking a cab home.  You are taking a cab home and then giving me your receipt so that I can reimburse you for your cab.” Tony scraped a hand over his face.  “And this is why there is a lock on your bike, because it is THREE AM.  In FEBRUARY.  And you cannot be trusted to call a cab.”
DJ looked up at ‘chocolate,’ showing interest in the conversation for the first time since it had started.  Pepper smiled at him.  “In fact, I’m sure I’ve still got a few, secreted away.  What do you say, boys?  Would you like to join Miss Van Dyne and myself for a cup of tea and a bit of chocolate?”
Laughing, Steve kissed him.  He felt Tony's hands slip around his waist, reaching down to cup his ass.
He caught Peter’s chin with the side of his fingers, tipping his head up.  “You tried to save him, and that should never, ever have fallen to you, but you did it anyway, Peter.  It was incredibly brave and if you ever, EVER do anything that stupid again, I’m going to send you away to university and pay for you to take nothing but accounting courses, and then when you graduate, you’ll have to spend the rest of your life being the head accountant for every single one of my companies.”
Caught off guard, Tony choked on a laugh.  “What?” he blinked down at Steve, waiting for him to start laughing, too, but Steve just looked up at him, his face tense.
She let ut a mock gasp, her hand pressed to her chest.  “I went out of a sense of duty, to my kingdom, my people, and my brother,” she said.  “Also to keep him from bringing you BACK into the city, because from the moment he headed out, that’s what everyone assumed would be happening.”
“Right!” The hint sailed over Hammer's head with about a foot and a half to spare, and he started fumbling in his own pockets. “Now, where did I put that ticket?”
Jan rubbed a hand over her face.  “Yes.  Yes, Steve.  I try not to stereotype, but the idea that you were a lesbian never, ever crossed my mind.”
Tony glanced back as Darcy came pushing through the crowd, and he craned his head, looking behind her, annoyed that DJ wasn’t right with her.  “It’s fine!  For once in your life, can you not overreact?”
“Your professional opinion has been noted,” Tony said, trying to take the sting out of that with a lopsided smile.  “And ignored.”
Tony paused, his coffee cup halfway to his mouth.  He stopped.  Held up the cup.  And gestured with all the aplomb of Vanna White turning a vowel.
He grinned.  “Good answer.” He pulled up the email that Jarvis had forwarded to him, finding the concierge contact information.  “I’m sending you a file.  I need the items in it by eight am tomorrow morning.  If you can manage it, not only will your gratuity be immense, I’ll make sure anyone you have to call in to help you will be similarly compensated.”
“It was between a diorama where you could pretend to punch a Doctor Doom cosplayer and a reproduction of the UN's original Declaration of Universal Human Rights, which you could sign with a dry erase marker,” Tony said, his voice cutting.  “It was-”  He cupped a hand over his forehead.  “It was behind a guy making BALLOON ANIMALS from CONDOMS.”
“Which is why it was not allowed,” Jess said, sitting cross legged on the couch.  “Once you get onto a competitive eating spree, it is impossible to stop you.”
Someone was talking, voices low, and strangely, they seemed like they were a very long way away.  Tony squinted in that direction, trying to get his eyes to focus.  There was a low railing just to his right, and he realized that the apartment had been broken into two levels, the bedroom on a platform somewhere above the main floor of the apartment.  It took him a painfully long time, but he managed to push himself to the edge of the bed, far enough that he could get a better look.
Pepper stood.  “I have,” she said, opening the closet door with a flick of her wrist.  The boy, caught off guard, stared up at her, an expression of betrayal on his face.
Eventually, Sam or Bucky would catch up to him, both of them muttering dark things under their breath as they cantered up behind him.  Steve had done his best not to smile as he roped them into picking apples that hung, heavy and tempting, over the road, or helping him patch up a collapsed stone wall.
“Rhodey is as big of a human disaster area as you are!” Pepper said, nicking a slice of pickled carrot from his plate.  “He just does a better job of covering it up.  Until he’s in your vicinity.  Then that carefully maintained facade collapses like an undercooked souffle.”
“By which I mean, Sam,” Tony agreed.  He leaned a hand on edge of the serving window. “So, you gonna come out here and hug me, or do I have to keep standing here, looking pathetic, like that one kitten no one wants to adopt from the cardboard box in the grocery store parking lot?” He squinted up at the cloudless night sky, and nodded.  “Looks like rain.  Soon, I’ll be abandoned, unloved, AND soaking wet, so that’ll be-”
Rage swept over him, hot and hard and shredding him from the inside out.  “You know what?” he said, his voice low and vicious.  “I don’t get drunk in front of my kid, because he’s seen me drunk too often already.  And I don’t get drunk in front of Rogers, because the fucking guilt trip is worse than the hangover.  But you know what?”
Steve fended him off with one hand, his eyes bright and his cheeks pink beneath the curves of his mask.  “We could stop, you know,” he said, rebalancing his load so he could take the napkin from Tony.  “Eat like civilized people.”
Stark looked at the discarded jacket.  “Isn't that one of yours?” he asked, his hands in his pockets.
Jan considered that, her lips pursed.  “Fair,” she said at last.  She reached into her bag.  “Before I forget, I have something for you.”  After a moment, she came up with a small case.  “Here.  For you.”
“Not really my style,” Tony said, slipping his jacket on and smoothing it into place, his shoulders flexing beneath the perfect fit of the fabric.  He checked the cuffs, adjusted his tie, and headed for the elevator.  “Give me one good reason why I shouldn't just go pick out one of my many cars and-”
“And it was easy to manufacture the paperwork to make it look like a cache of weapons was coming into the docks tonight.  A tempting target for anyone who wanted to make trouble.  Wanted to kill a lot of people as quickly as possible.”
It had been years since he'd been this small.  He was barely bigger than he'd been when he'd first ended up as a human, and it was terrifying to hold him, to feel his little fingers pull against the fabric of his shirt.  Doing his best not to think about it, Clint just held DJ close, resting his chin on top of DJ's head.  “It's going to be okay,” he said, because maybe if he said it enough, they'd both believe it.  “It's going to be fine.  You're still you.  Big.  Small.  Bot.  Kid.”  DJ's arms tightened on his neck, his fingers digging into Clint's shoulder.  “You're still you.”
“At any point, did you remind Steve that he needs to use his words?” Jan said, her arms crossed over her chest. “Did you point out that verbal communication is the basis of a stable relationship?”
“I’ve scrubbed,” Steve said.  He shifted, bracing his arms on the sides of the tub.  “There’s only so much scrubbing a man can do.”
Steve turned around, and yes, that’s exactly what Bucky was doing.  “No,” Bucky said, his face set in a frown, but he never took his eyes off of the cat.  “Why is it following me.”
"You need to eat your breakfast, sir," Jarvis said, disapproval obvious in his voice.  He set the tray over Tony's lap.  "All of it."
Stung despite himself, Steve slipped his watch back into his pocket.  “Of course, I’m sorry to have-”
Sam nodded.. “Good evening,” he responded, his voice quiet.  He bowed, his back straight and his shoulders squared.  “Your Majesty.”
“Are you blackmailing me, small Storm-Richards?” Tony asked her, one eyebrow arching.  “Your mom would not approve.”
“I try not to listen to you, because it never works out well for me,” Pepper said.  “You.  Front lobby.  Ten minutes.  Happy'll be there.  Just...  Just do this for me.”
Tony was huddled against the door, his body tucked up as tight as he could make it.  “I'm a fucking joy,” he said, his voice flat, and Steve bit his lip to keep from smiling.
“It's functioning just as it's supposed to, actually.” Gyrich sounded amused, and Tony decided he did not like him.  For entirely rational reasons that did not involve a giant robot stomping through his city.
Tony pointed at the tray.  “Eat your breakfast.  I’ll draw a bath.”  If he was lucky, he could coax Steve into the tub with him; heaven knew it was large enough.
"He's not going to get adopted," he said at last, the words hard.  "No one's going to take him, Miss Potts.  He's-"  He shook his head.  "He's smart, he likes to work, he doesn't need much.  But he's-"  He stopped.  "He's odd, I suppose.  He's too quiet, and too still, and when he moves, it's not the way people expect him to move.  He can fixate on things, and sometimes he has trouble following orders and he's stubborn sometimes.”
The tendril was moving, slowly, slowly, it was uncurling, as if whatever was holding it in place was failing.  DJ stepped back, his heart in his throat.   “Not HERE!  As far away as I can-”
“And Steve,” Carol said.  She leaned over Natasha’s shoulder, fumbling for a pen.  “It’s the Council of Lesbians and Steve, and the Council of Lesbians happily accepts non-lesbians.”  Jan nodded.  Carol nodded back. “And Steve, obviously.”
"And that averages out to a good solid maybe," she said.  "Don't worry.  It's-"  She plastered a smile on her face.  "It's the Atlantean delegation, so no one will be paying attention to you anymore."
Steve looked down at the apple in his hands.  “No.”  He rolled it over between his fingers.  “I’m here, and I’m still not sure I believe it.”  He held the apple out to her.  “You stayed.”
“Wonderful.  The dailies are in the billiard room, a couple of locals and a few out-of-town ones, but I don't know how up to date they are.  There's also the library upstairs,” he mused.  “You know where that is, there are books, if you'd prefer a book.”  He stopped.  “Do you like books?”
“Sure it is,” Carol said.  Jess was now standing on her shoulders, balanced like an acrobat.  Carol took a couple of steps forward, then backpedaled, keeping Jess's weight centered.  Sam and Peter broke apart, both of them scrambling in opposite directions as Carol stumbled forward.  “If it wasn't for us, you would've given up and gone to punch things.”
Obie paused, his eyes darting back to the boy.  “Sounds good,” he said, back to his jovial self.  He gave Tony's shoulder a squeeze, the grip just bordering on painful before he finally let go.  “Now.  I'm counting on you, Tony.”
Steve thought about it.  "Cold," he said, and that startled a laugh out of the kid.  Steve smiled down at him.  "And lonely.  I wouldn't recommend it."    He looked up at the pale blue sliver of sky, far above them, savoring the warmth of the sun on his skin.  He smiled.  "This is much better."
DJ looked up at Steve, who gave him a reassuring nod.  “C’mon,” he said, his voice quiet.  “You can have a robe of your own, if you want.”
"I mean, the two of you together, you might have a chance,” Tony said.  He gave them both a sharp, cold smile.  “Might.”
Clint muttered something that was still not French, but was definitely a swear.  Still, he turned back to the stove, reaching for a pot.  Natasha rolled her eyes.  Steve looked from her, to Clint, to Stark, who was still watching them, a puckish, warm smile on his face.  Steve looked down at DJ, who had snuck all of his bacon off of his plate and into a napkin.
“No sorry,” Harris said, taking a step back as Strange reopened the portal.  The air shifted, and Harris had to brace his feet to keep himself from being dragged forward, straight at it.  It crackled and swirled, reality seeming to die at the very edges, where the portal cut through it.  He tore his eyes away, his hearbeat pounding in his ears.  “Be safe.  And if you ever have to come back, well, you can crash with me.  Okay?”
“I’m starting to realize that, thanks,” Steve said.  He pushed his hair back away from his forehead, and shrugged the weight of his coat into place on his shoulders.
"It was this or try to squeeze through the window on the bathroom."  Tony leaned to the side, giving Steve a wicked look around the edge of the menu.  "And I wasn't sure that it was the men's room."
He ripped the pages free of the binder, the plastic sheets snapping as he pulled them hard against the rings.  Turning a corner, he tossed the binder down on the nearest table and just kept walking.
Steve glared at him with one eye.  “Of course there is,” he said, knowing it would make Tony laugh.  When Tony poured more water over his head, washing the soap away, he let his eyes close, savoring the small comfort of Tony’s touch.
Maps.  Maps.  Panel rooms and video rooms and autograph rooms and hallways and vendor space and artist alley.  Harris’ eyes snapped across the page, looking for-
Harrris looked down at his feet.  “I don’t have the legs to pull off a miniskirt,” he said.  “I could do a, you know, leggings?  But seriously, knobby knees.”
He stared up at the tree, and held up a hand, spreading his fingers wide.  “I miss you.  You and Dad, both.  But mostly you.  Or maybe, just the idea of you.”
"It was very nice to meet you," Rogers said, his eyebrows tipping up, just a bit. Just enough to make him look quizzical. Or worried. "I don't want to keep you from your work any longer, though." He stood, holding out one broad palm, and Al took it, a pleased smile slipping across his features.
“Okay.”  DJ shut the door, turning away from the car.  His hands locked on the straps of his backpack, he took a deep breath.
“Okay.”  Steve stirred his oatmeal and reached for brown sugar.  “Want some juice before you change?  Or just a bite of my oatmeal?”
“A more cynical person would think you were attempting not to acknowledge that it is, in fact, a legal marriage,” Ellen said. “By implying that it really isn't.”
“Technically, that only means I don’t get a FREE cookie,” Tony pointed out.  Steve snagged a bottle of water out of the cooler, leaning out the back door to tap it against Tony’s cheek.  His eyes closed, Tony reached up, fumbling with the bottle for a moment before he managed to get a grip on it.  “God bless you, Rogers.”
Steve froze, his face going blank.  Tony, with no graceful way to withdraw, just doubled down on the contact, cradling Steve’s head between his palms.  To his surprise, instead of pulling away, Steve leaned into the contact, like a child seeking comfort.  Ignoring the uncomfortable ache in his chest, Tony leaned forward, pressing a soft kiss to Steve’s unruly locks.
“We can wait,” Tony said.  DJ scowled at him, and Tony bit his lip to keep from smiling.  “Or we could open our presents now.”
“That’s…  That’s kind of the point,” Steve said.  He opened his mouth to say something else and Tony leaned in, cutting him off with a kiss.  For a moment, Steve considered pushing him away, but he was already too addicted to the way Tony’s lips coaxed a reaction from him.  He sank into the kiss, his fingers sliding into Tony’s hair.
Steve made a displeased sound, but the tension was bleeding out of him with each breath, his shoulders relaxing, his head falling forward until his forehead was brushing against Tony's.  “We're not shacking up, Stark.”
“I mean, it’s still an option that’s on the table,” Trip told him as the boy looked over the packages.  She wiggled her eyebrows.  “I look damn fine in a pompadour.”
“That,” he whispered against Tony’s mouth.  “And this.”  The second kiss was just as soft, just as chaste, but he allowed himself to linger this time, his breath mingling with Tony’s as he coaxed a response from Tony’s lips.
“Because they're not always going to be there,” he said, and it was vicious, it was broken. “One day, you're going to get up, and the table's bare again and you're alone, and the weight you used to be able to handle? Now, it's enough to break you, because for a minute, for a fucking SECOND, it wasn't there, or at least...”
“As do I, but that poor woman needs a boss who pays more attention,” Obie said.  He glanced back down.  “You know, I remember you sitting down there with your mother.”
“Last night, she told us that she had book club today.”  Peter’s voice was almost startlingly loud in the sudden silence.  “And then, Jess asked about the book club.  And then she told us that she’d introduced you to them when you first came to New York and now you get your tattoos done here, and while you were explaining this, you yelled ‘I have a really good idea,’ and then you made us all leave.”
DJ reached up, his fingers tangling in the fabric.  He tugged the collar forward, over his head, until it hung like a mask in front of his eyes.  He rocked to the side, peeking under the edge, and ducking back out of sight again.  Tony waited, his arms folded on his knees, as DJ fumbled with the cloth.  “Does that help?” he asked, at last.
Tony waved him off.  “Wasn’t expecting such a heavy pour,” he said, taking another sip.  It had a bitter, sharp edge, and he made a face.  “Remind me to try this straight, it tastes terrible.”
There was a moment of silence.  “I'm morally conflicted,” Tony admitted.  But he took the coffee anyway.
“You're fine,” Tony said.  And, because that could read a couple of ways, he tried again.  “I don't mind.  And you will be fine.”  Steve didn't move, didn't say a word, and Tony stroked his hair, as gently as he could.  “It'll be okay,” he whispered.  Because he'd never been good at platitudes.  “It hurts because you're healing.  It's going to be okay.”
Which was probably a mistake.  He hadn’t slid down the bannister in a couple of decades, and he’d weighed a lot less the last time he’d done it.  He grabbed for the wood, trying to slow himself down, or stop himself entirely, he didn’t even know, but gravity had other ideas.  Tony bit back a curse as he barreled downwards, somehow managing to keep his balance right to the end.
“Trouble, trouble and more trouble,” Hank responded, but even though his head was still down over the gears of his mechanism, Tony could hear the smile in his voice.
"My body and I have an agreement.  It won't acknowledge pain until we're out of the situation that's causing that pain, 'cause otherwise, I'd probably have a screaming fit at least once a mission, and people hold that kinda shit against you," Clint said.  He twisted around, holding the light stick up.  The light slipped along the dark tunnel, casting eerie shadows on exposed wiring and pipes.  Clint wondered what had come down after them, collapsing the street above them.  He wasn't sure if he should get her up and walking before it could subside any more.
"I feel I'm not getting the respect I deserve here," Tony said, holding up a ball bearing.  He rolled it back and forth between his fingertips, studying the play of light along the surface.  "I feel that-"
“Okay.  Good that that’s the theme for our cookies this year, Phil’s mom’ll be pleased.” Clint ruffled DJ’s hair, kicking up a cloud of powdered sugar and flour.  “You keep doing….  Whatever that is, I’ll mix you some more orange and also see if if Jarvis can pull up the right Wikipedia page for me, ‘cause I don’t think I can even spell it.”
Steve smiled back, and it held no humor.  “The law’s the law,” he said, in a tone that sounded mocking, even to him.
Steve charged him at full speed, feet flying over the pavement, body tucked behind his makeshift shield.  He hit with all the force he could manage, lifting the man off the street and slamming him hard into the storefront across the way.  The glass of the window gave way behind him, cracks like spiderwebs arching out from the point of impact.
Franklin and Val exchanged a look, a look that DJ always thought of as their 'sibling glance.'  They could communicate without having to talk, and he envied that, he envied the way they could read each other, could see things and hear things that no one else could, when it came to each other.
Tony leaned into his body, enjoying the ache of it.  “Yeah, well, then you figure out the door, because it’s been a long few days and I’m-”
There was big, overstuffed arm chair tucked in the corner, and a small, almost child sized desk and chair on the opposite wall. A large round rug covered most of the wooden floor.  The bed was simple, the headboard painted white with gold accents.  Bookcases were set on either side of the bed, tall affairs that were painted a matching white.  They were filled with books, slim story books and well worn leather bound collections and on the lowest shelves, massive reference books about plants and ships, history and trains, animals and geography.
Tony was breathing hard, his lips swollen, his eyes huge and dark.  “The we’re operating under the same rules?” he asked, and his voice sent a shudder along Steve’s skin.  “As long as the door’s unlocked, nothing’s off limits?”
“Madam, I would never.  At least not while sober.”  Tony tossed the towel over his shoulder and started rolling up his sleeves..  “Officer Rogers, I believe you’ve lost control of this situation.”
"I may go?" Rogers echoed.  But he did take a step back, and as much as Tony missed the heat of his body, that did make it easier to think.
Nicholas’ chin dipped in a nod.  “Unless we can stop them,” he agreed.  He smiled.  “Just like old times, Captain.”
DJ considered it, his face suspicious.  "You can try it," Peter said, around a mouthful of bread.  He gestured at the plate with his crust.  "You like eggs, right?  It's pretty good.  For an egg."
“ANYWAY,” Tony said.  “No.  I got my tattoo while drunk.  Last night.  What kind of idiot would get a tattoo at this time of the morning?”
Another moment of consideration, and then DJ nodded.  He stepped back, out of the way, and headed back across the room to his bed.  Tony wandered after him, a few steps behind.  DJ's ankles were clearly visible under the cuffs of the pajama pants, and Tony wondered when he'd gotten so big.
Steve’s face split in a grin.  “There’s this clinic in Harlem-” he started, and Tony burst out laughing.
Natasha's lips twitched.  “Of course, sir.” She ducked around Clint, who slid a platter of golden brown pancakes onto the counter before turning back to the stove.  “Let's get you a plate,” she said to DJ, who'd managed to weasel another piece of bacon and some potatoes from Peter.  “Fruit jam or butter?”
“It's a cookbook with fluff pieces,” Tony said, from behind his coffee cup.  “Then there's the porn.”
Steve gave him a look.  “Saying ‘please’ works in most cases, you do realize that, don’t you?” he asked, pulling the book from Tony’s hand and tossing it towards the bedside table.  “And if you’re done rifling through my positions for the time being…”
Harris considered that.  “I think I need another sandwich,” he said at last, holding up the crust of bread he’d managed to hold onto.
He did his best not to run.   After all, the only thing waiting for him was a very hard, cold floor, and a very long night.
“I’m getting the feeling this is more for your benefit than mine,” Steve said, his voice full of affection, his thumb still rubbing slow, steady patterns across the back of Tony’s hand.  “Almost like these gifts aren’t for me at all.”
“Thanks,” Steve said, sinking down between her and Natasha.  “I was wondering if there was a spot left.”
“That’s what they want you to think,” Tony told him.  His phone beeped, a new incoming message from Jarvis.  “Reservation’s all set.” He glanced at DJ.  “Next time we see your Strange, you should, you know, write your parents a letter or something.”
“I’m fine,” he said.  He rubbed the cat’s chin.  “Sorry.  For the trouble.”  He scowled at Furbro, who seemed unconcerned.  “I was…”  His mouth worked.  “Tired.”
Tony pressed both hands to his face.  “How much of parenting, percentage wise, is regretting the loopholes that your child finds in what you tell him to do?”
Darcy grabbed the churro back from him, and looked around his arm at the face of his phone.  “Busted,” she said, her voice saccharine.
Despite the crush, Steve located Seamus without much difficulty. The red-headed boy was staring up at a small inset mural, his freckled nose wrinkled. “You shouldn't wander off,” Steve said, catching his attention.
DJ shook his head.  “No,” he said.  He looked down at the cup in his hands, his fingers flexing.  “It’s…  Not a good idea.”  His eyes flicked up, and then back down.  “I know.”
“Can you please relax?” he asked, and there was such warmth in his voice that Steve felt his face flush.  “Is that even a possibility with you?” Steve stared at him, and Tony started to laugh.  “Fine.”  He reached for a towel from the stack and tossed it onto the tile next to the bath.  “Give me that bottle.”
“Jesus, I don’t have daddy issues,” Tony said, gesturing so hard that he managed to spill coffee down his leg.  Cursing, he dropped the cup into the cupholder.  “I don’t have-”
“And the general population isn’t particularly sympathetic to those problems,” Obie pointed out.  He exhaled, a long drawn out sigh.  “Tony.  I’m done discussing this.”
Steve wrenched the door open, squinting against faint light of the hall.  “Here,” he finished, the word falling almost silently out of his mouth as the figure in front of him turned to face him, and Steve’s stomach bottomed out.
Phil gave up.  “Agent Barton,” he said, folding his hands on his desk in front of him, and Clint’s eyebrows arched.  Phil ignored that.  “What is the SHIELD rule about interdimensional or temporal incursions?”
“And this is what happens to people who challenge the status quo.” Logan nodded.  “Who woulda guessed?”  He rolled to his feet.  “We'll send you what we've got on Gyrich.  But don't get so distracted by the front that you forget to look at who's funding him.”  He tucked his hands in his pockets.  “If they're using him, eventually he'll stop being useful.  And that's when things are going to get ugly.”
Steve looked behind him, making sure Tony was with him before he continued, “Where’s Hammer?” he asked as Natasha and Happy slid out of the front seat..
Steve barely heard him.  He swung around, his hand snagging the strap of his shield, and everything clicking into place as he gave the car door a hard shove.  He heard Happy yelling, but he barely noticed.  He certainly didn’t care.  The door popped open and he was free, the shield taking the brunt of the impact as he hit the ground and rolled.  The momentum carried him straight to his feet and in a heartbeat, he was up and running, as fast as his legs could carry him.
“Yes,” Steve repeated.  He shook his head.  “He's different.  Not better, not worse, just different.”  He huffed out a breath.  “Let me put it this way, Miss Potts.  Say you had a domestic who was a hard worker and a loyal one, who did most things well, but never washed the windows the way you wanted them washed.  And then one day, you realized that she was simply too short to reach them.”  He arched his eyebrows.  “Would you fire her and find someone taller?  Or would you just give her a stool?”
Tony opened his mouth, a quip hovering on the tip of his tongue, but Steve was just watching him, his gaze level and steady.  Tony let out his breath in a huff of laughter.  “What do you want to know?” he asked, leaning over his food.
*“I swear to god, if you hire a caterer that advertises ‘Friday Fiestas!’ I am going to have to call this friendship into serious question.”
“Right.  We can’t have that, Mrs. Parker would be appalled.”  Tony stood up, drawing DJ up in his arms, settling the boy against his chest.  DJ, for his part, slumped against Tony’s chest, one hand locking on the wrinkled fabric of Tony’s shirt.  If Tony noticed when the shirt pulled against his neck, he didn’t say a word.  He just turned his head, brushing a kiss against DJ’s head, his eyes fluttering shut.
“Tony.”  Steve shook his head.  “I have to do it on Friday, and you're booked up for all your seatings all weekend, and you have two catering events.  You have enough problems without wasting Friday morning dealing with primer.”
She smiled.  "I promise nothing of the sort.  You are not showing up in filthy jeans and a shirt you got six years ago because you signed up for a credit card or won it in a beer pong tournament."  She waved her pencil at Thor.  "Thor is getting a new suit!"
Stark grinned, his face relaxed and amused.  "Yes, well, I am sorry, but he's got a job to do if you'd like to eat."
He took a deep breath.  “I am doing this only because A. Steve went for what he termed a 'quick 10K' and that means he's running around the whole island, and B. because I hate Rudolph with the white hot passion of a thousand dying suns.”
Everything seemed to slow down, the world whiting out on the edges, the thud of his pulse loud in his ears. Steve sucked in a breath, slow and careful, his fingers hovering over the surface of his phone.
Tony sipped his coffee, letting the warmth curl through him.  “I'm fine, Steve,” he said, and he sounded like he'd swallowed a frog.  He tried to clear his throat, which was never going to work, but he was stubborn and stupid.  “Stop asking.”
“As there is no one else here in the room, or-” He slashed a hand through the air.  “Or anywhere else that I can find, that question was aimed in your general direction.”
“No, no you can’t,” Harris said, holding the lobby door for them.  Darcy made kissy noises at him as they passed, and he sighed.  “Fine.  DJ can throw petals at me.”
Steve stilled, one foot braced on the bottom of the stairs, his hands still hovering in the air.  “Are you sure?” he asked, and he sounded torn.
The way his shoulders and arms flexed when he slung the massive piles of dough certainly didn't hurt Tony's mood either.
By the time he reached the kitchen, Tony had already collected a coffee cup from the cupboard.  He looked over his shoulder as Steve walked in.  “Hey, Cap,” he said with a smile.  “I’m going to fall asleep unless I get some coffee in me.”  He held up the cup.  “Want some?”
Steve blinked.  “No, they didn't,” he said, because of course they didn't.  They couldn't.  He wouldn't have done that.
“I'd call you rude, but I think you deserve credit for asking the tough questions,” Tony said.  “Bruce made moussaka, a giant-” He gestured with his hands.  “There's like a tray of moussaka, so we have plenty.  And Steve's picking up some spanakopita, and those little, you know, the grape leaf things.”
“Hammer might be dead,” Steve said, fishing in his pocket.  He came up with a handful of bills, holding them out to Billy.  “Stay here.  Keep trying to get through to Stark Manor.  If you do get through, tell them that Stane might be our kidnapper.”  He pressed the cash into the boy’s hand.  “Repeat that back.”
“Yeah?”  Greer studied him, and she was smart and warm and fun and beautiful, sharp as a knife and so warm.  She loved sushi and dancing and loud music and people, just like Tony.
“More ‘n I’d like,” Happy admitted.  His fingers flexed on the steering wheel, his knuckles going white for a second.  But his face never changed, his easy smile floating over his features like a mask.
There was a damn fountain under the damn stairs.  He didn't even know how to process something like that.
“You do!  Every important person in your life has looked at you and in under thirty seconds has gone, ‘yeah, you’re full of bullshit, and I’m not dealing with it,’ and that’s the way you like it.  People who respect you have proven that you can play them, that you can sell them whatever nonsense you’re peddling, and therefore, you hate them,” Clint said.  He snatched his map back from Tony’s lax hands.  “Rhodes.  Potts.  Rogers.  The rest of us.  We’ve all looked at you and gone, ‘under that fancy haircut, those smug sunglasses, and ten thousand dollar suit, you’re a mess of a human being who’d prefer to be hiding in his basement playing with his robots,’ and that’s the only reason you tolerate us.”
Steve's head came up, and his eyes were wide and unfocused, his cheeks flushed.  “What?” he managed, before he went hard for Tony's mouth, the kiss stealing the breath from both of them.
DJ squinted up at Tony, who stepped back, tucking his hands in his pockets.  Steve struggled to smile.  “Hi,” he whispered.  “Why aren’t you in bed?”
The bed dipped as she took a seat next to him.   Darcy rubbed a hand down his back. “In my defense-” she started.
Harris stared at him.  “Right,” he said, drawing the word out.  “Cool.  Have you considered giving him one less thing to stress over?   Just…  Because, you know, he’s probably having a pretty rough time of it, too?”
He pulled one leg up, bracing his elbow on his knee. “My mother was from Italy, and that’s, well, it’s a long way away.  She came from a very old, very aristocratic family.  Lots of land.  Lots of history.  Not much-”  He held up one hand, rubbing his thumb against his fingertips.  “Not much money.”
"You took my blanket," Tony said, and Bucky made an inarticulate sound.  Tony's head tipped in Steve's direction. "He took my blanket."
Tony frowned at the cup of lemonade that Jarvis set in front of him.  “Where's my coffee?” he asked.
“Was this last week or the week before?” Steve asked, just to hear him laugh.  He looped his arms around Tony’s waist, tipping his head forward to let Tony finish messing with his hair.
Steve stepped down, keeping his boots out of the water.  “Not getting better?” he asked, his voice quiet.  Above them, the wind still stirred the branches, the faint, warbling call of a bird mixing with the rattle of the leaves.  Beyond that, there was just silence.
Tony took a deep breath, savoring the sun and the wind on his face.  He could hear traffic in the distance, the grinding of tires on damaged pavement and the slow, steady beeping of big machinery backing up.  The smells of hot tar and motor oil hung in the air, and below that, the tang of salt from the ocean, out of sight but waiting just there, beyond the skyline.  His fingers flexed against the metal of the railing, feeling the rough edges of the flaking paint, and the gritty degradation of rust.
“The government is coming for my child,” Sue said, her voice flat.  Her smile was thin and brittle.  “So my mood is swinging wildly between 'how do I get him to the nearest boarder,' and 'how do I overthrow the current administration?'”
“Right,” Darcy said, taking a delicate bite from one fry.  Harris gave her a look as he unwrapped his sandwich, and she waved the rest of the fry at him.  “Did you watch StarkSearch last night?”
“I’ve done my best to build up an immunity, but she manages to make every time a new and ever more terrifying experience,” Tony said.  “I think it’s because-”
She turned it over, her fingers cradling the barrel and the grip.  “Army issue,” she said.  She set it gently back on the counter, sliding it across to him.  “That, I had expected.  But I thought it might be military surplus, rather than an actual sidearm that had made it through the war.”
Pepper's new friend looked back at her with a grin. “Be careful, Miss.  Ol' man Hammer'd steal the last coin from his mother's purse, an' not miss a bit of sleep over it.”  He tugged on his ear, his gaze sharp.  “But you didn't hear it from me.”
In front of them was a small raised dais, almost lost in the midst of larger, louder setpieces.  On it was a small table piled with stacks of paper and folders, a small metal goblet, and a couple of candles.  An elderly man, wizened and bent with age, was perched on a rough wooden stool, a bible in his lap and his thin, gnarled hands folded over the grip of his cane.  He looked up as the girls finagled Tony up the single step onto the platform, a smile creasing his cheeks.  Unlike just about everyone else around, he wasn't wearing a mask, but his thick, round glasses gave him a wise, quizzical appearance, and white hair was dusted with confetti.  He was in a robe of some sort, heavy and possibly as old as he was.
“Fine.  You harpy.”  Ellen dumped a measure of tea into the cup and thrust it in Jesse's direction.  “Gimme.”
“No,” Steve said.  He looked at Tony, who hadn’t moved.  “No.  My captain-”  He stopped, a bitter smile crossing his face.  “My captain’s been spending freely over the last few weeks, both on himself, and his friends.  Started attending the station’s weekly poker game again, and he’s been racking up some impressive losses without complaint.”
Steve nodded.  “I really thought, if I ever got married, it'd be at city hall, just me and my spouse and a witness in front of a judge, or something.”  He reached out, running a careful finger along the edge of the plate.  “Receptions weren't even on my radar.”
“I’m going, I’m going,” Tony said, his voice full of laughter.  He raised a hand in a wave as he turned and headed off down the hallway.
Tony leaned in.  “I’m watching out for anyone in a uniform,” he said, and Hank rolled his eyes.  “I need to go home before I’m missed.  Can you promise you won’t be raided in the next-”  He made a show of looking around, checking the various clocks that were ticking away on the walls.  “Ten hours or so?”
“That’s what Strange thinks,” Steve said, his fingers braced on the edge of Tony’s workbench.  He leaned into his hands, letting his head fall forward.  His shoulders ached, and he tried to work some of the tension out of them.
Tony sank down to the edge of DJ’s bed, trying to steady his hands, his heart.  He reached out, burying his fingers in Furbro’s fur. “You’d better bring him home,” he said, to the empty room.  “Damn you, Rogers.  You’d better bring him back home.”
Despite that, it took about five steps to realize the obvious.  “You don't know how to dance, do you?" Tony asked, his tone musing.
Steve twisted around on the seat, his helmet braced on his hip.  He grinned up at Tony, holding out a second helmet.  “Hop on.”
He picked up the plate with his other hand, and crossed to set it in front of Steve.  “Thought I’d have this tomorrow,” he said, strangely anxious.  He turned the plate with a twitch of his fingers, centering it on the silver counter in front of Steve.  “So.  Not my best work.”
“Of course Ty,” Tony bit out, tucking his shirt into his pants, as Pepper smoothed his collar down.  “It’s been, what, a whole month since the last time that the deans had to call him out on the carpet.”
“No one asked you to!” Billy yelled after him.  Only after he’d disappeared up past the second floor landing did he turn his attention back to Steve.  “I assume you’re here to talk to the boss,” he said, giving the word a sardonic twist.  “He left last night, after lights out.  Johnny saw him get into a car out front.”
Tony paused, studying him.  "Well, I thought it was your collar, but maybe it's your shorts you've got in a bunch," he said, and Steve choked on a laugh, his face twisting with the force to hold it in.  Tony smirked at him.  "Here, let me check-"  He reached for the waistband of Steve's pants, and Steve skittered sideways, his breath leaving him in a burst of laughter.
Steve’s face relaxed.  “I think you need to lie down,” he said, and before Tony could object, he slipped an arm under Tony’s legs, lifting him up.  “It’s okay.  It’s going to be all right.”
The thug spun around, and Happy snatched the bottle from under his arm and fired it straight at the back of the thug’s head.  It hit a crash, glass shattering in all directions.  “Widow,” he called, his tone almost bored, and his head swung in Steve’s direction.  “Duck.”
“The solarium, right.”  Steve gave DJ’s face a quick once over with the damp towel, then his hands.  DJ stood there, accepting it with his usual stoicism.  “To make sure that the ones that were sick didn’t spread it to the others?”
“It’s not your fault,” Steve said, and DJ tried to say something else, but the words wouldn’t come and Steve was already turning away, his hand still a lifeline on DJ’s arm.  DJ reached up, covering Steve’s hand with his.  For now, it was enough.
