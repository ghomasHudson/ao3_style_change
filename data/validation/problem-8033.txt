The conversations were rather idle as they were finishing the main course. Sam ate silently, obviously starving, while Steve was asking about the shop. When they were done, Natasha stood up again, holding her drink in her hand. Something tender and pleased glinted in her eyes, she was almost blushing. Everyone turned to her, waiting for her to speak but she remained silent and sat back on her chair while putting a hand on Sam's shoulder. All eyes were on her, hung up on the movements of her lips.
Tony chuckled at that and turned around, fully awake now. He nuzzled against Steve and grabbed his head in his two hands. Big brown eyes plunged intently into Steve's eyes. "I really need to pee, now." He repeated, his mocking smile spread wide on his face. "But we have all day..." His voice was hoarse, sensual and full of promises. Enough for Steve to forget about it.
As expected, dinner was just a pretext to get intoxicated and maintain good professional relationships. The contract was practically a done deal. Tony had talked about three minutes at most and didn't even have the time to present the basics. It didn't matter that he had busted his ass off the entire afternoon for this fucking presentation. He was curtly cut short by his own begetter under the superior stares and mocking laughs of the round table. He swallowed his pride and pushed the unnecessary feeling of uselessness that kept bugging him at the back of his head.
Something melancholic like regrets or the nostalgia of possibles never attempted.
"What if my dad or Obie took care of it before I heard about it. They're both dead now. I'll never know." Tony almost sounded panicky. Steve could feel his heart racing in chest. He didn't know what to do, so he shut him up with a kiss. Tony startled but it worked and Steve gave him a gentle, comforting smile filled with all his love.
They didn't have sex for two weeks after that.
Tony laughed out loud, throwing his head back and Steve felt a lot lighter. "Nothing of the sort I'm afraid. Just boring SI paperwork, sorry to disappoint."
"I don't believe you."
"You need to stop this." Tony says embarrassedly.
I'm really sorry about that but it seems my writing abilities are really too limited to grasp the depth and the entirety of Tony's agony. In other words, it may appear bland and boring and repetitive. Sorry about that... You'll get a rough idea, at least.
"You're hungry?" She said as she disentangled herself from his grasp.
Steve kisses him when Tony finally knots him. He's kissing him. The omega's lips so soft and loving. There is a smile on those lips.
Tony had no answer to that question. He just thought that the deviant glow in that guy's eyes reminded him of Obie, that this man's dangerous wickedness was both entrancing and terrifying. He wondered why he was always attracted to the same kind of guy. Or was it the other way around? He also knew that he was probably gonna do everything that guy wanted him to do either way. Tony was fucked up like that. His breathing accelerated.
It's Bucky who kissed him first. They were watching a movie on their couch. Felicia was finally asleep. As soon as Bucky came back from the room he shared with his daughter, Steve pulled him by the hand and yanked him down on the couch next to him. Bucky startled and they both burst out laughing. They sat very close, rubbing their warm scents on each other. Bucky was hunched up, like he often was in this century. Steve had snuggled closer and brushed his knuckles on the Omega's knee. The slight touches turned into caresses and Steve was sliding up his thigh, fondling his hips and his waist. Bucky had turned his head to him and snuggled into his neck, blowing warm air against his sensitive skin, making him gasp and shiver. His fingers, soft and warm, reached Steve's bonding gland and he brush his thumb on it, sending jolts of electricity through his skin and down his spine. Steve gasped and Bucky nudged on his chin, turning his face slowly. Their mouths touched, drawn to one another like magnets.
"You have?" Steve croaked out, eyes curious, looking up and searching Tony's. Tony pushed into him again, grinding and making Steve gasp. Steve wondered why he kept struggling. He knew he would succumb in the end. He always had and Tony was attacking him, pinning him against the wall, leaving no chance for Steve to escape. Not that he wanted to. He just... He just didn't want to do this at work. "They'll know what we're doing."
want this to happen. He wanted to see Steve. "Please..." He unwillingly let escape in a shuddering breath, looking away.
Steve told him about his childhood and his dreams and his friends and Bucky. And they talked like this for a couple of hours, lying in Steve's bed, the sexual tension between them slowly appeasing.
"Did he reject you?"
Tony would swallow the cum of twenty-three men before he left this place. That was a good, relatively feasible objective, he thought.
Tony's eyes opened wide before narrowing into a frown. "Why not?"
He thinks...
"Aren't we?" Tony said, surprisedly.
He was losing Steve. If not today then soon. How could he not? Steve gave him everything and he couldn't give anything back. He kept pushing him away. How long until Steve gave up on him like Pepper had? Steve would be much better off without him anyway. Steve deserved so much better than a disappointment like him. He was a mess.
"It's kinda weird being parents before being a couple but... I'm really invested in this."
Tony giggled. "I'm not always available and besides, we could have used them together."
His boyfriend interrupted him again by kissing his neck, drawing a gasp out of Steve. He grabbed both his wrists and pushed him against the bar behind them. Steve's back hit the bar and it hurt a little. He gasped again and parted his lips. He had never seen his boyfriend so angry and so out of control before, at least not directed at him. He realized how strong he was, way stronger than him. Tony could manhandle him like a puppet. Steve hated that a little and at the same time, he thought that was really hot, but maybe that was the alcohol talking. Tony's mouth was on him again, devouring him, and Steve instinctively wrapped his arms around him.
The alpha's voice is so sensual, hoarse and tired but strong and comforting. His entire body vibrates at the sound. He feels heat pooling at the pit of his stomach and spread through his vein like fire.
can hold my liquor, for one." Although he just looked and sounded as tipsy as Steve.
"We met in a club." Steve blurted, sounding bored, trying to cut the conversation short. He was really hoping they would drop it when they heard how banal it was. He didn't want to share.
Tony looked down and nodded silently. He had recovered enough of his strength now, even though the uneasiness wouldn't go away, crushing him down relentlessly. He let himself fall into the man's fatherly embrace and snuggled against him, seeking the safety and comfort that his arms used to be to him. Obie indulged him for a short moment, he curled his arms around him protectively, pressing Tony against the warmth of his body. Only for a short moment, Tony's heart had barely started to settle down when he pushed him away, grabbing his face again.
Tony feels something weird inside, maybe it's the melancholy in Loki's eyes. He glances at Steve behind him. Steve is still annoyed with him, he glares back and turns away, ignoring Tony.
Steve spat in his hand and grabbed his own cock. It was a bit rushed, a bit clumsy, nothing like he had imagined their last time in this bed would be like, but Tony could take him and it went in smoothly, despite the lack of lube. Steve bent over his boyfriend and kissed his hairy chest, bit his soft skin at times, gave a lick to his nipples. Tony panted and gasped and shivered, body tensing under him. Steve grabbed his neck with his two hands and kissed him languorously while thrusting slowly inside of him, making love to him hard and deep. Tony's legs spasmed and jerked, his toes curled while he kept panting into Steve's mouth, eyes closed. It was so fucking amazing Steve's mind went blank, he didn't control anything anymore. He just fucked inside his boyfriend relentlessly with all his strength, with all his love. He was already so fucking close.
Tony shrugs. "We don't!" He exclaims, taking another drag and blowing the smoke in front of him. It's already starting to take effect. Time feels slower and he wants to giggle with no reason.
That Tony was a coward? His dad's puppet? A wimp?
Steve hurried his pace when he heard a rattling noise behind him and then a few voices. One of them he recognized. They had seen him go out on his own probably. If they caught him, he would fight back and he would lose and they would punch the shit out of him, they wouldn't pass on such an opportunity. And fuck, he wasn't in the mood to get beaten tonight.
He flashes his most alluring smile. "Hi, I'm Tony. I'm Steve's boyfriend."
"But—"
Once inside, Steve made a beeline for the gargantuan buffet and grabbed something to eat before his first drink. It was gonna a loooong night and Steve had low alcohol-tolerance. He sighed in advance while watching his boyfriend mingle with the crowd like it was his second home. He envied his social ease so much right now.
Steve watched, eyes half-lidded, at the chocolate melting in his boyfriend's mouth and wondered when eating chocolate had become so sexy and sensual and felt his cock harden. "Magnesium..." He whispered. "is an antidepressant."
Tony chuckled. He twisted his mouth and nodded in some sort of amused agreement and he gave Steve a wide and gentle smile while reiterating his demand silently, a shy hand offered confidently.
Steve's face cringes with regrets and a glimpse of hurt flashes across his eyes.
Nothing else was said.
He's not sure he can.
Like he said, he's fine.
He chuckled, a little startled. As if it was that simple. He didn't even know what he wanted and it wasn't like they were that close. And Steve hadn't presented yet, anyway. Why would anyone want a boyfriend like that? Besides, he wasn't interested, like
"I figured the two of you had been messing around, not that you two had a
"That's different. You're still fresh and peppy like the morning dew on the supple velvety petals of newly-blossomed flowers."
Steve lets go of Bucky's shaft to focus on his ass and slips his thumb inside. He pushes deeper until his whole hand is sucked in and buried inside the omega. Bucky grinds on his fist and completely forgets about his neglected cock, he's completely gone and the sight of it is intensely maddening. Steve's mind goes blank. Bucky moans and seeks pleasure on Steve's hand. The alpha behind them grows feral and his scent spikes wildly, with it a surge of pheromones that fill the nest with alpha claims. He growls, the sound resonating deep inside the two omegas, and slicks flows out of them both like a flood.
Bucky grimaced. "Huh, yeah maybe. Or perhaps I was just drunk and high on adrenaline and you were cute."
He got up anyway, lids half-open and sticky with sleep, and rubbed his unfocused eyes before heading for the kitchen. Tony was there, in his usual spot, his usual cup of coffee smoking next to him and his right hand raised up on the table, holding an unlit cigarette.
"Yeah..." Tony laughed. "For two weeks or something." He shook his head. "Nah, we're better as friends."
Steve put the cup of coffee on the side table and sank into the huge comfy couch that took over half of their lounge area. Knees bent and bare feet on the edge, he took his laptop and opened it again, decided to do this once and for all.
"No, actually." Tony said matter-of-factly, rummaging through the box. "As much as it might sound weird to you... I've never really been into that. I mean shoving cold and rigid plastic things up my own ass is not something that particularly turns me on.  I like anal sex, like
He steps inside, silently, mentally preparing himself for this. When he is finally inside, he isn't submerged by the cloud of omega scents, for once. The atmosphere is rather peaceful in fact, like a warm and welcoming home.
This was completely different.
Steve grits his teeth. He suddenly feels spiteful to the other omega. "I don't know, you tell me!" He spits. "You're the only one who's had the opportunity to share a heat with Alpha. How blown was your mind then?"
He's not as immature as to actually go sulking at the end of the couch but almost. He just half-listens to the conversations while sipping his third drink and tries not to stare too much at his boyfriend. He doesn't particularly want to look creepy and he's got the feeling that he's on the verge of it. So when Clint leaves again to fetch more food, Tony follows him to the kitchen. One because he needs another drink and two because he just wants to escape this conversation. Steve and him should host dinner parties more often, he just thinks, this way when he feels like fleeing again he could just sneak out to his workshop.
"Not your fault."
Tony narrowed his eyes, considering Steve's answer and nodded understandingly. "I see..." Then tilted his head on the other side, looking like he had some kind of hidden agenda. He smiled gently, a mischievous glint in his eyes. "What about you?"
to shower and get prepared for their day at work. Steve mechanically poured some shampoo on his head, a little out of it, and washed away the remnants of stress and grief that last night had stirred up. He was lost in his thoughts for a few moments and then he looked at his boyfriend worriedly, still feeling some weird tension between them. Tony kept rubbing and rubbing himself at the same places as if to remove some imaginary stains from his skin. Steve watched him silently, he was unusually tense and his hazy, unfocused eyes pooled with something far and forlorn. He pressed his hand on his heart, Tony snapped out of it and his eyes focused on him. Steve took the washcloth from his hand and stared up into his eyes, strong and determined.
"I hope my son is treating you well." She says after a cordial chat. "He better be." She adds threateningly. "And you two better be using protection." They hear her say as she heads upstairs, to the bathroom. "No child-conceiving under my roof!"
"I will."
He took a drag and looked at Steve again, hands back on the iron bar, as he puffed out the smoke in Steve's direction. "I don't know...
I know I haven't put much effort into this fic but if you still enjoyed it I'd love to get your feedbacks. ;-)
Steve doesn't seem to give a shit tonight however and Tony wonders if he should make out with Clint a little, to get his attention, but he pushes the stupid thought away. That would be the mature thing to do, he reckons, and he wouldn't have had the time to do it anyway because Clint has already whirled away and left him puzzled at the entrance while his boyfriend is walking toward the living room, curled up in Loki's embrace, both of them laughing. He looks at the scene with a certain aloofness, that same feeling of disgust pooling in his stomach, and finally mutters up the courage to join everyone. Everyone being Thor, Bucky and the happy couple reunited. He suddenly feels the urge to leave.
Tony smiled and brought his two hands to his face in half desperate, half-frustrated gesture. "Oh my gosh, Steve!" He exclaimed. "How blind can you be? I saw the guy twice and even
He needs a push. Steve will give him the push.
He knows it. He can
Steve gaped at him, dumbfounded and unable to answer the question. His heart was beating so fast he thought it was going to explode. It almost hurt. He stared at the alpha silently, face growing pale and wary. He knew he was.
"You've got the sweetest mouth," Steve grunted, fist flying over Tony's cock. "I don't know what I like better — feeling it around my cock or hearing you say my name—"
"Shh, shh, I've got you," Steve whispered. "We're gonna go nice and gentle here, mister, and that's the only way this is gonna go, ya hear?"
Usually a break like this would've tightened Tony right back up, but when Steve swirled his fingers he was pleased to see that Tony was still soft and giving around his fingers. Steve's third finger slid in with little resistance, and he had to take a minute to marvel at the ease of Tony's body, soft and sucking and eager around him. He scissored his fingers apart, basking in the low, shuddering moan that Tony gave, and made a mental note to bring this up again at a later date.
Tony sniffed again. "I know it's— it's stupid, and I don't expect you to feel the same way—" he started.
Tony nodded. "How comfortable are you with anal, darling?" he murmured, fingertips sliding against the cleft of his ass. "I don't— don't have to fuck you, or anything, but a little bit of prostate stimulation works wonders, a-and it can be rather intense."
Tony and Steve shared a look. It wasn't often they could both be genuinely surprised on a mission these days, but trust Clint Barton to be the one to do it. "I daresay my dear Hawkeye, I think that's the most I've heard you say in a month," Tony teased, albeit gently.
," Tony moaned, clutching tightly at Steve's forearms. "Mm, honey, m'so full. T-thank you," he slurred. "
, a bit less overwhelming now that Tony was just lying there enjoying the show, but at the same time he missed Tony's fingers on him, his most intimate places, the ones that Tony always seemed to be able to coax the most explosive pleasures from. Tony hummed, pressed a kiss to the underside of Steve's jaw, and he had to drop his cock from the sudden need growing in his belly. "
"We need-" Tony wasn't sure, but Steve's face might have been flushed again, and his eyes looked a little dark in the dim light of the tent. "We need to get you on a training regimen for whenever you're out of the armor."
," Tony moaned, shaking.

Tony smiled and rolled over, sliding down over the length of Steve's apparently naked and very
"Yeah, you look so sweet," Steve replied dreamily. "You did so great, tonight, sweetheart. I wanna thank you again." Tony squirmed, tried to wriggle out of Steve's hold, but Steve held firm, kept toying with the curls at the nap of Tony's neck. "No, you really did, Tony, you were so good. You took me so well, kept all of that come stuffed inside you for so long." A finger reached down to toy at the plug and Tony jerked, batting gently at Steve's chest. "Sorry, couldn't resist," Steve said unrepentantly, booping Tony on the tip of his nose. Tony grumbled, and Steve made a soft noise, gentling his movements so he could brush his fingers over the plug without Tony tightening up beneath him. "I'm gonna carry you to the tub now. You gonna be alright to keep the plug in for a little longer?"
"I didn't
, even though that was the point of the whole damn thing, its unrelenting back and forth motion, how it drilled against his prostate, the vibrations singing along his inner walls. Tony hiccuped and, humiliatingly enough, felt tears pricking at the corners of his eyes, even as Steve repeated
of it all rushing out of him, the leftover lube and come and whatever else might have been lurking in his colon. There was a bit of cramping (but there always was), a couple of embarrassing noises that should've had Tony stuttering out apologies, but Tony was so tired and just so... soft, at the moment that he could do little more than flush, and duck his head against his shoulder.
"Count on it," Steve said, and held on tight.
"Basically the pleasure center of the brain," Jan told Steve apologetically. "It's responsible for short term memory, hormone regulation, your pain perception and sleep regulation, emotional regulation and decision-making—"
Steve snorted and shook his head. "Jumped right over the railing, about a dozen floors down," he replied, brushed his thumbs across the dainty skin on Tony's brow. "You feel like you're gonna be sick again?" Steve asked gently, and Tony shook his head.
Tony grows increasingly feral, his entire body shaken with rage and hunger. His hands tremble.
Tony waved him goodbye from behind the windowpane and Steve's heart fluttered with love.
Steve sighed resignedly. He knew that. "I can't really give you a tour right now, you know."
It's not long before the hurried steps of Felicia echo down the corridor and the door slams open. Steve feels overwhelmed by a surge of happiness but he doesn't know if it's coming from him or from Bucky.
Still, that doesn't change the facts. James is locked up. In a luxurious prison, admittedly, but a prison nevertheless. And James loves him, surely he does. He accommodates. Maybe he aspires to a semblance of life. Loving the man who keeps you captive, loving the sire of your pup, really seems like the easiest thing to do.
Steve's knees trembled. He was out of breath and his lungs were still burning. He still felt dizzy with the lack of air. He exhaled a long sigh, feeling so relieved to see Tony here, in the middle of nowhere, Brooklyn.
Steve startles and then he looks at his boyfriend questioningly. "It will feel better for you if we don't." Tony explains. Steve trusts him. They have always used condoms before, even though they both got tested, together, Tony insisted. Steve remembers oh so well the pack of condoms and the talk his mom threw at him when she realized his boyfriend was an omega. This has never been part of the plan, but tonight... Tonight is different because it's gonna be Steve...
He collapsed on the floor, breathing heavily. He was completely out of breath without even doing anything. His body hurt everywhere, aching as if he just had a two hour PE session—the last time he had had PE sessions must have been in primary school though. The heat was unbearable.
They made sure she wouldn't touch an omega. Ever. For years she had been nauseous every time she met one. For years she wanted to kill them or to hurt them. For years she had denied her instincts and forgotten.
After a cold shower, Steve still had the sensation that his body was burning and he was still shivering. He took his temperature, it was just above normal but nothing catastrophic.  His head was spinning. He staggered back to his room, his knees wobbling and collapsed on the floor again with a sudden flash of heat spreading in his body. It was burning everywhere and his skin prickled and hitched and he wanted to tear it off and scratch it. He started wriggling and whining uglily on the floor before he finally got a grip on himself and climbed onto his bed, completely naked.
Three weeks later, SI tweeted about the release of the next Avenger movie.
"I told you I have a date." She said in a falsely exasperated tone.
Tony is so handsome above him, so focused and careful and his face is flushed with pleasure. It feels amazing to have him. It is fulfilling in a way Steve has never imagined. He lets everything go and abandons himself. His boyfriend is a fantastic lover, he thinks, before his mind goes blank.
Steve!" Tony snapped, eyes flaring. "I did it with Stane..." He added, eyes challenging and dignified. "Is that what you want?"
submissive right now, though.
"I can't believe you've left all of this here, all this time." He exclaimed as they were taping the boxes. "There's still so much space on our bookshelves that you haven't used."
Steve parted his lips apologetically. He felt guilty. If Tony had never come here, it probably was because of him. He would have visited the place way before if it hadn't been for Steve, knowing Tony, even if Steve had never worked there. Tony had been a fanboy way before the Avengers and Captain America became a thing. Way before they even knew each other...
Steve chuckles and looks down, stepping back a little. "I thought red roses were a symbol of love."
Tony straightened up and looked up at him, eyes intent. His smile was mischievous. "And I fully intend to get out of here looking like this and I do hope people will know exactly what we've done. And I wished you'd come onto my face and into my hair, so everyone would know how much of a slut I am. And they'll know that I belong to you, and that I'm your bitch. I want you to mark me and tattoo "property of Steve Rogers" on my face..."
Steve abruptly turned his head to his friend, looking at him sidelong, half skeptical, half curious.
"I'm not really sure what my type is actually..." Steve finally said as some sort of explanation.
"And I've been living here for almost a year and a half now. Why wait any longer? This is my home, now. I feel
"I remember everything." Tony said softly, although he meant it. "I mean, when I'm sober..."
When he raised his head again, two green eyes were glaring at him and red, soft, full lips were twisted at him annoyedly. "Hands off my date, Rogers." Steve startled at the challenging aggressiveness in the tone although she was smiling teasingly. She tilted her head seductively, cooing at Tony like only women could, and swayed her hips slowly with a gesture of her hand that meant
Steve yelled.
Time for packing up and moving out
Steve blushed—although that body reaction was surprising because if there was one thing Steve was not ashamed of, it certainly
"Move in with me." Tony insisted, unyielding. "You can keep your place still, if things turn sour you can always go back. What's the worst that can happen?"
He's a failure. A sad excuse for an alpha and for a human being.
"Are you gonna make coffee?" Tony said in the distance, tone a little too presumptuous, leaving Steve do all the work.
"I know how you're feeling right now." Howard's sugary voice said. "I've been young too, you know. But let me tell you this, as father to son... what you deem absolutely essential right now, will seem completely insignificant in a few weeks... A few months, at most. By the time you reach my age, you'll have eaten so many asses you'll realize they all taste the same. We're
Steve came quickly, there was too much anger between them, too much frustration, and when he tried to get up and return the favor, Tony pushed him back down on the table and fucked into him relentlessly until he came inside. This time there wasn't any pleasure. When his boyfriend spurted inside, he planted a soft kiss on the nape of his neck and when he was done, without a word, he pulled out, pulled up his pants and left him there.
"Because he was..." Tony blurted, matter-of-factly. "I still think your relationship with him was the healthiest relationship you've had. He was perfect for you."
"Break us up?" Steve specified. "You never tried anything funny. You were weirdly distant, in fact. Although you wouldn't have had to work hard for it, you know... "
"Are you a man of your words?" He challenged, voice hoarse and heated.
Tony made a cute grimace, tilting his head on the side, an undying grin on his face. "You didn't tell them?"
"I don't deserve you."
Steve jerked his head on the side. His eyes met the mischievous glint in his boyfriend's gaze. Tony had a fond smile on his lips. "What?"
Right.
Bucky turns back and looks at him from the corner of his eyes. "Yeah, Alpha. If you want us, then bond us." Steve is so grateful for the other omega's natural seductiveness. He's getting his way with Tony—and with
"It's okay to have a crush, Stevie."
"Mama?" Steve said softly, feeling suddenly filled with courage. "There's something I need to tell you." She turned an attentive ear to him and stared at him with a gentle and expectant expression. "I think I like alphas..."
Tony shook, but kept his thrusts slow and shallow. "You're— you're not too sensitive?" Tony rasped, whining as Steve tried to suck on his tongue. "Steve you just came like three times, you usually need a break—" Steve shook his head, rocked them both with the force of it, and clenched down tight on Tony's cock. "
Steve's hand froze on Tony's hip. He leaned in close, brushed his lips over the shell of Tony's ear. "Did you like that, Tony?" he murmured, dragging his tongue over the soft cartilage.
, Steve."
, and it slapped back against his belly hard, splattering precome as it moved. Steve moaned again, low in his throat. Tony dove down then, lifting Steve's legs and bypassing his cock altogether, and Steve nearly shouted when he felt Tony's— hot—

and it was still so high? God, how long was Steve going to have to deal with this? How much of Steve's life was this nasty drug going to eat up? Were the Ultimates
, something he could wear under his clothes and could touch when he wanted to think of Steve and how he thoroughly owned him—
, at the core of him, like clean cotton and tea, and feeling Steve bury his face into Tony's hair and breathe in deep brought all of those warm, fuzzy feelings to the surface again.
Tony's breath hitched and he clenched his hole, tried to keep anymore of the come from dribbling out. "Y-yeah," he whispered shakily. "Really f-full."
After another quick check on Steve, Tony ran through a mental list of everything they'd need to ride out this stupid drug. He'd need to run across the hall to his room for supplies; they would need towels, condoms, and lube, maybe some dental dams if Steve was feeling adventurous enough to let Tony put his tongue in his ass. Would Steve be lucid long enough for Tony to get him to shower? Tony wasn't sure, so he'd need a box of wet wipes, as well.
, Tony thought fervently, let the slick sounds of their— of their lovemaking overtake the room, let himself moan and cry and gag around Steve until Steve spilled down his throat and lips once again.
"I'm the lucky one," Tony murmured, shutting his eyes against the tight well of emotion rising up inside him. When Steve leaned over to kiss him again, Tony moaned, let Steve lick into his mouth, take what he wanted from Tony. He could feel his orgasm building, the tight, steady pressure building in his cock and his balls, how the pressure in his stomach seemed to… enhance everything, from the rolling fullness in his belly to the heat in his ass, his cock. Tony whined, shouted, felt tears prick at his eyes. "Steve, I-" Tony gasped, clenched his hands into fists to keep them from shaking. "
"I have something to show you," Steve murmured, lips brushing against the sharp of cut of his jaw, his neck. And Tony was‒ Tony was writhing on the couch beneath him, skin practically tingling from the light touches Steve was brushing across his ribs, his ass, his dick. "I think you're gonna like it," he continued lowly, teeth just slipping out to graze a nipple and Tony jerked, his cock feeling suddenly, inexplicably
Tony's nasty, vicious brain thought, and Tony bit down hard on his tongue.
Something was very much not right here.
, Tony thought wildly, gritting his teeth against the heat in his eyes. Steve clenched around him again, and Tony moaned so loud it echoed in the room around them.
"I don't say anything I don't mean, Tony," Steve murmured against his lips. He cupped Tony's jaw, softened it so they could make out again, a leisurely twist of tongues and soft, spit-slick lips. "Y'think I'd fluff you up just to get a good suck?" Steve's hard, heavy cock bumped the underside of Tony's balls, skidded against his perineum and slid against the crease where his ass met his thighs. Tony made a soft, wanting noise. "You've earned everything I said tonight," Steve promised, dragging his tongue down his chin to mouth at Tony's jaw. "Now let me take care of you, yeah?"
"Okay," Tony whispered gently, sliding his palm along the line of Steve's strong, tense, trembling jaw. "Okay, let's take care of you, big guy, yeah?" He reached down with his other hand slowly, cataloguing his movements for Steve, and laid his palm to Steve's wet, sticky thigh. God, he was so hot, and tense, his muscles quivering under his skin like he couldn't bear to hold himself still. As Tony's hand slid upwards, drifting to the crease of his groin, Steve shuddered and moaned, his whole body uncoiling. "Yeah, big boy, that's it," Tony cooed, soft and soothing, and never letting go of his face. "Just— just think of whoever you need to to get through this, yeah? Everything's going to be okay." Then Tony's hand was on him, the whole hot velvety steel length of him, just the barest amount of pressure from the heel of his hand on Steve's dick.
Tony frowned, walked back over to his desk, and downed the rest of his drink. "I have an appointment," he muttered, grabbing his wallet and phone.
"It did seem to help stabilize him before," she said, chewing on her lip and flipping through some papers on her clipboard. "Intense physical activity seems to help with all the hormone fluctuations. Please keep the heart rate monitor and pager on you, Captain Rogers, and call us if your vitals exceed the threshold we discussed earlier."
It took him a minute to answer, and Tony nearly cursed aloud when he noticed the time. "Good morning, darling, so sorry to wake you. Would you be a dear and push my chemo appointment back to Friday? I anticipate I'll be incapacitated for a few more days." He had a few more directives for Jarvis: make sure everything was still on track for the new treatment plan, when Steve's next thermos of calorie-fix would be delivered, things like that. Eventually, there was nothing left to talk about with his butler so Tony let him go with a sigh and a small frown. Lulls were never easy for Tony, he just... wanted to make time move quicker, wanted the drug to run through Steve's system faster, wished he'd at least thought to bring a damn book or tablet so he could actually work on something until Steve needed him again—
"When are you gonna come, honey?" Tony asked, and Steve felt the barest of touches on his balls.
"Y-y-yes-s," Steve stuttered, shivering and rolling his head against Tony's neck. He clung even tighter than before, his thick thigh and calf muscles flexing on either side of Tony's hips. "Oh, Tony,
"Well, good," Steve replied, reaching out one hand to flick his fingers lightly against Tony's. "That's the whole point of this."
better," he sniped, wishing he hadn't left his drink outside. "Cap, you— you never forget mission briefings. Are you sure you're okay?"
Part of it was he didn't want to stare, to make Steve uncomfortable or anything of the sort (Maybe -
for you." Then he was sitting up, fumbling in the bedside table for the lube they kept there, and when Steve laid back down, knocking their foreheads together, Tony wasn't at all surprised to find warm, slick fingers rubbing at the cleft of his ass, between his cheeks, circling around the edge of his hole. Wet fingers flicked the straps of Tony's garter belt, then unclipped them oh-so-gently, leaving them to lay against Tony's thighs and Tony moaned, the sharp humiliation of it crawling up his neck in a hot flush, like he really was Steve's toy, something to be fucked and used and‒
"God, Steve, whatever you want," Tony replied, and Steve gasped, hand sliding out of Tony's boxer briefs and Tony could've
"Ready, Shellhead?" Steve asked, fingers playing with the straps of Tony's garter. He could feel Steve shifting, could feel the the rasp of the fishnet and tulle miniskirt scraping his legs and ass and thighs and then there was the blunt pressure of Steve's cock, hot and ready for Tony to take.
"You know you don't need to do this, right?" Thor asked him, gently.
Steve snorted, knocked his heels against the backs of Tony's calves. "Yeah, alright, Mister Smooth Talker," he teased, nosing in against Tony's skin again. "I'm still gonna thank 'ya, though."
"Yeah, I've got you, Tony," Steve said, played his fingers around the head. He leaned forward, mouth falling open so his tongue could dart out to lap at the precome there.
"God, Tony," Steve moaned, low and breathy, and wrapped his large hands around Tony's waist so he could lift and drop Tony at his leisure. "God, look at you, all the way in me," Steve groaned. "You took me all the way, honey, just like that. You're so- so beautiful-" And then Steve was moving, fucking his hips up as he slid Tony's ass down, and Tony was sobbing into Steve's skin as he began to move in earnest, the wet smack of skin against skin, Steve's high-pitched whimpers, the squelch of lube between their bodies. "Oh, honey, you feel so good," Steve whispered, pressing a kiss to Tony's brow as he sped up, and Tony tried to clench down, tried to give Steve that extra oomph he always enjoyed when he topped, but he was just so, so loose, and so deep down it was all Tony could do just to hold on and let Steve thrust up into him faster, faster than the fucking machine, than he'd ever let anyone fuck him before.
"Mm, let's take care of that first, darling," Tony purred; when he ground his hips backward, Steve snorted and smacked at the side of Tony's ass, and Tony felt a lash of liquid-hot pleasure shoot through him. Tony moaned, luxuriating in the ache of it, and then clapped a hand over his mouth in a belated attempt to stifle it.
"W—we don't," Tony's teeth chattered, and he had to consciously stop his hips from rolling into Steve's hand. "—This isn't about me, Rogers," he tried again, biting down on a knuckle and sobbing. "I'm not the one who needs an ultramarathon of the bedroom rodeo to keep my body from shutting down, buddy."
, Steve thought, blinking away a rush of humiliating tears.
"Stay right here, honey," Steve said then, pressing a kiss to the sensitive skin behind his ear. Tony shuddered, and nodded, and Steve stood up so he could drag the cushion back off the bed.
"Steve, I'm coming in," Tony warned, twisting the handle and shoving the door open. "Steve, I need you to answer m— oh."
Steve rubbed in hard against his perineum, sped his hand up, and when Tony's orgasm finally hit it seemed to punch through him, stars flashing behind his eyelids, his heart beating out of control in his chest. He might have passed out for a second. When he came to, Steve was holding him in his arms, rubbing a hand soothingly up and down Tony's backside, murmuring sweet endearments in his ear. Tony blinked, slowly, felt the sluggishness in his limbs as he tried to turn further into Steve's hold.
Steve dropped down, his hips sliding down Tony's face and chest as he slid down so they were face to face, Steve's dark azure eyes locked onto him. He licked the come from his face, groaning softly and knocking their foreheads together.
"I love you," Steve whispered back, and Tony could hear the smile in it, those three words that always had Tony's heart twisting in his chest. Fingers slipped through Tony's hair again, curling around the back of his skull, and Steve was kissing him again, his soft plush lips molding Tony like he was made of clay. "I love you," Steve told him again, "and I'm so lucky to have you." When Steve massaged the back of his skull again, Tony felt some of the tension unknot, felt his limbs relax once more into Steve's hold.
Steve did flinch then, jerking his head to the side so he could stare at the wall a few inches from his doctor's face. "Fine," he grunted.
"Green," Tony murmured, twisting to press a kiss to the hinge of Steve's jaw. "Green green green, so green, Steve, yes, please." Steve chuckled, a soft, affectionate thing, and crawled up to the head of the bed, and Tony followed obediently, swinging a leg up and over Steve's knees so he could settle into the vee of Steve's lap, his ass pressed against the hard muscle of Steve's quads. His hips burned but felt open, the way a good hard stretch felt deep in the muscle.
"I'm sorry, darling, I didn't mean to get all maudlin," Tony whispered, brushing his lips to his cheek. "You're not going to remember much of this anyway, so don't you worry, Cap, okay?"
, he was an embarrassment. "P-please, just— can we just finish, Steve?" Tony pleaded, sniffing and rubbing at his face with the back of his wrist. His body
? Tony asked himself, sniffling and coughing and gasping wetly into his hands.
, but he felt good.
"I took advantage of you," Tony whispered, his eyes bright and wet. "Steve, I— I wasn't just doing this out of the goodness of my heart. I-I-I had u-ulterior motives, I took advantage of your predicament because all you needed w-was a warm body, and I—"
Tony off, okay? There was something
on telling Steve to stop (even if it hurt a little and he lost his voice, bruised his throat to hell), but it seemed to comfort Steve to know that he'd thought about it. "Now go ahead and fuck my face, Handsome," Tony murmured, smirking up at Steve with some of his finest Antonio E. Stark charm.
Sometimes Steve wasn't sure he deserved him.
." And Steve's fingers paused in their gentle probing, their soft massage of Tony's inner walls, and he remarked softly, "That's right. I did say that, didn't I, huh?" More cool lube dripped onto his ass, in his hole, sliding slick and wet down Tony's crack, over his balls. Tony hitched a breath, teeth chattering.
Dear God, Tony was going to spontaneously combust. Was he blushing? Was he even
nearly made Steve flinch back in his seat. "You should let the doctor take a look at you, Steve," Tony said gently, so gently it made Steve sick. "I pay a lot of good money to staff people who can handle the type of injuries you get."
On the other side of the lab, a woman in a blue and yellow jumpsuit swung a rifle up at Cap, shouting something angry in Russian and firing a series of rapid-fire darts into the front of Cap's kevlar. Steve grunted and looked down at his chest, unimpressed, before plucking the darts out of his uniform.
"You wanna get off?" Steve asked, and Tony whined, hitched a breath, oh god, he was
"Pretty thing," Steve murmured, one big, warm hand cradling the underside of Tony's jaw. "Look at you, huh?" he hummed, quiet, dragged his thumb against Tony's swollen, plush, come-stained lips. Tony shuddered, all the way down to his feet, toes curling in the soft carpet beneath them. "See, you can be good when you put your mind to it," Steve teased, tapping Tony's mustache, the crinkling of his eyes softening the hard lines of his stern military jaw and cut. "And you are being my very—" Steve leaned forward so he could steal a kiss, "—good—" and another, "—boy," he finished, pulling back so he could lick at a drop of his own come on his mouth.
"Uh‒ uh-huh," Tony mumbled; the sting in his nipples was dizzying, and the feeling of Steve's warm fingers brushing his forearms, the cool slide of leather against his wrists. There was enough slack that he could lay there on his elbows and knees, and the cuffs themselves were just the right side of tight, the way Steve knew Tony liked. If he held himself up, the nipple clamps just barely grazed the edge of the cushion, but Tony knew that wasn't going to be the case for very long ‒ he was going to forget himself and let the cushion take his weight until he felt the sharp sting of the clothespin clamps biting into him and Steve had to jerk on the chain to make him sit up again. The imagery struck Tony, so vividly, and he had to pant and moan and let the fabric scratch against the tight peaks of his nipples as he felt Steve slipping his fingers back in his ass, making sure he was still wet and open.
" Jill was saying. "
"T-that's cheating, sugar plum," Tony whispered, his hands suddenly finding purchase in the back of Steve's shirt. Steve could feel a fine tremble in his hands, one that betrayed just how badly Tony had to want this. Steve hummed and nodded, lips glancing back down across Tony's throat and down to his collarbone. "I‒" Tony hesitated, licked his lips.
," Steve gasped, rolling his hips into Tony's grip. He felt himself flushing, his face going hot with embarrassment, knew it was a bright splash of scarlet across his cheeks. Tony twisted his hand, slid it up from balls to tip, biting at the cord of muscle on Steve's throat. "Tony,
Steve let out a low breath, and nodded, leaning forward so he could reach down into the water. His fingers brushed the base of the plug and Tony gasped, hips twitching minutely before he stilled and spread his legs apart. His body was still soft, and pliant beneath Steve's fingers, and there might have been a groan out of one or both of their mouths as Steve slowly worked the plug out of Tony's body. When the tip of it finally slid out, Tony sighed, softly, let his head tip against the edge of the tub. Even that, just sitting in a bathtub with his soft, fucked-out asshole, was enough to have Tony panting for breath, anxious to close his eyes and just… sleep, for a minute or two.
Steve shook his head. "M' good now," he murmured; and he was, actually. The sharp sting of pain on his sensitive groin area had pulled him back from the brink, and while his cock was still aching, Steve felt like he was no longer in danger of coming. Steve let his eyes flutter shut and let all the air out of his lungs. "M' yours," he whispered.
This had to be payback for that one girl he'd slept with at that New Year's party one year and left before the ball dropped. Oh
"I can't—" Steve choked out, feeling his face heat. It was so— embarrassing, and shameful to Steve, that here he was falling apart from barely a handjob, shaking like a— like a
," he whispered, breath hitching miserably, "because I
"Hey, hey," Steve shushed, brushing a few damp locks from Tony's face. "It's all good, Shellhead. I like seeing you gone on it." And,
The scheduled briefing time came and Tony sashayed his way downstairs to the conference room where Thor, Jan, and Clint were already waiting, but Steve was nowhere to be seen. Well. That certainly put a pause in Tony's step. Had they finished already? "Did Cap step out to get something?" he asked, popping another Zofran under his tongue.
"Can we give him another dose of Adenosine?" Tony asked. He grabbed a tablet off the stack in front of him and started scrolling, trying to make sense of the chemical makeup of the drug from the AIM lab they'd raided. On its own, it looked pretty much like any random drug from the street—an amphetamine-like stimulant designed to bind to various transport proteins—but once it hit Steve's bloodstream, the drug compounded upon itself, twisting and turning and latching onto various cells in his central nervous system and multiplying so fast even the serum couldn't keep up.
gone down, but the percentage is still in the eighties." Two
he needed a break were two very different things, the latter of which often involved Steve bringing out the big guns to get his boyfriend to take care of himself.
One, two, three tears squeezed themselves from Tony's aching eyeballs, cool against his hot and blushing cheeks, and Tony hurriedly sniffed at the sudden wetness in his nose and throat, jerked himself forward so that his lips were pressed to the swell of Steve's sac. His throat spasmed around the girth of Steve, the hot and pulsing cock in his ragged throat and drooling mouth, and Tony's eyes slid shut against the well of emotion he couldn't help but submerge himself in.
Before, Tony would have bet a lot of money on Clint making some snarky comments about Steve getting all dopey-eyed over a couple of chocolate bars, but there was barely a peep from him on the flight home, and Jan had curled up in her seat and passed out five minutes after takeoff. Thor had opted to fly, so it was really just the two of them making idle chit-chat, though Steve's answers were tending towards the monosyllabic today.
Steve's jaw dropped, a soft, rosy flush blooming over his cheeks. "I'm— Hell," he grunted, crossing his arms and leaning back against the door jamb. Steve was a beast of a man, but he looked almost small there, hunched over and looking increasingly like he wanted to either throw up or punch something. "Hell, I'm so sorry, Tony. And— and Thor, I should apologize to him, too."
— "but it was
"—netrative sex for at least four to six weeks," Dr. Nguyen was saying behind the curtain. Steve felt ill. "The stitches should dissolve on their own in about ten days."
, or because you let me wreck your body for the past week. I want to
Steve sighed and stared sadly at Tony over their joined hands. "That doesn't mean I'm gonna stop worrying about you," Steve murmured, "Or being upset when you get hurt."
it." He reached inside Tony's panties, cupping Tony's wet, hot, throbbing cock, and Tony sobbed again from the feeling of it. "D'd'ya think I'd want you t'be here if ya didn't want t'be?"
Steve whined again, soft and almost breathy, and Tony tried not to take it to heart, because Steve was in pain and he was very, very heterosexual, God, just because he was here offering himself up in a silver platter didn't mean Steve
At the first touch to his ass, Steve gasped, and Tony could feel him tense and relax all at once, how he let the tip of Tony's finger slide into him so, so easily. Steve let out a small noise, not quite a moan or a whine, but somewhere in between as he spread his legs and wrapped his arms tight around Tony's shoulder and neck. Tony circled his finger, up to the second knuckle now, and felt the gradual easing of his insides, the hot sucking clench of him. When Tony slipped a second finger in, Steve's voice hitched, and then a low, gravelly moan ripped out of his throat, his hips rolling in slow, undulating waves. His teeth chattered in Tony's ear.
"Steve, come on - at- at least wash your hands darling, you're bleeding all over my clean floor," Tony said with a weak grin; he hesitated, then reached out and grabbed Steve's elbow, trying to turn him towards the direction of the locker rooms. Steve made a small noise, but followed along easily enough, his eyes boring into Tony as he led him out of the gym and towards the sink. He didn't seem to react when Tony pulled his hands under the running water or washed his knuckles off with soap, or even when Tony dragged him to sit on one of the benches, but when Tony pulled out a first aid kit, he seemed to startle out of it, shaking his head.
Steve trembled, his hands fisting in the sheets, and Tony curled his fingers a little tighter, twisted his palm on the upstroke and letting it tighten up as he slid it back down. His cock was so— so red, flushed and and dark and wet, dripping all over the two of them so much that the sound of it echoed around them, slick and sexual. He came maybe twice like that, or maybe the orgasm was just intense, come spurting over his abs and pecs and even up to his collarbone. Steve whined when Tony slid a fingertip through the mess on him and slipped it between his lips, humming at the taste. God, he was delectable. "Mmm," Tony hummed again, bending forward and lapping at the come on his stomach. "Mmmmm."
Tony was quiet for a moment, and then he was squeezing Steve's hand, so tightly, his other hand coming up so he could pet at their interlocked fingers. "Promise?" he asked lowly.
"Yeah, I got you baby," Steve murmured, fingers slipping out and around the round, fat globes of his ass. There was a little more shuffling, and then Steve was unclipping the cuffs from the bed, pulling Tony up to his knees, his front plastered to Tony's back. "I got you, sunshine," Steve murmured. Tony could feel Steve's cock, hot and hard against the small of his back, and he couldn't help grinding back against it, even as it made Steve shudder and moan.
Tony gasped, jolting hard all over, his fingers clenching tight over Steve's forearms, and Steve chuckled, rubbed the tip of his nose to Tony's neck. "
"What?" Tony asked, dumbly.
, it was so fucking hot how Steve could just
. He'd come to terms with his mortality. He'd sold off most of his things. His company was still running, obviously, but he updated his will every week, and Cap and the other Ultimates would never have to worry about funding their escapades. It was— it was so
"I'm ah‒ ah‒ always wet for you, honey," Tony moaned back, hips jerking at the perfect, punishing pace Steve had set for him. "Oh, sugar, pumpkin,
"S-Steve," Tony stuttered. "Darling—"
Steve pressed another open-mouthed kiss to the underside of Tony's jaw before grabbing one of his legs, spreading him almost obscenely so Steve could get at his ass more efficiently, could stroke at the rim of his asshole like he could spend all night there. "I'm gonna take care of you," Steve swore, circling a second finger around the rim, waiting for Tony to open up and let him in. A soft, needy sound wrenched itself from his chest, and he felt brittle and open and so so warm as Steve slid that second finger in. Steve patted Tony's thigh softly and let go of his leg, and then the laces holding his panties together slowly slid apart, leaving Tony's ass half exposed as they pooled and dragged around his hips. Tony moaned and there was more lube slipping onto Steve's fingers and into his ass and Tony sobbed against the sensitivity, spreading his legs and lifting his ass so Steve could fuck into his ass a little more.
Tony didn't take nearly enough time for himself.
," he moaned, low and throaty, two fingers dipping in to flick at his sensitive inner walls before slipping out to start jerking at his cock.
, Tony thought affectionately, something soft and tender blooming in his chest. "I happen to like a little pain from time to time," he said aloud, a low, rumbling purr, scooting closer to Steve on his knees. "Cap, darling- Steve," he whispered, "I— I know it's very hard to concentrate right now, but I want you to be very sure this is what you want-"
Steve bit his lip again and twisted the doorknob to the bedroom, sliding one arm around Tony's waist to lead him gently in. Tony saw it almost immediately, right at the foot of the bed, and‒ Oh. Huh.
"Hey, hey," Steve shushed, leaned forward to curl his free hand around Tony's jaw so he could pull him closer, slot their lips together for a hot, wet, messy kiss. "Your face is already bruised up, Shellhead, I don't wanna make it any worse." Steve could see when it hit Tony - that awful, twisted feeling of rejection that always tore him up inside, and Steve kissed his lips again, brushed them across his nose, his cheekbones, in a desperate attempt to try and lessen the sting. "Tony, honey, you know I don't mean it like that, I- sweetheart, I just
Steve beamed. "All for me, yeah," he murmured, bending forward to slip his tongue in Tony's mouth. Tony moaned, surging forward to suck on Steve's tongue, and Steve hummed, driving it in deep, like he could fuck Tony's mouth the way he'd done his ass. "Gosh, I'm lucky," he hummed as he wrapped the rest of his hand around Tony, started to jack his cock nice and slow. Tony knew his cock didn't always play nice, especially when he kept himself from tipping over the edge for any extended period of time, but Steve also knew how to get his body to work with them, knew just how to finger Tony, or keep the pleasure steady and work him up slowly so his body could reach that peak.
Steve moaned and bit down on his lip, but he shook his head, brushing the hair from Tony's face as he put them at arm's length. "Not tonight, Shellhead," he whispered, darting in quick to suck on the edge of Tony's ear, like he couldn't quite help himself. "We are gonna get you nice and‒ and wet, and ready for me, and then I'm going to fuck you." Someone whined, and Tony realized with a jolt of mortification that it was
"Please, Tony," Steve mumbled, biting at his lip before mouthing messily at Tony's collarbone. "Please, please,
. "I was thinking we could get our legs waxed," he whispered, voice low and husky; he dragged one fingernail up the inside of Tony's arm from wrist to elbow, delighted at the prickling of gooseflesh along his skin. "Maybe do our nails?" Steve continued, teeth catching the sharp line of Tony's jaw. "Get all dressed up?"
Tony sighed, kicked his socked heel against the tile floor. "Who else is going to do it?" he asked, even though his chest was burning with selfish possessiveness.
They'd gone out to Iwasaki, a quiet little Japanese place along the river. The bitter chill of fall had set in, rain glazing the streets of New York grey, so they'd sat in a corner booth, staring out at the hazy evening sky, Steve polishing off a few bowls of chankonabe, Tony having a far more reasonable light cream stew. On the drive home, Steve had peppered kisses all up and down Tony's jaw, his neck, his face. Then they'd giggled at each other in the kitchen, trading lazy kisses in between pieces of fudge. When they'd finally dragged themselves to the living room in their attempt to watch a movie, Tony had been relaxed enough to let Steve slide his tie from his collar and drape it on the closest available surface, followed by his dress shirt, his undershirt. Steve had pressed him down on the couch and they'd laid there for‒ god, nearly an hour, Tony was shocked to realize, just... necking like teenagers.
"Now you just sit back and let me go to town on your cute little rear," Steve murmured, hands sliding back to grab at the firm globes of his ass. He kneaded at the skin, spreading Tony's cheeks wide so Steve's cock could slip between them and catch at the rim.
"Hey, shh, shh, baby, I know," Tony whispered, fingers trailing along his chest, his ribs. "We went too fast. Let's slow down. Jerk yourself off, darling. Slowly. Gently. Stop before you come."
." And Tony sucked in a breath at that, because Steve wasn't supposed to
—" Tony whimpered, sucking hard on the corner of the blanket.
, he thought desperately, practically shaking under the weight of it all.
"Hey, soldier," Tony purred, rolling his hips down against Steve's before sliding the side of his face against Steve like a cat. Steve gasped and Tony could feel his dick plump beneath him. Between the scrubs and the lotion and the body oil, Tony's skin smelled fresh and sweet and felt slick and soft, but Tony was still secretly pleased that Steve's body had no trouble responding to it. Tony groaned, his groin throbbing, and ground down against Steve's cock again. "You sure this is‒ this is okay?" he asked again in a sudden rush of uncertainty. "You like it?"
, Tony thought frantically as he rooted through the fridge.
"Come on, Tin Man," Steve whispered, knocking their foreheads gently together. "Show me what those dames are always raving about."
, Tony thought deliriously, or maybe it was just the lack of oxygen as Steve's thrusts became shallower, just barely fucking in and out of Tony's throat and blocking off his windpipe. Steve's thighs trembled, his biceps flexed and tensed, and eventually Tony could feel him come, the hot spurt of him dripping down Tony's throat and choking him again as Steve just grinded hard and fast.
," Steve sobbed again, and Tony shushed him, one hand petting his thigh. His tongue darted out, lapping at the sticky, salty sweet wetness on his dick, tracing trails down behind his balls. Tony moaned, slipping one into his mouth, then the other, saliva pooling in his mouth just at the thought of sucking Steve off. "I've got you," Tony murmured, before flattening his tongue and running back up Steve's dick and lifting up to swallow him down.
, hot and wet and already leaking messily into his pants. Steve moaned, jerked under under the touch as Tony's fingers began to move, wrapping and massaging him from balls to tip through the thick leather of his uniform. "I-if we're being honest, I'd really like you to fuck my face right now, tiger," Tony said hotly, looking up from Steve under his lashes. His tongue darted out to wet his lower lip, sucked it between his teeth, and he tightened his grip on Steve's cock. "Would you, honey? Please? Give me somethin' to get me through the next couple'a days? I swear I'll make it so good for you, I-I swear, big guy, I—"
Tony raises skeptical eyebrows at him.
Tony breathed out a whistling huff into Steve's mouth and his eyes flared open. Two dark marbles, pupils blown-out, stared intensely and unsettlingly into his eyes.
"I can't even take a nap in my room without having the horny scents of the two of you messing with my head, Steve. So yeah I know what you want." A pang in his chest. A surge of blinding rage. All he can see now is the two of them fucking each other in their nest, just as fucked-up as his own mind can imagine it. And he has a wild imagination. He knows very well what they want, how they want it and why they want it and fuck no, he's not doing it. "Fuck you. I'm not a fucking dildo."
"Why did the car stop?" Steve blurted, voice panicky.
Tony carried him back to the bedroom and please forgive him if he just liquified with want when he realized his boyfriend was strong enough to carry him with one arm while the other slid the patio door open. They both collapsed on the bed and Steve's body was burning and shaking with desire.
jealous." Tony insisted, curling his arms around Steve's waist. Steve smiled tenderly and tiptoed to give him a gentle kiss on the lips, wrapping his arms around his neck. Tony answered the kiss eagerly and it was passionate, loving and tender.
as flatmates, actually." He said amusedly.
you see. Like, what turns me on is knowing that someone is fucking me. And it's bliss knowing that it's you, by the way. Doing it to myself is just... It's not that I don't feel anything, it's just... It's just
Tony Stark was a genius, that secret hadn't remained a secret for long in their school. He didn't need Steve to get a B-, even if English wasn't his forte. Steve shrugged it off. Maybe Tony needed a friend. Or maybe he thought Steve needed one, which he kind of did actually. Whatever his reasons were, Steve could go along with it. He could do with an extra friend. And he could deal with another rumor about him going at it with yet another alpha. It wouldn't make much difference.
He wanted it now. He wanted everything.
"Because they know you live here?"
Tony grabbed his face in his hand and made him look up. "One hour, that's all I'm asking. We haven't seen each other in four days and I'm leaving tomorrow for Germany."
"Sure. Why don't you help me make them another round?"
Bucky, who was reclining against the trunk, stopped eating, ham and pickles sandwich hanging in the air, half-way to his mouth. He stared up at him with a dubious expression, frowning a little. Sam sat crossed-legged on the lawn, half in the sun, half in the shade. He almost strangled himself on his sandwich. Clint sniggered, sounding surprised.
"Alpha..." Bucky slurs. "You're supposed to take care of us. You're supposed to make sure we're healthy, happy and protected. You can't take that away from us. I want to share my heats with you and Steve does too." Tony's mouth hangs open and his eyes are open wide, fixed in the air. He had probably never considered things from that angle. Bucky feels a bit smug right now.
Tony disentangled himself from Steve's embrace and turned around adamantly, walking away from him. "Where are you going?" Steve asked hurriedly, sounding a little wary.
younger too.
Tony chuckled. "Fucking politicians, indeed." He agreed. "We're gonna have to change the world ourselves, honey. I'd drink to that." Steve snorted, feeling grim. "At least he was generous tonight..." Tony muttered as a bitter conclusion.
"Besides," Clint continues with a mischievous smile. "Someone still dreams about murdering me because of it."
Tony nudges his ribs and grins. "Shut up and give me another drink."
the established order and many things can change in ten years of time. Maybe people were more ready to accept it when it was two female omegas. Still...
Bucky answered with a kick on the knee.
Should I not wear anything?"
"I can't believe, you of all people, wouldn't use sex toys."
"Here, drink this." Obie held him a full glass of pure whisky. "It will help take the taste away."
Bucky!"
His heart skipped a beat. He could feel his boyfriend's breath on his lips and swallowed as he felt a shudder of lust run through him. Now was definitely not the time to play games though. And Steve was starving. And... And Tony was so dangerously close and really,
Tony propped himself up on one elbow and glared at Steve. "I wasn't expecting anything." Tony justified, tone very serious. "I just want to figure this thing out with you and I haven't been disappointed so far."
"Two months ago, I think." Tony wasn't new to this. He had already been tested positive for a bunch of STDs in his short life. He even got syphilis once. A bummer. Tony felt obliged to give her the list of what he remembered. He told her about being on PrEP too. Might be useful.
"You've been slacking off all morning, don't exaggerate, please."
Dark-haired guy startled and then chuckled. "Okay." Then he pressed him against the wall and tore off the rest of his shirt. His determined hands fumbled with his fly and unbuckled his belt. He pulled it off, for ulterior purposes surely, then he grabbed his neck and squeezed possessively. Tony gasped and his eyes whitened. He pushed Tony's head up against the wall and bit the skin of his neck. "Is there something else that's off the list, Greg?" Dark-guy asked in an unexpectedly gentle tone. "Before we really get down to it."
Steve rolled his eyes and averted them. "That's cute how you're embroidering how it all started between us. We hooked up,
"I beg your pardon?" Tony glanced up at his father startled expression but it soon turned into a nasty grin. He laughed and it sounded evil. "I think there might have been a misunderstanding, son. Were you really under the impression that I was giving you the choice?"
"What are you doing back here, alone? Taking extended holidays?"
Steve's heart made a leap. "Can I kiss you?" Tony blurted, his face a little rosy. There was a spike in his scent, strong and heady and nerve-racking.
both of them. They live in his house, they're part of his pack, they belong to him. Their scents belong to him, their bonding glands pulsate for him, they both submit to him and it is beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. Perfect. A blessing. A gift from the gods—or whatever is out there, deciding for him.
"We can't do this here!" He protested, showing but very little resistance to Tony. "It's wron—"
Surely they will and he will welcome death with open arms. A sweet relief.
"I've locked the door."
Steve looks sad and pinches his lips angrily. "I don't need perfect. I know you're not, but you're the one I chose. And I want you and your imperfections and I think you've wanted me with mine too. You used to at least."
Steve is lubed up with slick and cum alike,
"This is not about Bucky." Steve exclaims, a tinge of anger in his composed voice. "It's about us. I want
Steve didn't understand. Just because they roughed him up a little... That didn't mean he was unwilling. Tony had agreed to everything, surely he had, one way or another. He denied it firmly. He thought he did anyway and then he added, "You know I can't go to the hospital." Because a hospital was the last place he wanted to be in right now. He just wanted to go home, have a shower and cuddle with Steve. That was all he wanted. Steve would help soothe his growing anxiety.
Steve opened his eyes wide, startled. He stared at Tony's smile, so warm and gentle, which was growing a little insecure. "I—" he stammered, "I don't know how to dance."
it when they made you drink their piss?"
where I wanna go with you." He paused, catching his breath, eyes determined, burning like two infinite fires. "So, stop treating me like a kid! For
His heart is pounding now and he wants to cry for no reason. He sits back into the couch and tries to pour himself another drink. His feelings are too raw, he needs the numbness. Except the warm and gentle hand of his boyfriend stops him half-way. He turns his head on the side, startled, and is met with a glaring frown.
"I knew it!" Steve exclaimed, falsely bitter. "This was all part of your grand scheme to make me surrender and change my mind about it." He might sound a little wary but he was more amused than anything else.
Tony can be very aggressive in the way he approaches Steve sometimes but when they're in bed together, he lets his mask fall. He's incredibly soft and gentle, and considerate. Steve might have fantasized a lot about being pushed down and fucked but when it comes down to it, he is so glad his first time is happening with an omega. Someone who
He turned his eyes to the computer again, avoiding the burning angry stare of his boyfriend, hoping the videos would help take his mind off it.
"And it's not even about us, Steve," Tony added. "I mean, I don't think you ever realized the impact you have on other people... I mean, how many guys did you turn down, really, thinking you weren't enough or some bullshit like that? I feel so lucky I was able to stand out."
Apparently some other guy was sucking him off now, trying to get him hard. His back was sliding sideways on the wall. He pressed on the guy's head to hold himself up, earned a strangled moan and a gasp. He opened his eyes and looked straight in front of him, tried to anyway. He was met with the perverted shine in the eyes of one of the guys who was leering at them. Tony knew instantly what the guy wanted, maybe he stared back a little too insistently. Finally, someone who would take care of him the way Tony needed. He hoped it would hurt.
Steve could feel his heart beating faster and see the happiness in his boyfriend's eyes that he seemed unable to express into a smile. Steve laughed and bit his bottom lips, feeling his cheeks heat. "But it's not... It's not likely to happen in the time being, right?" He asked hesitantly, waving his hands that Tony still clutched strongly in his.
Later that night, when Steve and Tony left Nat's apartment, the atmosphere was peaceful between them. They were holding hands and decided to go for a walk in the streets of Manhattan before going back home.
for him and always for him.
The next day she wakes up angry and later than usual. The scent is somehow still present. Everywhere. Unbearable.
Because he didn't have a choice.
"So," Sam whispered gently while Steve was lost in thought, staring pensively at the entrance building decorated with colored lights for the occasion, "ready?" Steve startled and jerked his head to him. Sam's smile was soft and encouraging. He nodded and started moving about before Sam interrupted his momentum. "Wait!"
Unless, maybe, if she was a suitable woman to marry...
Now she is turning into a slave too. Slave to her instincts. Slave to the two omegas' scents that fill her home with their
"The way you feel though, doesn't depend on your biology," Sam said understandingly, trying to be open-minded, "you can have a crush on a person, without immediately wanting to jump in the sacks." Steve had no idea what he was talking about. "Even if you're still unsure about yourself, you can still like someone."
"I want you to hold me into your arms," Steve explained, answering his boyfriend's unsaid question, "grab my ass and take me against that wall until my back hurts. And I want to feel your tongue in my mouth the entire time." Remembering being overpowered by Tony's strength last night had just stirred up his fantasies.
Anyone else would only see an angel with Tony's face but Tony... Tony was staring at
Clint pauses and raises an eyebrow at him, arms crossed against his chest. "Good?"
"You shouldn't smoke." Obie said, mildly concerned. "It's bad image for the company. Or if you really have to, then smoke cigars."
"Have you ever been tested for any STDs?"
Tony knows he's pretty and he knows how to use this to his advantage. He's learnt about his sex appeal at a really young age and he's proud to say now, even if he's aged, that very few resist his natural charm. Loki isn't one of those obviously. He wriggles uncomfortably on his butt, looking slightly unsettled for a moment but he still grins at him and melts into the touch. Up for the challenge. Tony's wondering though, if Loki would want Tony to fuck him or the other way around. Personally, if, by some weird chain of circumstances, in some other world where he doesn't belong to Steve, the opportunity would present itself to Tony, he wouldn't mind either way.
With a pang in his chest, he tried to find his way in the huge apartment but couldn't find Tony anywhere and the smell coming from the kitchen was getting painful, not that Steve hadn't lost his appetite at the moment... He was starting to wonder if his boyfriend hadn't just left him hanging when something occurred to him,
"Can I get off—"
Finding himself against has been a long and rocky path. Remembering has been arduous, painful and a constant battle with himself. Now he knows who he is, and he also knows where he stands. He is happy for them, really, he is.
"You're wearing scent-confusers!"
not, he feels like throwing up. It's staggering, shattering him in thousand pieces, devastating to the point he's completely lost his footing and soon he will be utterly out of his depth but he's not freaking out, not freaking out at all.
"You're delusional, Stevie." Sam let out while munching on his sandwich.
Tony swallows and ignores the heat he feels spreading on his cheeks. He jerks his head up and stares right into Clint's eyes. "So what are your projects about?" He still doesn't know what to do with his hands.
"But... But... Why didn't you just rent it?"
The man slipped his fingers into Tony's hair in an attempt to be nice again and complimented him too much so he really needed to quicker the pace and make him come fast.
Tony's entire body shuddered when the man left. He was more shaken than ever and felt like retching. A mix of anger, aversion, confusion and forbidden desire pooling in his stomach. He needed to throw up. He needed to hit something. Everything. For a moment, he saw himself destroying every single thing that happened to be in his office. He did nothing of the sort however, too conscientious, too...
"But I have to keep you in line." The man said in an ominous tone and then added. "To protect you." Tony nodded again. "Especially from yourself," Obie kept on. "I know you understand."
Maybe that's the sly, seductive and mischievous part of him that he hates. It reminds him of... It reminds him a little of... He internally pouts.
His heart skipped a beat when he heard the inquisitive voice of his boyfriend downstairs. "Steve?" He cocked his head out of the bathroom door. "Can you come down a minute?" There was a sort of urgency in the tone, although his boyfriend sounded quite lighthearted, and he hurried down the stairs still naked underneath his towel.
Someone said something like this once.
said that." Tony answered with a sheepish grin.
Thor grimaced, head tilted on the side. "Can't deny it!" He said. "Loki really had it bad." Everyone else nodded.
He paused, mechanically, and stared as his hand before bringing it to his lips, again a reflex. Without thinking he swiveled on his feet and turned around, eyes following the trail and locking on their target as soon as they found it. Steve stared, despite himself. Lips parted and hands shaking a little. He couldn't take his eyes away from the slender figure and gazed at the shape of his nape. He felt goosebumps as he watched Stark's rough fingers entangled in his small hair, touching lightly the back of his head. For a minute he imagined they were
His boyfriend looked miserable, something dark and forlorn was pooling in his eyes. "I'm so sorry..." He whined. Then Steve finally understood what he was talking about, and the relief almost made him smile.
it? What is it?"
It was perfect. More than Steve could ever asked for. Better than he had ever dreamed of. There wasn't only art supplies, there were also... stuff. Inspirational stuff. And models and books and all kinds of items that would help Steve in his work.
Sex has always taken up a lot of space in Tony's life. It used to be a lot of things to him. An escape from his own reality. Sometimes a weapon, sometimes a tool to take control or to use or manipulate people, a mean to get what he wanted... but also a source of comfort and a way to hurt himself. In therapy he's been trying to work on that, trying to consider sex as what it is,
Nothing probably, or maybe them rotting away with a boring routine. Who knew?
Loki repulses him, he thinks. He can't even say for sure that it's something physical, because in all honesty, Loki's pretty hot and Tony isn't only saying that because he has pretty low standards regarding his sexual partners but in other circumstances, he would gladly and definitely fuck Loki. Because, yeah, Loki is admittedly very fuckable, even if he's approaching his forties and a few sexy grayish strands of hair are interspersed on his temples. Besides, Tony likes the way he ties them into a small ponytail at the lower back of his head. Tony always had a thing for older guys anyway, everyone knows that. He does wonder if the haircut would suit him for a minute or two though. Should he change his hairstyle? Steve used to have a thing for guys with long hair after all.
The alpha's thick shaft slip out of his mouth and Steve thinks
"Neither of us are bonded." Steve huffs out with a resigned pout.
Tony opens his eyes wide. Something happens.
"What should I wear?"
"Starving." Steve mumbled.
Two omegas is a living hell. They're gonna be the death of him.
cute." He protested, because objectively speaking he wasn't. He was more of a thorny bush than a delicate flower, per say. Steve paused, reflecting upon the relevance of the comparison. Alphas were usually not compared with flowers, thorny or not, what was wrong with him?
"Why? You don't like roses?"
Tony put his phone down and span around on the caster wheels of his office chair. A shudder of excitement ran throughout his body. He was ecstatic. Celebrating Steve's success... it was huge. Tony was so proud. His boyfriend was finally earning the recognition he deserved. Tony had nothing to do with it but he still saw it as a personal victory. Personal by proxy. At least, things were going great for one of them. Steve deserved it. He deserved the world.
Tony stared at him for a moment, unreadable, a glimpse of confusion in his eyes, and then his features softened. He smiled softly, beautifully. A bright and blissful smile that you could see mirrored in his eyes.
Steve's skin prickled everywhere and heat pooled at the bottom of his stomach. He felt hot, so unusually and inexplicably
It is glorious, this moment. They're one, heart beating in unison, scents mingling to form an indestructible wall around them. Steve's bonding gland is aching and Tony can feel it, as distinctly as one of his limbs, and he knows. He
He stood up and stared back into Howard's eyes. He was terrified though. Tony might be taller than Howard now, he might box like a pro and know self-defense like anyone else in this tower, deep inside he was shaking like a leaf. He could still feel the mark of his father's fingers on his cheek, the heat after a blow. He still flinched in anticipation. "No." He muttered through his teeth. "I'm not going." He held his stare and maybe Howard was unsettled, for a quarter of a second. He frowned at him and crossed his arms. Tony shivered, he was waiting for it. It would hurt but he was used to pain.
Steve stared at him warily and shook his head. "I really don't wanna dance, Tony. Please don't make me." He regretted instantly when he saw Tony's shocked expression, a mix of anger and outrage, as if Steve had accused him of harassment or something. Tony Stark must not be used to being rejected.
"I'm so sorry, babe." Tony shivered again, but didn't comment on the pet name. "I'm so sorry. I can't believe I've been such an ass. All the things I've said... about omegas, when all this time, you—"
Steve shook him awake. "Don't fall asleep, we're already late for work."
Tony's eyebrows shot up.
Steve could finally breathe again and felt suddenly sweaty as the rush of adrenaline came down. All eyes turned to Fury and left him alone in his emotional nakedness. Steve glanced at Tony one last time. His dark eyes still raking him from head to toe, still burning. His smile turned from encouraging to sympathetic and fainted softly. He pinched his lips and turned away from Steve, looking back at the whiteboard.
He followed him outside, not without feeling like shit. The anxiety came back as quickly as it had left, creeping up underneath his skin, churning his stomach, choking him breathless.
"You're soaked." He finally said.
"What about that Peter guy you dated a few years back? So into you..." Bucky then said, to change the subject.
what it feels like. Someone who isn't brutal or insensitive. Someone who will treat him with love and respect because his confidence plummets as soon as they get started.
Steve said, smiling mirthlessly. "Well if that's so, then I guess I really should apologize for interrupting you guys."
"Now get the fuck out of my car." Obie said curtly, an amused glint in his eyes. "You're still young! Party! Fuck! Have fun!" He almost commanded. "But remember this, Tony boy, always." Tony opened the door while pretending not to listen. Obie wasn't fooled though. When he was out, he glared at him. "You're
for it?"
But the second blow never happened. Nor did the sniggering.
Are you fucking serious?"
"No." Steve denied slightly too loudly to be completely honest "I don't look at my friends that way."
Tony whined painfully and gasped. It wasn't long until he shouted breathlessly. "Take it out. Take it out." He pleaded. Steve didn't know if it was too painful for him or if he just didn't like it but he pulled the toy out and felt Tony's insides clench around him as he let out a sigh of relief. At least, they had tried.
Tony only answered with a smile and he kissed him again. This time a little more confidently. "I like you." He whispered on Steve's lips, a soft chuckle escaping his throat while he curled his arms around Steve's and hugged him, nesting his head in the crook of his neck. Steve felt like the king of the world with the alpha's heart beating steadily against his chest and his warmth and enrapturing scent enveloping him protectively. He wrapped his arms around him and enjoyed the moment for a short while, before whispering into his ear.
Steve gasped and parted his lips. He barely nodded but his hold on Tony was strong and his determination unwavering and Tony's lips were on him faster than he could get prepared for. Hot and soft and burning against his mouth.
He wondered if Howard had always been so blasé or if he used to be an idealistic when he was young. Had ever been in love? Had he ever been ecstatic about anything? Were was the excitement? Where was the enthusiasm? Where was the little twinkle of futuristic genius that used to shine in his eyes? His father used to be inventive even if Tony had never seen it with his own eyes. Tony only knew the dull drunken glow of his father's eyes. Or the delirious violent rage that sometimes fired in them. He suddenly felt sad for him, despite everything. He felt sad and sorry and prayed very hard to himself to never end up like him.
"I'm gonna work out for a bit... Coming with me? We could spar..."
was really shitty, everything else was perfect."
A whole range of emotion seems to flash through the omega's eyes but Bucky can't really see from where he is. He can smell it though, the way the blond omega's scent spikes with gratitude, yearning and bliss alike.
Tony lasted but five minutes before he came into the omega's ass and knotted him on his knees, right the floor, on that very spot he's been kneeling down, submitting to him.
"Steve
"Starting arguments whenever we're invited somewhere... " Tony explained. "We're not
Now, he can feel the alpha's presence overhanging him. He can feel him with his soul before he can sense him physically and now the warmth of his body is electrifying.
Steve felt his cheeks burn, Tony had a point. He stared at him silently.
"Good." Steve said with a doubtful frown. "Let's get to it, then." He gave him one last peck on the lips before heading upstairs where they had packing up to do in the bathroom, the guest room/art studio and his bedroom.
Which was... possibly true. His tastes hadn't changed overnight. Turning alpha hadn't miraculously made him fancy small and delicate flowers. He liked them tall and sturdy. Probably.
Steve buried himself into the car seat and crossed his arms. "Fucking politicians..."
That doesn't mean he doesn't listen to the conversation. You should know Tony is perfectly capable of doing two things at the same time, and he does them very well, per say.
He chuckled. "It's not like you rutting on me with your mum asleep next door was how I imagined my ideal first time with you."
"Really? You don't know what it's like?"
Steve doodled about every Stark-made novelties.
"Oooh, the heated stare, Stevie. Your butt must be burning!"
Steve felt a sudden surge of love for his boyfriend. He needed the contact so he stood up and skirted around the table to join him. He gave him a passionate kiss that unsettled Tony a little but he quickly recovered and kissed him back and Steve really didn't care that everyone else was staring at them.
Tony remained silent at that, at first, and then Steve heard him swallow. "No, I don't think I have..." He answered honestly. "That wasn't the kind of things I did then..."
But soon the reality caught up to him. Happy was gonna drive his dad home and he was a disgusting slut, full of Obie's cum. Was he really gonna meet Steve in this state and kiss him with that mouth? Did he have the time to get back home, have a thorough shower, and still make it to the party?
"I already knew who you were..." Steve rasped, rather matter-of-factly despite his words being struck in his throat.
"Come on, Steve... You're so oblivious, it's almost sad." Natasha teased, smile a little cruel.
Steve wasn't exactly sure what he meant exactly by "everything you're going through right now," so much was going on in his life currently but he made an educated guess. He just shrugged.
"Liked that, kid?" He heard someone say, probably dark-haired guy, from the tone. Tony answered with a blissed and unfocused smile, unable to control himself. So they repeated it, either by choking him with a hand on his neck, or by shoving their dicks deep down his throat while blocking his airways. Tony passed out again. And again. At some point he threw up. Maybe once, maybe twice, he wasn't sure anymore. Things were blurry. They held his head when he did. And when he was done, exhausted and unable to move anymore, they leant him against the wall and opened his mouth. One last slap to startle him awake and one of them cleaned him with a golden shower. Tony opened wider, instinctively, and swallowed everything when the man shoved his cock into his mouth, didn't even need to be asked. It hardened and poked at the back of his throat. Tony's mind drifted away again. Far far away...
Steve showed him the middle finger.
Tony's hard-on was poking into his hip and his hand was desperately trying to grab it, seeking release. His hips were meeting Steve's slow movements with eager thrusts but it was too late and Steve was already going soft and he was too exhausted but he felt too blissed and heady with pleasure to care.
After that, Tony led him a few floors lower, to the gym, the swimming pool, the pool room, the theatre, etc. And they took a walk around the huge terrace that overhung New York City. It had everything a terrace
When he finally gathered up the courage to do so, he realized Steve had already called, three times. His heart made a leap. Steve had called after all... The surge of excitement was short-lived however. Besides, why hadn't Tony heard his phone?
Bucky wanted Steve to move back into his old apartment floor. He suggested to move out with Felicia. It broke Steve's heart to force them out. He was fine just anywhere in this tower. As long as he was back home, with the pack, and close to Tony. He just settled down in one of the guest apartment.
'enjoy dinner with daddy,' indeed. What a laugh.
And they kissed again.
"Like eighty percent of the American population." Clint snapped back. "You should feel blessed. Being omega makes you special, even more so as a male omega."
He rushed to his door and fumbled at the lock but finally opened it and slipped inside before Tony couch reach him. He slammed the door behind him and collapsed against it, sighing almost relievedly.
"Sam was really cool about it, right away. I would have done it with or without him but I'm really happy we decided to do this thing together, despite our odd situation."
"Honestly," Natasha said. "I had completely given up on love. It just happened."
"So when did you start feeling different?" Clint asked.
Drinks happen. Dinner happens. Posh and overpriced. Tony is feeling tipsy, his head spinning with too much alcohol. It's making him smile too easily. Steve drank just as much but he shouldn't be affected and yet, his face is flushed, cheeks rosy and smile a little too bright, a little too seductive. It must be his scent. Or that deep connection he's been feeling since Steve asked him out. Or something more, maybe the steady pulsation throbbing in his neck, mirroring the pulse of Steve's bonding gland. Maybe it's the heady and muffled atmosphere of the club, the smell of cigars mingled with alcohol and omega scent. Or the music, sensual and mesmerizing.
"Your fans can wait. Your boyfriend's Tony Stark, babe, and Tony Stark always comes first. They'll have to get used to it 'cause you're taking the afternoon off, end of." He looked into Steve's eyes, drawing him in against his will. "And you'll have all the time in the world to return the favor before I leave for Germany." He added with a kinky smile, tongue slipping out of his mouth and licking his bottom lip slowly.
keep taking them." He says, voice pregnant with regrets. "Don't think I haven't tried that already..."
Tony presses his lips on the bulging gland and licks the blood. A jolt of electricity runs through him, he shivers. Tony grazes his teeth on his shoulder and Steve
Tony's comforting hands caressed his back gently, surreptitiously slipping underneath his shirt, leaving a burning trail of shivering desire on Steve's skin. A jolt of electricity ran down his spine. Tony's hands grabbed his neck and he whispered his soft and warm breath on Steve's lips. "It's okay, Steve. We can wait. We don't have to rush things."
He has two omegas and they fuck each other.
It was surprisingly true actually. Past his primary reluctance about everything that stank of money, Steve had realized he wanted to visit the Tower. He wanted to visit Tony's quarters. He was
Tony let out a surprised laugh and turned his head toward the window, avoiding Steve's hungry stare. It sounded so beautiful and sexy. "Yeah but I don't want to force your hand." He said, biting his thumb nail nervously.
He won't ever touch James again. He can't. Spending his last heat with him was the best the could do. A necessary thing to do as his alpha—on paper and in life—which still left a bitter taste on his mouth. Both of them came out of this even more broken than they already were.
"And I don't know..." Clint answers. "It's not that easy. For us, I mean..." He takes a deep breath and gulps down a swig of his beer. "I mean, in other circumstances, yeah, but... I'm not sure anymore if we're really gonna take that step or not."
He felt Tony's upper body shake with a soft chuckle and snuggled against him, running his hands up and down his chest comfortingly before his boyfriend took them both in his hand and intertwined their fingers together. He could feel his boyfriend's heartbeat slowly settle into a normal, calmer pace and hugged him lovingly for a long moment afterward, trying not to think too much of the implications of this.
Steve swallowed, feeling his heart race unwillingly in his chest. "Don't be stupid, Tony."
Tony put strong hands on his shoulders to steady him and pulled away, staring teasingly into his eyes. "Oh no, I wouldn't have missed this for anything..." he said in a hoarse, provocative voice, "I love it too much when you boss me around, Rogers."
