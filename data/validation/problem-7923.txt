"You couldn't have done that earlier?" Sam quipped, looking a lot more relieved than he had a few minutes ago.
Perhaps.
Enjoy!
Sure a relationship between the two of them would turn a lot of heads. There was still an unfortunate old-time stereotype that felines and rodents had a hard time getting along.
The images disjointed. Confusing. Bombarding.
The other Steve had made a strong show of being assured and confident as Tony spat his vitriolic accusations at him...But internally?
“I felt an older embodiment of
Suddenly a man and a woman, both in red, white, and blue uniforms with a star emblazoned across their chests and goggles on their eyes stepped out a portal alongside…another version of myself…This one wearing a Captain America-esque Iron Man suit with the helmet retracted down.
Sorry it's been a while! I've had a bumpy road this past month and half. I promise to continue posting when I can! I have some catching up to do!
, every morning" Steve reiterated, hoping that made things clearer.
Loki had counted on him still being that same selfish broken man who had created a branch reality and lived life with an alternate version of the woman he had loved.
Who?....Hope van Dyne?
Tony's lips were much softer than he imagined.
The knot in Steve's chest uncurled itself.
He remembered confronting the Maker. He remembered dying (again).
Perhaps it was finally time for him to get more personally involved with his subject matter...
Never like this.
It was all too tempting to just curl up in Steve's neatly trimmed red fur and nap with him.
It hadn't been worth it.
Next up is Earth-3490 with a married Steve Rogers and Natasha Stark-Rogers :)
He remembered memories that weren't his. Voices that sounded an awful like Richards and Stark.
“Fair enough” Carol allowed, crossing her arms over her chest as she assessed the two groups in front of her.
How was that so
Suddenly a sly look made its way onto Tony's face, "Then I know just the place".
that was wrong.
It was just him.
At that I watched in exasperation as Sam snapped out his guns, and a barrage of gunfire, and energy were launched in Kang's direction.
This was...heaven?
A soft warmth wrapped around me, chasing away the cold shiver running down my spine.
The leading authority on waiting too long.
"Thanks Steve" Tony said, giving me a genuine smile, "You make me want to do better. Be better...Just don't let that go to your head too much"
Carol and Bucky on the other hand were continuously barraging the forcefield with their attacks, searching, probing for a weak spot.
He was really dead.
...Or rather maybe he had been hoping someone would.
But where was it coming from?
"Not going to offer your Mother the first dance? I raised my boy better than that" a gentle voice teased.
“IT WORKED!” Janet cried out in absolute joy.
The fact that a second superhero civil war occurred even after what happened the first time only proved him right.
I watched in a daze as my (not my) Shield ricocheted across the room, squaring Kang in the chest after he had tossed
And Steve was going to appreciate
He was the one who refused to work
"You said that they found a way to reverse what Thanos did?" Fury questioned, almost sounding hopeful (almost).
But even after being a part of the Ultimates. Helping saving the world. Being
"Then what in hell is wrong with Steve?" Rhodey demanded, pointedly eyeing the super soldier currently laying down on Reed's lab couch, his head resting on his best friend's lap, and his arms possessively wrapped around her hips.
"I've made a lot of mistakes...Some worse than others" Steve admitted to her regretfully, unable to fully believe she could be completely proud of everything he had done.
"My-"
He definitely caught himself quite a mouse.
"Steve" the relieved voice of his wife echoed in his ears.
* I also created my own version of Pepper's character on Earth-8311 (a potto is a real animal - look it up!), and I gave Tony the last name Steppe since an official name was never given for him in this universe (I thought it was cute and worked nicely since a steppe is a type of mouse).
I knew what was going to happen.
Steve didn't
“Let me guess Peace. You’re claiming jurisdiction” Blue Eyed Tony stated unhappily, crossing his arms over his chest.
In many ways staying in another timeline made the pain that much worse.
Hi All!
He wasn't so cowardly.
Hi all!
"Reed. Can you give Tony and I a moment to talk alone?" Steve asked calmly.
But God a part of him hoped that he was.
Tony exhaled a sigh of relief, "Good to have you back Cap”.
She’d been tailing Fury since the Academy was basically founded and she still wasn’t any closer to figuring out any of his secrets than when she’d started.
I was suddenly struck by a twisted nostalgia.
A living illusion.
They would order to go from their favorite burger joint. He would take them to a secluded area of Central Park that he knew of from his morning jogs. They would have an easy relaxed meal underneath the shade of a tree. And when they were finished eating Steve would ask Tony out on an official date.
world?
He…was me from another universe…?
“Well first we need to stabilize the disruption in the flow of time here” Iron Man stated through the speakers of his suit.
"AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!"
you all agree with me that Fury, Pym, and Odin are keeping something from us about the Time Fog?” Natasha questioned skeptically, narrowing her eyes at them.
The other Steve had unhealthily clung to his past and never truly embraced the future in the ways that he really needed to.
All of them (minus Clint) wearing the absolute brightest of grins.
You always find another way.
"And we're just supposed to trust you?" Bucky demanded, his sniper rifle still locked between its target's eyes, "How do we know you're not lying and going to make things worse?"
So I stayed. Using the safety of the world as an excuse.
And a sacrifice unworthy compared to his.
If you care than why do you take your pain out on him?
The fact that he destroyed everything he had built in order to atone. To do what was right.
Thump.
He'd seen them across five other universes.
"Do you expect me to hit him with my cane and say, Get off my world?" I snarked, raising an eyebrow to the brother I had abandoned.
Steve rarely ever gave in to his more animal-like instincts. Considered it uncouth.
Immediately he turned to face the culprit ballsy enough to interrupt him and his mentor's reunion.
The truth.
Pym looked at her in shock.
But it was too late. The Fog engulfed Steve in his entirety.
“Ahhhh!” Wanda unexpectedly screeched, her magic warping uncontrollably around her.
hadn't truly been a sacrifice play.
Now that his eyes have been opened to the truth he wasn't going to waste any more time.
"I...I told you Steve. I thought SHRA-"
It was from Reed:
Steve didn’t even have time to blush before he was pulled away again.
Steve and Tony's faces were so red they put boiled lobsters to shame.
I wanted to live out whatever fraction of my life remained to make real amends with everyone.
And somewhere along the way he'd lost sight of that.
"You want us to just kill our friend?" Sam grit out angrily, sounding like he was only barely keeping back from attacking the other him.
Specifically the man holding a version of my Shield.
"What about Peggy?" Tony reminded him through narrowed eyes.
None of the students said a word as they waited with bated breath for one of them to say something.
"I promise that I will never hurt you like that. That I will never be so uncompromising" Steve promised, sitting up from Natasha's lap and holding onto each of her hands in a firm but gentle grip, the resolve in his eyes sure and strong.
But he'd felt the blind panic and horror at seeing the Arc Reactor (not RT) back in the other Tony's chest. The prayers that he hadn't been the one to put it there.
“You don’t remember?” Hank asked, his eyebrows scrunching in thought.
" Tony emphasized.
Then...nothing. Nothing and then pain.
Tony nods a little sad and is quiet. In silences, there are moments he can observe Tony. The lines of face, the curves of his lips, the veins in his arms, and the way his skin and muscle molds to bone. “What would make you happy?” Tony Stark would give everything to the people he loves, and Steve has never understood why that included him. That when Tony asks now, he would find a way no matter how impossible to make it true.
Steven looks up at his collection. His drawings are not perfect; there are sharp angles that should have been softer, some of the lines have smudged, and some of the colours have bled into each other. He can see all the mistakes that he hadn’t felt his hand make now. His eyes trace over the lines, take in the colours, and faces of everyone. This world isn’t the one he wanted to be in; where nothing is familiar and everything feels distorted, but it is time that learns to live in it. Steve smiles.
He goes back to New York that night. He doesn’t know how Tony finds out, but when he comes back there is a tablet waiting on his bed. The Brooklyn of his childhood digitizes before him in a hologram that grows and changes. The old buildings join together brick by brick and fall away living pixel dust as they rejoin to form new ones. He has the chance to see the world that left him.
Sometimes, it isn’t. The 21st century is not built from the dreams of children sowed in poverty and despair that felt the bleakness of the world erode and tear the hearts around them. It is not built from the talk of the insomniac soldiers who were afraid of what their unconscious held over the threshold of sleep. There is poverty clinging to the frames of the American dream; racism is hidden but there. There are people that fight for the basic rights of human life and are denied. There are people who take the name of the Christian faith and fill their preaches with hate. War has shifted further into the Middle East and Asia where children suffocate from chemical attacks and parents cry over the bodies of their children, and what was once a country flourishing with life and people is now the skeletal remains of what once was. Sometimes, he wonders if what they fought for was worth it.
When the robins herald the spring and life comes back once more in blooming bursts where the baby buds start to emerge, he admits that Bucky is dead because of him and that never stops hurting. That he will never know how his mother or Peggy lived after him. He hopes they were happy everyday.
Bucky’s hair is filled in with quick strokes. Howard leans over, tracking the movement of the pencil. He smells of smoldered iron and gasoline. “I do alright,” he says, which is true the year of art school helped to refine the roughness of his drawing, but a little bit more would have helped to smooth out the finer details of human movement and expression.
“Right, so let it go.” Tony turns his back and walks further into his lab. “Thor can you help with the exposed wires?”
.-.-.-.-.-
He doesn’t turn to acknowledge it, so Steve leaves the words in the air and hopes that it’s enough.
The laugh on the other end is airy. “I’ve been called worse. Don’t worry about it.”
During the few excursions allowed by S.H.I.E.L.D. by “himself” to acclimate to the world, he wanders the streets just walks with the crowds. There are days he stares down at the sidewalk as he walks and gets lost in the repetitive rhythm. One day as he waits for the crosswalk to change on Madison Avenue, where the air smells of suffocating car exhaust, and there’s an orange stray cat that likes to sit on the branches of those scattered oak trees along Manhattan that look artificial in the city; he watches the people across the street, letting his eyes float from person to person until he notices two girls by the Starbucks. They aren’t doing anything. They are standing in front of the window display stenciled with snowflakes and misted with snow. Perhaps, it’s the way that the snow falls onto the taller one’s hair like snow on a still beating hearth, something familiar. Or, it’s in the way they link their forefingers together. Their rings scraping each other’s, coy and secretive among the changing crowed. The 1920s were his home; there is no other time he ever wanted to grow up in, but they were not good times.
“Steve Rogers.”
“Mrs. Rogers, this isn’t charity. These are all old things that I was going to throw,” William looks down at the scarf, smoothing down the strands, “but throwing anything away in this time feels like waste. I thought they’d be better used here.”
Natasha turns her gaze to Tony. “What. Happened.” She repeats slow.
His mother circles one of his wrist’s. “He didn’t make you wrong. The only thing that is wrong is the world that won’t accept you.”
“I figured you were good when you gave me your uniform design never knew how good you were though.”
It takes a awhile, but Bruce nods slow never taking his eyes off Steven.
“Jarvis?” Steve tugs on his leather jacket, fixing the collar.
“Nothing.”
The coffee machine chimes in completion, and Tony gets up, sniffing the rising steam. The sun touches his cheek gold. “Humanity is going to eat itself till the point of annihilation, and we’re going to have to save them. There is going to be aliens that Thor or Loki are going to piss off and start an inter-galactic war with. We’re going to be humanity’s only, and that is going to make a difference.” There are times when Tony Stark makes his fingers itch for charcoal. He doesn’t think too close about that. Tony gives him a half smile before heading back to his laboratory.
When he can’t sleep, he goes up to the roof of the Tower. Sits on the edge of the ledge with the sharp points of city before him in the night. The first time Tony Stark had come up with welders googles on his forehead, soot stained, and stood behind him. “Jarvis told me you were up here.” His gaze is penetrating in the laze of the evening dusk. “Are you planning to jump?”
“Thank you.” Tony squints at him as he yawns into the back of his hand. “Thank you for the hologram.”
Steve takes a breath and runs his thumb against his index finger.
“I didn’t mean-”
Steve watches the blur of buildings. “I don’t need watching, Happy. I’m a trained soldier and not as mouthy as Tony.” Happy doesn’t laugh, but his lips twitch. The car slows, miles and miles of cars stalled like someone cut a conveyor belt and everything has stopped. “How is Tony?”
They say nothing for a bit.
.-.-.-.-.-
.-.-.-.-.-
Tony stares and waits. Instead, he asks Tony what he thinks the future will be.
“Thank you, Jarvis and Happy, I appreciate it.”
Steve smiles, tired and broken. “I don’t know anymore.”
Tony sighs and comes to sit next to him. They look over the city together watch the soft glow from the apartment buildings flicker off. The thing about the 21st century is that it does not sleep. There is always something open, something lit—something alive even in the deepest night.
“If Bruce lost contro-“
He knocks on Bruce’s door when nothing happens, he asks Jarvis to patch him through the intercom. “Bruce, I need to talk to you ,and I rather we do it on your terms.”
William takes a breath. “No, Mrs. Rogers. It’s not. This world isn’t made for me, and it never will be.”
He lets the silence fill in the room. Bruce has a tank setup by the window for a Veiltail goldfish. The colour of molten orange and gold. Its opaque tailfins sway in the water like a curtain in a delicate breeze.
Bruce pushes up his glasses, closing his tablet, leaning back into the couch. “Humans can be cruel, Thor.” Bruce knows that best of all. It is why he excludes himself from publicity events because the days after there news reports of the Avengers putting citizens at risk by letting Bruce be free–that perhaps they should consider locking him up or put an end to him. Bruce is never angry; he just shrugs and smiles, says that you can’t change their minds, and that’s okay. I have you guys. There is an underlying sadness to it, a slight defeat.
“No.” Steve says. “Whatever you want to share is up to you.”
Natasha and Clint exist together, so they must be drawn together. Steve sets up a small studio in the living room. He lays his box of charcoal sticks and pencils in white and black, a kneaded eraser, and chalk pastels on the coffee table. He leans his back against the sofa and balances his sketchbook on his knees. The sun is pleasant and warm on his skin. They like to sit on the couch after missions from S.H.I.E.L.D. where they come back worn and wounded. Natasha wraps a shawl around her shoulders. It is beautiful thing, made of different patterns so intricate that they bleed into each other; it is like staring at a Rosch test. The longer you stare more patterns become noticeable. The centre of it is a flora mandala that blooms coloured in different shades of purple from lavender to plum, and different ranges of blue from baby, cyan and sapphire. It is the only thing she brought over from Russia. She doesn’t know where it came from only that it is the only thing that belongs to her. When she goes on missions that she isn’t sure she’ll come back from, she gives the shawl to Clint. Natasha folds into a square and holds it like an offering. Clint grips it, creasing the ironed fabric. They don’t look away from each other, silent and somber. They have built a world in their silence. He looks at them; his heart is constricted by thorns that pierce the muscles of his heart, and thinks of Bucky. When they come back from missions though they are like cats, sunbathing. Natasha’s feet in Clint’s lap, and he wraps his raw hands around them as his head tips over the back of the couch. The left side of Natasha’s face scraped, starting to heal in purples and blues, and lip torn like a page dyed in red ink. He draws the couch and their bodies in black. Their bruises in red, healing purple-blues, and their scabs in rusted red. Together they are what help him survive S.H.I.E.L.D. During the time that therapy is mandatory and so is his refusal to talk, it is Clint who helps him avoid his appointments. Once as they walk down the metallic halls in the lab where behind bulletproof glass blowtorches flare and hammers pound. Clint says, “they make their weapons and then are afraid of them nicking their skin.” His eyes are dun and dull. “They think that weapons do not weather in a life of war.”
He paints Thor in the mornings, gentle and soft. His hair in a bun, sleep-messed with strands falling out, eyes closed as he takes a sip still steaming coffee. An old God in a modern world. The painting has the touch of age to it, so he adds a bit of a brightness with acrylic to make his hair gold. He adds starbursts of lightning in blue around Thor. Steve leans back on his stool, his fingers crusted with dried paint, and lets the paint dry. The sun is at its peak. It streaks through the windows and the dust glides in the light, delicate and fragile.
Steve scrapes the last of the soup.
Once he had stood in front of a toy store on East 98 Ave. Nestled in the display surrounded by garlands and red bows were sleek trains, vibrant primary painted bird whistles, spinning magic lanterns, and oil slick marbles. There was a bear on a tiny arm chair with its chestnut fur‒fluffed and white bow tied taunt. He had stood there and not wanted any of it. Want is a dangerous thing during the Depression.
“We chose to be weapons of war for our own purposes.”
The final avenger he meets is a pagan god. Thor has a vibrance to him. The world to Thor is filled with something that awakes a child’s curiosity. He is fascinated by humanity in a way that Steve isn’t. They are walking down Kissena Boulevard in Queens where the air smells salty sweet when Thor says, “Places become home faster than you think, Captain.” Thor smiles; his eyes crinkling at the girl waving to him from the other side of the street underneath the red awning of a convenience store. Steve watches the way the wind threads through her short bob, and the windchime strings tangle with each other, struggling to make a sound. What of places lost to time?
The setting sun is clementine orange in the sky; the clouds thick and white on the skyline.
When the air becomes weighted with humidity, and cicadas scream in the night. Tony turns up the AC in the tower so high that Steve has to wear sweaters, and can’t sleep without a blanket. Tony doesn’t come out of his lab and goes up to the roof less and less. The one time he does come up Tony is hollowed out, bruises purple-blue under the well of his eyes, and gaunt. He sits down next to Steve, and the sweat is starting to pool down Tony’s shirt. “I don’t do well in the summer, Cap.” Tony lies down and crosses his hands over his stomach, closing his eyes. “The heat is similar to Afghanistan. There are days I wake up to the grit of sand in my mouth.” Tony opens his eyes. The stars here are faint. In his childhood, the stars were like frozen crystals. It was magic those shards blinking down from the dark. He wants to show that to Tony.
.-.-.-.-.-
Clint turns his head to look at Thor. “I bet you’re saying that because of Loki’s sexual past.”
“Maybe, but compared to you I know very little.”
There are no fragments that his memory can cling to. He stands on the sidewalks of childhood and feels nothing. He spends two days there walks through all of Brooklyn and hears no echoes. There is one moment where it seems like a veil rips, and he can see into the Brooklyn of his childhood. Blake Ave from East 98th St. toward Union St. Brooklyn before him with its muddy unpaved roads and new apartment complexes. The smell of hay and manure entangling with the heavy vapour of gasoline. The road slick in the rain. The puddles that formed cocoa‒coloured along the road. A flock of children, girls in knee‒length dresses and boys in newsboy caps running by him. His mother had gotten one for him too, a little worn. She’d stitched his name in golden thread along the back rim. The thread taunt as she pulled it through. He’d leaned his face against the table watched her in the candle light. How the holes in her stockings always frayed even though she stitched then back again and again. He sees himself on the corner where East 98th starts: sickly, skinny, skin clinging to bone, and eyes too large on his emaciated face. He remembers the way his lungs would feel fragile in the rain. The way it hurt his chest. How the wet cough that never went away got worse. It didn’t stop him from being there with the other children, stubborn and angry with a world that didn’t make him right. His mother would come looking. He would see her red umbrella, floating in among the grey and brown of coats and dresses as she searched. He blinks, and turns his head to where his school used to be. It is an empty lot with a single rusted basketball net. The weeds winding through the cracks in a shock of green amongst the ugly grey. He sees a ten-year-old Bucky, leaning on the graffitied wall of purples and blacks backpack held loose in his grip. The wall behind him is a hybrid of a white rabbit with the smile of the Cheshire cat all of the ends of the teeth sharpened to a nightmarish point.
The radio continues,
Steve reaches out and grips Bruce’s hands in his own. “You are our friend, and we will protect you, but you will never put Tony in danger like that again, Bruce do you understand me?”
“Sir, Ms. Potts has arrived and is waiting for you on the helipad.”
He meets Peggy Carter, and she is beautiful fiercer than any solider. She saves them multiple times. In battle Peggy is dirt smeared, skirt torn, yet somehow her red lipstick is untouched. A warrior. Once in between moving inward in Europe they rest in Wales, they sit in the evening light on the cliffs with emerald tuffs of moss, clinging to the rocks that almost glow in the night. The waves batter against the edge never ending. Peggy in a shawl wrapped around her shoulders. The wind blew the smell of the salted sea. She had turned, and smiled at him. He falls in love with Peggy. He does. There is a part of him, small so very small that is glad that he’s normal—that he can love a woman. That maybe it had been a mistake for him to ever think otherwise. He loves Peggy, he does, and he’s relieved.
Tony shrugs, shoulder touching his ear. He looks over his shoulder and says, “you need a lot of things, Cap.”
He sips his soup. The psychiatrists are frustrated because he does not talk of war trauma or the survival guilt. He refuses, spends his sessions silent and immobile. His mind is his, and he will not allow S.H.I.E.L.D. to violate that.
.-.-.-.-.-
.-.-.-.-.-
He goes to church sometimes. Not often enough and he hopes no one minds. He listens to the sermons and the testaments that he has memorized, watching the way the light filters through the stain glass windows. There are three behind the priest: one in the colours of a fire warmed autumn, one in the colours of the evergreen of spring, and the last the blue cold of winter. He prays every night out of habit, sits on the edge of his bed, hands folded on his knees, with his head bowed. He does not ask for forgiveness just that those he left had good lives, that his mother was happy, that Peggy lived a life to fullness, that Bucky did not suffer, and the men he led had no regrets. When he was younger his prayers were different. In his tiny room where the wind touched his skin and bone that the small radiator could not defeat, he wished for health. When he was a young man, and he felt desire deep inside that pulled and craved he wished for normality.
Steve taps on Nat’s caller ID photo and reads through all of the messages. He wonders if he is still asleep or if Nat has decided to message in some sort of code because none of the messages make any sense. He looks at Tony who is now off the phone and his defeated and miserable expression does not make any sense either.
Tony is shaking. He feels dizzy and nauseated, not really sure about anything anymore. He doesn’t want to think about the hours spent contemplating the perfect magazine capacity and the implication of that perfect magazine when an active shooter is changing it to fire into a crowd in the local mall. He drops his hand, claws the table cloth and then the fucking stupid tears start running down his face.
--- Spoilers ahead :) ----
“So you don’t live in Houston either?” Tony asks.
This was what Tony wanted.
, babe I love you. I can't thank you enough for all your support and encouragement and the late-night beta, which I really and truly appreciate. <3<3
Not like Tony can lie about any of it, anyway.
And it feels right.
Steve kneels between Tony’s legs, bends and kisses Tony’s lips. His mouth slides down Tony’s throat leaving a wet and warm line over his neck, on his Adam's apple and rests on his chest, right where the arc reactor scars are and Tony’s thoughts, almost all of them, drain out of his brain. It’s an ‘I’, he works out with too much effort, as Steve’s mouth moves in a half-circle from the center of Tony’s chest, licking his left nipple, making him hiss and moan, and curves down to reach his navel before moving back up mirroring the same curve on the other side, and the half-circle, over his right nipple back to the center of the scars.
He stops swaying and Steve feels a little awkward to stand still with the music still going. He runs his hand in Tony’s hair on one side, and his heart skips a beat as Tony closes his eyes and leans into it. “Unless you’ve been cheating on a partner with me, nothing you’d wanna say could be that big a deal. Me on the other hand--”
Clint laughs, spilling milk and cereal on the hardwood floor. “What you gonna shun your horse nephew, Thor?”
.-.-.-.-.-
In the winter as fat fluffed snow starts to cloak the city and he can’t leave the tower without layering up. Steve makes hot chocolate for the days he and Tony sit up on the roof. They take turns, sipping from the thermos. Tony says, “I was the son of Howard Stark, and that meant something to a lot of people. It meant a lot to my dad, and I never lived up to it. I wasn’t what Howard Stark wanted, and that never changed. I tried, and I think I still do to be what he wanted. Don’t get me wrong; I am amazing, and no one will tell you any different. It just takes a lot to believe.”
To go from being heralded as the paragon of freedom and justice. The moral epicenter of all heroes. Of the people.
A crack echoed in his ears as he reached up and tore away at the wood, clawing at the dry, grainy material falling on top of him from above.
“Are you going to miss me, Cap?”
As the war continues and leaves the skeleton of towns crumbling and hollowed people in its wake, they know and do not say that they go to war to die. So, they fight for a future that will not be theirs, but one where children know not of war, poverty, hate, or genocide. It is easier to die for a dream. There is no hope when they open the doors to concentration camps, and death is the only reprieve for people. There is no god among the battlefield only humanity fallen to a darkness that no redemption will cleanse. The future is the only thing that they can hold. It will be worth it, and he will die for it.
Thor crosses his arms. “It is a fitting response for such slander. It is a shame Midgardians do not challenge each other to battle for such disrespect.” There is a this look that Thor gets sometimes, serious and solemn where the millenniums set into his eyes and dulls them. “It is sad to think that Midgard is filled with people of such low thinking. In Asgard, love is a beautiful thing blessed by Freyja whether between those of the same gender or opposite genders.”
It is easier to live when he isn’t living under the microscope of S.H.I.E.L.D. doctors and scientists. No one asks how he is feeling or whether he slept. No one tries to psychoanalyze him. Tony gives each of them a floor that they can hide in and opens up a communal living room. The tower is engrained with technology from Jarvis to Tony’s collection of robots. The world isn’t hidden away behind cement; it is seen through the glass windows. No one filters the world for him. He doesn’t add much to the apartment at the tower lets it be the way it is. Sterile. Tony comes by sometimes, peers over Steve’s shoulder, and his mouth goes tight. He isn’t trying to be difficult or ungrateful. He just doesn’t know how to make a home anymore. So, he keeps the room the way it came even when Tony starts to come by less and less to check up on him.
“That is true, I can teach you everything if like,” Tony says soft like a whisper in his ear. Steve doesn’t know what do with the words bubbling up inside his stomach that rise into his throat. “I’m kidding, Cap; I didn’t mean to offend your old prudish wartime sentiments.”
As ice starts to line his lungs and cold curls around each of his cells, he does not fight. There will be a better world, so it’s okay to let himself submerge in the darkness. It’s okay.
He wakes in the 21st century. Alone. The people are happy, children are healthy, technology is dream-like—unusual, constantly changing, and marvelous. There is prosperity, and the people dream. Tony Stark asks him once what he thought the future would be like. He watches the sun rise on the skyline bathe the skyscrapers in gold. Tony is on one of his manic inventing periods that leave him awake for days, surviving on coffee and body reserves. The inventor is grease‒stained fingers and kinetic energy that switches from the tap of his leg to the drumming of his fingers; sitting still is not something Tony Stark knows how to do. Tony sprawls over the white marble counter like a house cat as he waits for his coffee maker. Steve takes a sip of his tea, and says I thought it would be easier to breath. He expects Tony to make a joke or snort, but Tony looks at him and asks if it is.
“Having fun Cap?”
Tony laughs. “Cap, aren’t you a man with words. Is that how you wined and dined the women in your time?”
That does not change that Bruce has terrible days. He runs down to Tony’s smoldering lab and finds Tony standing in the middle, rubbing a hand over his mouth and another on top of Dum-E’s claw. The lab is gutted, the wiring exposed and sparking, there are shards of glass from the shatterproof walls around Tony’s testing space, there are parts of metal strewn everywhere and plaster and cement still rain down like dust storm.
There is a rush of steps behind them. Clint, Natasha, and Thor come in with their weapons drawn and stop at the entrance of the lab. Clint slips his bow over his arm and puts his arrow back in his quiver. He squats, picking up an in-progress faceplate for a new suit. He whistles “Oh, this is gonna be expensive even for your rich ass.”
Steve picks up the rustle of sheets. A few moments later he hears hesitant footsteps toward the door. When the door opens the room is in darkness, his eyes adjusts, and he sees Bruce on his bed arms curled around his knees. Steve steps in, turns on the light as Bruce flinches curling tighter around himself. Steve drags a chair over and sets it down in front of Bruce.
“I don’t know couldn’t sleep.”
“What are the closest art stores to the tower?”
When they are boys as their bones ache and skin stretches, and they are on the verge of becoming, Steve hasn’t learned how to conceal his soul yet. He will one day in the way that adults learn to push and hide truths until they forget. However, that is later but then in his youth he hasn’t. It happens at the speed of shutter shots; a series of images that happen slow in his head because he keeps fading in and out. He’s on the ground creating plumes of pale-yellow dust. There are lines of ants, solider marching into an ant hill, endless in sync. There are shoes on the edge of his sight that step in a chaotic waltz. He rolls on his side. Bucky spits blood, wipes his mouth with his raw hand as he watches Wilkserson run home. Bucky pulls him, holds his neck, and forces their eyes to meet. “I don’t care; we’re brothers.” Even as the blood drips, staining the dirt wet Bucky doesn’t let go. “This will never change anything.” He’s wrong because Steve has seen what has happened to people who do not hide what they are. Steve has heard what the church says. He might have Bucky and his mother, but it is not enough for the world. He clutches Bucky’s arm. The tears are hot, as they slide down his face, weighted in sinned guilt. “No one can know what happened here, Bucky no one can know.”
“Midgardians have a problem with that?” Thor is puzzled by humanity almost everyday, but there are few were there is anger under them like a thunderstorm on the edge of bursting. It is there now.
“No, Tony I didn’t mean it like that. You’re free with your words and your language in a way that I’m not, and that’s because of where I grew up. I like that you are like that, outspoken but abrasive.” Steve covers his eyes this isn’t what he wanted. “I just wanted to call you to talk you.” He can be a little honest. “Because I miss you.” He can hear Tony breath on the other end. Maybe he screwed up said something he shouldn’t have.
This is new.
He turns and wonders if he's ever seen anything more beautiful than the deep lines that form around Tony's mouth as his face lights up into a smile.
I appreciate each and every comment, so please tell me how you feel about all of this :)
can do this.
The fact that he is a virgin, well not anymore technically, but still pretty much, and the fact that he has shared his first-ever with Tony, is quite magical. The intensity of how precious and how ecstatic it feels takes Tony by surprise, and, wow, makes him hard, full-on. His first instinct is to leave the list and walk into that shower to touch that wet, perfect body, but he’s not a horny pig, not a hundred percent anyway. Even if he doesn’t account for the self-isolation news or the sea of unknown and unforeseen things happening around them right now, it’s still highly inappropriate to walk in on a guy with a stiffy, just because he has given Tony the honor of touching him, God, as the first person, ever.
Things that feel right might end up being alright after all, because Tony is as overdramatic as Steve, so why should he care about supersoldier serums and secret identities, about masks and shields? Tony wouldn’t care. He can’t care. If Steve just opens his mouth and tells him everything right in this second, Tony will not give the smallest fuck about any of that. Steve has to attack this one without a proper plan, apparently. He has to improvise.
And those of you who read and don't comment? I love you too, and I hope you enjoy this <3
Ty lets go of Tony’s fingers and wraps his hand around Tony’s shoulders. “The pleasure is all mine, sir. Please call me Ty.” He squeezes Tony’s shoulder, sending a frosty line across Tony’s chest, so he shifts a little in place and rubs his hand on the outside of his thigh to stop himself from pulling away. “And Captain Rogers, this is my omega, Tony.”
“Mr. Barnes,” Tony mumbled, as he stretched his hand and watched the blue-eyed alpha grab his hand and shake it, a little too firmly.
Steve’s eyes light up when he reads the items on the list and the crinkles on the corner of his eyes make Tony’s heart swoon happily. He presses a kiss on Tony’s forehead before disappearing, and Tony wonders how long it has taken him to open his eyes after he has squeezed them shut to revel in the sensation of Steve’s lips on his skin.
They stay like that, connected, until Steve’s breathing evens out and the warmth of Tony’s mouth around his cock is not burning anymore. Tony kisses Steve, all the way back to Steve’s lips and pets his hair, whispering praises in his ear that Steve can feel, but he can't quite understand. He helps Steve into the shower as if Steve’s a fragile first-timer, which he kinda is, and it is not until after Tony has finally left him alone to go sort out breakfast, that it hits Steve, finally. He has forgotten to even try
Tony kisses Steve’s toes. He kisses Steve’s shin and caresses the inside of his thigh. Steve’s body rattles from the sensation, as Tony lines up against him, kneeling on the bed, his cock slick and solid, hovering over Steve’s hole.
,’" Tony sighed. "Took me a while to stop trying to change his mind.” He smiled absentmindedly and tore his eyes away from the disinfection building to look at Barnes.
He sits on the bed, loosens his tie and tries not to think about Ty’s footsteps getting closer. He thinks about being such a screw up instead, how he has blown up six months of fragile peace and how he should have thought about this thing within him before putting on a show. Watching the knob turn and the door open, he wonders if he can wash and keep these sheets or he will need to throw them out tomorrow.
“From me, Sir,” Jarvis replies from inside the car. “I assumed that you would do quite a bit of shopping.”
“Maybe so, but thank you for knowing what I needed today.”
“What, no–”
Adapting or accumulating to the world is easier once he leaves S.H.I.E.L.D.’s HQ and starts to live in the Avengers Tower.
“No.” Heights like these won’t kill him. Then again, he doesn’t know what will. The super serum changed the limits of his body, and now no one is left to tell whether those limits have ends.
He rolls the charcoal across his palm, leaving a splotchy night sky on his skin.
“My time is important and because of that they can wait. I’d rather talk to you, what made you want to call?”
Clint tips the cereal box into his grey milk. “Bruce show the guy his family’s dark history.”
Steve shrugs, moving on to the nurses the way their hair curls and holds against their hats. “Practice helps.”
Thor turned to the TV. “This Republican wishes to slander Stark? For what reason?”
“What?”
He squeezes Bruce’s hand. “Never again.”
League’s Art Supply is small, contained by a black iron gate outside and inside built like a walk-in closet. The inside of the store is packed with tubes of paint: acrylic, watercolour, oil, ink, and gouache. The tables lined with rows of metallic cases filled with: pastels, graphite pencils, pencil crayons, and charcoal. There are various canvasses, sketchbooks, and art books shoved onto bookshelves. The availability and magnitude of art supplies is astounding.
“Steve.” Bucky stares at him, eyes weighted in stone. “There are clubs here that we can go to, Steve. It’s different. No one knows you here,” Bucky whispers.
“I didn’t mean to interrupt. I can call back–”
Steve lies down. The cool cement chills his spine. “Somebody told me that it doesn’t take a lot to make people happy, and I want you to be happy.”
Bruce Banner is introduced to him by Fury. Bruce wrings out the bottom hem of his shirt, and does not make eye contact. He hates being in S.H.I.E.L.D. more than Steve does. The attention on him shifts to Banner who is deemed more unstable. Bruce does not venture out his room unless necessary. Terror spreads when Bruce walks by, which is why he stays in his room.
.-.-.-.-.-
Bruce types on his tablet and holds it up to Thor, sipping his tea to conceal his amusement. Thor’s eyes track the words. “By Odin who wrote this? Who has written these lies?” He grimaces. “With a horse?”
“Goodnight, Tony.”
“You’ve heard it here America, and Mr. Stark does rise points of authenticity that need to be answered, regardless we thank Tony Stark for taking the time to talk to us on This is America. If you missed this interview you can find it on our webpage this is Mai Kyo signing off.”
.-.-.-.-.-
“I do not have a horse nephew…I think I do not.” Thor strokes his beard. “I will have to talk to Loki about this.”
Natasha hides her smile into her fist, and he grips her ankle, pressing warmth into her cold flesh as laughter bounces in his chest.
“Not all children,” Tony says. It’s a misstep in conversation. For a man who is honest to the point of being abrasive, there are certain things that Tony doesn’t talk about. Howard Stark and anything related to what happened in Afghanistan. “People are built from trauma,” Tony whispers. Steve turns. Tony stares at him blanked faced. “Are you happy here?”
Tony looks away instead busies himself with making coffee. “Glad you liked something here, but it’s nothing. I made the program when I was kid. It isn’t worth anything—”
He leaves the rest of the Avengers to help Tony clean up. His feet are steady. The halls blur from his pace, becoming streaks of metal.
.-.-.-.-.-
Happy touches the radio. A hologram digitizes, bringing up a traffic grind. “You could call him on the phone he built you.” He squints at the map. Oh. “It doesn’t take a lot to make people happy, Mr. Rogers, which is why I’m going to tell you this.” He turns his head to look at Steve. “Tony is an inventor who builds things for the world, and in it he forgets about his own, so when he builds something for you it means something, doesn’t it?” The cars in front start to move and Happy turns back to the road. He doesn’t talk again the ride back to the tower.
“Would you like to spar?”
Grief is an ugly thing, and all beings are made from grief; sometimes, it is like a smooth pebble that sits in the stomach. Other times, it is a jagged sharp piece of rock that cuts the lining of your stomach. Grief will erode in time and with it the pain will disappear. The problem is that sometimes people curl around their grief, sheltering it from the wear down of time. His is guilty of that.
Happy opens the backdoor to help. Steve shakes his head and puts the bags in the back before walking to the side and getting into the passenger’s seat. Happy signals, checks his blind spot, and merges into the traffic.
It does stop. They leave a bloody mess of broken human flesh. It is his mother who treats William. He isn’t allowed in the room. He hides beside the door, wedged into the radiator that burns his flesh as he presses his eye against the space between frame and door. The water basin on the floor is pink with blood, and the gaze has unrolled onto the floor. His mother sits on the bed as William lies. He digs his palms into his eyes.
“Sick,” he answers, putting his mug into the sink. He turns on the tap and starts to rinse the dishes, smoothing his hand over the surface of plates and swirling water into cups.
“It’s different here.”
“It is though, and you thought I needed it.”
Clint’s skin is cream white under the basement lights. “Then what do you do with broken things?”
He could lie like he had to the S.H.I.E.L.D. psychologists. It is very easy to lie to people because very few have ever wanted the truth from him. That is the thing about being the hope for people. It makes it harder for them to see the flaws—to see the human. He could lie. “No, I’m not.” It is his truth; the one he has never allowed himself to admit.
He sits on the floor, his back against his bed, and a cup of peppermint tea steaming next to him as he draws a portrait of Peggy in pen. The smell of ink heady in the air, intoxicating. Everything about her immaculate: her hair pinned away from her face, the arch of her cheek bones, and the curves of her lips. Peggy does not smile. She is serious and every smile that he made bloom is precious. He fills her lips in with red ink and dusts her cheeks in with it. She was the first he loved, and he’s sorry he couldn’t give her everything of him.
“Did you just call me a loose man?”
“You didn’t.” There is the static of rustling. “Give me the phone damn it, Tony. Hi this is James Rhodes, who is this?”
He does not call Tony even when one month goes and turns into two. He does not call even when he goes to the rooftop and aches. He does not call even when he sits on the breakfast island and turns every time someone comes into the kitchen. He does not call even when he goes down to the labs by accident looking for Tony, and it is Bruce who greets him confused. He does not call.
"The Soul Gem is...interested in what you have to say...Whether that means She will be cooperative is another story" Adam cryptically explained, opening up the palm of his hand to Steve.
"Well, on the bright side at least we don't have to worry about another dimension's Steve Rogers popping in for a visit" Tony stated dryly.
With a whir a portal appeared behind Kang, sucking him in and away from the cluster of Avengers.
Steeling his nerves Steve made his way off the dance floor and beelined his way over to the balcony.
He'd let himself burn for all eternity in Hell if it meant freeing Tony and Natasha from such a horrible fate.
What the?
“It’s possible that they used the Time Fog to make us all young for whatever reason. That would explain what Loki sensed, and how despite my age I’m apparently a mother of teenage twins” Wanda muttered from her meditative position in the air, her magic flowing around her as she focused primarily on using her chaos magic to sense and sift through the chaotic energy of the Time Fog.
Conveniently omitting Wanda's past affiliations and her hand in the Hulk attacking Johannesburg to the public.
Of course he didn't realize that his actions would tear apart the fabric of their universe…
What was going on?
When they finally stopped to breathe they only separated just enough for Steve to rest his forehead against hers, relief and love sparkling in his eyes now rather than uncertainty and doubt.
"I couldn't agree more" Steve proclaimed, his eyes screaming with desire as they devoured Tony's every detail.
Steve huffed out laugh, rolling his eyes at Tony's reaction.
“Would you lay off already?! You’re already about to get your damn way!” Bucky shouted back at him, his control snapping at the realization that this would be our last moments together.
One last particularly harsh tug and somehow he felt he had finally reached his destination.
moving a tad closer to him.
"You are. I'm at my happiest when your not dead" Tony smoothly proclaimed.
"You're gonna need to see this for yourself"
Enjoy!
A heart that never belonged to him…
He wanted his happy ending.
A heavy weight fell upon the room. Choking. Suffocating at the memory of the man who had been larger than life, and had cheated Death at every turn, only for his counter to finally run out just when he had found his greatest joy.
"Make sure you wear something nice for your hubby. They say first impressions are everything" David teased, waving a hand back at him in good-bye as he walked away, feeling smug as his job was done.
He couldn't be more confused.
"How are you feeling? Any residual transmissions from Steve-199999?" Tony casually inquired, sliding up behind Steve, wrapping his arms around the larger man's waist and placing a light kiss between the juncture of his neck and shoulder, a mere brush of his lips against Steve's skin.
of respect.
Were they always this dense when it came to each other?
had died. Like an echo of a memory I couldn’t fully reach. Deja-vu if you will...And that me that had died, that version of myself, those memories, that history died with him. It felt like it was a part of myself that I had lost and couldn’t reach” Loki openly detailed, something he only ever did with a close few people. Which in itself demonstrated how unnerved Loki was with the whole situation.
“Makes sense” I grumbled, “The flashes won’t be permanent will it?”
The group turned to see Shuri walking over to them.
But Steve was sure he'd finally found the right partner.
"No Steve. SHRA, the incursions. They were my sins-"
He had thought that the world he was living in had somehow been distorted.
He'd already been so blind, letting assumptions and his own insecurities come between him and everything he'd ever wanted.
"What do you think of naming our son Harley Peter Stark-Rogers?"
Hi All!
Every time Stark sang 'Danny Boy' it wasn't meant for a wishful hope.
"It's the right thing" I tell him, my tone firm and resolute as I looked Sam in the eyes.
come to help.
The moment his knees rested atop what he was sure was the desert's surface he clawed at the cloth covering him from head to toe. Yanking. Pulling. Tearing until the searing sun needled at his eyes, taking in greedy gasps of the dry humid air into his lungs.
Or possibly even just a random drunken ramble by Stark who only knew that single Irish song to connect to him with.
It was only by his incredible self-restraint that held him back from physically lashing out at me.
When he opened his eyes again he stared down at the image of Iron Man he had illustrated for the Magazine's latest cover.
Just then, an idea popped into Natasha's head, and the loving fondness in her eyes morphed into a mischievous glint.
Every time he fell asleep he was plagued by dreams of heroes and tragedies. Of love and loss.
He saw the grief and regret plaguing Steve's soul like a slow acting poison.
The Gem almost hummed, pulsing as it considered the human's request.
"Then you still have compassion" Erskine assured him, tapping Steve's chest over his heart, "You are human. And humans are not perfect. But you are still a good man at your core. No matter how many times you may stumble you get right back up"
He called Tony and not Sharon…That’s...interesting.
No. You never really do. You just learn to roll with the punches...And some learn better than others.
"Well then. What are
He'd wasted
Steve could help but smirk at that.
Besides, he highly doubted that there was anything majorly sinister at play.
Her husband was usually pretty careful in making sure not to wake her, especially on nights like this where she was actually able to sleep through the night without having to get up to pee every few hours.
“Actually. If you wouldn’t mind. I need to speak with Tony alone for a minute” I asked of the remaining group.
Had he not removed the cross-dimensional transmission properly?
Realizing that solidified his plan to live out his life in another timeline.
He opens his sketchbook, smooths a hand over the thick blank page. Steve sets his tin of prismacolors on his desk and starts to sketch Bruce in black, not too precise just rough and full of streaks. Dr. Banner is muted colours, subdued yet still vibrant. Sometimes, they spend their evenings in the Tower’s library, reading. Bruce sits in the red upholstered armchair with a fuzzy blanket draped over his knees, glasses slipping as he reads science papers or works from the romantic period. Steve likes to sit on the window seat with his back against the side panel as the sun trails his skin. His shoes on the hardwood floor next to his mug of tea. When Tony notices, he adds more books to the library for them. He orders subscriptions to Scientific American, Sky & Telescope, Popular Science, Physics Today, New Scientist and updates the science section. He adds books from Steve’s childhood, and the books that came after. He enjoys the serenity of their time together.
“I can see why you do; I’m pretty great.” He can imagine Tony wink over the phone. Steve shakes his head. “I miss you too, though,” Tony says quiet and gentle. Tony doesn’t say anything for a moment. “I don’t know if anybody has ever asked you this. Cap are you interested in men?”
Natasha is silent. Ordinary S.H.I.E.L.D. employees tense before her and skitter out of the room. She makes people uneasy. Black Widow: the resident assassin for S.H.I.E.L.D. For him she is calming, she does not idealize him or treat him with care. She comes to visit him in the gym and aims for his vital organs when they spar. She disappears for weeks and comes back smelling of blood and gun powder. Sometimes, she comes to visit him in his room not to talk just to read a book while sitting on the window ledge. He makes her tea and goes back to reading up on world history. She is his first companion.
In Europe, as they start to liberate Paris, Bucky and him are staying in Riquewihr. The town is beautiful with its cobblestone streets and history, lining and weathering each stone. There are houses built out of storybooks all packed together with large windows facing out into the streets, and old gas lamps standing sentry in front of houses. The children are somber, unsmiling. The people broken. It is a town of tattered people on the edges of the holocaust. There are many towns that they walk through that know the same and much worse. Riquewihr is spared compared to the other cities and towns they will go through as they get closer to Germany. They push back the Germans and burn the lingering traces of occupation in the centre square. In between planning to more inward to Paris, he and Bucky rest in the hotel. Bucky is on bed next to the wall, bandaged arm across his chest, the other thrown over his eyes, drunk on the wine given to him by the locals. Steve draws the castle of Riquewihr in charcoal. The radio plays over the sound of his sketching.
He finds Tony a few weeks later, sleep soft and slow in the morning.
“Look, it’s Bruce. He has the most control out of any of us here. I piss people off; I’m good at it, and not once have I ever bothered him.” Tony runs a hand through his hair, dislodging plastered and dust. “What do you think Fury is going to do if he finds out?”
“Steve,” it’s desperate.
Tempera paint is what will age the painting in the way he wants.
He goes up to the roof, sets up an easel, so it faces the city, drops his acrylic paint tubes and mixing palette onto the floor next to a glass of water. The glass casts rainbow diamonds on the cement that shimmer like scales under the noon sky. The rough sketch he does in pencil, forming the body and the finer details like the creases of the shirt, the smudges of grease, the A.C.D.C. graphic of his favourite work shirt, and the lines around Tony’s eyes. He takes his flat brush and dips it in the black to start on the shirt. Once he is done, he switches a filbert to fill in the arc reactor in a mix of blue and white and the lettering of his shirt. The sun tiptoes down the sky, and Jarvis turns on the landscape lighting when it becomes harder to see. He takes a rounded paintbrush to go over the lines in long waves of black paint, switching to a rigger brush for the intricacies of the face. Steve dips the brush in water and watches the paint swirl like black vapour spreading. The Tony Stark of the world is a performer: loud, abrasive, confident, and charming. He takes red and starts to fill in the outline of the Iron Man faceplate. The Tony that builds for a future is who he paints. He paints the moment of stillness when Tony is at work serious and quiet, oil stained fingertips that leave traces all around as he works on an Iron Man faceplate. He wipes his paint tinted fingers across his cheek and leaves streaks of red and yellow on his skin. His paintbrush dangles in his fingers, raining drops of paint unto cement.
As a child he doesn’t understand why one day some of the tenants stop William outside, push him until he falls, and scrape his face into the road until he bleeds. He doesn’t understand why, but it’s wrong. So, he picks up a rock and starts war he can’t win. Even when they hold him back, he bites and scratches, trying to protect William from the kicks.
Steve frowned, watching as Tony’s smile strained.
No one says anything.
Natasha comes in a pair with Clint Barton who he meets in the commissary. Clint sits down in front of him as he spoons up soup.
He goes to Brooklyn once maybe looking for ghosts.
“Smelt them into something else.” Time will temper the jagged edges of souls that tear into you. It will temper the pain, longing, fear, anger, and sorrow until it becomes a part of you smoothed down into the cervices left behind by life.
Tony scoffs. “We all know the reason why she’s saying that. Instead, how about we question whether we can trust a senator that is endorsed by big corporate oils to push legislations to drill for oil on First Nations lands or nature reserves. How can we trust a woman who has taken bribes and runs on greed?” Tony looks at the camera. “My social life may be frivolous, but I’ve never sold myself for profit, have I? Even I have standards.”
“Don’t do that. You don’t have to be sorry.” Tony sighs. “I can look at people and know what they want whether its my money, my tech, or me, and I don’t know what you want. It is just confusing, Cap.”
“I’m a good catholic man. I help people. I stay away from vices. I am good to my fellow man. I go to church even though it hates me because I love God,” his is thick and it takes him awhile to get the words out. “So why did he make me wrong?”
Steve stops, and looks over his shoulder, hand hovering over the sink with his cup.
Clint whistles, spooning more cereal into his mouth. “Daaaaamn, Stark went for the jugular.”
“Steven Rogers.”
“Yeah, it’s fine. I just wanted to call.”
It takes a while for him to figure out how to draw Thor. He looks at all of his supplies and nothing feels right. Though child-like, there is an aged air around Thor that does not come out often. It is in his eyes as he gazes at humanity. “Your lives are very short, you age and grow so fast.” Thor stares at him. His eyes are like a galaxy long formed and beautiful; they have seen all, seen lives end and begin, has witnessed the end and rise of civilizations. “In a breeze a tree will stand still, but its branches will move.” Thor smiles innocent and free. “Nothing stands, still not even for Gods.” There are days, dark and few, when there is a numbness that eats at his heart that he goes and finds Thor to spar with. They fight until they split their knuckles and lips, create dents in the training rooms walls and floors. They fight until they can’t get up. Steve coughs up blood that splatters against the grey metal floor like thin paint drops on a canvas. Thor rolls over onto his back, hair stuck to his forehead, face covered in blood as he pants. He can feel the slow warmth; the slight pull of his skin knitting together to heal. They lie on the ground, let the sweat, and blood dry. His body hurts, the cords of his muscles pull painful under his skin, and his ribs ache. He feels okay. He meets Thor’s eye and Thor laughs, curling a hand around his bruised ribs.
“No, thank you. I’ll find them.”
He strokes the stick across the white page in sharp crescents. “Hm?” His fingers are stained black at the tips.
Tony leans on the marbled kitchen counter, glasses slipping down his nose. He’s got oil stains on the side of his neck. His Rolling Stones shirt is torn at the collar.
Steve floats on the surface like a leaf in a pond. The water in the pool is heated to a soothing point, and he lulls in the gentle buoyancy of the waves. For a moment. Just a moment. He thinks about just letting the water swallow him and falling into a soundless and sightless oblivion, opening his mouth, letting the water fall in and fill his lungs.
The girls smile. Steve looks away, when he hears the changing screech of the crosswalk. Maybe this is the world William would have found happiness in.
.-.-.-.-.-
A vase of narcissus’s sits by the window, some of the yellow petals are starting to tear, and the edges are starting wilt into a brittle brown. He’s never liked cut flowers because their fragility gives them days before their decay. Why then do people keep them, when in the wild they are part of cycle of renew and rebirth? Steve rubs a velvet petal between his fingers and it tears. He says nothing.
They are the only two of their kind. They are cursed with the loneliness of that and cursed with guarding the knowledge of their creation. Steve feels the thick denim of his thighs. The solid ground beneath his legs. “There won’t be.” There won’t be. “We will destroy the records, and the samples they have on both of us. We can’t reason with them, so we’ll make them listen, okay?”
Dum-E whirs over to his creator, and lets out a string of beeps. Tony pats him. “Nothing.”
“…Not for a month or more. There is a delay with the parts that were supposed to be shipped overseas, so I’m cleaning that up and looking into other suppliers for Stark Industries.”
His mother holds his face, gentle and soft, as she leans down, so he can see her eyes. “Cushlamachree, you live with truth, and that is a beautiful and dangerous way to live,” her eyes are the blue of a clear winter sky. “I want you to always live that way,” she whispers. He swallows saliva. His eyes blur the image of his mother. His vision wavers. He can’t do that. He can’t.
“Oh, Cap what are you doing here?”
Steve doesn’t know how to want. As a child, things were limited. Scarcity was second nature to them. People did not thrive in his time. They were all like dried plants looking for a source of water. Brittle and tired. Haggard and ravaged by hunger for life—for more.
