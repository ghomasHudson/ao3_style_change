Axel cleared his throat. “Thanks. I'll...one day, okay? Aqua knows a bit. Anyway, show us your keyblade, Tony.”
“Oy! That's not yours!” she vaguely heard Harritt say, but she really didn't care who the knife belonged to; she moved to stand in front of Tony.
But that was besides the point.
As for who actually would be accompanying him, Steve, and the girls, he still wasn't sure. When he asked anyone, they simply shrugged.
“No,” whispered Tony, struggling to keep his head up.
Tony looked at Steve, both of them silent as they linked their hands.
~~Hold me, Whatever lies beyond this morning~~
“You can't pick the family you're born into, but you can decide who you want to call your family,” added Kairi.
With a clap of thunder, Thor left. Xion clapped her hands, delighted.
“You're still learning,” said Steve, ignoring the others. “What we experienced was definitely unexpected, and I'm betting it won't be the first time this happens. Yes, we probably should have made sure we were more informed before leaving, but I promise it's not the first time we've been caught off guard by our enemies.”
“What one?”
“I heard strange noises. I got worried, you know?”
“Out of the car, Tony!”
“You don’t know if the video is real.”
Cool breeze hits his inner thighs. Piles of clothes pool around his ankles – his own boxer shorts among the discard.
And he sees steam again. He’s crying – he doesn’t realise it, doesn’t feel it because the tears
“Hey, sorry. It was uh,” Steve sounds weary on the other side. “Bad timing.”
The suit. He’s in a suit.
this is the end.
Steve ends the session ten minutes after, whereupon Tony gratefully covers his lower half with a proffered towel.
She’s real. She’s
“Gary.” It sounds weaker than he intended. He clears he throat. “Gary, Sir.”
“I was going to be in the gym anyway. Same difference.”
Guess it’s time to update that LinkedIn profile.
“Me either.”
“His name was James Buchanan Barnes. He served the 107
The chirpy quality to the speaker’s baritone flashes down Tony’s spine and right into his crotch. “Uh, hello. I’m calling from Suite 616 –”
There’s a fix for that.
“He says, after the Chitauri incident…” That’s oversharing. Honesty is not always the best policy, and this is coming from Captain fucking America. Steve has half the heart of walking out right now, drenched and debauched with a cock as hard as rock sticking out from his pants, if only to shut Clint up. “You know what?” Clint suddenly laughs. “It doesn’t matter. We’re a team, we’re the
“General Ross,” she greets, and holds the door open to admit an elderly man with hoary hair and moustache. He is tall, and carries an air of military discipline in the way he marches into the ward. His stony expression does not betray what he thinks of Steve lying deathly still in his bed, before he shifts to look squarely at Tony.
brag about my nights – and why are you making this personal?”
“Captain Rogers. How are you feeling?” And Tony reaffirms his hold on Steve. This can go down either way, and he’d rather not involve the Extremis or a super-soldier punch. He’s not one to back out from fights, but this is one that he would bow out before Ross can say “Arrest!” Ross himself fortunately either believes it bad taste to harass a soldier in his sickbed, or is genuinely concerned about Steve’s wellbeing, that he reaches for a beeper dangling from the side of Steve’s bed, and presses it. Hurried footsteps grow louder in the corridor, and Ross retreats towards the far wall. “You have done this country a great service, Captain.” Steve is panting for air, and the front of his hospital gown is dotted with cold sweat. Never once did he allow Ross out of his sight. “Take good care of yourself. Get better.” The door swings open, and a team of medical staff rush through. Ross nods curtly at them. “We will be in touch with you again.”
“Jesus Christ – OK, pull over.
“Yeah.”
“Every team needs a leader.”
“I’ll find you. Go.”
. Steve releases Tony’s arm and mans the wheel more carefully, as he ignores the show Tony is no doubt putting on for him. Tongues delve into each other’s mouth, suckling and nipping at lips. Bodies fitting so perfectly into each other’s curves. Steve swears a motorcyclist did a double take at them as he overtook their car.
“I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry for not calling –”
in the goddam nose.
“I’ll go first,” Steve volunteers, and he holds his arms outstretched as they wave a sensor over and under him.
“Yeah, confidential stuff, I get.” He bats Steve’s protests away and collapses onto the nearest couch.
He wonders just how rosily tinted the glasses these money-pinching, myopic agencies are looking out of, if they could even
“Tony, that’s enough.” Steve pulls the flaming arm down. “I’ve known Maria since SHIELD took me in. I trust her.”
“A fever, maybe? I feel fine.”
“I’m human,” Tony wheezes out. This is the only time in his life that sentence ever makes sense in context, and
“The best time for me to gate-crash the party is right before they pop the champagne. Eleven, eleven-thirty?”
“Steve,” so softly Tony pleads, “please.”
Steve catches himself staring at a particularly ugly bruise on Tony’s stomach for far too long. Which is too bad, because Tony catches him first.
“Stark?” He didn’t call Tony in for the operation. “Is that you?”
He checks the timer on his phone. Twelve minutes.
“What do they need to access something like Insight? A supercomputer? A Pentium Two?” But Tony suddenly grasps him by the wrist, pulling him to a stop. Steve cocks his head at an angle. A curious “What?” goes unspoken.
What remains unspoken is Steve’s niggling worry that something more sinister might be at play here. Like, Loki. Maybe Loki lay his Asgardian hoodoo on Tony and mind-control him into doing this. Loki got one of them before. Or, maybe there was a blackmail going on. All valid concerns, but Steve can’t bring himself to justify them, so foolishly, he shrugs and says, “OK.”
He gets that it’s been a while, and already the foyer is unrecognisable. There’s a
“That’s not what you said about the repulsor engines. If I recall correctly, you gave me an energy bar for a job well done after you signed that contract.”
“Hands where I can see them!”
“Pass. Where’s Insight’s mission control?”
There’s always the alcohol in the minibar. Tony downs two cans of Bud in thirty minutes, swearing to heaven and earth that he will
“My reward?”
“This can’t be the data-point,” Tony concludes after one sweep across the monitors. “This technology is ancient.”
“I see the bombs. Frankly I’m disappointed. There isn’t enough firepower to blast the bank to kingdom come. Ah, here we go. Run it by the Captain, J.”
He will be missed.
“This one’s without sesame seeds.”
Steve closes the distance in a heartbeat, his battered knuckles breaking into jaws.
He swears to God, he will splash chilled beer all over Steve’s face through the window’s opening if it comes down to that.
“Sir? Simulations haven’t decided if –”
He’s pretty certain his entire person is made up of bruises, and for that, he gives his endless thanks to the heavens above. He’s fine, he can move, he can shrug off this thick slab of concrete that’s keeping him sandwiched between freedom and doom. When the dust settles, Steve strains his ears for signs of movements. The grounds above is still scorched, so time can’t have passed too much since the drop. He dares to poke his head out of his hidey hole, and sees only darkness.
And Steve spills out of the car, his entire weight crashing into Tony’s middle. He’s almost thrown off his feet, but he grabs Steve around his shoulders and back, grounding them both.

“Nazi Germany. And we’re

Clint, can’t a man have some peace washing up?”
“They’re developing an algorithm for Insight to choose its targets. Anyone with potential to be a threat. Our bank records, medical histories, voting patterns, e-mails, phone calls, SAT scores. This algorithm evaluates people’s past to predict their future. They plan to neutralise threats before they happen.”
Steve isn’t a quiet worker. His head bobs with vigour, and he slurps. Saliva dribbles down his chin; the glistening track so clear for Tony to see when Steve changes angle to get
“No reason why they’ve been playing up the terror. What’s the sense in seeding public unrest otherwise?”
“Got to be honest, man. You’re as red as a boiled lobster.”
Tony skids to a halt and Steve almost walks right into him. Nobody ever suggested visiting the Starks at the family cemetery. Tony himself hasn’t been there in years. But, he can do this. He has time to indulge Steve like this. On the way there, he stops by the florist to buy five stalks of pink carnations, packed with Baby’s Breath all held together with a white satin ribbon. Steve notices Tony doesn’t flirt with the young lady as he hands her a bill.
instead is pinned against the closet. He’ll never be Steve’s equal when it comes to hand-to-hand. Doesn’t stop him for trying. Steve’s arm flicker, and Tony locks it first with his elbow.
Tony clamps a fist over his mouth and doubles over, eyes scrunched up as his face flames up. Steve clears his throat again, catching himself staring at Tony for two seconds too long and quickly nods at something Fury says. Probably nothing of grave consequence.
“Good.”
Pierce arranged for him in the elevator as he was exiting the Triskelion. He got to know a cattle prod of some sort up close and personal. The small of his back is still sensationless. It was a no holds bar thrash party he’s glad he got out of by cannonballing out of the elevator cabin from the fifteenth floor.

“Seven, maybe more.”
“… I’ll be there,” Steve volunteers. Tony is already shooting him an are-you-
“I’m so sorry about this, Sir,” Steve apologises sincerely. Using the sidemirror to pinpoint STRIKE’s position, he quickly dashes sideway and flings his shield with such accuracy, all four are knocked out as it careens gracefully back.
“Who’s playing backup?”
and then have a moral debate with –”
“Oh, this again?” Tony’s voice bounces off the wood panel. “That sexy time we had in the gym was really something else, wasn’t it?”
Steve realises belatedly that the bag is starting to spill sand from the seams. He’s been working at this long enough, time to tap out. There are also footsteps shuffling from the adjacent corridor. He’s certainly hogged the facility enough.
Forensics told him the shield was clean. Another dead end, then. No matter, he can worry about that later. Right now?
“Mr Stark! What is the reason behind exposing this video on Facebook? Do you suspect malicious attempt by a specific group, perhaps a case of defamation –”
Oh, God, this –
Something just enters in the library. Sounds heavy, tinged metallic. Another footstep.
Even here, it’s dark – he’s scared.
“Stay safe, Tony,” Steve reminds him with a hint of urgency. “Take your suit with you everywhere you go.”
“Nope.” He sinks deeper into his swivel chair and props his legs on the table. “Has Steve accessed the Mandarin folders on the tablet?”
“Tired.” The hands depart, each sliding sideways to hug along Tony’s flanks. They crawl upward, kneading the ribs. Tony instinctively holds his breath, until Steve returns to his shoulders. “Anxious, is the word, I believe.”
He doesn’t like the way Steve is
“Lafayette, Virginia.”
After a long, considering pause, Ross nods slowly, and Tony turns to Pepper fully. He doesn’t speak, but he knows Pepper hears him

is the calm before the storm, and Tony – for all the resources that he has – has decided what he can do with it. “It’s over, Steve,” he whispers, but he might as well have shouted it, given how stricken Steve looks at the admission. It’s the only sane solution. “This isn’t a fight we can win. HYDRA and SHIELD – they’re different. They’re
“When we cross path with the Soldier again, please, I beg you, Tony. Let me talk to him first.”
The gap of Tony’s absence is an abyss, never-ending. His presence has been a constant, one Steve has grown accustomed to. The passenger seat grows cold without his heat, and Steve watches Tony walk towards the shed where the keeper is seated, minding his teller machine. He wants to help, too. But, Tony’s right. He’s done. His body weighs a tonne and his eyes won’t stay peeled.
“Prove it.”
“Best experience and services you say, hmm?” Shut his blabbering, incoherent trap

“You know why I’m here.”
Steve can’t catch up with Tony sometimes. It’s the multifaceted life and persona that confuses the crap out of him, or maybe it’s the way modern society is. Something Steve can’t get used to, and that’s either a great shame, or a gift. Can’t get used to Tony coming to him quiet and contemplative, perhaps in search of an answer, or guidance – Steve suspects – like right now. His demeanour, earlier fraught with naughty contempt has completely lifted, leaving only a husk of a weary man shouldering the guilt of his life’s works.
Tony appears out of thin air and surveys the occupants in the kitchen. Steve is kind of miffed that Tony kind of glances at him, preferring to address Clint with all the chumminess of a decade-old friend. “I see you’re back. Since when?” They chat – by “they”, Steve means Clint and Tony – and it strikes him as odd, because Tony is incapable of being socially ungraceful. Steve chalks it up to Tony being raised in front of camera, under the spotlight of public attention and scrutiny, in the embrace of fair-weather-friends and wolves-in-sheep’s’-clothing.
“It’s difficult to get a read on you these days, Rogers.” It’s a rarely-heard shift in inflection. Tony’s voice dips a pitch and he hums as his fingers – cold to Steve’s flesh, but Steve has always burnt coal hot – wrap around their girths. Steve prefers this version of Tony by a mile, because in this headspace, there’s no sarcasm, no triggering jokes. Just Tony eyeballing his target. He gives them both some lazy strokes, foreskins retracting to reveal glistening heads, Tony’s already beading with precum.
There’s an unmistakable cheer in Zola’s artificial intonations. “HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security. Once the purification process is complete, HYDRA’s new world order will arise. We won, Captain. Your death amounts to the same as your life – a zero sum.”
“It wasn’t him,” Steve whispers. “His mind is not his own.”
“Breathe, Mr Stark.”
Which turns out to be biometric-secured. Tony flattens his palm against a pad, and the door clicks.
Step three is to keep a lookout for the window of action.
“Missed you, Cap.”
“No. You’re… you’re really something else, aren’t you?”
And then, those large hands push upward from the back of his knee towards his buttocks again, past the
“Sure you are.”
“Lie on your back. Let me attend to your front.”
“Yeah! Amazing.
“The Tower.” There’s a hint of a yawn in that admission. “I’m flying the suit in remote.”
“I didn’t volunteer for this, Rogers,” Tony barks his protests once they breach the perimeter of the parking lot. “I’m leaving.”
– he thinks, by the end of the day, there’ll be a new skylight in the gym’s ceiling. Not charging
Fifteen minutes,
“No, no – don’t do this!”
“– that can be easily abused –”
– the passenger seat is bundled up in faded T-shirts, sort of like a makeshift seat cover, so Tony helps himself to one.
“I’ll be using more force here. Your waist feels terribly tense. Any recent injuries around this area that you’re aware of?”
Sounds
“Let go – let me go!”
His eyes seek out Steve’s, and his voice is strained when he asks for permission to go to the gents. No wisecracking, just an honest expression for his desire to leave the room.
He can’t help it. “I win.”
“Steve said the arc reactor gave you some problem the last few weeks. Nothing some painkillers won’t fix, but he told me to watch you while he’s away on SHIELD duty.”
“Who fired it?”
“OK,” he locks himself in the car and checks his surroundings swiftly. The park has fewer folks around. It is past dinner time after all. “How do I do that? What do I say?”
A youthful Agent evidently believes otherwise. “With due respect, Mr Stark, Project Insight is but a pipedream until your tech comes along.”
It takes Tony a full minute to shake himself out of the weirdass situation, and two prompt lines later, his earpiece crackles as Steve speak again. “You alright there?”
“Hello, this is Spa Pendry,” a male voice greets him.
Steve doesn’t like the tinge of challenge trailing the question.
“Affirmative. Be careful.”
detailed medical report. Very entertaining. I almost vomited on the spot.” At least Steve has the decency to look conflicted and miserable – and he should damn well be. Making up excuses for a bloodthirsty lunatic, seriously. Did Barnes beat him up too much it addled him? “So don’t ask me to
“Don’t baby me –”
Tony flings the shield, and immediately opens fire at the assassin. The few shots that did not go wide bounce of his metal arm – one ricochets that it grazes him in the shoulder.
“Very well, Bambi, thank you.” He should take her out for lunch sometime. She’s been such a dear to Pepper, helping her out at work, the Yang to Tony’s Yin at managing Pepper’s temper. “Did you mention Captain Rogers?”
“I apologise, Mr Stark,” she flushes, and instantly scoots a good yard away from her desk under Steve’s piercing gaze. “I didn’t know you were in between meetings.”
Tony unzips his jumpsuit fully. The brilliance of his arc reactor goes blissfully unnoticed by the escort. His fully erect cock, already sporting a moisty head lies proudly against his lower abdomen.
Tony waves, and the man is soon on his merry way to Subway next door. Steve leads them to the elevators, occasionally nodding and greeting at passing men and women with a friendly, “Agent.”
Then Tony very successfully takes his mind off Bucky with his far-fetched plan about hijacking a TV van and its antenna. Something about needing the extra firepower. Why specifically a TV van – because that vehicle is so commonplace – instead of say, borrowing a computer on display in the mall Steve will never find out, because Tony rambles on, going into specifics. Tony’s droning soon loses its magic. Bucky’s face is still front and centre on the tablet, and Steve is cradling it.
“Take this however you want it, Tony.”
“… Steve says to keep an eye out on you.”
because I’m sharing a table with you.”
“And… go.” He runs his commands, and waits. This should either take less than ten seconds… or blow up spectacularly in his face. “How are we looking?”
“Yeah, give me a second.”
Gravels crunch as someone approaches.
“I’m sorry,” Tony breathes, and he vanishes into the bathroom.
“Pardon the Freudian slip.”
“Well, tough. I haven’t had time to implement it fully. And the algorithm hasn’t even been debugged.” He offs the tablet and pushes it back to Pepper. “By the way, we never discussed this with outsiders, right? How did this get out? Who’s interested?”
Tony almost walks into a five-feet tall Dracaena shrub on his exit. “Steve,” he greets chirpily. “Hey there.” Steve the masseur, who else is there, as kismet will have it. All decked out in his uniform that flatters all the right bulges and angles.

was secretly instructed to chair a covert commission to, shall we say, keep a lookout on extraordinary activities in the community. We codenamed it Wide Awake.”
“Hi,” Tony begins, wincing as the crown of his skull pulses. “Don’t think we’ve met. What’s your name?”
Birds’ chirpings are soon drowned by the approaching crunch of rubber tyres on dirt, and the front of Steve’s car roars into the vicinity. Tony stands up and dusts his pants, and pretends it doesn’t irk him when Steve gives him a badly disguised once over.
direction. “Can’t you hack into the electronics of his car? This is a wild goose chase.”
Not taking his eyes off the signboard, he croaks, “You sure this is the place?”
With absurd ease, Steve flips Tony around until he’s bracketing the drunken form, all sprawled out on the mat. Not one to give up so easily, Tony braces Steve by his narrow waist and bucks

They must be that ecstatic to welcome their new guests into their fold, judging by their slack expression and fingers tightening over the trigger. The one on the right has the right idea. “How sure are we they’re who they are?”
What is wrong with him?
At least the floor is dry, and there are no missing tiles from the roof. A far cry from the Ritz, but it’ll have to do. Steve lays Tony on a plastic tarp, and coaxes him to lean against the brick wall.
“Yeah, they’re not. You and I never, uh…” Tony’s frantic gesturing at the space between Steve and himself is rather unnecessary. “Here’s the thing. The human mind is a wonderful petri dish for actual long-term memories and
Tony watches the scab falls off – completely healed – like the gash never happened before. He looks at Steve, and slowly turns to the window pane where he catches his own reflection.
Steve slides under Tony’s waistband, and he works on it furiously, no preamble, no holding back, and Tony finds himself shuddering against Steve’s broad frame, gasping for mercy. Touching him raw like that – there’s pleasure to be sought in his discomfort –
Tony straightens up again, and this time, he watches the epitaph that’s carved under Howard’s name. “No. I get where they’re coming from, but we’re talking

“Captain Rogers, Sir, Commander Fury is approaching in thirty seconds.”
This is sadly exactly how he envisions things to happen. He still has his other foot in the hallway outside. Just a word, say “no” and he’s gone. Like dust in the wind. He holds his breath, until Fury’s single eye bore into his very skull…
“No one with clearance level above four was on deck, except for one Agent. Still, unlikely that they were gunning for anyone SHIELD.” The shower screen slides open and Tony looks up into the mirror, razor already poised for a quick shave. “Can you pass me the shampoo, please? Can’t find any here.”
Twelve hours ago, Fury dispatched the Avengers to a ghost ship just 27 nautical miles off the Gulf of Mexico. Sounds like a run of the mill assignment – SHIELD scientists detected strange electromagnetic signals emanating from the ship’s belly, and wanted to know the what, who and why. Of the Avengers’ active roster, only Steve and Tony were on the premise. After four hours of passive-aggressively ignoring each other while chilling in the confinement of a two-seater Quinjet, Steve expertly brings her to the jump-off point, holding her steady at constant velocity as Tony – all dressed up in the swanky Mark VII – leaps off it. The first thing Tony said to him was, “Nothing on heat, motion and EM. Probably a dud, Cap.”
“Tony is with me on my insistence. You want to win a war against Insight, you need him.”
“Someone’s been here recently,” Tony whispers, and kills the flashlight. “Says ‘ASP’ on the door. What does it mean?”
“Captain, this devise is set to unlock by voice-activation.”
“… Right.” A familiar haughtiness crosses his face.  “‘Cause I’m nothing without the suit.”

.” Steve wedges a knee between Tony’s thighs, and forces one side of that arrogant cheek against the door. “You just don’t know when to stop, do you?”
Both eye sockets are alight with flames.
“Hey.” Must’ve been quite a mission, whatever it is that Fury sics on Captain America two weeks ago. Though his helmet hair and crumpled sweater doesn’t take away the overall… wholesome, handsome, youthful machoism from Steve Rogers, Tony still notes the slight edge in his voice, and agitation in his movement that translates to, “Let me guess, mission was major suckage?”
“Stay back!”
Both their pants pooling around their ankles in the next heartbeat, Steve slides his half-mast cock between the crack of Tony’s butt. “Gay enough for you?” he snarls into the ear before him, and thrusts his hip a few times, his cock sliding over Tony’s morning wood.
He speed-dials Steve, and proceeds to having his call rejected after three
Nada.
That midnight though, Fury calls. Not SHIELD, not STRIKE –
“Captain Rogers.”
“Show me, or I’ll help myself.”
This time, Steve heeds his conscience. He mumbles an apology, and runs.
“… About that.” And Tony’s voice trails off as he bends down to collect his screwdriver from the floor. “I’ve had several… unfortunate run-ins with this schmuck who calls himself ‘Ghost’. I don’t have a name, or a face. He freelances as an industrial saboteur, hitting corporations that he sees as corrupt – and that includes Stark Industries, apparently. His attacks are usually small-scale and easily resolved, so I don’t bother updating his particulars on the Avengers’ watch-out list. My fault. Don’t look at me like that. I’m an honest businessman! I play by the rulebook, pay my taxes on time –”
Eighty years ago – he was thirteen – one autumn morning, he was down this Brooklyn alley doing the usual foxtrot with the neighbourhood bullies. He had a shoulder dislocated and an eye swollen so bad he couldn’t see out of it, but it was worth it. They were mugging Old Lady Smith who lived at the corner of 14
for his tenants to stop leaving rotten chimichanga in the fridge. So, what? Tony has his laundry list of character flaws – ask anyone – but he’s a gracious host. Steve has a personal study because Tony figures the pond must run deep with somebody who prances around with a capital “A” on his forehead dressed up in the country’s flag for the most of his adult life. Steve wants to offer the privacy of said room for their discussion, when Tony says first, “Come to my study. It’s pretty much sealed in.”
On the sixth consecutive day of The Invisible Iron Man, Steve almost wants to impersonate food delivery guys. Tony only speaks to them these days.
Steve pushes it back to him. “You keep the lady’s.”
“But, I can’t –”
He throws his body weight fully against the door, not trusting his legs to keep him up any longer. He slides the bolt in place, double locks it, and for good measure, piles a ladder and a rather heavy worktable across the door. His bracelet is still blinking furiously in green. That’s good, that means he still has a chance of safeguarding the generators.
He’s carried to someplace… some other corner of his garage… there are gaping holes in his ceiling dammit, his suits must’ve blasted their way out like that. He could too, if only there’s a suit he could get into. Escape. Reach out and fly away.
And then.
, all things considered. Is this how living like a super-soldier is? I can get used to this.”
Without any sense of self-preservation – or maybe he just trusts Tony a lot – Steve sticks his right arm out, and the right gauntlet floats over before it, opens up like a sandwich maker and closes again around Steve’s hand. The match is somewhat clunky, there are spots that feel too loose, and his ring finger feels pinched. Steve laughs a little as he admires his mechanical palm, and proceed to summoning the rest of the limbs to him.
“I never received them. The signals must’ve been jammed.”
“Tony, Bucky – he’s –”
“That’s
Steve hopes that amount of verbal menacing was enough to keep Tony on his best behaviour twenty-four seven, eight days a week. What happens instead is, he doesn’t see Tony in person for the next four days. Unsettling. He purposely parks himself in shared areas of the Tower, the kitchen mostly, because despite the sprawling floorspace the Tower has, Tony only stashes his best coffee beans in this cabinet
“I think I’ve weaned off my dependency on simulations somewhat. Six percent to the gauntlets, J!”
and the floor-to-ceiling window. “I’m gonna do something really, really stupid.”
“Rumlow, do you copy?” a nearby walkie-talkie buzzes.
“… OK.”
Not one to judge a book by its cover, but Steve looks a decade younger than Tony, easy. A young man with ambitions. Tony remembers what it was like at the age, before he parks his soul behind a mahogany desk in a corner office on the fiftieth floor. “What a coincidence. I live there.”
“… That’s the idea, yes.”
“There’s a public briefing and viewing session from the deck at ten,” Steve raps under his breath, and Tony stops tapping on his keyboard. “The press and guests of honour will stay there for the launching. That’s twelve. Lunch will be served at twelve-thirty.”
“Don’t fight them!”
“Yeah.”
With surprisingly steady hands, he lifts his shirt and bites at the hem, keeping his chest exposed and the light from the reactor comes forth unhindered.
Tony perks up. “You fixed them?”
Steve fixes himself quickly and they soon board the six thirty shuttle bus. Oddly enough, they pass security checks without hassle. No pat downs, no biometrics – all they have to do is to place their ID face down on a scanner and be granted access to possibly all fifty-something floors of the Triskelion complex.
“The Helicarriers will be launched eleven in the morning tomorrow. There’s an afterparty in the White House, if you’re interested in attending.”
. That’s good enough a reason to be back in DC.”
“Don’t – I’m…” He rakes a shaky hand through his hair. “Upstairs. Now. Excuse me.”
Rhetoric. Steve says nothing.
“You have a better one?”
And something’s burning.
Tony hesitates a fraction. “Your slot?”
Nothing like this can be kept secret for long anyway. Not that it’s anything insidious, something forbidden to be partaken in the shadows. Steve knows he’s only beginning to embrace this whole-heartedly. And when the news
“You must understand, Steve. When I go out in that suit, I’m not just one guy. I’m the collective intellect of all the supercomputers combined, because I
“Son, you either keep it down, or I’ll have to chokehold you until we’re done borrowing your truck. What will it be?”
That does it. Steve grabs him by the front of his shirt, hauls him in and slams him against the door to close it.
“That’s a bit ostentatious, even for you.
Then, all the way from the far end of the corridor, something rattles – metal on metal – and it’s heading towards them. They stand up, the cacophony impossible to ignore. A pair of nurses half-jog through the large door, stainless steel crash cart in tow. They spare them not even a chance of glance. Tony hates this bit about hospitals. So much action, yet sometimes, so
“Very astute observation.” He
“You need to be careful, Tony.”
“He gave his life to protect us, Tony. That
Miraculously, he makes it to the hospital in one piece, not even a dent on his car. He parks it haphazardly by the curb and only needs to follow the breadcrumbs SHIELD is dropping. Rows and rows of agents, all armed to the
Son of a bitch.
Said car is a gorgeous Audi R8 that Tony uses for his billionaire-equivalent of a milk run. It’s also the one Tony loves tinkering with the most. Steve knows the windows have tricks. They’re coated with an experimental nanofiber that turns opaque when electric pulses through them. It’s Tony’s ingenious idea of having his cake and eating it too, by not-quite-flouting traffic regulations on glass tints. Too bad it’s come to bite him back in the ass. Steve intends to fully take advantage of it.
“… Because you’re sorry?”
Two smacks on the roof later, Tony is again slaving away on his computer – so something must’ve worked. The truck shakes again as Gary descends. All right, he’ll bite. His main concern is Gary tattling on them, but would he really after doing Tony a favour?
“… Huh?”
They offer to host him at the Triskelion, or somewhere in DC should he want to wait for Steve. He declines. They offer to drive him home. Again, he declines. Not one to give up so easily, they then offer to chaperone him back to New York. He tells them to bugger off. Politely. There’s an unsettling chill in his spine, their nicety like poison. He tells them he's leaving, and they let him.
Rough finger pads scrape against the underside of his scrotum, and Tony finds it really tough to compute what Steve has just said.
Just as he sets his phone on his pillow, Steve’s right hand creeps up to his throat. Oily fingers unfurl to choke him – they’re loose, but Tony has stopped breathing – and a gust of warm air billows by his earlobe. “I remind you, Mr Stark, you can end this anytime.” And Steve’s free hand drops inside his pants to pump along his unyielding cock.
“Come on, love. Let’s get you cleaned up and go back to bed.”
“Go, Babe, you go. M’fine. Be right here waiting when you get back.” He waved a hand in Steve’s direction, like he wanted to touch his face, and Steve caught it and kissed his palm.
The AI's voice was cool when she replied. “Boss is in Sergeant Barnes’ room. He is sleeping and should not be disturbed.”
With that, Steve ran his fingers through the puddle of precome that had gathered on Tony’s navel and wrapped a hand around his cock, forgoing the light teasing touches to grasp him firmly around the base. Tony’s mouth fell open, but he held back his moan, and his hips quivered, but he didn’t move and Steve hummed in approval and began to stroke, slowly at first, but quickly picking up speed.
He returned the smile and stood, wincing a little at the soreness he felt. It was something he usually valued the morning after, enjoying the reminder of what only Steve had ever really been able to do for him, but this time, it was clouded by the memories of the drop instead and he wasn't enjoying it nearly as much. He collected the jar of ointment from the bedside table, and fought the blush he felt trying to rise.
Bucky's arms tightened around him as he moved and Tony tried to extricate himself without waking the other man. He thought it would be best to do this walk of shame without having a conversation about it, and hopefully before anyone else was awake to see him emerge from a bedroom that wasn't his. He was so focused on trying not to wake Bucky that he nearly jumped out of his skin when he spoke.
"I don't- I can't- Not in there, come on let's go to the-" Not the bedroom. Tony quickly realized he couldn't have this conversation there either. "Workshop. Let's go talk in the workshop." That was Tony's safe place, the place he retreated to whenever he needed to hide from the rest of the world and lose himself in the frenzy of creation until his mind quieted.
Bucky just looked at him for a moment, unable to comprehend what he meant. He knew that Steve was stupidly in love with the small genius and there was no way he had broken up with him.
Bucky cut him off and knelt directly in front of him. “Stop. You
“Tony. Can you tell me what’s wrong? Are you hurt?” Bucky’s experience was enough that he had an idea, at least in general, of what went on between Tony and Steve. But he didn’t have first hand experience taking care of someone afterward like this, so he was mostly playing it by ear, and trusting his instincts and Tony’s cues to let him know what he needed to do.
"Okay, that's kinda hot in the middle of sex, but you don't own me. Still, I'm not asking you to share me. That's not really my thing either. I just want to know that there's someone I can trust to call if I drop like that again and you can't be here."
wrong, that he’d driven Steve away, hadn’t been good enough, strong enough, and now he was alone, so alone, just like he knew he always would  be. Steve was gone and Tony sat alone, crying his heartache on the kitchen floor.
from the Stuckony Discord for Beta-ing this chapter for me.
Tony froze at the entrance to the kitchen suddenly enough that Steve actually bumped into his back.
“Sergeant Barnes, would you come to the kitchen please?” Bucky glanced up curiously, wondering why she needed him in the kitchen.
to be there when he woke in the morning. After a moment, Bucky huffed and brushed Steve’s hand away, but there was no rancor in the motion.
“God, I love you.” Steve leaned in for one last kiss, a sweet brush of their lips together and Tony smiled as he pulled back.
The elevator room the upper floors was far to slow for him, but still faster than even he could have run 80 flights of stairs, so he forced himself to stand still as he watched the floor numbers climb. There was no one else in the common  room so early when he finally exited the elevator, so he asked Friday, “Where is Tony?”
There was a moment’s pause before the AI answered, “There is an ointment Captain Rogers usually applies to ease the pain and speed healing. They were interrupted before he could use it this evening.”
This time, it was Bucky who looked away with a touch of pink growing on his cheeks.
go back to sleep.” He soothed Tony softly, and folded the comforter over to double the weight pressing down on the smaller man. He quieted under Bucky’s care, and quickly settled back down to sleep .
“Steve,
---//---
Tony gazed at Steve, eyes already a little glassy. He opened his mouth to answer but snapped it shut before any sound came out and nodded instead. Steve hummed in approval and slid a hand up under Tony's shirt to rub a thumb over one of his nipples.
Bucky smiled at the AI’s caution, and quickly gave his permission. “Yeah Fri, s’long as Tony’s in there, you can surveil to your heart’s content.”
Tony smiled dreamily, a blissful expression still on his face. “M’good, Babe. That was amazing. Gonna hurt in the morning.” He leaned towards Steve, pressing against the hand that was stroking his hair. “Cuddles now?” he asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
But part of wondered if he should have let Steve take his place and just spent the rest of the night on the couch. Tony belonged to Steve after all. Was he really going to be okay waking up next to Bucky in the morning? Or was Bucky just so starved for affection that he was using this as an excuse to take it where he could? Maybe he was being selfish and was no better than Steve had been, taking advantage of Tony’s compromised state of mind?
"I ain't disturbed. What about you? Didja sleep okay?"
"Hmm, probably Pepper or Rhodey would be my first choice. They both...understand. I wouldn't have to make awkward explanations and they would both be willing."
"You're welcome, Tony. It's what teammates do, yeah?"
“Captain Rogers left the tower after receiving a text message from Mr. Wilson.” Bucky frowned, wondering what could have been so important that he would leave Tony alone in this state. Well, it didn’t really matter right now. Seeing Tony like this triggered Bucky’s protective instincts, the same ones that had him pulling his little Stevie out of fights from one end of Brooklyn to the other back when they were kids. But that was a long time ago, and if he didn’t have a good explanation for this situation, Bucky would be the one kicking Steve’s ass. But that would come later. All that mattered to him right now was taking care of Tony and making sure he was alright.
Tony shuffled out of the room and towards the communal kitchen. No one else was there, and he fumbled with the coffee maker, his hands trembling and seemingly unable to find the right button to start the coffee brewing. He let out a small cry of frustration and sank down to the floor in front of the machine, knees pulled up and arms wrapped around them. He leaned against the cabinet and fought to hold back the tears filling his eyes.
"You are going to lay there and take everything I give you because you deserve to feel good, and I know best how to make that happen. You will not move or speak or make any sound at all, unless you need to use your safeword. Do you understand?"
Tony considered the possibility of turning to Bucky
"No." Steve's objection was flat and unyielding. "I'm sorry, but no. I'm not comfortable having one of your exes that intimately involved in our relationship. Hard limit."
Tony wanted nothing more than to lose himself in the kiss and
He slipped his phone back into his pocket and reached for Tony, picking him up and cradling him easily in his arms. Tony muttered and pushed against his chest for a moment before he gave in and slumped against Bucky, resting his head on his shoulder. He sucked in a pained breath as Bucky’s grip tightened around his hips and Bucky frowned again.  Tony didn’t look or act injured; what would cause him to-
He paused for a moment then snapped a picture of the crying genius curled up on himself on the kitchen floor and sent that to Steve as well. It might have been a touch cruel, but he knew Steve and knew he sometimes let his priorities get mixed up. There was literally nothing Bucky could imagine that would justify leaving Tony like this, so the picture was just in case Steve might need a reminder of exactly where his priorities should be right now.
Steve groaned in frustration and kissed Tony’s forehead. He wanted nothing more than to climb into the bed, soiled sheets and all, and hold Tony close, but Sam wouldn’t have messaged like that lightly. If he said 911, then it was a true life and death emergency, and Steve needed to go.
With that, Steve grabbed Tony and pulled him in flush against his body, one hand gripping his hair and tugging lightly as he tipped his face up for a kiss. He broke it too soon, however, and Tony whined at the loss. Steve leaned down to nip along his jaw until his lips were by Tony's ear before he spoke.
“Friday, this isn’t funny. Let me through.” His voice was low and stern when he spoke and he clearly expected the door to open immediately. When it didn’t, he continued more sharply, “Open the door, now!”
It didn’t even occur to him to wonder why Tony was in Bucky’s room as he turned in that direction, ignoring the AI’s suggestion that Tony be left to sleep. At least, he ignored her until the security door slid out of the wall to block the hallway, forcing him to slide to a stop.
He cursed under his breath; this was the worst possible time.
Bucky marveled for a moment at the idea of
He set the water bottle on the table by the bed, and gave Tony a quick wipe down, shifting him away from the spot where his cooling release now stained the sheets. He didn’t have time to change them, but figured it would hold until he got back. He dropped the cloth to the floor and knelt beside the bed.
, stop. We have to talk first." Steve finally let him go with a sigh and a last kiss pressed against his forehead. Tony gave him a smile and reached for his hand as they walked towards the kitchen.
"I- yeah, that'd be nice." Bucky smiled softly at Tony, no sign of his usual teasing smirk. Tony was starting to equate that smirk to his own press smile, and found that he much preferred the real thing.
Today had been a rough day and he was having trouble organizing his thoughts enough to write them down. Or was it yesterday that had been rough? It was late, but he wasn’t sure just what time it was. He was still staring at the blank page when Friday’s lilting voice sounded softly in his room.
"Shh, no Doll, you ain't gotta apology for nothing." Bucky interrupted him gently but firmly. He clearly wasn't going to hear any kind of apology from Tony.
"Bucky."
“Please confirm permission to activate surveillance in your bedroom, Sergeant. That is outside my normal security protocols.”
Tony slipped out of the room and let the door close behind him. He padded barefoot down the hall towards the common room with the jar he held hidden by the sleeve of Steve's too-big shirt. He was so lost in his thoughts as he crossed the room that he didn’t see Steve there until he walked right into his broad chest. He let out a yelp as he stumbled back, but Steve’s arms wrapped around him before he could fall and pulled him back into a tight, almost desperate embrace.
Once he reached the bathroom, he looked at the mirror and grimaced at his reflection. No wonder Steve had left him alone, he looked awful with his hair a mess, skin blotchy, and dark circles under his eyes.
“Buck, I don’t think- I need to see him now; he needs me.” Steve turned to head back towards the hallway that led to Bucky’s room where Tony was now sleeping. Bucky reacted with  lightning fast speed, grabbing his arm to stop him from heading down the hall.
! Focusing heat into the now-emptied pistol, it burns red hot in his grasp. The black mask the assassin has on that covers more than half of his face – Tony only notices that – doesn’t effectively quell the look of surprise in his grey eyes.
happy when the doctors make him stay in another one for another hour. Minimum. It’s cold enough that he wants to conjure a friendly flame the size of a golf ball, and what he wants, he gets. But the nurse freaks out when she sees it, and that’s how he ends up with two SHIELD agents totting guns standing guard by his door.
“… The Mandarin, huh. And what I imagine every follower in his faction. Oh, son of a bitch.”
“How is Steve?” She slips her petite hand between the railings to grasp Steve’s limp one. She squeezes, and Tony looks away. He does that every other hour too, if only to assure himself that Steve hasn’t accidentally passed in his sleep.
“You don’t have a Facebook account?” Natasha dabs at her lips with a paper napkin. “Interesting. Have you by any chance, uh, seen Tony around? On your way here, maybe?”
“You don’t mean that.”
“Just a temporary barrier, Captain Rogers,” Vision explains coolly. “For both your safety. Retreat. Agent Romanoff and Barton are on their way.”
“Thank you.”
December first, it’s a Friday, and eight-thirty in the morning. Hello, Manhattan. Steve Rogers pulls the sheets off his waist and makes no heed to the snow blanketing the streets below, if only he bothers to look out of his window from the forty-fifth storey. Anyway, since it’s December, he’s expecting the Tower to get lit up at night like a giant, phallus-like Christmas tree – screams of Stark in every way imaginable – so he might as well do the sight-seeing after dinner.
“Stop that.”
what he means to. He pulls the zipper of Tony’s jumpsuit all the way down, and takes hold of the spent cock, ruined by semen.
Tony yawns so widely tears prickle at the brim of his eyes, and he stretches in his stupidly tiny plastic chair like a rubber band pulled taut. He stubs his toe against the bedframe – again – and is tired enough that he cans it and not complain to Steve. Like Steve could answer him anyway. Look at him, so sound asleep, oblivious to the goings of the world. Time waits no man, not even Steve Rogers, and time has forgotten about him for all of seventy years.
Taking advantage of the lifting veil of night, Tony creeps past a pickup truck that’s parked in a secluded corner of the neighbourhood’s park – so this is where he has unknowingly crash-landed. The signboard hammered into the moist earth under a large bodock tree bears these words in black paint:
“Geez, antique. Steve, introduce your knuckles to this thingy here!”
“They say this gives you powers.” Metal fingers trace the outline of the arc reactor.
“Clint –”
Fury sits in his chair and gestures to a vacant one opposite him. “Stark still giving you trouble?”
“Shall we try something different this time? Sit up please.”
Seriously,
“Stark, is that you?”
a misstep means tetanus –
, he presses the heels of his palms into his eyeballs until he sees stars. He should’ve just gouged them up with a spoon and be done with this.
“Good job, Stark.”
“Look! It’s Rogers! He’s by the elevator!”
Still, a bunch of LEDs aren’t enough to illuminate the grounds. They stumble around half-blind, and Tony makes sure to stay half a step behind Steve. “Place still looks familiar? Changed much?”
to jump the gun. He can’t tolerate a second longer of SHIELD’s grubby paws on his tech, not when he suspects something is rotten in Denmark.
“They want us here.”
– how long it took us to schedule that meeting with Ackard? How many strings I have to pull to get you that forty-five minutes, and you what,
“… If you have another plan, I’m all ears.”
Another squeak from Gary’s corner puts an almighty frown on Tony’s face, and he spins the chair away from his audience of one, clearing his throat as he goes. This is as good as it gets, then, Steve surmises, deliberately not looking at his bulge and willing himself to think of boiled cabbage and mouldy bread instead.
“On purpose? He hasn’t been sleeping?”
Fuck it all to hell, yeah? Steve doesn’t know how far he’s willing to go with the Extremis. He can set this room on fire. Explode. He can char the brains out of Steve’s skull. All of those with an express thought. And before he knows it, there is wetness dripping off the tip of his nose, and he backpedals a safe distance away from Steve, eyes rabid as Steve slowly eases off the closet.
surrounded by Fury’s men – he recognises those people, even amidst the cloud of agony of bones and ligaments cracking into their rightful places. They won! They’d vanquished the big bad –
“… What makes you think this is hard on me?”
Tony nearly misses Steve's barely-there whisper. “Nick showed up at my place, all torn up. He said, don’t trust anyone.” He almost freaks out when Steve’s forehead come to rest on his shoulder. “Eyes and ears everywhere.” Steve’s so close Tony catches a faint whiff of copper and sweat. “
There’s a fire in his heart, he feels it. He tastes smoke and ash in his throat, and his chest heaves. He’s hacking out
“Where is Captain Steve Rogers?”
“Nick said the drive comes from the Lemurian Star.”
Steve snorts, but keeps his attention glued to the road ahead. “Don’t mind me though. I promise not to get us killed in a car crash.”
Tony’s mouth is on him again. His head bobs up and down, before he tilts to the side and brushes Steve’s cock against his tongue and cheek and roof – everywhere, Steve’s flavour must be intoxicating –
He needs another helping of that scotch.
His pants magically pool around his ankles.
“… I know.”
“Steve, please understand!”
The whine of a miniaturised gauntlet repulsor intensifies. “Oh, don’t tempt me.” Tony takes his aim. “Just give me a reason.”
harms your body, if it has side-effects we don’t know about. I want to play safe. We don’t have time for unnecessary risks.”
that will soon come forth from that moustached mouth, will shock him.
“Tony –”
“Shit.” They both wince as the window above their head smashes when pierced by a bullet. “What’s the plan?”
“I don’t know if you noticed,” Tony chirps airily as Steve manoeuvres the car into a parallel park, “your beard makes for a good disguise.”
“How are you holding up, Cap?”
Tissue be damned. He ejaculates all over his front, and Steve, completely unapologetic about making a mess in the workshop, proceeds to scooping the goop on Tony’s stomach into his palm, and slathers it over his own weeping cock. It’s really a shame that at this age, Tony’s refraction time is so appalling, so he only watches as Steve masturbates there and then. His sweater is in complete disarray, and the SHIELD T-shirt he wears underneath has ridden up to expose the sculpted muscles of his lower abdomen, clenching and unclenching with need.
Tony readies his repulsor in his gauntlets, and charges them to full blast.
I’m just a man in a can, aren’t I?”
Tipping the corner of his laptop so the screen is further hidden from prying eyes, Tony labours on his keyboard. Too bad he doesn’t carry change in his pocket, the staff over there just reloaded their coffee grinder. What he wouldn’t give…
the concaveness of his sternum, bloody fingers grappling with half-hanging circuits and metal bits. He can’t imagine the look on these people’s faces – these
Tony starts in his seat and drops the screwdriver he’s holding, and what little colour left in his face disappears completely.
“Boy, you know me so well.”
It’s the least he can do, and he’s doing the best he could.
“Bet you’re loving every second of this,” Tony mutters under his breath, as Steve pats him about his shoulder.
“The ships are
Many moons ago, this is easy to answer. “Get to know New York again.” Like a child born anew, so many things to learn. And he learns quick. Nowadays, he’s as competent as a millennial just going through the simple life. Then, he learns about the Maslow’s Hierarchy, and he thought gee, there’s an actual solution to the mysteries of happiness? A cheer to the twenty-first century and its unending awesomeness! He thinks he fulfils the lowest rung of the pyramid – physiologic needs. He has more money in his bank account than he can use, food on his table, clothes on his back. He’s safe. Absence of war aside, there aren’t many threats formidable enough to take down a super-soldier on a normal Wednesday. Then, there’s the sociocultural dimension –
it that way,” the anger barely contained in his hisses. There’s just them in the car, what is he ashamed of?
Steve huffs, and looks down at Tony’s feet, blackened with dirt, but mysteriously woundless. “You don’t want that. Believe me.”
“You’re Howard’s boy, aren’t you?”
“I’m sorry.” A needless affirmation. “Does the Colonel have any next of kin we can contact?”
The gold of the fire reflected in Tony’s eyes highlights the hard lines in his face. He trembles, subtly, in a way that coincides with his clawing at the helmet he’s taken to hugging like a kid would his teddy bear.
Bucky used to be the only one who remembers it. The little trivia lives on in Howard’s son, who would’ve known.
The array of CCTVs lining the paying booth makes Steve nervous.
“We’ll figure it out. We always do!”
Tony Stark used to be enthusiastic about this job. He shows up at work two hours before everyone else does, and leaves his office near midnight. It’s not stipulated anywhere in his contract that he should work like a dog, but he does. It’s not even about the money. He’s getting loads of them, just to be clear, but he’s not driven by the zeroes trailing his pay check, or the size of his corner office on the twenty-fifth floor.
“Sir!”
about it?
Stay and die, or hide and die. “Seven minutes to go. I’m staying, Steve. I need to see this through with my own eyeballs. Are you in position?” Seven minutes to giving the world the dirt on HYDRA.
Tony’s fist clenches by his side as Pepper clasps her mouth in horror. The fact that Ross isn’t the least hesitant to make such serious reveal in the presence of a civilian only meant that he – and the government – has already come to a decision. Ross must’ve heard Pepper’s quickly stifled sharp intake of air, for his next address is for her. “In a week, the committee will release this information to the public. A unanimous decision has been reached last night. We do not mean to sow discord in trying times like this. But, the people must be
“I’ll uh, incinerate any invading pathogens?”
There is no rest for the wicked.
No fire, no smoke. No giveaway to their position, only the rich aroma of kimchi baiting a couple of inquisitive squirrels into the clearing. “The artificial crap they have in this cup will kill you,” Tony waggles a finger when said squirrel waves its bushy tail at him. “Eat healthy. Go nuts on nuts.”
looking.
He gives them all to Tony.
“I still have to pay in full for services
“Like that, Stark. Can you hear yourself?”
“Initiate system?” Considering the risks of responding to an ancient computerware, Tony deliberates for two glorious seconds and shrugs. He types, “Y, E, S, spells yes.” And the sounds of machines waking up from a deep slumber booms around them. They ought to be wary, but Tony can’t help grinning. This is his comfort zone, he’s in his element. “Shall we play a game?”
“We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Do not engage the Soldier upon sighting.” And Steve’s voice falters. “Leave him to us.”
. Dark hair, unkempt that runs to his shoulder. Strong and fast –
Tony’s gaze drifts upward to the ceiling, and he closes his eyes. “My suit can handle it. It’s not macho bravado, it’s statistics.”
“Not anymore.”
He’s lucky to have to deal with only one overweight, probably just done napping security personnel manning the booth. Tony almost pities him for having to launch another half-assed fireball his way as the man moves a shaking hand to his holsters. “Just do us a favour, Sir, and run!”
that… sound. That lurid sound. “To show the lady some good time.”
thing I’m hearing on the radio. Nobody’s talking about my alleged disappearance. And houses-on-cliffs don’t disappear overnight. Apparently, that’s not as interesting as some SHIELD Agent going rogue.”
The satin strip comes off in one fluid tug, and Tony deftly fastens it around Milos’ eyes. A makeshift blindfold, Steve observes from the rearview mirror.
That’s about the fiercest protest Tony manages, before he spreads his legs the widest he could in the passenger seat, and pumps his cock at full speed. Burt, Steve won’t look. He watches the road instead, wary of other cars speeding past them while the
There are two single beds hugging opposing walls. Each comes with a desk and a closet set flanking the bathroom. A bathroom that comes attached to this room? Small mercies, thank the Lord – and Tony pulls his shirt off and tosses it over his shoulder. He could’ve cared less if his stinky shirt lands across Steve’s face, he would murder kittens to have a good, hot shower.
He plugs Steve’s drive into the CPU.
“I’m just as different as you are. I can handle this.”
“Moan.”
Steve peels away from Tony, and wrenches open the car door with minimal effort even with Tony draping over it. “That’s not up to you. Get in. I still have a package to deliver.”
Not information per se. The Goblin’s target has always been Tony. The piezo, the bombs. He makes sure only a flyer will attempt to reach him. Steve was so close to signing off
“… OK. Send a memo to Pepper, will you? Reach out to all ex-Toomes Salvage Company employees, see if we can absorb them into SI manufacturing. We won’t be able to take in everyone. Consider enrolling the rest into courses for skills upgrading. Leave no one behind.”
He pushes past the wrought iron gate leading to the family cemetery and plods along the designated footpath. He never forgets where his parents were laid to rest, no matter how many years have dissolved between the last visit and this one.
“Fucking –”
Tony still lies asleep, oblivious to Clint’s blow by blow and Steve crumpling with unease.
“Feeling better?”
Tony closes his eyes – has them squeezed shut for good measure – and he loses himself completely. He takes in the teases, the hemming and hawing –
“Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car?”
“Turn around. Face up.”
has given him quite a scare last season. “No, I don’t think so.” Tony sits up a little straighter. “Don’t jinx it.”
… Fuck it all to hell.
Of course Tony keeps a condom on his person. And it’s not just the one foil packet either. Slipped between a couple of bills and credit cards Steve notes at least three more. Tony pulls one out at random and fits the rubber deftly over his cock. The stories of Tony’s promiscuity are not exaggerations, after all.
“I’m afraid I’ve been stalling, Captain.” Think, Steve bids himself to

“You don’t have to – you’re
The cold steel of the blade rests meekly against his cheek. “The sedatives are wearing out,” the man rasps, and Tony blinks away unmanly moisture in the well of his eyes. “Do you know where you are?”
It doesn’t.
or anyone else when I sneeze –”
His heart somersaults. He sticks the key into ignition, and tucks the tablet in his waistband. “This is good, right? Can you still hear me?”
“Cetta Therapeutics in headquartered there. We know.”
“This is some really specific healing powers. So, if I lob my leg off, will I grow a new one?”
And Tony’s own hard-on spills from his clothes.
Tony clasps a palm over his nose and mouth, forcing himself to hold everything in, every blink, every inhale and exhale. Shapeless shadows glides on the floorboard and they offer no useable information – spindly and elongated when the light shines from one way, and bloated when from another. Tony takes his chance – he turns his head slowly to the right, easy, that’s it – and the bottom of his stomach plunges.
Steve’s proximity is claustrophobic, and his heart thumps maddeningly in his ribs. He tries to tear himself away from the desk, and backs into Steve, who for reasons unknown remains steadfastly rooted to the ground – and inside Tony’s personal space. A warm gust of air blows past his nape. “I know what else you’re looking for.”
What was he thinking, designating the storeroom next to his bedroom as the generator chamber. Should’ve parked the damn thing in the garage, or the basement like any sane people would, sane people with some sense of self-preservation. What if it goes off? What if, like right now, he needs to access it quickly, but not without tracking across the foyer, the sitting room, a mini-library,

“Yep, piezo everywhere. We’re talking about a guy with no compunction for collaterals.”
all piezo to one of the exits, or have Iron Man fly the hostages out.
Five minutes to midnight, they both make their way to Fury’s ward. Shoulder to shoulder, they march forth with their heads held high. When Steve pulls the door open, multiple voices pipe “Stark?” and Tony abruptly falls half a step behind Steve.

“No one will know if you don’t tattle.” The helmet, too is as scuffed as its owner. “JARVIS, found anything?”
A message pops up in his HUD, front and centre and it says flap deployed. And then it’s the summer breeze in his face, a telling splash immediately after, before the cool, dark depth of the Potomoc claims him. Despite initial velocity, he hits the water softly. He’s still in one piece. Just him alone. Having absorbed all the damages, his suit – now a useless shell – is lifeless as it sinks to the bottom of the river.
It was with a heavy heart that Steve headed to the canteen alone. Yet as Tony now approaches his table and sits opposite him, Steve wants to rip his heart out of his chest and chuck it at Tony’s face. Maybe that would wipe off that ridiculous smirk he still has the gall to wear.
Tony’s first instinct is to scream, but the first sound that escapes his lips betrays him, and his back arches into Steve’s grip. Neither holds back, and Tony feels the urge to scream again. Twice, thrice, he quells it, surrendering to the goddam urge. Never in his life, alright? Never, to have his junk pleasured by another man, and to want it. He craves it – the friction, the heat. Give it all to him.
“What do you think happen, Tony?”
“Why the hell not?” There’s still one more to blow to kingdom come. “We have to get back there! Get ready the other suits!”
Tony’s trembling hand comes up to close over Steve’s. He shakes his head, and fearfully, he whispers, “There’s a
“Captain Rogers?” Someone just tapped on his shoulder, and Steve turns his heels, his cheeks and nose as red as Rudolph’s. “I’m glad that you’re on our side. The LGBT community thanks you and Mr Stark, for coming out, I mean, we’ve come a long way, Captain. Thank you.” The man – young, barely out of his twenties – shakes Steve’s hands and hops off into the snow.
“You know what I’m doing to you.”
“Morning, Cap.”
“Trackers. We have incoming.”

lost their goddam marbles, have they? Because launching a coup d'état out of nowhere amounts to exactly that. In spades.
“You sold your engines to SHIELD,” Steve presses.
It becomes immediately clear to Steve that the quarter’s soundproofing isn’t that terrific after all. As he walks the hallway alone towards the canteen, agents – young and old, male and female – cast surreptitious glances at him, all the while greeting him “Captain” with either a curt nod or a salute. They whisper, though his enhanced hearing can’t pick up the exact words. He made sure he’s properly showered, changed and shaved, so what gives? He stops by a large glass door and checks himself in the reflection, and boy oh boy, there’s a huge ass hickey over his jugular that his U-neck T-shirt cannot hide.
He blinks away the dark spots in his vision and winces at the gunk in his eyes. Disgusting, the afterlife is still so… biological. Absolutely unforgiveable.
“J, Unibeam.”
“OK, hey.” One of the quartet of Agents just positively catapults through the fire escape, holding up a sad paper cup of coffee. Most of said coffee seems to be soaking up the cuff of his sleeve anyway, and forming a steady pool on the tiled floor. “Oh shucks.”
“Jesus Christ, Tony – what the hell –”
Asshole.
“Where’s the keys?”
Whoever it is up there, they chose the wrong freaking day to mess with him.
“You were, still
, and they slip under the towel. Tony swears his heart stop beating when Steve pushes past the flesh, thumbs slightly digging into the crevice of his buttocks, before they slide over his thighs and calves. Then they come up again, and Tony tenses.
Steve hops on, and merge seamlessly into DC traffic. He’s starting to feel the full brunt of that
In one fluid swipe, Steve pulls the towel free from Tony’s waist, and tosses is over the cubicle’s door.
“Tony, there are cameras around.” He almost wants to grab Tony by his collar and hauls him back into the car. “We might accidentally appear on TV!”
And Steve mutters a silent prayer to the Gods above for this
“I don’t want to hear it! Blast it!”
He nods furiously.
“Right, now I’m seeing dots when I blink. Spare me, Steve.”
Steve chuckles some more. “I know. I stopped by a gas station to get more water. It’s straight out from the tap, so you want to boil it first.”
They have technically two short nights together before they head back to New York, and evening is already drawing close. Tony has like twenty ideas in his noggin about the next shield enhancements, all of which sounds tremendously exhausting to talk about. Steve looks like he’s rearing to go – when is he never, anyway? But having Steve’s corporeal form in front of him is like staring down a pendulum.
“Oh, God. Kill me.” His fault. He went full-on paranoid on security before he dispersed his suits around the world. With fair
Not the straightest thing in the world to do.
“Yeah, but you’re you. You always heal before they cart you here. I bet I have to patch myself up way more often than you do, and I’m only half as good as you are.” Tony shifts his weight a bit, and Steve stills his hands. “Or, you get your practice by doing this for others. Rumlow must be stoked.”
“Oh. Busted!”
Regrets. That’s the one thing he can’t let go, the one thing he can’t fix, even if God Himself bestow him with a second chance. It happened with Peggy, with Bucky. Twice was really enough.
“It’s not.” Putting words in his mouth, classy. Steve sighs wearily, and points at the unoccupied cubicle two door down from Clint’s. “I’m saying, you asked for a reward, and I’m giving it. With one condition. Get in there.”
The command prompt that races across the monitor before them freezes. It doesn’t blink anymore, and it’s now mysteriously
“You’re always thinking.”
“That won’t be necessary. I’ll… be there.”
“Yes, Sir.”
He gets. He also gets that they’re not in the best mental capacity to make such game-changing decisions, but they

of course – what would he do if some random schmuck chance upon one and activated a blueprint of a Chitauri-powered super-taser by mistake? “Don’t be a smartass, J. Check my biometrics!” And, he’s annoyed the Helicarriers enough that they’re mounting a counterattack. Something that looks lethal just missed his head by an inch and he swerves away, taking cover in the vortex trails left by the ship’s exhaust. “Would you scan this ship for weak points or
“How are you sure?”
This is doing the right thing. The right thing and the easy thing are never the same thing.
“Yes, Sir. Captain Rogers has mobilised all personnel available on the grounds to aid evacuation.”
Steve knuckles collide with Iron Man’s, and it cartwheels into the ceiling. “Great. Did you programme them to be this bloodthirsty? Because I can’t tell!”
The imagery from the TV sets floods his senses. All comes at once, and he cradles the tablet in his lap. “JARVIS, where’s Tony? He’s still out there somewhere, is he?”

That’s another problem with Tony, Steve muses – his erratic sleeping pattern post-Chitauri incident. He’s almost always sleep or
Tony flinches at the mention of the pen drive. “About that…”
“You think I care that you don’t call?”
“Steve?”
“I am who I am. Which incidentally is none of your fucking business.”
Six a.m. sharp, and Maria drops them off at a bus stop in a discreet black Rover. She winds down her window and nods at them sharply, her idea of best wishes Tony supposes, and promptly drives away. A shuttle bus is supposed to take staffers and guests to the Triskelion at a half an hour interval, and they wait for the first trip. They have grown out their facial hair so much if they would sit on the ground right now, people would toss them change. Their work clothes – dress shirts, slacks and sufficiently polished dress shoes are probably the only reason people haven’t.
“No, don’t. This tag I’m borrowing isn’t cleared for it.
This pretence… it’s about time they both quit the charade, isn’t it?

“All right, then. I should get going.”
with them, but never knew if that Sergeant from Louisiana was ever married with kids. Point is, not one day passes without a mention of Tony Stark in the bulletins somewhere – in print or online. Steve sleeps two floors below Tony. Eats food cooked in his kitchen, showered with water paid for by him.
“… Who is this?”
The water comes back on, and the horrible singing resumes. This time, Tony marches resolutely towards the indicated cubicle, and stands under the shower head. Nice to know that the prick is capable of listening to instructions after all. “Well, how was your mission? I’m sorry
“Wake up, Steve,” Tony murmurs as he pops his knuckles. He’s been calling out to Steve on and off for the past… three days? It’s been three days since they wheeled Steve out of ICU and stuck him in a standard class A ward. Single bed, six-paned windows on the eastern wall, enough space to fit a small team of medical staff, a comatose super-soldier and a bone-deep weary billionaire-genius-whatever. “Want to watch some TV, hmm?”
“The sky is the limit, Steve. This is as – as ridiculous as it gets – don’t deny it. Your face tells me it is. I need to be sure if BARF can access other stuff in our noggin. Think about it! A therapy is hardly useful if it also allows users to relive fake experiences. Imaginations. BARF is not an enabler. It’s supposed to be that much-needed slap across the right cheek.”
One pair of legs. One set of footsteps.
“Two incoming, my three o’clock,” Tony mumbles as he pointedly looks away. They’re occupying too much seat space, and he quickly lowers his duffel bag to the ground, between his ankles. “Don’t look like Agents to me.” A lady in her thirties accompanied by her male colleague amble towards them, entrenched in their conversation. As they come closer, Tong freezes up so bad that he doesn’t
Clint is first to break through the front windows where he lands on the tiles Tony previously warned as loaded. Nothing blows, and Clint is rapidly on the move.

The deed is done, and Clint is none the wiser. A close shave.
“OK, I’m gonna have to stop you right there. The cheesy one-liners are a major boner killer.”
Steve clears his throat again. “Good job out there, Stark.”
But it’s late evening. Steve should be off-duty. “JARVIS? Compile whatever you can find about this Mandarin guy, and save them on my private servers.”
“Status, Rollins.”
“Copy that. Any signs of the Goblin?”
“It was a serious lapse in judgment, all right?”
What was he thinking? That Tony would take his shit lying down?
“Shoeprints. Give me that.” Tony takes the flashlight and shines it where indeed, multiple sets of shoeprints run parallel to theirs. He shines along the ground, following the trail where it ends at the doorsteps leading up a single-storey building.
hard… just once. And once is not enough. Never enough. He rubs himself through his jeans, careful not to be too showy about it. Tony will notice, but he’s ravaging the escort in the back. He can’t see, can’t be bothered to care.
He swears he didn’t mean it – when Steve tries to stop him from walking away, Tony twists the entire arm around to throw Steve off his back. It would’ve worked – he has the element of surprise – but damn Steve and his super-soldier reflexes. Steve absorbs the momentum and turns it against Tony, slamming him once against the closet. It doesn’t hurt, and that’s
for the impromptu renovation.
Steve pulls Tony away from the truck, and draws the curtains. They’re frilly and sissy as heck, but he’s appreciating them now.
voice blares through them. “Attention, all SHIELD agents. This is Steve Rogers. You’ve heard a lot about me over the last few days, some of you were even ordered to hunt me down. But I think it’s time you know the truth.”
“I’m so sorry for what happened to you.” He’s careful with his embrace. It’s a cardboard world out there. “I should’ve been there. This shouldn’t have to happen.”
“Not funny. Is this pre-recorded?”
Captain Steve Rogers and Sergeant James Barnes, and your blood tests. We ran every panel that we can think of. We even sequenced your goddam genome. It shouldn’t come across as surprising to you, so I’ll be blunt. Not one of you are a hundred percent
The assassin cocks his head inquisitively, studiously examining every wrinkle, every bead of sweat on Tony’s face. Under the pressure of his enemy’s bloodthirsty watch, Tony perseveres. He looks past the long lash and hollowness in the grey irises – what his parents must’ve stared down in
