“I've been a bad dad, Dum-Dum,” Tony whispers, and DUM-E whirs in disagreement. His robotic 'fingers' close around Tony's wrist and squeeze, more gently than Tony thought DUM-E could, and he wonders idly if JARVIS has been teaching his kid tricks. Whatever the reason, it helps warm up the ice-cold pit of guilt in his stomach.
too far. “It's all very showy,” Steve continues. “Singing, dancing; big, orchestrated numbers and people spilling their darkest secrets. Aside from the melodramatic factor, which we both know Loki loves like nothing else-” and he glances over at Tony, who nods in agreement, “it's also mind-control, isn't it? I mean, we don't
Loki doesn't even move where he's curled up.
“Phil Coulson is alive.” Natasha stares at him for a few seconds, before she goes back to her magazine. Her flipping the page is like an exclamation point.
“Sir,” the AI pipes up now. “Captain Rogers requests your presence in his private chambers.”

“Just -” Steve looks pinched, his mouth a straight, thin line, before he lets out a breath and nods. It looks like it's physically difficult for him to do it, and Tony's confused, but hey, the Captain's an enigma. “Okay. I didn't want to say this with Thor or Bruce in the room, because I know it wouldn't go over very well – but I think Loki's our culprit.”
” He sighs. “
,” Natasha snaps and walks over to him, catching him by the jaw. He allows it, and her eyes blaze with fury, knowing that he's preventing her from helping him. “That's my
Tony grins back. “So, this went better than I thought.” He doesn't recognize the jinx for what it is until Steve huffs a relieved laugh and nods.

“You – you cornered me up here just so I'd
To lessen your chagrin
,” Tony says, his mind reeling. “Fucking Fury. We should have known the bastard would pull some shit like that to band us together, Jesus Christ.” He drags a hand through his hair. “Where are the rest of the guys?”
“Clint,” Phil murmurs, and Clint jerks awake.
” he admits to himself – and to Loki.
,” Jesus, what are these lyrics, seriously, “
“Aye,” Thor says, his voice rough.
The pause is only barely there, but it is, and that's too long. “Left New York, Sir.”
“I'd hurt a lot more than that if I could,” Clint says.
Loki's smile is indulgent. “Tell me, Agent. Have you and this
voice. “I'd just like to get you lot out of here before you start singing up the place.”

” Steve admits and lets his arms fall limply to his sides, “
, he'd said, and then he had died of cancer before Tony turned twelve and Tony had known that there were no angels watching over him, not anymore, and he'd have to build his own one day.
“Negative.”
“No, you-” Loki fights, but he's no match for the Hulk, who grabs the chain – and a hank of Loki's hair with it – and yanks it clean off. Loki yelps as the chain breaks with the force, sending the piece of jewelry falling to the floor by Thor's feet. This is the first time Clint sees it; a dark blue amulet, big and emitting a dull, aquamarine glow where it lies.
“I'm just saying,” Clint says and lifts his hands in the air, telling Tony he's backing off. It's probably mean to exhaust the fatigued dude more than necessary.
“I'm fine, Miss Romanoff, thank you for asking,” Fury says in a
“We should take this on ourselves, then,” Tony says. “I've already had two bouts of singing, and I really don't want a third one, so I say we find out who's doing this.”
Tony opens his mouth to speak, pauses, and his face shutters. “I begged Loki to take my heart.”
“Steve. He still sang at you. And you know none of us could lie while we were singing – I know I couldn't.”
“Sir,” JARVIS says, sounding his usual brand of fondly resigned.
Phil falls back asleep. Clint stays by the window. He doesn't grab Phil's hand.
Clint can feel the song –
“Unconfirmed statements placed him near New York two days ago,” her ex-handler rattles off immediately.
the licence to kill
Only now does the music start up, and JARVIS somehow manages to sound apologetic through his song. He's got a lovely singing voice, Tony realizes dimly; soft and cool, hitting every note perfectly just like an AI would, keeping perfect beat. Doesn't make this any less mortifying, of course.
Loki looks down at himself, but he's whole. Clint sees the target, though; a hole in Bruce's shoulder, spurting blood, and Bruce's eyes widen in understanding before he turns green and grows to three times his size in the span of a few seconds, his shredded clothes falling off him. The Hulk roars in rage, the bullet pushed out of his body and falling to the floor with a clear
Steve grins and pulls him in. “Yeah, he is. My handyman.” He kisses the side of Tony's neck, making him squeak and attempt to squirm away.
Clint doesn't say anything. He just straightens up in his full height, stares at his former handler, and lets the song take him over. It's almost a relief.
They were never going to leave Clint on his own, but Tony has to admit – to the relative privacy of his own head – that there is one big fault in the Avengers' plan. Namely, not knowing that
,” Clint finally says and waves a hand vaguely at the door. “Pissing or, smoking or, I dunno. Probably rallying up the troops.”
“I sang about my PTSD to Loki.”
” Loki looks down at that, as if bashful, as if honestly saying he needs Clint to polish his insane plans for universe domination. Yeah, no.
Clint grins wryly. “I got kidnapped in the middle of a lament.”
“There is something I would like to attempt, if I have your permission,” JARVIS says vaguely. He's not usually vague at all, which makes Tony a bit wary, but he trusts his guy past the end of the world.
“I feel...” JARVIS says and trails off, moving his arms and taking a step forward. He waves his fingers absently, no doubt fascinated by the new input, no matter that JARVIS was always Iron Man's co-pilot. “I feel,” JARVIS says decisively, and looks up. “Impeccable work as always, Sir.”
!” And it's awful, the falsely cheerful tone to his singing now, especially when it's followed by what can't be anything but a plea: “
Natasha's expression blanks out even further. Oh, wow. Bad sign. “You could say that.”
But oh, how I wish you could only see
“Hi, sweetie,” Clint drawls, because fuck if he's going to let Loki know that he'd rather be singing love songs with Stark and Thor than be here. “You miss me?”
” The rest of his suit falls to the floor and Tony steps out of his armored boots, just as the music changes into double its normal rhythm and he starts tap-dancing in earnest.
“Then sure, let him in.” Tony pushes down the flutter of nervous fear and shuffles his feet instead. He's managed to keep JARVIS's body a secret from the rest of the Avengers, even Phil, and if there's somebody Tony could bribe with naughty things to keep from tattling to Fury, it would be Steve, but...
and it makes Tony sick.
” Thor sings, morose, as he fiddles with Mjølnir's handle.
, this he's kept, and he needs – needs to keep keeping this to himself. There are no more secrets Clint has alone, not after Loki, but there is at least one big secret that his team and his best friend don't know. Clint needs it to remain that way.
In a matter of hours, every Avenger receives an email from Director Fury telling them to stay off the streets and not do any superhero work until the probably-possibly-spell has been broken. Apparently the entirety of New York seems to be under the influence of the curse, with people bursting out into song all over. At first, everyone thought it was some kind of elaborate TV stunt, but by now there are just too many perfectly synchronized ballads and musical numbers happening, and people are starting to freak out. Or they would be freaking out already, Tony muses, if they weren't forced to sing and be jolly around each other.
” He looks around, and Thor and Bruce are both frowning at him, Bruce especially looking sympathetic. Natasha doesn't even turn around, just steers the jet.
“Doctor Banner, His Majesty Thor and Captain Rogers have all left messages. They seemed quite upset.” JARVIS is too polite – or correctly programmed – to point out that the only reason Tony doesn't know any of this yet is because he's hiding in here like a scared kid, shutting out the rest of the world. And his team.
Fear threatens to sneak in under Clint's skin, and he shakes it off like he once tried to shake off Loki's hold on him. “You don't have the Tesseract anymore.”
“You've been shut-off as a Soviet Gulag since New York,” Natasha says, unapologetic. “You know I've tried asking nicely, but you avoid me. You avoid everyone.”
” Steve sings, wrapping his arms around himself now, looking naked and so terribly vulnerable in the middle of his living room. “
Loki's face sours and he places a hand on his chest, as if feeling his chest expand with his intake of breath. “You
Hulk swivels his head, squints at the wall, and then he's off, bursting right through it and outside. The wall threatens to crumble – and the ceiling with it – but most of the pillars remain intact, and only a massive amount of dust wafts down from the ceiling. It would suck to win the fight only to be crushed to death by rubble.
“I am waiting for your little friends to show up. I'm certain they have ways to track the amusing object in your pocket.”
“Well, you did screw us over for several months there, sir,” he says, a little more heat in his voice now. It's not like he hasn't forgotten – it's just that the anger had taken a momentary backseat to the fear of losing Phil (again).
“Me neither, sir.” This time, she can't quite hide every emotion from her voice. Can't quite keep it bland enough. She's angry that she hadn't realized Clint loved Phil so deeply, and hurt that he hadn't trusted her with the knowledge. Surprised she hadn't seen it coming, and grudgingly proud that Clint had managed to keep such a big secret from the two most important people in his life. She's still not sure where on the scale she will end up, but she knows that if Clint's been compromised, Coulson might be able to shake him out of it. Or she'll hit him hard on the head again.
JARVIS quiets at that. For a while, at least. “ 'Guy', Sir?”
“Barton's off grid. Assumed taken.” She lets her eyes roam the ceiling and walls of the coffee-colored hallway she stands in. Habit, nothing more. Check for bugs and cameras in the ceiling, even though she already knows JARVIS is everywhere.
“To my grave chagrin, this... shall we call it 'alternative method', requires energy I would have taken from the Tesseract, were it still available,” Loki says and his hand lifts suddenly, as if wanting to grab the thin, golden necklace that he's wearing underneath his shirt. “But no matter – I can find the energy elsewhere,” Loki murmurs, like he's telling Tony a secret.
“I'm off, big guy, before I have to sing an aria about your luscious hair,” Tony says and pats Thor's shoulder as he leaves the room.
there, feeling his heart hammer in his chest, the arc reactor picking up pace by a micro-fraction, fear so pungent in Tony's throat it feels like he's going to throw up.
The knowledge; you're Nick's right-hand guy,” And Phil's eyes flicker down, and Clint knows that if the agent could, he'd still not deny that he was part of this plan. Fuck.
, Clint says without being able to open his mouth. He settles for glaring daggers at the demi-god instead.
How proud he would have been,” and JARVIS's voice drops further at that. Tony sucks in a shaky breath and closes his eyes; feels moisture on his cheeks where his eyelashes rest, and DUM-E squeezes his wrist again.
Tony is forced to sing and dance an entire song, and nearly dies because of it.
” Loki even wiggles his fingers at that, grinning unrepentantly at Clint. “
” he explains, and Thor takes his hand.
It's only when he hears his own wracking sobs that he realizes he
Loki tilts his head. “To watch you die, of course,” he says lightly. “All but the one I choose to keep by my side.” And he puts a hand on Clint's shoulder, who looks like only his agent training keeps him from flinching away from the touch.
(Link to the song is coming - until then,
” Steve's close now, too close, close enough that Tony can see all the hurt and the confusion in Steve's eyes and really, it was just
“Where's Tony?” Clint asks, when the rest of the team is assembled in their common room. Thor and Bruce sit next to each other on one of the couches, and whatever Tony had mentioned earlier about something being wrong, Steve can't see it right now. Natasha's keeping closer to Clint than usual, and Clint seems... tired. Really tired. This singing business is taking its toll on all of them.
“That won't be necessary, Mister Laufeysson,” a new voice says from behind them, and Clint's every muscle tightens.
Coulson doesn't ask why Stark and not Captain Rogers, but Natasha can tell he wants to. “Need SHIELD back-up?”
Tony gets to his feet. Yeah, that doesn't sound too good. The rest of the team had gone to HQ, presumably to tell Fury about the plan, but Tony doesn't know if anything else happened there. “Okay – has he called anyone since he left HQ, J?”
“Is there anything wrong?”
“Clint,” Loki says, the first time he's said Clint's first name, apart from once in the song. “You are my first choice, but you are far from my only one. Or would you rather see your Captain under my thrall, by my side? Perhaps the Man of Iron, or the lovely Miss Romanoff?”
” and when Tony somehow manages to crack his lids open, Steve's smiling at him, so sad and so certain and so fucking beautiful.
Tony shifts, and shifts more, and doesn't answer. Not for a few minutes, anyway. “You know me, Clint,” he sighs. “You've read Natasha's report on me – Agent Comatose over there must have told you heaps of stuff about me long before we started living in the same tower. I'm not –” he gestures vaguely.
With a wave of his hand, Loki keeps beat as the instrumental piece concludes. Tony can only be glad that none of them are singing right now, even if he can still feel himself wilting, the music feeding on his energy. For the first time, Tony realizes it was a really bad idea for them to come here. It would just suck if Tony died while fucking
A moment of silence, when she can only hear Coulson's breath. “Agent. Talk to me.”
And suddenly Clint's right there, by the side of the bed, and they're shouting in each other's faces and Clint knows it's only the magic that's kept nurses and doctors from throwing him the fuck out of this room already. “
” Loki sings, his words soft but mocking laughter clear in his eyes; twisting words Clint so wishes to hear from a certain not-dead handler. “
Loki just smiles in a way that could almost be genuine if this weren't Loki. He still doesn't

“Nnn?”
” and fuck, really? JARVIS is an

would know he was lying. “How about the rest of you?”
it's true); “
“About me?”
Even I must sing and rhyme,” and he does a graceful little hop before spinning around once, easy as nothing.
“Clint,” Natasha says and grips him by the shoulders; pulls him in, tucks his head underneath her chin so he can feel her heartbeat, and he's maybe crying, he doesn't know, but he's also still singing.
Tony scowls.
“Oh, cool, sung blackmail,” Clint spits. “You sure know how to woo a gal.”
He gets out of bed quietly, though not so quietly that he doesn't wake Clint back up. “Mmmn,” the archer says and frowns sleepily at him.
“But, you know, by all means,” Clint says and does an inviting gesture with his wrist – it doesn't really work the same way when his arms are strapped down. “Go ahead. It'll be fun to see the guys pound on you again. I could use a good laugh right about now.” And if that last part is bitter, so fucking sue him.
” Bruce starts.
” before both of them fake-laugh and the rest of the team adds to the whole again.
“I have somewhat of a preposition for you, Agent Barton,” Loki says and pulls his hands out of his pockets to stare down at them; not in a bashful way, more like he's imagining curling them around Clint's neck and squeezing.
people, because they always let him down, always.
“You're welcome, buddy,” Tony says and closes his eyes against the exhaustion washing over him. “You're goddamn welcome.”
“Fury sang and everything. And I met Coulson.” Natasha flips another page; another silent exclamation point.
Loki laughs, delighted.
” all five of them sing; Tony's voice tinny through the comm but clear all the same. Steve feels inexplicably drained. “
Clint hates it.
Steve's got his phone in hand and Tony's limp body still cradled against him, calling for back-up; Natasha's got an arm around Phil, keeping him upright. Thor's the one who makes his way over to Clint to get him out of this fucking chair.
“There are many things I hide from you, Doctor Banner,” Fury says tersely. “I wouldn't be a very good director if I didn't.”
Tony spins around. “Um. You want company?”
, because it's not fair to either of them. DUM-E chirps sadly.
“Clint,” Phil says once his eyes stay open more than a second at a time and his gaze lands on the occupied chair in the corner. Then Phil frowns. “I mean... Barton.”
, goddammit! He's not supposed to be under this spell!
, goddammit. “Suck a dick, Loki.”
”, the orchestra rising to a swift crescendo and then crashing down.
He snorts. “Really, J? You're going there? If you're gonna try to make someone feel better about himself, you should focus your circuits on Cap. I don't deserve any sympathy, you know that.” DUM-E beeps angrily at that, and Tony resumes his stroking.
He roams the streets instead, not caring where his feet lead him, a decision he regrets when he looks up from his own darkened thoughts to see Stark Tower right in front of him. “Goddammit,” he mutters to himself and doesn't go inside. Not yet. Instead he stays on the nearest street corner, where he can still see the Tower but anyone looking out the windows can't see him. He slouches against the window of a closed café, watching the blinking blue-white lights on the espresso machine inside and generally feeling sorry for himself.
Hulk blinks, still scowling, and pokes Phil in the ribs. Even Phil can't quite keep the low cry of pain to himself when Hulk hits him right where Clint knows the bandage is. “AGENT STILL SHOOT BANNER.”
” Steve asks, still not looking at Tony, who's not moving from the couch any time soon.
” they all sing to a Clint that probably can't hear them, “
“Wow. I mean, you always seemed so human, but now...” Steve gestures vaguely at the metal body. “Wow.”

Tony grins. “Hacking into SHIELD is always a good start, which is why I told JARVIS earlier to go through every scrap of information he could find and report back to me.” He sips his coffee, letting the rich, dark flavor spread on his tongue and wash away the lack of sleep and the exhaustion. “Makes him happy to have something to fiddle with,” Tony adds.
.” Steve's eyes are far-away and yet still trained on Tony's, his cheeks coloring, and there comes the guitar strumming and Tony just
“I'm still here,” Phil murmurs, and swallows his apologies. Instead he presses his lips to Clint's sweaty temple and breathes in the smell of fear and sleep and fig shampoo. Clint's nightmares are still an every-night occurrence, and Phil is still dead in them more often than not. It will take longer to convince Clint's subconscious, as well as his conscious, that Phil isn't going anywhere.
” Steve sings softly, “

to have known Steve Rogers, to have served beside him, proud in a way he'd never been of Tony. If his brain and libido had any sense of self-preservation they'd hate the guy, especially with that 40's stick up his ass, but instead they'd done an 180 and figured that obviously, Tony should fall head over heels with the kid.
.” And he winks and leaves them to it, hearing Thor chuckle, even if it's still subdued.
Clint has to look at him for a moment before he connects the lines; remembers how calling his best friend Natasha – not even 'Nat' or 'Tasha' – is a privelige. One that she seems to have revoked for the time being.
” Phil sings and rubs his chest absently, before concentrating on the road again.
With my heart...” Tony spits a blob of blood onto the floor.  “
“No, Sir.”
“Break the spell. Break into the song.”
” Clint grits out, as Phil interrupts him with “
“Agent Romanoff?” says Phil Coulson, clear as day through Stark's phone, and he sounds surprised but also worried. Good. He should be. “I didn't expect you to contact me again for some time.”

“So I was,” Phil Coulson says from somewhere behind Clint, and he can't see him from where he sits, no matter how much he cranes his head. “I guess it didn't take.”
Clint doesn't let himself frown, but neither does he reply. Apart from being forced to out their own painful secrets, there hasn't been any mention of after effects or side effects or... or anything, really. Not that he's noticed, at least. Sure, he feels a little tired, but...
Phil is just happy that Clint is willing to trust him with this. With him.
“I – you can send him a text, doc,” Steve says and doesn't meet the man's eyes. “I don't think he's real keen on being in the same room as me right now.”
, in a way he can't do when he's in control of his own body. His vision blurs, tilts before stabilizing itself, and Tony's sweating and shaking and he knows, he
“We don't know for sure that it's magic,” Steve says.
Loki's using his life energy to fuel the magic he'll use to turn Clint back into a mind-controlled assassin. It's a lovely thought.
And then the world dims. Go figure.
Tony nods and surveys the giant elephant in the room.
before Steve opens his mouth.
” Tony rasps to Loki, though he keeps his gaze on Clint's to see the man draw his head back a fraction; the closest he can get to shaking his head right now. “
,” Tony bites out and hugs DUM-E closer. He can't stop thinking about Steve's resigned look as he sang; can't stop thinking about all the countless times Tony's poked fun at him like he does with everyone, really (
I'll stand by your side to our very end,” the AI sings, and sounds almost wistful. “
, the inventor part of his brain swears), but his throat is still full of that lump.
And Clint is suddenly singing along, the words springing from his lips unbidden, although at least the words are his own: “
” Clint sings, cheeks flaming red, because
. It feels like he's pulled a two-nighter in the lab again, forgetting to eat until JARVIS points it out and realizing he's about to faint from lack of sustenance.
“You're still as cocksure as always, I see,” Steve says, but smiles and lets him in.
” Steve sings softly and places his hand on Tony's shoulder; lets the other brush through his hair. “
There is a moment of total silence. Then Natasha curses in Russian and Clint bursts out with “I knew there was something off with those back-up singers!” Steve says nothing, but he blushes, and Thor claims that he noticed nothing out of the ordinary, as he tends to spontaneously burst into song anyway.
“Something happened?” Steve asks.
“After remaining in that most recent position for approximately four point five minutes, Agent Barton left – judging by his speed, I can assume by car.”
“Lover's spat – didn't get the details. We done here? Because I'm a busy man, you know,” Tony says and crosses the living room, heading for the door. An entire conversation with Cap and no singing; that's almost too good to be true, and Tony really doesn't want to push it.
The guy that that you adore
“You requested I track the Avengers' whereabouts through their phones,” the AI says.
“Then why am I there, Romanoff?” Coulson bites out.
Thor looks down at the amulet. “This is a magical artifact of great value and power,” he says and stares hard at it instead of his brother, who's getting the shit kicked out of him for the second time in a year. Then Thor drops Mjølnir on it and it cracks, Clint suddenly feeling several kilos lighter. Natasha straightens from her near-slouch and Steve sighs with relief. Tony stays unconscious.
The chords turn contemplative, quiet, and Tony stills, swaying and trying not to fall flat on his face. He quirks a smile at his team mates; at Thor, who looks pained by what his brother's doing to Tony; at Bruce, who looks endlessly sympathetic, his eyes a bright green; at Natasha, stiff as a statue and eyes drilling into his as if she's trying to give him energy through her gaze alone; at Steve, who just looks desperate.
Loki is unfazed; seems amused, if anything, by Clint's snarled notes. “
“NO ONE TELL HULK WHAT TO DO,” Hulk roars and thunders forward, picking up Loki like he's a rag doll and shaking him. “PUNY GOD NEVER LEARN.”
“We don't know.” She doesn't need to say anything else. Coulson fills out the rest.
Tony laughs; it's a broken sound. “You're not wrong, J.” DUM-E makes a distressed noise. “Ssh, Daddy's alright. He's just a callous asshole, that's all.”
He doesn't stay at HQ. Doesn't go back to the Tower either. Natasha's going to be there, and Clint won't put it past her to try and corner him for another shanty, which fuck that. Fuck it. Just – fuck.
Phil's eyes flutter shut. “Thank you, Clint.” His hand curls into a loose fist, before opening again. He turns it over, palm up. Clint stares at it like it might hold the answers of the universe.
Steve just nods.
” Steve's voice trembles, “
Tony doesn't answer that, and Clint doesn't follow it up.
“Me? I'm adorable.” Tony flings himself onto the large couch in Cap's living room – the one he put there because Steve kept being vague and 'I don't know, anything's good, really' at him – without spilling a drop of his remaining coffee. This really is an awesome couch; deep and comfy. Because Tony's an awesome friend. (If not a deep and comfy one.) “So, what did you want to talk about? Or sing about?” Tony stretches and puts the cup down on the table nearby, arching an eyebrow at the superhero and hiding his jitters below the usual layer of bravado and bullshit. “Please tell me you didn't want to sing?”
” he sings, smiling even though he feels like screaming in rage, wants to claw at his mouth until it stops spouting all these ridiculous thoughts in front of everyone and his enemy and
“Believe me, Sir, I am quite used to the display,” JARVIS says, and Tony still doesn't know the entire emotional range in the AI's voice, but 'demure' is there for sure.
,” Phil starts, but nope, fucking nope, Phil's not stealing Clint's ranting song so he starts singing against him.
Tony freezes for a moment at that, before he remembers to hug back. “You okay there, J?”
“Yeah, no. I can see that. Being Loki's number one fan isn't something I'd want on my CV.” Tony looks away, towards the small window across from him. It's gray and cloudy outside, and not much of a view, but it gives Clint the space to take a deep breath and ground himself.

“Um, yeah, no,” Tony says. “Are you suggesting we track him down and just barge in, not knowing if he's got another Tesseract stashed in a pocket somewhere? That's a terrible plan, Cap. I'm ashamed on your behalf.”
” and Steve shifts closer, his body pressing up against Tony's; unyielding and warm and Tony's fear ratchets higher, because Steve's eyes aren't just sad now, they're frightened too.

“What's the status, JARVIS?” he says once he's out of the apartment and in his private elevator.
“I must admit,” Loki muses, “that as... valuable as Agent Barton has proven himself to me in the past, it would be interesting to have a more augmented creature as my second in command. Or perhaps a well-tamed, green beast.” His eyes glitter as they travel between Steve and Bruce, completely ignoring the three others. “However, I have found myself growing fond of your little archer,” Loki says, and this time, Clint does actually twitch.
They stare each other down. Or rather, Clint stares Phil down and Phil just takes it, without question or fight. And that takes all the pleasure out of it, really – there's little point of being angry at someone who's already brimming over with guilt. It's like kicking a wounded kitten. “It's Clint, sir. Phil.”
“Dunno,” Tony says. “Too tired to find out.”
“Do we know where Loki's at, these days?” Clint asks, looking as tensed as a coiled spring.
“I'm going down to Tony for a minute,” Phil murmurs. “Go back to sleep, nothing is wrong. I'll be back shortly.”
” Steve sings, “
Steve huffs a laugh. “What happened to 'I have a plan – attack'?”
, it's... it's almost worse than being yourself. It's like the filters are gone, so you feel everything purely.”
“I don't know,” Steve says. “I guess we'll find out when we find him.”
“Of course not, Sir. You make an excellent point.” JARVIS sounds indulgent, maybe even amused, and Tony grins. After a minute of silence: “... thank you, Sir.”
“No, I – I second that,” Bruce says and raises a hand. “Maybe we should-”
” and they all exchange glances; half earnest ones, in sync with the dramatic music surrounding them, and half exasperated by the text.
“A body, actually,” Tony says and fiddles with a loose piece of wire between his fingers. “I mean, he's still the house, but I thought he'd want to get out a bit. Take up knitting. Learn to jog. I dunno.”
, Tony could – “
“Tony?” It's soft enough that he could feign sleep. Steve is clearly giving him an out here.
” And he pulls back; turns around so Tony can't help but focus on the rigid, painfully set look of his shoulders, the way his back moves as he sucks in sharp breaths of air.
“You don't have that kind of firepower.”
That you're not as alone as you claim to be,” JARVIS tries to soothe him. “
“My, my,” Loki says pleasantly, in a way that's so far from pleasant it makes blue crackle at the edges of Clint's vision. “You talk more than Stark. I'm impressed.”
Bruce gives his partner a sad smile and reaches out a hand, tangling their fingers. “We both said some... less than stellar things. We'll just have to work through them.” He lifts the cup with his free hand and sips delicately at his tea. “Preferably not through singing.”
Steve lets out a long breath, and smiles. He has dimples when he smiles; of course he fucking has. Tony knew, he'd just somehow forgotten, so now he gets to be dazzled by them all over again.
Attaching strings –
thinks bitterly that at least Clint didn't get all the love songs.
“Yes, much better. I almost thought-” and then he stops mid-sentence, getting this strange and constipated look, before he closes the door. Tony can't hear any instruments yet, but somehow he just
And then he hears the soft sound of an acoustic guitar, and sighs.
He's not even surprised when the melancholy piano music starts up, though he feels more tired immediately – like the music's tapping into his energy and feeding off it. At least he's alone this time.
“Are you sure about that, sir?” Bruce asks, in a carefully guarded voice, and Steve's glad he's not the only suspicious one in their group. “It's not because you have something to hide from us, is it?”
They walk out into the hallway, and Steve opens the door to let him out, giving Tony a small, tired smile.
” Clint forces the words out, feeling his heart break all over again and fuck, fuck everything, this is exactly why he doesn't
alive with the sound of music if Tony Stark can help it.
” Bruce sings, meticulously cleaning his glasses with his Science Frown firmly in place, and the rest of them join in creepily perfect synchronization:
material,” Tony says. “I'm Tony Stark, I'm a walking train wreck of issues and future harassment lawsuits. And Steve's...”
And that's when the music starts, of course.
” Clint sings angrily, “
, Clint. It's been months. You're not getting better; you're getting worse. Whatever coping mechanisms you're using right now, they aren't doing the trick. And I'm sick of you pushing me away. I'm supposed to have your back.” There's sadness in her eyes too, beside the fury, and Clint swallows.
And then Steve's there again, straddling Tony, and Tony can't do anything but just
Tony's a little afraid to ask now, but he's way too curious
“Well,” Loki says, the music dying away as suddenly as it started. “Then I shall find someone else, Agent.” And his mouth curls into the familiar 'I'm about to kill everyone' smile Clint remembers and hates so much. “
, and with this curse on the loose, that doesn't bode well for Clint.
She just shakes her head, and the rest of them know better than to pry. “Steve?” Clint asks instead.
“It's – it's none of your goddamn business, Nat,” Clint says hoarsely, and listens for any sudden background instrumentals to start pling-plonging. “It's just something I have to deal with.”
“I have,” Loki says, and at least his voice is the same: slippery, eerie, with that same holier-than-thou mocking undertone to it that always makes Clint want to punch the guy in the face.
” Steve sings cheerfully, his body doing its own thing and ignoring the part of Steve's brain that must be reeling. Tony would find it hilarious, except this is all really mind-controlly, and Tony doesn't wish that shit on anyone, least of all poster-boy.
Then Tony says: “Okay, who needs to get drunk?” and there's a collective groan of agreement from all around him.
Phil sighs. It's like watching a inflatable person deflate into a crumple. It's
” He turns away from Loki, from Clint; turns until he's facing his team, with Steve closest. Steve, who looks like he's in more pain than Tony right now. “
and Clint gave the guy everything he knew, everything he had, everything he was.
“Trouble in paradise?” Tony asks as he enters, because at least people are used to him being an asshole. It will give them some... normalcy, or something, with this whole fucked-up situation.
” He smiles bitterly to himself.
Tony sits up. “Go on.” He's been thinking the same thing, actually; this whole thing stinks of the Asgardian. Loki's still on Earth somewhere, stripped of his powers, undergoing 'rehabilitation' (Fury even used the bunny-ear movements when he said it). But Thor always gets that wounded look whenever any of them hint that Loki might not be as rehabilitated as Thor thinks, and Bruce is morally obligated to take Thor's side these days, so yeah. Probably best to keep this a two-man discussion for now. Maybe they can tell Clint and Natasha later.
The rest of the team give each other bitter, tired smiles and sing in unison: “
“But Barton does not.”
“Boyfriend material?” Clint tries, though he doesn't quite manage to keep the laughter out of his voice.
Wait, what?
“Tony? It's past four again, are you coming to b-” Steve has a Stark tablet in his hands and frowns at it as he walks into the workshop, but the moment he looks up, his steps falter and the words stop coming. He doesn't drop the tablet, but it looks like a near thing. “Wha... is that a new suit?”
“I knew he wouldn't be harmed,” Phil says, breathless now, and presses his hand gingerly against his chest. His color's faded even more, to a light gray. “He told your team that bullets couldn't harm him. I knew you would protect him when you took over.”
” and Phil tries harder, though his voice is growing weaker with the energy he's spending: “
“Right,” Bruce says, looking a little uncomfortable, like he always does when he's reminded that JARVIS has the intelligence to become SkyNet or GLADOS – except he never will, because Tony made him way too awesome for that.
“Off we go, then,” Clint says and hops down from the couch rest he's been perching on. Natasha just nods and follows the archer.
“What do you know about Loki's whereabouts?” she asks. Her palms tingle.
He can see that Phil wants to say something, but they're both under the musical spell now, and Clint's the only one who opens his mouth.
Loki's grin widens. “No? Oh, well. Do not let it wear you down.” Something about that particular sentence triggers all kinds of red flags in Clint's mind, but he remains passive.
Fuck Loki and fuck energy-stealing bullshit sing-song pendants.
“Correct... mostly,” Loki says musingly. “But you forget; I am still a god.”
“Please tell me you're immune, JARVIS,” he says as he steps into his inner chamber, last night's song about Steve still echoing in the back of his head. “If you start singing about safety protocols, I just might shoot myself.”
“Fury's going to be apoplectic when he sees JARVIS, you do realize that?” Steve asks, but there's no chastising in his voice. Just amusement and a warm, certain kind of fondness that Tony has only started getting used to. It seems to be Steve's 'Tony-voice', a voice that only comes out when Steve talks to – and sometimes about – his new boyfriend.
, the mood of the song changing from sad to angry too quickly for Tony to fully realize until Steve pushes at him – not hard enough to hurt, but hard enough that Tony stumbles back onto the couch, knocking over the coffee cup as he does, hearing it tumble to the floor and spill its remains onto the cream-colored carpet.
” He cards a hand through his hair, frowning. “
“It's just – it's his M.O., isn't it?” Steve asks, though it sounds rhetorical so Tony keeps his mouth shut not to make him upset again. He doesn't like it when Steve's upset. Flustered? Hell yeah, that's hilarious. But not that pinched I-miss-the-forties look he sometimes gets when Tony might take his
“And here I thought you were going to serenade me about my shapely ass,” Tony says with a mock pout. “Or how hot
” he finishes, quirking a smile.
Tony giggles his way into sleep, but he's pretty sure he manages to nod before he's under.

.” Steve quirks a terrible, sad, resigned smile. “
So, what do you say?
Thor seems to take heart at this; he clutches Mjølnir and grins at Bruce, who offers him a small smile in return.
Stumbling a little, Tony gasps for breath as the music winds down a little, for the bridge. He feels like he could sleep for a week already, and that's... that's not a great sign.
“Are you?” Steve asks, and he sounds way too honestly curious for Tony's liking.
“Stay in the background,” she says, nearly snaps. Clint would kill her (no, he wouldn't) if she let Coulson put himself in danger on her watch. “You're not there to fight, sir.”
Loki.
Which is, of course, when he feels someone sneak up behind him. Clint, still under the song's spell, can't turn around; not until there's a hand holding a piece of cloth over his mouth and nostrils, filling his head with a sickly sweet smell Clint recognizes all too well.
” and then his voice crumbles altogether, and he only manages to croak out the last part: “
It's the shortest song Steve has heard so far. It's also the most revealing one.
“So, I've got this question,” Tony says when he walks into the Avengers' living room this morning, “and feel free to ignore me if, y'know, I'm talking crazy here, but have any of you spontaneously burst into song lately?”
“Indeed, Captain.”
“Of course,” Steve says and puts a hand on Clint's shoulder. “You should get some sleep, too, while you're at it – I've had a couple of hours of shut-eye, and you look about ready to pass out.”
“I am sure your intention was never to harm Captain Rogers' feelings, Sir,” JARVIS tries. Which is cute, really, but completely unnecessary at this point.
looks perfect. “How's it feel, buddy?”
” Thor thunders, sending every standing Avenger stumbling back a couple of steps. “
Loki smirks. “
have, is powerful connections. And thus, access to certain... potent artifacts.”
” He quirks a painful smile. “
Bruce's brows draw tighter together, but he lets it go, just nods and flips out his StarkPhone A7 – limited Avenger edition – courtesy of their resident genius.
“Yes, everything is fine.” Phil leans down to kiss Clint softly, and the man rewards him with a content huff before curling back up in the space Phil vacated.
“Thank you,” Loki says when the number's over, looking over each and every one of them as they gasp for breath. Even Natasha staggers a little, her jaw tight as she tries not to show any weakness.  It almost makes Tony feel guilty to see her unsteady on her feet; like he's peeking through a peep hole into a secret room.
THE END
” they sing cheerfully, though Tony notices that Bruce and Steve seem horrified over what they're actually singing. “
” Loki says with a put-upon sympathetic expression, and dance-steps close enough to fit his hand above Clint's heart, the cold seeping through the fabric of his t-shirt. “
*Steve sings to Tony about being in love with him. In the dance, he's forced to straddle Tony and talk - vaguely - about sex, and both of them are very uncomfortable and Not Okay With This. Nothing more explicit happens.

“Yes,” Phil says. “You saved us. Thank you.”
Clint feels like a gag has been removed from his mouth, and finds that he can speak freely. “Hulk!” he shouts, watching how Loki scrabbles to put his hand back on his chest. “The gold chain around Loki's neck! Get it off!”
“A hero,” Clint says, glancing at Phil. He wants to punch himself in the mouth.
Fuck, more magic cubes? Clint wants to thunk his head against a wall, but hey, still strapped to a fucking chair. “That's great, L'Oreal.”
“Correct, Sir. I am not, however, human.”

~*~*~*~*~
“Coulson's alive?” Natasha asks, and her voice is shaking; with relief or anger, Steve doesn't know. “He's been alive all these months?”
“I would not mind witnessing it,” Thor says as they make their way out of their apartment and up to the roof, where the Quinjet's waiting. “If we are to assume that the Hulk is as adept at singing as you are, it may well be a pleasant experience.”
Tony glances at his watch – almost nine. “Go on.”
” And he smirks humorlessly, hands spread, like he's found the solution already. Some of the team nod along.
” He leans his forehead against the cool glass. “
Steve is just about ready to let this go and leave – Fury's right, after all; there are many SHIELD secrets they shouldn't and needn't know – but the tell-tale blare of invisible trumpets and saxophones jolts him out of his thoughts, and he sees Fury's face contort.

“I'm not longingly staring!” Tony snaps, but without heat.
Tony seems to be all about the jazz, himself – and tap dancing in the goddamn Iron Man suit, what the fuck? Tony's never tap danced in his life, but he's rocking it now, moving his feet fast enough that if he weren't a genius, he wouldn't be able to count the steps that he's doing. As it is, they make a strange kind of... sense, even if he doesn't know how he's doing it.
Thank you so much for reading! Comments are love, both for me and for my artist! <3
” Tony points out instead, and Clint adds “
Tony's heard a lot of rumors about Natasha – about the Black Widow – and since she moved into his Tower and he's become less twitchy around her, Tony's realized that those rumors are at least 90% true. He's never, until now, known whether she's actually been a prima ballerina or if she just loves Tchaikovsky. Now he does. Well, maybe not the prima ballerina part, but Natasha moves far too gracefully and confidently to be an amateur. Tony's reminded of a ballet Pepper dragged him to a couple of years ago, pre-Afghanistan. Tony was pretty drunk at the time, but he thinks it was Swan Lake, because he remembers two swans and the prince (with the giant package – what? Tony has priorities). Natasha is definitely the Black Swan.
” Steve sings, and the music's calmed down entirely now, cut off from Tony's death dance, Steve taking over when Tony can't anymore.
“I'm aware, Barton. And I am sorry. I was under strict orders – and in a coma – for most of that time.”
Clint doesn't say anything, though Tony can see the tick of his jaw and the tightening of his shoulders. He doesn't meet anyone's gaze – least of all Natasha's, whose eyes are blazing.
” Clint offers. “
” He grins, but it's a smile devoid of humor; like the rest of them, Tony's thinking about what other things they could be spilling to each other in a fit of sudden musicality. “
As soon as the music dies down – as soon as Tony has his body under his own control again – he's up and running. Fucking
The rest of the world falls away, the demi-god's focus on him a prickling, uncomfortable sensation.
” he finishes meekly and sinks back into the couch, next to Natasha. She pats his knee in reassurance, and Thor's face brightens a little again.
Annoyance flickers across Loki's delicate features. “Enlighten me as to what 'this' is, Agent Barton.”
Tony actually flushes at that, and looks down at his blanket-clad legs. “I knew,” he says, voice flat. “Told you, remember? I made the poor bastard sing about sex at me.” He takes a deep breath. “So believe me – I knew.” He starts fiddling with a loose string on his blanket.
“I do not mind,” JARVIS says, shifting a little, still getting a feel for his new form.
Clint's strapped to a metal chair on a podium on the other end of the room, the warehouse looking like one of those places that turn into random rave parties every other Tuesday; flecks of liquid and oil on the floor, corrugated iron walls, and lone light bulbs hanging from the ceiling by their cords. Clint's face is pinched, and he looks haggard. He seems equal parts worried about his team, annoyed, and impressed by their dancing.
“Nay,” Thor says and fastens his battle armor. “I share the same sense of foreboding, Bruce.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Natasha is. He wonders how Phil Coulson survived
“Apparently the rest of the guys have been knocking on my doghouse door. Anything go down at HQ?” Tony dumps down on a chair on the opposite side of the table.

Maybe it was just to see Steve duck his head and purse his lips; see how his cheeks flamed up and his springy steps lost their sharp rhythm, if only for a beat.
“There's a junk-yard outside this warehouse, Big Guy,” Natasha says, walking up to Phil but keeping a wary distance between herself and the rage monster. “I'm sure you could smash that up.” She nods at one side wall.
“Well, I – I made Cap sing about sex,” Tony says, a small – almost stubborn – hitch in his voice.
They keep singing those two separate sentences together, Phil's words turning more and more pleading and Clint's only growing harder, until he's panting and quiet and the music's calming down, and Phil whispers “
“I'm sorry,” she whispers and keeps him close, and since when are they curled up on the floor instead of standing? “I'm so sorry I made you sing, I didn't – I didn't know.”
“I'm uncertain, Sir, but it might be worth investigating. Agent Barton seems to have paced the streets of Manhattan for the majority of the evening, before stopping near Sir's Tower at approximately 8:42.”
“Certainly, Sir.”
“Yup. Anything funny coming up?” Tony sits upright, DUM-E rolling back a few steps and looking at him. Tony rubs his eyes.
“Still me,” Clint bites out and meets Steve's gaze. And Tony sees it; the dark, murky blue-grey of Clint's eyes instead of the eerie blue of the Tesseract.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You might find it pertinent to see for yourself, Agent,” JARVIS says and sounds disturbingly amused.
The team has scattered. Steve, of course, ran off as soon as their horrible little ensemble number ended, and Natasha and Clint did the same as soon as they got their hands on some of Tony's booze. Bruce disappeared down to his workshop not too long ago, and by now, Thor is the only one left in the living room – and the only one who isn't freaking the hell out at the possibility of having to proclaim his innermost feelings to his team. Then again, Tony muses on, that makes sense. Everyone knows about the demi-god and their house scientist-slash-rage-monster shacking up together – as surprising as it was at first –, and in general, Thor's not the guy to keep a lid on his feelings. He probably doesn't have much to hide.
“It's alive,” he says breathlessly, and stumbles back two steps for extra dramatic effect. “It's
“No?” Loki looks thoroughly amused. “At least let me explain before you so callously shoot me down, Hawk-man. You wouldn't want to hurt my feelings, now would you?”
“I assume you are referring to the earlier... conversation with Captain Rogers,” JARVIS says. He sounds sympathetic, which doesn't surprise Tony. He's known for a long time that his AI displays some form of emotions, even if he doesn't process them like a human would.
“You made him a suit?” Steve asks Tony, still clutching his forgotten tablet.
“Just thought we'd
the anger emanating from the archer still standing next to him, tenser than the string of the bow he clutches in one hand.
“Let us hear your song, cretin,” Loki snipes at Hulk, who's looking around, but not actually smashing up the place or Phil yet. Clint doesn't know if that's a good thing – better control – or if it just means that the Hulk's as under Loki's control as everyone else here. “Sing for us.”
“Then why
He grunts and closes his eyes.
? Hulk must've hit you harder over the head than Thor thought.”
” Steve sings, right into his ear, and lust or want has nothing to do with it, Tony knows; this is Steve
Clint's answering smile is brittle. “Wasn't something I was real keen on sharing with the class.”
He didn't want skin, didn't want to look as human as possible, so instead he's got a golden, metallic shine that makes him look like an infinitely cooler version of 3CPO. He also has rounded eyes, which makes him look a lot less mean than Iron Man, and they emit a cool, blue light. Like Tony's arc reactor.
There's absolutely no need for her to answer that. “I'll send you the coordinates. We leave in ten minutes. Make sure you're not followed or seen.”
“Captain,” Clint says and sounds resigned and pissed off all at once. “When's it
It doesn't matter. He felt the trigger, hears the starting chord, and his mouth opens. “Love?” he says, hoarsely, and looks over at Steve. Steve looks pale, the muscles in his arms bunching as he tries to move. Words bubble up Tony's throat without his consent.
“But yeah,” Tony continues when Steve just looks down at his hands again. “It does smell like crazy and Loki to me. Which begs the question, how the hell is he pulling it off? He's supposed to be powerless.”
” Bruce says again, but Tony interrupts him this time.
Tony leaves DUM-E down in the workshop and makes his way to the Avengers' common room, steeling himself for the fact that he's going to have to look Cap in the face. Luckily for, well, everyone, probably, Steve isn't the one sitting in the kitchen, reading a biking magazine. It's Natasha.
“Yikes,” Tony says because really, what else is he supposed to say to that? And he really didn't know the two of them were at the L-word phase already, because it's been, what, four months since they started getting together? Tony needs to work on his people-reading skills.
“Don't tell me you're just an AI, JARVIS. You taught yourself better than that.”
” he tries, and the music starts up again, to the Asgardian's apparent relief.
Tony swallows against the lump in his throat and pushes down the part of him that screams
As worried as he is about the guy – Phil's still weak and if he's also under Loki's spell, he can't afford to sing much – Clint is still so goddamned relieved to hear his voice. Rage and betrayal aside, he's missed that voice so fucking much these last months.
“Well,” Bruce says when the team is alone in the room – the senior agents having scuttled out after their boss – and sighs. “That's at least one good secret to have been revealed.”
to hear it.” He steps back, amusement coloring his movements, and Tony can feel – see – the team around him again.
“Mm.”
“Got it in one, Pidgeotto,” Tony says and lets his hands fall to his lap. He closes his eyes.
Tony suspected it had something to do with Howard and all the endless tales of Steve Rogers; how Howard had looked when he'd talked about his past friend. Eyes all bright and shiny, hands gesticulating, smile toothy and genuine; he looked
“Son of a,” the Director says, and then five senior agents run over to him to provide back-up, standing on each side of Fury to offer twitchy jazz hands and wide, panicked smiles.

The super-soldier blinks and glances over at him.
“But what I
Here we fucking go.
“Oh well,” Loki sighs and shrugs a little. “Not quite the classic tragedy I had hoped for, but we have time. Would you like to proceed, Captain?” he asks and Clint screams in rage inside his head. Watching his team mates dance themselves to death, one by one? He can't. He can't see that. Can't let that happen.
“That I did know, sir.”
“This whole deal reeks of him, sir,” Clint mutters from Steve's left.
“Care to assist, Mister Stark?” Loki purrs. “Share your unique view of the world? I'm sure we would all
Bruce huffs a laugh and buttons up his shirt, an old, ugly one in case the Other Guy decides to make an appearance. “ 'Foreboding.' Yes, that word fits nicely.”

“Barton sang to me,” Natasha says.

The AI is silent for a moment. “You make a fair point, Sir.”

Fury sighs and folds his arms behind his back. “We have an inkling. I'll have someone send you the information you need. Now, if you'll excuse me-”
,” Loki sings, still working that same old shtick, “
Steve doesn't answer that, just sits down in one of the three couches in the Avengers' living room.
Tony turns his head slowly, assessing the room around him. He blinks when he sees Phil, groaning and squirming a little. “Agent? And... Steve?”
. Clint feels bad all over again.
that this is going to go so badly for both of them. “
Rustling, and then a pained grunt. Clint turns his head back to stare at Tony.
“Dismissed, agents,” Fury says and doesn't lift his hand to his jaw to feel his split lip. “I'll have an agent send you information on Agent Coulson – or at least hand Tony's AI a file he can hack.” With a last, lingering, icy stare, the Director leaves the room.
When Tony sneaks up in the living room the next morning, he hopes it will be vacant, but of course he's not that lucky. Instead of doubling back down, though, Tony halts when he sees that Bruce and Thor are both up, each sitting by their own end of the kitchen table, not saying a word. They look... forlorn.
Steve gives him a lopsided smile. “I think I know what you mean.” He clasps his hands together, elbows on his knees and earnest eyes on Tony.
“We won't.”
“Director,” Steve says when the team enters, loud enough that most of the people in the hall turns to stare at them. “We need a word with you, sir.”
Tony has mostly kept his eyes closed while this has all been going down, so Steve sits down in the chair their archer vacated before he notices that Tony's awake. “Tony, hey. How are you feeling?”
Life is so unfair.
“Exactly,” Phil says. “You tell them that.”
“Coulson,” Natasha whispers – the first thing she's been allowed to say since this damned song began. Clint doesn't need to acknowledge it: of course it was. Phil's his soft spot; him and Natasha. Loki tried to break Natasha, and when that didn't work, he killed Phil.
“Right,” Clint says and spins an apple on the tip of his finger. “Can I be the first one to call magic curse?”
was a question they'd need to know the answer to beforehand.
Clint watches him, oddly pensive now that the focus isn't on him (and Phil) anymore. “So what's with you longingly staring then?”
Steve looks up at that abruptly, with a startled look that he almost immediately schools. Tony frowns.
Tony pulls DUM-E close and pets him, trying not to think about the fact that the only creatures who love him are his robots. DUM-E beeps with pleasure and curls up against Tony's chest the best he can, which truthfully isn't very good, but sentiment's everything and Tony murmurs quiet praise to the kid.
“Yeah. Awesome song. Really...
“Nat,” he says, because he knows she's got some kind of
Uh oh.
“Oh.” Steve looks down at his hands. “I don't know. I just – I tried for the entire song, and nothing happened. And then I was just – singing.”
“Not a word. I don't think they actually know what they're doing,” Bruce says, and it doesn't sound like a judgment.
And then they all promptly hunch forward, gasping with the effort to breathe, their limbs shaking with the sudden energy loss. Iron Man seems to do just fine, but Steve can hear Tony's heavy breathing over the comm.
“It wouldn't have helped.” Clint isn't aware that he'd spoken until the sentence is finished. Tony doesn't say anything, just turns his head to look at him. “You don't stop –
Tony twirls slowly, not missing Natasha's blank-hard look that he's learning to understand means that she's frantically trying to find a way out of a fucked up situation. Doesn't matter; the music's changing up again, and Tony's gasp-singing and dancing and he just, he can't get enough breath, his chest tight and his limbs so heavy with exertion.
Tony sighs and leans his head back against the concrete wall; closes his eyes. “Yeah. It's good to know that the only guy who doesn't hate my guts, I created by myself.”
, because he can't – he just can't, not any of this, not
Become my partner in crime?” He grins, a shard of insanity shining through again. Clint doesn't think there is a single part of this song that will be an 'honest' proposal; mostly, it seems like Loki's just doing this because he likes singing. (And maybe because Clint finds it really fucking unnerving.)
“Bruce, I apologize,” Phil says and Clint frowns. He looks at the scientist, who's staring at Phil, but looks as confused as Clint feels. Loki raises his hand – presumably to force Phil into his own little dancing monkey routine – when a gunshot rings through the warehouse, making Steve and Thor flinch.
. “Are you aware of Loki's current whereabouts?”
It's weird as hell and Tony secretly loves it.
“You're bullshitting me.”
“Tony!” Steve barks, shutting Tony up, because hey, whoa. What's with the hostility? Steve sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose. “Can you just – be serious for one moment? I'm trying to actually discuss something here.”
Clint hangs his head; smirks humorlessly as he can feel – though not hear or see – his team getting closer. “
“No, that's...” Phil turns his head so he can see Clint better. “I only – Romanoff.”
The AI nods once at that. Then he walks over to Tony, and slowly – awkwardly – envelops him in a gentle hug.
Natasha arches an eyebrow at him.
“Oh, my bad.
” the demi-god sings, grinning. “
Loki chuckles, and Clint opens his eyes to glare at the power-hungry demi-god. “
“Out and about. Bruce and Nat's getting some rest. Thor's with Fury, getting our friendly neighborhood psycho-god stuffed up somewhere.”
” And a few additional jazzy piano chords conclude the song – for good this time, Clint hopes.
“Oh, come on. Don't even try that, Barton. The way you stormed off after Fury's aria to go lament by yourself? Kind of hard not to notice.”
The music changes up again; Tony dances, feels like a marionette puppet, moving fluently, sharply,
“Steve is destroying the rest of his punching bags; Thor and Bruce are having angry, loud sex in their room.” Natasha's eyes harden as she stares at a sleek, black Triumph Truxton. “I don't know where Clint is. He left Ph- Coulson's room before the rest of us got there.” It's the slip-up, more than anything else, that really lets Tony know how fucking
” Tony sings, shrugging, wishing he could walk over to the podium to lean against it and let it keep him up, because he doesn't think he'll be able to stand for much longer. Steve flinches and Tony's so grateful he can't see Clint's expression right now. Clint must hate him for wanting what Clint fears most in this world.
“But you're
“No,” she says, letting the bite in her tone show. “You've lost the right to expect that,
Loki doesn't say anything, just does a single, slow shake of his head. His smile widens.
“I would have to agree with you, Steven,” he says and hangs his head low. “My brother would find this highly amusing; it is a fine 'prank', as you call it – one that is not so deadly as some of his earlier attempts on Earth, but no less harmful.” His gaze flickers to Bruce, who just puts a hand on the Asgardian's neck and buries it in the long, untamed locks of blond hair that falls down Thor's back.
“I'm up! I'm good.” Tony looks around, remembers where he is, and why he's curled up alone on the floor of his workshop, still holding DUM-E like a metal teddy bear. “Fuck, alright. Yeah, hit me, J. What's up?”
Wedding bells and rings,
There is a message on his automated clock.
“Yeah, we are,” Steve says, and he sounds as relieved as Tony is at the prospect of getting Tony the hell out of here. Which, Tony would be hurt (or pretend to be, at least), but he doesn't really want Cap singing at him either, so the feeling's mutual. “We should probably call Fury at some point, though,” Steve adds. “When we've talked to the whole team.”
“I dunno, Stark. Between you and me, I think you've got competition.”
” Steve sings, softly. “
” JARVIS finishes and falls quiet as the last chords die down. DUM-E bleeps a couple more times before he seems to realize that the song is over. Then he whirs in question at Tony.
Hulk stares for a while longer, before grunting and sitting back on his ass. The room reverberates with it. “HULK SMASH GOD,” Hulk announces, and seems a little put out that the fight's over already.
Now, he's tumbling through the vent and landing on his feet on the linoleum floor, less graceful than usual because of the anger coursing through his whole body. He straightens and lets his eyes skim the room, making sure he's alone – well, alone with the dead man lying in the hospital bed only a few feet away, that is.
“I'm fine, Dum-Dum,” Tony lies and lets himself slide down onto the floor, reaching forward to rub DUM-E's head, like he would do a pet. Except DUM-E's not a pet, he's – he's Tony's baby, closest he's got to one, and DUM-E whirs closer now, chirp-beeping in contentment at his daddy's attention.
Take your joy away
JARVIS looks down at his new body. It's sleek, slimmer and less menacing than the Iron Man suits – mostly because this thing doesn't need to house a human. JARVIS is still the house, still omnipresent like the God Tony never believed in, but now he's here too. Within reach.
“Sir?”
” he sings, smirking in a way that everyone in this room knows is all bullshit and hidden bitterness, and Tony is going to
“Fair enough,” Coulson replies and sounds tired. “Please let me know what's going on.”
“Why the hurry, Director?” Natasha asks, her voice silky smooth. “You seem... agitated.”
“Steve, hey,” Clint says and gets to his feet. He glances over at Tony, then smiles sweetly at the Captain. “Good timing – I need to grab a bite. Mind if you look over these sleeping beauties for a while?”
“Cafeteria coffee, Rogers. See you in a few.” And then he's out of the room, leaving Tony alone with Steve and a hopefully-sleeping Agent Agent.
(No soundtrack for this, I'm afraid, hehe.)
“Have you forgotten that Cap
“... Would you like to get a coffee sometime?”
.” He can hear Natasha suck in a sharp breath. Good. Means she didn't know – at least until now.
Steve nods. “
“I love it when you talk dirty to me, J,” Tony says and blows a kiss at the ceiling, even if his stomach jolts unpleasantly. Truth be told, he'd rather just stay clear of the Captain's path for a while, until he's not in any danger of bursting out with any sappy rom-com announcements. But considering how Cap had exited the room yesterday like his well-formed ass was on fire, Tony knows he's not keen on hanging around with his team right now. Which means that whatever he wants to discuss with Tony must be important.
“I'm well aware, Barton.” He smiles. “It is why I have brought you here, after all.”
” Clint and ignores the jab even though it's true (or maybe
serving as an exclamation point.
, if only in the form of a glare, an eye-roll, or an exasperated sigh. After a while, Tony even introduced the guy to dirty jokes, because this century was full of them and someone should make the guy aware of the dangers out there. Or something.
“Um, the twenty-first century,” Steve says with an apologetic smile. “About everything I don't know. It was... it was a pretty long song. Fourteen verses. I'm glad I was alone. I fell asleep right after.” He frowns. “Or at least, I think I did. There were voices making ooo-ing noises in the ether.” He yawns, like he's still sleepy.
actually crying, crying full-on, even, like he hasn't managed to do after Phil's death at all. He can't. Couldn't. Apparently he can now, with Nat here.
“Not interested,” Clint says.
He doesn't answer. Can't. Just stays where he is, where they are, just the two of them now. Just the two of them left.
Clint murmurs something unintelligible and presses his face into the crook of Phil's neck.
On a usual day, he'd spend some hours shooting down on the range, or sparring with Natasha and Cap in the training room. But meeting people means the possibility of singing to people, and it was horrifying enough to sing out loud to
The silence almost has time to settle again, before Tony speaks. “See, I didn't know that.” The humor in his voice is weak, but it's there, and so is an awkward smile.
goddamn pitiful.
Steve lets Tony's unconscious body slide to the ground, going down with him, making sure Tony's breathing. He glares at Loki but doesn't say anything; the curse has got him again, Clint realizes. The Captain's shivering with the energy spent to break into Tony's song.
“Yes, good plan. Better plan,” Tony says and pats Steve on the shoulder once, too brief for any warmth to bleed through to his chilled hand. He absolutely does not focus on that brief contact, because Tony Stark is many things, but pathetic isn't one of them. “I knew you weren't all body and no brain, Capsicle,” he snarks instead. Steve doesn't answer.
“Right,” Tony sighs and pulls up some of his screens. “Let's crack this bullshit curse.”
” He flexes his arms again; a futile attempt to get out of this goddamned chair.
“I make a fucking excellent point, JARVIS, don't pretend otherwise.” Tony smiles against DUM-E's cool metal body, grateful that his snark is creeping back in.
“Clint?” Phil asks, eyes wide with shock, and sits up sharply. He winces at the movement, a sharp punch of breath coming from him, and Clint knows he should go over there and help, make him lie back and tell him that it's okay, that Clint's glad he's back – so
“W's errone,” Tony groans in a barely-there voice, and Clint walks over to see the billionaire blink open bloodshot eyes and squint sulkily at him. Even Clint doesn't know how to squint sulkily.
Loki just smiles.
Nobody seems sure what to do with the demi-god's sudden bout of rage - not even the music. Thor blinks and lets Mjølnir slide out of his grasp and thunk to the floor, looking around like he's just woken up from a deep sleep. His cheeks tint.
“I second this,” Thor rumbles, though his eyes brighten a little at the physical contact. And to be honest, Tony
“Not at all, Agent.” JARVIS sounds... rueful? That always makes Phil slightly nervous.
Tony smirks. “I know that. If you were, you'd probably hate me too.” DUM-E whirs sadly and nudges his chest with his robot arm. “Thanks for the vote of confidence, Dum-Dum.”
” Tony murmurs – a confession, yeah, but maybe a gift too. Letting Steve know it's cool. He's better off finding someone else to give that big, beautiful heart of his to, because Tony's fucked up and hey, he's dying right now anyway. Everything works out.
Phil is driving, hands on two and ten, feeling the slight twinge of his chest every time he turns the steering wheel too much to the right, when he feels the Urge again. He sighs and feels grateful that he's alone – though out of some sixth sense he doesn't fully understand, he knows that he is not the only one singing this song. Even if he can only hear his own voice.
Clint blinks, thinks of denying everything, but that's as good as admitting it. And he's not ready to do that yet, not with Phil here, not with Phil still so out of reach. Instead he plasters on a smirk. “Says you.”
“No,” Clint says and stumbles back a few more steps. “No, fuck everything and fuck you. I've sung everything I need to say.” And then he's back up in the vent, crawling away, ignoring Phil's pleas.
“Clint,” she echoes, and closes the door before leaning back against it, arms folded. She cocks an eyebrow at him, but doesn't say anything.
“Barton,” Fury begins, but Clint doesn't give him the opportunity to back-pedal. He walks over to the director, clocks him in the jaw, and then stomps out of the room. It was a telegraph; Clint's shoulder dropped before he landed the punch, giving Fury plenty of time to block it. It fills Steve with a sense of satisfaction that the man didn't – that he understands that a punch in the face is the
“Yes, and I'm sorry about that,” Phil says and smiles at the creature. “But Loki had him under the curse's control, and we really needed your help, Mister Hulk.”
” sings Natasha, eyes bright and possibly the closest to surprised the rest of them have seen her, “
Clint stares him down for a minute or two before he grows bored, and sighs. “So this is great, but why the waiting game?” He'll never admit that it's making him antsy, but from the smirk that the Asgardian gives him, Clint doesn't need to.
The silence seems infinite and it makes Tony's skin itch. And he's just too fucking tired to stand that itch, so he ends up speaking first. “How did you do it?”
Loki's smile turns wry. “
Loki laughs, and then the bastard starts
you?” Thor asks, clutching Mjølnir in his hand like a security blanket.
Wish I could tell your father
“Please spare me the naïve sermon on the bonds of family, brother dear,” Loki sneers, his smile still big and sharp as any of Clint's knives. “I did not bring your team here tonight to listen to your incessant, sentimental dribble.”
“I don't care,” Tony says and leans back a little more, further into the safety of Steve's arms. “J's family.” He stretches out a hand, and JARVIS tangles their fingers and squeezes.
All this time, Tony's reveled in pushing Steve's buttons for the fun of it; for his own, petty enjoyment of seeing Steve's cheeks flare up or hear him stutter – and he's never even realized that it's killing Steve. Tony's
“Ah, the beast,” Loki says, smirking, and waves his hand. As the demi-god turns to the Hulk and Hulk pounds his fists into the concrete below, Clint hears – then sees – Phil dance into his vision, the quiet background music a distinct salsa. Phil dances like he does everything else; with great attention to detail and great concentration. It would be hilarious, except Clint can see the color draining out of Phil's face as he moves, sweat beading on the handler's upper lip and forehead.
,” and Clint's officially beginning to feel nauseated now. He keeps singing, and Natasha keeps oo-ing, the two of them moving in perfect synchronism even though he sees how wide her eyes are.
“I wish I could still get drunk,” Steve says, skulking to his room and hiding there. Tony doesn't blame the guy. He might just keel over with embarrassment if this happens again.
“No, no. Of course not,” Steve says and sounds completely unsurprised, if not disappointed. He stares at Coulson's sleeping form for a while, instead of Tony.
” and his voice grows stronger now, angrier, bits of blue crowding his vision; “
anything, though, just stands a few feet from Clint's chair, hands in the pockets of his jeans like he's trying to seem more human than he is.
“Steve's outside doing...
Every muscle tightens in Clint's body and he does
But you stand tall
“Aww. I'm touched.” Truth be told, he's more than a little worried. But nobody needs to know that.
...” Phil looks around the hidden hospital room, a room that somehow even JARVIS hadn't found. “
“You can keep on spouting bullshit all day long,” Tony says, surprised when the words fly out of his mouth – even though God knows he means them. “But the Tesseract's gone. You've got nothing, Dancing Queen.”
Okay. Fair enough. Tony spits blood and sucks in a scratchy breath, hears the music change, turn frantic, egg him on, and Tony lets his eyes fall shut and dances.
“Good evening, Captain Rogers,” JARVIS says and inclines his head by a fraction. It's startling how much he reminds Tony of old Edwin.
” Steve holds him a little closer, a little tighter, a little more. “
“Apologize? For wh-”
“Sir, Captain Rogers is asking for permission to enter the workshop,” JARVIS says after a while and pulls back. He tilts his head towards the door.
” And Fury holds the 'e' vowel while the five others repeat “
” Clint sighs and isn't sure if it's part of the routine, or a small part of himself coming through. This feels too goddamn much like the Tesseract all over again – mind control, making him do things he doesn't want to do and say things he
,” he snarls.
” Natasha mutters. Clint huffs a laugh next to her.
… With no heart.” He swallows, tastes blood and feels a small trickle run down the corner of his mouth. It feels like the Hulk's squeezing his chest, his breath rasping, and he's vaguely surprised that you can sing yourself into a lung collapse by the help of magic, but apparently you can.
Natasha starts to 'ooo' again, her hand on his cheek, supporting him the only way the song lets her.
” And that's when he turns back around and Tony sees the scarlet hue of his cheeks, the red spreading down to his neck and chest, what little of it is visible above the collar of the shirt Steve's wearing. And okay, fine, so Tony's wondered – like everyone else in the Tower, no doubt – whether Steve's still a virgin or not, but if there was one goddamn way he did
“I am quite content, Sir, thank you,” JARVIS says quietly and keeps hugging him. Tony remembers – as he often does – the song his AI sang to him three months ago, and the wistful wishes expressed in it. Tony's so fucking glad that he spent so much time on JARVIS's new nerve endings, so he can feel properly what a hug is like.
“Here, you's... you's gone, you,” Clint slurs and jolts upright, looking around. It only takes him a second to remember the where, the how, the what, the who, and he sighs and slumps back down. “Still here,” he whispers and curls up against Phil's side. “You're still here.”
Natasha waits for an acknowledgement, one she gets after a few seconds.
The stuff of fairy tales,” and the song calms down again but it's not helping this time, because Tony's just too fucking
Clint grunts in agreement before he falls back asleep. Their sheets are cool, like their room, the window open against the autumn night. They're tangled and clad in sleep wear, because although Phil has gotten to see and know more of Clint than he ever thought he would – could – there are still some places they have yet to go. There's no hurry. This helps enough with his own nightmares.
The music dies away and Tony can suddenly breathe again; he's still coughing blood, still can't stand or even keep his eyes open any longer, but he gulps down a breath and thinks that maybe both of his lungs aren't goners after all. “Steve,” he whispers, and then he's down for the count.
“Hell yeah,” Tony brushes him off and stands up. “Okay, so we talk to our friendly neighborhood assassins  first, right? And then break it to Thor and Banner.” He sighs. “Man, Thor's gonna have the worst morning.”
The kids are gonna overload when they see him.
,” Tony says out of pure instinct, before he actually has time to properly hear the question. “My – I'm not going to talk about my issues with you, Cap.”
“Um,” Tony says. “Narcissism.”
Lead your mind astray,” and another mock-soothing gesture, this time an ice-cold finger skimming over his temple. Clint doesn't let his body shiver.
“Rogers,” Fury says, and something flickers across his face. If this were another man, Steve would be tempted to call it fear. “I thought I gave your team specific orders to stay in the Tower until otherwise instructed.”
Tony actually blinks at that. “I thought you were all for the singing, big guy. Arias and epic ballads, isn't that your thing?”
“Oh, come on, J. Have some appreciation for the classics!” Tony bounces on the balls of his feet and goes back to nitpicking the finer joints, making sure everything is as it should be. It looks perfect.
“My phone?” Clint blinks. “...Seriously? Wow, you really are dumb enough to try this again, aren't you?”
The rest of them...
” And they crowd around Tony's private bar like a choir as the song reaches its last notes: “
” and he doesn't know if he's talking about Loki or Phil anymore, but in a fucked-up way, he thinks it's about both of them. “
“Not talking about my issues,” Tony warns him. His head is starting to feel woolen now, and he knows he's about to pass out again. Fucking energy-stealing demi-gods.
– but he can't. Not now.
” Bruce starts, but Natasha interrupts him, muttering to herself.
“Of course,” Coulson says. “Thank you, Natasha.”
. He bites his lower lip hard enough to taste copper on his tongue.
“So that's your play?” Clint asks, his voice hoarse, and blinks in surprise that his words actually come through. “Take over my mind all over again?”
Tony coughs out a bark of laughter, and immediately winces from the effort to his damaged lung. “Avoiding me, then.”
,” Steve begins to sing before he even realizes, staring at the bright glare of Tony's propulsors in front of the Quinjet. “
So Clint sneaks up into his private space – except it's not private anymore, because there's a familiar red-head waiting for him as soon as he enters the room, stepping in front of the door he just walked through so he can't escape.
Hulk blinks at that – like no one's ever called him 'mister' before. Clint doesn't suppose anyone has. The bushy, big eyebrows frown in what looks like suspicious surprise. “NEEDED HULK.”
“Yeah, J?”
Tony still doesn't say anything. His brow furrows.
“Um, okay,” Clint says, deliberately putting weight on his 'um'. “You went up against all the Avengers at once, you and an entire motherfucking alien army – and a couple of Leviathan creatures I swear you ripped off from Michael Bay – and you got your ass so
Tony recognizes it. It's Steve's 'in for a penny, in for a pound' face. Shit.
Loki spins around. “Wh- you were
“Anything you want, buddy.”
” He doesn't so much dance as sway right now, his fingers deftly finding the emergency release triggers on his suit, shedding part after protective part, baring his heart as well as his undersuit-clad body.
There's a knock on the door, before Steve pokes his blonde head in. His hair's in that disarray that means he hasn't been sleeping in a bed for a good, long while, but it also kind of makes him look like an underwear model.
“Of course, Sir.”
” Clint sings, his voice trembling.
Tony Stark did not pine. He was well-versed in wanting things he couldn't have. He shut up about it; he buried it; he 'dealt' with it.
“I – Sir?” JARVIS says, and he sounds... strained? What the fuck?
Tony frowns. “Left? Left the Tower?”
“Not for much longer, Agent Barton,” Loki murmurs. “Unless you prefer I take one of your team mates, of course?” His eyes glint.
For a moment or two, everyone stands and listens to the silence, the lack of invisible instruments in the air, and stares at the flushed faces of their team mates.
Tony is so getting JARVIS to fuck with the heat settings on Barton's shower when he gets back home.
.” And she slumps back in the couch as the rest of them curse silently to themselves.
“I... sincerely apologise, Sir,” JARVIS says and sounds... embarrassed?
You never could
“About time,” Natasha murmurs, before stepping back, and Clint starts to sing against his will.
“It's Agent Romanoff.” She hangs up and goes to find Captain Rogers.
“I love him,” Coulson says, so quiet she almost can't hear it. Natasha smiles bitterly.
” And he walks out of the room, the rest of them trailing after as the back-up singers they currently are.
One beat, then a sigh. “Okay. Give me the location.”
Tie you all in knots
Tony doesn't say anything.
“I'm so sorry, Clint,” Natasha murmurs, and this time, Clint nods, before the bridge comes.
” Steve continues, and walks towards Tony, one step per lazy beat. The guitar strums in the background, and for each step the Captain takes, Tony stumbles backwards because no, nope,
Natasha takes the elevator to Rogers' level, but stops in the hallway leading up to the front door of his apartment. She flips out her phone.
, Clint thinks, and promptly hates himself for thinking that. For thinking anything but
Hulk finally kicks the demi-god halfway across the room, where he ends up in a miserable little heap. The former doctor Banner now turns to Phil, who's holding himself up by leaning against the podium, white as a sheet. “AGENT HURT BANNER.”
“No. No. Absolutely not.” Steve's smile turns self-deprecating, which Tony doesn't get because he'd heard Steve's singing voice yesterday and it was nothing but nice. “Although it is about the singing in general.”
