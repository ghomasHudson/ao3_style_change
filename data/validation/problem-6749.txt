Steve talks as Tony does what he can to dry himself and puts on the clean clothing. Nothing of consequence, just inane chatter about missions that Tony doesn’t need to know, but it does the job of filling the still heavy air that hangs over the night like a pall, and drowning out the drip of water from outside. Tony can’t forget, not for a second, why he has called Steve here, and Steve has always remained vigilant about Tony’s drinking. But Steve does try to put him at ease when it counts, which Tony can only be grateful for.
California on fire?  Just saying,” Bruce held up his hands in a placating gesture, in the face of Tony’s glare.  “You haven’t seen him since May.  Maybe it would do you both some good.”
And maybe he notices how Steve’s fingers flex toward him, unbeknownst to himself, and Tony knows that it’s a physical reaction, because Steve is touch-starved and always horny, and it’s not as though he wants to caress
Steve stared at him.  “Not interested . . . ?” he muttered bewilderedly, then a look of troubled understanding crossed his face.  “You think our sex life slowing down means our relationship is in trouble?”
Steve laughed, his melancholy from the ride to the plant miles away. His eyes lit up when he saw the painting displayed in pride of place. “Is that Iron Man?”
“Makes life so much sweeter,” Steve finished for him.  “The gods are eternal.  They never change.  We’re . . . so much more fragile.  Humanity is beautiful, but it’s . . . temporary.  Fleeting.  This moment will pass, and it will never happen again.  The plants will die.  My skin will wither and your hair will grey.  The conditions are impossible to replicate, so the sweetness of the moment is that much greater.  You agree?”
Stern smiled, like he had his ace in the hole.  “Tony Stark is unstable, volatile.  He thinks that because he can create something, it is his sole weapon to control.  He refuses to corporate.”
“Megamede of Lesbos,” Natasha supplied.  “One of the most famous hetaera in the world.  She was able to buy her freedom during the war.  She seduces men of power, then forces them to reveal their secrets.  She works in Athens for the most part.  Though she does travel.  She was the one who informed Steve of my existence and convinced him to buy me.”  She cleared her throat.  “She and Steve were . . . rather close, during the war.  You know all the letters he gets from Athens?  Most of them are from her.   I know you snoop.”
Nat blinked innocently, which always meant she was most definitely up to something.  “What on Earth?  Heavens, no.  But look at that, you and Tony are going to be
“Who are Sam and Bruce?”  Tony did a mental tally of the rooms, and if he was to assume everyone had their own, he was one short.
He fumbled for a lamp and some sealing wax before she steadily lit the flame.  After a few moments he was able to press the carnelian stone delicately carved with a helm that was his signet ring into the soft wax.
“You’re stronger than your impulses. I know you. If you’re not going to believe in yourself, then I guess I’ll have to do it for you.”
“Yeah.”  Steve wiped a hand across his face, blinking rapidly, obviously trying to wake himself.  “I was –“ he yawned wide, ridges on the roof of his mouth visible.  “Sorry.  I was looking more into the space program, and got Lovell’s book, and well, it’s a pretty good movie.”
They were quite for a while, before Tony said “I’m sorry.  I should have known you’d been here before.”
Steve took one look at the rumpled genius, nasal cannula and stitches and glassy eyes.  “Okay.  Fine.”
“If I run a bath and dump you in, will you fuss?” Tony gives him a light chuckle, but honestly, it’s not that funny. “Fine. I’ll go dig up some towels and dry clothes. Will you cooperate with that?”
“Steve next!” Clint crowed from the back of the couch, and Tony gleefully scrambled for a package in the always-familiar red, white, and blue.
The attaché case popped open with a simple touch, as it had been coded to only open for Tony. Folded sheets of golden metal lay innocently in the red velvet interior. Tony unbuttoned his shirt with one hand, letting the chest plate glint in the low light of the office.
Steve had opened the door, but Tony didn’t want to look at him.  He instead spoke into the depths of the pillow.
hoards.  They aren't just made up of eighty bazillion coins.  No, dragons hoard whatever they see as valuable.  Most of the hoards he has seen (because while dragons are protective of them, they are also proud) are composed of books and art.  Though there are plenty of shiny things.
Tony watched closely as Natasha ran her blade gently over the sides of one particular pod that had several dried incisions along with the newest one.  Obviously, Natasha made sure to get every last bit of latex she could.
Steve is still standing there, staring, oblivious to the henchmen squealing like mice everywhere.  "Tony?"  He sounds terrified.  Steve isn't usually terrified of huge beasts.  Why is he scared of Tony?
It took me forever to find time to watch the movie to lift the dialogue, then I did like half the movie, then found a website with like everything already written.  *bangs head on table*
“Okay, I’m taking you to Cape Canaveral.  And Houston.  I’ll get you a little orange flight suit and everything.”
So Tony had put his foot down, called his travel agent, said he needed a decent place for two couples and two single grown men near Magdalena, New Mexico.
“You’ll meet someone,” she whispered in his ear.  “Someone who will see underneath all your bluster and bluff, and love
“But you're not the only people out there, are you?  And, you're not the only threat.  The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled.”
“You break anything, it’s on your tab,” Tony said, not blinking as he watched while Steve did some warm-up stretches before he started swimming.
“Somethin’s eatin’ you, man,” Rhodey huffs from where he’s lying on his back, doing his leg lift exercises.  Tony is sitting near his head, acting as his spotter.  There’s a physiotherapy specialist that comes to the compound every morning for two hours, the best Tony could find in the country, but Rhodey is insistent that he keeps working at it even after Carmen leaves.  So Tony helps Rhodey totter around the gym area that has only just been fixed after Clint and Vision were squabbling over Wanda.  The dull hum of a cement mixer comes through the air from beyond several layers of plastic sheeting.  Low-impact water exercises could help re-gain mobility without putting unnecessary pressure on the lower body, so Tony ordered a series of pools to be put in.  He’s been watching videos about water aerobics.
together.  We’re smart, able, and hella attractive.  But we even each other out, and we both need that happy, okay.  We fit tighter like clock cogs, designed to move with each other perfectly and
Three of the mottled goblin things were attached to his boot, and Steve didn't hesitate to smash them to jelly.
“Yes, but you don’t have a filter.  You always say just what you’re thinking, so there’s never any mistaking your mood.”
Steve just laughed, letting the unerring tension that he had been carrying dissolving in the acidic air.
Tony grunts, but with Steve’s help, they manage to loosen the blankets enough to free an arm. Soon enough, he is greedily slurping coffee and Steve is settling into the couch next to him after dumping a load of wet cloth into the wash.
“Rhodey likes to get the important shit out of the way before dealing with whatever emotional constipation you’re going through.  Second we clear this place, he’ll be on you like wolves on a sheep carcass.”
, you’re the center of us.  When I’m around you, I’m calm, I’m happy, and I never really knew what that was like until you.  When I’m with you, I feel – I feel
The woman stared uncomprehendingly, and Steve remembered the modern term.  “PTSD.  He has PTSD, and strangers aren’t good for him.”
They paused to catch their breath, listening to Shapanka’s groans and curses in Hungarian. Steve was grinning at him like he was the sun. “Iron Man! To – Mister Stark said I might see you around. I hadn’t guessed it would be today!” A look of concern crossed his face. “Everything’s alright?”
for this child of Hephaestus and I’m not changing my mind.  But, they should be with us very soon, and you can ask them for time privileges.  In the meantime, take some time to get to know the place.  I think the waterworks project is more pressing, and you volunteered.  They’ll keep you busy, trust me.  Fair?”
Korkyra patted him on the head.  “Don’t pay attention to them, dear.  Nausikaa sees Steve as a replacement older brother she can pester, and anyone else nearby gets the backwash.  Now, tell us about yourself.”
“He’s not home.”  Steve had driven Bucky back to Camp Nelson after they had gotten lunch.  The roundtrip drive from Malibu to the tiny town in the forest Steve and his crew members lived in was about eight hours, and Steve had said he might hang out with them for a little while and get some paperwork he needed to go over.  The satellite tracking on Steve’s phone said he’d be home any minute.
“You’re lost.  You’re floundering.  You give off the appearance that you’re solid, but you’re anything but.  There’s a saying of being a duck in water – or is it a goose – anyway, you look serene and calm, but beneath the water’s surface, there is a flurry of kicking and paddling.  I
What bothered him most was Makris’ bit of the song.  Suffering and hardship were to be expected in war.  But the lines about how he already suffered.
But he shook himself out of it, regretfully breaking Steve’s grip on him.  They both shuffled awkwardly, Steve squatting down to fuss with the bag.  Tony spun once on the spot, staring at the landscape without seeing it, then once again, more slowly, as he took it all in.
“Well, Jeremy, consider yourself lucky.  Had your grandfather been with us storming the beaches, the likelihood of him surviving to have your mother would be a lot slimmer.”
“You had a strange way of seducing me, Rogers.”  He moaned overly obscenely when Steve began to work on the knobs of his spine in his lower back.
Stern frowned.  “Captain, eighteen year-olds are choosing colleges, not fighting aliens and monsters.”
The sky has darkened considerably by the time they break apart, violet and plum shadows streaking the clouds. “Well, we had best get going.  Can’t let Zemo dance around free forever.”
Bruce looked about ready to Hulk out just to get out of there.  “Uh, I just wanna finish my work here and . . . .”  He trailed off.
“We get a lot more rain here than in Athens, but it follows the same patterns,” Steve volunteered.  “Winter is the rainy season, summer is much drier.”
He doesn’t. Tony alters his stance, calculating how much his armor can take.  It should hold.  Should.
“It’s great, Tony.”  There’s a smile on Steve’s face, one that Tony knows well.  All calcium and whiteness.  No warmth.  Tense at the corners of the mouth, cold sad eyes that asses the minimalistic room.
He looks slightly terrified, which is something Tony can’t say he’s seen a lot of. Sure, Steve has faced plenty of things that would make most people shit their pants in fear with gritted teeth and defiant remarks.  But this isn’t something like that.  His life isn’t at stake.
Bruce cut in before Tony could answer.  “No, it’s still a touchy subject.  The only reason I was talking about my daughter was because a crazy billionaire-“
Tony just rolled his eyes.  “Yeah, cause everyone else here has been so forthcoming with information.”
Rightfully so. Tony isn’t paying him in more rubles than possibly imaginable in this region and the unreleased StarkSnowtreader to ask questions.  Akim’s job is to use his experience to escort his single passenger as deep into the Ural Mountains as possible, before dropping Tony off and heading back to his village.  It is January, but Akim, Inga, and their children’s lives will be exponentially better after this occurrence, so Akim was agreeable to the job.  They both get what they want.  Akim gets money and a vehicle that will make his mountaineering business far more profitable.  Tony gets to follow a vapor trail into one of the most treacherous regions of the world.
But Maria Stark will always be his Mom.  She's who he thinks of when that word comes up in conversation, and he will always remember to have flowers delivered to her grave on her birthday and on Mother's Day when he can't deliver them himself.  She's the one in the pictures, holding him as a baby, holding his hand, on his arm at his graduations.  Hers is the voice her hears when he wants comfort, and hers is the warmth he imagines when it all gets too much.
“-eve?  Earth to Cap?” Tony waved a hand.  “Something wrong?  I know you got better reflexes than that.”
He wandered into the courtyard, dragging his trunk as he headed towards the narrow staircase that led to the southern side of the
Steve didn’t know what to do.  He had refused to keep Bucky away from anything, remembering how he had felt during his integration process, but now he was wondering if the shock of it all had been too much.  Seventy years, aliens, Steve’s relationship with Howard’s son, it was all strange.  Steve wanted to help, but he couldn’t think of anything else to do.
“I need to know more about what he knows. Got an intel raid in the works?”  Steve nods and pulls up a map on the glass tabletop.  “We’re shooting blind here, so I just want to know as much as possible before we go deeper.”
And Tony realizes just how tired he is. The type of bone deep weariness that you can only fully appreciate when you’re finally able to finally sleep.
Tony stepped inside despite the requests for him to stay put. Helpers were hovering over the icy figures with towels and hand-dryers, attempting to revive the people trapped within. The uncovering of the face and mouth seemed to be what brought those frozen back to consciousness. Steve was laid out a platform, a thin sheet of ice on his face and upper body. Happy’s arms were beginning to emerge, but Pepper’s head and shoulders were out. “Tony!” she called in distress.
Quickly growing bored of the upstairs rooms, Tony decided to scope out the rest of the buildings.  He took the back stairs down, leading him into a cramped hallway, next to a small kitchen.  Several cooks were preparing dinner by the sound of it.
“I – “ Steve gulped. “Yes. Pepper got frozen, then Happy. I went to get you, but you weren’t there. But Iron Man was.” He looked up, his eyes like heat-seeking missiles. “How did Iron Man get there so fast?”
“Then how else will you see what it’s made of?” Steve breathed, and the last quivering inches were closed.
The producer pointed at him needlessly.  He smiled and waved at the piped in cheers, face pulled taunt, felling like a grimace.  His face took up a third of the plasma screen, right in the middle.  He usually insisted on being called Steve Rogers as opposed to Captain America, but America didn’t need to know how Steve Rogers felt about Tony Stark, just what Captain America felt about Iron Man.
Steve looked like he was trying really hard not to punch the kid.  Tony knew.  No matter how much Steve tried to down play it, D-Day was less than five years away in his memory.  “What’s your name?”
Fury gave another knowing smile.  Tony was going to stab the next person who gave him one.  “Stop thinking you know anything about him.  There are legends, and there is reality.  He’ll give you the respect you give him.  And Tony,” Fury gestured around to the assorted dockworkers.  “Did no one ever tell you that gods often put on the faces of men and walk among us to test us?  Maybe don’t always assume people who come from the outside of large cites give everything away.  Now, you might as well go try and fix your little slip up?”
Her eyebrows were going to bury themselves in her hairline, he was sure.  “So does this mean you’re going to get off your ass and
“Father, Athenians, I have been to Sparta, where I challenged the vicious Velkhanos, who called upon the gods to decimate our great city, and won.  I bring you his head -” Tony pulled the leather pouch from his belt, opening and gripping the shaggy hair and pulling it out with a flourish to a chorus of ‘ooh’s.  The stump of the neck was still damp and crusty from the heat, and there were plump maggots squirming in the eye sockets.  “- as proof of my victory.”
After combing his hair and beard, Tony wandered over to one of the trunks that several men had brought up to his room.  Tony was fairly certain they weren’t proper palace servants, but he was beginning to think the entire island dropped what they were doing to help Steve.
When he woke up, he always was up and out of bed as soon as he could be, contrary to popular belief.  There was no reason to lay around in bed, not when there was a world to protect and change and improve.  And there was never anything worth saying in bed for.
“Whoa, Steve don’t tell me you have a problem with Bucky being a little fast and loose with gender stereotypes.  Men can wear nail polish if they want.  I plan to have your dick in my ass in about twenty minutes, so don’t say-“
Steve was in the throne room, discussing things with a small council of older men around the hearth, so Tony took advantage of the opportunity to examine the walls in the light of day.
“Ask Pepper nicely,” Bruce shot back.  Tony didn’t have time to respond before he continued.  “Weren’t you telling me his friends had a kid?  That nice couple you invited over around Christmas?  You shoved Jane at me, saying she was an astrophysicist?  Thor, was it, who drank everyone under the table but stayed sober?  You were lying on the floor, tugging at his pants, begging me to x-ray him for hollow legs?  You went to their wedding over Valentine’s Day?”
go back.  And you can’t expect him to do that for you.  You want him to ground you here.  But he can’t do that.
Tony’s phone pinged with Clint’s response, showing a picture of the waffle iron in the kitchen with the caption “Found urs 2 he m8ks food tats EATABLE”.  He fired back with “Then get him to make you new arrows”.
“Oh, your friend has not told you? I must credit him for my grand discovery.  You see, I once met a man who looked much like Tony Stark, and I told him this.  And the man smiled with the pride only a father can have for his son.  Then he made his mistake.  I tried to apprehend him, and he fought.  And do you know what he turned into?”
As far as he knew, he was the last to shower, so he could use as much hot water as he pleased.  He relished it, lethargically massaging industrial soap into his skin and generic shampoo into his hair.  It wasn’t certain when he’d have a chance to bathe and sleep after they left the Barton Farm, so he wasn’t going to hurry it.
Steve is careful as he climbs on Tony’s back, but sure of himself and his footing. Steve already knows where to place his feet and hands, like he was some sort of dragon rider in a previous life.
It doesn’t seem like he’s gotten anywhere before he has to stop and make camp for the night. His legs ache.  He has no practice wearing snow shoes, and finds himself lifting each foot far too high to be efficient, but if he doesn’t he’ll be stuck.  His knees ache, his hips ache, his calves ache, his thighs ache.  They throb with each beat of his heart, loud in his ears along with the howl of winds over gorges.
Tony slunk over to the bedside, debating with himself.  He snatched up one of the perfectly shaped pillows and pressed his nose into it.  There, underneath the detergent if he concentrated long enough, was a trace of slight spice and home.  Steve.
honest.  Tony wondered if they got it from their mother.  He could see himself maybe falling for someone like that.
“Oh, come on Rhodes, gimme a little slack, will you?  I walked from Athens to Sparta, and half of the way back.  In armor.”
“Don’t come any closer,” Tony called as he back up towards the wall, searching for some way, any way, to catch or stall Shapanka long enough for Tony to figure out how to disable the ice maker. Shapanka, crossing a section of floor that disguised the trapdoor for the stairs down into the basement labyrinth. “I’m warning you . . . . “
“Tony, don’t think you have to pretend,” Natasha reasoned, “you told us about Howard.  Now, tell us about your
Then Steve had ‘tried’ to smother Tony with a pillow, which had devolved into the two of them smashing each other in the head with pillows, which then turned to play wresting, which ended up with Tony deep-throating his cock while Steve simultaneously demonstrated his nonexistent gag reflex.
“Tony, why are you always wearing sunglasses?”  The inquiry comes from the breakfast bar.  Steve’s eating a mixture of about a dozen scrambled eggs, fried kale, and bacon.  Instead of either hating modern food or forgetting the old, he mixes it and makes them feel like shit when he’s happy that he
Unbidden into his mind was a image of Steve, in a soft thin hoodie and flannel pants standing in an empty kitchen at 3 A.M., holding a bottle to a tiny infant that he cradled to his broad chest, crooning some old Irish song about Carrickfergus and Ballygrant and the sea being too wide to cross.  Steve would look up, and smile at Tony with soft eyes –
“They’re my competition!” Clint shouted, and Tony felt the dull sting in his calf of a popcorn kernel.
“I should probably look into that once my decryption program finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.”
Steve effortlessly caught and tossed the shield back on its hook, then grabbed Tony by the arm and hauled over his shoulders, then half-dragged, half-carried him over to one of the benches.  He carefully laid him down.  “Tony?”
The sun had yet to rise, but there was light enough to see, purpling as it threatened dawn.  He could hear the grunts of pigs awoken with feed, and the crackle of cooking fires.  In the hills, shepherds were driving their flocks to their new pastures.
With a flutter of an eyelid, all three of the nymphs faded like mirages.  The air cooled and the refracted sunlight seemed to lessen in intensity.  The water was less vibrant, and seemed to lose some of its shine.
It was quiet after that.  Steve stirred the stew, scraping the sides of the pot every few moments for something to do.  Tony dozed on the couch in the other room, sniffing occasionally and going through digital paperwork when he wasn’t.  It was relatively peaceful.
“Pedicure and all!  And now,” Tony aggrandized, obviously bursting to reveal the last set.  “Obviously, mine was best, but this one’s not bad.”
China shattered, shards pinging off the tile, droplets of stew coving the spotless floor.  Tony jumped back, letting his stomach be covered by the thick fabric, but not before the image of tanned, lightly-defined abs, covered in a bit of wiry black hair embedded itself in Steve's corneas.
The door was locked, of course, with key card or number pad access.  The 2, 7, 9, and asterisk were worn down, but Rhodey just waved the RF scrambler again instead of playing the guessing game.
“What?  This madhouse?  With Natasha and her knives and Sam and his birds and . . . everything else?”
He lets Steve down on one of the relatively unscathed sides of the building, then takes  to the air again, scanning the perimeter.  The Avengers are hacking away at the fleeing troops, but they have it more than covered.  Carol is playing with her food and getting mad when someone shoots it before she's finished playing.  They don't seem distressed that there is a dragon flying around, and they aren't aiming at him thankfully.  He blasts a line of henchmen with fire, and someone lets out a whoop.
There had been offers to upgrade as years had passed, but Tony preferred to keep the one year token.
Deep down, Tony knew that, but he doesn’t want to think rationally right now.  He wants to destroy anyone and anything that says anything terrible about Steve.
The front desk gave the man a set of keys for a first-floor room as soon as he said “Tony Stark”, and they quickly got him inside the blessedly dark and cool room. The man tried to deposit Tony on the bed, but he just waved the man off. Eyebrows twisted in confusion, the man bowed out. Tony heard the lock snick from the other side.
“Oh Tony!” a feminine voice called, at odds with the grit and grease of the track. The pit crew puffed up their chests and attempted to wipe the black smudges from their faces, but the pristine woman in white linen and a red head scarf only had eyes for Tony as she rushed into his arms.
“Oh,” Steve smirked.  “I see your game.”   He took his kyathos and quickly drained it.  “No news?”  She shook her head, once, and took back the cup.  She looked at Tony, green eyes unusually sharp.
Tony had gotten drunk.  How he had gotten the alcohol, and for what reason, Steve could probably guess, but Steve could understand Tony wanting to forget the last few hours.  JARVIS had contacted him probably only after Tony had passed out, and was concerned Tony would choke on his vomit.
Steve had a triumphant smile on his face, nodding as if Tony had just passed some sort of test.  “One of the first things I learned about being a king: don’t let people undermine your own convictions.  Not everyone can be king, but everyone believes themselves a kingmaker.  Tony, if there’s something you feel you need to do, or something you believe to be right, don’t listen to people with ulterior motives.  Follow your instincts.  Heed good advice, but be wary of your advisors.  At the end of the day, you are the one making the decision, and the consequences will be on your head.”
Tony had to bite back a grin. “Point taken. You know, you don’t have to stand sentry. I can handle this. Is there a lounge at this place?”
It was funny, he pondered as he crashed through the dark corridors towards the vault block, heat from the chest lamp warming the entire chest plate, how needed Iron Man was despite the loneliness and thanklessness.
He remembered it well.  He had thought Steve was being a stubborn stick-in-the-mud (not that they were both more than capable of accomplishing that) and had tried for a couple of months to get Steve to accept Tony’s electronics, and Steve had denied him the pleasure of the object of his affections accepting his gifts.  Then one day he had come across an unfamiliar tablet in the common living room, and everyone had said it was Steve’s.  The mass of 20
They were doing final checks on his racer. Sleek lines, of course, because Tony designed this car himself. “She’s purrin’ like a Persian cat, boss! The Stark Special is ready for action!”
Tony was still very relaxed from Steve’s earlier ministrations, and it only took a few perfectly placed strokes that had Tony hissing from sensitivity and begging Steve to fuck him.
And only Pepper and Rhodey know, so they’re the only ones who get to see him in his workshop, in sweats and tank tops, no sunglasses, no armor.
So whoever he has kids with will want to name their daughter after him.  Great.  “I like that you’re named after my mother.  Peter, be happy you’re not named Howard.”
Now it’s overwhelming and slightly unbearable, pushing and pulling against one another in sheer desperation, and every thrust reminds Tony of how deeply Steve is already lodged inside of him.
The room was empty save for a darkly colored man in a bright saffron peplos with long sleeves, gold broaches shaped like the sun acting as fasteners.  He had a falcon perched on his shoulder, the same one who had flown over the trireme before, if Tony could trust his eyes.  The man was feeding the bird bits of food, sometimes putting the pieces between his lips for the falcon to take.
The twins seemed very interested in Peggy, but when Steve pushed them, he was met with silence.  Usually they just told him that someone wasn’t right for him, so hopefully they wanted Steve to find out on his own.
Steve swallowed several times, giving Tony a wonderful demonstration on how his throat worked, breathed deep, and sat up straight in time for the waitress to return with their drinks.
The news people were all over the photos produced from the shoot.  All of the pictures chosen were close-ups of the polish on everyone’s nails.  Tony and Rhodey had retracted the fingers from the gauntlets to show off their manicures, Steve had gripped the edge of his shield to display the color, Clint had shown off
It was dusk before they arrived at the site of the wedding.  It was set up in the middle of the Very Large Array, a couple hundred folding chairs draped in blue, red, and gold in amidst the enormous satellite dishes.  Women were stumbling over the rocky ground and tufts of grass in their colored heels; Clint and Sam were hobbling to try and mimic them.  Nat just rolled her eyes.
“That’s wonderful, doll. Win this for me.” She placed a wet, smacking kiss an inch from his mouth, no doubt leaving red tracks on his cheek. “We’ll be sure to celebrate later, yeah?”
“Such a tragedy.”  Since Steve had moved out last year, Bucky had unceremoniously informed him that no, he would not be welcoming Steve back to their shared room, but they weatherproofed the sun porch for Steve to stay in during the summer.  It was just another thing that left Tony cautiously optimistic, because it wasn’t in shape to be inhabited in the winter.  Which meant Steve intended to move back down to LA after the fire season was over.  Back to Tony.
They both smelled awful, like sewer and sweat and the hot musky reek of dead animal, but beneath Steve found the metallic thrum of blood and smoky grease and orange cream hand cleaner and
He has the armor, so the terrain isn’t an issue. He probably should wait for spring at least, but he is fit to burst, chasing answers that have led here.  Tony doesn’t know how the Urals might hold the key to the puzzle of his origin, but waiting has never been his strong suit.
It was late afternoon when they got back, the yard decked out in overly tacky red, white, and blue.  There were streamers, and balloons, and those horrible foil centerpieces on top of the red table cloths.  The party already looked to be in full swing.
Ilya picks up his coat. “I will excuse myself.  I have calls to make.  I hope you will consider what I have told you, Tony.  Do not be a stranger, cousin.”  He claps Tony on the back, then sees his way out.
Then they’re kissing, and now that Steve is an active participant it’s just south of heaven. It’s not gentle, but it’s not bruising. It’s an extension of what they’ve always had: one pushing, the other pulling, each one giving as good as they get. Pressing against one another, and molding everything into completion.
Aside from their slitted nature, the eyes that regard him are the precise shade of deep blue that Tony sees whenever he can muster a look in the mirror.
He stands, vulnerable in his snow shoes. Nothing but a few layers of cloth protects him from frostbite and death.
His temper has run short. “Because I’m allowed to visit my family?  Do I need to get permission for that, huh, Steve?”
“So they think.  He hasn’t proven it yet,” Barton supplied, and the girl smiled victoriously.  “Stark, can’t you figure out that it keeps out the bad guys when you spray it on the doors and windows?”
“Oh, I was just in the neighborhood,” she fluttered her lashes. “Thought I’d stop by to see my favorite fella win!”
you that they couldn’t tell you much.  It was all about bluff and distraction.  And Tony was a master of that game.  But the rules out here were something completely foreign to him.
Mission Control was rattling off some procedure for adapting an oxygen canister to the LEM.  “Apollo 13?” he asks as he sat down next to Steve.  Not
“You’re very good at this,” Tony noted quietly, loath to interrupt the stillness of the rosy dawn, but also genuinely impressed at her skill.  Natasha was obviously deadly, but in such a precise, controlled way that was impossible not to find awe-inspiring.
Steve is still rather tense around Tony, but doesn’t bring anything up. He seems content, for the time being, to ignore it.
much, despite our life being far rougher than your perfumed existence.  You don’t look down on anyone, when someone in your position usually would.”
I'm not going to delete it.  I fucked up.  I'm keeping a record of that.  I try to remember my own failings.
you can have it, consider it a gift, in gratitude for all you do,” the man blathered as he dismounted.
He might have blacked out for a minute, but when he was back in his mind, he could feel the flow of electricity into the battery and firing up the chest plate, his heart once again pumping a strong steady rhythm. He gave himself a moment to just breathe, slumped against the wall, savoring the cool and the flood of energy back into his body.
Tony huffed the same way Maria did when she was trying to act superior.  “Okay, Rogers, but I am still taking advantage of mood swings, foot rubs, and sending you out for ice cream at 3 a.m.”
“Please tell me you’re going to appeal to my humanity,” Loki drawled as he made his way across the sunken living room.
Natasha ignored him, so Tony was fairly sure that was the right course of action.  “He’s an artist?”
So while his insides were bubbling and boiling and burning, he remained cooler than a freezer pop, only hoping he didn’t melt.
It was more fun than a regular factory tour, not just because he was with handsome company, but because he was with . . .
Steve turned to Tony, blue eyes inhumanly bright.  Like he was gauging what Tony was capable of.  “I think you have the necessary components to be a great hero, like those of old.  But individuals won’t work this time around.  We need a team of heroes this time.  I guess what I’m asking,” Steve stopped at the top of the stairs, turned and leaned against the wall.  Confident and absolutely gorgeous.  And holding Tony’s future in his hand.  “Are you willing to join us?”
A double sigh.  In the almost six years since Steve had woken up to Peter and Maria in his head,   as much as he enjoyed getting to know them, they’d yet to say who their mother was, or even give Steve a hint as to when or where they would meet.  The only thing they would say was it would be a while.
(A few months ago, Tony had imperiously declared to everyone that he had the best hemoglobin levels out of the Avengers.  What he wouldn’t trade to go back to those days of easy friendship and raucous laughter, instead of . . . whatever this was now.)
It would be a sham, and it would be painful as hell, but he’s weak. Weak enough right now to try it, because more than anything right now, he wants to drink away what burns and festers within, the insurmountable canyon between them. Close enough to see and hear, but never touch. And crossing it would be suicide.
“Well,” Bruce said, determiningly watch Thor peel off the top of the container, “you should be there when he wakes up.  I think it would make you both feel . . . better.”
But Tony doesn’t fear knowledge. It is against his nature.  Enlightenment is not always kind, and it can be an immense burden, but he has found more pure joy in learning than in any other pursuit besides maybe standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Steve as they took on the world.  When things were easier, and they weren’t so beaten.
, and returning with the pill bottle and a glass of water.  He fumbled with the cap, finally getting it off and pouring the prescribed two pills into Tony’s waiting palm.  He gulped them down dry.
It had been fine when he didn’t know he was in love with Tony.  But now, with songs about love and heartbreak gushing through the surround sound speakers, Steve wasn’t sure if he could handle it.
As the golden armor passed the state troopers, they set their sirens on for about five seconds before shutting them off and waving the man away with laughter. They paused on the shoulder, watching Iron Man slip away into the sunrise, probably remarking on how good Iron Man was, how important he was, how glad they were that he was on their side.
Steve was staring at him. Eyes wide and blue, body pulled into a slight crouch, as if he had been in the middle of hurling something at his attacker. Tony just wanted to peel off the armor and wrap his arms around Steve until he returned to full warmth.
If he loved Steve as much as he though he did, they would need to be on equal footing if he wanted to convince Steve to stay forever.
Clint nodded.  “Just needed the name, thank you, but by all means give me the whole biography.  And don’t tell everyone about my snooping.  Not that I do it.”
A pair of bay leaves hit the broth, and Steve’s face was glowing red.  “Stop it.  Stop trying to make it happen.”
Shapanka let out a muffled noise of pain, before arches of ice shot from the hole, tipped in gross exaggerations of fingers. They trapped him, in the likes of a cage and wrapped around his ankles. Tony was able to smash through the ice, but numbness was already spreading through the armor.
So, no matter how much he would have liked to, there was no jetting off to Paris and renting out the Louvre so Steve could do his art thing, no heading to Rome for after-dinner gelato, no purchasing a new yacht and taking a month-long cruise of the Mediterranean, no buying out an entire resort in Aspen so he could take Steve skiing.
“I’m letting you go because of the brilliant work you did in the past,” Tony informed him. “But as I can no longer trust you with government secrets or anything of the sort, I’m going to have to ask you to vacate the premises. Empty your desk and get out. And you would do well never to show your face here again.”
“GPS says it’s straight ahead.  It won’t be well marked, but we’ll figure it out.  Our only timeline is self-imposed.”  Natasha was gently stroking the bristly hairs on the back of his neck.  Trying to soothe him, but it was only setting him more on edge.
Tony couldn’t help but feel whiny at all her runaround.  “All anyone will tell me is the gods favor us.  Why am I not allowed to know more, and why is Steve the one who has to tell me?”
“Does it really matter what they look like?  They’re just gonna end up dissolved is stomach acid,” Steve retorted, chopping the last of the fatty beef off the bones and proceeded to start skimming the excess fat from the skin of the soup.  "You can order out, and leave the rest to me.”
, half finished sketches of him in a billion poses, sleeping and eating and inventing.  There are pages devoted to his hands, his mouth, his
Tony wanted to ask, but decide for the sake of his thirst he should play along.  He drew his sword, allowing Pikas to see the oiled bronze with its silver studs, forged by Tony’s own hand.
A person of lesser experience might have though the three beings in from of him were merely exceptionally beautiful women.  But Tony had seen far more than most people.  These women were exceptionally clean, not marked by dirt and sweat the way he and Steve were.  Their skin was perfect, completely hairless and free of moles, scars, and other blemish, inhumanly perfect.  Their tunics were made of a weightless fabric, sheer like silk and finer than Egypt’s best linen.
Steve doesn’t seem to notice, thankfully and unfortunately. “No, I get it. I’d be a hypocrite if I gave you shit for it. I’ve been there before.”
And if he just gave Steve a check, that would be it. He could very well track him down, but Steve was sitting
He was about to ask if anyone had seen him, but his phone buzzed with a message from Steve.  “Right outside the door, there’s a thing that looks like a water fountain.”
“Oh my God, Bruce, never let it be said you are not my favorite.   Thank you, I’m going to get my babies because of your help, you’re a magnificent creature-  As soon as you stop hearing Padma, I’m gonna give you a credit card with no limit and give you paid leave until you find her,” Tony babbled.
“Jack Frost froze you,” Tony said as he approached slowly. Steve was staring at his hands. “Do you remember?”
The oil he had been supplied with wasn’t the best, but he supposed he’d have to get used to that.  It wasn’t horrible, but it wasn’t the viscous liquid he was used to at home.  It was thinner, lighter, yellow rather than green, like the crappy stuff they sold in the agora.  Tony dabbed a bit on his tongue.  Not bad.  Not Kretan, but Korkyra didn’t seem like the place that imported things it could produce.  The only man who could probably import was his host, and Tony doubted Steve would keep the best oil for himself.  But Tony liked it better than the earthy, fuller oil that came from Athens.  Korkyran olive oil was light and fruity, with a hint of grass.
The pristine sports car waited in the scraggly bushes. Tony landed as softly as he could, which was to say, rather harshly, jarring his kneecaps. Redesigned schematics floated through his head as he disassembled the armor into his attaché case. It was time for new armor, not that this armor hadn’t served him well. But there were so many new ideas to improve, to better, and Iron Man needed to be the best it was possible to be.
Steve was probably the worst.  He was the most parent-approved Avenger, and Tony was often shocked by the soft look that appeared on his face when little kids approached him.  He always knelt down, got on their level, and chatted politely.  He saved every drawing they gave him.
“Steve asked me to come get you. You need to be debriefed on what you missed.  Rhodey tagged along because he is like a baby ducking who lost his mother when you’re gone,” Carol supplies as she helps herself to an apple spice donut hole.
The Tony Stark Aesthetic: three piece bespoke Italian suit, Italian loafers, some personalized scent that made him want to retch when he opened the bottle, sunglasses.
“What time is it?” Steve asked Natasha blearily as she steered him through the maze of carts and hallways, and into the appropriate elevator.  Three months ago, and Steve would have been sitting vigil in the pediatric wing.  He had hated all children’s hospitals they’d made him visit, with their overt cheeriness trying to cover up the scent of dying children.  Smiley faces and rainbows and cancer.  At least in the adult wings, the mood was more somber, and in tune with people’s actual moods.
“Tony Stark . . . not recommended.  That doesn’t make any sense.  How can you approve me but not approve me?”
Stern, the smug asshole, decided to cut in.  “Captain, we’re not implying Stark’s genius, we’re simply saying that, at his age-“
His vision whites out as he comes, but he keeps his eyes open, wondering what Steve will see.  He comes down with Steve spooned into his side, pressing butterfly kisses to Tony’s eyelids.
Nat sighed, and moved a precariously balanced pile of papers and sat at the end of the desk Tony was working from.  The computers were from the mid 2000’s, took ages to load, but were horrible for a modern hacker because of how incompatible the systems were.  So here he was, wiping the programs by hand while Rhodey tried to find the specific wavelength’s receiver and yank it out.  With Nat staring into his soul.
Usually, Steve hated calling on the extremes of the raw power and property damage that came with teaming up with the Hulk, but there were times, he reflected as he tried to ineffectually wipe the orange acid off on his pant leg, that it could be useful.
“So why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project?  I mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place?”
His files said something about ADHD.  Steve was still of the opinion that it was just an excuse to medicate people to act “normal”.  Sure, some people had issues with sitting still, but from what he’d researched on the disorder, it was more about concentration.  Tony moved a lot, yes, but his concentration was frighteningly intense.  Steve occasionally wondered what it would be like if Tony concentrated on a person as much as when he concentrated on a project.
As they had gotten closer to New York, Steve had gotten more and more subdued. By the time they pulled into the station he’d been positively morose. He’s barely uttered a word beyond “Sure” and a noncommittal “Mmm”.
He pulled up the sheet and slid in, burrowing into a cocoon.  Stared out at the cold room, wondering where he had gone wrong, and where to go from here.
The entire expanse of seashore seemed to come second to the water.  It was so blue, bluer than the sky and Steve’s eyes.  Rich, deep blue out in the deep waters, and more turquoise waters, variable with shadows, so clear so could see straight to the bottom along the shore.  Epirus rose to the east, sharp cliffs and forbidding forest.  Tony knew that those forests weren’t home to any humans until you reached Dodona, far to the east.  Other islands rose dramatically from the water, and Tony imagined he could see Leukas and Ithaka and Kephallenia.  Far, far to the west, Tony could see a haze of land, and remembered how Steve said you could see Italy on a good day.  He passively wondered how long it would take to get from Korkyra to Zancle.
Last night, when Steve had been lowering Tony into his bed, he had clung close and asked Steve to stay.
It stung as Tony shifted, trying to find the best crevice to embed himself in.  It stung that Tony thought Steve wouldn’t care, that Steve didn’t think he was worth knowing.
“Steve!” Tony called, and was helpless to resist marching over and giving Tony a kiss.  “Clint is a heathen.”
“Well, not exactly like Talos.  He walked around Krete three times a day.  I only get around to doing it once,” Steve squinted at the sun, high in the sky.  “I’m not going to make you come along, if that’s what you’re wondering.”
Maria, always the more vocal of the twins, had a rigid frostiness in her tone that was completely different from her usual warm softness beneath her layer of snark.
From outside there were raised voices, shouting, gunfire. Pepper was yelling at Happy, but that wasn’t unusual. There was also a strange hissing sound, and an icy crackle that was probably Jack Frost freezing the guards where they stood.
She pulled a knife from her belt, cut off some fresh chives and parsley from the tiny herb pots that Bruce kept on the window sill, and began brutally chopping them fine, so fine they almost became paste.  “Tony’s going to be the guy who sleeps around to try and find some sort of intimacy.  The only reason he hasn’t already is because of all he’s been through in the past few years and all of the responsibilities he has.  But mark my words,” she fixed him with a glare so intense he felt two inches tall.  “I
The ocean peaked out from under the clouds.  The expanses of blue and white were beautiful.  Unforgiving.  Inevitable.
The door opened, admitting two men in black.  Special Forces uniforms.  Ones like he had never seen.  Their guns looked like something out of a science fiction illustration.
There was a sudden absence.  Peter and Maria were gone from their heads, never to return.  Tony trembled and clutched the arto-utero closer.
that artfully captured the clear blue of the glow of the arc reactor.  The packaging had a beautiful woman who looked sort of like a tall, busty female version of Tony wearing an Ironette bikini brandishing her hands for all to see her manicure, a knowing smirk on her face.
Steve continued to let his gaze bore a hole in the table. “I’m sure she was after you, Mister St – Tony. You’re a rakishly handsome genius millionaire. And I’m . . . me.” A slight blush tinged his cheeks.
Something alights in her eyes, and she jumps up, scrambling for her phone. “Sorry, I just remembered that I have brunch plans with pretty much everyone that’s not you two.  Toodles!”  She’s texting furiously before she leaves the table, obliviously dripping creamer everywhere.
Tony had the painting commissioned to hang in his offices to remind those who entered of his “close relationship” with the man in golden armor. “Yes! He . . . uh . . . happens to be a very good friend of mine. You might see him on occasion. He drops by frequently.”
He liked the pyrite.  It was uniform, organized.  Pretty.  Shimmering cubes that rested primly on coal or sandstone.  They looked best on the shelf, because they looked almost manufactured next to the fractured and uneven stones.
And why had all this happened?  Because Steve was blind?  No, he was a mislead idiot who thought he knew better than an eighteen-year-old genius what was right for him.
“Look,” Tony spat.  “Don’t give me any of this ‘I’m supposed to be a role model,’ or ‘you’re Howard’s son’ bullshit.  You need stop caring about doing what people expect of you, and I’m not here as anyone other than Tony, Iron Man, your teammate, comrade-in-arms or whatever.  You treat me as an adult in everything.  Except this.
As soon as Tony entered, Howard banished the slaves who were cleaning the spilled wine from the night before with vinegar.  One of them fumbled and spilled her jar, which gave Tony a moment to examine the wall as Howard screamed at the girl.
It might take a bit of finagling, but if no one was using the forge, and he made a good impression on Steve, he might get use of the outbuilding.  Steve seemed to want to give him the things he would need to be comfortable.  He allowed the spark of hope that he might like Korkrya grow into a little fire.
They never yelled at him, their disapproval just grew, and Tony was forced to drink more to stave off the feelings of worry and concern.
Steve had figured out that Tony wasn’t in this for sex, Tony was being dishonest about his feelings, Tony was in love with him.
He was sent to school not long after he got better.  His father didn’t come to see him off.  His mother leaned down for untold numbers of hugs and kisses, the new necklace she had bought swinging, a center slice of an amethyst geode.
The kid pulled a compact digital camera that probably cost fifty dollars and handed it to his buddy in the front seat.
Thor frowned again.  “When we would do those battles, we would roast game on an open fire.  Surely that’s not what you mean?”
Tony couldn’t pinpoint what formal place the Alastors kept in the hierarchy, but it did seem that they were recognized akin to a royal family.  (In Steve’s absence, people seemed to defer to Sam in his place.)  However, they didn’t remain separate or aloof.  Different members of the household came up to Tony quite brazenly to introduce themselves, expressing their desire that he would enjoy his stay.  Oileos, Steve’s chief steward, a boisterous man of about fifty and a transplant from Salamis, entertained Tony with a lengthy anecdote about a fight he gotten into with a potter over a prostitute and some anchovies that had them all doubled over, clutching their knees.
He was young, but not. Tony wouldn’t peg him for being more than a couple years older than him, but something in his eyes was old, or better put, highly experienced. If Steve had been in the military, he’d obviously seen active combat, but there hadn’t been much in the way of any major wars in the past ten years. Vietnam was coming, Tony had seen that with his own eyes, but they were still easing in. Steve looked . . . war weary. Like a solider just come home to find the life they once knew gone, and floundering without something to fight.
When he returned home again, he locked himself away with his circuit boards and forgot he even considered geology worthwhile.
Not even remotely wheelchair accessible, he notes as he mounts the steep stairs cut into the ground, with warped wooden treads.
Natasha pulled him through the crowd of nurses, down the hall, into a tiny alcove.  It was down one of the hallways, tucked in a corner, across from the vending machines.  It had been furnished with a couch and several chairs, covered in a slick navy pleather.  There were several small tables covered in a mixture of outdated magazines, pamphlets for diseases and disorders and their warning signs, and worn blue hard-backed illustrated bible stories.
The falcon let out a particularly shrill shriek.  Sam held up a bit of fig and the bird swallowed it whole.  “Okay, I get that, I completely understand your thought process, but I’ve never been to Athens, so I can’t judge.”
It was all so surreal.  He was having a better time adjusting to the knowledge that aliens existed and wanted to destroy the Earth better than he was responding to being in the twenty-first century.
“Stop trying to kill the pigeons,” Tony ordered as he stepped off the platform when the last of the armor was removed and stared for the door, tamping down on the spike of pleasure that came whenever the idea of Steve came up.
The glass walls of the lab were soundproof, but it must have only been to a certain decibel level, because the vibrations increased enough that Steve felt his teeth chatter in his head.
He had wondered with Pepper, if it was possible that they might be the twins’ mother.  They refused to answer, so one day he asked if she would have kids.
, after all the miscommunication and jumping to conclusions.  They were in tandem as much as they had ever been, understanding what the other wanted before they even thought of it.
“Hello?”  One of the doors was propped open with a fire extinguisher, emitting the sounds of a ball game.  A man in a sweat-drenched tee shirt and a shining bald patch popped his head out.
“Steve, the serum makes you functionally immortal. You can be killed, but otherwise?  You’re going to live a
“That’s fine, because I love to be handed things.  So, let’s trade.”  She took the tablet, then smoothly slid it to Tony, stealing his champagne.  “Thank you.”
“<It keeps you warm in the mountains. But you had my wife leave out the best part.>”  Akim’s tone is joshing and light, but curious of his wealthy passenger.
Tony turned to the light on the wall. Long short short short pause. Code B. Armed intruders. Better than Code A, nuclear threat, but still unwelcome. The intercom buzzed, ringing out with Pepper’s voice, made rough by the transmission. “
“So, you’re a healer,” Tony turned back to Bruce as Clint and Natasha started sniping at each other about stealing Bruce’s food.
He’s not in any form of immediate danger, as far as he can tell. If it wanted to eat him, it could have done so by now.  It may be saving him for later, but why is he
“Ye – yeah,” Tony muttered, shaking his head vigorously, trying to clear the fog.  “Did I black out?”
Clint was a country fiend for some reason.  He liked a vast collection of things, but was always singing along to Johnny Cash or some other guy in a twangy voice.  He told Steve he had once had a banjo, but when Steve asked what had happened to it, Natasha had shouted from the kitchen “He is
Tony doesn’t know why tonight is the night for poking and prodding at the tender spots between them, but the night has left him feeling raw and exposed and a little too longing. Bringing Steve down to his level, and leaving him just as raw and exposed, foregoing the longing on Steve’s part. Though wishing with every atom it could be.
, that someone might have seen the potential between them filled him with, a fiery, restless longing.
“Have fun with your ‘private time’, boss!” Happy called after Tony’s swiftly retreating back, smoky coughs taunting him until the door was shut and dead bolted behind him.
“Ugh, is this what we’re gonna have to put up with now?” Clint complained before Natasha cuffed her ear.
Something in Tony’s chest squeezed the way it did whenever Steve did something especially thoughtful that left Tony wondering why
needing to get ready for some other thing that would also have him wasted by the night’s end.  Plus, they’re fashionable, and no “How to Get the Look” is complete without a listing for ridiculously overpriced sunglasses.
Steve pulled Tony against his chest, and he melted, burying his cheek in the dip between his pectorals.  Steve couldn’t resist adding, “I’d be happy to do all that, but you’d have to give up coffee . . . .”
, a warm mahogany that reminds him of the worn beads of his mother’s rosary.  Someplace safe, someplace warm, someplace when he was understood.
Tony let go with a wet smack, and Steve whimpered at the loss, before Tony worked his way down the sides of Steve’s cock, sucking gently, and with big innocent eyes, sucked Steve’s left testicle into his mouth.
He wasn’t going to die. Today, at least. Which was good, as there was still so much he had to accomplish, as Tony Stark and Iron Man. It was at moments like this that it hit him how ridiculously young he was. And, as he glanced around the cold room, how alone.
His voice is impossibly small when he asks the final question.  The once that dug inside his own brain and has been gnawing away.
But that’s not the right thing to think. He’s already damaged beyond repair, and no one can fix him. Yet he’s tempted, because if he worded it right, maybe he could guilt Steve into some semblance of a relationship. Because Steve would want to help, in any way possible, because that’s just what Steve does.
clothing, and you want to embroider it with gold no less.  Ridiculous.  You should be making new sheets for your husband’s bed –“
That’s a lie.  He knows now exactly what he’s missing, and is incapable of going without now that he knows.  It’s like the internet: sure, he lived without it for over twenty years, but now that he has it?  Not giving it up for the world.
of all people), but she’d eventually stopped.  Ostentatiously because he didn’t want to any hot gossip, Tony had approached her to see why, or if Cap had taken up with someone behind his back.
The other three stared after him.  Tony looked confused, Bruce looked resigned, and Natasha had a tightly fond smile.
The familiar lines of Steve’s face consort into frustration and rage. He starts shouting.  “That’s not what I mean!  Stop shrugging it off!  Your parentage doesn’t
An icy crackle sounded from behind him, and they both whirled around. Jack Frost lowered the hose he was using to ice the doorway closed. “So nice to see you again,
He threw himself on the bed with no further fuss, still wearing his sweatsocks.  He allowed himself the luxury of a groan as he palmed himself, fingers of his left hand tracing the planes of his chest lightly as the other hand played at the sensitive skin of his cock.  A sharp hiss issued from his lips as he ran his middle finger teasingly over the head, tracing the slit.
Caroline made a distressed-embarrassed sound, and pulled him away lambasting him about “sensitivity” and “being considerate of others”.  Steve had closed his eyes, and was breathing deeply, nostrils dilated and clutching the steel railing behind him in a death grip.  The people looked about ready to bolt, fearing whatever Steve would do.
have been hallucinating yesterday falter.  Golden skin and golden hair and rippling muscles.  Steve wasn’t
“I’m just putting this out there, Tony.  You don’t need to take this as a serious proposal –“ Steve stuttered.
“Because I have exerted untold energy keeping you alive for several years, and before that Pepper and Rhodey did the same thing.  If I killed you, even out of pity, they would hunt
The hiss of flamethrowers begins as the henchmen begin aiming for . . . nothing. Fire spreads across the rotted beams of the building.
Staring into Steve’s dopey-eyed expression, which he was undoubtedly mirroring, Tony was overcome with a desire to do nothing except keep this man with him for the rest of his life.  “Fuck it.  We’re not gonna get divorced.  Screw the pre-nup, and let’s go get married.”
Carol bounces up to them, wearing the massive grin she’s worn since she left for her mysterious brunch. “Are you going to sit around all day, or are you going to let me blow shit up?”
Steve’s laugh, bright like sunlight, burst forth. “I think I can pay attention to Happy’s turns. So, what do I need to know about . . . well, SI?”
Her loom was centered in the middle of the solar as it always had been, stark lines fractured by the sun.  She sat at the center of a mat, resplendent in her signature heliotrope linen, fingers whipping the curls of wool into whatever it was today.  Vermilion dyed wool edged in saffron, almost finished.
“Well, there is this Godiva gift set I’ve seen.  Everyone can use more chocolate.  I’ll have to wait until he’s awake though, or it will be eaten by my pet bird.”  She tried smiling at him, but stopped at the look on his face.  “What about you?”
“And the more people cling to an idea, the more extreme it gets.  The more it is challenged, the lengths people will go to defend it will get longer.  The less amenable they become to compromise.  The less willing they are to explaining things.  Yes, I am talking about myself here.  A bit.”
He has no feelings.  He can’t feel pain.  There’s nothing screaming in agony in his head, there’s no drowning emptiness and isolation.
“Did you get donuts without us?  You bitches,” Tony yelped, his ironclad grip preventing Steve from moving away from his tight embrace.
He looked up from the three data screens he was trying to read at once and muttered distractedly, “Yeah.”
The fresco depicted the most famous scene from the Hydric War – Steve’s defeat of the Schmidtican Hydra.  People said it captured perfectly Steve’s resistance to give in, as well as his peculiar fighting style – distinctive shield held out like it was the weapon, not the sword or spear.
It’s not a new feeling for today. He’s felt it many times, though never sees anything.  There isn’t much in terms of animal life this deep in the mountains, and the stuff that is here is likely hibernating.  But solitude makes people see things, hear things.  He’s familiar with his mind playing with him, when he’s alone and doubting.
Stark’s face was still, too peaceful for sleeping.  Steve ran a hand over the chest plate.  The glowing circle had burned out.
“Trust me, this is fine,” Tony says, rubbing his hands over his upper arms to stimulate circulation. “This isn’t anywhere near the worst cold I’ve seen.”  He had woken with his head coverings, remaining mitten, over and undercoat gone, but his thermal pants, shirt, and snow boots are more than enough to keep him thawed.  Before they left Zoloto's chamber, Tony had removed his gauntlet and had left it with the rest of the armor, because he can't really afford not to trust Zoloto.  She could probably eat him in several bites.  He still finds he misses the warmth of  the gauntlet, and the security it gives him.  It will take some time from his hands to adjust, but he’s certain they will.
“Your father’s whoring ceased bothering me years ago.”  She cursed quietly, and turned back to unpick the most recent row of stitches.  “Honestly, the only time I even remotely found him kind or considerate was the night we made you.  I had made the pilgrimage to Kaisariani, to ask Aphrodite's blessing for a child.  I said I only needed one, then I would be content."  She gave him an indulgent smile.  "I returned home late at night to find him waiting for me.  He seemed to have trouble walking, and was running a fever, but spoke to me with such words of kindness.”
She led him over to the corner, where in a tiny alcove set into the wall was her shrine to Hera.  A small terracotta statue, painted ivory and gold, with a small oil lamp lit next to a bundle of dried lavender.  She lit the lamp and shucked a few petals into the flame, the calming scent he always associated with her wafting into his nose and doing more to stop his headache than any other remedy.
Shapanka seemed to consider it. “Mmm, nice offer, Captain, but my, what will you use as your shield?” The man laughed, sending icy tendrils up Tony’s back. “Out of my way, fool! You’re so used to being on ice? Well, back you will go!”
Steve stared at Tony all night, wishing he was younger and less broken.  A young man with no baggage, and a heart ready to devote to someone entirely.  Not a battle hardened young-old man, who had lost everything.
Long story short, Tony had become a hero, the likes of which hadn’t been seen since the Trojan War en masse.  The only other heroes to come out of the generations that had passed since had been two leaders who had together pretty much single-handedly (or dual handedly?) won the Hydric War: Karnis of Thebes, the marvelous lady captain of their army and the daughter of Kalliope, and Stephanos of Athens, the King of Korkyra.
Tony cleared the mounds of paperwork from his desk without a second glance. He’d get to them eventually, he mused, and besides, there were more important things to deal with, weren’t there? Like the fate of the world? He plunked his attaché case down in the middle of the desk.
“Against drunkenness.”  He laughs hysterically.  They have to give him something so he doesn’t have a nervous fit at the funeral.
Along the way, Steve kept a running commentary, telling Tony more than could ever care to know about the seasons and the agriculture.  But Steve also asked about how things were in Athens, and in other places on the mainland.  He heard reports and got letters, of course, but it wasn’t often anyone who was involved in the finer politics of the mainland visited.  Tony told him as much as he could, about kings and princes and tyrants.  Largely, things were calm, nothing major, but Tony remarked on how bored people seemed.  He confided his worries that war would break out, and he wouldn’t be in Athens to help.
They moved on to a look at another of those creepy white plaster casts of people, this one of a man cutting camo cloth.  Steve was complaining about how women made up a huge part of the war industry but weren’t allowed to do certain jobs, like run the fucking fabric cutter, and Tony was laughing about the simple humor that parachutes had been manufactured by a company called Fashion Frocks, when a nervous-looking woman in her mid-fifties with a teenage boy trailing behind her interrupted them.
The dust wasn’t clearing. No, the dust had fallen, but smoke was rising from the engine compartment. The heat was spreading, and the crack of fire on metal sounded.
Even beloved fathers had the fear of being ousted by sons.  That paradox in their society, with the strive to have strong son to inherit bringing that fear of the son becoming greater than the father, was a plague they would probably never eradicate.
“Nah, but there's no good in wondering.  We're us. We’re both pains in each other’s asses, but it keeps us in check. Part of the reason we’re both terrible and perfect together. You being a stubborn ass is part of why I love you.”
“Just go with it,” Clint had mouthed over the top of the son’s head as he showed him the A+ spelling tests he has missed.
When Tony had made it to the docks, he had found them man waiting by the mooring lines.  He’d introduced himself simply as Fury.  He held allegiance with . . . no one, really.  Tony could remember the man speaking with Howard and Peggy at feasts, but he was not a regular feature of the court.  He didn’t seem to belong anywhere, roving from city to city and court to court.  So the information that the man worked, at least, in conjunction with Steve was more than he’d ever had before.
“Um. Maybe.”  He unceremoniously shoves the pile of wire away, turns to stand, and hits is foot on a 33 1/3 RPM turntable.  Swearing, he picks it up and gently places it on the pile of wire.
The rest of the team has been acting . . . oddly. There’s a lot of whispering and giggling and glancing over their shoulders at the pair of them.  Tony has heard whispers of a betting pool, and “making sure Mom and Dad stay together for more than the sake of the children.”  He doesn’t know what to make of it.
“Let’s see . . . am I going to keep the cheap-ass burner phone from 2004 that is, frankly, an unencrypted security nightmare and is a gargantuan pain in the ass to charge?  Yes, I’m going to keep the phone.”
When they were done with the meeting (about nothing, really, why was his presence so important?), the group of reps headed towards the ice cream parlor off the rotunda.
“Ah, but you will never see it, now will you?” Zemo gestures wildly with his sword.  “You will die, and most of your friends will die, and I will fly from this place on the back of my very own dragon mount!”
Despite everything, there still stood an age difference of ten or seventy-six years, depending on your calculation.
” accompanied by champagne poppers and tinny speakers playing “Born in the USA”.  Tony opened his eyes only to be hit in the face with a flag.  Laughing, Steve pulled it off their heads only to reveal Sam and Clint doing some elaborate war dance while waving smaller flags and Bucky fired off more poppers.
“Maybe I can help you with that?” Tony nodded at his erection, and before he could even blink, Tony was on his knees in front of him, nuzzling gently, looking at him with slitted eyes.
“Delivery,” Tony announced, muffled by the wall of cloth as he finally navigated his way into the second guest room.  He heard a deep, warm chuckle and the weight left his arms.
Eventually, they were all squashed together at the table, Tony stuck between Steve and Clint.  It should have been gross, with tiny bits of pancake flying out of people’s (read: Clint’s) mouths, but everyone was in such a good mood, Tony didn’t really care.  They were going to set up for a cookout that would start later in the afternoon, but aside from that it was just a lazy day.  Bucky was complaining bitterly over the fact that they couldn’t get drunk today (just in case they needed to respond to some idiot setting off a stray illegal firework that might burn down the forest), but everyone just ignored him.
“I was getting to that.  When I first came here, I was . . . coming out of a difficult situation, you could say.  Steve encouraged me to rest, then after a while we began training exercises.  Teamwork sorts of things.  Then when Clint arrived, we adapted so he felt included.  Same when Sam arrived.  Bruce isn’t one much for more militaristic training, but we’ve included him on everything else, because his . . . other half needs to be comfortable with us.  We’ve tried it a few times with the other guy, and it seems to work.”
“Oh, you are.  Absolutely.  We’ve made some modifications to the uniform.  I had a little design input.”
He ran a finger over the bindings of the books while the technicians adjusted the lighting.  They were all hollow wooden forms.  Not a page in sight aside from the producer’s notes.
Sorry this is so short, guys.  I've been having a terrible week (school, and a commenter has been giving me a hard time), and I kind of took my frustrations out on these two.  They'll be fine soon enough.  Next chapter.  Promise.
when I woke up.  Synthetic acrylics and warnings for cadmium.  It’s nuts.  The textures have changed, the whole industry has changed.  But you got me the old paints, the ones I remember seeing in the store windows and wanting.”
Always, but not enough to not be there when Steve wants him.  Nothing Steve wants from him can wait, because while the world spins on, Tony is trapped in place, because his world revolves around Steve now, and when did that happen, that wasn’t supposed to happen, but he knows why, and he’s powerless in its face.  The great Tony Stark, laid helpless by a love he couldn’t have.  “For you?  Nope.  Whatcha need?”
Someone raised their cup and called for a toast to the new King of Korkyra.  People howled and rushed to pour the wine down their gullets.  The honoree flushed and looked down at his own, untouched, kylix.
He has the arc reactor removed, so there is no piece of any mineral in his body that isn’t necessary.  He rebuilds the Stark Tower into the Avengers Tower, and has everything done up in steel and glass.  He encases himself in gold and titanium, pure, nothing remaining of the natural formations.
“Sure,” Steve settled into one of the couches in the media room.  He didn’t know why there was a separate media room, not when there were cinema-grade screens in pretty much everywhere, but here was the record player, and piles of albums that they had already listened to on the floor.
He gazed out of the cockpit window, out into the water.  He’d lived in those waters for nigh-on seventy years.  “Well, I hope I’m the man for the job.”
Tony jabbed the intercom. “Pep, get to safety! Don’t worry about me! Help is incoming!” He switched it off and ran for the attaché case.
The hall lead out into a back courtyard with an intricate swept mosaic floor with a stylized alpha.  Some exercise equipment and practice weapons were packed away neatly in a corner.  A low gate led into an orchard, filled with ancient trees behind the high walls.  It was early yet to harvest, but he could see the beginnings of apples and pears, pomegranates and figs.  A dirt patch near the gate probably served as a wrestling ring.  Outside the walls, a poppy-strewn field grew wild.
“Look, you’re sitting here, asking, I need a model.  You can take nap or whatever, I just want you permission before I start trying to capture your likeness.”
“Steve, don’t stress about it. You talk to whoever you need to, and we’ll take it from there, alright?”
He stopped sucking lightly on Steve's tongue, and moved to kiss his collarbones, and mouth at the hard planes of his chest through the flimsy material of his t-shirt, moving steadily down to where Steve's cock arched and strained for the warmth it seemed to know would soon envelop it.
, Tony. I’m so glad you decided to keep him active.” His expression turned wistful, before shifting to confusion. “But I’ve read that Iron Man was your bodyguard. Does that mean . . . ?”
“We called those A rations,” Steve cut off Clint before he could start rating about how unfair everything was.  “Fresh food.  Sometimes, you can’t find it, so for those times we carried canned or dehydrated food.  When I was at war, we called them C rats, or rations.”
“I’m still better off than you.  I know what’s wrong with me at least.  When you know the problem, then – then you can start to figure out what to do.  Then you can work on developing yourself.”
“It’s heavy,” Tony tried neutrally.  And it was.  While perfectly balanced, the shield seems like it would be impossible to maneuver in the heat of battle.  “How do you manage it?”
“A hero, like you?  You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.  Everything special about you came out of a bottle.”
.  When I came here, I left that world behind.  But here you are,” she snorted.  “Making me see those monsters as human.”  Natasha leaned over and dug through her implements for a bit of string, which she lifted to tie her scarlet hair back.  “I’ve fought both man and beast, and you know what?  Give me the beasts any day.”
She smiled, her eyes a little icy and the corners of her mouth tight.  “You’re not one for mornings, are you?”
“And the name Cincinnati.  It’s weird, yeah?  It comes from Latin.  A farmer, retired general, who was needed to lead the Romans to battle.  Cincinnatus was declared dictator, and led the army to victory.  Then he renounced his title and went back to the field.  When they make sculptures of George Washington in Classical dress, they almost always equate him with Cincinnatus.  He was a member of the Society of Cincinnati.  People who stepped up when their country need them, but afterwards went home.”
He had been wrong.  On the corkboard by the door, an assortment of colored pins had been stuck into the corner, pieces of construction paper still speared through and small bits of glitter clinging in the cracks of the wood.
He remembers seeing glass like this, in his childhood home and other places.  Grandmas coo over it.  This piece is more streamlined, simpler than the ribbed and ruffled edges and fancy engravings.
, but they were nice shades that matched the actual flag, more subtle than the bright colors he usually saw in official merchandise.  The packaging also declared that there were tiny white star applications.
Steve visibly deflates, stares up at the sky for a moment, before looking down and examining a knot in the wood.  “Who else knows?”
Korkyra stood, brushing her tunic of invisible dirt.  “We cannot tell you how to accomplish this task, as you would not have truly completed this challenge on your own.”
“Thanks, Pep.”  He pulled her into a hug, sniffing softly.  Even since things started with Steve, he’s seen the biggest weight come off her shoulders.  She didn’t have to worry nearly as much anymore.  “Are you gonna give me away?”
Tony glanced over where Steve was getting kissed on the cheek by Peggy and clapped on the shoulders by the guy they called Dum-Dum.  He looked so happy.  “I would never.”
A few hours later, Tony was in his tux, Steve and the guys were going to cause an international incident in their uniforms, and Nat was killing it in a red gown with a slit up to her hip joint.  They all piled into the mini-van they had rented, and commenced squabbling over the best route to take.
Tony went immediately to the oversized coffee maker and got it going. Steve stopped at the fridge for the bacon and eggs, then set up shop in front of the stove. He pulled out two frying pans, then glanced shyly at Tony. “You want pancakes too?” Tony nodded, and Steve grabbed a third pan. “Grab me the mix, then?”
Tony's orgasm ripped through him like the Hulk on a rampage, flinging his limbs every which way. He yowled with it, a nearly inhuman sound, and his eyes flew open in shock and pleasure. He landed on his stomach, his limbs twitching, again and again, in aftershock. He gulped air, blinking furiously as he tried to figure out what the hell had just happened.
Steve let out a bitter little laugh. “I thank you for that. In truth, I have but two friends in all the world, Bucky, who is also captain of my Guard, and his second in command, Samuel. I am certain Bucky would not touch me again, once I have a proper, mated Alpha, but if those two could live here with us, there is nothing of my homeland I would miss.”
The sweet fire burning along Tony's skin ignited in his belly, in his bones, and burst through him like a repulsor firing. The world went away, shot out through his cock and down Steve's throat, leaving nothing but colorless light and silent sound in its place.
, and there was one quick and easy way to do that. His hands wanted to be there, on Tony's hips, anyway, and from the way Tony's eyes lost focus, his hips wanted hands there too. “So, then, we agree. We're together because of who we are outside of the suits. I'm good with that. Go get plates.” He put a little bit of an order into the last part, and was pleased to see Tony obey without thought. Like a magic charm, the smell of bacon summoned the rest of the team, and Steve felt something settle in his chest. His family was gathered, enjoying his food, and he was about to move in with his lover. Life was good, and he couldn't help grinning madly at Tony, who grinned just as madly back.
Tony looped his arm around Steve's. “That's alright, I have to get ready for work anyway. C'mon, I'll clear out a couple of dresser drawers for you.”
Tony's lips closing over the chopsticks was blatantly pornographic. “Seems appropriate for this weekend then. Now I'll have to come up with even more firsts for you to be fond of.” He was delighted that, even thought he blushed, Steve gave him a pornographic grin in response.
dudgeon, anyway? Bet JARVIS could find out...), so he bottled up all of his happy before the elevator doors opened, and stormed through the halls, barking questions and instructions at various minions, moving on to the next before any of them could answer. He had to admit, it was gratifying to watch them all scurry back and forth, trying to anticipate him or prove something to him.
Tony sagged back. “Oh, thank god you saw it too. Like, taking aim directly at you and me, right? With the 'merging of innovation and artistic blah blah blah' and the 'Post-War changes to Our Fair City', and
Duchess Maria clucked sympathetically. “I’m sure he is.” She turned to address the young man directly. “Now, Steven, I’m sure the alphas want to posture and bluster, but you surely want to refresh yourself after the long journey. Shall I show you to the rooms we have prepared for you?”
, he let his eyes close and his head fall back, trying to adjust to... everything. After a moment, the need to squirm overpowered everything else, and he gave in to it. Steve gasped, and his hands flew up to clasp Tony's hips. Tony snapped his head down to look at Steve. “OK? Are you? Is this?” Wow, he could hardly form words...
Oh, GOD! The tight heat shot straight from his finger to his jock, and Steve nearly went off right then. He had to hold
Clint, for instance, turned out to be an excellent cook, knowledgeable about nearly every major cuisine Tony could name, but usually just experimenting with whatever they had on hand, and making it delicious every time. Steve had a good grasp of the basics of cooking, the cheap-and-filling stuff from the Depression and the War, and Clint was teaching him the fancier and more complicated types. He would usually intersperse those instructions with lessons on history or geography or current events. Sometimes, if Bruce had wandered up from the labs, he would chip in a hand or a factoid. It was friendly and cheery and tasty, and Steve always looked so proud when the rest of them praised a new recipe.
Bruce, on the other hand, could be counted on to be dignified. “Well, I for one say congratulations. You both deserve happiness, and if you're finding it together I couldn't be happier for you.”
He couldn't help laughing at that. “God, no. I feel like I'm more alive than I've ever been!” He cleared his throat, trying to maintain focus on Pepper. “And it's only a little favor, just part of your day.  I just want you to get me a press conference. No rush, actually, what's today, the 28th? You got a couple weeks, then. I'm aiming for Thursday the 11th, maybe late morning? Nothing to do with the company, totally a personal thing, but you know how I hate arranging these things myself, especially when you're so much better at them anyway.” He had too much energy to sit still, he had to get up and pace.
“You too, Steve. Oh, and Steve?” She gave him a fond look. “If he breaks your heart, let me know, I'll help you plot his painful demise.” They were laughing together as she closed the call.
She raised one eyebrow. “Don't even try. He came in this morning looking like he should have cute fuzzy woodland creatures frolicking around him, and JARVIS says you spent last night with him. So, what are your intentions? I should tell you that if you break his heart, I will be obligated to bury you in several shallow graves.” She looked at him expectantly.
Oh, God, he was so wrong. He cared desperately about having an orgasm, but it wasn't- he couldn't- he needed words... words... “Please, oh, God, please Captain, please, I need to, please will you...”
Steve was wrung out, pliable, almost dazed, by the time Tony steered him out the doors (he didn't even notice the sculpture garden!) and hailed them a cab. He sagged back in the seat as Tony gave the cabbie an address, then blinked and seemed to come back to himself. “I... Wow. That was... There's been so much...” He stroked the cover of the sketchbook.
And, of course, Steve would need the very best in medical care, from now at least until the birthing, but if they all got successfully to that point, it was likely that Steve could bear other children, and those would be Tony’s by blood, and then he really would have a family. And he would not deny this child the chance to know their other blood parent, though he might be called uncle rather than father.
When Tony finished cleaning his jock, he kissed it, and Steve felt a glow in his chest. He had to try... “Good pet.” More tension drained out of Tony, and Steve found he could barely keep his eyes open. “Sleep now?” He had just enough energy to wrap an arm around Tony and pull him close, before sleep pulled him under.
God, he loved making her blush. “You're pretty amazing yourself, Tony. Take care of yourself, ok?” He laughed again as she closed the call.
Tony forced himself to break away again. “Steve. I want to.... Oooh, I promise I want to be a gentleman, and take you out to a restaurant where they'll make us wear ties, but right now I need... Oh, I need you.... Please... Bed. Bedroom. Can we-”
It had the desired effect; Tony laughed and relaxed against him. “If she does, I'll fire her for being a jealous bitch. Honestly, though. Please stay. This... this is really good.” He paused thoughtfully. “Well, ok, there is one way it could be better. Stay put.” He got up, and Steve lay back, happy to drift as Tony splashed about in the washroom. He was going to have to prove to Tony that he wasn't going anywhere, but perversely he thought tying him to the bed might just do it. Oh, there was a pleasant thought, Tony naked, splayed and vulnerable... Tony returned, bearing a washcloth with which he cleaned Steve up. Oh, wow, was he already falling into that role? Oh, this was going to be good...
Good option two, the one Tony hardly dared even hope for, was that Steve might actually be interested in a real, actual relationship with him, Tony, Stark the Fuckup. Of course, Tony being Tony, he knew that he'd end up screwing it up somewhere down the line, but maybe, just maybe, Steve might give him half a chance first. And Steve did seem like the kind of guy who would try to be friends with his exes, so once it didn't work out they could probably go back to what they had now, right? Then again, if he really spectacularly fucked it up with Steve, that would probably fuck his relationships with the rest of the team, too, and all of that was far too valuable to risk just to fulfill his stupid adolescent crush. Suppress and deny, that was the Stark way, and he could practice it with the best of them. Don't upset the applecart, that was best.
Tony lunged, his mouth coming up to crash against Steve's, the glass dropping forgotten from his hand as his arms looped around Steve's neck. Steve grunted, in surprise or with Tony's weight, then wrapped his arms around Tony's waist and kissed him back. Like, wow, kissed him like Tony was his whole world, and Tony let himself get lost in it, in smooth lips and strong tongues and hungry moans. When oxygen finally became an issue, he pulled away just far enough to rest his forehead on Steve's shoulder and pant for breath.
Captain smiled at him and went back to petting his hair. “Good pet. Now, next step, I think you called it 'what you're looking for, and what your limits are.' I think, worst first? What are you absolutely
“Whoa.” Tony held up a hand. “I am not rejecting you, I pledge. I-” He looked down at his hands, twisting the fingers together. “I was wondering if I need make room amongst the servants or my gentlemen-in-waiting. I, I know this marriage is no more your choice than mine, I would make it easier on you if I could.”
When they hit the sidewalk again, Steve nudged him with his shoulder. “So when you say 'favorite,' what you actually mean is, one where they know you so well they tease you about bringing cute boys around.” Tony looked faintly embarrassed, but refrained from answering, except to nudge his shoulder back.
Tony beamed at him. “It's a date, then.” He schooled his face to seriousness. “We just have to remember to not treat it like a date, so the tabloids don't get wind of it. Dammit, Rogers, why can't I flaunt you?” Steve just laughed as he cut the connection.
Steve barely managed to finish the last two strokes before the orgasm overtook him, his yell as much shock as pleasure, his cum spurting across Tony's back. He caught himself with a hand to Tony's back, and just stayed like that, panting, for a long moment. Then he smoothed his hand up and down Tony's spine. “Oh,
, and it was so, so good. He was squirming, his cock rubbing, and the noises he was making had only a passing acquaintance with any human language, but right now he couldn't care.
Steve was trying to go slow, to make sure Tony was ready, but his jock was aching for the tight heat his fingers were exploring, and he decided he didn't really have
There was a small part of Steve that wanted to break out in delighted laughter at the ridiculous little dance Tony was doing, but the rest of him was miserable. It was as bad as he'd feared. He would be another notch on Tony's bedpost, maybe a few pages or a chapter in Tony's eventual memoirs; worst case, Tony really would push him on people, expect him to jump into bed with them, just to prove something. He summoned a smile. “Well, I'm glad you're pleased with yourself.”
Stephen shook his head. “Unlikely, but yet on the list of possibilities I will investigate. Stark, I will contact you as soon as I may.” He waved his arms again, making a portal, and disappeared through it.
Duchess Maria squeezed his arm gently. “Well, your pretty manners will help, I’m sure. Now, through that door there is a bathing chamber, and I made sure a bath would be drawn and waiting for you. Would you like me to send up a servant to help, or do you prefer the solitude?”
Tony was actually genuinely embarrassed, and let it show. “Oh, geeze, sorry. It's Monday evening here, I forgot to check where you even are. I'll make this quick, let you get back to sleep.”
But that spark was fragile, and they'd hardly talked about things, and Steve's mind kept flashing back to that moment last night when Tony had crowed about 'Captain America's virginity', and what if he was just doing this for the novelty of going with a superhero? What if the novelty wore off, and he got bored? Steve didn't think he could live with that. No, that was ridiculous. Wasn't it? “So, ah... I'm not sure exactly how to ask this...” But apparently he was going to.
Oh, god, now he had to define it? Why hadn't he planned for this part? “It's someone who, you know... goes with, um, sleeps with, both men and women.” Good enough, right? Oh, wow, and now Thor was saying... Wow. OK. So, nobody was taking things particularly badly. Bruce was calm, as usual, and Clint was a bit spastic, nothing new there, and nobody was freaking out. More than that, more than just supporting him from the sidelines, they'd come out to each other. They were all being more honest with each other. And Tony was staring at him. Oh, god, Tony was staring...
Tony lurked near the toaster, sipping at his coffee and casting long-suffering looks at Steve, who just looked evenly back. When the toast popped, he tossed it on a plate and came over to sit next to Steve. He took a single bite of toast, then set it back down and leaned toward Steve a bit. “I've been thinking about something. And you're totally welcome to have a say, but I'm thinking it's probably better if we don't tell the wider world about, you know,
Tony scrubbed his face with his free hand. “No. I mean, yeah, but it's fine. Was there something you needed?”
Tony waved his hand impatiently, and the screen popped up with Nat's face. “Hey, Tony, Steve. Good news for you boys. Bruce found some science symposium at MIT this weekend, and apparently Dr. Foster is going to be there too, so Thor went with. Clint and I found a 48-hour film festival in Chelsea, so you two have the place to yourselves. Enjoy, try not to break too much furniture!” The image cut out.
Steve stifled a yelp as he spun to face the presence that had been behind him. “My Lord Anthony!” He pressed a hand to his heart. “You startled me! Ah, yes, of course, anything you wish, sir.” He reached out as if to take Tony’s hand, but pulled back before he could complete the motion. “This way.” He slipped through the crowd like a fish through water, and Tony hung back a step or two just to admire his intended’s grace. Steve stopped in front of two serious-looking men in Brooklynn livery standing stiffly near the wall, and threw a nervous smile all around. “Duke Anthony, this is Captain James Barnes and Sergeant Samuel Wilson. Bucky, Sam, this is Tony, my husband to be.” Both men bowed and murmured a greeting.
Tony shrugged. “Will be claimed as mine, but whether it lives or dies will be in the hands of the Gods, not this mortal ruffian.”
Tony made that same high, sweet sound he'd made the first night, the one that meant Steve had hit just the right spot, and so Steve kept that angle, sliding so easily in and out of him, thrusting a little slower, just to draw it out, drinking in those cries, but in only a few strokes, the sound spiraled up into a shriek as every muscle in Tony's body clenched with his orgasm. True to his word, Steve kept going (as much as he could) through it, and rode Tony down as he collapsed limply onto the mattress. Steve groaned, placed his hands on the mattress on either side of Tony's ribs, and kept pounding into him. He was starting to lose track of the world around him, nothing in his consciousness but the lust inside him and the body below him, the sweet pull and thrust of his jock...
“Oh, pet, I do like it when you beg.” He decided to alternate sensations, and to start with the one that seemed the most intimidating, so he picked up the carpet beater and positioned himself for a good swing. He gave two smacks on each ass cheek very lightly, one-two, one-two, aiming to spread them out a bit, then a second set with a bit more force, and a third set hard enough that Tony yelped and jumped. Then he set the implement down and rested his left hand on the small of Tony's back.
Nat was.... quieter. She tended to sit, close but out of the way, and watch everyone else. Half a dozen times now, Tony had been in the middle of arguing some point with Bruce or Clint, or describing a scene from a movie for Thor and Steve, and had looked over to see Nat just... observing. Not quite cataloging, not even taking mental notes, just... seeing them all, noticing how they were, alone and in combination. Of course, then she would drop the perfect single-line zinger, and the target, usually Clint, would react in fake shock and horror, and Nat would get the most wicked smirk.... Tony was coming up with all sorts of plans for pranks and tricks they could do together, and he was very pleased to think of her as an awesome sister. (But never anything beyond that. Much as he liked a dangerous redhead, this one might be just a little
Tony looked confused. “Never been with a guy?” Oh, God, was he going to have to explain? He could feel Tony pulling away. Oh, God, no... “Never been with
And then the four of them watched a very funny skit involving two college kids, Clint as a character named Tiny Terrible Timmy, and Nat wielding an oversized, inflatable frying pan called The Skillet of Skull-crushing. Afterward, Clint tried to explain how they'd made the whole thing up over the weekend, from prompts they were given when they arrived on Friday night, but clearly he'd been surviving on sugar and caffeine all weekend, so he wasn't entirely coherent.
Clint eyed Steve suspiciously, but launched into it anyway, as Nat shifted so he could sit up. “OK, so, this kid, Peter Pan, he decides that being a grown-up is for suckers, and he's not going to do it, so he runs away to this place called Neverland, where you never have to grow up, and then a bunch of other kids do the same thing, and they're all called the Lost Boys, and he's their leader. But he still kind of misses our world, so he comes back for visits and he, like, listens in at people's windows and shit, and he catches sight of this girl called Wendy, and he kinda falls for her. So he gets her and her brothers to come with him, back to Neverland, and there are all these fights with pirates, and the leader of the pirates is Captain Hook, which, they call him that cause he's only got one hand, cause Pan cut the other one off in a sword fight and fed it to a crocodile, and now the only thing Captain Hook is afraid of is the crocodile coming back and finishing him off. Oh, and the crocodile also ate a clock, one of the old-fashioned kind that ticks, and for some reason it's still working, so he can hear it coming and he can get away.” Clint blinked and looked around, and seemed embarrassed when he realized everyone was watching him raptly (well, Nat was smirking, but with her that could mean anything). “Um, anyway. So there's like fairies and mermaids and shit too, but the point is, the Lost Boys beat the pirates, and Wendy and John and Michael come back to our world, and there's shit about appreciating your parents and civilization. All heartwarming and shit.” He sat back and hunched in on himself a little. “So this is kinda the sequel to that, kinda. JARVIS, can we?” JARVIS obligingly dimmed the lights and started the movie.
They were too busy making out in the elevator to notice which floor JARVIS was taking them to until the doors opened on the communal living room, where the rest of the team was waiting, and immediately broke out into hoots and hollers at the show they were putting on. Tony grinned and flipped them off, but Steve kept moving, unwilling to engage with all the  teasing (at least at the moment), and carried Tony along with him.
with his brain splintering this way.) He tried to jerk his hips up for better hits, or down to get more friction where he most needed it, but Captain was
Steve cupped his cheek, turning his face back. “I would be happy to brag about you to whoever. I'm more than willing to tell people. What do
Tony must have known, since he pulled away (oh, wow, even that felt pretty amazing!) and got out of the rest of his clothes. He dug around in the bedside table, but before Steve could see what he'd gotten, he was back, climbing into Steve's lap, kissing him, pressing their jocks together... Steve felt like fireworks had gone off in his crotch, a live wire from Tony into him...
Acting on instinct, Tony wrapped his arms around Steve, pinning his hands between them and pressing Steve's face into his shoulder. Steve nuzzled in closer, and Tony stroked his hair, as soothingly as he could. “It's ok, you're safe, I'm fine, we're all good, just breathe...”
Tony's tone aimed for casual but ended up kind of dismissive. “Yeah, but not nearly as much as I used to.” Steve's frown deepened, and Tony's shoulders tightened. “Look, I've got it under control, and knowing you you'll notice if I don't, so can we not do this, please, Captain Grandma?”
Bruce sighed. “OK, why don’t you start by sitting down before you fall over? Have you gotten scanned by JARVIS?” He pushed Tony toward a stool.
Tony scowled and thumped his feet to the floor. “There’s really only one thing that makes sense, and that’s that statue I whanged into yesterday, when I made that mainframe explode. I was kinda too busy to think about it then, but didn’t the stupid thing move for a second?”
Tony moved closer, close enough to share body heat. “He's part of you, you know.” Well, at least he understood... “I mean, I get that you still think of yourself as the skinny kid from the projects, witness your shirt collection, but I've seen Erskine's notes. The things that make you Captain America were there already when he found you, the Serum just brought them out.” He wanted to protest all of it, but Tony's voice was hypnotic. “I mean, I'm not complaining that it also brought out muscles for days, and, you know, all that... stamina.” Tony's voice was also husky and tantalizing and deeply erotic. “But you're not just some meathead, and you're not an empty suit and a fancy Frisbee. You're smart, maybe smarter than any of us realize, you're a good leader, good with people. I mean, you're genuinely nice, and that never happens. Seriously, I know there are nice people out there, but they get within a mile of me, their inner asshole comes out, no one is nice around me, but you manage it, and I am truly impressed.” Steve wanted to smile, and cry, and hug him, all at once, but Tony pulled away a bit, looking unsettled. “I, um, almost feel like I should be asking if you're with me just because I remind you of my dad. Or because I'm absurdly wealthy. Or...”
They were both grunting and groaning and making little half sentences, all “pound my ass” and “so fucking tight”, and every noise drove Steve to new heights of arousal, new depths of desperation. He shifted his grip to Tony's shoulders, trying to pull him closer, then dragged his nails down his back. Tony yowled and clenched around him, thrusting back at him with equal need. That was enough to trigger his next orgasm, his thrusts turned to twitches and jerks for a minute or two. Now Tony's hole was so well lubricated that Steve started to worry he might slip out, and so he regained his grip on Tony's hips, which just gave him the leverage to shift their position around a little...
Steve's face lit up in a smile. “Honestly, that sounds pretty great to me. Um...” He turned shy. “I could, maybe... bring all my stuff upstairs? And we can have celebratory egg rolls?”
Tony pulled away with a slurp, and pushed himself to his feet. He saw a flash of worry, maybe even fear, cross Steve's face, but he unfastened his own jeans, dispensing with them, and Steve licked his lips as his eyes raked over Tony's suddenly-nude form. Tony bounced over to the bedside table and rummaged in the drawer, quickly finding what he was looking for. He went back to kissing Steve, straddling his thighs, the first skin-to-skin contact of their cocks making both of them gasp and thrust forward. Tony pushed at Steve's shoulders, still kissing him, and he obligingly shifted up and back on the bed, until he was half-propped on the pillows.
All the hesitancy was gone, leaving nothing but lethargic intent.  One kiss turned to ten turned to however many, making it just one long sequence of Steve and Tony, taking soft affection and taking their time.
Steve kept meaning to sit down, tell Tony they needed to talk, and find out just where they stood in terms of their new relationship, but they just sort of . . . fell into being together.
He had no issue with introducing Steve into his world, but he always somehow felt like he was intruding whenever Steve introduced him into his own.
“Oh, and Tony?” Peggy called.  He turned and for a second she stood tall, the steely glint in her eye sharper than any dagger and more than capable of killing any man.  “You asked how you would be in love.  You’d believe in them.  You’d give them everything.  You’d give your whole heart, because you aren’t capable of anything less.”
He fumed all the way back to the Tower, driving even more recklessly than usual.  He jabbed the button for the common floor too harshly, and was intent on storming to the kitchen to reheat some stew for himself.
small, and it worries Steve slightly, that all this love will crush the boy.  So much hope and expectation heaped upon him.
He kept his eyes on the flames.  “Before I left home, my mother told me something.  Something that happened before I was born.  Hera appeared to her, and . . . blessed me.  Which, that’s all good, but . . . there’s something else.”
But of course, if had learned anything in his time, it was that complacency when one hasn’t dotted their i’s and crossed their t’s was just asking for trouble.
“Whoa there. David Drakovich Kuznetsov was the human name my mother gave me.  But my true name is Dragotsennyy of the Stalimasshtab.”
Tony groaned.  “Is that even a question?”  And together, almost as one, they leapt into the water, ready to swim back to where they left their clothes.
Tony has just begun exploring possible specs for an auto-release function that would make sure any future armors can read him for phasing and will shed accordingly without being torn to shreds. It’s going to take some time.  He’s going to have to spend time measuring the physiological indicators of impending phasing.  Hell, he needs to spend some time exploring his dragon body.
Tony’s eyes were glassy from medication, but soft.  “Who wouldn’t want you?”  He shifted, rolling on his side even though they had instructed him not to, unaware of the rapidness of Steve’s heart.  “Sleep better knowing you’re watching me, Steve.”
Growing up in Athens, one didn’t see nature spirits all too often.  You might spy the occasional nymph out of the corner of your eye, and the rivers Kifisos and Ilisos were exceptionally cranky and aired their grievances with Howard frequently, but generally the more mortal activity going on, the less immortals wanted to reveal themselves.  In Tony’s experience, fields and forests were much better places to stumble across gods.
.  The only clothes he wore were a pair of sweatpants, the ones he had been wearing at lunch, but slung
I've decided to split the events of Iron Man and Iron Man II between chapters.  Just need to polish off the rest of that and I'll post Chapter 3.
“<Sometimes. My father brought a young woman up here many years ago, when I was very small.  She appears in the village on occasion.  She looks no different from forty years ago.>”
As far as hazing chores went, however, this wasn’t the worst.  Tony was bid to follow Natasha around the fields behind the palace, holding the pyxis for Natasha as she meticulously harvested the raw poison.  Opium production was a painstaking process that required patience, botanical knowledge, and a dab hand with a knife.  The previous afternoon, Natasha had made precise incisions into the ripe green poppy heads, careful not to breach the inner chambers containing the seeds, where the sticky white latex had dripped out.  Overnight, it had dried and hardened into a brownish resin, which Natasha was now carefully scraping off the sides of pods and depositing into the jar Tony held.  Poppies didn’t always bloom at once, so they encountered them in several different states: red and golden flowers in bud, bloom, and wilt, fleshy green pods, and those starting to yellow and dry.  Plenty of stalks had been relieved of their dried pods, put away into the storage baskets.
“I deserve that.”  A strange expression crosses Steve’s face.  It takes a moment for Tony to place it, because he’s never seen Steve so openly display the emotion before: guilt.  Empathy wells within Tony.  Not enough to give Steve a completely clean break, no, he deserves to be called out.  But Tony knows a thing or two about being harder on yourself than you will ever let any other person see.
“If you’d taken a horse, you wouldn’t have needed to walk.  You win?”  Tony pointed at the bag.  “Good.  Pepper’s pissed that you decided you needed to defend her honor, but she’s secretly appreciative.  Go tell the king the prince has arrived,” Rhodey ordered, and one of the slaves dropped his basket in eagerness to comply.  Rhodey dropped his voice.  “You okay, Tones?”
company. Steve was shockingly easy to talk to, if you put aside the awkward pauses and vague answers about Steve’s past, but then Tony wasn’t any better than when it came to skirting anywhere near Iron Man. But it wasn’t just that Steve was easy to talk to, but Tony found himself wanting to talk to him. He wanted to hear every one of Steve’s thoughts, he wanted to know if Steve agreed with him, he wanted to know if Steve thought he was doing the right thing.
“JARVIS, call Pepper,” Steve ordered, sliding over to Tony’s prone figure.  He gently hauled Tony over on his side and placed two fingers in his moth to hold it open.  Tony lethargically tried to lick Steve’s fingers, and he grit his teeth.
“I did do all of the heavy lifting.  Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu.  That was on you.”
Bucky, who had been hovering near the edge of the room, darted forward when Tony presented the last box with a flourish.  Steve only had time to see the red star emblazoned on the side before Bucky was tearing it open with trembling fingers.
He tried to hide it, but Steve was obviously pleased.  “As much as it means to me, I don’t want to cause issues with your company.   But can we get rid of all the clauses about fitness and sex and vacations?  And I don’t want your company.  I want
A particularly rough wave hit the boat, sending Tony tumbling into the starboard side, hitting the shroud with a harsh
He didn’t need to tell anyone that he often found it difficult to breathe now that there was nothing making it difficult.
Bucky was looking shifty.  Every few seconds, he would glance at the table covered in bottles of nail lacquer, then quickly glanced away.  Natasha noticed, too.
But while the island looked vaguely wild and lonely, it wasn’t vacant.  Shepherds with sheep and goats waved as the ship slid past, as did the farmer inspecting a small field of barley.  A solitary doe appraised them for a moment before slipping into the hills.
“Okay, I’ll buy that.  But, Tony,” if Fury had been a more approachable man he might have put a comforting hand on his shoulder, “you don’t know Steve.  He doesn’t get out there much, but he’s still very conscious of the fact that he was born to a supposedly virginal priestess of Asklepius who ended up having a son anyway.  He grew up lower than dirt in the city that you were born in the highest position.  Sure, all kings and tyrants love him, but he’s not stupid.  He keeps his distance; he keeps the mythical hold over them.  Were he to get involved in your petty politics, he’d quickly become just another king from a backwater island further away  than Aetolia, and the mythos of the grandest hero of the Hydric War would be lost.”
Tony is quiet for a moment, contemplating. There goes the vague hope he'd entertained of being united with his birth parents.  It was a wild dream, but he’s had those before.  But
Dinner the previous night had been out of the ordinary.  Normally, meals were served communally to the entire royal household, men and women together, usually in either the main hall or the kitchen yard when the weather was nice.  There were a few tables scattered around, bearing baskets and platters.  People sat on chairs or the swept stones, bowls on their knees.  Many people wandered about socializing, grazing as they went.  Tony sat on one of the low stone walls, observing, Bruce quietly keeping him company.
The look of absolute trust and adoration Steve gave him threatened to split Tony’s heart into a million tiny pieces.
“Thank you, Fury, if I do not see you before you depart tomorrow,” Steve declared, “for all you do, and for delivering Tony safely to us.  I am confident now that our ranks are flushed to the extent we need them.  If something arises, I am not worried of our chances.”
was a version of the clear gloss with sequins that Bucky loved so much, with white dots and red five-point stars.
Tony was blown back, limbs flailing and finding a sharp rock with the underside of his knee.  He came up coughing and spluttering, but markedly cooler than he had been.  He stumbled to his feet, and turned to face the river god in his path.
“You need someone who will be right there when you come out of the fog.  And, as much as I’d like to be, I
Steve smiles softly and nods, a little sad. Tony doesn’t think he is supposed to see the look on Steve’s face, but whatever.  “Zemo’s getting more technologically advanced.  Bad for us, but also good.  Because he’s still light years behind you.”  There’s a tiny bit of pride there, and something within Tony preens.
Natasha only called him Stark when she was ribbing him or concerned.  “I’m fine, I’m fine.  Don’t you worry about little old me.”
“I’m just in one of those moods, you know? The I-feel-like-shit-so-I-want-to-hurt-everyone-I-love mood.” And he freezes, because that’s too close, too close to the unspoken truth and not something he should have ever uttered in another person’s presence, and especially not in front of the man himself.
Cursing, Tony pulled back, massaging the knot at the base of his skull.  He was more than ready to be done with this journey.  Howard had given the ship’s captain orders to sail quickly and unostentatiously, which meant minimal stops at ports along the route and that Tony was not allowed to go into the cities and towns to take advantage of the local king’s hospitality.
“No one.  Ross tried to squeeze my balls for it, but I’m not that easy to crack.  Everyone doing well, settling in?”  There’s venom dripping from his words, but he really, really does not care at this point.  Steve hasn’t done anything which warrants sparing his feelings.  “Clint enjoying abandoning his family?  Wanda happy to be out of her straightjacket?  Bucky getting his time in the sun?”
Tony turned and looked into Steve’s eyes – simultaneously blue like summer skies and glacial ice – loving and trusting and Tony couldn't do this.  He couldn’t corrupt him or ruin him.  He choked out a sob.
, brooding) and being on the brink of throwing away all the work of the past few years. It’s always buzzing in the back of his head, that he can make all the thoughts and worries and pain go away with under a liter of liquid.
“Tony.” Steve is flushing and pink and smiling like he hasn’t in years. “There’s no point in you trying to do anything that’ll make me stay. I’m not going anywhere.” He reverently runs a palm down the side of Tony’s face, achingly tender. “You gave me a home.”
She stared at him for a while.  Tony wanted to squirm under her scrutiny.  “Well, you can make up for being rude by carrying my baskets for me.”
“Listen, I don’t care what backwater you guys are from, but I’m from Athens.  I’ve been wrestling since before I could walk,” Tony had to shout over their swearing.  Redwing cawed in agreement.
.  They’re just doing this to sell papers.  And if it takes dealing with them spreading untrue rumors about us, well, I can handle dealing with that if it’s what I have to go through to be with you.  I’d give anything to be with you.”
Tony lowers his head and perks up his antennae and frill for Steve to explore. Steve’s fingers are cautious and the look on his face is awed as he traces the lines of Tony’s snout, taps his scales, runs his fingers along the line of the antennae.  It’s intense and focused, and Tony is terrified, but he’s also terrified not to have Steve’s hands on him.
.  How can I go to a medium-sized city that has a reputation for being twenty years behind everywhere else?  For a conference on innovation, of all things.”
Parker Peak was Steve’s favorite mountain.  He’d taken Tony there on their first “date” that wasn’t them fleeing fire or sitting in a hospital.  While Tony didn’t care much for the hiking, he did love the views from the mountains.  The drive down from Camp Nelson was also a treat, winding leisurely through the giant sequoias, with bright sun beaming through the branches.  Steve rolled the windows of the truck down and they drove in peaceful silence, Tony sticking his head out of the window like a dog.
“What’ve I missed?” Tony asks as he circles the burning block, running scans to assess the structural integrity of the buildings. It quickly compiles with the scans Rhodey has already completed, isolating life forms and rating the damage.
.  Tony had appreciated the view enough from behind, but up front . . . well, Tony felt he should thank someone.  Anyone.  Everyone.  Men he knew spent hours and days working on their physiques would cry and curse the gods if they saw how perfectly sculpted this man was.  He was like a heroic statue, with all the blemishes ignored.  He was neatly groomed, hair shorter that Tony was used to seeing and a full, even beard a darker shade of golden brown than the hair up top.  Minimal body hair, enough to denote adulthood but not so much as it was disgusting.  The only thing that did not conform with traditional beauty was the massive member hanging between this muscular thighs, but with a rush of heat, Tony wondered how much he should consider what others thought beautiful.
Steve’s entire forehead had wrinkled quite thunderously at Tony’s mention of Howard, which made Tony think that maybe it was true that in Steve he would find another ally in his private war with his father.  But he seemed to decide that now wasn’t the time to get into it.  “It was, indeed.  Did you notice the islands at the mouth of the harbor?”  Steve gestured across the water, towards a small rock, bearing nothing more than a few trees.  “They say that one was the ship that was used to carry Odysseus back to Ithaka.  Poseidon was, of course, angry, so he turned the boat to stone.  Nothing has been built there, because we have been worried about his wrath, but I have wondered if it might be an appropriate place for a new temple.  The gods are fond of flattery, and our seafaring has only grown.  What do you think?”
, which might be odd to say of a bodyguard, but it was more difficult pretending it wasn’t true. Steve inspired Tony, and while he might not admit it aloud, he knew it intrinsically. Steve had a way of keeping Tony on track, if that was the way to put it, keeping Tony focused on what was real, what was important, what he needed to be doing. Steve would stand there and tell Tony he believed in him, and would remind him that Tony needed to be working on those problems only he could solve.
“Just don’t eat it all,” Steve scolded playfully as he pulled off his suit jacket and hung it by the door, and rolled up his sleeves around his bulging forearms.
“Hello, sweetheart.  Mission was boring.  Bucky and Sam listened to me, imagine that.  Missed you ignoring my orders.”  Steve tried for a smile.
There is no way any of the doors in the compound squeak, but something in the air that shifts, he guesses, and his door opens.  The footsteps are deliberately loud as they enter the room.  Tony’s back is to the doorway, but he can hear every shift, every step, every rustle.
“I’m a dragon.” Zoloto nods again.  He crumples, laughing hard enough to make his ribs hurt.  “Would you believe that’s not the weirdest thing that someone’s ever told me?”
“Cause we can find a bomb.  The CDC just sits there, and everyone knows.  It is the deadliest building in the world.  And by the time anyone could discover the outbreak, it would be too late.  Masses of people would die.  And AIM can just sit in their bunkers while the world turns to shit.”
"I think Loki's trying to wind us up.  This is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed.  We have orders, we should follow them.”  He looked slightly put out about it.
“What’s so bad that it warrants death?” Steve asked, rubbing a soothing hand down Tony’s right arm.  He rolled over, and sighed as Steve’s hands worked at the knots in his lower back.  He allowed himself a moment to revel in Steve’s more than capable hands before responding.
He ran a finger over the words on the back of the coin. It was a prayer, but it resonated with him. He imagines his mother whispering it in his ear as she coached him in his bedtime prayers, soft and smoky, with a hint of an accent.
He peeled around the final corner to get a perfect view of a man in a lab coat who had just abandoned a blowtorch for a pistol. He was exchanging gunfire with someone else further down the corridor. He recognized Happy’s hoarse shout and Steve’s raised voice.
Steve relinquished his hold on Shapanka and moved over to stand at Tony’s shoulder. “He told Iron Man and myself he was after your transistors.”
Steve’s fingers removed the fibula from his shoulder, and set to work undoing his belt.  “We need to swim.  Over there,” he pointed over at a small strip of cliffs, laced with a network of caves.
“So you're saying that the Hulk, the other guy, saved my life?  That's nice.  It's a nice sentiment.  Save it for what?”
Her eyes widened, looking completely shocked in a way Steve knew was totally fake.  “No, I’m speaking about our friend.  You two are best
Thratta went, raging along the corridor.  Maria looked worn, and Tony wanted to throw all the slaves his father bedded and then began to mistreat her into the ocean.
Steve thanked the woman, and after she left, spent a moment toying with the spiral of lemon rind on the rim of his glass. Tony swallowed maybe half the whiskey, made a face at the poor quality, then pulled his checkbook and pipe from the blazer pocket. He lit the pipe, flipped open the checkbook, and began to write.
Steve flinches as he rests his back against the wall. "These are the murders committed by that witch. At least, supposedly. I've looked at the bodies myself. And on all of those-," he points at the symbol drawn on his hand, "-this symbol had been left. The most recent one happened two weeks ago."
And yet, he can not bring himself to. Satan damn him but he can not. It isn't because Steve is just so bloody gorgeous, although he does admit he'd love to bed him if he weren't his captor. But he doesn't know what it is either.
Tony’s hair was disheveled, eyes brown and blown, Steve’s tip cushioned between his bright red lips. Steve‘s breath was knocked out of his lungs. If he wasn’t as experienced, he might have come at the sight.
"I was complaining about you," Tony says nonchalantly and Steve looks between them, eyebrows quirking.
"God I-I'm sorry," Steve whispered, realising that he might've literally gone too far. He almost started to move away, but Tony only held him close by his hip and gave him a silent nod to let him know that he was okay.
"Satan's Horn, you scared me," he breaths, clutching the sheets to his chest but falters when he sees the look on Steve's face.
Steve tugs him closer, brushing the skin of the delicious 'V' above his abdomen. "Whatever you do here. The only difference- it'll be at my place. For me exclusively."
His hand was now grasping the back of his neck, the other fisted into Steve's shirt. Steve let his hands slip under Tony's own, cool fingers meeting warm skin as they continued to move against each other.
He walks into the expensive suite, all with it's own mini - bar, a lounge, a pole and other things Steve hasn't bothered to check. It's a little too gaudy for Steve's taste but it is a strip club. Flashy is what it has to be.
"You want freedom," Steve comments, as if reading Tony's thoughts and walks over to place the bowl into the kitchen sink.
He pulls Steve close and kisses him, a strange fire bursting through his body at the contact. Steve, to his mild surprise doesn't pull back, instead, only slumps against him, as if all of the strings restraining him had been cut off. Tony let's his hands curl through Steve's hair, feeling the rush of blood and alcohol roar in his ears. He can taste the last of the rum on his lips and mint; freshness that sets his body humming.
Deep in their hearts, perhaps they both knew that there was something indescribable between them. Something more than raw attraction, but also
Sarah dabs her eyes, and turns to him, the smile returning to her face. Tony can see so much of Steve in her.
"I am looking for someone," the hunter finally admits. Something flickers across his features for a moment and then it is gone.
Tony looks at him questioningly, jaw set. He doesn't know if he wants to discuss this. It is easier to justify his choice of helping Steve if he pretended that he wasn't really a hunter. "I find that hard to believe."
A moment later, he opened his eyes, slowly sitting up. Tony was walking out of the bathroom, dabbing his lips with a towel, a shy glint in his eyes.
He's had days to prepare himself for the worst, to talk a bargain if he can. Because here, in the dusty cell, he is completely at Steven's mercy.
"Okay. Yes. Let's move in together," he says, finally breaking into a smile. He genuinely grins up at him, feeling adrenaline flood inside him.
Steven guides Tony to a small room leading off of the landing. A row of fire against the wall of the room, illuminates what looks like a mini infirmary. He gently sets Steven onto the tiny bed in the far corner, and checks his pulse. His breathing is ragged and Tony can feel him burning up against his skin.
Steve nods. "All the more reason for you to look into this. Someone is framing your church for these murders."
Tony's grin widens and he snuggles closer to Steve, lifting an arm to throw it around him but he pauses, hesitant.
“You’re doing good,” Steve praised, trying to remember why they were doing this in the first place. He was getting close to his release, feeling the orgasm curl in the base of his abdomen.
Steve laughs attractively, and Tony has to bite his lip again. Who would've thought he'd fall for his employer-of-sorts? Thirty minutes ago he had been on the brink of tears and now there was only one thing echoing in his mind.
The hunter stands up then, but not before pushing the plate towards Tony and placing the torch into one of the holders in the wall; and is gone.
He smells brilliant too, adding to his overall attractiveness and Steve feels himself growing hard with every movement of Tony's hips.
"This is so sweet of you," she says, smiling at him and Wow, Tony thinks, she's beautiful. There's something so gentle about the way she moves and holds herself. Effortlessly elegant and kind to the boot. Yeah, that is her.
"No," Steve said too fast, but hoped that Tony would ignore this, "I mean— Buck might be already seeing someone and I don't think he'd be willing, you know?"
"Did you not like it?" Tony asked, propping his head up on his arm. He was struggling to keep his eyes open but like they say, curiosity killed the cat.
The cell reeks of animal carcass, damp wood and terrifying unfamiliarity. Tony can hear the skittle of spiders across the walls, a welcome sound amidst the deafening silence.
The room dissolves into laughter again. Two hours pass by as they keep sharing stories and amaze a very confused Sarah who can barely keep up with all the boys talking over each other.
The next and last part is pure smut, I promise! (Updates next Thursday) Come talk to me on tumblr @starkrogerrs :P
Tony looks at him, shocked. For a horribly numbing moment he thinks Steve has double-crossed him. After everything they went through and last night-  he opens his mouth in question but Steve answers him before he says a word.
"I am. Also, your mom might become my favorite person ever. She's so nice, the house is so nice... I feel like staying here forever."
Steve let his hands slide down Tony's back and squeeze his hips, eliciting a soft moan from him. Steve loved the little noises that Tony made— soft moans and breathy whispers of his name.
Everything seems to be moving at the speed of lightning. Mere hours ago, he had been in Steve's embrace and now Steve is asking him to run away.
He eases Steven out of his already torn shirt. There are tiny cuts everywhere, a million paper cuts if you will, that probably hurt more than the actual wound itself.
Tony has never missed Jarvis, his familiar as much as he does at this moment. The looming darkness dulls against the ache of missed company.
Tony doesn't think twice, all second thoughts leaving his mind at once. His coven was unlike most black witch covens. They believed in treating humans with respect, helping them in dire situations. When he had been baptized to become a witch, he had also taken an oath as a healer to always save those in need, no matter the species. Torn as he was, about helping someone who was possibly a witch hunter, he had to help him.
"Tony Stark, would you like to officially go out with me?" Steve asks, finally settling against Tony’s chest and gazing into his eyes. He trails a finger down Tony's sides.
"I almost am. I'll tell them that you fled, I'll make up some excuse. I can hold them off. They cannot harm me," Steve says, handing Tony his clothes that he immediately shimmies into.
"Hey," Steve greets, holding his hand out for Tony, which he gratefully accepts and climbs up the stairs— right into Steve's arms.
sugar, let me make you feel good," he says softly, and Steve can feel Tony's hardness pressing against him as his own twitches in response.
Steve sits on Tony's left and Bucky across him, while Sam sits opposite to Steve. In between Bucky and Tony, sits Sarah, at the head of the table.
Steve's face falls. He'd wanted to see Giselle today; she was exceptionally attractive and often helped him forget everything that was on his mind. This was the one place he was allowed to have a favorite.
Tony lifts his head to gaze at the hunter. Icy blue eyes that seem almost green when reflecting the yellow flame, greet him.
"You should've never been a part of this," he adds, lifting Tony's chin with one finger. He looks alert all of a sudden, as if coming to a realisation. His words slur but his tone is fierce when he says, "I set you free, Tony. I am
"Just accept it and then give it to me, man," Sam mutters and Sarah shakes her head at him, but is clearly amused.
"Sweetheart, that's all sweet and stuff but... what if I say something incredibly stupid?" Tony whispers back, shaking his head.
Tony finally looked up at Steve then. There was so much trust and kindness in those eyes that Tony couldn't help himself.
Steve throws him an amused look, a subtle smile playing at his lips. "By all means, make yourself at home."
Tony can feel Steve's hardness press into his thigh, and god, he wants those awful tracks off of him. But Steve's busy writing love over Tony's other nipple now and there's little that is making sense to him at the moment.
Tony can feel the drop in temperature at the mention of Steve’s dad. He had died honorably in the war. "Steve's told me all about his childhood. He's all that he is today because of you," Tony says and means every word.
"I'll pay you double the amount that you get here," Steve says, voice almost guttural and Tony pulls back to stare at him with wide eyes. "You don't have to keep doing this."
This is like a dream come true. He'd pictured himself waking up next to Steve everyday, pictured coming home to him and melting in his arms after a long day. The prospect of them being together, of having a future together, is  enough to lock all anxiety away.
In one swift motion, Tony had pulled his pants and underwear to the ground. Not one comprehensive thought was running through Steve's head now, it was all white noise and a blur of colors. He was only aware of the dull throbbing down south and the intensity with which Tony was gazing at him. At his cock. The thought made his cock twitch a little.
"You're my best friend, Steve. You're one of the few people I trust and someone who's also experienced in this matter. Besides, I don't want to talk about this with anyone else unless I know for sure myself."
Steve felt his eyes flutter shut and he whimpered slowly. He loved getting his dick sucked, it was no secret, but having Tony do that to him took it to another level.
Despite the fact that relations between mortals (most hunters included) and witches have improved significantly over the last decade, Tony doesn't know if he should even consider helping his captor. His captor, a man of whom he knows so little.
He still doesn't trust the hunter much; although with the pact, chances of him betraying him are small.
Her eyes glaze over then, reminiscing. Tony reaches over and squeezes her hand, feeling sorry. He doesn't know where he gets the confidence from, but he knows it's the only thing to do.
Tony bit down on his lip as he gazed at Steve. Blue eyes sheltered by long eyelashes that curved towards the sharp nose and those soft, plump lips were just inviting as ever.
Tony nodded, eyes round. Something about the look that Tony was giving Steve was so powerful, a strong feeling swooped through his stomach. This was a weird situation. He desperately wanted to be with Tony, so it felt wrong to agree to do this. But Tony had himself requested his help. If Tony didn’t think it was weird, what reason did he have? He couldn’t let Tony know, he couldn’t let Tony try this with someone he didn’t trust.
Steve hummed in response, urging Tony to continue. He nuzzled his nose into Tony's neck, as his warm fingers skimmed down his thighs.
Tony can't fathom what Steve must have gone through. He had to witness his mother's murder at such a tender age and be on his own from then on. Tony himself lost his mother when he was ten, but he had his coven and father to turn to. Although the loss was irreplaceable, Tony was never alone.
"Tony, if you can hear me, know that I regret all of it. I've never admitted this to anybody, but if I could take it all back, I would.
Steve happened to glance down and notice that there was a slight stain there and on realising what it was, flushed a deep red.
He exhales deeply and presses the the door bell, hearing the muffled sound of it ringing somewhere in the house.
"This is it," Steve says, gesturing around the room vaguely before launching himself onto the bed, which rests in a corner of the tiny room.
The house is small, smaller than Tony is used to, at least. The walls are a faded blue, a striking contrast from the blinding white walls at his father's place. The furniture belongs in an era long before their birth, but there's a certain harmony in the way that the flowery tapestries hang in the drawing area, the lived in couches and the scraped, vintage tables. It isn't luxury living, but something tells Tony that this house never gets cold.
The room screams Steve. It's painted the same blue as the entire house. A tiny desk is crammed to one side, and the wall against which it rests is lined with sketches and art pieces, a couple of posters, Steve's high school team and some college paraphernalia.
The light is gone as quickly as it had come. He hears the crunch of feet on the stone floor and a soft click, as fire bursts into the room, flooding it warm amber.
He winces when the vein in his temple throbs slightly. All of the rum that he unceremoniously downed last night is finally taking affect.
Before Tony can complain, however, Steve slips in a finger, moving to lick the skin between Tony's shoulder blades. Tony buries his face into the mattress- there are so many things happening at once- only if to muffle the loud and drawn moan that tumbles from his mouth.
Steve breaks into a smile at that, eyes crinkling at the corners. He nods his head vigorously and only then does Tony take his hand off of his face.
The hunter glances at him irritably, a single muscle clenching in his jaw. They say nothing for a moment.
Steve leans over his back, pressing his dick against his thigh and continues to circle the hole, while sucking a spot behind his ear. He's such a slow tease, it's driving Tony insane.
They sat in unbearable silence for two entire minutes. Steve was beginning to feel the sweat trickle down his back. He hated how awkward it was. Fuck it.
Tony goes over his options. The only two options that swirl in his head over and over. He can either leave Steven to die and hope that the spell breaks once he does or he can help him heal and ask for freedom in exchange for his service.
"I love you too," Tony whispers against his lips, knowing that if Steve was by his side, he could face anything.
At least, that's what he tells himself every time the guards let him through the doors and into the bedazzling lights and amidst the dancers who are in varying degrees of undress.
Steve hesitates for a split second, but then starts moving slowly and Tony mewls, the friction already feeling a bit too much. Steve pecks his neck to soothe him and Tony's hands move to fist Steve's hair. Steve pushes again and his hands tighten around those gorgeous locks— an anchor to tether him.
He almost gasps when Steve's fingers suddenly ghost his hole, the sensation cold yet setting off a raging wildfire inside him.
Steve's almost done playing too, so he pulls his fingers out gently and Tony whimpers at the loss- a sound that makes Steve's entire body flush.
Sarah grins at that, "It was a nightmare to run on my income back then but it has always been Steve's home. I couldn't let it go. Not after... Joseph."
"I could stay and help you fight," he breathes, trying to shake off the cold feeling that's turning his stomach to concrete.
Tony couldn't believe what he'd just said but there he was and there Steve was, the words hanging between them.
Tony doesn't know what to say except thank her then. He is grateful, he really is but no one, except maybe Jarvis when he was in high-school, had ever packed anything for him. It's a gesture he's long forgotten and doesn't know how to react to.
"Let's go to my room," Tony said nonchalantly, extending his hand towards him. Steve blinked up at him, not quite understanding but took it nonetheless.
They stared at each other for a moment. Before Steve could say anything, however, Tony hopped off his lap and the former felt his heart snap in half.
Steve parts Tony's legs then, gripping him by his ass and dragging him close to his own core. Tony immediately wraps his legs around Steve's waist again, biting his lower lip.
Tony can still feel the ghost of Steve's lips in places that make him blush, still taste him on the tip of his tongue, still smell him in the sheets strewn around him.
Steve turned at this, eyebrows knitted. "You're right. I'm sorry for making this about me," he breathed in, sighing.
Once the laughter dies down, the room falls quiet for a while as everyone loses themselves in the food. Tony's not much into eating but he knows how to enjoy a good meal, and this one in particular is.
Tony tears his gaze away from the man then, the thought of escaping clouding his mind already. Adrenaline courses through him, heart beating wildly at his chest at the thought of freedom. At the thought of seeing familiar faces again. He almost grins as he reaches the main door and yanks it open.
His legs are long shafts of beautiful, bronze skin and Steve swears he has never seen a more beautiful man in a life.
Bucky follows suit and Steve offers some bread to Tony, which Tony gratefully accepts. Steve passes him the steak as well, making it less awkward for him.
Two days he had said nothing, and the hunter had merely taken his food away and not returned until the next night.
Steve's own eyes are a dark, dark blue and if Tony wasn't half blissed out, he would have kissed him again.
Steve pushes in gently, moving slowly so as to not hurt Tony, until he's finally all in. Tony's eyes roll inside his head and his toes curl as Steve's length fills him in, his walls already spasming to accommodate the man.
Steven looks up at him then, blue steel meeting warm brown and Tony has to look away when something spikes inside him, hot and strong. He frees his hand from Steven's grasp, as the latter looks on.
She returns a moment later, an apologetic look on her face. "Giselle's not here today, sir. Also, Rick and Hernandez are busy."
"Gorgeous," Tony drawls, as he drops onto Steve's lap, straddling him with his knees. Steve doesn't even have a moment to process it before Tony starts grinding against him.
A blonde head peeks in through the half ajar door a moment later and then swings open entirely, to reveal a smiling Steve, dressed in a casual white tee and jeans.
Before long, Steve was close to his climax again. Tony moved faster then, as Steve bucked up into his mouth and hit the back of his throat. Tony whimpered but Steve couldn’t apologise as his orgasm rocked through him just then. He saw starburst behind his eyes and moaned Tony’s name as he came into his best friend’s mouth.
Steve hasn't seen anything hotter and that's saying something, given the plethora of experience with someone as gorgeous as Giselle.
Steve's face visibly falls at that, and he lets go of hand and Tony suddenly feels cold all over. He turns away, not wanting to fall victim to the tricks his mind seems to be playing.
Another thrust. Tony bucked his hips against Steve in response, needing more of the friction as he burned around him.
"Oh yeah, that's good," Tony hums, hands now moving to run down Steve's front and then back up. Steve let's his head rest against the couch, relishing in that absolutely addicting feeling that's coursing through his blood.
There's promise in the way he smiles at him, a little dazed but with such surety that Tony can't help but believe him.
Having used most of his magic on the healing spell, he cannot even attempt to break the spell that surrounds the house. The spell, he realises, must be the work of a white witch.
A tiny cupboard stands beside the desk, chipped away at the edges and is old, much older than Steve.
Tony's eyes flutter open as he leans against the wall, panting. Three angry red lines still run down Steve's chest but the skin has stitched itself. The hunter's passed out but is fortunately alive.
Helping a witch hunter of all people would definitely be frowned upon by his coven. But his magic is still weak, (he had hoped it would return once he was awake, but to no avail) and he's not sure if he can force Steven to set him free. He has noticed the strange symbols on Steven's arm and back; symbols he doesn't recognise. Who knows what spells against witches his body is warded by.
Steve nodded. "Unzip me now," he half asked, voice hoarse and Tony complied. He sunk to the floor just as Steve moved to the very edge of the bed.
can’t believe it took me sucking your dick for you to confess,” Tony retorted, laughing as Steve swatted his arm, before snuggling into him once more.
Tony walks over to help him ease back into the bed, hand gripping his back. The gash across his front, although stitched, is still an angry red and the skin around it seems to be infected.
Steve wasn't particularly convinced, but Tony's tongue worked on the vein that throbbed on the underside of his cock and everything was forgotten. He tugged at Tony's hair again, needing the support as Tony's head bobbed up and down his length. Steve moaned long and slow as Tony sucked and blew alternatively; and he felt a familiar tug in the base of his abdomen.
"She was beautiful and kind.. and I was seven. Only seven and it was just us," he says, voice cracking and Tony does all but reach out to pat his shoulder.
"Earth to Rogers. You here, babe?" he asked again, turning around completely now so that their knees touched; hating that all the work that Steve had done on his body seemed to be disappearing.
Teeth clashed against teeth as their kiss became more heated, their breathing getting hotter and heavier. Steve couldn't really breathe but he didn't care. He was floating and the feeling was too good to pass up. He squirmed a little, in a vain attempt to... adjust himself. He was definitely hard and it would become a problem if he didn't stop but Tony was being fucking incredible.
Steve's dependent on him now, because he isn't fully healed yet. It is exactly what he had wanted; to ask Steve for freedom when he was most vulnerable. And yet, Tony finds himself straying from that very thought and showing Steve concern no hunter deserves.
"Steve?" he called. But the blond didn't reply, his fingers now caressing the dip of Tony's tailbone gently, where his gaze was also fixated.
It was a deep kiss, the kind that sent Steve reeling and left him yearning for more. Before he could respond, however, Tony kissed his jaw and then sunk to the floor before him —
“No, let’s finish this,” he said, determined, and maybe Steve was experienced but he was also an idiot, an idiot in love and he could formulate no response. Tony resumed his work, eyeing his cock almost hungrily, letting his tongue roll around him. It wasn’t the swiftest motion but Steve felt heat burn up his chest. He let his fingers curl through Tony’s hair and Tony moaned audibly at the sensation. Steve bit his lip, afraid he might give away too much of his feelings.
Steve screams in agony, reaching over to clutch Tony's arm. He flinches as his nails dig into his skin, but continues to spread the paste around. The blood flow has slowed down but if Tony doesn't act fast, he knows that it would kill him. The paste can only do so much.
They chased after each other for a while then, nipping and clawing and biting until— until Tony dragged his hand down Steve's front and right over the tent that had formed in his pants.
The spread on the table is lavish to say the least. Tony doesn't know half of what he is seeing but it smells so ravishing, he can't really wait to dive right in.
What Steve wasn't telling him was that he didn't really have a choice. It was either help or refuse and face certain death.
"I.. I regret everything I have ever done. Perhaps, ma would've hated me for choosing this path. F-for wanting to avenge her. But she was my mother and I was seven. It's no excuse but.. if it hadn't happened...I wouldn't be here. Nor would you," he says, voice raspy as if he's struggling to get the words out.
Steve blinks at him, making the tears spill faster than ever. "It was what I had planned. I would stop once I found the wretched bastard. But.. I-I promise.."
"I never thanked you for healing me. For agreeing to help me. I don't know why you did it, but- but I am grateful. And. And I am sorry. For making you go through all of this," Steve whispers against his lips, words tumbling over one another in his effort to be earnest.
Tony thought, as Steve licked the skin of his neck again. Tony's hands immediately went up to fist the soldier's hair.
"You okay?" Steve asks, voice tight and Tony merely nods, biting his tongue in an attempt to not cry.
For a moment, a sickening sense of pleasure rushes through Tony. He forgets that there is a dying man before him. The door of the cell, wide open and inviting, beckons to him. "
He finds Steve in the library, hunched over books as usual, after he had spent the entire day avoiding the hunter. The only thing that is odd about the sight is the bottle of rum and a half full glass beside him, on the table.
Steve was pumping at an incredible speed now, pulling Tony higher and higher, their grunts loud and filthy. This felt better than anything Tony had ever experienced and, for the very first time, felt right. His eyes squeezed shut, feeling aware of every inch of where their skin was connected in some way.
"Mrs. Rogers, I've got to say, I'm never going to like anything from the college cafeteria after this," he says, settling back into the chair, feeling drowsy all of a sudden.
"You don't have to give me an answer today. Just, think about it?" Steve asks, eyes round and pleading.
Tony then reaches behind Steve to produce a lipstick from God knows where. He holds his stare as he lets his fingernails scrunch up the fabric of Steve's expensive shirt before ripping it open, buttons flying askew. Steve has barely enough time to react, before Tony quickly writes ten digits in the flamboyant red on his skin and then jumps off his lap, just as the song in the background comes to an end.
"Promise me," Tony says, staring into those ocean eyes, "Promise me, that you'll stop once you've caught the killer."
Tony has no choice but to turn, and removes the pillow from under him, before backing up against the headboard. Through his now hazy vision, Tony can make out Steve's cock which is leaking with pre-cum. This is better than all of his fantasies combined.
"I didn't tell them, I swear. They must've put a spell on this place. I've told them to wait downstairs so I can fetch you."
"You healed me," Steven says raspily and moves to stand up. His wounds, although closed, must still hurt because he falls right back onto the bed with a loud groan.
"My magic doesn't work here," Tony finds himself saying, even though his obvious choice should be to rush out the dingy cell and never see it again.
"Get what?" he croaked as Steve bit down on the spot behind his ear while grinding against his butt.
Sarah shakes her head and gives his hand a squeeze. "Stevie's told me you're a pretty smart guy. Nothing's too big once you put your heart into it."
Steve smiles at her forcefully. He is still debating whether or not to go ahead with this at all, partly because he is slightly tipsy from the bar visit and partly because this was not a habit he wants to develop. But today he needs this.
Besides, Tony did want to catch the traitor. The witch had broken the very oath that made the coven different from the others and followed a path of its own. Broken the new rules that reigned over mortals and witches and encouraged them to be friends and not enemies. The high priest of their coven might not even be aware that such a thing had happened. And
"Why do-" Steve interrupts but Tony places a finger against his lips, silencing him. A tinge of red dusts Steve's cheeks but Tony's already slipping under the alcohol's influence and doesn't notice.
The hunter has given him access to the entire house but he is still bound, unable to contact his coven or his familiar or anything that is not Steve.
"I've never seen you around here," Steve says, his breath get heavier with the arousal. Tony is panting slightly too, and Steve has an overwhelming urge to kiss him but alas, rules are rules.
Steve eyes shoot open, pupils blowing wide with lust. Tony tries to make a comment but his throat tightens. He only tugs at Steve's pants and the latter leans away to swiftly shuck them to the floor. Tony watches his sprung cock hungrily, almost drooling and something comes over Steve as he hooks his fingers into that red, silken thong and tears it right off of him. The action makes Tony's dick twitch with arousal and he lets out a squeaky moan.
Tony stiffened at that, averting his eyes. "Well, there is something...it's what I actually came to you for."
Steve is huge, to say the least. Tony can feel tears brim at the corner of his eyes and for the second time today, he bites them back but this time it's because it feels so fucking good.
It’s prickly question. Or at least, is to Tony. Because what can he say? He didn’t want to be faced with the icon of righteousness while laid low? That staving off the liquor was better than facing a mad Cap? Or worse, disappointed? That all Tony really wants is to crawl into a bed that has been warmed by Steve? That in some twisted part of his mind, he thinks having Steve’s love will cure Tony?
“No.” The guards and Happy all stared at him in disbelief. Steve just raised his eyebrows. “Perhaps I should, but I won’t. Release him.”
Tony’s laughter crackled through the comm just as the dragon nearest him open his mouth and began to glow.  “
“Right,” he said, face burning with anger and humiliation – and rejection, as Steve now knew – and turned away, sealing the elevator behind him.
“That should do it,” Steve heard Bruce exclaim from over by the lab table.  “Only two viable specimens, but that’s what you need, yes?”
Tony rolled his eyes and offered Steve some of his maza.  “I don’t suppose you will tell me just who these mystery ladies who are sooooo important are?”
proposal, Rogers.  I deserve better than a dirty rooftop in the middle of the desert.  I want a night, no
She smiled pityingly, then jingled the kidskin she held in her hand.  The dancers, flute girls and cithara boys, awoke quickly and lined up to receive their pay.  Pepper tucked the scroll she was carrying under her arm and began doling out their pay for the night’s work.  Tony poured more wine into his cup.
In retrospect, it shouldn’t have been a surprise to see Pepper, Rhodey, and Bruce milling about with Steve’s friends in the backyard.
“- very special guest, Senator.   Here to defend Tony Stark’s position on the Avengers, Captain America himself!”
He’d heard the whispers at the few social events he’s attended, and rumors got around. People had complained of his “erratic” behavior since Vietnam, mainly consisting of his apparent refusal to sleep with anyone. It had initially encouraged many a lady, thinking the great Tony Stark was ready to settle down,
Rogers blanched, and his eyes darted upwards for a moment, the universal sign for listening.  “I’m not so sure I’m comfortable-“
Tony’s mouth had fallen open into a perfect little “O”, but he quickly snapped his mouth shut and stared over at the soup.  “So you
Steve stiffened, then rubbed his palms together unconsciously, like a phantom cold had overtaken him. “Yeah. He was involved in the . . . erm, testing that had my . . . program shut down.”
Steve knew that, if he were so bold, if he climbed into bed with him, Tony would sigh little contented noises and cuddle close into his arms.  He didn’t even want to
Everyone wanted to be there when he was introduced to Springsteen (except Thor, whose only taste in modern music was harsh rap, bubblegum pop, and ABBA), and Natasha had argued, but Bruce had eventually won the “privilege” of introducing him to a fellow Bruce.  He wasn’t much into popular music, but he had wanted to participate, and felt Steve would love Springsteen.  He was right, even if he had gotten tired of the chorus of “Born in the USA” being sung off-key every time he entered a room for the rest of the week.
“I’ve been trying to come up with the best chemical compound to describe us, and I figured it out,” he pulled the texting feature up on a tablet.  Steve sighed.  “Have you been taking lessons from Pepper?”

that looked perfect for keeping away morning chill without suffocating him in the heat.  The perfume was probably local, but perfume was expensive from anywhere.  Papyrus was outrageously expensive, but Steve had still given him some to write home with.  Even in Athens, he had to get Jarvis’ approval to take paper.
They were going through the traditional team banter, and after a few failed attempts at pulling Steve into the conversation, they gave up and accepted he was out of it.
Steve gave Tony the painkillers and a glass of water, also thinking to grab one of his numerous tablets and the stack of papers Pepper had left with SI letterhead.  Tony snatched the tablet but wrinkled his nose at the paperwork.
He sat on the damp floor with boxes and boxes of late Soviet-era birth and adoption documents, wearing multiple layers and still was cold.
The master strategist had figure the sleeping arrangement out: blanket cocoons beneath shared comforters.  Tony wasn’t going to complain.  Steve was like a furnace, so body heat would bleed over anyway.
“Well, we got my half done, now all we need is your half,” Tony continued, with a business-like air, but there was a wicked gleam in his eyes.
Steve sighs heavily, then speaks like he’d rehearsed it for hours trying to convince himself.  “The Avengers are your family – “
And unlike anyone else, afterwards, Tony could lay sated in Steve’s arms, the well-toned muscle surrounding him, making him feel safe.  And loved.
Steve curled his fingers, Tony whining as he tried to get more pressure on his prostate.  Steve purposefully only skated it, loving the twisting, desperateness leaking from him.
I figured out the hover boxes and updated everything!  In you're on your computer, hover over an italicized word for a definition.  Unfortunately, it doesn't work on mobile.  Take your complaints to ao3.
The paper trail is scant, and parts are obscured and destroyed, but Tony was able to follow the path. Anthony was the name given to him at the age of two weeks, when quietly adopted on Long Island.  His birth records were foraged, and there were no adoption papers.  He seemed to appear out of nowhere.  But that’s what Howard wanted.  A seamless transition from the real Stark heir to a child who would be able to at least partially fill the role.
He should go inside and try to sleep. If he can’t sleep, he should head down to his workshop. He should work on his backlog of paperwork. He should do something to take his mind off the siren call of alcohol.
She tells him that, if he really wanted to, he could be a wonderful partner, husband, father.  But with someone who can appreciate sitting with him as he does his genius thing, someone who can handle being put on hold so he can work on the suit, someone who’s willing to be there with him, just there, and can be happy without getting angry at his distractions.  She never could  accept not having his full, undivided attention.
Tony got up with a groan, complaining that he wasn’t a biologist, and neither was Bruce, so why the hell was he doing this?  Bruce followed in Tony’s slipstream, but not before trading a significant glance with Natasha.
“Just a minute,” Steve hadn’t stopped grinning since he had woken up.  He pulled the door open to admit a smiling Bucky.
“Not it!” Clint, Sam, and Natasha shouted at the same time.  Bucky swore.  Steve just rolled his eyes.
Tony sat in awe of the firm trust Steve placed it him. It was as gratifying as it was terrifying. “You really mean that, don’t you?”
Tony put up the faceplate with a tisking noise, mumbling to himself about "Idiot" and "Never a chance" and "Measure up" and "Captain
“Hey, man, she’s your kid.  I have zero know-how on dealing with those tiny demons.  But if you think that’s what she needs from you as a dad,” he shrugged, making the tower teeter dangerously, “it’s not a bad thing that you’re trying to be a good dad.”
Instead he focused on Steve, who had crouched down to greet the children crowding around, looking up at him in wonder.
He’d been sweating so long without a wash that the salt had run into the creases of this arms, legs, neck, and any gully formed by the armor, drying and crusting.  If he were poor, he would probably scrape it off and eat it.  Salt wasn’t cheap right now, as any shipments coming from the East or the South were stalled, as the exporters demanded twice the gold for a case of it than they had during the war.  Which was saying something, as salt prices during the war had been four times what they had ever been before.  The only shipments they were getting were from the North, and it would be some time before production had been increased to the amount that would be able to sufficiently supply the majority of the
