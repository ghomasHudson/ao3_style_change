The final round of flares from the six launchers they'd assembled took the place of the first ones, that had already sputtered out.
Tony seemed awed. He was completely in his element, excitedly darting from the morningstars to the shiny belt buckles, shuffling through all the notepads and the papers and the material left by whoever used the laboratory last.
He didn't remember much at all. He knew he had been stalking that antelope - and then Natasha had called his name? He had been turning to look at her when suddenly his insides felt like they were on fire.
anyways, hope y'all enjoy, make sure you're getting enough hugs a day - 4 for survival, 8 for maintenance and 12 for growth, did you know that? i'm clearly dead, then - and see you next time! lots of love,
Romanoff and Barnes had been making their way back to camp when they stumbled across Pietro Maximoff's body, stabbed to death with a knife. He had no signs of acid burns and the cause for his demise was just the weapon they found, and everyone realized the implications.
'Do you really want to know what I think?' James asked coldly, his right hand holding a knife, his metal hand clenched into a fist.
'No, not like that. I've read that from Earth, you can see stars in patterns called constellations. The ancient Greeks named them. They really are quite beautiful to look at. From space all you see is little blobs of light in the darkness.'
Tony sucked in a breath, unsure if he was just about to get hit with a blast of radiation, but instead a cool breeze wafted across his face.
'I'm fine,' he mumbled, rolling over and sitting up. Steve sighed in relief, which made Tony's traitorous heart jump, and he stood up, holding out a hand for him. Tony took it, reveling in the firmness of his grip, and he held on for a moment longer before dropping it and stepping aside.
Tony looked up from his work in the direction of whatever he'd heard. Bruce heard it too - yelling. Lots and lots of yelling. Then there was a thud, and someone screamed. 'What the hell is going on out there?' Betty demanded, and he shrugged. 'Wanna find out?' Tony asked her, already halfway down the ladder.
He stopped by one of the walls. Near the ceiling, there was a gap - a very small one, but a gap nonetheless - and he could see the night sky. The gap, however, was barely big enough to put his hand through.
He stared longingly at the boy for a few more minutes and was then shaken out of his daydream by a loud bang, and the spacecraft slowly began to move. The younger children on the Quinjet cried out while the older ones whooped as Fury wished them good luck.
All of Thor's poor decision-making, however, couldn't make him regret moving to the Helicarrier, even if it was plain, boring and designed to meet the bare minimum of its inhabitants' needs. It made up for its utter blandness by the people it held. Thor found them fascinating. He loved people. All sorts of people - from different cultures, different races, different backgrounds - they were all so absolutely gorgeous in their own way.
hello, my lovelies~ new chapter! lmao thor finally got mjolnir. i stressed a lot on mjolnir because mjolnir is a poor baby who deserves more respect and recognition, change my mind. the plotline is going off the tracks - i know none of this happened in the actual show BUT it's my story, even though i own neither marvel nor the 100, so i'll make it go off the tracks if i want to :) also i forgot about rumlow and just realized he existed maybe half an hour ago so i had to give him a dramatic moment, sorry not sorry~
Steve started. Tony was glancing at him from the corner of those chocolate-brown eyes, a small smile tugging at his lips. So he did notice Steve's ogling, apparently. Steve didn't say anything back. He didn't trust himself to.
Steve was interrupted by a cry of surprise. He turned to the source of the noise and Peter Parker was staring up at the sky.
Who would've known that his first kiss would have been the boy with the smart mouth and the chocolate-brown eyes, who he'd despised the first time they met?
The delinquents were prepared. They were scared, but they were ready for HYDRA. Bucky was prepping the gunners, telling them where to stand, when to shoot and reminding them of the signals they'd set up. Natasha and Clint were out of camp, on the lookout, ready to call Steve if they saw any sign of the Grounders.
i have nothing to say after that incredibly philosophical, deep, heart-jerking end note, so stay safe, see you tomorrow and lots of love,
'The bridge won't survive me, baby,' Tony said firmly, a glint in his eye, and walked backwards from them, giving them a mock salute.
'Prince Thor, Miss Foster.' T'Challa's voice was just as courteous as Thor's. 'You have come at the right time. We are planning to send a scouting party to the drop ship, to see if there are any survivors. Do you wish to come?'
Sure enough, he caught sight of the quick brown animal, darting through the leaves. 'It's there,' he whispered, and everyone looked where he was pointing. 'Woah, I've never seen one before,' Steve commented, and Bucky grinned at him. 'None of us have, Stevie, that's the whole point,' he snorted, and Clint and Tony snickered.
hey, darlings, new chapter! sorry it's so late, i was really caught up today. not much to say on this chapter. rumlow's back, and that's definitely a bad thing. loki's somehow keeping to his double-agent status quite well. hydra is finally getting off their ass and attacking the delinquents with biological warfare, as you do. bruce and thor are as soft and wholesome as always. people are bleeding from their eyes, noses and mouths and that's frankly quite horrifying but i'm sticking to the plot sooooo... deal with it, i guess, lmao
'It's fine,' the other person said in a breathless voice, straightening her shirt. She was way smaller than him, with long brown hair and pretty doe-like eyes, and when she smiled at him he felt his heart jump a little. 'I'm Thor Odinson,' he said, offering his hand. She shook it. 'I'm Jane. Jane Foster.'
'Well. I came here expecting to talk to you about what you should do for the winter but instead I'm going to have to come up with ideas to take down a terrorist organization adamant on destroying everyone except for themselves.'
'I really, really like you, Steve,' Tony told him sincerely, and he actually meant it, for once in his life.
Steve sighed. 'We're getting nowhere. Let's split up and look for a door, a hatch, anything. This doesn't look like a high-grade military base, it must be underground. Stay within shouting distance.'
'Guess what, bitches?' he announced to the room at large, and whoever was in the bunker - Bruce, Steve, Clint and Natasha - all looked at him.
No wonder he'd been thrown in jail. It had been a glorious scandal, and the news had a field day with that. His two best friends, Pepper and Rhodey, had tried their best to get him out, to work a plea deal, but there were no plea deals in SHIELD. Even for the brilliant son of SHIELD's best and foremost engineer.
She looked at him with sorrowful green eyes, holding her hand palm-up, and he silently gave her his knife.
'Wait, what's going on? What's happening?' he got out, completely taken by surprise. He received no answer. Instead he was forcefully shoved out the door and pushed down the hallway. Around him, he could see similar things happening to the other kids in the prison. Cells next to his and opposite were being opened up, their inhabitants thrown out.
He walked towards them, grabbing an energy bar from Peter on the way and a glass of water from a disgruntled Wade. They were talking quietly but when they saw Clint they all straightened up and plastered smiles on their faces.
Natasha exclaimed, both fury and disguised, but very much present, panic in her voice. She sprinted towards where Clint had vanished and turned in a circle, staring at the treetops, her gun already out and by the looks of it, safety switched off.
'Clear the area,' T'Challa instructed, after a moment of silence from the delinquents, 'and be careful while you're doing it.'
Bruce was currently tapping his fingers on the barricade of the lookout post when something flashed by at the corner of his vision.
'Nothing.' Steve sighed as Sam arched an eyebrow in disbelief. Sam was a good guy, and was incredible at giving advice and helping people work on their issues. He'd told Steve that in the Helicarrier he had been studying for a career in therapy. Steve decided he could talk to Sam.
The trail led all the way to the river - the same river which apparently wound all throughout the forest. They stopped and stared at the water, which lazily flew in the direction opposite to their camp.
'Tones, are you okay?' was the first question he had received, and he had stood up, pushing them all away.
Tony crouched in front of the worn metal and got to work on it. Two weeks of it being underground, exposed to dirt and insects and meddling creatures had not been beneficial in any way to the metal.
T'Challa, Nakia, Okoye and another boy Bruce knew as M'Baku were laughing together. Wanda was smiling at something Vision said, Peter Parker was excitedly talking to T'Challa's adopted sister Shuri, Rhodey, Pepper and Happy were all clustered around Tony and Bruce couldn't help but smile.
'Rogers is great,' Clint piped up, and much to everyone's surprise, Natasha nodded as well. 'Go ahead, Steve.'
'Fresh. Definitely Clint's.' Natasha was already moving ahead, one hand carrying the gun and the other holding Clint's bow.
the bastard. He was cocky, and annoying, and maybe a little bit of a chaotic dumbass, but he was still Tony - under that armor was a heart of gold and Steve was determined to see it. He knew Tony wasn't the arrogant dickhead they showed on the news, judging by the way he acted around Steve and the others.
'Okay, so I'm Valkyrie. I'm from Asgard, but then I managed to get a spot as a mechanic on the Helicarrier. I'm the one who tests spacesuits and goes on routine spacewalks along the side of the Helicarrier. Thing is, they think you're all dead.'
She took one look at him and gasped. 'Bruce! I didn't expect to see you here!' 'Hey, Betty,' Bruce said guiltily, as Betty Ross ran over to him and pulled him into a hug, much to his shock. Betty had been his partner when he had been experimenting with gamma radiation. She was incredibly clever and also made Bruce very nervous. He'd had a crush on her for ages, but he was too afraid to ask her out.
He blinked and shook his head, and then Bruce was back to his normal self. He adjusted his glasses self-consciously when he saw Clint looking at him and Clint turned away, instead choosing to focus on Natasha, who was right beside him. 'If the squirrel was... you know, like that... because of the nuclear radiation, then - then what's going to happen to us?' he whispered to her.
There was something so oddly naive yet so admirable in the way Steve carried himself, the way he stood up for himself and the way he viewed the world - and Tony found himself - god forbid - actually... kind of falling in love with Steve.
They had been furiously digging for just under a minute when Barnes' shovel hit something metal with a sharp clang. Everyone jumped and winced, waiting to hear the inevitable bang of the gunshot, but there was nothing.
'Personality, though... that could use some work,' Steve teased, suddenly getting a boost of confidence from goodness knows where, and Tony rolled his eyes.
'Get down!' she yelled at Barnes, who was standing at the bottom of the ladder. She ducked into the bunker, pulled the hatch on and closed it tight, breathing heavily and trying to ignore her itchy, burning arms and neck.
But he didn't remember getting tied up. He didn't remember getting gagged, and he definitely didn't remember passing out in a cave.
Tony didn't wait to see his reaction. He turned and sprinted, and he wasn't ashamed in the least for running away.
Valkyrie gave him a thoughtful glance as everyone began to scour the river, looking for the missing radio.
'We reached?' he asked, ignoring Tony's snickering and Natasha's amused gaze. Steve nodded and Clint turned to look at the view.
'Any new developments?' Steve asked casually, and Bruce stopped a few feet away, brushing off Betty who'd come to ask him something.
Thor frowned at the Stark boy, who was grinning at him. He could not tell if his words were the truth or merely a jibe.
'That won't matter at all, seeing as they already know,' Natasha replied, just as smoothly, lying through her teeth -  but he didn't need to know that.
Tony arched an eyebrow at Steve. 'Aight, who's going to check that out?' 'You two stay here and keep looking,' Romanoff told him. 'The rest of us will go to Thor. Also, pass some of the stuff you found. Some of us could go back to camp, distribute it and tell them about the whole Helicarrier-is-dying thing.'
'Yeah, well, it's not that great. I just dabbled in radiophysics, wasn't that much of an achievement. I'm more suited to nuclear physics,' he said timidly, tapping his fingers on his knees. His accident while researching gamma radiation was the worst thing that had happened to him, and although it was one of his greatest strong points, he hated talking about that period of his life.
woah, i wrote this chapter so fast i'm pretty sure there must be around a hundred mistakes in both grammar and spelling, and i'm too lazy to edit. oof. if there's anything wrong please tell me, i guess. also - steve's a certified self-sacrificial dumbass. but he's also a cinnamon roll, so i can't be mad at him, but still! ugh. i don't know why i do this to myself.
Immediately Clint hopped off the couch and ran to both of them, throwing his arms around them, cheering, much to Bruce's displeasure ('Clint, you're going to reopen that damn wound!')
She was kissing him, he was kissing her back with just as much intensity, and everything was alright in the world again.
And clearly almost a year in the jail cell had changed him more than he'd like to admit. He no longer joked around flippantly, no longer smiled at every opportunity he could, had frown lines on his face, almost constantly had bags under his eyes and generally looked like the delinquent they thought he was.
Loki scowled as Jane and Darcy began to giggle. He dusted himself off, straightened up and shot a haughty look at Thor, his chin tilted up, in an effort to regain his dignity.
Bruce and Betty quietly filed out of the room, Bruce looking on the verge of collapse, Betty half-supporting him. They shut the door behind them, leaving Clint and Darcy alone.
Wow, Clint, your plan is great. Run off in the wilderness with Thor and Bruce while the rest of your friends chill in bunkers safe from the outside world just as a storm that causes welts on your skin and possibly kills you appears! Absolutely flawless!
Jane had been right. The view from Earth was far more stunning than the view in space. It was jaw-dropping. Thor gazed up at the blanket of stars across the night sky, awestruck, as they twinkled and shone. He was lost in wonder.
'Oh, really? Because that poison was made up of water hemlock, belladonna, monkshood and a little bit of secretion from a poison dart frog. Nice touch.'
'Don't make any noise,' Tony whispered. 'I need to find the wires and I'll try to get them to work. Be careful, there's a ton of hydrazine here from the crash.'
He unconsciously rubbed at his face, trying not to dwell too much on his disaster of a love life. Thankfully, he was distracted when the device Tony was holding began to beep.
'You think they can see it?' Bucky asked him, back from a hunting party, judging by his sweaty disheveled look.
They walked for a bit, careful not to go too far away. Natasha speculated that the other human beings - the Grounders, the delinquents called them - were territorial, which was why they didn't attack until Clint and the others were deep into the jungle.
Steve, who had Clint's quiver slung across his shoulders, gave Tony a swift glance and then followed her. Tony tried not to think too much about that and went after Natasha.
Valkyrie insisted on coming, even though Bruce told her she had a concussion and she needed to rest or it wouldn't heal. She led the way into the forest to where the drop ship had landed.
Bruce worked hard not to show his surprise or make any noise which would give him away. Of course it was Loki.
hope y'all enjoyed, i know my posting schedule is wack but bear with me, see you next time and lots of love,
He didn't even mean to talk to Tony. He was in the Quinjet, claiming a corner of the ruined drop ship for himself because he didn't really like the outdoors, when Stark swaggered in, his ridiculous sunglasses still perched on his nose, and had immediately zeroed in on Bruce.
'Now do you fucking believe me?' he shouted angrily, staggering to his feet. His face was so bloody and covered in dirt Bruce could barely make out his mouth and eyes.
'I hope you will increase guard duty and be more vigilant. You're a good leader, Rogers. I have faith in you. We are all very proud of what you have accomplished on Earth by yourself,' Fury said seriously.
He gave her a small grin. 'Well, then. You two can come in now!' he called out to whoever was waiting in the main room of the bunker.
Whenever he went out on border patrol he found himself unconsciously looking for Loki. He didn't know why Loki had done what he did. He didn't think he wanted to know. It hurt way more than he would like to admit, but he tried to hide it as best as he could, even though now he was known as the guy with the murderous adopted brother.
'Why not? Are you afraid of having me as your boyfriend? Worried everyone's gonna talk that the great Steve Rogers is dating fuckboy billionaire Tony Stark?' Tony's voice was both hurt and pleading.
Steve slowly stopped twitching and shaking. His gasping became normal breathing and his eyes fluttered close.
'Well, then, I thought we could take it apart. See what's in there and go look for whatever it is because it helped Clint, didn't it? Whoever - or whatever - made it knew what they were doing.'
Rumlow went pale. 'I swear, I didn't do anything, you're just blaming me because I'm the most convenient to blame -'
'Hey,' Bruce greeted. 'We think we've figured out what's in this poultice. A poultice, essentially, is the direct application of the crude, fresh herb to the skin, usually to reduce the chance inflammatory or septic wounds. They've used all the regular herbs - chamomile, for antiseptic properties, crushed poppy heads, flaxseed, honey - we can get all that. There's some in this very bunker.'
Steve hissed in pain as they roughly pulled him along behind them. He could see kids around him fighting with the guards, crying and shouting, and their parents equally as crushed, but all of their efforts were in vain. He wondered if they would fight so hard if they knew where they were going.
'Hey, what the fuck? That's cheating!' she cried, following close on his heels. 'Do I look like I care?' he yelled back at her.
He's like my brother. If he - if anything happened to him, I don't know what I'd do. Back in the drop ship, I really thought it was the end for him, and I couldn't bear it, I really couldn't -'
'Brunnhilde, but you can call me Valkyrie,' the girl replied, her distrustful gaze sweeping the half-awake delinquents who were staggering out of their tents and the drop ship.
He wished he had his shield. He had recovered a shiny metal shield in the shape of a circle from Mount Weather. Clint had been derisive of his choice and, on the way back, tried to demonstrate how useless the object was by firing his assault rifle at it. The bullet didn't even leave a dent. Steve had been impressed, although Clint continued to mock him.
He was waiting there, his blue irises focused on the ground. When she closed the hatch with a thud he looked up.
Steve and the others shadowed Natasha as she carefully followed the animal tracks, which Steve could barely see, but if she did, who was he to say anything? She was frowning slightly as she went along, though, and the tracks got more clearer and clearer, even a few blood drops appearing. The animal was clearly injured.
'The very same. I assume you'll have to contact that blonde and tell her who's on the Council with her?' Loki questioned.
'This place really is beautiful, y'know. What do you think would've happened if there never had been a nuclear war?' Bucky asked him, looking up at the trees around them. 'Life would've been so much better, Buck. Could you imagine it? Being free. Being able to run away, put miles of distance between yourself and other people and still have miles to discover,' Steve replied thoughtfully.
The heart of Mount Weather, or so it was called, was not bare like the other buildings they had seen on Earth. Its walls were made of concrete and steel, that was true, and electric lights were set into the ceiling above their heads, but otherwise it was completely different from the abandoned ruins of the others.
They trooped out, James and Tony still staring at her wrathfully, but Thor gave her a weak smile, which she returned with a nod.
Natasha had already taken off. She sprinted towards the forest in a zig-zag pattern, followed closely by Steve and Thor. Both Bucky and Clint were returning fire as the Grounders began to shoot. A spear went flying over Clint's head.
'Everybody calm down.' A huge muscled blond pushed his way through the crowd and stood in front of the aggressors. 'Rogers is right,' he said, in his slow, rather old-fashioned accent, 'we have descended upon the wrong peak. Commander Fury wished us to land beside the underground refuge used by those of the past. He called it Mount Weather. We must find it.'
'Absolutely not,' Thor said angrily, and Tony sighed, turning to face him. 'You are not letting my little brother go into such a volatile situation. He would be killed if he were found out!'
His younger brother was still tied up, his dark hair unkempt, blood and dirt still on his cheeks and hands, deliberately ignoring Thor. Thor had tried to clean his wounds for him - they were just scratches and a bruise on his jaw where Bucky had hit him, but Thor was still worried. However, Loki adamantly refused to let Thor come anywhere near him.
'Yeah, that's my knife, but - but I swear I didn't kill him. I have no idea what you're talking about and you're in my fucking face, so move, psycho -'
Clint heard her punching in the numbers, and then he heard the soft grating of metal against metal as she carefully twisted the hatch.
'They must've cleared this place out. All the supplies were distributed before the last of the bombs went off, I guess. It's basically of no use to us.'
'Hold them off!' he screamed back, urging himself to work faster, but in his hazy state of mind he could barely just go at a normal pace.
'No, no shovel, but we did find large pieces of metal, no idea what they used it for,' she said, frowning slightly.
Bruce volunteered first. He felt like he wasn't doing much at all to help the camp. Sure, he'd helped Clint recover, but that was only because Betty came up with the idea of taking apart the poultice. Thor volunteered, as did Sam and Bucky.
The ground felt very real. So did the rope around his ankles and wrists, and the rag stuffed in his mouth. So he wasn't hallucinating. His head was throbbing painfully and he was pretty sure there was a cut along his left leg, which was bleeding out as he lay there. So, not dead, either.
'Don't stress about it. If he really was as interested in you as you are in him, he won't be able to stay away. Think about it for a while. If you truly believe he's the one for you, then go for it. Talk to him, tell him your actual feelings, tell him you're scared of rejection. Give him some space for now and just mull it over - is he really worth a heartbreak?'
Loki shook his head, his mouth twisting into a humorless grin. 'Why? Why should I answer that, brother? Do I really need a reason? It doesn't matter now, does it? I killed him, and you're going to kill me. Rumlow's right. Where's your justice now?' he taunted, but he was doing his best to avoid looking anyone directly in the eye.
They relaxed by the fire for a bit, just watching the others in the camp. He'd gone around previously, introduced himself, learnt everyone's names. Peter Quill, his girlfriend Gamora, Drax and Mantis were hanging out near the trees, with... a raccoon? Peter Parker was in the corner, tossing bits of deer into Wade Wilson's mouth. Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes were talking to a kid named Sam Wilson who'd seemed really enthusiastic about birds - far too enthusiastic for Thor to continue having a normal conversation with him.
Steve held them back and glared at the drop ship doors. ‘Is it justice you want, Rumlow?’ he yelled, and there was a pause.
Betty approached more cautiously. She smiled at Bruce and then crouched next to Clint, whose shirt had been cut away in order to access the wound better.
Steve's eyes darted to the direction Rumlow pointed in, keeping the other boy and the barrel of the gun in his peripheral vision at all times. Rumlow had indicated the far left corner of the drop ship, which wasn't cluttered by any supplies or seats. It used to be a living space for the delinquents before Steve moved them all out to make space for the sick.
She was right. The squirrel's face was oddly proportioned, but it was looking away rather than looking right at them. Clint picked up a rock, aimed, and hit a branch underneath the one the squirrel was perched on. It immediately turned to look at the source of the noise and everyone gasped.
Steve ignored him and stepped closer, holding him up. He reached for Bucky to try and support him as well but he began to gag and he stumbled.
Loki was leading them down the path where Stark had been abducted. He'd told them that the outpost with the tunnels had only been manned to spy on the delinquents and otherwise it was abandoned. Once HYDRA realized they could use Loki as a spy they retreated back to their main base across the river.
She hung out at the back of the group, unwilling to talk to any of her friends. James shot her a concerned look but she didn't say anything to him either. She couldn't let him get closer to her than he already had. She wouldn't. She even stopped speaking to Clint. If she let them break down any more of her walls it would be her downfall.
She shrugged. 'We may be dying this very moment,' she replied darkly, and when she saw Clint's face she added, 'when we get back to camp we'll see if there's a radio or something on the Quinjet, and we'll try to reach the Helicarrier and ask them what's happening.' Her plan was solid and Clint nodded.
'All of you need to calm down. It's a horrible thought, sure, but if we go back there and scream that everyone's loved ones are dying it will just cause panic and confusion. First we're going to need a radio, or something to message the Helicarrier with, because I don't think they're going to come down after their system interprets - what, ten casualties? More?'
She was standing in front of Rumlow, jabbing a finger into his chest. The entire camp was focused on the two of them. Everyone was watching.
Tony had been having a great day, because nothing screams fun like bleeding from three orifices at once, worrying over your sick, unhappy, reckless boyfriend and then building a bomb - IED, whatever - to kill a couple dozen people.
Barton had miraculously recovered. He was still too weak to go out on a hunting party or leave the camp at all, but he could walk around and assist in other ways, like helping Sam cook the food or reluctantly sharpening weapons alongside Wade and Okoye. That didn't stop him from jealously staring after Natasha and Bucky as they went out into the forest.
Steve nodded and stepped away from the launcher. He didn't trust himself to light the flare, partly because he was inexperienced and partly because he was so distracted by his thoughts that he didn't think he could do anything properly. He let Gamora take his place.
As soon as she was out of his sight she inhaled sharply with relief. She didn't know that was going to work. Sure, she'd identified the poison, but she hadn't known what species of poison dart frog was alive on the planet. She also didn't know if the other plants had any sort of mutation. But, Loki was an idiot, so here she was.
He wondered how life on Earth had been. The way it was described in their history textbooks, it was the most beautiful place in the universe. The SHIELD Helicarrier - the biggest and the most advanced civilian space station out of the twelve other civilian space stations - could barely hold a candle to it. He'd done many, many sketches of what he thought Earth had looked like.
The logical thing was to get out of there, talk to Steve, get backup and chase away the intruders. HYDRA so close to camp was a massive danger and they needed to get rid of it. But Bruce was frozen in place. He couldn't move. He didn't dare move. He tried to control his breathing so he wasn't panting in fear and moved aside a frond just a little bit to catch a glimpse of the intruders.
'Get in the drop ship and lock the door. It's only Rumlow in there anyway. When T'Challa comes back someone will have to tell him what's going on - Nat, can you?'
'Stand on the box,' Rumlow snarled. 'You're going to hang yourself, and I'm going to watch. You better do it or I'll go out there and put a bullet in your pretty boy's head.'
They followed him as he led them down a winding staircase, up another corridor and then stopped at a rusted metal door. 'HYDRA built these tunnels many years ago, when they first came down to Earth. They don't use them anymore because they have full access to Mount Weather, and they don't put any guards here. All the better for us,' Loki told them.
It was so silent. Everyone was sitting by themselves, looking forlorn and trying to block out the Maximoff kid - Wanda - as she cried over her dead brother's body.
He looked around at their camp. Surprisingly, the delinquents were organized and worked together without any hitches. Sure, Wade Wilson sometimes got into a skirmish and had to be saved by his boyfriend Peter Parker, and sure, Tony would sometimes break the rules just for the fun of it, but otherwise they were mostly functional.
She turned to the two others, who were still glaring at her, and she set her jaw, a steely glint in her eyes.
Natasha was about to say something in return when Loki crouched, ran his hands over the ground, closed his fist around something and pulled. A section of the forest floor swung open like a trapdoor and Loki turned to them with a flourish, smirking.
Tony painstakingly made his way back to his seat as the spacecraft shook and rumbled terrifyingly and clawed himself back in, slamming the metal brace down just as it began to blare an alarm and red strobe lights filled the craft. He heard Pepper yelling his name and he yelled back that he was okay, trying to block out the screaming and the constant, head-pounding shriek of the alarm.
'I just wanted to say - about the other night...' He tried to rack up the courage. 'I like you a lot, Steve, and I hope we weren't just a one-time fling -'
awesome. When you think it's me, no matter how much I protest, you still beat the shit out of me. But here you have a confession and you're not even going to acknowledge that? Where's your justice now, Wilson? Weren't you kicking me in the dick just a few moments ago? What's wrong, Rogers?'
'I didn't - never mind,' he said, raising his hands in surrender. 'Just - be smart about what you hide and what you give away, because all that's going to come and bite you in the ass later.'
'Stop acting innocent. You know exactly what I'm talking about. I asked you a question. Why do you care so much? It's not like you have other things to worry about, like Steve, and the loaded gun I'm carrying, and, you know, survival.'
And it was this thought that was the last thing he could remember before he tripped over something on the ground, hit the ground hard and blacked out.
Romanoff was now sitting beside the stricken Wanda, talking to the girl in their native language and trying to comfort her to no avail. She had found a gun, and so had Barnes, which made them the most deadly people in camp, and she used that to her advantage, glaring threateningly at anyone who dared look at her.
Barney had gotten his father's rage and his addiction to drinking, so by the time Clint was thirteen he had two tormentors in his life.
When no one made any move towards Loki, he laughed. A maniacal, bitter laugh that chilled Bruce to the bone.
There was a moment of silence, and then she asked, 'Can you please send Val in? I mean, if you're done talking, that is. I want to see her. She's okay, right?'
The three of them trooped to the front of the spacecraft, pushing through the crowd. In front of the doors was the hot blond boy and his metal-armed companion, trying to open the doors. Tony rolled his eyes and shoved past them. 'Move aside, dinosaurs, it's not even hard to do,' he muttered, ignoring their glares.
buckynat softness and everyone being idiots is the theme of today's chapter :) first off, steve is terrible at diplomacy, can we agree on that? he's great at saving the world and all, but being subtle and lying and twisting words around is NOT his strong point, sorry, steeb. secondly - the drop ship exploded. it exploded, y'all. i'm stressing on that. let it sink in. it exploded and guess who was on it?
'Really? Steve's down there, half-dead because this rat's knife was fucking poisoned and he won't tell us which one of the bottles in his little bag is the damn antidote and you're saying no violence?' James spat, turning on her, his icy eyes full of rage, and she met his stare evenly.
Steve narrowed his eyes, watching it as it did its strange little dance. Clint crept closer, his blond hair clearly visible amongst the greenery, his bowstring taut.
'Well, for starters, they are not ready for you at all. If you attacked tomorrow they'll all be dead in a few hours. Most of the delinquents are still recovering from the sickness and there are fifteen dead, so that would make the total amount of delinquents eighty-five,' Loki said.
'I got you a hammer, you oaf,' Loki finally snapped, swinging the weapon to the front with a considerable amount of effort.
'I'll get onto that,' Steve agreed. 'Can you just tell her that we're going to need to, you know - take away her brother's body?'
Tony heard muted gasps and squeals of excitement. Everyone leaned forward as Fury began explaining what they were going to do on Earth and how they were going to survive, and how brave they were for being the first to step on Earth in a hundred years. He didn't explain why they were going, much to Tony's frustration.
As the girl's spasms slowly faded and her eyes closed shut, Natasha kept humming, a beautiful song Clint had never heard before, and only when the girl went completely limp did Natasha remove the knife and stand up.
Wanda was wiping away her tears, her jaw set and her eyes burning. Natasha was right. Her brother had been murdered and she wanted justice. Thor couldn't blame her. She stared blankly as they covered Pietro with the dirt, her hands clasped in front of her. Only a few delinquents had attended the impromptu funeral.
'I'm as okay as you can get if you're carrying a bomb to blow up a bridge in the middle of nowhere while slowly dying, I guess.'
He arched an eyebrow. 'That was the worst lie I've ever heard and I've had to deal with Steve breaking his arm and then saying he was just scratched.'
'That hurricane I told you about? They're going to wait for it to pass, and then they're going to launch an attack. You need to be prepared. They have guns, bombs, ammunition - they're stocked. Only thing is, they're running low on supplies. They don't mention it but I saw it. They didn't prepare very well when they came down, and even though they raided Mount Weather, it wasn't enough.'
'Say, do all of you have the combined emotional capacity of a walnut, or is it just you two?' he asked the guards who were closing the door of the Quinjet. They didn't reply, wonder of wonders.
Steve jogged towards the direction Natasha pointed him in and managed to get a decent view of the clearing if he crouched down and peeked underneath several tall plants. He could see the antelope, limping across the forest floor.
He hadn't actually meant to punch Rumlow in the face - and break his nose - and dislocate his shoulder. But Steve had found him physically kicking around a couple of kids who were barely six years old, taking their brand-new shoes a watch (both expensive commodities, probably the only ones they could afford) and
'Alright, now you gotta adjust your aim. Here, hold it. Put one hand there - don't touch the trigger - and put your other hand over here, on the front end of the handguard.'
He quite enjoyed the duty, mostly because it involved staying away from people and keeping to himself. Usually he would be patching up someone's wounds or Clint would dominate the lookout position, so it was rare he was sitting up here, watching for any signs of intruders.
Clint watched as around ten Grounders emerged from the trees. The lead Grounder was on a horse, his face obscured by the hood he wore. The others were on foot, in full gear - and carrying weapons.
'My brother had not informed us of this meeting. I believe it was an official invite sent by HYDRA and they used him to make us feel at ease,' Thor said in his booming voice.
'I will take my leave now. My excuse for staying away covered four days and they will get suspicious.'
'We're going to contact the Helicarrier now,' Steve was saying. 'I think Sam finished speaking to the parents of all those who died. We need to set up a system so everyone can talk to their own parents. Unity Day celebrations are coming up soon, cheer up, everyone!'
Thor looked at Jane. 'It seems to be around a kilometre away. Do you wish to alert the others or shall we make haste at once and find out what this drop ship is?'
'I had a radio in the drop ship,' Valkyrie told him. 'I planned on communicating with them as soon as I touched the ground. Clearly that didn't work out so well. Thanks, by the way,' she added, to Bruce, who nodded. 'No problem.'
'I have told you I am fine with Loki staying here. He doesn't deserve any punishment. He was just doing what he needed to save himself -'
'I've died and gone to heaven,' he mumbled, jamming the lock open and reverently lifting up handfuls of the projectiles.
Natasha gave him an apologetic look. 'I'll tell you all about it later!' she called, following Steve and Thor.
It had been a massive explosion. Any small hope that there were survivors which had lingered in Thor's heart immediately vanished. The ground was blackened and the charred metal was poking up in different places. The main shell of the drop ship was utterly destroyed. Puddles of weird-smelling pink liquid were everywhere.
'How much farther?' he called out to Steve and Bucky, who were way ahead. Bucky turned. 'Not much, it's a small hill,' he yelled back, and Clint nodded. Bucky's eyes lingered on Natasha for a moment longer and then he turned to face the front again. Clint smirked - he was definitely going to ask Bucky about that later on.
'Blood trail,' Natasha said suddenly, looking towards Bucky. 'Yeah - yeah, there should be a blood trail. Look for a blood trail.'
From literally nowhere a spear had come flying and had struck Barton in the midsection. He'd dropped his bow and quiver and had collapsed to his knees, which was unsurprising considering that he'd just been stabbed.
It already made her vulnerable and she hadn't even been on Earth for two weeks. She tried not to show it but she knew she was screwed. She loved Clint, with his brotherly teasing and his tendency to be a dumbass and his lame jokes. She loved her little group of friends - Steve, Tony, Thor and Bruce. She was opening up to Wanda, and to Sam and to Peter.
'I mean - if you're fine with it, then go ahead. Just don't do anything life threatening, and make sure you inform us about everything,' Steve instructed.
Natasha leaned back against the tree and looked around at their camp. They'd made some significant changes. The most noticeable one was the wall. They'd made a wall from scrap metal, wood, heavy barrels and boxes from the aid depot - anything strong they could find, really. The trees helped, forming a sort of support structure for the wall.
'Does anyone even know where we're going?' Stark said loudly from behind them, looking at them over his sunglasses. Steve rolled his eyes. 'Yes, Stark. We're going to climb the mountain nearest to camp, which is this way, so we might be able to see Mount Weather.'
'Haha. If we're done insulting my fashion choice, I would like to say that yeah, I like him, but I'm not ready for a relationship.' He sighed. 'I'm scared, Buck. What if he got tired of me and broke it off? I don't know how I'll deal with that.'
He sat in a corner by himself, furiously rubbing at his arms. Occasionally he thought of Natasha, who he'd purposefully left with Barnes, and wondered if she was stuck in the storm or had the common sense to stay inside. He also thought about Fury - whether the old man missed him, if he was okay, and if he was monitoring Clint closely.
The Romanoff girl was talking to her quietly in Russian, trying to soothe her. Thor admired the redhead's nerves. He knew that no one in the camp would have done what she did to the delinquent who died from the acid burns. It took courage and an ability to remain emotionally stable, both of which most of them lacked.
Heading right towards her was an enormous fucking storm. It was orange-ish, and looked nothing like dust or sand. She turned her head and saw Steve, his blue eyes panicked and his hair tousled. 'What the fuck is that?' she called out to him, and he shrugged - just as it hit them.
The only reason she was alive and not floated was because Fury had survived the assassination attempt due to Clint knocking him sideways, but the bullet had hit him and he was gravely injured. Even that could have lead to a death penalty, for she wasn't from the Helicarrier, but Fury had been compassionate. The way he'd studied her made her think he knew about the Red Room.
'How did I not know about this?' Tony demanded, all of his snark gone in the face of this horror. 'My father must've known, he was right there in the inner circle - and he never told me! We were slowly dying out and he never told me!'
Clint had the brilliant idea of putting her and Barnes in charge of exploring the other bunker, by themselves, while he, Thor and Bruce headed back to camp with the supplies from the first one.
Tony ran out and tried to go around to the side, but there were too many people in his way. By the time Steve and the others reached, they found Tony staring up at a hole in the second level of the drop ship which opened out to the woods.
Their efforts revealed a hatch, covered in grass and other material that had accumulated over a century. Steve and Barnes both pulled at it together and they managed to open it up. A ladder led into darkness, as far as Tony could see.
Already there was a crowd gathering at the gate. Steve and Bucky were outside, guns at the ready, and behind them the crowd followed. Other delinquents emerged from their tents, wide-eyed and scared.
Bruce approached her. 'You can stay in the bunker. It's sort of our medical ward,' he told her. She nodded and Bruce went to collect some bandages and a water bottle. They set off together to the bunker, with Thor hovering anxiously in the background.
'Well, Tony and I kissed. We kissed, and I liked it, and he did, too. And I'm not sure, but I think he indirectly asked me to be his boyfriend? And I want to, Sam, but I'm too scared.' Steve let out a sharp exhale. 'I really like him. I don't think I could deal with it if he ever broke up with me.'
Rhodey pushed past Steve and pulled him into a hug. 'You idiot, don't do that to me again!' Rhodey said angrily, and Tony relaxed in his best friend's arms, melting in the hug so quickly he was embarrassed.
Tony wasn't as sick as Steve, much to Steve's relief. He just occasionally had a nosebleed. They'd managed to contain the sickness to some extent, but their some of their best fighters - Steve, Bucky, Wade, Natasha, Clint - were all ill. Natasha and Clint both refused to stay in camp, which was why they were outside, scouting, but Steve forced everyone else to stay where they were.
Tony glared at his boyfriend, who was determinedly avoiding his gaze, and then turned back to Rhodey.
Holding them up to his eyes, he peered at the area where he'd seen the shadowy figure. Maybe it was one of the delinquents, maybe it was Loki coming back to deliver news - but he wasn't going to take any chances.
They'd familiarized themselves with the forest around them in the past few days. Steve had made several trips to the hill nearby and then back. No one was willing to venture into the thick jungle towards Mount Weather, but they had to do it at some point, because they would either run out of supplies or freeze in the cold, as winter was fast approaching.
The dark-haired boy next to Rogers with the metal arm furiously stepped forward but Rogers held him back. 'I'm not trying to lord it over you. I'm trying to tell you if we don't do something about our situation we're all going to be dead in a matter of days,' he snapped, clearly trying to keep his cool but failing.
Tony didn't know how to pick a lock. He never learned. Even if he did know how to, there was nothing in the room that could be used to pick a lock. In movies, everyone used hairpins, but Tony wasn't a girl and he didn't have long hair like Barnes or Loki. He also didn't need to be told that movies were far from real life.
He groaned and propped himself up on his elbows. A concerned-looking Steve was crouched next to him. Fucking Steve with his fucking blue eyes. He was the reason Tony was on the ground anyway. Behind Steve was Barton, who was smirking like he'd just won the lottery of catching other people in embarrassing positions.
Clint didn't know whether or not he wanted to get involved in a serious relationship. He liked the way they were now - joking around, kissing, and occasionally having sex, because that was the whole point of friends with benefits. He didn't want to get in a relationship, break up and then awkwardly avoid her.
anyways, i think i'm done, i'll see you next time, comments and kudos are appreciated, stay safe and lots of love,
Rogers thanked the muscled boy while his dark-haired companion gave Rumlow and his gang a triumphant smirk.
Before she could ask him what the flying fuck he meant, he had her face in his hands and was kissing her.
'I suppose I'll stay with my brother,' Thor finally said, swallowing the meat. Clint's eyebrows rose. 'You mean that kid?' He jerked his chin in Loki's direction. As if sensing he was being talked about, Loki looked up, saw Clint and Thor, narrowed his eyes and went back to doing whatever weird thing he had been doing.
Thor didn't say anything. He was just standing there, looking at Loki, who looked right back at him, his gaze still burning with defiance, daring him to say something. Thor didn't take the bait and turned away, walking in the opposite direction, his head bowed. Loki watched him go with an emotion akin to regret in his eyes, but when he saw Bruce watching he immediately steeled his expression.
why me?' Clint groaned dramatically, falling onto Natasha, who smacked him away with a disgusted look on her face.
As Clint pouted, Tony peered into the still-darkness. 'You're supposed to light the matches, Barnes. Not just wave them around like magic wands,' he stated. 'I know that, smartass. Give me a moment,' Bucky replied. Sure enough, a second later a match flared up.
'Stop,' Mrs. Barnes told the two guards firmly. They did, much to his surprise, and she took his face into her hands. 'Sweetie, I tried so hard, I really did - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry this is happening. I should have argued harder, but they made the decision,' she told him gently, her hands shaking and her eyes filling with tears.
The scouting party did find a deer, and once they decided it was normal-looking - or at least, didn't have two faces, three eyes and eight legs - Barton and the red-haired girl had both thrown their knives and taken it down with impressive accuracy. They'd then lugged it back to camp and everyone had cheered once they realized they didn't have to eat stale bread and tough jerkin for dinner.
'It was nothing I didn't hear before. You know Dad, he's a dick. Always has been one and always will be one. I'm used to it,' Tony said nonchalantly, shrugging it off.
His using her real name made her heart skip a beat. She hadn't expected him to stick to it. She didn't even know why she'd told him her real name when she hadn't even told it to Clint, but she had, and he seemed to like it.
'So. Any idea what the fuck we're going to do in here?' Tony asked Steve, who shrugged. 'I guess I'll keep going through this, see if I can find anything useful. Maybe you could check the other rooms? Like, we could use the plates and the glasses, and the extra sheets on the bed.'
'Yeah, right, you're just saying that because you wanna hide the fact that my jokes are way better than yours,' he snorted, and she rolled her eyes, smiling.
'Wait,' Natasha said slowly. 'Something's wrong. It's coming down way too fast. Where's the parachutes? Why aren't they activating? Why's it coming down a day early?'
'I said no. Who are you to even come back into my life, old man? I don't want to talk to you. Go the fuck away,' Tony said firmly, emboldened by Howard's confusion.
He'd almost racked up the courage, but then he'd had that accident while testing the effects of gamma radiation - which Betty had been helping him with - and he really didn't know what happened, but later on they'd told him he'd injected way too much gamma radiation for the dosage of the myostatic primer.
Steve was about to say something when he started coughing again. Oh, right. The sickness. Tony caught him before he collapsed, eyes wide. 'Steve. You okay?'
'Hurry up,' the other boy snapped, clearly getting impatient. He cocked the pistol, as if to remind Steve that he could kill him at any time, but Steve wasn't convinced. Rumlow would've shot his brains out long before he could even open his mouth if his main objective was to just kill Steve and be done with it.
Thor and Steve picked a corner of the camp not too far away but still close enough to visit and began to dig, shoveling out large piles of dirt. It wasn't as easy as it was in movies - Thor found himself straining only halfway through the dig and after he made a decent-sized hole, his arms were aching.
Steve, Bucky, Natasha and Tony had all stood up and made to run towards Clint at the same time, but all of them were too late. Clint was yanked up into the air and simply disappeared.
They'd lost four more delinquents to the Grounders. One was speared, two were caught in a spike trap and the last one had his throat slit and was dumped in front of the camp. It was maddening and appalling. They'd also caught sight of the Grounders a lot more. They seemed to have their territory in the jungle separating the delinquents from Mount Weather, which was just perfect.
He pulled out his flashlight and shone it into the nothingness. The ray of light illuminated the worn steps with puddles of water. The ceiling was dripping and Steve didn't want to know why. He pulled up the hood of his jacket and gingerly stepped into the emergency aid depot.
Fury was explaining the use for the bracelets. 'They monitor your heart rate, your blood pressure, toxin levels and give us information on how you're faring on Earth. In case you're in serious trouble we will be able to send help to you. And if you're perfectly fine, we will be able to come down and start living on Earth again.'
It was a cruel world they lived in, but as they sat there on the grass, hands tangled in each other's hair, open-mouthed against each other's lips, Tony believed that it could actually be better.
Natasha, James, Steve, Clint and Loki were currently making their way to the outpost with the tunnel Loki mentioned. The sickness had died down, just like he'd said, and left most of them weak, some barely clinging to life, and five dead. HYDRA hadn't attempted to attack again. The bridge incident had been two days ago, so Steve thought it was clear and they could go check out the tunnels.
He opened a box and found blankets. Thick, coarse blankets, sure, but they would keep them all warm in the winter. 'There's blankets here!' he told Tony, a bit more happier than he was a few minutes back.
They all made noises of assent. Thor gave a distasteful look at the gun Valkyrie was attempting to hand him and he hefted his spear. She shrugged and tossed it to Tony, who caught it, fumbled with it and nearly dropped it.
The bright side was that he wasn't the only one who was confined to the medical bay. A quiet Steve and a disgruntled Valkyrie were his constant companions, Steve there because he, too, got stabbed, and Valkyrie there because of the concussion she'd gotten when she crash-landed.
new chapter, babes! guess what, steve's gotten over being a self sacrificial dumbass. well, he's still self sacrificial. just less of a dumbass, i guess. also, tony angst! :( fuck howard. like, can we just boycott him? ugh. idk why i make myself write angst but it's there in the tags, thanks to past me, who thought i was up for a challenge, or some bullshit like that.
He walked around the room. Hopefully Loki wouldn't come back and see him free from his bonds. Or maybe he should. Then Tony could take his revenge. Being gagged and tied up by a fourteen-year-old was utterly humiliating and he couldn't wait to get out of there and never think about it again.
Tony angrily wiped away the blood with his sleeve, got up and tried his best not to fall over again. He needed to do this. He was going to do this. They were depending on him.
Clint nearly choked on the piece of meat he'd just eaten. He spluttered for a few moments while Natasha watched unperturbed and, when he finally swallowed, he stared at her in shock.
It was only when Bucky saw a few drops of blood that they realized they were going in the right direction.
She took a deep breath, looking around her. In the morning when Bruce had woken her she was so awestruck by the scenery, the view, the animals, the plants - everything. The happy light in her eyes reminded Bruce of how much those in space were missing and why they had to try and communicate with them as soon as possible.
Loki crossed the room in two strides, his eyes burning, and Tony actually found himself scared of the fourteen-year-old. There was a haunted look there which made him automatically shrink away.
'Okay, then. I'll see you later, Laufeyson.' With that, Steve whirled around and headed towards the communications tent. Bruce ran after him.
'The radio's working! And he connected the screen from your drop ship so that's working as well! We're gonna talk to the Helicarrier, they're gonna come down!'
'I never thought I'd be saying this, but...' Tony stood up and clapped his hands thrice, loudly, and called out, 'Hey, can I make an announcement?' gaining everyone's attention. Once everyone was silent and looking at him, he began.
'Um -' Steve almost squeaked, '- thanks? You're - you're gorgeous too,' he admitted, his face a shade of red so dark he could be mistaken for a fucking beetroot.
They both looked at the smoking spacecraft, damaged from both the short free-fall in space and the rocky landing.
'But I can try,' Steve replied, and then gasped. Tony guessed that Rumlow was strangling him and he almost sobbed in relief when he found what he thought were the right wires.
'Yeah, tell that to Pep. She's about ready to tear you to pieces. The only reason she didn't leave camp is because if she did leave for even a minute it would all go to hell over there.'
A crowd was already beginning to gather around the two groups. Natasha pushed to the front and caught the tail end of what the blond boy was saying. '- weren't supposed to be here! You heard Fury, he said we were going to land on their secret bunker at Mount Weather, or whatever, and if you're not the least bit concerned of what the fuck we're going to do then I don't know what to say to you,' he spat heatedly.
Bruce nodded, arranging his meager possessions beside his makeshift bed. 'When you're done with that, do you think you could help me find and fix that radio Romanoff was talking about?' Tony asked, after a few moments of silence. 'Sure, why not?' Bruce replied, and he could've sworn Tony sighed in relief.
Carol also explained that they hadn't decoupled the Exodus ship from the Helicarrier, meaning that all of the systems on the Helicarrier had been crippled and everyone was going to die soon because of the lack of power. She told them the thrusters were failing and the oxygen supply was rapidly decreasing, and the only room which had a decent amount of power was the communication cabin.
Bucky shrugged. 'No idea. I was lying earlier. We never sorted things out. We kissed and that was it, I guess. Don't worry, I'll figure it out.'
Guilt slowly began to fill him just as the alarm stopped. The lights disappeared and the spacecraft was suddenly still.
A screen in front of the craft flashed and Commander Nick Fury appeared on screen, his mouth in a grim line and his eyepatch as festively black as usual. 'Good morning, all of you. I am Commander Nick Fury. You are gathered here as volunteers for a mission which hasn't been attempted in the history of the Helicarrier - you are going to Earth.'
Wait, that wasn't fair, wasn't Tony the one to usually start the kissing? He should have - never the fuck mind, this was incredible. He was kissing Steve and it was incredible. Tony curled his hand around the back of Steve's neck and pulled him closer, eliciting a groan from Steve. He was pretty sure their make-out session would've turned into something else when somebody started screaming.
Rusted metal, shattered glass and bits of plastic completed the desolate scene. He nudged at a dented tin mug with his foot, and a large many-legged insect skittered out.
'What's up with you, anyway?' Clint asked her, an arm carelessly flung over the armrest of the couch, his legs stretched out, as comfortable as possible. He took another piece of meat from the plate in between them.
He turned on his heel and fled, running in a zig-zag pattern like how Romanoff had told him to do, hoping against hope that he wouldn't get a bullet in him.
The crowd had pinned Rumlow down and had easily knocked aside his two buddies. They tied him, gagged him and made sure he wasn't able to move a muscle before they started.
'We don't know for sure. Steve said it was humans, Natasha said that we couldn't tell for sure before knowing all the facts, and Tony's saying it's aliens from Mars.'
The bridge was quite far away. Clint had never come across it before. It took around an hour of stalking the trio of delinquents before it finally came into view. It was a plain thing, with no fancy design and no tall structure - a basic bridge, spanning across a thundering river that roared past them and whose spray kept getting into Clint's eyes.
Steve glared at Thor. 'Yeah. They sent Loki and some other goons to call us to some bridge and we're going to talk there, I guess.'
They both climbed down the ladder and closed the hatch behind them. Tony had already left the drop ship. They hurried outside to find Thor wrestling with his younger brother, Steve, Bucky and Clint squaring off with Rumlow and his buddies, and the bird-obsessed kid Sam and Tony's best friend James Rhodes trying to break up the fight.
He grabbed Steve's hand and they sprinted back to the safety of camp, collapsing into hysterical, wheezing laughter when they reached, covered in dirt and blood but still alive.
Clint looked around as if just realizing where they were. 'Well, this isn't it. I think we landed in the wrong place. The Quinjet must've been defective.'
He had been sitting in a crouch for around five minutes, his thighs and calf muscles beginning to burn with the effort, and he had just come to the decision that the noise was made by some critter in the woods and he was being silly, when he heard voices talking.
He walked over to Tony and took the rifle from him. 'First you gotta find the charging handle - it's for putting the cartridge in the chamber, clearing stoppages and clearing the weapon, and then you gotta put the magazine - okay, it's already loaded. It's a dummy clip.'
She held it over the girl's carotid artery and, quietly humming something - a lullaby, a melody, he didn't know - she slid it into her throat.
'Hey, get a room, will you?' someone yelled, and Steve broke away, gasping for breath, his pupils blown wide, staring at Tony who was smirking back.
'Since we're very much alive, how do we tell them that?' Steve asked, tension clearly visible in the way he set his jaw. Everyone was glancing at each other, thinly veiled panic and horror in their eyes. Most of the kids still had families or people they loved on the Helicarrier.
He knew he should've tried and talked to Steve about it but he couldn't bring himself to. Tony Stark, flirt extraordinaire, playboy and all-around heartbreaker, couldn't bring himself to admit his real feelings to a boy because he was afraid of getting rejected.
Steve was never one to back away from a fight, even if he was sorely undermatched. When he believed in something, he would defend it to the very end.
'Haven't I seen you before?' he asked, undeterred by her utter dismissal of him. He wisely remained a good distance away, though. She still didn't give him a reply, but she paid a bit more attention to him now. While outwardly she looked like she was continuing her work, she was subtly glancing at him.
Everyone had a little beauty in them. You just had to look for it, and once you did, you really couldn't tear your eyes away. Human beings were so strong, resilient, stunning - they may be a bit damaged, but they overcame all their challenges and rose to the top, and Thor really couldn't get enough of that. He just couldn't wrap his mind around it.
Clint had appeared out of nowhere. Behind him were Thor's other friends. Thor grinned and joyfully swung the hammer again, causing Clint to duck, stagger back and curse much in the same way Loki had.
'Yeah, fuck that,' Steve said determinedly. 'They killed your mom and God knows how many other people. I'm all for blowing them up. Tony, can you make a bomb from that stuff?'
'You know, maybe that prison cell wasn't so bad after all,' Bucky muttered, lying facedown in their makeshift tent.
'Damn, okay,' he muttered, mentally making a note to stop staring at Darcy whenever she was in a room with him.
His face was hollowed, sunken in and a bright red. His skin was stretched tight over his skull and his eyes protruded from behind sharp cheekbones. He looked like someone had set him on fire and then painted him red. It was horrifying.
'Don't call me wonder boy. Okay, now stand like this, move the gun a bit lower, put your foot there, yeah, like that -'
She wasn't afraid of failure and punishment, or her ever-growing list of enemies, or that she was going to die - or anything reasonable, really.
'You gotta stop doing that. I owe you, like, three souls of the damned and my firstborn by now,' Tony said jokingly, purposefully not looking in Steve's direction for fear that he would see Tony's tear-stricken face.
