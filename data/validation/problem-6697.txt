Tony sighed. “Look, it wasn’t clear if this would ever become something we’d have to talk about. I had a feeling they were working on something for a while now, but I didn’t have any specifics. I found the document three days ago.”
you,” Steve breathed as if just pushing the words out there. “In the last couple of months… it was hell and I’ve missed you
He trailed off then, and Tony saw the moment understanding seemed to dawn on him. His expression turned into a vast well of grief. “You found out, didn’t you. About the Winter Soldier. About your parents.”
Suddenly, the world spun as Tony lifted Steve off the floor, the wings still wrapped around them. Despite the fact that Tony was much leaner than Steve, he’d always emitted a vast amount of power, and finally, Steve understood why.
This couldn't be the desert. The light was all wrong, the sand under him… wasn’t sand. The air tasted different. His hands were at someone’s throat—
This might not be permanent, but it had left a permanent mark in Steve’s heart. All he could do right now was enjoy it and hope it wouldn’t hurt too much when he remembered who they were…
“Daaaa-da,” Ian whined. Both of his hands were slapping against their shoulders. His voice clearly said how much he wasn’t pleased with the lack of attention, and both Tony and Steve drew back, chuckling as they pressed their foreheads together.
, yes? I’m dreaming up a Captain America lookalike, that’s—that’s very creative, Tony, really. Dad would be so proud, you know, if he’d still been alive.”
Tony held up a hand. “You don’t have to explain anything to me, Steve. So you’re saying no, that’s fine.”
. No, he couldn’t let this happen. Steve stumbled as he heaved himself to his feet. He was running towards the two, ready to launch himself at Tony and pull him off and away—when he noticed it.
So much contempt flooded his tone that nearly all of them flinched. Tony glanced up at Bucky and while the man fought to keep his expression neutral, Tony could see his jaw tensing. There had never been an official death toll before, and that really wasn’t something Tony’d wished for him to know.
Steve’s head spun. The ground was so far away. “She’s gone,” he said, then, more fiercely: “Let me go.
… He'd recognize the man currently standing at his doorstep from miles away, even though he hadn't seen him in years.
Their fingers laced and their eyes met. The head of Steve’s cock rubbed tantalizingly across Tony’s opening, and he smiled when Tony whimpered. Then, slowly, Steve edged himself into his ass and held.
“I know you didn’t sleep at all,” Steve pointed out. “It’s fine. I got a little shut eye, I don’t mind.”
“Still in check-up,” Steve said and had to smile, when he saw Happy following Rhodes through the door. “They want to make sure he doesn’t have any internal injuries,” he explained. “It’s only a routine check-up, but it always takes longer with the arc reactor.”
A long sigh left Steve’s lips as his gaze travelled over the horizon. He was too lost in his thoughts to notice someone stepping up to him. That someone called his name and Steve startled when a hand touched his shoulder. He glanced up and met Rhodey’s eyes.
Rhodey pursed his lips thoughtfully. “Of course you can. Maybe this is not the version you’re used to. But you and Steve... you can make a different kind of right. If you want that.”
Tony grinned, sitting down behind him. It wasn’t a chariot or a horse-ride into the sunset, but he’d grown to appreciate the piece of junk Steve called a bike… even if he’d never admit it. “Ready and willing.”
Only when Jocasta gently reminded him that he’d just torn through the last available bag, he dropped his hands and just… stopped. He shuffled over to the showers and let the scalding hot water fall down on him.
The tour seemed to bring out a childish glee in Steve that Tony couldn’t help but find endearing. In the gift-shop, he ogled over the crappy voodoo dolls and flipped endlessly through the Millions of ghost books. When the cashier told him that spirits could only be captured through photography, he insisted on purchasing a throwaway camera. He was having far too much fun with this. That was the thing with Steve. He was an enigma. And he was always surprising Tony.
“Mutual.” Tony hesitated, clearly wanting to ask the obvious and clearly uncertain as to whether he should.
Tony reached for his hand, pulling him up and into his arms. “Not about you,” he assured Steve. He grimaced and took a deep breath. “I’m happy that you want this, elated, joyful, really, but… Look, it wasn’t just the one agency that dropped us. They all did. It was difficult from the start, nearly impossible with being superheroes, fighting all the time, but with Ultron…” He sighed. “Half the world thinks we’re a group of lunatics practicing vigilante justice. A few call us serial killers. No one will let us adopt a kid. Money won’t change that.”
“But you want to,” Tony retorted pointedly, searching Steve’s gaze. He hadn’t let go of him yet, and that was good, right? As long as Steve wanted this… wanted
and wasn’t that… it was odd. No one had tried anything since Steve had effectively put an ‘off the market’ stamp on his forehead.
“Tony?” Steve prompted, wanting to take it all back at once. Whatever horrors Tony associated with the workshop, Steve wanted no part in them if it made Tony look like
It were times like these that reminded Tony how very lucky he was to have these people as his friends.
“Yeah,” Tony said. He fiddled with his pant’s back pocket and Steve raised a brow when he pulled out a pair of sunglasses. “The glasses use a chip that’s connected with the user’s hippocampus,” Tony explained and walked around the pedestal. “That way, it’s able to track memories, and produce them onto an external infrastructure.”
told Steve, he’d expected… well, not much of anything, really. It was a shot in the dark, and he’d had no idea how Steve would react. He knew people did not give him remotely enough credit for how well he’d adapted to this century and the impact technology now had on the world, but then again… it wasn’t something any person on the planet would get used to easily.
Amazingly, Natasha's neutral mask fell at that, and she turned on Clint with a fiercely protective expression. “He could hear us. How could you say something like that?”
Tony grinned when Steve slipped into Brooklyn-mode for a second and walked up to him, his eyes focused on his face determinately. “That so,” he said, biting his lower lip. As soon as he stood right in front of him, he leaned up to brush a fleeting kiss against Steve’s lips. He’d hated that short flicker of distance that had settled in between them, and he hoped this would break the ice a little.
Tony watched as Sam spread his wings then took off into the clear sky like he had been doing that every single day of his life. And he tried not to let it show how much it ripped him apart not to step into the next suit and follow him into battle.
“You were fine.” Taking full advantage of their position, Tony squeezed Steve tight enough to restore his hardness and elicit a rumble of passion within the same beat. Steve’s gaze fogged over and he stared at Tony with deferential wonder.
An eternity later, Tony’s thumbs were still caressing weightless circles into Steve's damp skin as his lips found his temple. “If I could move my hand I would high-five you,” he murmured, kissing the other side as well. He trailed his mouth across Steve’s face, pressing kisses on his closed eyes, his nose, and his lips.
Barnes shrugged. “Yes. He’ll always have me. And yet, Steve’s the... the most alone person I’ve ever met. Always has been. And I think the rejection is starting to get to him. It’s been month after month of rejection, from everybody, for so long now. And… Steve… I think he was really scared about coming back here.” Barnes looked sideways at him, his expression meaningful.
Steve's eyes opened with the alarm. He watched the ceiling fan spin for a long moment, taking the time to let reality settle in before sitting up and rubbing sleep out of his eyes. Another dream of his old friend, huh? At least it wasn't another one of those
A muscle was ticking in Ross’s cheek. “And yet, the little chips in his head control his behavior. One wrong word, and he might go back to killing.” Ross spoke to Steve, but his eyes were focused on Phil, obviously believing him the more reasonable of the two.
“I’d love to,” Steve replied honestly and a genuine smile stretched his lips. Perhaps today had changed things. He didn’t know, and he wasn’t about to gamble that his concerns—his worries and his jealousy over a woman whose home was now a tomb—were now issues of the past. But there was a sense of accomplishment that came with standing in Tony’s most private place he could not deny.
Tony heaved a long breath, feeling disheartened all of a sudden. He pulled his hand back after squeezing Steve’s lightly, and instead rubbed his forehead for a moment. “There’s… reasons, why Pepper broke up with me. The damn bunny was just a drop in the ocean of all reasons. And I guess it’s just fair to warn you that I’m…” He cleared his throat, putting the fork down for good, his appetite fading. “I’m not an easy man to deal with, in the long run. And you might think my eccentricity is charming now—which is still surprising to me, by the way—but… people tend to find it less charming the longer they know me and I’m…” A sigh. “I
“I’m assuming that means you won’t punch me for the surprise visit,” he said heatedly, while pressing another kiss to Steve’s smiling lips. There really was no sense in looking back now, or in questioning how completely out of control he was whenever Steve was near. He’d been lost the first time they had kissed—a fucking goner. And now, after days of yearning, craving,
Steve's step faltered briefly when Tony kissed him. He should've expected this, probably, what with Tony's shameless flirting and all, but it still surprised him. He cleared his throat, then shook his head to clear it.
Tony glanced at Steve, and smiled slightly. “It’s good ‘cause it means I got to him when he wasn’t expecting it. He knows now that he’s vulnerable, and that’ll make him angry at me, and therefore, reckless.” Tony pointed towards his eyes. “This is good. It’s a first step.”
Tony had no idea where Clint and Sam were, but Bruce and Steve were standing at the bar, talking animatedly to Maria and Doctor Cho. Letting his head drop back, Tony closed his eyes and let his mind drift away.
What ghosts still held so much power over him, Steve wondered. And what could he possibly do to free Tony of their grasp?
As for Stark Mansion, the transformation was unlike anything Steve had ever witnessed. The building had always been a sight to behold, but now, it almost looked majestic: the gardens, the entry hall, even the kitchen. And although a part of Steve truly dreaded the ball, he still wanted everyone to enjoy themselves.
The next night, they had entered the room again, and the wooden easel Tony had smashed against the wall repeatedly stood once again in the corner, fully intact.
“Steeeve…” he called, and yeah, he was definitely completely wasted. Wonderful. So much for having an honest conversation.
No reaction. Barnes only lowered his gaze to the floor. His metal hand kept clenching and unclenching, but Tony refused to back down on this. At the end of the day, this was a room that had been designed to keep the Hulk at bay. When it came down to it, Tony knew Barnes couldn’t lay a finger on him.
Carefully lifting the blanket, he peeked down at Tony’s crotch. “Nah, you’re good.” A pause. “Come to think of it…” Steve smiled and moved down the bed, under the blanket. Wrapping his fingers firmly around Tony’s soft shaft, Steve took it into his mouth, sucking it gently. He might not be able to make him come again, but he knew Tony loved a bit of over-sensitivity.
“Why not both,” Natasha murmured, struggling against him briefly, her breath quickening when he let go of her hands, his fingers finally tracing around her stomach, then lower.
Words left him as Tony suddenly fell on his knees right before him. He didn’t wait a second, didn’t give Steve any time to think, before he opened his mouth and took Steve between his lips.
Maria huffed, rolling her eyes at Steve. “Oh, well,” she said. “Let’s just invite all the evils of this world over to watch movies. Anyone got Loki’s telephone number? I hear he’s not much of a talker, these days, but—”
It was agonizing, the moment after. Without the pressing need to climax, he suddenly came back to reality. And reality was that he was sitting unbuttoned and opened, on top of Tony—Tony, who was now wiping the spendings from his hand with the tail of his shirt sleeves.
“He used to be,” Stane said. “It’s probably the new boy he’s fucking. I noticed he drank less, but I was sure he’d be back to his habits once he’s alone.”
Tony was good looking, it wasn’t if he’d been blind before, but now it felt like there was a second, foreign pair of eyes looking at Tony. Eyes that didn’t belong to him but to some… skewed, imaginary version of himself. And Steve had no idea what to make of that.
“Steve,” Rhodes warned quietly, a look of concern on his face. “It might be better to leave him alone right now.”
It was so easy to lose himself in Steve. They were home and Earth was safe and they had plenty of time to figure it all out.
“Oh, hey, wait,” Steve said, and pulled both arms around Tony’s shoulder, stopping him, before softly pressing his palms over Tony’s eyes. “Got a surprise, remember?”
After a few back and forths, Tony wrapped both arms back around Steve’s neck, and Steve didn’t hesitate before placing his own on Tony’s hips. Steve smiled—a small, surprisingly timid quirk of his lips—as he drew Tony close to his body. He held him gently and relaxed into the dance, swaying them together in time to the melodic rhythm.
Tony’s mouth was enthusiastic against Steve’s, wrestling hot, needy kisses as his hands took chart down his body. When his hand reached for the waistband of his boxers, though, Steve’s entire body froze.
He smiled when he saw what Tony was drawing. His ‘secret invention’. He’d started with the first sketches somewhere in France, and by now, he worked on it almost every day. So far Steve had only watched from afar, never daring to ask him about it. But he’d caught brief glances.
“We do now,” Steve said before he could think it through. The words were out his lips and he pressed his eyes closed, as if in pain. He shouldn’t have said that, Tony wouldn’t want for him to force his feelings on him and—
“Kiss me more.” Tony’s hands linked around Steve’s neck in a blink. Steve’s kisses peeled Tony’s reservations away without trying; drinking him in as though he’d been starving for him. As though the distance between them had been slowly killing him as well.
“Mister Stane…” Steve started, though his voice was hushed, as if he couldn’t form decent words anymore.
“I… I had this plan. Coming here, talking to you a bit, then surprising you with…” He waved at himself. “You know. Then maybe talking some more, and… point is, I didn’t really come here just for a quickie, and I’m sorry if I made it seem like it.”
(P.S.: I was told to say that the chapter title doesn't have anything to do with "Something about us" by Daft Punk and Interstella 5555, I don't know the movie, but there. I said it ;-) It's just a title.)
talk. Barnes’ name would come up and that proverbial cat would be well and truly out of the bag. And with Pierce gone, Barnes would face the full force of his actions.
it simply hadn’t been friendship what he’d been after. Maybe friendship hadn’t been enough, and all these emotions, the sheer
“It wasn’t Tony who had his doubts,” Steve clarified without missing a beat. “It was me. I haven’t even told him I want it, yet. The whole time I wasn’t sure if I was ready… and now…”
It was strange going to furniture stores and picking out sofas, tables, and other essentials to fill their apartment as though they were the epitome of a long-time couple, but Tony enjoyed the hell out of it. There was something so adult about the entire experience, reserved solely for people who could make it this far. They had both moved out of their parents’ houses, and together, they had decorated their new home.
“Whatever it is you’re happening to be doing down there. I love everything you do.” His lips danced down his throat. “You feel so good. Don’t know how I managed without this.”
Tony smiled. “Yes. Arc reactor. It’s not easy to find people who are willing to participate in a project that is highly experimental at best. Bruce Banner showed an interest when I talked to him, that’s why I’ll have to take that next step now. Obi isn’t thrilled about the whole thing—and that’s definitely a euphemism—but he said if I wanted to find investors, I had to do the presentations myself, and he’s right about it. No one else can do it. It’ll take a while, talking to everyone. Two weeks, maybe more.”
A pause settled between them, heavy and coated with unease. There was no failsafe. No chance to take back what they had started. Eventually, Tony nodded. “Alright, lets take on that last implant.”
“Let me rephrase that,” Tony said and now there was the hint of a threat in his voice. “Tell him or I will.”
Tony nodded, though his expression turned a little pensive. “Obi’s not happy about it. He thinks the whole thing is a hoax,” he said. “I hope he’ll come around. Otherwise…” He sighed.
“Your papa’s so needy,” Tony whispered with a smile as he looked down at Ian. Their beautiful boy, all soft skin, tousled hair and innocent eyes, as he nursed his milk. He didn’t have a worry in the world, no fears, no superstitions, not a single mean thought in his head.
but polite enough. For a moment, he pondered if beating around the bush would make this any easier, then decided that the direct approach usually worked best with Obi, and cleared his throat. “My boyfriend, actually,” he said, raising his shoulders in a ‘Yeah, I know’ gesture, and trying for a smile.
After she’d shoved him off again, Bucky tumbled back on the bed, landing on his back, and Natasha had the audacity to smirk at him with rightful arrogance.
Steve stepped into the lab just in time to see everything flying off the table and a mechanical arm trying to fistbump Tony's shoulder. It would've been a hilarious sight if it hadn't been for the strange man that had just left and the utterly furious vibe that Tony emanated.
"Tell me again?" he asked with heavy breaths while he clenched and unclenched around Steve, tentatively wriggling against his groin without actually moving. He felt so full, not just in the physical sense, but fuller than he had ever felt before. It felt as though with Steve at his side, he had found a part of himself again that had been missing for a whole long while.
Or that’s what Tony told himself, because the truth was—despite the fact that he’d called Steve, asking him to come back to New York, he had absolutely no idea what to say to him.
Tasting Steve’s lips with liberated passion, the warmth of his mouth so welcoming that Tony thought he might crumble at the potency of his hunger alone. Steve kissed him as though he had been waiting years to be kissed. His arms were around Tony’s chest, his body pressed against him intimately.
Tony sighed. “Fine, I will. But it’ll be at least fifty percent your fault if things go to shit because of this.”
Aside from the physical changes, Steve’s mind was stuck on replay. Despite the fact that he’d been preparing for Project Rebirth for weeks, everything had happened awfully fast. Every time Steve closed his eyes, he saw the scene again. He heard every word, felt every breath Erskine had left on his face as he’d whispered his last words, relived every second and was no better off for it.
Tony’s head turned and brushed the curve of Steve’s shoulder, then he felt his sudden stillness and knew he was awake. Through the screen of his lashes, Steve saw that he didn’t look angry; he just looked startled and maybe even a little amused. He stared down at Steve thoughtfully for a while, then frowned all of a sudden. Steve held his breath, then was completely shocked when Tony’s fingers brushed his face lightly, first beside his left eye and then just beneath it. Then he drew back. He felt Tony sit up and work his way downwards and out of the shelter.
Which was ridiculous. There was no way he would let Tony go. Not now that he had his love. Not now that he felt the grip of Indries’ ghost slowly fade away. Not now that he felt so wondrously liberated.
“We dealt with it like adults,” Steve said, pointedly ignoring the snort coming from Clint’s direction. “End of the story.” He pressed his shield in Bucky’s hands. “Shower?”
. But we’re here now, and I love you so much it’s almost too much to handle. I can’t promise you that you can come back home in a day, or a week, or even another month. But I promise you I will still be here when it happens.”
“Sorry!” Tony blurted before he could help himself. He heaved a sigh of relief when he realized it only was a minor burn mark.
By now, the dramatics of their time at MIT was a well-loved memory, something to look back on and smile about.
The thought was not as reassuring as it probably should be. He didn’t want the others to rely on him like that. Not when he was this unsettled, this off his game. What good would he do them when all he wanted to do right now was pick up his old bike from his apartment in Brooklyn and just see where it would take him?
He started walking again, satisfied with himself, but he didn’t get very far until a hand at his right arm brought him to a halt.
was the first thought going through Tony’s head and he took a long, dumbfound moment to just be grateful for once, because this time, he really thought he’d lost the man for good.
With that, Tony’s expression changed. Steve could almost see the determination forming behind his eye-lids. “Alright. If you… if you want it, I’ll talk with Pepper, first thing in the morning. We’ll find a way.”
"If you don't want to sleep it off, at least drink some water and give it an hour before you go into the lab," Steve said, and he really thought it was a reasonable offer.
"Ready?" he asked eventually, voice ragged as he spread his legs a bit more. He gave himself one more good thrust, making it a point to go in as deep as he could before he pulled his fingers free.
"You sure did surprise me," Steve said, smiling ruefully and then nodding his head, relieved. Talking would work, they could work stuff out if they talked, and it was so great to know Tony didn't seem to be into it just for the sex. "And, uh, in that case, how about we go to my room?" he offered, tilting his head in that direction.
Before Tony could change his opinion, Steve had already slipped an oiled finger into his body and rubbed his insides with gentle, steady movements. Tony was very tight around him, clearly not used to the intrusion. With soft words and calm instructions, however, Tony was able to calm down a little, unclench, and take what Steve had to offer. With tender swipes of his tongue, and a few pointed thrust of his fingers, he soon enough had Tony’s hips eagerly buck against him. And throughout it all, Steve held him to the earth, keeping him grounded.
A long sigh shuddered through Tony’s body as he rolled onto his side, facing away from Steve. “I’m not in the mood for talking right now. I’m tired. Good night.”
Clint grasped her wrist suddenly, his own eyes seeking hers. “We were doing good, Tasha. We saved people, we changed things. Whatever else HYDRA did, we were doing good when it counted, and there’s no one who can convince me otherwise.”
“I don’t wanna miss him growing up. I don’t wanna wake up alone anymore.” He pulled Tony against him. “Please don’t make me leave.”
seventeen years old for the next few months, and I’m not gonna miraculously change the day I turn eighteen, either. I can’t… I can’t stand this on and off thing anymore. I can’t have you want me, and then freak out about my age a few minutes later. That’s… I was trying to let you off the hook, for god’s sake!”
“I was doing what you told me to do. I’m staying here, while I could very well be over there and just find him myself. But I’m doing this your way—and
Tony snorted. He pulled out his phone, putting down a quick note for FRIDAY to check whether or not Peter’s hot aunt could afford the college funds, and to help out if she couldn’t. “Trust me,” he told Peter, “I did a lot of things to shape that image. And I never really managed to stick my foot in my mouth when it was needed.”
“I tried. But it’s not about me. It always comes down to you and the Captain. And both of you never trust me enough to truly change your ways.”
“Oh,” Tony exhaled with a brief widening of his eyes. “I… I’d say you should probably let someone from SHIELD check that before you get too funky, but—”
“That’s just it, though. The world is going to end anyway, unless we can find a way to stock up our defenses. I might not be able to undo my failure with Ultron, but I know our only hope is in creating something powerful enough to oppose him.”
Bruce smiled back in that kind way of his, leaning back against the wall. “True. But for what it’s worth, I really think we’re doing the right thing.”
Steve ticked each objective off on his fingers as he went. “The way to the bridge is unguarded, but to be absolutely sure I’ll approach from the south side, where there aren’t any outfacing lights. I’ll scale to the third floor from the east wing to avoid the agents’ dormitories. To get inside, you’ll open the lock. The area itself shouldn’t have any security alarms… but I guess I’ll find out about that.”
It wasn’t that he’d never thought about it. What he would do if he could turn back time. If there was a way to prevent what had happened during the Sokovia Accords fiasco. But deep in his heart, he knew that Steve would never listen to him.
Tony closed the door behind himself and wordlessly retrieved a first aid kit from one of the cabinets, making sure to stay in Barnes’ line of sight while he moved around the room. He set it down next to Barnes and stood there, regarding him for a long moment. Barnes seemed to shrink under his gaze when he glanced at the kit, then turned his eyes away.
Veronica had just handed him over to Tony half an hour ago, a guilty expression on her face when Ian had started to throw yet another tantrum.
Tony took a low breath and clicked the button on the side of his watch. The screen turned a bright blue—9:16 am. He clicked the button again and the display changed to a countdown: 07:08:29:06, 07:08:29:05, 07:08:29:04…
It made him wonder why he’d never had any trouble understanding Tony. Sure, in hindsight, he should’ve realized that Tony was no ordinary man—that something was special about him—but he’d never felt as lost around him as he did with most people here.
"What are you doing up so early?" he asked Natasha by way of making small talk as he surveyed the various kitchenware on the counter. There were some pancakes left, still warm, and a mixed salad beside.
Tony’s face fell and a choked sob escaped his lips as he pressed another kiss, and a second one, against Steve’s lips. “For once, I don’t think that’s enough,” he breathed.
Gently, Tony picked up both of his hands and lightly kissed each knuckle. “You’re perfect,” he said, still smiling. “Stop looking like you did something wrong. Come here.”
Slowly, Tony shook his head. “I have never…” He paused, wanting badly to take off, to run from this strange man who knew his deepest secrets. Instead, he raised his chin, staring Steve down. “I never even told Pepper what exactly he did with me.”
“I’m not picky. Whatever you’ll make sounds great,” he said, while he grabbed for a mug, still waiting for his coffee to brew. He cast Steve a carefree smile. “I can help you, but fair warning, I tend to set things on fire a lot. There might even have been an explosion involved in Malibu, once, but that was completely JARVIS’ fault for not warning me in time.”
On the television, Tony watched three men run away through the Vienna suburbs, a good few dozen armed soldiers hot on their heels. There were shots, over and over again. The soldiers fired to kill, and all Tony could do was stare at the little figure that was his husband.
Tony’s expression remained flat. “It is for me. We’re just so different. And I don’t know anymore. Everything that I did know has come apart. And that’s good. That means things changed. I’m just not sure I can get used to this new order.”
“Will you marry me and be my cook?” Tony asked from where he was sitting down at the dinner table. T’Challa had at one point joined them, and Bucky watched as he talked to Ian, who was hanging in Nat’s arms, with a low soothing voice.
She handed him the faded photograph, and Steve couldn’t stop the amused little sound leaving his mouth as he looked down on baby Tony giggling, drooling and biting on some plush toy that looked a lot like a wrench.
When Steve deemed him ready, Tony turned around on his back, raising his knees a little so Steve fit snugly between them. Steve brought himself into position and slid into him. Instinctively, Tony raised his eyes to Steve’s face. He always did that. That look of pure bliss never got old, and it had Tony falling in love with Steve more and more every time.
It was all kinds of wonderful. He even beamed at Steve once, before apparently realizing what he was doing, and schooling his expression.
A small smile crossed Tony’s face as he saw Steve, and how he was looking into the sky. It was completely dark around, the stars were perfectly visible.
The dream had to be the serum messing with his head. Some kind of side effect Erskine hadn’t foreseen. And that meant it wasn’t real. And temporary. It was only some post-injection dream, starring a man who was everything Steve knew he could never have. It was his mind telling him how lost he felt right now. Not really much to figure out there. No matter how tangible it looked or felt, Tony and this motel room, they were about as real as Santa Claus.
"Well, not exactly. I just… what's up with him?" Steve asked, relieved that he didn't have to broach the subject. Bruce really seemed to like Tony, even though he tended to scold him often.
wearing blinders,” Steve said grimly, eyes narrowing at Tony through his detachment, composed but more troubled than ever.
As soon as they stepped into the ammunition bunker, Tony unerringly turned to a corner that opened to a flight of stairs Steve had never before explored. Granted, he’d never had much time to snoop around this area. The only time he’d had access, he’d been in a hurry to get ready for the final formation of the day.
Outside, dawn was slowly creeping over the streets of New York. Tony’s hand snagged Steve’s, lifting it to his lips and kissing each of his knuckles.
He would repeat it as many times as Tony'd ask. He'd do anything he could to make Tony understand how serious he was.
They stayed like that for a long time, with Steve’s arms wrapped tightly around Natasha’s tiny form. Then, her hands were wandering to the top of his head, dragging it down a bit, so her mouth, petal-soft, could press a kiss against his cheek.
Unaffected by the rebuke, Clint merely shrugged. “It’s a valid question. And it’s not like it’s going to upset him. If he is brain damaged from being frozen and defrozen hundreds of times, he won’t know what I’m talking about anyway. And if he isn’t, then why should he be offended?”
Laughter fell away into passion then, Tony’s mouth greedy and demanding on Steve’s, his blunt nails raking down his back.
"There you are," Sam said, a grin spreading on his face when he saw the two of them standing next to the door to the restrooms. "Nat said you might… be… here…" He trailed off towards the end, eyes darting from Tony to Steve and back again, until it was obvious he'd reached a conclusion, a small, exasperated smile spread on his face. "Took you long enough," he said then, and waved them over. "Come on, we really wanna wrap this up. Everyone's waiting."
There was a long, heavy pause between them. And Steve knew what Tony would say next before he ever opened his mouth. “Sign it. Steve, I’m begging you.”
“Haven’t seen you wearing this in years,” Tony murmured. “Not since… I don’t even know. Didn’t it burn up at some point? I can’t remember.”
Slowly, before he could doubt himself, Steve rocked his hips against Tony. A soft breath left his lips when he felt Tony’s hardness against his own.
Rationally speaking, of course, he had figured Ross would take the disaster at the CIA gala as a final motivation to get his agenda with the Avengers going. And now, he’d pay them a visit tomorrow afternoon, taking four of his senator-goons with him.
He raised the disc up a little, and when he was sure Steve had seen it, leaned it against the wall next to the bathroom door.
Rhodey groaned, glancing around uncomfortably. Of course, no one was paying them any attention. Down on the playfield, their team had already scored the first touchdown and Tony rolled his eyes at Steve’s typical little happy dance. Infamous Captain Steve Rogers, Quarterback Extraordinaire, and the guy was easily the world’s biggest dork.
He dropped a kiss on her forehead, hugging her back. “Not likely. We do have a reputation to uphold.”
“You can’t go around telling yourself that every wrong move you make might destroy the world. It’ll drive you nuts. You have a responsibility to try and do good, just as much as every other man. Not more. Don’t do this to yourself. You deserve to try and have what you want. And you want Rogers, don’t you?”
When Steve spoke again, Tony could hear the steady slide of tears in his voice. The same that he covered well but not well enough. “I didn’t want any of this,” he whispered.
"Not really," Bruce said with a shrug, rotating his cup on the table slowly. "Tony's been giving you a hard time whenever you two meet, I know. You realize I'm usually there having to witness his painfully juvenile attempts to get a rise out of you." He lifted the mug to his lips and took a short sip. “You want me to talk to him?”
Steve tilted his head at Natasha. It took him two or three tries before he was able to talk, and when he did, his voice sounded weak and ineffectual. “You’re sure it’s him?”
Natasha’s and Clint’s faces both broke out into sly smiles as they looked him up and down. They didn’t say anything, though. At least they were kind enough to wait until the rest of STRIKE had taken their seats in the back of the Quinjet.
The picture changed to a newspaper article, and that was… Steve drew in a sharp breath as he made out the picture of Howard… and Maria. The article about their car accident in 1991. Steve closed his eyes for a second, and it was like floating in nothingness. Slowly, he glanced over to Tony. His expression was stony at best, and thoroughly unreadable. He wasn’t frowning or upset or anything that could be named; rather, he was blank, completely vacant, and that very vacancy resonated more than screams ever could.
Ah fuck, he’d forgotten about Natasha’s suggestion to talk to Vision. He just… there was so much going on, and with Ian and SI, he’d barely had any time, and—
Steve pointedly didn’t flinch. Where should he even start? There wasn’t much he could say to this. He knew they’d have to answer a lot of questions—about Ultron, about Sokovia, about their work in general—and he had a feeling this was just the beginning of something that had, if he looked back, already started after the Chitauri invasion. “It’s a long story. If you don’t mind, I’d rather tell you some other time, preferably with Tony there.”
“So…” Tony prompted, glancing up at Vision, even while Ian pushed his hands down all over Tony’s face. “Secretary Ross is coming over.”
Tony chuckled, loving how much Steve already loved this, and gave him one last kiss, before he dropped back down on the floor. “Oh, don’t pretend you don’t want this.”
“I love you so much,” Steve whispered against his lips, licking into his mouth before Tony could even reply. He tasted Tony fully, openly, giving no want for restraint. Steve’s hands were pulling at his shoulders, then combing through his hair. The taste of Steve had him drunk, and it had nothing to do with the painkillers.
Tony stared at him for a moment, and confusion gave way for realization. He sighed, then pressed his forehead against Steve’s. “It wasn’t your fault.”
Steve stopped in his tracks, looking up sharply. “I won’t let you navigate Iron Man with ruptures, and you’re still on painkillers.”
,” Tony rasped, turning around as his voice broke. “Don’t just stand there! Get out—Get out, please—”
“Why don’t you come over for dinner some time?” Tony asked after a moment. “I know Rhodey would like to meet you again, and I’d be happy to have you there, too. We could train a bit together. We have two whole training floors.”
Ross reluctantly sat down, taking the seat opposite where Steve was sitting. The four senators were silent sentinels at his back.
Steve felt a deep, racking shudder go through Tony when he pressed down on him even further. He was shaking continuously now and so was Steve, so turned on that it was almost painful.
Light was all around him—blazing white, hot, and cruel. Nothing else. Nothing at all for what seemed like an eternity. Then, the world appeared again in a blinding whirl of color and sound, and Steve was thrown on the ground so hard that it knocked the breath from his body.
Slowly, he sat up, moving nearer while trying to gauge Steve’s expression. When Steve only kept staring at him, Tony cast him a small smile and cautiously wrapped both arms around his middle.
Tony swallowed, forcing back all the tears that threatened to spill over his cheeks. “I’m right here,” he vowed hoarsely. “Right now.” With that, he pressed a broken smile against Steve’s shoulder so he wouldn’t break out into sobs.
“Want you,” Steve breathed against his mouth. In a blink, his legs were bound around Tony’s waist, his hands under his hips, and he dragged him up his chest and in position.
“Everyone,” Tony said, though he really hated calling all of the newbies in. Especially Parker. There was no way to tell if the boy would survive the battle and he was… he was too damn young to die. “I’m gonna call every single one of them. And if you’ve made a few new friends, go ahead and offer them free lodging until the world ends.”
"You wanna help me out of this?" he offered without even thinking about Tony’s proposal much, gesturing at his uniform with one hand. He didn't want to waste a minute longer on this than he absolutely had to. The notion of a shared shower was just too tempting, so without even waiting for an answer, Steve stooped down to unfasten his boots and shake them off, before straightening up and sending a questioning look in Tony's direction.
And then there he was. The confusion on Ian’s face all but evaporated, and he smiled brightly as Steve rubbed his nose against Ian’s.
“This could’ve been avoided if you hadn’t played with something you don’t understand,” Thor snapped, stepping closer again. He was all towering above Tony now, and Tony figured the only thing keeping him from putting his hands to Tony's throat right now was Steve.
Not some different dimension. Not an alternate timeline, no. This, here, was his own world, just four little years later.
The bulb’s leaves were now mostly brown, only a few speckles of green remaining. It didn’t matter. Worst thing that could happen was that it didn’t have an effect on him at all. Or so Tony kept repeating to himself.
Steve thought he probably agreed, but he couldn’t be sure. Raw spasms quaked through his body, and he did his best to keep rubbing himself against Tony’s hand. A long and decidedly high-pitched whimper tore through the air and Steve jerked Tony to his chest, crushing his free arm around his middle and burying his face in the crook of his throat.
“That’s stupid, Tony. You’re just setting up barriers for yourself to keep you from being happy. But you don’t have anything holding you back. Just yourself.”
There was silence for a long second, and Steve couldn’t move, couldn’t say anything. Then, he heard Tony take a shaky breath and walk away.
Tony's breath was hot against his lips and his eyes were closed. A furrowing of his eyebrows suggested a hint of worry and Steve gently rubbed his forehead against Tony's own. "You're a good kisser," he said, fondly running his thumb along Tony's cheek.
The Infinity Stones, on the other hand, were still blazing with life. And while Gamora tried to yank at the Gauntlet still attached to Nebula’s left hand, it was futile. Stephen Strange held the Stones steady, but Nebula had already sunk on the floor, her body limp and lifeless.
, Steve was fine with that. Today, not so much. “Look, if he’s busy… just say so. I’m not in the mood for long and complicated excuses.”
he replied in his mind—in the only way he could—trying to lift his hands and straining against the shackles around his wrists for a moment, before slumping back down on the cot. He never saw where the shackles had come from, they had to be somewhere in the bedframe, and every time Stark entered the room, he was restrained.
“No,” he said. “It’s not my place. Whenever you’re ready you can tell him yourself, or… not. Entirely your call.”
“You can never go in there again,” he told Steve, his tone cold and distant. Tony had never spoken to him like that before—and he was shaking, Steve realized, a nervous hand running through his dark hair as he ostensibly fought for control. “I asked you not to go. For God’s sake—”
It wasn’t just Tony, though. It was Pepper and Rhodey, too. Tony had always called the two of them his siblings, which meant they had to be angels, too. And Natasha… All this talk about being a demon, that she’d followed Tony out of Hell, all those knives she kept with her at all times, well…
It was already late noon when the others finally returned to the camping grounds. And when they left town, Steve took up position as driver, and even though Tony was handling the map, there weren’t a lot of words exchanged between them. Just the usual ‘can you pass me the water’, ‘next turn?’, ‘no keep going’ and so forth. They didn’t talk more than that, though every few seconds Tony felt the slow sizzle of Steve’s eyes as he alternated from staring at him to staring at the road ahead.
“Oh, don’t you ‘sweetheart’ me. I’m your CEO! I’m supposed to lead this company and I can’t do that if you’re stepping behind my back and mucking everything up!”
He closed his mouth around the tip, sucking on it briefly before letting go again. “Might as well have some fun,” he drawled, “Seeing as this is my dream and all.”
Steve fell into the wall and grunted in pain, but he quickly lifted his eyes when he heard the sounds of a pained groan. Bucky had Sam pinned against the opposite wall as he strangled his throat with his metal hand. While Sam heaved rattling breaths in agony and tried to fend Bucky off with his fists, Steve stepped up to him from behind.
“I’m not cutting you out of my life,” Steve said, his expression one of pure determination now. “Show me. I want to see you.
“Tony,” Pepper answered, and nowadays she wasn’t even deterred anymore when Extremis’ robotic voice greeted her. “The party already started?”
Still, Tony thought belatedly, did it really matter? In about two weeks, Steve would be on the far west coast, playing football for Stanford. Maybe all of this didn’t matter, anyway.
Flecks of red appeared all around his vision. There was something… penetrating… his head, his mind, flowing into his thoughts and… Oh, this couldn’t be good, Steve thought, and the next thing he knew,
“Tony really got to him,” Bruce confirmed with a gentle tone. “Trust me, I could’ve done without the dramatics, but his brainwaves were fantastic.”
“Yeah, sure. Easy’s the word. I train five times a week and the rest of it, I spend in the gym.” He smirked. “And I have to put up with being ogled all the time.”
“I can still stop him,” someone said behind them. They all turned around, and Tony stared at the blue woman with the robotic features.
“Point taken,” Tony agreed with a small chuckle. Leave it to Steve to lie there with his legs parted, pulse racing, blushing all over, and still somehow be the one to call the shots.
“Steve’s been wanting to talk to you,” Stark said after a moment. The words were soft—and so incredibly humble it didn’t seem possible they had come out of Stark’s mouth.
Steve’s lips were moving, as if he was trying to say something, but no sound was to be heard anymore.
there was anything to do. Steve met Tony’s pained eyes again; eyes that didn’t seem to belong to him, and it wasn’t just the blackness, they were unfocused and bleary, like Steve had never seen them before.
Apparently, he had been even more immersed in his own thoughts than he’d realized—so much, in fact, that he hadn’t
“Good,” he said shortly, turning around and shooting towards the sky again. “You can start with the hundred over there.”
Finally, he raised his eyes to Tony, and if he had any doubts about whether or not he looked good enough, the way he stared at Steve dismissed them immediately. In all the time it took him to reach the bottom of the staircase, Tony’s eyes never left his face. He was staring at him with the strangest expression. If Steve didn’t know better, he might have called it awe.
Tony glanced down with a heavy heart. “If I can get them back, I have to put them into cells. If I can’t, it’s most likely they’ll be shot in front of my eyes.”
Tony shook his head miserably. “I have no idea. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier. I guess I was still expecting for some sort of explanation, but… I mean,
Steve’s blue eyes darkened as he moved Tony above him. And it felt like Steve was striking a new angle with every plunge. And then he felt Steve’s hand grip the tip of his cock with precision, and it was over. From where his orgasm had sneaked up on him, Tony didn’t know. Only that his body gave way to its pleasure with a force that hadn’t changed. Even after all this time.
For a blessed second, he had Steve’s taste. He let his tongue brush against Steve's lower lip, committing him to memory.
Steve jerked back all at once, eyes wide with shock, and there it was, the splitting headache. On the same motion, his hand came up to cup his forehead. "Ugh…" he groaned, unable to keep himself in check. "I'm… I'm sorry… I don't know why I did that… I just… It's…" He avoided Tony's gaze vehemently. "I'm sorry."
In the few short years Steve had been teaching, he'd never been so directly hit on. Yes, some students did make propositions that were inappropriate, but those usually tapered off when Steve acted as if he was completely oblivious (well, he wasn't exactly acting but no one needed to know that, did they?)
It was true. Sam’s voice was still raspy, and the bruises on his throat looked bad. And yet, he would push through.
Natasha looked uncomfortable, and that wasn’t exactly calming Steve’s mind. Usually, she made sure to keep her emotions in check. “I sent a Morse code message to Bruce. His reply just came back… seems like Ultron told the truth.”
Eventually, FRIDAY alerted him of Ultron’s whereabouts. He was in the church, right in the middle of the city, and apparently, he was waiting for him.
It felt like years had passed since he’d last said or even thought her name, seen her face, or watched her from afar. He didn’t know how he could have forgotten her, how he could have lost something so essential. And now—now that he remembered—he wanted to spend hours reciting her name.
“Love you, too,” Steve replied without hesitation. They lay in each other’s arms, skin against skin, and heartbeat against heartbeat, and it wasn’t long until Steve felt himself drifting off.
Tony’s eyes almost bogged out of his face. “M-married?” He released a surprised laugh. “No, I’m… trust me, I’m as far from ‘married’ as you can possibly imagine. I’m the least-married guy in the world right now. It’s… look, maybe I should tell you that I’m not exactly marriage-material. If there was a certificate for that, I’d have three.”
There was a long pause. Agonizing minutes of complete quiet. Tony’s eyes were now seemingly fixed on nothing, and when he started talking, Steve knew his thoughts were very far away. “You know, for a moment… I thought we could make it,” he whispered. “You and I. I thought it would work out. And I even thought… coming back here wouldn’t change anything. That this place held no power over me anymore. I was a fool. And now it’s too late. I destroyed what little chance of happiness we had.”
“We need to talk,” Steve said, and his stance had already eased a little, though his hold on Tony was unwavering. “You need to listen to me.”
Ross smiled, and it didn’t even look gleeful, just tired, and it made Tony hate him so much more. “Exactly.”
Once Tony had downed the mug’s contents, he blinked a few times, then truly seemed to register them sitting on the couch. For a moment, his eyes lingered on Steve, and Steve could almost hear him think: ‘That’s still not your husband, keep it together.’
Strange caught his wrist with both hands and hauled. Steve struggled against the raging wind, then fell through the portal.
With Natasha and Clint standing in front of him, and Bruce crouching at his side. Bruce… who had a stethoscope in his hands, examining Steve with a concentrated look, because apparently Steve was not dead and needed examining.
something—somehow; help in a way that went beyond forcing Tony and Bruce to eat and drink something on a regular basis. Sure, Steve knew that he was in way over his head with all of this, that the science of what HYDRA had done to Bucky’s brain was beyond him. Yet sitting here was literally maddening. He could no longer block the sounds of the damn clock from his consciousness, and soon, he would go out of his mind completely.
“And what then?” Tony snapped suddenly. “It doesn’t work that way! There’s… there’s history books about you. Everyone knows what happened to the great Captain America! Do you really think my meddling would change anything?”
He fell for what seemed an eternity. The chest beam died out, and Tony thought about Steve, hoping that he’d make it out on the other side. He thought about his team, hoping they’d be able to move on with their lives, if he didn’t make it.
"He's Tony Stark, Steve,” Bruce said, and the sideways glance he gave Steve wasn't very encouraging. “A kid like him wouldn't be normal even if he tried, and you can tell he isn't trying very hard."
He wound an arm around Steve, stepping even closer while carefully balancing the cup of coffee so it wouldn’t spill over. He let his lips brush along Steve’s throat, inhaling his scent so he would never forget this moment again. “Looks like he was right about that.”
“I loved your wedding vows,” Steve said with a smile. “And we never needed the pillow talk, anyway.”
“Good, yes,” Tony said, following him towards the landing pad’s emergency-elevator that went straight down to Medical. He probably should put the suit through decontamination as well, Tony figured, and had JARVIS prepare everything inside the shop.
“What’s over?” Steve asked. “Because Indries was sailing with someone?” he asked and suddenly, he realized what this could mean. Why would Indries sail with someone no one had known about? They clearly all had thought she’d been alone on that boat—Had… had Indries cheated on Tony?
“Natasha… he’s—Tony’s not a bad man,” he told her heatedly. “I know how things look, but there’s more to it, I
“Your ring.” Tony raised his hand where a golden band was glimmering in the dim light. “I’ve got mine. Where’s yours?”
Steve swallowed—then nodded. “I know it sounds stupid. You married me, after all. Just… you said it yourself… what if this changed how things will play out? What if you—your past ‘you’—reject me?”
A few seconds later, Tony and Bruce walked in as well. Tony’s expression was anxious. He cradled a sleeping Ian in his arms and he looked around as if expecting to see a ghost. When they landed on Steve, however, they changed to relief.
He bit his lower lip, barely trusting his voice to be steady enough to go on. He wouldn’t be crying now, he told himself firmly, not understanding how and when he’d gotten so emotional over someone he’d never really had a chance with from the beginning.
Tony saw his eyes trail over the marks where Tony’s hands had already swiped off the dust and rubble days before. He probably knew that Tony had slept here before, but when his gaze turned back to him, there was no mockery, only sad understanding.
“Why should we want to work with you?” Pietro asked. “You are the reason our parents are dead. Because of you—
. Tony had long ago stopped fearing the assassin, but the look he gave him now was positively intimidating.
At top of the tree you could see the escarpment that ran the length of the river. It was by no means the highest point in the land, but it did get Steve up high enough that he had a pretty good view up and down the river.
At some point, he reached out and entwined both of their hands. And here, in the quiet aftermath, Tony could at long last acknowledge to himself that the bubbly feeling within his chest coupled with the sharp stab of pained longing he felt every time he looked at Steve was something the romantics called love. Something he had searched so long for, but never dared to admit it to himself.
The room that followed was dark. The only things visible were five dimly lit tanks, and on the far ceiling there was some kind of vertical tunnel leading out of the complex.
“This is me,” Tony said, once the transformation was over. “Samael. Satan. The Prince of Darkness.” He let a dark, archaic tone bleed into his voice, and was utterly floored, when, after a short moment of contemplation, Steve placed one of his hands on Tony’s left cheek.
Steve sat up with a slight wince, staring down at their linked hands for a long lost moment. There was a long, heavy pause… and it took Steve a whole minute before he could reestablish eye contact. When he opened his mouth, Tony already knew what he was going to ask. “Did you…” He bit his lower lip, and his eyes were so terribly glassy that Tony almost lost his bearings. “I mean, is he…”
“Then we would’ve maybe gotten the go-ahead for adoption, only for them to take it away again after what happened. It’s not your fault, it really isn’t.”
“Not all that much,” Tony admitted. He scratched the back of his neck, looking around. Steve was still just… standing there. And Tony was standing in front of his desk and… it was awkward, wasn’t it? Why was it so awkward all of a sudden? Their… not-quite-friendship had been tense sometime, but they’d never been uncomfortable around each other.
. Tony who’d so often goofed around with Peter, who had played stupid board games with them and watched endless hours of cartoon movies while eating junk food. Tony, who’d helped Steve solving the case of his mother’s murder and who’d brought justice to so many victims in those last years.
Tony had always known… right from the Beginning, that he was a creature damned by his own nature. And he didn’t care anymore.
had and that was bad enough. They strolled quietly back to the bar and Steve called for another whiskey. Bucky still said nothing, just looked at him with that impassive expression on his face.
This was where Tony had grown up, Steve realized, and while the whole mansion was clearly equipped with a high-quality interior, it felt strangely… impersonal.
“Uh, hi,” Tony managed as he frowned at one-arm guy and redheaded-hottie who stood there in a long shirt and not much else. He shook his head at the scene, then walked past the kitchen isle, heading towards the exit.
Sam’s expression suddenly shifted and he barreled forward without warning. For a moment, Tony thought he’d hit him, what with the way his eyes had widened and he had exhaled a sharp gasp. However, the next second, he pulled both arms around Tony’s chest and dragged him off to the side. Sam had used a bit too much power with his own repulsors, and together, they crashed into a nearby wall.
It didn’t take much to put two and two together. If it weren’t for the distressed sound of Steve’s voice, Tony could’ve entertained the idea that his mind was just reenacting last night’s very memorable action, but as it was… it was kinda obvious that Steve was having a nightmare, and not a sex-dream.
By the end of it, Steve’s fingers were pumping hard inside Tony; his lips were teasing his ears, his neck, his mouth. And just when he thought he was going to bring him over the edge just with this, Tony quickly removed his fingers and replaced it with his cock.
“Bad?” Tony shrieked. “You’re really gonna go with ‘it’s not that bad?’. One more inch and I could see your
Steve nodded, and there wasn’t an ounce of doubt in his eyes. “You’re one of the greatest guys I’ve ever met Tony. Everyone should be happy to be your boyfriend.”
The gears in Tony’s head started turning. So they had to follow through with their plan, it was the only option. Get Steve out of here, and stop Zemo from freeing those soldiers.
Tony groaned as he stretched. For centuries, pain had been such a foreign sensation. Only when meeting Steve, his immortal skin had suddenly hummed with awareness, making Tony feel alive, maybe for the first time ever. Steve had made him vulnerable, not just physically, but an all-encompassing vulnerability that transcended everything Tony had ever experienced.
When it was Steve’s turn, he glanced again at the gravestone, remembering his last sight of Peggy—calm and ready for what was to come after this life.
“Why do you believe anything about us could ever be good?” he asked without looking at Steve. “I mean… I’ve met your future version and I know he believed in it. But I don’t… I don’t know how you and I can be together and not hurt each other.”
This was… this was everything he’d ever hoped to get from a kiss. Butterflies in his stomach, a need for more that made itself home in every part of his body. The sheer
The quiet question stopped Steve. He was still storming inside with anger and disbelief at Tony's disregard of his own safety. It was true, a small voice in his head said, that if the building had collapsed on him, Steve was not as likely to survive it as Tony was, but the odds weren't stellar for either of them, really. He did think he would've made it to a safe pocket like this one, while Tony would've likely been stranded in his suit, which Steve couldn't even bear to think of, considering the anxiety attack Tony'd just had.
Casting that specific train of thoughts aside right then and there, Tony walked up to Steve and instantly grabbed for the straps of his upper uniform, unclasping them. “I have to admit I might have fantasized about peeling that thing off of you before,” he told Steve, his voice gentle.
“Sure,” he whispered thinly, but the pain was already fading into a dull ache, fatigue taking its place, and as much as he struggled to hang on—to see what had happened with Barnes—he couldn’t.
Steve’s expression turned bemused. Clint was talking about his new girlfriend a lot these days. The relationship hadn’t seemed too serious, at first, but seeing as Clint only spent a few weekends here and there at the Tower nowadays, it was very clear the two were going steady.
. Tony took a deep calming breath and walked away from the sofa area. Steve obviously wouldn’t be cheating on him. Steve was a good guy,
He leaned down to press his lips to Tony's cheek, then nudged it with the tip of his nose. He should be getting Tony a towel and his clothes. He should be taking care of things, but he couldn't bring himself to move away just yet.
When Tony woke, he was encompassed in softness. It was all around him. Everywhere. A hazy fog that clouded his mind with pure radiance.
Really, there was no other way to describe his feelings right now. He was having a major freak out and only barely managed to keep his cool around the others.
“Ba-ba,” Ian demanded some attention and from the pitch of his voice, Tony had a feeling he would be throwing a fit in about four seconds if Steve didn’t pick him up before that.
Tony shivered, shaking his head. “I can’t let you die,” he said urgently. “Maybe if I tell you how—“
Steve had barely any time to glance over his shoulder, before Bucky was taking down the suit with nothing more than a few well-aimed punches with his metal arm. He was ramming his fist right into the chest-plate, and while he couldn’t get to the suit’s reactor, he was still inflicting too much damage for the suit to stay functional.
“That’s good to know. Thank you.” Vision hesitated, after he’d put down the plate. “Well, then… have a good evening.”
"I don't need help," Steve said after a moment as he moved to open the fridge and retrieve a few items. "But you can assist me anyway, if you like." He considered the stuff he'd retrieved, ordering all the ingredients on the counter.
Tony snorted, trying to slap Steve and failing. “Stop telling me that while you have my dick in your hand, for
It was so hard, seeing him like this. So far, Tony had—despite all of Steve’s fears—managed to never let get Extremis get too far under his skin. He’d always ruled Extremis, Extremis had never ruled him. But in those last few weeks, Tony didn’t just seem ‘distracted’; he seemed to be lost in a whole different world.
“Wow,” Tony blurted, then gave Blonde ‘n Handsome an appreciative once-over. Yes, most definitely not what he had expected. Hot
Natasha was watching him with that calm understanding in her eyes that he did not deserve. She sat on the chair next to his bed, her naked feet both deposited on his bed frame.
“I think we should consider the fact that it didn’t leave any physical evidence,” Bruce said, his voice thoughtful. “Natasha and Clint said they don’t feel any pain, there’s no constrictions, no severe symptoms aside a bit of a headache. If you want my opinion, I think those visions they’re having might be temporary.”
Steve frowned and whirled around. He hadn’t noticed that the door to the interrogation room had been opened and when he spotted the source of the voice, his insides flushed cold.
This might just be the most polite battle in history. Safe only for the Hulk, who really lived up to his ‘Green Rage Monster’ nickname for once with the way he kept the marines busy.
Steve had always been convinced that he was the only one paving the way before him. No one else would do it for him, but this thing with Tony… it did feel a lot like destiny.
Steve stood up, turning on him with shaking hands. “Why didn’t you tell me?” he demanded, and it didn’t matter
There was something inside him, a bundle of heat and little electric shocks, that had him moan and gasp and whimper as he clung to Tony’s frame.
Steve swallowed down the lump forming in his throat. It wasn’t JARVIS’ intentions he was worried about. The AI had put trust in him from the very beginning, even when Steve had still been an undercover agent—pretending he was someone else only so he could get behind Tony’s secrets. He’d lied to Tony, had deceived him, and even though JARVIS had seen through Steve’s scheme, he had still put faith in him.
“That’s a matter of opinion.” Rhodey grinned as he let himself fall back down on the couch. They both opened their cans, taking a sip. “You know, Tones, I liked Steve well enough from the start. Even before I knew who he was. They guy has a good heart, and it wasn’t exactly hard to see that he wanted to… well…”
Steve stiffened, realizing what he’d just said. And when he glanced at Rhodey, he saw a strange sadness in his eyes.
, Tony couldn’t help but think, but bit back those words. Steve clearly believed that. And Tony had always been good at acting like everything was perfectly fine.
,” Steve choked. He leaned forward, burying his face in his own hands, and stayed like that for a long moment. “I know it’s not enough,” he said into his palms, “but… I wanted to tell you so many times. I just…” He shook his head. “I was a coward. I didn’t know how.”
, if Steve remembered correctly—raised both her hands, her expression becoming intense for a moment—before a blast wave went through the room, toppling all of the Winter Soldiers to the ground.
He hummed appreciatively against Steve’s mouth, cupping both sides of his head to draw him nearer. Steve’s hair was still damp and the blond strands somewhat tousled, and Tony loved how he could still trace Steve’s wonderfully unique scent underneath all those fragrances.
Tony nodded. “Well, I’m gonna call Bruce. Strange would be a better option, but after the mess with Urthona, he took a time-out, so… we’ll try, but I don’t think he’ll be of help. You said Strange is already around in your time?”
Steve stood up and raced towards Nat and the cradle. The Quinjet was hovering just above ground and Steve saw the red magic waves floating all around them, making it much easier to carry it inside.
The words arose behind Steve’s eyes. He saw him grasp them. Wrestle them down. It was a road much traveled. Tony knew every turn, every twist, every crack in Steve’s mind. Every tiny imperfection. Every stop. Every turning point. And right now, he was trying not to fall apart.
Grinning, Steve followed closely after Tony. He still worried the guy would stumble, though he seemed to be managing just fine on his own two feet. Sam was giving him a knowing look, but Steve ignored it entirely as he and Tony stepped out of the spacious training area. Sam closed the doors and followed them up the stairs.
His face. It was a face full of understanding and acceptance, the brown eyes naked… and so very familiar.
Steve didn’t draw back, though, he just lingered, the expression on his face one of utter comfort, like this wasn’t a groundbreaking development.
“This was a horrible idea,” Tony commented as soon as they rounded the first corner and he nearly died of a heart attack when a loud scream echoed across the large hallway.
Tony stared at him for a long, lost moment. Then he nodded. They could probably still talk about this afterwards.
Steve wasn't sure what had put Tony off. He didn't think he'd been teasing him that harshly, but maybe he'd stumbled upon a sore spot? He was about to ask when Tony put on that smile Steve hated, the one that Tony used to hide all other emotion, and complimented him on the food.
Tony stepped outside the balcony of the UN headquarter, letting his gaze sweep over the New York skyline. He pressed both hands to the handrail, gripping it until his knuckles turned white. No one had followed him, not Rhodey, not Natasha, although he could see that it cost them not to.
“Why are we here?” Tony asked, as if reading Steve’s thoughts. He had looked up at last, his hand falling from his face, even though he still didn’t look at Steve—or anyone, for that matter. He only stared at the space around him, some sort of shadow falling over his eyes.
“Leaves room for improvement,” Steve offered, and because Tony had yet to say ‘No’, he took that tiny opening and leaned forward even more.
Tony wondrously stared at the side of Steve’s head. He couldn’t even get a glimpse of the man’s face when he said all that, which was a shame, really. Tony felt some sort of wild giddiness bubbling in his chest, searing his nerve-endings with newfound life and inspiring his heart to erratic bursts every time he replayed Steve’s half-declaration.
beautiful, though.” There was something in Tony’s voice that rattled his insides. Steve shivered and looked up just as the back of Tony’s knuckles grazed the trail of hair on his abdomen, slowly moving downwards. He was staring at Steve’s dick like a man possessed, his eyes searing with lust.
Tony opened his mouth to reply, then paused and frowned. There was nothing for several endless seconds, as he tried to sort through his thoughts. “I get it, I do,” he said eventually, choosing his words with great caution. He was a futurist, first and foremost. And above that, he knew the both of them well enough by now to sense a conflicting subject as soon as it came up.
“Oh, it’s not,” Romanoff said. “We were just marveling at the probability. That your friend would hire someone you’re going to marry only a few weeks later. I mean... what are the odds.”
His eyes followed her as she dressed, moving from the bathroom to his small closet, pulling out one of his shirts. She slipped out of the bedroom and a few moments later, he could hear the sound of her humming as she showered. The same Russian melody every time; he knew all the tunes. When she reappeared, dressed in a simple jeans and his shirt, her red hair was damp and smelled like coconut.
Tony grinned. “Of course you’d know. You’re such a fangirl. At least, it’s not that Ant-Guy. All right, Ian, which will you have?”
“Or something… similar,” Steve pondered, though in that moment, he truly didn’t care how it was called; it was—breathtaking.
Ross probably knew how very much unwelcome he was. And wasn’t that a great way to start a potentially life-changing debate.
He didn’t try again to actually touch Steve there. He was obviously a bit uncomfortable right now, so Tony only brushed his palm across Steve’s ass cheek soothingly. "So… were you really gonna let me have my way with you in the shower for your first time?"
"Honestly?" Bruce asked, looking a little pained. Steve had to wonder about that, since he never knew Bruce to be so involved in anyone's life before. "I don't know." He paused for a bit, then added. "He doesn’t like to talk about his family. But so long as he's here, I'm happy."
She breathed against his lips as he slowly pulled out, keeping only the tip of his finger inside. Closing her eyes again, she gasped for air, lolling her head to the side.
“All the more reason to enjoy you.” With that, Tony took that last step forward, and then his chest was firmly pressed against Steve’s chest, and something hard against Steve’s thighs. A flood of heat pooled in his middle, and all at once, Steve felt very hot and very hard himself.
Rationally, he knew that to every battle, there were casualties. To save many, more often than not, a few had to die. It was horrific, it was brutal, but Steve had faced enough battles to know it was true. And he had accepted it and all the consequences that followed.
Peggy smirked, and it made her look so young for a moment it hurt. “Sorry, Steve,” she replied, “you got about a century on him. Besides,” she leaned back and held the photograph up, looking at it with a soft expression. “Once you change someone’s diapers, he’ll always be the little one for you.”
Bruce shifted, taking off his glasses and rubbing a palm over his forehead. “The human brain isn’t capable of suppressing that many emotions, Tony. It would’ve destroyed him. Maybe not in the next few years, maybe not even in a few decades, but they couldn’t have dragged this out forever. This would’ve happened no matter what, and we’re trying to ease him into it.” He smiled grimly and turned to continue. “There might be a lot of terrible things he’ll see, but neither one of us has the right to take them from him. He needs to grieve, he needs to feel guilt, like every human does.”
It would be five against two, not counting Zemo himself. Not exactly a fair fight if what Bucky had told him about their strength was true, but then again, he and Bucky had fought so many battles together, that had to count for something.
Tony was so lost in his thoughts, which were slowly accompanied by a pre-hangover headache, it took him a full minute to realize that someone was in the living room with him.
Steve cringed. He had hoped Bucky wouldn’t confirm his suspicions about the procedure, and he wanted to rip something apart in his sudden rage. Not wanting Bucky to see the fury he knew was flickering in his eyes, he lowered his gaze to the floor. “I’m so sorry, Buck,” he whispered.
There was nothing for a good few minutes; nothing but the mingled pants that colored the space around them. Tony’s arms and legs were still abound Steve and Steve’s face was buried in the hollow of his throat.
Sam nodded, obviously a little dazed. After a moment, he stepped closer, casting a pointed look down on Steve. “Tell him I expect to see him ready for our morning run, soon.”
Steve’s eyes fell on Tony with guarded apology, but he offered nothing more than a shrewd shrug in consolation. To be honest, that was exactly what he was thinking.
As if the Hulk had decided to counteract his thoughts, a wild green fist flew toward Tony’s face and was quickly deflected and countered with a swipe from Natasha’s legs, as she rushed at him.
Why had they even gone into this building in the first place? It had all been nicely wrapped up after the big fight, and there was only the matter of evacuating the buildings, but this one had been empty. Why had they gone in?
he’d never had this. He could feel Steve’s affection for him in every move he made and in every look he gave him. Steve may not be strong with words, either, but the want for more was so tangible, Tony felt he could just let Steve take a part of his weight and make those next steps together.
“I worried that they might bring up bad memories,” Tony admitted after a moment. “I’m glad you like them.”
Instead, Tony stared out of the Quinjet’s window. It was going to rain and the sun had just disappeared below the horizon. Sokovia loomed in the distance and it appeared both dark and quiet from this height; but Tony knew that the latter was just an illusion.
Yeah, it sure seemed that way. He wanted to say something, but words always seemed clumsy and rarely worked for him unless he used them to motivate troops—and later in his life, students—towards a clear goal.
How are you. Snap out of it. Your name is ‘Bucky’. James Barnes. Sergeant. The rapid-fire interrogation made his head ache, and it only served to confuse him more.
At first, he didn’t see anyone, and it was partly the blood in his eyes, and partly the daze in his head. He saw a whirl of red hair, and two men in uniform approaching. The knife at his throat was gone, and Steve blinked until the scene in front of him came together.
After about two point five seconds upon entering the RV, a sly grin spread all over Natasha’s face. “Good for you,” she said, leaning back, inspecting Steve’s and Tony’s admittedly still pretty rumbled state of clothing. Tony had at least wrapped Steve’s sweater around his hips, covering everything that needed to be covered. She, Bucky, Carol and Sam were sprawled around the dining room table. In the background, Steve could just hear the shower coming to a stop, so he guessed Rhodey was still in the bathroom.
“I won’t,” Steve said numbly, because Pepper was right. Obadiah Stane was just trying to rile him up, and Steve wouldn’t let him succeed. His eyes traveled to Tony.
The robot inside the cockpit made a grab for Steve as soon as he had smashed the driver’s window, but was repelled momentarily by another shot from Bucky’s gun. Steve grabbed the robot by the helmet and threw it through the air, and—accidentally—right into Bucky, who had landed on the SUV as well.
,” he pointed down on Steve’s erection, and on a second thought, he gently thumbed its head, “on love and air alone, I’m not a quitter. I mean… big fan of your dick, really, but that’s not gonna be fun for anyone.”
“Real?” Steve continued as he kissed down Tony’s throat hungrily. The one hand that wasn’t still holding Tony up came to rest on his arc reactor. “Feels real to me.”
The first rays of the morning were creeping out over the horizon, causing Steve to look around suspiciously. “Here,” he muttered as he skidded to a stop at the entry of some abandoned factory.
“But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul,” Tony went on. “Before he’d park it behind a desk. See the world, maybe be of service. Charlie didn’t go to Vegas, he didn’t go to Paris or Amsterdam. No, he decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where.”
“We can share the flight-time. You’re always jittery after battle.” Steve held out the pilot’s headset and waited. When Tony just kept staring at him, he let it drop to his side. “Or not.” He raised his eyebrows. “Do you have a problem with me flying?”
“Master Steve,” came Jarvis’ warm voice from the door. “I was asked to inform you that Mister and Mrs. Hogan have arrived along with Mister Rhodes. Master Anthony wonders when you’ll join them.”
“You’re a wartime-hero, Captain,” Coulson said. “One of the biggest in living memory. The world might be very different, but this country still remembers its heroes.”
Tony felt everything. Felt Steve’s blood rushing beneath his skin, the echoes of his heartbeat, and the gentle wisps of his breath. The molten heat of his half-hard center pressed against his hip. He would occasionally shift and murmur something, but he never made a move to leave his arms.
“This doesn’t have to be part of that arrangement,” Tony told him quietly. “I wasn’t sure if you wanted it, so I waited until you made the first move.”
Tony's amused huff at that was swallowed by the next kiss—shorter, a little more forceful—and when Steve broke that one, he glanced quickly up the stairs. The meeting should be going on for at least another hour, and Steve couldn't imagine sitting through it right now, not when Tony was here and they could just...
Tony stared up at him in confusion, before he looked sideways. The Hulk had apparently just made his big entrance and thus knocked over a giant air-stair. And it had landed right where Tony had stood.
“Oh, really? Imagine how much I care about that right now. I’m not gonna let him kill you while you’re waving the white flag around.”
He thrashed in Steve’s hold, sputtering threats to have him sued for child abuse, and emotional manipulation, and deprivation of liberty, and a bunch of other things that only had Steve laugh out loud. Tony wiggled in his grip some more, glaring daggers because what the
It was a silent walk back to the van that would bring the others right to the Triskelion. Natasha and Fury would head straight for Pierce’s conference with the WSC, while Steve would make his way to the first targeting console. Thor and Clint had already left the safe house half an hour ago, trying to take out the Northern carrier before it even took off, while Maria, Bruce and Tony would watch the perimeter from afar, trying to stop the launch in time. They all knew that chances for that to happen were close to zero, but they had to try.
With a small shrug, Steve smiled and shook his head. "I know, Tony. At first it… Well, that doesn't matter anymore." He glanced at the TV just in time to see a massive amount of policemen storming the grassland. This movie had been inexplicable from the get go, but the ending just seemed completely disconnected. "Thanks for clarifying that, though."
"That went well," he said, and despite everything, Tony laughed, which made him smile back. He wanted… He wanted to see Tony smile. Wanted to alleviate the discomfort of having to sit through whatever that had been. He wanted so much that he couldn't quite put into proper words without causing irreparable damage. So instead of saying anything, he just stepped closer and waited for Tony to make a move.
Suddenly, the sound of footsteps filtered through, followed by arms wrapping around his waist. Steve’s scent enveloped him, and he pulled Tony to his chest as though he was his lifeline, his hands drawing artless patterns of warm affection across his arms.
“It’s been sixteen years for them,” Steve reminded her with a shake of the head. “And anyway, I don’t know much about them, they were kinda… reclusive. I wouldn’t know where to start looking.”
The sensual drag of flesh against flesh was testing Steve's resolve, Tony so intoxicatingly close and eager… But it was Tony's request, his question, that brought Steve back to his original plan. Yes, they could get off like this, but it wouldn't be as satisfying. Steve's brain was still addled with battle-adrenaline and the dread he'd felt when he saw Tony heading into this building, and he needed to have as much as Tony was willing to give.
Steve nodded once, one of his hands settling on Tony's thighs and his fingertips slightly digging in. The second Steve exhaled a shaky breath, Tony pushed forward. It was a tight fit at first, and Tony watched Steve's eyes widen when he breached him, but the slide was wet and easy, so Tony only paused for a moment, before he thrust all the way inside.
, were his eyes ever blue. “You remember that I told you Nat and I went back to Camp Lehigh, when the whole thing with Pierce went down?”
Only when Rhodey spotted him walking in, a jolt seemed to go through his body. In a flash, he heaved himself to his feet and all but stormed over to him, pulling Tony into a fierce hug.
He could feel her eyes on him through the mirrored glass, but the stare wasn’t intrusive. “The first few times we met, you always used to tell me you were nothing more than a ghost. And for a long time, I thought you were right.” She turned around, then, pressing up against him. “You stopped telling me this years ago, James. And I know you can’t see it, because you don’t remember, but you
When Steve woke up in the morning, Tony was still lying flat on the couch. He’d yanked off his shirt sometime during the night, but otherwise he was still fully dressed, down to his shoes.
A moment passed, and Steve decided to let actions speak. It wouldn't be the first time he worked on nothing but instinct. Moving slowly so Tony wouldn't be surprised and could stop him if he wanted to, Steve reached to hug him.
. He found himself flashed back—the two of them standing in front of his old apartment in Brooklyn. Steve still in the suit he’d worn for his mother’s funeral, Bucky’s hand on his shoulder. So he voiced those words that Bucky had said to him back then, and they felt familiar, too. Felt right. Felt more like a reassurance than a plea.
The next punches Bucky dished out on him were more forceful and when he grabbed for just another knife, slashing down at him, Steve couldn’t put enough counter pressure on the metal arm before the blade embedded itself right into his upper chest.
Barnes, however, shot him a look and held the Scotch out of reach, mercifully not saying what Tony already knew: He’d had enough for the night.
He felt so far removed from the man who’d once stepped into the Iron Man suit and decided to take on the world on his own. There were too many doubts rooted in his blood now.
“If we ever want to defeat Thanos,” Strange said, “we need the combined force of all heroes, and you know it. If the Avengers hadn’t fallen apart before he came here, if we had been a united force, we could’ve beaten him. Now it’s too late.”
“Yes, yes, I’m back. Calm down, for heaven’s sake,” Tony told the robot, then looked up at Steve. “Steve, that’s Dummy. Dummy—Steve.”
When Tony boarded his private jet the next morning, the phone in his back pocket vibrated. He flipped it open and looked down on the display, a smile tugging at his lips.
It was still weird, seeing him with the new hair cut, but the smartass grin was definitely the same in every timeline.
A sigh. “No, I wouldn’t,” Tony said, pressed up against Steve and… well. There surely wasn’t anything
“You’ve got nothing to stay for,” Stane went on, his lips almost pressing against Steve’s ear. “You’ve got nothing to
Vision chuckled. He sat down on the couch next to Tony, and his gaze zoomed in on Ian. Ian’s big blue eyes were wide as they stared up at the strange red figure, and he giggled when Vision got so close that he could reach for his nose.
“Someone has to tell Stark to shut off the damn alarm, that’s what,” Bucky said, and felt Nat chuckling above him.
After adoption had been out of the picture, Tony’s mind had toyed with the various forms of surrogacy, but when they’d talked about it, it was clear as day that Steve was uncomfortable with the idea of paying someone to carry their child. He’d
“Sounds like fun.” Peter grinned as he stood up, reaching for his backpack. “Gotta go, May is waiting for me. Thanks for lunch Mr. Stark.”
“Doesn’t have to be that way,” Peter said. “He’ll just want someone who takes him serious. That’s the big secret.”
Steve knew that he was—at least on a physical level—attracted to Tony. And he knew Tony must be attracted to him, too. It didn’t get much clearer than masturbating to someone’s picture, right?
Steve snorted when he saw what annoyed Tony so much. The robot had somehow managed to get completely tangled within a few cables. Its claw hung low in the air, almost as if it were ashamed.
Soon after, they were huddling beneath their shelter, the blanket drawn around them both as they stared at the torrent of raindrops.
“’Oh heck’?” Tony echoed. “You even talk like him. The star-spangled man with a plan, huh? You’ve got any plans for tonight?”
“I want to feel you,” Steve said, smiling as he took the condom from Tony, and put it on the bed. “Now would probably be a good time to tell you that Natasha gave me one of those tablets right? My research was pretty all-encompassing.”
Tony breathed a heady sigh, before he nodded, his hands skimming to his jeans pocket. He produced a little bottle and swallowed before pressing it into Steve’s hand.
“You’ll find a way,” Steve said, and Tony sighed as he folded his hand around the paper card. He stood up again, and walked back to Steve. Then, he sat down next to him, and handed it over.
Here's the promised Bonus Chapter! There's some non-Stony sexual situations in here (You may all guess which pairing it is), so if you mind that, you might wanna skip this Bonus Chapter, it won't strictly be necessary for the next installment of the verse, but I'd recommend to just skip those passages and read the rest, since there's still some minor plot-development in here.
Bruce cleared his throat. “Some of you aren’t going to like it,” he warned. “Okay, all of you aren’t going to like it.”
He hugged back instinctively. And when his mind caught up with him the reasoning came crashing in, excuses lining up to explain away why he was hugging a yet-underage student. He didn't pull away, though he tried to keep the hug friendly-professional, no important parts touching, with his own hands safely resting at the center of Tony's back.
His thoughts were always there with him, wondering if he was okay, if he had slept well that day, or what he was doing now that he wasn’t jogging in New York, playing with Ian, reading his history books, or doodling in Tony’s shop.
what had happened on that day. Hell, he could still smell the nighttime alleys he'd run through in his memories...
Steve breathed a long sigh. He wasn’t so sure that would be enough, but didn’t find it in himself to worry Tony even more.
That was impossible, wasn’t it? The day had left Steve little more than tired and confused, and the night wasn’t looking to be any better. He had spent a lot of time trying to understand his encounter with Tony. The underlying meaning, but unsurprisingly, his efforts were to little avail. And now, he really wasn’t sure how to react. Tony was here again, and it was the
Tony shrugged. “Everyone loves parties. If I just call them, they’ll probably think the project is a hoax. They have to see it. We’ll send invitations to Reed, Pym. All of them. If just
Rhodey sighed. “To be honest: Indries’ loved sailing far more than Tony ever did. She loved the ocean. So after they got married, the room was hers.”
"Morbid," Steve commented, surveying the shelves along the walls. "Can you check if this place will hold?" he asked absently, and on a second thought, reached to grab something from the top shelf. He considered it for a beat, before letting out an amused snort and deciding that would
Tony nodded as well, his shoulders relaxing again. “You know…” he started. “I know I should be hoping that they find us soon, but… it’s actually the first time I’ve been able to relax in a very long time. And I… I like it here.”
Steve grinned, turning around somewhat to give Tony a sloppy kiss to the nose that had him wrinkle it in disgust immediately. “Remember that when you take over for me tomorrow.”
“It’s been so long since I’d reached any form of happiness,” Tony whispered, reverently. “But I think you could make me happy.”
Instead of answering, Tony bent down, and had the audacity to wiggle his brows at Steve before he sucked him down to the hilt.
When he leaned back, Steve’s face was flushed, and Tony smiled at him. Sitting up a bit, Tony reached for his back pockets and pulled out his phone. Steve sported an adorably confused expression when he typed on it for a moment, but understanding dawned soon after, as the workshop’s glass front blackened out.
She glanced to the pillow on his bed, then back at him. “Get some sleep, now. Or do I have to knock you out?”
There was a moment of silence. The wind had finally died down until it was barely perceptible, but rain began to swirl down out of the dark sky. Most of the guests were gone now; there were still Bucky and Natasha standing together by the edge of the cemetery. A few former SHIELD agents, who may or may not be still working for Phil were also standing not far off.
Tony pulled the goggles from his head. He was silent for a beat longer, but eventually, he spoke up. Future or past—it seemed Tony was always bad with silences. “You alright?”
Nothing. Steve drew in an unnecessary breath, hardly aware of the moisture clouding his eyes. The tension wrought in his body tightened rather than released.
Tony snorted, and nodded. Something in his tense posture shifted then, and Bucky could see as he visibly relaxed. “Alright,” Tony said, “let’s get this thing done?”
He aimed a strained smile in Steve’s direction when he caught his glance. The contamination chamber’s door had opened, the light within the room green once more, and Tony slowly rose to his feet.
“I wasn’t gonna,” he explained, and somehow, he deeply didn’t care if she believed him or not. What did it matter now anyway?
Steve remained silent. He knew better than to ask any questions at this point. This was… already more than he ever,
Steve sighed, looking around. “Well, I hope we'll be friends. This sort of life is new to me, but… I want to make Tony happy, too.”
Fix this? There wasn’t anything to fix. Nevertheless, and against his better judgment, Steve found himself following Tony into his personal space.
“If I recall correctly… wrap-up was your job,” he murmured, while leaning sideways as much as he could.
He still saw T’Chaka’s son behind closed eyelids. The anguish, the hurt, and the beginnings of something very dangerous. The beginnings of rage and a fierce wish for vengeance.
He looked down at his baby boy, who might or might not have made a vague motion with his left arm that might or might not be pointing towards the Spider-Man rompers.
Tony raised a brow in mock-question. So there was a jammer inside the phone. As if that’d keep him. Before he could say something, however, Steve had seemed to come to the same conclusion.
For the first time in his life, Steve felt utterly content. And he would be alright to just lie here with Tony like this for as long as he would let him.
“Yeah, I got that. Imagine my surprise when Natasha asked me to go looking for myself.” Tony turned around and cocked his head.
It was sweet, Steve defending him. Tony smiled to himself, his thumb running circles over the back of Steve’s hand. There might’ve been a time when he wouldn’t even have bothered speaking up for himself, but he knew now that Obi had zero right to call him any names.
Steve turned around, staring to where the Winter Soldier got back on his feet. “I need you to have my back for this,” he told Tony with a firm voice, taking hold of his shield.
Their work was too important, and there simply was no one else to do it. So many things had gone wrong already, but they still had a chance to make it right. Accepting an institution—
“Did you install a sex swing? Or is this the moment you’re telling me you’re awfully into threesomes? ‘Cause I suddenly feel like we should’ve had that talk before making with the whole ‘til death-part’, you know?”
Everyone around them seemed to drop, drained of energy, as Tony leaned back in his suit, glad it was holding him up for the time being.
“Sadly, he doesn’t know much about interdimensional travel, yet,” Tony added. “He doesn’t know much about anything.”
Naturally, whenever Steve heard that line, he only raised his shield a little higher, aiming it at the speaker. “Don’t think I’ll be doing that.”
“I’m…” He paused, and shook his head, a small self-deprecating smile now gracing his lips. “What I am is terribly bad at this,” he said on a low breath. He looked up at Tony then, staring straight at him.
Steve was convincing himself he wasn't moping about the whole thing as he peered into his fridge. "Pizza works?" he asked, only receiving a grunt in response. He shook his head and sighed. "Use words."
Pepper’s phone chirped, and after she had hummed a few times, listening to whoever it was on the other side, she turned her serious gaze back on Tony.
Sam scoffed. “Excuse me? I served for years before I even joined Air Force. They made me go through another
Steve laughed, and turned back around to arrange the last cupcakes. “So, what did you wish for?” he asked.
"Listen to me very carefully," Steve said, his voice lowered to a mere hiss. He knew he didn't have more than a few seconds to make a point before Stane regained his bearings and tried fighting back. That would make words redundant, and Steve preferred words to outright violence. "You will treat Tony with respect. Do we understand each other?"
Mister Hammer stopped him with another raised brow. “Do you have a problem with that, Steven?” His voice carried the hint of a threat.
“Did I tell you that she once nicked a ten-thousand dollar whiskey from dad?” Tony leaned in to whisper, a little dumbly, and Steve almost laughed at the idea. Instead, though, he raised Tony’s knuckles briefly to his mouth. One kiss to the bump of his knuckles, and then to the bones of his fingers. He hoped it wasn’t too scandalous. With the way Tony inched closer, he figured it was probably not.
had dumped on him. God, he really hated dark, confined spaces. And he hated being slimy, and sweaty, and all-over gross.
The lights were real bright. Once his eyes had gotten used to it, he realized how many people were currently in the cafeteria, all of them looking like they belonged into another time-line.
“No, it’s…” Steve shook his head as if to clear it. Some part of him desperately wanted to reach out and hug that past version of Tony, tell him that he wouldn’t be alone forever, that
Clint nodded, like this happened often, taking a few steps towards the little girl. “Why, she having a date tonight?”
Veronica was a great help. Caring for Ian was now a full-time job for her, and she basically followed Tony around every day to handle him whenever Tony couldn’t.
Tony smiled at him, settling a hand on Fury’s shoulder as he led him a little ways off the dance-floor. Steve followed them.
“What’s the serious face for?” Tony’s voice brought him out of his thoughts, and Steve hadn’t even realized that the others had already taken their seats around the dinner table. Tony cradled Ian in his arms, gently hopping him up and down a bit.
“We forced his hand, because Ross forced ours,” Rhodey said, then sighed. “I said a few things to Steve I shouldn’t have.”
Tony hummed in what might be agreement, and walked further into the room. “I see no one has grown any new body parts,” he announced as he flopped down on the couch next to Steve. “Or burst into flames or something, so we should count that as a win.”
Tony tossed his head back and his fingers clutched Steve’s shoulders. “Yeah, well,” he mumbled with all remaining eloquence. “Been a while.”
Tony hadn’t heard from Natasha and Bruce in over a week. All communication systems were down. Steve, Sam and Barnes—they had kept loose contact, fighting the fight in Europe with their own team. They hadn’t exactly worked together since Thanos had arrived—they’d only been on a need-to-know talking base, calling each other once a week to make sure they were still alive and fighting.
He’d almost lost him today. After he’d just found him. And he could only imagine what he’d gone through.
He and Tony… they worked surprisingly well together. Spending the day with him was, miraculously, no hardship at all. He just hoped Tony wouldn’t forget all this when they got back home. Without the ever-present baggage of the past, everything felt so very… natural. And Steve just wished that when they were back home, a little, just a little of what Tony was seeing in him now would remain.
Tony pulled back at that, looking down at him. “You do?” he asked softly, an awed look flashing across his beautiful face. “You wanna stay here?”
Steve’s plan was good, no question—nearly infallible with everyone’s cooperation, and that was what made Tony nervous. They were always relying greatly on absolutes, and he couldn’t help reciting all those other possibilities.
It must’ve been around the sixth morning following Mister Hammer’s illness that Steve realized that… that… he might be falling in love.
Steve had seen most of the video material before—most of it was propaganda. And yet, he couldn’t believe what he was seeing and remained cemented firmly in his position as the images unfolded beat by beat on screen.
“We are. Unfortunately,” the blond man—Agent Barton—explained. “It has her initials. And the police has been searching Mrs. Stark’s boat for a long while.”
“I carried you there.” Steve frowned in concern. “Do you think you should go to medical? Or see a doctor? Passing out like that is probably not good. Might be a sign of something serious.”
. I sat in my workshop, seething, drinking… hating her. Thinking about the mess of a life I’d allowed her to create for me. I remember that I thought… I couldn’t possibly spend the rest of my life like that. So, after my third or fourth glass of scotch, I was so drunk that I went down to the boathouse to confront her. But I never dreamed I’d do what I did… you have to believe me…”
"You didn't have to." Steve knew he was agitated, and not just because of Bucky. The kiss was still on his mind despite it all. He was still questioning his course of action with Tony. "We both got enlisted and you got the short end of it. It was my fault and I couldn't—" He hitched a breath. "Couldn't face it. Couldn't face you."
Steve sighed, drawing Tony in and burying his own face in Tony’s neck. “I just found you,” he whispered. “I won’t let them take you away from me.”
Instead, he lay down on the floor as well, settling in right behind Tony. He couldn’t pretend he didn’t want to drape his whole self around him, and he wouldn’t. Pressing a kiss onto Tony’s neck, Steve wrapped his arms around him tightly. Gently, he picked up one of Tony’s hands, and lightly kissed each knuckle before placing both of their hands, palm down, onto the arc reactor.
His tongue ran several laps along Steve’s cock, licking him clean, his eyes refusing to leave him. When he was done, he brushed a last kiss on the tip and straightened back up.
Natasha’s expression was suddenly far away. “You of all people should know best what he’s going through,” she said softly.
“Are you even listening?” Tony said on a snort, which promptly turned into a low groan as Steve’s hand started to stroke his flaccid dick in even motions.
“Stay,” Steve said simply and pushed his pants down, pulling them off with his boots. When he looked up, Tony was just turning on the shower faucet. Steve stared at the water that streamed down for a moment, mesmerized by the cloud of steam.
It wasn’t that he was intentionally avoiding Tony, just… being in the same room with him felt a lot like someone choking him with both hands. He
With another parting kiss against his forehead, he leaned back again, taking a low breath. “And when I turn eighteen, we can… make this official, yeah?”
When Tony sat down on the bench in front of Barnes’ room, the man in question was sitting on his bed with open eyes. His face didn’t have that empty, numb expression anymore. Instead, he was looking at Tony with a look that was half annoyance and half curiosity.
He felt bleary-eyed and punchy. He’d been on the phone for nearly—looking down on his watch, he tried to calculate exactly how many hours he’d spent working with Maria on preparing their next hearing, and couldn’t come up with an accurate number. His head felt like mush. His legs were cramped, his posterior was numb, and he had a pounding headache that was slowly growing into a full blown migraine of mammoth proportions.
"You look like shit," Bucky greeted as he walked in from the corridor. He was holding two beer bottles in his hand as he approached, and handed one to Steve.
Tony’s jaw twitched, and Steve could see his knuckles going white as he gripped his coffee cup tighter. “I wish I could spare you the trouble, I really do,” Tony said, and he even sounded like he meant it. “But you’ve always told me that it’s our duty to save the world, Steve. Live or die. This looks like our only hope to keep doing that.”
Tony breathed in deep. “We were…” His eyes drifted past Steve, searching for the right words. “Well… we
“I’d only bore you,” Tony said at last, though it was clearly only a flimsy excuse. “Suit doesn’t work and I’m out of practice.”
In a matter of seconds, Tony found himself hanging in Steve’s hold. He chuckled against Steve’s lips, barely noticing that they left the room with the way Steve’s kisses were robbing him of each and every brain cell he possessed.
Thor had temporarily gained the upper hand on the men. He knocked them across the stockroom and into another set of shelves, too busy to notice their entrance. Natasha didn’t notice either, as she was pummeling Rumlow. She raised her arms, activating her Widow Bites.
His gaze dropped to Rhodey’s healthy, undamaged legs briefly, and he reached for his hand. “You were the last one I saw in my timeline. We lost contact with all of the others at some point. But you and me, we stuck together till the end.”
He and Steve had discussed it a lot, whether or not they should be telling the others. Earlier today, Steve did announce that there was no reason to be afraid of him, but Tony had seen it in the others’ eyes. They’d never trust him like this.
. Nearing his fifties, Tony was apparently becoming the kind of guy who needed to put a name on something or else he’d go insane.
you’ve achieved, in just a few weeks.” Steve abandoned his quest of Tony’s throat, working down his body. “As I said, I’m feeling incredibly…” He tongued his way across Tony’s thigh. “…grateful…”
Steve shook his head, realizing he couldn’t talk about it. He just needed proof Tony was real. He needed proof he wasn’t hallucinating within a dream. Thus, with conviction, he pulled his head back just slightly and cupped Tony’s cheeks, kissing him. Steve wanted to crawl up inside him—he wanted Tony to feel the thundering beat of his heart and taste the tears on his lips and realize that this was the only thing that kept him upright right now.
“Officially, Bucky just killed a Head of State and about three dozen other people, Steve. Yes, he could definitely do that. Might already have. And Austria’s authorities is a whole other matter.”
He couldn’t though, because the others were holding them captive with their post-party chatter and some trying-to-lift-Thor’s-hammer competition. And Tony didn’t want to be the party pooper and ask them to give his old-man-bones a break.
“I should’ve grabbed that bomb,” he said. “I’m the leader. I should’ve dealt with it. He talked about Bucky, said we were doing HYDRA a favor and I just… He got to me, and I slipped. People died, and it’s on me.”
“Probably,” Steve agreed distractedly. He couldn’t really get the depths of Tony’s eyes right, and it was starting to go on his nerves.
“Couldn’t wait,” Tony said idly, waving a hand in Steve’s general direction. “You owe me like… fifty orgasms over the course of the last three months. I thought it was best to get on with the program as long as I can still keep up with you.”
He gave Steve’s ass a light squeeze, then leaned up a bit, mouth now close to his ear. “What would you say if I told you I’m prepped and ready to go?”
And now, here they were: getting simultaneously shot at by Klaue’s goons, Tony’s rogue robots and Ultron himself. And occasionally, Steve was thrown to the floor by Pietro Maximoff doing the rounds on the various levels of the old ship. Things really were going just
After everything he’d changed, everything he’d done, it seemed he simply couldn’t change the way the world was turning. Maybe if he’d been honest with Steve from the start, maybe if he’d told him what was going on—or maybe that would’ve made things worse, there was really no way to tell.
Tony also still had this on and off thing with Pepper going—and he was straight, as far as Steve knew.
The others sat motionless on the floor, staring off into space as if still in shock. Wanda had buried herself in Pietro’s arms, not showing her face for the entirety of the flight. The only one who looked remotely calm was Sam, who piloted the Quinjet. He kept throwing questioning glances at Steve, but for once, he didn’t have any consoling words.
Natasha pursed her lips, and regarded him for a long moment, before she started to speak. “We worked together for the KGB for a few years—or HYDRA. Can’t really be sure about that anymore.” There was a moment’s consideration, her gaze not swaying from Tony’s face. “He had part in my training, and after that, they had us go on a few missions together, most of them overseas. I was still very young, so I regarded him as some kind of mentor. He didn’t mean much of anything to me, aside from being someone I looked up to. He was never… awake for more than a week at a time and every time we met again, he had no idea who I was.”
“I’m sorry to interrupt,” a cold, confused sounding voice ushered. “I was asleep. Or… I was a dream?”
A tiny smile flickered across Steve’s face. “I was thinking I’d give you a few more hours to recover, but…” He sighed. “Wanda keeps telling the team you’re dangerous. The twins are here and—you were right. They sound willing enough to stick around, but they refuse to make a decision until we know what’s going on with you. Wanda, she… she seemed afraid of you.”
“I’m sorry, Steve,” Tony said, as he reached for Steve’s hand. “I was… I’m sorry I didn’t say much of anything when you asked me to meet you, I…” He took a deep breath. “Trust me, it was the truth when I said there’s literally nothing I’d like to do more than meet you in person.”
At first, Steve had been a bit intimidated by what was awaiting him now. Tony obviously knew about his attraction to him, and he would likely also know that Steve didn’t have a lot of experiences with…
A sigh. Tony leaned back in his chair, his sunglasses firmly in place, and took another sip of his Frappuccino. “And you haven’t changed your mind?” He didn’t address anyone in particular, but it was clear who he was talking to.
Tony shrugged with a shameless grin. “Me? Brag?” He exchanged a conspiratorial glance with Steve. “Perish the thought.”
, and I grew up hearing stories about you, but one thing was always very clear: One day, you vanished from earth, and you never came back!”
“It’s true.” Tony shrugged. “I never said we suddenly became different people. We just… learned to actually listen to each other. That was the hard part, because once we’d managed
Steve tossed him a narrow glance over his shoulder. “Again?” he retorted, as he carried the last two plates to the table.
“All right,” Steve called out, drawing everyone’s attention to him. “Hawkeye and I are gonna sweep the deck and find Batroc. Widow, you’ll kill the engines and wait for instructions. Rumlow, you and your team sweep aft, find Sitwell and the hostages in the galley. Get them to life pods. Let’s get them out.”
of something that felt so much bigger than him, and the gratitude to just be here, to be able to touch Tony like this—all wrapped in one.
Natasha remained quiet and unmoving. Long minutes went by before she opened her mouth again. “It’s not a nice story,” she said, then added, “But if you really want to know, I will tell you.”
Tony sat up a bit, leaning sideways and producing a small bottle from the nightstand. He showed it to Steve, and he recognized some sort of oil that Tony now poured over his fingers.
“It’s about the shooter,” Natasha said, awfully quiet, forcing the words out as if each syllable was painful to utter. “I knew him. Long before Odessa. We worked for the KGB together for several years. We were…”
Tony snorted, and the two of them stared each other down for long lost moments. There was something in Steve’s eyes, something that Tony had often dreaded to find there one day. Resignation. Steve looked at him as though he’d just accepted that this was the way things were with Tony, and while he understood it, he wasn’t sure if he could live with it forever.
Tony was already drifting off, though, and after a few minutes, Steve got up and went to his bedroom. He didn’t move once he’d lain down, still fully dressed, only staring at the wall in front of him.
Tony’s eyes flickered back to their brown color. He stared at Steve as though he had just awoken from a horrible dream and his mouth opened and closed in a futile try to find the right words. “Steve…” he echoed, grabbing for his hands and pulling him nearer. “I didn’t
It took a moment for Steve to work through the innuendo. When he did, though, his eyes went wide. “You really believe I would think something like that?”
A surprised chuckle left Steve’s lips as he looked up. He hadn’t even realized how much he’d missed that voice. “Back at you, JARVIS.”
So Steve made quick work of packing, then left his room while Mister Hammer was off, making last preparations for their travel. He entered the long stretch of corridor, walking towards the part of the hotel where he knew the luxury suites were located.
“Can’t share what I don’t have,” Tony quipped and pressed a kiss on Ian’s forehead. “Your father goes where he goes, and he never tells me, isn’t that right, darling?”
Tony cracked a wry grin, his eyes sizing Steve up. “If you think I will stop you now, you really haven’t been paying attention.”
What he missed most was her unimpressed face, though, complete with crossed arms and suspicious eyes. Her cute ‘don’t-mess-with-me’ attitude that had made him fall a little harder for her every time. It was no use. When she’d wake up, she wouldn’t be there.
He probably looked uneasy, and Pepper’s sharp eyes noticed it immediately. “Have you been alone long?”
Steve stayed motionless for another beat before rolling onto his side and sliding his hand down under the covers to join Tony's over his hard on. He pressed close, allowing his own erection to rub against Tony's side.
That surprised Tony. “What for? Afraid none of the other kids are gonna want to sit with you at lunch?”
, smiling and making jokes every other minute. Naturally, the two had fixed the wing in no time, and while Steve wasn’t wholly sure he understood what Tony was doing, he had a feeling he was already fine-tuning the engine by now. All the while, Tony explained things in a low voice, occasionally handing Cooper a screwdriver so he could put the various parts back together.
He hadn’t known how to reply, so he hadn’t said anything at all and only watched as the others left the room.
Right now, Tony was directing Mark Forty-One through the sky, flanking Thor’s side as he and Clint made their way to the second carrier. At some point, Tony had watched Steve running around the deck of the Southern carrier, but as soon as it had taken off, he’d disappeared into one the lower decks.
He tended to Barnes’ hand methodically. They all had some basic medical knowledge by now, and while Tony’s was probably the worst, he was still able to clean and disinfect some cuts and scrapes.
He smiled. “Audrey,” he said, and for reasons beyond him, he raised a hand and brushed a strand of hair out of her face. “He called you Audrey.”
Well, Steve thought as he stared after him. Maybe it shouldn’t be as surprising… how fast things could settle back to how it had been before. With the two of them taking opposing directions as soon as they were given the chance.
“He feels deeply for you,” Natasha eventually went on. “I know because I tried to talk him out of it many times. We fought about you,
Tony returned the smile in kind, then put his right hand onto the table, right in the middle, looking at Steve in question.
It was still early in the morning when Steve found himself standing in front of a large bathroom mirror. He stared at his own face for a long time, looking into his eyes until the objects in the background faded into a mass of blurred shapes.
As if in a haze, Steve walked into the dressing room, opening one of the many closets warily. Those were clearly Tony’s clothes, but beside them…
He intercepted him, slipping the buttons of Tony’s shirt loose one by one, licking every inch of his skin as it became exposed, sliding his shirt away smoothly.
“You’re not arrogant,” Steve whispered. “You wanted to do good. The Maximoff girl played you, sure, the vision forcing you into action. And maybe it blindsided you into taking risks you wouldn’t have on a normal day, but your intentions were undeniably good. I see that now.”
Tony probably wouldn't be able to keep standing like this for much longer, so he kissed him under the ear and pressed tighter against him before pulling him a few paces away from the wall. "Got an idea… Lean against me," he instructed, and carefully lowered them onto their knees on the floor, with Tony's undersuit for cushion. "Okay?"
Everyone scrambled for his position, and in the blink of an eye, Tony saw Steve running for him—throwing his shield at him. It hit the blast straight-on, redirecting it…
Tony’s eyes twinkled as he cocked his head. “You don’t have to answer,” he replied, licking those sinful lips of his. “I can see how hard you still are.” He stepped closer again and ran a comforting hand down Steve’s arm.
Tony gave off a robotic huff, as soon as the faceplate shut down, and grabbed Clint around the waist. Together they sped to the stretch of rock wall, and side by side, Steve and Natasha began to climb. Once more, Steve inwardly patted his own shoulder that he always nagged all of them for sparring sessions. Their bodies were accustomed to exertion—and along with the missions, they’d never been short on action. The climb wasn’t much of a problem. Finding footholds, hands grappling for a nook to fortify, and sure enough, Natasha reached the ground a couple of seconds before him. He wasn’t surprised. Even with the serum, he couldn’t hold a candle to her when it came to agility.
Truthfully, this sort of assignment was usually done without the Avengers’ help. It was all very basic. Charge in, free the hostages, leave. Something Fury only sent them on to allot a breath of fresh air. Maybe Steve should’ve questioned their being here a bit more. If he’d given it more thought, he’d realized there had to be more to it than just a hostage situation.
Steve moved a little faster now—and Tony was keeping up. Faster still—and Tony was holding his own. It made him try a few new moves, and he barely managed to pull his punch in time before clipping Tony across the jaw. Tony had frozen up and Steve had come right under his guard.
to belong, and maybe that was the whole problem. Maybe it was time to finally accept the cards he’d been dealt, instead of running in circles for the rest of his life.
Steve stared down to the river, and he struggled for consciousness, but his limbs were heavy and he felt himself drifting into blackness. Feeling drained from him. He vaguely heard Tony giving orders, but did not possess the clarity to identify the words.
The relief that washed over Steve was tainted with guilt. What did it matter, really, if they'd actually had sex or not? The only reason it mattered was that at least Steve didn't forget something as important as that. Morally speaking, the lines had been crossed long before he'd even brought Tony into his home. Legally speaking, he would already be in trouble if Tony chose to expose what had been going on between them.
A part of Steve wasn’t sure anymore if the last two months had even transpired the way he remembered they had. If he and Tony had really been as close as it had felt to Steve—or if he’d maybe read the situation completely wrong. He certainly still remembered holding Tony close during the storms, or swimming with him in the river. He remembered Tony telling him about how he’d become Iron Man, and he remembered soft smiles and even softer looks.
She raised her thin hands, twirling her fingers as red flashes of light danced around them, and the next second, Steve felt himself getting pushed to the ground, face first.
It struck Steve that Tony in bed was an experience to be had with all the senses. Tony responded to even the lightest shift in touch, squirmed and sighed, moaned at times, making Steve's resolve slowly crumble. He had two fingers inside him when Tony spoke. He contemplated the tightness around his fingers, deeming it loose enough.
"That bad, huh…" Bucky seemed to consider for a moment, then sighed. "Alright, sit down, let's talk."
There was a pause. “And, on the off chance that you can hear me, I… I understand what you said. About needing time. And, I would give it to you, if I knew I’d have another chance, but… this might be it, right? Who knows what comes after this, if there’s even an ‘after this’. I just… I really like you, Steve. In a completely not-platonic way. Well, also in a platonic way, but… yeah, you get the drift. And I think you at least find me attractive, right? So on the off chance that we won’t be seeing each other after this trip is over, I want to make the most of the time we have…”
Getting his second doctorate had been pretty uneventful, all things considered. He’d written his dissertation ages ago, and with his project finished, Tony was only asked a bunch of questions and then filled out some forms. They handed him his certificate, congratulated him for about four hours and that was it.
“Not a recording,” Tony said, his eyes twitching back and forth between his own brown eye color and the typical oily blackness of Extremis.
Without waiting another second, Steve bent down. He pulled Ian against his chest, peppering kisses over his face with a smiling mouth. His body suddenly seemed to thrive with life, as Ian molded perfectly against him.
“Well, if you had to name one point in time that set off the chain reaction, leading to the team’s downfall, when would it be?”
Steve blinked as his eager eyes took Tony in. Long gone was the cocky young man. Tony was still beautiful, of course, still boyishly handsome, and he’d obviously aged very well, but there was something world-weary in his features now. The face of a man who had lived a very hard life.
Rhodes sighed, pointing to the bunk beds above. “There’s a queen sized bed in the back, the sofas here can become a single bed each, and there’s a double bed in the bunk upstairs.”
Sam grinned at him, eyes shimmering with amusement. “You should’ve seen him these past few weeks. I knew something was bugging him, but I had no idea that bug was you.”
Tony swallowed as he turned around fully, taking in the tangible distance between them. Steve stood right in front of the entrance, eyes wide, fingers twitching next to where Tony knew he kept his gun.
“I had you,” he offered, as Pepper pressed a few buttons on the coffee machine. “And two cleaning crews.”
“The thing is, and I swear there is a point here: You changed a lot since you met Steve. I’m not saying that’s all his work, but the guy who got wasted at that party, and the guy here,” he clapped a hand on Tony’s knee, “there’s helluva difference. You decided to take responsibility for what happened with the team, and that’s all because you wanted to be a better man… for him.”
“Hey,” Tony prompted as he sat down across from Steve. It was half an hour later, and Ian was in the park with Veronica. Sam, Pietro and Natasha were sitting right next to Steve, looking infinitely tired as they munched on their breakfast cereals. The CIA gala hadn’t gone unnoticed by anyone.
,” Steve intoned gravely, throwing Tony’s words right back at him. He saw a row of modified Iron Legion suits flying by, and finally managed to get to his feet again, pressing his shield against one robot’s neck until Thor flew by and decapitated it with Mjolnir.
At the end, it only took them sixteen and a half minutes before the thin trail gave way to a clearing. Just a few meters away from them, a small log cabin stood in front of thick pine trees.
In that moment, Tony looked ready to pull his hair out. And yet, Steve had no trouble to still see his love, his devotion, and he needed to concentrate on that.
Steve’s eyes took it all in—and as expected, he stared at Tony’s wings for a very long time. There was even something akin to awe in his gaze. It was so very human of him. Even faced with the devil’s true form, he was still more hung up on those damned wings.
Hours later, the two of them were still crouched beneath the lean-to, rain dripping in steady intervals, soaking the ground beneath them—and this despite Tony having laid down several boughs of pine branches.
“Yeah.” Tony looked sideways at him, and smiled. His first genuinely happy smile since they’d had their big fight, and it made Steve’s insides sing. “We really should.”
Tony bit his lower lip in irritation and leaned back a little, letting his gaze drift over Steve's uniform. No red spots and no deeper cuts, that was a good sign. "You didn't get hit, did you?"
“Me?” Tony asked, his irritation spiking. He shook his head, then angrily snatched the piece of paper from under Steve’s hand. “I’m not the one who’s giving his number to random guys, so the real question is what has gotten into
"It's amazing," he said, getting a little light headed, like he was having a deja vu, and the next words out of his mouth came as though from another world.
He watched the two leave, and barely held back a snort when Happy gave him a thumbs-up followed by a broad grin before walking out the room.
Watching the liquid depths of Tony's eyes, Steve knew he was going to do whatever it took to keep this. Even if things with Tony could get difficult, occasionally—he was never one to back away from a challenge.
“I know, that’s not it,” Tony murmured. He seemed to contemplate whether or not he should be saying more, and likely came to the realization that while Vision might not be the best conversation partner, he was all he had at the moment. “It’s just that I don’t know how many more times I can make him go through this. You can’t know, but this… feels like the world’s worst déjà-vu.”
Tracing one hand upward to cup the arc reactor, Steve kissed him again. His movements over him remained unhurried but passionate. His fingers combed through Tony’s hair and scored soft trails down his shoulders. Tony’s body was getting more sensitive with each stroke, still on the good side of overstimulation, and he wanted Steve to take his pleasure. This was for him.
“Goddammit,” Tony rasped, moving against Steve, who changed rhythms at his own whim. Soft and hard at the same time—fast but agonizingly slow. Tony’s hands tightened on top of Steve’s, their hips battling. He tried to keep up, but by now, Steve was pounding into him so ruthlessly that he thought the goddamn barn would come crashing down soon.
This could not be a good idea, Steve thought as he followed Bucky's confident stride towards the elevator. For a man whose life wasn't exactly on the right track, Bucky had a carefree air about him that Steve envied, and the thought made him shake his head at himself. Envied Bucky? Really?
“I’ll go with them,” Natasha said softly, putting a hand on Steve’s shoulder as she stood up. “You go check on the mad scientists. See if they still got all their limbs attached.”
you around, that’s what this is! Are you really telling me you wanna try long-distance with a 3000 miles between us? These things never work out for anyone. And I don’t want to force you into trying.”
. And once his shoulders stopped aching and his heart didn’t throb with pain every time he closed his eyes and saw Erskine dying in his arms, he could find his hope again.
Tony pulled out the chair for Steve and waited patiently until he sat down. Then, he took the seat across from him and leaned back. “Cream or sugar?”
“He was always there,” he said softly, his voice even. He didn’t feel particularly sad about the whole thing—JARVIS was still there, after all, just… he’d evolved, outgrown his own self, and sometime in those last months, Tony had mostly made his peace with it.
He wondered if Tony thought of him this much when he was awake. He wondered if he thought of him at all. He was also wondering where Tony lived. He didn’t have any kind of accent, so Steve supposed he had to be American, maybe a New Yorker, too, but otherwise…
They stood like that for a long moment, and Bucky rubbed circles on his back with his hand. “I’m okay,” Steve said. He wasn’t, but he felt that Bucky needed to hear it.
Steve ducked his head, not knowing what to say to that. He hadn’t seen Tony smile a lot lately, to be honest. “I’m not sure I have any part in it.”
He came back to himself just as Tony’s own climax hit. His body had seized up again and his cock pulsed in his own hand and Steve thought that nothing was more beautiful than Tony’s face when he came.
Soon enough, his speed gained momentum. Grasping not too tightly, but not lose at all. Touching Steve with a blatant disregard for reservation. And never—not for a second—Tony removed his brow from Steve’s. He was keeping that intimacy. That touch. Kissing Steve’s lips every few seconds.
He should've known Tony's thinking would lead down this road, and wow he was lightheaded with how fast he'd gotten hard. Sometimes he was worried about keeping pace with Tony, but it never became an issue to this day.
Steve hummed then walked over to Tony. His eyes moved over Tony’s chest, obviously pleased. “You healed fast.”
Tony sighed, letting go of the arm for a moment. “I do. You’re the only one in the team with a decent taste for coffee. You can tease Steve even more than me. You make Nat giggle, which is as scary as it is awesome and most importantly, Ian adores you, and he’s my boss, so…” He looked at him, and there was nothing in his gaze that suggested he didn’t mean exactly what he said. “I was wary about you first. You and Steve, you have a history that, to be honest, made me kind of jealous. But you’re his best friend, and a decent person, I don’t see why we shouldn’t get along just fine.”
There was a sudden harsh note in his voice that hadn’t been there during their latest calls. And Steve would be lying if he said the shield that he withdrew from his bag didn’t come as a massive surprise. And now Tony was coming toward him, his body wracked with resentment and determination.
Peter looked down, though Tony caught the confusion in his eyes. “And you broke up over that lawsuit?”
It had begun a few days ago: the changes. Changes in Barnes’ behavior that had been small enough that they first escaped Bruce’s notice before slowly compiling in severity. He was talking more, mostly to Natasha, but even so: He was talking. He ate regularly, accepted new clothes, and the panic attacks came less frequently. The baby steps were over, obviously, and Tony figured that Barnes finally returned to something close to whoever he’d been before.
“Listen, we’ll bring them in. GSG9’s got the borders covered. Recons flying 24/7. They’ll get a hit.”
They went back to chopping wood in companionable silence, with Steve feeling much less alone than he had just a short time before.
“I thought you already did,” Steve answered bitterly, as soon as the others were out of hearing range.
He saw Steve’s cold eyes night after night, replaying those horrible moments in a cruel slow motion display. Pointing out his faults. Mulling over what he should have done. Playing a fantasy of what-ifs over and over. Stopping it before it was too late.
He was about to raise both hands and signal them that they wouldn’t make any problems, when, behind them, Steve saw the cat man running out of the house.
The words warmed Steve’s heart. He was so relieved that Vision and Tony had talked, and while they all knew that things weren’t the same and would never be again—Steve was sure they’d learn to live with this new situation.
He pulled Steve against his chest, moving them a few steps forward and Steve could only let it happen as his pants dropped to the floor. He stepped out of them, now fully naked, and let Tony lead him to the master bed.
In all his years, Steve reckoned he had never known such softness. It was all around him. Everywhere. Encompassing him with the pure radiance of suggestion.
“I’ll let you fuck me, but I won’t let you drive me nuts. You can’t make me forget how you made my whole life a living hell.”
The girl (she had introduced herself as Natalia Romanova) gave him a pointed look before she moved to stalk forward, closing in on their targets. They finished almost in tandem, like they’d done this a Hundred times before, pushing their knives into their target’s throats, rotating them once, before stalking forward.
“I have a lot of things,” Tony said quietly. “Time isn’t one of ‘em.” As soon as Obi put him into one of SI’s research labs, he wouldn’t be making anything but weapons. He would be putting all of his brains and effort into building things that’d destroy, that’d take lives. He sure wouldn’t have the time to finish something stupid like an arm on wheels.
When they reached the top of the stairs, Tony gave the common room a once-over through the large glass doors. Ugh, when Wilson had said ‘everyone’, he’d really meant that. Romanoff, the Maximov girl, Vision… that was bound to get interesting. He still wasn’t a hundred percent sure what to think about Vision—about Vision basically knowing
pulling him in. The kiss that followed was honey and tears, Steve’s nose resting against Tony’s cheek, his fingers threaded in the hair at his neck. His lips were softer than Tony remembered. Steve melted like molasses against his skin.
“Yeah,” Steve breathed, then groaned when Tony cupped his balls, while rearranging their position somewhat until their cocks aligned.
Tony said, his tone all concentrated and sterile. Steve watched the suit fly back and forth along the building, still shooting repulsor beams at the protective shield once in a while, discussing tactics with JARVIS.
,” he repeated, more forceful now. He closed his eyes, refusing to deal with this. All of it, the war, this whole
“You stopped drinking,” Steve commented as Tony leaned forward with as much grace as he could muster, reaching for the now-empty tumbler and refilling the glass.
, he was genuinely surprised. Up until now, Steve had been so upfront about his sexuality, as if he’d done everything under the sun and then some. He had said he’d had numerous one night stands, after all, so Tony had figured there wouldn’t be any firsts for either of them. Tony hadn’t been peeved about Steve’s recent encounters—really not—just a bit taken aback.
“Steve, can you…” Bruce prompted, waving at Tony’s armor, while he and Hill rushed to the next cabinet, scanning its content for what Tony hoped was morphine that hadn’t expired yet.
Steve sighed. He neared Tony cautiously, and wrapped his free arm around him from behind. He didn’t say anything to that, only held Tony, and Tony dropped his head against Steve’s chest, simply—if only for a moment—basking in the fact that the three of them were together again.
talking about his work, though, about machines he wanted to built, and things he wanted to invent, and it was all so far over Steve’s head, he could only listen to him in pure amazement.
Tony sighed, thinking about Steve. Still sleeping peacefully. Still blessedly unaware of what was to come. “I have to tell Steve, prepare him for this. I waited too long as it is.”
“Still got one or two apocalypses in me I think,” he said, and felt Tony laugh in his arms. “But… quitting for a while… sounds like a good idea.”
“If it doesn’t work,” Steve said quietly, but no less determined, “we’ll be left in a worse position than we are currently in.”
“So you know me?” Tony urged. He’d taken a step closer, and stared at him intently. “From some file, or…?”
God, Steve really shouldn't be thinking how attractive Tony was, especially not when he was so drunk, but thoughts were hard to control.
“Shit,” Natasha exhaled, and Steve realized he had never heard her curse before. So it had to be bad.
“What happened while I was out?” Tony asked, as he sat up with only the slightest wince. “You already talked to Fury?”
Looking at Steve, Tony probably shouldn’t find it more hot than worrisome, but age certainly had not made him any wiser, and Steve looked about ready to lay waste to whoever would wrong Tony.
The second the words left the robot’s modulator, Steve took hold of Tony’s arm and dragged him behind the table, pushing it over and taking cover behind it. Tony could see half a dozen Iron Legion suits suddenly swarming the air above them, shooting at everything that moved.
“And you’re being blindsided!” Steve shot back. It was the first time since knowing Tony that he’d raised his voice against him and all of a sudden, Tony looked at him as though Steve was a stranger—anyone but the man whom he slept beside at night. The lovely brown of eyes turned a stormy gray.
When he stepped into the bar, the hammering in his chest just confirmed how very much not ready he had been for this. For the image of Steve sitting at the bar, right next to two guys, all dressed up nicely, and writing down something that was likely his phone number or whatever.
"Alright," he said, leaning over closer. "Can you put the condom on me?" It was an open invitation, really. Steve would do it himself if the situation called for it.
How things had gotten so out of control so quickly, he didn’t know. All he knew was that he needed to touch Tony as much as he could before he’d leave again.
“H-how did my l-life turn into a B-brokeback M-mountain revival?” he asked as Steve wrapped his arms around him, pressing against him until they were touching from shoulder to feet. Tony wrapped himself around Steve, too. His hands were cold as ice, and Steve shivered and had to stop himself from pushing those hands over every part of himself until Tony was warm again.
To distract himself from the very prominent proof of Tony’s divine origin, Steve wrapped his arms around the man’s middle. However, once he pulled him down, he couldn’t help himself and let his hands brush against the spot where the wings sprouted from Tony’s body. As soon as he touched the skin there, Tony’s body arched up hard against him.
. There were wrinkles around Tony’s eyes from how much he was grinning while pressing his lips to Steve’s, and his own form was fully leaning into Tony, his fingers softly caressing Ian’s head.
Suddenly, Steve felt a loss so strong rush through his insides that he had to keep himself upright with a steadying hand against the door. His mind was torn—split with the agony of loving Tony and how much loving him had cost him so far.
At least, he knew Tony cared enough to want to put in the effort, but beyond that… Steve felt like there was more to this he wasn't quite able to read just yet. He snorted lightly at the thought of Tony trying to fuck him against the wall. No, that wouldn't work outside of the armor, and Steve wasn't much in the mood to bring that idea up just yet.
To Steve’s relief, Fury looked intensely unimpressed. His eyes narrowed and he read the small note one more time, then folded it properly and turned to Tony. “Is there any reason to believe your wife wouldn’t have corresponded with Mister Stane?”
“Great,” Steve said matter-of-factly, “but those are the keys to your house in New York. Try again.”
During his speech, Steve had stared at him with an open mouth, barely moving. For a good whole minute, neither of them said anything. And then, because Steve was a fiercely intelligent man, he came to the right conclusion.
Steve bit his lower lip. Tony's seduction tactic was so easy to roll with. He tried taking that extra step closer again, counting on Tony's words to mean that it was okay. The light touches were making his heart rate skyrocket, but that was okay, too. It was an excitement he couldn't remember ever experiencing before, and he welcomed it.
He’d gotten better, or so Steve had thought, but then again, he didn’t know much about Tony after what had happened in Siberia.
Steve sighed and wrapped an arm around Tony’s middle, resting his cheek against the back of his head. He wouldn’t let anything come between them, not now, and if he could help it, not in the future.
,” Steve breathed. “That’s what I wanted to say. There’s no need to be jealous, I... I didn’t fall in love with a different version of you. I fell in love with
“No,” Natasha said shortly. The tenure of her voice suggested anything but reason. As though her word verified the end of all discussion and a motion to move to the next suggestion. “We have no idea if we can get you out after.”
And with any luck, they could soon go back to their not-quite-normal lives, and finally do what they’d planned to do for far too long.
Tony laughed, gently coaxing his head upward so he could see Steve’s blue eyes. “Funny,” he said. “You think you’re so funny. I’ll have you know I’m absolutely capable of self-managing my orgasms.”
He cast Steve an easy smile, brushing their noses together. “Well, I guess our little secret affair isn’t all that secret anymore, huh?”
“Thank you.” Tony sighed. “But it’s not that… It’s—I did everything the damn leaflet said. I picked the willow coffin. I chose the hymns. And I still… I still didn’t even manage to cry at the funeral.”
There were a few beats of silence, before Steve could find it in him to raise his voice again. “JARVIS?” he asked quietly. He made his way to the kitchen, putting the ice cream back into the freezer.
He held power over Tony, therefore power over Steve, and that alone made him even more intimidating.
Steve rolled his eyes and heaved a breath of exasperation. “That’s where you wanna take this? Really?”
In the background, the news channel was reporting on the destruction in Lagos. There had been casualties, not as high a number as in the previous timeline, and not nearly as high as it would’ve been, had Rumlow activated the bomb right in the middle of the IFID building, but at the end of the day, it didn’t matter. It seemed that no matter what they did, they just couldn’t save everyone.
“No, Natasha and Rex are getting married,” she said, lifting the doll in the air, followed closely by some stuffed dinosaur she’d jammed beneath her armpit.
He stepped away from the shelves and approached Tony. "And how long do you think we have till they find us?"
“If all of the students react that way things will get very awkward very fast,” Tony mumbled against his shoulder, rousing a small chuckle from Steve.
He held on to Steve's head for dear life, fingers trembling against his neck while he pressed his back against Steve's chest. With the hand around his dick, moving in perfect sync to Steve's steady thrusts, the pressure built quickly. It radiated from his core, spreading heated flames to the tips of his fingers and the soles of his feet.
She was flipping pancakes and stacking them on a plate. Her greeting to Tony was a small smile and he smiled back. “Pancakes,” Tony told Ian. “Just what every hungry scientist and his spawn require in the morning.”
Steve’s body tightened with anxiety. Slowly, he stepped forward and wrapped his arms around Tony’s lean frame. “We’ll make it work,” he whispered. Blindly, he pressed his lips to Tony’s, but pulled away before he could react. He couldn’t stand the sting of rejection. Not now. He was determined to deny him the chance. “I love you. We’ll make it work.”
Tony’s head had dropped down in perfect submission, and his entire body shook, triggering Steve’s own orgasm. He curled over his back, completely spent. Tony’s arms gave out and he slumped down, shaking with the aftershocks.
Steve had needed to put the perfection of that specific moment onto the canvas. He had wanted it so much he could hardly breathe when it finally turned out just
“More,” Steve repeated mindlessly, over and over again, and Tony complied by thrusting into him as hard as he possibly could.
Still, eventually Steve stood up and walked outside. At first, he didn’t even see Tony. There were many people on the road, but Tony was nowhere to be seen.
Steve nodded and that was it. Tony’s tongue slipped between his lips, and with a long whimper, Steve became his completely. Perhaps none of this meant anything—he didn’t know. All he knew was that Tony had pushed him down on the mattress and was now pressed against him, full-body. His hard cock rubbed against Steve’s pyjama-clad erection, inciting small whimpers from his mouth and stirring the fire he’d started that first night back to full glory.
—was sewed to his body. The flesh around the metal was bruised, but the scars were clearly old, like they’d been there for long time, and that couldn’t possibly be right, could it?
“Before you say anything,” Tony started with a firm yet gentle voice, holding up a finger and pointing it towards Steve’s chest, “I feel obligated to tell you that—the tracker in your uniform? Stays. Forever. And no, you don’t get a veto.”
Tony put one hand on Steve’s hip and slowed him down, showing him how to move so that it was like dancing, their bodies rubbing against each other in a perfect, soundless rhythm.
—he wanted it here. In this place composed of nowhere, with the weird-looking furniture and the wrong New York skyline.
“Tony, what is it?” Steve eventually asked cautiously. He was used to Tony ignoring him, even to his anger, but now he looked as unhinged as he’d ever seen him.
A pause. When he spoke again, Tony’s mouth was right at his ear. “You look too pure to be real. And anyway, this is my dream, remember?”
His voice had filled Tony’s silences, and he’d welcomed it, letting the rich baritone of his voice wash through him. It didn’t matter what Steve talked about exactly, as long as Tony heard his voice, felt the accompanying whisper of breaths carry his scent across Tony’s skin.
Steve bit his lip. “Is that why you reacted the way you did? Because I didn’t make a fuss about it?”
Tony inhaled softly, his cheek resting against Steve’s shoulder. He considered him for a long, silent beat, then tentatively raised his hand to Steve’s cheek.
Both of their teams stood at the mouth of the airport. Steve was staring at him with an unreadable expression, and the others looked equally confused.
“You boys really have a problem with falling off of things,” she mused, while Sam did a U-turn, and rushed towards the ground. “Wonder how Tony does it.”
“The good kind,” Steve offered, and the light intake of breath from Tony’s side told him immediately that he got his meaning.
And almost as if she read his mind—almost as if to illustrate that point—Natasha brushed a thumb across his cheek, murmuring, while she did so, “Let’s not do that again.”
With an inward sigh, Steve watched Tony from across the room. He was bent over his desk, a pen scratching rapidly across a sheet of paper. There was an open book lying next to him, something about Plasma Physics and Fusion Energy; and Steve walked a bit closer, taking a cautious look.
He’d almost forgotten this quiet, withdrawn version of Tony even existed. And a part of this was Steve’s doing—he knew that now.
“Let me get you a pillow,” Steve said, as if on second-thought, and leaned to the side to do just that.
Tony snorted, linking both arms behind his head, stretching beneath Steve. “I could supply some pros to the whole blowjob-part.”
The room was… perfect. A stream of warm sunlight poured through the windows, illuminating the white marble floor. Everything smelled nicely, too, and fresh flowers were placed on the sideboards. There was a huge bed right in the middle of the room and its sheets and pillows were neatly made. There even was a nightgown placed upon the mattress and a pair of slippers waiting on the floor.
“This is for dropping a building on my face,” Rumlow spat as he raised his gauntlet, until a large retractable blade shot out. He tried to hit Steve with it, and Steve only just managed to turn aside, the blade smashing into the stonewall behind him instead.
“Hawkeye and I have reached the barracks, Captain,” Thor announced. “The second blade has been placed.”
“They would ask Strange for help,” Tony said, sounding more thoughtful than actually angered. “And Strange—no matter how much of an asshole he is—knows how to track the portal’s traces. It shouldn’t take this long, unless…” He sighed, glancing at Steve. “Unless they didn’t even find out we fell through the portal in the first place. In
Tony logged into the virus’ network, and closed his eyes. Ultron had left a trail of breadcrumbs in Extremis’ matrix after their standoff. It had led them right back to Sokovia, and if Tony was honest, this had always been the only possible place where this would end.
“It also includes a trip to Vegas with Rhodey, making Bruce lose his temper for once in his life, and working up the courage to ask you to move into the mansion with me, but yeah, that’s the agenda.”
The tower now loomed in the distance and Tony touched down on the roof’s landing pad a few seconds later.
Tony’s stomach was in knots in merely considering what going on a trip with Steve could mean for him. What if Steve told the others? What if he’d only waited for the cruelest moment?
“Not so easy to factor in superpowers, okay?” Tony shot back as he made to stand, offering Steve a hand to pull himself up. It took a moment before Tony found his footing, his legs feeling weightless and numb at the same time. “Well, this is mortifying.”
“She designed the room for the two of you?” Steve asked, and he didn’t really know why it would bother him, but he couldn’t shake the thought off that it was
Tony frowned as he turned around and stared at Steve disbelievingly. When exactly had they reached that point where Steve thought he could be telling Tony what to do with his life? Sure, they had met kind of regularly in those last weeks, mostly in Bruce’s lab, and mostly with Steve helping them rearrange one of the other heavier equipment.
So as he helped Sam with carrying Bucky forward, Steve twirled the three of them around fast so that the first shots were hitting the shield on his back. The phone in his pocket vibrated steadily, but he couldn’t stop to check who it was. The bullets were banging against his back as he picked up the pace. They couldn’t stop moving until they were safe.
Steve’s gaze hadn’t left Tony, but he was frowning now. “I landed somewhere in Lower Manhattan. I… walked here.”
“You know, I’m really not in the mood for another lecture,” Tony said, rubbing at his temple and wincing when he realized he had blood on his fingers. There was a hollow space in his head, as if something was missing. And whenever Tony closed his eyes, trying to access Extremis, well… there was a piercing pain in the crown of his head, and then nothing.
Tony hummed, his gaze analyzing. This was by far the most handsy they’d been with each other, and Steve felt his heartbeat quicken.
In seconds, hell broke lose, and all of the Avengers, Barnes and Maria included, threw themselves into the fight. As Steve deflected multiple beams directed at them with his shield, Tony closed his eyes, seeking access to Ultron directly.
“Be honest with each other. I know,” Tony finished, sighing. “Look, when we come back home, we should—”
Tony nodded his head in agreement, resting a steadying hand on Steve’s knee and Steve—despite everything that had happened in the last few days—could only lean into him. “I do.”
They kissed all the way across the room, stumbling and laughing, nipping at each other’s lips and growling with how good it felt. Whenever they looked at each other, Steve was staring him down with that gorgeous, endless blue gaze of his, like Tony was suddenly so much more than he’d been before. The strokes of Steve’s lips were damn near reverent. He consumed Tony, all but devoured him. And with every kiss, he was crawling inside Tony, making himself at home just a little bit more. He sucked at Tony’s tongue and imprinted himself on the building blocks that made Tony who he was.
“I do,” Steve said. Weirdly enough, even with his beefy shoulders, he looked almost dwarfed in the large bathroom.
Also, Tony might or might not have been some kind of toga-wearing senator in Rome in one of his past lives. That was, if that complete bogus concept wasn’t total crap, which honestly, it probably was.
He wanted Tony in his life. He wanted him at his table, laughing with him, arguing and sparring with him; he wanted everything. He wanted the added bonus of having him in his bed as well as at his side.
Steve flopped back down on the bed. “Whassa matter with him?” he asked, his voice still sleepy. To Steve’s credit, it was the first night after they’d brought the infant home with them, and it still felt plenty unreal.
“Look,” he began cautiously and frowned up into the air. Maybe he was imagining things, but it seemed as if the color was already draining from the world. “If you don’t want to be with me, you could’ve just said so. If you just wanted no strings attached… that’s…” He frowned, suddenly realizing how deeply not okay he was with all of this. “You know what, no. You really should’ve told me so before, because I kinda got the impression you actually liked me and not just wanted me for a one-night-stand, so I wouldn’t say it’s
“Talk to Nick,” Tony added. He forced a horribly fake smile to his face and cupped Steve’s cheek. “I get that you want to defend Bucky.” He paused, rolling his eyes when he realized that yes, calling him
He reached up and gently grabbed both of Tony's wrists, then pulled back. "What…" He swallowed once, licking his lips without really noticing that he was doing it. "What are you doing?"
Steve felt a sudden rush of bravado. Could it really be that Mister Stark was flirting with him? No. No, it wasn’t possible. Mister Stark wouldn’t be flirting with a
It had been four thousand three hundred and eighty two hours since Tony had texted Steve in February that he didn’t want to see him ever again, that they weren’t friends anymore, that he had to stop calling so much.
The robot’s head twitched, once, twice, then the sound modulator in its helmet clicked, and Tony could hear his own voice through the room’s speakers:
The only moments when he felt like he was still the man he’d been before the Sokovia Accords, were whenever Tony called. It wasn’t every day, but close to it, and Steve lived for those hours when he could watch Tony and Ian via the video feeds, have Ian giggle at him, and blabber those few new words he’d learned recently.
That got a laugh from Steve, and he finally nipped at the hot chocolate, nodding. “I’ll try to keep my hands to myself.”
Tony frowned and fought the temptation to simply bang his head against the wall next to him. “Because your shoes really don’t match that blazer?”
, had once been near Bucky like this, that was… “So you’ve known. All this time since I woke up. Every time we talked about him, you knew.”
about this, and if he was going to pull these stunts every time they stepped out on a mission together, it
Teaching had gone by easy enough, his students as quiet and uninvolved as ever. Steve had tried to make the subject more appealing, really, but how many people out there could say they had a passion for history? And a specific subsection of it, for that matter, was all the more boring for them.
“That was a joke, Steve, come on.” Tony pulled back just enough to catch Steve’s eyes before he ripped his own dress shirt down the middle, buttons flying in every direction. “There you go.”
When Tony walked up to him, Steve raised a questioning brow, and smiled, when Tony gave a tiny nod in return. He tugged him down beside him, carefully repositioning so he wouldn’t wake Ian. Tony curled into his embrace before resting his head on Steve’s shoulder.
Tony frowned but nodded his understanding anyway. If Steve needed some time to sort through whatever had happened, it was fine. And he
Steve leaned down on him, and his mouth traced the expense of Tony’s throat. One hand managed to wheedle under Tony’s shirt, while the other was tugging at his pants. Tugging and then—Dammit, Steve buried his head in the nape of his throat as he found his hardness. Caressing flesh that he knew so well. Teasing him, drawing artless circles around the head that craved his touch the most. Tony heard Steve chuckling at the noises he made, but turnabout was fair play. His own hands were well occupied; gliding laps up and down his length, teasing his sensitive head with excited liberation.
Steve wasn't a big fan of the partying scene. He never saw much of a point in getting wasted on alcohol. But Bucky loved it, and it was something they could do that didn't involve moping around at home. Steve followed Bucky into the club just after nine thirty, his eyes doing a quick threat assessment sweep through the place.
She was right. Together, they could do this. They could face the past and start a future. They could know heat in the middle of a winter storm. For all that was behind them, there was only the road ahead to look to. The first means to an end either had ever known.
Iron Man gripped his body and pulled him into a fierce embrace. Next to them, Bucky’s form was tumbling down, rushing headfirst towards the water’s surface.
At least, he didn’t look disgusted or anything. Tony hadn’t been exactly sure how Obi’d react to the whole being into guys, and—
“No,” Bucky replied with a huff. “That’s… a bit of a surprise. Not necessarily a bad one, but… you never said anything.”
Afterwards, the girl was watching him with a closed-up expression. Whatever agenda she’d had, this had not been the outcome she’d hoped for. She pulled up her pants with clipped movements, and avoided eye-contact. “Я думала, это заставит меня чувствовать себя лучше,” she said, the tone of her voice flat.
“No,” Tony shot back, pointing a finger at the room in general, squaring his shoulders. “It’s something
It was almost painful to watch. He’d gotten used to 2022’s Tony with all his emotions so vivid on his face. He remembered when he first met that Tony, all bounce and vitality, flirting, smirking, laughing, kissing him. His emotions had been out in the open then.
With slow, quiet steps, Steve followed Stane and the steady clicking of his cane through the dark labyrinth that was Stark Mansion. If he’d thought its outward appearance was the impressive part, he stood corrected now.
“Yes,” Natasha agreed, though Tony knew there was a ‘but’ before she opened her mouth again. “Steve and James… they still hurt people. Ross wanted that leverage so he could force our hands and bring them in and… Tony, we can’t say no.”
Steve wanted to reach out to him, comfort him, but Zola’s voice already echoed through the room again, “HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security. Once the purification process is complete, HYDRA’s new world order will arise.”
With that, Steve claimed his mouth, tasting him, leaving nothing to question, and the taste had Tony drunk within seconds. The full want of feeling—knowing and accepting that Steve was there, that he had not left him—had Tony’s nerves seeking physical verification. The softness of Steve’s lips against his, the full feel of him wrapped around Tony… it all quickly drove his senses into over-drive, and overwhelmed him so fast that he felt he couldn’t take it all.
Before Steve could answer, Tony’s tongue poked out to caress the underside of Steve’s cock. It was, admittedly, the single most indescribable sensation Steve had ever experienced—something he’d only heard the soldiers talk about. Something he always suspected he’d never experience.
After they’d finished, when Tony had fallen asleep, he’d soon started to mumble in his sleep. Steve had listened to him, unable to rest yet, and his heart had clenched uncomfortably when Tony had suddenly started whimpering his dead wife’s name.
Anyway, all Tony wanted right now was quiet, and there was no quiet to be had while sitting around a crowded conference room. When he had left, he had felt their pitying gazes following him to the door; and now, even as he stood here, he could still hear them. They were talking about him. Worrying.
A slight shadow fell over Tony’s face as he nodded. “Me, too,” he said gently, rubbing Steve’s back.
“You filthy piece of crap!” a man yelled and the words echoed all across the ballroom. He was staring down at Tony with furious eyes, pointing a finger in his direction. He was even shorter than Tony, in his mid-forties, and Steve was about to restrain him, but Tony held up a hand. “Let him,” Tony murmured, as he wiped his face.
“Good thing it wasn’t you who ran up against it,” Bucky said, and it took Steve a moment to realize he’d been talking to
Mister Stark was a busy man; Steve learned that quickly. He spent a lot of time on the phone or writing letters, and people were constantly trying to engage him in conversation. They wanted his opinion on some new design, or a business idea, or simply tried to get him to invest his money in a project.
“I know, I know,” Tony said, and squeezed his hand again. “But it won’t do me any good in jail. If I’m lucky enough not to get a death sentence, that is.”
“Why not? It’s… I don’t wanna be presumptuous, but the two of you… I don’t know, Tones. It’s not such a big surprise?”
Tony hummed in agreement, swallowing down the food, then clearing his throat. “That’s one delicious sandwich, Rogers,” he said and took another bite for emphasis, before putting the plate down on the small work table behind him.
, Tony thought, pressing his eyes closed. He’d known it’d happen, and while that didn’t make it hurt any less, he at least knew what to expect now.
As he walked towards the balcony, though, a firm arm suddenly slid around his waist, and Steve smiled as he realized that the night might just be salvaged, after all.
a part of him wanted to say, but the words were stuck in his throat. There were times for jokes and then there was… this.
Bruce nodded, walking over to the cooktop, looking down on whatever Natasha and Sam were making for breakfast. “Could you fix some porridge?” he asked.
“Sweetheart,” Steve said slowly, “calm down. It’s all right. All right? It doesn’t have to be perfect. And you don’t have to do it alone. Please let us help.”
When Steve looked up, he realized they were mostly alone now, with only Natasha, Clint, Sam and Bucky lingering near him and Strange packing books and ingredients he’d probably used to open the portal at the far end of the room.
They had, apparently, made it back just in time before the gates opened at last and rain began pouring down on them. And Steve had a feeling that it’d take a whole long time before it’d stop again.
“He was,” Tony agreed. “He still hurt people while he was on trial. But it’s not impossible. We might have to let a little more time pass before we do anything.”
Tony blinked. What about that, Barnes was actually talking to him. And not just telling him to do something anatomically impossible to himself, but
“In the mad world of Tony Stark’s Irrational Delusions, I’m sure you do.” He placed the plates on the counter and flashed Tony a challenging glance. “
that, of course. Loved that Steve never held back with his feelings, these days. That surely hadn’t always been the case, and even months into their relationship, Steve sometimes had had that look on his face, as if he wasn’t really sure if he deserved all of this.
Rolling his eyes, Steve took hold of Tony's hand and smiled at him. “You were great,” he said, reaching for a pitcher of water and pouring some for himself and Tony, and lifted it in offer. No one else was interested, so he set the pitcher down and looked back to Tony, thinking how much he'd grown over the past three years. He'd finally grown into that Van Dyke of his, his features losing some of their softness with the weight of responsibility and decision making that could make or break his company… And yet, he was still so beautiful it sometimes took Steve's breath away.
Tony exhaled a low breath. He’d had no idea Steve was still feeling like that. He’d adapted so well, the thought had never even crossed Tony’s mind. Placing the espresso cup on the table next to Steve’s book, he turned to him. “You’re doing incredibly well. And in any case, you don’t need to know about Abba or Steve Jobs to be able to distinguish between right and wrong.”
In some way, Tony had known that he would find himself here in this place. It had been the most likely outcome. Bucky Barnes had been Steve's best friend to an extent that Tony would likely never understand. He'd just hoped that maybe... Tony frowned. Maybe what? Have Steve call it a night when things didn't go as planned? Have him surrender even though there was still a chance he might actually save his friend?
Tony turned around. “Figure out a way?” he echoed with sorrow in his voice. “You really don’t get it, do you? There
Tony pulled Steve down with him. He lay down on his back and Steve moved on top of him. His hands wove around Tony’s shoulders, while pressing his pelvis against Tony’s.
“Don’t get teary eyed on me,” Tony said quietly and Steve looked up and blinked. He realized his eyes had in fact gone a little misty. “It’s in the past,” Tony added and walked right through the holograph, making it vanish.
He reached for Steve’s hand, pleased when he exhaled a content sigh the moment Tony's fingers linked through his. “Good night,” he murmured, drifting off into unconsciousness.
With that, something clenched around Steve’s heart, and he stared at Vision with wide eyes. Did he really mean that? Steve had a hundred questions, and there were probably a million answers to each of them, but he figured the technicalities maybe didn’t matter.
It was freezing cold and the battle still weighed heavily on Steve’s mind. The scenes were on constant replay and he tried to figure out if anyone had gotten hurt in their short standoff. God, he hoped not. With the Hulk and the military joining the battle, things had gotten out of control so quickly. He knew that had been Tony’s plan—to give Steve an opportunity to flee, but it still had been a dangerous gambit.
Steve knew he should be letting go of Tony and moving away, putting some distance between them, but the hurt already showing in his eyes was just too much. He
Lila beamed as she started to paint, and Steve forced a small smile to his lips. He leaned back a little, and let his eyes drift across the room once more.
Tony smiled as if reading Steve’s mind. “Well. It’s a bit more complicated, of course, but the important information here is: It can bring you back. And once you go back,
Things were just too messed up now to even begin to sort through. And still, he couldn’t get the images out of his mind. Stuck there on repeat. How he’d practically mauled Steve, how he’d rutted against him and
Steve felt himself nod. He was glad that Tony decided to pursue this invention he’d been working on for so long. Still… “When are you leaving?”
“You said it’d be okay if I asked Carol to join us,” Rhodey pointed out, crossing his bulky arms over his chest. He was staring intently at Tony from his seat in the football stadium.
In any case, Tony realized he couldn’t live with his eyes closed anymore. Not by any stretch of the imagination. This was his fault; there was no way around it. And when all of this was over, it was time he made amends.
Steve and Sam shared a look that spoke volumes. “That’s not the way to go, we’ll have to make them see that,” Steve concluded. “I have a feeling Fury will have our back.”
“Please,” Tony said, feeling small and vulnerable, and hating himself for it. He took hold of Steve’s uniform, pressing against him. Steve’s breaths were slow and even and Tony tried to mimic the movements, finally managing to pull air into his lungs.
Somewhere between those kisses, Tony’s scarred red face had vanished. Instead, those beautiful, giant wings had decided to make an appearance again. Steve knew, because they had wrapped themselves around them both, keeping them locked together.
Well, this was fun, Tony thought a little hysterically. Within a few seconds, Steve’s and Obi’s body language had morphed into ‘alpha male in fighting stance’, and this was clearly getting out of hand.
Tony left Steve’s cock with a parting kiss, and was in his arms the next second, their mouths once more ravaging each other. Steve’s tongue had a mind to conquer, and Tony was hopeless to offer anything but complete surrender.
Bruce didn’t even look up from the screen. The guy was definitely too used to Tony’s teasing. It was a shame.
Steve nodded numbly. Tony’s eyes were haunted, every inch of him tense as though he’d just killed Indries all over again.
“I’ll get the lube,” Tony said, leaning sideways and rummaging through his nightstand for a second before flicking the little bottle open.
“I know,” Tony said, and leaned back against the tractor. Without hesitation, Steve’s hands explored his body, grabbing his ass, pressing his pelvis against him so Tony could feel how desperately he needed this.
Natasha stared at him. Her expression was one hundred percent blank for a long beat, then an amused smile reached her beautiful red lips. Bucky’s brain momentarily zoned out as his fingers began stroking her, begging her body for those overwhelmed trembles, those soft gasps, those tiny moans, all those signs that meant Natasha was finally losing her poised demeanor. “No one would believe how sappy you can be,” she whispered.
A dream. That would make a lot of sense, and it’d explain the strange-looking interior of the room. Steve’s fantasy had always had a mind of its own. The question remained why Steve would dream of a guy like this. The man was irritating, and downright obscene, not to mention that he was treading on very illegal grounds and didn’t seem to care all that much.
There was a beat of silence, and eventually, Sam rolled his eyes and walked into the room. As soon as the door closed behind him and it was just the two of them again, Tony cleared his throat.
The birds were getting quiet and in the distance, Tony saw a few animals running towards the forest. The temperature was dropping, and the process of the surroundings darkening and changes taking place had been slow but were now almost imperceptible.
“I’m just being realistic. This grand future of his? Might not even be happening. Every time travel creates an alternative timeline. The fact that he influenced this timeline means his future won’t be ours for sure.”
Something raw and animalistic left Gamora’s throat then, and she sunk against Peter’s chest, shaking.
“At least he can give me a fist bump now, can’t you, DUM-E?” Tony prompted, raising his hand. It took a second, but then the claw closed, rearranged its angle, then lowered until it had reached the height of Tony’s outstretched hand. Cautiously, it came closer, then moved forward until it gently touched Tony’s knuckles.
Tony just looked at him pointedly. “I don’t exactly have much of a reason to trust you right now, no matter how great you claim we get along in your time.”
“Fuck!” Tony ground out, reached for the phone, and pushed down on the answer-button. “Don’t call me again,” he spat into the speaker. His voice was raspy with disuse, and there was an odd, unpleasant flavor haunting his mouth. But in all honesty, that was an afterthought when he threw the phone against the wall without waiting for an answer.
Steve groaned and simply leaned down to grab the two main poles. “I’m here. And I’ll help you. Better start dealing with both.”
, a small part of Tony’s mind screamed in protest. That part of him that was still kicking and pounding invisible fists against the walls of his will. No!
It was instinct that took over and made Steve move, despite his unease, and simply do as Bucky ordered.
