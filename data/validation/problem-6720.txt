Tony is struck by a reminder about how much the Tower never changed after Ultron.  He had been working on the compound, and it had been ready shortly after Sokovia, and the team had moved in mass to leave the bad memories behind.  Widow, he remembers, had been one of the first to make the move.
Steve’s smile starts to fade, and Tony’s crumbling resolve finally gives up the ghost. “I’ve learned that when dealing with big changes it’s always the little details that get you.  So keep an eye out for those sneaky bastards,” he grins. Steve’s relief is palpable as he sinks back into the couch.
Instead he waves his hand and watches as the entire display minimizes.  He looks up and catches Steve staring at him. “I’m loyal,” Steve shrugs with a sheepish smile.
A screen lights up above him, and Tony has to take a moment before he can sit up without wincing.  There is a diagnostic of a brain rotating in a holographic format.  Below it, his name is written in blocky letters with a steady stream of data scrolling besides it.
Steve just takes a sip of his tea, and they sit there for a long moment before Tony starts talking him through his latest iteration on this chip that isn't pushing out enough processing power.  The hardware team is ready to run with it, but Tony's not convinced until he gets it perfect.
Bucky knows his habits and moods, and while he's still recovering, he still knows Steve well enough to hum again.
He chuckles a bit at the pun. Steve moves his hands and traces his forehead, smoothing the lines there. “I’m sorry,” Steve mutters. “I didn’t think you would want to be blindsided by this one day.”
There are rooms in that compound of disrupted lives.  Of hopes and dreams and visions of the future scattered around, like forgotten mines for him to stumble across.  There are entire wings he can’t bring himself to look into.
The other guy is roaring distantly in his own head.  The tone isn't angry, just significant, reminding.  Like there is something just out of reach for them both a tickle at the edge of their memory.  "Oh," he said, before following it with a bit more feeling.  "
“Schedule me some basic work Jay.  Remedial classes until we’re back to fighting weight.”  He says and he slots the circuit into the tiny toy.
“Yes,” he confirms.  “You find him. You save him in my future,” Tony grins a little.  “You always save the day Aunt Peg.”
He starts pushes the thrusters in his feet forward and tilts until he is level, angling for the opening in the mouth as he presses forward.  The comms channel does fuzzy for a moment as Tony and Friday create and send out missiles in every which way. The insides of the whale explode on impact, the screaming of the animal muffled because, he’s, well, inside instead of outside.  Tony has to bob and weave around them, picking up speed as the countdown in the upper right tells him how much longer he has before he’s at the end of the whale.
On day eighty three, Bruce pushes his glasses up his nose and reports, “I think we’ve finished the nanobots.”  He puts his hand back on the table he was leaning on.  Tony is on the other side of the table, staring past him at the TV he has 4 separate screens open on.  He taps away at the keyword, finishing up the clean up on the method for have the nanobots deactivate when programmed.
The floor is slick under his feet, and he tightens his grip on the piece of metal he has tight in his left hand.
JARVIS' modulated voice sounded amused. "The file has been updated with more instances. There will be notifications if there are minor injuries, but any majors ones will end the simulations immediately."
Tony bites back a grin.  “You kept bitching about the training room in the Tower, so I decided to build an entire training field.  You like it?”
Tony wants to snort.  He has always been running on borrowed time, since he was captured and a battery hooked to his chest.  Instead, he grins with too many teeth and says, “Then let’s make the borrowed time count Doctor.”
He calls three weeks later while Steve is in the air, flying commercial to stay under the radar even though Tony tried to get him on the jet.
“Better than PETA,” Barnes chimes in on his right.  Tony doesn’t exactly look at him but the screen adjusts the view so it focuses more on him than Steve.  He’s looking at Tony, windswept and grinning. “That is where I was going to go.”
He puts the water bottle down and skims his fingers on the mat between him and T’Challa.  A hologram bursts to life between them that displays different pictures with a single slide of Tony’s finger on the heavy plastic.  There is first a picture of T’Challa in Siberia, watching him, Steve and the Winter Soldier behind his Black Panther mask.  Next is one of Panther getting Zemo in his plane, handcuffs gleaming on his wrists.  Another is helping a limping Steve and company onto his place.  The fourth is Zemo being dropped off to Everett Ross’ shocked face. Sharon Carter hovers in a corner. “That’s my favorite picture,” Tony adds before going to the fifth image.
“How can you lose me?” Tony scoffs, incredulous as he waves his arm.  The blood splatters around him. “When I never really was here? Because me?  I’m not the Tony Stark from 2009. I’m not. I’m half of him. Maybe even less than that.”
But he had seen the way his father had spent every summer looking for Captain America, like it was his personal crusade.  Like he loved the man more than he loved his wife or son. The way Peggy had held Howard’s hand on the anniversary, both too fragile for anyone else to be included - Maria and  Daniel hovering outside the door, Jarvis besides them, waiting to be included but knowing this was their grief that they couldn’t share all of, except with each other.
So Tony picks up the candy dish some ex assistant gave him and throws that against the wall. It shatters, raining down and clinking quietly, like rain, and Tony likes the sound. There is a queer amount of pleasure in him at the frenzied emotion. He pulls at a pillow, and pulls and pulls until the seams tear under his fingers, stuffing oozing out.
He opens his eyes, and Steve is watching him, intent. “I’ll be okay,” Tony adds. “I just…” he lets it linger for a moment, trying to find the right words. “That day is something I avoid thinking about. I honestly don’t remember much of that year. Just parts, starkly.”
"My dad was an asshole," he offers one night.  The sun has long set, but Tony lingered after dinner and washing up, just talking with Steve, who kept going, like he had no where else to be as they migrated to one of the many sitting areas in the compound.
Steve’s lips are pressed together tightly.  “Okay,” he nods. He is tense and serious. “When are you heading out?”
“Hug! Hug! Hug! Oh shit,” Peter shouts.  It goes muffled on his end, and Tony zeroes in on his direction and sees the eyes of the suit go red before the spider arms come out, stabbing each of the enemies. He lets out a breathe he knows he was holding in.  Friday swings the scene back to the others, and Tony notices Bruce is being overrun, so he motions to Vision to take that.
Rhodey shifts, like he is about to do something and Tony takes a deep breath until he can feel his lungs pressing against his ribs, too full and ready to burst. "Okay Tones," Rhodey sighs instead. He slips off the chair and goes towards the stairs.
Bruce has a soft frown on his face.  The lines at his eyes are tight.  “SI isn’t,” Bruce loses steam to actually ask.
The king stands tall in dark jeans and a pull over.  The ring of the King gleams on his hand, and Tony doesn’t need FRIDAY to rundown the properties to know it’s natural Vibranium.  He looks tranquil, more at peace than the last time they met.  Tony inclines his head.  “Your majesty.”
Tony waves the thought away with his left arm, and she stays silent - sullen and probably already reaching out to Rhodey.  Tony would smile if it didn’t feel like that would split him in two.
He has nothing else, but he does have Steve.  He can carve something out of this. He can make it work until he solves the problem on how to go back.
“Tony,” Reed says, low and sincere. He’s a little wild eyed, but he’s been that way since he arrived in the Savage Lands - and Tony knows Reed enough to know this is a focused crazy, not grief ridden insanity.  “I need to get my family back. You’re the only one I know who can help me.”
They are friends, he thinks, and knows it won't last much longer. Once he finds Bucky, Tony will find out.
But now, with these people around him, Tony doesn’t think it’s the same.  They are worried, frightened. The alarms are blaring, and he’s just another in a long list of apocalyptic signs that the end is coming, and he’s one of the oldest here.  He knows most of them.
“Oh wait, I guess you decided to use your Captain America overrides in a non mission capacity. Guess I need to fix those protocols,” Tony continues, stepping around the glass, finding a path that takes him closer and closer to Steve.
"Oh Tony", Ana whispers, as she brushes his tears away. "You will try your hardest to prove everyone wrong, won't you?"
He picks up his fist sized board and heads outside.  There is a bottle of ferric chloride he has hidden in the shed near the Jarvis home, along with a  mason jar and set of kitchen tongs. He pulls the plastic goggles he gotten from his science kit on his 3rd birthday and straps them around his head before carefully pouring enough of the purid green liquid into the jar before dropping the board inside.
Shuri stares him down, before Tony gives finally.  “It still happens, but it’s not painful.  Just surprising.  Or at least not what I was dealing with before, when I…,” he pauses.  “It’s not like before.”
"I think you are the only one who would right now," he jokes as he shuffles forward. His left arm is moving more jerkily than he wants but at least it's moving. It feels like he's barely kept all his bones in his skin.
But that means Tony's been here since at least midnight, and the way he wears the layers of the suit is telling. Tony's always worn around the edges Bruce has begun to notice.  Ragged like the edges of his t-shirts, lines of his face deeper, shadows under his eyes darker.  He's been that way for longer than Bruce can remember.
They can exist in the same room now.  It's been nearly 8 months, but Tony doesn't seek her out.  Is letting her set the pace this time.  He's a whirlwind, he knows, too big for his own skin most days.  Instead he seeks out Steve, someone who can match him blow for blow and calm him down until his own skin fits right.
“No sir, you know I have no contact with my former teammates.  You have access to all my communications if you would like to check.”
The other being nods before setting off, and Tony focuses in on Clint and Natasha, back to back, circling around, comms silent, as the the group around them rears back about to leap at them.  Natasha is tensed, ready to leap forward, while Clint presses something on his bow transforming into a sword.
The silence drags between them. The quiet of the air conditioning, the sounds of the others way off in the distance, the city down below, the clink of the ice in his glass is all there and not. Natasha can see it weighing down on him. Lines building upon each other, the patchwork of his face that can’t be smoothed away with the alcohol. His face is a map that she still can’t read. He’s half translated, but in a language that is ever evolving.
Doesn’t matter that the serum has made it impossible to forget things, Steve takes extra care to think,
There are moments before all of this, where they were all almost friends.  Comrades in arms definitely.  Friendly but almost friends.  After, he deluded himself thinking it would all be the same eventually.  With some measures and a few more socially things, things could go back to really friendly.
Bruce catches the carrot and rolls it between his hands.  “Not a miniaturized ARC reactor.  They would run like the duracell rabbit.”
Vision covering Black Panther. Tony and Falcon going after each other.  Rhodey, Spidey, Vision and Panther going after Lang.  Wanda going after Rhodey.  Cap and Winter Solider booking it across the tarmac.  Hawkeye engaging Panther.  Vision taking down the tower.  Rhodey hitting Wanda with the amplified sonic vibration.  Bruce pauses on the footage of Cap and Winter Soldier  disappearing under the crumbling tower.
“Uh,” Tony stutters, feeling out of his depth.  “We’re going to need the hellcat who took your eye and saved the world in about,” he looks around the room.  “When are we? Oh no matter. On May 15th 2019. We need all the back up we can get. Thanos is here and trying to court Death -”
The older man gathers himself, and Ana reaches out and puts a hand on Tony’s knee.  He looks to her, and she smiles her soft knowing smile, “You’re perfectly safe. We’ll always make sure you are.”
Peter grins, “We’re also working on an exercise routine to put the system through the paces.  If anyone has any tips, we would love to hear them.”
"Only a true nerd would know that Legolas," Tony returns. He takes to the air to survey the landscape. The room is really the size of 2 football fields, so they robots will be slow going as they boot up, but the smaller ones will make it across the space pretty quickly.
“Don’t even act like you don’t have 500 versions of this arm on your tablet.  And just because I’m interested in figuring out the intricacies of vibranium, doesn’t mean I’m doing ‘needless’ experiments.”
Tony rolls his eyes.  “That was such an insult Brucie.  The fact that you would compare me to that stupid rabbit -”
Once he would have been interested in how it worked, breaking down the solution until he could simplify it for his own curiosity and knowledge before locking all of that down and never picking it up again. Now he’s seen Steve trail a broken man across the globe.
Tony scrubs the evidence, Steve knows, but he passes along the video to Natasha. He thinks Clint knows too.
Steve slumps until his face is against Tony’s chest, but Tony can’t keep from laughing, so he rattles them both.  “I love you,” Steve sighs.
Tony shrugs.  “Thankfully I didn’t lose my drafting skills.  I just tweaked it enough to be able to pull this off.”
(They both know Tony had cameras on them, but Tony still likes to hear what Steve caught.  His impressions.)
He thinks about the ways they fought in meetings, plans strung between them. He thinks about Tony's face that day the Accords were presented. How tired he had looked.
Tony sketches a note to take a look at the data coming back from the chip and if there is anything he and Fry missed in the initial account for output. Or if there is any data he's not taking into account from the chip itself. He knows he forgot about the pain inputs and monitoring that. He needs to keep an eye to make sure Rhodey isn't pushing himself too hard. Users family members, doctors and therapists would probably like that information as well, so he should definitely get that method in and stored...somewhere. Privacy settings too. Don't want to make the any one feel more helpless. He knows that feeling too well.
It's disorienting for a moment, there are two sets of thoughts, seeing himself in his own memory. The future yet not dancing before his eyes. It's too much and his brain stretches and his skin feels too small.
Luke barely refuses to let him out of his sights, and Danny doesn’t do much these days that is less than half a step behind Luke.  Peter, and
“Time to reap you pet,” it whispers, and touches Thanos’ frozen forehead before he winks out of existence as well, the scream on his lips dying before it can be voiced.
He’s too careful sometimes, with Tony, who drags him in and kisses him until Steve can barely think straight.  Tony has been broken before and will be broken again and will solder himself together.  He is skilled at the process.
Tony runs a hand through his hair.  It’s a bit longer than his usual cut these days.  Maybe it’s time to bring back the gel.  “Of course you do.”  He leans toward Spidey.  “Wait until she starts verbally abusing you about your life choices.”
“I can’t drown it out,” Tony says, grasping at straws in his own mind, pain ridden and gone.  More than gone.  Rhodey is there beside him, he has to remind himself.  “What do you mean Tones?  What are you talking about?”
"Too many ghosts rattling around there," Tony agrees. He crosses the room to the glass table littered with papers, books, and other assorted junk. He shuffles but ultimately leaves the mail with Wilson's D.C. address at the top of the pile.
FRIDAY counsels him to take deep breathes, and he bends until he has his head between his legs, no matter how much his ribs creak and protest. He stays there for a while, trying to count the beats between this breath and the next one. When Tony can actually count to four beats and feel his lungs inflate until they feel tight, he sits back up.
(She had been tired and worn, fragile almost when they went into her office, where she sat surrounded by papers and files and general work.  But when they sang her
"The latter," Steve mutters. He looks down at his hands for a moment. "I didn't want to burden you with this."
The camera catches Wanda as she whirls, energy building at her feet until she is flying.  The anchor exclaims something, but Tony knows the wide arch of her energy, how it whirls around her hands without her moving.  “Shit,” he hisses.  When he looks to Rhodey, his face is grim as well.  There is an explosion, and Wanda has a man in the air, sniper rifle hanging limply from his hands.  Red energy encircles the gun until it’s crushes into a metal ball.  She keeps the man in the air, encircled in the cage of red, as she lowers them both to the ground.
sort of look that Steve knows is only something he uses when he’s not really angry. He’s seen it enough times now, over the tops of others heads, with the wry upkick of his lips and knows the meaning. Knows a little bit of who Tony is.
Carol is the first person to look sideways at him but not the last.  “Are you sure?” she asks in a hard tone. “You could barely stand up a few hours ago.”
Steve's voice echoes through the comms oddly, and Tony scribbles a note to look into that.  "You'll tell me if you want to." On camera, Steve makes a run for it, and then leaps over the edge of a fence, easily clearing the barbed wire.
That’s when he’s dropped - beacon still blaring in ear, and the rushing coldness making his teeth shiver as he
He puts his hand on the glass, fingers pale against the lights on the grass.  “If I had held onto him, on the train, he wouldn’t have been down there. He would have had grandkids and be older than dirt, laughing at me from his rocking chair.”
When he looks at her, she is evaluating him. "Can I take this?" She queries, hand hovering over the painting.
He’s tense, ready to move if needed, but the pressure on his knee stays there for a moment, Steve just watching for a beat. Then two. Then three. Something bleeds out of him at the pressure Steve keeps there on his knee, and Tony knows something shows in his face because Steve finally moves, cupping Tony through the jeans.
“Maybe,” Tony replies.  “But I’ll take you down with me.”  The power of the stones dim for a moment, and he twists and turns his chest to Thanos.  “FRIDAY!” He yells as she blasts the other being.
"Is it?" Tony questions. He reaches out a hand but stops short. "Is it better being in love with someone who you believe could never love you back?"
Wakanda is a beautiful as T’Challa brags.  The green of the forests ease into small pops of silver for gleaming the technologically advanced cities.  People point as he flies by, but there is no fear.  No jeers.  None of what he has gotten used to in the United States or Germany or even Vienna.
“What did we used to eat on the roof?” he whispers, urgent to make sure this is real.  That this is really Steve. His Steve. Not a Skrull, LMD, or anything else.
“Come on,” Steve says, hand on his shoulder as they start walking through the living room.  “Let me introduce you to everyone.”
Spidey leaps up on the ceiling again and starts moving on all fours.  Bruce follow the kid with his eyes.  “No, nope, nooooo.  It’s all good!  You’re never getting the suit back!” He books it upstairs.
The other man is pursuing footage from the fight on one of the monitors twenty feet away from Tony.   They both stay silent as Scott Lang burst onto the scene, larger than life on the tarmac of the German airport.  Spiderman rears back in the background, as Lang grabs onto Rhodey's leg.  There is a pause as Vision comes into view before Lang tosses Rhodey.  Spiderman scrambles to catch Rhodey, a truck goes flying, but they miss the plane before redirecting.
Barnes goes next, running at him and gets within a foot before he is sent flying. Thor, however, comes down on Thanos again, storm swirling above them as he walks towards him.  Thor raises his hand and already electricity is churning off him in blue arcs before he takes off running.
Then, he notices that Thanos is no longer hanging back, he’s standing in the middle and there is a person on the ground, grayed out and someone hurtling towards the ground.  “Enhance,” he mutters to Friday, and she obliges, bringing the sight closer, closer, and then closer yet, and just at the image sharpens, Tony knows where he knows the sound from.
Spidey twitches away before the pen gets there.  “Nooo.  Don’t do that,” he yelps when Tony goes for his mid back this time.
Tony lobs his pen at Spidey’s back.  It arches while Spidey continues talking. “Mr. Stark build the suit so there are minuscule gaps between the plating that allows my natural spider-ness to still work.”
Steve, eventually, feels his limbs thaw and Tony continues working until he cheers and asks if Steve wants to get celebratory burgers.
(Steve’s struggling in his sleep when he opens the door, and for a second Tony feels bad before he hears Steve muttering while moving roughly in his bed.
And Tony forgets when he spent long summers or winters or springs with Peggy, Daniel, Mom, and the Jarvises, Howard had been left behind, furiously working and drinking too much.  He remembers what that felt like, after Ultron. Last man standing and trying to hold it all together until it felt like too much.
They’ve been fighting wave after wave of Chitauri for a while.  Tony’s taken to the air, trying to get the airborne speeders and whale things down for the contingent on the ground.  Wanda, War Machine, and he have been working with the higher contingent. Strange has been working with Vision and Falcon on the groups skimming above the ground fighters.
"Stark!" Ross bellows. "You do not have any power in this situation, I can throw you in a hole as deep and as dark as I want, and I will have the backing of the entire UN. Don't cross me."
Tony debates about telling her about Barnes but that...is something more involved than he know about.  And without his parent’s death’s, does he become Ironman? Is he willing to risk it?
“The stones don’t want to be near each other.  They know it means they are coming to an end.” He adds, and there are things Tony knows he isn’t saying.  There are entire histories and discussions they don’t have time for. The whys and the hows aren’t what he needs to know.  It’s the
Tony watches, stolen heart in his throat, the whole way. It only settles when Rhodey sinks into the couch, proud grin across his face.
"Okay," he replies, gripping the paper tightly enough it wrinkles. He has to smooth it with the palm of his hand before he can read the numbers to call.
Later, when he sinks into the bed with Steve, he says, "Fuck, you have to remind me to use my words more."
T’Challa begins to drum his fingers on the table, and Tony has to resist the urge to flinch at the start of each succession of five fingers hitting the table.
"Fuck," Tony hisses as he fiddles with his wrist watch. "Must have miscalculated. Give me a second."
"I'll sleep when I'm dead," Tony waves the commend away as he stands. "Now what about you? What are you feeling like for breakfast?"
A man comes out from the building beside Steve.  He has on a dark turtleneck and cargo pants.  Steve recognizes based on the look on his face.  The dark haired man shrugs, and pulls out his gun.  He levels it at Steve, saying things, and Tony knows he can’t make it there in time to stop this.  Wanda’s red energy entraps him, before the man waves a hand holding the gun, and the energy disappears.  Wanda’s eyes are wide in the corner of the frame.
He pulls up the viewable PDFs for the statistics for the team before sliding the tablet back to Cap.
Later...later he will think on all this more and hurt and work until his brain stops thinking and heart oozing like a a gaping mortal wound.
Tony looks at it for a long time when he shares it. "How could you ever miss that I had fallen for you?" He laughs suddenly.
the paintball grenades you will find on your desk tomorrow are not from me. the glitter is totally from me.
“Are we ready?” T’Challa calls out.  The warriors yell their readiness, and the rest of them begin to get into readying positions.  Armor sliding into place, ready to sprint.
Tony’s fingers catch on the ends of his hair and pull him as close as he can, mapping the inside of Steve’s mouth with a sudden excitement. Steve kisses back with just as much ferocity as he can. Tries to say the things that have been caught in his throat for so long with his mouth.
Her eyes soften.  “As much as it breaks mine to leave you.  You always make me proud dearest. And no matter what your father leaves unsaid, he loves you.  He just can’t put it into words, like most American men.”
Tony looks to Steve, who is still smiling, pleased with himself.  "He said that huh?" He asks aloud.  But the kid is off to the races, rattling off facts and figures and discussing the new suit and some fight he had last week with a crocodile.
Tony shakes his head again, this time a chuckle busts loose.  “I’ve had shitty dreams since I was 19.  How is this any different?”
He wonders if he has broken Jarvis' heart again.  But then remembers the man is dead, and the dead don’t have hearts to worry about.
“Well duh,” Sam calls in the back. “We can see that beautiful mind. But care to explain to people who don’t speak spider webs?”
"Tell me a story," he demands and she doesn't say no to him, not about this.  Just tells him about her meeting with the chairman on the house vote later in the week they think is to target SI.
You were going to try and stop them and were going to get hurt.  Steve was going to go too far to protect Barnes. I needed to do that so no one would do anything they would regret.
She hums, and activates the missile launchers on his shoulder, creating and building things out of the nanobots in milliseconds before sending them at the Chitauri nearly on his back.  They go flying, and Tony uses the momentum to bowling down to the ground, turning his arm into a long blade and taking out the group in front of him before spinning. They freeze before the 15 soldiers slowly fall.
“He always said you would deny that,” Steve replies faintly.  “Said you were too quick to discredit yourself when it came down to it.”  He smiles at Tony, “He bet me. I guess I lost.”
When they show Widow, she’s a blur of red and black.  She’s not in her suit, simple red top, jeans and boots, but just as deadly.  She has her thighs around the head of a sniper, the bomber is already handcuffed to a car door, vest missing.  The man collapses underneath her, and she drops from him, lands on a caricature of a handstand before springing into a standing position.  She puts hands to her ear, makes a face, and Falcon drops in and grabs her around the waist and keeps moving.
Tony grips the podium tightly, fingers flexing against the wood, but the strain is hidden underneath his suit. "You know to never to listen to rumors," he retorts.
“These are not the first version of the Accords,” T’Challa states, and it’s like all the air is sucked out of the room. “There was a version presented to the UN that had any one who presented with enhancements that could not be proven as a technological equipment and studied by private labs before deemed as safe for the public, to be placed under an undisclosed military group to be ‘put to work’.” Natasha can hear the air quotes as he speaks. “Many of you in this room would have fallen into the groups they called ‘enhanced’.”
Cap is surrounded.  There is blood coming from his temple, and he’s wearing a new costume.  It’s without the usual stars and stripes, dark blue kevlar body suit similar to the old mission outfits SHIELD used to use. This outfit has tapered pants and his old Captain America boots.  Blonde hair is a wild array of spikes, standing on end, and his face is grim as he makes a comment, smart alec most likely.
Steve doesn't have time to respond, just rams the door, throwing it off it's hinges, taking two thirds of the welcoming crew down with it.  He throws the shield, and it when it goes wide against the third, the man preps to take a shot before the shield bounces off a wall and hits him in the back of the head.
He’s a liability, has been since the electricity shorted out his brain, and he nearly shook apart. Tony’s trying to pull himself all together, but he’s barely got it back to the tenuous hold he’s been white knuckling the last few weeks.  He keeps forgetting things, his mind drifting at inopportune times. It’s like he’s just woken up, brain blank.
Tony nods as he begins to put up his tools precisely.  The work room is a bunch mini disasters on every surface.  Tools in different piles of half completed projects and barely cleaned up by Tony or the bots.  Disorganized chaos.
“I’m not,” he insists and waits for a moment, letting the words sink in. “This is the only place,” he admits, words sounding and feeling too small, but it’s all he can get out. “This is the only place I feel like I can be me. Steve. Not Captain America, Cap or an Avenger. Just Steve.”
"With your life?" Tony snorts, eyes drifting as they both think about Siberia. About the sound the shield made as it hit Tony's armor again and again. Steve can taste the fear and desperation he had had.
If he keeps busy, he doesn’t have to think about the fact he’s in a plane full of people he should be arresting.  The mere fact he is fighting side by side with them is going to cause problems. That Spider-Woman has been a Skrull for longer than he was aware and knows too much.  Not think about the fact he had just had to fights against someone - some
Steve drops a kiss on Tony's head before leaning his head on top of Tony's. "Just standing where I want to."
Tony rolls his eyes.  “We’ve already had this conversation.  I do it for other people and to keep the questions at bay.”
“Save people,” he replies, thinking about his Captain America comics, and how Cap saved all those soldiers in the camps, including his plucky young friend Bucky from the evil Nazi scientists who wanted to experiment on them.
The song is about a man who leaves to fight the Germans in WW2 (and eventually dies while doing so) and asks another soldier to bury him in the mountains under a beautiful flower.
There is a hand on his thigh, Steve's, and it tightens.  He knows this isn't his place, but Steve is still bleeding a little too.
,” Maria rages, and Tony curls against Ana, shrinking back from this figure of his mother he has never seen before.  “I am always thinking of him. I am his mother and what are you? Someone employed in my household who thinks she is more than her station?”
They continue to laugh and tell more ridiculously crazy adventures a time traveler could get up to.  Eventually, Peggy and Maria return and add taller tales, everyone giggling before Howard comes in, listens for a few minutes before raising his eyebrows higher and higher until Maria has to rescue him and explain exactly how they got on the discussion of taking dinosaurs to the Louve for a party.
“Okay, so I’ve been thinking about threading on a PCB and like, maybe I should do this manually, but - ”
Tony swallows down anything with meaning, any real words.  He doesn't make eye contact and begins to explain the new modifications to the suit, "So you keep doing night missions and red, white and, blue really aren't great for that."
Rhodey catches his eye, and Tony tilts his head side to side.  The other man nods before making eye contact with Bruce and indicating to Peter who is watching the war cries of the Wakandians.  Bruce nods his head once, and they all look to Vision who has been watching them. The corners of his lips incline, an agreement before he looks to Wanda.   She has been watching them silently, eyes steady.
Dad leans down and scribbles another note.  “What do you need a drill for Tony?” he queries to his paper.
“The dreams,” Tony trails off, as images spring around them.  Him watching his own history in stills, waiting to be played. “They weren’t just dreams,” he says, faintly.
Rhodey takes longer strides in the video and the leg adjusts fine, however the movement causes a wince. Tony restarts and zooms in. The leg jerks into place in the last frame, not easing like it's supposed to.
Tony turns back to the program on the screen. "Okay J. Have we gotten the security parameters beyond the initial, 'oh shit don't let anyone die so Fury can't kill me' level we talked about?"
“You are missing the point Steve,” Tony rolls his eyes.  “You always miss the point Steve. This isn’t a story about me missing people.  Of course I miss them. I loved them, but everyone dies eventually. This is about me being able to take apart anything and put it together since I was four.”
He laughs, loud and honest and unlike him. Unlike him with her. Natasha’s grin widens, and she hopes this is them getting better. Evolving. Becoming a new them. An honest version of themselves, and she’s okay with that.
He waves a hand and creates an illusion of them both, glowing the strange orange power he had.  A soft glow of green pulses from Strange’s double’s chest, lazily floating down the orange glowing veins until it fades to orange.  Tony’s double, however, has the green infecting nearly every vein. He’s more green than orange.
“Tony?” they cry.  “We’ve been stranded here.  Did you see our distress signal?”  Fake Sam takes off, flying up to meet him.
The whale lands, taking out a chunk of the Chitauri forces underneath it, and once they are high enough in the air, out of the way of the way of the nearest whale and the Chitauri on the speed, Tony slows to a hover.  “That was close,” Steve murmurs, and Tony nearly laughs at the understatement. He looks to Tony and then adds, “Greenpeace isn’t going to be happy.”
“Tony,” Steve reaches out and Tony flinches away when one hand tries to grip with his wrist.  He looks concrite and pulls back, shrinking into himself. “I never meant for you to feel that way.  Let me fix this.”
"We're ready to jump," Tony says and anything Steve is going to say is lost as the world goes white.
“What do we do now?” Tony asks.  “Thanos is trying to summon you, and I don’t think I can fight that very well.  I think ripping an infinity stone out of my head will kill me.”
Then the pods start shooting again and again.  Tony puts Thor down and raises back up to watch the scene.  Thanos goes down under the light for a moment before he roars and the pods are eaten by a gaping hole in space that glows blue before shutting again.
The wind stirs up into a tornado and Tony has to put a hand in front of his face before it suddenly stops, and there is a version of himself standing there.  Grey at the temples is more pronounced and his skin has a green tinge. But it looks like him, until the other version opens it’s mouth and it speaks. Then he knows it’s not.
"Shouldn't we be trying to work on coming together as a team and not our individual weaknesses?" Cap asks.
(“Why is there a couch here?” Steve asks one day when he finally gives in and comes down to the Tower’s lab.
Avenger’s eyes slide for side to side, and everyone knows, but is careful to look away from Tony.  Wanda’s eyes light up, and she begins twitching her fingers. Steve nods to Barnes and takes off running at Thanos.  Thanos bats him away with the almost finishes gauntlet, and Steve goes flying, skin rippling colors before Wanda catches him.
They run tests.  Tony tries to protest but ends up just silently watching after a while, trying to figure out the technology they are using without displays as they type patterns out in the air before a system turns on.
Rhodey sweating through his first work out of the day is the image that greets Tony when he slinks into the compound. He's faithfully upgraded to the latest exoskeleton that had been left on his dresser, just like he does every Monday these days. They have a silent communication happening here between them. FRIDAY watches and takes notes, Tony turns those notes into changes, and they fabricate a new exoskeleton to help Rhodey walk.
“Nope,” Tony says, popping the p. He studies Steve for a moment, and Steve feels a hot flush burn up his neck at the attention.  “What’s with all the covert looks tonight Captain?”
“Okay Steve,” he follows up before looking down at the parts strung out on his table, ready to be assembled. He puts the tool down in his hand and collapses into his seat, like his strings have been cut.
Tony's eyes cut back to him, soft and vulnerable.  Bruce knows that if he wanted to, he could break Tony right here and now.  It would be easy.  A word here, a suggestion there.
Another doctor in the back shakes her head no.  “We can’t interface with Extremis. It’s too old, out of date, and it’s warped when he was in the ice.  We just can’t. Your friend is how he is. There is nothing we can do.”
“Probably.  But it also depends on how you were going to end that sentence,” Tony replies, and it sounds more like him, less filtered than before, and Steve had a million questions but Thantos is coming their way, and he doesn’t have time. Not now.
Steve’s hand is on the glass before he even notices it, reaching out into the moment beyond him, and the second his hand brushes it - the glass is suddenly obscured, and he can’t see anything past the frosting.
Steve thinks about the times he existed in the moment with Tony and realized he hasn't really been alone in a long time.
They walk the hallways for a moment, silent as Steve steadies out from the nightmare.  “So,” Tony says. “This idea has been running through my mind. It’s overwhelming - all consuming - and I can’t shut it off.”  He looks over at Steve and grins. “The exact same thing happened the day we found you.”
Tony looks up from a book he’s reading, hard cover because Steve likes the feel between his fingers and the smell of leather bound books.  He can see the way Steve is trying to hide his anxiety over the topic “Sure,” he replies, easy going about it.
Steve shakes his head slowly before standing up.  “Tony, you didn’t.” He takes a few steps towards him, and Tony stays there, watching.  “You never showed any inclinations. You had Rumiko.”
[6] (Hausa) Literal translation of the phrase: For the news of the heart one should ask the face. (Hausa is what the official linguist said to use for now.  Sounds like they may use similar phrases or put twists on them for official Wakanda dialect.)
Strange pulls Tony aside as everyone rushes off to grab their armors.  His gaze meets Tony, eyes dark and serious, and he follows the doctor turned Harry Potter character without any words spoken into a shadowed alcove.
“Snipers eyes,” Clint utters softly, like he knows he just shifted Steve’s entire world. He watches the scene in front of them as Natasha, without looking up from the tablet, says something and both Bruce and Tony stop in shock before Tony starts squawking loudly, and Bruce presses her to elaborate.
The Hulk is covering the ground behind him, and when he roars, Tony can feel the earth shake underneath his feet.
Steve goes on his first weeklong trip while Tony has been occupying his space three months in.  He is quiet during dinner, not keeping up his usual commentary of his day while they eat until Tony finally says, “I’ll be fine you know.”
It takes a week, but there are amendments and the Accords version 2.0 are already being worked on by a select group of ambassadors and Avenger lawyers.
Rhodey eyes him for a moment before reaching out. Tony grips his hand and hauls Rhodey up. "I'm cooking this time though. You burn water."
He wants to smooth away the lines on her face like he used to when they were younger and didn’t speak in half truths and hide things from each other.  Back when they would huddle around Peggy’s Christmas tree and listen to stories from the older generation, skipping sections as they looked back to the younger ones.  Back when they didn’t have others blood on their hands too.
But now, Steve looks up from the book he’s been reading and knows his eyes are wide. “Trying to make sure I don’t make another killer robot?” Tony adds, like he’s goading Steve into a fight.
(Thanks for reading and reviewing. I'm not going to lie, every review guilted me into writing some more and poking at this chapter.  Seriously.)
But Tony Stark isn’t a believer in destiny, and in some worlds, he didn’t play.  He knows himself well enough to know that. And then other’s glowing green eyes soften, like it knows what he’s thinking and nods, silently.
Steve lives in the middle of that day dream sometimes, wraps himself in what could have been, if he had opened his mouth weeks, months, years ago and said the words he told the trees.
Water crests over the edge, and it gets on his reactor.  He shakes and shudders, and the hands on him pull back.  His vision is blurry as they hand him back his battery and hustle him back to the room.
Rhodes's face doesn't give, but he parries with Tony like usual. There is a shift in the other room, and, later, Tony steals a glance after his heart settles to see Vision staring out at the silent training fields.)
“We’re looking at the justice process behind any infractions, the protocols for engaging the Avengers, and how each of us sign them.  Maybe making them individualized sign ups since we all engage as superheroes on different scenarios.  Maybe have someone as main point of contact,” Tony voices to that spot behind T’Challa.
“I thought you got that fixed,” Spidey replies curiously as he straightens.  The suit is still intact. Tony hums as he circles Spidey.
Dr. Perez is awesome! He has this project he is working on to be able to create a robotic prosthetics that works with a microchip to allow people to walk again after losing a limb.
Tony snickers for a moment, because there is a butt joke right there.  Steve stays there, seriously and intent, so Tony settles and places a hand on his face.  “Of course, Steve.  Of course.”
“I don’t have any one,” Tony says out loud for the first time one night, unprompted, a few weeks after the final pronouncement.  “I have no money, no resources, I don’t even understand how the technology works and I’ve
He looks back to Wanda and sees her red glow still intact around her.  Vision’s redder now, imbued with her powers, but he looks at Tony with the same even expression he has since he activated.  Strange’s green glow has faded until it only a tinge, overwhelmed by the orange of his magic, or whatever it was.
Bruce takes in a deep, steadying breath before he stands.  Quiet in his perusal of the room, takes a few steps until he is standing behind the chair he had been sitting in moments ago.  Tony, nervous for more reasons than he can even think of, grabs his phone to have something in his hands.
Tony notes that mentally to look up later, when Steve goes into the work he talks around in a few days. “Oh,” he replies blandly, trying and failing to see MJ and Peter not attached at the hip.  He’s just used to the concept that those two crazy kids would always be together. It’s hard to imagine Peter limited to a chair, unable to do his crazy acrobatics - hanging from a ceiling or sticking to someone’s shoulder.
clear enough for Steve to hear, but she also knows he’s desperate to make this make sense. To make it feel like he didn’t abandon Tony back in Siberia to a fate potentially worse than death. That he didn’t destroy everything they had, and be completely wrong.  She had clung to that same hope when she had left Tony in that German hospital, praying to anyone that she was doing the right thing.
Tony doesn't want to disappoint her, so he keeps his mouth shut.  He can't understand why her eyes start welling up too. "I'll be the best, so I can prove everyone wrong."
When they show Clint, he’s on a rooftop taking down men in black harassing South Sudanese women and children as they try to flee.  He ducks when they start trying to shoot him, but he makes short work of the twenty or so men before leaping from the roof with the use of a grappling hook arrow.
“Hey pretty,” Tony croakes out.  Rhodey’s head snaps up and he looks exhausted, like at the edge of a four day binge of all nighters - like back at MIT.  He goes to reach out for Rhodey, and that’s when it all snaps back into focus, the sharp pain that overrides everything he can see, hear, feel, even taste.
Tony looks up from where he has been sketching out a few designs for a stationary bike with a napkin and a couple scraps of paper.  Steve sets down a mug of coffee, because he's used to this now, after months in the compound together.
It was, if he was frank with himself, not a new reaction to seeing Tony Stark.  Steve Rogers shouldn’t be any different than anyone else in the world.)
“We had,” Steve gets flustered for a moment.  “It was private,” he says, finally. “What you did in your home was private and people speculated because we’ve always had busy bodies.”  He slides his eyes to Tony’s, exasperated, and Tony’s so taken by surprise he bites out a laugh before pushing it back down. “And in the war, anyone looking for some comfort could find someone else to give it.”
He’s careful not to look back until he’s halfway across the city, and even then, he had to ball his hands into a fist as he does it.
He keeps his eyes outside, watching the pods that zip around.  The flying Vespa’s teen dip in and out of the air, around traffic.  The varieties of people in the holographic ads, some that don’t even look human.  The way buildings dip and curve in new ways.
I’m sorry I shouldn’t have asked that.  It’s just you are the person I go to for these types of things.
The move into the Tower had been quiet, unassuming, and not picked up by the press really.  Tony has been a bit impressed with how he was being left alone.  After almost a month, he was losing the first place on Google to Finding Dory. Tony couldn’t be more relieved.
And they do, and there isn’t anything for a long time so Cap calls it a false alarm. They end up just standing around, discussing the revelations in quiet groups. Natasha and Clint are silent, conversing in body language and observations of others until the plane comes into view.
Steve never tells him to stop, never tells him to not come on missions.  Steve just continues on, figuring Tony into plans with a ruthless efficiency that Tony knows from his own ways of looking at a problem when it’s put in front of him.
Tony spends his days reading history, watching movies.  Spending time with Steve for longer than he can remember.
Steve’s face does a complicated twist before settling in a placid sort of smile.  “Pepper took over the company, rebranded with everything,” he shrugs around the talk of the immediate chaos after he died.  “She released your ten year plan of different electronics and Peter came on board to SI two years in. Took the company more biomedical than your initial take.  He always said he was just improving on the ideas in your archives.”
Tony thinks of the woman who used to run around with him, always there when he came home, had taught him how to shoot a gun and hide a weapon on his person, who had never once had to ask what was on his mind.  The only one who had never doubted him.  “I’m not drinking for taste.”
"Oh, you're just using his an excuse to get around the grocery bill huh?" Tony's voice carries mild sarcasm, his media voice.  "I see what you're doing here. Just using me for my bank account."
He thinks about the rabbit, the way she had looked at him, aghast.  The way he had almost killed her.
Tony watches Rhodey out of the corner of his eye, see the struggles Rhodey has as he adjusts the level of support the skeleton gives him. He expands out the design, focusing on moving the support module higher up and easier to grip but still sleek enough to not look clunky. He adjusts some of the lines, thins the metal used. Maybe there is light weight solution that doesn't look as alien as the current version.
“We don’t have time to think about this,” he replies, finally, as he shakily stands.  “We need to get out there. Where is he, Shuri?”
Instead, he stays huddled in the back.  He is careful to keep his head down, eyes low as the others move around him.  People he used to call allies, friends even, are carefully studying him for long moments before looking elsewhere.  Tony’s used to the uneasy roll in his stomach. He accepted this long ago.
He is stretched out across the couch, his feet in Rhodey’s lap as he skims the patent application for the exoskeleton.  “How about ‘the amazing legs’?”
The mass looks on warily.  Tony had chosen the lower balcony on purpose, so when T’Challa drops from the higher leveled one with barely any sound, Tony has to roll his eyes.  “Are you seriously this dramatic even as the King and not just when you are visiting me?”
Tony takes in a deep breath as the pain eases, like it’s been reset.  “Okay it’s a timer,” he mutters. “You could have been kinder sentient stone who swears it likes me but I think lies cheerfully.”  There is a laughter ringing in the back of his head as he opens his eyes to a garden, filled with flowers.
“It’s nice,” Steve utters as he pushes himself off the couch.  “To have someone to talk to and not just think about everything.”
Peter kind of rocks back further on the coffee table, so Tony sits up.  “Things change, you know, so I just want to be able to be independent if I have to be.”
"Jesus, you have to be kidding me. That's against the Accords. They should be in a cell in the Terrorism Centre in Vienna awaiting trial."
,” he says after the burn clears his throat.  His sun glasses are perched firmly on his face, but when Peggy turns, it’s like she can see straight through them to his red and wild eyes.
The silence between them is heavy. Tony has to swallow back the lump in his throat. "Dad wasn't drunk. Their tires was shot out. They crashed. He pulled dad out of the car and killed him and then went to mom's side and crushed her throat. Dad wasn't drunk."
They take a self driving pod that flies to Steve’s place in the city.  It gleams in a minimalist and white way; something that looks like the tower back in the day.  Steve’s modest about the place, quiet even as he shows Tony around before they settle in the kitchen.
“Well,” Coulson starts, and Tony almost busts out laughing because Coulson’s hair looks like some version of a Captain America haircut.  “An experimented upon human who thought she was an alien, but more or less yes.”
Others sway, like they want to get closer to Death.  Any not under the spell grab onto the wavering superheroes.  Keep them close, just in case. Steve actually takes a step forward before Barnes grabs onto him and pulls him back until Barnes can get both hands around Steve.
Tony watches him disappear down the hallway before he sits heavily on the edge of the bed.  He runs his fingers on the edges of the comforter. It’s softer than he is used to, and Tony looks around for anything familiar, but even the lambs are different.  They are soft balls of glowing light.
“Proximity alarm.  Spidey sense is only for life threatening danger.” The kid answers before he dodges a third stab with a jump to the ceiling.  “
"I haven't seen you in person in a while," she replies when she finally pulls back. Her eyes shine.  "You look good."
Wanda rises in the air, floating softly until she makes eye contact with him.  She nods, and Tony looks over Sharon’s head and sees a glowing string between him and her.  If he focuses, he can see different strings trailing from her to Vision, to Clint, to Steve.  To others.
Below all of that, the SI logo dimly glows.   Tony reaches out to touch it but pulls back at the last second.
Tony smiles and it feels like it’s pulled out of him.  “You know this reminds me of Dad and how he used to search for you.”
"Peter," he reaches out with his hand until he can tip the younger man's face upwards.  "You can't do anything to stop me from being there for you."
Tony clears the plates and cleans while the others filter into the living room. They are a soundtrack at his back, low words, then high pitched shouts from the youngest in the group and the murmur of the TV.  As Tony scrubs a dish, he half hears Natasha murmur from her usual place at the counter top.  Clint throwing out terrible ideas about TV shows they should watch.
But now that he’s looking, he sees the differences in Tony too.  The way he holds himself a little too tightly, the way he looks a little ragged around the edges (more so than he used to).  The way he doesn’t carry a glass of something amber.  The way Bruce keeps eying him, the way Spider-Man only touches his left side.  Tony looks older than Steve remembers him, worn down to the bone and holding back some pain.
She stares at him for a moment, eyes heavy because Tony thinks she knows him better than he knows himself.  He still feels at sea sometimes, running from one project to another without any real plan.  Always in a hurry, heart in his throat like he won't be able to balance it.
Tony waves him off and treks out of the room, embarrassed.  “I can do it. I can do it,” he repeats as he heads to the shower.
Tony quickly puts the ferric chloride aside before anyone can catch sight of the bottle.  It’s dark outside, and when Ana looks the window, he waves brightly.  She smiles, waves back, before going back to the game.
Jan dies during the Skrull conflict.  Hank...doesn’t handle it well. He turns against the avengers, against the world, lost.  Reed takes him under his wing, tries to bring him back. Hank, lost to grief and having lost himself, kills Sue Storm.  “You match me now,” his crazed form says in the video to a thunderstruck Reed.
Steve puts his brush down, contemplates adding a little bit more blue sky to make the orange cast of the sunset a deeper contrast when he comes back tomorrow, but turns to Tony to see how he finishes the statement.
The place where the arc reactor used to rest in his chest aches so fiercely for a moment that Tony can’t breathe.
“So do you!” Bruce cries, waving his hands at Tony’s head indistinctly, and Tony has to hide his grin at Bruce’s clear indignation at this entire topic.  “And you’re older than me. You’re the old man!”
Steve deepens the kiss, like he knows Tony is thinking too hard.  Tony grins into it as his heart skips a beat, and under his fingers, he feels Steve’s do the same.
Steve tightens his grip on his arm to keep him going down memory lane, where Tony would sit in the lab in the tower and skim through designs lazily as Steve watched, just like this.  They were completely comfortable being in each’s other’s spaces, but now - they can’t be in the same room without this heavy tension eating between them and everyone else.
The next morning, Tony sits in the chair facing the city, watching as the clouds rise.  It’s been a quiet morning, Steve is carefully walking around him, like he has been since that night.  Tony’s tired of it. Tired of talking around things, always talking around it.
Steve laughs a little bit helplessly before he tries to explain exactly where everything has gone sideways or changed.  It’s been a long two years.
“Captain America is alive,” Coulson croaks out, and he looks like he is about to have a fanboy level of a heart attack or pass out like a character in a black and white film.  Tony wishes Agent Agent was alive so he could rub this in his face after everything.
It's silent across the battlefield as Steve thrusts the blade into the ground and turns back to where his Tony is still down, but his mask is up. He's looking at him, eyes wide. But he nods.
Steve can’t hear anything through the glass, but he can watch them in the gleaming room.  There isn’t a prototype anywhere, and Tony keeps speaking before looking to Shuri who keeps her head down and drawing another version.  They make quite a pair, the two of them, sitting together, yet not - working together, yet not.
He thinks about the wildness in Tony's eyes in Siberia, surrounded by the dead bodies of HYDRA's victims and seeing Tony realize that his parents had been casualties of it as well.
He’s giddy as they get head out, taking a pod, zig-zagging through downtown until they end up on the 23rd level of what used to be Avengers Tower.  His Avengers tower. But even now the feel is different. It’s like the last vestige of something he knows is slipping through his fingers. He’s truly all alone here.   And there is no way back.
Her mouth thins and her eyes narrow.  “Who are you?” Ana asks, and stands up.  “There aren’t any Starks left besides Howard and Morgan.  But Morgan is far away.”
Tony catches sight of gleaming vibranium. He holds out his right arm, "Fry, turn on the cap magnet." The old joke tastes like ash in his mouth.
Tony grins recklessly.  “I wouldn’t do that.”  Bruce huffs as he gathers the plates and mugs scattered across the table.
The room is dark without the simulation up and running. Friday turns on the lights as he moves through the room. He's a ghost workshop. The little light from the moon illuminates the place on the table where the shield lays, half under some rag that Tony isn't sure he threw or if one of the slumbering robots tossed.
Howard blinks at him, hair greying at the temples in the beginning of his slow descent into white.  There is a model, half finished in the corner and plans for the Stark Expo strewn across a table. “We have a working model, but the scalability is problematic,” Howard looks towards his chest before glancing back up.  “But it looks like that gets fixed later.”
“I,” he starts before grimacing and finishes the glass before standing up. He pours himself another finger or three of scotch, tasting it before starting up again. “I keep looking down the line at the next five years, ten years and beyond even, and wonder if it’s worth it. If any of this,” he gestures with his glass. “Is worth what I am going to have to do to make it okay.”
"Of course," he replies before giving his review on the latest version of the treadmill, about the jerking in the belt when he goes to level 20 or beyond.
They are moments untethered to time.  It feels like one after another, but he, later, finds out there were larger gaps between them in the beginning, but they started to get closer.
“Don’t make me get Steve to tackle you.  You know he can do it faster than you can get to that window you are eyeing,” Tony states.  Peter freezes, because they all remember the training session when Peter got plastered by Steve when both weren’t paying attention.  Steve had apologized for months to the point Peter rabbited out of a room when he saw Steve coming so he didn’t have to hear apologies.  Tony had had to broker a peace deal at both parties’ request.
Tony rolls his eyes, “Of course the future still has gossip blogs.  What else would everyone be speculating about idly?”
"People leave eventually," Peter bites out.  His eyes meet Tony'w but these are the lessons of someone who has lost everything before, and then again and again.  It's written down to Peter's very marrow.  "By death, by choice, or even driven to it.  People leave, you know that."
Typical Tony, is something Rhodey would say, shaking his head and laughing at him, if he would bring it up to Rhodey.
Noise erupts in the room. “How?” Steve shouts over the dull roar as he steps closer. Barnes comes off the wall in corner of her vision, and Natasha turns her attention to Steve, but keeps an eye on T’Challa.
He screams at the pain, the unnatural angle.  FRIDAY tries to move the nanobots, but they are frozen.  Someone is yelling in the comms. Multiple people actually, but Tony is caught, head up towards the sky, looking to the cloud rolling in.
but Pepper's smile is brilliant and distracting.  "Tony!" She cries and puts her cup down before pulling him into a hug.
” in that voice that brings back memories of too many funerals, her composed form at his side.  No tears on her face and expression neutral.  Her voice always gave her away when she spoke with him.
He bites his lip at the thought of adding more automation to the exoskeleton. But would people even want that? For their legs? Tony nods to himself silently, because he would, he does in the suit. He just needs to run the numbers. Check with Legal and see where they can reach out to get some focus groups.
Nothing seismic changes. He settles back into himself in ways, in steps. He stops existing, starts living. Back to that man who existed in the pocket of moments between missions and the fear for Bucky and guilt ate him alive
The amulet twists until it is behind Strange’s throat.  It tugs, strangling him, and Tony tries to move forward, but the beaked general throw a few lines at him, capturing an arm.  Tony uses his free arm or shoot the line and then at the general. It ducks, but Thor neatly chops it’s head off.
She keeps her gaze steady, doesn’t give into the joke. “We’re a team Tony,” she states. “I’m fond of every single one of you in different ways.”
,” he sighs out loudly as he then puts them stylus portion on top to his palm and dangles them down to Bruce. Tony picks up a tablet and thumbs through the data FRIDAY relays from the suit in the last five times.  The length of time it took for the proximity alarm to register the pens, the display on the HUD in the suit (Spidey had decided he wanted projected trajectory and a countdown to impact in the lower right hand side of the screen), and how long until the man inside the suit actually reacted.
Dad puts his glass down.  “Tony, you’ve created a board with some markings on it.  That doesn’t mean it’s a working circuit board.”  He is smiling, but it’s not the one he wants and they coo at how he looks just like his father.  The one he uses in interviews, or at the adult parties when he carries Tony around.  Not the one he uses with Aunt Peggy or Uncle Daniel or Jarvis or Ana or even Mom.
There is a rush of images, Steve watching Tony in moments Tony wasn't aware of, for years.  The steady beat of fond
"Yeah," Tony replies. His voice comes out weak and reedy. He clears his throat before continuing. "Pack up what you want. We all have rooms at the Tower. I can have movers come whenever you are ready."
But the past is the past, and Tony can’t do anything but try and keep her and the other alive.  So he reaches down and the gems basically leap into his armor, two to the hands (power on his left and the rest of time on his right), mind to his forehead, soul on one side of his arc reactor and reality on the other side.  There is a surge when they bond with the suit, and stories of the past users flicker before him, their tales of woe and how the stones twisted them. How they could twist him.
Tony longs to say something, to tell him, it won’t be him.  He’ll be the first one to follow the pattern everyone in his life takes, one step in front of the other until they are just barely too far away for him to reach for.  Even if he tries, they are gone. He can’t catch up.
Steve takes it slower, softer, this time, ghosting over Tony’s hipbone , twisting his tongue as he tattoos all his secrets into the skin there, soothing the spot where his hand is imprinted into Tony’s skin, stark against the pale skin. Steve works his fingers around the curve of Tony’s ass, pressing closer as he bends. His mouth edging closer to Tony’s dick.
Tony sniffs and opens his eyes to the doorway to his parents room when he was younger before they decided to keep separate rooms when he was a teenager.
, he thinks as he watches her hands shake in the grainy footage.  That’s not strain, that’s something else.
He adds the last semicolon before leaning back from the table.  “Yeah,” Tony agrees.  “I think we got it finally.  We just need to do some human testing at some point.”
(He finds out later, from Peggy, what had happened all those years ago.  She had taken a shot from Tony’s flask before and after she finished the story.  Both stand under a tree at the cemetery, a good distance away as they watch Jarvis, bent impossibly small, tracing the letters on the tombstone.
They become friends again.  It’s easy, like putting on a sweater he has forgotten was an old favorite.  It fits, a little worn, but he patches it here and there. Finds new ways to show it off.  Finds new outfits to pair it with.
“Really,” Steve returns.  He’s still surprised he was let into the lab, but maybe Tony didn’t want this one argument out between everyone.  Not again.  “I never hated you.  I didn’t get what you saw.”  He shrugs.  “Now?  Now I see what you saw, but I still don’t agree with it.  I don’t think all humans are terrible.”
Bruce begins playing with the nanobot prototype nearest to him, pulling his glasses off the top of his head until they are perched on his nose as he squints.  “It needs to be something semi organic so it doesn't poison the patient or they body rejects it.”
Steve steps into the hug and for a moment clings too tight to Tony, but he’s holding Steve just as tightly before he steps back.  Tony lets him fall back but keeps close into his space. They walk the empty rooms, looking at the artwork.
Jarvis’s shoulders shake and he hunches for a while.  Young Tony hovers in that doorway, watching and too scared to break the moment.
Tony stares at the container with the minuscule robots floating around in them. They just lay there, dormant. He stands up abruptly and gathers enough of the nanobots for an injection for one human into vial.  He puts it in a steel case with a tablet, an injection gun.
Tony has to look away because the flamethrowing bird comes straight at him, beak open and fire filling the air. "Come on JARVIS, did we need this much fire?"
Talking helps. It lets the words he stuffs down come easier, slip past the block in his throat until that goes away too.
So maybe Obie had loved that kid he had called nephew for years.  Maybe he had tried to raise him right, tried to be a father figure, but Tony was hard to love.  He was good at pushing people away, turning them against him.
Tony nods softly, putting his tasting spoon in the steam dishwasher.  The glowing counter takes the note of the salt he just added to the sauce as it records his recipe in real time.  He puts the lid on it, letting the sauce simmer a little longer. “Hank,” Tony starts before he stops.
"Even the times the exoskeleton's response time was outside 1 second worst case. Adjustments needs to be made for switching direction and compensation for quick movements."
They find common ground, a friendship of sorts, and Tony can across a room and read T’Challa’s face without needing an debrief later.  T’Challa can do the same for him.
“Stop it Fry,” he barks.  The simulation stops, the false sunlight dims, and it’s just the lab again,  Tony can see his hand outstretched, ready to reach out and shake him, turning him around,
"Clint said I deserved better than what he had done to Nat," Tony states. "Do you know what that means?"
Ana’s voice is weak and thready, “Oh love, we already know.”  She catches Tony’s gaze as he stares at her from the doorway, wide eyed.  Her smile gentles.
They sit there for a long moment, quiet as Tony tries to calm his too quick breathing.  Steve lets him head his head against his shoulder, quietly saying things Tony can’t parse out over the rushing in his ears as he counts 4 breaths in, 4 to hold, and 4 out.
He remembers what it sounds like when his mother died.  He knows what he said to her last. Knowing he doesn’t prevent it can’t make his grief any worse.
Tony has to force himself to let go of the ARC reactor, the shape of the metal is indented onto his hand and stinging slightly as he relaxes the joints.
He turns and walks out of the apartment, down the hallway and takes the elevator.  He’s very careful not to look back, not to go back. Once he gets to the landing pad, he looks up to Steve’s floor and sees him staring down at Tony.  His hand is pressed to the glass.
She didn’t mean it like that, but she doesn’t push the topic. Coulson accepts the report and files it away, which is what she needed him to do from the get go. Whatever it took to get it done.)
"You sure?" Tony asks for the millionth time that night as they stand in the lab and Steve finishes a painting of the compound in the early days, one of Tony's outrageous cars out front.
Tony shoots him a quicksilver grin over his shoulder before he turns back to the gauntlet.  “Whatever makes you feel Captain.”
Cap watches him for a beat longer before nodding. "Makes sense. The profiles based on the intel from the Manhattan fight, right? We probably need to update them. It's been a good six months since then."
Rhodey still looks exhausted using it, and his steps get clunkier. There has to be a way to auto adjust the support. But that requires motors similar to his boots. Or is this even something in the legs? Maybe this is something with the chip communicating with the exoskeleton.
He waits for a moment, thinks of honesty and the careful way everyone had always looked to Howard and Maria when they had called Tony
Instead, he catches sight of the almost liquid metal slowly covering Tony’s body in an armor that he’s never seen before, even in Tony’s sketches or designs that he used to pontificate about in the lab.  It starts from his right side, and it only takes seconds to to engulf him. “Is that,” Bucky says loud enough that Tony catches - sightless eyes of the mask meeting his eyes before sliding to Bucky.
The laughter from Rhodey at Tony’s face covers the sounds of the elevator opening, but Rhodey’s sudden sober expression clues in Tony.  He pulls his feet back and sits up to see Bruce standing just outside the elevator, bags in hand.  His hair is bigger, curls looser.  He definitely got a tan in India, but he’s clad in his favorite loose linen pants and untucked button down. He has a wary expression on his face as he takes in the scene and the room.
“Natasha?” Steve voices, moving until he puts his hand on her shoulder. She twists away from him, a furious move as she swears a little loudly.
“Nice to know you are sentient and have feelings.  Not exactly the revelation I wanted to have today,” he mutters, keeping this out of the speakers as he ducks an alien rushing him. He pushes off the ground, repulsor blasting one, two, three times before clearing the group in front of him.
Steve treats him like he's normal, like what Thor said means nothing beyond the moment that it happened in, and Tony is so grateful for it.  He knows Steve stares at him from time to time, but he never tells Tony to stand down.
Tony dreams all of this the night before Thanos comes, and he wakes gasping for air like he can’t breath.  Like he knows too much and not enough at the same time.
And then, like most his dreams these days, it fades moment by moment until all he remembers is Ana’s and Jarvis’ faces as he sat between them and they discussed books.  The rest of the details are missing, but the love and affection doesn’t. He holds that close to his chest, until he calms and falls back to sleep.
The larger general knocks through the forces in front of the Panther like they are nothing, and T’Challa takes off running, before he skids under its legs before climbing up it’s back, swiping at the beings throat.  It tries to throw him off, shaking from side to side. Tony sends a repulsor blast at it’s legs, before he has to look away at Friday’s blaring warning of an incoming projection.
“Is the glove thing new?” she asks.  He pauses before noticing the two black gloves Tony has covering his hands as he sketches something out before Shuri breaks out in helpless laughter.
“I see piles of bodies when I close my eyes these days.  I see all of you at the bottom, and I know it’s my fault,” he admits.  Bruce's hand tightens on his arm.  “I know it’s a nightmare.  It’s some stuff lingering from Wanda’s dark side stuff.  But I can’t shake it.”
Tony’s groggy when he comes to, and his right side doesn’t hurt - at all.  It’s a startling difference.  “You should have come to me,” he hears, and then groans.
He coughs, and blood wets the dirt underneath him.  The red is striking against the dirt, and his insides shudder.  Tony feels light headed as he straightens to look Death in the eye.  He wouldn’t do it any differently than he would before.
“He wouldn’t actually do any of the work,” Sam states, and everyone looks to him. He standing straight, fingers resting in a light hold of the couch. “Stark’s a lot of things, but he wouldn’t do anything to provide the government assholes anything that would hurt anyone.”
It’s the beeping of a monitor that captures his attention originally.  It takes Tony a heartbeat to remember exactly where this is.  But the sight of the nurse’s station remind him.  His younger self walks by, and Tony follows him through the maze of rooms until he is standing in the doorway of one.
T’Challa brings a hologram in the middle of the group before he steps closer to Tony and rests a hand on his shoulder.  Between the two men, Tony feels steadier, but careful avoids the eyes of everyone in the room.
Tony smiles as he looks around the room and sees the detailed moments of Iron Man suits of old captured, the planes of the different marks.  The figures of Pepper, Happy, Peter and MJ standing side by side, caught in time before the Civil War. Hawkeye and Bobby are side by side on one side of the room.
Steve carelessly shrugs, and so she waits a beat, watching him, before wrapping her fingers around the frame.
Tony's hands are shaking and all Steve can think of is the way his mother's had shook in those long nights, her fingers encircled around his wrist.
Tony watches as he pours himself two fingers before filling another glass and and pushing it across the table.  Tony weighs the action and reaction before picking up the glass and taking a sip. Howard smiles against his own glass.  “Anton Vanko,” Tony voices finally. “What do you think about him?”
It looks like Steve, moves like Steve, but all Tony can see is the body on the slab.  All wrinkled and like it’s fallen in on himself. His bulk has deflated, with the serum no longer pumping through his system.  It even raises its hands to each out to embrace him like Steve.
But he can’t.  Tony can’t do that.  Not now. Not here with the alarms screaming and the enemy at the gate.  Not with Thor’s eyes dark and staring into his soul if he closes his eyes even for a moment.
He thinks about discussions, the way Tony has always reached out and clapped him on the shoulder, always knew his favorites at restaurants. He thinks about the way his throat would close up sometimes as he watched Tony talk, but Tony would carry the conversation onwards in a one sided manner after a steady look for a long moment. Like he knew Steve couldn't push anything real past his lips
He takes a moment, turns back to the counter.  There is a glass ready, and DUMMY rolls over, hooting softly with an ice tray.  With a quick pat on the arm, Tony takes the large ice block from the tray.  Tony puts the glass down to pour the scotch with two hands before putting the decanter back.
Something flitters across Jarvis' face. "I do not believe you like it when I say, you simply be yourself, " he muses, taking note when Tony nods. "Let's take an example to explain. With Miss Carter, I lend a hand when she asks. I ask about her day and listen when she wants to speak. But there are moments where I read the newspaper, and she peruses a casefile at the breakfast table. Does the fact that we aren't speaking mean we aren't friends?"
Steve remembers barely being able to breathe some days, how it felt like the world was darkening around the edges when he stood up. The way the humidity made it hard to exist sometimes.  The way his mother had looked at him, so worried.  The way Bucky had looked at him, like he was holding his breath until he saw Steve take in another one.
“Oh Master Tony,” Jarvis fondly smiles, and it reminds Tony of every memory he has of being younger.  “You forget that Miss Carter takes any ‘can’t’ as a challenge.”
"I'll watch out for him," Steve reassures her. He is wearing tactical gear, shield on his back with a fine array of nanobots across the top to make it invisible. Still, it's a familiar and comfortable weight.
Something inside of Tony just breaks, shatters, fucking falls to pieces on the floor and leaves him with his gaping hole in his chest that he can’t fill. That he needs to fill. Needs to get something inside of it, make it stop dripping blood and spilling his guts on the floor, but all he can do is stare, stare at the floor, stare at the things that are just broken and fucked up and so completely him that Tony doesn’t know what else to do.
In the middle of the room is a glass container.  Most of it is covered in frost, but the face is clear.
Bruce had stood there for a few moments before Tony had said, as seriously as Tony had ever gotten with him before everything.  "I'm fine Bruce.  Honest."
“What’s wrong Nat?” Clint says, finally. He’s looking through her diagram, eyes lighting up as he goes.
He puts his helmet on, sets up the systems before nodding to Reed who opens the bay door.  He looks back on the ramp, catches sight of Carol looking his way, arms crossed in front of herself, worried.  No one else is looking his way except Peter. Tony nods in his direction before looking forward. He drops out of the plane, free falling for a moment before the thrusters kick in, speeding off to Antarctica.
“Gotta check in no matter what,” Tony replies as he disengages the gauntlet mode.   The plain watch is left, the Hello from SI, UI booting up in the tiny screen.  “We play nice with others now, remember?”
Tony doesn’t respond for a while until he finishes soldering the two wires in his hands together.  “You ought to have a nice place to contemplate the universe in here.”
Tony scoffs before opening his eyes to the blinding white of the blank world around him,  “It’s like you don’t even know me.”
"Why won't he just take what I offer him?  What's mine is his," and Pepper sighs as Tony hurries to add, "it's like that for all of the Avengers."
“Okay,” he relents.  “Okay Uncle Daniel.” He slumps a little in his grip and hopes for a moment that he will actually fix it.  That all his childhood faith will stick with him for a few more moments.
It's grateful, painfully so.  Her blink is slow in response, deliberate even.  Like it's nothing, putting herself in the middle of a deep analysis of her entire mission record.  Like she talks about her past with them, ever.
“Got a favorite piece?” he asks instead and watches as Steve’s eyes light up.  He points back to the one of Thanos, mid-snap and bodies underneath his wide legged stance.  He begins to go on about the subtle shading, and the metaphors of the bodies.
With time, the light eases and he begins to open his eyes.  Tony then blinks a few times before he can see something beyond the fluorescent bulbs in the room.  It looks like the Triskelion, the one he visited once, with his father when it was still being built.  The bulletproof windows see out to the New York Skyline, Stark Tower in the distance.
The singing surges back into his mind with a scream and his knees buckle underneath him like they did in the 1940’s.  Everything is hot and cold at once. If he closes his eyes, he can see images of different times, future, alternative presents, past.  His mind is racing, and he can’t...he can’t...
Steve sits in the lab a lot after that.  They share space and silence.  It's comfortable, an ease Steve hasn't felt in a long time.
Steve's grin is a helpless sort of blinding thing, but it fades when Tony says, "But Pepper, and I've got it."
Tony picks up his water bottle again.  “I’m not the one in a corner.  I felt like I should be honest and open with you before I show you my entire hand.”  FRIDAY minimized Steve’s face and brings up the new version of the Accords for T’Challa’s perusal.  “Here’s every change my lawyers proposed.  Tell me what you think.  FRIDAY download it to his smart phone right now.”
"FRIDAY, test feasibility, and make any necessary changes to the design before you start manufacturing. Add reminders about the notes for me. Also, take a look at the data the chip is getting. I think we're missing something, just don't know what," he calls.
“It’s a pleasure to meet you Dr. Banner.  I am Mr. Stark’s AI.  Please let me know if there is anything you need,” FRIDAY announces, scottish brogue showing a bit more than usual.
His memory.  It hits Tony really hard in that moment.  He won’t ever see Jarvis again, or Carol, or even Peter.  It’s just him now. Him and Steve.
So he haunts the hallways, wandering around the maze of the building until it’s familiar again.  It’s during one of these walk abouts, he finds the new lab.  There is a hologram of a prosthetic arm, similar to Bucky’s, floating between Shuri and Tony, both poking it and a list of notes being added besides it.
He takes in a single shaky breath and closes his eyes, feeling the other man disappear under his grip.
Tony looks up from his contemplation of the training fields to Steve.  The other man in standing like he can barely hold himself still, staring out the windows too.  His gaze darts across the landscape, searching for something.
It’s the third picture that shows Steve wandering around with a bewildered looking Winter Soldier who is missing an arm.  The fourth picture shows the Winter Soldier picking a flower, and every inch of Steve’s face overjoyed.  Tony leaves that one up.
- that moved, spoke, looked so familiar to how Steve had moved that it had hurt to breathe - even with everything going on - when he looked that way.
“The only one good enough for Ana Jarvis is standing over there,” Peggy responds firmly.  She grabs the flask out of his hands and takes another sip for herself.  She winces.  “That’s too cheap for your usual.”
while gasping for air and feeling like he was going to drown again.  Trying to feel like he was human and grasping for the deepest parts of him that he knew were real in this nightmare that his life had become.
I hate this chapter and all it exists for but if I didn't get it out, we would never get to the next part.  It's filler, too freaking long, and filled with too many characters.
The Time Stone feels a little like both, Tony knows.  There are unintended consequences of what he has done, will do, has done - but they are his actions.  His wants. His choices, because at least he gets one, some way to influence the map instead of trying to desperately make a mark here.
He’s everywhere, every when, and it’s seared into his brain, into this being - everything and nothing.  It’s eating him alive and keeping him standing,
Tony leans up as the TV turns on.  The screen is too bright against the lens of his glasses, so he pulls them off as the sound resounds in the workroom.  “Reports are saying the Captain America, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch and Falcon are helping the rebels in the Kurdistan conflict.  Here is cell phone footage of Scarlet Witch helping in a refugee camp.”
Cap had had his ridiculous suit on that Tony kept trying to rework - at least make a few upgrades, but Cap always dodged the offers - and had been reading a file or maybe perusing Facebook on a StarkTablet. His shield lay on the table top, and he had an intensity as he read whatever it was. Tony had wanted to make a joke, but there was something serene about his focus, that he didn't want to break.
His heart stutters sometimes, but Steve doesn't dwell on it.  Just asks Tony another question to set him off racing again.
They fall through history and time. There is a second when the machine fails, and they are thrown out too far in the past.
and Steve shakes his head with a smile.  It's not a contest, they both know it but still, Tony takes the joy where he can get it.
“It isn’t something new to me,” Steve finishes, smoothing his hands across his pants.  “I just didn’t know it was public now.”
His feet take him to the curb, and he remembers he had hijacked Happy into giving him a ride while Pepper was safe and sound in the office.  Tony looks for a taxi, unwilling to call the suit to him in the middle of New York.  But his Mercedes gleams from it’s place at the curb, Rhodey leaning against it in careful study of nonchalance.  Bruce and Vision are beside him.
"It's part of an Asgardian’s abilities to see the marks my people have left on mortals.  Hel is a jealous type, she leaves lasting marks on those who escape her grasp." He dips his head.  "You have escaped death many times."
He lays a hand on Tony's left arm.  Tony stands there, head hung and takes comfort in the fact that Bruce is here.  That he is warm and alive and
[7] (Russian) There was a Russian reimagining of the Wizard of Oz in 1939 called the Wizard of the Emerald City by Alexander Volkov. The translation for the name used for Tin Man is Iron Lumberjack.  Dorothy Gale was renamed Ellie Smith, which is something you will need to know for the next chapter.
“We have missiles still, right?” Tony calls out, trying to calculate on the targets approaching from the front of him.  “Take care of it Fry.”
There are environmental factors he hasn't finished yet, like the wind. He needs to make sure to add a randomizer to any wind generation, so Clint will have to think on his feet and can't predict the changes. Also, he can't forget to make sure the drones that have traces of Vibranium in their skeletons are focused on Thor and Cap since they can take the heavier hits.
“Me too,” he says, and it’s like he’s softened while she has been lost in her memories. “I think you’re all going to be what kills me.” He says it like it’s a new realization, like he gets it as he speaks the words. It’s a newborn thought, one shared between the two of them but it’s out in the world, and it’ll gain speed one day. It’ll be sentient and used against the both of them. But here, in this moment before that. It’s everything. It’s real honesty between them.
Tony leaves his hand on the door handle when he speak.  He doesn’t turn around.  He simply says “okay” before leaving the room.
It takes a long time before Steve feels settled in his skin after that half conversation, but when he looks at Tony, he sees a peace that hasn’t been there in weeks.
“I think there are many stories we never shared with you dearest.  You know I was a spy during the war, correct?” She smiles softly at the shake of his head.  “Ah, of course your father would never want to tell you that. I was a spy, but for the wrong side.  He and the SSR caught me and gave me the option to turn on my country or go to jail.”
He makes his eyes meet Peter’s and holds them.  “My family, you see, has never been by blood.  It's always been based on whomever I've opened my heart to."
“Isn’t it?” Tony says.  “You wanted out.  You were out.  I had you away from the SHIELDS of the world who wanted you in a cage if you weren’t near a superhero, by the way.  I had you safe, and you came back.”
Steve has seen the way Tony looks at Rhodey, the way he looks at Pepper, at all of them, and knows, deep in his gut, that Clint is wrong.
“It’s eating me alive.” He tells instead.  “It’s worse than the palladium because I can’t fix this.  This is just me.  Broken.”
He comes back to with Rhodey going, “Tony? Tones, can you hear me?  I need you to say something here.  I need you to open your mouth you incessant, over explaining bastard”, desperation dripping from his words.
She shrugs.  “I am approaching a normalcy where I am used to murder attempts on my life and my brother’s increasing annoyance about my protection.  I’m trying to fix all the broken people that keep finding me, and I would still rather be at Disneyland or trying to date.”
“Palladium almost kills me,” he finally says, just enough to open a door to let Howard know it’s worth it.  It’s not enough to break all the future. Just enough to have him keep his eyes open.
Steve is at the kitchen table when he hazily walks in.  He has the TV on at a low volume, some animated kids thing, and a sketchpad in hand.  Tony stills for a moment and looks around for a clock.  “Why am I not the only person up this late at night?”
With sharp laugh, Tony runs a hand through his hair.  “Usually when I bring out the worst in someone, it makes them try to kill me.”
He brushes past Steve, out of the kitchen, and almost heads down the lab, but he knows a version of his shaking, and knows it’s a bad idea. JARVIS has probably already initiated a 24 hour lockdown protocol based on his erratic heart rate. He goes to his room, palm print to get in and locks it all down before sitting down on the bed.
Steve has a collection of emotions on his face, too many to rip apart and figure out what they are. Tony just meets his gaze, breathing through the pain of ripping open an old wound. “It wasn’t an accident Tony. Hydra had them killed.”
Peter stays for dinner and when he goes to leave, Tony asks, as casually as he can, "Did I ever tell you I set aside a floor for you here?  I can show you the room if you would like.  Bruce made sure I didn't go too over the top.  It's supposed to be a graduation gift actually, so uh, whoops?"
Tony winces at the old code.  “I’m sorry.  I don’t mean it that way, but after Ultron…” He waves his hand.  “With them.  It was like…”
Pepper looks up as Tony slips into the empty seat beside her.  Her face slackens with shock before hissing, “Tony what are you doing here?”  There is no heat behind her words.
“I can’t look him up,” Tony admits softly.  “I can’t know he died from some fight that burst out on the tower.  I don’t want him to have died of a broken heart after me. I can’t know that if that is what happened.”  He looks to Steve. “If that happened, I need you to lie to me. I need you to tell me he died, surrounded by the people he loved.  He died in his sleep, happy and healthy.”
Tony’s throat catches as he watches himself, 23 and running too fast, trying to get as far away from everything.  He watches Ana watch him run.  He watches her struggle, pain in every line of her face as she is unable to chase after him, before Jarvis looks back at her.  She summons a smile for him, asking for a story of Tony’s shenanigans.
Tony shrugs.  “I’m in a loop right now, but I’ve been able to interact with you guys for about a year now.”  He nods to the notebook. “You working on a new element?”
Her hand traces the curve of his face, “Do you know what I did in the face of such American ideals?”
There is a tug of emotions across Howard’s face and Tony remembers a lot of things.  Remembers how it felt to know he was the thing that his father failed at. Remembers the way his mother’s face fell as Howard kissed her and absently pat his head.
in her voice.  He narrows his eyes, noticing there isn’t a bit of the familiar red glow on her person.  It’s familiar almost, the presence there, and if he thinks to hard, he can feel the sea of memories in the back of his mind begin to swell up, churning and trying to drag him in.
He pushes back memories and continues on, “My father had a man he employed named Edwin Jarvis, which is a much longer story, but he and his wife Ana were the babysitters and honestly raised me for years.  I ate dinner more with them than I did with my parents alone.  You've met my bots, Pepper, Rhodey, Happy.  You know where this is going.”
Instead Tony pulls his hands back from the counter and asks, “So am I taking the couch?  Does the future even have pull out couches?”
They both smile at that, and Steve straightens away from the wall where he has been leaning.  Maybe he can -
He starts moving forward into another room when he sees Steve, clad in a suit, across the room.  His bulk makes the people in the room look smaller. He’s near a glowing statue of Ms Marvel standing side by side with her Captain Marvel persona, at their back is Carol in her flight suit.
Tony puts his head in his hands.  “I’m not a baby, you know that right?  I’m a man in my forties.  I am an adult in every country.”
With a tight grip, he takes a drink before holding his arm out.  His fingers shake slightly.  Tony fists his hand before looking back at all the screens.  “Okay Mark 47.  Let’s start.”
as it happened.  It’s the same shade of blue eyes that he kept seeing every time he closed his eyes.
T’Challa grasps the suitcase and settles in a position that is a mirror of the one Tony has.  “Why the sudden visit, my friend?” he queries.
Again, thank you everyone for reading this so far. Comments, kudos and bookmarks are love.  (Also how do you guys keep finding this story?  The numbers for this thing get interesting upswings.)
Tony thinks longly of the coffee he came up for, before settling down the couch beside the captain.  “Too loud in your own head?” Tony offers.  Steve puts down his pad and pencil before nodding.  “Yeah, I usually blast some AC/DC until I can’t hear it any more.  Bruce swims when it all gets too much.  I think it’s the lack of oxygen for that scenario.  Natasha and Clint go at each other until they are sweaty piles of mush.  You sketch.”
(“If he comes,” Thor murmured that one night they had sat outside and spoke on Thanos.  “Half of us will die.”
He excuses himself to go to the bathroom and goes downstairs to where his lab used to be.  The glass is still up from years ago, but inside isn’t a lab of any sort. It’s a memorial of all the fallen heroes.  Their costumes, gear is held up. In the right side is a version of his armor.
Tony continues to look to the right, and there is something on his screen blinking, but he knows this noise.  He’s heard it before…
(Sometimes Tony wonders if Steve has a back up plan for if he can't make it already dreamed up.  Or if Steve comes up with them on the fly.
“I need to fix myself first,” Tony says.  “Anything that comes after that.” He pauses and looks at Steve who has his hands held together in front of him, falling into parade rest - ever the soldier.  Tony feels a surge of affection in himself that rattles around in his insides before fading. He sharply misses emotion.
"Do you even know who you are between the crises?" She asks, direct like she only is when she wants to cut to the heart of the problem. Surgical strikes.
He wonders, still, if she regreted him like Dad did, and how he stole her away from the life she loved.  She had played the piano a little when he was younger, but not much.
“It’s all connected,” she huffs, still marveling at the complicated mess. Tony had been playing 4 dimensional chess, and it’s almost beyond her, even with him leaving her hints along the way.
The frenzied feeling from early is still there, but sated for the moment. Raises his arm when Steve pulls his shirt off, naked and fully bared to a dressed Steve, but isn’t he always?
I believe you and I should have a conversation about the Sokovia Accords.  Your legal team has engaged the United Nations about the wording around the accords and are preparing for negotiations for more rigorous contacts.  Since this would impact myself as well, I would like to ascertain if our viewpoints align on this topic.
Thor responds with, “My father is dead but everything I thought he had done is a lie, my sister Hela overthrew Asgard and tried to kill me multiple times but I killed her, my brother Loki is not dead but is working as a double agent against Thanos.  Also I believe the Hulk and I are friends now.  We, along with Loki and Valkyrie, make up the Revengers and overthrew the Grandmaster.”
Friday opens their comms, and Tony utters, darkly, “Duck.” Before he opens fire all around them, repulsor only to to keep the chance of injuring teammates low.  The Chitauri scream, but quickly are taken out. He hovers a bit closer as both look towards him.
Tony breaks it apart again and pinches the release down a hair.  He then rearranges the the pipe from the fluid container to the nozzle releasing the fluid until it’s flatter.  FRIDAY notes to the right that it’ll still release the same amount of fluid in the same time span.
Steve aimlessly licks at his boxers, and with every swipe, Tony feels more and more pressure. Feels like he cannot breathe, cannot think, cannot do anything beside raise his right hand and curl it into Steve hair and hold him there.
"When are you going to tell him?" She asks.  "I know you like grand gestures, so it would be nice to know what to watch out for."
Bruce doesn’t say anything for a while, and Tony can feel the yards of emotional distance between them stronger now than ever before.  It lingers like they aren’t standing in the same room.  The old hurts are still there, wounds they inflicted accidentally - that Tony inflicted upon them both are still sluggishly bleeding in both their psyche's while they are here, on the lab’s cold floor.
He levels the gun again, and Steve, in the midst of the distraction has been trying to move away.  There is a hand clutched to his stomach.  Steve stills and watches the man as he grins.
"I come up with the best solutions when I am close to the situation," he replies. "That's what Obie always said."
It’s one of the quiet understanding they have always had.  Tony wouldn’t ask, no matter how much or how little time they spent with each other.
Steve goes back to work later that week.  He’s apologetic, concerned. Tony nearly pushes him through the door.  He spends the first day researching things on the tablet, nearly unmoving as he looks up the lives of his friends, one by one.
He trains, watches the news, set adrift because while there are problems that need solving, but there isn't anything he can do. He'll only make it worse as Cap, and as Steve...he's always been pretty useless.
Spidey perks up.  “Yeah actually.  It’s really fascinating under a microscope.  But any dead skin cells don’t have hairs on them, so I’m not sure if they connect at a sub-dermal layer or deeper.”  He curls up his finger and the paper drops lazily from the ceiling to the floor.
Tony picks is way in a crooked path to DUM-E, carefully clutching the counters or bracing himself on the wall all the way.  Bruce doesn't follow him step by step, turns back to his papers and holograms.  He doesn't even feel guilt as he uses the Hulk given enhancements to follow Tony's progress.  The quiet murmurs to DUM-E as Tony sips the smoothie.
Steve stops and turns to him.  “You know this is really good. This isn’t people just humoring you.  It’s been open for months. I heard they want another exhibit from you.”
He grabs a discarded tablet and sits on the conveniently placed couch near the new workout room. With a few swipes, the device is projecting a mini version of the exoskeleton Rhodey is currently wearing. After placing the tablet on the ground so he can manipulate image he duplicates the prototype design with a flick of his wrist before sliding the original away. "FRIDAY," he calls. "Save any changes done here as the Mark 17."
Tony makes a noise of agreement, “I was always telling him to fix that.”  Bruce catches his eye with a familiar look of fond annoyance.
“Okay,” Tony nods, after the moment has hung too long and the air is heavy with unspoken things. Things Steve won’t say, and things Tony seems to be biting back himself.
Steve watches him closely, looking for weakness, so Tony continues, honest finally, “I’m not handling it too well, but I’m trying.”  He looks away after saying that, not wanting to see Steve’s face soften.
The tugging begins faster now, and it’s takes him by so much surprise that he stumbles, grabbing a chair before taking that down with him.
Steve pauses for a moment, taking a long look at Tony before turning back to the screen.  “They had a few generals who had advanced technology. Not any weapons, but they had the large whale creatures who were hard to kill.”
It’s only under the hot spray that he realizes he didn’t figure out anything.  Doesn’t know how anything works more than he did before Steve left.
It's something Tony's never had before, and he leans into wanting this new fragile, familiar routine more than he should.  But Steve says nothing, just smiles at him every time he sees Tony come in.
It’s easier this way Tony knows.  It doesn’t wipe away the gross cling of the knowledge he is using someone he likes, he respects, like that.
Tony feels like he is running on an empty tank, but that’s nothing new.  He flexes his right hand before balling it up in a fist a few times. Carol’s been eyeing him since before they got on the plane.  She knows him too well some days.
The heart monitor is flatlining, an angry noise.  Steve looks up to the camera, frustration written in every line of his face, and Tony thinks, maybe uncharitably,
The room is torn apart, a rage has left the person, or people, but Tony knows his father’s temper and has his suspicions on the culprit.  Everything was strewn around the room, but the chalkboard was left alone. A trailing equation was written across it, unanswered.
“Do you get colder easier because of the arm?” he asks suddenly.  Tony doesn’t look surprised at the question, just amused.  “I mean Bucky runs warmer because of the serum, but I just wondered.”
“The DOL is leveling a lawsuit around overtime infraction against Stark Industries, and the chairman has been having more one on one meetings with Tony than the actual CEO of SI, Pepper. The adviser is working with a Senator Hurt who is still looking into the Ultron incident since it started in a facility in the United States. They’ve already levied fines against Tony, but they are looking into ways to do jail time."
"We'll find him," Tony says, quietly. "But it's good he isn't here.  That he wasn't strapped down to that bench."
Last chapter is in progress.  I just needed to type up some ragged ends around the lawyers and Steve to set it up.  It all ties together.  May not be a bow, but it’s something.
“Oh, hello Mr. Ambassador. How are you on this fine day?” Tony greets as he smiles into the call. He stands up and begins to pace.
"This is good intel Tony," Cap says. Tony swings his gaze back to the man. He's serious, a small twist of the lips. "Can I review this to make sure I can prepare training sessions correctly?"
There is a crunch in the snow, and Tony stiffens before trying to find purchase and get upright.  There is a hand on his neck, and the Skrull lifts him up with one hand, a smirk on his lips. “No one is coming to save you Stark.”
Howard looks up sharply and pauses, taking him in.  “You always look the same,” he says instead. “It’s like you don’t age.”
There had been a plan.  Get everyone on a plane.  Take the scenic route and shout this out with everyone in the room.  Figure out what was going on with the Winter Solider thing.  Fix any brainwashing that had happened to Cap.  Get everyone to know what line to toe so Tony could fix this disaster before Ross got his hands on anyone.
Now, he just watches Barnes lean heavily into Steve’s space, a presence that seems to ground Steve in the moment.  Tony watches their space, or lack therefore of, with a moment of interest before dragging his gaze away. It’s similar to how he and Rhodey live in each other’s pocket.  Tony knows he forgets things sometimes, when he is comfortable.
“Don’t Bruce,” Tony hard lines.  “I asked once and was turned down. I’m not the desperate girl at the dance.”
Steve moves in slowly and Tony watches, beard twitching and giving away the smile threatening to spread across his face. His lips brush for a second, before pressing in for a chaste kiss. Tony chases him as Steve pulls away after a moment, half on top of Steve when their lips press again before peppering kisses all across Steve’s face, obnoxiously loud.
Maria grins.  “Oh you never know.”  Her smile softens. “Close your eyes Tony.  I’ll hold you until you go.”
An alert alarms and Tony looks back up to the whale thing flying overhead and shooting upwards.  “How much does it suck to get eaten?” He comms Bruce on the open channel.
Before, Bruce has spoken enough about the serum, and Steve not enough, so Tony had a few ideas on what could go wrong in the process.  But it’s still been something he’s thrown around in his head. Trying to figure out, idly, if he could solve the problem, better than his dad.
Steve looks up from where he is packing his supplies to Tony walking in a few hours later. They both freeze for a moment before Steve looks down at the case of paintings he was boxing up. "I'll be gone soon," Steve offers, eventually.
It's relief that fills him, hot and burning down his back until it settles somewhere in his stomach.
Tony turns minutely and stares at him for a long moment before smiling and saying, “Hi Steve.  Been a minute, huh?”
Steve turns away from them and scoops up the shield.  Tony keeps an eye out, and one guy looks back and lines up a shot at Steve's head.  "Behind," Tony barks, and Steve throws the shield up, and the shot pings loudly off the vibranium.
Thor takes the tech and puts it in his ear, before scanning the battlefield.  Thanos has gotten back up and is retreating. “I’ll take him,” he declares before rocketing off.  The Hulk and Falcon swing in to give him some back up.
“Now,” Tony pulls his hands out of his pockets and holds them in front of him, running the flat palms against each other.  “I didn’t mean to say something and run…” he trails off. He meets Steve’s eyes and lets his lips kick up, sincere. “But I’ve never been great at being honest and sentiment.”
[1] Absolutely true about Mengele and Eichmann.  They both fled to Argentina, then moved to Chile during some upheaval of the Argentinian government.  They died of old age- Mengle in South America, Eichmann in an Israeli prison. The camps are absolutely real in Chile.  Argentina is more of a legend, except for the dictator leanings towards Nazi-ism.  The Hitler portion has never been 100% proven.  (I had links but notes don't like that...  If you want links to articles let me know!!)
“Yeah,” Steve sighs.  “She remembers me sometimes.  Others she doesn’t, and those are the hardest moments.  When she sees me for her first time again.”
Peter moves his head side to side, thinking about the response before saying, “Well some day I may not have the magical stark tech everywhere, so I should learn basics anyway.  But any way, I was thinking -”
He’s adrift. “They died in a car crash,” he repeats the old story he’s told himself too many times. “Dad was drunk. They hit a pothole. He over-corrected and took them into a tree. Dad always hated seat belts, so it’s not a surprise he was thrown from the car. Mom.” Tony can’t. He leaves the thought there.  He shrugs when he focuses back in on Steve. “That’s why I have a driver.”
Tony rolls his shoulders as he quietly tells Friday to disassemble the suit into a second briefcase.  It slides off, leaving him in the hot summer sun in jeans and a t-shirt. “You must be a saint.”
Tiny him adjusts his grip on the screwdriver in his hands and looks down to the circuit board in his hand. "What are the parameters necessary to make someone a friend?"
The next reporter is a mousy brunette from the New York Times. "Mr. Stark, what do you think should be the next steps taken in regard to the W-" she begins before Everheart is standing and asking, "Did you know anything about the break out of the Falcon, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye and Ant Man from the RAFT facility where they were being held under the orders of the Secretary of State?"
He turns back to her, “Tony knows he isn’t supposed to annoy me when I am working.”  Tony does know.  He also knows his board will work.
Steve doesn’t look at the arm in horror.  Doesn’t look at him like he’s mix of Frankenstein and the monster, which he feels like on the worst days.  On the best days, he’s one or the other.
"I love you Peter.  You are a part of my family.  You can try and throw it away, but I'll always love you and have a place for you."
It feels like a thousand steps backwards from those days he sat in Tony's lab, and the world is changing, but why can't he?
“Humans weren’t meant to hold the gems.  Your race was never meant to be put in the war of Titans,” it continues, leaning on her scythe.  “But you,” it smiles, softly and full of the kind of things Death isn’t known for. It’s a trap, he realizes, a spider reeling a fly in.  He has a choice here.
Tony strolls into the kitchen a few weeks later, and there's Pepper standing there, sharing a cup of coffee with Steve. Tony had been in there 30 minutes earlier, drinking a smoothie and stealing bites of Steve's "too large even for him" frittata.  Tony had been teasing him about how he stunk post morning run around the compound, and Steve has just told him to be thankful it wasn't the middle of summer.
Then all the images around him start at once, the singing that sounded so far is suddenly too loud and just when Tony is going to let go to cover his ears, the other tightens its grip and waves it’s free hand.  Everything shatters and begins to fall and so do they.
.  Against the way Wanda looks out a window sometimes, fear deep in her eyes. Against the, what is it Nat says?  Oh, the red in his ledger.
Tony watches him, noting the move of the cameras as FRIDAY follows him too. "Fry, inform me if he-" he starts.
He pauses, taking into account her face, her age, and the room.  “Oh god,” he murmurs. Her face contorts and her hand twitches like she wants to go for her gun again.  “You don’t know about Michael yet do you?”
Steve pulls him in until Tony’s nose is buried into the crook of Steve’s neck, and he can feel the pulse against his cheek.  Can feel that he is alive and real. It’s a solid hug too. Steve grips him a little too tightly, like he does when he forgets his own strength.
He never looked the first time, but somehow he had to have tracked it or BARF is filling in the gaps - it's probably filling in the gaps, but Jarvis always cared more than any Stark deserved. But Jarvis puts down the dish he was cleaning, and bends down. "There are no parameters," Jarvis says. "You simply be yourself."
He looks at Steve wordlessly searching for something while Steve feels like he's in that conference room, sneaking glances at Tony, listening to himself and Clint talk and knows where this sends up.
Steve looks away, and Tony slings a hand over his shoulder pulling them together.  “See the best ideas are always the simplest, and the last week when we were talking about how things keep escalating how the world is more dangerous, how threats are more frequent...how our enemies are seemingly endless.  Well, Steve, that; a complex problem, but you had a pretty simple answer.”
"Are you," Steve pauses for a moment.  "Would it help if you were seen out and about with Captain America?  If there were pictures to kick up some good press?"
The room is dark without the simulation up and running. Friday turns on the lights as he moves through the room. He's a ghost workshop. The little light from the moon illuminates the place on the table where the shield lays, half under some rag that Tony isn't sure he threw or if one of the slumbering robots tossed.
“With bells on,” Fury replies, and Tony give his a grin that quickly turns to a grimace as he says, “I think I have to g-”
The haze when he looks down, the inability to see the ground.  The lack of greenery. The way the sun is too large and too close clues Tony into the fact the Earth isn’t doing too well.
she is a patchwork girl, held together by the seams she has done herself, done by other people, by the pieces she has stolen from others
There is a suit of armor in the lab, grey and gunmetal and big. It's got better firepower, turns on a goddamn dime, and can only be used by James Rhodes. It's almost done, but Tony's not sharing it until Rhodey asks. Until he wants it. He doesn't want to overstep. He's not sure if this is the end of War Machine or if his friend will hand it over to someone else.
“No,” Tony says as he takes off the tie and suit jacket, throwing them over the table littered with tools.  “Give me five minutes to myself before those mother hens descend.”  He drops into a chair before the monitors.  FRIDAY pulls up CNN, Fox, and a few others.  They are all chatting about the UN meeting, but there is a sixth monitor that shows a live satellite feed from Wakanda.
Something in the back of his head starts screaming, so Tony looks away and scans the field for Thanos.  He finds him holding Strange in the grip of the gauntlet. The other man is glowing faintly purple, arms outstretched and held flat.  Strange jerks and Thanos growls before yanking his hand in.
“How did you come up with?” Dad says as he takes the board from Tony.  Tony shrugs as his father turns it over.
Tony was always part of the plan, but Wanda looks at Steve's blank mask and sees in a way she shouldn't. Then Strange appears in a portal out of no where, with the rest of the Tony's group from the earlier fight.
"Yes sir. Mr. Rogers, if you take a look at the tablet, you will notice an icon for the Avengers. This file will include…"
“I’m trying to do as you asked Aunt Peg.  I’m trying really hard,” he says, staring out that damn window.  “Starks.  We bring all the attention in the room on us.  You need to keep the attention off your work and your family.”
,” Spidey says.  “Yes.”  Bruce and Tony look at each other for a moment, and Tony sees the exasperated,
She takes a few steps forward, and there is no whine, no noise.  It simply moves along with her, like it’s her real leg just encase in one of his boots.  She does some quick running in place, and the back opens minutely to cool down the leg.
He waves and walks away.  Pepper’s tracking him and not the intern presenting.  He tilts his head in her direction before he slips out the auditorium.
Tony tilts his head back to her.  “You always need someone to make sure you’re not becoming a supervillian.”
Steve will smile and take the words at the value of Tony’s patent sarcastic tone. They will part, and that will be it for this thing. They’ll work together when the need arises. Tony will spend some more time in California, than New York, but he misses the sun and the crashing of the waves.
He’s in the middle of a familiar yet unfamiliar lab.  He’s seen this mess in pictures, his dad’s arm around another man, older, stooped in a way that is familiar to Tony now.  It’s the look of someone who has seen his creation turned against him and the world. Something that was supposed to be good has turned evil.
The lens on the suit get large for a second, taking in the empty room, before narrowing to slits.  "But Cap said you were the one who decided to recruit me."
Something inside of him had always balked at becoming that obsessed with a single creation that it being gone would be like carving a piece of himself out, so he had turned away from the super soldier prompts.
The few times Steve had talked about being under the ice, he had mentioned something like this.  It had been after a nightmare, and Steve had had to push out the words between chattering teeth. “It’s like I can’t get warm,” he had admitted.  “Like the ice has gone down to his bones.”)
“Hey can you two stop being soft and let me ask Tony some questions?” Peter’s voice carries from the hall.
Steve's head snaps up from where he's testing the pace on the latest SI treadmill.  The Board loves that they are getting into fitness equipment.  Pepper just leveled a glance across the table at him.
The video goes back to the reporter.  “There is has been footage of Falcon flying outside the camp, warding off Iranian troops from the air.”  The video cuts to Sam in the air from a distance and he swoops down, Red Wing ahead of him, as Iranian troops scatter without a shot fired.
The leader of the group shoots, and Steve drops down, shield out front, as he runs for the nearest table.  Sparks fly, and Tony watches as Steve calculates the angle and then throws the shield out, taking the legs out of three of the guys.  Their shots go wild, and it takes out one of the two remaining upright guys. Steve is already running at the last one, who can't take a shot as Steve leaps on the tables, then kicks off a pillar and throws an arm around the guy's throat as he spins until he lands behind the guy. The other man struggles for a moment before the oxygen deprivation becomes too much.
Tony ends up having to spend a week in Vienna to discuss the changes with the UN.  The ambassadors are interested in the changes, and in the wake of the news breaking that Zemo was the one to cause the attack, not the Winter Soldier, they are more than willing to listen to him.
Tony nods and goes back to his work. Steve looks at his painting and decides that is enough for the day. He cleans up, puts things away and grabs his sketchbook before Tony cuts in with, "You don't have to leave every time I come in."
You shouldn't contact me again on this phone.  All Avenger digital channels are being monitored by the UN.
He struggles with the lid before looking to Tony who is watching him carefully, like he's a live wire. "We thought it would be better if I kept all of this down here. It was getting cramped in my room," he says sheepishly, careful not to place the blame on Natasha.
Tony stands there and thinks about silence, about friendship and thinks the noise the shield made against the suit.  He thinks about his mother’s fading smile.  His father’s stern face.  The thinks about Obie and Pepper.  Peter’s carefree grin.  Bruce at work.  The picture of the frozen face is lined with pain in the glass chamber projected in the lab.
But the way he curls Tony’s name, the utter reverence that Tony has only ever heard from Tony’s mouth is on the level with very few things that Tony has in his life. He squeezes Tony’s hand, holding on as tightly as he can, lifting himself up.
“Oh I’m going to have to name you all,” Tony mutters on the comm channel.  “Giant, No Nose, Hoodie, and Raccoon.” There are a few chuckles on the time, a few different riff on the names.
Tony's fingers begin to beat on the top of the chair. They've only tested with regular movement, but his mind races when he contemplates how would the prosthetic work under more intense situations. Like sprinting or a quick change of direction? He would have to check the calibrations they currently have on the motors. Maybe upgrade the chips. See if he can build some predictive programming into the chips. Or make the exoskeleton less manual and more AI related.
(“It’s tied to her emotions,” he had said once, faintly watching the scene.  “We need to work on her emotional reactions.”
Steve stands there, silent.  Judging.  Tony smiles, ragged and worn down,  “Just like the real you.”
Tony learns about T’Challa’s sister who is so beyond them all at technology, who breathes it and chatters endlessly, but is still his younger sister who loves to mock her older brother.  How it makes some uncomfortable about how willing she is to shame the King.  How he has to exert his own influence with his counsel, people who have seen him grown up and age and know what he was like at three, thirteen, twenty three, and now.
Tony isn't in the frame. Just discarded takeout, the bots drifting closer, the scattered remnants of a project, the armors on the right in the distance.
They eat  spaghetti and meatballs, and Spiderman tells stories from SI that has everyone eyeing Tony, but not actually saying anything to either of them. Tony drops stories from his college years, pulling out the most embarrassing but children appropriate ones that has Rhodey yelling corrections over him.  Vision works with FRIDAY to bring up evidence of the misdeeds, and Bruce softly distracts them with stories of his work in the middle east.  Tales of small children, sick mothers, helping birth babies.  His eyes are soft, and Spidey’s lenses adjust quietly, enough that Tony knows he’s recording all of this for later.
Tony cracks open the bottle and takes a sip before replying.  “When I signed, I signed with the contingency that my lawyers were going to take a look and suggest changes.  The UN had to vote on any changes to amend the accords.”  Tony shrugs.  “My lawyers came back with round one of their findings.  I’m going to present them in the next session.”
Steve stills for a moment, taking in Tony before picking his way over.  People part between them, like the Red Sea before Moses, and Tony has to bite his lip to keep from laughing.  Even now, he still has the sort of charisma that people don’t even know affect them.
Steve doesn't know if when he dies in the battle if there will be any impact to his younger self. He thinks it won't be an issue.
"No," Tony bites out. It's rushed, a bit too quick, but Vision tilts his head in a manner that is so very him that Tony can finally breathe. "No," he adds. "Vision come back to the Tower. It's your birthplace after all."
The third time, he wakes up to a sleepy hospital room.  It’s mostly dark, so it’s easy to take a look around at the blurry outlines of things.  Machines, waiting chairs, a Steve like figure in plain clothes in the corner bathed in a soft blue glow.  He thinks,
“Saving the world stuff, huh?” Tony retorts as he sits at the table.  “You ever going to retire from that?”
Most people look away at that point, muttering to themselves and nodding.  Even the ones who came with him. Tony knows he’s the villain in a lot of people’s stories right now.  He knew it would lean this way the second he took his stance on the Registration Bill. He had been fine with it.  He had known it was for the best, and they would see it eventually.
.  A jagged crack opens up and out of the screaming echoes of all of time, all of death, comes Death again. It swings it’s scythe and everyone on Thanos’ side falls, immediately, like gravity has suddenly become too much for them.
“Everything you said mattered a little less.”  Bruce catches the thread of his thought.  His knuckles aren’t as white as they were a second ago.
He looks up to yell at the person who nearly hit him with an armored whale when he sees War Machine hovering as he gazes downwards.  Tony spins, and looks across the ground. Peter is still fighting, somersaulting in the air actually. Natasha and Clint are looking to the right, before someone yells and they both refocus on the fight.
Spidey huff a laugh behind him.  “Says the man whose mobile development group presented the glitchiest tablet known to man in an internal demo yesterday.  I think they handed it to the interns because they can’t fix it.”
He moves towards the wet bar, looking for the scotch and then redirecting once he finds it.  Now isn’t the time.  “But me?  I sit here and try and keep my R&D department from crashing while making the pretty little weapons you guys so nicely request.”
(“I used to cook for Wanda,” he had said, softly.  The metal planes of his face so reminiscent of his when Pepper has said, “Tony, I
Tony grunts as he sits up. "I think Ross swooped in while we were on our way out and grabbed them before the UN knew about it. I need to put some feelers out to figure out what exactly went down there."
Panther had been pissed about not being able to take out Winter Solider, but Tony had promised him fifteen minutes alone once they figured out what the hell was going on.  It wasn’t like he hadn’t tagged the suit in case he needed to shock some sense into the King.  Probably would have landed him in the RAFT, but whatever got everyone to shut up and sit down.
“Okay,” he states. Steve’s mouth opens and closes a few times. “You’re worrying me Steve. What’s going on?”
“It was all them,” Perez returns softly.  “Also that leg from Mark II that you left on Peter’s desk a month ago.  I’ve never heard noise so high pitched come out of that girl.”
and there are a few giddy snickers that seem more nerves than humor, if Tony’s honest. “ - back up,” Steve finally finishes, looking frustrated, and a little like he wants to punch something.   A face Tony is intimately familiar with, and once, knew how to handle.
When there is an issue with a piece of software, an engineer runs their code through a debugger.  It helps them take a second glance at everything, step by step, until they can find the source of the issue.
Reed levels him with a heavy, knowing look, and Tony meets his gaze evenly replying before Reed can say anything too loud like,
Natasha doesn’t voice it, but she doesn’t think Tony was hoping for them to save him. He was hoping to disappear, leave them behind as whatever happened with the government went down.
Steve is crossing the room steadily, getting closer to him as he talks, but Tony doesn’t care.  Can’t care. “I’m not your Tony. I stopped being him the second you died because I had to white knuckle my way though  everything after. I did that to you Steve, and the Tony who did that to you wasn’t someone I wanted to be.”
[1] Chinese weapon with a pole and a blade on the end, because wtf does Nomad fight with?  It looks like a giant shovel
BARF automatically shuts down at the end of the memory, and Tony sits in his dimly lit lab and repeats, “Okay.”
The tug is strengthens as he tells her the story of the Infinity Gems.  Of where he knows they have been. The Time Stone in New York with the sorcerers.  The Mind Stone in a scepter used long after she is dead. The Reality Stone in Asgard.  The Soul Stone hidden on a planet in the middle of nowhere. The Space stone held in the Tesseract, hidden somewhere in the depths of SHIELD. The Power stone held with a collector in the middle of space.  She holds his hands in hers, grip tight in hands smoother than his.
Tony wakes in stages until he meets Steve's eyes and starts.  He tries to pull his hand away and Steve tightens his grip.
When Tony looks back at the scene from before, Thanos is yanking the Time stone out of the amulet before throwing it away.  Strange follows, the purple glow fading as he arcs in the air, limp. Vision plucks him out of the air, and Strange is bleeding at the temple, his eyes are red, but his mouth is moving as he waves his hands in small tight circles.  Then he flings something sharp and orange that flares out into a net. Thanos raises his hand, and the reality stone (and Tony knows this information intimately, somehow, even though no one has told him before) brightens before the orange net thing disappears.
“You’re always that weird,” Bucky replies.  “But you are being extra weird.  So do whatever you need to in order to stop it.”
He lands on the balcony of the palace with guards approaching from every corner.  Tony stands there in the suit until the face plate pulls back.  “Woah,” he says, hands upraised.  “I’m just taking a buddy up on an offer to drop by and visit.”
Steve surveys the battlefield and catches Thanos advancing on Wanda in between other superheroes jumping in and out of the way, trying to slow his assault.  “Wanda,” he answers.
He shrugs before taking a bite.  “Two men, two women, two non binary genders, two penguins.  Any mix of those, except the penguins because marrying animals are not okay,” Tony pauses.  “I know you guys had gay men in the 40’s, so what’s going on here.”
(“It’s in a tattoo,” Steve tells him later.  “They use it to help interact with wearables.  About 100 years back they were doing patches but we evolved into tattoos once you are over the age of 16.  I don’t know all the details, but we can find you some literature if you want to learn more.
She had searched the crowd for him, just for a moment, but he had shrunk back.  He still doesn’t know if she ever knew he was there.  What she thought when she wouldn’t find him.
"I love your steady, quieter love,” Tony whispers, like it’s a secret.  “I know things are hard and I can be...a lot on a good day, so thanks for sticking around.
Thor looks at them, and Steve sees the way Tony has his back up, none of his carefree posture.  The way Natasha is watching him like he's a live grenade.
Tony lays there in Siberia, aching from every inch of his body. His false rib cage is broken. The suit is still powered, running at close to 38%.  On his screen, the list of different systems damaged, or in need of repairs, requires scrolling.  Frost is beginning to crawl up his suit as he turns the internal heater down to conserve power.  He’s starting to lose feeling in his ears and nose.
“I consider you a friend,” T’Challa says softly.  “I do not have many people in my life who see me as an equal.  I believe we could be great friends.”
Tony had pushed other work in front of him.  "I'm not neuro-typical enough for this process.  We can get a scan of Happy's brain, would that work?"
like Howard could always sell.  It bust into the market in time for Christmas 1974, making millions, destroying any small computing company and launching SI into the black for the most long lasting time with an actual consumer product and not just income from military sales.
The room is littered with parts, tools, and small things that look like Captain America memorabilia.  Tony remembers that was a part of what kept SI afloat in the early days.
He starts sketching, which turns into painting. He can drift, not think about how he is just in a holding pattern. A gun waiting to be pointed. A monkey in a suit.
The sunlight from the open windows gleams off Vision on the unnatural way Tony has adjusted to over time. It took some time, after the relief and childish glee that it worked, that they were alive, wore off, but Tony adjusted.
“Why?” Tony asks.  Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Steve stop drawing, but watching them both.
Rhodey's eyes crinkle a little bit. "Not any to report, like there weren't any issues with the last versions, all sixteen of them apparently."
“Can we talk about the fact that you named my very sophisticated AI Karen like this is some 80’s teen movie.  Karen? You can’t have any originality?” Tony retorts while he raises his shoulders and the back of the suit fans out before shooting out some of the larger missiles towards a pack of the Chitauri on the flying vehicles.
Tony flexes his hand and the blade shifts back into the suit, nanobots returning back to their normal formation in the arc reactor on his chest.  He looks back across the field, and, accidentally, meets Thanos’ gaze. In the middle of the crowded battlefield, and he knows, knows that Thanos knows.  Knows he’s basically glowing with the green of the time gem he can feel under his skin ever since Death appeared.
He cleans the countertop for a moment before he looks back up to Steve.  “Did you know Jarvis taught me this recipe?” he says instead. Steve watches him before shaking his head. “It was my mother’s, and her grandmothers before it, but she taught it to Jarvis years before I was born.  I didn’t learn it until after she died.”
“What are you going to do while I am out?” Steve asks as he leans across the kitchen counter as Tony slowly eats his oatmeal.
Their trio dance through the halls of the house, laughing.  Tony is charged to read a book a week and explain it to Ana in rambling conversations where she asks question after question until it dissolves into an impossible theory about what it all means that makes no sense to Tony until the third discussion when she pulls him close and whispers, “Never assume the narrator knows everything. Even if the narrator knows everything, they don’t and they only see it through their own vision.”
Silence spreads between them.  Loud and deafening.“Do I need to be concerned?” the king says, finally getting to the real reason behind everything.
It takes a moment before Thanos stands, and roars, “Where is it?”  He swings his gaze across the stilled battlefield, eyes bouncing from each person.  “Where have you hidden the rest of the Time Gem?”
"I'm scared of being vulnerable first," Steve does say.  "Sometimes it feels like you wear your heart out there, waiting for someone to target it."
The first time in over two years that Tony sees Steve in person is across a room, and for the first time in a while, he feels a limb that doesn’t exist. The screeching pain that came from the destroyed arm.  The shaking that left his whole body rattling by the end if he jarred himself just right.
The other version of him, the one who hasn't lived through the snap and all those hours in the lab where he and Tony had relearned each other, meets his eyes for a second before they take off running.
She takes another sip, and they both stare out at Manhattan below them.  The nightlife beginning to pick up and the lights of cars as they move down the blocks.  There is a white smattering across the tops of some buildings, and some lit up trees lining the blocks.
“No,” Steve says, sincerely.  “I mean it. You don’t have to.  I have enough that you can sit back and do whatever you want.”
Tony starts shaking, feeling like he is going to rattle out of his skin. He buries himself further into Steve, uncaring of how it looks.  Just knows that Steve lets him.
.  He thinks about how far away that desperation feels now. “There are worse ways,” he retorts mildly.
Bruce whirls around arms in the air, muttering obscenities and green crawling up his neck at a lazy pace.  Peter chuckles into his arm, and Tony pulls him in a little closer slowing down their pace. Rhodey catches his eye before staring up a spirited conversation with the others, so they leave the other two behind a little bit.
“It’s nothing!” Peter rockets out of his seat and starts looking at the exits for the best escape.  “I’ll just talk to Fry.”
“I met Rihan,” Peter’s companion waves.  “She was working on the prosthetic group from the get go, and we decided to team up on a fully functional leg prosthetic that was similar to Iron Man’s boots.”
, but instead he turns back to Fury, “You got the date?  You’ll call her? She’ll be there?” Because he doesn’t want to see the heartbreak in her face when he replies,
Howard thinks for a moment, taking another sip as his eyes go distant before sharpening back on Tony.  “Good ideas, not great at execution. He usually needs some refinement, but Jack doesn’t like him. Thinks he’s selling secrets, but he needs proof.”
Tony catches Clint smile, and Steve’s easy grin.  It’s an old Avengers protocol back from when they were training the second generation to become the primary team, after Ultron.  Keep the thing the enemy wants moving, from person to person through misdirection and active deception while having a few designated runners get it out of the battlefield as possible.
(He goes down after the call ends though.  Steve greets him with his steady sort of joy, familiar, like a well worn path in a forest.
Tony can’t bring himself to care about the destruction around him, drum up the emotions, instead something in him itches, like when he’s in the suit and hits the villain of the week a little harder just because he wants a fight. Wants to get his fist in someone’s face and just wants to work off this energy.
She tosses her head back, and it’s strange to see shades of Peggy, younger, fierce and determined and unlined in Sharon’s stance that he had never noticed before.  “Now are you going to do this or not?”
She places the gun down on the table.  “Why are you,” Peggy’s face twists with distaste. “Time traveling?”
She rushes him, hands around his waist before he can think.  He’s stiff at first, and the watch beeps.  He takes in a few breathes before he relaxes and pats her arm hesitantly.  “You’re welcome.”  Rihan pulls back abruptly, blush turning into a sunburnt shade.  “Let me know if you need anything else,” he says to both of them.
Tony leaves early in, bracketed by Rhodey and Pepper. Steve watches from one of the many tinted windows as they ease him into the car.
Tony opens his mouth and then shuts it for a moment. Steve can feel the brush begin to give under his hands so he sets it down. "It's pretty untested. It could tear us apart at an atomic level."
“Yes,” the other says.  “You changed things. Minor things that have butterflied out in different ways, but you’ll see them, eventually.”  It’s smile turns wry. “Every breath has an impact on the world, and your actions have always more than something that simple.”
This time he opens his eyes to the too large sun under the Wakanda sky.  The world is whiting out at the edges and the everything is moving like it’s been slowed down.  There is a spark of green on his skin and he knows the gem’s power is dancing on the edge of skin.
.  They are just connectors.  Wires in flat copper lines that connect one thing to another, a battery to a light.  The ram and the microprocessor for a computer.
“You won’t talk of my wife in that way,” Jarvis states, firm. He takes a step closer to Maria, and this time she doesn’t move.  “You are drunk and will leave this room,
Tony rolls his eyes.  “Oh my god, you are the worst Aunt Peg,” he utters before taking a gulp.  “Absolute worst.”
She steps away and holds his face in her hands.  “Oh darling,” she whispers. “How I’ve prayed for you.”
He wants to cry. He wants to rage. He wants to scream. He wants to beg for them back. There is a hand on his shoulder, and Jarvis, white haired and looking ancient, stands there beside him steady. “Yeah,” he says, voice even. “That’s Maria Stark.”)
They watch him move swiftly, and the second he’s out of sight, FRIDAY has a display projected in front of him as he slips into a seat at the table.  Vision observes with a small smile at the counter where he is putting the finishing touches on the brownie dough, and Rhodey continues cooking, loudly narrating how he is going to kill Tony if he doesn’t get his ass up here
There is so much he wants to see, so many moments with his team - his family, that he wants.  He wants to see Pepper finally realize who her true person is. He wants to see Sharon rise through the ranks of SHIELD and take over from Fury.  He wants to see Peter graduate. He wants to see Bruce finally settle enough to accept both sides of himself. He wants to see what changes T’Challa makes upon the world. He wants to see Rhodey become a general, and annoy him in his office.
“You didn’t force me to do anything,” Bruce says finally.  “I am a grown man with issues backing away from bleeding edge scientific discoveries.  See my Mr Hyde for a prime example.”
“No Tony,” Rhodey absently responds with.  He grabs onto Tony’s feet and starts rubbing down Tony’s arches.
Bruce clocks her immediately, but doesn’t move, just watches her from across the room with the same steadiness he watches Tony interact.  She does something that makes Bruce grin a little ruefully, but it’s the hesitant “Mr. Stark” that gets him to turn.
He spends more time at the compound, after. Natasha narrows her eyes at him on day three but never says anything.  He keeps strange hours in the lab.  Maybe avoiding people, maybe avoiding himself.  The line is hard to determine these days.
It hurts to think about that, and he closes his eyes, hoping that will push the lump in his throat back down. He falls back asleep, blanket clutched tightly between his fists thinking,
Jarvis reaches for Maria, but she dances away from him with ease.  “No I won’t listen to this. You are filling his head with nonsense Ana, and I won’t stand it.”
“Good,” she voices.  “Have you been going to meetings?”  And Tony laughs, before she rolls her eyes.  “You at least have a sponsor?”
Tony shakes his head immediately.  “You need to stay out of this. It works out right now, and I need you to not mess it up.”
It falls from his lips, easily and he repeats it until Tony’s face clears. Steve stands there, waiting for something and Tony pulls him in easily. He places his hands on Steve’s cheeks, looks into his eyes, and says, “Are you sure?”
FRIDAY obligingly pulls up the prototypes in the directory. “I’m thinking we go truly science fiction and nanobots.  Cure cancer, allow guys to walk again, accelerated healing without all that nasty radiation.”
The words calm the singing he can’t seem to escape, and all of a sudden, all Tony can hear is his own breathing in his own ears as the time stone buzzes over his skin before receding.  Sharon leans close and brushes her forehead against his. “Did you forget your promise to me big brother?”
She crosses the distance on the dirt road between her and the young man when there is a crack of a shot as the boy blows up.  Wanda is a few feet away, eyes bright as she waves her hands in a desperate bid to control the flames.  They spiral into a column of fire, and Tony holds his breath, remembering Lagos.  She continues rotating the explosion until it burns itself out.  Nothing explodes.  No one is injured. The entire scene is over in five minutes.
He uses the upraised hand to clip Falcon’s wings with a quick repulsor blast, watches as he crashes into the snow.  The impostor goes green slowly, and that’s how Tony knows he’s dead. Natasha’s long haired and tries to take him out a new gunshots that bounce off the suit.  She comes at him hand to hand, and Tony aims for her face when he shoots. He watches her turn green before looking in the distance for the third.
It’s like watching two shooting stars across the sky, something beautiful and potentially devastating.  He knows Rhodey makes it, knows how this ends, but as the other man gets closer and close to the ground, Tony closes his eyes against the image of the impact.
Peter sighs.  “Well, things change around here a lot, and I was just thinking there might be a day when I’m not welcome and I wanted to make sure I had some back up plans.”
He redirects and takes a seat on the couch in the corner. The old one he used to use in the tower that got moved here. For continuity's sake he had declared, back before Steve had tried to put his shield through Tony's chest.
There is an uneasy silence after that for a long moment, before Wanda finally speaks. “He’s going to come after the stones.”  She looks from Vision to Strange to, eventually, Tony with a sort of heaviness that feels final. “Should we use ‘shell game’’ protocols?”
Steve comes off the wall, takes half a step before stopping, like he doesn’t know what to do. Tony can’t feel his fingers. “Hydra had them killed.”
Steve looks up from the sketchbook balanced on his knee and over at Tony who is watching him with clear eyes. He’s been awake for a while, and Steve never caught it.
“Mr. Stark, when I woke up in this era, I had no one, nothing.  You gave me a purpose, somewhere to belong. You gave me a
He laughs, sharp and broken and so so tired.  “I don’t know if I can do it without you.” He has to pause to let the paper stop shaking even though he knows the words by heart.  “I certainly won’t do it as well,” he admits, quietly.
Steve doesn't look down at the desk, at the small video she has looping of Clint from a pixelated security feed. He has a hood but, but he stops and holds up a hand to the camera for a second before looking directly in the camera.
“I,” he starts before grimacing and finishes the glass before standing up. He pours himself another finger or three of scotch, tasting it before starting up again. “I keep looking down the line at the next five years, ten years and beyond even, and wonder if it’s worth it. If any of this,” he gestures with his glass. “Is worth what I am going to have to do to make it okay.”
His mind whirls at the concept of going to the tower.  The chance his own tech is hole up somewhere and he can use that to interface with some of the things he has been trying to work on.  Bridge the gap he has with the technology currently at his fingertips and still can’t understand.
Tony laughs at the idea. “I think people would say that about me.” Steve grips his shoulders before slipping in his tongue, exploring the cavern of Tony’s mouth, inch by inch. When he pulls back, foreheads pressed together, they are both gasping for air.
The loud discussion pulls Peggy into the room, Daniel trailing behind.  With a quick glance around the room, at the stand off between Maria and Jarvis and the way Tony is hiding against Ana, they quickly discern the situation.  Peggy moves to Maria, quietly calming her before taking her from the room. Tony watches as they both have tears in their eyes.
lapsed Catholic things he does from time to time.  Tony puts a lid on the nervous energy he has rattling around him after the whole Peter thing as best he can.  Tony reaches out and laces his fingers with Steve's.
