Shame overtakes the arousal filling Tony’s body at the whine he lets out when Steve withdraws his fingers. His breath catches in his throat like someone’s wrapped their hands around his neck when the head of Steve’s cock catches on his hole.
“With all due respect sir, I have to agree with the Captain,” JARVIS said.
Enjoy this chapter!
Natasha eyed him with a look in her eyes that he couldn’t quite place. “Fair enough. I’ll let Fury know.”
Steve shifted in his seat, Tony's eyes following the movement like a cat. Tony rose from his seat, goblet forgotten, and glided over to Steve, his hands trailing along the table. How would those clever hands feel upon his skin?
got carried away. I got swept up in it."
Steve kisses him like a thief, all greedy and ruthless, stealing his breath away. Steve walks them backward until Tony feels his legs hit his sofa. They stumble onto the couch, Steve lying on top of him, eclipsing Tony.
And Pepper was great, really. She was beautiful and willful and as sharp as a tack. She and Steve had bonded over worrying about Tony who had called them both mother hens while rolling his eyes. Pepper had said that she and Steve were the only ones who had sense.
“I hate you.”
She rolls her eyes, but it's all in good fun. "Well, then, I'm happy for you. You deserve all the love that comes your way."
"Hey," Steve says softly like he's comforting a spooked horse. "
Tony walked (JARVIS would say strut but really, what did he know?) onto the platform that was positioned in the epicenter of his workshop.
“Please,” Tony said, cursing how his voice wavered. “You’ve barely touched me. I’m not gonna break, Rogers.”
It was too late to back down as Tony continued to spout absolute filth into his ear.
And regardless if this was some hallucination induced by the migraine, a spell, or the afterlife, or
Steve wants to do it again. He wants to fuck Tony again, and the scary thing is, Tony’s going to let him. Arousal pools in his belly as he lifts his head to look at Steve head-on.
my life needed saving?”
Steve held out his hand. "At least let me help you clean yourself up."
,” Tony thinks bitterly.
Life goes on. Tony reunites with Pepper. Tony’s mansion gets blown up. He loses Pepper for the final time.
"Did you think about this? Think about me? Because I thought about you, how hot, how fucking
“I…I honestly don’t know how to respond to that.”
, and Steve finds himself kissing him a bit harder, chasing that warmth,
“I know! I know it’s just...we haven’t spoken at all about...the
Tony pulled back and thought of the picture he made with his swollen lips all pink and shiny with saliva, lashes wet with unshed tears. “On my face. Do it on my face,” he said and for good measure opened his mouth and stuck out his tongue.
Tony and Nat find the base's command center, while Thor keeps going, muttering under his breath.
Steve’s hands hesitate at his sides before he wraps Tony up in his arms, the full heat of his body engulfing Tony. He melts into Steve’s side, letting a sigh of contentment escape. There’s no sound but the sound of their breathing melding together; Tony’s bedroom might as well be on another planet, he and Steve, the sole occupants. It’s a comfortable silence, one that Tony doesn’t feel the need to fill for once with inane chatter. For the first time in years, he feels safe. He feels loved.
“I don’t know what’s going on with you anymore,” Happy said. “The world’s getting weird.”
Pepper continued her trek towards the stairs.
"Tony, please," he begged, uncaring of how he might have sounded. "Please let me come."
"Can you feel it?"
“Of course. As long as I can help out.”
“Well, I was until someone decided to care about my well-being or whatever,” Tony said. “Stupid Rhodey,” He grumbled for good measure.
He wanders without direction, letting his feet carry him wherever they fancy. Seldom does Tony get quiet moments to himself like this. There was always a fire to put out, a project to work on, kittens to rescue from trees, that sort of thing. Not that he ever doubted her, but maybe Pepper was right. Maybe he
Mind made up, he said, “If it’s alright with SHIELD, I wouldn’t mind doing missions. As long as they let me stay at the Tower.”
Steve, bastard that he is, withdraws his fingers from Tony's entrance, and if Tony whines, that's between him and God.
"Gonna miss you, buddy," Bucky said softly, his voice hoarse.
means to me."
"Ouch," he says, rubbing his arm. "I've been busy."
Steve tilts Tony's head up, and they don't say anything after that. Not for a while.
“Dream?”
Steve, damn him, doesn’t take the bait. The corner of his mouth lifts up in a facsimile of a smile. “Something like that,” he says.
“Welcome aboard, Captain,” Natasha said with a lazy salute. “Glad to officially have you.”
Tony sighs. He’s too old to be having this conversation and telling Steve the truth would just be mortifying. “
Tony arched a dark brow. “No? What am I then?”
"Is that a joke?" Bruce says, throwing his fork down, sending it clattering against his plate. "Do you really think unleashing a big green rage monster at a carnival with children present is a bright idea?"
“I wouldn’t expect anything less.”
There goes Tony's heart again, beating like it wants to leap out of his chest and directly into Steve's hands. He hears the unspoken words in Steve's condition, and he realizes that that's precisely what he's doing. Handing Steve his heart on a silver platter.
"So sensitive," Tony murmured. "I wonder what would happen if I did this…." Instead of just licking, Tony took the head of Steve's cock into his mouth. Steve's free hand shot out from his side and fisted into Tony's hair.
The sound of children squealing pulls him from his thoughts and brings a smile to his face. Carmen had spared no expense, not that he expected any less, as he takes in the Tilt-a-Whirl lifting its arms higher and higher. The riders throw their arms up in the air, their laughter carrying on the wind. For today, they would get to fly too.
… but I like it here. I like working with Bruce and the movie nights and the team dinners and…I like you. Once you get past all the hard assery and the spangles…you’re not that bad to be around, Winghead.”
“Close, but no,” Rhodey says and Tony loves him even more for that. “I want some candied yams. Don’t even need anything else with them.”
There's the finger painting table where plenty of toddlers and adults alike are flinging paint onto sheets of canvas. One kid rises from the face painting table with Cap's shield emblazoned upon his cheek and a booth over...there's Steve, drawing caricatures for the kids. There's a curve to his lips. Steve's biting back a smile at the little boy trying (and failing) to sit still in his chair as he draws him. Tony's heart jumps at the sight. He's tempted to slide into the line for Steve's booth himself, but something holds him back. It could be the look of contentment on Steve's face or the kid's near infectious excitement—Tony feels like he's intruding on something private. Someone else's life. Someone else's dream.
"Um, okay," Tony says. He's never, never been at a loss for words in his life, and yet...
Tony closed his eyes, a soft groan escaping his lips. A dark, teasing part of him wanted to hesitate and see what Steve would do. Would he grow impatient and fist those big hands in Tony’s hair? Would he grind Tony’s face into his groin and force him to take it? Just the mere thought of the scenarios had Tony’s cock hardening in his uniform.
Steve’s hands shook as he reached for the cup.
Tony rolled his eyes; trust his AI to be just as sarcastic as him. Had it not been directed at him, Tony would have been proud of how far JARVIS had come. His boy could express
Tony’s body seized, pushing away from the table with a strength that surprised even himself. He had to leave, now. He was in danger, he could feel it deep down in his bones. He was in danger and he wasn’t in his suit, fuck, where the hell was his suit? Tony scrambled for the exit, startling the patrons of the bar. Mark 7, gleaming in the Malibu sun, was a sight for sore eyes. The suit parted open for him immediately, engulfing him whole.
Steve lifts his arm, "Here," he says. "Lean into me." Tony does just that and tucks his body into Steve's side, his arm is a reassuring weight around him.
“You feel so
Steve had been kissed before but not like this. Never like this, with someone tugging at his hair, pain, and pleasure stitching together to leave Steve hard and leaking pre-come in his trousers.
“One hundred and one. How does it feel?”
“I should tell you to go to sleep,” Pepper says, sighing. “But I miss the sound of your voice too much.” She’s sitting at the island, a cup of coffee in hand. She had pulled her hair into a bun and still has her reading glasses on, the red ones that she hates because she thinks she looks like someone's grandmother.
Five seconds. For five seconds, he would be the most powerful man in the universe. For five seconds, he considered being selfish.
“I’ve bathed. And eaten. All the important things.”
“We told him eleven,” Natasha said, “whether or not he shows up on time is up to him.”
“The old man deserved it.”
“No,” she said. “I wouldn’t expect you to.”
“Tony,” Steve murmured, testing the name out loud. It wasn’t like any of the names common to Brooke’s smallfolk, but given Tony’s appearance and accent, Steve figured that he must have migrated from a neighboring kingdom. Steve decided that the name suited Tony.
Steve arches a brow. “Oh, yeah? I see how it is. How about for a chance to peek at your notes I...”
? If Natasha was here, then of course Tony was here too. Along with the rest of the Avengers. A deep sadness swelled inside of him. Tony and Nat were going to die again and what could he do to stop it? If this was truly Hell, absolutely nothing.
?” he said, his voice sounding incredibly small.
"Look at their shading," Steve says, thankfully not addressing the elephant in the room. "Wish I had drawn like that at their age."
spend in your workshop?”
But if he was mom, who was dad?
"No," Tony admitted. "But it makes me curious."
All the tables along the walls had been filled, leaving Tony and Rhodey to sit in the center of the restaurant. Tony could feel everyone’s eyes on him and Rhodey like they were bacteria meant to be examined under a microscope. He knew that he could say something and everyone’s eyes would snap away from them but then he’d look like the bad guy. He supposed it was fine seeing as everyone had been keeping their distance, although that still didn’t stop a prickling sensation from crawling up and down his neck.
“Happy will know for sure,” Tony said and with a wave of his hand, the hologram of Mark 42 he had been working on vanished. “He’s been watching Pepper like a hawk.”
“Who said you could come early,” Tony says, but he’s all smiles. Steve can’t help but smile back as he shakes away his shock, his nerves and steps closer to the genius.
“That traitor!”
“I’m gonna sleep downstairs,” she replied, her voice like ice. “Tinker with that.”
“Look at what? You watching them? Flip the screen, Hap.”
With his tousled hair and kiss-swollen lips, Tony had the look of a vixen. Beautiful. Dangerous. Alluring.
“With you,” Steve confirmed. “Always with you.”
Tony closes his eyes and simply lets himself
Tony deals with New York by refusing to talk about it at all. Pepper, Rhodey, and Happy express their concern.
"Thank you," Tony says, massaging his temple, trying to stop his stress headache before it begins."It's like having children."
“They need to look strong,” Rhodey continued. “Stopping the Mandarin is priority, but it’s not—”
, but something in him hesitates. It’s not guilt that makes him rise up from his table outside of the quaint little coffee shop, nor is it pity. Tony can’t
He doesn't want to be alone. And seeing Steve standing there like he has no place in Tony's room, in Tony's life, makes him want to remediate his mistakes. He wants Steve to stay for as long as he wants to.
“Hey, stranger,” Tony says softly when they break apart for air. “I feel like I haven’t seen you in forever. Thought you went ghost on me.”
"Then why—" Steve begins, only to be cut off by Tony's lips. Tony closes his eyes and answers Steve the only way he knows how.
“Do we need to take a breather?” he asks cautiously. “It’s okay to say yes.”
Steeling himself, hands clenched into fist at his sides, Steve took that first step and prayed for strength.
“That’s right,” Steve hissed. “Only I get to see you like this. Not Rumiko, not Pepper, and certainly not Tiberius
“Erin,” the girl supplied with a toothy smile.
“Are you two going to sit down, or should I reschedule this meeting?” Fury says.
“You don’t get to drop in unannounced and say you’re just checking in. You lost that right, Rogers,” Tony spits. “You lost it when you decided that your will was more important than that of 117 fucking countries.”
“Thank you,” Steve said absentmindedly. “Care to explain
, that was new. They stood nearly shoulder to shoulder, their fingers just nearly brushing each other.
“Wasn’t planning on it,” he finds himself saying.
Ah. Snow. Ice. As in the thing Steve had spent the last seventy years of his life in. Tony doesn’t blame him for being on edge. There’s a rickety bed shoved into a corner with some moth bitten blankets that probably won’t crumple under their combined weight.
“I don’t know, Stark, did we?”
them and what lay beyond them. He had always been good at seeing the forest behind the trees. He had a feeling that they had barely scraped the surface with the Chitauri. There was something or
“Must you criticize me?” Tony asks, heading over to his computer. He has a lot of reading to do.
Steve’s eyes darken, and Tony practically drags him out of the gym, their hands still clutched together.
“Forty-six.”
One of the genius’ hands wound its way into his sleep tousled hair, massaging his scalp in a way that had Steve’s toes curling in pleasure. They moved together in unison, Tony’s mouth confident and insistent against his. Steve sucked at Tony’s bottom lip and slipped his tongue into Tony’s mouth. As Tony moaned, Steve began to fall away. All of the pain and the hardship of the past decade slipped away until it was just him and Tony, basking in the warmth and stillness of the morning.
“Consider me a guide, Steven.” Steve took in the awful, yet familiar gaunt crimson skull of Johann Schmidt shrouded in tattered robes and felt a hysterical laugh building inside of him. Of all the people he had met, loved, and hated, Red
found them, you take care of them.”
“My bad,” Steve says. “Any other time, I’m pretty good at uh, cleaning up.”
,” Tony says. “I spent all evening working on this meal and I’ll be damned if it goes to waste, Rogers.”
“Look at you, bargaining,” he said with an tired chuckle, more a huff of air, really. “Tony would be proud.”
. The way Steve's looking at him like he wants to eat him whole makes him pause. If he's not careful, they'll spend another hour getting lost in each other, he's sure of it.
“I think you can’t handle me, Rogers. Maybe I need to find someone else who can—Ah!”
“…Yes.”
He could think of a few things.
Tony had bristled, sadness quickly giving way to anger and if he was being honest with himself, embarrassment. “I just turned fifteen,” he had said through gritted teeth.
. Still bloodied and filthy from the battle, yet alive in a way the shade on Vormir hadn’t even come close to.
“At least I’ll die knowing I made King Joseph Rogers as red as his tunic,” Bucky said, mirth dancing in his eyes, a brilliant grin enveloping his face.
sleep deprived anymore so why are you still here? And being nice? Did you break something? Need something? Upgrades? Money?”
“No catch,” Tony replied, raising his hands. “Just wanted to let you know it was on the table. Figured it would be good for PR, too.”
Steve’s thick fingers prod at his entrance. His fingers burn, but the pain gives way to pleasure after a moment and soon Tony has a hand clapped over his mouth to stifle the cries that flee from his traitorous lips; Tony hates the little gasps and moans that escape his lips as the other man teases his prostate.
“Come on, genius,” Steve says. “Work with me.”
Really, how was he supposed to no to that face?
"But father—"
"Nothing," Steve says. "I just wanted you to have this." Steve hands the bear over to Tony, and Tony...Tony
It's like he, Steve, and Thor have a telepathic link with how well they fight together, making quick work of the HYDRA agents and their alien weapons. "
But did he love Tony? Did he love Tony like Tony loves him? Before his anxiety could get the best of him, he pushed the thought from his mind. Regardless of how Steve truly felt, Tony would still care for him. There was no going back. Hell, Tony didn't
, he has a soft spot for orphans. He still can’t help but feel like Pepper has some ulterior motive.
“Okay,” he says. His voice already sounds wrecked. Desperate. Then Steve’s on him.
Tony furrows his brows. A carnival does sound fun, and he has no problems with running a booth. It’s the others that are a problem.
“I’m fifteen!”
“No.”
Tony had said as much to the man when he felt it, something gliding up his leg. Tony chokes on his words, and much to his chagrin, five pairs of eyes zone in on him.
, but the smile on her face starts to waver at their hesitation.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says. He captures Tony’s other hand and brings it to his lips. Tony would be lying if he said he wasn’t close to swooning. “I know we haven’t seen each other in a while—“
in need of volunteers and funding after Thanos’ 2018 invasion. There’d be issues with homelessness, possible food shortages and God, Steve didn’t even want to

For the next three hours, Tony shoves Carmen's words from his mind and throws himself into teaching anyone who steps up to the basketball booth about physics. It wasn't
“Hmm,” AJ had said. “I’m seeing a lot of soldiers on that left side. Is that what you think people see you as? A soldier?
Pepper nods, looking a little less concerned, which is all Tony can ask for. "And the others? They're not bothering you?"
“I want to touch you,” he declares. “Let me?” He looks at Steve and hopes his eyes look wide and sweet. He remembers how Steve had snapped the last time he had looked at him like that, the bruising kisses and the hard, almost punishing way Steve had gotten him off…
Tony took a running start at the same time as the face plate, then on a whim, did a frontward flip, jet boots and all. For a brief moment, Tony was weightless, his hands seizing the face plate easily. The face plate snapped onto the rest of his helmet as Tony landed deftly in a crouch, his HUD flaring to life. “I’m the best.”
The other man’s eyes light up at the bag of bright orange sweet potatoes mocking Tony on the counter.
“We won, Steve,” she said. Natasha placed a hand on his shoulder and it felt so
Steve rose from the office chair, his own tac suit zipped and pristine once more. “And if I said I wanted more?” Steve asked.
Steve’s heart sunk in his chest. “Bruce. Don’t do this to yourself. This isn’t your fault. It’s no one’s fault. Pepper and Tony have a good thing going on. I guess we just got comfortable up here.”
, out of retirement only to have him killed in the end?
"Going quantum. Three...two...one."
The thundering sound of footsteps on concrete answers Steve's question.
Today was not a normal day. (When was any day in his life normal?)
“The Time Stone has shown me many things in my life.”
I'm actually really hyped for Chapter 5 but I won't spoil anything. I've tentatively set a goal for Chapter 5 to be up by February 7 at the latest.
No one will recognise him now. No one will question the split lip still smeared with fresh blood or the cum stain on his pants.
‘The world will be better like this.’ Steve caresses his face and slowly moves the gag back in place, so gently that Tony hardly notices him doing it. ‘We’ve fought so many times before, but you’ll see. The more you see of this world, the more you’ll understand. This is for the best.’
He'd thought he would die back then, before Rhodey swept in to save him. He’s not going to die this time and there’s no Rhodey to rescue him. He keeps walking towards the tower, but maybe it would be better if he walked into traffic.
He holds the whiskey bottle close and careful, like it’s as fragile as he is. He’s trembling like his body can’t contain all these volatile emotions, shifting inside, quaking on the surface like the Earth does when tectonic plates are shifting.
He stops to breathe, to release the tension that's been growing tighter and heavier in his chest. He's bleeding more sluggishly now and the pain is distant and soft edged.
And maybe in that life he will like to watch the whole world burn.
Over the ringing in his ears he can hear the pain in Tony’s voice. It had been a vicious fight, and if Tony felt even half the pain that Steve feels right now, it’s too much. Lifting his head is a big effort, but Steve does, looks around the battlefield, the dust haze and the wreckage of the place that had been his home for five years. Then he looks at Tony, who had been his home for so m much longer. The colours of the Iron Man suit aren’t as bright as they used to be. He blinks to try and focus his sight, but the blurriness stays. The ringing in his ears doesn’t let up either.
‘Tell me what’s going on first.’
Time is just a concept. Whatever long days and nights lay before him, they will end. He believe this because he needs to believe this. He is a bogged down with the memories of a man that will soon disappear. There is a certain cruel self indulgence in how much relief that brings.
Steve had been hesitant in the early days of their relationship. He’d confessed to being scared to hurt Tony if he really let loose. But that had been months ago and the more they explored Tony’s masochistic side, the more Steve has come into his own.
He looks for battle wounds, burns and bleeding. He can handle that, a lifetime of war has taught him how to stay calm and steady when he’s panicking inside. But the truth is, he already knows it isn’t that.
‘I’m fine, Steve,’ Tony says, but he feels flat, steamrolled, like he’s made of something hollow and his body had been inflated with nothing but air. ‘Fine,’ he repeats, but a little less sure this time.
with a smile on his face. Tony thinks,
"Yeah. Doesn't feel much like victory though, does it?" Tony turns his head away. "Guess we've kissed goodbye to our super hero days."
"Steve." Pepper's voice is small, calm but unwavering. She smiles nothing but sadness and it makes Steve think the worst. Is Tony okay?
Steve sighs. ‘I am. I’m not a skrull or a shapeshifter or under mind control or whatever you’re thinking. Perhaps I’m a little different than how you knew me before, but I’m the same man, just truer, better. I remember my truth and I want to share it with you. I will share it with you, soon enough.’
“You smell like booze.” It’s an observation not a criticism but it stings all the same.
‘Why are you here, Tony?’
Steve’s smile fades instantly and Tony wishes they were as brave as they pretended to be. Steve rises quickly and walks to the door. ‘I’ll just see if it’s important. You need rest.’
‘Yeah,’ Tony says. ‘I’m sorry for what he did to you too.’
It’s two am. Tony is probably sleeping in the arms of a beautiful woman, but that makes him want it all the more. Steve is drawn to his charisma, needs his unique brand of hedonism tonight.
He’d been arrogant enough to think there was no reason to bring the suit to a charity dinner.
He wakes dizzy and breathless. His body feels heavy and his eyes itchy and sticky with sleep. Smell of disinfectant, feeling of an IV hooked up to his hand and restraints around his wrists.
He imagines another life when he has forgotten all this - nights where Steve calls him in to witness the suffering of traitors, to paint a smile on his face and take Steve’s hand willingly and act like this is a kindness, a joy to be shared, like an evening at the opera. To hear screams reverberating through the room with the faint unspoken threat that, ‘this could be you, if you step out of line.’
Steve wants to throw the phone across the room and walk away. Let Tony die like he was meant to. Tony chose this. Tony doesn’t give a fuck who he hurts and Steve shouldn’t either.
‘I’m going to fuck you,’ Steve says and it’s not a question, or a request. Like it doesn’t matter what Tony says because they both already know he’d never say no. And Tony doesn’t. ‘I’ve waited for this,’ Steve says, ‘watching you lying here for so long, I thought I’d missed my chance.’
Check out my
Tony used to be a playboy, meaning he didn’t have much experience in the cuddling department. None of his hookups stayed long enough for that. It’s not until he cuddles with Steve that he realizes what he’s been missing out on all these years.
Steve chuckled, blinking back the wetness in his eyes. “Yeah, I feel that way too.”
Natasha and him had joined up with the others who looked just as bad as he felt. When they had updated the others on the Loki situation, Thor’s face had taken on a thunderous expression (no pun intended) and he had been all but ready to tear up the rest of New York looking for him. Tony had been the one to calm him down.
Tony squeezes Steve's hands. “That means getting rest,” he says gently. “Spending time with your team. Two heads are better than one.”
“You…you wouldn’t,” Tony stuttered and closed his eyes, the images coming to his mind too much for him to handle. Just the mere thought of marching back down to the cafeteria, uniform unzipped, his mouth and chin covered with pre-come and drool was enough to make a wet spot on Tony’s underwear start to bloom where his cock was steadily leaking pre-come.
something to him.
"I think I like you like this," Steve says instead, pressing his fingers into the meat of Tony's thighs. A shiver runs down Tony's spine at the hungry look in Steve's eyes.
, and today Steve fought like a demon sent from hell for
True to his word, Steve cleans out every booth they touch,  until he's practically drowning in stuffed animals. They attract a crowd as they make their way to the food court. Tony's feet are aching, and his stomach is outright roaring for sustenance. He and Thor get the biggest plate of ribs they've got to offer. The meat's so tender it's falling off the bone and smoked to perfection. The sauce they used is homemade, all tang and smoky sweetness. He eats until his stomach is about ready to burst.
“Dodger won’t stop crying. I think he misses DUM-E,” Steve had said on one of the earlier voice-mails. “I guess playing fetch with me isn’t the same,” he had joked.
, Mr. Rogers,” Tony says and plants a kiss on Steve’s cheek. His skin burns where Tony’s lip touched him. He wants to feel that burn all over his body. “But this was supposed to be a surprise.”
Tony can't say he's paying attention during the debriefing. It's hard to when every time he closes his eyes, all he sees is pink exposed flesh. Thor had been looking for Loki's staff. They had let it stay in SHIELD's custody in 2012 and two years later were kicking themselves for it. He said that he tried to follow its magical signature, and it had led him to...that girl. Or what was left of her.
exactly he was trying to say but the Ancient One seemed to understand what he was getting at anyway.
,” Steve punctuated his words with a deep roll of his hips that left Tony gasping. Steve was hard
They’d had five years. Five years after Thanos’ first attack, to lick their wounds, to mend the tatters of their friendship, and during the past few weeks, with time travelling together and working together like they used to, Steve had thought that maybe they had a chance at being something else. He wasn’t about to lose Tony all over again.
“I don’t know. I lo—” Tony shakes his head, agony in his features. “I can’t say it right now. I'm sorry.”
Steve laughs. ‘Hydra dear, I am the Hydra Supreme and I have waited for our victory for a very long time.’
Tony's eyes scan him. The temptation to cover his emaciated body itchs like sandpaper on Steve's skin, but he lets Tony assess him.
'You're not even going to fight?'
“I had a thing.”
He slips them on and Bucky leads him to the room down the hall. The one that has Happy and Pepper standing outside the door whispering among themselves before they stop when they see Steve.
He can hear Steve, he can see him. He can feel his body aching. He feels nothing.
But Steve never has a chance to answer. A klaxon goes off, and the door swings open and a single Hydra soldier steps inside.
'Don't you know those things will kill you?' Tony says and lights his own cigarette.
'I'm going to come get you,' Steve says.
“I need to take a shower.”
Like catching fishes, it takes patience. Tony knows when to nudge things along and when to let it lie. Steve smiles at him more, laughs with him more.
‘Need you? Fuck your arrogance. I didn’t invite you. You’ve been trailing me around like a lost puppy. What do you even want from me? There’s nothing I can say to change what happened.’
He imagines women fall at Tony’s feet. Men too, maybe. He feels guilty for thinking it, for the picture it brings to his brain, sitting there stagnating something awful in the pit of his stomach.  He imagines Tony on his knees and starts to get hard. Closer to the bathroom wall, step by traitorous step to listen to the moans of man and woman, and remind him of how it should be.
'Steve?' Extremis tells him Steve is still connected, but he wants to hear him - to know it in his human heart and not just in his computer powered brain.
The ground is covered in old stains of booze and spunk and god knows what. Sweat and sex and marijuana smoke swamp the air in an almost tangible haze and sequined bras shine in the flashing half light.
'Why are you telling me this now, Tony, what the hell is going on?' Tony used to think he was good at reading Steve, but perhaps he never was, perhaps he saw what Steve was willing to show him, because he's getting nothing now.
‘You’ve been sleeping a long time.’ Steve averts his eyes for a moment. ‘You know, Tony, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking while you were out.’
The relief that Steve knows they both must feel is palpable in the air between them. Tony’s alive. He wasn’t too late this time, the thought making him almost dizzy with joy. Only he realizes a beat too late that he actually is dizzy, feeling his head lolling back to the side.
Tony hasn’t been to a strip club since Afghanistan. This place is sleazy even by his old standards, but it's warm inside and the smell of sex somewhere it’s supposed to be helps calm the raging hurricane his body has become.
They go for drinks and sit in silence. He wants to ask why, but doesn’t because it doesn’t take much to imagine. If he were more like Tony, selfish and impulsive and still living for himself. Steve understands too much and hates Tony a little for showing him that.
‘I do love you, Tony, I hope you can see that,’ Steve’s voice is soft and there’s a kindness in him still that Tony had thought gone completely. But it’s no surprise really, Tony excels at seeing the worst in his loved ones.
Steve grits his teeth. He doesn’t let himself think of all the times he had wanted to say something, of the ways he had imagined it, or the memory of how it happened in reality. ‘It wasn’t a lie,’ he says and that's all he can manage.
we're never the ones he was supposed to be saying.
Steve comes down his throat. Holding Tony’s head so he can’t move or breathe until Steve is done.
Steve hushes him again and Tony fights the touch of painful frustration tensing him up. His fingers clench and he wants to argue, but his words are gone. His eyes focus one last time on Steve, and he sees the syringe in his hand. Something pumped into his IV. He wants to resent it, but he’s tired and Steve is only doing what he thinks is best.
They both come quick. Years of holding back, years of wanting and not having and now Tony has Steve here with him, something more than a friend. Something… something. He doesn’t quite dare put a name to it yet, because it’s just sex, sex and a kiss and Tony knows well enough that that doesn’t have to mean anything more.
His brain is killing him. If he wasn’t so sober, he would laugh. He might be about to puke on his custom leather loafers. Steve’s footsteps are coming close. There is stale whiskey on Tony pant leg and a lose thread where cigarette ash landed in his lap. Specks of a strangers come on his blazer. No one expected any better from him, once.
Giddy on the energy, the attention of the bright eyed young blond who grinds against him on the dancefloor. Sloppy kisses and roving hands; no shame here. Hotel room paid on his credit card, they drain the mini bar dry and this time he gets to fuck someone into the mattress. Run fingers through his hair. Kiss. Pretend. Feel better.
Maybe Tony shouldn't be alive now. Like a father who's watched his child die, it feels unnatural. In a way, that's all the armour was, a newborn with too much data thrown at it, needing a father's guidance and love. Tony could have helped. Tony could have fixed it. But Tony is as much a failure as his father was.
Steve shakes him and Tony’s eyes flutter open. ‘Too much coke,’ he slurs when he says it, but there’s a smile in his voice like he thinks this is funny.  His eyes drift closed again.
Tony will oblige, because everything is playing in his head like a symphony of regret, reminding him that he deserves Steve's anger.
Steve nods. "Yes Ma'am. Thank you."
‘I know. What happened happened. I don’t expect you to change it. I want my friend back. I don’t want to let that hydra asshole take more from me than he’s taken already.’
Steve holds the door only slightly ajar, so Tony can’t see who’s on the other side. They talk in hushed but sharp voices and Steve slams the door with a frustration that echoes through his whole body in a wave of tension.
‘I have a lot of important things to do, Tony. I can’t spend all my time with you.’
He knows it’s weird. He knows Steve will pick up on it.
He watches the crack of light beneath the door, feels when Steve falls asleep beside him. He considers getting up, seeing the world that Steve is scared to show him. He would have once, perhaps, but Steve is gently snoring beside him and Tony is tired of facing the world alone. He rolls over to watch Steve, feel his heartbeat, his breathing, his body heat and indulge in the intimacy of it.
'Space,' Tony says and realises he has no intention of elaborating, because as much as he likes the fantasy of Steve here with him, comforting him, easing him into his last sorry moments, it's a fantasy.
Steve lets a tear slip down his cheek as he continues, he could say the words and it doesn't mean that Tony will hear. He wants to tell him this all again when he wakes up. "I love you Tony."
‘Shhh. Everything will be fine soon.’ Steve’s voice sounds echoic, like they’re in a cave or a cell and Steve is watching from above. Footsteps approach.
It's a slow song. Soothing every anxiety Tony has ever had. Smothering him with the unique rhythm of Steve.
There is blood in the grass, slicking the soil to mud. It’s a good fertiliser, he thinks, maybe that's why the grass on this planet is so vivid and alive. He recalls what the Lord had said about returning to nature, like it was a mercy. Perhaps they are right, perhaps there is some mercy in this, lying amidst the grass as soft as cotton and listening to the song of unearthly birds. It's a peaceful way to die.
Tony could play that meta game too, but using their history like that makes Tony want to roll over and die.
As Tony rests, Steve scans himself, like he learned to after Project Rebirth made every injury feel inconsequential. His muscles hurt, dull throbbing aches scattered across his body, from his temples to his feet.
Tony tugs at the distant mist of near forgotten dreams lingering in his brain. Goosesteps, salute, a twisted mirror of Steve’s smile, a familiar uniform in new colours. Hail Hydra. It’s fading fast already, with Steve smiling in civvies by his bedside.
Steve pulls back from the kiss and smiles a butcher’s smile. There’s blood in his teeth, and Tony wonders why he didn’t taste of it. He feels the wetness dripping down his own lip.
‘It doesn’t matter now, Tony. You’re back with me, that’s what matters.’
Steve follows him.
‘The why?’ Steve laughs. He’s cracking with a familiar fury that energises him. He jumps from the bike and hardly notices as it hits the asphalt. ‘You want me to tell you
Steve tries his best to sit up. Bucky takes the cup of water from him and sits it back on the table. There's something in Bucky's eyes that Steve can't read that makes Steve uneasy. He needs to speak with Tony, no he needs to see him and make sure that everything is okay.
is doing here. He yearns for the days when sex was so simple, and hates himself for wishing he could have that selfish oblivion again.
It would be so easy to drink the rest of the whisky and pass out right here. Maybe never wake up, maybe embrace the life of the drunk street begger. He’s never been invisible before.
‘Well maybe it’s too late for that. Maybe I can’t be your friend anymore. Maybe I can’t look at you without wanting to be sick.’
The man does so, he kneels in front of Steve and clasps his hands like he is praying. Tony can see the fire in Steve’s eyes and the fear from the Hydra soldier, it passes over him like mist, he sees and hears but does not absorb. It’s like nonsense speak, an abstract painting he can’t figure out.
The bedroom is quiet. The thoughts of sex shut away with the bathroom door. He sees the bloody uniform and bedsheets strewn across the floor and wonders if this is better.
‘I’m going to make you mine. For tonight, in body only, but soon, in body and mind for the rest of our lives.’
Tony wants to get fucked.
If he's truthful, he wants to die a hero's death. This is not that. But he was never brave enough for Steve's option either.
He feels like he’s sleepwalking through life sometimes and wonders what it would take to wake him up. He does his best to adapt and change but it’s a people’s world and he is an alien in it. A machine. A soldier. He does what he has to because it’s the only life he knows now.
He’s been lying in the silent darkness for hours. Blackout blinds are heavy across the only window in the room. It’s a good place for rest and yet he feels off balance, itchy and light, like if he wasn’t restrained he’d float away. He belongs somewhere else, he thinks, but doesn’t know where the thought comes from or where he is supposed to be. He wonders if the Steve from before was a dream.
Pain, pain, pain and then nothing, nothing, nothing.
The dust doesn’t settle. It lingers in the air, catching the light of the setting sun, swirls in the wind over the battlefield, what once had been the Avengers Compound, and Steve tries not to think about how some of that dust had previously been an invading alien race.
Steve looks shaken for a moment, then he steps closer, within arms reach. He leans close. ‘You’re right, Tony. I don’t want us to ever fight on different sides again. You don’t either, do you? ‘
Steve hums.
But Steve has a saviour complex. It's not concern for Tony because he is Tony, it's concern for a life, a person in pain who Steve feels responsible for. Tony has been unmoored from Steve's life, drifted to the distance of stranger and civilian.
He treats Tony like he’s important. Tony is used to being someone. Flash of paparazzi bulbs, headline news, latest scandal, latest success. Someone has always been watching, looking for something from him. Never personal, just doing their job, just public interest, just, just, just. He tired of it. But this… it’s all personal. He hates it, but he’ll never tire of it.
'What the hell are you doing, Tony?'
Steve agrees, but doesn't say so. Bitterness will do them no good now. They chose this. They won.
‘Are you, though?’ He wishes he could believe in this, but nothing adds up. He hasn’t seen a single doctor since he woke up.
She pulls away from his cock, wiping away a string of spit and shooting him a seething glare. “Darling, I’m trying my best. You need some blue pills not a better blowjob.”
"Guess we're still alive, huh, Cap?"
From what he remembers, Tony looked pretty bad but at least seemed to be faring better than Steve. It seems Steve- being the more advanced individual - braced most of the strain from using the gauntlet. That was good. He would take anything that allowed for Tony to finally bear less of the burden. Together, he reminded himself.
‘Commander, sir,’ the soldier speaks past Tony’s shoulder, and Tony almost loses his grip as he turns to see who else is there, ‘can you get this fool off of me? You’re needed urgently in conference room B.’
He wonders what he’s doing here, what
Dreamy, dazed, he stands over the body and watches the man’s skull draining out across the cream carpet. The strain won’t come out and the whole carpet will need to be replaced. Whoever picked cream must’ve been an idiot.
Tony knows lust. Captain America in the flesh, half drowned and crazy and fighting his way through the facility and Tony’s first thought is:
Since Steve met him, Tony has buzzed with a constant movement like some kind of perpetual motion machine. Except for the briefest twitch of fingers and the steady rise and fall of his breath, Tony hasn't moved since he woke up.
Tony’s gag reflex is long gone with Steve.
‘Well,’ says Tony, with a bitter smile, and there’s an audible quiver in his voice, ‘I’ll see you around, I guess. Goodbye, Cap.’ And Tony turns away, heading back to the motel, leaving Steve alone with his motorcycle.
“Steve, Steve, are you alright?”
“Stark passed out the same time you did. He’s in the next room over.”
It's like his body is an overused eraser, once clean and whole, now worn down to uselessness, the dust blown away to fix a mistake.
Steve slings Tony’s arm across his shoulder, carries him out on jelly legs before Tony can protest further. If he’s honest with himself, Tony wants to walk away from the violence too, it’s not an image he wants in his head when he thinks of Steve.
Is it only that determination to see something through, no matter the cost, or how long it takes? It would be a lot like Steve on the surface.
'I've had just about all the fighting I can take, Steve. I don't have anything left to give.'
Steve swallows around the lump that forms in his throat at the sudden realisation. He chooses to ignore the ringing in his ears and finds it in him to instead look up at Tony and give him reassurance. He can deal with his shit later, Tony comes first.
They fuck before bed. Sleep together but not
He starts to walk, matching the erratic rhythm of his heart
Tony stubs his cigarette out, tugs Steve's from his lips and answers with another kiss.
Steve marks this gloating with a kiss. Everything Tony has always wanted his life to be; illusion shattered, mirror cracked. Steve who is not Steve. How many times has he seen people replaced or controlled before and yet he believed. Believed that he was important, believed that he was invincible, believed that he was loved.
He lays back and lets Steve do what he wants, what he needs, and he thinks of his own needs and wants and they feel no different. What Steve needs, Tony needs. What Steve wants, Tony wants.
. For now though, he drinks, parties, and fucks a couple blond supermodels to keep the hunger at bay.
"Everyone's back. We won," Steve says, clinging to it because he has to.
He thinks of those early days, how quickly Steve adapted and made the modern world his own. It can’t have been so long, Tony’s looks at his hands but his skin is still young. He thinks of the past few years and the breakneck speed their lives now run at. It could have been a week and he might’ve missed just as much.
Tony goes flat, his face suddenly lifeless, like his insides have been tipped out and he’s been left hollow inside. ‘Oh,’ he says, monotone. ‘Okay.’
Tony's hand twitches in Steve's. He glances quickly and notices Tony's face contouring and trying to form words.
Tony only grunts.
The gurgling black cauldron of stupid that pulls the strings in the recesses of his mind still needs to say his dying words of choice. They stutter and die before the rest of him does.
It’s only now there is no
Tony is calm, unmoved and his placidity stirs the hazy memories Steve wants to shut away forever.
'Not that.' Steve reaches for another cigarette, doesn't light it but enjoys the comfort of it hanging from his lips. 'That kiss. Did you mean it?'
“Let’s get that room,” he tells the woman when the whisky has him far enough from sober that his body feels in his control again.
Steve rolls over, wedged up next to him on the cramped bed. Tony feels a little claustrophobic, even with the cuffs off. This is the start of something and Tony isn’t sure what. He’s been orbiting around the edges of Steve’s affection for years and this time he can’t resist the pull. He wants to run away and he wants to never leave Steve’s side again.
He is crying. Eyes clenched shut but the tears break free anyway, like they did the last time he spoke so honestly to Steve. To Steve's body.
There's no mercy in dying, no freedom from his demons that make his last moments feel worth it. He is a drunk and even now, he wants a drink.
“New York?” Rhodey asks him over Skype, curiosity twisting his features.
“Chocolate chip cookies,” are the first words to leave Tony’s mouth. Jarvis chuckles, shaking his head. The boy’s sweet tooth is notorious in the Stark household, of course the first food that came to his mind would have been a sweet.
“What?” Happy asked. “You know, look, I have a real job, Tony. I’m working, I got something going on here.”
Pleasure gripped him once more and Tony brought Steve with him, growling and cursing.
“This timeline…you saw this happen?”
“Just machines, Tony.”
Steve sighs. "It'd be easier to list what isn't bugging me."
“Yeah. It is.”
“What happened to 'Steve'?”
“Good. Just means I get to stretch you out some more. Leave you
“Oh, God,” Tony moaned, dropping his head against Steve’s desk.
to relax, you know?”
“Tony,” Steve speaks his name so softly it feels like a caress. Tony wants to step back. He wants to put on the suit and fly to Malibu, to Amalfi, to anywhere but
"Sorry," Steve blushes. "You first."
There’s a small but up to date kitchenette off to their right done up in polished mahogany, tan stone, and black appliances for whenever hunger strikes. Tony heads to the left with Steve following behind him. His living area also functions as a bedroom of sorts. Tony had invested in a plush brown leather sofa from a high-end Italian furniture manufacturer. Sinfully soft and draped in luxurious throw blankets, it served as both a sofa and his bed when he couldn’t be bothered to take the elevator to his penthouse suite.
“Oh God,” Tony groaned. “You named him. You’ve gone and named him and now you’re attached.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve rings the bell easily and wins, of all things, a Captain Ameribear for his trouble.
“SHIELD’s accommodations aren’t up to your standards? I thought you hated the Tower.”
But maybe Steve had been desperate? Desperation drove men to crazy lengths, including sleeping with your...enemies? That wasn’t right. It held too many negative connotations, and despite their rough start, Tony didn’t think he would ever fight
Tony picks up Steve's phone. He doesn't ask why Steve was waiting for him, and Steve doesn't ask why he was in his workshop at two in the morning.
"She an old flame of yours?" Clint says, and Tony tries to ignore how quickly Steve's head turns to look at him.
That. Fucking. Bastard.
“I could use some air,” he says.
“No need to thank me, Cap,” Tony said. “I’m not really a bike man, but getting to work on a beaut like this? An absolute treasure. I’m gonna need you to shift her into neutral.”
Lowering his head, Tony pressed his lips to Steve’s covered thigh. A sharp intake of breath—Steve had liked that. Tony repeated the action, pressing another kiss slightly higher on his thigh while his other hand slowly stroked up and down the right. A part of him wanted to skip past all of the teasing and shove Steve’s cock down his throat until he was gagging on it but he knew the buildup only made Steve more desperate. And a desperate Steve could fuck him like nobody else. With the kevlar catching on his roving lips, Tony’s nimble fingers toyed with the hidden zipper at the apex of Steve’s thighs.
," he thinks.
“Fuck, I missed you,” Steve groaned, breaking the kiss. Tony savored the look of Steve, his golden hair mussed, lips pink and eyes wild for the next time Steve went away. Sometimes having an eidetic memory was a blessing.
He hates his bad days, how too touch and go they are. How some days, he'll be fine, almost
, wanting to come tumbling forth from his lips.
He wouldn't show his frustration, even as his hands trembled. Bucky approached him and slung an arm around Steve's shoulders.
"Is something the matter, my prince?" Tony asked with an innocent look that Steve didn't believe for one second.
Tony keeps his eyes on the saucepan, and if Steve sees his lips quirk up, he keeps it to himself.
"Everything's as good as I can hope for, Pep. I'm going to therapy, and I'm still taking my meds. You know how it is," he says, shrugging. "Some days are better than others."
He remembered reading them and being amused, what kid wouldn’t be? But Bucky had been the one who had really been into them and all things science fiction. Now
"Carmen, cool it before you pop a blood vessel," he says, mentally filing away the idea to add a pole leading directly to the tower's hangar. "And I promise you can grill them when you see them at the carnival."
“They would’ve limited our freedoms, Tony,” Steve tries again, and Tony is floored at the man’s tenacity. He shouldn’t be shocked. Tony’s sure that when the serum was applied, it amplified everything about Steve, including his stubbornness.
"Tough luck," Bucky said, leading him over to where Rumlow and Dugan stood conversing.
Steve snickered. “Your joints sound like someone’s breaking ice.”
years.”
Tony swallows. “Okay. Sure. That works, too.” He looks down pointedly at Steve’s hand.
"Right," he says. "Right." He came for SHIELD secrets; cover stories, mission files, safe houses, that sort of thing. It takes JARVIS no time at all to hack into HYDRA's system.
. Everything was

He won’t lie; he’s missed having a PA.  Nobody could replace Pepper, but Hill came damn close. Even if she was a glorified babysitter for the team.
“I’m better with you,” Steve corrects him. “How about that?”
“What’s next for you, big guy?” Tony said.
That defuses the tension in the room, just a bit. Bruce lets out a light chuckle while Natasha just rolls her eyes.
was his present.
leave mental scars,” Steve said, bringing about a few more chuckles.
Steve placed his cup back down on its little saucer. “I…the migraine…you knew—” he wasn’t sure
"Oh yes," Steve agreed. "I just need to grovel on my knees."
Tony’s kisses had stolen his breath along with his sense, it seemed. His breath echoed in Steve’s ears, and a savage satisfaction filled him at the sound. Tony was breathless because of him.
She completed the movement with a one-two combination, one of her palms against his chest, the other against his forehead.
. Steve found his shoulder being used as a pillow as soft snores escaped Tony’s mouth. He had savored the moment, allowing himself to truly be close to Tony in a way he hadn’t in a long,
Steve groans when Tony slides his hands into Steve’s hair, thrusting his hips shallowly into his mouth. He pulls off of Tony's cock, and Tony whines at the loss of his mouth.

God, why did he even ask? He should have just told Pepper that the others were all unavailable or—
“He invited the rest of us. His treat,” she said. “He said and I quote, ‘make sure the Capsicle knows that includes him, too.’”
Steve gives him a crooked smile. Tony’s not...disappointed, per se, but he wouldn’t have minded it if Steve had lost control again.
“Hundreds of victims, all dead to sate their greed,” Thor grits out.
Tony's in denial but Steve's no quitter.
“Destroying my gym?”
Rhodey had nodded putting both hands in the air in surrender. “Alright, you’re not a baby. But for real, man, what are you doing here? Where are your parents?”
come to Tony’s eyes as the ecstasy of release whites out his vision.
“How long did this take you?”
Call him biased, but he loved the stealth suit on Steve. He loved the way it hugged his lithe form, the way the navy hue complimented Steve’s ridiculously blue eyes. The fact that Tony made it soothed the part of his brain that ran through countless scenarios of Steve getting hurt. It’s like whenever Steve wore it, he was carrying a piece of Tony with him.
It happens on a mission gone wrong. The quinjet is out of fuel, their comms and his suit are down, and worst of all, it looks like a blizzard is rolling in. It’s not the worst day of Tony’s life, but it sure as hell could be better.
Steve forges on. “I lost everything. Everyone. All because I wasn’t quick enough. I didn’t fight hard enough.”
,” Tony thinks with some wonder. “
Somehow, Steve found the nerve to speak to her without breaking down crying. He wasn’t sure if this was Hell or Heaven or something
“That’s why we’re here,” Tony says insistently. “To put a stop to it. I was looking into Zola’s experiments—“
Elena looked younger than 24 with her round face and big blue eyes. She was smiling in the picture, showing off a tiny gap between her two front teeth.
“See, we’re almost done. Seven. Keep on breathing for me. That’s my man,” Tony said. He reached up to smooth back some of Steve’s hair from his forehead. Steve leaned into the touch, savoring the press of skin against skin, using it as an anchor to the present.
recall from past excursions there being a creek not too far from the meadow.
“Breathe through your nose, exhale through your mouth,” JARVIS instructed.
The owner of the lips took their time kissing their way to his mouth, each peck a test in of itself against Steve’s will. He wanted to flip them over and pin their arms above their head and give them kisses of his own until they were both drowsy with it.
Natasha and Clint had bullied Tony into letting them host movie night in Tony’s penthouse, and they had held them there ever since. The downside to that was there was only so much seating available. At first, there had only been a sofa, more for aesthetics than comfort, but with the advent of their movie nights, Tony had swapped the sofa out for something a little softer and an armchair and loveseat to match. Enough to fit six people, not nine.
Rumlow’s slow perusal of Tony’s body had Steve clenching his fists. He would not intervene. He would not intervene. He would not—
It's hard not to when kids start lining up single file for their turn to receive a stuffed animal from Steve.
“He’s hyperventilating!” Tony shouted, running towards him and crouching down. That was weird? When had Steve gotten on the ground?
"Yeah," Steve says. "I was. I...thought about you. I fought for you."
"Nope, too late," Clint says, shrugging his shirt on over the long sleeve he had been wearing. "I've already grown attached.”
"Is this another one of your strange Midgardian customs?" Thor says, holding the t-shirt out in front of him. They're done up in his signature hotshot red, of course with Carmen's charity,
Steve also looks disappointed, his shoulders dropping. “Whatever it is, it must be important. Raincheck?”
“Pester? Annoy—”
And there it was. The truth was out, not that Tony tried to keep it a secret much anyway. Sooner or later everyone was going to find out the great Howard Stark’s son was attending
At the final number, Tony let out a sigh of relief. They had managed to get his breathing under control and now Steve was just tired and hungry and wouldn’t be opposed to eating the entire pot of chicken tikka masala by himself before passing out right then and there on the kitchen floor.
Tony wipes his face, grabs a sweet potato of his own, and gets to work.
Thor lands in the snowbank, sending the snow into a flurry. He stalks towards Tony, his red cape fluttering in the wind. Lightning dances at his fingertips, and paired with the fury painting his face red, Tony would think it was directed at him.
In hindsight, it was probably the “please” that got Steve off. The thought of the great, defiant Tony Stark on his knees begging for cock like his life depended on it.
Steve sighs. ‘I think we should go back to your room.’
Bucky reaches over and passes him a cup of water. As soon as his throat clears, he asks about Tony.
“Been thinking about me all night, huh?” Steve teases.
Steve laughs. “I’ll take that as a yes.”
Tony tunes out the words, puts one foot in front of the other and tried not to dwell on the image of a man begging on his knees for his life.
He can almost hear Howard's voice in the slosh of cheap whisky.
Tony opens his eyes and is greeted by Steve’s radiant smile.
‘Then you’d better pray he turns out brighter than you.’ Steve pulls out a pistol and shoots the guy between the eyes. Blood flies as he falls and splashes of it land on Tony’s face and gown, painting him with a violence unlike any he’s seen from Steve before.
are different now.
'Tony?' Steve says. 'Why are you calling me?'
‘Does it matter?’
‘What the fuck just happened? Why did you do that? Why are there Hydra soldiers here? Who was he talking to?’ It feels like his brain is in hyper drive, thoughts spiralling too quickly around him to grab a hold of. He’s losing his breath. He’s losing his mind.
He imagines Tony sitting on the other side, drinking alone, deliberately ignoring him. It burns a little, and he thinks maybe he should go. Pictures himself back in his apartment, sitting on blood stiff sheets and listening to his neighbours fuck.
Tony leans closer, breathes against Steve’s ear and strokes a hand up his thigh.
Tony is awake again and staring. Steve wonders how long Tony has been watching.
Everything in Steve’s body aches. Pain from the battle but multiplied tenfold.
That’s how it has started. Just a stupid
Tony thinks if he were a braver man, Steve’s assumption would be right.
Yet again, Tony must face the situation he has orchestrated.
He's tired now. Everything aches but none of it hurts as much as Steve's silence does.
Tony was a man of means once. His father's means. Carrying the name, the success, the fortune, to the gutter.
He chokes back the foul taste that lingers on his tongue. One whiskey wasn’t quite enough to wash it away.
Tony likes to imagine it will go like this, time and time again, that he will never be persuaded and maybe eventually this shadow of Steve will see that and kill him. But then, he thinks of what Steve could do unchecked. He thinks of the itching needle of manipulation, the way Steve dipped his toes into the waters of Tony’s mind before throwing himself in. The way Tony was falling so fast under his spell before the hydra goon made his mistake.
Tony does as he’s told. Steve turns the lights up and dims the windows. There’s nothing outside but a barren wasteland, a canyon in the middle of the desert.
‘Tony? Are you awake?’ He hears the low familiar voice before his eyes adjust.
'I guess the truth is, I've always tried to do what I thought was right, but when you died I realised how fucking stupid I'd been. I realised none of it was worth losing you for. And now I'm stuck out here and this fucking planet is killing me and I just need to tell you - I love you, Steve. I fucking love you.'
Pepper steps aside and lets Steve enter the room. His heart stops when he sees Tony pale against the sheets but it's unmistakable that he's breathing. The machine buzzes and beeps.
Tony's chest rises and falls and he's safe. Safe. Steve collapses in the chair next to his bed.
Steve is as silent as he was that day on the hellicarrier. Tony babbles on to fill the void of fear that Steve's silence carries. 'I missed you so fucking much, Steve. I didn't feel alive when you weren't. I was living on autopilot, people blamed me, hated me, but never as much as I blamed or hated myself. When I sat down next to your body, saw you so lifeless and empty, I realised I love you. I guess I've always loved you.' He'd tuned it out, found other people to love, to fuck, to fill the emptiness in him that always wanted more from people. More from Steve.
, and that barbecue is starting to smell better and better.
Tony stumbles out of bed and sinks to his knees. His bedroom is spinning, or maybe
He was in Brooklyn, oddly enough, and the brownstone turned art studio

Stone,” Steve spat the name out like a curse.
With each word, Steve’s head throbbed. He felt as if he had been trampled underfoot by his horse. He was just about to dismiss Peter when something the boy said caught his attention.
Steve shares a look with Natasha, and Tony gets the sneaking suspicion that they planned this. Who knew that the fall of SHIELD would lead to one of the most dangerous alliances Tony had ever seen?
Tony could sleep when he was dead, but lying to Rhodey wouldn’t help at all. When you were friends for as long as them, you had a hard time getting things past the other.
. “Fine. I guess I have no choice, do I?”
Even if he had been given a choice, he wasn’t sure he’d even

now? What happened to Rogers? Capsicle? Any other one of your incessant nicknames?"
“Oh, yeah, yeah,” Tony said and place the bottle of Pinot Noir back in it’s slot. Maybe a white wine would be better?
However, Tony didn’t account for the sudden friendship between Steve and Natasha, the traitor. (He doesn’t know when she stopped being just Romanov in his head.)
." Tony was much more a fan of beating his intrusive thoughts back with a stick.
“Good thing it was a one-off,” Tony says, hoping his voice comes off light and airy. “Otherwise, I’d be pissed.”
"Lots of people!"
“Alright, I don’t work for you. Now, I don’t trust this guy. He’s got another guy with him, he’s shifty,” Happy said, his voice cutting into Tony’s perusal of Killian.
Steve snorted, reaching for his goblet once more. “Ha! Unlikely,” he said.
“The next poor sucker to be your roommate,” Rhodey says and gets a pillow to the face by courtesy of Tony.
And so Steve had ended up going home to the tower with a box full of puppies and a significantly lighter wallet.

Steve looks at him from underneath his lashes. "Tony," he begins, "it's a gift. I
Ana passes on a beautiful summer day when Tony is fifteen, Jarvis following her soon after. Tony hangs up his apron and doesn’t pick it up again. Not for a while.
Tony jumps back in. “Not to mention that Bucky was the Winter Soldier for over 60 years. If HYDRA is determined to have an army of enhanced individuals, why not use what’s already at their disposal? Why not draw Bucky’s blood and reverse engineer the serum to make more Winter Soldiers?”
Everyone sensed the change in Steve, everyone except Rumlow, who plowed on uninterrupted, eager to finally get a word in.
“You’re deflecting. Trying to push me away.” Steve stepped forward until he was about a foot away from Tony. “I’m not going anywhere until you tell me what’s wrong.”
“Focus up, ladies. Good evening and welcome to the birthing suite,” he said, spreading his arms wide. “I’m pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, badass, baby brother.”
DUM-E, bless his little robot soul, tried to help by distracting Pepper with dinner but that only served to exacerbate things.
Tony had wanted peace and had only gotten it when the light had faded from his eyes completely.

“Unfortunately.”

When he told her about Bucky the tears had finally fallen until they were both openly crying, clinging to one another like they were all each other had. He wanted to tell her everything. He wanted to tell her about Tony and Natasha and the rest of the Avengers and he guessed that included all of the new members they had collected along the way. Steve had
"You've met one prince, you've met them all," Tony said like he was stating a fact of life. "Until I met you."

“Sorry,” Tony heard himself saying. “I gotta split.”
"They came because
Steve slides the door shut and walks up to him until he's flush with Tony's back.
“A distraction,” she said softly.

to feel good either. Space and time tossed his body about like a leaf blowing carelessly through the wind. Dying stars and distant planets soared past him in bursts of color and sound. He was dying or being reborn or both, life and death tossing a coin in the air to choose. Steve activated the time bracelet and braced himself for impact. He landed deftly, the impact of his feet against the stone shocking his toes and jolting through his legs. He had made it to Vormir.
“Later,” Steve had said, eyes pleading. “The sooner I finish this paperwork, the sooner I’ll be able to devote all of my time and attention to you.”
Steve pushes on. “You have such a big heart, Tony. The world needs you.
Tony ignores Natasha's pointed look and hopes that his face isn't as red as he thinks it is.
“Is this Forehead of Security?” Tony asked, wandering down to his cellar as he spoke.

"Tony," Steve begins, sounding like he's about to propose, he's so serious. "Want to ride with me?"

Was that what this was about? Steve was
Tony wasn’t…he wasn’t
The roaring of a car turning the corner and coming to a stop at the sidewalk with an audible screech shook Steve to his very core. Only one person could be behind that wheel.
“Already?” he wondered aloud. “I thought she’d be longer.”
Tony rubs his chin. “I don’t know,” he draws out. “Not sure if I can trust you with my notes. They’re top secret.”
"Breathe for me, baby," Steve says, and it hits Tony then. This is the first time they've had sex. All of their other moments had been fleeting, full of fevered grinding and hot mouths and rough hands when they had time to spare.
“She’s a beaut, Cap,” Tony replied. “Mind if I?” He did a hand-wavy gesture.
“Holy shit, Rogers,” he says, sounding breathless to his ears.

Steve hovers over him. For a moment, Tony thinks he's going to say those three terrifying words. Horror and excitement alike send his stomach rolling, but Steve just says, "Anything for you."
. He supposes that they’re friends now. He has his own personal entry code to Tony’s workshop, which he uses whenever he wants, it seems. Tony never turns him away, anyway.
And, like always, Natasha Romanoff was slapping some sense into him. He could make things right. He could make things

The night had started off well enough. Rhodey had been in town for an entire week and the entire mood in the tower had lifted because of it. Tony had immediately demanded that the other man cancel his reservation at his hotel and to stay with them in the tower until he had to leave. Rhodey had protested but Tony had given him his patented Tony Stark Pout™ and Rhodey was a goner. They had spent the entire week goofing around the tower like little kids. Rhodey had sworn his revenge on Tony for pelting him with eggs during their first (of many) food fights, and had retaliated by pouring glitter into Tony’s beard oil, with help from Steve. Tony’s howl of outrage that next morning could practically be heard across the top three floors of the tower, only drowned out by Rhodey’s victorious cackle. Steve loved every moment of it.
