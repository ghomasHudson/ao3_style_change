“So…” Tony began, drawing out the word.  “Thank you for being a total dick to my Dad.  That was pretty awesome.”  Steve didn’t respond, just stood there, a muscle in Steve’s jaw ticking off the seconds in time with Tony’s watch.  “I feel like you kind of want to say that they started it, but you’re thinking that sounds too childish.  If so, let me remind you my Dad just literally greeted you by polishing his cue stick.”
“Sorry,” Steve mumbled, tossing the towel over his shoulder.  “Here.  Eat,” he said, putting a plate of buttered toast and a steaming cup of coffee down in front of Tony.
“I do like you, Your Highness,” Steve heard his own ragged voice say, and immediately felt a rush of cold that made his stomach churn, even as the King’s hand slowed and gentled against his hair.  It was a lie.  It had to be.  A manipulation.  It wasn’t true.  He didn’t think he could handle it, if it were true, because what would that say about him?  Had circumstances been different…but, they weren’t.  He was a slave, and the King was his master, and a kind master was something he couldn’t afford to let his mind allow.
how I would want to go out?” Tony replied, then huffed out a shaky laugh.  “If you really want to, then...fine. Yeah. I’d--yeah. I’d like that. I just--Jesus. Okay.”
“I prefer to think of it as a well-planned recon op,” Steve countered, then ducked his head and sipped at his—God, it was actually blue, Tony noticed with a shudder--drink.  “Bucky—my roommate?  He’d let me play for free when he worked the counter here,” Steve admitted, giving Tony a sheepish look from under his ridiculously long lashes.  “One of his first gigs when we got to Vegas.”
Yinsen posed the question to Steve, who shrugged and gestured again.  “He says he does not know.”  But, if Tony wasn’t mistaken, there was something of a smile in Yinsen’s voice.
“Maybe.  Maybe not.  If I can’t find proof, this could still blow up in our faces.  There’s nothing to say he won’t leak that Restraining Order or God only knows what else,” Tony reminded him.
“It was,” Steve replied, trying to hold in his smile and probably failing miserably by Tony’s delighted expression.  He scowled instead. That seemed to delight Tony all the more.
“I—” she stopped, swallowing visibly, eyes darting up to Tony before dropping her gaze back down.  “Forgive me, Your Majesty,” she pleaded, sinking to her knees.  “Please, I beg of you.” The man quickly knelt, too.  Steve could hear him blubbering even over the fountain.
good at it,” Steve said, voice softening a bit on the last.  “You put all that between you and the world like some kind of buffer, and then there was this split second where it was like I was inside that zone or something.  Your attention was on me, and…I didn’t have the first clue what to do with it, to tell you the truth.  Guess what I’m saying is that I still don’t sometimes, but…I think I’d like to try.”
Rhodey would be proud. Well, once he got past the yelling at Tony coming back here again without him and rummaging through Steve's things like a garage-sale early-bird. But, eventually, definitely proud. It was done. Over. Steve would drop the paperwork off tomorrow, the lawyers would take it from there, and Tony never had to worry about this again.
“James. Come on, man, we’re practically related by marriage,” Rhodey said.  “Which is why you and I need to have a conversation.  Buckle up.”
“Do you know about the War? The Civil War in America, I mean?” Steve asked.  It seemed like an entirely stupid question to ask of such a creature, and yet...and yet.  “I know I talk about it some. The War. Which is--well, that’s neither here nor there, I guess. But, do you--have you heard of it?  Know of it? I keep going on, and,” he broke off with a sigh, running his hand through his hair. “I sometimes think you understand far more than you possibly should, and then I think maybe I’m crazy and just lonely and
Stark shrugged and finished his drink, then walked around from behind the bar.  “That’s the question, isn’t it? The million dollar question, I guess you could say.  See what I did there?  Anyway, Steve--can I call you Steve?” Steve nodded. “Have you seen the Grand Canyon?”
“Do, I, uh… pay now, or how does, ah. How does this work?” Steve stammered, grimacing awkwardly. Probably, he should have figured this out beforehand, but it wasn’t like he could exactly ask Tony, even if he had wanted to, since Tony was
“And I’m so fucking glad it was you, Tony, I’m so fucking glad,” Steve rasped out, his voice breaking on the last. “Do you hear me?” He shook Tony a bit for good measure. “I wanted it to be you, Tony. I wanted that s
And Ross?  Tony knew him more by reputation than anything, but Obie had glad-handed the General enough that Tony could believe there had to be something there.  He would just…ignore JARVIS’ question about why now, with everything else going on, Tony had a sudden interest in ferreting out political corruption involving very specific individuals.
What had changed though?  If Steve had really spent months trying to get Tony’s attention, why suddenly settle for, well, that kind of attention?  Steve was hardly the fuck-and-run kind, which, dear Lord, do not pick at that thread, he told himself sternly.  That was jumping way too far ahead.
“I don’t know if I should like sailing, anyway,” Cam said. Steve could almost hear the frown in the boy’s voice. “Do you think I would like the Free States? What is it like there?”
“Hey.  You’re doing that on purpose.  That Omega mind trick thing.  Don’t think I don’t know what you’re up to, trying to manipulate me like that.  It’s totally unfair, by the way,” Tony accused.
“I’m fine,” Steve hissed out through clenched teeth.  He felt a bubble of laughter well up inside him, though he managed to keep it at a groaning chuckle.  Fine.  He was fine. He could barely remember to breathe, too caught up in the constant, demanding pulse of his cock and the aching soreness of his ass to do much of anything, and the thought that Tony knew this was driving him insane with desire, but sure, he was fine.  He wasn’t sure if he wanted to throw himself at Tony and beg for release or murder the man as soon as he saw him. Steve laughed again, a broken, sobbing sound, and nearly shoved his fist into his mouth, but gripped the front of his robe instead, twisting the finely wrought material in his hand.
life. Their life together, his and Brock’s. He could do this.  It wasn’t like he hadn’t done worse, and it was only sex, and it didn’t really matter because Brock was fine with it, so it wasn’t cheating, not really…even if he couldn’t squelch the feeling that he was doing something wrong.
“Ow!” Tony growled sharply, twisting away from Steve’s hands, a flash of pain marring his features at the effort.
He stepped back a fraction, wrapped his arms around his middle and looked over at the shield.  The shield.  Captain America’s shield.  Holy fuck.  He was going to wake up, any second now.  Have a laugh about all this.  Hey, Steve, remember that time I dreamed you were a dead superhero?  That was a real corker, wasn’t it?
Tony’s heart froze in his chest.  Panic speared a trail down Tony’s spine and twisted through his gut, knocking whatever words he was going to say out of his throat.
“I dreamt you were falling,” Steve said suddenly, eyes dark and hard with question.  “And there was no Hulk.  Just you.  Falling.”
“People magazine?” Steve choked out.  For some reason, even though he’d known, in theory, what becoming involved with Tony Stark meant, and the interest that would undoubtedly arise from the press, magazine covers hadn’t really entered into the equation.
“You went to a lot of trouble to get a few home movies to me,” Steve pointed out, raising an eyebrow in question.
“Most do,” Tony said.  “In their defense, I’m a lot to handle.  Ah, sorry, there’s a message here on the Avengers line.  I need to check in.  I’ll just,” he said, pointing at an alcove by the restroom.
Tony rubbed the pad of his thumb back and forth over the back of Steve’s hand, just below where the tape flattened and IV tube to the vein.  Tony was vaguely aware of blue-gloved hands adding padding and dressing to cover the wound, and soon, it was gone in a cloud of white.  That’s where the star goes, Tony thought with sudden dizzying pitch of near-hysteria.  It was crazy.  All of this was crazy, except no one was acting like it was crazy, and that somehow made it worse, because Tony was the fool who thought this was crazy.
“Surely, you don’t intend to drive this without Captain Rogers?” Jarvis asked, cocking an eyebrow at Tony.    “Why do I even bother asking?  Of course, you do.  You do realize that driving without a license remains somewhat frowned upon by the authorities.  And, to think, your mother was so hoping for jewelry,” Jarvis said with a deep sigh.
“In general?  Probably,” Tony replied.  He lifted the bottle to his mouth and took a drink, though his eyes stayed on Steve.  There was a familiar quality to the look.  It was the same one Tony got whenever he was trying to figure out a problem or how best to fix something that should, by all rights, be irreparably broken.  Assessing, Steve thought.  That’s what the look is.
“Yeah, you know, dinner and stuff,” Tony said, heading for the dining room that Steve had paid little attention to last night.  A large wooden table dominated the room, surrounded by plush chairs and, now that he noticed it, laden with all kinds of take-out boxes.  Tony waved his hand at the spread, “I wasn’t sure what you liked,” which Steve translated to “So I just ordered one of everything.”  Now that he saw and smelled the food, he realized he was actually quite hungry.  He’d woken up late this morning, skipped breakfast in what turned out to be a futile attempt to catch the bus and make it to work on time.  He’d had a jelly sandwich for lunch because Clint had been eating the peanut butter out of the jar with his fingers and Steve just wasn’t that hungry just yet despite the fact that it was near the end of the month so their grocery supplies had dwindled quite a bit in anticipation of the upcoming payday.  He felt his stomach rumble in anticipation.
“He says...he says he will carry his things,” Yinsen finally admitted with a sigh. “And to stop calling him that.”
“Let me do most of the talking this time, okay?” Steve urged, rifling through the papers as he frowned down at them.
"Nine days," Bruce replied, and Steve could hear a lot left unsaid in those words.  "Steve, you and I both know the power of the serum.  Can you please try not test its limits again?”  Bruce asked, though there was a trace of what must have been true worry still tightening his voice.
“He’s never been too busy before,” Sam observed mildly.  “Not for you, anyway.  At first, it was, well…odd, I guess.  Sitting out in the middle of nowhere on some campaign and here comes the King with a wagon full of…whatever it was that got in his head.  I thought it was magic.  At first.  Remember?  That—that thing that shot fire?  And he just sits down, grabs a bowl of whatever it was we were eating, never you mind, and starts talking to you like he’s picking up in the middle of a conversation and he thought up a great argument that he had to come tell you.”
“I—I don’t have any idea what you just said,” Steve replied, the first sting of embarrassed annoyance start to creep into his voice.  “Look, forget it, okay?  It was just an idea. You said to tell you,” Steve finished, almost petulantly.  Tony groaned and rolled over to Steve’s side, leaving one hand over the flat of Steve’s stomach, still warm and wet from where his mouth had been before Steve derailed all higher brain function.
“You are very popular with the common folk, you will see,” Cam went on, seemingly oblivious to Steve’s distress.  “Always, the Castle servants and slaves, they ask me about you, but I tell them, they are not fit to speak of you, for you are the King’s own, and he would not like anyone to carry tales.  This is true, I think,” Cam nodded firmly.  “He worries,” Cam added, almost as an afterthought. “I heard him talking with General Rhodes this morning after I finished helping you dress. The King said that he should leave you in the Tower, where you are safe, but he could not bear to be without you.  General Rhodes said the King would worry the whole time either way, and at least this way, he will not be in such ill sorts because of—because of…on account of having your company,” Cam finally settled on.
“Like in a food truck?  Don’t think so.  They have those gourmet popcorn shops now.  Kettle corn. Jalapeno flavored. Bacon popcorn,” Tony rattled off.  “Some salesman used to send Dad a big bucket of it every Christmas.”
“Tony,” Steve blurted out, holding up his hands in surrender. He stood up and walked over to where Tony was rocking a bit back and forth on his heels, all barely-contained motion, looking anywhere but at Steve.  “I’m not sure how to act either, to tell you the truth.”
The hardest lie to reject is the one you want to believe, but, he’d reached and missed, and now they were here, and Tony was giving himself headaches over something he thought he’d lost, but had really been taken.
“This…this is the arc reactor, isn’t it?” Steve marveled.  “Like what you want to build for the clean energy project.”
“None of that is…it isn’t on you, Tony.  Not you,” Steve insisted, looking up at Tony for a long moment before dropping his gaze back to the sketchbook in his lap.  Tony followed Steve’s gaze and stared at the sketch for a long moment.  Tony with a relaxed smile on his face leaning against the tree, hair swaying a bit in the breeze, looking up at the sky with eyes bright with an expression that Tony barely recognized.  Steve set the drawing aside and fisted his hand into the top of his thigh, rubbing up and down for a moment before looking up at Tony.  Tony tracked the movement, sighed and let his eyes fall closed.  Too bright, he thought.
Steve ground his jaw in frustration and let out a huff of air.  He was silent for a long moment, watching as Tony looked out the window at the passing walls of rock, his eyes unseeing.
“Are you mad with me, Shelhead? If I did something wrong, I’m sorry, really, I didn’t mean to, Shellhead, I swear. I just—I haven’t, I mean…” he stammered, breaking off as an enormous bubble of doubt and recrimination seemed to fill his chest, pushing all the air out.  “Did you not like it?”
.  He had known, somehow, that Tony wasn’t there to hurt him, and he was as sure of the truth of that now as he had been then.
“I’ll just,” Tony said with a nod towards his bedroom door that was clearly meant to communicate that he would put on actual clothing that did not require a fucking crane to stay put, remove the ass napkins from his face, make his hair look like something other than a massively misguided attempt at a perm, and somehow cobble together a semblance of dignity from denial, short-term memory loss and probably duct tape, because why not?
There was a tsunami rushing through Tony’s ears, all tremors and shockwaves, like the place on his wrist was the little red, radiating dot on a map showing the epicenter of some great, tectonic shift.  Steve bent his head, a swath of dark blonde hair falling across his forehead, eyes dark as he watched Tony from underneath it.  It was over before Tony’s brain caught up with what was happening.
And books. Books everywhere.  Rows of them tucked neatly into shelves that took up a whole wall.  Stacks of them here and there, including a large stack that seemed to be serving as a footrest for one of the chairs.  More books than Steve had ever seen in his life.  Whoever lived here must be very learned, Steve figured, though he supposed if he were to live alone in a strange castle hidden in the mountains with books as his only companion, he might be a few things other than just
How hard would it be, really?  It was just sex. He’d had sex.  Sure, not a lot until Brock, at least not more than a few handjobs here and there and a couple of furtive blow jobs where he worried more about getting caught than just about anything else, but he figured their sex life was probably pretty normal now. It wasn’t like sex was a big deal, and it was over pretty quickly, anyway.
“Tony!” Steve shouted.  “That is not—Tony, Zola is not set in his ways or making mistakes in his dotage.  He is evil.  He uses pain and threats to keep everyone too scared to say or do anything against him, but he is not who you think he is.”
“Okay, well....good,” Steve nodded, still trying to smile.  By the look on Tony’s face, he wasn’t doing a very good job of it.  “I’ll just--I’ll see you for dinner then?”  He could hear his voice rise on the last, hopeful and nearly pleading, which ended with a stab of self-annoyance.  It wasn’t like it was a big deal. He ate by himself all the time back at SHIELD.
“Wow, you—you really have no idea, do you?” Steve cut in with a bitter huff of a laugh.  “The waitlist for an evaluation is four months long, unless you’re an imminent threat.  And even then, you only get an evaluation and a few sessions covered. Not to mention that they drug test you weekly at the club, and I can’t have any of that stuff in my system, or I’ll get fired.”  Steve looked away for a moment, at the other diners who were enjoying their food, chatting with waiters and occasionally pointing at Tony while surreptitiously attempting to take a photo.  “In a little bit, none of that will matter, right?  Then I can…do whatever.  I don’t know.  I’ll handle it.  It’s fine,” Steve insisted, going back to his plate of food, mainly to give himself something to do.
“It does kind of help,” Tony muttered with a huff of breath, shaking his head back and forth at the admission.  “Would’ve been nice, you know. If we’d just sort of…met, I mean.  Maybe at one of those stupid parties.  Like normal, you know?  You’d have liked it.  I’m sure I used several rude hand gestures throughout the evening.”
Tony reached for the bottle and held it up in front of him, swirling the remaining contents around in the bottom before bringing it to his mouth and swallowing the rest, squeezing his eyes shut as they watered where it burned a path down his thorat.  He was thrilled for Pepper and Happy.
, but he’s also…he’s…a good man.  And you, you and Coulson and Shield, you’re doing great, taking care of Captain America, but no one is really paying attention to Steve Rogers.  And he needs someone, too.  People.  Who are on his side.  He’s used to a team, and now, he’s by himself, basically.  Strike Team isn’t exactly the Howling Commandos, and he misses that.  That’s…that’s all I’m saying.”
Steve was here, seeing him, alone with another Alpha in a place he wasn’t supposed to be, standing so close to the other man that they were all but embracing.  Next to him, Stone visibly stiffened and drew his shoulders back.  His mouth flattened into a thin line, and he shot Tony a narrow-eyed look that felt like an accusation.
“I—yeah, of course.  I was the one who—I wanted to come here,” Tony stammered.  He had wanted to come here.  He wanted to be here.  He did.  It was just…why had he wanted to come here so badly?  That thread of thought, that need, floated at the end of a kite string he couldn’t quite catch.  When he tried to look at it, all he saw was bright, scorching his eyes until he had to look away.
He let his gaze drift back over to the slaves where they worked the bellows.  It was easy, after a time, to barely notice they were there.  To just let his gaze move right past them as they disappeared into the background.  Once, he would have sworn that was impossible, but now, he could all too clearly see how easy it was to look right past the things you didn’t want to see.  Those quiet, awful things that hid behind a careful veneer of comfort and security.  A beautiful flower in bloom while dark, twisted roots dug deeper and deeper into fertile ground. How simple it must have been for Tony, born into this life of incredible privilege, to learn to see only that part of his world and not the part that was so easily buried.
“Tell me about your project. Energy? Like for ...for power?” Steve asked almost haltingly, like he was trying out the words.
“Yes, if he wants to,” Steve said. His voice sounded odd. Needy. He breathed out and pinched the bridge of his nose. “Please.” He didn’t know why it mattered. It shouldn’t matter. She would probably tell him no. Or the man wouldn’t be available. Or, more likely, want to do that again. Not with Steve, anyway. Who could blame him?
Steve brought their hands up to his chest, twisted them enough so that he could lean down and press a kiss to the inside of Tony’s wrist.
“Huh?  Ah, oh, yeah.  That, ah. Sounds good,” Tony said.  He gave Steve a soft, wobbly smile, then ducked past him towards the hallway, grabbing his bag from the sofa, as Steve walked over to the refrigerator and pulled it open.
A huge thank you to my beta, tastes-like-coconut for always making me better.  All remaing mistakes are totally the fault of Google Docs.
Steve trailed his mouth down Tony’s neck, stopping to suck and nip, then lave with his tongue, until he found the curve of Tony’s neck, where he undid the tie at Tony’s throat and slowly peeled the top of Tony’s shift apart, following the line of skin it revealed with his lips.  He pulled back and parted the shift with one hand, letting out a shuddering breath as he looked down at Tony.
Tony dipped his fingers in the water to check the temperature, then sat Steve down on his bottom in the bath.  Steve looked momentarily shocked by the water, then started pounding his hands on the surface, sending splashes of water into Tony’s face.
“I’m not sick,” Steve said, and for a disconcerting moment, it was like hearing his own voice echoed back to him.  “I’m not sick, Tony.  I’m not unwell.  I said I didn’t want to be with you tonight because…because I wanted to see what would happen.”
“Like this,” Steve said, sinking to his knees on the floor in front of Tony. And, oh.  Oh.  Well, that was.  That was.  Every fiber of Tony’s being seemed to hum to life, stretching him taunt like a bow, skin prickling and mouth dry and he was harder than he thought he’d ever been and his Omega was kneeling in front of him and he was beautiful and perfect and so bright and he shone, he shone, he shone, and holy fuck---
“---and then, she just showed up back at camp with the thing’s pelt on her shoulders and….” Steve trailed off, his steps slowing, his gaze coming to rest on Tony. “You’re worrying again.”
“Right,” Tony agreed.  “Right, that’s…exactly what we wanted.  Great publicity.  Press is lapping it up.  Public loves us.  Kind of has this fairy tale vibe going, Pepper says.  Playboy bachelor meets stripper with a heart of gold, who tames said playboy’s wild ways, makes an honest man of him, all that.”
“I am sorry I failed them,” Tony whispered, voice bleak and hollowed with remorse. His cheeks were stained with trails of tears through the dust from their journey, and Steve watched as he blinked rapidly, then wiped a hand across his eyes.  Steve wanted to object to Tony’s words, to tell him again it wasn’t his fault, but there was a greater truth in them that he couldn’t deny any more than Tony would have him do so.   These were Tony’s people, in a way Steve was only beginning to understand, and trying to take their deaths from him took their lives from him, as well.  The same thread, Steve thought.  It was true that Tony bore some claim to what those he trusted had done in his name, but this place, the joys Steve had known here, the lives they had lived, those were Tony’s as well, and he would not trade that to be free of whatever responsibility he took for their fate.  You can’t have one without the other, was that not what Tony kept trying to tell him?
“There’s a department store, down on the end,” Tony suggested after he realized he was supposed to be the one who knew and cared about this stuff.  He pointed towards the large store that dominated part of the mall.  Steve nodded, and started walking in the direction Tony had indicated.
“Damn straight it does,” Steve said without turning, then promptly went back to pretending to listen to whatever Howard was saying about the 800 Club.
Which was good.  Of course, Steve wasn’t going to just hang out while Tony snoozed away the morning.  Made things easier, really.  Though, it was one of those odd things that left him unsure how to feel about it.   Thankful, he supposed.  But, there it was again. The unexpected thing.  No one dragging him out of bed, telling him to quit being so lazy.  Which, considering the time, would’ve been a tad hard to deny, he thought with a sigh.
It was familiar, but the odd, unsettling kind of familiar where it was unexpectedly exactly the same as he pictured it in his mind, but smaller somehow.  Less.
“I’m not really someone you bench, Tony,” Steve replied with a wry twist to his mouth.  “I kinda like their solution, anyway,” he finished, voice going soft and almost unsure.
“I thought you’d like it,” Steve said, glancing up at Tony long enough to catch his eye before letting his gaze dip to the floor again.
“They needed to hear it,” Steve argued, frowning, then catching himself and forcing his face to relax.  Stark smiled softly at him, almost proudly, and he felt his stomach swoop. “Anyway,” he continued, clearing his throat. “I think we’ve probably bothered Mr. Stark enough for one night. Why don’t we head back down to the slots?”
“Why me?  You could’ve had practically any Omega out there, to hear my parents tell it.  Why pick me?” Tony asked.
“I see it,” Tony repeated. “And it makes me want to tear those pages out and burn them. I want the part that destroys those training dummies down in the yard no matter how fast I have them made. All of you, Steve. I will love all of you, no matter what it is, I swear it. I
Just knowing it was happening sent searing, phantom pain through his veins. The iron bands that seemed to be wrapped around his chest tightened.  He tried to breathe again. It felt like there was no air in the room. No air in him. His head throbbed. A warm, wet rivulet of blood trickled down his neck from his ear. His dry eyes stung.   All he could do was stare at Obie as the man he had considered family tore his heart from his chest. Too late, Tony thought dazedly. Too late, I already gave it to someone else, he thought with a hysterical sort of numb horror blinkering his thoughts.
“Red Bull, schmed bull. Put this crap in the ocean, those sharks really would fly.  Oh. Damn,” Rhodey paused, pulling a face.
“Roll over for me, gorgeous,” Tony urged in a low, throaty voice that sent a spike of pure want straight down the head of Steve’s cock.
“Excuse me?” Tony demanded, voice pitching high.  “You did what now?  Because, here I was, secure in my knowledge that giving Oceanus a bit of holiday cheer got the gold star on the What Not To Do Chart, but you come back at me with ‘jumped on a grenade in Basic,’ and my whole worldview is shattered.  Is grenade a metaphor for explosively hot guy with a, ah, short pin?  I’m not judging,” Tony assured with a quick wave of his hands.
Sand spilled out of the tear in the punching bag and onto the gym floor. Steve stared at it a moment, watching it fall to the ground the way the grains flow down through an hourglass. He spared a glance for his mangled hand. Dark spots stained the wrappings and red rivulets trailed down his fingers to the tips where thick, red beads formed, waiting for their turn to fall.
“There’s…there’s no subletting,” Steve answered.  Which, Tony thought, was about the most Steve thing possible to say, so he grinned and pulled out his phone, hitting the first contact on the list.
"I did. I read about it in the rep--the, ah. News. News report. I'm sorry about, well. Everything.  What happened in Afghanistan. The incident at your lab.  The crash.  That must've been terrible for you, losing someone so close to you like th--" Steve tried.
Objectively, of course, if Steve really didn't want him, it probably wasn't because of the epically terrible dinner, but damn if that didn't seem emblematic of everything Tony couldn't seem to manage to be, even when he tried.
Steve looked down at his shoes for a moment.  He had the absurd thought that he should have shined them before tonight.  They were scuffed and seemed out of place here.  If he was going to back out, now was the time.  The limo was still parked out front.  He could just call it a night, apologize profusely, walk out the door and pretend this whole thing never happened.  Go back to his life.  His life.  Go back.  Back to what, exactly?  Everything was just as he’d left it.  There was still no good solution to the money issue.  No amount of hard work or perseverance was going to suddenly produce the ten grand a month for a private facility.  So, he could walk out of here, head held high that he’d done the right thing and go back to watch his mom’s condition deteriorate further, hear more lectures in Very Compassionate Voices about institutionalization, moving on, letting go, here-have-a-pamphlet, about how he’d done enough and, his favorite, the it-was-for-the-best lecture.  Best for who?  No one ever said.
Steve sank down next to him. Only a couple of inches separated them.  He could feel Tony’s warmth, see the way the occasional breeze ruffled his hair, how the sun made his freckles stand out.  It was the closest he had been to Tony.  He allowed himself to relish it, just for a bit.  Tony’s nearness. It was intoxicating, or at least, what he remembered the feeling being like, those few times he and Bucky managed to get into the liquor, his insides all loose and shaky, his mind a wash of giddy happiness, his body warm and languid.
“Under arrest and confined to his chambers while the inquiry is going on, though he denies everything, and what proof is there?” Cam asked, the air seeming to go out of his body as he flopped back against the chair and tosses the sugar-covered fried dough roll back onto the platter that sat between them.  He always went for the sweets first, not that Steve minded.  It was hard sometimes, in all of this, to remember that he was only twelve, barely out of childhood to have seen and endured so much. “Slaves cannot give testimony, and with Zola gone, there is no one to name him a liar.”
Steve came with a long, low groan, his throat bobbing as the tendons in his neck pulled tight, cock pounding erratically into Tony in the final few, stuttering thrusts as he filled Tony with warm spurts of cum.  Tony sighed contentedly, letting his loosened body rock with the motion. Steve grunted and fell forward, sticking out a hand to catch himself.  He lowered himself down, pulling Tony’s back flush to his chest and rolled them to the side, away from the mess.  Hands coiled under Tony’s arms and pulled him tight.  He could feel the burgeoning pressure as Steve’s knot grew, pulsating deep inside him.
Shared life experience, Steve thought, closing his eyes for a moment.  It should’ve been something we shared, something we understood about the other, instead of a wedge between us.  But, maybe we’re both just a little too good at it, he wondered, opening his eyes and focusing on the screen again.
“I think you’re ready,” Tony said, letting his fingers fall out of Steve’s hole with a wet, obscene sound. Yes, Steve thought distantly, yes, Tony. Tony placed one more kiss on Steve’s shoulder and reached up to wipe the sweat-slickened hair from Steve’s forehead. “You’re doing so good for me,” he added with an awed whisper.
“He’s still kind of ticked about the press conference,” Tony explained with a grimace.  “I should’ve told him.  Before I did that, I mean.  Not like I don’t get where he’s coming from.  He’s SI’s Air Force liaison.  Kind of a big deal if we cut off production in the middle of contracts, not to mention what’s in the pipeline.  He says the lawyers already called him, told him not to talk to me.”
A spurt of hysterical laughter welled up inside him.  His eyes focused on Howard.  His face was red from drink or anger or both.  His eyes were bulging and his mouth was some bastardization of a smile, filled with loathing and contempt that Tony could finally see wasn’t really even aimed at him.  Just deflected back, he supposed.
“Look,” Tony started, holding up his hands in front of him as he walked towards the metal detector that stood next to the security desk.  “You know who I am, and you know who my Alpha is.  He’s here somewhere, and I’m going to find him.  You are free to do whatever you think you need to do to try to stop me, and…however that goes for me, I’ll be sure to tell Steve that you were just doing your jobs,” Tony told them without breaking stride.
Tony stared at the phone for a second, then shook his head.  Damn it, Rhodey.  Now, I’ve got something in my eye, he thought, a strange, light feeling running through him that he thought might be joy.
Steve wanted to show him.  Wanted it more than he had realized until this moment.  It had been so long.  So God-damned long since he’d felt this way.
Tony tried for a leer, but it came out too soft at the corners for that, Steve thought.  A lot of Tony’s aim on that front had been off lately, like he was sloughing off some phantom armor and sometimes forgot he wasn’t wearing it anymore.
“Do you think I’m ugly?” Steve asked, his voice gentle.  Tony shook his head. “You’re beautiful,” Steve told him.  “Beautiful Tony.” Tony flushed, warm and tingly. He wasn’t sure if it was true, but he
“You’ll take good care of him for me, won’t you?” the King asked, drawing Steve’s gaze back up.  “Even though he talks a lot and forces you not only to listen, but probably scrub the scabs off his toes.  Does he have scabby toes?  Probably does.  Let’s say he does anyway.  Makes me feel better,” the King added.  Steve watched Cam grin, then his eyes widen and the smile drop off his face, as if he had been caught doing something wrong.  “Go on then, now. That’s a good lad.”
“I like how responsive you are to me.  I like how you felt under my hand.  I like the sounds you gave me when you came.  I like how hot and tight you were around my cock.  So beautiful.  You have no idea, do you? So very, very beautiful for me,” the King continued in that same low, rough voice that scraped over Steve’s skin, sending shivers of heat arcing down his length until his cock was hard, straining against the loincloth, and he knew the King could see it, feel it, and it was terrible, awful, wrong, and he wanted it anyway.
He cut the repulsors off and slowed until he was just floating.  There was nothing in front of him. Or, there was, but it was too far away to look like anything other than pinpricks of light.  He turned, and let the glow of the sun fill the eye slits on the mask. Even out here, it was bright, at least compared to everything else. It really was beautiful, he thought.  All of it. It really, really was.
“I’m sure he will let you join him if you wish,” Steve replied.  “I don’t think there are spirits in the mines, but the danger is real enough, even though I’m sure you won’t go that deep.  You must not wander off.”
“And the kind of thing that required quite the network to move that much money,” Natasha explained.  “A lot of that flows through Vegas. They use the casinos to repatriate the funds from offshore through a complicated system of gambling schemes, dummy corporations, and tax shelters.  Doesn’t hurt that so many military conventions happen here, and that you have a Senator who seems really interested in making sure that continues. It isn’t just the top brass and corporate reps who attend those things, so all these people being in the same place talking doesn’t really draw the kind of attention it normally would.  We followed a tip, and trailed an arms broker, Ulysses Klaue, to the club, which is how we knew they were using that as a sort of meeting spot.”
Not all of them, Steve had said.  You could tell.  Well, Steve could tell, whatever.  Probably other Alphas could, too, but at least some of the people in the pictures had been Omegas, which no doubt was the titillation tipping point that parted the good GI from the stipend he had been planning to send home to his mom in Nebraska.
And then it got a little weird.  Steve could’ve sworn the AI actually hesitated.  “Sir has returned to his penthouse,” JARVIS offered enigmatically.
“Hey, remember when we nicknamed him Coitus Interruptus?  Because, I do,” Tony grumped, giving Barnes a long-suffering look.
“Welcome,” the man greeted him as Steve approached. He seemed a bit more chipper than his predecessor, though Steve thought it best not to mention that. “Room Six, I presume?” Steve nodded. “Tap here to authorize the transaction.”
When he was little, he remembered being fascinated by the small looking glass Bucky’s mother had next to her hairbrush and the lotion she used for her hands that smelled like lavender.  He would put his hand on the underside of the looking glass and hold it up until he saw his reflection, and he would wonder if the person he was looking at was the same him that he was or some other him, who lived in the flat world under the glass.  This, the castle, the path, the bridge, it felt a bit like that, he thought, momentarily so unsettled that he listed toward the edge of the path without realizing what he was doing and stumbled back, pressing himself against the wall.
“The King wants him.  He sent for him, and I wasn’t there and—sorry.  I’ll send you some of my best to make up for the inconvenience, Lord Hammer, but—“ Zola shrugged.
“You’re not selfish,” Steve protested.  “What happened, it wasn’t your fault, Tony.  You know that. It was Zola and Stane and...” he trailed off.   And this world, he thought to himself, but left the accusation unspoken between them.
“Now, strip. And kneel. Here,” Tony pointed to a spot on the carpeted floor near the center of the tent. “Hands behind your back.” He started towards one of the trunks, not waiting to see if Steve would comply, then stopped and turned, staring hard at Steve, who hadn’t yet moved.
“Tony, what are you talking about? The thing with Thanos?” Steve asked, “You didn’t—that wasn’t you, and we won. We won, Tony, and we all lived, and that’s—that’s what’s important.”
“One of my little designs,” Kirk said, tapping a finger to the silver watch on his wrist.  “Keeps perfect time and, when applied correctly, gives off a small, but very painful, electric shock.”
For some reason, he thought of a game of hide and seek he’d played with Jarvis, watching through the slats of the closet doors with a strange combination of excitement and a creeping sort of dismay that he would be discovered.
“No, no, nothing like that.  Just…different.  And this one…this one, I believe just might catch our patron’s attention.  For a night,” the man snorted, lips curling into a sneer of distaste.  “Sadly, he rarely enjoys their company for longer than that, but, our situation requires that a good selection be maintained for his household and guests. Has this one had any formal training?”
“What did you see?” Tony asked after a long moment. “I know it was something, and it sure as hell wasn’t what I saw, so say it. What did the stones show you?”
“You should hear out you say my name,” Tony whispered breathily, face going soft and slack. “Like it is the most beautiful word you’ve ever heard.  I could hear it for the rest of my life and never grow tired of it.”
“Everything,” Tony said softly, though Steve had no idea what he meant by it.  He tried to think on it, rolling the word around in his mind, but the wispy arms of sleep claimed him before he could.
Steve turned in surprise, finding Tony leaning against the wall behind the door, safely ensconced under the shadow of a parapet above while he watched the finger of darkness draw its dark path across the balcony.  He was dressed in finery again, this time a dark red coat shot through with gold over tan breeches and black leather boots.  The ever-present necklace hung in the middle of his chest.  In his hand, Tony held the handkerchief he had once offered to Steve that night on the road.  He was rubbing it between his fingers, almost idly, but Steve didn’t think Tony did much that was truly idle.
“Please just trust me that you’ll feel better about this whole thing after you get a bit of sleep?  Clear your head.  You…you need to think about things…about what you’re really comfortable with before…well, just sleep, okay?” Steve prodded, placing a hand on Tony’s lower back and propelling him towards the bed.  Tony sprawled on top of the covers in a flop, then turned over to stare at the ceiling while Steve lay down next to him.  He took a long drink from the bottle of water, because Steve had said he should, and placed it on the bedside table.  It was nice curled up here next to Steve, he had to admit.  Not the kind of nice he’d had in mind, but still nice.  He grabbed a pillow and handed it to Steve for his head.  Just in case.
Steve was getting up from the table, his chair scraping over the floor as he did like an announcement. He was going to go back to his life, his bad hand that wouldn't let him draw anymore, his job that he probably did with the same pride as he did everything else, his friends, who loved him, and his box of circuitry and letters and pieces of Tony that he'd kept for himself in a far too familiar way.
“Steve knows the President of MIT?” Tony asked, reading the letter again in case the words had rearranged themselves somehow.
“Well, it seems unlikely he’ll survive the fall, but you never know,” Tony said reasonably. “Can you budge over a bit, I need to get by.”
They had spoken.  Steve, stiffly and formal at first, telling a Tony who clearly already knew.  The palace traded on secrets, and Steve had never been good at intrigue, anyway.  Besides, it was not as if Tony could conceivably have an objection to the match.  That didn’t quite explain Steve’s nerves, admittedly.  He would rather have faced a hoard of foes on the battlefield than spend longer than he had to explaining to Tony why he had accepted Pierce’s offer.
“It’s nothing.  It’s--I’ll explain everything, I promise, okay?  Can we just—can we go? Come on. Elevator’s here,” Tony urged again.  He needed to get Steve away from here, away from this woman and her papers and photos filled with accusations, get him away from here and explain.
He could feel the gradual pressure building inside him, the familiar tingling sensation inside his cock and sense of a warm weight in his stomach.  He could hear the sharp, jagged little sounds torn out of him each time he took Tony in, mingled with Tony’s hard, guttural grunts.  Steve pulled himself almost all the way off Tony’s cock, letting the round head catch again on his loosened rim, then slammed down, seating himself fully on Tony’s hard length.
He doesn’t want to, Steve thought with a flush of desperation rising in his throat.  He’s going to say no.  No, he won’t say no. There will be some excuse, something nice, something to spare Steve’s feelings.  I shouldn’t have asked, Steve thought.  I shouldn’t have asked.  I should have known.
It had been accidental, maybe, at first, Steve knew.  Like Tony hadn’t been able to quite help himself. But, then, the second time, that was deliberate.  That was banter, wasn’t it?  Flirting? Maybe not flirting.  But...something.  Something
Tony was quiet again, this time, for such a long stretch that Steve started to worry he’d said the wrong thing.  Then Tony grunted, cleared his throat and hummed, almost curiously.  Steve could picture him, leaning back against a leather sofa in front of a fire, with the mountains and lake out the window, just like the ones he had loved as boy, except now, the adventures were real.
“Come on my cock or not at all,” Steve ground out, hips snapping hard as he rammed in again as if in emphasis.  Tony whined in protest, but his cock jumped at Steve’s words where it reached for his stomach.  Steve pulled out, shifted, lowered his hips and spread Tony’s knees, then plunged in again, and oh, fuck, yes, there.  Tony thought he might have said that out loud, but he couldn’t tell over the buzzing in his head that thundered through his ears.  Again, the head of Steve’s cock slammed into Tony’s prostate, sending spirals of pressure and pleasure up Tony’s spine and down the length of his cock.  He wasn’t going to last.
Steve winced at the name, then looked down and nodded.   Checked his watch. Adjusted the jacket of the tuxedo Peggy had supplied him with for the evening’s gala.  It was something to do, other than thinking about this being Howard’s house. Tony’s now, he mentally corrected.  Something to do other than thinking about Stane. Steve’s hand curled into a fist on the top of his tuxedo trousers again, and he forced himself to relax, let out a low breath and looked over at Peggy.
“It’s not just the healing,” Tony said quietly.  Steve watched him bite his lip and look away, a far-off expression crossing over his features.
He let out a puff of air through his nose and pinched the bridge of it between his fingers, rubbing at the dull, aching throb there.  He missed Tony.  So damn much.  He’d known that he would lose Tony one day.  He’d known that from the beginning.  To Pepper or someone else.  Someone who smiled and laughed and made jokes and got his references and sparked his wonderful mind.  Someone who took him places, who liked to step out with his fella, maybe showed him off a bit.  A bitter, caustic taste burned a path up his throat and an answering sting pulled at the corners of his eyes at the thought, but he’d learned the hard way that not wanting something to happen didn’t stop it from happening.  He shook his head, trying to clear it, and clicked on the file as much to close off that line of thought as just to get this over with.
Steve reached for the stack of blocks again, then stopped, and grabbed for the cloth, holding it up towards Tony and making an insistent uh-uh-unh sound until Tony leaned far enough over the tub for Steve to tap the cloth against Tony’s face.  “Am I a mess, too?  And whose fault is that?”  Tony asked lightly.  “Probably shouldn’t try to answer that question, should we?  Yep, let’s just leave that one alone.”
“First thing this morning.  I heard it from one of the other attendants when I was bringing up the wine.  Oh.  There’s wine,” Cam added, tipping his head up and looking back towards the suite of rooms.  “I can get some, if you want…”
, and where did Steve get off knowing there was a difference--or whether Tony had noticed that Ellis’ team didn’t have a single Omega consultant or what Tony thought about the crap going down in Sokovia?  Why did Steve bother to listen when Tony got up in arms over violent rabbits, for God’s sake?
Steve let his arm slide down from Tony’s shoulders, but kept it at the small of Tony’s back, as the reporters departed.  “Let’s get out of here,” Tony said after a beat of what felt like silence after all the shouting, though the lobby was still filled with onlookers.  Tony shot him another assessing look, then shook his head, as if to clear it from all the flashes.  He took the sunglasses from his pocket and pushed them back onto his face, though he didn’t move away from Steve like Steve half expected him to do.  Still plenty of people with cellphones, Steve figured, glancing again around the hotel lobby.  Sure enough, several people were pointing and holding up their phones.  He was really going to have to have an actual conversation with Bucky about all this.  They didn’t have internet or TV at the apartment, but it wasn’t like they lived entirely under a rock.
“Speaking of, where’d you find this one?  Some pleasure house teach him to clench up and Sitwell fall for it again?” Hammer asked.  He dropped his hand from Steve’s chin and walked over to flop down on a small, tufted divan, plucking a peacock feather from a vase and waving it around in the air.
, no matter what anyone said.  Getting kidnapped had at least been interesting, which was more than he could say for Howard’s stupid My Son Isn’t Dead And All I Got Was This Lousy Ransom party, so when he noticed a shoulder-to-waist ratio that looked like it was sculpted by the gods, who could blame him for trying to tap that?
Tony turned to Steve, eyes assessing.  He walked out onto the mat opposite of Steve, just out of arm’s reach, and settled into a stance, arms up, one leg braced for balance.
“Don’t know if he knows how to do that,” Conference Room Steve said, then shucked his leather jacket onto the floor and pushed Tony’s knee up to give himself access.  He cupped Tony’s ass between his hands and lifted, spreading Tony wide.  Two fingers found Tony’s loose rim, then tugged at it, scooping up the last thread of come that dripped out and rubbing it between them until his fingers were at least semi-slick.  Without preamble, he shoved them in Tony’s hole, making Tony’s whole body shudder and go taut.  Steve felt his own cock jump, growing impossibly harder as he stared transfixed, at the sight of his own fingers disappearing into Tony’s body.
“Well, get in line, Stark.  You shoulda heard the Commandos when they found out about that one,” Steve admitted, a smile forming, though even in the low light, Tony could see Steve’s cheeks reddening at the memories.  “God, for months Dernier would randomly use French food words as suggestively as possible just trying to get a rise out of me.  To this day, I can barely say ‘croque monsieur’ and, no, I’m not telling you what he said that meant.”  Tony spat out a surprised laugh, then couldn’t quite stop himself once he got going, imagining the Commandos giving Steve hell over fancy French food words, and ended up hunched over and wiping tears from his eyes while trying to catch his breath.
“You know, I have one of these, too.  I can’t build robots for him to fight.  He just sits on my desk and looks angry,” she said with a wobbly smile.  “I think Steve would much prefer to fight your robot than looking over my paperwork, you know.  He
“Ready?” Cam prompted.  Steve nodded and watched Cam ring the bell by the door to alert the guards.  A moment later, the door was thrown open and the guards stepped back to allow Steve to pass.  He gave a quick look to Cam, who beamed at him, then walked out into the hall and fell into step between the two guards as they walked.  Neither touched him, he noticed, and again found himself wondering about the collar Tony had given him and what it signaled.  He should ask Cam.  The boy had a knack for rooting out gossip, and surely, someone would know whatever story was behind it.
“Think these belong to you,” Steve said, pulling a silver metal chain out of one of the pouches on his belt.  Tony released his hold on Steve’s uniform long enough to snake a hand up and grab for the dog tags, fitting them over his head with fumbling fingers that left them catching on his ear until he tugged them down.  The familiar weight, both lighter and heavier than he remembered, sitting high on his chest, the way they felt cool for a moment, then warmed against his skin, sent a flood of rightness through him that had been missing since someone jerked them off his neck.
“Yes,” Tony said, drawing in a breath. “We’re of an age, he and I, both raised to rule in our own ways, but even when we were younger, he could be… cruel. Indulged too much, maybe, I don’t know. I wonder sometimes, if I hadn’t had Jarvis to—” he stopped, shaking his head.
At least it was snowing in earnest now, Steve noted, which should cover their tracks. He only hoped that anyone Hydra sent out after them would be conveniently stupid or lazy enough to assume they were buried under whatever remained of jet and not go looking too much further in this weather.
The unlikely phrase, ‘I don’t want friends, I want to be a bottle of water,’ came to Tony’s mind, and he would have rolled his eyes at his own stupidity if Steve wasn’t watching him so closely.
“Okay, well, there were thousands of people there,” Steve began, scratching at his jaw as he tried to remember.  “This was ’56, I think. Just about more people than I’d seen in one place at that point. The artist, Brown, his studio was in Brooklyn.  I tried to go by there one day with some of my drawings. Thought maybe I could apprentice or something, but they wouldn’t let me past the door.  Stupid, really, someone like me, when he’s a real artist, trained in Italy and everything,” Steve said with a shrug. Shellhead snorted derisively and thumped a hand on Steve’s chest, then gestured firmly with it in the air.
say,” Tony explained. “You’re like my own personal focus group. Come on, hit me with that sweet, sweet boots-on-the-ground stuff. I’m listening.”
“Oh, dear Lord, that’s your whole fucking relationship in like seven sentences,” Clint observed, shaking his head in dismay.  “Muffin?” Clint offered hopefully.
“I don't know either, Tony. Look, you got what you came for, right? I signed the papers. No strings, no complaints, nothing. We're done. Like you said. That's what you wanted, isn't it? I mean, I think you've made that pretty damn clear,” Steve shouted back, taking a half-step forward before he spun out of Tony's way in the diminutive apartment and stalked the few steps to the tiny kitchen. He braced his hands on the edge of the counter, holding onto it so hard, Tony could see the blood squeeze out of his fingers, and thought about his own death-grip on the stair railing.
Thank you to everyone who has read, commented and left a kudos on this fic. I really, really appreciate it.
Thirty-six hours.  Not that long, really, but too long.  He wanted Steve, and he wanted everyone to stop looking at him, all sympathetic tut-tutting, thinking they knew, without knowing anything.  Soldiers and doctors, with their overly solicitous looks that were going to drive him up the wall.
Tony tore his mouth from Steve’s and arched his back and neck, mouth falling open, though he couldn’t manage anything more than breathing as Steve’s finger pushed all the way into him.  Steve was still in his uniform.  Still in his
“Anytime, my dear boy,” Jarvis said as he pulled open the door.  His voice sounded strangely thick and garbled, making Tony look up.  Jarvis was standing at the door, watching him, eyes glazed and face pinched and drawn.  It passed almost too quickly for Tony to catch, and the usual jovial expression fell into its place.
“Well.  I think we’re about done here, don’t you?” Tony suggested, giving Steve a jaunty smile and dropping his and Steve’s glasses off with another waiter.  “What do you think, dearly beloved, should we blow this popsicle stand or what?”
“You’ll have to tell me all about it over dinner. The gala, I mean,” Maria replied, falling back to her usual foxhole of inane conversation when things got awkward.
Shaking his head at the stray thoughts, Steve looked back down at his phone screen where the MIT Beaver logo underlined bright photos of the campus. He could probably arrange a tour or something like that, Steve thought.  Would Tony like something like that? A surprise trip? That...was a thing Omegas liked. He remembered from one of his searches.  Number six: Romantic Weekend Getaway.  He wasn’t sure if engineering professors and robots were romantic. Maybe they were to Tony, though, Steve thought with a small smile.  The Jetsons, he remembered.  The Jetsons and their robot maid.  Maybe they could be romantic for them.
With a low sigh, he turned around in a slow circle and looked at the workstation again, with the plastic sheet partially lifted. If he turned the computer on, Neil would probably have some words of wisdom.  Neil.  He should call Neil.  It had been too long since they talked.  There had been a message when he got back to Malibu, but he’d had JARVIS delete them all in a fit of not wanting to deal with anything.
“He mostly just lays around and talks about how wonderful you are,” Cam replied with a completely guileless expression.  Tony dropped the tool he was holding on the table and leaned back in his chair with a delighted grin.  He watched Steve sink down to his knees on the pillow across the room, eyes going dark and focused for a moment, boring into Steve.
He sounded like he was being sent to the guillotine.  Maybe even slightly less excited, if Steve were honest.  He sighed, grimacing a bit, then forced his face into a smile.  “That’s great, Tony.  Thanks for doing that.”
Steve shook his head and shifted forward, climbing onto the bed so that Tony had to scoot back, until his knees were braced on each side of Tony’s thighs.  He bent his neck and nudged his mouth lightly across Tony’s, tasting his lips, catching his breath, feeling the hint of the heat behind it. He circled his hips, stretching his hands up over his head and letting his thighs do the work, then ground down against Tony’s lap.  He could feel Tony’s erection pressing up against his own through Tony’s trousers, and God, didn’t that friction feel amazing? He moaned and thrust a bit, enjoying the sensation of the rough fabric of Tony’s pants against his sensitive length.
He was laughing, too, he realized, more because of Steve’s reaction than anything, but it was like someone had hit a release valve and everything that had been building up since they left the mini-golf came spilling out.  Tony rocked back on his heels, felt a small pull at his hand and   leaned forward again to the center of Steve’s chest.  He blinked.  Looked up.  Steve’s hands settled on Tony’s waist.  Tony’s breath hitched, his chest tightening and stomach swooping.  Whatever he might have said caught in his throat and refused to budge.  Steve was smiling down at him, laughter sparkling his eyes, lips still blue from the ridiculous drink he was so proud of winning, all handsy and adoring all of a sudden, like Tony was the only thing he cared about in the world.  He was beautiful.
“Not that we aren’t thrilled to see you Nick.  Because we’re not, but what are you doing playing delivery boy?” Clint asked suspiciously.
,” Tony rambled, the words spilling out of his mouth in an uninterrupted stream of want and need.  Steve lowered his hips again, grinding hard against Tony. He felt Tony’s body jump and quake under him.  Tony’s hands were hovering mid-air, fingers scabbering at nothing for a moment, then he dropped them down to claw at the bedspread with a soft, breathy whine.
“Excuse me, Mr. Stark.  Your table is ready, Mr. Hammer,” one of the other executive hosts said, indicating a poker table off to the right.
“Steve,” Tony breathed out, reaching for Steve, only to let his hand fall short, hovering there in the space between them.  “You don’t have to.  I shouldn’t have said anything.  I don’t know why—I—I wanted to help, not…this, never this.  I did not mean to cause you pain.  We need not speak of it--”
Steve stared at the man for a long moment, his heart thundering in his chest.  He could see himself reflected in the man’s eyes, he thought, which was impossible, and clearly, he couldn’t, not when he looked again, but--he
“Tony, I know you don’t have much reason to believe me when I say this, but I promise, everything will be alright,” Coulson said with a blasé smile.  “And by that, I mean that if anyone here causes you harm, threatens you, makes you feel uncomfortable in any way, if you stub a toe or get a paper cut, if anyone says anything that results in a mild case of the unhappys, or a sudden desire to listen to Alanis Morrisette and wear plaid, I will taze them, tie them to a chair and watch SuperNanny while they drool into the carpet.”
“Yes, Boss,” the driver responded, as if this was the normal course of conversation.  “Takes one to know one, is my experience, Boss.”
“You’re not,” Steve said. “You’re not—” he broke off.  Choked back the word.  He couldn’t say it.  It was true, of course, but he didn’t want to speak it out loud, like saying it was pulling the sheet off the mirror.  He couldn’t do it.  Not yet.
Steve held up his hands, fixing them flat, one on top of the other with just a small space separating them, just in front of Tony’s face.  Warm, brown eyes shone through the slot between Steve’s hands. Eyes that once looked across a battlefield from next to him. Eyes that laughed over a campfire while working on some incomprehensible device.  Eyes that held panic and prayer as they demanded Steve breathe,
The Internet wasn’t offering much help in ideas for things Tony might like, so Steve thought through the things that had been in Tony’s room when he...well, when he snooped, he remembered with a stab of guilt.  He shouldn’t have invaded Tony’s privacy like that, though, all in all, recon on his Omega’s room seemed like the least of his offenses, all things considered.   If he was honest with himself, he knew what Tony liked the most, and that was being left alone and having nothing to do with Steve.  Apparently, anyway, he thought somewhat bitterly before he pushed the thought aside.  It wasn’t like any of this was Tony’s fault. He had agreed, true, but Steve was fairly certain he had just somehow managed to rise to the top of some list of bad alternatives in Tony’s mind.  He was also fairly certain that Tony wasn’t entirely wrong in his assessment.  Not that it mattered now. Tony was his, and he was Tony’s, even if Tony didn’t want him.  He could still be Tony’s in his head.
Steve wasn’t sure how long he sat there, his stomach twisted into knots, body thrumming with desire and hot, liquid shame, his thoughts tumbling over and over each other, but finally the tent flap was flung open and Tony stepped inside.
All of a sudden, he was coming in long, white streams that coated Steve’s face and neck and spattered his chest.  Steve’s eyes snapped shut, and his body jolted in surprise.  It was dripping down his face.  Across his lips.  He could taste it.  Smell the salty bitterness of it.  When he blinked his eyes open, flecks of Tony’s seed sprayed off.  A rivulet of it ran down his neck, under his collar.  Another thick clump of it clung to his cheek.
Steve saw Rhodes frown, though he obliged Tony quickly enough, bowing his leave and heading for the group of soldiers that had accompanied them from Lord Murdock’s garrison. Ross bowed, too, and made for the awning where his own soldiers waited, leaving just the two guards behind with them.
“So, Pepper and Rhodey loved your—our—idea about how to work the Board on the arc reactor project.  Pepper’s making graphs.  Rhodey’s going to find a guy from the Corps, but thinks it would be better if we somehow referenced the inherent superiority of the Air Force.  Admittedly, I’m not sure how that’s related, but you can’t say the guy doesn’t offer valuable input,” Tony announced as he made his way towards where Steve stood under the glass bus stop enclosure.
“Oh,” Steve responded quickly, focusing back on his cards.  “Okay, that—that makes sense.  Thanks, Nat.”  By the looks exchanged between everyone else at the table, Tony wasn’t the only one who heard the hint of disappointment in Steve’s voice.
“Kiss me,” Tony said again.  His eyes were bright, color riding high on his cheeks.  His breath smelled sweet, like too much liquor, but he was soft and warm and alive and
A guard opened the door and stepped back to allow them to pass.  The room was much the same as Steve remembered it from last night, though this time, he spared a moment to look around.  He had Lord Hammer’s chamber to compare it to, now, and this was…different.  Far more lavish in many ways, with its fine fabrics and beautifully done furnishings, but, Steve noticed, nothing was for show, the way Hammer’s room seemed designed to showcase whatever it was Hammer hoped to convince people of.   It was a chamber fit for a King, and, had he had anything of value, Steve would have bet that the King hadn’t chosen a single thing in there.  The antechamber, though, that told a different story, Steve thought as he followed Zola in that direction.   This was where the King lived.  You could see it in every corner and pile, in the way the walls hung with bits and pieces and tools of every sort Steve recognized and then some.
