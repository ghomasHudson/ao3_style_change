In a fit of anger at hearing Toni's name, Steve smashed the computer screen. He may be Captain America, but he was still human. "Shut up."
Toni found another grown and put it on backward to cover her butt. She inched to the door, trying to hear if someone was outside the door. She couldn't hear anything from the other side, but she wasn't sure. The silence could be because there was no one there or she just couldn't hear through the wall.
This is basically a bonus. Someone (Can't remember who) had asked for a Bucky POV, so I decided to give you want. I wasn't planning on writing an other BUCKY POV so soon, but here you go.
"It's 11 am," Toni tried to protest. How was he still in bed with her? How wasn't he foaming at the mouth trying to get out of bed? He didn't have a lazy bone in his body.
In his hand was a little black box, and he was holding it out to her. His hand was shaking a bit- something that she never thought she would ever see. "I just wanted to get you alone." He paused for a second. "Well… At first, I didn't know if I should do this, but…"
Did he just call her Lady Toni? Not only was Thor the only person who was allowed to call her that, she hated to be called Lady anything. Sure, she was a woman, but she was not a lady in any fashion. She was too ill-behaved and loud. "Why do you care?" she asked. She was unsure of what her dream was about or what it meant. Why would she dream about being pregnant?
A rush of anger boiled up in Steve at the thought of Hydra used his best friend's face to destroy Toni. Bucky would be rolling in his grave if he knew… his ice grave. Shit, he thought, as cruel, bloody images pop into his head. God, he couldn't handle this. He really wished Bucky was here. God, he just wanted Bucky to be alive and together be with Toni in the Tower. That idea didn't last long, the nightmare of the situation destroying it. There was this terrible, panic feeling in the pit of his stomach. When they got Tony back—not if, when-, would she be the same woman that he fell in love with? Would she be okay?
"Ms. Robot!" The genius from the future felt her eye twitch as she turned toward the direction of the voice.
She let out a laugh as she never had an overly protective father growing up, worried about her womanhood like other kids. "It means what it means," she said.
Unwilling to force her to remain in his arms, Steve's arms dropped to his side and allowed her to step away from himself. He hated to let her go, but he couldn't force her. It would just push her way, and he didn't want that. He had to let her think, and he could see how tired she was. He could see that something was wrong, even if she denied it. He could see that she was hurting. "Toni."
"My name is Toni and…" She paused as she thought about what she 'wanted to remember.' "And that's about it. I don't know who my family is, but I suspect they would've found me if I had any or if they cared. I remember a few things that I like and don't like." She shrugged. "…Not much if I think about it."
And a few moments later, she was really in love with his plan. At that exact moment, the windows in the lab shattered as zip lines were fired into the room, and seconds later, Rogers' man filled the room, engaging in a fight almost immediately. It was only a second later that Rogers broke free from the man holding him.
However, just as Steve didn't think could worse, Romanoff and Thor walked into the room, which caused the tension in the room to jump. At this rate, Steve would be surprised if a fight broke out, which wouldn't be any good. There was no doubt that a fight would take out half the ship and hurt a lot of people, Toni being one of them. That was something he wouldn't allow, even if she pissed him off.
Toni felt like she was on fire when she awoke. Her heart called for Steve as her soul cried, recalling the previous nightmare. She could never forget Barnes' face, drilling into like two lasers. Everything felt like she was being burn live. She was set a flame in the pit of hell, feeling like her insides was in a state of protest. God, she could feel the tears run down her face as she recalled Barnes's nasty words. All she wanted to do was hide in Steve's arms… if he still wanted her. All she could see was Steve standing next to Barnes, wishing for her death as if she was the devil himself.
Howard's eyebrow rose, his lip curled. "Did you forget the promise you made Barnes? You said you would do anything for him? I'm here to help you with that. Have you already gone back on your word?"
It's picture clear. It all makes sense now, and Tony leaves the room without another word. He doesn't need to burden them anymore than he has already. It was a mistake to come and see them.
With a deep breath, he reached for the bottom of his shirt and pulled it up and over his head. He didn't know when he had gotten used to sleeping without a shirt, because in his pre-serum days and the war, he never slept without a shirt, but now, he couldn't sleep with one on. Maybe it was because shirts felt constricting whenever he tossed and turned in the middle of night. He hated feeling constricted, held down.
Of course it made her weak. Nightmares were for people who had fears and fears made you weak. Nightmares where for people who didn't know how to control their emotions.
"Oh, yea? What does America smell like?" he asked, letting out a small chuckle. He glanced down at her, catching sight of the tags hanging from her neck. Granted he could only catch a few letters from them, he could tell she was wearing two sets and who they belonged to. It didn't take an idiot to know whose tags she was wearing, and he could feel his own heart race. He could make out his own name, but he also noticed Bucky's name, and it was like that that it all dawned on him. He felt his heart drop. She blamed herself for his death.
The Agent scouted closer to the Toni, who was now hunched over. "I don't think I had ever seen him like this. He isn't the type to sleep at a woman's bedside. You must be important to Howard."
She patted herself on the cheek before running her good hand through her messy hair. "Stupid hair." It was a mess and she had no way to fix it. "Maybe, I should just cut it all off," she told herself as she combed her hair with her hands. Pepper wouldn't be here to stop her. She eyed a pair of scissors at the end of the dresser, and after a few seconds of staring, she reached for them. She brought it to her hair, but she couldn't do it. Sure, she didn't care what her hair looked like, but she didn't want to slaughter it, which was what would happen if she cut it herself.
Steve could barely recall anything that Loki had said as he couldn't get Loki's eyes out of his mind. "I heard it." Steve glanced at Toni from the corner of his eyes. Never standing still, she had moved from the table and grabbed a bag of blueberries from somewhere. He wondered briefly where she got those from before he turned to Banner.
Jones and Dugan glanced at each other before they too headed to the door to chase after Steve. "I think we better go after him, Dum Dum," Jones said.
"Again, Rogers. What do you think is happening between us? Sure, you're a fine example of an ass, and I wouldn't mind a roll in the hay with you, but you seem like the clingy type, which is so not my type."
Natasha made a face. "I don't know about that. The truth is a matter of circumstances. It's not all things to all people all the time." She glanced forward, watching the road for a few seconds. "Besides, I have done much more on an assignment before." She turned to him, giving him a light wink. "That kiss was nothing."
Toni's eyes snapped open as she glanced up at the newcomer. In the darken park, she wasn't able to make out his face, but somehow, he looked familiar to her. She just couldn't place where she had seen his face before, but she knew him from somewhere. Even his voice was familiar. "What?" she uttered, looking at his out stretched arm.
He couldn't even think as he just stared off in disbelief. The honking cars or a crowd of loud people, who were staring at him, didn't draw his attention. None of that mattered to him. He couldn't get his head around what was going on, but he didn't get time to think as black cars circled him, blocking his escape. Even the cars were of nothing that he had ever seen before.
It touched her to hear that from Barnes, but she didn't need or that. What she needed was to get back to her time, and in order to do that, she needed to break into Stark Industries. She didn't have time to worry about her emotional state. Toni took the phone out of her pocket and stared at it. She closed her eyes as she slid down the wall and sat in the corner. Though she would deny it aggressively to anyone who asked, she was panicking. Tears poured from her eyes and she was having a hard time breathing.
"No, we needed someone to drive us. Nancy wouldn't let us leave without one, and I'll never disobey Nancy," Dugan stated, soft and sweetly.
"Director Fury wanted to speak with us about a theory." Natasha said as she handed the suitcases to Banner, who took them both and placed them on the desk.
Toni glanced between the three of them before her eyes rested on the door. "So you did take apart my device and took the core?" she said, slowly as she tried to calm herself as she said it.
Steve, who looks like he has ran an hundred miles, walks the long way around the bed to take a spot next to the stilled Bucky. "What's going on in your head?" he asks, putting a hand on Tony's knee. Tony doesn't answer and stares at the ground as he crowds near the head of the bed. "What jumpo do you have going on in there, Tony?"
Howard laughed, but Colonel made a face. "I don't know if anyone would be jealous," Phillips stated.
"Stop," she yelled herself as she took a step deeper into Steve's apartment. Just how she imagined it, the place was kept simple with only a few personal items. Besides a few pictures of his parents, Bucky, and her, there was no personal items. There was any color in this monotone room, which also gave it no personality. It was like he never moved in, only keeping what he needed to live. Toni could admit it that she enjoyed that fact, because that meant he didn't consider this place his home. This place was not his home.
Happy to change the subject, Steve spoke up first, "Weren't you going home? Can't you just use your home phone?"
And I know Howard and Maria died at the same time, but in my story, I am having die first. It is the push that pushes Howard over the edge.
"You better be there when I wake up," Tony says, turning deadly serious. "…I hate cold beds." He pauses for a second, wondering if he can say it. "But if…if you aren't-"
For a second, Tony is shocked by her tone, but he doesn't show it. "Everything suits me, and I mean everything," he says with a dirty smile.
It made him wonder why his handlers would want her as she was anything but discreet. What would make her a good Asset? She would definitely end up the chair more times than not, as there was no doubt that her mouth would anger the handlers. They would do whatever it took to beat it out of her…Though he supposed after it was beaten out of her, she would be a good Asset, providing must needed intel in a different fields…However, the idea of this woman becoming an asset like him didn't sit well with him. It brought out the same urge as before: to yank her from the crowd and drag her to some place safe—though he would probably have to face the Beefy Blond.
Shaking his head, Tony takes a deep breath and turns back to the device he's working on. He's working on a mother board, though he has been working on this damn thing for over an hour, and he can't see to focus. He only seems to be poking at the unfinished device. Literally, just poking. "Stupid," he utters again, feeling annoyed at his inability to do anything. He groans as he's unable to focus, and his anger takes over. Unable to do anything else, he just stabs the device.
There was a smile on Maya Hansen's face, as she sat in front of what Toni would call a hellhole of a work bench on a slightly higher level. That work bench looked like the rest of the room: a trash pit.
"She's awake," Schmidt stated. "I was worried that my soldiers had hurt you. We can't have that now."
Returning, Steve takes a deep breath as he walks back to the sofa with two bowls filled of different snacks. Stilled for a second, he eyes the left side of the sofa with a frown before he takes a seat. "Easy, Buck."
Dugan's hand tightened around his cane. "Careful. I don't think Captain Rogers is willing to share."
Needing some breathing room, she side stepped away. "How is not important," she replied, not having any interest in explaining what she was planning. "However, I do need the core back as well."
"We met before outside the theater. You were with that Rogers guy," he stated. He sounded bitter. "I still have no idea why they choose him for the project but I guess it doesn't matter now. He's just a poster boy." He waved a comic in her face. Even though she couldn't get a good look at it, she knew it was a Captain America comic.
However, if they love him, they would say it, right? Okay, they said it before when they were getting Tony to agree to a poly relationship, but they hadn't said it since. Was it mistake before? Did they not mean it? Did they learn that he isn't worth it? Or maybe, they didn't mean it? They never say those words around him, even if it's to each other, and he knows the Brooklyn Twins love each other, dearly and truly, but they don't say those words in front of him. They say those words to each other, when Tony isn't around, and he knows this because he has entered a room and come across them in mid-sentence. Granted, they don't even need to say it to each other, because he can see it in their eyes whenever they look at each other. It's like they're having eye sex, which he isn't a part of it.
Now, the rest of the avengers were fucked. Well besides Bruce and Steve. She would make sure her science buddy and heater were safe, killing anything that came close. Now, the rest of them be damned. Okay, Barton may last for a while. Men with arrows seemed to last long in a Zombie apocalypse, while Romanoff might not be as lucky. No, it wasn't because the Black Widow couldn't fight like the bad ass that she was, but she was a close combat kick ass spy, and that meant she would probably be bitten as she fought them off. Now, Steve was close range fighter as well, but he was-
"Hey!" Toni yelled, playing hurt as she punched him in the shoulder. "Take that back. That's not true, but you never know when I'll blow up the
Peggy took a deep breath before she started to walk away. "You brought him up." There was a long silence pause. "We do not have time to talk."
"It's Iron Patriot now," she mindlessly corrected, as she stared at a newspapers the boy had showed her earlier. Her heart stepped a beat as two photos stood out to her, though one was only due to its size. The other one was of Steve, who looked
As she was like him in many ways, he could've been a night owl like her, but when he didn't answer, she knew it wasn't him. He would've answered her… unless this was a prank. He wouldn't be pranking her, would he? The future version of her father would not... but the past Howard seemed totally capable of it. "Stark, if this is a joke, I'm going to hang you up by your toes, and leave you out to dry," she warned dangerously. "Stark!" There was still no answer, which was starting to worry her.
At first, Toni thought she was caught by Hill, as she stepped out, but the agent said nothing. She thought the Almighty Director would stop her, but he did not. Then she thought the deadly red head would've caught her or said
He gave her a long look as he stepped to the metal equipment cases of all different shapes. His fingers traced the Stark Industries logo on the top of the cases as if he was trying to memorize it. "Those names mean nothing to me, and if you agree, they will mean nothing to you as well," he said.
Toni thought to herself. She was okay with that, because she didn't want to befriend anyone, though it was already too late. She had already befriended Steve- no Rogers. As he was the Captain now, he was Rogers again to her. She had also befriended Barnes, but that was a lie as he had betrayed her to Salty. That still blew her mind.
He glanced back to his men, before he looked back to her. "We don't have time to get into this, but I refused to let you do this to yourself. I'm not an idiot no matter how often you insult me. I know
Toni shifted so she could glance up at her savior; it was Rogers, and the sight of him made her heart skip… She blinked. He looked different; he looked smaller. Since when did Captain America look like a shrimp? Was the pain really clouding her vision? She wasn't an idiot; she knew she had a concussion, because she had a hard time keeping her mind focus and her head was bleeding. The blood was a big clue. "R-Rogers," she struggled, "what h-happened to you? Y-you…are s-shrimp."
Toni shook her head. "Don't need to worry about little old me. Not like I don't already know," she uttered. Both allowed silence to fallen upon them again, and it wasn't until the rain stopped completely that Toni spoke again. "At least, you enjoyed it."
Phillips glanced back at the darken glass as if to communicate to the person on the other side. "Are you sure this person was following you?" he asked, turning back to Toni. "It could've been a random mugging."
She shivered in his arms as her nails dug into her palms. "T-thought…I saw…s-someone," she said, softly. Her voice was almost so soft that he could barely hear her.
Toni turned. "Next time you touched my ass, I will shove your foot up your ass," she hissed as she watched him wobbled away. Shaking her head, she turned to Steve, who had gotten to his feet. "Steve, are you okay?" she asked, reaching out to him. Steve stared at her hand before walking away. "What's wrong?" she asked.
"Excuse me?!" Toni hissed, huffing in anger. "I don't know the who the hell you think you are." At her boiling point, she reached for her phone. "But you can tell Pierce he can fuck himself."
Toni narrowed her eyes as she looked down at her huge, round belly in complete shock. She was indeed pregnant, and by the looks of it, she was seven or eight months. No wonder she couldn't keep up with Barnes as all she could do was waddle. How the hell did that happen? Who did she have to kill? She glanced back up, glaring at them. "Smartass," she muttered, looking between the two.
Sam looked alarmed. "So this entire time, Hydra was playing with her with a dead man?" He asked, his anger breaking though. "The fact that someone would do that is repulsive! They played with her like toy, breaking her with the face of a friend. God, if I can punch those Nazis in the face I would." He paused for a second, taking a deep breath. "I should've tried harder. I should've pushed harder. I knew she was showboating, and I just let her go."
The Captain wasn't lying as Barnes comes flying down into his lab with the plate of food in his hands. If the look could kill, the genius would be dead as this man is angry. His whole body is shaking. "Tony."
She jumped almost two feet into the air. "Holy shit fuck," she cursed as she turned to the person who called her name. Barnes, who stood a few feet away, looked like a lost puppy that needed a home and the look he was giving her felt like he was asking her for a home. "Barnes, this is not how you get a nickname."
Howard lifted up a metal suitcase that he was holding. "So what does this do that you want it so badly?" he asked as he set the case down on the table that Toni was sitting.
Barnes took a deep breath instead of speaking back because there was nothing he could say to Steve. It was no secret that Steve and he disagreed about things.
Bucky crossed to the door, as he wanted to check on the girl. She had been making weird sounds in there, which didn't sit well with him. "Many things, but you might not like the answer." Again there was a chuckle in his voice.
"Ah, there it is," she stated. Pepper, who seemed to be in a much better mood than when she left, smiled as she picked up the phone and placed it in her purse. She looked around the room, noticing the tension. "Is there something wrong?"
"Think highly of yourself, do you?" Howard asked, watching her as she mindlessly played with Rogers' and Barnes' tags.
Toni quickly back stepped inside and ran to her device, packing it into the case as fast as she could. She knew the first thing that she should've done was go find someone, but her device was her first priority. If she lost this device, she was beyond screwed. Plus, someone had to be watching her, since they knew she would be here alone and she couldn't risk going out into the open.
Slowly as not to break it, she detached the screen, which she would still use. Gently, she pulled out CPU, which she needed for the scanner. If she ruined that, there would be no way she could fix it in this time. After that, she took out the chipset and separated the rest of the pieces. She laid them out on the table.
Toni glanced up at Rumlow, whose first name was still a mystery; however, she couldn't keep her focus as her head bobbed again. Her eyes felt heavy, and she knew sleep would soon be on her no matter what she focused on. There was no keeping her awake, even if she wondered what the hell the S.T.R.I.K.E. patch on Rumlow's uniform meant.
"True," he replied, eyeing her from the corner of his eye. "Do you work out?" he asked, noting her well-fit body.
The footage had a time stamp on it, and that time stamp was correct. Bruce had watched it in real time, and he could tell the stamp was correct. So why was Toni messing with clock? He studied each time she changed it. It was always after the wave. What did that mean? Why did she think the time was behind?
The Asset shook his head as he turned from the cliff. He had other things to worry about, and this mind wandering wasn't going to get him anywhere. It would only slow him down, and besides, it was pointless. His sour feeling wasn't important, nor would it solve anything. There was only one thing that the Asset had to do and that was to find the Brunette, who took off somewhere in her suit. He also had to find her before his Handlers tracked him down, which wouldn't be too long.
Being in her suit felt amazing and for the first time in a long time, Toni felt free-in control. There was no one to tell her what to do or how to act, and she loved it. She
Toni didn't know how long she could be able to keep this up, considering she felt like death. Granted, they did drive into a tree going 60 miles per hour and she was lucky to be alive. She was going to be sore for a while…well that was if she made it. "Not now." She hissed. She didn't have the time for a petty party.
The Captain had jumped from many planes; it was nothing new to him. He wasn't afraid of the height; he wasn't afraid of falling. He usually didn't worry, but this time, he couldn't keep his mind off Toni. With her mouth, she could get in some deep trouble, and he was afraid of that now. There was no telling what would happen to her down there with Thor and Loki.
"What?" Clint said, giving him a smile. "He just seems a little cranky! Just look at him." He waved at Rogers.
Steve suddenly felt himself drowning in fear as a realization was fighting forward. It was just on the edge, ready to break through. Was this really happening? "HYDRA died with the Red Skull," he protested.
Steve smiles. "Sure, why not? They're usually cheery. I'm not in a mood for a depressing flick." His grip on Tony's waist and on Bucky's hand tightens.
that she didn't have any idea of what happened, and she still had no idea of what was going on. She had no idea of what Loki's plan was, though it was clear that he was up to no good. That man was never up to any good, and he would stab you in the back as soon as he could. Then, there was that weird life like dream she had about the S.T.R.I.K.E. team. Did it happen? Or was she just crazy? She was so exhausted that anything was possible. "Probably a few wires crossed, besides it wasn't too bad. Nothing happened, but I do wish that I would've bought some stock in some companies though."
She looks at him for a second, studying his body language. "You're lucky that's the worst of it. I'm amazed that your lungs didn't collapse," she says. "You need to rest as the Nanos can only do so much."
"You're flirting with me now?" she hissed. "You got some nerves." How could he be flirting with her after what he had done? Did he think she would be weak at the knees if he flirted with her? "And I can take care of myself!"
Grabbing the items of clothing, he stepped to Toni and kneeled in front of her. "Let's get you out of these wet clothes," he said, setting the items back down. He expected her to say something, to do something, but she didn't. She just let him pull the towel from her shoulders. Taking her silence as the okay to continue, his hands dropped to her feet and he pulled off her shoes without bothering to untie them. He pulled off her wet socks a second later.
As if nothing happened, Toni was sitting crossed legged on a different large sofa. A huge bowl of popcorn was in her lap, and she refused to share it with anyone. "Have any of you seen
Toni laughed, because it was completely ridicules. How could she like the asshole Captain Rogers? She couldn't even stand him. Though the shrimp Steve was sweet, he was Captain America now, which made him an ass. "I think you're crazy," she replied. "Why would I like him?"
Howard's eyes widened. "No," he protested. "Never! I'm never letting you out of my sight." He reached for Toni and pulled her toward him into a hug.
The genius groans. "Are my babies worried about their papa?" he asks, knowing Vision isn't exactly one of his creations, but he's close enough. "I'm fine."
Leaning closer, his lips were inches from her, and it took all he had not to kiss her right then. "That doesn't scare me," he said. "There's nothing you can do to scare me away, and I'll be positive for the both of us."
"Yes, Boss," the AI replies. "They have caused my creator distress, so it is only logical to protect for you."
From someone with years in the spot light, Pierce had this charmed about him. "The honor is mine, Captain. My father served in the 101st. Come on in."
"Is she okay?" Rogers asked, Toni knowing his voice from anywhere. If she didn't know any better, he sound worried, but he didn't have a right since he was too busy kissing Loud Mouth Sassy Pants. There was something else in his tone that Toni couldn't place.
Toni's eye twitched as she turned back to him. Ignoring the fact that he had lifted her spirits in the matter of seconds, she was glaring at him. "Don't you dare!" she said, turning back to him.
The idea of Toni leaving the Tower and heading to Malibu didn't sit well with him at all. Yes, he knew she had a house there, and stayed there a lot throughout the year, but he didn't want her to leave like this. Without another word, he made his way over to Toni, who looked up as she heard his feet steps. Their eyes met, and no one said anything for a while.
He was an asset, and he wasn't supposed to feel, just kill without question, but yet, here he was feeling. He wasn't supposed to feel as it made his weak, but he was feeling, which annoyed him. He was a weapon, a tool to use, and he couldn't doing that if he was feeling. Emotions were the enemies, and they needed to be destroyed. He could kill the Brunette to do so as she was the cause of them, but the idea of killing her didn't sit well with him. It stole his very breath at the thought her dead. He didn't know why, didn't know much besides the fact that he couldn't kill her.
Slamming the case shut, she turned back to the entrance, knowing she had to do something. However, when she turned back to the flap, she noticed someone standing there, watching her, and it wasn't a friend.
Toni narrowed her eyes as she picked up the file. She let out a loud pitch laugh as she read it, because it was the funniest shit on the planet. It had her listed as a solder in the Army. "A Corporal? Really?" She couldn't keep the laugher in. "Why can't I be a Captain? No fair, Salty," she teased as she stuck out her tongue.
was what she was feeling. She did know it hurt like hell when he left. God, what kind of woman had never been in love before? "What are you trying to say?"
Barnes tilted his head to the side, his eyes scanning her entire body. He looked different from the last time Toni had seen him, though just as cruel as ever. This time, he wore black from the neck down, almost like he was about to go on a cover ops mission. "You haven't been punished yet."
Steve put on his Captain's face as he took a step forward. There was a change in his stance and posture as he put himself between the room and Toni. "Guys," he called.
in the side. Without a doubt, there would be a mark the next morning in that spot. "Look." It was a harsh order, and her tone was anything but friendly.
"You don't remember?" Maya asked, though she knew Toni was lying. However, her eyes were still glued to the tags.
Anyhow, I hoped you enjoyed this chapter and poor Toni, she is all confused. She doesn't know what's she feeling.
Pepper stepped forward. "I have seen how hard you have been working to locate Toni, and I know you have been giving it your all, but you need to rest. How do you think Toni will react if you worked yourself to death?" Her voice was sweet and soft like a mother's voice.
that there was nothing that she could. What was the point of being super smart and rich if she couldn't save one of the most important people in her life? Yes, she made sure that Peggy was well taken care of—which Peggy's kids and grandkids were extremely grateful for-, but it still felt like she was letting the amazing woman down.
"Just kill me then," Toni retorted. It would make it so much easier if she was dead. She wouldn't have to worry about getting back to the future and she wouldn't have to worry about accidently changing the future.
"Impossible, Tashie. No beats me." Toni let out a chuckling sigh as she dropped down to her knees, reaching back into the box. With a deep breath, she reached into the box, as she wondered where these bulbs came from. They didn't look new, but she hadn't seen these decorations before; however, that wasn't saying much. She owned a lot of things she didn't know about. "Why don't we decorate this stupid green thing?"
"You'll come around," he replied as he looked down at the journal. He flipped a page. "I expect more guts spilling in here, Stark." He flipped to another page. "All I see is possible ways to fix your device, historical counts of your days' events, and massive guilt. No mention of love. So sad." He glanced up at her with another creepy smile.
"And how did you know my name?" he asked, remembering her calling out to him. Taking a deep breath, he shook the memory as it was pointless. He would probably never see her again.
"And where are your shoes?" Carter asked, stepping toward her. She had a look of pity in her eyes that Toni didn't like.
Toni couldn't help but feel that there was more to this, but she pushed it away for now. To be honest, she wasn't sure she could trust herself at the moment. She was seeing ghost and panicking in the hallway like a crazy person. Her judgment was off to say the least. "And the nurse's uniform?" she said, giving Sharon a once over. The woman was once again in a Nurse's uniform. What was the point? Toni knew the truth. She didn't need the show. "And why that? You could've been anything. I would've picked a race car driver, but hey, that's me." A small smile formed on the genius' face. "And does this undercover work require you to change adult diapers. And give baths to creepy man. Because man, sucks to be you." With the blanket still around her, she kicked her feet over the edge and got up.
Was that worry in his voice? When did he start caring about her personal wellbeing? Didn't he infer that she was selfish earlier? Why did he change his tone? "I can just order in. Burger King sounds good."
She stopped suddenly and turned to him. "I, Toni Stark, do not get scared," she snapped rapidly. It took her a few seconds to realize what she had just said. Maybe, he won't notice, she prayed to herself, but she wasn't that lucky.
"It isn't a weapon," Toni replied, bitterly. She would protest that until she was blue in the face. "And it's mine. How is it a crime to steal my own shit?"
"You know after the Stark Expo when Steve noticed you were gone, he were frantic and went looking for you. It took me a while to get him to come back to the apartment," Barnes admitted as he followed her out. "I know he was still looking when I left him."
Toni let out a heavy sigh. Leave it to Steve to explain what happened, leaving out the juicy parts. That man was so much more than that. He was a deadly assassin, who was- for lack of a better word- missing a few screws in his head, though he could still kill you from a mile away. Yes, that metal arm was impressive, and she just wanted to explore every inch of it if she ever got her hands on it. "If I didn't know any better, I would say he was Super Soldier strong. He tossed the Iron Man suit like it was nothing." The idea still pissed her off. Eye twitching, she could remember how it felt when he tossed into a wall. It didn't feel good.
"Yea, it's me, Toni. Are you okay?" he replied, keeping a firm grip on her. "Where were you?" he asked softly.
not being kidnapped again. One, she was not a kid. So adult-Napped? And two, she was Toni Fucken Stark, and she did not get Adult-napped. She did
Toni turned to him, realizing that she met him before, but what was his name? She knew it started with a g. "How'd you guess?" she asked, as she looked away, still scanning the area. "Yea, I so can't sleep." She puffed. When he laughed, his name came back to her. "Gabe, right?" she asked.
She pushed herself onto her knees and stared at the photos on the bed. She needed to get the device as she had to get it away from her father, who could be screwing it up. He would figure it out sooner or later because of who he was. Sure, she had invented more items than he, but if he was in living in her time, there was no doubt that he would be taking her to school. And she hated that.
"You shouldn't speak. We just took the feeding tube out," the nurse responded as she took the glass from Toni and made her lay back down.
It wasn't until a few seconds later that Rogers spoke. "I had some ideas about the uniform," he stated slowly, handing something to Howard.
Toni stared at the woman, who came in with a needle. What the fuck was she wearing? It appeared to be a 1940's something nurse's uniform, which consisted of a white dress with an ugly collar and sleeves and a light blue sweater. "What are you wearing?" She asked. No present day nurse would wear that shit and she knew damn sure SHIELD didn't have facilities like this, noticing how old the room looked like.
"When I first joined SHIELD, I thought it was going straight. But I guess I just traded in the KGB for HYDRA. I thought I knew whose lies I was telling, but I guess I can't tell the difference anymore." He vague heard Natasha uttered.
"Too close to what?" Toni hated when people didn't get to the point and side stepped. Why couldn't he just say what he was thinking?
Looking back at the dismembered body, the Asset knew his handlers would not be pleased at this. They would not be pleased at all. This dead body would create and draw too much attention, and his handlers would be angry. They would most likely punish him, forcing him back into the chair. They would take away all of that made him human, though he couldn't consider himself human in the first place. He was a tool for murder, which was what he had done and would do.
Tony's brain is in overdrive, and nothing is making sense. He looks up to Steve as he leans into Bucky's chest, losing the urge to fight. He isn't sure what to make of everything. "I don't understand."
Toni couldn't help but find this whole situation funny, because who would've thought that was possible. "And how would you not?" she replied. "I am awesome."
Sure, Pepper had forced Christmas on her in the past, but she hadn't a real tree in ages. She had almost forgotten what a real tree smelled like, and if she thought about it, it almost made her sick. "There's needles everywhere," she complained as she pushed out of Steve's arms.
Steve calls out. There's something in his voice. He sounds worried, but there's something else in his voice like he's been caught with a hand in the cookie jar.
"Fury gave it to you. Why?" Natasha replied, her voice laced with confusion. As if to take the whole picture in, she took a small step back, putting herself fully against the wall. Her eyes scanned him, trying to get a read.
I would like to mention that Marvel is blowing me mind. I also think that Marvel's plan is to take all of the actors and don't leave DC with any to choose from.
"Toni," she started, slowly. "You've to get out of the lab sometimes. You've been down here far too much." She walked to Toni's side, placing a hand on her shoulder. She leaned down a little. "Come eat."
"Then what do you want to watch?" Steve asks as he sets two large bowls of popcorn on the table. Knowing how much the Avengers eat, it probably won't be enough.
Ever since the first nightmare, she hadn't been able to forget his face, and every time she tried to sleep, he was there with those piercingly cold eyes, which frightened and overwhelmed her with guilt. She couldn't rest with her remorseful conscience, only getting a few hours a sleep a night. She had lost count how many nightmares that she had since Bucky had died, but it was the third since Rogers went down. However, it was the first time that she dreamed of Rogers, and it knocked the air from her lungs. Even if Rogers and she fought all of the time, she couldn't deal with him hating her, but it was her fault. Once she got back to her time, she didn't know how or if she could face him.
. I love you and Bucky. I've always loved the two of you; I was screwed the second I saw the both of you, and I knew it. It's love at first sight."
Though she liked Peggy, it worried her. "Is that a good idea, Salty?" His eye twitched at the name. "I did almost shoot her the last time we met."
that felt. Struggling to take a deep breath, she rejected the idea of the Tower as home. The Tower was where she lived, but when she thought of home, the tower wasn't it. The Tower felt empty. When JARVIS said the Tower, it felt like she was punched in the stomach, letting the air out of her. Surprising even her, she wanted to go nowhere else. "Take me to Steve, take me home."
Toni tightened her jaw as she watched him pick up the tool and play with it. It turned out that it wasn't just a scoop as he squeezed it. She wasn't sure if he was going to use it on her, but she didn't like how easily he flipped in his hands.
Steve glanced around, noticing a few eyes on him. He wondered briefly if they knew who he was. "I didn't mean to insult you, Director Fury," he said. "The file that I'm looking for wasn't included in the case."
Taking a deep breath, Toni rubbed as much of the grease and oil off her hands as possible. She tried to clear her head as she focused on the dark spots on her hands. Like most engineers, her hands were almost always covered in some kind of oil or dirt; it was normal for her. In fact, it was one the few things that calmed her, even with all the nightmares. It was probably why she couldn't stop building suits.
Toni blew out slowly, not sure what she should do. She could change the future by going out on this mission, but at the same time, she couldn't risk her father's death. Her father had been very involved with the SSR, but she was sure that he didn't go out into the field. He didn't get his hand dirty. "I can go. Nothing to lose."
"Calm down? We're trusting a murderer!" Steve yelled, so annoyed that they or SHIELD could dare ask Loki for help. That was no doubt in his mind that Loki would betray them as soon as he could. "What-"
The Asset's knowledge may be limited as he was only given mission specific knowledge, but he was not stupid. He knew everything that he could know about weapons and technical assaults. He knew how and when the best time to strike was; he knew and could use hundreds of different kinds of weapons, without a single misstep. He knew how to make his own bullets and he knew how to make his own weapons if needed. He could silent a target without making a sound; he could survive in the wilds for weeks without an issue. He could do it all, while massacring an entire army.
"JARVIS, are getting this?" Toni asked, forcing her inventor side down. Now was not the time to be drooling over a metal arm, especially when that man was attacking Steve. However, she
After dusting himself off, Barnes rubbed the spot that Toni decked him with the gun. He could already feel the black eye coming on. "I just wanted to make sure you were okay."
There was something about his voice that smoothed her, and she leaned in closer to him, laying against him. "Don't lie. I always worry you," she corrected. She loved the way he smelled.
Wilson let out a chucking sign. "I don't know if Barnes has the legs for that, and I really don't want to find out."
"I had read my father's will," she replied, coldly. It was the first thing she did, when she had learned of her father's death. It had been callous of her, but she had to learn what had happened to his company. At that age, there was a part of her that wanted nothing to do with it, but there was a different other part of her that wanted to best her father at every turn. "Everything he had was already divided out
He had no idea why these words came back to him or what it might as he had no idea where they came from, but they came flooding back as he watched that man try to touch
Toni glanced back at Rogers for a second before spinning back to Barnes. "I don't want to talk about Skully either," she stated. She had talked about that man enough, and she didn't want to give him any more power than he already had.
Why couldn't she go back to the time before the reactor, before the Iron Man suit and just be that egoist bitch that she was before?
PLEASE DON'T KILL ME. I had heard you all about Howard, but there was no way that I could keep him alive without changing Toni. I will miss him too. :(
There were a few things running the genius' head after hearing that. One, that send chills down her spine. Two, why did Russian sound scary? Seriously, he could be saying he brought roses and it would sound scary. Also, what the hell? He wouldn't hurt her? Why would he say such a thing to her? That was very stalky, if you asked her, and flashing back to WW2, it sent shivers down her shine. It brought up memories she didn't want to recall. Was that why he waited to shoot?
After unlocking the door, Roger pushed the door open and walked in. Toni followed in after him and shocked at the state of apartment. "This is…nice." She wasn't expecting this from Rogers.
Whoever that is, Tony knows he won't make life easy for anyone. But again, he's out before he can put too much stock into it.
"I wouldn't say impressive. Maybe, you should check your dictionary," the Colonel replied as she turned to her. "She's a criminal."
He chuckled. "I thought you didn't want me to baby you," he said, stepping away from Rogers with Toni in his arms.
The Asset jerked in his chair, but there was no give. He was a tool, but he refused to let her be a tool. She was so much more than that. So much more.
"Shouldn't you be resting?" Rogers asked as he turned back to her. His eyes flashed to her bruise which had turned into a darker shade of purple and blue, a sign it was healing.
There's a reason why he's okay with the Avengers believing that. For one, he's too damn old for this shit, and he has no interest in them knowing the truth. Besides, if they do, it will only cause trouble and drama, and
Toni laughed at that, drawing the Captain's attention. That was one thing that never changed about him; he never knew how to talk to a woman.
"She wouldn't have shot at you for nothing!" She gave him a knowing smile. "C'mon, I can help you!" She held her hands together and gave him the biggest smile ever. "You can't turn this smile down!"
Toni didn't stop running, but she couldn't stop herself from looking back. She really wished she hadn't, as Barnes' eyes cut through her like she was butter. She thought his voice was bad enough, but it felt like she was looking at the devil himself. She could feel her panic take over, see his battered, broken form. It was a nightmare that she would never be able to rid herself of. Her very soul sobbed at the sight of him, and like that, all hope was gone.
Again, why couldn't people just drop this? Besides, he wasn't upset about Toni taking her time…well, not really…Not a lot. He would be lying if he said it didn't hurt. It did but he understood, or he tried to. He just didn't like everyone poking fun at it. He didn't like everyone talking about it like it was a joke. It wasn't. "I am not."
He smiled. "Looks who calling the kettle black," he replied as he crossed to the device on the table.
When his dreams came back to him, his desires came to life and all he thought about was her. All he thought about was righting that wrong; sure, Phillips was right then, but now, he was wrong. When he awoke and he would wake up, he would find Toni and he would kiss her like she had never been kissed before. She needed to know how he felt.
"Yea, I just need an impossible power source, which I'll never find or get." He paused, eyeing him. "Calm down," Bruce ordered, seeing that the Captain was going to do something that he wouldn't like.
Rhodes put his hands up as if to show he was surrendering to her. "I did," he replied, "It's just harder than I thought. She wasn't at any of her normal haunts, and I can't figure out where she went. I thought…well, hoped that-"
hiding…though he knows that's a lie. He just doesn't want to admit that he's hiding, even if he can't deny it. He
There it was. That stupid voice that he always had whenever he gave her orders; it was the same voice that he had in the future, where she wanted to kill him. It was probably a blessing that he was interested in Sassy Pants and not her, because she didn't want to be responsible for killing Captain America, which she would do if they were together. "Uncalled? Everything I say is uncalled for! It's my middle name," she yelled. "Which is why I don't have or
Reaching for the oversize shirt that he had grabbed, Steve dropped the towel. He held the shirt in his hand for a second as he took in Toni's every curve, putting it to memory. He might need to put it to paper later, though the very thought brought a bright red to his face. Shaking his head and shifting again, Steve tapped her arms to prompt her to lift her arms. He could feel her breath on him as he left the shirt over her head.
"You're going to get yourself killed at this rate!" Pepper yelled, still not moving. She looked too angry to move.
"You're hurting me," she said, hoping that it would get him to put her down. "Don't make me beat you."
Steve made a face at swearing, which he always did when she cursed. He wasn't a big fan of her cussing. "I'm an elephant," he stated. "And you're just bad at this game."
At first, the order annoyed Steve as he didn't need to be told that, but he knew he was being silly. Like him, everyone was worried about Toni, and it was understandable how protective they were being. It really was, but there was something inside of him that balked at the idea. He had no idea as to why, but what he did know was that he needed to get Toni to bed.
"No way in hell would I go out with a jerk like you," she stated getting in his face. "Why don't you get lost before I make you cry?"
"Shut it," Barton ordered. "I agree with Pepper. Let's change the subject." He lowered his voice. Toni inched closer to the door, because he was still talking. She wanted to hear what he was saying, but she couldn't make it out. Why would he lower his voice? Did they know she was listening?
She shuddered in disgust. Why was this happening to her? Why did every person that she ever met want to sleep with her? She got that she was a sexy god but this was ridicules. "Just leave me alone in my guilt."
Toni cracked her hands as this was nothing. She could hack anything. With a smile, she started typing away, and not even a minute later, she was in. Everything in the hydra's system started to flow into the device. She slide out and pushed herself up. "Anything?" she asked as she stepped to him. "It'll take a few minutes for it to copy."
Barnes waved it off. "That's who he is. He's a perfect gentleman, while I'm the bad guy." Again, he was smiling.
looking for an anchor. He was looking for Toni, though he didn't know if this 'Toni Stark' would be helpful. Why would she be?
Toni stared at the watch on her wrist; she had set the clock to match her watch, which she could swear by. "Are you sure?" She pulled out her cellphone from her jean pocket and switched it on. When the screen lit up, she noticed the time stamp. It was an hour behind her watch. "Interesting."
Taking a deep breath, she tried to ignore the growing pain in her ankle. She had pushed herself too much by all of this standing, but she didn't want to show it. She wanted to listen to Steve as he talked about his past. She wanted to hear stories about this childhood. "So what did your snappy brain come up with?"
Peggy let out a sigh, letting the brunette slip out of her grip. "You should be resting. You need to. Neither Barnes or Steve would want you to go on like this."
Steve still hadn't made his mind up about Fury just yet, but his words struck him and he listed to the man as he talked about the threat to the Earth's safety. Even if he didn't trust Fury, he couldn't let Loki get away with his evil plans, not with Toni's life in danger. She may never know how he felt, but he was going to protect her.
As he opened the door for her, she narrowed her eyes at him. "You're leaving in three days. I think he would notice you disappearing."
She knew what he was feeling. "Is there a point where you're going to give up?" she asked. She knew he had already tried to enlist a few times, but each time, he was turned down. "The odds are against you."
He couldn't help but laugh as he placed a hand under her legs and picked her up, holding her bride style. "Well, of course," he replied, as she rested her head against his shoulder. "But I require payment."
Once again, she was staring at his back and it so frustrated her. Why did he have to be like this? And people thought she was stubborn. "Fine, Steve," she stated, looking away from him.
"Yes, just a book," she stated, looking past him toward the entrance of the plane, where she noticed a few people boarding. Though she knew it was stupid, she couldn't help but look for Barnes as the Commandos entered and it was a blow to the heart when he didn't appear. Even now, it was hard to believe that he was dead and she had to keep reminding herself that he was and there was no changing that fact.
He could help the blush that was forming on his face. "What do you think?" he asked, closing the distance between them. Toni wrapped arms around his neck, pulling herself flat against him. Her lips felt salty, mostly from her tears, but she still tasted sweet. He knew he would never get enough.
You're overreacting, she told herself as she stood outside of the bar in the cold. Temperatures had dropped by at least 20 degrees and Toni could see her breath, but she had no interesting of going back inside. Not even the call of the Alcohol could get her back inside, and it wasn't because of the Howling Commandos or the catcalling pigs. It was because of the guy who asked her to dance. Ignoring her gut which could've been the alcohol talking, she agreed. The man was a good dancer who kept his hands where they belonged, but there was something wrong. She could feel it.
Toni closed her eyes, taking in a few deep breath. That was what she was going to do, which meant that she needed to finish the damn suit… And she
"As you wish, and I must say that would be wise. Tensions are on the rise. Colonel Rhodes and Agent Baron are seconds away from a fist fight, Miss." JARVIS replied.
"Boss," FRIDAY says, while Dum-E hums. "Dum-E has been on the internet again and has become fascinated in-"
Toni froze, recognizing that voice. It was that assassin from the alley, and as hard as she tried, she couldn't stop herself from flashing back to that moment. "You got to be kidding me," she moaned. How the fuck did this happen? How was she this unlucky? How did someone hate her this much? Unless, they were working together. Shit. Mother Fucking shit. Could someone just kill her now?
"Get away from her!" A voice growled, startling Toni, who knew the voice from anywhere. She could hear him struggle as he tried to fight his way toward her.
There was a lot of things that Toni wished for, and one was to be in her own bed with sleeping pills and maybe drowning them with tequila, but she knew that wasn't going to happen any time soon. "Cut to the chase," she snapped.
"What?!" Tony yells, his hands balling. Where the hell was he doing these times? How didn't he know? "Show me each time," he orders, leaning toward the monitor. He does not like the fact that Rogers had put him to bed over 15 times.
When Natasha narrowed her eyes just right, it was like she was looking right through you, and it was the look she was giving Pepper right now. If looks could kill, everyone would be dead from that stare. The master assassin looked angry, granted she always looked angry. "His access to the Mark 7 has been revoked."
"I can see it in her face," Clint said, holding the glass close to his lips. His eyes were narrow as he stared at her.
"T-that's creepy when you say it like t-that," she replied as she was fighting to stay awake. Her eyelids felt like they weighted a tone.
Steve gave the girl a soft smile. "Sorry about that," he said, gently. "Are you ready to order, Toni?"
Why couldn't he drop this? "We don't have time for this," she said, harshly. "We have to save the President." Why didn't he understand that they didn't have the time for this?
Toni smiled. "Wouldn't you like to know!" she laughed as she eyed the cards in everyone's hands. Pokers had been one of few fun things she had picked up from the boarding school that her father sent her. It had been how she had interacted with the other students, even if she didn't make any friends playing it.
However, with this new information about Steve's memory, there was something that he could do. Bruce had sent him out to draw and/or write everything that he could remember of those memories. If they could get a better idea of what was happening to Toni, there was a better shot that they could get her back.
Fighting the urge to look to see if they had an audience, Toni focused on Rhodes. "No, it isn't like that. I'm…" She started, though unable to finish. This wasn't a joke to her, but making jokes and insults was how she dealt with her pain. She doesn't know any other way. If she didn't laugh, she would cry and she didn't cry.
Toni had given that name as a cover up originally, and she had only given that name to one person: Barnes. She shook her head, because that wasn't possible. How could Barnes betray her to the Colonel? Did they even know each other? "Who told you that was my surname?"
She guessed she could always make up a song, which could be worse. "Bored, Bored, Bored. What's a girl to do when she is cold and bored!" she sung at the top of her lungs. It sounded like nails on a chalkboard. "They leave me alone for what seems like days, and I think I could freeze to death, but boredom would be my death!" She could feel her throat start to dry, but she knew if they were listening, they would be in soon. They wouldn't be able to take much more of her horrible singing. "Silence of Death is almost upon us!" she let it go. "Bored leads-"
Erskine picked up the pill bottle and put the cap back on. "Against popular belief, I do not hold the same ideals of Colonel Phillips." He stood up and picked up the clip board. "I don't believe you're a spy." He walked toward the door and stared back at her before leaving.
Toni turned her heavy head toward him and she stared shocked. She didn't realize that he was in the room; she had thought he had left with the crazy one. "He wants too much," she stated weakly.
Toni pushed out of his arms slightly and stared at him. For a few long seconds, the two were silent as they looked into the other eyes. "Okay, let's do this."
"And we can't send out Mr. Stark," Phillips stated as he turned to Toni. His eyes said it all. He needed her to do it.
Howard tightened his grip on Toni. "Physically, she will be fine. Emotionally, I'm not sure." There was a long pause. "When I found her, she was having a nightmare… It was about Barnes."
The words 'Poker Game' rang in her head, and she thought back to every single game she had played. There was only one that popped into her head. "Dugan, Jones, is that you? Geez, you two looked horrible. Time didn't do you two any favors."
Toni snorted. "And you want me to join you after you said that, Asshat." She wondered if she would turn out like these mindless idiots. She would rather die than be one these thing, because they weren't human anymore.
For the life of him, Rumlow couldn't understand why Pierce was so interested in Roger and Stark's relationship. Sure, it wouldn't work for their plan. For their plan to work, Stark had to be ready jump off a bridge—which they so close to that he could taste it. However, Pierce's interest was more than business. He wasn't quite sure why. "And SHIELD?" he asked.
Jim's eye twitches as the bot stops chasing him and returns to the door. Once again, Dum-E is standing guard with the fire extinguisher ready. "What the hell, Tony? Set your bots to kill me? Is FRIDAY going Skynet?"
"Is everything okay over here?" Barnes asked as he came running over from somewhere. He angrily eyed the unnamed solder.
When she opened her eyes, she noticed someone run past her. She glanced at the guy before turning back to the alley. "Who's he running from? I know it isn't Steve," she said. It only took her a few steps before she came upon a beaten up Steve and a fit Barnes in a uniform. After getting over the shock of seeing him alive, she looked him over. Just like any other woman, Toni loved a man in a uniform, and she was not against admitting that; however, this was not the time for that. "Barnes."
? She asked herself, looking around. She appeared to be in a hospital connected to many different tubes and wires, but she couldn't remember how she got there. The last thing she remembered was… Nothing. Shaking her head, Toni closed her eyes as she tried to remember, but it was all fuzzy.
Natasha narrowed her eyes as she stared at the screen. There was something spinning in the Assassin's head, as she listened to the news. "Some City Senator this time."
That wasn't what Toni wanted to hear, and it only scared her more. What if this didn't work out? What if she screwed this up? …Wait, who the hell was she kidding? She would mess it up. It was her after all. "Am I getting the shovel talk?" she asked. As she was a screw up and didn't do commitment, she never got the talk before. No one was stupid enough before Rogers to try a relationship to her. Serious, was Rogers stupid? "If so, you better make it good!"
"Seeing me tried up? Interesting?" She said, trying to play it cool. She did not like him this closer to her, especially when she couldn't do anything. And if he was behind the stalker, she really had no interest of being this close to him at all.
She took them off with no issue, but again, it was torture to put anything on. Her black boy short panties were easy to put on, but that couldn't be said about her black bra, which was fighting her. "Stupid bra," she cursed. She was able to clip it in the front, but it was the rotating that she was having an issue with. As she struggled, she felt against the bed, making a lot of noise.
"And you think I'm a hand full," she stated as she laid down. "I don't need a cupid, but if you want to return the favor, you can get me one of those hydra cores."
Toni sat up and leaned forward again. "I would hug you but I might get germs!" She had a smile, knowing that she would be getting that core, because Howard could not say no to the Colonel.
"No, you can finish that device," Steve countered. Nothing caring to clean up his mess, he stepped toward Bruce. His anger was clearly visible in his eyes.
Taking a step back, Tony's hand goes to his face as his eyes grow big. "I don't know what you're taking about, but in order to break up with someone, you have to be dating first. I was and am not dating the Brooklyn Twins." He ignores the twist in his stomach as he says it. Why does he want to put himself through so much pain? Why doesn't his heart know that pain will be only the outcome?
While glancing toward her father (who was a horrible supervisor), she pulled out her smart phone, which she had repurposed again. It had taken some time to convince Salty to give it back, but she was able to sweet talk him. Similar to before, it was a scanner and she could do a full diagnostic on any device. Though it wouldn't be as thorough as if Jarvis did it, it gave her some idea of what was wrong with it. Yes, the purpose of the device was to suck power, but it wasn't supposed to spit it back out with so much force.
Toni closed her eyes as the room cleared, leaving her alone with Steve. She wasn't sure what she was feeling at the moment, but she wasn't feeling all that great for sure. She still felt like it was roasting, and her mind was spinning. These stupid images wouldn't get the heck out of her head, and to make things worse, she wasn't sure what they meant, but they had to be true? Right? What else could it mean? If Rumlow really was there, why the hell did they leave her there? "What is S.T.R.I.K.E.?" she asked.
Sharon lowered her gun, though keeping it at her side. "Again, I heard screaming. I thought a little girl was getting murdered."
Clint nodded as he stepped out the door. "I'll hold you to that, Cap." With that, the Archer disappeared up the steps.
However, that didn't fix everything. There were times that he doubted her, unable to trust her completely. Like the Spy that Natasha was, she kept secrets, not revealing them unless she had to. Some of those didn't even have to be secrets, though Steve supposed that was a life of the Spy. "What's on it?" he demanded, pushing those thoughts aside. His mind bounced back to the thought he had a few seconds ago. Why was SHIELD treating him like a criminal? Like a threat? Why did they separate him from Toni? There was no doubt that was Rumlow's goal, but why?
Toni ran her hand through her messy hair, which she had to urge to rip out. "I was arrested and put in a cell for god knows how long," she explained as she looked up at him. "I would've said goodbye if I could've." She paused. "I'm sorry about that." She paused. "You should feel honored as I don't say sorry ever."
Honesty was one of Toni's biggest issues as it needed her to be honest with herself first, which was something she couldn't do. It would require her to admit she was weak, and she couldn't do that. Pluse, she never knew what was going on in her head in the first place, as she overthought herself into a hole. "Ain't I always?"
Taking a deep breath, she dropped her pencil in the book and closed it. She stared mindlessly for a few seconds before getting to her feet and turning to camp, which was empty again. Most of the camp was out fighting Hydra, while she was bored out of her mind. Even Sassy and Salty were gone. They weren't in the field like Rogers and the Commandos; instead, they were in a meeting with some big heads. Phillips didn't want to leave Toni alone in the camp, but he also didn't want to bring her with him. He didn't want her to meet them, not that Toni wanted to. She wasn't big on authority, and knowing how herself, she would probably say something stupid or rude or smart ass. However, Phillips didn't want to leave her here alone, hearing what happened with the Private. Toni wasn't sure how he heard, as she didn't tell anyone about it, but she could guess that it was Peggy, which annoyed her. She could handle that ass on her own, and besides, she doubted he would try anything else after the punch to the face.
This didn't feel like a game. He felt honest. "Never said I was." Shaking her head, she turned back to the Lincoln Memorial. No surprise, Barnes was gone.
Okay, Clint could guess to where the man had headed: back to the road. Did the man walk back in his steps with Toni in his arms? "Shit," he cursed as he turned back to the road. Before he could take a step, he noticed a red and gold phone buried halfway beneath the leaves. He lowered himself to the ground and picked it up. "Shit," he repeated, as he examined it. The phone was shattered, which spoke volumes. Toni had bragged to anyone who would listen how unbreakable her phone was; Steve even had a go at it. With a tear that Toni would deny, Steve did break it, but he had to put some force into it. So for her phone to look like this, there had to have been a super soldier here, and fuck, the bad guys had one. Did assholes really send a super soldier after a suit-less Toni? What the hell did they want with Toni that they had to a send a super soldier?
Let me know what you think. I think I am getting to emotionally, but then again, Hydra is driving her crazy, so...
look off his face, but the words wouldn't come out. They were glued in her throat, unable to break free. At the same time, she refused to say no. The notion made her face sick, so she was stuck without an answer for him. And every second without one, Steve's face fell. It looked like someone had ripped out his heart and stepped on it.
Though they weren't close, Toni knew that was a lie. Talked to Peggy on a regular basic (Shit, she loved that woman), she knew Sharon was no fucken Nurse. That woman probably didn't know how to work a needle. She was a spy, a spy working for fucking Fury. A Shield Agent…a Shield Agent that happened to live down the hall from Steve's and who was wearing a Nursing uniform. Why was there a shield Agent living down the hall from Steve, pretending to be a nurse? "So, I take it Steve doesn't know you're spying on him."
That was exactly it; he didn't think a woman could do it, but she knew it was a common belief in this time. At least, Salty believed in her. "You can't tell me what to do, Rogers."
"I'm surprised you didn't do that already," he replied with a smile. He wished she had, so it wouldn't have taken so long for them to find her. It had taken a few hours to track her down, as this had been the last place that he had looked for her, not expecting her to come here.
The genius didn't need any other reason to dislike—no, hate. She didn't need any reason to hate this nasty woman, but fate was giving her another reason to punch her lights out. "So you took Killian's card?!" Toni snapped, struggling with the zip ties that were digging into her flesh. Under the restraints, her skin was red and swore, though the pain was barely registering. Her intense anger was growing with each passing second, and no matter the strange feeling in her head, it didn't seem to be stopping any time soon.
Toni violently shook her head, trying to get Barnes' cruel voice out of her head. Why did it have to be him? Why did he have to be the one haunting her? Why it would be anyone else? Granted, she supposed she knew the answer to that. He was one of her greatest regrets. "Stop it," she yelled at herself, as she got to her feet. She needed to get out of here before she went crazy. With this nasty voice in her head, it was only a matter of time.
"Miss, I would advise against a battle at this point and time. The risk to the general public would be high."
"No. no," she croaked, stumbling forward. She landed hard on her face, her feet tangled in the vines beneath her. The more she struggled the more she became entangled in the vines and the more her panic begin to rise. Everything just hurt as her heart went to the races.
Rumlow grabbed her by her arms and started to stand up slowly. "Time to go," he said, looking off into the distance. His face was crunched in anger, but he didn't say anything else.
"Why don't you understand? I could've changed everything. I could've kept them alive. I could've told them." She closed her eyes as she felt her heart race. "Why don't you hate me?" she asked, as she leaned in to his touch. She couldn't understand why he was being so gentle and nice to her. "I hate me."
He yells at himself. He's acting like an idiot, unStark like. "Like something you see, Barton?" he asks, while smirking and taking a seat next to Natasha.
He put down his binoculars and turned to her. "Are we going to play that game?" he asked as he returned the binoculars to their pouch.
, not after everything that has happened. The idea that she can fool around in his head on a second notice scares the shit out of him; plus, he doesn't think he can take another one of her visions. "Allow what?" he asks with bitterness in his tone.
Steve let out a sigh from next to her as he eyed Romanoff manhandling the reporter. "You'll be deleting those photos," the assassin ordered. "Deleting them, now!"
"He's gone." He looked down at his hands, which were balled. "I couldn't protect him like I couldn't protect you…" He glanced at her before looking back at his hands. "I failed… again. I thought I lost you too."
Biting down on her lip, she forced herself quiet—which was harder than it should've been-, as she turned her attention back to the issue at hand. Her anger flared as she remembered why. Yes, she knew that Clint had a point, a valid point; plus, she was really angry at herself. She was the ass seeing things. She knew she shouldn't take it out on everyone else, but she had no self-control in this sleepless state, not that she had any control period. "Well, don't miss," she replied, catching sight of Rhodes leaving with the President. She could rest slightly at accomplishing their main goal.
That was the problem: she didn't want to talk. She couldn't. Starks weren't talker. "Rhodey," she replied, a warning in her tone.
"Ah," Toni uttered. There were parts of her that wanted to spoil the ending for Peggy, but she wouldn't play that card. She didn't need or want to play that card. Why in the hell would she want Rogers?
Dugan turned to him and gave him the look. "I know that look of yours and what you're planning, but you can't," he warned, taking a seat in a lone chair by a window. "She can't know she went to the past until she goes to the past. You can change everything if you go to her."
Toni waved him off. "I am peachy." She winked in pain again as she turned from him. "Why don't you get your team together?" she said, trying not to snap; however, her tone was pretty clear. She blamed it on the pain. Rogers looked like he wanted to say something, but he just walked away. Peggy followed him for a few steps before she turned back to Toni. Most of the room had cleared with him.
"And I love you and Steve," Bucky says, putting a finger under Tony's chin and lifting it up. "I don't know if I'd call it love at first sight as you both were- are idiots, who drove me up a wall. Seriously, you two drove me crazy at first, and I wanted to run in the other direction. So glad I didn't." His voice is raw and dry.
"Well, then don't look at it, and good." She stated at him for a few seconds before she turned to the door. "Now, let's go. I don't want anyone to think we're fonduing," she joked.
This was the point that she started to fight with herself, as she flashed back to all the times that she had thought she saw him. She didn't know why she kept fighting against the logic—against realty. Bucky
Toni wiggled as he held her tight against him. "Don't think like that. Why are you acting like this? We-" Before she could finished, Barnes smashed his lips against her and kissed her with everything that he had. At first, Toni didn't know what to make of it, and after she got over the shock of it, she was confused as to what to do. Did she kiss him back? Did she push him off? Why in the hell was she putting so much thought into a stupid kiss? She had never in her life put so much thought into a single kiss. It's because you care, she thought. She cared for him more than she wanted to admit. She cared for a lot of people that she didn't want to care about. Rogers, Barnes, Phillips, Peggy, the howling Commandos… All of them. Screw it. She leaned into him and kissed him hard.
Maybe she was a goddess or something which would explain why she looked so young. Maybe, she didn't age and Howard took her in to hide her identity. "Now, I'm going crazy," he told himself, shaking those thoughts out of his mind. He flipped a page and started at Toni's biography, hoping that would give him some answers. The word torture popped out at him, which reminded him of something that Toni told him before about being tortured.
He tried to ignore the tingle in his chest as his fingers danced along her skin. He could never get over how this woman made him feel. She made him feel alive in so many ways that he didn't know was possible. Just the mere thought of touching her got to him. "Shit," Steve cursed, lightly as he threw the wet hoodie to the ground. "Heavier than I thought." Still no respond from Toni. She hadn't said anything since the lounge, and this level of silence scared him.
The man he was staring down was aware of most of his history, his resume—the death trail that followed him, and wisely, he was shaking in his boots behind his expensive, wooden desk. The Asset didn't expect any other reaction out of the man as he had seen this reaction a hundred of times on his kills, and his handler at the moment, Rumlow, seemed pleased at this as well. He had this creepy smile on his face that could scare most people.
"I'm handy with a knife," He said. "Let's hurry. We have to get to the Data Center before they find that body, and it won't be long."
Looking through his wet, messy hair, the Asset stared at her though advoiding her eyes. He didn't want her to see his emotions, his pain. She would reject him if she saw the blood on his soul. He was tool, nothing more. However, pain flashed through his mind again as flashes started to appear in his head like before.
"Okay, so don't tell me!" Howard stated as he pushed himself off the table. His pouty face was funny and she could laugh at it all day. "I have things to do." With that, he left her alone to her pleasure.
Her eye twitched. "Not that bad? Have you tried working with him?" He looked at her. "Okay, Okay. I know you are now. But his ego just makes me want to puke."
Tony feels like he has been punched in the stomach. How did he misread everything? How did he think that they didn't want him? Can't love him? "I thought you didn't want me. I thought I was just some-"
"A mistake? Really?" she asked, trying to force that image out of her head. She hated how it felt to see them kissing, and she hated Steve for making her feel like that.
Steve lets out a sigh, as he placed a kiss to Toni's forehead. "It's hilarious." He lingered at Toni's side for a few seconds before walking over to Natasha's car. He glanced back to Toni as he got in.
Natasha gives them a look. "Well, Barnes only cooks for his fellas. He-" She pauses, meeting Tony's glares. "His words not mine. Then, there's the fact that Barnes keeps spending his time down here with you. I thought you were uncomfortable with him originally, but I guess that wasn't the case. Barnes was quite happy when he learned that."
"That smile doesn't count. You were giving them the Captain America Death stare. Granted, they should've died from that alone. Now, they would've melted against your puppy dog eyes."
"Easy, Bucky," Rogers stated, turning to Barnes. It was clear that he didn't like Barnes' tone. He turned back to Toni. "Toni, what happened? You had us worried."
Tony doesn't recall much besides extreme pain and isn't sure what's going on around him. He can only make out the shapes that flash in his vision, and he can't make out anything besides loud pounding sounds. He knows someone is speaking to him, well more like yelling, and this person is panicked, but he doesn't know what he or she is saying. He knows this should scare him, but Tony can't seem to focus enough to be worried; the pain is just too much.
Natasha sounds worried, and Tony doesn't like that. When she's worried—well when she shows it, it's never good. If she can't handle something, you know it's bad. Making sure the comm is on mute, the genius asks, "FRIDAY, how bad is it?"
Knowing he looks like an idiot, Tony waves them off. "Geez, you people make me feel so great about myself," he says, playing hurt. "No wonder I have low self-esteem."
Steve popped straight up, soak in sweat. He had that same nightmare many times before and it always felt real to him, but he wasn't sure if it was. There were so many past memories in his mind and it was hard to tell which was real or which was not. He hoped to hell that that memory wasn't real, because if something were to happen to her, he would die. "Maybe, Banner's right," he muttered to himself as he sat up on the couch, which he didn't remember falling asleep on. He had to give it to Toni, as she knew how to pick the most comfortable couches to sleep on. He hadn't been able to really sleep since Toni had disappeared, and he wasn't the only one.
Bucky turns to him ever so slowly with a scowl. "No, the Punk belongs here with us," he snaps. "He belongs right in this spot! Not with him!" he yells, waving at Rhodes.
"Um, thanks," Steve uttered, totally confused. Before he could ask for what, Killian disappeared out the door and down the hall. He eyed the hall for a second before he turned back to Toni. He gave her an odd look, taking a few steps toward her. "Am I missing something?"
Okay, yes. That was one reason, but it wasn't the only reason. She didn't want one night stands anymore, and even if it scared the shit out of her, she wanted a long term committed relationship with Steve. Even with all the disagreements, she wanted him to be the one she turned to, the one she woke up to with bed hair. Even if it was battle to get the words out, she wanted to tell him everything. She may not be able to get the words out all of the time, but it was something for her to want to talk to him. To want to open up.
want to sleep. She didn't want to go back to that dark place. She didn't want to be alone with her guilt. Being alone was too much.
"Yea, Wanda's idea," he says with a smile. There's a devilish look on Rhodes' face and it doesn't sit well with Tony. "She says she'll use her abilities on you if you don't get your pretty ass upstairs—No, she didn't use
Toni snorted, because she couldn't see herself working alongside her father; however, she couldn't rot in a cell. "I'll tell you everything in private."
Breathing heavily, she unsteadily got to her feet and turned from the ghost. She knew he wasn't there. Not really, but the look from Barnes cut her in half. Fighting a losing battle, she tried once more to push him out of her mind, as she reached for her phone. In her panic and her shaky, sweaty hands, it slipped from her grasp, which did nothing for her nerves. With each drop, it was harder to breath; she was gasping for air. Covered in sweat, it took her a few attempts to unlock the phone. Heart in her throat, she called Steve. "Come on," she begged; tears started to fall. "Steve," she cried as the phone went to voicemail. She knew it was a long shot, as he went radio silent when on assignment. Hearing his voicemail pick up, she ended the call forcefully, as she tried to force back the sheer panic raising inside her.
Toni raised her eyebrow at the sight of Steve and Barnes. Between a laughing Barnes, who looked ready to faint due to a lack of air, and a blood red Steve, who had never been on a date in his life (or even held hands with a woman), she didn't know which was funnier. "No, we weren't. We just went to see a movie together. Steve needed some cheering up." She glared. "But then he left me alone in the theater!"
"It's fine, Cap," she said, annoyed. He wasn't her parent, and he didn't need to treat her as a child.
Toni glanced around the room, looking for something that could help her, but she knew there wouldn't be anything. They had underestimated her the first time and she knew they weren't taking any chances now. They had locked her into a 10 by 8 ft. room and made sure that there was nothing in her arm's reach or even in the room that she could use. Across from her was a police style window, where she couldn't see through but they could see her. That pissed her off. She had been sitting in this freezing room with dim lights for hours, or what seemed like days, as they watched her. She knew they were waiting to see if they could break her, which was impossible. She wouldn't say anything.
She narrowed her eyes at him. "Are you flirting with me, Mr. Barnes?" she teased with a wink. If he wanted to play the flirting game with her, she would, and she would have him crying mercy.
Taking a deep breath, she turned back to the device. "What if I give this thing more power? The lack of power must be the reason why it isn't working. Everything should be working." She had to yell for JARVIS to hear her.
Jones and Dugan chuckled at her last question, though the Captain found it anything but amusing. "I am
He didn't have time to fight with her, when he didn't know if Toni was safe. Why did this all have to happen right now: Toni's freak out, SHIELD's betrayal, and Fury's death? Though he didn't want to believe it, he knew it couldn't be random. They had to be connected in some way, and didn't put him at ease. "Doesn't matter."
She turned to the bag that she spotted earlier and took a look inside. "What? Where did these come from?" she asked. There were a few different outfits in the bag for her, and to her dismay, there was no pants. There was one pot-a-dot dress, one grey dress, two blouses and one skirt. At the bottom of the bag, was a pair of black flats.
Toni knew he was correct and she was being stupid; however, she could help but think she was missing her shot by not going after Madame Hydra. She knew that woman knew something, but it was stupid to think she could get anything out of her. "I know," she said, exhaling slowly.
She took a deep breath as she held the dog tags close, refusing to let go. "I don't know what you're talking about. I am a great actress." Rogers were standing so close that she could feel his hot breath on her, and it drove her crazy.
"Maybe, you don't know your 'soldier' all too well," Toni hissed, turning away from Phillips. She still had the mental scars from that attack.
"He didn't mean to do that," she snapped, feeling the fight just draining from her. She just wanted it all to stop.
"You don't have to put it away. I can still work on it," Toni spoke as he watched him shut the case.
Toni's head was about to pop as she was having the migraine to end all migraines. The sheer pain of it was sending shivers down her spine. Plus, her legs felt like they were on fire. Everything in her body was screaming, fighting against her. Her body was hostile to her, trying to stop her in tracks. It was so great that it almost stopped her in tracks, but she didn't stop. She couldn't stop as she knew Rollins and his friends weren't too far behind her. If she stopped now, she was sure she was done for.
The genius knows he'll probably regret this all later, but he knows if he lets them in, it'll hurt so much more when they leave. "Good, and take that with you."
"We go-" The phone suddenly rang, echoing through the kitchen. Everyone froze at the sound of the loud ring, as if they were expecting it to explode. They were all expecting the worse, sitting on the edge. "Expecting a call?" Natasha asked, her eyes cold. Just like that, her mask was up and she was ready for a fight.
With a snicker, Steve gave him a look. "I was referring to cuddling, but I know where your mind is. I just mean Toni is a cuddle bug." He gave the man a smirk.
This man and the mad, insane woman had surprised Toni with their abilities, though nothing these days should. She was dating a super soldier and was best friends with a man with horrible anger management skills.
Barnes had lost track of time and what was happening to him, but he could tell that someone was standing over top of him. The shadow started to take shape after it had started to shake him. "It's me, Steve," the shadow stated.
When Toni came too, her ankle was throbbing, and the ice pack had long lost its coldness—though it had fallen off during the middle of the night in her twists and turns. However, Steve had remained close, holding her in his warm embrace. Even when they both had fallen into a deep sleep, Steve's grip on her hadn't died, and it was as strong as ever. The only thing that had shifted was Toni's position and Steve now spooning her.
She gave him a look, grinning. "Of course they did, Rogers, though I should be asking you that. I assumed in the 1940s that they told you babies fell from the sky. You know how it was in the 1940's. Sex is bad, and the devil will get your soul."
Toni wasn't an idiot, and she knew without it being said that she wasn't invited to the 'party'. Yes, she was insulted just on principle, but it wasn't like she really cared about their highly classified missions; though if she did, she could easily have hacked into SHIELD and find out. The Pirate wasn't as smart as he thought he was, and she could break in without breaking a sweat. Fury would like to think his security system was great, but nothing could stop her when her mind was made up. "Not a part of the boy band? Geez, tell me how you really feel."
However, the chest piece wasn't the only thing similar between them. He had seen the fear in both the present and past Toni, which most people missed. She didn't hide herself in her lab because she was lazy or selfish. She hid, because she didn't want anyone to notice how tired and exhausted she was. She didn't want anyone to see how worn out she was. She didn't want anyone to see that she had weaknesses, that she wasn't as strong as she portrayed herself. She refused to let anyone see that or let anyone in, which was clear by the lack of a personal touch in the Stark Tower. He had not seen one picture in this place, and there was no homey feeling in this place, well if he did not count the lab, where it was clear she had spent all of her time.
"We'll find Toni," Bucky spoke. He took the lead as Steve was filled with worry. He could see the doubt and worry in Steve's eyes, which was strange. Steve had never been the guy to run in fear, when he should have. There had been times that Steven should've run. He had gotten his ass kicked at many times because he wouldn't back down from a fight. He was an idiot at times.
"Big Sap." She let out a chuckle, as she reached up and placed her hands his wrists. "Fine, but it doesn't mean I'm letting you call the shots. I wear the pants in this relationships."
her! "Fuck," he said, slamming his fist down onto the table, which didn't stand a chance. It split into several pieces under his straight, crashing loudly to the ground.
Yes, the Asset forgot about her, but it didn't last. When he finally saw her in face to face, it came flooding back, and it was a struggle to obey his conditioning, his training. It was a struggle not to steal her away and disappear. They didn't speak, but his eyes were glued on her as his comrade held her, trying to awaken her. He couldn't look away, as he struggled to figure out why she was a trigger for him. Why did he want to kill his comrade for merely touching her? Why was he feeling anything at all? He was an asset. A tool. He wasn't supposed to feel. He wasn't supposed to care.
"I'm great." She put on the biggest smile that she could muster, but Peggy was still giving her a look. "I might've broken my hand on his fugly face, but I'm good. I swear." She flexed her hand to see how bad it was. The skin on her hand was cracked and it was bleeding slightly, but she was able to flex it. "Now, it matches my face," she stated as she brought it to her discolored face which was returning to its normal color.
With her shaking uncontrollably, it took a good few minutes for Toni to control herself. However, no matter how much time she gave herself, she was still shivering, even with the heavy (though not heavy enough) poncho. Stupid itchy poncho. "Fuck me," she cursed as she grabbed the payphone. Even in her frozen and annoyed state, she was amazed that there was even a working payphone, though she was thankful. She didn't know what she would've done if she hadn't come across it.
She stared at him for a few seconds. "Okay, I get it. I know," she said. "If I want to talk, I'll let you know, but don't count on it."
What did this woman do? What did she have on him? It wasn't pain like his handlers. Did she want to control him? Did she want to use him? Or was it something else? It didn't seem like she wanted to control him, but the Asset didn't know what else she could want with him, and it left him with questions. Questions, he couldn't answer. Questions, he wasn't used to, as he hadn't been awake long enough for questions to form. Plus, questions were considered unacceptable. He wasn't allowed to have questions. He was a weapon, and weapons did not think.
, she thought. She knew he would get in eventually, though she wasn't sure when that would be and how that would be. Her mind wandered a bit, as she thought about Captain America. How did the sweet little Steve turn into the asshole Captain Rogers? Was it the serum? It changed his body. Maybe, it changed his mind.
She took a look around the room, trying to see if there was anything that could record their conversion. She didn't want to anyone to know what she was going to say. Seeing nothing, she turned to him. "My last name is not Sark."
She hated how he said her name. "Then why in the hell did you kiss her?" she asked, snapping. "Why in the hell did you kiss
"SHIELD may have to check in on Miss Stark." He gave her a look before scanning the rest of the room. "Now, we must find Captain America. Be warned we might have to deal with an Iron Man." He lingered on the words Iron Man, stretching it out.
Working off muscle memory and increasing fear, Toni pushed herself and hit the release button on the suit and tumbled out. She hit the ground with a hard thump. The cold ground shocked her bit, forcing her back down to Earth. Like one of those movies, everything came rushing back at her. It was almost too much.
Barnes knew he had to be losing it; he had to have gone crazy. There was no way Steve was that big. The Steve he left at the apartment wasn't even half the size of the man in front of him. How could he have possibly gotten that big? If he believed in magic, he might've believed that Steve was a witch doctor of some kind. "I thought you were smaller," he finally said as Steve came into focus.
After she finished stuffing her things into her bag, Toni zipped it up and set it on the floor. "So you and Rogers, now?" she asked, changing the subject, though she didn't know if that topic was any better than the last.
"How are you functioning?" Bruce paused as he looked the dead tired Rogers over. "How did that mission go?"
The Colonel turned to Clint, giving him a look. "Toni didn't use the tie enough in college," he said. The pain looked was still on his face. "Could never tell when to trust it when she did."
for an unknown length of time. There were no time lines for SHIELD missions; no way to know when he was coming home. Was she going to be alone for Christmas? Again, that wasn't new to Toni, but that didn't mean she liked it. She was just used to it. "Did the government come to its senses? …Oh, wait. What am I talking about? The Government will never come to their sense. Bunches of idiots who can't agree on anything. 'Oh, look I am fire. What should I do? Use water? No! I can't agree with you, even if you're on fire. You're a—" She started to mock.
Behind her was the same female HYDRA soldier from before and she was holding the knife tightly against her neck. "So alone," she said, mocking her. "No one's going to help you." Toni knew it was a risk when she went out alone, but she had to, and it wasn't like she couldn't take care of herself, though now wasn't a good example.
Toni stared at him for a few seconds before looking away. "Just let go," she snapped, feeling something grow inside of her. She refused to call it a panic attack, but she felt it rise up inside of her. She didn't like the idea of someone touching her without her permission; no one had the right to touch her.
"I don't give a damn, Stark," he says. He's anything but happy as he sets the plate down in front of the genius. "If you're going to be a punk and stay down here all the damn time, you're going to eat whatever I put in front of you. You hear me?" He doesn't move from Tony as he remains at his side.
Had it really only been that long? "Only that long?" she asked with a smile. "I can do longer." Yes, she could stay up for longer, but she wasn't sure if that was something she could and should be proud of. "Focus up, gentlemen. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suit." She waved to her armors in front of her. She wasn't sure if this was alcohol talking or if she was just being over the top.
Wait, what? That took her by surprise, even if Bruce and she were close. "I would like to see that."
The Colonel let out a sigh as Stark was very annoying. "Let's get back to business," Phillips ordered. "I don't think it would be wise for you to speak with Toni."
Tony tries to hide himself deeper into Rhodey's chest, as Steve steps away from the glaring Bucky and the pouty Sam. The Super Soldier stops a few feet from Tony before he crouches down to get eye level with the mostly hidden Stark. The Captain is silent for a few seconds as he stares at the balled up genius, only able to make out his eyes. "How are you, Tony?" he asks, his voice shaky.
He chuckled again. "I didn't know how I didn't notice it before. Sure, you don't have my chin, but there's no mistaking those eyes, that noise. You're mine," he said. "My Daughter."
"I've been worse," Tony says, cutting her off. He doesn't want or need to hear the list of his injuries from her, not that he doesn't believe her; he just doesn't want to think about it at the moment. He doesn't want to think or look at the heavy, thick, black boot on his foot, and he wants to pretend the cast on his arm isn't there. He wants to ignore his injuries completely. He just wants to go back… Besides, FRIDAY could and will scan him later to tell him the full extent of his injures. With his AI, he doesn't have to worry about someone over or under selling his injuries; plus, he just wants this conversion over with as soon as possible, as he doesn't want to be in this room with the Brooklyn Twins waiting on the other side of the door. He doesn't want their fake pity or worry, which is all it is. He doesn't want them to stay with him out of some kind of honor. He isn't a charity chase. "Just let me out of this hell hole."
"What the hell is going on?" A guard asked, drawing Toni's focus. He was down the hall. She knew Loki and she had been talking loudly; it must've attracted some unwanted attention.
Toni shook her head as she got to her feet and turned to the window. Her eyes scanned over parking lot, though she wasn't sure what exactly she was looking for. She wasn't expecting anyone, not that there would be someone to expect. Steve was off doing god knows what with the Spy Twins; Bruce was in stupid New York, hidden away in the tower; Thor—not that she expected a visit from the god—was off planet doing Thor like things. Jim was off with the military somewhere, looking into these Mandarin attacks, while Toni was alone with her nightmares. No, she wasn't bitter. She was just exhausted, tired. All she wanted to do was sleep, but she couldn't. All she saw were ghosts, and they weren't the friendly kind.
It's the whiskey, she told herself as she took a few deeps breath. The alcohol was messing with her thought process, making her overreact. This was all in her head; she was imagining this all, which was what she did. She couldn't let herself be happy, not that she could really consider herself happy being stuck in the past, but she was in a better place than she usually was.
"Stark," Natasha answered, her eyes glued to Steve. Worried stretched across her face as she took in the super soldier. "We haven't been able to find her."
Steve's eyes soften. "You were in a coma if I remember correctly, Doll. I would like to see you try, but that's not the point. The point is if I can't blame myself, you can't. And again, Bucky wouldn't want you to. He would be stomping like a bull, going off about it."
Maybe, it was the way he said it, but she believed him. Believed that he would do whatever it took to make her his. But why?
It was taking Toni longer than she wanted to get out the control room, which infuriated her. The longer it took her to get out, the less likely she would be able to escape. At first, she didn't think the guard would leave, but he was radioed away when another guard couldn't turn the alarm off.
Toni was not in the mood to be babied, especially not from these two. Barnes had just died and they were making out.
The name was vaguely familiar, and she knew she had met him before, but she had no idea of where or when. If she was being honest—which she always was, that was telling in and of itself. "Aldrich, really? Never picture you as one of those. Were you teased as a child? I know I would have teased you, so I answered my own question."
It was like a switch had gone off in her head and the air was gone from her lungs. Suddenly, Toni slammed her foot on the break and yanked the steering wheel to the right, almost losing control. Ignoring the screams of the wheels, she pulled off the road and stopped the car within a few seconds. It felt like someone had punched her and was now sitting on her chest, as she couldn't seem to catch her breath. It felt like someone had their hands wrapped around her heart and was squeezing.
"You need to have faith!" She cheered as she grabbed onto his arm. "Any woman would be proud to have you. You just need to show them your personality."
handle it. She didn't know how to handle the emotions, which was why her guilt over Bucky's death was eating her alive. It was why she was seeing him everywhere, though that could be the lack of sleep. It was no secret that sleep deprivation had a few side effects, and seeing things was one of those things. So seeing Bucky everywhere was nothing, which was what Toni told herself daily. That was what she always told herself, because she didn't know what to do. She didn't know how to process anything that didn't involve numbers and complicated equations.
Toni threw her head back and stared at the ceiling. "I'm fine," she said through her teeth. She didn't want to be here, and she wanted nothing more than to get back to her device. It might not work, but she wouldn't know unless she tried.
Pepper felt her heart drop, looking at Steve, who looked completely defeated. "Steve, don't go. Not like this. Let's all calm down before we self-destruct."
Peggy took a deep breath. "You like to play the victim, while you're the one leading them on. It is quite pathetic," she answered. "You just like to break hearts."
"It's classified information, Toni," he replied, dryly. "Now where is Rogers?" he asked again. "Why isn't he here?"
Even when Steve and Toni were fighting, she had never looked at him like that, and Steve knew why. It didn't take a genius to know that she didn't like Fury. She didn't trust Fury, and Steve had to admit that he didn't trust or like Fury as well. "Director," Steve said, making his way over to Toni.
Spector had a hint of uncertainly in his eyes, and it only grew with that line. "Okay, Miss Stark, but if you need anything else, here is my card?" he said, holding out his business card for her to take.
Toni was shocked by the coldness in his voice, and it stunned her for a few seconds. It was a struggle to find her words, but she refused to be silenced by him, even if she had no idea of what to say. "Excuse me?" she said. "You did not-"
He let out a sigh, because he knew this and didn't need her to tell him that. "I know," he said. He just needed to figure out what to say, because he couldn't risk saying the wrong thing and pushing her away.
"You need to get out," he told himself. He needed to get out, back into the world, though he didn't know how he would do that. He had no idea of where to begin; he could take up Fury's offer, but the idea of going on a mission without his commandos was painful. He wouldn't even know how to go on a mission without them, and did the world really need him? They lasted this long without a Captain America, so why would they need him now?
She grinned as she reached the pot of hot, delicious coffee. Oh, the headlines. Oh, the stupid stories that the media tried to sell to whoever wanted to listen. She loved those stupid headlines, who loved to paint her like the bad guy no matter what was happening or who she was with. They loved to hate her. Though she would never admit how much they hurt, she had a good laugh at those stories at times. Really, some were down right funny—like her in a love triangle with some random person (usually insert a random Avenger) and Steve, and she would find herself laughing for hours.
Seeing that she was, she made her way toward her device, which was locked in a metal chest on the other side of the room. No one, besides Salty, Howard, and herself, knew it was there, and no one else had the key. They all knew it was risky to keep it here, but it was the safest place for it while they were on the move. There was also nowhere else to keep it and it wasn't like Phillips trusted her completely, because he didn't. He trusted that she was telling the truth, but that was it. Toni didn't blame him for it as it was part of the game.
Toni sat down near the front of the craft where Phillips usually sat and before putting her pack away, she pulled out a pen and her journal to sketch out another design for her Iron Man Suits as it was one of the few things that could calm her.
"Thank you," Steve said, interrupting the brunette. There was a huge smile on his face, and it was so blinding that it could land planes.
"Why can't I just care? I would like to think that we've become friends," he replied, not moving from his spot.
She popped up, shocked that Sassy even asked. "Did you just ask if Steve and I are dating?" she asked, coughing. That got her heart beat up.
His hands balled at his side as he watched some man go after her, trying to talk to her. His metal hand twitched as his right went for the knife in his belt. He was seconds from jumping out from the bushes and attacking this man for daring to touch her. How dare he touch something that was
After dropping the wet clothes in the laundry basket and stepping out of the bathroom, he could feel Toni's eyes on him as she buried herself in the blanket. He smiled softly at her as he stepped to a chair. He turned his back on her a second to take his uniform off. He wasn't sure what it was about his movement, but the genius panicked at it.
"Geez, Toni," he muttered as she had him on the defensive. She was throwing punches and kicks like there was no tomorrow. "Good to know all of these lessons are working out well." Toni let out a chuckle as she swung again, but Barnes caught this one. She tried to pull away, but she couldn't break his grip. "Gotcha."
She smiled into his neck. "Just admit you like it," she teased as she placed her hands on his chest.
. That was the nicest thing she could say, granted that could be the lack of sleep talking. With the lack of rest and her mind running million miles per second, everything felt so much worse, and it was putting her on edge.
She refused to show how scared she was so she focused on the smell of the nasty trash and not the emotionless voice. Maybe, the smell would put some other emotion besides fear in her. She shook her head, trying to free her hand. "Or smart," she retorted back, knocking his hand away.
Plus, he can't wait to touch, kiss, and lick every part of both of these men, and he can't wait to be squashed between two naked Super Soldiers. He can't wait to feel their hands caress every part of him, and even if he's wearing a boot and a brace, he isn't going to allow them to stop him from getting a good roll in the bed. "I'm up for anything," Tony says, smiling against Bucky's lips.
Toni put on the biggest smile she could muster. "Oh, we can still fight, but now, there'll be make-up sex and angry sex, which are the best kinds of sex there are," she said, as she stared at the Archer.
In the next chapter, we get to see Toni is the hot state of California and we get to see if Hydra's plan works.
Before Rhodes or Pepper could say a word, Toni had disappeared into her private bathroom for a quick shower. She barely got her hair wet, only staying along enough to rise the dirt off, and once she got most of the dirt off, she got out. Not bothering to dry herself, she wrapped a towel around her and vanished into the closet, and it wasn't until ten minutes later that she came out in an oversized MIT sweat shirt and yoga pants. The sweatshirt's neck line hung low on one side, exposing the soft skin of her shoulder and the thin black strap of her bra. Her arms were drowning in the sleeves with her fingers barely poking out. It was almost like a dress on her, as it hanged just below her butt.
Who was that third Party? Why would the third party tell Hydra? That freaked her but she used that fear to motivate her and she was able to pull the blade from her boot. Without a second thought, she brought the blade down on the Commander's arm, slicing into her flesh. The woman cursed loudly as the knife stuck into the arm. She dropped Toni, who landed hard on the ground.
"Toni!" the man, which she could tell now, yelled as he held her tightly. "Breath. You need to breath."
"She's being crazy today, Steve," Barnes stated as he stopped by the water feature in the living room.
"So why don't we show him tonight after Movie night?" Steve asks, giving him a wink. "Just three of us."
Toni took a step back and turned to face the wall because she didn't want to talk about this subject with Loki. Granted having sex with a god (not that Loki could really be called a god) would be quite an experience, she would not to sleep with a mass murderer. "I doubt Thor sent you back to talk to me about your sex life and his choice in a girlfriend."
Somehow, she made it back to her tent without being stopped, but when she got there, she wasn't so lucky. In front of her stood Barnes, who was eyeing her intensely. "Why are you here?" she asked as she played with the wrench in her pocket. There was nothing she wanted to hear from him.
Maybe, it was the fact that Toni was still missing. Maybe, it was the fact everything was crashing down around him, but something cracked inside of him when the Winter Soldier was unmasked. "Bucky," he uttered, his voice cracking. No, No, this wasn't possible. This couldn't be happening. Bucky, his Bucky, was alive. Toni wasn't seeing thing. Wait, why would Bucky harm Toni? Would Bucky hurt him? Bucky was his friend. Bucky was family, his everything. How could the man he grew up with try to kill him?
Shaking her head, she stepped into the debriefing room. The room was filled with Soldiers, and most of them were circled around a table with a map. Rogers was pointing to something, but it wasn't what he was pointing at that caught her eyes. It was his uniform, and how good he looked…
"It's cold. I should get home," he told himself. Bucky was probably worried about him, and he knew his best friend well enough to know that he would come looking for him if he didn't show up soon. Bucky knew what he was up to, and he was already worried about Steve's sanity.
"It looks like he's coming to his sense" Barnes praised, stepping out of the shadows. There was a cruel, ungiving look in his eyes as he locked onto her. It cut through her like she was butter, sending her into a panic. "Too bad he stopped there." His glance dropped to purple bruise peaking out of her sleeve. "He should've finished the job."
As it was unclear to how long she was in the cell, she was glad to take a shower. She felt so dirty and disgusting, and she hated feeling like that. Unlike a regular woman, she didn't care if she took a shower every day; however, she refused to be dirty and smelly.
"By the way, nice paint job," Rogers stated, drawing her attention back to him. She was surprised he didn't leave with Pepper. "It's something."
She missed her Malibu lab, which came with a garage exit. In this tower, the only way to leave was the now painted doors. "I'm on the highway to hell. On the highway to hell," she sung loudly. Her voice was almost quacking, but she didn't care.
Without another word being said, Tony feels two pairs of arms carefully untangle him from his best friend and Natasha, and there's nothing he can do to stop them. Feeling his muscles twitch, he doesn't put up much of a fight against the two as they pick him up with ease and pull him to them. He does nothing when he finds himself in Bucky's chest and Steve's arms wrapped around them. Tony knows he's trapped as they rest their heads against his, but he wonders if he wants to do anything about it, as he feels so good in their arms. Really Good.
She was sick of hearing that name. "Shut it," she cursed again as she drifted over into unconsciousness.
Barnes took a step forward, which Toni didn't like it. "I've seen you sneak out countless times into these woods, Toni. You know how dangerous that is? I wanted to make sure you were okay."
Toni frowned at him before glancing at her father, who was talking to Peggy. "…Fine," she replied, pushing herself up from the ground. "Let's talk," she said, as she dusted the dirt off her.
The smile disappeared on Maya's face as she got to her feet and strengthened her clothes. With decisiveness, she stepped away from the worn laptop and toward a small set of steps, leading to a lower level.
Howard raised the shield to block it. The wrenched dinged loudly as it made contact and fell to the ground. "What is with you and throwing things at me?" he asked.
"About your engagement. It's all over the news. It's like a media circus and you know how I hate that crap."
Steve took a deep breath before stepping away. "I do not wish to talk about this." He snapped. Why did everyone want to talk about his love life? Why did people care? "So, lay off." It looked like there was something else on Romanoff's tongue, but Steve didn't give her the chance to say another damn thing.
Jim didn't back down from this line of questioning, and there was no doubt that he had a lot on his mind to say on the matter. "Why isn't he here?" he demanded.
"Steve would kill me if I let something to you," he stated as he watched her tuck the gun into her pants and hid a knife in her boot.
"One is that core won't work. Not strong enough for what you need it for," he replied. "I have been testing these cores, and yes, they have an impressive energy level, but it's limited. The core will only get you so far."
He wanted nothing more than to shut Loki up. "What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?" he asked, noticing some distance thunder. The sudden storm struck Steve as odd, but he enjoyed seeing the worried look on Loki's face. He rather enjoyed it compared to the hunger look that he spotted whenever he looked at Toni.
"What?" he asked, completely in shock. "What do you mean by you're leaving, because I can't have you going out by yourself."
Sharon turned back, giving Toni an exhausted look. Letting out a loud sigh, she spoke, "Fury put me here for a reason. To protect Rogers, nothing more. Nothing less. I agreed because of what he means to my Aunt Peggy. You should be grateful or at least understand. Don't add more to this." With that, she left, slamming the door behind her.
She took a deep breath as she tried to clear her minds of the negative thoughts. This reminded her of one of those scenes in a horror film. The type where the viewer says, 'you're an idiot for going into that dark alley alone.' Shaking her head, she put on a smile as she tried to hide her fear. She exhaled slowly as she walked pass a dumpster, which was only a few feet away from the back of the alley way.
Steve ran her hand down her back. "I know, Doll Face," he said, breaking out his Brooklyn accent. He knew how tough the woman in his arms was and how she would fight like hell to get what she wanted. He knew she wasn't the type to give up, but this woman was breaking, and he hated that. He would do whatever it took to make sure that didn't happen and to make sure that his brilliant genius was okay back. "I know."
"I get it. I just don't like it," he replied through his teeth as his hands tightened on the steering wheel. He hated the idea of leaving Toni, even if Natasha had a point. He just had to trust that Toni would be okay.
done this…well with anyone besides Pepper or me." He folded his arms across his chest as he fondly looked at Toni. It was clear how deeply he cared for the woman sleeping in Steve's arm. "This is different. I can already tell, so I do think this could work out…" He paused for a second. "Or could end badly."
"Finding Toni isn't?" Steve replied, getting to his feet. He was tired of sitting around here and doing nothing. He was going to find Toni, with or without SHIELD—not that they seemed to be having any luck on their own. But he could do better on his own, tracking Toni the way he knew best.
"Yes, and the items taken were specifically designed to take down Toni Stark and the Iron Man Suit," he stated with no shame. "And this is why I think these two things are related."
"Why don't you bite your tongue?" He snapped. His voice could melt metal with that nasty tone of his.
The Colonel, not letting go of the Genius, glanced up to Rogers. "I got it, Rogers." His voice was anything but friendly.
toy? The very thought made Toni shudder, but if she thought about it, he probably wasn't the only one…Before Steve, she had chuckled at the thought, but now, it was extremely creepy, especially when he was right in front of her.
"Whoa, it was a joke. Geez," Barnes muttered as he put his hands up in defense. "If I didn't know better, I would think you liked her."
Getting a call from Pepper was one of the most stressful experience of Steve Rogers' life, and that was saying something. Having in fought in WW2, he had called and spoken to the loves ones of many deceased soldiers and comrades, as he had to inform the families of their death. Each time, he had done so without sheading a tear. He had done so with a smooth, strong voice, trying to give the families the rock they needed—granted some might say he was too cold, but it was just a shell. Each call stabbed his heart, but he kept it in as he couldn't be weak in front of his men. However, this time, he couldn't, and he knew why.
"Not unbelievable," Maria Hill replied, stepping into the room. Like Natasha, a stoic expression rested on her face. "It was only going to be a matter of time before someone else made their own super soldier."
"We get it. You really hate that movie," Clint says, as he suddenly enters the room. "Give it a rest already."
"Good," Pepper replied. "Now, I have to put a stop to this hail storm. Toni, don't do anything else, until this thing calms down. You got it?"
Tony chuckles from his spot on the sofa as he cuddles into Bucky's right side with the former assassin's arm wrapped tightly around him. In the past, the genius has never been the cuddlier even during the time with Pepper, but he can't get enough of it with the Super Soldiers. If he could get his work completed while cuddling, he could and would. If he never has to leave Rogers and Barnes' side, he wouldn't. "Well, FRIDAY? Have we?" he asks.
She only sparingly glanced at them. "Trust me, I got," she stated as she removed the outer coating of the device. There was a small empty section in the center of the device, where the power source was supposed to go. Her best bet was to rework the hydra power core, using the ports already connected to the core's containment unit, instead of just using the core and trying to connect it directly.
Bucky and Steve get to their feet and follow Tony as he paces the labs. "I was wrong. Dead wrong," Bucky states with a weak smile. "I didn't realize why at time."
Barnes released Toni's wrists, stepped away from Toni as if he was caught doing something illegal. "No, Ma'am."
The Asset's eyes dropped from the Politician and turned back to the window. New York was a city that never slept, and even if it was past midnight, the streets were filled with people. Everywhere he looked there was someone, and he detested it. He didn't hate a lot of things, but he wasn't a fan of people or crowds. There were too many factors and variables in a large crowd; people were hard to predict. They didn't listen or follow any logical. They refused to do what they were supposed to do. They didn't follow orders like he did. They disobeyed, and it annoyed the Asset. If he had to listen, then they had to listen. It was how the world work—or should work. It made things simpler.
The man now known as Rumlow dropped his hand from Toni's face, but he kept a firm grasp on her. "I don't care. Get him to return to base. We'll report it later."
She let out a loud groan. "You're worse than Rogers," Toni stated as she leaned back from the engine block.
With everything that the blond had just seen and the nasty conversion that they had the day prior, Toni was amazed that Sharon could be this friendly. Was Sharon a better person? It made her wonder if they could've been friends all those years ago…well that was if they could've stopped competing. For some reason, they always fought for Aunt Peg's attention. "The Original is my bread and butter, but I can't hate on the Next Generation." She said, taking the woman's hand. It was odd how the pieces of life fell into place.
"How did I get on the couch?" he asks, getting to his feet. He pays no attention to the blanket as he pushes himself up.
Toni froze for a second, taking a few minutes to realize what the hell he was talking about. Usually, she only half listened whenever someone talked, and now, was no different. Most of the times, she acted cool and played it off, like the awesome person she was. But, there was more to his comment then her half listening, and when she realized what he meant, it took everything she had not to laugh. She forgot she had given him the idea that she was pregnant with Steve's kid, not that she understood how he even got the idea. However, she still couldn't believe that he believed that. Killian had the creepy scientist vibe…well, the creepy vibe in general, but how completely stupid he could he be? How did he not know she was lying? Maybe, the blonde dye had gone to his head.
At this point, the techs had left. "The only one person on a high horse is you," he stated as he stepped toward her.
Finally resting for a second- her legs giving out on her-, she rested against a nearby tree and reached into her pocket for her phone. It felt heavy in her hand, while she tried to find a signal, as it was her last line difference. Her life line. No matter how tall she tried to make herself, she got nothing. No matter how much she waved it in the air, it still angry beeped at her, every time she tried. It was mocking her. Though her mind was in a fog—lost in her own head-, she was able to piece together that someone had a cell phone jammer, which was just a kick to the stomach. She could barely breath, thinking—realizing how alone she was.
Everything was spinning and shaking beneath her. Her legs were jello, and she was barely able to keep to her feet. Nauseous times ten, Toni closed her eyes and forced herself to take a few deep breaths. It felt like the Earth was going to open up and swallow her whole. The world was about to cave in and end around her. Oh, god, she felt like she was about to die. The pain was too much.
Toni's eyes flew open and she glanced around the cell. "Who's there?" she asked, annoyed at the sound of her own voice. It sounded as if there was a frog in her throat. In the corner, she would see a shape take form. "Come out!"
Natasha stepped forward, stepping between the two men. "That's enough," she stated through her teeth. She glanced toward the first responders and the line of reports a few yards off. They may have been kept back for now, but it wouldn't last for long. "Now is not the time."
Pepper was pacing the Avenger's Tower, waiting for some word on Toni. Unlike Toni, the CEO knew this tower wasn't Stark Tower anymore and wasn't going to fight that losing battle. However, it didn't mean she liked it. She hated how involved Toni had gotten with the Avengers, wishing there was some distance between them. She hated the constant worry that Toni might not come back. She hated that Toni put her life on the line everyday by being Iron Man, and she wanted her to stop. She couldn't take another scare like this.
"That's won't do, Salty. I need to get it myself," she stated. She couldn't risk someone else getting it. Besides, she knew no one was going to make it back; the only way to ensure its return was to get it herself.
"Yes, I like that idea," Pepper replied. "And you have to deal with SI while I'm gone. You get to be CEO for that month."
time or degree, and it usually pointed toward something wrong. Something deadly, and she was scared of what it meant, because it had to mean something. She was scared of what it said about her. It frightened her, making her heart race as her brain started to rapid fire, shooting out questions. Was she sick? Was she defected? Broken? Was she losing her mind? Could she not be Iron Man anymore? Could she not be a hero anymore? Was she useless? Was she a burden? So, with all her doubts, she kept it to her.
That hurt like a bullet to the heart, but Salty was right. She didn't belong here; she needed to go back to her time. Maybe, she should listen to the Murderer.
Steve looked up from the counter. "Banner," he said, surprised. "How long have you been back?" He didn't know that Banner was in the tower.
"I assume this is a communication device," he stated as he stared at the smart phone. "I can't quite get it to work, but that isn't what I am interested in."
Natasha is watching the three with an interesting look in her eyes. "Don't you two look fetching? Be beating the ladies and guys back with a stick," she is smirking.
Tony's heart is pounding in his chest, and he can feel his chest tight. "I'm not a teenager girl," he utters before he can stop himself.
The Asset didn't move. He didn't respond or agreed. He wasn't doing anything. There was nothing he could do, besides listen. That was the only thing he was allowed to do, even if he wanted to do something. She was his, and this man was threating her. He did not like it, but he could do nothing. He was nothing.
"We made a mistake before. We-No, I. I shouldn't have let you walk out of that hospital room. I should've kept you close, and I am sorry. I lost my cool before, and I'm sorry. I have lost so much, and I don't want to lose anyone else important to me," Barnes adds, looking into his eyes.
The Brunette, whose name still escaped, slowed down as she came across the park. There was a bit hesitation in her step as she turned to the park. As she stepped toward the park, he studied her body language, wondering what had gotten her out in this time of night. It was more than just wanting to run in the night air, because he could see the weight in her step with each step. He could see the exhaustion in her step as she made a sharp turn. It took all that she had to remain on her feet. There was something on her chest.
Again, his words all went south, and if he didn't shut up, Toni was going to used him as a distraction for her nightmares. She was going jump and climb him like a tree with everyone watching. She didn't care. "Just go before I drag you to my bed."
Not answering her, he stepped away from the sink to the pan she threw away. He eyed it curiously but he didn't say anything.
Itchy did not even begin to describe how Toni was feeling at that moment. It was like something was crawling under her skin and picking at her from the inside. And no matter how many times she shifted, she couldn't get comfortable. It was almost like a bee, who kept stinging her, and she couldn't get. It was frustration to say the least, and it was only getting worse. It wasn't helping that Steve kept starting at her from the corner of his eyes like she was going to breakdown or disappear at any second. Granted, there were some lingering feelings as her mind kept replaying what that masked shooter said. Plus, there was the whole fact that she was seeing things…Maybe, Rogers had a point. Crap.
"If you want to fight, Steve, we can do that, but let's get Toni in bed," he stated walking up the steps. Her head was rested against his shoulder and he could feel her breath on his neck.
"JARVIS," she called, though she couldn't hear her own voice. She didn't even know if she was speaking. What the hell was this? Her ears, in protest, were about to explode, and her mind was on strike, as she could no longer piece together full sentences. All she was left with was basic desires and needs. Right now, she only knew pain, and that feeling was overpowering. It almost sent her to her knees as everything started to grow distant. She suddenly felt frightened, feeling she was able to lose everything.
"Bucky scares them all off with that death stares of his," Rogers states with a chuckle. He too is wearing dark jeans, but he's wearing a light blue button up shirt.
Toni didn't retracted from Howard's arms, but she peaked out toward Peggy, who was trying to sport a smile but failing. "I don't know how any of you can say that." Tears streamed down her face.
Phillips nodded before he stepped toward Howard and Toni, and though the dirt circle was gone, he was careful not to step within the ten foot range of the device. "Ready, Stark?"
"If you agree to help and work alongside Stark, you can work off your sentence." He paused. "You have a bright mind. Now imagine what you can do if you and Stark put your minds together."
The first thing that came to mind when he woke up was her and then the rest of the world. This room, this strange room, was the last thing he thought about. He needed to see Toni. "Where am I?" he asked the Agent staring at him. The radio was on, broadcasting a baseball game.
," he says, scooting as fast as he can. He can't be this close to them, because he can't think straight with them close.
She held the folder firmly against lap as she was afraid it would disappear. She had to read it to settle her mind, but she wanted to do it alone, though she knew no one would let her.
That was her clue to go. "I'm going for a walk," Toni stated loudly as she walked to the closest. She grabbed Roger's coat and put it on. Barnes eyed her the whole time, knowing why she was leaving. She didn't want to be here for the argument that was about to happen.
Schmidt looked at her. "You don't know when to be quiet. Maybe, that's why the Americans sent you in. A way to silence you?"
"Well, if he could do that, he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet," Banner said.
"There is nothing to see," JARVIS stated. "I have already studied the footage. There is no record of Miss Stark leaving."
Steve felt his heart drop, as Toni should be here! She wasn't due for Malibu until for another week to run Stark Industries while Pepper was on that month long vacation. Did she leave early? No, that didn't make sense not without telling him…granted he went radio silent for the last few weeks. "Where is she?" he asked, his tone changing.
She took a deep breath as she arrived at the light and rested her head against the post. The poll was cold to the touch, almost freezing her fingers to it, but she didn't pull away. It wasn't as if she wasn't already freezing. Her thoughts were too negative for her to care about the cold.
"So the Iron Patriot…?" Toni asked, teasing Rhodey. She was really shocked to see Jim, but it was a nice surprise, even if the meeting was in the office and not in some bar getting hammered. Even if she promised herself not to break her promise to her father, she couldn't help the desire to drink.
Toni was snapped out of her thoughts by a hand on her shoulder. "Peachy," she replied as she glanced at her Father, who was staring at her. She wasn't in the mood to speak, but she was quite proud at herself for not flinching. "How are you, Mr. Stark? Not too tired from those late nights?" she asked with a smirk that was her façade.
"I'm proud of my mouth." She paused to catch the look in his eyes. "And I won't tell you anything, so do your worst."
She didn't know how she could ever trust them—SHIELD spies, probably reporting everything to the pirate. However, Sharon was offering a life line, and considering everything, Toni didn't want to reject her out of hand. Plus, if Sharon was offering, Toni must look like shit. "You better be talking about the original ones. That is my favorite." She took a deep sigh. "Not, the new movies. Don't get me started on them."
She wanted to give him the file back, not wanting it anymore, as all it did was haunt her, making her question everything. Plus, she couldn't take this time anymore and she wanted to use the device. Just as Howard and his work station came into sight, someone grabbed a hold of her upper right arm pulling her toward a few trees.
"You're planning on taking Toni back with you?" Clint said, anything but friendly. "Away from the Avengers."
"If you want to see Rogers, you can head down," Toni replied. It came out harsher then she intended, but she hoped she got her point across. "Just take the elevator down."
Why was she pushing her toward Barnes to hard? "Just forget it then." She put on a large smile as she picked up her speed.
"I'm fine!" she yelled back, finally realizing how to rotate the bra. After a few minutes of struggling, she was able to get it on properly. "There, we go." She smiled as she looked in the mirror. "See, I look much better."
"I think that would have been worse." It really would have. Steve wouldn't wish that curse on anyone. He couldn't imagine the damage that would do on a person's psyche.
Feeling like death, the brunette stepped out the Mark 7 and headed toward the stairs. She had been flying around for hours, trying to find this 'shadow,' but as the AI had stated, there was nothing out there. It was like she was searching for a ghost as she tried to find this man… if there was a man. There was no way to confirm that there was something at the window, and how could there be? The AI would've spotted the intruder; plus, the window was over a cliff overlooking the ocean. There was no way someone could've been standing there the whole time and disappear so quickly without detection.
