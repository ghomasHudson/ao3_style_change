“It’s a swear bucket,” Romanoff corrected, unstrapping herself and cautiously approaching, hand held out, reaching for Steve’s cheek. “May I?”
Really ruins the whole thing a bit if the guy you are attempting to extort has to catch you half-way through your spiel.
Rhodey shrugged. “The same the world over, it turns out.” He looked across the room to where Wilson had busied himself fetching three cups of coffee. A small smile touched Rhodey’s face as he watched Wilson set a cup beside Tony’s papers.
If it had been Tony in Steve’s shoes, if his nightmares had been broadcast, his journal opened, his childhood on display for all the world to see, would he have been able to look anyone in the eyes again?
The implications of that hit Tony somewhere south of his sternum, all his breath rushing out in a single gasp.
After a moment, FRIDAY speaks up timidly into the silence. “Boss. Should I call for medical attention?”
With respect to the bracelet - I can't imagine the T'Challa we saw in Black Panther letting someone as uncontrolled and as dangerous as Wanda walk around. (Let alone someone with outstanding arrest warrants - but we'll get to that later.) And having Wanda
Steve chewed his lower lip, staring at his scraped knees. “No,” he admitted finally, his voice miserable. He was silent for a long moment. “I just didn’t want to be on my own.” When he looked up, his eyes were glassy and wet. “I got scared.”
It was - it wasn’t quite what he’d been expecting, but it was fine. “It’s fine,” he said, then winced. He hadn’t quite meant to blurt that out. It sounded… well. “I - I mean, thank you. This is very generous.” That was marginally better, although still nowhere near the note he should have hit. Pepper was gonna have his head for squandering an opportunity to forge closer ties, et cetera, et cetera.
Rhodey nodded stiffly. “He was… the lack of mental health care was always a sore spot for him, you know? He was always so bitter about it. We always talk about how well we look after our forces and our veterans, but the reality is just…” He shrugged again.
Tony was abruptly too tired to have this fight. Not while he was recovering from surgery, inside a fucking
Mordo’s new modus operandi seemed to be focused on making peace with Tony, probably so his sudden yet inevitable betrayal later on would have some dramatic tension. At least, that was the only possible explanation Tony could come up for why the guy had chosen to sit next to him on the flight over when there was a perfectly serviceable seat next to, say, Barnes. As it is, Barnes had sat behind Tony and Wanda had sat in front of Mordo, beside Barton in the pilot’s seat. Okoye rounded off the team, busily examining her knives in the seat beside Barnes.
Honestly, he didn’t know which version of Steve was more squirrelly - the older version with everything that affected those around him, or this version and his health. He tried to keep the impatience out of his voice. “What’s wrong, kid? I can’t make it better unless you tell me.”
Steve’s voice said from all around him, quiet and sad, and Tony closed his hand tight over the pebble, his breath coming hard.
“It is if it’s eating up the first quarter’s R&D budget. Without the derogation, the tax exemptions aren’t applicable and he’s worried about the shareholders. With that, the fallout from the Accords, and the dissolution of the Avengers Initiative...” She shrugged. “There’s paperwork you need to look at for the Avengers subsidiary, by the way. Some of the lawsuits look pretty solid and we’re likely going to have to settle.”
Lang didn’t bother introducing himself to Steve, patting the child on the head absent-mindedly instead as he fell into step beside Tony. “How are you guys holding up?”
Tony could do absolutely nothing about it, out here. “I’ll call you back.” He disconnected the call and snapped up the faceplate, squinting in the bright artificial light of the airport. “So, if we put the cuffs back on you, you’ll just take them off again, is what you’re saying. And that’s supposed to build bridges of trust and understanding?” And that was assuming he took Mordo’s new-found goodwill on trust; God only knew what he’d done to the others.
She nodded disjointedly and wiped away the last of her tears. “I do not delude myself that this makes anything better. But I wanted to say it. I wanted it to have been said. I spoke to Vision about - about what I did, how I hurt him. We... we talked.” She reached for her cup and drank it shakily, her posture still that of the chastised little girl.
, and his head was throbbing with every beat of his heart. Later, maybe, he’d be able to muster up some righteous indignation, some curiosity about why he wasn't dead, but right now… “There didn’t seem an appropriate moment, and you’ll forgive me if I’m not especially keen to hand out my medical history to people that were trying to kill me not too long ago.” His stomach clenched, bile rising.
. He wasn’t sure why that hit him so solidly. Hadn’t the others wandered across half of West Africa? Weren’t Rhodey, Sam and Vision on the other side of the country? Wasn’t… He sighed, Steve’s half-folded pajama top in his hands. He shoved it into the case and sat down on the bed.
“Well,” Wilson grimaced, “not that it did much good. But you’re both civilians right now, and…” he leaned forward, filling the screen suddenly. “Listen, if you’ve changed your mind, if you want someone to just, I don’t know, get you and go to ground somewhere -”
So, yeah. Romanoff and Barton had both been maneuvering him for their own ends - or for what they saw as the
Barnes made himself - well, comfortable was probably over-stating it, given that he was on his feet, facing the only entrance into the room.
“- then you could be removed from the Avengers roster for seeking treatment,” Tony realised. His stomach sank. “Or even for having something on your medical record - oh, of all the -! Why didn’t he - for fuck’s sake! Why didn’t he just
After a long moment, Pepper nodded, her hand tightening over Happy’s. “I understand. Just - promise me you’ll be careful? And - if you need anything from us, if you need us to arrange anything -”
For his part, Barnes seemed just as bemused at Tony’s jam predicament as Tony had been at Barnes’s earlier discomfiture.
Not until now. These last few weeks, these last few days. Those hours on the quinjet, his hands tight on the armrests, bartering away the scraps of his soul to whoever might be listening to keep Steve safe until he got him back.
“Yes, boss. Ms Potts called a little while ago and left a message. Your escort has the rest of your briefing and arranged the cover stories for Agent Barton and Mr Barnes. She also reminded you that the cleaning staff and security staff in the facility have all be vetted and that you’re not to frighten them off.”
The morning had not gone well. Steve had immediately figured out that something bad was going to happen by the presence of Vision and Romanoff, who had turned up a little after 6am armed with age-appropriate toys and a truly impressive array of weaponry.
,” a quiet voice said to Tony’s right; Lang, on the far side of the room, looking green around the gills. “Why would anyone do that? Not just once, but...”
, Tony thought with a smile. He caught Hill’s gaze. Of course, there was one thing that Hill wouldn’t mention but which had to be foremost on her mind. Ross could be stalled by polite iciness only as far as he allowed the trappings of legality to hold him. Put one toe out of line and he had a whole host of extra-legal alternatives open to him.
“Not if we keep him out of sight,” she agreed easily. “I assume T’Challa can provide him with papers?”
Steve was a really lousy liar, Tony had no idea how the fuck he’d grown up to be so good at obfuscation when he’d had so little to work with.
They had no idea what this psycho wanted, other than to make floor art with children’s bodies. All they had to go on were the remnants of the portals, and one dead eyewitness.
The kid stared at him with enormous eyes and a trembling lower lip, clearly having cried himself to sleep more than a couple of times if the state of his blotchy red face was any indication. He had jam smeared on his chin and in his hair, and was wearing the pyjamas Tony had left him in when they’d departed Wakanda. Tony had a horrible feeling that he had stayed in them all day. There was a shrillness to his voice that rang horribly familiar -
“It’s not,” Tony cut her off. He didn’t know what she had been about to say, and he didn’t want to have this conversation again, or to second-guess himself. He’d agreed - in principle - to let Wanda near Steve. In theory.
He took a step back. “I can’t,” he said, soft and quiet. “It’s too much to ask. You can’t force it. I can’t - this isn’t something I can deal with while Rogers is in absentia.”
There was an odd look in Barton’s eyes. “You asked for a lift, not for back-up. Vision and Rhodes are waiting for us at Birnin Zana. Sam and Scott should get there by the time we arrive as well.”
Tony swiped through on his tablet and the familiar hum of the scrambler filled the penthouse. The lines were normally pretty damn secure, of course, but if T’Challa was calling about certain guests that Tony suspected were sleeping under his roof, then it couldn’t hurt to get all his toys up and running on the off chance that someone (Ross) had been able to crack his encryption. “All set. Shoot.”
Something was very loud in the room. After a long moment, Tony realised that it was his own breathing, harsh and wet. His hands were clenched in Steve’s T-shirt as he hugged the child to his chest. “Well, now, that’s a problem, Robocop. I don’t give a rat’s ass about what Rogers would want. His ‘wants’ are what got us into this mess in the first place, so no, I don’t care if you think he’d rather be filling out his spandex again. That’s not justification for putting a kid in danger! It’s the same attitude that got you all into this mess - get your mission accomplished and hang the collateral damage; well I’m not letting you sacrifice anyone else on the altar of getting your own way!” He ran out of breath, staring at Barnes furiously. God, he hated the man. Hated him beyond what his hands had done, what he’d been forced to do. Hated him because he was squarely in Rogers’s corner and that, right now…
They sat in silence, Barnes watching the outside and Barton’s eyes occasionally glancing between Hill and Tony, his brow furrowed. In Tony’s lap, Steve murmured and shifted in restless sleep, heedless of Tony’s attempts to soothe him.
sounded like fighting. And far too close for his liking. His eyes tracked back to the closed bedroom door, Steve still blissfully asleep on the other side.
Mordo had said, but he did not view Steve as a child and there were plenty of ways Steve could be hurt that would not involve Mordo inflicting the pain himself. And if the alternative was worse, if the consequences of Umar winning were so dire, did what Mordo had planned still count as ‘hurt’? Or was it, in the basest sense of the term, an act of mercy?
All of that meant that only Natasha and Wanda were left of the team (with Scott Lang looking somewhat awkward off to the side); a strange group by anyone’s standards, and certainly not one made up of Tony’s biggest fans. He had in fact briefly considered dismissing this leave-taking as just another mission-related departure - no different from Lang and Vision’s earlier jaunt across half of ECOWAS - but he doubted that Natasha would let him get away with a move like that. And Barton would likely never let him hear the end of it. No, best to man up and take it on the chin.
He reached down and hugged Rhodey firmly. “Don’t let the physio get a free grope in when you’re not paying attention,” he said sternly. The doors opened behind him. “Wilson needs to guard your virtue.”
“I feel like this is a good practice run,” Rhodey said, that same shit-eating grin on his face. “You know, when one of those paternity suits inevitably hits paydirt.”
“I’m crying on the inside,” Tony snapped, and turned his attention back to the tablet. He didn’t want to spare any of his time and energy on this asshole. He had a lot to get through; Shuri and Jane had pushed through an update just before they’d boarded and there was a lot of new data to absorb. There was plenty to keep him occupied, even without the quiet ping from Vision letting him know that everything was OK with Steve.
He looked back at Vision, his gaze sharpening. He reached out a hand towards Vision’s forehead, where the Mind Stone glowed with the proximity; Vision clapped his hand on it and stepped backwards, panic on his face.
Oh, Christ. “He thought you were trying to hurt me,” he said slowly, horror dawning. He hadn’t dreamed it, then, the child screaming and screaming… And then they’d left him with Barnes, while Steve’s only constant in this strange, terrifying new world was taken away. “Christ, Barton.” He stroked a hand over Steve’s head, noting the tear marks on his cheeks and deep circles under his eyes. The poor kid must have been scared half to death.
Barton’s jaw clenched so much Tony was half-expecting to hear his fillings crack. “Yeah, well, I wasn’t real keen on having you stroke out on me through fear before we could get you under, and my options were limited. Forgive me for doing the best I could with a shitty situation, OK? Mea maxima culpa.” He looked down at where Steve was idly unwinding the loose threads from the blanket covering Tony’s bed. “Hey, kiddo. How about I get you something fun to do, huh? Maybe some crayons and pencils?”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Unbunch your panties, Legolas, it was just a question.” He picked up the tablet beside him and tried to concentrate. Vision had sent him a check-in message via FRIDAY almost as soon as they’d been underway to reassure him that Steve had settled down and managed both his breakfast and his medication. Clearly, the management of one small, sickly child was not outside the joint capabilities of Vision and Nat; with both Lang and M’Baku still back at the mountain, there was plenty of back-up for both impromptu attacks and crying jags. They were fine. The kid was fine.
The Red Knight, of course. Tony rubbed his eyes with the heel of his hand. “I told him my name,” he said. Hadn’t he? He thought he had… But with everything going on, maybe the kid had forgotten.
Steve looked up at Tony from his position on the floor - surrounded by loose paper and his favourite crayons - and nodded. As long as Tony remained in his line of sight, everything was fine; no tears, no screaming.
“Yeah, well. Maybe. But whether or not Barnes said it, Steve still obviously thinks it. And Barnes…” Barton chewed his lip. “Something went down between them, anyway.”
How could he have forgotten. His hand reached out, smoothing the blonde hair, checking for injuries. “Steve, how is he?”
Tony thought, looking down at the towheaded boy cushioned safely in his arms. Steve’s mouth hung open in sleep, a whistling sound pushed out of him with each breath. Tony frowned. That didn’t sound especially healthy, and the last thing Steve needed was a bout of pneumonia on top of everything. And would FRIDAY have been able to pick up any bacteria that may have come back with Steve? If he had his child memories and none of his adult ones, that seemed to imply it was some sort of time-portal magic nonsense rather than de-aging magic nonsense. (Magic nonsense just the same, and Tony fucking hated magic, period, but at least he had a rough idea of what he was dealing with.) But that probably meant that the kid was covered in ye olde germs. For all Tony knew, he could have brought back fucking
Honestly, he was a little surprised he’d slept so soundly. He’d have thought that dropping off when there was a corpse-filled room a few metres away would have been difficult, but apparently he’d been more exhausted than he’d thought.
Okoye said something sharp and uncomplimentary under her breath, making an abortive movement to get in front of T’Challa.
me?” He couldn’t fucking believe it. Well, no, given the way his life had been going lately he absolutely
“Bet you're not supposed to touch knives either, huh?” He was almost close enough to make a grab for the knife. “I bet your mom would have a lot to say if she saw you waving that around.” He could probably grab the knife. He should. He should just - “Give me the knife, Steve. I'm not a bad guy, and I'm not here to hurt you.” He held out a hand.
"They're not here anymore, FRI," Tony said absent-mindedly, rounding the corner. The base was clearly deserted; whoever had been here had obviously left. The question was, had they taken Rogers with them?
“Stay safe,” she said. She seemed to be debating something internally, then suddenly stepped forward and embraced him. She let go of Tony - who had been too startled to move - then knelt down and wrapped her arms around Steve briefly. “You too,” she murmured, and kissed his forehead.
He looked down at Steve’s head and fought the urge to sigh. The child hadn’t let go of him since being deposited on Tony’s chest a few hours previously, and Barton’s supervision had had to be conducted in or around Tony’s bed. At least Steve was back to interacting with Barton; for a while, Tony had worried that he’d had one shock too many.
He’d been brave and selfish when he’d built DUMM-E, when he’d laid down the groundwork for JARVIS. When he’d kissed Pepper, when he’d co-opted Rhodey into his life wholesale. He’d opened up the Tower to a team of strangers, and then built an entire new facility for them. He’d eaten pizza with Clint, and watched films with Nat, and sat up late talking with Steve and -
Tony thought in exasperation. “Is this where you tell me that the moral of the story is, I should have been more specific? Because you’re not winning any fans with your attempt to play the lawyer, here.”
He fled without waiting for an answer, grabbing the discarded knife and practically running down the corridor.
“All you big shots keep turning up here and swooning at my feet, it’ll start to give me ideas,” the guy said, sounding very far away. “What’s the child’s name, mzungu?”
But no, that made no sense, they’d clearly despised each other from the very beginning. “Not a fan of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, huh?” His voice was too loud; he could see Wanda shifting, startled.
Right on cue, the therapist appeared, as if summoned by Tony’s sheer recalcitrance. “Don’t worry, this is the last one,” he said, dropping his bag on the floor beside Tony’s bed and pulling out his tablet. “Then we can move on to personal grooming.”
They’d be lucky if they didn’t manage to accidentally kill the kid with all these frequent bouts of exposure.
he thought wryly, and sat down next to M’Baku, affecting not to notice Romanoff sitting down in the free seat next to him. He still wasn’t entirely sure how he felt about her, even taking her stated intentions at face value.
Wilson came back into the room, pushing a wheelchair. “Come on, then, sleeping beauty, let’s go see your shrunken prince,” he said with only minimal sarcasm. He patted the wheelchair seat.
to take an active step in controlling her powers was important to me in helping her and Tony meet halfway. Now all he has to do is trust her with Steve..
First things first, he’d have to get the kid settled in. Tony plucked at the thin red material of the T-shirt and made a face. “And we’ll get you something else to wear.” Something a little warmer. And less… weird.
Tony stared at the inert pebble for a moment, feeling inexplicably better. Rhodey had someone with him, someone who was watching out for him. He was safe, and if all the stars were aligned and Wakandan tech was as shiny as the previews had indicated, maybe he’d be a little further on that road to recovery. All Tony could do was hope, at this point; until the spinal shock finished doing its thing, everything was still up for grabs.
What else? If he played those recordings, what would be on there? Rogers’s thoughts on Barnes, for sure. On Tony, possibly - well, Romanoff would hardly tell him to listen to it if it was just an Ode to Murderbot. On Siberia…?
“If being part of SHIELD accomplished nothing else,” Barton drawled, “it did teach our fearless leader the value of leaving copious records.”
“That’s why, if I have to get us out of here, I’m gonna strap you to the front of the suit,” Tony tossed back over his shoulder. “You’ll be like the world’s worst hood ornament slash GPS system.” No need to mention the unibeam; true, Tony wouldn’t be able to carve his way through the entire mountain, but get him to an exterior wall and he’d do just fine.
Barton sighed and sat down on the edge of the table. “Well, my plan did involve the mountain, but it also involved Scott sitting on you in his giant form until the rest of us figured out a way to track down both D’Artagnan and the crazy shish-kebab lady, and then, you know, have a traditional fight,” he admitted. “None of this trap malarkey. I was voted down.” He shrugged. “I still think my plan was better. Less chance of you doing something stupid, for one thing.”
Steve hid his face against Tony’s shoulder again and Tony flipped the blanket over his head, tightening his hold. “All set.”
Tony thought. That was professional compassion, right there: bland and tasteless and - “I wanted to talk to Rhodey about this. That’s why I called. I - I won’t listen to the others. I shouldn’t have listened to that one, either.”
Barton’s death-grip on Tony’s knee had turned into a sort of approving pat, and Tony fought the urge to pull away. “Stop fondling me,” he muttered instead, and Barton gave a short laugh under his breath.
He’d originally planned to leave early in the morning, but practicalities had immediately intruded. It was gone noon and they were still nowhere near leaving.
“Yeah, right.” He moved so that he was sat against the headboard, pulling the kid up to lean against his chest and sliding the mask over his face. “Let’s have a few big breaths and get those lungs nice and open.”
Barnes flew back a good six feet and thudded into the wall, climbing to his feet to stumble back in the swordsman’s direction.
Tony thought, and rolled his eyes. “Yeah, keeping a seven year old alive was a great stretch of my abilities, Barton, thanks for the parenting award.” He looked down at the small face, almost dwarfed by the face mask. “And I nearly managed to screw that up, anyway,” he said petulantly, almost to himself.
Umar is comicverse Dr Strange's mother-in-law, so let's all take a moment to let that sink in. She is Dormammu's sister, stranded in human form for Reasons (tm), and as we haven't seen her in the MCU yet I am taking full advantage of this to make use of whatever bits of comicverse I need and discard the rest. There's acres of canon on this and I'm basically treating it like pick'n'mix.
“Wasn’t wearing the suit when I found it.” He shifted Steve in his arms and looked down. “You want to stay with Clint while I go look?”
. And he knew he needed to leave Barton here, as someone Steve was familiar with, so it would be less frightening for him. But if he didn’t take Barton, then who did that leave him with? Romanoff?
He was frightened of her, Tony realised with a jolt. Whoever she was, she was strong, and Mordo was no longer as assured of her goodwill as he had been a few moments ago.
What were his options, really? He could let things take their course, letting the child be buffeted by the various forces exerted on him. Mordo might have a way of fighting Umar, and Steve might be a weapon in that - or he might not. Wanda might figure out a way to turn Steve back if Tony let her get close enough (
At Tony’s disbelieving look, he sighed. “He has pneumonia. Wouldn’t be too much of a problem normally, but with the pleurisy and the low body temperature, they want to be on the safe side.”
Steve nodded. “The scary man was in my head.” He pressed a hand to his sternum, to the memory of remembered pain.
He looked down as the child gave one more large, hiccuping sob and abruptly quietened, all the fight draining out of him.
“Maybe,” she acknowledged soberly. “But I can’t think of any other way to make you see that you’re not a special snowflake.”
Steve thought this over and seemed to accept the logic of the plan, relaxing a little. Then, “so is he coming through the door?”
.” He glanced across at Tony, then back over his shoulder at Mordo. “Did he do something, or…” He left the question dangling.
“Yeah.” They had Mordo contained, just. And they were now walking into a place where there would be more of his kind, more wizards and sorcerers willing to sacrifice children on the altar of the greater good. Zealots and fanatics, completely convinced that what they were doing was necessary, was the right thing to do…
Tony pressed his lips to the top of Steve’s head and said nothing, letting the child cry himself out.
Tony hated it when she did that. He had a vague inkling that she tended to do it when she felt vulnerable, which would hint at her being genuinely worried about him. That said, he had no illusions about her own awareness of her tells. It could be a double-bluff. “Anyway. We’ll stay in touch, obviously, but - look, guys, and I can’t believe I’m echoing Lang here, but this isn’t a discussion. Steve and I are heading out in ten - no, eight - minutes, so…” He spread his hands. “This was more by way of a ‘can’t stay for dinner’ message.”
It was the same red magic that still suffused Tony’s dreams, that had made him wake up on more than one occasion soaked in the smell of sour sweat and fear. The same magic that had blown Vision through several feet of concrete, the same magic that had turned Tony’s mind inside out.
Then Tony would have been the one pacing nervously outside his operating room and trying to get a hold of his wife and kids.
“Have you decided on what you want to do about schooling?” Barnes asked finally. He’d sat in silence for Hill’s entire spiel, not even seeming to pay attention but instead gazing out of the window intently. Now, his attention was fixed on the child curled up in Tony’s lap.
Outside of the ward - clearly audible through the partly-open door - Tony could hear Wilson’s ragged exhale, and click of his footsteps beside the wheelchair. “You doing okay, Jim? How’re your stitches holding up?”
to be brought back, or whether he’d also welcome the chance to to live his life over. About whether Rogers’s - Steve’s - feelings on this mattered one way or the other, when the child was here and alive and every bit a person with rights as the adult version had been. And didn’t they owe the child Steve as much of a say in his own life as they would have offered to the adult?
Wanda, of course, wasn’t wearing her bracelet (it was tucked into Okoye’s belt). “And how do the ‘precautions’ feel about that?”
He cracked one eye open and peered up at him blearily. “The Lonely Mountain?” He hazarded, mumbling around the ice chip. “Did I dream that? There was a - guy with a sword…”
Back at the hospital, Steve was just as Tony had left him, carefully propped up on the pillows and the face mask and cannula back in place. Tony paused outside of the room for a moment, watching him sleep through the glass.
“I really have to get on to this, Barnes.” Maximoff was already inching away, her eyes on where Steve still had his face buried against Tony’s shoulder.
Tony stayed perfectly still, listening to Steve’s breathing slowly evening out before he slipped into an exhausted sleep. From this angle, Tony could only really see the top of his head, and the curve of one ear. He was so
Steve nodded and scrambled down from the bed, immediately heading for his art supplies, dwarfed in Tony’s T-shirt.
?” Tony took a deep breath and let it out slowly, his hands clenched into fists underneath the table, conscious that Steve was watching all of this with wide eyes from his vantage point on the floor. “I think it’s a little bit more than
After a moment, Steve reached out and touched the arm as well. A crooked grin appeared as he tentatively stroked the metal, trying to pry his fingers in between the plates.
he thought, his heart heavy. (He doubted there’d ever be a part of him that wouldn’t trade Barnes’s life away for the slightest possibility that it could undo what he’d done; that it could bring Tony’s mom back.)
The child in question sighed and slumped, clearly bored after only a few minutes. He didn’t ask to be set down, though, which spoke volumes about his anxiety levels. After a moment, Tony murmured quietly, “FRIDAY, cue up some Arthurian legends, please.” He offered one of the earbuds to the child who took it obediently and held it up to his ear.
Steve finally looked up. His mouth was thin and pinched, and his eyes were wet. “D’you promise?” He whispered. “If - if I get lost, you’ll come find me?” He looked back down, his entire frame trembling. “Only… only… only my mom said, she said…”
The kid obediently breathed deeply for him, coughing a little but otherwise sounding OK. God, Tony hoped that was the case; the last he needed was for Steve to relapse.
He had his hands full of the mini version right now; he really didn’t need to hear all about how the adult Steve was just so disappointed that Tony couldn’t get over his little hang-ups about,
A corner of Wilson’s mouth quirked in a brief smile at that, and he was gone. His footsteps seemed to cut off abruptly outside the ward doors, as if the soundproofing was excellent or - more likely - as if he’d lingered, waiting for something. (Someone.)
Yes, Bucky will be in this fic, it's taking longer than I thought to get all the pieces to where I need them to be, but rest assured he will be along shortly.
in his hands (from where? Tony doesn't have chocolate in his workshop. Has he been carrying it around the entire time?) and he's trying to get Tony to accept it. Because Tony is clearly a child, to be placated with sweets. (Or an invalid, to be distracted with medicines. Either one is unacceptable at this moment.)
It had taken some time and a few false starts, but Tony had finally managed to acquire a useful reflex in times of extreme personal crises: stay calm, and call Pepper.
hoped that he hadn’t been such a bad friend that Rhodey wouldn’t have wanted to confide in him, but he knew it wasn’t that simple. Rhodey had been with him through the worst times of Tony’s life, and he still hadn’t been able to bring himself to say anything about the palladium poisoning.)
” He laughed again, watching Steve sleep with that same soft expression on his face. “She was completely unrepentant. See, she’d remembered that she wasn’t supposed to cross the road on her own. But Laura hadn’t explained that ‘don’t wander off’ also meant not going home by herself.” He reached out and smoothed down Steve’s rumpled hair, soothing him as he twitched in his sleep. He turned slightly and met Tony’s eyes. “You keep them as safe as you can, as much as you can, for as long as you can. And then you trust that you gave them enough sense to shout if there’s a problem. That’s all you can do.” He shrugged a little. “It’s all anyone can do. You’re not screwing this up, OK? You’re doing fine.”
This was news to Tony, who opened his mouth to point out that someone else’s army had no fucking business rocking up on
kept in touch. And yet you bring strangers here, to the Sanctum. Strangers who fear you, who put chains on you. Now why would that be?” The strange glowing tendrils that Mordo had used to form his shields also seemed to be Minoru’s chosen weapon, twisting out from her outstretched hand, around Mordo’s chest. “What did you do, my dear, to make these people so frightened?”
(The screaming still filled his ears, childish and terrified and growing fainter with distance. Was he moving, or was the child? Either way, someone was trying to separate them.)
She raised an eyebrow. “He knows you’re back in the country. He thinks it’s about time you stopped dodging his calls.”
Barton made a non-committal sound. “Maybe.” He shrugged, looking at Tony sidelong. “You know, when Lila was five, she went missing.” Tony looked at him sharply at that, and Barton waved it away. “I know; where could she possibly go, right? Tiny little town, homestead; what, she’d hide under a bushel of hay or something? But anyway, Laura went down to the post office down the road, the kids with her, and Coop was supposed to be watching her as she queued, and he’d wandered off to chat to another kid, and the next thing you know, Laura’s looking around, and Lila isn’t there.” He laughed softly. “She went absolutely nuts. I mean, Cooper’s still probably never gonna hear the end of it. She ran through that entire town like a banshee,
Of course he wouldn’t have reacted well to being held or strapped down; Tony knew his nightmares well enough to know exactly what he would have flashed back to. “What happened?”
God, huh?” He was half-out of his seat without even being aware of it, twisting around so he could glare at Mordo, the self-righteous, arrogant son of a bitch.
“Tony…” Pepper had a hand over her mouth, her expression simultaneously stunned and horrified. “Tony, what on earth were you thinking?”
He hesitated for another moment before abandoning the voice and squatting down instead to be face-to-face with the kid.
First the massacre at the base, then the realisation that he was on his own, and now someone was actively after his head.
It wasn’t the portal of his nightmares, no. There wasn’t an alien army waiting on the other side as the swordsman threw Maximoff a hateful look and stepped through.
He looked exhausted, Tony realised, like he hadn’t slept at all since Tony had last seen him, despite the pillow-creases still on his face. And he hadn’t looked that hot back in Birnin Zana, either. Rhodey had said he hadn’t taken things especially well, that he hadn’t been sleeping, but… “Wilson? I know we’re not exactly bosom chums, here, but… everything OK?”
“D’you know what time it is?” Wilson snapped, sitting up in bed. “You call Jim at this hour often?” He looked as sleep-deprived as Tony felt, and there were pillow-creases on his cheek.
Tny ground his teeth, feeling the last of his patience and energy ebb away. He was exhausted, operating on practically no sleep and the last reserves of his adrenaline, and yet again, Rogers was finding him wanting in some way. “What, Steve? What do you need?” Tony snapped. “I can’t make your beloved murderbot appear from thin air, I’m trying to keep you alive until we get out of here despite you being an even more irritating version than the adult you, and you don’t listen to me when you’re like this any more than you did when you were Captain Spangles. So
"If it was one of mine, I'd be climbing the fucking walls, sure. But Laura would tell me what I'm telling you - you're of no fucking use to him this wound up. You'll only scare him even more. Get your head on straight before you see him." Barton glanced up, meeting Tony's eyes, managing a small smile. "I know it's hard. But you spoke to him, he's not in danger at the moment. So figure out what you're gonna say to him, because running in there like this will just make it worse."
“Yeah.” However advanced Wakanda might be, drug delivery mechanisms hadn’t changed much in several hundred years and they still stuck to the tried and tested oral, intravenous, or gaseous routes (no magical Star Trek wand-waving). If Steve was down to the oral option of syrupy mixtures, it was a good sign the IV were hopefully behind them. Tony glanced down at the face mask propped on the pillow and carefully positioned it so it was easily accessible. “Have you used the mask yet?”
He rested his hands against Rhodey’s back, feeling the smooth movement of his ribs and spine, and said nothing.
He didn’t want to listen to all of it in sequence, not if it was a mission briefing. Not when he’d already gathered all the data he needed from the hard copy.
Mordo was by the crates, and they’d been away less than an hour. But the bracelets were off. The bracelets were
“You said a bad word,” Steve whispered, pale and miserable where he’d hurriedly stood and grabbed a hold of Tony’s leg, and Tony -
He couldn’t mend fences with her the way he had with Barton. There was no earlier friendship to refer to, just more of the same: the same lies, the same mistrust, the same wariness of each other as if they were predators forced to share living space.
And yes, that was adult!Steve being ever so briefly accessed by the conjunction of proximity to the mind stone as well as the portal opening. Anyone placing any bets on how well that's received, given everything?
It hit the swordsman dead-on - and glanced off the energy shield he’d raised instinctively, bouncing upwards to punch a hole straight through the ceiling, all the way up through the roof.
“To all of it," Wilson cut in, undeterred. "To any of it. OK? You’re allowed to say no. The two of you - look, you may be able to resolve this, or maybe not. But he’s in no condition to discuss any of it with you, and you’re under no obligation to stick with him when you haven’t had your say. It’s probably not doing either of you any favours, to be honest. And I don’t think that ‘no’ is in either Nat’s or Barton’s vocabulary, given their backgrounds, so… I’m saying it.”
Still. The kid had been having nightmares even before he’d narrowly escaped being shish-kebabed, and now he kept Tony in his line of sight at all times. Was that normal? And his play, that didn’t quite seem right, either. Barton had brought across some toys along with the crayons and other art supplies, but Steve hadn’t shown any special inclination to investigate them until Tony had upended the entire box that morning in an effort to find something to keep him occupied. There were Legos, and marbles, a baseball and catcher’s mitt, something else that seemed designed to just make noise (honestly, Barton’s kids were getting their very own drum kits the moment this whole mess was resolved) and Steve had dutifully looked at them all and then… tidied them.
Mordo sighed. “All right. Well… two of the places of power for magic-users were attacked by followers of an entity they wished to give dominion over our dimension. I was one of those defending it. We were - eventually - successful in repelling the attack. However, the existing defences were significantly damaged. I believe that this temporary weakness is what has prompted these new attacks.” He spread his hands. “It is difficult to explain. The entity - he is called Dormammu - is immensely powerful in his realm. Allowing him access to our dimension would have ended life here.”
“Steve’s gonna be fine,” Rhodey said in the short silence. He managed a smile, scrubbing a hand over his face. “I know it sounds serious, but it’s just a precaution, okay? You did good with him. You’ll see.”
He looked back down at the small form on the bed and swallowed hard, remembering the small bed with its Iron Man bed sheets and the box of toys left in the living room. Everything a growing child could want (and probably the least that could be expected a king’s hospitality). Wouldn’t Pepper have done the same if Tony had ever had Harley over to stay? Wouldn’t he have come back to the Tower to find a playroom made up, and meals arranged, and Harley’s mom’s number programmed into his speed-dial?
At that, Rhodey flushed a little. “Physio,” he said under his breath. “The flight was… not the best experience.”
(Steve’s knuckles were white, Tony realised suddenly. His knuckles were white because he was clinging so tightly to Tony’s leg, using all his strength to hold on. Because Tony had kicked the chair away and now, now -)
He forced himself to unclench his fists and breathe out slowly. It wasn't bad advice, per se. He looked back at Barton, at the tense line of his shoulders and the careful way his hands cradled the controls. He remembered the frantic movement of Barton’s eyes when he’d been under Mordo’s spell; wondered just how much it had cost Barton to put all his worry and panic and pain to one side and wrap his arms around his kids and smile as if he meant it.
Barnes looked at him out of the corner of his eye. “He’s not coming at all, kid. This is just a precaution. It’s…” he seemed to struggle for the right words for a moment before inspiration hit. “It’s misdirection. He’s headed in the opposite direction.” He managed to make eye contact for a second before looking away again.
“Close the door on your way out,” he says abruptly, attention back on the worktop screensaver. (Not that Rogers will know it's a screensaver. For all he knows, it's a new weapons system.)
No, Tony had no illusions about Steve’s mental health. He’d known exactly what to expect if Steve was remembering things disturbing enough to scare away Vision.
“Yeah. Good to see you.” They shook hands briefly. Hill raised an eyebrow at Barnes. “And you must be… Tony’s old bodyguard. Ms Potts mentioned you’d rejoined the team. Joe, right?”
My God, that’s fantastic news.” It was a world away from the cautious optimism he’d been nursing, and what he’d read in the spare updates FRIDAY provided. “They’re sure? Full function?”
“To kill her.” Mordo said softly. He looked away. “You are wasting time in detaining me here. All I need is the child, and I will be able to track her down.” He spread his hands and tried for a smile. “Surely we can agree that allowing her to continue is not acceptable. The child - he is a link back to he. I can use him to find her.”
Tony swallowed. He loved them more fiercely than he’d ever loved anyone in that moment, the feeling bright and hot in his chest. To know that, whatever he did, Pepper would always tell him if he was doing wrong, and Happy would always check that he was being safe, and that both of them would always, always take his side, no matter what…
with him,” he said slowly, enunciating each word as if speaking to an idiot. “He was frightened and injured and he didn't know who you were. You managed to get both of you to safety without frightening him.”
Tony grunted and carried on, cursing under his breath when he sliced his finger open. He’d had to spend about an hour inside the console, and had taken to checking in periodically on Steve’s location. “Maybe another five minutes,” he promised.
That thought had occurred to Tony as well, but he had dismissed it. “Not if I am to trust him near Steve,” he said sharply. “I need to be sure.” He shrugged. “And, after all, I did see the results. Maybe whoever is in Hong Kong could do with a first-hand account.”
“There is such a fixed point,” Mordo said from behind her, expressionless. “It is a person, now in his child state. He was caught in the flux from one of the portals several weeks ago. He has been in their care since then.”
“He didn’t go after the blood samples,” Romanoff said quietly. She looked up. “The attacker. He could have had any of the corpses. Or, if he wanted Steve specifically, he could have gone after any of the blood samples, if he was tracking the radiation. But he didn’t. Why didn’t he go after the easier target? Why not just portal in a bomb if he wanted Steve dead, why go in himself?”
Steve gulped in air, wet and pained-sounding, and twisted in Tony’s arms to bury his face against Tony’s shoulder. “‘M sorry, I didn’t mean to be a bother, I tried to be quiet, I‘m sorry -”
Steve hiccupped, turning in his sleep, distressed, and Tony reached out again instinctively, soothing away the fright. “Shhh,” he whispered in another man’s voice. “It’s OK. I have you. It’s OK.”
, Tony thought with disgust - and Mordo was sat at the table alongside everyone else. Of course, he had Wanda on one side on him and Barnes on the other, so perhaps T’Challa hadn’t entirely lost the plot.
Despite himself, Tony felt a pang of regret at his blurted words. Howard had used ‘what use is he’ whenever Tony had fallen short of his expectations somehow, or whenever his mom had forbidden him to be involved in something she didn’t approve of.
He was in Afghanistan, and Ho Yinsen’s hands were steady and capable as he worked through the night.
Well. He hadn’t always listened to him, but in this instance, with a child dependent on him… It was safer to stay put and wait for the all-clear from the doctor.
OK. Who the hell did Barton think he was, to hold him down when Tony didn’t want to be held down? When - when -
Rogers nods. “I have faith in you,” he offers after a moment. He hesitates. “I’ll talk to Rhodes. Get him to bring down your medication and some water.” He does not turn to see Tony’s face at this last betrayal; instead exiting the workshop silently, the doors opening for him just as easily as they had on his way in.
“The Dora Milaje promise a lot on other people’s behalf,” a voice said from the shadows, and Tony spun around, raising a hand to his head as the dizziness hit. “Are there any wazungu in Wakanda we will not be required to rescue?”
“Don’t ask questions you don’t want to know the answers to,” Hill said softly. She leaned back in her seat, perfectly at ease, in civvies that may as well have been a uniform.
Face still pressed against the cool table-top, he tightened his arms about his head, his heart hammering in his chest, panicked and rabbit-swift in the cage of his ribs.
“No,” Tony admitted. If he thought that T’Challa might oppose him, he would not have come. He’d have simply taken Steve and left, if it had come to that. The child had sufficiently warm clothing to be OK on a short trip, and Tony would have had FRIDAY arrange for pick-up the moment they were outside of Wakanda’s borders. He wouldn’t have liked to do it - no point in alienating absolutely everyone with a single move - but if it had come to that… no, he didn’t need T’Challa’s permission. Steve was his responsibility. “But I could do with your support. And your sister.” If he had access to Shuri and Jane Foster - and to their lab and results - they might be able to figure out what was happening. They might be able to get ahead of it.
Tony cleared his throat, trying to get his thoughts in order. A few hours ago, they’d had nothing. This wasn’t something they’d found from reviewing the security footage leading up the attack. Where had the information come from? “And how is it that you just
“No?” She let her hand drop and leaned back in her chair. “Then why are you holding your tea like that?”
He was in the hospital. His arms ached from where he’d fallen asleep on them by Steve’s bedside, still clad in his glamorous open-backed hospital gown. No one must have checked on Steve during Tony’s nap, or they would woken him, surely. And Steve -
he thought, in unconscious echo of Lang’s earlier comments. All of a sudden, he was uncomfortably aware of how pale-faced Barton was.
He ran a hand through his hair before finally admitting defeat and sitting down heavily in the nearest chair. He looked up at her. “Sorry. I just - sorry.” He waved a hand. “Have a seat, Wanda. I think I can guess why you’re here.”
Back at the quinjet, Tony was somehow unsurprised to see Romanoff in the pilot’s seat. “Fancy meeting you here,” he said. “Bored already of the outlaw lifestyle?” He thought about dumping Steve on the nearest seat and getting the suit closed, but… well, if either of them had planned to kill him, it would have been a lot easier to do that before he’d had a kid in his arms. And although he couldn’t quite stop himself from looking over his shoulder periodically, the most Barton had managed in the way of revenge had been to roll his eyes. This … was not what Tony had expected. He shifted Steve in his arms again and considered what to do.
“Máahn ōn,” Okoye said to a young, pretty woman that Tony took to be the proprietor. “Néih sīk-m̀h-sīk góng Yīngmán a?”
, Barton.” There was bitterness in his voice he made no effort to hide as he stood up too quickly, the chair toppling over with a crash.
and you’ve been thawed for three seconds and are already watching 90s sci-fi?” He could hear the shrillness in his voice, the forced levity. Barton was staring at him with a look of dawning horror on his face as he glanced between him and Barnes. Barnes was… not looking at him. But that was fine. It was
The doctor didn’t even looked at him as she tapped away at her tablet, perched on the edge of his makeshift hospital bed. “You’ve never had brain surgery before.” After a moment she relented and looked up. “Look, Dr Stark. As I said, I believe the surgery was successful and we were able to repair all the damage without any lasting effects.” She grimaced. “But there is a protocol for these things, and despite how unorthodox this entire procedure has been, I would be remiss if I were to discharge you without ensuring that you are fully recovered and able to care for yourself -
“He’s totally your boyfriend,” Tony muttered, folding his arms petulantly. He debated picking a different topic, but… well, Rhodey had come to him, after all. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
thing, this thing that had been taken away from Rhodey - this thing he hadn’t mentioned to Tony previously, had probably never intended to confess - this was not something that Tony had known about.
“No.” Rhodey shook his head. “Everything went like clockwork. The battle for Tikrit was… well, it’s rare enough to see anyone pleased to see you when you turn up wearing a US uniform overseas. To have so many so relieved…”
He couldn’t stop the panic rising at the thought of it, of having everything forced back the way it was, but with something like this between them, like a knife in the bed.
Across the room, Barton watched this all play out, expressionless. “I’ll get Nat to contact Hill and Jane Foster,” he said abruptly. “You’re… you need to stay here.” He turned to leave, tugging Barnes with him.
“Devil of a thing. She’d gone home.” Barton smiled. “And Laura, she’d just got home - to deposit Cooper there, you know, and wait for the police - and she found Lila sitting on the porch, playing. Waiting for her. You know what she said?
He looked down at himself, hesitantly plucking at the hem of the T-shirt he wore. His eyes were drawn to the sneakers with their rampant Iron Man motif, one foot edging over the other in an echo of an earlier time.
And maybe - potentially - judge for himself whether the plan his erstwhile team had put together actually had any chance of keeping the kid alive.
Vision had taken him to an entirely different part of the mountain range, to what was probably the Wakandan equivalent of a kindergarten class. At any rate, there were plenty of children there, all busy finger-painting and getting more paint on their clothes than on the paper. (Steve was mostly covered in green by this point.)
“Steve? Come on, kid, don’t do this - FRIDAY, get the heat cranked up - Steve, come on -” He half-fell out of the suit as the heating elements suddenly powered up to almost scalding, lifting Steve inside and cushioning him with his body against the icy blast that slammed into them almost immediately. “FRIDAY, where the hell is Okoye’s welcome party? She said -”
(And if they weren’t? If the highest counsel in the land considered this matter and gave their expert, professional sanction to sacrificing a child for the good of the whole world?)
His eyes slid to her and away again, taking in the tension in her frame. She clearly hadn’t entirely bought his show of acquiescence, if the tightness around her eyes was anything to go by. Well, he hadn’t held back, had he? He’d gone in for the jugular himself, both times.
Rhodey shrugged again. He wouldn’t meet Tony’s eyes. “It happens,” he said. As if it was everyday. As if it was something that just…
He hadn’t been sleeping properly - it was all either too much or too little - and he’d been clinging to Tony since Ossetia. His play had been too quiet, too fragile. His appetite had been gone, and he’d been listless for days.
Next to her, practically bouncing up and down in her excitement, Princess Shuri cut in. “No, we can’t call back later, he might be unconscious again!” At Tony’s exaggeratedly offended look, she shrugged. “Well, you do get hit on the head a lot. I keep trying to make contact, and you keep being unavailable, it is very inconvenient. Maybe you should reinforce the suit in that area?” She turned to T’Challa, smirking on Tony’s right. “Brother, I shall send you the designs for a helmet for him.”
God, Tony had missed him. “Rhodey,” he exhaled, almost a laugh. He fought the urge to drop his face in his hands. He was so
the team assessments - and Tony's tendency to build himself family is pretty obvious. Not much of a stretch for her to take one look at Tony carrying in a child Steve and immediately think, "oh, no, this is gonna be a disaster." She yeah, she takes precautions - partly by shoving the adult Steve memories at Tony, and partly by cutting him out of the loop on anything where she (correctly) guesses he'll be dead against the most strategic course of action, because it would endanger Steve.
Barton gave him an odd look, but obligingly helped him sit up, positioning the pillow behind him. “That OK? It’s Lord M’Baku.”
What other things had Rogers lied about? After Siberia, Tony had found himself combing back through their time on the team together, trying to figure out what things might have been kept from him. His parents, Barnes… what else? Fury’s fake death, of course. Tony had been told by Hill - who evidently had reason to keep him on-side, even if no one else did - and she had told him that he could contact Fury through her, through Romanoff, or through Rogers. Rogers himself hadn’t mentioned it, though, and Tony hadn’t thought further on that at the time. But it was possible that neither Rogers nor Romanoff had known that Hill had approached him.
So there’s no lozenge, there's no juice, there isn't any chair. In fact, there's really nothing he can do except hold on to the edge of his worktable and focus on keeping himself upright. He swallows, dry, and it hurts like sandpaper. “Alright,” he can hear himself say, as if from very far away. “Alright, Rogers. What you're asking is possible, yes. But there's a price for my time these days. Some of us have to pay for the roof over your head, you know. I can't just give away my time and inventions for free. And what you're asking for… it'll cost you.”
Steve blinked up at him, sweaty and miserable. “My chest hurts,” he whimpered, rubbing at his eyes with his fists.
Mordo glared at Tony. “Nor do I expect to. I will not go into the particulars of our disagreement; suffice to say that it would be beyond your comprehension. Or frame of reference. Nevertheless…” He frowned. “What do you know about the attacks in London and Hong Kong, a few months ago?”
“You have a concussion, there were some complications,” the voice said again patiently. “Hopefully all mended now. Do you remember where you are?”
His relationship with Rogers had clearly had a lot more weight in Tony’s mind than it had in Rogers’s, and Tony would do well to remember it. It was pointless to wish after something that had clearly never existed outside of Tony’s imagination. He was just missing Rhodey, that was all. He was missing Rhodey, and projecting that - and every recent clusterfuck that had landed on his head - onto a man who had, at best, tolerated him for the sake of a long con.
“He knows.” She smiled a little. “And believe it or not, I didn’t need anyone to tell me how you’d react. You’re pretty easy to read when it comes to him.”
He’d done that before, when things had been bad. In the weeks after his parents had died, he’d laid in bed and closed his eyes and told himself that as long as he didn’t get up, as long as he didn’t have to speak to anyone else, there was nothing different in his world.
He swallowed. “I need to know what we’re talking about here. No bullshit, no withheld information, no coy glances, OK? Everything.
Likely that wasn’t all of it - no way would Wilson go down that route so quickly for just a single reason - but it helped to contextualise things a little bit. Tony hadn’t even considered something like this. Had this been something that Rogers had been concerned about? But no, he hadn’t mentioned it, nothing even close to that. Surely if he’d been relaying Wilson’s concerns… no, Rogers had listed his own reservations, not Wilson’s.
“That’s - that’s right. Only, he’s not -” No, that wasn’t the right approach. He changed tack. “Can you tell me why he was so scary? Was it just the scariness of having someone else in there, or something else?”
Steve was awake and dressed by the time Tony went to collect him, the stack of signed papers from the Family Court of Birnin Zana releasing one Steven Grant Rogers into his temporary custody tucked under one arm, and Rhodey hovering near the door.
Barton looked up from the briefing pack he’d pulled into his lap. As he slid it back onto the table, Tony caught a glimpse of the photo he’d been looking at and swallowed. It was a little brown-haired girl, Lila Barton’s age, lying in a pool of blood, her face turned away from the camera.
He arrived at the coordinates on schedule, sending a quick burst of data to T'Challa before he crossed into the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast. The last thing he needed was T'Challa assuming a lack of communication from Tony amounted to a casualty and working his was down the contact list.
The eyes might be the same, but it wasn't the same Steve looking back at him. “Steve?” Tony held his breath.
“Yeah,” Barton said slowly, his expression troubled. “I know what kids are like.” He started to say something else, then seemed to think better of it, lapsing into silence.
That couldn’t have happened. Because if Steve had also been dreaming of this - if he hadn’t just dusted himself off and called it a fair price for walking away with his best friend - then, then -
Tony really, really hoped that someone was gonna have T’Challa’s back out there. Romanoff had laughed when he’d mentioned it, and raised an eyebrow at the woman by T’Challa’s side, who had apparently been inches away from a throw-down with her back in Berlin. Which… would have been a sight, no word of a lie. But he didn’t
Tony swallowed down the instinctive protest. He reached out a hand and wrapped it around Rhodey’s, rubbing at the cold skin. “So tell me.”
Maximoff did not look up from pouring out the tea into the little porcelain cups, adding thin slices of lemon to each. “Not really.” She was positioned with her back to the open windows, her hair loose around her shoulders like a veil. There was a metal bracelet around one wrist, too solid-looking to have a clasp and too narrow to have been easily put on. Tony recognised it faintly as the one she had been playing with during the briefings. She touched it nervously again, twisting it around her wrist before seeming to realise what she was doing and letting her hand drop. “I - I should have asked if you wanted tea, I mean -”
“I’m going to take us to California,” he said instead, watching Steve’s eyes widen. Yup, he recognised
Barton put up an eyebrow, looking irritated. “Are you finished? Because I actually had some stuff to discuss, if you're done with the useless hostility and cheap insinuations.”
Tony resisted the urge to rub his face. “OK. So, the change was an accident, that seems a reasonable assumption to make. So what the hell was the intention?”
Tony nudged the coffee pot in his direction. “Drink some coffee, you’re disgustingly whey-faced.” He turned to Romanoff. “Barton got mind-whammied again, FYI; if he decides to re-enact
. “He doesn't know me,” he said, finally, helplessly. “He's just grabbed on to the nearest adult. Once he's back to normal…” Rogers would put him through a wall for having witnessed him like this, Tony was fairly certain. Despite his protestations of complete transparency, Rogers had never been big on sharing even before Tony had realised he’d actively hidden the whole Winter Soldier fiasco.
“It’s not that I don’t trust you,” he told Mordo unapologetically. “It’s just that I want to make it as easy as possible for Wanda to put you down like a rabid dog if you put even a foot out of line.” Or to hold him still for long enough for Okoye and Barnes to gut him, which he was also surprisingly OK with.
The kid nodded seriously, then something very much like fear crossed his face. “But - I can stay with you, right? You can look after me? Until - until I’m grown again?” His voice trembled.
Her smile got a little wider. “A pleasure to meet you, Colonel. Dr Stark, if you and your ward are ready, I will escort you to your quarters.”
“So, what is it you needed to tell me about Maximoff?” Tony interrupted. He set the shake to one side gingerly. (It wasn’t even the green bits that he objected to. It was just… his stomach felt a trifle queasy and he didn’t really want to chance it just yet.)
Rhodey considered, watching Steve half-dozing against Tony’s shoulder, limp and compliant in his grip. “Nope, I think I’m good. I’ll wait until he’s been turned back for the rest of it.”
“Tony,” Barton said, his voice hesitant, looking between the two of them. He’d subtly angled himself so that he was incrementally closer to Tony, facing off against Barnes and Maximoff. “Look. I agree with you. It’s a shitty position. But we don’t have a better plan. This is the most heavily-defended place we can think of. We’ve bottlenecked the entrances, and we’re confident that we can funnel the attacker through to where we need him to be. Vision and Scott are being as visible as possible in Burkina, making it look like the Avengers are occupied elsewhere, and OK, Sam’s with Rhodey - he’s having those surgeries the royal surgeon offered - but Nat and T’Challa are here, as are the Dora and the Jabari guards. And us, obviously.” Barton’s voice softened. “Tony. I wouldn’t put either one of you in danger if I could help it. We just… this is the best plan we have right now. And I didn’t want - I knew if I told you, you’d suit up, and you’d - if you were on the field, if you took another hit to the head -”
On Tony’s other side, Steve managed a small giggle at this and then hid his face against Tony’s chest.
Better bombs. Smarter bombs. A larger stick with which to threaten the end of the other guy’s world.
Tony’s grip on the kid’s shoulders tightened. After everything that had happened, after every concern Tony had raised… “You left him with Barnes?”
.” He looked around the room, at the gathered ragtag Avengers and Dora Milaje, at the frowning Jabari guards. “In fact, can we please have quiet from the peanut gallery until we finish?” He turned back to the screen. “Apologies, Princess. Please, continue. The terrible, no-good plan built from your beautiful data.”
He’d wondered whether Barton would make him work for it, pretending that everything was fine and it was all one giant coincidence. “Yes?” He asked flatly, standing up. “You wanted to say something else?”
and so he had the warfarin. It was just preventative, it was fine, it was like a vitamin, really; it didn’t mean
“I’m fine, honeybear, don’t fuss. I came through surgery with flying colours and they’re just doing their post-op thing. The kid is fine; he got scared when I went down, but seems to have perked up a bit now.” He wrapped one arm around the kid and hoisted him up, as if for inspection. Steve and Rhodey eye-balled each other for a moment before Tony let Steve drop back down on the bed again. He tipped his head up inquiringly. “And you? What did the doctors say?”
The fifth time he jolted awake, he gave up and moved to sit in the chair next to Steve’s bed, his bedclothes gathered loosely around him and his hand on the child’s arm. Steve was still too thin, of course, and sleeping far too much. Tony had some vague idea that kids were supposed to get up early and be full of energy all the time; obviously Steve had a pre-existing condition, but surely he should have still had more energy than he exhibited. After all, he’d grow up to -
"FRIDAY, take a note, to be delivered in the event of my incursion being detected - I, Tony Stark, being of sound mind and - okay, you know what, that sounds like a will. Scrap that." He closed the briefing pack and tossed the tablet on the nearest chair, heading for the door. "I'll think of something on the way."
“He kept a diary,” Romanoff translated. “Or a casebook, actually. Written, and audio. He gathered it together with his observations. And his… thoughts.” She nodded at the screen. “I have extracted the mission-specific elements for us. The audio… I will share on a need to know basis.” She looked at Tony, her expression inscrutable. “Tony. I suggest listening to it all the way through.” It did not sound like a suggestion at all.
“Yes.” Tony took a deep breath, watching T’Challa carefully. “But that’s not enough. We don’t know why it’s happening, and we can’t do anything about it here. Now that Mordo is working with us and isn’t a threat to Steve, there’s no reason to stay in Jabariland.”
been under some impressive drugs, after all, so he was gonna cut himself a little bit of slack for being slower on the uptake than normal.)  But even so there was a big difference between knowing what was happening and being able to do something about it.
They reached the clinic reception area. Tony could see Wilson waiting patiently inside, a paperback open in his clasped hands. He hesitated. “I’m really glad he was there for you, Rhodey,” he said finally. “Even if he
Barton folded his arms and scowled at him. “In case you forgot, Steve’s been missing for over a day. No comms, no nothing. And then you go to get him, and then you also drop off the grid after sending a distress case with
Because he’d be damned if he’d sit around under T’Challa’s thumb (and Nat’s quiet, behind the scenes manipulations) and have Steve raised by committee. It was bad enough that he’d given way to them on so many occasions so far; any further surrenders on his part and he wouldn’t blame any of the others for assuming they just had to push to watch him buckle. He owed the kid more backbone than that when it came to his welfare.
It would have been better to argue. Better to say that Wilson’s feelings were irrelevant next to Rhodey’s. Better to say that Wilson had plenty to feel guilty about, and that helping Rhodey with his physio would probably help address some of that. “He’s not taking it well, huh,” Tony said instead, watching Rhodey slowly straight up again.
Barton had blinked at him, hand half-raised to take a bite out of one of the apples he’d filched from the fruit bowl. “What?”
“Well, it doesn’t.” He stared at his knees, reaching down to fiddle with the support on the left. Almost instinctively, Tony started to reach for him and Rhodey smacked his hand away. “It’s fine, leave it. And it
I guess it's pretty obvious that my versions of the characters have all been through pretty profound traumas and are affected by them in a variety of ways. They're all trying to fix the ruptures in the team in the best ways they know how, but that doesn't mean they have to agree on the way to proceed.
“I can’t do this,” Tony heard himself say, as if from far away, and his hand tightened around the pebble, terminating the playback.
Wanda might want to wax rhapsodic at him about how Siberia had affected Rogers - and Natasha might want him to listen to Rogers narrate it back to him in the world’s most fucked-up audiobook - but that didn’t mean he had to let himself fall for it. Especially not in the privacy of his own mind.
Tony thought, horrified. He stared at her, at the carved lines around her mouth and the childish rub at her eyes. The tea in his hand sloshed dangerously as he reached out and set the cup gently on the table.
Dr Foster and the princess would be checking in daily, which meant - he looked at his watch - sometime in the next twelve to eighteen hours, probably, assuming they did them the courtesy of taking the time difference into account. And assuming that there wasn’t anything they discovered in the meantime that needed to be shared more quickly, of course.
The image shimmered again, and Steve was in his sweatpants and a T-shirt, settling his hands on a smiling Tony’s hips, drawing him closer for a kiss.
He cast about for something to say. “Hey, so, once you’re better, I bet you’ll be able to see your Bucky again. That’d be … something, right?” That was probably the kindest way he could put it.
See him interact with Barnes? See? He was totally interacting. Nothing strange or strained here, nope.
He slid into the seat opposite her, pasted on his best smile and went straight in for the kill. “Oh, hello. I thought you’d quit. Gone back to shadier pastures. Or does SHIELD’s dental still suck? I thought you guys were all-new, cleans-whiter these days.” Steve was a warm and heavy weight in his arms and as Barton handed him over Tony settled him carefully into his lap. Not that he didn’t trust Hill, of course. But it was always helpful to have his hands free around Fury’s people.
“Bet you never thought you’d be anyone’s bogeyman,” Tony whispered into the soft hair. Steve didn’t seem inclined to answer, snuffling in his sleep and burrowing closed. Tony snorted. “Yeah, you never listened to me then, why am I even surprised.” Moving carefully, he extracted himself from beneath the kid and settled him back under the covers.
? Just a few days? Nat’s got Jane Foster looking into it, and we’re all working the problem here. Let us get a lead sorted out before we argue over who goes haring after it.”
He brought the HUD back to the table and hoisted Steve on the table to sit beside it, so that he could face him more or less eye to eye. “Hey. Yeah, it’s gonna fly again, don’t worry. Listen, I didn’t say it before, but I should have. You’ve been very brave all through this, Steve. I’m -“ The words stuck in his throat.
Pepper covered her face with her hands. “Tony. Tony, please think this through. This isn’t the same as playing the cool uncle with promising kids who have parents and guardians, OK?” She pulled her hands away and leaned forward, her expression determined. “There’s so much history there, and you - you’re not over it, I know you keep saying it’s all fine, but we can see that’s not the case. And this thing, it’s not the same thing as - as visiting with Harl and his mom, or building you-know-who his suit, or, or,” her hands sketched a shape in the air. “You know I’ll always back you, we both will, but this sort of thing, you can’t just walk away, you can’t change your mind -”
Barton scowled. “I'd forgotten how much of a dick you can be,” he muttered, then pushed his way into Tony’s space alarmingly fast, crowding Tony back against the wall. His eyes tracked the way that Tony’s body twisted instinctively at the motion, pulling Steve away and putting Tony’s unprotected back between him and Barton. Something flickered across Barton’s face at that, and his expression softened. “You were
He was taking Steve and leaving for the States. There wasn’t a much more final way to say ‘bye’ other than, well, what they’d already done to each other. OK, sure, they technically had a world to save - what was new - but, other than Steve turning back, what exactly would be the short-to-medium plan? He’d asked Pepper to set up a few things for him, and T’Challa had given Shuri a heads-up that he was headed her way, but his involvement with the team was changing -
“We could make more progress here on fixing things, if we were to try to work with Steve directly.” She hesitated. “If - if it’s because of me -”
Tony hoisted him up in his arms, all his earlier resolutions of treading lightly and carefully forgotten in his panic. “Don’t look at it, come on -” He manhandled the small body back down the corridor, ignoring Steve’s vociferous protests the entire way until he was back at the main control room.
He thought he remembered - He raised a hand carefully, checking his own forehead for any lumps or scars, then further back. He couldn’t feel anything amiss, but… maybe he’d mis-remembered. Surely surgery would leave marks, no matter how targeted the keyhole? “Is it all OK? I think I remember - there was surgery, right? Something like that? Was it OK?”
"Vision," he said abruptly. "I'll check in with T'Challa before going in, and I'll keep in contact with you throughout, FRI. I drop out of contact for more than four hours, you contact Vis and tell him where I am. You do
He could just imagine how well Barton, Barnes and Wanda would have taken someone messing with their heads.
He left Rhodey to make small-talk and hurried back into the sleeping area. Steve had managed a couple of hours of sleep, and his meds must be about due in any case.
He’d been holding out the vague hope that the kid had been too turned around by everything to have really processed what had happened, but if Steve had narrowed it down to abandonment or bereavement…
of that. Although, judging by the slow exhale Romanoff gave beside him, she’d been thinking it for some time. Tony quirked an eyebrow at her.
One of them is standing in his workshop, in contravention of every expectation of human decency and shame and, and, he's run out of expectations. “FRIDAY, take a note,” he says again, and loses his train of thought. He has his hands on his worktop and it's cool and solid beneath his touch. His grip tightens as his vision swims.
Lang didn’t wait for an answer, addressing Steve directly. “Steve? Kiddo, do you want to go with Dr Stark?”
him, and now we’re gonna go make friends?” He reached out and circled Steve’s limp wrist with his thumb and forefinger. He could span the child’s wrist easily. “It was bad enough when he was bait, and now…” They’d done it before, of course. It had worked out with Wanda, hadn’t it? No reason to think it wouldn’t work here. (He hoped.)
“Tones, lemme stop you there. There is nothing you can do to stop me from telling you when you’ve screwed up.” Rhodey’s smile grew lopsided. “I’m not gonna lie. I think you’re leaving yourself open for a world of hurt. But you already know that.”
“You could say that.” He shrugged. “It turns out my party days weren’t quite as long ago as I thought.” They’d gone for the ‘secret love child’ route - overlaid with about three different conflicting cover stories - which would keep anyone who went digging busy for quite some time. (It was always easier to use a scandal as a cover story, Tony had found; people tended to stop looking once they thought they’d found your deep, dark secret.)
Although, if this was what she did to people she liked, maybe Tony was lucky to not be in her good graces.
He took the long route back to the PICU, taking his time. The rest of the hospital looked pretty much like every hospital around the world, although the floors did look suspiciously clean. Tony was privately wondering whether Wakanda had mastered the art of forcefields, because there was no
Tony carefully moved the winter coat to the dresser and sat down in the chair beside the bed, watching the child sleep.
. “I’m not your fucking counsellor, Tony. Or Steve’s. There isn’t a magic bag of solutions I’m withholding for shits and giggles.” He sobered up abruptly. “Seriously, think about it, Tony. I get what Nat and Barton are trying to do, but trying to rush you guys into this isn’t gonna do us much good if there’s another blow-out.” He shrugged, helpless. “I - yeah, that’s it. That’s all I’ve got.” He glanced away at something off-screen. “Anyway, I better go; I should be able to go in to see Jim soon. I’ll get him to call you when he’s feeling up to it.”
He slumped on the table, bracketing his head with his arms, eyes clenched shut. Hot, prickling shame washed through him. What he was doing was unconscionable, monstrous. This was no different to Romanoff rifling through JARVIS’s data banks, or Maximoff rifling through Tony’s brain, both of them with the unerring ability to prise open his most guarded, shameful parts and bare them for all to see. He should have stopped after that first moment of hesitation, he knew that now. He should have realised what an invasion of privacy this was and backed out. Instead, he’d listened to something that…
“Alright. Well, tell Rhodey we said hello. And call at least once a week, OK? None of that making FRIDAY do it.”
Tony felt a prickling of dread crawl down his spine. Steve had been drowsy for a while; he’d woken up to meet Barton, but he’d held on to Tony the entire time, and he’d slumped pretty heavily once he’d been carried. Was he dropping off because he was finally somewhere properly warm, or… “Hey, come on now. Steve, you okay?” He tugged the blanket away. Steve’s head lolled against Tony’s shoulder, heavy-lidded and lethargic, his cheeks red and his blonde hair plastered to him with sweat. His breath came out of him in whistling little gasps, louder than it had been only a few hours ago. His lips, Tony thought, and he suddenly couldn’t breathe past the knot in his chest. His lips were tinged with blue. “Oh,
“A concussion would likely be an improvement,” Rhodey muttered. He leaned back in the chair, narrowing his eyes at Tony. “This is… not the best time for this conversation.”
“I will help,” Maximoff said after a moment. She hadn’t looked up from her clenched hands for the entire duration of the slide show. “If it was Hydra, I may recognise some of them. They may have been… it may have been someone from the programme.”
The first order of priority was opening up an emergency exit, and that meant flight, and the unibeam. The unibeam hadn’t taken any damage during the fight, so all he had to do was re-align the matrix inside the HUD, which was a five minute job. The damage to the right boot repulsor, however, was much more complicated. It hadn’t just been knocked out of alignment; the delicate filaments inside acting as the boot’s ‘nerves’ - the things that allowed Tony to adjust the boot’s position automatically inside the suit to maintain balance - had been brought too close to the repulsor and had been damaged. Strpping those back and replacing them was a fiddly, painstaking job and he was cursing his sore eyes and back by the time he finished a couple of hours later.
“Your sugar plum has far less patience for your bullshit now that they’re weaning me off the good drugs,” Rhodey said matter of factly. “Come on, out with it.”
Tony said, helpless. He wasn’t sure which of them he was addressing, but all three looked at him with those same blue eyes.
(Or maybe whatever had happened with Vision had been an unexpected spanner in the works, and he was no longer as fixed as Mordo had assumed. Maybe now that the floodgates had opened, the adult Steve would keep returning, a little longer each time, an adult mind in a child’s body, slowly breaking under the strain.)
“And yet you are my associates?” The woman said archly. She flipped her long braid back over her shoulder and nodded at the teacher. “Please, continue.” She led them through the training room and into what was probably a back office, except that it had a view of the fork in the streets outside, which…
Like hell. There was no chance this guy was here for anyone other than the kid. Not when he’d had to get through God knew how many guards to make it to this point. Now was definitely not the time to be looking for a de-escalation solution. “Sorry, not sorry,” Tony said, and fired a repulsor blast at his head.
After a long moment, Natasha seemed to relax infinitesimally. “All right. I understand.” She stood up as Tony did, and waited for him to offer his hand. “Good luck, Tony,” she said, her tone even, clasping both her hands around his, squeezing gently. “I will stay in touch.” She hesitated, then quickly reached up and pressed a kiss to his cheek as he stared at her, startled. She stepped back, reddening slightly, then tipped a small smile down at Steve, and bent to embrace him as well. “And you, Steve. Stay well.”
Well. It was something to be getting on with, anyway. “We should probably watch this thing before Barton falls asleep on us.”
Somehow, he wasn’t surprised to find Maria Hill waiting for him in the limo. Something about the arrangements had been niggling at him ever since they landed. Pepper wouldn’t have handed over the design of the cover story to just
Goddamnit, his head hurt. “Shaddup,” he mumbled, grimacing. He blinked, dragging himself back to wakefulness with an effort. The light was right in his eyes and he winced, turning away.
) rooms, Barton at his heels. “You really don’t need to follow me around everywhere,” he said to Barton, a little more mildly than he had intended. “Seriously, I'm fine.”
. Whenever he had drawn it, for whatever purpose, the drawing clearly mattered to him. He’d kept it in between the pages of his favourite book. And, for whatever reason, he hadn’t shown it to Tony.
Barton - the fucker - had probably slept like a baby while Tony and the kid were hooked up to IVs, Tony thought sourly, knowing that he was being unfair, that Barton and Lang were the ones likely to be the most affected by these images. But he had an annoyingly well-rested look on his face, and Tony... Tony wasn't in a charitable mood. He scrubbed a hand across his face, wincing at the stubble across his cheeks. “It’s not fucking SkyNet,” he said wearily.
He’d always thought Steve too young for everything put on his shoulders - had thought him ill-prepared and too green for it, for all that he’d survived combat - and now, in this state…
Wanda wasn’t messing with his mind, just displaying magical muscle. No, the push was coming from the rest of them, showing just how well they could hold the guy at a knife-edge without tipping either way.
“Yeah. There’s a lot of that going around.” Rhodey wheeled himself back to the table, Tony following repentantly in his wake.
But whether the truth of it, it was obvious that the Mind Stone was the key to it. It was fairly clear that it had allowed the temporary connection between Steve’s two states - Vision’s proximity being the only differing factor to the previous attacks - but that did not mean that they knew what would come next. Would it only happen if Vision was nearby; if so, what did ‘nearby’ equate to? And what if that connection wasn’t the equivalent of a conductor between two separate states, easily remedied by removing the child from Vision; what if it was a wrench turning a tap instead - small drips at first, but continuing drop by drop until there was a torrent? How would they cope with that?
“No, it’s just - it’s just a machine, see?” He patted the left arm. “It’s just metal. It does what I say, it’s not alive.” Although it was probably best not to explain FRIDAY until he had Steve settled and the perimeter locked down. The last thing he needed was a spooked kid running away and screaming about ghosts, or whatever old timey thing he’d assume the AI was.
He settled down with the coffee and the data packets - including, interestingly, some background briefing notes on Einstein-Rosen bridges from Jane Foster, who evidently either worked faster than anyone Tony had ever seen, or was preparing for some sit-up-and-take-notice postdoctoral work - and wrapped one of the decorative throws around his shoulders for warmth. Wakanda may have technically been an equatorial country, but Birnin Zana had quite a bit of elevation to it and the evenings were cooler than he’d like.
“It was keyhole surgery, not trepanning,” Tony said irritably. “And you should have said something the moment you guys decided on this bright idea of yours,
An hour or so later, Mordo spoke up again. “My apology is quite genuine,” he said, his voice barely a murmur above the low hum of the jet in flight. “Circumstances dictated my actions, but that does not mean that I am blind to the consequences of them. I had understood that you were sheltering your friend. I had not grasped that you viewed him as…” He faltered at the look in Tony’s eyes. “That is, that the impact would be quite so profound.” He shifted a little in his seat, stilling when Wanda’s eyes snapped to him at the movement. “Perhaps I should have tried a different approach.”
The post-op recovery time is indeed pretty fixed, and I wasn't inclined to hand-wave it away. Let's view it as an opportunity for some Tony & kid!Steve cuddles.
He couldn’t get a grip on the bastard. Every time he reached, the guy twisted away, smashing down solid hits on the joints of the armour, where he was most vulnerable. FRIDAY’s voice was a litany of damage reports in Tony’s ear as he tried to parry the sword with his suited arm, and reach under the guy’s guard with the other.
He hadn't needed the hospital, in the end. He'd taken a few heavy hits, sure, but Rogers had pulled enough of his punches that there wasn't anything broken. A couple of cracked ribs, sure, and the bruising wasn't going to fade anytime soon, but nothing requiring hospitalisation.
Tony and Nat, aaaah, OK. So, this was one of those relationships that I really had a lot of background thinking done on, and then Tony just... kept forgiving her and regretting it. There were about six versions of that before I managed to get him to a state of treading water. And Nat... I think she gets that this might be a burned bridge too far, but she also gets how effective she is with Tony, and how hard he has to work to not just fall back into old patterns. (Old patterns of affection, I guess, rather than necessarily trust - because I don't quite see trust there, although I do see affection and respect.) And she's pushing him a little, and he can see it and isn't keen on it. I think he trusts Clint more because Barton is a little less good at what he does, a little more exposed.
Dammit, Tony really didn’t want to feel sorry for the bastard. (And he didn’t. This was… it was just a twinge, that was all. Barnes got everything that was coming to him. But maybe… maybe something like this was… a bit much.)
RL is stomping on my head with big giant boots and this chapter did not want to cooperate at all. Sigh.
“I need your help,” T’Challa said without any preamble. “Captain Rogers has been off the grid for twelve hours, and he missed his designated check-in four hours ago. We have been unable to get in contact, and I fear that he may need assistance.”
Wilson blamed him, Tony blamed Wilson; and Rhodey was stuck in the middle with both of them fucking useless.
At this age, Tony estimated that Steve’s kicked puppy look was lethal at twenty paces. “Except you,” he finally amended, and then glared at the face Barton was making in the corner. “You’re more childish than the actual child, you know that?”
He liked Hill, even though she pretty much hated him. He did. And he trusted Pepper’s judgement. But… “You here to babysit me, Agent Hill?”
Tony grimaced.  “I’m fairly certain everyone in that room put a tracker or two on me,” he muttered, discomfited. He had been busy buckling Steve into the child-friendly harness when Barton had wandered back from the cockpit to check - again - on his progress. By this point, Tony was starting to feel some sympathy for all those times Jarvis had had to coral his child self anywhere by a specific time. He stood, half-turning to Barton.
I did my best to keep Tony's injuries both vaguely in line with what someone suffering bleeding in his brain as a result of a concussion would experience, and the fast healing time that Wakandan surgery seems to enjoy. (I'm also drawing a distinction between medicine and surgery - just because someone is technologically advanced doesn't mean that their medicine is, hence Steve's mostly typical experiences of interventions, but their surgery is probably a lot more refined and therefore the recovery time a lot more rapid.)
Okay, now was probably not the best time to get into that. He needed to check on the kid first, and then he’d corner Rhodey and -
A few hours later, Tony was ready to declare that the worst part of recovery was the God-awful vomiting. It had kicked in about ten minutes after he’d finished the shake (it had taken him an hour) and had yet to fuck off.
“Steve’s fine, he was chilled, but no injuries. They gave him something to put him to sleep for a bit, it’s the best thing for him. Rhodey’s fine,” Barton reassured him, shifting closer. He still had his uniform on, and a shiner of his own across his left eye. “He’s at the hospital in Birnin Zana. No one’s gunning for him, and -” his cheeks briefly heated up. “Uh, the mountain’s not exactly wheelchair accessible. Dhakiya’s staying with him.”
“I -” Tony looked back down at where the child was cuddled against his side. He’d refused to sit in a separate chair and so Tony had simply made room for him in his own, sitting tilted to one side slightly so that Steve could squeeze in against him.
Watching him go, Tony felt a stab of - something. It wasn’t quite wistfulness, and it wasn’t quite sadness, but it seemed somewhere between the two. Like an ache in a phantom limb.
“You have children holding on your legs,” Tony said, blinking. (They were also both mostly covered in green paint.)
The child turned in his sleep, blinking his way back to wakefulness and shifting under Tony’s hand. “... you’re here,” he said, soft and pleased.
“He came through the air, last time,” Steve piped up from where he was huddled in Tony’s arms. “He made a hole in the air.”
“I’ll bet. You’ve got quite the shiner.” Barton grinned at him as he pocketed the penlight, the pinched look on his face briefly fading. “Your pupils look OK, though, so you’re probably not bleeding in your brain. You had everyone worried there for a bit, you know. Okoye almost cracked an expression.”
Was he hurt? Or just frightened? Tony had more or less snapped at him when he’d put him back to bed. Hell, maybe he was just hungry. Did kids cry when they were hungry? (Babies did, sure, but when did that stop?) He had plenty of vocab at his disposal, though; wouldn’t he have asked? (Did he know to ask?)
The red light deepened, the negatives spooling out more photos, Tony’s breathing shallow and pained.
, a part of his brain whispered, as if a delay of a few days could build the trust that had never existed between them). And if none of that happened, if things continued in this holding pattern, then… then…
Rogers grimaces again, looking even more uncomfortable. “Uh. It was actually Rhodes. Ms Potts isn't… she's still not speaking to me.”
“Anyway, I don’t see why they’d bother putting trackers on you. It would have been much easier to bug the quinjet instead,” Barton threw over his shoulder.
“It is unfortunate, Mr Stark,” the swordsman said, standing over Tony’s prone form. Tony stared up at him through the cracked and distorted viewscreen of the HUD. “Your loss will be a loss to the entire world. I wish you had not made this necessary. I regret it.” Weirdly, he sounded as though he meant it, frowning down at Tony as he raised the glowy shield again -
Getting him back to the suite was a bit of a problem. If they put him in the wheelchair, he’d be able to see pretty much all of the hospital on his way out. But the hospital - like all hospitals - wouldn’t let him walk, in case he split his head open on his way out or something. Rhodey had even offered to have him in his lap (absolutely out of the question; God alone knew what that sort of weight jostling his pelvis would do when he was so soon out of hospital) and Steve had insisted that he could absolutely walk, he was feeling better, he could do it, and then Tony lost what little patience he’d had to start with and picked him up again.
, he thought with a sigh. For one thing, travelling with a small child seemed to be more complex than he’d originally envisaged; for another, Barton had left him a snippy note which simply said,
Tony swallowed down the gorge that threatened to rise. Even having seen it once in the flesh did not prepare him for or inure him to the trauma in the images.
Because it's one thing to have those in charge make a call that you disagree with, but you can live with. It's another to have that call be a nuke dropped on NYC, or a sacrifice of a child, or something equally morally abhorrent. And maybe that morally abhorrent choice is the right one (and I definitely had thoughts re: Cabin the Woods here, where I spent the entire ending yelling "Are you kidding me???" at the screen). (See also Buffy's admirable and yet entirely ridiculous choice to protect Dawn when the world was ending - it's entirely understandable. And if Giles had hit her over the head and then wrung Dawn's neck, I'd understand
M’Baku blinked at him from where he stood in the doorway, his mouth open in surprise. “Which parts?”
cheap.” Tony glared. “But go on.” He moved to sit on the hospital bed, uncomfortably aware that he hadn’t let go of the kid. And that - more to the point - the kid hadn’t let go of him either, renewing his vice-like grip on Tony’s T-shirt, even in sleep. “You had a point?”
Not much in the way of story notes this time out. I spent a good month or so going back and forth on who would accompany Tony when he went back to the US. Tony's main allies were deliberately unavailable, and I knew that Barnes would have to be along as keeping Steve safe would require some serious fire-power, but the question of Barton went all around the houses before he finally muscled his way in and said that he was doing it, so that was that. (I'd originally intended Scott to want to go back to SF so he could see his family. But actually having him stay away for that little bit longer makes more sense IMO as this fic is set immediately after Black Panther in terms of timeline.)
Something occurred to him. “Hang on. Why are you here? FRIDAY said she was calling for help.” He doubted that she’d neglect to mention to T’Challa if she’d dispatched someone separately. No, this must be the rescue he’d requested. So - since when was FRIDAY contacting Barton? Since when did FRIDAY know how to contact Barton -
Those kids had already known who Iron Man was. Hell, one of them had been clutching an Avengers lunch-box. And they'd still crawled in between stale vomit and dropped Happy Meals to get away from him. What chance did Tony have with a kid who didn't even know if he was human?
do it would be… unconscionable.” He sounded regretful, as if it had been a particularly unpleasant duty he had been forced - by conscience or by compulsion - to discharge. A duty he regretted the necessity of, if not the fulfillment of it.
The chime at the door came a couple of hours later, after Rhodey had finished up his physio and left,  and around the time Tony was starting to wonder whether he should wake up the kid for some food. It took him a moment to place it as someone requesting entrance; he was absorbed in the files and didn’t look up until the sound came a second time.
The suite of rooms wasn’t that much bigger than what had been provided for Tony and Steve, but it was much more sumptuously appointed. Clearly M’Baku did not stint when it came to providing housing - however temporary - for his king. “Your majesty. Thank you for seeing me.”
He gave up. “Right.” He leaned back in bed and let her position the pillows so his head and neck were supported. “What’s next, Nurse Ratched?”
“Good.” Tony exhaled in relief. “That’s… that’s good.” He patted Steve gently, then got back to his feet. “Vis,” he said quietly, turning away so that he could murmur in Vision’s ear, “he gets frightened easily, and he hasn’t been sleeping well. Don’t leave him on his own, OK?”
Which… no. “Rhodey, have you had someone spotting you when you’ve been doing these? Back in the US, I mean?” He had a bad feeling about this. Wilson wouldn’t have let Rhodey’s form get this disorderly; no fucking way. And the physio would observe and correct during the sessions, but if Rhodey couldn’t feel what was happening to his hips below a certain point, he’d have no way of knowing his alignment was off when he was doing his exercises at home. Wherever ‘home’ was. (Wilson’s place? Andrews base? He still didn’t have a straight answer.)
Steve was watching Barnes with a puzzled look on his face. “Bucky’s mom and dad took us to Coney Island for his birthday,” he said slowly. “I… I couldn’t go on any of the rides, because of my breathing. But we went to the shooting gallery.” He brightened. “I won a prize!”
Clearly, they would be tracking him somehow - presumably the mountain would be enough to block the signal; not even radiation could escape if you shielded it with enough rock. Dammit, he needed to talk to Jane Foster...
. “In ancient times, in a far-away country called England, there lived a boy called Arthur,” he started, his voice soft and low. “Arthur was the son of the king. But some bad men wanted to hurt Arthur, so he was sent far away to live with the king’s best friend - this OK?”
He had no fucking idea what to do with something like that. “What?” He asked again, helplessly. “I don’t understand.
The child was silent for a while. Then, “laces, and clothes, and - and tidying things.” His voice hitched. “She said - she said that her job was to look after me. And my job was to - to do the same.” He looked up at Tony.
“Dr Stark, I hope that you will be sensible and take all reasonable precautions,” the doctor said, signing off on the discharge papers with a scowl on her face. “Do not, under any circumstances, hit your head on anything. Repetitive head injury syndrome is a very real risk in your case. You should have your regular doctor examine you as soon as you are back in the US; I have taken you off the anticoagulants for the moment which means that the risk of heart attack and blood clots due to the atrial fibrillation is elevated. I recommend several weeks of restricted movements -” she rolled her eyes at Tony, who had started to pull his shoes on the moment she had signed the paperwork, “but I will settle for a promise that you will get emergency medical attention if you feel any further disturbances in your heart rhythm.”
For all they knew, it could be another Asgardian. Hadn’t SHIELD run into a who posse of them back when Thor had first come to earth? Presumably there was more than one way to come to earth.
He checked the clock. It was gone seven; Steve would need feeding before long. He stuck his head around the bedroom door. “Hey kiddo, how’s that packing going? You all ready?”
“This is so fucking adorable, I think I just threw up a little in my mouth,” a very familiar voice said from far too close.
(He couldn’t do anything here, he knew that. They were both trapped inside, waiting for the next disaster. At least if Tony had access to something other than carefully-curated consumer tech at his disposal he could try to figure out what was affecting Steve, how the bleed between the two Steves had been effected.
Tony tried to say, but he still couldn’t get his breath back. His vision swam, mottled colours crowding him. How hard had that bastard hit him? He hadn’t lost consciousness, surely… “FRIDAY, status,” he managed to gasp.
Between him and Barton, they got Steve to the medical table at the back of the quinjet, while Romanoff slid back into the pilot’s seat and got them back in the air in a hurry. There wasn’t a whole lot of useful medical equipment available - the kits were stocked primarily for battlefield medicine and trauma, and so were heavy on the bandages and medical-grade surgical glue, and light on pretty much everything else. After a lot of rifling they managed to find a couple of small canisters of albuterol, presumably for damaged airways or for post-gas exposure. He got a dose of that into Steve, bracing him against his chest so he had something to push against as he coughed and wheezed. Barton tore through the med kit until he came up with one lone packet of Tylenol probably left over from a civilian evacuation or something, and managed to convince the half-asleep Steve to get a quarter of a crushed-up tablet down him with a drink of water.
The connection was perfect, as always. The worry lines on T’Challa’s face were crystal-clear. “My apologies for waking you, Dr Stark,” the king said. “I know that it is the middle of the night in New York.”
Tony jolted awake a few hours later to the unmistakable feeling of someone pressing down on his bladder. The weight sprawled out on him shifted a little in sleep and managed to wedge a knee even more firmly into Tony’s abdomen.
“This is such a bad idea.” Tony looked down at the papers and sighed. “Well, in for a penny, right?”
He circled the Hydra base before landing. From his initial scan, it looked to be abandoned. Lead lining as well; someone didn't want prying eyes inside.
She pushed away from the door, walking slowly across the room. Tony only realised he was backing up when his back hit the far wall. Romanoff looked up at him, her expression blank. “How much did you listen to?”
Okoye stopped at a 4-storey tong-lau building at the apex of the intersecting Lai Chi Kok Road and Tong Mi Road. “This must be it. Lui Seng Chun building, yes?” The street outside was bustling with end of the day choppers and tired commuters, the neon signs already bright in the fading daylight. Okoye was frowning. “It does not look especially… holy.”
Shuri cleared her throat. “Well… I was also working on a way to restrain the sword guy’s powers, I could talk you through that…” Her eyes flickered to Maximoff. “They’re… they’re pretty similar to the bracelet…”
Mordo’s smile widened. “Something like that.” He looked at T’Challa. “She is not human. I have fought her kind before, and I recognise what she is, where she belongs. She is a grave threat which must be removed from this Dimension before she causes irreparable damage. Perhaps I should have chosen a different approach, but I did not believe that you would surrender the child to me without a fight. Was I wrong?”
Anyway, notes. Tjaila is Xhosa slang for "time to go (home)", although again I'm entirely reliant on Google and Wiki for this. Steve greatly enjoyed the finger-painting, and he is 100000% not enjoying having that followed up with Tony going away. Tony doesn't have the best feeling about this, either.
For his part, Mordo seemed to take the challenge well. “Because you do not have any choice,” he said simply. “I know her the way you would know a seraph, were one to appear, from their eyes and wings. Even the least learned among you would know the power of what you were looking at, and would tremble before it.” He spread his hands. “I do not need to have seen her to know those portals are Umar’s work. I do not know what she is doing, or why her victims are thus afflicted, but I can guess that it is to access the powers long-denied her in her current form. I cannot imagine any other motivation for her. And if she is successful - if she is able to access her full power, her original form - it would be as if Dormammu himself were here.” There were a lot of blank looks around the table. Mordo looked heavenward, as if asking for divine intervention. “Hell on earth,” he said simply for the benefit of those without a magical education. “The two of them would consume this dimension until there was not a living soul left.”
“I disagree. I needed to be sure.” Minoru looked at Okoye. “Do you still wish for me to vouch for him?”
Rhodey was silent for a long moment. “Just like that, huh,” he said finally. His voice was very soft. “Tony. Sam told me what he’d said to you. I won’t say I’m sorry to have had the surgery or any of that stuff, obviously, but…” he sighed. “I wish I’d been there.”
Steve looked up at Tony shyly and turned a little pink, shaking his head and hiding against Tony’s side instead of answering.
Tony looked at him sharply. T’Challa sounded genial enough, but it was hard to read him. To Tony’s inexpert eye he looked a little ruffled, as if he had dressed hurriedly, although he was wearing his formal robes rather than the Black Panther suit. Had he been asleep when Tony had requested to see him urgently? Or maybe he had been working in informal clothing he did not wish to be seen in.
Okoye touched his shoulder before he could step in. “Be careful,” she warned. “We do not know what he may have done.” She looked back over her shoulder, at where Minoru and Mordo were arguing, golden tendrils still wrapped around Mordo’s torso. “I will stay with them.”
“We shall all work together for the common goal,” Wanda said, with a sideways glance at the man sat next to her. Her lip curled in disgust, red sparks flying around her fingers. “No matter our own feelings.”
Barnes stirred. “We knew we could not keep him safe any other way. We would have to control the nature of the confrontation.” His face was expressionless, giving nothing away.
Tony stayed where he was, knees locked inside the armoured shell of the suit, hoping that the pain in his chest wasn’t a heart attack.
Rhodey smiled a little wanly. “He doesn’t hate you. He just doesn’t know you,” he said. “Once he figures out you’re just as big a mess as the rest of us, I’m sure he’ll love you.”
On cue, FRIDAY burst to life in his ear. The connection must have flickered as he’d explored, and he hadn’t noticed it going offline. “- the suit. Boss, Steve Rogers has left the suit. Boss, Steve Rogers -”
Steve. Tony shrugged helplessly. His heart thudded in slow percussion through his chest, low and pained, as if someone was tightening a vise around his ribs. “Quiet. I don’t know, I don’t really know… kids.”
He doesn’t know why Romanoff was so insistent on him listening to all of this. What, was this violation of Steve’s privacy supposed to make them even, somehow? Was listening to Steve be in pain supposed to
After a moment, Steve let go of his death-grip on Tony’s T-shirt and reached down to rest his hand on the page, his fingers against Tony’s. His breathing evened out.
As part of a thought exercise what felt like a million years ago, maybe, or however he was going to justify to himself wanting to both show willing and not to actually follow through. It was, he thought to himself, the team equivalent of a social nicety.
- it might be a good idea for him to try to mend some bridges with Wilson, for Rhodey’s sake. And it looked like Wilson was thinking along the same lines.
“Yes, but other than that,” Tony said irritably, folding his arms. “On a scale of one to a bag of Loki’s cats, how crazy is the crazy?”
He was likely going insane. He doesn’t know why the same thought kept coming back to him, circling around and around with perfect clarity:
” Steve said, sounding both congested and outraged at this grave injustice. He glared up at Tony, who shrugged back, and squirmed around to wave at Clint politely. “Hello, mister. I’m Steve Rogers, what’s your name?”
And his omnipresent surveillance of all threats, which extended to anyone presumably not in his immediate family. (And even that was suspect; Tony wasn’t entirely sure what his relationship with T’Challa was, but it was certainly… complicated.)
“Thank you,” Tony said again, putting the tablet down on the coffee table and offering his hand to shake.
Barton found him like that, a couple of hours later, his head hanging low on his chest as he nodded off.
Tony didn’t know this guy from Adam and wasn’t in a particular mood to be friendly. “I could do without being kept locked up like a fairy-tale princess, frankly.”
“Is it your turn to play Miss, now?” Tony asked, unable to keep the bite out of his voice. Dammit, they’d already had one briefing, and he’d counted himself damned lucky that he’d been able to keep it all together. His temper had been fraying for a while; having everyone together again so soon after the last briefing was just asking for trouble. A part of him almost welcomed the inevitable bust-up; at least then he wouldn’t feel like he was waiting around for the other shoe to drop.
“Oh, no,” Minoru held up a hand. “No, you misunderstand. I must remain here, I cannot accompany you. But - you will bring him to me, I think. When you understand.” She looked at Mordo for a moment before her gaze dropped. “The loss of life is regrettable, and you have my sympathies, and apologies, for your loss. But I see now why it was inevitable.” That same expression flickered across her face again: black, profound grief, like a wound lanced open to let the infection spill out. “It is always difficult, when it is a child.”
The house Pepper - or possibly Hill - had picked for them was a fairly luxurious-looking three-storey building, with impeccable security and boring decor. Tony vaguely recalled staying there once or twice when spending longer than a couple of days on site; generally he stayed in Malibu and commuted, but sometimes it was easier to just work through the night and grab a few hours’ sleep in on-site housing.
Tony looked down blindly at the small child cuddled against him. From this angle, he couldn’t see anything of Rogers in the small face. It could have been any child, anyone’s son…
Abruptly, the events of the last couple of days slammed back into sharp focus and Tony bolted upright in the bed, his chest clenching. They must have put him under for a bit; he’d probably been running on fumes. How long had it been? And where was the kid? “Is he okay?” Of course he wasn’t, he was in
He’d never precisely trusted her in a personal capacity, of course, but he’d previously been fairly sure she’d have his back in the field. (He’d been fairly sure of that with all of them, hadn’t he? And look how well
Yes, Tony, you did just agree to spend time with your two least-favourite people in the world, in order to help out someone you have very mixed feelings for. Congratulations on failing to think before speaking.
He walked the inside perimeter as quickly as he could, his shoulders hunched up against the cold, his footsteps quiet on the metal floor. The base was abandoned. Had been abandoned some time ago, clearly, and the signs of recent use indicated a small party, rather than a significant occupation. Some weapons, some food, and -
“Quiet as a church mouse,” Barton said, and mimed zipping his lips. He had managed to get the majority of his injuries seen to so he wasn’t walking wounded, at least, but his black eye seemed to be working itself out the natural way, complete with yellow-green blotching across half of his face. He looked like someone had taken a frying pan to his head.
,” he whispered, broken-hearted. “I keep waking up and she’s not there, and, and, I’ll be good, I’ll be
“Just like old times,” Nat said into Tony’s ear, low and intimate. Her hand closed around his wrist, fingers surreptitiously pressed into the pulse point. “You OK?”
Well, maybe the events of the last few days were to blame for Tony not catching on more quickly. He felt himself flush. “Yes, of course,” he murmured.
- when a small, cold child had waved a knife at him ineffectually in a vain attempt to defend himself against the indefensible.
Tony looked up from pulling on the suit bracelets and gaped at him. “No, he fucking can’t, get away from him with that thing! He’s seven!”
She looked at where a hard-eyed Steve was bringing down the shield on Tony’s chest, at where Barnes was wearing Obie’s face as he reached for the reactor.
Tony thought uneasily to the book placed carefully in amidst the child’s other belongings, and to what the drawing might mean.
Dropping back down at the table, Tony sighed and rubbed at his exposed hand. He was so fucking tired of all of this. “You’ll forgive me if I don’t take your word on it.”
“Let’s go with yes,” Tony said, and crossed his fingers behind his back. T’Challa had indeed been able to issue Steve with papers - Wakandan ones. In theory, of course, Steve had US citizenship. Claiming that - without revealing who he was - was something that Tony had immediately discarded as too complicated and likely to draw Ross’s attention. No, flying under the radar was preferable. If Ross tried to interfere, they had a few options open to them, starting with simply putting Steve on a diplomatic plane back to Wakanda, moving to holing up indefinitely in the Wakandan consular space that Shuri nominally headed up, and even having custody transferred to Shuri to extend diplomatic immunity. Hell, if the shit ended up hitting the fan and everything else fell apart, Tony could pull the nuclear option out of his pocket and file for adoption, and Ross could go whistle.
He couldn’t stop thinking about how small Steve was by comparison. Sure, he’d grab onto Barnes like a barnacle the moment the supersoldier was in sight, but was it the best plan? There was a reason Barnes was under; shouldn’t T’Challa have arranged for him to be made safe
. Someone he could sit down with; someone he could count on to give him good, solid advice; someone who…
Nat seemed convinced that the older Steve was somehow ‘in there somewhere’, and that he had - however temporarily - been allowed to shine back through. Barton thought that this was bullshit, and had argued fairly cogently that Steve had not looked in the least bit altered.
Steve didn't seem to have any faith in that, but at least he didn't seem to object too much to being manhandled. He simply let himself be picked up, not letting go of his ribs but curling up so his face was buried in Tony’s neck. He sobbed, wet and pained-sounding, his whole body shaking with the force of it.
, and based on that, Tony would bet money that he wouldn’t have been expecting the remnants of the Avengers to come to his rescue. No, he must have been as convinced of the finality of their sundering as Tony was.
price, then. Not just one that he can't pay; one that he can't convince others to pay on his behalf, either. Oh, Tony’s not going down the route of having Captain fucking America rob Peter to pay Paul. (Or indebt himself to T’Challa to get this from Tony.) No: with a price this high, there's no hiding it.
a sister. Although it was obvious that she was young. And - judging by her work - a one in a generation mind.
“I will leave you to talk,” M’Baku advised, hoisting his children up in his arms. The littlest said something in a language Tony didn’t understand and immediately wrapped her arms about her daddy’s neck, smearing green paint on his cheek. He nodded cordially to Vision and walked out, his arms wrapped securely around his kids.
He rubbed his thumb gently over Steve’s hand, mindful of the catheter. “Come on, kid,” he whispered. “You need to wake up, now.” He bit his lip and reached for the same incentive he’d tried before. It wasn’t even a lie, really; he’d caught Wilson’s slip, earlier. “Your pal Bucky’s gonna come see you real soon, but you gotta be awake for that, okay? You gotta get better and wake up for me.”
Even over the Accords, that hadn’t been trust, that had been… reliance that her self-interest had aligned with his position. (It really shouldn’t have come as a surprise to him that she’d switch sides; he’d been half-expecting it, after all. What could he offer her to stay with him that Rogers couldn’t provide, a thousand times over?)
-” He should have known that this was not something that would be physically possible. All he’d wanted was to make sure that someone was keeping Steve occupied during the consultation...
The child startled awake, then blinked sleepily up at him. He seemed almost happy for a moment, then caught sight of Tony’s armour and sat up. “What’s wrong?”
Tony made the mistake of glancing across at the small, earnest face peering intently at him. Steve’s hair was a floppy mess over his forehead, and he was still dressed in the red Iron Man T-shirt that had evidently been declared his favourite. (How they’d managed to get one in Jabariland, he had no idea - although he had a sneaking suspicion that Dhakiya had sent an entire care package of the child’s things the moment that Okoye had relocated them.)
None of them were exactly poster boys and girls for well-adjusted, mentally balanced individuals, anyway.
“Let’s pause on the shop talk until then, OK? I don’t want to wake the kid. It was a long flight and he hasn’t been sleeping well.”
He was back in Siberia, and Steve was straddling him. It was the Steve from his dreams, and he suddenly thought,
Tony looked at him out of the corner of his eye. Barton was still pale and washed out, and there was a thin sheen of sweat along Barton’s hairline.
Would he even know if there was a difference? He thought he remembered someone - Maximoff? - there with him during the surgery, or maybe just after… but maybe it had been a dream. Maybe he just hadn’t been able to separate out one nightmare from another.
He wasn’t ready to commit permanently, and maybe Steve would just wake up one morning and be back to his old (ha!) self. But until then, in that undefined, difficult to measure middling duration, not quite ‘short term’ and certainly not ‘long term’...
“Ah. Without wishing to speak on behalf of my sister, I am sure that can be arranged. It seems a sensible step, given we seem to have plateaued in our investigations.” T’Challa frowned. “I do have one question.”
Barnes swears in Russian. The translation is roughly bastard, fucker, and several other variations on that.
He’d probably meant it to be reassuring. But suddenly all Tony could think about was Rhodey’s face when he’d found out Tony had lied to him about the palladium poisoning; Rhodey’s face when Tony had OD’d the first, second and third time; Rhodey’s face after he’d fallen and Tony hadn’t saved him, after he’d fallen and it had been
Mordo inclined his head in acknowledgement. He seemed to find sitting next to Wanda just as distasteful - a little hypocritical, Tony thought, for someone who seemed just as much a magic user as she was. Perhaps there was more than one kind of magic, or maybe Mordo had a different beef with her?
“Did… did something happen?” Rhodey hadn’t mentioned anything, and he’d seemed okay when he’d returned, there’d been nothing in the news either, but…
Which also explains why Tony had such an atypical medical experience in Jabariland. Based on my recent re-watch, the medical facilities in the mountains were basic, at best. I'm guessing that one of the things that both T'Challa and Shuri would have felt strongly about would be to extend medical tech to the people who saved T'Challa's life, so let's assume that a Jabariland Clinic was in the process of being established when Tony et al crashed on M'Baku's doorstep.
(When he looks down, he can see his chest gaping open, the shield slicing him clean in two. Steve is watching him softly, gently, and then leaning down to press his lips to Tony’s once more.)
doctor - said that he should sit down until the feeling went away. That he should suck on lozenges if his mouth was dry. That his body would stop doing this, eventually. That he would adapt.
“Then it is decided,” T’Challa cut in. “Good. I will be glad to host both of you for as long as you need, Dr Stark, Colonel Rhodes. I believe that it is in Wakanda’s best interests if I involve myself for the hunt for this child-killer, so I will join the deployed team.” He waved a hand at the woman by Barnes’s side. “General Okoye will coordinate our efforts, and will ensure that events in Birnin Zana do not… escalate.”
Tony took a slow breath and carefully re-folded the picture, slipping it back between the pages of the book. The edges stuck out, frayed and fragile. He touched one worn corner and stood still for a moment, feeling something warm and undefinable spread through him.
“I guess it must have come as a bit of a shock,” he said slowly, pushing past the taste of bile in his throat. “But anyway, if the murderbot won’t do it, then Maximoff or Romanoff can pick up the slack. I can go talk to Jane Foster.” He swallowed and reached for the rage that seemed constantly to hover nearby, ready to be accessed. “Because if Barnes can’t deal with a kid version of his BFF, I don’t see why you guys can’t pick up the slack. It’s not like Rogers would trust me if he was himself. I - it’s not my problem.” His grip on Steve tightened, belying his words.
If whatever Rogers had to say really stuck in his craw he could always turn off the recordings; not like the real version had given him that option.
“I did nothing.” He reached up and wrapped both hands around the gauntlet. “Let go of me.” When Tony did not, his expression hardened, the familiar golden spark of his magic flickering around his wrists. “I did not harm any of them. I could have, and I did not. Let
he decided at last. He rounded the corner back to the PICU, pausing outside once again. Steve was still stretched out on the bed, tiny under the heavy hospital linen. After a minute or two, he went inside and took a seat by his bedside.
“I was lucid,” Tony agreed. “Well, OK, partly. But enough to know that someone was there.” He looked away for a moment. “You know that wasn’t OK, right? For either one of you to do. Not after everything.”
He couldn’t quite make himself believe it. Every time he drifted off, something would startle him to wakefulness and sending him stumbling from his bed to creep into Steve’s room, as if watching the rise and fall of his chest could somehow provide proof positive that he was OK, that something hadn’t gone horribly wrong.
else. Tony was not as up to speed on Dr Foster’s work as he would have liked, but he’d read enough to be able to spot her logic and train of thought easily enough. And this was… not it. He skipped ahead to some the hypotheses laid out.
“You wish to go back to Birnin Zana with him?” But T’Challa’s eyes said plainly that he knew that was not true.
Cast-iron contracts, viciously enforced NDAs and a generous pension package which would become forfeit in the face of any unwise disclosures meant that SI people didn’t talk to reporters as a general rule. If Tony turned up with a kid in tow there might be some internal gossip, but there was a much higher chance of keeping Steve’s existence a secret. Pepper would probably ensure that the seeds of Tony’s ‘distant nephew’, ‘science fair winner’, or possibly even ‘secret love child’ had been thoroughly sown before they’d even landed. If anything did leak, it would be merely embarrassing, rather than dangerous - he hoped.
