“Yes, I do,” Steve called over his shoulder.  “Just because you like a crust that you could kill a man with-”
A large, leatherbound version was placed gently in front of him.  "I'm sorry, sir, I heard you had a complaint."  Steve's head jerked up, and Tony was there, smiling the way he did when he thought he was putting one over on the world, his dark eyes dancing.  He leaned in, whispering into Steve's ear.  "I found you one with prices."
“Noble of you.” Steve rolled over, glancing at the clock.  “Want breakfast before we go down to open presents?”
“Right.  I’m…  Sure there’s a waffle under that somewhere,” Tony said, now a bit concerned.  “Should you be eating that?”
DJ was perched on the edge of the landing pad, his knees drawn up against his chest, his bare feet braced on the gleaming marble.  As Hulk peeked up over the ledge, he straightened up, his hands coming down to his sides.  "Okay?" he asked, and there was strain in his voice.  Behind him, Tony came in for an easy landing, trying not to startle either of them.  He set Steve down next to him, but didn't let him go.
"Wait," Jess asked, holding up a hand.  "This is a kink, isn't it?"  She stared at Steve, her eyes narrowed.  “Are you...  Trying to seduce your husband?”
Obie scooped up the folder from the table next to him.  He flipped through the pages Hammer had sent over, his face set in a scowl.  “Anthony.  He is not an orphan.  He was left at the Orphanage, but there’s no reason to think his parents are dead.”  He slapped the folder against his knee.  “In fact, it’s far more likely that they’re not.”
Clint stared at him, his face unreadable.  "Oui," he said at last, and Natasha hid a smile behind one slim hand.  She kicked Clint in the ankle as she passed behind him.
But things were quiet tonight, and Steve plodded forward, exhaustion tugging his shoulders down with each step.
“Right,” Tony said.  He flipped the visor down.  “I'll keep you updated.”  With a quick salute, he took off, heading for the convenient hole that Carol had left in the roof.
"So Jessica had Steve, did anyone have Tony?" Peter asked.  “No one had Tony, right?  Steve's one thing, but Tony's another thing entirely.”
Steve pushed a plate in front of him.  "Thank you."  He took the tea, and reached for the kettle.  "Sit down like a person, please, my Ma's rolling in her grave right now."
Stephen Strange stepped through the glowing portal, his feet floating for an instant in midair before he found the floor, stepping down as easily as if he was descending a staircase.  His cape swirled in his wake, caught in the wake of the portal for an instant, and then swooping forward to tangle around his legs.  He landed, light and easy and confident, and the portal behind him snapped out of existence.
“Somewhere, Cap just shuddered and he has no idea why,” Tony mused.  He leaned up against the edge of Bruce’s desk, his arms crossed over his chest.  “Question.  Why is DJ washing your dishes?”
“Probably.”  Ellen reached for her tea pot.  She poured it, her fingers steady on the hot porcelin.  “Want some?”
“Well.  You weren’t the only one who didn’t measure up,” Obie said with a wry smile. “I heard a version of it myself.”
“I’ll take that as a compliment,” Tony said.  He surged to his feet, ripping the sheet free of the pad of paper.  “Rhodey.”
“We found him,” Pepper said, stepping into his arms.  Rhodey hugged her tight, his lips gentle on the crown of her head.  “Thank God.  We found him.”
Darcy reached out, grabbing the end of the tape and ripping it free.  Clint flinched.  “Was that really necessary?” he asked as Darcy handed the tape and the shoulder bell to the girl.
Someone laughed, and Tony wasn't sure who, but it wasn't him.  He gave Steve a look.  "Strip, Rogers," he said, and, grinning, Steve peeled the glove off with one smooth motion.
Tony’s hand slid up and down DJ’s back, his head tipped to the side.  “I’ll answer your questions if you’ll answer mine,” he said.
It took him two tries, three, four, but he managed to open his eyes, blinking hard to clear them.  He didn't recognize the bed he was in, he didn't recognize the tumble of blankets and the fluffy folds of the comforter.  He didn't recognize the sheets or pillows, both in almost painful shade of blue.  The walls, brick and adorned with only a couple of framed vintage posters and a few pieces of art, could've been anywhere, any one of a thousand converted factories or warehouses scattered throughout the city.
Steven grinned.  “Don't worry, you've slipped your tech into every single corner of my life,” he said, and Tony felt an irrational rush of pride at that.  “I'm not opposed to it, it is nice to carry a whole library in my pocket.”  He carried the pot to the sink and drained the pasta, the steam curling up around his arms.  “But I like books.  There's something comforting about them, you know?  They're just the same as they used to be.  And now I've got the money and the space for them.”
“No.” Tony was already shaking his head.  “No.  Absolutely not.  I'm sure that some day, in the far flung future, you'll wear me down and browbeat me into marrying some eligible daughter of some excellent family, but today will not be that day.”
Tony could feel Pepper’s glare.  He did his best not to acknowledge it.  Or even look in her direction. “Let’s get the-”
Steve grinned down his own reflection in the gleaming countertop.  “Uh-huh,” he said, wringing out the rag.  “I take it someone tried to find a place to take DJ for dinner when he’s in town.”
“Yeah, but if we do, I wore the good underwear,” Clint said.  He grinned at Steve.  “So.  Ready?  C'mon, Cap, this cannot be the scariest thing you've done this month.”
DJ’s foot bounced against the floor of the car, thinking about that.  Steve let him, driving in easy, companionable silence.  Finally, DJ tried again.  “Lasagna?”
"That doesn't seem like a good agreement," the girl said.  She sounded stern in the way that only a teenage girl could.  "You need to not do that."
The kitchen was warm and bright, the shutters on the windows thrown open wide, and every burner on the stove going.  Clint was crouched in front of the oven, one muscular forearm balanced on his knee as he checked the contents.  Tony inhaled, savoring the scent of toasted sugar and yeast, mingling with the smell of freshly-brewed coffee and the savory tang of frying bacon.  He straightened up, shutting the oven door with a flick of one foot.  “Another five minutes,” he called, reaching for the frying pan.  “Then it’s all yours, Mrs. Parker.”
“That would be easier, but also I’m enjoying the last, declining moments of blissful ignorance,” Tony said, setting the bowl in front of him and reaching for a pair of chopsticks..  He inclined his head in a half-bow.  “Itadakimasu.”
She went on her tiptoes, her nose an inch or so from his.  "Get un-busy," she said, her teeth flashing in the sort of smile that promised violence.  She rocked back on her heels.  "I'm taking your plates."
“Not that much.”  Tony cupped his chin in one hand, his thumb sweeping across the plane of Steve’s cheek.  “You okay?”
"Definitely,” Ellen said. She cut a hard look in Jesse’s direction.  “You could’ve let me know we had a guest.”
“Me, too,” Steve said. Tony gave him a look and he shrugged.  “No.  Seriously.  I’m like one of those, you know, Great Danes who thinks he can still sit on someone’s lap.” Tony’s lips twitched, and Steve grinned.  “I’ll see a gap, and think, ‘go for it, you can fit in there, that’s totally something you can squeeze through’ and thirty seconds later, my chest is wedged between a shelf and a brick wall and my legs are just pinwheeling in midair-”
“And thank God for that, because I am absolutely incapable of putting up a front all of the time,” Tony said.  He sounded tired, and Steve ducked his head, pressing a kiss to the nape of his neck.  Tony shuddered against him.  “Don't ask me about this.”
He pried his fingers free of the doorknob, creeping forward.  Furbro popped up, his front paws tugging on one of the strings from DJ’s hoodie.  Gently, DJ pushed him back down.  “Stay,” he said, ignoring the way Furbro tried to bite him.
He paused, his head tipped to the side, a faint smile on his face as he set Steve’s bag down next to the door.  “I promise, I’m not here to wake him.”
Instead, he shifted closer, his legs sliding across the fine linen of the sheets as he curled against Tony’s back.  He was warm and solid, the rise and fall of his ribs beneath Steve’s arm comforting.  For the first time, one of these beds, too big and too soft and too foreign, seemed almost comfortable.  Cautious, wary of going too far or doing the wrong thing, Steve moved a little closer, his feet bumping against Tony’s, his face buried in the nape of Tony’s neck.  He let his eyes slide shut, inhaling the scent of Tony’s skin.
“Seriously, it's horrifying and I've already made it clear to Rhodey that I'm going to disown him if he forces us to watch that or that thing with the Heat Miser again, I have nightmares.”  He stared at the base of the tree.  There were a lot of presents there.  Unimportant presents, as they weren't for him or from him.  He nudged a few boxes to the side with his foot.  No one would notice.  “I have seen things, I have seen things and lived through things and Namor alone is reason for two thirds of my nightmares, but no.  What I have to fear when I close my eyes?”
“And in my defense, my entire apartment would fit in your penthouse bathroom, and maybe that's a little bit intimidating?” Steve pointed out.
“Which most of us have read,” Okoye amended.  “And which others are willing to judge, based in its cover.”
He went to pull away, but Steve's fingers squeezed his, tugging him in close.  “Actually, I think that's you,” he pointed out.  “I paid.  You're the one who's the freeloader.”
“Probably to keep us from interfering,” Tony said, staring at the doors as the floors rushed by as the elevator sped towards the penthouse.
Tony shook his head.  “No, he just does that.”  He gestured in Steve’s direction.  “He’s just…”  He nodded.  “Like that.”
One of his shoulders lifted in a half shrug.  "Magic," he said.  "Some asshole apparently has a hard on for making my life a living hell and turned my bot into a little boy.  We're pretty sure it wasn't supposed to be permanent, but-" He made a face.  "Dummy had other ideas.  So now we've got a kid.  Who's sometimes not a kid."
“This is-”  Tony's head dipped forward.  “This is nice.”  He looked up at the room.  “Hell, it's a much nicer wedding reception than I ever thought I'd have.”
“The last tenant had geese, so the walls were well kept, and there’s an old coop around back.”  Carol Danvers was tall and long-limbed, with broad shoulders and well-muscled arms.  She barely seemed to notice the squash vines that ran wild across the pathway that lead to the front door, stepping easily over the broad leaves.  “The garden-” She gave the heavy headed sunflowers and overgrown patches of mint a look through narrowed eyes.  “Needs help.”
“You won’t.  You need sleep,” she said, pressing the pastry into his hand.  He took it, because the alternate would be to let it fall to the floor.  “If the phone rings, we’ll get you.”
DJ had his face buried in his folded arms, his eyes bright over the tops.  “Snores,” he whispered back, sounding pleased.
“Kingyo,” Tony said, his knife slicing through the head of broccoli, separating it into neat, bite sized florets.  He rubbed a thumb across the top, testing it for firmness before he swept it all into the bowl of ice water to soak.  He chopped the stems with quick, efficient strokes.  He looked at the tablet that was propped up next to cutting board.  “C’mon, give me something hard.  You’re babying me, and I know it, and I rather resent it, I can handle it, let’s see what you got.”
“There isn’t a jury in this city that would convict me,” she said, her voice soft, almost gentle.  Stane let out a horrible, gurgling noise, his fingers locked on the wood of the bat, trying to force it away from his neck.  She smiled down at him.  “Little old lady like me.  So helpless.  So frightened.  Of course I would panic.  Who would blame me?”
He downed half the glass in a single gulp, swallowing a lot of other things down with the alcohol.  But when he set down the glass, he was able to paste a smile on his face again.  “So.  Other than bringing your smut into my home, what'd you do today?”
Incredulous, Steve looked over his shoulder.  Bucky was peering over the top of the staircase, a malevolent presence, glaring across the floor at him.  “This is my apartment,” Steve pointed out.  “This is-”  He shook his head.  “Go home, Buck, you pay rent somewhere, can you put that to good use and actually go home?”
“And we're done!”  Jan sat back on her heels, tossing her measuring tape around her neck and reaching for her notebook.  “Thank you, you were wonderful.”
Tony looked around, his eyes darting over the room, and Steve felt his shoulders go tight.  He refused to do the same, to even acknowledge how small, how dingy, how worn everything was.  How little he had to his name.
“He won’t find them, he can’t, you need to be-”  The words tangled in his head, and DJ thrust an arm forward, letting the magic flow through him, letting it spark across his skin.  “Me.  I can find them.  They have to, have to let me-”
“It’s fine,” Clint said.  He squinted at the menu that was pinned to the board beside the pantry.  “Mrs. Parker keeps us stocked with the basics.  A coin or two is well appreciated, but that’s not the first workman who’s taken his bonus in rice and flour.”
"One time?  One time, my fine ass."  He raised his hands as if in prayer.  "Please.  One day.  One day without you running face first into something trying to kill you, or starting a public pissing match with injustice, or trying to-"
There was a slight knock at the door, and Tony was too tired to turn around to see who it was.  But Sam's face lit up, his face splitting in a grin. “Look who the space cat dragged in.”
“Yes.”  Jarvis stepped aside, waving him in.  “We have one very frustrated police officer that needs to be returned to Brooklyn.”
She straightened up.  “We have a problem here?” she asked, her eyes catching on each of them in turn.  Then, with a nod, she headed for the door.  “Tomorrow, gentlemen.”  She paused, her foot on the stoop, her hand on the doorframe.  She looked back, a bright smile on her face.  “Welcome home.”
“It’s not really reassuring, no,” Steve said, but he was smiling, just a little, as he folded the note back up. “Tony-”
"Uh-huh." Steve lit the stove and shut the door.  "Well, I got some sweetbuns, bet you can find some room in your stomach for that, right?"  DJ grinned up at him, and Steve reached out, ruffling his hair.  "You need to stop coming in through the window, DJ."
“You fixed my shield.” Steve reached for it, and his hands were shaking as his fingers closed on the edges of the shield.  “Shuri.  You-”
He settled back in his chair. "Yes. There is a lot of things we didn't used to talk about." He met her eyes square on. "Like how Mrs. O'Malley up on the third floor always had a split lip or a black eye, and it wasn't because she walked into doors. Sure, folks talked about how the Ferguson kids across the block got picked up by the cops for stealing, but no one wanted to mention it's because their parents couldn't feed 'em all." He looked up, squinting into the lights. "We didn't talk about the people getting lynched down in the South. We didn't talk about how you couldn't get a job down on the docks unless you were willing to kick back half your salary to the fixer who got you the job.
But he took a step to the side, and spotted DJ, curled up on his side, hidden behind the arm of the sofa.  His eyes and nose were red, and he stared, unblinking, at the fountain.  Tony paused, one hand braced above his head on the curve of the staircase.  “Diagnostic,” he said, his voice soft.
The door to the dining room shut behind him, and Tony reached for his glass of water. “Did you fail?” he asked, his voice calm.
Franklin nodded.  “Me, too.”  He shifted, flopping face down on one of the massive beanbags.  “But it's a little creepy.  So it was nice of you to let me choose the movie, but if you don't want to watch it, we don't have to watch it.”
“You have the files from Hammer.” Tony gestured at the box of paperwork Happy had collected for him.  “Anyone who shows up?”  Tony smiled at him.  “I expect you’ll do everything possible to protect the company from…” He paused, and reached for his cup.  “Unacceptable losses.”
"Is it true?"  The boy hunched a little deeper into his sweatshirt, his shoulders coming forward, bony and hard beneath the soft fabric.  His dark eyes met Steve's without flinching, but his breathing was quick, hard.  "Are you like me?" His adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed.  "Are you gay?"  His eyes fluttered, the blinking too fast, too hard.  "Or, I mean, bi?"
Steve's eyes snapped open.  He sucked in a breath so fast that he inhaled a corner of his pillowcase and came up coughing.  “Jarvis?” He tried to lever himself upright, and failed.  “Jarvis, what's-”  He blinked at the unfamiliar room, his brain struggling to catch up.  White ceiling.  White walls.  White carpets.  Sheer white curtains layered over massive, floor to ceiling windows, letting the sunlight spill over the massive white bed piled high with piles of white linens.
“I thought you were a problem solver!” he called back, spreading his arms wide.  “Give them away!  Make people happy!  Bribe board members!  Or, you know, find a vase, Stark!”  And with that, he was to the elevators and gone.
Steve took a deep breath and let it out.  All right.  It had been a long night.  A very long night.  He was pretty sure he’d now kissed or been kissed by literally every single person at this party.  The law of averages had to favor him eventually.
“Or someone recently started getting lazy,” Ty said.  He gave his wrist a twist, letting the wine in his glass swirl almost to the rim.  “Or wanted to get me in trouble.”
Steve stepped into the hall, pulling the bedroom door shut behind him.  He was on his second lap of the house and his third of the grounds.  He was going stir crazy, and every time he looked at the walls that surrounded the property, he felt that same prickle of unease.
“I think,” Jarvis said, cutting Peter off with his usual ruthless efficiency, “that we have done enough thinking for today.”  He paused.  “Don’t you?”
“I have some…  Friends in the police department,” Bobbi said.  “They’re not good men.  In fact, they’re gangsters with uniforms.  But they have their uses.  They’re good for getting the right information in the right ears, for the right price.  They’re good for baiting a trap.”
“Yes, the crew from Xavier's is getting their own tables,” Jan said.  “As far away from the SHIELD personnel as I could get and still be in the same room.”  She braced a hand on her hip.  “And the Asgardians are separated from the Atlanteans.”
Tony's head came up, his eyes struggling to focus on Steve.  He swayed on his feet, blinking at Steve, and Steve grabbed him by the arm, trying to steady him.  "Who's taking your station?" he repeated.
“Really big jar,” Tony agreed, ruffling his hair.  “Big enough to hold all sorts of things.”  He picked up his jacket, shrugging it into place.  “I’d bet that if you asked nicely, Steve would paint your name on it.”  He paused, looking at the tool rack.  “And really, I should get you your own-”
Clint leaned back in his chair, his arms folded behind his head.  “Oh, yeah.  She’s on board, says that if it ever comes up, we should just go for it..”
The door opened, and Okoye stepped in, a large, cloth wrapped bundle thrown over one shoulder.  She shrugged it off and held it out to Shuri.  “Nakia will follow him back to the city,” she said.  “And meet us on the main road.”
“Your website said you did-”  He paused, his eyes squeezing shut for a second.  Trip waited, amused, as he took a deep breath and forced a smile onto his face. “‘Friendship weddings?’”
Tony sighed.  “I didn’t duck quite fast enough,” he said, because all of that was entirely true.  And entirely unrelated to the tattoo on his shoulder, but that was a conversation he was going to put off for as long as humanly possible.  “I’m fine.”
“My fees are reasonable and I’m very liberal in offering credit,” Sam said.  “I’ll be down in ten.  Have coffee.”
Pepper leaned in, her spectacles catching the pale light.  “You’re late,” she said, in a bare whisper.  Her face was pale, her freckles standing out like bruises on her skin.  She was hugging a bundle of cloth to her chest.  “Dinner-”
Steve shoved the vase at Tony.  “Here,” he said, because that was what came to his lips, drowning out the the words he wanted to say, the words he was desperate to say, all those words flooding his mind, filling his throat, the words of affection, of need, of love, and he tried again.  “Here.”
Steve sucked in a breath, his body swaying towards Tony's for an instant.  Tony steadied him, a hand catching Steve's shoulder, resting easily on the fabric, warm from his body.  Steve glanced up.  "Glad someone thinks so," he said, with a wry smile.  His hand came up, covering Tony's.  "I'm just going to smile and look pretty, okay?"
“That's good, too.”  Tony glanced back at the workbench.  The schematic hung there, a menacing presence even in its wireframe model form, and he'd never hated anything as much as he hated that empty shell in that moment.
Val's head went down over the plating in front of her.  Her shoulders were hunched, her body tucked in tight.  “He's not hurting me,” she said, her voice quiet.
“I know where you keep stuff, and the drunks'll wait for you,” Peter said.  He braced his arms on the counter.  “I'm really good at distracting drunks.”
She sounded smug.  Which was, really, kind of unusual.  Ellen pushed the pillow away from her face, holding up the photo in front of her.  It took her eyes a very long time to focus.
"If this is going to be six months of you complaining of 'thirst,'" Sam said, making finger quotes around the words, "I think I'll be better off without you."  He considered the door.  “So, how are you going to deal with this?”
“But the workers of the old magics respond to no one, unless it is convenient for them.” T’Challa made a humming noise under his breath.  “Sadly, that may mean that they will not respond to me, either.”
Jarvis's head tipped back, his eyes narrowed in consideration.  He reached out and straightened the silk square in Tony's pocket, his fingers flicking the fabric into place. "Always, sir," he said, a faint smile hovering at the corners of his mouth.  He took a step back, slipping his watch from his pocket.  "And right on time."
“Yes,” Steve agreed.  “It's very early.  Usually, he would still be at the restaurant, right?”  DJ nodded again.  “But he's sick.  So today, he had to go to bed early.”  Another nod, but DJ was avoiding his eyes now, staring down at the tabletop.  Steve cast about, trying to find something comforting to say.  “Want to see?”
It was such an idle threat, but it was strangely comforting.  Steve dropped his head, staring down at his hands.  They were shaking, and he let his eyes close.   "I might've done this on purpose."
Steve nodded.  “I will, just-”  He looked at the back door.  “Just going to do a quick walk around the grounds.  I thought...”  He stopped.  “I thought I saw something moving out by the greenhouse.”
All in in, the girl was the safest choice, even though it looked like she was barely out of high school, with curly dark hair that bounced around her shoulders and a nose covered in freckles.  She was wearing an oversized witch hat in a truly appalling shade of yellow.  It read “Staff” across the front of the hat in the same ‘wacky’ font that all the signs used.  “Do they make you wear that hat?” Tony asked, unable to tear his gaze off of it.
He remembered falling, remembered bracing himself for the impact, for what he knew was coming and then he hit, hard and fast and with enough force to drive the breath out of him. He hung there for an instant, his body a live wire of pain, and then it was over, and he was on his back, he was upside down and sideways and there was something very hard digging into his ribs.
Steve gave him a reassuring smile, and took a determined step forward.  Tony’s hand caught his elbow, dragging him to a stop.  “We’ll be right there,” he called to DJ, his eyes locked on Steve’s face.  “Give us a second, okay, buddy?”
“And either they’ve got someone else to open the gate, or they never needed anyone to open the gate.  All he knows is that he’s at the literal scene of the crime, and if anyone sees him coming or going from that spot, he’ll be caught red handed.  So now he’s got two choices.  Cut his losses and go help put out the fire he started and hope that doesn’t come back on him, or to see if whoever he was supposed to let into the grounds is still here.”
Pepper grinned at him as she strode back around Hammer's desk to sink into his creaky, off-balance visitor's chair.  "Then he'll fit right in with the rest of the household, won't he?" she said, making Rhodey laugh.  She settled in, crossing her legs at the ankles.  "Honestly, Rhodey, we're walking a very fine line here, so-"
“Is boring, and so is math,” Tony said, just to see the scandalized look that crossed Peter’s face.  He hid a smile behind his coffee cup.  “Boring, Parker.  You’re boring the child.  He could be building something now.  He could be DESTROYING something now, and instead-” Tony picked up a piece of paper at random and threw it in the air.  It was more satisfying than it should’ve been. “Math.”
“I have come to meet your son, and he is as delightful a child as one could imagine,” Thor said.  He held the shoes over his head, frowning at them.  “These are horrible.”
“Yeah, I saw your YouTube video,” Allison said.  “The statement you gave me this morning played well, in case you were worried.”
“So many things,” Tony said, scowling down at his plans.  “Among other things, whoever approved this is an idiot and deserves to be fired.”
“What's to set up?” Tony asked.  “Steal a sheet from the laundry room, ask that damn cook of ours to wrap a few sandwiches in butcher paper, grab some bottles of soda from the icebox.  He can run around and you can, I don't know, what did my father do when we did this?”  he scrubbed a hand through his hair, trying to remember if his father had ever shown up for the picnics his mother had thrown on the back lawn from time to time.  “Read the newspaper?”
And the thoughts going through his head were the exact opposite of behaving.  Tony peeled Steve's arm away from his waist, ignoring the dirty, filthy, horny part of his brain.  It was hard.  That was a pretty big part.  "Buying the whole country."
Tony realized his mouth was hanging open, and made an effort to close it.  “Did you just-" He looked over his shoulder.  He hadn't heard the elevator.  "Did you just run up the stairs?"  He felt exhausted just saying the words.  Steve was an exhausting person.
Someone, perhaps Steve, had set the bed to rights, tipping the frame back into place and settling the mattress on top of it.  Furbro was sleeping against the pillows, the tip of his tail flicking against the linens.  Tony paused to give the cat a scratch, and he arched up against Tony’s hand with a pleased noise.
“It doesn’t,” she agreed.   “Because he taught my nephew how to slide down the stairs on an antique tray, and make as much noise as possible the entire way.”  She straightened up.   “Boys!” she called, cutting the apple apart.  “The floor will wait.  Come have a snack.”
“My mother may have taken to her bed in hysterics,” Jan allowed, her eyes rolling up toward the ceiling.  “Which my father blamed on me.”
Clea folded her hands in her lap.  “He’s trying to grow into his potential, and that is holding him back.  He won’t risk losing you.  But there is a problem, when a child feels that they must hide who they are.  That they must pretend to be something else.  Conditional love is just that.  Conditional.
DJ’s hands stilled.  “No,” he said.  He looked at Tony, a faint smile on his face.  “You’ll go looking for her.”
Tony glanced in his direction, and regretted it.  “You couldn’t even manage pants?” he asked, finding the bacon at last.  He plucked a perfectly crisp piece from the top of the pile, and waved it in Clint’s direction.  “I mean.  You couldn’t manage pants.”
DJ's head came up first, emerging from a pile of blankets.  He blinked owlishly at Steve, his face scrunched up, and Steve smiled at him.  “Morning, lazybot,” he said.  DJ yawned and tried to sit up, slipping off the edge of the couch to land on the ground with a thump.
“My house did not-”  he started, before Clint slapped a ‘Tourist’ nametag on his cape.  “Excuse me, I think that-”
“I lose keys, they’re small and unimportant, but so were you,  the point is, you should have been polite enough to stay where you were put and not ended up wandering around the house and touching things, touching everything, it’s just unconscionable, your fingerprints are on-” Tony waved a wild hand at the library.  “Everything.”
Jarvis nodded.  “Good.  Everyone is fine.  You were the only one who was injured, and you will recover, in short order.” He set the tray down on the table, the movements smooth and efficient.  He looked up, and smiled, just a little, a slight flex to his lips.  “Everyone is fine.”
Tony looked at the room.  It was large and airy, with big windows that looked out into the gardens below, the panes of glass sheltered by the heavy limbs of the oldest oak tree on the grounds.  The huge, four poster bed was covered in what seemed like a mile of snowy white linens, and the beautiful, ornate furniture matched the hand painted wallpaper perfectly.
“Morning, Chef!” Peter came bouncing through the kitchen door, fastening his jacket as he skidded across the floor.  He grinned at them, his brown hair flopping over his forehead.  “Bruce said to check with you for prep today?”
“Unresolved sexual tension.”  Jessica’s teeth sank into a stick of celery, giving it a brutal twist. “One of these days, one of them is going to figure out that threeways are a thing and I will have 98% less problems in my life.”
“No, you’re not,” Steve said.  He walked around the desk, and leaned over.  Tony met him halfway, the kiss a gentle brush of lips. “Or I’m going to teach him about collective bargaining and labor strikes.”
“I know,” DJ said, hopping off of his stool.  He grabbed his tablet, tucking it under his arm before he crossed to the cabinet where they kept his backpacket.
Clint groaned, his eyes rolling up towards the ceiling.  “Stark.  Seriously.  No.  No one respects you, because you hate everyone who respects you.  You-” He spread his hands.  “Hate them.”
Whatever that thing was, it wasn't suited for New York.  No matter who had made it, it was alien here, it was a lumbering, brightly colored menace.
Steve rolled to the edge of the bed, doing his best not to jostle Tony any more than was absolutely necessary.  “Stay here,” he said.  “I’ll get the coffee going.”
Steve spun to face the new threat, his shield coming up in front of him.  The man who stepped out of the shadows was tall and lean, dressed in an expensive looking coat and well-tailored suit.  The fog swirled around his polished shoes, and one gloved hand reached up, adjusting the angle of his hat.
“Oh, yes, very different from two or three naps I took here on the couch,” Tony said.  He'd spent all day sleeping, and despite that, he still felt exhausted.  But the tea was helping his throat, and Steve was helping with everything else.
Pepper turned towards the door.  “You can lie to me, Tony, but don’t start believing it.  That’s…  That’s when we’re in trouble.”
Tony took the envelope, tapping it against the palm of his other hand.  “As long as there’s coffee,” he said, stepping out of the way, “it’s a gift I’ll gladly accept.”
“Right, you’re tough, but if you disappoint the child?” Rhodey smiled at him.  “I’m pretty sure the kitchen staff’s going to hogtie you and shove you in the trunk of the first car they can steal.”
“Yes, we found him, and this is Officer Rogers,” Natasha said, her head bent over her bowl.  Her spoon cut through the batter, whipping it into smooth, creamy waves. “Officer Rogers, this is Peter.  His aunt is the housekeeper here, and Peter helps in the gardens and grounds.”
“We have a service, Steve.  They bring us groceries.   There’s literally no reason to go out for a gallon of milk.  Let alone to do it three times in a week.”  Tony pulled back, just far enough to meet Steve’s eyes.  “Or was it four?”
Steve's face went blank, his eyes blinking in surprise.  But before Tony could take it back, he grinned.  “Yeah.  That sounds great, actually.”  He rolled to his feet.  “You want to order, or-”
“She ate that one first,” Carol said, an amused smile on her face.  She ripped her pastry in half and tossed part of it to Peter.  “Eat that, and keep your head down, kid.”  Looking grateful, Peter huddled down into himself, clutching the danish in both hands like a lifeline.
“Then by the power vested in me by the state of Nevada, you may kiss each other,” Elvis said, and it came just a little too late.  Steve didn’t know if he’d moved first, or if Tony had, or maybe, knowing them, they’d both jumped the gun, but by the time she said it, they were already doing it.
Tony shifted his again, and the scent of them, heady and sweet, flooded the air.  “I don't know what I'm supposed to do with these,” Tony complained.
“I hate this game, and all the players,” Steve groused as he stabbed at the elevator call button with a bit more force than was strictly necessary, and Tony struggled against a smile.
“He was selling me on your good points,” Sam said.  His shoulders rose and fell in a shrug.  “Which.  I know your good points.  But he seemed determined to highlight some of your more-” He held up his hands, index fingers and thumbs forming a box that he used to frame Steve’s face.  “Winning traits.”  He closed one eye and leaned back, as if setting up a camera angle.  “He’s pretty convincing, I’m seeing you in a whole new light.”
“By 'properly displayed,' you mean, 'when you prop it up against a wall,' right?” Carol said.  She pushed a box towards Steve, who started filling it with sketchbooks.  “How many of those do you have?”
“Right.  Your parents cut off your pocket money,” Tony interpreted, and she rolled her eyes.  “I don’t suppose this deficit has anything to do with your new hair style?”
Tony didn’t seem to notice.  He just leaned in, his chest brushing against Steve’s shoulder.  “This UI is horrible,” he said, scowling at the screen.  “What is this, did they hire a web designer who’s been in a come since 1993?  Was this put together by the owner’s second cousin for a high school class?”
“Yes,” she said, setting down a plate of pasta covered in an array of sauteed vegetables and a single,  massive meatball, then a plate piled high with garlic bread.  “Clint has everyone convinced that Tony is a very excellent Tony Stark impersonator.”
Another beat, then Peter said, “Hey?” in his most tentative voice and Tony reached for a pad of paper next to his computer keyboard.  He ripped a sheet free, crumbled it up, and threw it off camera in the general direction of Peter’s voice.
Like lightning along the length of his arm, straight to his heart, the power sizzled across his skin, lighting a hard, geometric pattern beneath his skin.  He focused on it, because he could understand that, he could feel that, the vicious strokes of an unseen pen that moved under his skin, moving straight to his breastbone.
“Maybe not, but I’m prepared,” Tony said, even as Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist, dragging him out of bed. “You’re doing nothing but moving yourself up on the murder list, Rogers.”
He slipped the watch back in his pocket.  “Our purchases will begin arriving tomorrow, so tonight we will be focused on getting the main hall decorated, the rest can wait for the time being.”
For a long moment, Happy just considered him, his face unreadable.  “I’ll let the rest of the staff know,” he said at last, and Steve could breathe again.
And just like that, Tony might as well not have existed.  Rogers turned to face Pepper, pulling his hat from his head.  “Ma'am,” he said, and for Pepper, his voice was polite and respectful.
The boy was already nodding.  “Yes, sir, Mr. Stark.  There’s a lounge not far from here, this way, please.”
On the nightstand, his phone started to vibrate, the sound painfully loud in the silence of the room.  Tony fumbled out with one hand, slapping at it with numb fingers, desperate to make the sound stop.  Mercifully, it did, and he rolled back onto his stomach, burying his face in his pillow.
“No.” Steve twisted around, setting the shield on the table.  “No.  This is-” He shook his head.  “This-  This doesn’t leave Wakanda.  This isn’t meant to be in my hands.”
“Don't,” Steve said. He stood, coming to his feet slowly and deliberately. He looked up at Tony, and a spark of life was back in his eyes now. “I understand why we're doing this. I know it has to happen. But if you try to publicly take the blame for this behind my back-”
“I suspect he does not.”  Jarvis took Steve's bag.  “However, she has been his assistant for many years now.  He is seldom surprised by her actions at this point.”  He smiled.  “He might not always approve, but he acknowledges that she has a better grasp on certain situations than he might.”
Magic and tech responded almost simultaneously, the armor snapping out, reaching out to envelop him at the same moment that reality collapsed in on him.  He twisted as he fell, a few inches at first, the carpet rushing up to meet him, and then, the carpet was gone.  The floor was gone.  The library was gone.
Miss Van Dyne followed the gesture to meet Steve's eyes and all trace of humor died a rapid death.  She stared at Steve, stone faced and disapproving.  Steve gave a quick nod, his jaw tight.  “Ma'am.”
He barely had a chance to brace himself before he was hit sideways.  He staggered, grabbing for the workbench to keep himself upright.  “I’m injured,” he pointed out, not that he expected that to change anything.
There was a moment of pause, and then Tony read aloud, “Free cookie if you don’t ask me anything about Congress.”  He made a humming sound under his breath.  “Has that worked at all?” he asked.
Tony laughed, and Steve pried one eye open, blinking at him through the soap suds dripping down his face.  Tony wiped them away with the side of one finger, his thumb rubbing Steve’s cheekbone.  “Lean over here,” he said.
Steve laughed.  “That's...  Not a glowing review,” he said, as the press conference started on the tv.  Marcy stepped up to the mike, and Steve's pulse was so loud in his ears that he couldn't quite make out what she was saying.  He took a deep breath, and another, and Pepper touched his arm.  He looked over.
“Sometimes your Auntie wants Olive Garden.” Rhodey’s voice echoed up from behind Tony.  A moment later, his hand waved into the view.  “And you love your Auntie, so you’re gonna go eat goddamn breadsticks.”
Tony sucked in a breath, and another, and it hurt, it hurt every time his chest flexed.  He looked down, at the broad swath of linen wrapped around his ribs.  He touched his side, wincing at the pressure.  Jarvis caught his wrist and pulled his hand away, his grip firm.  “Were you not?” he repeated, and it was gentler now, comforting.
Steve paused, his head tipping back. One of the third floor windows was open, and a handful of boys were clustered by the windowsill, peering down at them.  “That so?” Steve called.  He nodded towards the front door.  “Want to let us in?”
Marcy studied him.  “Even if we announce it was a bad joke,” she said, and her voice was gentle, “there's no putting the genie back in the bottle.  Even if we said it was an accident, even if started divorce proceedings today, there are always going to be those who will say that you're closeted, that you're repressed, and you thought you could pull off a secret marriage.  There will always be rumors from today forward, that you're gay, or bisexual.”
The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on the walk in the street and the passage over the river,
“Well, I’m glad you’re not drinking it,” Steve said.  He walked over, slipping the bottle from Tony’s fingers and pulling it away.  He set it on the desk, rubbing Tony’s forehead with his other hand.  Tony grumbled at him, but leaned into the touch anyway.  Steve leaned a hip on the edge of his desk, smiling down at him.  “What’s wrong?”
“And you still chose the worst of ‘em,” Bucky said, walking around Nomad, checking his tack with quick, efficient movements.  Finishing up with a glare, he moved on to Okoye’s.
Obie shook his head.  “You don’t listen to me, but you listen to them, don’t you?” he asked.  He surged to his feet, slamming his hands down on the table had enough to make the pieces shift on the board.  His broad fingers went white around the knuckles with the pressure, his shoulders hunching forward.  “You’ve always let your servants get above their station, every single one of them needs to be reminded of their place, and it should be done immediately.”  He stabbed at the chessboard, the movement short and violent.  “And if you can’t do it, I will, Tony.”
She flicked her hand to the side, and the file seemed to pop, armor after armor after amor tumbling out, like a strange, flickering chain of paper dolls.  “And some things that don’t make a single sound.”
“Abso-fucking-lutely,” Carol said with a shit eating grin.   She leaned back in her chair, her legs thrown out in front of her.  “I’m in a room full of attractive women, and all of them are giving you hell.  This is pretty much my definition of paradise.”
In the kitchen, coffee and trays of pastry were set out on the broad table top, teapot covered by a cozy, stacks of cups and plates waiting to be picked up.  May was in front of the stove, her apron tied over a simple day dress, her hair tucked away under a kerchief.  She was stirring a massive pot on the stovetop, the sugary sweet smell of cooking fruit filling the air.
“No,” Tony said. “No, Rogers, don't you, I do not boot scoot or boogie, this is unacceptable, what are you-”
He lowered the window as he rolled the car through the gate.  “Bill,” he called, and the man who had opened the gate jogged over.  Happy leaned out the window.  “This is Rogers.”  He tipped his head in Steve’s direction.  “He’s got full access, understood?”
Steve nodded.  “Well, that’s fantastic,” he said, heading to the elevator.  “Now, when some reporter asks me when you told me you loved me, I get to say, ‘well, he was naked and wrapped in a blanket, and we were walking across a parking garage.’”
She gave him a look.  “Like I told Clint.  If you're part of the marriage?  You can't collect.”  And with that, she walked around the corner and was gone.
“That I am.” Nicholas gestured at the table.  “Please.  Have a seat.” When Steve opened his mouth to object, the king pointed at the seat.  “Captain.  Sit.”
“No, pretty sure that's what you just said,” she pointed out, her voice sharp.  “That I'm a good reporter, but that my gaydar needs some re-calibration.”
Her hand lashed out, catching him by the front of the coat.  She gave a yank, and, startled, he rocked forward a single step.  Bobbi leaned in.  “Someone’s trying to kill him,” she said, her voice cutting.  “And it’s hard to miss the fact that those attempts accelerated right around the time you walked through the front door.”
Jarvis considered him, a soft, gentle smile on his face.  “Of course you are,” he said, but he let Steve reclaim his pants.  “After all, DJ is staying.” He turned his attention to folding shirts.  “He will be expecting to see you again, and I know you would not want to disappoint him.”
“I think so.  Which is why it never got published.  Clark and Duck assumed it was just a date.  Not a business agreement.”
Darcy set the container of fruit cup delicately on the cafeteria counter.  “I’m gonna need you to de-grape this,” she said.   Benito looked up, his expression disbelieving, and Darcy grinned at him.  “Grapes are nasty.”  She nudged it with one fingertip.  “Nasty.”
It was wrong, and it was right, or maybe it was both.  Steve found he didn't really care any longer.  He reached out, grabbing Tony's hand.  “Lead the way.”
Next to Clint, Phil pushed himself upright, fully conscious in an instant.  "What's the situation?" he asked, reaching for his phone.  He squinted down at the face of it.  "It's late."
Her face went blank for an instant, and Tony smiled.  “Don’t worry.  Nothing illegal, immoral or distasteful.  Unless, of course, you have opinions on coffee?”
“Yeah, you would.”  Bucky gave the stones of the hearth a kick, muttering something obscene under his breath as he swung the pot away from the fire.  “This whole thing’s coming down on our heads in the middle of the night, you know it is,” he grumbled.
"I think he's trouble.  Think I told you that already."  Clint heaved a bundle of linens into the cart.  "In fact, I'm certain I told you that already."
“Stane might be our kidnapper,” Billy parroted, his fingers closing on the money.  “I tell them that Officer Rogers told me that?”
Steve glanced at him.  “I doubt I’ll be back, Jarvis.”  He reached for the pants, but Jarvis had already turned away.
Tony let his eyes slide closed, trying not to cling to things he couldn't have, shouldn't have.  But Steve was there, beside him, full of laughter and warmth and life.  He was getting used to that.  To hearing Steve's footsteps in the hallway before the sun was even up.  To find Steve in his kitchen, with bowls of oatmeal or oversized sandwiches, braced over a copy of the newspaper or a tablet.  Steve's running shoes in the hallway next to the elevator, Steve's sweatshirt thrown over the back of the couch.  Steve stealing his remote and yelling at him about the dirty coffee cups scattered around the living room.
He knew this kitchen like the back of his hand, even if his own body felt foreign to him now.  Ignoring the words that echoed in his ears, in his head, he headed for the house, forcing himself forward, step by torturous step.
“Aaaaand I’m just going to take this now,” Wanda said, reaching for the broom, her attention on Agatha.  “Agatha-”
“I wouldn't promise them anything,” Pepper said, her voice a purr.  “You'll get distracted at some point, and then-”  She wiggled her fingers in his direction.
“It's fine,” Stark said.  “It's-  I have a clock I have always despised.  It's never run right, and more than that, it's...” His mouth went into a flat line.  “It's ugly.  It's just so ugly.”  He arched an eyebrow at DJ.  “Want to smash it?”
“We shall see, will we not?”  She paused, the blade of her knife tucked just beneath the skin of an apple.  Steve followed her gaze, his eyes narrowing as he spotted the riders coming over the horizon.  Without thinking, his hand went to his back, muscle memory taking over.  But his fingers closed on nothing but air, and he bit back a curse.
“That's what Jarvis says.” Tony considered washing, but it seemed like far too much effort.  Instead, he just propped himself up against the wall and let the water pound down on him.  “He's usually trustworthy.”
The single, shouted word boomed through the house, and Steve moved without thinking, lunging for his holster.  "DJ, stay here, stay still, Jarvis, stay with him, I'll find out-"
“Uh…”  He could almost see the expression on Peter’s face as he twisted around, considering that.  “Ninth street?”
DJ blinked at him, slow and deliberate.  "Socket wrench," he said, the words a little easier now.  He reached out, nudging the tool with one finger.  He grinned at Tony.  "Show me?"
Tony ignored that. “See, I trust you to make those choices, but we both know that when there’s money to be made for a decision, for a judgement call, then there is always going to be men who are willing to make the call that nets them the greatest reward.”  He looked at the window, and he was beautiful in profile, he was the best thing Steve had ever seen, and Steve hated him for that.  “How many of your fellow coppers are on the take, Steve?”
He stirred. “Tony?” He smoothed a hand over Tony's hair, pushing it away from his slumbering face. “I think we're home.”
“Makes Steve nervous when I don’t,” DJ said.  He blinked, his eyelashes flickering nervously against his skin.  “So I try.”
Sue was already shaking her head.  "No, no, she's-"  She waved a hand through the air.  "She's not.  We had them both tested, she doesn't even have the gene."  She looked up at Steve, a faint, strained smile floating over her features.  "But she is her brother's sister.  Even if they were rational about this-"
Instead, Sam tossed his head back and let out a whoop loud enough to send the pigeons scattering from the ground around them.  Steve let out a chuckle, relief sweeping over him.  “That was dignified,” he said, his lips twitching up.
DJ smiled back at him.  “Love you, too.”  With one more look back at them, he slipped out the bedroom door, pulling it shut behind him.
“The Russian Ballet,” Clint said.  Steve pinched the bridge of his nose.  Clint laughed.  “She can still pirouette like a champ.”
"Ah."  Stark's mouth twitched, something almost like a smile, but gone before it was fully formed.  "The war changed things."
“I love you and want to be best friends,” Darcy said to her, holding up her champagne glass.  Wanda tapped her glass of milk against it.  “Can I stay?  Are there any openings in your coven?”
“I’d say he’s your problem, but honestly, he’s very calming,” Darcy said, her hands on her hips.  “Let’s go, Drew.”
"Flowers!"  Jan came floating across the lobby, resplendent in black velvet.  The bodice was lavishly embroidered in gleaming gold thread, the skirt cut above her knees and trailing down to the floor in her wake. Pepper was right behind her.  "Who needs flowers?"
Hammer exhaled, his whole body seeming to collapse in on itself, fragile and hollow.  He nodded once, and then again.  “You’re sure.”
He paused.  “Candied the violets myself.” He reached for a towel, intending to wipe his hands, and Steve caught his wrist.  Tony froze as Steve lifted his fingers to his mouth, Steve’s lips brushing against the skin there, where the caramel dust still clung.
No one did, and the door opened easily when he gave it a tug.  In another moment, the was through the portal and inside the greenhouse.  Startled by just how easy that had been, he paused, trying to get his bearings.
“Blockbuster movies work too,” DJ offered.  “Steve brings up The Matrix when he wants to distract Dad.”
“The centerfolds, actually,” Tony said, dishing out a plate of pasta.  His stomach grumbled, and he traded Steve for the bread basket.  “God, this looks good.”
“The Amazing Hawkeye,” Clint said, swinging his bow across his shoulders and bracing his wrists on the ends, his fingers dangling down, lanky and easy.
Tony glared at her over his shoulder, but there was a smile dancing in the depths of his eyes.  "Are you quite finished?" he asked, his tone polite.
Tony leaned back into his seat, his hands folded over his stomach.  “Hello, Chefs of New York.  You’re bad at your job.”
It was ridiculous, to cling to Steve's hand like a lovesick teenager, to revel in the way that Steve's wedding ring bit into his palm.  But he did it, he allowed himself to do it, to scramble down the stairs right on Steve's heels, through the warehouse and out the door into the sunshine.  Steve shoved the remains of their meal into the trashcan beside the door, and Tony tugged on his hand.  “I'm not going to escape, so you wanna-”
“Because it was the only door you bothered to lock.” Steve reached for a knight, and paused, his fingers not quite making contact.  “Why did you lock it?”
“Keep the door locked,” he said, even as he kicked the curtain to the back room out of the way.  There was no response, and Tony turned around, leaning back into the shop.  “Did you hear-”
“Another thing you ought to be be used to,” Pepper said.  She moved another ledger onto the top of her stack. “Obie, I seem to be missing the latter half of 1930.”
"And with all due respect, I can't do anything about how people see me. That's on them. I just exist, and you put your judgments on me," Steve said, the words cutting. "And you don't matter."
Clint paused in the act of peeling a strip of duct tape free from the roll.  “Congratulations?” he said to Darcy, before ripping the tape free with his teeth.
Harris made a sound, high and sharp, and the cat jerked upright, its ears plastered flat against its sull.  “Sorry,” Harris said to it.  “Sorry, sorry, that was-” His head snapped back to DJ.  “Twenty THOUSAND?”
“Thanks,” he said, and she met his eyes, one eyebrow arched in question.  He gestured between them, awkward and stuttering.  “I know that-  That sort of thing isn’t your-”  He stopped.  “Sorry.”
She paused, her chin coming up.  “He and Peter were quite close,” she said, and there was an aching note to her voice now.  “Even before his parents passed away,. Peter was always over, always in and out of my kitchen, helping Ben with repairs, running up and down the stairs and rattling the windows.”  She smiled.  “Losing his parents was a horrible blow, never doubt it, but we loved him.   We always loved him.”
“Not right,” DJ mumbled, his fingers tight on the pamphlet.  The paper crumbled under the force of his grip.  “It’s-”  He shook his head.  “Not right.  Not-”
Steve considered fighting it.  But just like Stark, he figured that the best thing he could do was just give in.  It was undignified, but so was running full tilt away from a woman half his size.  He slipped into Thor's jacket.  It was too big in the shoulders and loose at the waist, but it came far closer to fitting than he'd thought it would.
“Did that cat just…  Wander in from the casino?” Harris asked, watching as the cat picked its way across the table, pausing a brief moment before hopping onto Agatha’s shoulder.  “Is…  Is that something that just happened?”
The bundle came apart, the stems spilling over Steve's fingers, and Tony's hands came up instinctively.  There was a rustle of leaves, a shower of petals, and then Tony found himself holding what seemed to be four or five dozen roses, the blooms brilliant against the dark fabric of his coat.
“I’m not grinning,” Steve said, and he knew it was a lie.  Tony glared at him, and Steve tried to stop smiling.  “Tony…”
When he came back, cup of coffee in hand, Rhodey was sitting at the counter, peeling a strip of pastry from the top of the croissant.  He popped it in his mouth.  “It…  It almost melts.”
Tony waved an idle hand through the air.  “It’s mine to waste,” he said, in his most insufferable voice.  “And for your insolence, there will be no tip.  Take your payment and get out.”
“Tooooo late,” Sam sing-songed.  There was a ping, and he grinned down at his phone.  “Aw, look, she added 'naked pictures of Sam' to her Amazon wishlist, now you'll know what to get her for Christmas!”
“Okay,” she said.  She maneuvered him into a chair, pushed him down.  He went without a fight, grateful that someone else was there to make the decision for him.  “The reception's still going on.  You excused yourself and then you came up here.  Jarvis called me.”
Harris smiled.  “Uh, I can’t move, can you-” His voice was soft, light, and DJ crossed the room, circling the couch to face him.  Harris settled back onto the couch, facing him now, and DJ realized the trouble.
He didn’t sleep; he never thought he would.  But it was nice to close his eyes and shut down, not to have to see or hear or feel anything.  To just let the vibrations of the car roll through him, and imagine the rumble of the tires were the repulsors.  To slip into the place where his mind was busy and his body was at rest and that was the closest he could get to peace.
“You got CLINT?” Sam asked, and Steve made a 'sorry' face at him.  Sam waved him off.  “Oh, no, don't you get involved, I know who is responsible for this.”
“I think the fact that the other party chose ‘packing his bags and leaving within the day’ is indicative of just how badly those negotiations went,” Jarvis said.  “And now we have to deal with the fallout.”
Rhodey looked at him, surprised by the lines of exhaustion that bracketed his mouth.  “Are you all right?”
“It is party planning time,” she sing-songed, and everyone else groaned.  A ball of paper came flying over the table, and she batted it away.  “I’m going to ignore that, Barton.”
He shook his head.  “He has to know that.  That even if we can’t bring him home, we’ll keep coming to him.  We’ll…  Find him.  No matter what.”
Jess’ head popped into view over Carol’s shoulder, a wicked grin on her face.  “Strategizing sexy times?” she asked, and Carol reached back, putting a hand on top of her head and pushing her back. “Nooooooooo!  You promised I could ask if they weren’t naked!”
He couldn’t do this.  Steve took a step back, and then another, putting more distance between them.  Tony’s hand came up, reaching for him, an aborted, ineffectual gesture.   An instant later, his fingers curled into his palm, and his arm fell back to his side.  Steve turned around, walking away.
“Don't worry,” Natasha said to Steve, as Clint returned to the stove with what looked like a few pounds of bacon.  “Enough hungry mouths to feed, it'll all get eaten.”
“Yes, but he has to feed Marie, Barbara, Rosalind, Ada, Rachel, Hypatia and Deathclaw,” Jarvis said.
“I understand broken plates,” Peter said, his sweeping almost melancholy.  “I have a sympathy for broken plates.” He paused, his hands stacked on the top of the broom.  “They are my only friends.”
“Ah, ‘some’ is now a concrete term of measurement, I see,” Tony said, offering his hands to DJ.  DJ grabbed them, his grip firm. “Well, then. Is it time for ‘some’ swimming?”
“Hello,” Jarvis replied, smiling back at him.  He tapped the glass gently, and DJ reached for it, taking a quick sip.  Jarvis nodded in approval. “Perhaps you should send Officer Rogers one of the drawings you did yesterday.”
The man twisted around, one hand swinging out in a wide, hard arc, and Peter had an instant to see it coming.  An instant, and then it was speeding straight for his face with all the force and speed of a cannonball.
“Third time this week,” Natasha said.  She took the spoon away from Clint.  “It's started to lose its sting.”
Sam stared at him.  “Are you-  Look, man, if you want to kiss me, for like, practice or something, that’s fine, we don’t need to do the bell thing-”
He grabbed the back of DJ’s shirt, dragging him to a stop.  “Caught you,” he managed, pressing a hand to his aching ribs.  A twinge of pain shot through his side, and he ignored it.  “What is this?  Are you here to steal all of my secrets?”
Jan peered at him over the top of her clipboard.  “I get all the fun parts of party planning, and none of the cleanup,” she said, flicking the quill at him.  “When it’s over, I get to leave.”
“Not bad, flatfoot,” Tony said, and Rogers face relaxed, just for a second, a bright, boyish smile creasing his cheeks.  It disappeared almost as quickly as it had appeared, but for some reason, it felt like a victory anyway.
“Hahahhaha no,” Tony said, and he heaved himself to his feet.  He was barely upright before the world seemed to drop out from around him, sending him stumbling backwards.  Steve caught him before he could end up on his ass.  “Okay.  That's.”  He swallowed.  “Good, that's good, thank you, can we go downstairs now?”
“Sometimes,” DJ agreed, coaxing Furbro back.  After a moment, the lizard darted to his hand and burrowed back under his sleeve.   “You knew he was there.”
Before he could go for his sword, Okoye reached out, her fingers gentle on his wrist.  “It is the others,” she said, and he nodded.
Tony mumbled something against his shoulder, his breath hot through Steve's shirt.  Steve pushed his hair back from his forehead.  "How're we feeling?"
“It's easier to follow Val's advice when it comes to, like, engines, than adult stuff,” Franklin said.  He smiled at DJ.  “But she's usually right.”
Above him, there was the shriek of stone on metal, and Callie screamed, the sound muffled against Clint's chest.  Clint jerked backwards, one hand coming up to cradle the back of her head.  “I hope that's you,” he said, even as he twisted them around, tucking her into the questionable shelter of the wall.
"The war changed a lot of things," Steve agreed.   "Which is why I am here to provide a police detail, not fix-" He waved a hand towards the plans.  "Other things."
Steve grinned at him.  “Fine, keep them.” He picked up a carton, popping open the flaps.  “What's your pleasure?”
Stark glanced up at him, his eyebrows arched.  “And I'm getting them, why?” he asked, even as he ripped the envelope open.
“Yes, yes, fine, Obie.”  He rolled to his feet, and held out a hand to DJ.  “Welcome to the Stark Mansion, young man,” he said, and DJ gave his hand a firm shake.
“So noted, sir.” Jarvis sounded amused.  Almost affectionate.  “I have started coffee in the kitchen, sir.”
The door to the chapel lobby opened, and Harris leaned out.  “Okay.  Our officiant is ready and sworn to secrecy, as much good as that’ll do, but I definitely tried and there’s no one else here, I checked, and where’s Tony Prime?”
"Yes, and nothing says romance like a surprise marriage," Tony said, saluting her with his coffee cup and a wry smile.
He paused in front of Tony, his lips a flat line.  “You were raised better than that.”  He paused.  “Were you not?”
“That is not the problem.”  Tony picked up a tablet from the desk without opening his eyes.  He held it out in Steve’s direction.  “There’s an automatic deposit into DJ’s account on the first of the month.  He’s allowed to do whatever he wants with it.”
Bucky considered him, one eyebrow arched.  "'S a shame," he said, licking some bright green guacamole off of his thumb.  "I haven't slept in, like, seventy hours, and I've got an hour 'til my next pickup."  He balanced the burrito on one palm, holding it aloft like a holy relic.  "So.  Not really feeling much sympathy for you."
“Someone had to do it,” Steve said, his voice soft, and Tony paused, his fingers just resting on the glass of the bottle.  Steve shook his head.  “It’s not…  It’s not right.  I hate it.  I hate that the only way I can do this is to take my badge off and do the things that no one else would do, because it’s not right, it’s not something anyone should have to do, but no one else-”
“Yeah?  Me, too,” Clint said, scanning the walls, hoping for a door that might lead to an access tunnel, or at the least, a reinforced utility room.  “Bad home life?”
Tony stared at him.  "No.  No...  We're not," he said, and he tried his best to sound absolutely certain about that.  Confident.  In control.  Steve tipped his head to the side, and his glasses slid down his nose.  For a second, he went crosseyed, his expression a perfect mix of amusement and befuddlement, then he pushed the glasses back up.
Slowly, carefully, Tony forced himself to his feet, his hands braced on top of his desk as he forced his knees to lock into place.  He hadn’t drank much.  Enough.  But maybe not enough.  For now, Obie wanted him alive.  Wanted him alive until he’d gotten the signatures he needed.  The longer Tony could stall, the better off he’d be.
“Hey, man, it's okay.  You're fine.”  Luke patted him gently on the shoulder.  “I'll tell her you asked about her, okay?”  He straightened up.  “And Tony had this delivered before he passed out, but it's got your name on it, so-”  Luke nodded at the envelope.  “Pretty sure it's for you.”
He was close, he was much too close, and Steve's face felt like it was on fire.  Because Stark's hands were sliding over his shoulders, down the length of his arms.  The touch was quick, efficient, impersonal.  There was nothing lingering about it, nothing sexual.  Jarvis had done almost the same thing, had been just as close.  But this was different.  This was absolutely different, because when Stark reached up, adjusting his collar, Steve could smell his cologne.
By the time dinner rolled around, he'd marshaled the entire household with what Steve was coming to recognize as his customary ruthless efficiency.  While Clint and Natasha put the food together, Jarvis had sent Bruce and Steve across the rolling lawn with planks of wood and sawhorses balanced on their shoulders.  He and May followed, carrying baskets of plates and wine glasses, thick white tablecloths cushioning the delicate crystal.
Unlike him, Natasha picked her way across the workshop with perfect grace, her feet somehow missing every fragment of metal and chunk of fractured circuitry.  She didn’t even look where she was going, her attention focused instead on the open cabinet door just to his right.  An overturned bottle hung halfway off the shelf, and half a dozen others were stacked on the counter underneath it.  One bottle lay on its side next to the sink, its cap gone, its contents drained.  “And what’re we drinking?”
“And when his aunt finds out you're teasing him again, none of us will get any pie,” Natasha said, whisking Stark's empty cup from his hand.  “Yes.  There's an apple pie and a banana cream pie in the pie cabinet.”
He smiled. "We spend all this time, watching for firsts, celebrating firsts. Know what? The firsts will take care of themselves. We need to focus on the lasts. The last case of AIDs. The last victim of domestic abuse. The last act of racial violence we tolerate. The last use of conversion therapy allowed, anywhere in the country. The last cross burning." His voice was vibrating with it, with the force of it, and he felt his hands go to fists against his thighs. "The last time anyone vandalizes a mosque, or a Jewish cemetery. The last time we, as a country, allow police brutality or sexual violence to go unnoticed, let alone unpunished."
Marjorie flipped through a notebook, her short, gleaming nails catching the light. “We're missing one?”
“Expensive for ME,” Harris said, smiling at him.  He reached out, nudging the box of cereal.  “You, uh, do you want some milk or something?”
The oven beeped, and Mackenzie reached for a potholder.  "Long night?" she asked, as she snagged the scone from the warming oven.  She dropped it into a bag and rolled the paper down before tossing it to DJ.  He caught it, the familiar weight falling into his hands the way it always did.
Shuri’s hand flopped back to her side.  “Do you see this?” she asked Steve, gesturing at Okoye.  “Do you see how I am treated?”  Without waiting for him to reply, she turned back to Okoye.  “And stop calling me highness.”  She swung her horse around Steve, putting him between her and Okoye.  She leaned forward, peering around him.  “I only agreed to come along only because here, no one knows me.”  She tossed her free hand in the air.  Her horse, calm by nature and well trained, didn’t seem to notice the twitch of her reins.  “My holiday from myself.”
“I hate you both,” Bucky yelled up to them, and Steve shimmied out of his pants.  He tossed them over his shoulder, grinning at Tony as he did it.
She held out her hand, and Furbro, now curled around her wrist, gave DJ a disgruntled look.  “Here,” she said.  “I think this is yours?”
“Just about anything involving his health or safety,” Jarvis said, his voice brisk.  He paused, just long enough to be noticeable, just long enough for Steve to wonder why, and then he turned on his heel.  "This way, please."
“A bit more information about how, exactly, you handled this,” Coulson said.  He sounded exhausted.  “The scientific forensic team is...  Displeased.”
Okoye turned her staff to the side and used it to bop both of them with one flick of her wrist.  “Idiots,” she said.  She turned back to the door.  “Take it.”  She paused, and looked back over her shoulder at Steve.  “You will need it.”  She opened the door.  “Come, your Highness.”
Smiling to himself, he headed back across the lobby towards the doors.  Outside the frosted glass, he could see the car still waiting at the curb, and his footsteps accelerated.
“Rude,” she said with a grin, taking the coffee from him.  She reached for the sugar, fluttering eyelashes in Harris’ direction.  “Look at you.  That suit is something else.”
Sam's head tilted in his direction, his teeth flashing in a grin.  “I think you have a lot of problems,” he said.
His face a dangerous shade of red, he managed to make his head move, and May held the pressure for another second before she stepped back, leaving him gasping desperately for air.  May swung the bat back and forth, time ticking away with each arc.  “Where is DJ?” she asked.
Steve twisted around, going up on his knees on the couch, bringing himself face to face and eye to eye with Tony.  Tony blinked at him, confusion sweeping over his face, and Steve leaned in.  “Why didn’t you-” He took a deep breath, and saw Tony’s eyes drop to his mouth.  “You didn’t.”
She glanced back over her shoulder at him, the fabric of her scarves fluttering in her wake.  “I won’t fall,” she said as Steve pulled up next to her, Nomad dancing in place as he slowed down.  His tail flicked through the air, and Shuri leaned over to stroke a hand over his neck.  “Oh, you poor boy, you just want to run, don’t you?”
Tony’s mouth went tight.  “Right. So this is your solution?  Spending your days upholding the system and your nights subverting it and all the while, trying to keep your head above water?”  He shook his head.  “How long until that kills you?”
“Are you trying to kill me?”  Tony picked it up anyway, tossing his phone back to the dashboard.  It never stopped buzzing.
“Do us all a favor and take some selfies,” Pepper said to Tony.  Tony stared at her.  “Something...  Affectionate.”
Exactly at eight, washed, dried and dressed, Tony walked into the shared living room, Steve right behind him.  “We’re eating breakfast before presents,” he announced.
“The household is in a bit of an uproar this morning,” Jarvis said.  “Which is not unusual, but-”  He glanced at Steve.  “Last night's events may have contributed to the current state of affairs.”
“I’ll make sure it’s still warm for you,” Clint said, and with another grateful nod, Bruce slipped back out the door and out of sight.
The silence stretched out, and Steve forced his head up, forced his eyes open.  “Sam.  I think-”  His breath seized in his throat, panic clawing at his breastbone as he forced the words out.  “I think I did this on purpose.”
Her lips twitched, something almost like a smile. "Still, my point holds, Captain, there's certain things that didn't used to be talked about in public, and I don't know why everything has to now be-" Her hands fluttered through the air as if she was attempting to ward something off. "Why everyone has to know everyone's business now."
He raised a hand, tapping his knuckles on the door, not hard, not loud, but still, Tony’s head swung in his direction.  He smiled, waving Steve in, and Steve reached for the keypad.
Clint looked at it.  “Yep.  And I bet it’s still accurate.”  He took it from DJ, and tucked it into his pocket.  “We can go and find out.”
“Have you considered that maybe you're using physical exertion and general violence to cover for deeper emotional problems in your life?” Jan asked her.
Danny held his plate out towards Luke, who gave it a look.  “What do you expect me to do with that?” he asked, gesturing with a piece of beef teriyaki.
Steve woke slowly, blinking against the early morning light.  The warm, solid body curled against his was a surprise, and achingly familiar, all at the same time.  He slid a hand up Tony’s chest, trying to memorize the feel of his skin, the sound of his breathing as he slowly started to wake.
Rhodey snorted.  “That’s rich, coming from you.” He snapped his book closed, returning it to the shelf and reaching for another. “When’s the last time that you’ve gotten more than five or six hours in a row?”
“Mostly because I was always in trouble,” Tony said.  “No matter what I did, my father found a way to disapprove of it.”
“So you said,” Tony said.  He caught Rogers' hand, dragging him in until they were almost chest to chest.  Tony canted his head up, giving Rogers a flirtatious look.  “So.  Ask.”
Thanks to @girlbehindtheglasses for donating to charity (a rather intimidating amount) to have this story written, and then for the extreme patience as it took me more than a year to actually do it.  I hope it was worth it.
"No, but you can live, and be a counterpoint to everyone who argues that to live their lives as they are will only end in misery and suffering," Cynthia pointed out.  "People don't want promises.  Kids certainly don't, because even if they get them, they know they can't always be trusted.  What they want is a chance.  A possibility."
"Of course, sir," Jarvis repeated.  He gave Stark a slight smile as he collected Steve's bag and hat from the table.  “Will there be anything else, sir?”
“He is quite well, and it is very kind of you to inquire,” Jarvis said.  He lead the way up the stairs, around the hall.  The hammering got louder as they got closer, and Steve wondered what kind of repairs they were making.  A single gunman shouldn't have been able to do that much damage, not if he'd been captured as quickly as they'd reported.
“I’m sorry,” Harris said to the girl.  “He’s usually very kind, he’s just under a lot of stress, there’s like, there’s things going on and magic freaks him out.  Usually, he’s one of the nicest people I’ve ever met.”
Steve huffed out a breath.  "Right."  He grabbed the seatbelt and buckled Tony in, and gave the belt a pat.  "There.  Let's see you get out of that."
Jarvis was silent for a moment. “I suspect you already have one, but I don’t blame you if you don’t see it the same way.”  He crossed the room, collecting the tin from the bedside table.  “I also suspected we wouldn’t be able to convince you to stay for dinner, so I brought you this.”  He held the tin out to Steve.  “It’s my mother’s recipe for gingerbread.  She made it at Christmas, and, well, that was it.” He smiled.  “Having reached my advanced age, I find I’m far more liberal with it.”
