Maybe he'd been a nuisance to Howard, but not to his mother. His mother had loved him, had wanted him, had taught him so many wonderful things in her soft, gentle way, had had to play the buffer between him and Howard for so long, had been the patient, reasonable one. He might have been a pain-in-the-ass and a burden to Howard, but to his mother…
She laughed, the sound trilling like tinkling ice. "Now, why would I do that? To what purpose? This is exactly what I meant to happen. It is what must be."
Steve swallowed. "That you— That I—"
Tony exhaled a breath and sat back against the couch. Olivia began to squawk again, and Tony once more offered her his finger. It seemed to soothe her — at least for the moment — though he knew it couldn't last very long. Poor thing was probably starving, and here he was denying her anything but a sort-of pacifier to hold her over until such time as he could feed her.
She preened a little before she took exactly two bites then set it down and began to pull the cheese off again.
"Not particularly," Steve said before he began to pull the main bulk of the highchair out of the box.
"I don't know how he fell in with you guys, but I'm glad he did. You're good people. You like him. You bring his ego down when he needs it. I'm glad he has you. I just…hope the idiot realizes what he's got."
"Whatever you want," Bruce replied then made a face. "I really should go see what's going on with our temporary boarders," he added and glanced toward the door. "I don't want to leave you alone, but—"
My treat."
"Yeah? You know what Steve's going to show up wearing, right? A pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, and a backwards baseball cap like he's some frat-boy dude-bro. You know that, right?"
at me?"
"No," he said and shook his head. He shoved half the potsticker in his mouth, and after chewing it partway said, "Tony Stark, the self-described genius, billionaire, playboy philanthropist? Yeah, she'd never let him cross into her parlor twice. Tony Stark, the neurotic mechanical engineer that wants to make the world a better place?" He smiled a little and, after swallowing the bite, said, "I can hear her now.
"Hmm? Oh," he said and went over to the coffeemaker. "It's really quite simple. Whoever told you Esmeralda was dead was full of shit. She's very much alive and very much annoying."
Tony followed after the half-track and waited for Steve to make some sort of comment about saving the jokes for later, but nothing came, and Tony called out in a slight panic, "Who's closest to Steve?"
"Your smile is your tell. The one you fake for the public is different than the one you give when you're actually happy about something. Though to tell the truth, Steve was the one that caught that, not me. It was the only time I thought he was cut out for spy work. Then I realized it was
Tony tried to, taking a deep breath and blowing it out and trying to calm himself with equations and such as the cuff tightened around his arm. He tried to ignore the feeling, tried to ignore what the doctor was doing, and just concentrate on the equations he saw floating around his head until the cuff loosened completely and the doctor said, "Good," and removed the cuff. "So far, so good. You're doing very well."
"I've told you people. I don't
Fuck, he was so gone for this man.
He shivered and swallowed, trying to shake the feel of encroaching ice enveloping him in its frigid cocoon, and like a man drowning, he sought out the one thing he knew would keep him afloat.
"It's not something I ever thought I would have said to you
"Think you could have done it yourself? Giving birth, I mean?"
Tony considered this, looking from Barnes to a suddenly solemn Natasha to a nervous and sad- eyed Bruce, but he shook his head and said, "No, I don't— J!"
Steve just motioned harder at his plate. "Then you need to eat. Please? A few bites for me?"
Steve shook his head. "No."
"I shouldn't be so… I don't have any right to be happy. Not after… Not after what I've done. And why do I deserve this more than anyone else? More than any of the others?"
"I notice you're doing a magnificent job of evading my question."
"Look, I'm not saying she's anything other than the awesomeness that she is. I'm just saying for someone that you would spend the rest of your life with—"

"Again,
He yanked open the cabinet again to grab the filters. He reached in to where they usually were, his hand coming up empty. Fuck. No filters. OK, whatever. Maybe there was some cheesecloth around he could use.
"Well, since you insist that it's all you ladies talk about."
to turn him back? Would she think it would be funny to leave him like this? He really didn't know.
"Then stop cutting and look at me."
"Here."
"You know," he finally muttered when they'd been sitting there for too long, "if we'd just done this the moment we got engaged, we could have saved ourselves a shitload of trouble."
They'd talked a couple times, mostly about whether or not it would be worth it to try and make a go of this Avengers-thing, but never anything too deep or too personal, and the Cap didn't
But she just nodded, typing and swiping as she listened, then turned her attention to Steve. "And let's see what we have about the father here."
"You don't understand what people do in the present."
Howard was such a… But his mother...
"Come on, baby girl. Let's go get you into a dry diaper."
And at that, he enveloped Tony in his arms and pulled him against his chest, relaxing with the feel of Tony's warm, sturdy weight in his embrace.
Steve hadn't heard him the first fifty times, "He killed my parents, Steve."
Steve shot him an unhappy look at Tony's characterization of him, but Doctor Ganford just shook her head a little and said, "I'm not asking if you
Yeah, he happily checked 'Y' on that one.
"And?"
"Yeah, it kind of is," Tony countered then shrugged. "Oh, well. What are you going to do? So!" He looked at Bruce. "Doctor Banner, seeing as my husband is a fucking killjoy pain-in-the-ass — and, at this moment, not in the
He stared at her a moment, attempting to parse her words and their meaning, and something funny twinged in his chest as he let himself draw his thoughts and what he felt was Esmeralda's meaning to their natural conclusion.
"Because the woman is supposed to clean up after the man, right?"
Steve sobered, and he shook his head and said, "No."

"Two weeks ago at a fundraising gala, David Welch comes up to me and Steve and says to Steve,
talk to him already."
Barton looked up from where he was dumping a spoonful of sugar into coffee. "Little warm for sweatpants, isn't it, Cap?"
"Shit!" he yelled and just cleared the steel as it came down beside him, and that was enough to turn Steve's attention away from Barnes and toward him. Tony looked up just in time to see panic come into Barnes's eyes as he looked between Steve and Tony, and Steve glanced to Tony then back to Barnes, and in that split second, another girder came crashing down, trapping Tony flat on his back beneath it.
that the Church rightfully owned or wished to own, however…
Steve stared at him a moment and said, "Well, why don't you just shoot me now and get it over with?"
Steve ground his teeth together, and Barnes pulled his arm away from Wilson like it stung and said, "Just when I was starting to like you."
"Whatever," he said and grabbed his bag before led the way over to the elevator. "Come on. Let's get this dumb fucking thing over with. But don't stand so close to me! I don't want people getting the idea that we're together."
will catch your attention." He scooted over to the edge of the bed and took a deep breath before he summoned the strength to fight to get up. Steve watched him for all of a moment before he walked over and took hold of Tony's arms to help him up.
And that's when he stopped caring about getting her back.
"But she's
"Yeah?" Tony asked above the baby screaming in his arms. "Then what do you mean?"
Steve quieted his chuckles, the smile remaining on his face, and he met Tony's gaze and said a somewhat earnest, "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to laugh at you."
You— You want me to— I'm sorry, are you trying to tell me I'm getting too emotional over the fact that the
female and would now be for the rest of his life. He'd noticed some difference in the way people had treated him — that guy holding the door for him at that coffee shop, the media's fixation with his appearance in more superficial ways than he'd ever before experienced — and he'd even succumbed himself to taking on rituals and routines that were the bane of 'acceptable' womanhood for the modern American female — things like plucking and shaving and various other hair removal methods because god forbid any woman have a moustache or too heavy a brow (his brows weren't
"Wanna bet? We could trade places. You wouldn't even last five minutes before you were begging to trade back."
"Nice to be back," he said as Steve mouthed at his jaw, pressing light kisses there and generally just enjoying the fact that Tony was back to only having one 'X' chromosome.
"Thanks," he muttered, and Tony knew Barnes's comment about the age gap was still sticking in his craw.
Steve kept quiet, only watching and waiting for Tony to continue his story.
"Fine," Tony muttered and looked over the chalked menu before he ordered a large of the house drip with a dash of vanilla and a heaping of whipped cream.
," Steve cut in, sounding like he was anything but.
"You know, the 'fossil' that you're married to doesn't exactly appreciate all the age jokes at his expense."
Tony just gazed at him, head tilted, lips parted slightly, Styrofoam cup halfway to his mouth. He watched as Tony's eyes scanned the breadth of his face, like he was trying to read him, trying to figure out if he was saying what he thought he was saying, and for a moment — for just a moment — Steve saw that protective shell crack. He saw the mask begin to slide off. He saw that wide- eyed and idealistic man he'd fallen in love with all those years ago.
"Mmm...more or less."
it somehow if they were?
"He thinks I'm screwing around on you."
"Not this one. This is a different one. This one won't splatter in front of a semi. Come on, Steve! This way, I get to have my cake and eat it, too! I stay here, in the comfort of my own lab while you guys go out and deal with the shitty stuff."
After they'd finished showering, Steve asked if he was hungry, and when Tony said he could go for something to eat, Steve just smiled and nodded and said he'd be back.
"Uh, yeah, she's a she, but she's on the TV, Cap. Nothing to worry about."
"Are you sure?"
And then Esmeralda had happened — Esmeralda with her somewhat sweet and somewhat condescending attitude — and Tony was somehow inexplicably pregnant, and Steve...was maybe not as supportive as he could have been. He'd thought nothing of wanting to get rid of it — not out of spite or anything completely awful but because Bruce had laid out the facts for him that Tony's body was not suited to something that would tax it so. He'd done a whole host of damage to himself over the years, and a pregnancy put a strain on the healthiest of bodies. Bruce couldn't guarantee that Tony wouldn't...suffer ill consequences of Esmeralda's little amusement.
"Do not in any way imply I have anything to do with that bucket of bolts other than act as his annoyed and disappointed keeper."
"Yeah?" Tony said, and there was a teasing smile on his lips and a glint in his eye, and Steve steeled himself for an insult. "They also used mercury to treat syphilis."
"Haven't you heard? Ignorance is bliss."
"They really don't do much at this age except eat and sleep and poop.
He took the stairs two-at-a-time then went over to the bedroom. He stopped and looked down at his slumbering little infant girl, a pang hitting him square in the chest where the arc reactor had once sat at the knowledge that, not without a lot of work on his part, his nursing days for her were over.
, where did you learn how to do that?"
still think of himself as a man, and he understood he was currently in possession of a woman's body, but it was... It was getting harder and harder to find where the male part of him ended and the female part of him began. The line of demarcation was not as clearly delineated now as it had been a month or so earlier.
Steve pretended to think about this before he said, "No, I'm pretty sure they had that one back in my day, too."
"Yeah," he croaked but didn't say anything beyond that.
had taken his mother away from him. Had killed her. That wonderful, fantastic woman whose only mistake in life had been to get mixed up with Howard fucking Stark.
"We're not disgusted," she reiterated. "We just like picking on you for it. It's actually kind of sweet."
"Not…really something I needed to know," Pepper said and lessened her hold on his hand.
"Uh, good question," Tony said and went back over to the cabinets. "Last I checked, this was my penthouse, not the communal floor."
"OK, sweetums, then you're not six-two because there's only five inches difference between us, and five inches on that would be—"
She didn't get the rest of it out before Steve sighed, and Tony felt his shoulders drop some. "Seriously?" he asked, sounding resigned to his fate.
Sure. It was just that. It wasn't anything more sinister than that. Thankfully, he hadn't stuck around long enough to find out.
He woke up right after that, filled with that confused feeling a person got when first pulled out of a dream and unable decipher what was real and what wasn't, and after reacquainting himself with his surroundings, he moved over to Tony's side and curled up beside him, carefully slotting himself next to his husband and putting an arm around him so that he didn't wake him up.
So, after a short nap (because he was fucking
They were in each other's arms, tight, passionate, mouths met in a fierce kiss that might well have been obscene to an outside observer, tongue and teeth and saliva and grunts as they pulled closer, tasted each other, needed to be one with each other again. He felt Tony go lax in his arms — he always loved that moment that Tony gave himself over to him and allowed him to be the stronger of the two — but just as he'd relaxed into it, just as he'd begun to forget that anything beyond they two existed in the world, Tony wrenched back violently, pushing his hands against Steve's chest and shoving him away as he muttered, "No," over and over again.
Bruce leveled him with a flat look. "Coming from you, I don't blame him for reading that into it."
to watch that," Barton said and slathered some more cream cheese on a bagel.
"You ever pick out a name for her?"
"Come along, Captain," she said and motioned for him to stand as well.
"But not for you."
He got into the driver's seat and slammed the door. He started the engine, and as Steve tried to plead with him, he threw it into gear and checked his mirrors before he gunned it and took off down the shoulder then merged back onto the highway, leaving Steve and his son-of-a-bitch pal in the dust.
"Or— Oh! She didn't know who JARVIS was. She said he sounded like that Vision-person. The AI she knew was called 'Friday,' I guess."
"Tony—"
Tony Stark
Barnes just shook his head. "I killed your parents. I can never repay you that—"

read the splash at the top, and below that was a stunning recent picture of the billionaire, who looked fit, and trim, and tanned, decked out in a black suit and burgundy dress shirt that had probably cost the equivalent of a month's salary for Steve — from
and before Tony could say anything, she scrambled off his lap and out of the kitchen toward where the bellow had come from.
"Well, I guess you're just going to have to follow me in."
"It is my fault! If I'd been able to control myself—"
"Yeah? What did I say? What did I just tell you, Tony?"
Steve just groaned and buried his face deeper into his hands, if that was possible, and Wilson reached out to squeeze Steve's arm in sympathy as Tony continued to nuzzle his neck.
He liked kids. There was a time when he thought maybe he'd have one or two of his own. But those days were gone, and he was content with the life he had now. Or he told himself he was, anyway. Because science was his first love, would always be his first love, and would always come first. The philanthropy went hand-in-hand with that. He was a doctor. He wanted nothing more to help people. He could help them with his science expertise.
Once they finished cleaning off, Steve wrapped Tony up in his best towel and dried his hair off and gave him what extra clothes he could find. The t-shirt and boxers were a little big on him — OK, the t-shirt fit pretty well, seeing as, according to Tony, Steve didn't know his clothing size and bought his t-shirts two sizes too small — and as Steve finished cleaning up in the bathroom, Tony helped himself to looking around Steve's bedroom. It was only at that moment that Steve remembered that he'd left that stupid webpage up with the story about Tony's 'proposal,' and he stuck his head back into the bedroom just as Tony bumped the mouse to knock the screensaver off, only to display a photograph of a groomed, grinning Tony Stark from the other night's gala with a big, black 'wedding bells' headline.
"A wedding cake I got on discount," Hill replied blandly. "Evidently the purple of the fondant wasn't exactly to the bride's specifications. I guess some of those tiny silver balls that they decorate with were a bit misplaced as well."
He bent down and pressed a kiss to Steve's forehead, and he sighed a little and said, "Old man, you're going to be the death of me one of these days."
(He'd been a…sickly child, to say the least. And a sickly teenager. And a sickly adult.)
Pepper just stared at him a moment before she went over and sat down on the couch. "I… I don't know what to say."
…I cannot do."
He sighed out a groan and turned to Bruce.
"Tell him to go to hell, J. Not interested in his bullshit."
"No, don't worry about it. It's not anything that… I'm not crying— I'm not
"Say, Steve?"
"Was she from a previous relationship?"
When neither one of them did anything but nod their understanding to what she'd said, she smiled once more and said, "It was very nice to meet you both."
expensive sports car, staring down at his phone, the light from the street casting long shadows over the sidewalk that made the whole thing look like it was out of some spy story. He stood there, unsure, wondering if he should say 'hello' or continue on his way, and he wondered if Tony was waiting there for someone, though a museum seemed such an odd place to meet someone.
"Oh," he said just before Rhodey called out to him, "Hey, Tones!" He turned, and Rhodey was grinning and holding up his phone. "Somebody wants to say 'hi' to you."
He shrugged, the last of his shivers yet to leave him, his gaze focused on the light strands of hair on top of the baby's otherwise bald head. "Hadn't really thought about it," he said, the words a little shaky. "I guess given the fact that the power's still out— It's still out, right?"

"They'll take care of it," he said, though Tony could tell he was attempting to convince himself of the truth of the words as much as he was trying to assure Tony. "But I—" He shrugged. "I guess it's not the worst thing in the world. If you don't mind me hanging around, anyway."
tell anyone about it."
"Seventy-two hours," he said and rubbed his nose as he snuffled through his tears. "I've spent seventy-two hours in the lab no problem. But this? I can't do this. I can't
"What? Speculating on Cap's sex life — or lack thereof, anyway? Come on, you don't think he's some ninety-three-year-old virgin, do you? And even if he were — especially if he were — don't you think he'd be practically salivating to get his rocks off already? Guy's a fucking monk, as far as I can tell. And, look, I get that he's older than dirt and he comes from a time where people were more backward and repressed than they are today, but that's not the repression of someone that fantasizes about the half of society that has two 'X' chromosomes. That's the repression of someone that fantasizes about getting on his knees and sucking brain."
"Yeah, really, babe? Not a problem. We've…got a few bucks in the bank— Well,
"Is that why you're sitting there like that?" Steve asked, motioning over Tony's general nakedness aside from the black bra.
"'Tis better that they remain unfound," Thor replied.
She just let out a gummy yawn at him then stared up at him with her big, dark eyes.
Tony gasped. "First my height, now my age. Say something about my weight, and you'll hit the sleeping-on-the-couch trifecta."
"Is Papa comin' with us?"
than by going to her doctor's exams with her?"
He pulled away from Steve slightly, making Steve frown at him and open his mouth to ask what was wrong, but before Steve could formulate his thought, Tony said, "You goddamned sap."
It wasn't until he met her clear green eyes that he realized he'd been getting a little worked up, and he put his hand atop the one she'd placed over his chest where the arc reactor had once sat and tried to breathe with her. In. Out. In. And out again. His pulse was racing, and he knew his blood pressure was elevated, and he gasped out a few breaths and closed his eyes. He was reminded of how similar the reaction to this was to the panic attacks and the nightmares he'd had about the portal after the Battle of New York, but he pushed those thoughts aside as best as he could and just concentrated on the horribleness of the here and now.
"Not even a little hint, and
Steve opened his mouth to say something corny and earnest, but he thought that might make Tony even more concerned, so he swallowed down the cheese and instead said a sly, "Well, there's always Madripoor to escape to when that happens."
Steve just smiled, a little plaintive, and shook his head. "No," he said, "just… It's nothing I haven't thought about before." He went quiet a moment and shrugged a little. "Just didn't realize anyone else had ever thought about it."
"'s'name we picked out of the book," he slurred as relaxation began to overtake him. "Pure coincidence."

And now he could do that with a flesh and blood child. Hopefully, DUM-E wouldn't get too jealous.
no words for this. There were no emotions. He was a man — and very happily so — that had been turned into a woman that had been impregnated, and now was forced to endure this impossible pregnancy to its end unless he wanted to die. Esmeralda the Insane had sold it as some kind of fail-safe to protect the clump of cells growing within him, which would be all fine and dandy if he actually
"It was good information."
Steve did a quick calculation in his head — clearly she meant to heavily imply that their next child would be born around Christmas — then said, "So, sometime next year?"
"Forgot to go for your morning run?" he asked from inside the car. When Steve didn't answer, he sighed and nodded his head at the door. "Come on. It's cold, and I still haven't had my coffee. I don't bite; I promise. Well, actually, that's not— Nope. Wrong time for bedroom talk. Sorry." He leaned over and popped the door open. "Get in before the neighbors start to stare more noticeably."
," he reiterated, turning his attention back to Tony, "are like— I kinda get what that that goddess says about you two being 'soul mates' because you are, like, the only two people in the world that could put up with each other."
go through it and be
So, Wilson was taking it in stride as best he could, but Tony knew that was only because he was building up an arsenal to unleash in the event that Barnes ever became an active and known member of the Avengers. And Tony knew Wilson would do whatever it took to get Barnes to that point — even if only so he could use some lame-as-fuck 'Six Million Dollar Man' manip once in a tweet no one under forty would even understand.
He waited for Barton to say something, and when he didn't — and after he'd scraped up every last bit he could get from Steve's plate — he looked over at Barton, who just stared at him and said one simple word.
"What? You don't think she'd like me? Steve's ma loved me! We used to commiserate together about how much of a pain in the ass he was."
"Yeah."
They were one. They were one. They were—
"Yes, really, now don't interrupt this touching and vulnerable moment for me."
more disgusting than me shooting into your mouth?"
you, Steven? I waffle on this. Sometimes I'm OK with it, sometimes I like to pretend this is all a dream."
"What are you trying to imply? What are you trying to say? What are you trying to tell us?"
"Table this discussion for later?" Steve said, and Tony nodded and said, "Sure thing."
He motioned between them, as though Tony didn't understand he meant the two of them, and Tony nodded and said, "Yeah, we're good. I'm not really in the mood to go over that shit now, anyway. But I might run it past Nat and Hill if I were you."
Steve took a breath and swallowed another batch of nerves. "How come you didn't?"
to do with that? Maybe he's just a miserable, old bastard?"
"Definitely nothing like that," he replied. Hey, it was the truth — well, at least it was true that there were no visions of an apocalyptic future.
"Said you saved his life."
Steve. Not yet. He still had a ways to go before he would be
relationship — even these two weirdos."
Bruce let out a heavy and tired sigh. "Denise. I borrowed it off of Denise."
"Don't be sorry. Nothing to be sorry about," Tony said. "Happens all the time. When you get back, remind me to explain the horror of 'butt dialing' to you."
"Trust me," he said with a roll of the eyes, "there's a
" they both chorused to him before Pepper gasped and said, "
But Steve shook his head a little and said, "You're not a prisoner here—"
Tony rolled his eyes. "Yeah, here's the issue, Einstein: You've got this parasite stuck in me, and let's face facts here, it is, technically, a parasite, but because I'm like this—" he motioned over himself again, "—there's no way to actually get this parasite out of me without, you know, gutting me like a fish."
"Nice save."
"I don't need a
"That," Tony said and motioned at him.
, Steven. James Steven. James Steven Stark-Rogers. His son.
Steve thought about this a moment then said, "But not tomorrow."
"Well, you know," Steve said, attempting to go with 'playful' instead of 'defensive' for a change, "you're not going to be my boy-toy forever. I might have to trade you in for a newer model at some point. Maybe I can get one that doesn't talk so much and can let me get a word in every now and then."
"Shoulda got that done before you logged in, Stevie! Slacking off on the company's time!" Bucky called out to him as Steve made his way to the employee break-slash-lunchroom. He nodded 'hello' at some docents working the late shift, smiled at a few tourists, made his way past the atrium and down the solemn, windowless corridor toward the employee area.
And then there was he himself, shorter and past his prime and maybe a little dumpy, with scars he'd never be rid of and wrinkles lining his face and gray hairs invading his dark hair. Steve could see, couldn't he?
"Hey, I've been doing some reading! And going by what the doctor said—
The Cap just grinned at him. "I've had a primer on twenty-first century customs and expressions."
"Are you sure about that?"
did you meet? I mean, was it 'Anthony Edward' or 'Antonia Natasha'?"
Tony nodded and turned to leave again, and Bruce called out, "You know, it's OK to be excited about this."
is not trouble.
"No?" he said, unable to keep the question out of his voice.
He shook his head, but he was still trying to keep from laughing. "Not a thing."
. Like, you're dealing with whatever shit Hydra's pulling downtown one minute, and then the next thing you know, you're turned into a w—"
He was just putting it at the head of the table when Bruce walked in followed by Natasha and Barnes, and Bruce smiled at him a little sheepishly and said, "Sorry, I know I said I'd be up here hours ago, but it's crazy down there." And then, he glanced around the room and said, "I forgot what quiet sounds like."
"He was a homicide detective," Bruce said with a sigh, but Tony kept going.
Please."
Steve seemed surprised for all of a second before something almost…
He couldn't say that because it hadn't been an abomination or the worst thing imaginable or nothing but misery. It hadn't been a revelation, necessarily, but it hadn't been an abomination, either. It had actually been...kind of fun. The sex was definitely nothing to complain about, and dressing up and playing with makeup was kind of fun, and getting Steve to practically wait on him and-and-foot was pretty fun, and people not saying a goddamned word if he took a nap in the middle of the day was nice as fuck.
And now there were three.
He tugged a bit on Steve's arm, and Steve followed him over to the other side of the ballroom where Nat stood beside a table, a glass of champagne in her hand and looking so elegant and put- together in her red, strapless (and yet off-the-rack) gown that Tony knew she was going to make even Pepper look like a ragamuffin. Bruce stood beside her, looking uncomfortable in a slightly ill-fitting rumpled tux that had to have been rented at the last second.
"I still had a dick when it was all over."
"Hmm, well, clearly a better surprise than that 'true love' bra you assholes got me for
There was sure to be another pervtacular comment from Barton coming his way before the end of the night.
Steve shot him a questioning look, but Tony waved him off and kept his attention on the little girl. He asked her again if she wanted to share her treat with Steve, and when she nodded, Tony cocked his head at him and said, "You don't want to disappoint her, do you?"
Esmeralda continued to smile at him, and she made to step closer again, but Tony just glared at her and said, "I will get the fucking suit and
"Really? Now?" he muttered and looked down at his belly. "Couldn't have done it when I was in the shower?"
A fucking daughter that had just fucking ruined the best fucking thing that had ever happened to him.
Tony actually winced at Steve's words. "Uh, why—"
Steve snorted a laugh but continued to gaze over his menu. He wasn't actually all that hungry, but Tony was so hopeful for this, and Steve didn't want to give him any reason to think that there was any way this date wasn't going to end with them making plans for another. It was after midnight, so maybe he could down a breakfast platter of some kind. Eggs, pancakes, bacon, sausage, hash browns — the works.
Barton's voice cut out as JARVIS switched off the public line, and Tony reached out and grabbed hold of Steve's wrist to stop him. "Hey," he said softly and waited for Steve to turn to him. "Tell me what I can do."
, uh... I don't think you're ready for that, so why don't we just say yes, we have a daughter. Olivia Louise. Named for no one but herself because we couldn't agree on the order of our mothers' names. Flipped to a couple of random pages in a baby book Barton threw at our heads because he thought we were arguing too much. Like I said, sixteen months old and stubborn as a mule. Or her father. Same thing."
Tony stuck the straw in his shake then reached out and grabbed one of Steve's fries. Steve glared at him and pointedly looked at Tony's own serving of crinkle cuts, but honestly, food always tasted better when it belonged to someone else, and it tasted especially good when it belonged to Steve.
"Daddy watches those with me," she murmured, looking like she was two seconds away from crying.
"That woulda gotten you shot during the war. Trying to blend in, you'd out yourself as an American in one second flat."
Bruce raised an eyebrow at him and leaned against the table. "What were you saying about no Cap?"
"About?"
"Yeah, exactly, Tony. How? Unless there's something you're not telling me about other anatomical bits that didn't quite disappear when you got changed back."
Barnes stared at him a moment before he shook his head and grumbled some, leaving the apron hanging loose around his neck as he went over to the fridge and pulled out the eggs.
"Good girl," he said, and Tony felt him reach down and slowly and carefully twist the plug out of his ass. He gasped and arched his back just a little, and Steve shushed him and rubbed the hand that rested at the small of his back.
don't be the spawn of Satan." A year ago, he would have laughed at the very idea of Satan himself actually existing. Now, he didn't know
"A guy from Jersey," he said and tossed the empty box onto the table. "Said his mother had them because her father had them because he was a huge Captain America fan and must have gotten them at a fire sale Howard threw after he broke into Steve's place and took all of his stuff. After he disappeared, I mean— Steve, not Howard."
is where public opinion is now on that sort of thing."
. Who wanted to be tied down to Captain Anachronism for the rest of their life and dealing with his brats? Not him, that was for sure! No siree. It didn't matter how adorable and precocious Olivia was, and it didn't matter how fucking fantastic a kisser the Cap was. That was life best left to some other Tony Stark that was stupid enough or desperate enough for it.
"Depends on how you react."
"Why you?" she asked in English this time.
"Then what, Steve? What are you saying?"
"Stop showing off in front of the guest!" he directed at the ceiling because— Oh,
"Oh, my goodness!" she said. "Pepper Potts, CEO of Stark Industries!"
The Council members exchanged looks, and the third one that had not spoken yet said, "How did you—"
"Does it matter?" he asked, glancing between his friends. "It was years ago. It doesn't mean anyth—
"Whatever. I guess it's not really surprising. You're such a dork at Christmas."
She giggled a little then looked over Cap's shoulder and said a happy, "Hi, Wanda!"
She hummed in thought then said, "Scwambled up with little pieces of bacon?"
"—maybe you knock it off with the 'princess' cracks— And
everything is? You did hear that, right? You heard her say how perfect I was? Right, Steve? I'm perfect."
"Yeah, still think it was rigged," Tony muttered and took another sip. "And I take it you have."
"Alone," he said and pushed himself to his feet, wincing at the ache between his legs that wasn't entirely numbed by the ice pack he'd been sitting on. "Go ahead and say it. I'm all alone in this now."
to go to this gala. Maybe we could just, you know, have our own night on the town."
irate if they weren't there waiting for her, but one that would fit inside a vending machine.
"What? In our bed like John and Yoko?"
Pepper and Natasha exchanged looks before they both snorted out laughs. "What?"
you looked in that uniform, didn't I?"
"—she can't talk yet, Steve. She doesn't know how to talk, and yeah, maybe she—"
thing in the world ever to happen to me."
But Steve just steamrolled right over him and said, "I think you got more out of Bucky in two hours than I've been able to get out of him since I saw him on the bridge. I don't know how you did it, but thank you."
And then he thought about what that Steve — that bruised and bloodied Steve — had said to him.
"That's totally how it works. But look, it doesn't
"My friend, it is not what you believe," Thor said quickly.
"Are you kidding?" Tony muttered as he looked at the study in contrasts. There was Steve, tall and handsome and young and fit and ripped and possessing a shoulder-to-waist ratio to die for, ninety-six-years-old and not the hint of a wrinkle or gray hair.
"I do not! I
"Yeah," Tony said, a little sad. "Wish they were Steve's."
perving on the Cap's ass?"
"Of course he will," Romanoff — Natasha — replied. "Steve's a martyr with a hero complex and an ego the size of Texas. Of course he'll lay all the blame on himself." She tweaked a smile and ran light fingers through Tony's hair, brushing it away from his forehead. "Tony can do no wrong," she mused.
Steve thought about this for a moment then said, "Who's the one that has it in for Bruce?"
"I really don't want—"
She seemed amazed by this. "Computers hafta go on vacation, too?"

it. This was his daughter — maybe an alternate universe's him, anyway — but this was his daughter, and he'd rip apart anyone in the universe that would dare touch one hair on her head.
But maybe for a moment, just a moment, there was a little pang of jealousy that hit him when that little girl had clung so tightly to Tony's legs and called him 'Papa' and had wanted nothing more than for him to scoop her up and comfort her in her time of need. And for a brief, brief moment, and one he was ashamed of, he wondered how it was fair that
Tony groaned and sat away from Steve, leaning over to the plate and spearing the other half of the sausage link. "How much will it take for you to forget how to read?"
"But we'll discuss that later," he said and patted Steve's arm. "Look," he said, deciding to get back to the subject at hand, "I think they've already started their preparations—"
The door opened, sending a sliver of light into the room, and Steve said, "
He went to step into the room, but at that exact moment, Tony stood up and turned. He smiled when he met Steve's eyes and motioned around him. It looked a bit like Christmas had thrown up all over the downstairs.
Tony grimaced and finally admitted, "I want to lock up behind you. I need to make sure it's locked when you go."
"I like it," Steve said, examining the box. "Wait, is that the box from Pepper and Happy?"
"Maria Sarah."
He felt a tug on his hand, and he looked down to where Olivia stood staring up at him, eyes sad and bottom lip pushed out. "Pwease, Papa? I haven't eaten all day!"
Despite the situation, Steve snorted a laugh. "Really?"
"Yeah? Name one."
"I knew it," he said then shook his head. "Anyway, just so long as they have him. Don't need some Hydra offshoot wannabe getting tissue samples and trying to grow their own super soldier in a lab. I mean, fuck's sake, they just tried to kidnap me and her."
Tony shrugged. "I guess it's always on the table," he murmured.
"My plan was just to ignore it and hope for the best," Steve muttered.
Tony hummed, but Steve couldn't tell what emotion was behind it, then said, "Does that bother you?"
"Oh, but
Steve turned to him, nearly scandalized by his words. "
," that he had ever heard in his life.
"Uh...yeah..." Steve said, his voice small as he cringed in embarrassment.
my fucking bladder."
"Not too bad, is it?"
"Good woman," one of them greeted, and she finally looked up at them, her mouth formed into a small purse while flashes of red lightning danced in her eyes.
They both shrugged and made utterances that they didn't know, and JARVIS intoned, "
"What about it?"
"Hey," he asked as Tony poured another cup of coffee, "when can we start her on solid food?"
"I mean it," she said and rubbed his leg a little more, not in a way meant to be enticing but rather comforting. He only wished he'd had the desire to shave a little more recently than a couple days before—
And then, she began to drag Darcy away from them, but not before Darcy was able to call out to them, "Think about what I asked! I want an answer before I leave tonight!"
needed it, necessarily, but jumping spryly out of the bed on a whim was not as much of an option for him now as it had been in previous months.
Then there was a whole section dedicated to 'have you had any of these things happen to you in the last 12 months.' He gave a cursory glance and figured none of it pertained to him because, honestly, he'd been feeling pretty good as of late. Not perfect — certainly not what he'd felt like when he was twenty-five — but he'd been feeling pretty damned good as of late. He didn't know if it was just that he was feeling good about himself and what he was contributing to the world or the fact that he was crazy in love with an amazing person or if it was something more.
"Thought you didn't?" Rhodey said around a mouthful of pizza. "Thought she's from an alternate universe?"
not ready for that."
"Oh!" She pulled more cheese off the slice. "Nah. Mr. Ant-Man has a daughter named Cassie. She's older 'n me."
before I, you know, die or something."
"What makes you think you
To be fair, he wasn't sure he'd looked at Peggy that way, either.
He decided to head over toward the bedroom because that seemed like the best bet. "Daddy and I don't seem to get much time to ourselves," he muttered.
"Yeah? Well, while you're doing that, do me a favor and put our child down for a nap. She should have been down half-an-hour ago."
"No one under ninety gives a crap about that any longer."
Though he made absolutely no move to get up from his chair.
"Yeah, great— Hey, question while we're on that subject then. Why me? Why do this to me? You're so convinced that Steve and I are 'soul mates' and need this more than anything, why me instead of Steve? Was it just because you saw me first?"
He shrugged again. "Not really, but it's no worse than the alternatives. The world wants to see Tony Stark, know what happened to Tony Stark, find out who this mysterious 'Natasha Carbonell' is. Let's give them what they want. I mean, granted, I'll have a
But desperate times called for desperate measures.
He ducked his head a little. "Children," he murmured, like he was afraid to voice the word.
a line at the ladies' room? — but he was eventually able to get in, do his business, and get out without having to hear about how much some random woman wanted his husband to knock her up.
"No, I'm really asking you. Did you use 'school' as a verb?"
"So, does that mean you're still 'him' or 'he'?"
"Well, as a precaution," she clarified. "You don't know how it might affect mother or child—"
Dancing? With Tony? Tony Stark? Taking dancing lessons from Tony Stark? He really wasn't sure if he could handle that.
Steve gave a slight nod and said, "She's a very sweet woman, and we had a very nice conversation." He went silent for a moment then added, "I think she grabbed my ass."
"That
Steve just laughed and tugged on his hands. "Come on! Exercise is good, especially for someone in your condition."
"I don't know! The sort that calls for eye of newt and shit like that. The stuff that isn't
His own need sated, he took a few breaths before he bowed his head again and ran his tongue over one of Tony's nipples. Tony gasped, and, taking that as a good sign, Steve teased at Tony's nipple with the tip of his tongue, flicking the teat while Tony writhed beneath him. "Oh, god, Steve," he was saying, almost like a chant. "Oh, god, Steve." He opened his legs some more like he was trying to take Steve as deep into him as he could, and Steve pushed as hard and as far in as their bodies would allow, his cock still a little more than half-hard and hopefully enough to get the job done. But something told him to change the angle a bit, and so he left Tony's breasts alone for the time being and sat up on his knees, reaching down to Tony's hips and pulling him with him so that Tony's thighs rested over his. His legs spread wide and Steve buried to the hilt inside, Steve looked down over the plane of Tony's flushed body, his neck and breasts already visibly marked by Steve's lust, and something primal inside of him thrilled at the claim he'd staked. This body belonged to him. It was his to do as he pleased. It existed for his pleasure alone.
me! You don't get to do that. Not when half your blood is currently soaked into your pants. Nope, you lost all right to lecture me about my choices when you chose to do shit like this."
"Since November—
' It's not permanent. It's just until…"
"Papa, where's Maddie?"
"Nah, first time, actually. Don't eat out that much. Can't really afford it. Not even cheap diner food."
, Tony!" was pretty much all he said as Barnes wheeled the concoction out from the kitchen, wincing at the flicker of sparklers stuck with methodical precision (he'd allowed DUM-E to help him) along the top and sides of the cake, which was done in a mockup of Steve's shield.
"Yeah? What kind of magic is that then? Because I watched you literally turn from a man into a woman right before my eyes."
Alternate-universe him and the Cap
"You keep saying that," he said, but there was a smile on his lips.
He glanced up and met Steve's gaze, brown locking into blue, and he watched as Steve's eyes skirted all over his face, a small smile playing at his lips, and he shifted his hand from Tony's wrist to take Tony's hand in his.
"Sure," Darcy agreed with a nod then told Tony very seriously, "Don't ever get a yeast infection.
He met her clear, soft gaze, happiness and pride shining back at him. He smiled a little despite himself, and she smiled as well and said, "I know. I'm so happy for you, Tony. I wish I could have been there in person—"
"Now you've done it," Natasha murmured to Barton, hiding her smile behind her glass, and Barton put a hand up to caution Thor against jumping to any misinformed conclusions.
He waved off his concern. "I don't even care anymore," he muttered tiredly.
"Nothing," Natasha said, waving the remote control in the air a little bit. "Tony's just looking for excuses to track down Steve."
The pain having subsided, he was able to soap up and clean himself off (he never did shower after his water had broken), washing his hair and scrubbing his body and watching as the soap suds swirled down the drain, taking the time to pamper himself and luxuriate in the water (content, of course, that access to the water was under his control and he could shut it off any time he wanted; showers were much easier on his psyche than tub baths were). He didn't know how long he stayed in the shower for, though it was long enough for his fingertips to begin to prune, and after he figured he'd wasted enough time in there, he stepped out and toweled himself off. He wrapped his hair up in a towel and made a face at the hospital gown that sat folded on the sink. It wasn't all that comfortable, and he really didn't want to put it back on, but a quick check of the linen closet showed nothing except towels and other cloths, and with a disgruntled sigh, he slipped the gown back on, fumbling with the ties in the back but getting them eventually, then towel-dried his hair before he pulled the damp tresses up into a high ponytail. Easier than having it frizz and flop around his shoulders, he supposed. He hung his used towels up because he wasn't
"Guess I should have picked a day we

Fuck. Shit, shit—
option? But he remembered Rhodey had just shook his head and said, "
Tony nudged him. "Anyway, look, it's been forty goddamned weeks, Steve. Forty. I love you. I have enjoyed this experience more than I ever thought I possibly could. But I am fucking ready for this to be over already. Now—" He reached over and set his tablet back down on the table. "If you would be so kind as to get your pants down and the Lieutenant up at attention."
He thought about that a moment, thought about growing old — actually growing old — with Tony, both of them wrinkled and gray-haired and shuffling along and spoiling their grandchildren. He smiled a little at this — some dumb fantasy of him and Tony rattling around a small house away from the city, grandchildren running around and asking earnest and wide-eyed questions about the superheroics of their younger days.
, if she can do this to me, she can do that, too. But actually, yeah, no, I wondered the same thing, but Thor says this is her MO and this is par for the course and that she does it to
"A dress?"
Tony downed his cup as he shrugged his agreement then pulled the cup away and said, "Miss? Oh, miss?" He held the cup up and made a motion with it. "Refill."
Steve turned to him and frowned, evidently sensing something negative in Tony's words that he hadn't meant to allow through. Tony glanced away from him lest he spy something in his eyes that completely gave him away. Being so in-tune with Steve that they could speak entire conversations with just a look was as much a curse sometimes as it was a blessing.
But he just continued to grind against him, and Tony realized he hadn't heard him, especially when the guy said, "What?"
"No," Tony said and reached out to take it from him. "The question, my love, is what
Steve nodded, clearly not the answer he wanted going by the slightly disappointed look on his face, and he cleared his throat and said, "Well, what if we showed our faces for five minutes and then ran off to do our own thing?"
"I think we're doing the world a favor by
the twenty-first century. Get with the program."
Tony nodded again, slow as the last time, and said, "OK. OK, we've got other things to deal with at the moment, but we're definitely going to talk about this later."
He nodded, and he let his gaze go a little unfocused again as he thought about what he was being offered — and how selfish of him it would be to take it.
But Tony shook his head and said, "No, babe, in this context, it's totally 'fucking.' They don't see it as 'making love,' like you do; they see it as down and dirty fucking, and they think I'm the one that corrupted you into doing it to begin with."
Both Steve and Tony stared at him on that, and Steve could only imagine they wore matching looks of doubt and disbelief at Thor's words, especially when Thor chuckled at them and said, "You are more in tune with each other than you can possibly know."
"Yeah."
"So, we're doing this after-hours?"
of a woman, not all the actual working parts.
"He's not an idiot, Pep. I think he knows not to tell the truth."
As Tony cracked a couple eggs into a mixing bowl, Steve looked down at Olivia, and he brushed a hand gently over the top of her head and, as she turned her head to look up at him, he smiled a little and said, "Well, at least you still love me."
Bruce gave him a flat look. "Do you really think you're a member of the proletariat?"
"I've had worse," Tony said then pulled out of Steve's grasp to finish up the batch of cookies. He grabbed the shaker of red sugar crystals and shook some over a candy cane and then a Santa and then said, "You know...I didn't... I didn't celebrate Christmas for a long time."
He sat up a little. "Uh, yes, you are. I'm your boss. You work for me, not anyone else."
much?"
"Oh, my god!" another woman gasped, slapping a hand to her mouth. "You mean you're having an alien's baby?"
Steve finally found the courage to look up and watched as Tony stood there, halfway through rolling out the dough with a thoughtful look on his face.
"Are you going to help me with this or what?"
. OK, not that he was
"Kind of
"Are they still out there whining because I wouldn't let them eat any more?" he asked.
about how you want to answer. Are you accusing me of being a blanket hog?"
do not think the world is ready to hear Captain America say 'sucking cock.'"
"Like…Marie?" Tony asked, completely serious, but Barton gave him a flat look.
"He's hankering for the good ol' days of the sixteenth century," Tony said, and Steve turned to him in a little confusion as he pocketed the picture again.
Barnes looked between them. "Why, uh, why not?"
"You OK?" he asked, half in a tease and half in concern. "You seem a little...clingy...all of a sudden."
Tony wasn't usually one for skipping the Foundation's annual gala. It really did feel like the height of bad taste, plus, it was for a good cause, and he usually got to say a few words about the money that was raised and the programs it would support. The thing was, this was the first year that the gala would come around (early this year, for some reason) while Tony was a
"Pregnancy brain," one of the women said with a knowing nod. "I know what it's like."
"Not following."
"Seriously, what did we ever do to him?" Barton asked. "What did
Tony shrugged. Honestly, he didn't know. He'd never asked.
"Do you absolutely need the gelato right this second?"
Steve just grinned at him and continued to pet DUM-E, and Barnes watched him a moment before he nodded his head at the useless heap of scrap metal and said, "Can he really… Can he really understand what we're saying?"
"So, what are you sketching anyway?" Tony asked as he scowled and did away with the design upgrade that had put USB ports and what looked like a mini-jack for a set of ear buds into the Black Widow suit. What the hell was she going to do with those?
"Steve, no, this is bullshit. These are all perfectly valid forms of ID. They're
"Not in the field, Cap," Barton said as he hit the button for the elevator. "Don't have to listen to a damned order you give when you're not in your official capacity."
look cute.
The baby began to drift off, her mouth still latched to his nipple, her tiny body relaxing in his arms.
He pulled away from the baby and went back over to the counter to grind up some beans for coffee. This time, he focused only on his task, and he was able to grind the beans and set the coffeemaker to brew in less time than it had taken him to grind the beans the last time.
Bruce ignored the implications of that and added, "Gestating and birthing his child probably helped as well."
He sighed and went over to the elevator, which opened even without him having to press the button. He smirked a little, the right side of his mouth pulling up, and said, "Yeah, don't think this gets you off the hook. All right, common floor, J. Let me go grab my phone so I can try to track down my missing husband that is
"Wait," Wilson said, "you're not going on a honeymoon?"
Tony set the cups down on the coffee table. Steve figured it was a distraction — who cared about something like that when a fight was about to break out? — and glanced around for any Hydra goons about to make their appearance.
"Hey," Tony said and glanced up at him. "How in the world did you swing
"I don't know," he said a little too quickly, and Tony could tell from his tone that he was lying through his teeth. It wasn't so much that he didn't know. He more didn't want to face what had been said, and Tony contemplated this a moment before he said, "J, switch me and the Cap over to the private comm line."
Tony didn't think it was purely coincidence that he got a few jabs in the gut at that. "Yeah, I'm gonna have to agree with my petulant parasitic offspring at that," he said and rubbed his abdomen some. "I can't eat? Bullshit. Do you know how fucking
"It's— I know how to read. It's definitely trending."
"Turn around," Steve said, and Tony followed his instructions, feeling the mattress hit against his knees. Steve touched his right leg and said, "Bend your knee. You need to get up on the bed."
Steve nodded and said, "Yeah," and Tony shrugged and said, "Whatever," and Bruce and the doctor repositioned the monitor some so that Steve and Tony could better see it. Steve stared at the screen, eyes narrowed, jaw set, mouth pursed into a flat line, almost the way he looked whenever he took in any piece of information he didn't quite understand, and Bruce said, "It's just a sonogram, Steve. It's not aerial photographs of a Hydra base in Sokovia or something."
"More or less."
Tony snorted a laugh and sat down with her. "You think I do? Four days ago, I was happy as a clam. Well, not really. I was kind of feeling like shit. Which, incidentally, is how this whole thing started. I was feeling like shit, and I asked Bruce to run some tests for me—"
But if he could rid himself of it, boy did that sound nice.
Barton just glared at him, annoyed because Tony had disturbed him during one of those stupid reality shows about pet detectives or something like that, and said, "Why the fuck are you whining to me about this shit? Isn't it Cap's job by law now to listen to every petulant thing you say?"
Tony sighed as he stepped onto the penthouse floor, a gaggle of Avengers crowded around his TV and watching what looked like…an episode of
"A little," Steve said with a shrug, still stroking his fingers over the top of the baby's head.
Steve bit his lip, and it looked like he was trying to figure out how to choose his words very carefully as he said, "What exactly do you plan on wearing?"
(Which was totally not true. Tony still had that magnificent work of modern art — the Iron Man portrait — hanging up in his lab. No one could tell him that wasn't art — not Pepper, not Steve, not anybody. And both Steve and Pepper had told him many, many times.)
Oh, and also the person that he maybe did harbor an eensy, weensy bit of jealousy toward. Oh, yeah, and also the person that had, not under his own volition, killed his parents.
He stared at her a moment then said, "You exaggerate a lot for someone with so little life experience."
It was gluttonous, and there was a part of him that saw it as abhorrently wasteful, but it tasted really good, and like the sign said, it was
"Yes, Tony. I'm not a complete slob."
Happy got into the driver's seat. "Where're we going, boss?"
"Really?" Barton called back. "That's not how I remember it."
Tony glanced up from whatever it was he was looking at. "What?"
bust an artery or something.
She huffed out a breath and said, "OK," almost like she was consigning herself to her fate. Bruce just laughed a little and shook his head, and Rhodey snorted a laugh and said, "She's going to be a handful in a few years."
"Come on, Steve!" he said. "Then we wouldn't have gossiping-Gerties hanging on our every word."
Tony sat upright, jaw dropped.
"Yeah? You should know better than to drink in public."
"Sort of. I mean, I get that you can think someone's attractive and not be attracted
"I don't know. Was it?"
. I just—" She reached out as though to put her hands to his belly, and she bit her lip a little and looked up at him to make sure it was OK to do so before she did.
"Unquestionably," Steve said, either not understanding or not caring about the move Tony had telegraphed. "You turn a lot in your sleep. I think it's even gotten worse since…"
Bruce didn't know the Cap all that well. He seemed like the kind of guy that would be good with kids, but then again, he was part of that so-called 'Greatest Generation,' and history had them as not being the most affectionate or involved of fathers. Still, he didn't think he was overstepping his bounds too much when he said, "I'm sure he misses you, too. And I'm sure he can't wait to get home and see you again."
And also those persistent rumors that 'Natasha Carbonell' was really 'Tony Stark.'
To make this better for
~*The Alps, December 1944*~
Bruce squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head, and Hill frowned and pushed closer to him, gingerly sitting down on the bed beside him. "Tony, I know it's difficult, but—"
Barnes shrugged. "I don't know. Once or twice. We were all hanging out down on the floor you claim never gets used—"
Because I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that thinks one of you ran over his dog or something."
that family was."
"Hey, uh," Steve said before Tony could give voice to that. "Nat was saying — actually, they all seemed to agree — that I'm on, uh, I think they called it 'mandatory paternity leave' for the foreseeable future."
"That fella keeps talking like some old-timey street urchin from Hollywood's version the Lower East Side, I might."
that would keep him from meeting his child.
He decided not to ask, feeling that to do so would be just too embarrassing a maneuver for him. Instead, he focused on another word that had caught his attention but made no sense to him.
He looked at the baby slumbering in her highchair, the pacifier having fallen out as she lay there with her head tilted and her mouth dropped open.
But there was something — well, god help him, there was something
"Go to hell."
"Girl."
Steve glanced up to him, a small smile pulling at his lips, his eyes shiny. "Thank you." He nodded at the baby. "For her." He then nodded his head at the space surrounding him. "For this. For everything. I don't— I couldn't—" He closed his mouth and shook his head. "Thank you," he reiterated simply.
his body. This was his body just as much as his other body was. Maybe he hadn't wanted to admit it. Maybe he'd thought admitting it was accepting defeat because he'd been forced into this body through no choice of his own, and so long as he fought it, so long as he denied it, it still gave him an illusion of choice in the matter. Because accepting this, accepting this body was accepting what had been done to him. It was saying whatever had been done to him was OK, and it was far, far from being OK.
Tony just shrugged.
weird? Like
He totally had backwashed, the bastard.
Tony grabbed the arrows he'd been working on the other day and went about configuring a slight tweak in their aerodynamic capabilities.
He met Steve's eyes, determined, resolute, a gnawing fire in his belly and a desperate need to have this man inside of him. He'd heard it was a natural desire come this time of the...
But Tony had, in the years after his stupid and juvenile crush on the good Captain, developed a bit of an animosity toward him. Fuck, Howard had only known the guy a couple years, and for all he knew, Howard was making up most of that shit because Howard… Who the hell knew what he was thinking? But Tony had grown to dislike the Captain. He hadn't bothered to continue his father's attempts to find the old bag of bones because what was the fucking point? Ooh, yay, he'd bring a dead war hero home for a proper burial. Big deal. It was a pointless and wasted endeavor that cost more money than it would ever be worth in the long run. Obie — fucking Obie — had just said Howard would be disappointed in him, but he didn't try to stop him at any rate.
Once the bottle was done warming and he'd judged it not too hot to feed his daughter, he picked her up from her highchair and, baby tucked in one arm and bottle in the other hand, went back into the living room to settle down onto the couch to feed her. As he'd just crossed halfway through the room, stepping aside of bundles of wasted wrapping paper gorgeously-decorated presents, the elevator 'dinged,' and Thor strode off wearing only a white undershirt and a pair of festively-decorated boxers, Mjölnir, of all things, in-hand.

But today wasn't just any day. It was Christmas Day, and even though their crew was about half the size that it usually was, they were still hosting the festivities that morning. Which was...kind of nice, actually. He'd never had a big family. The only time he'd had anything like that were those times he joined in with Bucky's family.
Natasha lifted a hand from the rail and brushed the hair away from his forehead. "Don't worry, Stark," she said, but there was a funny and distant look in her eyes as she added, "Most natural thing in the world."
She cocked an eyebrow. "You know already?"
Bruce sat back and held his hands up. "I'm not enabling you. I refuse to get involved."
"No biggie. JARVIS already ran a scan. Surface bruising. It'll heal."
But other than that, he'd never thought it would be used for such a purpose. Seeing as Steve hadn't wanted it for his studio, he'd been thinking about knocking down the wall and opening up the bedroom — maybe get a living room set in there and have themselves a nice suite to escape to while the moochers had their video game competitions downstairs. He supposed that was still an option, but it made more sense now to use it for a nursery.
Hill shook her head. "This isn't like that. It's much more widespread, and it looks like it has several origin points."
"…and I thought, how hard could it be to make waffles?" Steve asked as he capped off his tale later that evening, shrugging as Tony took in the sight of a man that had clearly had an altercation of some sort with a box of pancake flour.
And lastly, there was the man — no, not the actual man, but a man wearing the face of someone he'd dreamt about once upon a time. It was uncanny the resemblance, as was the name.
He took a breath, closed his eyes, and stood back up, exhaling the breath as he willed himself to work through the pain, reminding himself that he had to do his part. He had to help. He couldn't let these bastards win. And the hell he would let any of those fuckers come anywhere near his baby.
"Well, that may be the stupidest and most misinformed thing I've ever heard," he muttered around a mouthful of food. "You cannot begin to imagine how much that man enjoys sucking brain. Or how good he is at it. Seriously, he's fucking awesome."
"It's not painful, is it? It doesn't feel like it's in distress or anything?" He shook his head.
"Wanna stay with you," she added, and Tony nodded his understanding. He wasn't about to chance going back to bed, but he couldn't very well let the kid sleep like this.
for Tony, which had only gotten Steve's hackles up. Who wanted to be seen as the
"Well, I need something other than 'Nat' or 'Tasha' to call you." He reached out and took hold of Tony's hand and pulled him close, and as awful a picture Steve made at the moment, Tony still put his arms around Steve's waist as Steve put his arms around him. "Makes it sound like I'm talking about our other Natasha. Nata? Natalie?"
"Yeah, I just… Bladder."
"Yeah, but—"
"Did I say something? Did I tell you something? Was I not a good enough boyfriend—?"
But Howard and Maria had tolerated him, maybe not liked him, but never actually made him feel like he was an interloper. Part of him suspected it was because so long as he was there, Tony would leave them alone, and it hurt to think that Tony's entire existence was merely due to the fact that Howard would need an heir to pass his company to. Tony had been born simply to run a company, and for nothing more.
Tony seemed to understand that he was losing Steve's trust again, and so he sighed, snatched up his phone, and grumbled as he swiped his thumbs over it. After a moment, he reached over, switched something on the radio, and then the version of 'White Christmas' he knew was streaming from the speakers.
Tony winced a little bit at the slightly disapproving tone his AI had taken with him, and he let his gaze shift over to the space where a little ball of fire had come into his life a week earlier.
"So, why the fake name?" Ella was the one to ask that, and Steve, surprisingly, was the one that chimed in with a response.
"Seriously," she said and turned back to Tony. "Get out of here. If you really want to do it this way, Steve
Tony frowned and blinked. "Wait, what? What are we going to do?"
"Avengers," Tony said simply, his gaze fully on the road.
"Yeah? That's sweet. But unless you want your head taken clean off your shoulders by a guy that wears the fucking American flag for a uniform, I'd get the hell out of here and never look back."
rules to follow—"
Steve shrugged. "I don't know. I just… I know how uncomfortable you've been and that's sort of something you have to be comfortable in your skin for—"
"He sees you as the fair maiden that you are and understands you to be thick with his child," Thor said.
But Steve, that bastard, just laughed, and he grabbed one of the hands Tony swatted at him and pulled it to his mouth and kissed it.
"Well, we can, but I still think I need to tell you I used to be a guy. Still am, in a way."
everything seemed to be, I still can't help but think that something's going to come along and take it all away and I'll be back to square one again and I—"
"I kind of do."
, he hadn't thought it would hurt so bad.
She put her hands on his arms. "You're not going to die. We won't let anything happen to you any more than Steve will. But just saying you do? Saying something happens that no one can stop? I fear for that witch and anyone that stands between her throat and Steve's hands."
"Yeah? What do you want?"
, as he walked over and said a quiet, "Merry Christmas, dolly."
, Barton?"
Steve wouldn't look. "Yeah, it's good. It's fine."
"Wait, so if I said, yeah, sure, fuck the gala, you'd just say, OK, and we could—"
"Guy's my best pal. Doesn't mean he doesn't do stuff that makes me want to deck 'im sometimes. He'd say the same about me."
"If you mean Esmeralda, no."
"Steven," Thor said and put a hand on Steve's good arm, directing Steve's attention to him, "you do yourself no favors stretching yourself to these limits. You must also remember that you have a child that grows in the womb of your bonded, whose welfare you now must consider."
Tony just looked at her, cocking his head to the side as though to ask,
"I live here," she replied like the answer was obvious.
— a little embarrassed to be seen with him. Yes, they were both playing parts, but this…this was not Steve's most attractive side, and he couldn't help it if he felt that way.
He went quiet a moment then said, "Is it wrong that I…kind of want to?"
"Um…little hard to do with the bustier still on."
"Well," he muttered, "it wasn't the
Natasha just shrugged. "You're the one that read the literature."
Barnes pointed to Wilson. "He did it on purpose!"
I'm not—"
a babysitter."
Steve just sighed out a breath. "Please don't buy off a presidential election just to prove a point to me."
Steve set a sad smile on him but said, "You know, if you want — if you want — I mean, I know they do have surgeries for this kind of thing now. Hormone replacements and stuff. If you really wanted, you could do it that way."
"Sadly, I do believe it would have been a benefit to you. Pregnancy is scary enough when it's something you've wanted and looked forward to for years, never mind something that's been thrust upon you without your consent."
go and see Pepper before!" he said and surprised himself by not feeling at all jealous or envious heartbroken at that fact. Just curious. Maybe he just had other things on his mind?
He never gave Steve a chance to answer 'yes' or 'no.' He just dragged him out, away from his friends, away from the party, and out onto the streets at eleven-thirty at night where they strolled in the muggy early fall darkness and talked about everything under the sun. He found out Pretty Eyes's real name was 'Tony.' He was studying engineering. He liked to build robots and listen to old-school rock. He had a weakness for jelly doughnuts. He didn't have a good relationship with his father. Steve, in turn, told Tony about himself. He told him his name, that he was studying art, that he was struggling with whether or not to join the military, that he was an orphan that was going to school on scholarships and loans that were just being added to the medical bills left over from his mother's treatments (that clearly hadn't worked).
"Just don't know the extent of them."
Steve opened his mouth to say just that, but then he stopped and stole a glance around the room.
"'Mairzy Doats'?" Tony said as he read the screen, the innocuous little song still playing into the air.
"Hmm…yeah, I know what parts of the internet those people like to troll."
"Still think it's a waste to drive over there," Steve said as he pulled a pair of sunglasses over his eyes. "We could walk just as easily, and it would do us good."
Steve, bent over Thor's shoulder, just smiled a little at Tony, and as Steve put his hands out to cup Tony's face, Tony reached up on his toes to kiss Steve and murmur, "They're idiots. All of them," against his lips.
"Mmm...well..." Tony said after a quiet moment, relaxing into Steve's embrace and nestling his head on his shoulder, "I guess I knew what I was signing up for."
Nothing had been touched by the time they got back to the house.
It was when the clerk had said that they could kiss that Tony felt something funny in his abdomen. Something that felt like a flutter. He pulled away from Steve and looked down at himself, and Steve sensed immediately that there was something amiss and said, "What's wrong?"
Steve frowned and took the thing from him. It was black and shiny on one side like it was plated with glass. There were openings in it that looked like they might have been for different plugs — one look like a miniature telephone jack — and small buttons in various places, and he looked up at Tony and said, "What's a Starkphone?"
"But Papa, my bed and my toys are gone. It's not even the right
Steve reached out and put his hands on his smaller, narrower shoulders. "OK," he said, his voice quiet and soothing. "OK. I didn't mean to imply…" He exhaled a breath and dropped his head a moment before picking it back up to look at Tony. "I'm not going to tell you what to do. You want to come along with us? Suit up."
— DUM-E's strut. "He doesn't mean it. You're a good boy."
He didn't think this was normally how it was supposed to go, and a fragment of a memory of a woman in a shimmering gown flitted into his mind. Some of his post-coital high dissipated at that, hard, cold reality punching him in the chest and making him suddenly realize that neither he — nor Tony — had been in their right mind. They couldn't have been. Yes, Steve had been overcome with lust before, but not like that. Not that desperately. Not so much that he could barely think straight. That being had turned Tony into a woman, but there had to have been more to it than that. Steve had never in his life had such a blinding, desperate need to have sex, and he would bank on the fact that Tony hadn't either. Had she cast a spell? Was it something to do with that mist of smoke she'd disappeared in? Not that Steve didn't normally find Tony the most attractive man he knew, but why had Steve had the sudden, desperate urge to fuck Tony blind make love to Tony by sheer sight alone?
