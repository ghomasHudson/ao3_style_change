Tony went to the window and Pepper joined him, leaving her work at the computer. Before them, the cell door had been opened and the prisoner stayed hunched in the cage. No sight, no ability to speak, but he crouched like an animal about to spring on its prey. He was an animal in some ways, caged and beaten for years. Tony spotted a button that labeled intercom on it on the wall of the observation room. He hit it and the sounds from the prison cell below echoed in the observation room.
He nodded and unbuckled. Part of him dreaded what they might find inside of the fortress. His father hadn’t been a good man. The things Tony discovered about Howard – his secret links to the Soviets. His interest in the super soldier program extended not just to trying to find Captain America’s frozen body but also to maintaining and cultivating a relationship with Soviet scientists. Howard and his part in the Movement sickened him. Tony swallowed down the bile. He’d been nurtured by his father to be part of the underground program. A program that wanted to change the world in its image. He’d bought into it when he was too young to understand or to question. He benefited from it for long enough. His deconstruction of the Stark Industries from weapons manufacturing had been his first step in liberating himself. Now he was about to see what other horrors his father and the Movement hid for him and used to benefit the underground. Produced to benefit what Tony thought might just to too similar to fascist organizations of the past.
“Captain, you are none too happy this beautiful morning,” Tony says and gestures toward the quiet landscape before them.
Never had an injury in all his days of battle hurt more than the expression on Tony’s face. The wound grew deep and thick between them.  Wounds bleeding out are the ones that are difficult to manage. The slow drip of wounds over years are not difficult to manage, they are impossible. The chronic infestation of pain lays bare the vulnerabilities of the spirit and soul. Steve knew at that moment he’d drawn his dagger and carved his name on Tony’s soul forever rescinding any hope of being close to him at all.
“I’m not the best candidate for this,” Tony said. “I seriously don’t deal with feelings, emotions well myself.”
Tony looks more hurt than affronted, but he goes to the mid-section of the Quin Jet and manages to find a fire blanket. He uses a stream of whatever those creepy crawler bugs things that come out of his gauntlet to affix it to the fuselage.
“Oh,” Steve says, and he tears his focus away from the metal and steel scraped sky beyond the windows. “That’s what you need me for. You need someone-.”
“Yep, and you’re going to find out if he likes you or not.” Bucky has that conspiratorial tone that always ended up with them in detention when they were kids.
Steve closes the gap between them, grabbing Tony’s shaking hands. He curls them to his chest. “We missed our chance in life, Tony. I don’t know what comes after this, I don’t even truly understand what this is. All I know is that I loved you then, I love you still now.”
Steve blinks away the wetness in his eyes before he looks upon his prince again. “We can stroll through the gardens and then head back?”
Bucky shuffled over to the bed and sat with a heavy sigh. After a few moments as Steve took the seat next to him but left room between them, Bucky said, “I don’t blame you, Steve. You got nothing to worry about.”
“In a minute, I have to just finish up this little piece.” He keys in the last of the designer code that Tony dictated to him. “There. Done.”
Tony turns almost instinctually toward Strange. His expression is desperate, a dying man looking for a last sip of water. “I’m upgrading the implant. It shouldn’t be a problem with the immune system.”
“The whole shit about me in that other reality dead or something. I wasn’t dead. Not dead or am not dead. Whatever. I just- no.”
“Let’s go get you some wings,” Steve said and Sam laughed as they left the apartment, Natasha leading the way.
“Yes, he has.”  Steve refused Thor’s insistence on coming along with them. Though Thor went searching, he always came back empty handed. Steve told Thor he believes he can convince Loki to return without the added animosity the two brothers share. In deference, Thor agreed to help Sam if there was a need.
Stark regards him, nods once, and says, “Good then, see you around Sheriff, see you around.” With a last up and down glance at Steve as if he’s sizing him up in all the most intimate ways, Stark departs the jailhouse.
She embraces him with a feathery touch with is soft and soothing as well. Even though they might have gotten off on the wrong foot today, it seems like they’ve come around to being – if not friends – partners in helping the prince. She pulls away and he’s surprised to see some tears in her eyes.
“This might hurt a bit. Don’t bite me, okay?” Tony picks up the forceps and slides them between the massive toes. The burrs are a mass of thorns poking into the tender meat of Blu’s toes. “You know the story of the lion and the mouse. The mouse helps the lion escape and, or the mouse pulls a thorn out of the lion’s paw or something like that and just like magic they’re friends. The mouse doesn’t get eaten. In this story, of course, I am playing the lion and you’re the mouse – obviously.”
“You won’t,” Steve says and clutches Tony’s shoulder, steering him out of the apartment and back into his tiny room.
“Yeah, my thought exactly,” Bucky grumbled. “Where the fuck are we and why are you here? Whoever the hell you are.”
“We want you to take a look at this,” Nat said and plucked a thumb drive out of her skin tight cat suit. “And see what he’s been through to try and understand what happened to him.”
“Well, looks like you know everything there is to know about me.” He can’t help it, but his words sound harsh, angry.
He reaches out and Tony reacts, grabs his hand. Steve holds onto it as if he’s about to tumble off a cliff. “Tony, tell me how it happened. What happened? Why don’t I remember? Did something bad happen? Is everyone okay?”
“Yeah,” Steve says and rummages until he finds the can of chicken stew. “Ma used to tell me of the Fae, or Faeries. They would come to the human world and snatch children, leave a changeling in their place. If a mother caught one of the Fae stealing their child, she’d have to yell -
“I fear what plans this Hydra agent has for the scepter. It is known to have great influence over the mind. There are even rumors.” Thor stopped, quieted by his own distracted thoughts before he began again. “The scepter may hold a stone, one of great significance much like the Tesseract or the aether. If they have the scepter, then there is no question we must find a way to retrieve it.”
“Who’s your favorite?” Tony asks and tosses the lollipop into the glass of water on his desk. He used to do that as a kid. Had a bunch of lollipops in different solutions of water with the hope that one of them would eventually dissolve the lollipop and he would have a sugary drink. Didn’t work. Except for the one that he didn’t use water, but then again, the glass melted too.
“In the space of a breath you used the old English system twice and you call me a plebeian.” He stacks the dishes on the rack.
“21st century old world,” Steven says. “It seems over the centuries many of the branches intermingled again and again.”
He has his socks on and realizes he doesn’t have proper footwear. “Hmm. Did you happen to rent shoes?”
“Christ,” he says as he opens the door to Steve’s studio apartment. The room is quickly filling with steam from the shower –which surprises him. Hot water can be a premium here. Steve never closed the door to the bathroom; it stands partially open as he showers. Tony waits for him to finish, but then after allowing ten more minutes to go by he realizes he’s not hearing the normal splash of water in the shower. It’s just a steady stream and nothing else. As if no one is actually in the shower to disturb the fall of water.
The accusation spears through him, a slice out of his soul. “It’s not like I didn’t want it, Tony. I did. I swear it. My gland, it’s just not functioning. Not like you think it should. It just isn’t.”
“Yeah, yeah. Pepper updated me. That reporter is not letting go. She’s making a big stink about this gala and how it will show the real Tony Stark,” Rhodes says. “He has to be ready for this. So, what’s the problem? I mean he’s working on the upgrade, right?”
“Good god, this is an emergency. Why didn’t you say something?” Tony leaps off his stool and rushes around the island to the disgraced Keurig machine. “You poor baby, did mean Captain America not treat you right?”
Steve eyes the terrorist as if he’s weighing how far he wants to go with whatever the hell his compromise is. He gives one more word, which to Tony sounds like a number, maybe how many days?
“I don’t know what the fuck you’re talking about,” Tony spat at him. But he knew. He remembered Howard bringing him to the labs. At twelve years old and on the verge of teenage rebellion, Tony with his genius and brilliance presented a hard child for Howard to raise. Tony’s mother tended toward a softer approach while Howard either totally forgot that Tony was alive or spent hours lecturing and sometimes hitting Tony to get him to follow the rules. Things changed at ten though. Howard welcomed Tony with open arms, started to reveal parts of the business to Tony. It felt as if he’d been welcomed to a long closed off secret club.
Steve shifted his focus to Tony and then back to Bruce. Steve’s gaze simmered like an egg about to crack from being over boiled. Without much rationale to stay put, Tony did the only thing he could think of – he left but didn’t say goodbye or wish the good (bad) Captain well. In fact, he kind of wished Captain America would get frozen again and leave his company (and his building).
“Shit. Friday, unblock Steve’s number. Send text: you are still under the non-disclosure agreement. Breach of the NDA will lead to prosecution.”
“Who are you?” Struggling to sit up, Natasha takes the cup away and slides her hand under his arm to boost him.
He never really understood how it all happened. He never fucking expected to be saving Steve from a rape or having to defend himself against some metal armed assassin all in one day.
It didn’t escape Tony that a number of his team mates (particularly Natasha and Sam frowned at Strange’s pronouncement).
Steve gritted his teeth and nodded. He wasn’t angry, not with Tony, but maybe with himself a little. “It’s okay. I’ll get over it.”
“No,” Steve gasps as Natasha digs around some more. “Geez, watch out, I’d like to be able to feel my fingers after you’re done.”
“You are a dangerous man,” Tony said and reached over the side table. He hit a switch as he spoke. “JARVIS, please send up a double order of steak rare, spinach salad, and two bottles of juice. Also a bottle of water and power drink.”
Sam curtly nodded in agreement. He opened his arms and raised his hands. “No fight here. But we’re having a serious conversation about the pack-.”
It had only been a few weeks since that fateful day at the safe house. The pack still didn’t live together. It wasn’t a necessity, Wong confirmed that they could all go about their days and nights and never have to actually share the same abode. Half of the pack lived at the safe house while the rest lived at the Tower. Well, most of them. Clint still ended up back on his farm more often than not. Together didn’t always mean physically together. Steve kept them threaded together, they routinely all made trips up to the safe house. They were all due to leave tomorrow to go to the safe house and then Steve, Natasha, and Bucky were scheduled to leave for the mysterious but newly opened country of Wakanda.
“I like to read and keep up with the different upcoming technologies.” Steve replied. He might be from a different century, but Steve spent hours as a child reading dime store sci-fi stories. He had loved to dream about the future. Following the amazing advances these days helped educate him and fill part of the void that existed in his life. He glanced around the med-bay and asked, “You’re working for Stark Industries?”
Steve places a hand on the window and drops his head, leaning heavily on his one arm. “I don’t, I can’t explain it Bucky. What happened wasn’t anything specific, it was more about what couldn’t be.”
“The universe is wrong,” Tony said. “And Christ, I could do without the constant headache from this crap.”
“No, you can’t. We have to make it look like you’re working with them. You know that. For this to work,” Steve says, and Tony’s smile dissipates until only the truth lines his face. The fear and the love mix together to show only despondency. He shakes his head and crosses the distance between them. He brings Tony into his embrace and holds him. “This is going to work. We’re going to change everything.”
“Does that mean you’re not coming to my place this weekend?” Tony lidded his eyes and then demurred.
Steve wrapped Tony in his arms and kissed him soundly and completely. When he broke for air, he said, “I’m coming. You can’t get rid of me that easily. Just don’t wait up today. I won’t be able to get back soon.” He embraced Tony. “Eat, please. If I’m late, drink the pig’s blood.” Before Tony could protest, he said, “I know you hate it, but for me, eat.”
“The Gravity bowl is really a misnomer. It’s the only place in the whole station where gravity isn’t in play.” Tony nods to Steve. “That’s why I asked you to wear the suit. The boots are designed to clamp onto the decking of the stands. The players have to fight the lack of gravity and sometimes too much gravity in order to score.”
“We have to go,” Steve says. “But where?” He adjusts the straps of his backpack and watches as Tony does the same.
“Wow,” Tony said as he placed the pieces of metal and computer boards to the side. “That was fast and decisive. Like you don’t even have to think about it.”
“No,” Natasha replied. Her hands were folded in front of her and the ‘no’ came out with a long o and a look of arrogant regard.
The prince lets out a curse and shudders fully. Inwardly Steve smiles. “You like that? You like that I enjoy your scent? I can do so much more with my mouth. Let me take off your pants?”
“No, I am invoking something that’s called Alpha Privilege. Since you are bonded to me – well everyone still thinks you are since you announced it – I can invoke Alpha Privilege.” He raises his eyebrows as if anything he’s talking about should make sense to Steve and he should be grateful for it. What it does is only charge the atmosphere with more frustration and anger.
Strange’s hand slips off Tony’s shoulder. “No, what’s in your nature is a survivor. You fight not only to survive but to thrive. That’s what I’ve seen over the last years that I’ve been your doctor. Don’t give up on yourself too soon. You have a very supportive network, there are ways to make this work.”
“You can’t compel me to do this, Tony,” he says and the room swoons around him. He swallows a few times and closes his eyes for a brief moment.
It would be nice to get away from the reality of what’s crashing down on him in the next few hours (probably) but he needs to be prepared. “Sure, invite him to the breakfast nook.”
"It was, if the slaves were purchased in the South and transported into the North. Why do you think the Underground Railroad ran through Buffalo into Canada? Slaves didn't want to stop in the United States, not even in the North."
“I haven’t really done anything like this in a while. I mean.” Tony swallows down his shame. “Not a lot of guys want to you know, fuck you, if you have to wear glasses all the time. It’s weird and it puts people off, so I just didn’t go that far with anyone since – well, since before the accident-.”
“Can we proceed with the reason we are here?” Strange asked. His cape jittered as if the wind hit it.
In the morning he would have a private discussion with Natalie and finalize their strategy before the vote. He likes his chances but he’s not going to bet on it, not just yet. Once the dinner finally ends, Tony with his entourage including Pep, Jamison, Harry, and Steven, head toward their transport rail. He has a private monorail from the Council Headquarters to the Stark Estates. Pep goes over the schedule of meetings for tomorrow as they await the monorail car and then Jamison reports on the fleet. There’s really not much to say. Most of the fleet remains docked and the rest patrols the worlds under his command.
Steve’s chest tightens and he clutches Tony’s hands. “I can’t make these kinds of promises, Tony. You know that. I’m a sex worker. I need to make money not only for myself but for the brothel. Turning away a big named client would be a disaster for Natasha.” He clears his throat and forces himself to make a promise – a promise he knows he would never be able to keep. “But I will do everything in my power to not accept an assignment with Stane.” He adds in his head, ‘if that’s what you want’.
“This wasn’t how it was supposed to turn out.” His voice is weak and very far away, too far away. “Supposed to go into the water, it was supposed to all end.”
For the briefest of moments, Steve considers using Bucky’s fate as a cover story, but that’s just wrong and he shakes his head. He must blame the sin on himself where it belongs but at the same time save Tony from knowing he’s having Stane looked into at the moment. “I’m – I’m sorry, my prince. I’m new at this and sometimes – sometimes it’s overwhelming. Hearing Mer Stane’s opinion of me was a little difficult to deal with – I’m sorry. Can you forgive me. I only went back to my assigned brothel and talked with the Widow. She put my head on straight.” He fists his hands. “Can you forgive me?”
Everything tingles and Steve finds the energy to sit up. He’s sure his eyes sparkle with anticipation. “I’d love to.” He beams. It’s one of his favorite things to do, but he never gets to do it since his clients usually only pay for an hour.
Steve follows the instruction, climbs to his feet, and stands at parade rest. Tony circles him, maybe it feels a little creepy or a little like a bird of prey. But Tony wants to get a feel for how big this guy is and whether he’ll be useful in his daily routines. Steve remains stock still.
Tony looks behind him, where there’s a small slope up the side of the foothill. It’s rocky enough that it might mean some cave or notch in the side of the hill he can burrow into until daylight. He doesn’t relish spending more time in a cave, but it’s better than hanging out exposed in the middle of nowhere. Of course, if he falls and smacks his head that will be the end of it. Grimacing, he braces his good hand against his painful ribs and starts toward the slope.
“Soon. You should collect Steven and get to the Main Conference building on the estate. I’ll meet you there with the attendees. I wasn’t able to get the meeting with Natalie, but you’ll see her there.” She starts away but before she leaves, Pep stops at the door and adds, “I don’t know why, but I think Steven’s good for you. Try and think about it that way. Maybe that will help you out.” She exits before he can question her.
“Don’t be cross, Tony. It’s too cold be to angry,” Steve said, and his voice dropped in pitch. The temperature followed his voice, growing colder and colder until Tony wrapped his arms around himself.
Tony races up the rest of the path and launches himself onto the lion’s back. “Blu! You came back.”  He nestles his face into the thick mane and holds on for dear life. His heart crashes loud in his ears and his eyes prickle with tears. “I won’t leave you. I’ll find a way to bring you home.”
“He would glare at me like a dad when some teenaged boy came by to pick up his daughter for the prom. I got like at least 30 pounds on him and he scared me.” Steve scoffed at his own foolishness. “I think he likes me now.”
Tony rubs at his face as he realizes the elevator door is open and JARVIS is gently prodding him to exit. He does with only a little difficulty. JARVIS notes that he’s brewed fresh coffee to Tony in the kitchen. He heads that way and tells his AI. “Get Richards on the phone.”
Steve pulls his hand away from Tony and then touches his temple, willing the memories back. Nothing reappears, only a cold wash of fear and emptiness. He gathers what threads of sanity he still has and asks, “The worm? Did we take down the Hub? Is he gone?”
“Then maybe you two fools should have let Vision do it in the first place,” Sam says. His dark eyes are steely and possessive.
“That’s not what I’m offering. But I do know it’s going to be hard for you this month of no glasses. And I just want you to know, I am here for you.”
They both jump up and go to the fighter pods of the ship.  He jumps to the pod as Sam hits the other one. Bucky wishes he could go and check on Steve but they have no time. The ship rocks under the heavy fire and Bucky straps into the seat. With one arm in agony, it will take all of his skill to help out. But he doesn’t complain – how can he when Steve is in such dire straits?
Even so, Tony changes his mode of attack. Leaning back, he lets his hands go to his lap as he sizes Steve up. “So, tell me, Captain, why’d you come out West?”
Unsnapping his jacket, he tugs it off and lays his head back on the cushion of the chair while he stares off into the dark shadows surrounding him. Nothing around him feels like him, nothing fits. He lives in a place that feels more like Way Station than the comfort of a home – like the Howling Commando had been, like Tony had been.
"Do you think, dear Sentinel Guardian James that I would like to leave the most talented and strongest in the Force padawan I have ever encountered with that nightmare of a Sith Lord. Do you think that for a minute?"  It was a rare thing to see Peggy angry.
“Well, it’s true. How am I going to work the sympathy card with the gals when you’re the brave hero and wounded. It doesn’t look good, cowboy, it doesn’t look good.”
“Sir, according to all of the historical knowledge, interviews with known associates, and his one true love, Agent Margaret Carter, Captain Rogers never dated or saw any women on the side.”
Tony struggled against the chains, getting onto his knees. Screaming he said, “Wasn’t your intention? What the fuck did you think would happen when you infiltrated my AI? When you gave away our safe house?”
Sam considered him. “It’s the soul pack,” Sam said. “If you keep going like this, you’re never going to find your roots.”
Steve snickers. “When I thought it up, I thought of a never empty thermos of coffee for you. Didn’t know if it would work in the virtual reality. But seems to.” He leans the open thermos over and lets Tony take a peek.
“Us? SHIELD knows that we’re married and in a long distant relationship. Apparently, that’s a big thing theses days,” Steve says. He stands, grabs a box of the pizza, and brings it to the coffee table. He flips open the box and pulls out a slice. No napkins, no plates. A man after Tony’s heart.
“Well, you know what I mean,” Tony says and finishes the repair. “Now I declare it’s time for our morning coffee!”
The waitress comes back and mercifully saves Tony from answering Steve’s query. Two large milkshakes are placed on the table on little square paper napkins. Steve stares at the napkin under his shake. He starts to pick at it as the waitress leaves them.
He growls in response and only tightens his grip, fingernails gouging into Steve’s throat. Steve’s vision darkens, funnels and he knows he could throw him off, he could do it. But he won’t, he can’t do that to Bucky.
“Wait! What?” The room blinks in and out for a minute and then Steve’s on his hands and knees with Tony hunched over him, telling him to breathe. “What? What happened?”
“No, no,” Steve said and then he recalled the ghost of Peggy speaking to him, or maybe it was just a half-remembered feeling of her. “Yes, like that.”
“That is not one of those awe inspiring speeches that Wilson is always talking about,” Tony says as Steve unlocks the laundry room door to the garage and the outside.
Those words describe how the alpha part of his nature overcomes him after suppressants. It’s one of the reasons the medical community advises against their use. He shrugs; he can handle it. He’s not close to his urgency. Slipping on his glasses, he taps the arm. “Penny, do we have a calendar on my urgency?”
“So our Steve, the only reason he remembers any of what happened in the intervening year is because of the entanglement, not because he lived it,” Logan deduces.
Natalie seems to appreciate Furin – often called Fury by most – only glowers at him. “Presentation suite talk aside, I think we have quite an issue to deal with. Estane and Rossi are making a move for that chair.”
He should have heard her come in the house. The blood must have really put him deep under, his body must have needed a lot of repair. It had been awhile. Pulling himself out of the creaky bed, Tony headed to the bathroom and spent the next five minutes cleaning up as much as he could without taking a shower. Once done, he went downstairs to find not only Pepper and Natasha but also Thor and Bruce in the living room. An old style console television was on and the report discussed the current visit by Secretary Ross.
It’s a handsome man with a young girl, probably his daughter – she looks to be about 4 or 5 years old. The man yanks off his sunglasses and squints at the room. “Milk not lemonade and a cookie. Your mother will never forgive me if I drop you off on a sugar high.”
“We’re having lunch, perhaps you’d like some?” Tony settles at the head of the table while Steve takes the chair directly to his left.
“Well, that’s comforting.” He reaches and grabs the ridge of the plateau. “I’m going to pull us up now. Hang on tight.” Steve musters all his power and heaves in a swift but decisive motion. He’s able to leverage his weight and Tony’s to harness enough strength to get them over the ledge. Steve rolls onto his stomach and allows Tony a second before he gets to his knees and unbuckles and unties their makeshift carrier.
Before he can even throw the phone back onto the bed the response comes. It’s only a laughing emoji. If he didn’t fear her so much, he’d probably want to date her. She’s that powerful. Tony’s always had a power kink. He needs to stop thinking about this or else he’s going to need to jerk off in the shower before he joins Captain America for breakfast.  He quickly used the ensuite and then goes back to the bedroom. He groans and picks up the coffee cup.
It is only then that Steve realizes Tony is a cat person, and that he’s going to give this little cat one of those collars that make her talk and then his life is going to be consumed by animals talking about food, love, squirrels, mice, and possibly disdain (since they now have a cat).
Without a glance at his own chambers or the empty – but nicely cleaned - presentation suite, Tony marches directly to the omega’s rooms. He thinks about knocking, about giving the man some privacy but he has to know. He opens the door and finds the omega not in the simple bedroom, but in the bath. His jacket and blood stained shirt lay on the bed. Steven’s hands are clutched to the sink, arms straight, face wet with water. Ribbons of blood from where the shirt stuck to his wounded skin drip down his back and to the floor. He startles when Tony appears at the entrance to the bathroom.
Cho only says, “It will take a while. The gland isn’t functioning at capacity yet. But the blood flow is good.”
“I’m trying to help you, Tony. I’m honestly trying to help Steve. He doesn’t deserve this.” He steps away from Tony. “I’m going to get some of the samples of his blood. Work to see if the serum is still intact.”
“But they’re vivid?” Tony said as Steve worked on the coffee. It had been decades since he sat at a campfire and made coffee from ground beans.
“I didn’t think you imagined anything,” Tony says and considers the possibilities of sentience as he ducks his head to enter the cavern. It’s dark and JARVIS immediately illuminates the cave.
Please be aware that Bucky as a man who grew up at the beginning of the 20th century has some old fashioned views of same sex relationships. He does have some homophobia in this chapter - just like Steve had toward self throughout the rest of the story. I tried to make it realistic and not just a easy fix.
Estane snickers and then walks over to his own horde. “You’re useless.” He shakes his head at the omegas. “Get the cuffs and leg irons.” He gazes down at Steven. The collar is probably controlling his breathing – Tony knows that’s what it does after punishment. It’s programmed to do that so that the omega can’t try for retribution. Estane leans over and wipes some of the blood from Steven’s neck. He tastes it. “Sweet.” He tilts his head as he looks at Steven. “Nice. He’s going into heat. Did you know that?”
"You know all the stories about me getting into fights with bullies three times my size were all true."
I understand. Aunt [redacted] was kind of like that whenever Uncle [redacted] came back from a business trip. I think they always forgot I was there for at least the first hour but then we would go out for Chinese and everything would be good. I kind of miss that.
Ana Jr.: I was able to make you a copy of all the records I downloaded from the other timeline. Since they were initially sent to you, it seems only prudent that you can access the information in a form you can process.
Me: Because you were really great at escorting everybody out the next morning. I don’t think I ever paid you enough for doing that. I’m sorry for that.
Anthony: And afterwards. She came over to SI from the public sector in the early 90s, probably after Alexander Pierce kicked Peggy out of Shield.
Nomad: You couldn’t have just made me May’s ex-husband? We’ve actually slept together. There may have been a couple of dates even.
Me: I’m a little worried about Monkey Lover, and not just for punching out Radcliffe which he totally deserved. Sometimes I feel like I am dealing with two different people. There’s the happy go lucky guy who is completely head over feet with his science partner. Then there is this other guy who feels like he has the burdens of the world on his shoulders.
So this is probably the best place to remind you that I am the queen of fade to black. If anybody wants to write what they’re doing in their hotel room contact me. We can work something out but I just don’t write that type of material. I am not comfortable with it.
Me: Because that vigilante Quake intervened. I’m aware of how dangerous it is. It was all over the news. If you ever have kids, you’ll realize that you’re more worried about your child then yourself.
During the process of relocating codename Hellfire, it was discovered that he has been working with the Watchdogs to kill other Inhumans. Apparently, his sessions with Dr. Suarez did not assist with his self-loathing. However, he is in custody thanks to the assistance of codename: “the Rider.” Yes, he’s the one in the LA area killing dirty cops and pedophile teachers.
Me: I think Aunt Peggy would wanted you to find someone who loves Steve Rogers. I think she would want you to find your own Daniel or Danielle - whichever works for you.
Purple Princess 2018: I get that. We'll figure it out over here. Anyway, I have two people who really want to talk to you, and there's not a lot of time left in this window. I’m switching over to Lily bear now.
Tony: It’s been eight years and the realization that he is married to me in another timeline. That’s a lot of baggage to bring into bed.
Yes, the Arlington house has a lab, which is why you totally should move there with the girlfriend. I’m sure your therapist would like that as well. It’s a large house, so you probably could invite Sky Quake as well. May be she would be willing to stick around if she didn’t have to live on base. Also, if you decided to work for SI you could work from there, instead of relocating to New York or Malibu
Steve: Since then, a lot has changed. You got back with Pepper and then subsequently broke up and never told me.
Basically, Yo-Yo stole Tony’s phone before he even realized she took it and sent Steve a message. Super speed is awesome.
Tony: Yes, but we are trying to work through things. I don't know where this will end up, but I told Steve the truth about our relationship.
Tony: I’m trying anyway. I need to go. Laura, from the good timeline, just showed up in my lab with coffee. Give the babies my love.
Me: I kind of like what I have. I’m used to it. Although, knowing what you were thinking most of the time would be helpful. You’re getting better at telling me stuff but I know it’s hard for you.
I’ll be there. And feel free to mention I have a boyfriend to the press. I’m glad you remember, because they don’t and we can probably use that to our advantage.
Nomad: I didn’t know that she had any siblings besides Michael, who died before we even met. That’s why I was really surprised at the funeral to find out she had a grandniece from the Carter side of the family.
Steve: Have you tried talking to Clint? Maybe he knows something. I know he hasn’t left the compound yet.
Purple Arrow: I think that’s where New Asgard is, but I don’t know why an intervention would be necessary. Good luck trying to find a grief counselor with even Tony’s money. Those are hard to come by right now.
He blanks out, a tide of release – the pent up anxiety of wanting an omega, the worries about the coming Council meetings, and finally the desire for the chair all wash over him and he’s free from it. If only for a few fleeting moments. He opens his eyes for a moment to see his come smear over the throbbing knot, across the abused mouth of his omega.
“Not really just laying around. I’ve been working on a new proto-type to make the tactile function feel more like real touch, as if you don’t have the gloves on at all. So I have the suit to help me figure out what’s needed and what I can dump,” Tony says and finds the helmet on the lab bench. “Let’s finish suiting you up.”
“Want to watch. I want to see,” Steve said and craned his neck as Tony spread the lube on his fingers.
“What’s been going on here, sir.” Rumlow slurred out the last word to taint it. “Is a mission for the good of the Movement. You know the Movement. You were initiated into it when you were, what? Ten?” Rumlow snorted a little as if to dismiss Tony’s opposition to the work being performed in the hidden laboratory. “You disavow the Movement, you lose everything.”
Cho hovers over him as Tony recedes. “Captain, we’re going to give you a sedative. It should work since the serum hasn’t been functioning well lately. We think you should go under as we do this. There’s no reason to panic.”
Samantha agrees with a soft expression. “It will be okay. Things will work out. Are you sure you want to do this?”
Tony places the glass on the counter and then turns back to Steven, as he leans back against the stone counter of the bar. “What? You’ll feign that you’re comfortable around me. That you don’t despise me. That you aren’t sickened by our biology that forces us to be together.”
Steve sipped the tea and tried to pretend it didn’t feel like waiting in the examination room in the draft building at the world’s fair. Those minutes ticked by as if warped by molasses in January. He waited and hated the tea but drank it anyhow because his mother taught him manners. Eventually Bruce came back with a handful of papers.
Tony chews on his cheek as he weighs his next step. The man is earnest, probably overly so into the taxing arena, possesses great artistic skills, and, from what he’s learned about his intelligence testing provided to him by Pepper, he would make an excellent assistant both inside and outside the laboratory.
“If you want, you can go. I know that Maddy would be happy to see you off,” Steve offered. Bucky had always been sought after on the settlement.
Tony suspected that a lot of that was because the pack wanted to give them time to find each other again. Had they? Had they climbed that hill and beaten back the fears?
There’s nothing more terrifying than the moments before it all happens. The anticipation of love, the excitement of sex, the arousal all play into it, but the terror of that first time plays strongly in his head, in the darkness around him.
This had been worse than the Triskelion. So much worse. The call ripped into his chest and anchored onto his heart as if it might actually tear it from his body. He dropped everything and called the suit to him. He never questioned – he just did. Finding Steve enveloped by some strange energy, tense and shivering, Tony did the only thing he knew. He helped. He rescued. It occurred to him at that instant that so far Steve had been the damsel in distress and not Tony as the Beloved. He flew Steve back to the Tower in New York City. And everything went to hell as soon as Steve came to his senses.
The first thrust sends him skyward, the brightness of lights a living thing inside of him. No. He cannot see, but yes, he sees everything. His senses are afire with it. The thrusting, and movement pitch him to the heavens, and he shudders and shakes. He cannot stop himself. His body roils with it, he’s free of every Earthly impediment. Released from his anxiety, his self-doubt. Under Steve’s tender, loving hands, he’s who he should always be. Then they are moving together. Steve moans into Tony’s ear and cries out as he moves in rhythm with Tony. He’s hot and sweating. Tony grips Steve’s face and kisses him, hard, passionate and resoundingly.
Tony coughs and chokes a little. “Sledding? We – go sledding? How? There’s no.” He spins around. “There’s no sleds here.” Sledding will be the death of him. He’s sure. “Nope. Sorry to burst your bubble, sweetheart, but we cannot sled.”
“I didn’t say anything,” Bruce muttered, then he added, “That’s not what I understand as the role of Beloved.”
“We have powers beyond what vampires have…what would you think people like Ross and Pierce would do if they knew?” Natasha waited as the reality slotted into place for him.
“They are,” Natasha said. “She died for her king as a vampire and was resurrected. She can tell you more when you meet her.”
The idea of Tony being with someone else, another guy, struck Steve and he hated it. A sense of possession, of belonging to someone and that someone belonging to him, swam over him. “I don’t think you’re disgusting,” Steve said and knew the truth of it. It wasn’t about Tony – it was about himself.
As the sun rose higher in the sky, its heat set everything afire, though he did not burn. It felt as if someone lowered him into a pot of boiling water. He wanted to climb out, to scurry up the sides of the pot, and seek freedom. Yet with each attempt he became weaker and weaker still until he finally allowed the steaming, bubbling water to cover him. The sun’s rays liquified him, and his body slowly melted to the ground. He didn’t know how many hours he suffered. At one point, Tony felt something on the floor of the roof move and rotate. The cross followed the sun so that he always stared into the maw of hell. The blood of his tears slid down what was left of his face, running rivers down the remnant of his muscles and ligaments. His chest hollowed out. His organs petrified. Yet he stayed conscious. He begged in quiet, wordless prayers to be set free. He was a godless thing, a creature of the supernatural. Forsaken by God, Tony’s prays drifted around him like a fog of toxins mocking him. No soul answered him. The sun, the light of the world, the source of all life on Earth, hated him. It loathed him and wished to destroy him. It received its wish as his jaw opened, and his fangs grew long. Nothing was left of the human that had been Tony Stark. He saw everything with no eyes, felt all the pain with no nerves, heard his own cries with no ears.
Tony wrapped the blanket around them, pulling Steve close. At least Tony had body heat to share – though it was technically taken from Steve. Tony kissed him and whispered, “Stay with me, Steve. Stay with me.” Though his heart may be like stone, it constricted and the pressure in Tony’s chest stifled the afterglow of feeding. The idea that he may have harmed Steve, even in the stupor of orgasm, tormented Tony. The guilt tided over him as he continued his mantra. “Please, Steve, stay awake. Stay awake.”
He tries not to think the trite idea that tonight is special. Buttoning the shirt, he finds a nice embroidered kerchief, one his mother made for him years ago with blue stitched along the edges. Steve ties it around his throat and checks his reflection in the cracked mirror. The split images mock him. He frowns; he shouldn’t get his hopes up. He’s not courting, he can never court a man.
That was the future. All Tony knew as he watched Steve leave for Wakanda that blustery winter day was that he was loved and that he loved.
In response, Steven squeezes his eyes closed and shivers. He doesn’t answer. Tony leans down, and lightly kisses his forehead. Through the last week he hasn’t allowed his omega to come at all. The pain may be unbearable, but the statement of control is obvious. Tony slips off the bench and bends down to unclasp the cockring. When he does a low rumble comes from Steven and Tony commands, “Thrust level 5, swell to 6.”
I want to say thank you for all the comments, feedback, and kudos. If I haven't answered your comment yet, I apologize. I am working on getting to all of them very soon.
Steve wouldn’t admit it, even when Peggy stopped him before he went into the barracks in which the army was holding Bucky. He wouldn’t listen to her pleas. She was one of the few who knew his status. Instead, he removed his dress uniform and got into simple trousers and a drab olive t-shirt. When he went to the door, the MPs had already been informed to allow him entrance, for which he was grateful. He didn’t want to have to explain why they should allow him to pass or why they should leave.  But they did both without any argument.
Steve studies the bowl and then turns back to Tony. “Isn’t the Hayashi track the star lifecycle thing you just mentioned?”
Tony waves him off and bows his head. “This is all kinds of bad. If the connection leaks, then it’s more than probable that Ultron listens in or at least catches snatches of information from us.”
A helicopter swooped down and a gunner leaned out of the side, targeting the car. “Hold on!” Steve rammed his foot onto the accelerator, flooring it. The car pitched over the bumpy road, spiking into the air and landing with a jarring crash. His vision blacked out for a second – something that never occurred anymore since Project Rebirth. Now, Steve found himself gasping for air and willing his heart to slow down. The pain in his chest spread and tightened at the same time. He sped the Audi down through the forested road. Thankfully the trees offered cover from the aerial attack.
He still remembered the stench. All Blood Dens smelled the same. Sweat mixed with blood and the distinct scent of musk and dirt. Several humans lounged in the main room, playing on their phones or dozing as they waited to be picked by a passing vampire. Several sported bite marks up and down their arms and necks. Most were pale, almost sickly looking and Tony passed them by even as some of them grabbed at him. He waved them away. He had been hungry, but he still had his standards. In the corner of the room, Tony spotted him.
Tony joins him in the room, clasps his hand, and gives him a quick peck on the cheek. “Why, Captain, I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“Can you get rid of this?” Tony asked. The branding on his arm mimicked what Tony remembered of the wrist mark on Steve. Tony also sported other marks that mirrored the ones on his other pack mates’ arms. Now that it finally happened, he wanted it gone. They were in his fucking head. Why did he have all of their marks intertwined and leading up his arm – he could feel it crawl over his chest. “Can you? I want it gone.” It wasn’t a promise of family or friends. It was a god damned infection and surely Bruce knew that- identified the organism that plagued them.
Panting, he awakened from the soul bond and found himself still joined with Tony. His arms trembled and he fell forward, though he carefully laid next to Tony, pulling out as he did. Tony curled next to him and Steve let his mind go to a kind of blankness.
Alternate Steve shares a look with Natasha and then nods. She raises her Glock and points it at Tony’s chest, but then slowly moves it over to target Steve’s head. Alternate Steve glares at him and then back at Tony. “You do know what he did to you. How he wanted to save his friend. This one.” With a casual wave he indicates the Winter Soldier. “Would you like to see how your mother died? Would you like to know that she begged?”
“Cool your jets, Cap,” Tony says and tugs the curtain back in place. “Not long at all. What I mean by same day is what day Ultron decides it is for us in here. Is it the same day or did he backtrack from when the whole team was here?”
“I know that omegas bond before the alpha bites,” Tony whispers into the omega’s ear. “I know that this act of knotting you, this is what does it. Plus my scent. My scent, the pheromones react with your gland.” Tony closes his eyes and lets the coil growing in his groin to overtake his rational mind. “You’re mine now. You know it.”
“Who did you dream of as a child, Tony? Who did you hope the universe would send to you to save you?” Blu asks, his voice a low purr that comforts.
“So that’s the reason we’re all having a séance in the middle of the woods and we’re naked?” Tony mocked but he refused to release Steve.
“Okay.” Steve doesn’t give it much thought; his stomach rumbles as he smells the fries and the burgers.
“You died as a sacrifice in order to get the stone. We needed the stone to defeat Thanos!” The bowl tumbles from his hands. The hot soup burns but it’s not the torment he suffers. The thing – the netted ball of thorns under his breastbone spikes and tears within him. It pierces him through, and he arches his back.
“Boss, Captain Rogers’ heart is accelerating. He might be having a panic attack or have an undiagnosed heart condition,” Friday reports.
Steve leads the way up the floating deck toward the estate. Tony grasps his upper arm, knowing the steps and where he’s going makes it a little easier. After they disembark from the deck to the stone steps, Steve instructs Tony as they climb to the house. “There’s ten flat stone steps up the hill.”
“Well, that’s not good,” Steve says with his hands on his hips. There’s nothing to be done about it now. It might not repeat itself.
In an instant the racing of Tony’s heart slows and sinks. He listened too deeply to what Pepper said. Steve chatters on as they go to the garage, talking about how his father had a bike, one he never saw. “They say my mom and dad were very free back in the day. Until I came along.”
Steve considers Tony who gives nothing away, and then studies Tiberius. “I do not intend to disappoint Sir Stark.”
to be kidding me.” Tony threw his hands up. He couldn’t handle that. This soul pack was completely fucked up. “What the hell? Maybe under duress you get funky or something. You fucking bonded with criminals.”
Near the front of the ballroom is a stage where a podium sits. Most of the tables are toward that side of the room while the other side hosts a number of bars and cocktail serving tables. Some people have found their way to their tables while others are mingling near the bars and serving tables. All the people attending are dressed as if they are at the Academy Awards – gowns, jewels, and tuxedos are the dress of the evening. Steve’s glad that Strange showed up at his door with a tux – he literally wouldn’t have had anything in his wardrobe fit for the gala. If there has ever been a time that Steve feels out of place it’s now. He’s never been to an affair like this – he feels like the stable boy stumbling into the palace’s ball. When he looks around for anchor, both Strange and Wong have abandoned him and are speaking with an older gentleman with a beard and an older woman with long white hair down up in a bun with trailing curls. Her age only enhances her beauty.
“Putting them in their place where they belong.” Tony straightens his suit jacket, readying to let the punches or something fly. Steve catches him, forcing him to stop.
The man steps forward and his smile is like nothing Steve’s ever seen before – he’s arrogant and beautiful and brilliant all wrapped up in that smile. He isn’t intimidated by the badge or by Steve’s bulk. He takes the world as it is and changes it, he manipulates and modifies – Steve can tell by the hard look in his eye – he analyzes, just like he’s sizing Steve up right now. This stranger is a man of a new age, the coming age.
"Fuck you Rog-." Rumlow starts to shriek but his words are strangled silent and he pitches backward off the conveyer.
The prince’s expression brightens from the haunted look he always wears. “I’m glad you like it. That means a lot to me.” JARVIS chimes to indicate it’s time to leave for the luncheon. “Come the luncheon is being held in the heart of the Station, near the Secretary’s office. I’ve heard that he might even make an appearance.”
In no time at all, Steve fries the bacon on a large gridle he found in the cupboard and brings out the toaster to pop in some slices of bread. Tony watches fascinated at Steve’s skill and mastery of all things kitchen related.
The slap stung Tony’s cheek, and his eyes watered. He dropped the frisbee and slid off the bed. His whole body quaked. What had he done wrong? Howard loved Captain America. Everything he’d ever said about Captain America had been about how good he’d been and how perfect he’d been.
“Hey, you get to take your time. Just like me.” Tony reached out and touched Steve’s hand. “Come. The river walk I heard is fantastic.”
“Don’t. Don’t do this. Don’t go behind your new boyfriend’s back and start asking about things like this without talking to him first.” Bruce is probably the most earnest guy Tony knows, outside of Steve. Still he doesn’t fall for that wide-eyed look.
“Hmm,” he managed as he sat up. He blinked several times as Bruce stumbled backward and sat on the coffee table. Pepper would have his ass – regardless of Hulk.
Deflating some, Steve acknowledges Tony’s direction. “Right, we should wake you up first. Any questions?”
“Ah, but maybe not feeding you the good stuff.” Logan tears open the bags and pulls out massive burgers and multiple servings of fries. “I got shakes, too. Vanilla shake for you. I don’t know how you can pass up chocolate for vanilla. It’s a sin.”
Steve smiled – and it was shy and – Tony had to admit – pretty.  Tentatively, Steve pressed closer, nuzzling against Tony’s neck. His actions were sweet, and decidedly not sexy.
He gets to the horses and lays Tony on the snowy ground. “I’m going to get the horses ready. We’re not far from the cabin now.”
And they both do. The sensation of Steve pumping into him, filling him up and his hand on Tony’s cock sends him into his orgasm so that he cannot even make a sound. He rides through it wanting it to last forever, knowing it won’t. When he finally comes back to himself, Steve is laying over him, petting and stroking his hair.
“Do we have any idea how long the seizure was? How severe?” Pepper asks. He can hear the mania in her voice. The whole situation has brought out the worse mother hen imaginable – the one riddled with anxiety. “Have you ordered any imaging studies? When can they happen? Shouldn’t he be resting?”
“I didn’t know it was for sale,” Steve says as he climbs up the steps of the porch and takes off his hat. Reed and his wife Sue with her brother were an odd lot especially with their friend, Ben. Reed was a doctor, but not that kind of doctor, and Steve could never truly figure out what he was doing out in Avenge.
“I get the power; I get your future. I get the chance.” The Red Skull goes silent. He knows he’s given too much away.
It was funny in a strange and humiliating kind of way because he never felt the ‘cold of space’. What he’d felt was a kind of warmth. What he’d seen as he closed his eyes had been lights. He supposed it had been from the bomb blowing up the Chitauri mother ship, but it could have been just flashes of nerve endings screaming their death notes. Yet now, now he thought he might have seen something else – some part of himself reaching out and searching for something, someone to cling to, to hold to, to bond to.
Pep reaches out and touches his hand, holding it. “Don’t say that. You’re the best hope we have for a fair and decent Chair.”
“What?” Steve yelps. “No, I don’t have to crap. I’m trying to send you messages telepathically. What are you even talking about?”
In the near distance he hears someone calling out. Natasha screams for help and then Tony’s hunched over him, holding his shoulders commanding him to hold on, don’t let go. “If you let go that bastard has you for eternity. We won’t be able to get you back! Steve! Hold on. Stay with us!”
Tony nods and wonders if the knock to the head might have sent this Army grunt cruising down the highway of make shit up. Tony knows all the stories about the legend of Captain Steve Rogers, and he never had any children. But Tony decides to let it be, if the Army grunt feels better lying about something like that it’s fine with him.  “But you didn’t tell me the story of Steve Rogers, well, you as Steve Rogers.”
“I convinced T’Challa to give me some, for a price. He knows why I wanted it,” Tony says and then delicately pats the back of Steve’s neck. “This will work Steve. You’ll see.”
“I won’t suggest that, Young One.” Thor surveyed the dark forest. His eyes looked feral, wild, almost crazy with need. “I have gone for many years without a human mate, many times over. I know how it feels to lose one and to gain one.”
With a breath, Steve said, “Your parents weren’t in an accident. They were killed by a Hydra agent and very likely that Hydra agent was my best friend Bucky as the Winter Soldier.” He was a coward then, instead of looking at Tony to see his reaction, he gazed out into the calming waters of the lake.
“I dated a woman a while back that loved breakfast. It was her favorite meal. I think all we ever ate was breakfast foods. I got a lot of practice,” Sam said. “Over easy, right?”
Luke opens his arms and welcomes them. “This is Luke’s Cage – the real Cage. Out there is just the shop for the less adventurous. Here you have everything you might need for that special someone.”
“Well someone has to watch the read outs and see how it’s going,” Tony says and taps his lip with his finger. “Okay, why don’t we solicit everyone’s help. Vision, Wanda, Pietro. They could all take shifts.”
“It is, but Brothels can take on a certain number of ‘apprentices’ who’ve only done the virtual-vid training modules. So, I’m not formally a full member, but an apprentice.” Steve pops a cherry into his mouth. He knows he should be eating some of the steaming turkey breast, but he can’t help but want to eat the sweet cherries.
When Steve takes the microphone finally relenting to answering a question. “Lucky? Tony, lucky? Ma’am, if anyone’s lucky it’s me.”
“Once again, thank you for understanding.” Steve stops himself from doing a little bow. He’s not a servant and this isn’t Victorian times. “Good night, Tony.”
Tony stops his work and drops the cylinder on the table. “Okay, big Army guy, tell me how I should look at our craptastic situation. I’m not seeing the Ritz here, or a Yacht club. Did they give you some kind of hallucinogenic pills to take when captured, because I want some?”
Steve stiffens but stops himself from launching at Loki. He needs information, he needs time. He needs to find Tony. “Where is he?”
“Yes, kind of,” Tony says. He frowns. “It’s hard to explain. Let’s just say before we did this I put in a few subconscious suggestions-.”
Tony wanted to ask what. What could they possibly be doing? But words turned to dust in his dried throat. He’d once asked Steve what happened to vampires taken to the Triskelion. Steve paled and refused to explain. He only said
“You deserve to hear this, Steve. You deserve to know.” Now, Tony crosses the space, he reaches out and touches Steve’s cable knit sweater. It’s soft under his fingers. “Steve, look at me.”
“Understood,” Tony says and he doesn’t. He hasn’t met Bucky and he keeps it wrapped tight inside of him the stories he heard about Captain America, his childhood friend Bucky, and the Howling Commandoes. He does because he has to – how else would it be even possible to have dead soldiers from World War II walking around in modern day New York City?
Tony twisted to see the speaker mounted on the wall. He glanced down at the cell and saw Happy standing at wall phone mounted next to the cell. Happy waved to him and then pointed to the cell. Sawyer had the door of the cell open and he was speaking to the man in the cage. The man sat on the floor and refused to move. Sawyer looked up at the observation window and gave a weak smile to Tony as he gestured to the man to leave the cage. It reminded Tony of a man attempting to coax a dog to do something it didn’t want to do.
Tony drinks his coffee and, as he places the cup down, says, “Some rules, my friend, were made to be broken. And what is proper society? I could tell you a thing or two about
“She said that to me once,” Steve whispers and this time Tony knows he’s crying. “I acted like I was, like I had nothing else to lose. Maybe that’s why I was condemned.”
“What? Wait. No. That’s not it at all.” Steve drops down back into his chair.  “You treat everyone like family, Tony. I was drunk. Really, really drunk.”
“It shows you exactly what Tony Stark is capable of. It shows you that all disabled people have abilities that we as abled bodied people ignore or cast aside,” Pepper says.
“Let’s give him a call,” Tony says as Bruce tries to go through the basics of time travel and reality hopping with Logan.
They tell him he's a war hero; they tell him the war is over; they tell him he's a veteran. They tell him he's been injured, he has a brain injury.  His memories aren't his own. They tell him he was never Captain America; that the injury scrambled his brains. The memories he holds dear stem from a childhood love of comic books and old 1940s black and white movies and war footage.
Bucky sipped his new drink, frowning at the taste, and then considered Steve. “Don’t do that. You know you’re the only important person to me on this whole fucking planet. I’m not going to say goodbye to her when I can sit here with my best god damned friend in the whole universe.”
The water stopped. Steve quaked as the cold water dripped down his naked body. He groaned in the back of his throat. A respite didn’t last long as Ross commanded ‘the lines’ to be activated. Something hissed above him and Steve raised his gaze to study the chains. The chains altered, and Steve cringed, waiting for them to go back into rack position, but they didn’t. Instead he heard a crackling. A blue arc of electricity and Steve closed his eyes as the bolts crawled down the lines within the chains and found ground. His body went rigid and his back arched in agony as the streaks of artificial lightning struck him.
Ross assessed them and then grinned. He looked like a demented jack o’ lantern. “Then let us begin. We don’t have much time left.”
“Christ. It’s when he nearly died,” Bucky said and then put a hand over his mouth as if speaking the words gave them power.
When he wakes again, Steve is on the floor next to him sleeping. Tony peers over the edge of the cot, and notices how very young and very innocent the man looks. How can an Army grunt look like that? He doesn’t look like someone who wants to kill people for a living. Tony flops back on the cot.
“Hey, hey, I can clean it up,” Tony says and wonders what kind of weird world he stepped into when he picked up a hooker on a street corner. But that’s when it happens, Clint drops to the floor and nearly hits his head on the edge of the table. He goes into a full blown seizure.  “Christ, what? Help? Help?”
“Don’t say it, Bucky, I don’t need you to remind me when Nat and Sam are constantly on my back about it.” Bucky has been his last refuge, his last haven against the memories and the pain that accompany all of the good and the bad. He can no longer think about Tony and what happened without it cutting deeply and into the bone.
“I will be. Let’s get you to the offices and then I’ll meet you there. I’ll bring him up from the lobby in a bit.”
Sighing, Steve rises to his feet and takes Tony’s hand. “I hope you don’t mind getting your feet stepped on.”
“Vision just let you in here? You can’t be in here!” Tony yells and Steve grasps his shoulder keeping him in place. But there’s nowhere he can really go – not at all. He’s trapped by his blindness. This man, this stranger presents a danger and Tony can’t escape it.
He starts with a gentle press of circles on Tony’s cheekbones. “Then why is it, you’ve denied being blind? I think I know I just don’t want to presume.”
“It’s going to be a pivotal meeting though. Even though it’s not a formal meeting of the Conclave, the deals are made in the back rooms.”
“When?” she asked. She stood in the middle of one of the few upper floors that were not decimated by the battle. They’d been using it as their living quarters.
The monorail slows and Steve looks up to see his stop looming. He moves to leave the train and glances over the faces, the people of Wakanda. Do they recognize him? Do they care that he’s a criminal in the cradle of their country? Probably they know who he is, but the monorail is a closed system for the government use only so he wouldn’t be surprised if half of the women on the train are part of the Dora Milaje, assigned to keep an eye on him. Most are probably omegas as well and somehow bound to their king. Steve didn’t ask how many omegas T’Challa had. That’s just not polite.
“I came here to-.” He stops. Explaining why he came might be a tad closer to impossible than Tony imagined. “I wanted to talk things out.”
“Posh. You can’t do that. Plus, I have no secrets. I’m an open book. Look on the internet. You can see and read everything about me. And I mean everything.”
Blu shrugs and gets up, shaking and stretching as he does. He yawns a big mouthed yawn and then blearily looks at Tony.
“But I knew they were forced. As much as I was,” Steve said. “But I wanted to kill them. I wanted to stop them for making me-.” He ran out of breath and then stood up walked to the far wall and stood against it with hands in his pockets. “And now, what am I if I’m not them. I’m just as bad. I wanted to do the worst things to them. I’m not a good man. I’m not a good soldier. I just wanted t-.”
“Honestly, I don’t know,” Steve said. “You’ve been around a lot longer than I have. I’m assuming that this soul bond stuff is something known.”
Being with Steve brings insecurities that should have been sealed up and packed into the back of a trunk somewhere forever. Tony holds onto Steve as they veer through the streets, as they head away from the city without a destination in mind. Tony wishes he didn’t need to wear the helmet. It wants to rest his cheek against the length of Steve’s back, he wants to feel the reality of the moment and know that they are, in fact, on the same trajectory. Here, clasped against Steve, he doesn’t feel isolated and alone in the darkness but suddenly aware. The rest of his life – even when he could see – has been a dull prison, but now something new and transformative has occurred. The fear that Steve might not feel it too beckons like a monster in that dark that Tony’s confined.
Tony whacked her away. “Fury? Is he going to be able to do anything? They’re coming. The V-Corps – they have a building full of men and women who are trained to do nothing but kill us. Do you get it? They are going to be up there on the roof, waiting for us!” Tony stumbled over the word roof. The idea of going back there again, of seeing the crosses on the roof, crashed into him like the frigid hell of an avalanche. Its power too strong for him to fight again, for him to stand up again. The coldness seeping from Steve and from his terrors paralyzed and froze him. “No!”
It felt more like a proclamation instead of a simple statement. Steve released a pent-up breath. “I’ll see him, soon.”
His heart beat a rhythm in his chest, pounding until he thought he might gasp for breath. The idea of losing his identity hit him. How could he?
“No. I won’t listen to any of you. You’re all my employees. All of you. I asked, no. I demand privacy and you broke that, Vision, by bringing someone into the house that-.”
“Sleep. You’ll feel better in the morning. Tomorrow is important. Forget this,” Steven says and lays a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Go to sleep, Tony.” The way Steven whispers his name is wistful.
“It’s only bad if we don’t have a say in it,” Steve says. He’s close to Tony, but not too close. They’ve spent the last few days circling one another like the Earth and the Moon. Steve wonders which one of them is the Earth and which one is the Moon. The gravity of their emotional pull holds them together, but at the same time, they’ve spent too many years denying each other and barking at one another just to keep the space between them.
Sam considered him, his dark eyes murky with memory, but he remained resolute in his vow to help. “I’ll do what I can.”
After four days he’s bone tired and they still have the main event to deal with in the next twenty four hours. The dinner slowly breaks up and Tony can only thank Thor’s gods for that. The Asgardian has stood by Tony and pledged that the realms under Asgardian rule would ally with Tony’s coalition. When he announced it, Rossi and Estane objected, saying that Asgard should stay neutral. They weren’t, after all, humans. Luckily, a powerful beta corporation stood up for the Asgardian alliance. It silenced the protest, but it didn’t wipe it away. Thankfully, the rest of Tony’s coalition remained solid.
“Wait, wait. That makes no sense. If we’re entangled, linked,” Steve says. “Then Tony should have been able to find me all along. It shouldn’t have taken so long to capture me.”
The letter meant a certain escape. Steve had never backed down from anything in his life. He’d considered retiring from the Avengers when the Accords were brought into play, but his life had always been about service. Without a gland, he might be able to claim the freedom of choice.
Cho had joined Tony away from the bed, and Steve stood on the opposite side. “Yeah I’m ready.” He rubbed his hands on his pants. “I think.”
He gathers her in his arms and slides off the stool to hold her close. She buries her face in his shoulder. Her words are muffled as she speaks.
Part of him was hollowed out, empty and silent. It yearned for more, for connection, for fulfillment. A tendril reached out, seeking and longing, and he couldn’t follow it, couldn’t see the end. Yet even as he investigated this inner corner of his own soul, he saw himself denying it, reconstructing it so that he could pretend it didn’t want something different, something unheard of, something wrong. He closed it down and when he did that part shriveled and curled up as if desiccated and dying. There was no rhythm, no song, no part of a pack. Part of his soul slowly succumbed to a kind of death.
“And leave you to be succor for him for an eternity. I don’t fucking think so,” Tony says. “I won’t have it.”
The world settles on his shoulders like the ancient Earth of old on broad Atlas’ back. The clouds heavy in the sky tell a story of oncoming storms. He imagines he can smell the rain in the air as this planet’s ocean crashes against the landing dock. Scanning the facility from his ship as it hovers awaiting the final descent orders, he assesses the isolated platform, the place where the lost are kept hidden away. He doesn’t even want to be here, not here. There are so many other places to find an omega, but not like this – not with the qualities he needs.
“You see this monitor,” Tony says as he yanks off the wires hooking him up to an electrocardiogram. He points to the transparent monitor hanging over Steve’s head. “This monitor is the one you have to worry about and right now, sister, it’s getting pretty dicey in there.”
He races down the stairs, skipping them and bashing into the wall, cracking it. He slams through the door and rushes toward Tony’s house on the opposite side of the Main Street and in the back alley way. Several onlookers call to him, but he ignores them and heads straight toward the old blacksmith shop and the houses behind the main thorough fare of Avenge. Clamoring up the few wooden steps he pounds on the door.
Bruce brushed a shaking hand through his hair. “You don’t know, Tony. This whole thing stresses me out and then he comes out.”
"Well, see," the boy says as he whips out a kerchief. Handing it to Steve to wipe the blood away and then curling his arm around his shoulder as they walk from the alley, he adds, "See this is your lucky day. You've just met James Buchanan Barnes.”
He doesn’t give them time to protest; he marches to the door and passed the guard waiting there. He stands at attention at the door, keeping his mind clear and his eyes straight ahead.
Peggy seemed to read his thoughts. “Whatever they did to you, Steve, it isn’t your fault. Don’t let them win. You can’t.” She started toward the door, but he stopped her.
Natasha’s having none of that. “He’s not over you.” He hears the whisper of her brown-tan boots on the tiles. She stands right beside him. “He’s not.”
Steve has the good sense not to comment. Instead he says as he stands in front of Tony and puts his hand behind his back, slightly brushing Tony’s hand to actually tell him he’s there. Tony grips his upper arm. “How about we break and go and get some tea. I’m sure I can get something for a midnight snack.”
The cell door opened, and Clint walked. Tony held his arm outstretched, aiming at Clint. If this new thing inside him knew anything, it was time to defend and shoot. Natasha stepped in the line of fire.
He swallows the bread, drinks the mock champagne, and says, “Tony, it might come as a surprise to you, but someone with my health problems, my scrawny body, and empty pockets when it comes to funds, isn’t well sought after. I had only a few things to get by with and that includes my brain and my belief.”
“It’s okay, Tony. It’s not a big deal.” Steve wants to hurry this along. He needs to sit down. His knees tremble against the weakness threatening.
“Like he had a master plan,” Clint supplies. “Yeah, yeah, and it was to take down his sponsor all along like you said. You told me he had planned to burn Ultron and gut the whole of the hegemony of the Main Chamber.”
“You know nothing about me,” Tony spits back, stalks over to the bar, pours a glass of straight bourbon, and drinks it down. Slamming the tumbler onto the metal counter, he says, “You want to feel what it’s like to not be treated kindly. I can accommodate you on that one, omega. Close up. We’re going.”
“My best friend is missing in action.” He doesn’t know why he says it – it tumbles out of his mouth like a bowl full of marbles crashes down the steps, skipping and cracking along the way. “He’s like a brother to me. And now he’s gone.” Steve’s under no delusion that they’ll ever find Bucky. Even if he’s going to dedicate the rest of his life – all be it short – to finding him, he knows the likelihood is infinitesimal. Not many are found again in a war fought in space.
Now, they lay quietly in the aftermath of their lovemaking. Tony cannot believe how time has dilated and changed. Only half a year ago Steve came to him, splintered and broken himself, but in many ways that built their bridge. They both crossed the bridge to find a new peace together in a new future, their future.
Pepper giggles a bit. “It will take some practice to feel the difference. Tony’s had a lot of practice.”
“What’s up, Cap?” Scott has endlessly teased Steve because Captain Wilson has exclusively contracted with him ever since his first time.
Except for the tiny bit of study he did while they had been in hiding at his safe house, Tony hadn’t spent a lot of time concerned with how the serum worked with his preternatural physiology. Bruce probably had, but Tony steered clear of it first because it was biology and Tony wasn’t a biologist by any stretch of the imagination, and second because part of him wanted to deny the differences in his vampire body with other vampires. He wanted to be accepted as one of the coven, not singled out. Sure, as a human he enjoyed the spotlight, but vampire covens were centuries old and showing up different rocked the boat in ways that signaled danger.
Going up the metal ladder, they step onto the bridge. Jamison turns to Tony and nods to Steven. For a moment, Tony sees a flinch cross Steven’s face but he quickly recovers and greets the Master of the Fleet.
Without ceremony or review, Steve leaves the living room. Tony stares at the scrolling names of the production crew wondering what the hell he just witnessed. This was supposed to be a great time. Not one like this, not something that drove them further apart.
How the hell is he going to do this before all hell breaks? The leader of the terrorists is only going to believe him for a short period of time. He has to get the work done and now. Slipping off of the cot, he carefully tiptoes his way around Steve and goes to the bench. He flips through his papers, the tools, and scrap metal lying on the side of the table. He needs to fashion the suit of armor and get the hell out of here.
Tony suffered through a shiver of desire and said, “Only if you want to.” Because he didn’t want to think about this as a dream. Somehow, someway, his soul wanted it to be real. The chords sang out, and he hungered for Steve to understand, to comprehend the music.
They all agreed and started toward the doors. The clouds hung in the sky and Tony thought it appropriate, but then he glimpsed a man on the sidewalk awaiting them.
“There’s some that will probably be too small,” Tony says and stands up, tucking what looks like a car battery under his arm and walking the length of the cave to a pile of what looks like rags. He digs through them and finds a shirt. “It’s small but it might do.” He tosses it to Steve who catches it without really looking.
He settled on the floor of the cell, his feet still burning from the transformation. Every shot of light like a pixel around him shone bright and pierced his vision. The resolution, the contrast, was all too real, too perfect in their aspect to take in at once. Every cell of his body spoke to him. The sensitivity overload might drive him mad, but he concentrated instead on Steve huddled nearly unconscious on the floor.
“Your birthday is on the third of July?” Tony abhors small talk. It bothers him. Feels like he’s slowly being flayed to death.
“Why does it sound like your Frodo and I’m Samwise?” Steve asks. “I hope you don’t think like that. That you’re Frodo with an evil ring to bear?”
“Really?” It shocks Tony. “I’d think you’d love it. Boy going off to defeat evil. Stormtroopers. Very Nazi, World War II type of things.”
That’s the question, isn’t it? Tony longs to tell him how much he enjoyed watching Steven work. How he’s proud of the omega. How being with Steven – Tony thinks just might make him a better person. Already he’s learned so much. He’s learned to question everything he holds dear.  If there’s one thing that Tony values is knowledge. The fact that Steven presents him with more information, makes him query the rights of society – that’s something wonderful and dangerous.
He needs to hear Steve. He needs to know they are on the same page, in the same book. “Hungry?” he says over the intercom in the helmet.
“Nanites,” Tony says. “I did it before. I should be able to do it again. We have to introduce nanites into the system or systems that are affected by the entanglement.”
“Well, Shuri seems to know her stuff,” Tony remarked but left it there. Steve appreciated the non-confrontational way Tony brought up the facts. It helped. So much had happened that adjusting to the changes wouldn’t be easy.
“You don’t want to wait and find out what the doctors have to say?” Bruce asked. Judgement along with shame filled his eyes. They had worked together as science brothers all these months, but the soul pack stood between them like a wall. Now it transformed into a wall of thorns and agony. Tony needed to get away from all of their prying eyes, their minds, their souls. He needed safety.
“Hold on, Captain.” Pierce paced in front of him. “Keep that in and we might even let Agent Barton leave the building. Unharmed.”
Steve attempted to reach him, to get him to respond, but his body stayed lax and his soul remained a dreadful single beat. Trapped, Tony emitted a sense of being trapped and isolated. Steve held back his own boiling emotions, since he wanted to jump up and scream at the terrified youth and his sister, ask them what the hell they did. Though, Steve had to confess, the urge to yell at Bucky overwhelmed him as well. Wasn’t the pack supposed to save them from such reactions, didn’t it permit a deeper understanding? Even as he thought it, the flashes of images came to him. They were the same images that hunted him as he took down von Strucker, the same shocking sensations that nearly distracted him enough that his assailant almost took him down instead. Every second of Tony’s mother’s death had been shared along the soul lines. Steve was surprised that actual astral projections like holographs hadn’t danced in the courtyard of the fortress. How could Bucky share such memories? Why would he?
“I know,” Tony said because he did know. He understood that Peggy was gone, that one of the last links to his time, his home, had died leaving Steve behind, and as he thought it – the idea of Steve being left behind leaked through the bond. Steve shuddered next to him and covered his face as if he experienced shame in his weakness.
“You know how it is. They call it PTSD now?” Steve used that a lot in the beginning with Bruce, before he finally opened up about the darkness of the ice. “Plus the whole ice thing compounded it.”
In minutes the cradle’s low hum dissipates and completely fades away, then the clamps release, and the table he’s lying on rises. Cho and her team surround him. Her smile is tender and she looks down on him with a certain softness. “We think the gland has taken. It was touch and go for a while, but we have good circulation now and the nerve stem is responding. We’re going to take you to recovery now.” She states all of this as she unlocks the cuffs around his wrists. “Sorry about this. You kept clawing at the incision site. We had to start the cycle over three times because of it. You’ve been in the cradle for seventeen hours.”
“Not if you don’t want the stock to go into freefall. By the way, the NRA and the Conservatives for American Liberties have condemned you and have petitioned the government not to buy any more weapons from Stark Industries.”
“Make it one.” Tony didn’t want to sound like he was begging but this was far outside his expertise and he needed a cool head around – not that Happy and Pepper didn’t supply that but neither of them had military training to deal with the guards.
He escapes down the ladder and goes to the meeting room. No one is assembled yet so he slips on his glasses and asks Penny where the hell everyone is.
The chain sounds again and then Tony glimpses a foot shift into the light. It looks human. “JARVIS?”
“I am not one soul. I never was, Schmidt, you just can’t understand how humans are made. You don’t get it. We’re not made to be one, we’re made to be many.” The force of the souls trapped in the realm resonates around them a pulsating crescendo of energy. “Your lies have been revealed. You cannot keep us here any longer.”
“All caps SHIELD. It was Coulson’s big idea really before he died. You probably don’t know him. He didn’t make a big name for himself, but he had this idea of a defensive shield against the incursions. It didn’t work but the idea lived on,” Tony says.
“We’re his team,” Clint said and Tony swore he witnessed the muscles of Clint’s biceps tense as if he might pull an arrow right now.
Tony reaches up, touches his glasses, and then slips them down his face. He takes his thumb and forefinger to his eyes and pulls away the contacts. After that he tugs off the glimmering jewel at his neck. “I’m not going to hide. People who are not typically abled shouldn’t have to hide or conceal who they are. They shouldn’t have to remain in the shadows or use optical illusions to be accepted. No. Never. I’m not doing it anymore.”
The memories of a hole in space haunt him. Quickly he cleans up and shuts off the shower. He towel dries his hair. With little effort Tony dresses in jeans and a long sleeved black t-shirt. He doesn’t even care what’s on the front of it. His mind’s focused on Steve. By the time he shoves a poptart (why does he have these wretched things in his penthouse – Thor isn’t around) down his gullet, he’s on the elevator to the medical floor. When he arrives, the doctors are huddled at the nurses’ station. He should check in with them, but he doesn’t – he heads directly to their only current patient (The Tower also has a medical facility on the first floor for people who cannot afford healthcare. That clinic is full time – 24/7. Most of the doctors – top notch- if they sign on as medical staff for Tony Stark and the rest of the Avengers have to put in their time in the free clinic. It all works out).
“Clint.” Natasha elbows him. “Steve, Clint will escort you to the prince’s ship. Unfortunately, the prince will assign you one of his guards to protect you while in his service. I can’t do anything about that, but-.” Clint hands her a small metallic bracelet. “All brothel registrants are allowed an Alert. Press this and we’ll know you’re in trouble and need help.”
When Tony concentrated on the energy binding them together the sensation of loss and flailing rammed hard into his chest and then the security, the hope, the wish from Steve caught him, brought him back to sanity. “Wow, I didn’t realize. I usually.” He blinked a few times and Steve grasped his shoulder. “I usually just see it mathematically. A little bit of the metaphysical, but mainly math helps me understand it. But that was freaky.”
Tony put up his hands and jumped off the stool. “Wait, wait, wait. Don’t you do that. Don’t you think that he’s on some pedestal as well. Because he’s not. He’s a man with a lot of faults. A huge shit ton of faults.”
“That’s not Steve,” Bucky said under his breath. He hung back in the crowd, but Tony heard it in his head. He peered over to Bucky. The man grimaced and shook his head slowly.
Steve’s half hard, but willing to forgo carnal desires for some food. He skipped lunch and the thought of his stomach protesting right in the middle of sex is not acceptable. He holds the prince’s hand and leads him to the table.
“Secretary Pierce insisted on providing the prince with security forces of his own to ensure his well-being. The Strike Team is only allowed in the lower sections. Have you seen them elsewhere?”
“Oh? What? I’d like to hear about Steve’s night with.” Tony turns to Rhodey. “What did the media call him? A brick house? That guy you were with?”
Strange pressed his lips together in a tight line. “No, I’m afraid it will come to the fore without your conscious knowledge of it. You will be in the middle of an interaction and you will speak the word. Both of you will be marked, tattooed with the brand. And you will be forever soul connected.”
Tony hoots and claps his hands. “All this time, they were just that close. You are a sneaky bastard.”
“Hurry up, hurry up!” Bucky yells and picks off another two ships as he watches the explosions from Sam’s blasts. But the fighters replenish as quickly as they knock them out. “We can’t keep it up forever.”
“A man named Baron Wolfgang von Strucker,” Maria answered and pointed to the tablet. “Some intel puts him in Eastern Europe during the last of the Cold War, even in North Korea after that. More recent intel links him to Sokovia and some small cells of what might actually be Hydra. There was a small covert SHIELD operation there.”
Getting to the door to Tony’s quarters, Steve goes to enter, and the door remains locked. He tries again and it doesn’t budge. “JARVIS?”
“You said you would regret it when you let Bucky and I go. You said that you would regret it. I think you do,” Steve says. The time is coming. His time is approaching. He can’t wait much longer. He needs to get to the blocks.
“No. No.” He walks over to join Steve near the floating image of the armor. “Tell me what attracted you to this one.”
As the hours, as the days wear on he finds himself on the canopy rack over the bed. He’s in presentation position, with his face in the pillows, his knees on the mattress and his ass in the air, but his arms are tied up to the rack above the bed. It puts a unique stress on his shoulders and the alpha rocks into him. He’s thick with the knot and Steve rides it well.
It could be his end. This might be ruse by Ultron to get him to fall to his ‘death’ in this virtual world. The light gets brighter as they clamber down the hill. Clint gets up, his chest and legs gush blood, but there’s a red light shining from his eyes. The glitches are back. His figure switches between the archer and the sword fighter.
“Don’t want to give away all of my secrets,” Tony says, pushing away the hair plastered to his face. “Doing this was risky enough.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, and all the hope and belief Tony’s had over the past month blossoms in Steve’s chest. He can’t hold it; it’s so huge. He manages to say, “Let’s go back to the house. Get some coffee, eggs. Whatever you want.”
One of the things Steve loves the most about mornings is watching Tony wake up. Often he delays his morning run to be able to see it. Tony isn’t the kind of person who wakes up immediately and jumps out of bed ready to go. Maybe it’s because he spends so much of his time awake, foregoing sleep for the pursuit of the mind and the advancement of technology. The world would be a bitter cold place without Tony Stark to lead the way in so many different fields. Even now, there’s a summit at the United Nations about clean energy and the great difference Stark technology has brought to the field. They should be attending it – but they won’t – not today – they have more important things to do today.
Tony splashes at the water futilely. The spray doesn’t even hit the lion. “What? I needed a bath.” He rubs at his chin. “Need a good shave too, but we can wait on that.” He notices the narrowed eyes, the slight grimace to his lips. “What? Are you angry with me?”
“Well, no. Usually I take a date to the Foundation’s Galas. So, I need one.” Tony waits. His expression placid as if he just asked Steve to tie his shoes.
“I think, in time, he’ll see that. He has seen that. Actually,” Nat says and he knows she’s right. Tony confessed that much to him already. “But what I mean is – we fail to see the bigger picture. Not with you or Bucky, and not even with the Accords. What I mean is our clan, our family.”
“Well, that’s good at least.” Steve stays in place next to Tony on the bed. Tony doesn’t sleep restfully but fitfully and Steve worries that the implant has caused hidden damage. Pietro excuses himself, and Steve gives him a half smile as he leaves. Staring out the large windows Steve sees the thick dark clouds coming in across the ocean. From Tony’s windows the whole oceanscape can be seen. It’s beautiful and Steve wonders if he’s ever seen whales from his window. From where Steve sits, he can see the small hilltop that they sat on and watched the sunrise over the house. It was a beautiful moment, but now it’s distant and gray. He hears the copter blades before he sees it. How Pepper called on a helicopter so fast he doesn’t have a clue, but as soon as the helicopter lands the house goes into full action mode like there’s an alert, and there is, of course.
“What does that mean exactly?” Tony says and pulls the blankets off, sliding to the floor. He’s only wearing a tunic and nothing more. They spent the evening together. The scraps from the dinner they shared is still in the lounge area of the suite. No servant would dare enter the presentation suite while it is occupied.
That was a remark on Tony’s tendencies to punish before speaking. Over the course of their short time together, Tony admits that he’s made it a project to ensure proper training of his omega. Even as he realizes it, the recognition that it is Estane’s old influence on him, the warnings about what an untrained, feral omega could do, the harm that would come to Tony if he didn’t subdue a bonded omega. Maybe a new approach is in order?
An abashed heat warms Steve's face and he's not certain if he should be insulted or honored by Tony's action. He nods and sits. The table between them is laden with an assortment of foods, some of which Steve cannot even identify.
Every word rooted deep within Steve, tangling with his doubts and growing through the terrors that followed him into the night. He raised his hand and smoothed a finger down Tony’s face, staring into those alien eyes. Yet, he saw not the eyes of a Divini, but the soul of someone he loved, the man he loved, the one he’d trusted all those years ago to save him from the brink of despair. Now, that same man stood before him, both of them dangling over the abyss with only each other to hold onto and hope for salvation.
“A spy? For the Kree? One of our own?” Obie says and, reaching down, clasps Steve’s shoulder, and heaves him to his feet. “You better have a good explanation for this.” Obie glowers at Steve, his bald head gleaming with sweat. “Get Prince Anthony immediately.”
Before long and after the kitchen is spotless clean, Tony wanders back to his work in the basement. He’s itching to finish the job. One thing that he hates is leaving a job like this not complete. He switches on the lights and rummages through some of the shelving units to find more wires and tools he might need. He sorts the mess and then examines what he’s already done. It shouldn’t take too much longer to fix up the rewire job. He finds a certain serenity in doing work with his hands.
He kicks as the side of the large ominous machinery next to them as they hide. The impact of his bare feet (why the fuck are his feet bare) causes the plating to dent and then he tears it off using only his hands. With the plating to shield them, Steve grasps Tony and they head toward the door. The bullets ping, singing off the metal.
Tony shrinks back, his horse follows by shuffling away a few steps from Shield.  “I know your friend is important to you,” Tony says after a time.
“I don’t need to feel the wind on my face,” Tony mutters, but Steve takes his hand and heads toward the pier. He narrates the entire walk until they get to the dock.
“It’s not an infestation,” the caped wonder said. His stare hardened like crystal. “Magic has always been part of the universe. Believe me, I was as surprised as any other.” He dragged a finger along the table, leaving not a streak of oil in the polish but instead a lingering flare of magic. “It’s part of a bigger world, a larger universe we’re only now starting to truly understand.”
Tony wanted to agree, but still he recalled how he floundered. How the arc reactor nearly killed him, how he ruined his relationship with Pepper. Right now, all he had was the soul pack. “I can’t do this to him.”
Bruce shook his head. “Don’t go there, Tony. You don’t know what Steve’s been through. Hell, I don’t know what he’s been through. You can’t expect him to answer your cosmic questions right now.”
“This was always the plan. Go.” Steve trembles and the light, that blur aura Tony witnessed before reappears. It’s weaker, so much weaker, and it throbs a purple color turning to blue as Steve’s condition deteriorates.
“Because,” Tony says and then rubs at his eyes. He throws himself back in the chair. “Obie, I know what has to be done, I just don’t know if I can do it.” He climbs to his feet, and he looks older than his years. “There are things in this universe, millions of ways to get a resolution of sorts. This one, this one means I sacrifice myself. I become the Conclave and I don’t know if I’m that selfless. If I can take on that mantle and not be corrupted by it.”
He yanks off the supplies, which are not that much, and distributes them between Shield and Tony’s horse. The pony appreciates it and nudges his nose at Steve. He strokes him, and then frees him of the saddle.  He sets the saddle to the side of the trail. They can retrieve it on the way back. Once he pulls the pack horse’s blanket off, Steve ties it to his horse, she’s free to go. He smacks her on the butt, and she trots off.
There were not many Padawans at all so Bucky never felt out of place. His parents were part of the Sentinel Guard – a newly established order that vowed to keep the last remnants of the Jedi and their library safe. As Steve learned the ways of the Force, Bucky took the Sentinel Guard’s Oath. Steven came to his ceremony and smiled that lovely, slightly abashed smile and congratulated Bucky. It had been one of the best moments of his life.
Breakfast turned into a raucous affair. Steve found himself smiling and laughing and holding Tony’s hand as much as he could possibly considering they were both eating. The food was good, the coffee better. When they finished up, Thor and Sam took cleaning duty and Tony announced that the Iron Legion would be arriving within the half hour.
“Strangely enough when Thanos tried to pass through he had been the easiest to banish. The Soul Keeper didn’t want him here-.”
“There’s nothing to be concerned about,” Steve says and fists his hands under the table. “Stark and I are a thing of the past. I’ll do my duty as a part of the Honor Guard. He’s one of the most important delegates to the Peace Conference. He might be able to do some good for the little guy.” He knows he’s appealing to Bucky’s sense of justice, but hell at this point he’ll hang onto any good will he can get from his friend.
Time to face the music. Thinking of facing Steve in the light of day roils his stomach and he bites down on his inner cheek. He stops in the doorway. Last night, their talk in the dark had been enlightening. It revealed a want Tony couldn’t parse, but the ache remained when he woke. It urged him to slip out of bed, to rid himself of confronting Steve so early in the morning. Now his shave and shower are done. He needs to get back to his routine, he needs to ignore the pain threatening and shove it aside. He also needs to decide what the hell to do with Steve. It was only his intention to get Steve free of SHIELD. The husband ploy worked to accomplish his purpose but it’s not going to stop Defense Department representatives and SHIELD spies knocking on his door. It’s the only reason he used the charade of marriage – that’s all. Blu- Steve helped him during his time of need, Tony reciprocated.
“Don’t believe a word of it. Don’t believe your eyes. It’s not real. You’re stuck in the Hub. You need to get out before the worm finishes infecting Ultron.” Steve can see through Tony’s image. He sees the door behind him. “Steve, can you hear me?”
“I doubt anyone can do that. I can’t even get a handle on all of the code. It’s scattered, hidden, but-.” Tony picked up the remote and turned on the large screen television in the room. He used his phone to throw an image on the screen. “I think there’s a vulnerable spot in the code.”
For a moment, Tony sees something pass over her expression – a pained almost despairing look. He stops before he heads to the bonding room below sea level. “I won’t hurt him. I might be a dom, but I’m not malicious. That’s not my nature.”
Therapist Laura: Nice subject change. Yes, I let Tony take my kid to the White House. He’s actually really good with children. Lila misses her dad and maybe if the president sees the effect that this is having on her, we can come up with some more reasonable policies that work for everyone.
The mechanic: It depends on his legal circumstance at the time but possibly. I’m not going to tell Steve that his friend can’t be there even if said friend is the reason why my mom can’t be there.
"And Steve may deserve it. But it did show me how much he cares about you. So I'm not going to try to convince you to leave him because it would hurt him too much." Tony smiled at his words.
“Yesterday’s all Avengers meeting doesn’t actually count either.” Laura rolled her eyes at him. “There was a lot of touching and awkward eye contact, but not a lot of actual talking.”
PS: I know about Happy coming. We spoke and he is really not happy about me almost dying because of the sunflower murder conspiracy. Or avoiding him for the last few months. It’s better now.
Tony Potts: Then, nowhere in your universe is safe. I was on another planet in a completely different solar system. I still watched Peter disappear in my arms.
That's OK. I'm worried too. Petrified really. We've been together for a few days in person and no fighting, so maybe we got it out of our system in Siberia or maybe we’re just better at talking to each other. I'm sure the medication has helped. But we are trying.
“My burdens with.” Tony finished. “Maybe my life with, all aspects of it. I’m semiretired from the superhero stuff, but if the world needs saving, I’m in. But Morgan is my main priority. I need to find somebody who gets that. Pepper gets Morgan but not the other stuff.” Tony confessed.
"I think the sound of the shower would have woken me up anyway.” He said as he pulled Tony back onto the bed for another kiss.
“We are supposed to talk about relationships with our moms. Which is almost something I feel like I can deal with, at least compared to talking about my father. I think it’s the same for you.” There is less baggage and trauma there compared to everything with Howard. But it’s still painful to think about Maria.
TMNS: I’m not sure how to address that spider. Everyone keeps finding out by accident, and they never react well. My aunt freaked out and was about to bring lawyers against Mr. Stark.
Please note that I am unable to upload the chapter to fanfiction.net at the moment. As soon as I’m able to I will upload the chapter there but I think a lot of you read stories on both sides.
Tony Potts: Good choice. Should I be concerned that you know me well enough to recognize who I am from about three paragraphs of rambling? Also, the fact you know me well enough to know that I want to know if our Fitz and your Fitz can hang out is unnerving. How many science-fiction marathons have we watched together?
D FitzSimmons: I'm just frustrated. For these last 22 months, he's been here living this happy life, and I've been dealing with alcoholic Nana for five and a half years. I'm exhausted and angry. I just want her to be okay like the Simmons here. She's just so lovely and sweet and not drunk all the time. That’s the woman my mom told me about.
Counselor Laura: I did a stint as Tony sobriety coach post-Siberia incident. We also lived at the tower for a few months to stay off Ross’ radar. I'm still his AA sponsor. 22 months and going strong. I’m really proud of him.
“Tony feels the same way. He loves kids but can’t have any without at least a sperm donor because of the Palladium poisoning.”
Me: Exactly, but I’m not even sure if that’s enough to get her to put up with me for an extended period of time.
Cuddle fiancé: That her girlfriend may be in Asgard after battling someone that can apparently break Thor’s hammer? No. Did I tell Natasha that Daisy disappeared from Norway with Thor and Loki and hasn’t been heard since then? No. You want me to take less risk.
I'll see you at 2 PM. That's when the next window is between the two timelines. Because of that, we are having an all-hands meeting. You will be there by then, right? Ana will give you details because I’m sleepy. Wanda, why did you do this to me?
Tosha is Natasha Romanoff, the head of the Avengers, or what’s left of the Avengers anyway. Clint is using the name Francis because if you’re going on a revenge killing spree, you’re not going to use your actual name on your phone. Well, your real first name. Apparently, using your actual middle name is okay.
“Okay, you’re both ridiculously noble. It’s sickening, really. It doesn’t change the fact that he’s in love with his Simmons and maybe the moment I actually do anything she’ll pop through a hole in the universe and grab him.” Knowing his relationship track record, that could truly happen.
Me: I always knew my AIs would be my only children, but I'm getting hugs this way. And parent-teacher conferences because Afia wants to go to regular school.
Tony Potts: You're right, but maybe if this works and we bring back frozen Fitz, she will feel like she has a reason to try. At a minimum, we should get back her grandson.
“Everybody is. I know it was a long road to get here but I’m not letting go of Tony. I really do care about him.”
The New Consultant: Benji was busy working on a project with the princess and didn’t go to sleep until 9 AM. Benji is still unconscious. I didn’t want your text message ring tone to wake him up. He’s wearing the headphones, but you know he’s a light sleeper now.
FRIDAY: You’re not actually planning to delay giving the special communication device to Wanda? A courier is currently on its way to her location.
If you hurt Tony again, I will kill you. You did hurt him last time and not just physically. (I knew you were the one responsible for him coming back one gigantic bruise, even before he confirmed it.) He worshiped you as a child. He had every Captain America comic book ever made and more memorabilia than anyone else except for maybe Phil. Then as an adult you found him lacking. That he’s only as good as his suits and his bank account. He never really did recover. Probably because a part of him believes that to be true. Tony has always been more than that. I’m just not sure if you really see it. I’m not sure if you want to see it.
Anthony: I’m still sober despite being eviscerated on international television. The sad thing is I really can’t argue against most of those labels. I am a high maintenance man child even if I don’t fuck around anymore.
Nomad: Because I’m not sure if either one of us is ready to dive into your Howard issues, I’m going to ask how your coffee date with POTUS went.
Me: The Aunt and counselor left on a mission Saturday, but they’ll be back tomorrow in time for breakfast. At least that’s what the counselor said in his text message to me.
Morgan’s dad: I already know how to get back to the past. Deke was copying my theories, and that’s what he used to build the time watch. It should’ve taken him to our past, not other Laura’s present.
Anthony: Keep that to yourself. Someone is trying to keep a secret identity to avoid registration. By the way you are the only one I've been pouring my heart out too. So you don’t have to worry about losing me to a nice lady from Queens who can’t cook.
Friday: Yes, because Ana 2018 passed me tactical uniform specs. Although I will need to contact General Okoye for some resources, I’ve been given an authorization code.
“I have been neglecting Pepper and the kids. But I just want to spend as much time with you as possible and Christmas would be better for that. With SI being closed for the holiday, I’m thinking about bringing some friends as well as the oldest kid.” Also, Steve just had a feeling that because of certain events earlier this year (watching video footage of his parents be murdered just days before Christmas 1991), this Christmas may be harder for Tony than usual. It would be good for Steve to be there.
Me: By spy standards, but maybe just for the moment. She is on standby like the Bulletproof Pacifists.
Red phone: It's easy for you to say that. For you, sticking to your principles is more important than anything else. But for someone like me, all we do is compromise. We have to. We have too much riding on our shoulders to be headstrong. We have to put the needs of the many ahead of ourselves.
I’m going to sleep in my own room, not in the cuddle pile going on between Benji, MJ, and Flash. See the picture attached. They are in one of the Embassy guest rooms altogether because there are king-size beds here. They remodeled rooms on this level not to look like barracks to ride out the apocalypse. Everybody’s wearing clothing, but they're just the cutest. A sleepy Benji just crawled in between the two. I have video.
You shouldn’t be afraid to tell me that you have a boyfriend. I knew about Artie for a while. Almost since the beginning. We shared an apartment for how long? I saw the bite marks. You bruised like a peach back then.
Me: Yeah but that doesn’t work but apparently precog are a thing now. I mentioned it last week. Coulson’s team has met more than one. Apparently one of them predicted my Ultron fuck up. I really wish someone would have told me that ahead of time. That would’ve been really helpful although apparently no one at team Coulson knew about the vision until after the fact.
Me: I didn’t yell. Not after the initial reaction anyway. He told me he was bitten by a spider, but I don’t know if I believe that. How does getting bit by a spider give you the ability to crawl on walls? Walls and apparently the Washington Monument. Oh God. He’s afraid of heights. He threw up on the observation deck when his class took a field trip to the Empire State building.
Stephen C: Maybe possibly. He kept talking about how he would do our wedding. Apparently, we are having a night ceremony to cut down on Super villain attacks. He said he would ask once he was sure that it wasn’t going to all fall apart.
The Boy in the Chair: Where are you? Did you really get to meet Captain America? Is he Cool in person?
Love: And who better than a former high school guidance counselor who just happens to be married to an Avenger?
“Yes, actually. Everything’s just kind of all mixed up. We barely even talked before he went into cryo-freeze again. Although, he did apologize for ruining my friendship with you.”
BITC: Of course, I did. Ana may have helped. See, she likes me and hates Flash because she has taste.
“I don’t know if ‘fix’ is exactly the right word. Regardless, it will take a lot of work, including answering invasive icebreaker questions," Tony replied. “And maybe some medication.”
Me: Nope. I'm pissed and a little disappointed that something like this happened again. I trust people and then they try to kill me. And I’ll let it happen because I was distracted.
Skye quake: OK we definitely have to make another AI to take Friday’s place, now that she’s a real girl.
Red phone: I'm almost tempted to make them their own supersecret communication device so they stop using us as intermediaries for their teenage shenanigans.
Red phone: I think if you just want to stay a mild-mannered therapist and not run into burning buildings to save people, you wouldn’t have to sign the accords. The lawyers are on standby if you ever want to do this.
Cuddle Bunny: No, mostly because you decided to revive the project without telling anybody what you were doing.
Anthony: Another thing to talk about in therapy once you get to that point. Unfortunately, I have my own therapy appointment to get to. Actually I’m late too because apparently I forgot about it until Yo-Yo just showed up to my lab to drag me there.
Anthony: Of course, the Director is also making me take a mandatory lie detector test, but at least it's only every six months. Also, I think he's having me do it just to find out what really happened in October 1997.
Me: Also, the project in Oakland already raised the few flags. I think that got announced while I was distracted with the Vulture fiasco. They did have a representative at Johannesburg for the first time and that person gave all the best suggestions. So again, I am not surprised.
Tony: Did I mention that in the last hour, I have been politely yelled at bureaucrat style by representatives from four different countries for making Avenger weapons, but not releasing them to the public?
Chief Mechanic: Actually, Stevie bear is reading this over my shoulder completely naked. He may have been the one who made me unlock everything for the Chief Monkey Lover. Not for the kids. I really wish I could be doing things with him instead of having to have this conversation with you.
P Parker: We were, but because the Mumbai agreement was ratified yesterday, the president called him in. I think they wanted to get the pardon out of the way, so they could get to wedding planning. Although I don’t believe they are doing the wedding on April 28 anymore.
Okay, that was weird. Friday shouldn’t be unavailable, even with the EMP problem, unless somebody is purposely cutting off access. Of course, about five seconds after Tony realizes that’s exactly what’s going on the door was kicked in. Tony is not surprised that 10 heavily armed men wearing dog masks and paramilitary gear walked into the room. Nor was he surprised that two were on the floor and severely unconscious before Tony realized that what will be the last model of the suitcase armor cannot assemble when a continuous EMP pulse is going on, especially when they’ve managed to jam Friday. Definitely moving on to the nanotech suit as soon as he gets back to the US.
Red phone: This is easy by comparison. I know you will never love me, but I think maybe you actually like me as a person now, which is more than what we had before.
Me: Still not happy. I think it’s the stress of having to worry about Ross or other third parties trying to kidnap the kids for Avenger bait.
Cuddle Bunny: Sometimes I think you care too much. How can you care about me at all after what I did? If I kept Bucky from falling, then there would have never been a Winter Soldier and maybe your parents would not have died on that December night in 1991. I don’t get how you can still care about me after everything. I don’t deserve it.
“I don’t think Tony will ever hate you. You assume that, but have you actually asked him how he feels?” Because I’m pretty sure most of his feelings are warm and fuzzy. It was also at that moment that Laura remembered that DILF stood for dad I like to fuck.
Friday: I am sending you a primer of what you need to know and what Simmons needs to be informed of.
Me: This happened at the wedding? Piper said he couldn’t keep himself from text messaging you. Apparently, he kept smiling a lot.
Purple Princess: This is the other reason why we're on the Avenger channel right now. Only one of you has diplomatic immunity.
"Stark, stop kissing your boyfriend now.” He heard Agent May say from the door, waiting impatiently. "The plane leaves at five."
Agent 13: No. Lab tests are showing that the bottles of canola oil were switched out with sunflower oil including the two bottles that were unopened. The salad dressing was also contaminated with sunflower seed oil as well as the marinade for the main course. Also the peanut butter for the peanut butter tort was contaminated with sunflower butter.
Anthony: Nope. I think they based the design off of your old Shield uniform, but with the new eagle up front and with 100% more fake muscles.
Purple Princess: Actually, I didn’t know the truth at that point. I just suspected it. This was kind of how Flash and I became friends.
How are you? Yes, I realize that’s a loaded question but I still want to know. I’m worried about you. If Stefan wasn’t here, I would’ve brought you along. I just didn’t want to add more awkwardness to the situation and well Happy told me how you found out that they asked was an asshole and well, everything just feels awkward.
And now for my happy rant:  how absolutely wonderful was the Black Panther trailer? I’m pretty sure I’ve watched it 20 times. I can’t wait for February.
“Exactly. I’m sure a few have reacted badly to me being your boyfriend but not to the fact you have a boyfriend.”
Me: That you and I could fix our relationship or at least start fixing it and me and her are in such an awkward place. I mean it got better after me almost dying, but we’re not back to who we were before.
Me: And well you’re Captain America before the stupid Accords, you could call up anybody in the world and they would want to have dinner with you. Actually quite a lot of people still want to have dinner with you which is why the free Captain America campaign is going so well. The State Department is getting about 100 calls a day and at least four times as many letters. According to my TOS contact, several people are 30 seconds from resigning because of this.
“Which she is probably cool with because she sent him here with a toiletry bag packed with sex toys, condoms, and lube.” Pepper snickered at that. She covered it up by taking a drink of coffee.
Counselor Laura from 2023: Tony is with me but not your Uncle Tony. He's a little different. He has his own daughter [redacted].
StarkAE: Fuck! Is that a guy tied up in web kind of dressed like a vulture? Are those things from the Avengers’ toy supply? How did those pictures end up on Twitter?
Chief Mechanic: I hate it when you have a point. You already know about the alcoholism from Ana. We are going to have to look at your protocols about keeping secrets.
Me: After. I think there’s a good chance that I may be going directly from the airport to the taping. I may not even be able to text you first. Although Friday will send you an email or something.
“That’s not good.” Tony mumbled to himself. He told Leo he was paranoid by putting EMP shielding on all the new Avenger super-duper secret cell phones as well as an EMP alert. Obviously, he was wrong. Once he pushed the alerts away, Tony saw several text messages from Monkey Lover.
“You should. For this to work, we should talk to each other, not just online, but in person. When we have the opportunity, like now."
“I think you can leave as soon as they are sure I’m not a clone or an LMD.” He is sure they will let Fitz out soon. Leo is also sure that he’s going to be here for the foreseeable future. People who hallucinate and have conversations with their evil self don’t get released back into society. That’s been happening more and more, especially when Hunter wasn’t there. They’re all going to realize he’s completely cracked, and he’s never going to get out of this place.
"Actually, I was just looking that data over. I wanted to see if the formula could be tweaked for others.”
"I think the last question of this section is really weird to ask somebody who already has superpowers," Steve commented.
Me: That being said, I cannot guarantee that future messages will be free of pornographic content. Cuddle Bunny is no blushing virgin. Underneath the blue and white American exterior lives a very kinky bastard.
Rogers: Hi, this is Steve. I spoke to Tony a couple of minutes ago after nearly 6 days of avoiding me and I just wanted to see if he really is okay.
Chief mechanic: Apparently, you’re just now starting to undo the damage and inhuman internment camps, but you’ve only been in office with Rice for seven months.
Nomad: Why do you hate Sharon so much? Friday said it had something to do with your relationship with her mother.
Me: I don’t care because that asshole is out. If I was still drinking I would have popped champagne, right there during the press conference. Instead, I had milkshakes with some of my DOS friends. Did I ever tell you his Under Secretary for Environment, Energy, and Economics is ex-SI?
Tony: Funny. Now let us compare the life of Steve Grant Rogers to that of Stefan James Carter. They both look like Greek gods and were raised in Brooklyn by single moms after their alcoholic asshole fathers left but there are some key differences.
BITC: I will not say anything to anyone about Flash being not heterosexual. Besides, it’s not like I have a lot of people to tell. The only person I’m going to be talking to tomorrow is O’Reilly.
“Principal Morita might know you too. He was principal at Midtown previously. He was moved here because both he and the vice principal of Midtown were not snapped, and…” Steve trailed off.
Tony: Okay. I love your version of my mini bio because I think this is the longest series of text messages you actually sent me. It’s good to know that you’re paying attention.
“That’s not reassuring at all,” Steve whispered, and he was sure Tony was thinking the same thing by the way he rolled his eyes.
“We don’t need Tony. Bruce and Simmons are already working on the way to bring you home.” Steve argued.
HSBF: Also, I don’t know if I would call it a “Civil War”. I’ve been in wars. Usually, they involves more than about a dozen people.
Thank you to everyone who read or commented on the last chapter. You’re all absolutely wonderful. Now it’s time for Bucky to bare his heart to his best friend.
Me: I’m so glad that the food is now here, so I don’t have to make small talk with anyone for a while. I hate small talk.
Me: They sent a text but we were preoccupied. I didn’t even think of checking my phone until you left for your breakfast meeting.
Tony: Because Ben wasn’t ready for her to know the truth. She wasn’t ready to hear the truth. It wasn’t that I was deliberately trying to hurt her it was…God dammit.
Anthony: I don’t know. I mean, I don’t want to fly down to an undisclosed location and strangle you know who. But I blame that more on therapy and antidepressants than anything else.
Me: Well good, maybe the next question will not come to pass because I don’t want you to die but if the unimaginable did happen, would you have some unfinished business?
Me: Well, my 30-year-old body wouldn’t be suffering the after effects of Palladium poisoning, so there’s a plus in that direction. However, Aunt Peggy thinking that I was Howard kind of freaked me out. I don’t want to put people through that. There’s also the possibility that my 30-year-old body would be dealing with cocaine withdrawal.
Agent L. Barton: Ned and Peter are doing that now at Empire State. Afia is not because she wants to keep an eye on Flash.
May doesn’t respond to that message. Instead she puts the phone down as Fitz checks on her again. But once she looks at his eyes, she knows that it’s not him. It’s the other one. The one that went through something so bad that the same darkness that she saw in herself after Bahrain was reflected back at her. What the hell happened to him?
Cuddle fiancé: You go on telling yourself that. Nat says we will be at the Playground in 40 minutes.
Me: She told me that even the cleaned up censored version of those answers were more than she wanted the public to ever know about me or my boyfriend. Her job is to manage my image and this was not how she wanted my image to be managed.
“Yes. Oddly enough, Ross stayed on as Secretary of State because he agreed to do so until his successor was confirmed. Unfortunately, that president nominated the head of Roxxon. He withdrew his nomination after the company was found responsible for releasing a toxin into New Orleans that caused rioting and resulted in multiple deaths during Mardi Gras 2017,” that director Mace refused to let them investigate so Leo has no idea what happened and therefore can’t fix it.
“That’s for killing Coulson.” That explains why Daisy chose to send Joey in her place as the inhuman UN Avengers representative. Not that Leo blames her for wanting to get revenge.
“Maybe there is something to that,” Steve said just before he turned on the radio. Thankfully, Friday wasn’t piping in songs of heartbreak this time.
TMNS: So abandoning her to lead the police straight to her father and his illegal activities doesn’t win me any points with her. Actually it got me a knee to the dick. Since she was leaving, the principal just looked the other way. That’s also all over Flash’s Tumbler account. Peter Parker gets his penis punched. The caption reads, Peter Parker gets his penis punched.
Anthony love: Also, Flash is now recuperating nicely in his room because he may have passed out when he found out Benji is Spider-Man. That’s going to be a fun conversation. Am I a sadist for making them share a room with one bed? Maybe. I gave them supplies. The ex is long gone, and I accidentally read a message Flash sent to Peter that involved the words massage and come.
Blue phone: Yes. You know I make questionable decisions when people I care about die. You’re on the list now.
“I told you I’m better at saying ‘I’m sorry’ with things. It’s a bad habit I picked up from Howard. Did you know that he had a custom bracelet designed for all his conquests? They actually go for a small fortune when up for private auction. I should know since I bought most of them to be destroyed, or rather recycled.”
"Thank you again for not googling my past relationship stuff. Thank you so much because I probably wouldn’t be able to do this right now.” Tony said, reaching over to kiss Steve on the mouth. He’s gotten way too used to this over the last few days.” He loved Tony’s kisses. Sometimes they were gentle and sweet. Other times they were hard and wanting, but there was always a genuine sort of honesty to them.
“Afia is nothing like her.” Leo said as he grabbed Hunter’s hand. “Radcliffe was a manipulative selfish person who tried to excuse his behavior with supposedly having good intentions. I didn’t realize the truth until it was already too late. Afia wasn’t crated by him.”
"Possibly maybe. It’s a near thing. It helps that the pilots who died were Shield agent and not outside pilots. At least Happy kept that part of the plan in place. Although a few members of the board would like for us to have a press conference at the new upstate facility introducing Spidey to the world, mask free." Tony explained.
Anthony: No, you needed to. I’m sure you would just apologize for who knows what because you’re such a Boy Scout. Although that doesn’t give her the right to threaten you.
Nomad: If this is going to make problems for you, we don’t have to do it. I just wanted Melinda to float the idea past you. I don’t want you to do something that you’re not ready to do.
Steve: I would go over to the school to get her for breakfast, but I think her teacher would be mad if she missed chemistry.
Anthony: Yay, your pop culture knowledge is almost getting to normal levels. Soon people will be completely unaware that you spent 70 years in the ice.
Me: Surprisingly well. He hugged me for telling him what was wrong instead of continuing the research behind his back like I would have done in the past.
Boss Tony: That is concerning. Ana says that Clint is currently sitting on the couch of the new Malibu house with Nikki. Apparently, they are now blueberries on the ceiling because lunch went badly.
Tony: If I wasn’t in the middle of 12-stepping, I would need like at least three bottles of Jack to answer that question. And thank God they said Mom and not Dad because there isn’t enough liquor in the DC Metro for me to answer that question to a reporter. I'm barely to that point with you, and I still would like a candy bar, or six.
Venom: I’m no longer dependent on social media for my social interactions because, apparently, I have actual friends now.
Monkey lover 2: Can you convince your new AI to tell me where my boyfriend and Simmons are? She won't tell me. I miss Friday.
Me: However for my boyfriend to be able to contact Clint would be weird. They never met and only a secret Avenger would have that information.
“Although, I feel like if you’re still going to be giving Steve away at the wedding, you should at least let me know if you are okay with the prospective location. Simmons sent a 15-page email with tips.”
Me: And maybe Friday didn’t scrub the answers as much as she should have and now Jane thinks that you’re actually former Shield. She doesn’t want to expose you. I decided it was best not to clarify since technically you a former Shield agent.
Recently, I read the Star Wars fan fiction series Obi-Wan Kenobi, the Chosen One by SorciereMystique. Which deals with Obi-Wan Kenobi’s descent into alcoholism and his recovery. It definitely gave me some ideas for this story. It’s a really interesting series, so I encourage everybody to check it out.
“James needs some time to adjust, now that he’s not under Hydra control anymore. I want to be there, but only when he’s ready for me. This has to go at his pace.” After thinking about it overnight and dealing with the May crisis Steve realize he has to do what’s best for Bucky’s recovery, not just what he wanted to do.
Anthony: No more lying, outside of national security matters anyway. We don’t keep things from each other that were able to tell. If this relationship is going to work we have to be honest with one another, even when it hurts.
I’m not happy that your boyfriend decided to make you my step daddy or rather Stefan Carter my stepdad. Sometimes I think he’s 12.
“And that’s on top of everything from yesterday. You’re right, Pepper shouldn’t have to deal with all on her own when it’s not her fault."
A/N (and this is not proofread by someone else because I added it last minute for clarification): For those of you who do not watch Agents of SHIELD, during season two, it was discovered that there was an ancient Kree Temple in what is now San Juan, Puerto Rico. That means it was one of the main places where the Kree’s Inhuman experimentation took place. Therefore, I am going with the theory that individuals of Puerto Rican ancestry have a higher probability of having the Inhuman gene.
Melinda: It’s his cell phone number. I know it because Morgan is always texting Robin from that number.
“This morning when May asked for a divorce. I'm glad you interrupted me to ask me a question because otherwise, I might still be in that room crying.” Steve might actually start crying while driving if he keeps thinking about everything that will change with the end of his marriage.
“Course he did. He was my assistant before he took over for his wife.” Who they lost in the decimation along with Kevin’s youngest son. Pepper wanted to promote Kevin for years, but his job with her allows him to spend time with his three remaining children. “You told him I was here for a little while, and he wanted to make sure I had your back for this meeting.”
“Yes, after we talk for a few minutes first about what you found out from the princess when she visited you in New York.” Of course they were going to have this conversation first.
So yes, Tony and Steve are at the same hotel in the same country. However, Sam and Tony need a few minutes. So what are your predictions for the next conversation? Mean what post as soon as he gets back from proofreading.
TMNS: It wasn’t my secret to tell. It’s against the friend handbook. It would be like you telling everyone my secret identity.
Just because we’re not together anymore doesn’t mean I don’t need to know these things. Because I do. Just call and let me know you’re okay.
Red phone: Now the Avengers consists of 2 1/2 people, 3 1/2 if you count Queens, but I'm not planning to take him out again until he can drive himself to the mission. Most of the time I think I’m the half in the Avenger total.
Tony: That was a Hydra induced heart attack per our friends in the other timeline. Although the fact he made it to the 80s was a small miracle. Daniel was suspicious of Hydra contaminating Shield way back in 55. He told the wrong superior and was almost murdered at a hotel. Aunt Peggy saved his Ass. Daniel was told by a mysterious contact named GR to fake amnesia and not tell Aunt Peggy about Hydra. Or at least that's what they can gather from the Krazy Kanoe files. It was a Shield safe house that has existed longer than Shield itself. I really want to read those.
Red phone: I'm not talking about Rhodey. I'm talking about Secretary Asshole and the acting ATCU dictator, I mean director. Rhodey is different. Because he actually cares about me.
“I think it would’ve been less embarrassing. I should’ve never let May talk me into those pictures.” At least he now knows it was Steve. Also, May is a total badass. And he adores her. Tony should be jealous, but he’s not. He deeply respects the woman.
Ana Jr.: This is sufficient for now. I will take your words and compose an actual report for Acting Dir. Stark.
Tony: Except that is not happening yet because apparently, Deke is missing. So would you like to explain why your daughter drew a picture of Clint wearing a nanotech suit that I know Deke borrowed the design from my servers and Clint‘s wife that's been snapped for the last five years?
Anthony: You know, as soon as this is over, you’re going to have to sign the replacement trading cards that I found for him.
Red phone: Everything is. Pepper and I are not able to work together right now. Not in person anyway. We can function through email. So she will be handling most operations from the West Coast office and I’ll be handling things from the East, with only having to see each other at the semimonthly board meeting.
Thank you to everybody who read or reviewed the last conversation. You are all lovely. I’m so happy you enjoyed the artwork in the last chapter.
Steve: I know. Robin told me. She's usually more talkative after coming back from the cabin. It's good for her. I'm a little worried her only friend, outside of her sister, is almost 8 years younger than her, but it’s been good.
Counselor Laura: They're not great, especially when you're in the middle of a separation/divorce. Connor is also upset because Tony and Clint want to send all the kids to Malta to get them out of the line of fire. At least the ones without superpowers. I doubt Flash and MJ are going anywhere, partially because Flash is 18, and MJ listens to no one except maybe Daisy. She’s still MIA with Thor and Loki.
D Fitzsimmons: Yes. I was working on that when Nana and Romanoff went off to Japan to convince Barton to be the new guinea pig. Scott was out after getting turned into a baby.
Tony: Let’s see during the last eight months I have re-come out as gay, or rather, as bisexual (even though the press keeps erasing that) with a blonde God of a boyfriend who looks a lot like an international fugitive in South Africa at a conference. In addition, said boyfriend is more than a decade younger than me, if we go by the birthdates on the press release.
Me: I think in a lot of ways your idea of friendship is similar. You will go to great lengths to protect people you care about. Even sacrificing yourself. I think that’s one of the things I love about you even though it scares me.
“I think the biggest thing was Shield being in pieces and The Avengers not being on speaking terms. We've already fixed that. We actually have almost triple the number of Avengers along with the Puerto Rico squad.” Afia told everyone.
: Royal Genius, the Princess genius, and HRH. HRH is my current designation in Friday’s system. Dr. Stark and Capt. Rogers know that I am reading these messages. I will continue to monitor for security reasons and will scrub when necessary.
Once again, this conversation contains information we discovered in WandaVision, but it’s been altered for the new timeline. (This is also the first chapter I did any proofreading/re-writing to after Loki episodes began airing.)
Purple arrow: Probably because I’m not sure how to answer. I wasn’t here, and Laura’s gone. I want her back, but at the same time, we are in the middle of multiple alien invasions, apparently.
Anthony love: But you know I can’t sleep when I don’t know where you are so maybe I should try to debrief you. I know Karen sent you the minutes from this evening’s all Avenger briefing, but I got a headache during the briefing, so I’m sure reading that dense report will cause the same in even a super-soldier.
Me: It’s the truth. You are not Captain America anymore. You don’t even want me to call you Captain Sexy Pants.
Me: Although because of that, we are doing exercises tomorrow all in Spanish. So if you ever plan on coming back, you better brush up on your Spanish.
Counselor Laura: Acting director, my Tony can’t get through a confirmation hearing for being too independent and way too gay. Also, Steve is still a bit of an asshole. It’s a universal trait. But he’s getting better at acknowledging that in my timeline.
Football Hunter: As for the things that will still happen, one of those things is Puerto Rico, which you can actually affect more at SI. The lack of electricity was a contributing factor to what happened from what you told me. SI’s clean energy work can help with that.
Image 4: Steve’s drawing of Tony on top of him in the lab getting ready to engage in activities that would raise the rating of this story to NC-17. Both Tony and Steve are shirtless and getting ready to lose their pants.
Maybe you're angry because you had this idea of Tony and Pepper living happily ever after with 1.7 children somewhere in upstate New York. Now it’s me and Tony. Although there are a lot more children than originally planned, mostly with superpowers.
“I’m not five. Also, I thought Friday was banned from talking to Agent Barton.” Clint decided to refer to this Laura as Agent Barton only. Despite Natasha's argument, she was not his Laura.
Me: Because I can. Because you need me to. I don’t think you’re ready to let go yet. I mean you did choose to move on to Agent Carter Jr. She can definitely kick ass like Aunt Peggy did, if nothing else.
“Oh. Is it okay to say that I’m sort of happy that I helped you figure that out even if I kind of always hated those posters? I never liked being a dancing monkey for the government. I still don’t. I despise those posters.”
“They would’ve eventually got back together, if it wasn’t for him.” Happy accused. And considering that Tony was in such a bad place when they started talking to one another, he could see a romantic reconciliation happening just because Tony was so lonely.
“But you’re planning on experiencing it firsthand momentarily. Speaking of experience, you dated Melinda May and you never told me?” Natasha asked.
I despise this one-way exchange of information. They want to know everything about where I’m from, but won’t tell me anything of use. Of course, I’m holding some things back as well. No way am I going to mention that Leo decided not to look for a way to come back to his original timeline and is essentially married to someone else. I’m pretty sure this Simmons is holding on by a thread. She tried to come to see me once and started crying. I overheard somebody saying something about Fitz also being dusted, which confuses me. I would love for clarification, but again no one is telling me anything.
Me: Yep. She’s in the love zone. Also, good thing Yo-Yo and May are technically Avengers since they won’t be in the line of command of their boyfriends and won’t violate ATCU dating policy. You don’t want to know all the hoops Fitzsimmons are having to jump through.
Special thank you to Misaky0, my collaborator on this story. Normally she just does the artwork but in this she helped me with some of Yo-Yo’s dialogue.
Although, please try to get her to talk to Suarez or anybody else about what happened. I’m glad they’re working on getting you on the right mix. It does take a little while, but I do feel better now that I’m on medication. I’m even coming up with better ideas because I’m able to focus.
There are a couple of things that I gleaned from Ragnarok that will be used but only little things because again the events of the movie haven’t taken yet in this universe. I also doubt that we will be affected by Runaways or the Punisher. They are running in their own lane, but we shall see. I reserve the right to drawl anything from any other part of the MCU that will enhance the story, except for probably the Inhumans because that show is exiled from my community.
Tony: This is Pepper. He will talk to you after the meeting. I am seriously regretting the President sanctioning your relationship, so he can speak to you all the time.
TMNS: See if there is hot chocolate in the kitchens and make a cup for you and MJ. I will do damage control. I always have your back.
"I leave for ten minutes to talk to my brother, and you two start fighting. You're both adults. If it wasn't for Peter, you could've completely wrecked what we were working on." The princes almost yelled.
I just went to my first comic con last weekend (dressed as the Ross staff member that Tony keeps driving crazy). Unfortunately, not Philadelphia, but DC’s Awesome Con. I did get an autograph from Elizabeth Henstridge a.k.a. Simmons from Agents of SHIELD and heard Karl Urban sing the praises of the Thor 3 script in person (I am not even going to try to dictate the full name of that movie). Apparently there are some interesting casting surprises yet to be announced, but he couldn’t say anything more. All in all it was a fun weekend, even if it put me a little behind in the writing rotation.
Me: But not Ross, not at all. I know he has his own agenda and I’m working with people like his advisor on enhanced person affairs, Ana Karr, to make sure he doesn’t turn everyone enhanced into his own private army. That’s why I’m spending so much time in DC right now.
