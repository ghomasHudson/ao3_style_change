“Jay, call Grumpy Bear.”
“Yeah Tones I think it is. Stop overthinking, I know you're fundamentally incapable of that, but please, just trust me on this one. Now, I've gotta go, there's this thing called sleep which most of us humans need, don't suppose there's anything you'd know about that is there?”
“Are we ready?” Rhodey asks, when the last of the suitcases in the room is neatly zipped and locked.
There were two tall big sixes hassling a tiny elderly beta woman.  As he watched they made a grab for her purse and pushed her over.  No one moved to help her, what the hell were they waiting for?  Steve didn’t miss a beat.  He ran to the woman’s side, patting her over to ensure nothing was broken.  He remembered his neighbor, Mister O’Brian breaking his hip after a fall much gentler than this one.
“What's your name, son?” Steve asks, knowing already they won't kick him out.
he used to be. Being Iron Man, living in a mansion full of people that for some reason seem to actually
“That we do, sometimes by ourselves, like you are right now, champ, but a lot of times as a team.”  He rocked back on his heels, stuck his hands a little deeper into his pockets.  “I can show you all the features later but, I came down to ask if um.  You were hungry?  I realized we didn’t feed you, and then there was the whole thing with that Namor guy.  Sorry, I’m probably interrupting, you probably wanted to be alone...” He trailed off with a wince, probably because Steve was staring at him.
“I'm so good, great, great and good.” Tony stammers. Steve is suddenly
Two months after their return from being scattered, Steve declares Tony legally dead. It's the worst day of his life, and Steve has had enough bad days to fill a book.
“Shall I fetch you one?” JARVIS asks, fingers tightening on Tony's shoulder.
“Oh. Don't mention it Steve.” Tony, always so quick to brush off compliments. “You made it good too.” He adds, after a moment of silence.  “For me. You made this-” He clears his throat, kissing Steve's cheek. “Dad always hated this time of year, I spent a lot of time alone while he and mom went off to wherever. This was nice. Really nice.”
“Steve, baby,” he says slowly.  “Are you-are you really planning on
“Do not get into a debate with me right now about which of us is prettier, buster,” Tony says, and Steve can hear the smile in his voice. He peppers Steve's face with tiny fleeting kisses, like a butterfly landing and then flitting away, and his lovely clever fingers tap, tap, tap over his chest. It makes him feel light, good, as if his belly is full of bubbles, he feels lit up inside just to hear that tone from Tony, to be able to revel in his clear affection and attention.
sized, it's not my fault that you and Thor are giving the Jolly Green Giant a run for his money. I'm not even that much shorter than you, this is discrimination against those of us with non godly physiques, I'm going to lodge a complaint...with...someone.” Tony says, trying to maintain his dour demeanor in the face of Steve picking him up and spinning them around in a dancing sort of twirl. It's not working out very well for him.  He should take Steve dancing one of these days.  "You'll be hearing from my lawyer."  He adds for good measure.  He can feel the corners of his lips twitching though, so it can't be too convincing.
“You're prettier,” He sighs, reaching up sightlessly and pulling Tony down against him. He goes down with a soft 'oof' of air and a laugh, tangling their legs together immediately.
“I already agreed to go to the game, read up on our team and everything.”  Steve said, continuing on with as much earnestness as he could muster.  Tony’s eyes went a little wider, his mouth opened and then shut.  “Just give me a moment and I’ll be packed in a jiffy.  Say, how do you think I can bring my shield?”
“And if words prove unsuccessful then I shall pummel the fool with my hammer. He toys with things he understands not.”
“See you back at the tower Steve.” He murmurs giving Steve one last look, the expression in his eyes raw as Happy comes around to shut the door; hiding Tony from view. Steve slumps, frustration and longing coiling together in the pit of his stomach until he wants to go charging after the Rolls-maybe pull Tony out of the car and shake him until he sees the truth. Instead he settles for wandering back to the tower, where Jan takes one look at him and declares it's time for hot chocolate.
“Sorry, I just realized I forgot to tell you. If you need anything I'm just down the hall-to the right across from you.” He's speaking quickly, tapping away at a clear pane of what looks like glass, but is covered in long scrolling threads of incomprehensible math.  “Scratch that, to be fair the likelihood of me actually being in my room is kind of ridiculously low. If you need me talk to Jay or Iron Man they always know how to find me.” He slides his fingertips over the glass and a bright blue glowing shape pops out. Stark eyes it critically. Steve is fascinated.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony was speaking with Natasha when he returned, but he went quiet at Steve’s approach.  He had both gloves on, but the right one, his thumb was exposed.  Steve flushed, back in his day, that meant someone was angling for a kiss.  He didn’t think that was the signal Tony was trying to give him, no matter how pretty his smile was when Steve got up close to him.
“Are you happy?”  Steve asks, before he can think too hard on why he shouldn’t ask.  “With me, are you, are you happy?”
When he surfaces a bit, Tony is stroking over his cheeks gently, murmuring sweet words in his ear.  Steve is aware he's still buried inside Tony, still hard, but that seems inconsequential. He strokes over Tony's back, presses his thumbs into the line of his spine.  He's slightly damp with sweat, the heady scent of his skin and sex makes Steve firm up more, but he stays still, doesn't move, content to hold Tony and touch him now that he's allowed to.
“To spread my legs?” Tony says with a shrug. He's being honest here, and Rhodey's heard worse things from him before.
Once more a million thanks to blossomsinthemist for being the best!  All my loves <3
There's several messages from Steve too; questions about tech Tony strongly suspects are just an excuse to send a message, reminders that Steve really wants to see him soon, and then a blurry picture of Steve looking hangdog with the caption '
"I would really suggest you shut up now, Justin.  Or oh boy are you going to regret it!"  Jan yells.  She's tiny now, fluttering around the bars with her Wasp's Stingers pointed in zapping position. It falls on deaf ears though.  Hammer is fully in his performance now.  He's right up against the bars, staring into Tony's eyes with the same sort of overblown confidence he always has.
“Uh-” Steve manages, stepping a little closer, afraid that if he moves too fast this will all prove to be some kind of dream.
“Of course I still want to date you Steve. You really have no idea, do you?” He says almost to himself, pushing up onto his knees to press careful but still toe curlingly delicious kisses to his lips.
“I'm going to go pick up your cough medicine from the pharmacy.” Natasha leans down to kiss Tony's forehead before she leaves. Tony seems too exhausted to complain, merely grumbling and snuggling further into Steve's arms.
“Sorry I didn’t make the ride back with you, I was making sure I had a room set up for you, got to take care of my guests, you know how it is.”  He raised a hand as if he was about to reach out to Steve, then pulled it back, pointing at another doorway and explaining it led down to a training room.  Steve privately wished Iron Man had touched him.  The armor was so warm, and he was beginning to feel the cold creep of the drop even more keenly.
“It's nothing, really Steve. It's-it's nothing” Tony lies. They say the truth will set you free, but Tony would chain himself to a boulder if it meant one more day feeling Steve's arms around him like this.
He never does tell anyone quite how acute his senses have become, after all being in close quarters with soldiers-they do things at night he figures are not polite to discuss in the light of day. The comfort from knowing his men are safe and healthy is still there though. He tucks that security behind his chest, holds it close to his own heart.
They dance until it becomes obvious that Tony is getting tired.  He goes off to change into pajamas while Steve waits. It gives him time to wander around the penthouse.  There are few personal touches; a watch left undisturbed on a sleek mirrored table, a pair of slippers left forgotten in the living room, but otherwise the space has been meticulously cleaned.  Steve wonders if Tony cleaned it himself to maintain his secrecy. It seems like something he would do. His inspection ends with the discovery of a long window seat built into the east facing wall of glass.  It’s topped with dark velvety cushions, and enough padding to resemble a mattress more than a couch. Looking at it, he can imagine Tony sitting here, and upon sitting down he catches a whiff of the spicy cologne he knows so well.
“Listen to your father.” Steve says, grinning when that draws a choked laugh from Tony.
“It's fine Happy, probably wouldn't have panned out anyway.” Steve squares his shoulders, and follows Tony's path; sliding into a booth with him to listen to the many and exciting different kinds of roasts, syrups, and styles of coffee the cafe offers. Steve himself likes the plain drip coffee, but after traveling around Europe for a while he learned a healthy appreciation for the little shots of espresso and the full bodied richness of a well made cappuccino. That and, anything that Tony enjoys this much is reason enough to pay attention.
“Oh, oh god, yes. He will love that for the sole reason that it's a
“Steve.” Tony whispers, eyes shut tightly, so Steve wraps them both in the blankets and tumbles Tony beneath him, putting himself between the world and the man he loves.
Steve holds him tighter, bunching his hands in the soft fabric of his expensive suit jacket. “You don't know that. You don't know what he is or isn't willing to do. You're asking me to be alright with the idea of losing you, with the idea of you getting hurt when I could prevent it.”
“Gee I don't know Tones, maybe it's because you've had a fucking crush on the guy since you were in training wheels-and maybe because he's so gone on you that I'm surprised he hasn't come down to serenade you yet.” He never should have shown Rhodey that picture of him in a Cap costume all those years ago.
“Do not. Do not angst about the bruises okay.” He says when he notices Steve staring down at the spot where bruises in the shape of his fingers must be slowly blooming now beneath tight black fabric.
“Yeah,” Steve groans, clutching at the covers and trying to stay still while Tony jerks his cock slowly, expertly to full hardness; not that he needs any help getting hard with Tony around, in the same room even. “f-for you, getting hard for you.”
“I want to see it, would love to see it. Probably won't understand much, but I can still appreciate what you've got cooking.” That earns him another brilliant smile, and Steve finds himself with a sudden armful of Tony Stark. He's warm in Steve's arms, and Steve pulls him close on the piano bench, hugs him tightly, strokes his fingers through the artful dishevelment of his hair. It feels good to hold Tony like this, to have the warmth of him so close, to feel the play of muscle beneath his hands-solid and real and wonderful. If he could paint a feeling it would be this. Joy and longing, warmth and touch. Something like ice melting. The first thaw of spring after a long and terrible winter.
“Well, we’ve confirmed he’s an asshole,” Steve said, and that was an understatement.
And then the rigger pulled out a cane.
“Make them slow.” Steve accepted Tony’s proposal, pulling down his zipper as a show of good faith and to give himself more room as he watched Tony slowly jerk his cock.
Tony saw the man’s eyes widen slightly, and he grinned, ready to continue his favourite rant but then the other guy shut down again.
into him by shoulder and hip. "Like that," he demanded as Tony groaned, gasping and stuttering before he found the rhythm, heavy and pounding, the movement grinding Steve’s tender back into the carpet. The sensations reverberated through him in a gloriously overwhelming feedback loop that washed over Steve and took him down.
“I’m here with my Sir,” Tony demurred, reaching out to draw Steve into the conversation. “Sir, this is Crossbones and his Asset.”
“All the people,” Steve murmured, not really being able to help himself. Tony didn’t miss a beat.
“I also get tied,” Tony added, because that usually made the insecure Doms less defensive when he was talking to ‘their’ partners. It was even half true. It worked this time too, the man’s demeanor shifted immediately from aggressive to interested.
Tony was moving even slower now, breath starting to stutter, just a little.
But before Steve could get too judgy, maybe the ignoring was part of the scene, the top stood up, kicked a small block of wood across the stage until it was under the bottom’s straining feet. It wasn’t big, and only a couple inches high, but it gave the man in rope the ability to take some of his own weight. Instantly the man’s head drooped in relief, then tilted back again as the muscles of his leg stood out in sharp definition. Steve suspected that knot near his throat meant that he could easily choke himself if he didn’t keep his posture.
him, hot and deep. He wanted to feel Tony's body pounding against his.
Tony let Steve manhandle him, but he pushed himself upright when Steve stopped moving, grinding their cocks together playfully. “What’s my reward?”
. “Good boy.”
himself,” Tony hissed. He knew Steve had seen as clearly as he had, would understand just as well as he did, but he couldn’t really get past that point. The dangerous looking rope could be put off to differing risk profiles, but after such a hard scene the untying was practically a reward. It was the point where he could enjoy the rope without having to constantly judge his safety levels, and melt into all the happy hazy brain chemicals of rope space. And maybe that was also negotiated, but Tony couldn’t imagine being left to just… manage himself. “And he calls him his Asset! That’s not a name, that’s barely even a noun!”
He got a blank stare and now that he was closer Tony had a better sense of just how massive the guy was. Tony felt fairly confident in his own body but they weren’t really in the same category. This guy was in Cap’s category and prior to this Tony had thought Steve was a category of his own.
Tony gave him a quick kiss then slipped off into the crowd. Steve would always have his back.
Tony glanced around, noticing the top at the bar, chatting and laughing with a crowd and that felt even worse. It wasn’t really his place to step in, but on the other hand, they were here to meet people. He nudged Steve, “Hey Cap, I’m gonna go make friends.”
Crouching, the rigger untied the rope from one foot and started brushing his hair back. The strain between the bottom’s eyes lessened at the soft touch, before returning with a vengeance as the rigger closed his fist, roughly tying the rope into his hair. Using that handle, he caught up the ankle again, and started slowly pulling the man’s foot towards his head. The bottom struggled to keep his balance as the curve being forced into his back changed his center of gravity. Steve could see the strain in his neck now carrying the weight of a leg, could see the toes on the block go up a little higher as his hips shifted back. When he’d hit the limits of flexibility, the rigger tied off the line.
“Done.” Steve smiled. “Love you.”
He could hear Tony behind him, his soft even breaths and the gentle slaps of the flogger's falls against themselves as Tony reacquainted himself with the weight and swing of the heavy leather toy Steve preferred. If he turned around, Steve knew what he’d see, those clever eyes, that focus, lit by the arc reactor, even in the relative brightness of the room. Steve
Tony started to move away when he was interrupted by a low wry voice. “All we do is hang there and look pretty.”
“Good,” Steve said, and he heard Tony’s pleased little hum in response. “More.”
Steve reached up to get a better hold on the rope grips above his head and let his shoulders soften as his forearms flexed. The St. Andrew’s Cross’ brackets were reinforced, but today it was just something to do with his hands. He wasn’t going to be struggling.
As Steve’s body woke up, he let his head drop forward into the cool wood of the cross, arching his back into the strokes, pushing for more. Tony responded to his silent demand by speeding up, and the heat started to turn to a burn as the tips of the tails flicked across his skin.
“I mean, more muscular people?” He backtracked. “Uhh not women? Um no. I’m just gonna stop now.”
Steve surfaced as Tony flagged, the heavy thundering beats lessening into a gentle rain. Steve took a deep, cleansing breath as he forced his hands to relax on the ropes. He felt amazing, so bright, alive, and awake. And as his pain subsided, arousal took its place, roiling up inside of him and breaking out across his skin until he couldn’t wait any longer.
“God damnit, DUM-E!” Tony yelled, sputtering, behind the foam blocking Steve’s view. “Why are you even here?”
“Yeah, go.” Steve waved him off. “But I’ll take one steamy photo as payment for my shorts.”
him. He wanted him like he hadn’t known was possible before they started these games.
. He offered his breath, his strength, and his effort, letting Steve consume him. And, oh how Steve
Tony grinned, looking suddenly hopeful, “Video for video?”
“Deserves better,” Steve muttered as Tony turned away from the railing and pulled Steve away to explore the rest of the club.
Steve counted for him, because he could be helpful like that and not because it made Tony drop his head back and groan. The workshop was dark behind him, but there and the smudge of something along his jaw; he must have been working before his call. He liked seeing Tony like this, lax and casual. He looked like home.
“Enjoy your night,” Crossbones said abruptly, apparently no longer interested now that he wasn’t going to get any fresh meat. Tony let Steve pull him away.
, the impact reverberating through his torso, and it knocked a groan out of him, echoing Tony’s grunt of exertion.
“Right.” Tony started the car. “So we’re going to continue to go to that weird shitty club and continue to demonstrate to a certain person-”
“We should play tonight.” Guess the lack of an opening didn’t matter. Crossbones’ offer sounded more like a statement than a request, and Tony did not want to play tonight or any night. Tony glanced around and Steve materialized out of the crowd, eyes flat and shoulders set firm. He must have been listening.
“Sure,” Steve said, grinning as Tony took a breath to settle himself.
The first strike hit the inner thigh of the bottom’s supporting leg. He immediately lost his balance on the tiny block. His bound leg jerked, instinctively trying to close to protect himself, yanking at his head in a way that looked incredibly painful. He barely had time to recover before the next strike hit.
“I always have ideas, you know that. You up for being tied?”
Tony was harder than he should be, really, given he’d only managed to get Steve out of his button down and undershirt. The game ended with Tony’s orgasm, and his request for Steve to suck his own fingers had been a tactical error on Tony’s part. He’d offered to play with his nipples in exchange, and Steve knew he’d hoped that would be a break, but Tony had apparently forgotten just how much he liked to watch Steve—and what Steve could do with his tongue.
“Hey,” Steve said, sharp, and Tony reluctantly stilled the roll of his hips and looked up at Steve with dark eyes, chest heaving against Steve’s. Nothing but skin and sweat and lust between them. “You want your reward?”
And Steve could have him.
Okay, that was a thing that Tony wasn’t going to let sit as is. Rope bottoming was a skill, damnit. “Yeah, no. We don’t just hang there. There’s like 10,000 things we do to keep ourselves safe, keep the scene good, and make the tops look good. Tops are nothing without us.”
The video suddenly went white. Steve blinked.
He whirled, saw the brief moment of shock in Tony’s eyes before Steve jerked the flogger out of his hands and took them both to the ground. Tony squirmed under him, laughing and instinctively trying to break free, but all Steve had to do was shove a thigh between Tony’s legs to change Tony’s goal from freedom to a different kind of release.
Crossbones took that exactly as Tony expected: irritated, but conceding to Steve’s authority. Tony, like Steve, could play with whoever he wanted as long as he was available for any scenes they had planned together. But they both knew that there were some people who didn’t like being told no, so if either of them ever asked permission, the answer was going to be no. It was often smoother than getting into the fight.
There were actually two men on the stage. The person doing the tying was all in black with a white X slashed across his T-shirt, but it was the person being suspended who had caught Steve’s attention.
“Crossbones doesn’t deserve anyone.” Steve let his head fall back against the headrest. He still felt pleasantly hazy from the rope, but that was tinged with the memory of sad eyes watching him every time he looked up.
“I was just complimenting the scene.” Tony stepped to the side, shifting smoothly away from the voice but keeping both men in sight. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Steve starting to edge a bit closer.
“Sure, let me know when you’re ready, or if you’d rather tie tonight,” Steve agreed easily, heading towards the bar to pick up some soft drinks. There was a second floor balcony that overlooked most of the downstairs play space and that looked like the best place to linger while they got a feel for the space. Steve tried to look innocent as he waved Tony up the stairs ahead of him, but accepted the eye-roll and casual smack he got on the shoulder as a reasonable cost for the view.
Tony smoothed out the last ounce of tension between Steve’s eyebrows with the short piece of rope he was using as added texture to his touch. Steve was mostly in his lap, a slack pile of smooth skin and red rope in the cozy nook of what Tony guessed used to be restaurant booths before the space became a BDSM club. It was awfully nice not to have to defend his space, or worry about getting stepped on when doing floor rope. He could just focus on Steve and on finding new ways to make him make those little happy sighs. Tony looked up to see Asset staring at them with a mix of envy and longing. Tony met his eyes with a smile.
“Yes, Steve,
Warnings in this chapter for-Some suicidal ideation on Tony’s part, religious imagery, angst, and of course a lot of discussion of drowning.
“What is it, the metal thing, all those machines?”  Steve asked, half pleased the question had come out far steadier than he felt.
“I'll be
“Well.”  Tony says softly, almost somberly.  “Whatever makes you happy, mio caro cuore.”
work.”
“Not for me it's not, you don't walk into danger for me.” Tony's eyes are wide, there's an echo there of something else, in the way Tony is standing, in the fine tremors coursing through his body as he stands firm against all their concern.
“I hear you crunching back there, you’re not as sneaky as you think you are,” Tony says, wiping his eyes and shooting him an amused glance.  Steve stills with a fork halfway to his mouth. Caught red handed.
“He's fine.” Pepper mutters, shaking her head in fond exasperation. Tony beams at her; even without his memories, he just
“I love you too you know, since, god-forever.” Steve has a moment to panic over the shine of emotion in Tony's eyes, and then he's being hugged fiercely, Tony kissing him as if he could never get enough. He answers those kisses eagerly, clasping Tony tightly against his body, and murmuring affirmations against Tony's lips as he breaks the kiss to take deep shuddering breaths.
After Stark leaves Steve sits on his bed heavily. The room is bigger than anything he's ever had. Bigger than his apartment in Brooklyn. He almost wants to call mister Stark back and ask him if there are any smaller rooms in the mansion-this just feels excessive.
“Do I have to say?”
Missions went bad sometimes, he knew that just as well as anyone, but it was different now somehow.  This team, they were fast becoming his family, he couldn’t bear the thought of anything happening to any of them.  He was already cut off from his own time, trying to find his way in a world that saw him more as an icon than a man.  There were statues of him around the country,
“Goodnight Tony, I'll see you tomorrow.”
“Yeah, he was that, but I didn't see it until it was too late. What can I say, I'm a shit judge of character.” Tony grits out darkly, staring into his glass, seemingly watching the ice melt.
“Yeah you're my partner. You call me Winghead, remember.” Captain America impersonator is looking increasingly concerned.
“Nah.” He murmurs, reaching out to brush dark hair away from covering Tony's eyes.  “Just think you'd look better in red.” He pauses, eyes sliding over Tony's body thoughtfully. “Or maybe blue. Always thought you'd look pretty in blue.” Tony chokes, shoulders shaking with laughter. Steve sighs, he wonders if stripping naked and showing up on Tony's bed would work. Nothing else seems to be doing the trick.
“What-” Steve croaks, finally finding his voice. Widow glances at him sharply, and spits something at Barton in Russian.  “It's...that's
“C'mon, I'm collecting on that promise.” Steve says, smiling at him warmly as if he wasn't just shaking a man like a pair of maracas.
He lectures himself sternly. Weird, his self lecturer voice sounds a lot like Rhodey. Still he supposes a few lascivious thoughts aren't
They don't leave the car for another thirty minutes, when they finally do stumble out, clothes askew and looking rumpled, Clint is laying across the Ferrari on the other side of the garage with his back to them, eating what looks to be an entire box of ring dings.
Red. Red and gold in front of him. Gleaming like a diamond cut ruby. Iron Man catches both sides of the bus hard-Turning the momentum into a spin around Steve worthy of a dancer. Sparks shoot up off the pavement when the broken edges of the bus hit the ground, but the people inside are still screaming. Steve has a moment to feel the gut clenching feeling of relief. Screaming people are living people after all.
“Cap, Cap what happened?” He can feel Iron Man patting him over but his head is still spinning, still he gathers himself together.
“Justin Hammer.” Natasha agrees, sitting back in her chair with all the satisfaction of a hunter having found her prey.
Blue holo-screens dance around the room, casting the whole space in an almost underwater light. In the center of it all, Tony stands with his back to the door. What is he
“Kiss.” Tony licks his dry lips, blinking up at Steve's face. “Can I get one Captain Handsome?”
“Of course, Iron Man will be with you at S.I. Right? If not I have something I wanna ask him.”
On Monday Steve goes to see the the psychologist Tony suggested.  She is not anything like what he expected. The last time Steve read up on psychology it wasn't nearly as good. For one thing, Freud's principles don't seem nearly as popular as they used to be.  He's immeasurably thankful for that.  Doctor Acharya is warm, welcoming, and even if she doesn't quite understand everything he's telling her, because there's no frame of reference for what Steve has lost; she tries. It's nice to just speak what's on his mind. It's still incredibly difficult. Old habits die hard, and Steve grew up being taught by society to bottle everything up except for his anger. He's trying though, and it's worth it when he talks to Tony over the phone, and Tony praises him for even making the attempt. Speaking to Tony is not the same as having him close by however.
Steve blinks his eyes open, unaware of when they closed.  He noses over Tony's throat, along the sharp line of his jaw, smiling against warm skin when Tony leans his head back and closes his eyes. Maybe it's strange to sleep next to the person you're sweet on like this before you've taken them out on the town, but he wants it with such powerful intensity that is almost leaves him shaking. Cold, it was so cold on the train, and no one
very, very on, that feels so good.” Tony all but moans. Steve wonders somewhat distantly if Tony is this vocal in bed, and then hastily pushes that thought aside. This is neither the time nor the place for those kind of thoughts.
into one.”
-----------------------------------------------------
For a moment Steve stares down at him uncomprehendingly. His chest is heaving, a tiny bead of sweat making a glittering trail down his forehead.
“JARVIS, how long has Kat been unconscious?” Tony’s voice shook.
"The picture I drew for Peter and Gwen," Kat answered.
“You’re a genius, Daddy. You’re quite possibly the smartest man on the planet! I had a hard time passing high school.”
Kat sucked in a breath. The God of Mischief and Magic just chuckled lowly.
The smile faded from Tony's lips and Steve almost wished he'd been more sensitive. But Tony didn't snap back at him. He Just leaned forward a little.
The hallway exploded. He saw red, and then black.
Kat smiled at Peter, “I appreciate your concern, Pete. But I wouldn’t be doing this if I wasn’t certain. I would rather be helping and adding to our chances than sitting at home or in a safehouse hoping that everything turned out okay. I can defend myself, and when I have a full grip on my suit I’ll be fine.”
No sooner had he said this than a strange voice came through the system.
He knew that Clint didn't want to leave him behind, but there was no sense in both of them being caught if they could still get information. Steve couldn't let any of his teammates be found, but he wasn't afraid of getting caught. If anything happened, it was what he deserved.
Kat gagged at the thought. “When will all the affects come into play?”
“Impressive, Miss Stark-Rogers. I had no idea Stark could be such a good teacher.”
Tony and Kat were able to get two loads up before Steve and Peter finally pulled into the Tower’s garage. They helped load and unload elevator-fulls of boxes, and the job was done faster. Once they had finished getting the boxes to the right rooms, they started to unload the boxes. Steve helped Kat set up her room and Tony helped Peter set up his. It took the whole afternoon, but everything was in its place by seven o’clock.
Maybe he was still a little in disbelief that Tony actually hadn’t run away again. He was
“So did I.”
Kat rolled her eyes, “Come down, I need you.”
It didn’t matter. He wasn’t going to the break room during class hours. Lunch was still in his bag, so he would just have that and power through the afternoon. It almost worked, too. The problem was, he really needed his thermos, and he still couldn’t find it. The kids were adamant that he should look in the break room. It didn’t matter that he hadn’t been there all day, or that they swore they hadn’t touched it; it had to be there.
“I wasn’t-”
On days when Peter was not busy and Kat had very little homework, they would watch a movie together and Kat would stay up a bit longer than usual. Tony and Steve would join on days that they didn’t work late and hadn’t worked too hard during the day. But any of these days were few and far in-between. And coming to the end of the school year, Kat needed one of those days.
"Tony, stop. I...." He sighed. "I think it should be me."
“Holy sh-.“
“Clint and Peter, I want you guys to start moving the civilians out of this area. I don’t know how far you can get everyone but hurry. If you get them out of the way come back and join us.
Kat was offended, “No! You two are so fun to be around and are definitely the sweetest couple I’ve ever met!”
Steve shook his head, still laughing.
Peter quickly shot out a web, attaching himself to the Tower. He swung across the street and fired another web to catch Kat as he went. As soon as he was attached to the Tower wall, he fired another web at Kat, reinforcing the first. He pulled her towards himself and scaled the Tower back down to the ground. He sat on the ground and held Kat in his arms. She was bloody from scrapes that covered her face, arms, legs, and even some of her chest and back. She was unconscious, but breathing. Peter felt like crying.
“I’m afraid you’re right,” Steve deadpanned back.
“Kat are you enjoying yourself?” Peter asked. “I mean; this is my comfort zone but if you’re not liking any of it then we cou-.”
“Natasha, I don’t know how you’ll want to do this but watch your back.
"I wouldn't send you an insecure phone if I didn't want to be caught!"
“Anything like you imagined?” Steve asked, taking off his sweater and fixing his leotard as Tony read the board.
“Language, Tony,” Steve reminded. “What is it?”
Kat smiled and mumbled something incoherent and fell back asleep.
“Would the Captain and Stark please come join me on the top of their Tower. I believe I have found something of theirs.”
“Don’t stop stretching those legs!”
Kat shrugged, “Well, no. I always pictured a mother and father. But since you and Steve are my new parents I don’t think I’ll have a problem.”
“Stark, she has learned well from you.” Tony nodded his thanks. “Have fun.”
“Don’t stop stretching those legs!” he reminded, and then held the pose for a moment before bringing his leg back down. He stood carefully, and turned off the camera.
Peter shrugged, “Well, it’s not like we’re able to bring ourselves. I suppose the real question, though, is why didn’t we come here sooner?”
Unfortunately, Tony’s hand was forced.
Steve scoffed, “Probably just working in his lab. He hasn’t had to do too much work since he made Pepper his CEO. I’m sure Peter will join him.”
"Getting breakfast."
Steve, for his part, couldn’t hold back a grin, and saluted him back. “Alright. Just give me another second to cool down a bit.” His eyes flicked down, even though he couldn’t actually see the front of Tony’s slacks. “You, too.”
Kat let her mask up and grinned at the Avengers, “So, how bad was it?”
“I am not impressed,” Fury repeated. “I am blown away.” Tony and the other Avengers stood up at this.
, this has nothing to do with anything. I just have a lot to work on, so I’m buckling down and getting my work done in here, okay? I brought my own coffee so I don’t need to leave for anything.”
sick of him calling me in the middle of the night to wail in my ear like a lovesick tween.”
“You're gorgeous.” Steve whispers into his ear when he pulls back from the kiss and untangles Tony's arms from around his neck. Both of them are breathing a little heavier, but thankfully Happy doesn't comment.
“How did you-” He starts.  JARVIS clears his throat, sounding almost affronted when he answers.
At first there is nothing but darkness, but, Steve does not die; trapped in the ice, he dreams. He dreams of a world passing him by, he dreams of his mother teaching him to dance in the low flickering oily lighting of their lower east side apartment. He remembers their half torn lace curtains fluttering in the evening breeze even now. The tinny strains of music floating around the room as she tried to teach him how to spin his dance partner. Those are good dreams, but most often he dreams of snow, and frost, of seeing his breath leave ice crystals suspended in the air. He dreams of harsh winters, curled in his bed shaking, he dreams of starting a fire for his half-frozen men far behind enemy lines. The cold has always been a cruel thing, fingers like knives beneath a threadbare shirt. Here, floating in the dark it only seems crueler, when his awareness surfaces enough for him to feel it.
“Nah that would be me.” Steve says, leaning down to kiss Tony some more because he gets to, and he wants to.
“Got it in one Captain Handsome. You said you liked to watch me work didn't you?”
He’d been catching up on history, and boy did he not like what he read.  Installing governments, causing unrest and the collapse of infrastructure, every oil reserve was its own thirty pieces of silver.  Steve had thrown the book at the wall the first time he’d read about Japan.  He hadn’t slept right for the rest of the week.  What had they
He's cool, he's
Tony blinks, then blinks again when Steve slides down to lay atop him, a soft little sound of surprise escaping his lips when it brings their hips into contact.  “Oh, oh I thought...I thought you were just-” He breaks off clutching Steve close by the shoulders, and throwing one leg around his hip when Steve nuzzles his chin and kisses over the prominent arch of his cheekbone.
The art in this chapter was created by the amazing
“Then why me?”  Steve repeated, not understanding how this made him a good candidate in the slightest.
“I get the feeling he's not going to tell me is he?” He concedes.  JARVIS hums in agreement, opening the door for him when he heads back out into the hall. JARVIS continues to speak to him in the hallway. Steve sometimes feels like he's talking to a ghost, JARVIS' voice follows him just as surely as an invisible man keeping step at his side.
“You're welcome, I'm glad.  That you liked it, I must get you accustomed to the good life somehow, mio caro.”  Tony says, smiling crookedly, fiddling with his fork atop his empty plate, then setting it down with a clink.
“Thanks Thor, I appreciate the um. Sentiment.”
“No, they would not have, you just said so yourself, and that is why you are special, Mister Rogers.”  The words startled Steve back another two steps, he didn’t know whether he should have been getting ready to fight, or anything really.  It was so strange, so surreal, as if Steve were standing in the middle of one of Salvador Dali’s paintings watching the walls warp, and clocks melt.
The walk to their rooms is quiet, Steve drifting into Tony's orbit to wrap an arm around his waist. Progress is slow that way, but it means Tony can rest his head on Steve's shoulder. Steve counts that as a resounding win. When they make it to Tony's door it opens, lights drawing up to a dim candlelit tone in anticipation of Tony's presence.
“I love you Steve.” There, it's out there in the open, he's said it before his nerve can pack up and run away.
. Tony settles on grabbing a discarded band t-shirt off the bed and tugging it over his head instead. Steve averts his eyes, cheeks pinking. Huh. So, scars and crop tops are definitely not a turn off then.
“Touch me however you like, m'all yours.” Tony whispers, and Steve leans over him, curving a hand around his neck to tip his head back. Brown eyes blink open hazily, only to close again when Steve moves in, twisting over him to take his mouth in a slow, languid kiss that makes his nerves buzz with awareness.
“Tony, you don’t have to do all that fella,”  He started.
“I love you Rhodey.” He announces, pushing up the arm rests between their seats so he can lean on his clear favorite in the room-car. Rhodey laughs, letting him get comfortable. Tony might be imagining things, but Steve looks just a little jealous. Bucky just looks amused.
It's kind of flattering to think Thor might have had a little crush though. What an ego boost. Thor seems to know what he's thinking, he shoots Tony a little wink before going off to make himself comfortable next to Jan.
Then there was Thor.  Tall, built like a mountain, with a voice that could shake the heavens, and a smile that could light up a room.  It had been no shock to find out the man was a prince, maybe a bit of one to learn he was an alien, but Steve just took it in stride, he’d worked with aliens before.  He was neither an alpha, a beta, nor an omega, but he found it all quite fascinating.  He asked Steve some rather pointed questions while sipping a sweet smelling coffee in a tall paper cup, and then royally proclaimed he wished to spar with the team.  All present had gone down to the training room and engaged in a wild sparring session that left most of them panting on the floor.  It felt good, it felt like living.
After everything was cleared, Iron Man informed them he had to get back to the manufacturing facility he had been at for the last two weeks, explaining he was overseeing the installation of new safety devices.  He was apologetic about it, but Steve just clapped him on the shoulder and asked him to come back soon.
“We're here to offer assistance, if you need it.” Carol says, smiling at Tony when he gapes at her wordlessly.
Tony's room is both what he expected and not. Technology is everywhere. Much like the ever present humming coming from Tony's chest, the whole room is filled with interesting things that Steve can't even begin to figure out the use of. The furniture does not seem like something tony would pick out however. The headboard is a huge carved panel of wood. Two nightstands sit off to the sides. Steve expected more minimalist furnishings, but he supposes Tony could not have designed all the spaces in the house.
about everyone in the house, and Steve is more grateful for that than he can put into words.
“Alright, fine, buttercup. We'll shelve this discussion for later, when I can bring facts and photographic evidence.” Tony concedes, and Steve finally gathers enough motivation to open his eyes. Tony is leaning over him, his eyes wide and full of emotion, his hair is a riot of disheveled curls, color is riding high on his cheeks, and his red, red robe is all but a heap around him.
“Uh huh.”
“I'm being
kind of banana. You're going to go jog right? It's too early for you to get in bed with me.” Oh how he wishes that were not the case. Steve has better things to do than cuddle him while he sleeps. He's too tired to offer anything enticing right now as it is, and Steve obviously has his plan. “Mister Nanners, Capnana, he's soft and he makes a good pillow.” That and it always makes him think of Steve, but he's not going to say that. He's being ridiculous enough as it is. A wide smile is pulling across Steve's face though, as if there's nothing better than the idea of Tony wanting his silly plush.
“What, seriously, I mean I thought the two of you might have something going on-” Tony's words cut off when he finds himself on the receiving end of a glare that all but screams for him to shut up. Given that it's Natasha glaring he wisely chooses to snap his mouth closed and slurp at his glass instead. Steve is staring too though, one of his hands dropping to pat Tony's thigh companionably.
“Tony is a complicated guy. I've known him for years, and even then he still throws me for a loop sometimes.” Rhodes grabs a beanbag from a giant pile of them in a recessed portion of the floor. Steve would be more interested in this heretofore unknown room, but he's a little busy having a crisis at the moment.
“Tony is a good guy, he'll want you to be where the team is, and you don't already have a house right?” She asks curiously.  Steve thinks back on his tiny apartment with it's drafty halls and creaky floors.  It probably doesn't even exist anymore.
What better place for Zemo to indulge in his disgusting delusions of grandeur than a place like Mamula, where so much suffering and evil had once been allowed to run rampant. Steve murmured a prayer for the dead under his breath as he set about scaling the first outer wall. Rut, and the anger he felt over the symbolic place Zemo chose for his base spurred him on, his fingers leaving dents in the aging masonry. If he could have, he would have torn the whole place down right then, brick by brick, the way he’d wanted to during the war if he’d even had half a chance.
“I don't think you are Steve.” The words should hurt, but Tony says them so gently, with so much concern that Steve's throat clicks on a swallow.
“Crystal clear, darling, don't worry; that wasn't what I had in mind as it was.” Tony says almost softly, climbing into the backseat beside Steve. The ride doesn't take very long, but Tony wastes no time getting right up in his space, laying his head on his shoulder and stroking over Steve's arm and side. It makes something knot up in Steve's stomach, a lump in his throat when Tony leaves a gentle kiss against the clenched hinge of his jaw.

And as ever come lurk on my
“You know I like everything we've been doing.”  Steve says, breathlessly, already feeling his body react just with Tony's words.  “I don't need that, I-I don't mind being on bottom. Hell I, I really love it.” It had been a surprise just how much, how good it felt the first time.  Tony had been so patient too, so sweet and careful that it had left Steve gasping and overwhelmed with some emotion he couldn't name. Sure he's wondered what it would be like to have Tony that way too, but he's well aware he's well, probably too big too feel good for Tony, and he has never offered before.  Still, he remembers a few weeks ago, Tony getting him off between his thighs. Good God that had been something.
Steve doesn't dignify that with an answer, choosing instead to tug a gobsmacked Tony after him and into the restaurant-where a perky woman with flaming red hair takes their orders. It becomes obvious after a few moments that they haven't been recognized. Tony sips his coffee and watches Steve across the table, fighting down a giggle when he feels Steve's ankle press against his beneath the table.
happening and you're stuck wondering if you took advantage of someone in the aftermath? No thank you.” Natasha says, crossing her arms with finality. Over from where he's standing by the wet bar Tony sees the look of incredulity on Steve's face shift into understanding.
He tried to sleep, but found he could not.  His mind was racing, and his body was not yet ready to rest.  He’d been asleep for decades, that made sense, and he was afraid, if he really examined the feeling.  He was afraid if he closed his eyes another seventy years would pass, and then where would he be?  Steve shivered, throwing off the blankets and getting out of bed.  There was nothing for it, he would have to tire himself out.  He put his boots back on, mentally apologizing for their less than optimal state.  He’d have to get some new ones, he felt like a little kid tracking mud across a fine Persian rug at this rate.
“I won't.” Steve lies. He will.
“Ah but I have given you your fondest wish.” His smile is sharp, too sharp, glittering, and white, and knowing. Armored scales hiss over the sand as the man crouches down so they are at eye-level with each other. “You have always wanted to be someone else, haven't you? Now is your chance, you are welcome.” Tony wants to say that no, that's not true, but he can't remember, can't see. His chest hurts, it hurts to breathe, it hurts to
“S'nice.” Tony murmurs when Steve starts on his other hand, dropping his head down onto one of Steve's broad shoulders.
Steve shivered, wrapping his arms around himself, thinking about the things his classmates said.  About how warm other people were, how good it felt to just hold another person.  Steve had heard too, about what it was like to be touched by an omega.  The way it made people feel the best they had ever felt, how during the great war special omegas worked with battle-fatigued alphas and betas coming back from deployment.  Sat in the barbershop getting his hair trimmed, he listened to an older alpha with a chest full of medals talk about his omega and beta partners, and how they made coming home worthwhile, how they drove the cold away.  He had wanted to speak up, to ask questions, but he knew what he looked like.  He didn’t look like he had any business, or any chance at living a life like that, but by God he wanted it, or something like it.
This chapter is the reason this fic is rated M, because I just wanted to be safe.
“You know,” Tony began, voice soft as he pet Steve’s hair, “I could probably rig up something for you for your music. If you let me hook up a computer to your camera, we could work out some timing software to get your music to start when you want it to. Unless your box is older than it looks. Then I’d have to get a couple adapters and-”
Steve stood up, ready to defend Kat. Fury put up a hand to silence anything the blonde might have said.
“It’s summer, I’ll eat what I want. I no longer have anyone to impress.”
Steve led Kat to the den. There, they turned on NCIS and watched an episode from the first season. But neither of them was paying close attention. Both were worried about what could have happened to Peter. As they were about ready to start the next episode, JARVIS came up and told them that Tony wanted them down in the lab. They hurried down the hallways and made it to the lab door. Steve knocked and the door opened almost immediately. Steve and Kat ran inside.
Steve carefully got to his feet and made sure his player was off. His own body was beginning to respond, though he stayed a careful distance away from Tony. He smiled more shyly and folded his hands in front of himself.
“All of it. Twice. You read it all the time!”
“Come finish the movie with us and finish the study guide tomorrow?” Tony suggested.
“Drawing it.”
He said “maybe” like it wasn’t really an option. The instruction set Steve’s belly on fire. Tony’s fingers hooked in Steve’s tights and his dancer’s belt, sliding them down his legs, torturously slowly. He inched them down, pressing kisses down the inside of Steve’s thighs, all the way down and making the heat in his belly burn hotter until he was sure he’d burst. He gasped as they finally slipped off, Tony pressing a kiss to his ankle and sending a tickle up Steve’s leg. Tony laughed when Steve’s foot twitched, and then kissed him there again before slowly mouthing his way back up Steve’s legs to his hip. Tony hooked his hands under Steve’s thighs and pressed his legs further apart, holding him open.
“It’s still open and there are still doctors inside,” Clint confirmed.

“No. Maybe their parents just don’t want them writing? Want them to be part of their new family not their old one? The past can be hard to let go of.”
Tony agreed, and then looked over at Steve confused, “How did you do it before?”
Kat looked at her screens. Indeed, her parents and Natasha were gathering up the unconscious Asgardians while Thor spoke with the conscious ones.

They ate and talked some more before heading home. Tony drove while Steve and the twins started singing whatever song Steve had decided to teach them from the 40’s. Something by Duke Ellington about not meaning something, and swing. He wasn’t really paying attention; it didn’t really matter to him. He probably should look more into the music Steve was familiar with, but right now the song seemed incredibly annoying. Like something that got on everyone’s nerves after a while.
“No, Pop. We’re not going to play the blame game. It’s not your fault.”
“Papa?”
“Barton!”
“You gotta drop the sweet guy routine and just be direct,” Bucky huffed, shoving Steve’s shoulder. “You think I managed to land Sam by sitting back and telling him I knew where we could get really good coffee?”
Steve chuckled, “I guess we assumed you’d already been here. But this is a nice homecoming, ay?”
“And why do you care so much about my coffee habits, huh? Kinda cu-, um, creepy, Rogers.” Tony was starting to blush, but it didn’t seem like it was from anger… “No one makes coffee as good as me anyways. I’ve never seen you make coffee, either, I don’t trust it. Bye, have a nice day.”
“Try climbing up a wall!” Kat suggested.
Steve sighed and then chuckled, “Not right now. We don’t know if the effects are temporary. Give it a few years, then we’ll see. Okay?”
Kat smiled, “Yes. It’ll be nice to have two months to adjust to a new home.”
“Not in the break room? Where then?” Doreen said, cheekily.
Despite all they'd been through, he couldn't deny that, well, he still cared about Steve. And hearing that Steve was being so reckless... it was a little frightening.
“Playing dirty, I see,” Tony muttered, turning his focus down to the camera as he fidgeted with the buttons.
“I saw that I had another couple to do,” Kat replied, grabbing for the book and paper.

"And in another month you'll be back in the hospital."
, Steve,” Tony huffed, his bravado failing as his hands flew up to his face, covering his cheeks and fidgeting with his glasses.
And making Tony totally incapable of looking him in the eye at work ever again. Hence, checking to make sure he hadn’t walked into the breakroom yet, leaving time for Tony to make a quick escape once the coffee was done. The coffee machine was still percolating. He scratched anxiously at his goatee, unable to focus on Harley’s equations. After several attempts to focus on the page, Tony stuffed it back into his paper holder and huffed. He stared at the coffee maker and willed it to go faster. Tony glanced up as the door opened again, and quickly forced his gaze to stay on the coffee as Steve walked in. Hurry the fuck up, Tony willed the coffee pot. As soon as it spat the last few drops, Tony filled his mug and replaced the pot, quickly turning to leave and rush to his office.
"But we were going to have a family night tonight!"
He was wearing the tights.
“That’s not healthy, you know.”
All things considered, I'm pretty happy with how this turned out, because I don't write smut, but I think chapter turned out pretty good anyways.
Tony put the pot back and took long strides towards the door, hoping to keep his rising blush hidden.
“She picked up that cello and we could hardly get her off of it. She’s amazing for an eighth grader!”
‘Tony, what the hell are you doing?’ Steve thought.
Kat laughed, “No. I’m just excited to finally have a home and a family.”
him.” Keep up on his aerobics videos, maybe, but not stalk. “I just think he’s adorable and his videos are adorable and his outfit is honestly really-”
He hadn’t really tried to make it better, either, unfortunately. Rhodey told him he ought to, and he knew that. But the thought of looking Steve in the eye after an incident like that made him feel ashamed all over again. He just couldn’t do it. So, thermoses it was. He tried his best to be quick in the halls and stay in his office and classrooms only. Once or twice this week he’d almost been caught by Steve, but he managed to get away. Hopefully he could just hold out until after finals, and then let things calm down over the break.
Kat felt safe. She had three men who loved her, and she loved them back. She knew that they would protect her at all cost and without regard for themselves. Okay, maybe the last part unsettled her a bit. But she hoped that they would let her prove herself when they had their next fight. She was a big girl; she could handle herself. And she wanted to show that she could keep her promise. She would keep herself as safe as she could.
Steve Rogers had joined the Borough of Manhattan Community College’s wellness department at the beginning of the year, which Tony would have never known, except he kept bumping into him in the break room. The school was big enough, he figured they probably shouldn’t be seeing each other as much as they did, but it was fine. It was fine. Tony’s freshman class assured him that Mr. Rogers was a nice guy; that he made their wellness requirement fun and engaging; that he was really nice and didn’t push anyone too hard in the physical activity portion of the class.  According to Riri and Doreen, he was also cutely oblivious to how often his students checked him out in his workout gear.
“You said you were just doing two of them.”
“But what if you don’t have a full grip on your suit the next time we have to fight?”
Ever since her breakdown the week before, Kat had started calling Steve and Tony “Papa” and “Daddy”. They had smiled each time, pleased with the childlike intimacy of the monikers.
Tony was angry. How dare this person touch his little girl. It was outrageous. Not only that, but he’d drawn her blood, which made his own boil. Steve was not faring much better. The fear still froze his chest, but everything else was burning. Burning with intense hatred. He felt as though he might burst into flames at any moment. Both of them nearly lost it when Loki’s hand tightened around Kat’s throat. The blood flow to her head was slowed by the god’s large hand. She felt the pressure in her face, and her parents watched it turn red.
He found himself grinning as he left and closed the door behind himself. He walked through the halls, silently promising Steve that the next time he came back, it would be to bring them home.
They all had bright colors that matched his tights. Steve ordered them specially for this purpose. Finally, he settled on a skin-tight, bright aqua top with a light magenta star, and the matching magenta sweatband. He wondered if people would leave comments about him wearing too much “pink”, but he didn’t mind. He thought it was fun.
“Hey! What about me?” Peter called from the hallway.
End of Chapter Two
“But you’re you, Sammy, I knew it would work. It ain’t gonna work on this Tony Stark guy.”
“Same with you and your guitar!”
Loki grinned, like the Cheshire cat.
Steve smiled, “Can I see?”
“It happens sometimes.”
“Oh my God,” Kat whispered. Tony Stark and Steve Rogers were standing right in front of her.
“How does that work out?”
Kat didn’t look up, giving Fury the chance to speak.
But lately, even when Steve kept trying to ask Tony out, for just a cup of coffee, Tony would rush out of the room, avoiding Steve completely. It happened again today, Tony giving some excuse about having class and then rushing off. It was like he hadn’t even heard Steve.
“Kat didn’t take her jeans off.”
So far, so good. The hall was empty and quiet. Tony hurried down to the break room, listening outside for a moment before opening the door. Silence had to be good, right?
End of Chapter Four
Tony glanced at the clock, sighing as he realized they were late, “Maybe I was talking to you and Parker, Keener, if you both don’t start taking your attendance seriously.”
“I’m not going to be allowed to join the Avengers am I?”
“Then just try to stay in one piece. I can’t lose you and Peter, baby doll.”
“Are you sure you want to do this?” Peter asked.
Not all of his paintings were especially good, and he often painted over them. But it was a good way to distract him and keep him offline during the weekends after he posted a new video. Steve learned quickly that waiting for views and likes made him anxious. He preferred to wait until Sunday evening to log back on and check the stats. Painting had been more important lately, he thought, because his numbers had been rising. If he were to watch, he might worry about reaching a certain number, and that wasn’t healthy either.
“Adopting us. Bringing us home. Making us part of your family.” Kat’s eyes drooped closed.
“Okay, sweetheart,” Tony purred, leaning down to kiss Steve again as he finally let their hips roll together.
“Shit.” Tony turned to Clint. “Is the hospital still open? It wasn’t within the evacuation radius?”
Tony landed with Steve. He’d seen Peter catch Kat and flown back up to get Steve. The two knelt in front of their children. Tony looked Kat over and something suddenly hit him. Kat shouldn’t have been out this long if all she had passed out from was loss of blood flow to her head.
“I would never,” Steve replied, calmly beginning his cooldown stretches. “If I killed you, I couldn’t have any more fun with you, and what’s the point in that?”
Steve was skeptical, “Well, don’t push yourself.”
“I like this color on you,” Tony murmured, leaning forward to press kisses across Steve’s exposed collarbone. “It suits you.”
They kissed all the way down the hall, both of them trying to undo buttons on Tony’s shirt. It was nearly fully undone by the time they made it to the bedroom, and Tony kicked the door shut behind them. Steve broke away to pull off his leotard. Tony untucked and shucked his button-up, reaching out in time to stop Steve from taking off his crop top. His hands cupped Steve’s pecs through the tight material, making Steve shiver as his thumbs brushed over where Steve’s nipples were showing.
“Yes.”
"And what have you been doing this morning?"
“Oh. Um, I have to finish this study guide and one for English first.”
School sucked, in Kat’s opinion. Especially her senior year. She was still single, and she was lonely. Her brother had been allowed to join the Avengers that year after he graduated early – perks of being a genius, Kat guessed. Peter now spent a lot of time training and with Gwen. They really were a great couple, and he saw her less than he saw his family. But Kat still felt like they were growing more and more separate. And with all her tests coming up – all the stress it piled on – she hated feeling left out. A recent flux in interstellar activity had all the Avengers on high-alert. Both of her parents and all the other Avengers were working all the time.
"Nothing."
“What?”
Kat jumped up and hugged Steve around his shoulders, “Thank you, Pop!”
“First of all, it’s only been a week. Second of all, he’s not my man.” He saw both Doreen and Riri open their mouths to argue and barreled on, gesticulating. “
“It can’t take that long!” Tony exclaimed.
“We’re gonna be in the office a while, so…”
“But you didn’t notice! You’ve been so busy that you don’t have time for me anymore! Peter has been working and spending time with Gwen! I barely see any of you anymore! I can’t even go out there and help you! You would let me though! Would you? Am I less qualified? Aunt Nat helps me train, already! I certainly have no one else to be around! I have no friends at school because everyone thinks they can’t touch me because of my parents! Because of you!” Kat pointed an accusatory finger at the two men in front of her as tears streamed down her cheeks. “No one wants to study with me because they think I’m some kid-genius who will show them up! But I need just as much help as they do! I can’t spend extra time after school for help because I need to get home so you know where I am! And when I need help I can’t ask anyone because you’re all too busy! If I don’t get those study guides and the extra studying done, I
Steve changed into his costume, getting ready to film a new video for this week. He started with his dance belt, and then pulled on his tights, unashamed of his pride at how good his legs looked in them. Checking himself out in the mirror, in just the tights yet, he couldn’t help but laugh softly. They were ugly, but they had one of those fun, 80s-roller-rink-carpet patters on them, which always made him smile. The colors popped, and that was what he liked about them. He slid his leotard up to his hips, leaving it there as he pondered which crop top to wear this week.
That was a hard position, but amazing. Steve could feel his own breath coming shallower in sympathy as the man started to tire, started to struggle just a little. His shoulders and torso flexed to shift his weight around in what was just not enough rope to ever be comfortable. His hair fell away from his face, and Steve saw that what he’d thought was shadow was actually a black mask covering the lower half of his face. But now Steve could also see the strain and concentration in the tension around his eyes and he added that to the tension in his toes reaching for relief, the twitching in his fingers flexing and  rolling, and Steve suspected that this man was very close to the limits of his strength. Steve knew intimately how that rope, how that position, would make breathing a struggle and every moment an eternity.
“Begin.”
. It was so close.
“You have no idea how much I want your cock inside of me. The feel of you inside me, the heat, the friction...” Tony dragged out the word, voice rumbling low. “It sparks something, sets my skin on fire— Jesus, this is killing me.” Tony broke off laughing, palming at his cock, “I’m burning—”
“Ten,” Tony offered, sounding more confident than his trembling hands suggested. The last time they had played, Tony had worked Steve into a trembling mess, agreeing to whatever exchange Tony offered just for the chance to do the next thing. But this time, Steve was pretty sure he was going to get to see Tony come apart.
He was gorgeous. His long body hanging from a single suspension line, gleaming skin only interrupted by a brief pair of skintight black shorts, his straining toes just an inch from the relief of the ground. There were other ropes on his body, a hip harness, a thigh wrap, and cuffs dangling off his ankles, but they were just remnants of what had been done, nothing that would help him in what he was currently doing. The only thing left to hold his weight was the chest harness folding his arms behind his back. Two bands of rope crossed his chest and arms, a web over top of that made a little cross of a knot at the base of his throat, and a wrap of rope pulled tight around his lower ribs.
Tony looked glorious, cheeks flushed with tendrils of dark hair sticking to his sweat damp forehead. “Dirty talk.” The challenge in Tony’s voice didn’t go unnoticed.
“So did you want to play early or wait?” Steve offered, standing behind Tony as they scanned the space. There was a good crowd of people, which was a good sign. Clumps of people were scattered through the main space with a larger group at one end.
Tony couldn’t do it for long, but that was the point. Steve could be greedy here. He could want and want and want as if he could make up for the 70 years of deprivation. In return Tony
“I want your pants off next,” Tony said, eyes darkening in hunger on the screen as Steve toyed with the button on his jeans.
The first strokes just kissed Steve’s skin, and he sighed in satisfaction as the anticipation blossomed into actualization. The sensation wasn’t pain yet, only the heat of blood rushing to the skin. It was an offering he accepted, and they both fell into the moment together, breaths starting to sync to the rhythm of the strokes.
“Why are you talking to my Asset?” a voice came from over Tony’s shoulder
It was finished now, and as Tony walked into the main area he saw the bottom was sitting alone off to the side of the stage. The chest harness was a pile of neatly bundled rope beside him, and he was slowly picking the hip harness apart with trembling fingers. Tony frowned, he hadn’t seen half as much of the performance as Steve, but it didn’t seem fair that he was untying himself alone.
“Yeah.” The word came out on a breath, and Steve felt the last of the weirdness of the evening melt away. They had a plan. They could do something. “We’re gonna do that.”
“Oh do you?” He wasn’t subtle as he leered his way down Tony’s body before landing on his face again. “I’m Crossbones. And this is my Asset.” Crossbones snapped his fingers, pointing to the floor beside his feet. The man he called Asset crawled his way over.  “He’s shy.”
He could feel Steve’s pleased hum deep in his chest. “Are you having some ideas?”
And Steve felt the next one
“-and all the other people, that there are better options until they choose to leave of their own free will and leave Crossbones with nothing but his own hand to play with.”
“I’ll be right behind you.”
Well, there was a flicker of amusement there, so at least Tony had that. He decided to quit while he was ahead. “Anyways, I just wanted to say I know how hard that scene just now was, and it was impressive.”
“Fuck me.”
“You said you were burning, your skin was on fire—” Steve managed to get out between giggles.
Steve let the moment stretch, breathing in the leather scented air with anticipation thrumming through his system until his skin felt too tight and he couldn’t wait any longer.
Steve leaned back on his hotel room bed, flexing just enough to give Tony something nice to look at. He missed Tony, and these video calls were starting to get a little old, despite their games. He couldn’t wait to play them in person. “And what’ll you give for my pants?”
“Did you want to play tonight or do you just want to get out of here?” Steve’s voice drew his attention away, and Tony hesitated. He really wasn’t comfortable here, but he was incredibly curious about the Asset. He didn’t want to leave him.
“Crossbones doesn’t deserve him,” Tony said, the moment he closed the door to the car, giving them some level of privacy after the club.
“You are unfairly hot.” Tony groaned, whimpering through the last strokes. But, he got through them without coming, so Steve shimmied out of his pants. He made a show of adjusting himself through his underwear as he lounged back on the hotel bed before tugging at the waistband. “What are you gonna offer for these, now? ‘Cause I think they’re worth more than my pants. But, if I’m honest, I’m not sure you’re gonna make it.”
He could hear the effort now in the hissing exhalations of Tony’s breath before each strike.  He could smell Tony’s sweat, thick over the leather.
“Yeah,” Tony breathed. Steve didn’t know if Tony was aware of how he’d let his head tip back, baring his throat, but Steve wanted his mouth on it. He leaned forward to lick, bite, and make Tony squirm again before rolling them, dragging Tony with him until they were closer to the table with the supplies, and leaving Tony splayed out on top of him.
The man just finished with the last rope, as Tony started across the room, adding its careful coils to the pile beside him and then slumped. Tony hesitated, waiting to see if maybe this was the end of the scene, if his partner or anyone else was finally going to go over to him. But after a minute or two of the man staring vacantly into a crowd who was pointedly ignoring him, Tony decided he wasn’t going to get a better chance and made his approach.
“Harder,” he growled.
Tony started with gentle thrusts, a warming tease, but Steve wanted more. Wanted to feel Tony
“Yes, Sir,” Tony purred, eyes hot as he sat up. Steve wrapped a leg around Tony’s hips to keep him close and draped his other leg over a shoulder before lifting his hips impatiently as Tony fumbled with the lube. It didn’t take long; Steve was eager with his want, his body warm and ready from the flogging.
“Did you see flames? No! Community college is too good for you. I’m gonna give you to a daycare.”
“Million-dollar cock-blocker,” Tony muttered, glaring off screen. DUM-E must have looked sufficiently contrite, because Tony was fighting a smile when he looked back at Steve, shaking powder out of his hair. “I’m so sorry, Steve, but I’ve gotta go shower.”
Steve had to look away, fists clenching with the desire to intervene. He leaned into Tony where he was watching a flogging on the other end of the room. What was going on on the stage was… beyond his risk profile. Tony looked back at him, likely cued by Steve’s tension. Steve jerked his head towards the stage, “That top’s a jerk.”
in the shower then?” He can't say what he really means yet, it seems vulgar to talk about that kind of thing with Tony even now, with Tony having seen what seems like every inch of him.
. He thinks, even as it leaves him bleeding, he knows there is no way he will find a living man.
“Come and get it Shellhead.” Steve reaches out to draw him closer, cupping Tony's face between his palms and kissing his cheeks, the tip of his nose, and finally the almost dimples at the corner of Tony's lips. Tony doesn't move throughout the whole thing, his eyes go wide at first, but then drop shut, face flaming with an endearing flush. Tony's arms are loose at his sides, hands opening and closing as if he doesn't know what to do with them. Steve is suddenly uncomfortably aware of the fact that Doom is just behind them, staring at them both intently. He pulls back from Tony, slipping his hands away from his face and stepping back.
Tony had said, and Steve hadn't lasted long at all. Best of all Tony always seems delighted for Steve to mess him up a little; or a lot.
“Yes,” Tony says thickly “Oh yeah, that is mmm, you learn fast honey, so fast, what a good boy you are, what a good boy for me,” Tony pants out, letting go of his knee to reach down and squeeze his hand around Steve's wrist as if he's guiding him there. Steve can't help the way his body goes hot, molten, melts with those words. His cock is so hard, heavy and bobbing between his legs as he works Tony open further, he thinks maybe he could come just from this, with Tony around his fingers and his sweet words in his ears.
Steve was still staring at the catalog, calculating how many papers he’d have to deliver to get his ma’ those new curtains, when the door to the classroom swung open, and Russell Blanchard waltzed in.  Russel was often late, and Steve privately thought he relished it a little when Mrs.  Carmichael gave him a talking to, but something in his bearing had changed.  A pair of fine leather gloves were tucked into his back pocket.  There was something else too, a faint soapy, powdery scent that went sugary sweet at the end.
“God, Steve, that's amazing, I-
“Oh sure, here.” He passes over the piece of glass.  “Just hold your hand out like-yeah. Perfect. Jay run safemode.”  A little yellow light appears at the top of the glass, which Steve guesses must mean the mode is activated.  He hopes that means he can't mess anything important up.  “This is the coolest thing that's ever happened to me, I just want you to know, Captain America holding my tech, who'da thunk. Ten year old me never would have believed it.”  Stark sounds just a little bit giddy, but his face suddenly flushes dark, and he looks down and to the side.  It's kind of adorable.  Steve hums, rolling the light around in his hand.  "Sorry, probably not what you want to hear, considering-"  He says quietly, hushed, almost under his breath.
“Yeah, that's not even the most exciting part.” Tony says, all smugness and
“Tony, Tony can you hear me? What do you need? Iron Man, what's happening?”
“Uh. This is going to come as a shock to you but you've been...asleep for a long time Captain Rogers. We kept an eye on you while you took your little nap here. It's safe, we're on our way back to New York.” The robot's voice is much more human sounding than Steve expected, despite how metallic they sound.  Steve sets his cup down. If a robot can sound hesitant then this one does. Except. Steve tilts his head, listening hard, eyes widening when he realizes they're not a robot at all.
“Okay.”  He said, his throat suddenly tight, though he didn’t know why.  He wanted something warm, he felt jittery and tired all at once.  It was a strange feeling, not unlike that awful shaky feeling he got after his breathing treatments after a particularly bad asthma attack
“Ah yes, this is in fact, about that, or it will be, after a time, provided I have not been mistaken.”  Something crossed Dr. Erskine’s face then, regret, anger, but he schooled it away just as quickly, smiling obscurely over at Steve. “I certainly have been before, but no, I do not believe I am, not this time.”  He fixed Steve with an intense stare, far more intense than the way Steve was accustomed to being looked at, looked through by people in positions of power and influence.  He felt a little like a butterfly pinned to a board.  It should have been unpleasant, but it didn’t feel hostile, just curious, hopeful almost.  Steve sat up straighter, tried to look like the kind of fella Dr. Erskine could count on.
“Fuck, amazing.” Tony gasps as Steve braces a hand on the back of his neck and comes across his back with an embarrassingly loud moan.  “Holy shit.” Tony whispers, grunting when Steve lays down atop him, uncaring of the mess, intent only on gripping Tony's chin to angle his jaw for a long deep kiss that leaves them both shivering. They stay like that for a time, Steve drawing Tony into slow lingering kisses over his lips, the back of his neck, and the sculpted lines of his shoulders, until Tony is squirming beneath him with renewed arousal. Steve has been half hard for a while, but the tilt of Tony's hips, and the strong hand gripping his own encouraging him to press his fingers back into warm gripping heat brings him all the way around to fully hard.
“That's doctor sugar britches to you. What about my doctorates, emphasis on the 's'? As in I have several, I'm being insulted, betrayed.” Tony says seriously, but the corners of his eyes are crinkling up. Bruce is just shaking his head. Tony still lets Steve hug him close, and later he doesn't protest when Steve holds his hand under the table, so he counts it as a win.
“Natasha,” he said, laughing. Natasha only smiled in response, reaching up with one of her gloved hands and patting his cheek, before sweeping up her mug and walking towards the door.
"You what, really?” Tony asks faintly, eyes raking up and down Steve's body incredulously.
statement of a gift, it practically laid out that you wanted to bond, the only thing more like a proposal was a handfasting silk.
to hide it, can't pretend not to feel what I feel about you so it's a good thing I'm here in this century because anyone woulda taken one look at my face and known.” Steve says, and the conviction there, the fervency of his affection is so unlike anything Tony has ever experienced that he has trouble even processing it.  He drops his drink, sinking down onto the floor of the limo with Steve and throwing his arms around him to cling tight. Steve doesn't even hesitate, just holds him close, strokes gentle fingers through his hair the way did that night sitting at his mom's piano-like Tony is special, like he's something
“Of course, what's up Captain handsome, something on your mind?” He keeps the tone light, walking beside Steve towards his suite. Their shoulders bump companionably. Beside him, Steve is worrying his bottom lip. He doesn't speak until they're in front of Tony's door.
dead, tiny bit.”
“Oh God,”  He gasped, “Bucky, he’s dead, and nothing on Earth can change that.”  A part of him was ashamed at the despair in his voice, but it didn’t really matter, did it?  These were strangers to him.  The robot stepped closer, cautiously, holding a hand out to him in a placating gesture, a red and gold mystery stranger than Jim Hammond.  It was beautiful, a strange sleek almost liquid-like metal, shining red and gold,  with glowing blue stars set into its chest, eyes and palms.  “Is the war over, did we win?  Where am I?  How did I get here?  Who are you?”  He asked, lowering his fists.  The Viking and the robot looked at each other, and the robot stepped closer.  This close, it was clearly taller than him, he could hear something humming away all through it, as if it were innervated in some way, like living metal.  Iron man they had called him, and Thor, same as the Nordic god?  Steve thought he might have still been dreaming, or he would have, but even his mind was not so imaginative.
“Oh-” Steve gasps, overcome just with the way Tony feels inside. He's so soft, hole still gripping at his finger, leaking Steve's come when he carefully works a second finger into him. Tony's hand grips more tightly on his knee, and he blows out another breath, groaning as Steve curls his fingers inside him, just the way Tony does when he's making Steve crazy with want from this same thing. Steve remembers how good it always feels, how amazing Tony makes him feel. He wants to make Tony feel like that too, to make everything dissolve into pleasure and want, to please him and show him how much he loves him. His eyes are bright, watching Steve, his mouth open and wet, and Steve strokes him inside, moaning himself as Tony's body flutters around his fingers, as Tony's stomach quivers and he twists into Steve's touches.
“I miss you already.” He whispers to the air, he knows with the channel Sam has set up that Tony will hear him. Surely enough, Tony's voice filters in through the speakers set into his ceiling.
“Do not blame me, I'm not the one that promised kisses.” Tony says with a shrug, giving JARVIS and the armor a high five when he joins them in walking up the ramp. Steve laughs, squeezing him a little more tightly against his side.  “You find out what you needed, what are we dealing with?” Tony asks, once the ramp has closed behind them, and SHIELD can no longer eavesdrop on their conversation.
“So pretty, absolutely gorgeous darling.  There’s no one more perfect, no one for me at any rate.  Does it bother you? I can stop if you like, but I do think that about you baby.”  Tony looks a little pink in the face himself. He feels warm all over, almost dizzy with the praise, and Steve thinks about that, about Tony not calling him pretty, and sweet, and all the other things he says that make his face burn and his brain do loop-de-loops of excitement.
“Please tell me you're wearing a suspender belt.” He says semi dazedly, Steve smiles, wide and promising.
“I think yes, green, anything.” He says, and he means it. He can't think of anything Tony has ever done that he didn't outright love, and there's no doubt in his mind that if they ever did discover something that didn't really ring his bell-that Tony would stop immediately. “I trust your judgment, I want it, want you.” It comes out clumsy, almost jumbled, but Tony just sighs, leans in to kiss him.
The endearments make him flush all down his chest the way they always do, but there's something in them today that Tony hides most nights. Steve steps closer, reaching out to wrap a hand around the narrow span of Tony's wrist. “Sounds good to me, but you're going to have to teach me how to work with your fancy ingredients if we're doing something other than boiled potatoes.”
“Oh sweet mother of Tesla. Good Jesus
On a call with Tony, he’d learned the government didn’t own him anymore.  He was his own man, free to do as he pleased, whether that was joining the Avengers or striking out on his own.  It had been freeing at the time, but now there was a part of him that longed for a mission to keep his feet on the ground.  He wouldn’t rejoin however, there were soldiers all over the world, battles Steve didn’t understand why they were fighting.  Money, oil, empire, that was hardly a Nazi threat, and while there were places soldiers were greatly needed, he would have no control of where he would be sent.  He wouldn’t become a puppet or a prop for some overblown politician with more greed than sense.
JARVIS doesn't dignify that with a response, choosing instead to turn the tap on to Tony's favored temperature for shaving.  “Yeah yeah, I hear you, oh disapproving child of mine.” He mutters, setting about brushing his teeth, shaving, and wrangling his hair into some semblance of order. He'd really like to shower too, but he's sure Steve is hungry, and he doesn't want to make Steve wait on him that long.  Tony eyes his collection of fragrances critically, he definitely needs to put some cologne on at least.  He vacillates between his favorites for a few minutes before selecting something unisex; vanilla and grapefruit with a hint of sandalwood.  Maybe he doesn't need to go through all this trouble, and maybe Steve doesn't mind him looking like a sleepy wreck, but Tony has an image to maintain here-he needs to be good, he needs to be better for Steve. Not that there's really anything to maintain after the fiasco with Hammer, but a man can dream.
“What do you mean we’re neutral?”  Steve asked in horror, picking up the paper and setting it on the desk.  “Have you seen what they’re doing over there, those Nazi bastards, what’s America even about if we’re not joining up to fight them tooth and nail?”  He could tell he was speaking too loudly, that his hands were shaking, but he didn’t care.  How could anyone, even some slimeball politician, see what was happening over in Europe and not want to stop it?
“If you can answer, I'd like to ask you a few things about Mister Stark.” Oh. Oh
“Oh I don't know, the kind that kisses on first dates.” Steve fires back-without missing beat. Tony laughs, reaching across the table to steal Steve's untouched cup of coffee in retaliation-only to put it down after the first sip when Steve flips one of the big laminated menus up to obscure their faces when he leans across the table to pull him into a slow lingering kiss.
“Have you-” Steve rasps out, clearing his throat and trying again. “Have you been waiting long?” He asks, and he can't help it, he reaches up, tracing his fingers over the base of the plug. Tony is lube-wet around it, the skin silky and hot. He gasps at the touch, hips tilting up in wordless invitation.
“Why does everyone keep giving me forehead kisses?” Tony mutters against Steve's neck.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steve doesn't think he'll ever be the same, and he wouldn't take it back for anything.
“You're not going back to SHIELD then?” Tony's voice sounds thready, almost choked with repressed emotion, but Steve knows his lover by now.
No one was saying omegas
“Cap-Steve, he's such a good guy. He's...he's amazing, and me I'm-I'm” Tony falters, scrubbing a shaking hand over his face again before shoving both hands in his pockets and hunching over on the couch.
“How's that for tradition wise guy?” Steve says against Tony's ear.
seen you before the serum, there are a lot of pictures floating around.  They made comic books about you!  I read them!”  It was Tony’s turn to look a little red.  He frowned, swiping a napkin from the stack in the center of the table and leaning in to dab some sauce from Steve’s face.  Oh boy.
“Man,"  Rhodes says, his dark eyes wide, "those films really weren't propaganda.  That really is impressive up close.” Rhodes says, shaking his head and peeling open his fruit cup.  "Look, Captain, I know you're both grown adults, but this could go south so fast."
“Don’t be in a rush to get out there, a leanbh, I see you thinking.”  Sarah said, hugging him a little more tightly against herself.
“When will he be back anyway?” He asks.  The reply is prompt and concise.
“What for fella?  All of you were amazing just now, I don’t know where President Roosevelt has been keeping you all, but I sure am glad to meet you.”
“Night guys.” Tony waves, looking back over his shoulder at Steve; something like longing nests beneath his lashes. “Goodnight Steve.” He says, soft, cautious, and then he's gone, off to bed where he'll likely wake up at four in the morning to burn the candle at both ends again.
“God,” He gasps, when Tony spreads his thighs wide and pulls his knees up, quirking an eyebrow at Steve as he does.
Steve shivered, pulling the blanket over his head and falling over onto the mattress on his side.  Seventy years gone, just like that, within the blink of an eye.  How did you even come to grips with something like that?  Everything he’d known, everyone he’d loved.  Steve clapped a hand over his mouth.  He was shaking apart, curling into himself the way he might behind the shield to save him from a blast.  The shield could not save him now.  It was still on his back, and Steve sobbed, rolled up to sit and slung it off his shoulders to thump onto the floor.  He didn’t know what to do.  Seventy years,
“We'll help you decorate it. That's a big tree, wouldn't want you to have to do it all alone.”  He says, offering tony an encouraging smile. Tony's smile in return is brilliant, and Steve holds his arms out, motioning his favorite fella down. He gets his wish, and an armful of warm snuggly genius when Tony jumps into his arms a few ladder steps from the bottom. Catching him takes barely any effort at all, and is completely worth it when he gets a tight hug for his heroics.  “Good morning Tony.” He murmurs, setting Tony down and kissing his cheek. Tony flushes a little, darting in to give him one in return.
“Do you like peas?” Tony says suddenly, head snapping up where he's standing next to Steve by the stove.
“Your mouth says demons but I saw all that new gear you made ‘em, you big softie.” It was true too, there was no expense Tony would spare, neither with his time or his money, or just anything, when it came to the team. He got the feeling part of why Tony worked so hard was to make sure the Avengers never wanted for anything.
that, didn't you?” Tony sounds delighted, fastening his mouth over his nipple and lavishing it with attention until Steve is squirming and panting with the effort of staying still.
“Honey, beloved, what do you want?”  Tony's voice sounds rough, hot with arousal when he pulls back from the kiss, but he's also clearly exhausted.  “Tell me and you can have it, what is it, big guy, what can I give you, hmm?” Tony follows each word with a kiss, and clever touches, hands stroking over the planes of Steve's chest, lips chasing the pulse in his throat in a ring of gently biting nips.
He moved differently since he had come into his omegahood; he moved like he knew he was being watched.  Of course Steve was watching him, and so was half the class, as Russell sat down to look at the little gifts arrayed all over his desk.  As Steve watched, one of their classmates leaned into Russell’s space and whispered to him.  Russell turned in his seat a moment later to look at Steve.  It was a sharp glance, but he hooded the look, his gaze drifted to the side, and then he took off his gloves, rolling them up in his hand.
. Steve thinks morosely. Steve has the sneaking suspicion their conversation was being listened in to, but he has no way of proving it.
He doesn't give their conversation much thought after that, but he really should have known that Tony doesn't forget things nearly as much as he pretends to.
“Oh yeah, worth getting out of bed.” He mutters, before slogging off to pour himself a cup of coffee. Steve piles a plate high with food, smiling at Tony's back helplessly and taking his seat at the table with the other Avengers present.
“What's dirty by a villain's standards?” Tony asks, sauntering over to perch himself on the arm of the couch closest to Steve.
“Gorgeous, you're so gorgeous, so beautiful, so good.” Steve feels like he might be rambling, but it's all true. Tony is all of those things and more whether he's flushed with pleasure beneath Steve, or wandering around his lab idly spinning ideas that will change the face of modern technology.
Steve drops his ankle, unbuckling his seatbelt to crawl up between Tony's slightly spread thighs. They fall apart a little further to make room for the breadth of Steve's body, Tony's head tipping up when Steve leans over him.
“You don't usually let people hold you like that.” Steve says, once the car has pulled out onto the road. It appears to be self driving. Wild.
“Forget about it-” Steve laughs, his accent doing a good impersonation of a guy from Goodfellas. Tony is charmed beyond belief. “Go back to sleep Tony.”
“I said yes, I gave my word.”  Steve said, as they rounded the corner.  He was starting to feel cold again, the rush and urgency draining out of him in a slow sapping wave.
“Haven’t been the same since we lost Moon and Entwistle, requiescat in pace.”
“Jarvis?”  Steve asked, his ears were ringing, his palms felt clammy.
“Don't worry, I'm on it Cap.” Natasha's smile is more than a little scary, but she's on his side. Everyone in this room is on his side. Well, other than Hammer of course, but it's a novel concept.
“Are you familiar with the language of flowers Captain?” Back when in the forties his ma' had given him entire books on the subject, telling him fondly that the little details could make all the difference when it came to turning someone's head.  Steve nods, rubbing his suddenly sweaty palm over his pants nervously. This is his first overture, he needs it to go off without a hitch. He really hopes Tony won't laugh at him, or worse, be upset.
“You've asked me that four times already.” Cap says, but he doesn't sound annoyed at all at having apparently been repeating himself; just deeply concerned. Tony wonders if he's concussed. This feels deeper than that though. He feels like a passenger in his own body, in his own brain. Just knowing his own name seems a monumental task.
“It was a royal pain in my ass, honestly.  Roy, one of the shareholders, spent half the meeting droning on about meaningless crap, and the rest trying to give me some Patriot’s tickets.”  Tony’s lip curled, he shuffled his cards around.  “I don’t even like that team, it’s all about showing me how much money he’s throwing around.  If he really wanted to impress me you would think he would figure out my favorite teams.”
“He didn't
” Steve grouses, wishing suddenly he hadn't chugged that Asgardian booze so quickly. Or maybe wishing for his shield if only for something to keep his hands busy.
But he doesn't sound upset, just amused.  Steve wonders how far ahead of them he is, those rocket boots of his had sure looked pretty speedy.
“Tony.” He starts, and brown eyes drag up to narrow in his direction.
“It's your color.” He says when Tony looks down at it, fingers slipping over the cool glowing plastic. “The holograms, your holograms. The arc light, it's...it's that blue.” Steve stutters out, his eyes wide and so incredibly blue in the soft light of the necklaces. Tony forgets to breathe. Steve
Tony was probably an alpha, but it wasn’t unheard of, was it?  The saleswoman hadn’t seemed all that surprised.  He imagined it, Tony laying back, letting Steve cover him with his body.  He would be so warm, he always looked so warm, welcoming.
The first touch of their lips is more a question than anything else. Just a dry rub of their mouths together. Steve's lips are so soft, warm, just the simple contact sends shiver down Tony's spine, and god Tony wants this so badly. Steve hums, tilting his head to brush his lips over Tony's again, one of his arms goes around Tony's waist, pulling him closer, pressing their bodies together tightly. Okay, so maybe Steve and the word shy should never be in the same sentence. Tony's arms are trapped between their bodies, so he wiggles them out, getting his fingers into silky blond hair, opening his mouth against Steve's, and deepening the kiss with the experience of long practice. Steve tastes warm, sweet, like the lambic he'd been drinking earlier, and the tiny chocolate kisses he had been eating by the handful. Tony can't get enough.
“Oh my god, whatever, let's go take a shower, and then mythical Norse spaghetti.”
A high whining sound broke through his contemplation.  Iron Man could fly, apparently, and blast some kind of force with his hands no less.  Steve clambered up onto the deck and joined the fray.  And what a fray it was.  Lightning crackled high in the sky, illuminating Thor where he floated above the waves, and if he’d thought the giant was big when he’d tackled him in the submarine, he was absolutely massive now; wading through the water like an icebreaker barge through the arctic.  All around Namor, Wasp flew, firing off blasts and sparking lights, she was quite the sight, as were the pair of acrobats he had not yet met; a woman with flaming red hair, and an archer in a distracting amount of purple doing his best Errol Flynn impression.  Steve wasn’t quite sure what help he could be, but he readied his shield and let it fly.
“You became briefly agitated, but seemed content to be carried soon after.” JARVIS has a similar tone to someone trying to talk a treed cat down.  It would be kind of funny if he wasn't the one needing to be coaxed out of the metaphorical tree.  Tony blinks, hand unconsciously going to rest over the reactor.
Tony closes his eyes again, scrubbing a hand over his face, lifting his head to stare at Steve.  “The last,” He starts-the words punching out of him like shards of glass. “The last time someone tried to do this they wanted something from me. They all want something.”
“Great, that's really great, hope you like the place I found.” Steve says, beaming at him as he rattles off the address for Happy.
even if that plan is frustrating him to the ends of the Earth right this moment.
“That's not what this is about. One day when you're comfortable we can...I would-I want that with you too, but I wanna be romantic with my fella, didn't ever really get to do that before.” Steve cups his cheek, dropping a kiss that's disproportionately chaste compared to what they had been up to before. Tony's eyes flutter shut all the same. It's so easy to let Steve be gentle with him. The kisses are soft now, sending tingling shivers of sensation down his spine and making something heady and sweet twist in his stomach-and Tony likes sex,
“No.” Tony grits out. Steve's hand stills on his back. Tony turns finally to look at him. He doesn't think he's ever seen Steve look quite this agitated. He looks like he would really really enjoy going back and kicking the shit out of Hammer.
“Nothing about me is little Shellhead.” Steve says as cheerfully as he can manage, sitting down on the ground and gesturing at himself with his good arm. Iron Man stares at him momentarily before crouching at his side.
having or characterized by persistent or earnest desire:
Steve's broad palms sweep around to comb through his hair, then down the back of his neck.
Eventually he makes it out to the garden. It's a cool night, just edging on too cold, but Tony needs out of the gala for a little while. The air smells like flowers. He remembers his mother planting night blooming Jasmine all over the place here and smiles. Music floats out from inside the hotel, but Tony pays it no mind; walking through the garden paths and sipping his drink slowly-only to be stopped by JARVIS grabbing his arm and stepping smoothly in front of him.
Every person he knew, everyone that ever truly mattered to him is dead. Dead or spending their last days in a retirement home. Steve is a soldier, he was trained to understand that people dying was an option. He never was that good at losing people though, and this, he was not trained for anything like
“Welcome back sweetheart, do what you needed?” He says between kisses, shivering when Tony grabs his hands and leads them down to feel what he's been up to.
It was the last time he felt true confidence for a while.
Steve and Sam are across the room dipping strawberries in a chocolate fountain while Carol appears to be glaring a general into submission. There is a story there, he's sure of it. Other Avengers are around as well, almost the entire roster, active or inactive, it would seem. He spots Luke Cage and Jessica Jones dancing together in one of the less busy corners of the dancefloor. He didn't expect all of them to come, the only ones missing are the Spider-Kid and Bruce. Spidey has school, and Bruce is off on one of his adventures and does not do well with events like these and declined the invite despite Tony offering to fly him in.
He still fell ill around October, bronchitis taking hold of him and not leaving until December.  It was in December of 1941 that the congress finally did what they should have done years prior, and it would have meant a lot more to Steve had it not taken Pearl Harbor to get congress’ collective heads out of their rear ends.
I am not Oliver fucking Twist I did not-” Tony appears to be trying to work himself out from beneath Steve, succeeding only in half turning to claw at the soft mats beneath them. “say please sir may I have some, more!”
“Oh yeah, you gonna woo me?” Tony asks, batting his lashes at Steve in a way he hopes is coy, but probably comes off kind of more as
For a moment it's enough to cut through the panic making his hearing fuzz in and out, but it's soon back full force. His glass drops, shattering on the ground and spilling watered down whiskey everywhere. Some of the liquid hits his face, and he remembers being held under water, remembers hands in his chest.  JARVIS is listing off legal offenses to a cowering Justin Hammer. He hears something about conspiracy to commit treason before he's putting his head between his knees and trying to get his breathing back under control. The grass is nice and soft at least, even if the air coming into his lungs burns with the force of his inhales.
“Did you bring Captain America on our date?”  Roy said, his voice had gone alarmingly high, like a rat in a trap, or maybe a weasel.  Tony rested his head on Steve’s shoulder and smiled over at Roy in a good approximation of a shark.
“Not much to sully here.” Steve says with a shrug when Clint gapes at them both. Clint's eyes get a little wider when Steve's hands migrate south to cup Tony's backside and give a good squeeze. Someone has a
“Steve, it's fine, it's great. I would love to go have Froyo with you. Let's do this.” It's so normal, so
Steve couldn’t wrap his head around it, wanting something like that, seeking something like that.  Objectively he knew there were evil people in the world.  He had met a few in his time, but nothing like what Dr. Erskine was describing.  An alpha like that was even more incomprehensible.  Alphas were supposed to protect, to form the cornerstone of a nation’s defensive capabilities, or protect their loved ones, on a smaller scale.  Even, historically, in the times Before, when humans spent all their days warring and scraping for territory, alphas were there to protect their people.  An alpha serving the Nazis though, that wasn’t protection, that was an unspeakable evil.  He couldn’t imagine how Dr. Erskine must have felt, seeing his work empowering such a monster.  That he could sit before Steve and offer that same work to him then, Steve could not imagine what he had done to earn that trust.
Steve grins.
“Yeah, yeah, well don’t tell them that, my reputation as a heartless jerk is very important to me.” Tony said seriously, but his expression was fond.
“Come down to the lab, um see what's on the slab. Uhh-I'll call you down after I get this airplane smell off of me. I uh. Uhhh” Tony's cheeks pink when Steve rubs his thumb over the sleek hairs of his beard.  “I have something...for you. Yeah. Um. Okay leaving now!” And then he's off, power walking down the hallway and tossing rapidfire instructions to JARVIS in a language that's definitely not English.
“I'm fine, I'm fine, think you just wanted a hug.” Tony mumbles, but leans his head against Steve's shoulder nonetheless.
SHIELD shows up about ten minutes later to cart their unfortunately dressed villain off in power dampening cuffs. Tony watches him go, the guy is still unconscious, probably concussed-he doubts gravity powers did anything to make the guy's skull more sturdy, but he probably should have thought of that before trying to become lord of the waffle cones or whatever his goals were.  His bad luck that some of the Avengers' heaviest hitters answered the call.  He almost feels bad for the guy, he hadn't stood a chance.
Steve picked a few different sets up, turning them this way and that in his hand.  “I think it’s perfect, ah.  Do you have a set in garnet and gold?”  His ears were never going to stop being red at this rate, but Julia seemed to take it all in stride, producing another tray with a set of perfectly matched links.  Even the cut of the stones was the same, a nice sized emerald cut garnet surrounded by tiny dangling briolette cut ones.  They were beautiful, finer than anything else he had ever considered purchasing, well other than the waist chain, but this seemed more real, more like something he could work up the nerve to give.  “I’ll take ‘em, can I get a red box for them?”  He asked, passing them back over to Julia, who began polishing them with a cloth immediately.
“I've had a few kisses, don't worry, I'm not some rube that doesn't know how to smooch.” Steve's smile is wide, but Tony knows him well enough to see he's nervous even if he's making a joke about it.
“No, nowhere, I,”  He took another deep breath, blew it out through his nose, “who’s Tony?”
“Well I like him. I mean, gosh, the stuff he makes is just amazing, and he's so busy all the time. It's amazing he has the time to even do little things for the Avengers, but he does, and it's always incredible-” What follows is a long and surprisingly through examination of all of Tony's recent innovations and philanthropic work.  Tony is dead, this is it, this is his dying vision: Standing in a kitchen drinking a smoothie and having Steve Rogers talk about how great he is.
in those words nearly stuns Tony speechless.
“I could do you one better, use me as bait, I'll lure him to one of my test facilities, no big deal.” Tony shrugs. Steve feels his face twist right along with the yawning pit of terror opening up in his stomach.
Steve didn’t wait for them to move first, Lorenzo always said catching someone by surprise was the best way to start a fight off with the other person off balance.  That and waiting for them to make a move was just going to make his nerves even worse.  His heart was already pounding, his vision sharpened, his senses honed.  It was similar to when he had fought Andy what felt like a lifetime ago, or any of those schoolyard bullies that liked to play it big and tough, but this was more, these men could kill him, Steve understood that even as he took the first swing.  A mean right hook he had to reach for.  His knuckles twinged when the punch made contact. Time seemed to move more slowly, but then it seemed to happen all at once.  No Neck rushed at him, bowling him over onto his side, but Steve rolled with it, picked himself back up, and launched himself at the laughing bastard.  They went down in a pile of limbs, and Steve felt the anger under his skin like a living thing as he socked the guy right in the mouth.  His victory was short lived however, as tall, pale, and ugly grabbed him off his buddy and threw him backwards.  He hit the ground with a groan, more because of the wind being knocked out of him than any pain.  Stars danced before his eyes, his ears rang and his lungs struggled to draw breath, but he dragged himself back up to his feet, only to see the two men give each other a glance.  One of them tossed the bag in Steve’s face, and then they booked it out of the alleyway while Steve wheezed and clutched at the delicate white leather purse strap with shaking hands.
beyond the pale. He and Steve are really doing this thing, it's normal to want, Tony's just not used to any of his more romantic leanings being fulfilled.  He's usually the one pulling out all the stops, planning the dates, all that stuff.  They're taking this at Steve's pace though.  He has to admit, being courted by Steve Rogers is way better than his fantasies about Captain America ever could have been.
since Tony first showed him to his room in the mansion.
“Hi Steve, did you miss me?” He asks, turning his head to toss a playful yet smoldering glance over his shoulder.
to him, it's not his fault.
“That was really something, Iron Man, Tony, that’s better than a rollercoaster, wow.”  They were walking through the mansion, towards the kitchen.  He knew Tony had to leave soon, to go back to his work and his company, but for the moment it was nice to have him near.
“Hey, anytime, I mean it.  If I’m not in my room-down the hall last door at the end-then I’m in the lab, anyone can direct you.”  He stepped back after that, and went to leave.  For a moment he stood in the threshold of the room as if gripped by some internal debate, but he just gave a tiny wave, and then turned to leave.
“Got stuff to do, but you can watch, feel free to touch.” Tony murmurs, the glint in his eyes just shy of devious as he turns from the kiss to draw his right hand over an array of dazzling schematics. Steve watches silently for a moment, pressing harder against Tony's back, and dropping his head down to press open mouthed kisses to the nape of Tony's neck.
“Yeah, let's not take up the fire lane.” Steve concedes, drawing away from Tony as Happy comes around to open the door for them.
Skilled and so sweet with his little sounds, and the way he whispers praise into his ear.
“Steve-are you-are you sure you only want to sleep?” Tony speaks slowly, the hand he has on Steve's abdomen trailing a tiny fraction lower.  Steve catches that hand up in his own, turning back over and getting comfortable with Tony against his back. If they keep this up both of them won't get any sleep, and there is absolutely no way Steve will put his dick's inclinations above Tony's need to rest, no matter how hard and aroused he is.  Besides, it isn't as if he's not almost perpetually interested in Tony's presence. He thinks Tony could get him this keyed up with just a look, just a touch.
“Darling,” He rasps, “oh my darling yes, only for me, sweetheart. God I'm so greedy, keeping you all to myself, but I want you, I-Only for me,” Tony kisses him again and Steve leans into it, surrenders immediately, moaning when Tony's hand curls in his hair and pulls just so. He wants to sit at Tony's feet, hug his legs, kiss his thighs, take his perfect heavy cock in his mouth, worship him that way, he wants to be inside him too, so many conflicting things he feels dizzy and aching and wonderful all at once, because Tony said he wants him.
“Yes. But it’s Miss Stark-Rogers, now,” Kat answered.
“So, what’s it like inside?” Clint asked.
“Just hold still!”
Steve was standing by the coffee machine. Steve was there. On his day off. Next to Tony thermos, which was sitting on the counter beside him.
“Hey, Tones,” Rhodey answered, “what’s wrong?”
Steve narrowed his eyes back at her, “Who is it?” He knew that look; she was teasing him. Again.
"I was hoping that now would be the exception."
They figure it out just in time for a fight to happen.
you. You’re clever, and nice with the kids. My students always talk about you! M.J. keeps telling me how much Peter loves your class!” He huffed and his hands left his pockets, his arms crossing over his chest. He looked… insecure? “I want to meet the Tony they’re talking about,” Steve continued, his tone softening as his gaze dropped to the floor. “Can I take
“Sis,” Peter jumped in, “you may not have powers or superhuman abilities. And you may not be a genius. But you have good common sense and you sure picked up skills from Uncle Clint and Aunt Nat faster than I ever could.”
“I’m… I’m sorry, I’ve been… an ass.” He rubbed a hand over the back of his neck, and then fidgeted with his glasses. He forced himself to stop, tucking his hands into his pockets. “I just… Well, I mean, you’re really nice. And you were really sweet when you started, so I…” He felt his cheeks flush. “I kind of looked you up.” He didn’t look up; he didn’t want to see Steve’s expression.
It wasn’t “really nice” of him to take up so much space in Steve’s head while he was supposed to be working. He huffed softly to himself as he watched the class start on their partner workouts. He needed to focus, no matter how much he was frustrated with Tony; or how much he wanted to have coffee with Tony and make him laugh. Steve smiled a little to himself. Maybe Tony was just shy. Maybe Bucky was right, and Tony was unsure if Steve liked him that way. There was no way for him to know until he asked.
More than once, Steve scrolled through his and Tony’s texts to make sure they hadn’t already made plans for food. It was almost five o’clock. He didn’t want to not prepare something if he was supposed to. Worrying about it was no use, though, after a thorough check. Steve focused on getting dressed. He put on the aqua top. The red one with the vivid orange star was fun, and, for some reason, he thought Tony would like it. But he’d worn the aqua and magenta one to film on Monday, so he needed to wear it again.
, Tony. What happened to your man?”
"Dad and Pop were alright with it!”
They walked for a bit longer before settling on a bench for a few minutes. The sun was low on the horizon; nearly gone. They watched it disappear.
“You got a date yet, Stevie?” Bucky asked, pressing a beer into Steve’s hand and reaching for a slice of pizza.
Bruce shrugged, “It’s probably not instantaneous. Different components of the radiation will probably be revealed within the next month or so, judging by the rate it’s affecting Peter’s cells.”
Steve took a deep breath and stood up. The agent grinned.
“Do it!” Steve ordered, struggling with his opponent.
Kat nodded, “Cool. Dad doing anything?”
Loki still had a satisfies smirk on his face, “Was that enough research for you?”
“Why are you wearing
“How’s Peter?”
“No… No… No, that was two weeks ago… Nah…” he mumbled to himself as he flipped through them.
"Peter, you should've told her first. At least let her know you might not make it," Tony said, giving Peter a disapproving stare. "Nonetheless she shouldn't have reacted that way. Do you know what might have caused that?"
“I had to start the music earlier than I wanted,” he said, shrugging. He sat on the floor to stretch. “But this will be easier, I think. It’ll give be a cleaner place to cut the clip.”
“Thanks, Papa.”
Tony had introduced himself to Steve in the break room during Steve’s first week. His fluffy hair and large glasses – and wow, he even kept pens in his shirt pocket, with a pocket protector – were so adorable and Steve couldn’t help the little crush that instantly formed. He thought, at the time, it might have been returned. They kind of danced around each other for a while. Though, Tony seemed to avoid Steve more and more as the semester went on.
Fury and Kat made their way down to the Tower’s common room where the rest of the Avengers were waiting. Peter stood up as soon as the two exited the elevator. Fury held a straight face and Kat’s eyes were trained on the floor.
Riri rolled her eyes, as if it should’ve been obvious. “You haven’t been to the break room in, like,
“I will.”
Emotional first day on the job.
The blonde raised an eyebrow, “And when is testing?”
Tony's eyes widened and he leaned in a little. "Steve, I couldn't let Ross catch me, I-"
“Just nervous. I don’t want to be treated differently for any reason, and despite that, it will be weird being in that kind of school setting!”
“I see it behind the books you read. I’m not stupid.”
It took all of Tony's energy not to scream when he saw the blood spatter on the snow and Steve fall over the edge. A package was shoved into his hands before the agents started to head back into the facility. He stared at the spot Steve had been standing. The package - food - crinkled in his hands as he walked to the edge. He couldn't see Steve's body. But he might if he survived the fall.
There would be a party at the Tower that night with the rest of the Avengers and Gwen. It was a small party, though happy. Kat had asked that no one get her anything, but she suspected that Tony had gotten her something anyway. He had asked her Friday, the last day of school, for all her measurements. She had to retake a few of them, but quickly got a list to her dad. She figured that he was getting her some kind of outfit. Boy, was she in for a surprise.
Peter chucked, and Kat smiled and answered, “Yes, Pop. And I actually really like the fact that it’s a flip phone. It’s pretty cool.”
Tony was indeed on the other side of the door, dressed in his usual slacks and button-up. He had forgone the pocket-protector, no pens or anything in his front pocket. His hands were folded behind his back, though Steve didn’t notice at first as they just smiled at each other. Tony revealed his hands then, holding out a small bouquet of orchids as his gaze flitted between Steve’s eyes and his tights.
Something inside Kat snapped, and she started yelling as tears welled up in her eyes.
Steve waited for another hour before Kat finally woke up. She was disoriented for a moment, but when she saw her Papa sitting next to her, half asleep, she smiled.
Steve shivered again, and let Tony push him down onto the bed. He laid back, hips at the edge, and Tony pressed his hands against the mattress, by his head. Steve didn’t dare move them, his breath stuttering.
“Is it not right? That’s how Natasha taught me to make it.”
Tony and Steve immediately recognized the voice. Steve signaled for the rest of the Avengers to stay back, but to be on guard. Tony flew Steve up and both stood on the opposite side of the roof from Loki. No one said anything for a moment. Tony and Steve were too shocked. Armor littered the roof, and an iron suit helmet lay off to the side, half intact. Steve’s heart was quickly grasped by cold fear. Kat…. Where was Kat? Tony’s eyes were already on her, and Steve soon saw as well.
Tears were in Steve’s eyes as he explained, “It was the scariest ten seconds of my life. I didn’t know if Tony would catch you. A million different scenarios ran through my head about how terribly it could have gone. Tony came up and told me that Peter had caught you and I nearly lost it. Tony flew us down and then flew you off almost immediately. I… I blamed myself.”
He'd done so many things wrong this time; made so many mistakes. He'd let his personal life get in the way of the situation. He'd been stuck in the past again, focused on saving Bucky instead of his new family. He'd let them tear each other apart. He'd kept secrets from Tony and nearly killed him. He'd let down Sam and Clint, and Wanda and Scott. He'd let down Natasha. If Bruce and Thor were here... God, even though they weren't, he'd let them down, too. And Pietro was probably rolling around in his grave. Peggy would slap him for this; tell him he was an idiot and fix it because Steve was incompetent. Bucky... he'd let down Bucky, too.
“Say goodbye.”
“Morning, Rogers,” he answered, unintentionally short.
Kat laughed, weakly, “I don’t know if I could stay awake!”
“Are you proud of yourself?” Steve broke the silence.
Tony rubbed the swab on a microscope slide and set it under the microscope leans.
Kat sat next to her brother. Peter was reading over the orientation packet they’d gotten in the mail – again. Kat snatched it.
Bruce turned to Peter, “Where were you bitten?”
Kat shrugged, “I don’t like to draw myself. Besides, there are no more female Avengers.”
Steve smiled and poured them each a glass of water before filling the vase and giving the orchids a drink. He set the glasses on his kitchen table, pretending not to notice the way Tony was still attempting not to stare at his legs. They were quiet as they both sipped their water, just looking at each other for a moment. Together, they started to laugh softly, giggling over the rims of their glasses at each other.
did you? Rogers, what the hell?”
There was an awkward silence as the coffee pot sputtered, and Tony quickly pulled it off the burner to fill his thermos. Steve shuffled into his peripheral vision and leaned against the counter, though that was awkward as well; Steve was holding himself stiffly.
Peter looked up, face scrunched in confusion, “Crop tops?”
“Kat,” Tony started, cautiously, “you don’t have to do these all at once. You could do these other two, tomorrow. It’s a lot less to immerse yourself in at one time, and you can get in some relaxation time afterwards.”
Tony stepped quickly inside, like maybe Steve would close the door on him if he didn’t move fast enough. Steve closed the door and took Tony’s coat, hanging it up before motioning for him to follow Steve into the kitchen. The one vase he owned was in the back of his glasses cupboard, and he set a couple cups by the sink as he moved them around to find his vase, offering Tony a drink.
“What happened?”
Peter’s eyes went wide, “That is so cool!”
Steve stepped forward, protectively, “Why did you need saving?”
“You’re all being little shits. Work on your project before I fail all of you.”
There.
"I've lost too many people, I can't lose you, too," Steve blurted.
Steve huffed a small laugh, face aflame and his lower belly throbbing with warmth. “Not if you keep me waiting like this,” Steve answered, almost giggling with nerves as he gripped the sheets where Tony had placed his hands. His hips rolled, trying unsuccessfully to grind against Tony’s. “Tony, please,” he begged, “don’t stop.”
“Why are you here?” Tony interrupted. Steve wasn’t supposed to be here.
"I thought Peter told you!" Tony exclaimed.
He then turned and tossed Kat off the side of the roof; then he disappeared to hide again.
“Aw, c’mon. Why not?”
“Stop!” Peter yelled. He put his hands on Steve’s shoulders, and looked his father in the eye. “Pop, it’s not your fault. It was her first fight! That’s nerve-wracking. My first assignment, I would have had something similar happen if we all hadn’t been in a group. She couldn’t be in a group this time. It was circumstance.”
Steve chuckled, “I’ll bet. But you’ve had a long day. You should sleep, I’m sorry for waking you.”
“I can’t believe you’ve never been here before,” Tony said, once they had gotten settled in the booth. “It’s great. I thought you would have heard about it and visited by now.”
"Not nothing. Something. What is it?"
A new blush spread over Tony cheeks, and Steve found he liked it just as much as he had the first time. “Um, well, I mean…” Steve grinned wider.
“Climbing the tree, what does it look like?” Peter snarked.
Coming home for the Parker twins.
Tony didn’t stop again until both he and Steve were a panting mess, lying haphazardly across the bed, sticky and sated. Steve was still foggy, warm and tingly all over, as Tony pushed himself up off the bed, shuffling into the bathroom to dampen a washcloth. He must’ve cleaned himself while he was there, because he cleaned only Steve up when he made it back to the bedroom.
“So, what’s up?” Kat asked.
Kat and Peter laughed and nodded. Their food rang up at the counter and Steve went up to get it. When they all had their sandwiches everyone took a bit together, starting their first real meal as an official family. As they ate, they talked about Peter and Kat – mostly about their musical talents.
To celebrate the successful move, they went out to dinner. Steve and Tony wouldn’t tell them where until they got there. It was a nice surprise when they pulled up to the Shawarma. Peter and Kat had never tried it and were very glad to be able to try some. They ordered and sat down, laughing and talking with each other.
Steve frowned, pressing the button for the bed to push him up into a sitting position. "Why are you here?"
Suddenly JARVIS spoke, “Good morning, Miss Kat. You are up early.”
“Okay, okay!” Steve said, holding his hands up. “I’m sorry. But we worry about you. It’s because we love you, Kat, not because we think you’re incapable.” He put his arm around his daughter.
Kat nodded, “I can do that.”
“So what are you planning to do with your week?”
“Thanks, Sourpatch,” Tony sighed, relaxing a little as they hung up. He could do this.
Kat wrapped her arms around her brother and they held each other tightly. It wasn’t a minute before Steve hugged both of them, and then it took only a few seconds for Tony to join in. They stood like that for a few minutes.
Steve held his daughter’s good hand, “Kat. We love you. That’s why we adopted you and Peter. And we have grown as a family – all of the Avengers, even, not just the four of us. You are important to all of us and we wouldn’t let you join the Avengers if we didn’t think you weren’t needed or wanted.”
Tony’s, he really ought to return it.
"When?" Kat screamed again. "When you were walking out the door?"
"Any final words, Captain Rogers?"
The rest of the Avengers congratulated her, and hugged her and all that good stuff before they started asking questions.
“And to have to months to adjust to having two new kids in the house!”
“No.”
Kat’s head snapped to the side and she stared a moment before answering, “No. Daddy will probably make me get one for whatever event he hosts next. But I don’t want it right now. I don’t need it.”
Peter hoped that Kat wouldn’t have to be “gone” anytime soon.
The movie night ended up being a success, and Tony didn’t watch the new video until Sunday night. He even did a better job of moving along instead of just watching. And if he thought of Steve’s muscled legs in those wonderfully ridiculous tights in the shower later? Didn’t matter. Nunya business.
Tony’s fingers stopped. Why did they stop? His hands settled solidly on Steve’s hips, “Hey. Steve, look at me real quick.” Steve obeyed, blushing. “You okay?”
“Alright, I give, ladies. Is there something on my shirt?” He looked down, but there was nothing on him. None of his pens had burst in his shirt pocket.
Steve warned Sam and Bucky that morning. He didn’t know what all they’d be getting up to, but he did know that, no matter what he and Tony ended up doing, he didn’t want his friends to interrupt quite yet. Bucky bitched about it and Sam just winked, reminding him to use protection. Steve blushed, told Sam to fuck off, and hid back in his apartment. He vacuumed, swept, and picked up paints and tried not to think about doing things with Tony that would necessitate the condoms he’d stashed in his bedside table drawer.
Peter frowned, “Kat…?”
He caught M.J. smirking at him, and sent her an unimpressed frown. She rolled her eyes and focused back on her partner.
“We were so lucky to bring you and your brother home.” His voice shook.
As the end of the class time neared, Steve passed out disinfectant wipes for everyone to clean their equipment. Cleanup went quickly, since all of his students had somewhere to be afterwards. M.J. gave him a wave and pointed stare as she left. Steve chose to ignore the latter action, though he did smile and wave back. He changed in his office, and made his way down to the garage. His thunderbird was waiting for him near the door. He straddled the bike, walking it down to the first level to exit the parking garage.
The ladies were still smiling and giggling between themselves as they turned back to their work. Tony sighed, ignoring Harley’s quiet laughter in favor of getting his laptop properly booted up. He opened the gradebook to start putting in the grades from all the papers he’d gone over that weekend. The gentlemen didn’t seem to be discussing their work like the ladies, rather, Harley was explaining to Peter about the crop tops, making Peter gasp. But at this point, Tony just worked on tuning them out. They were smart kids, and if they were going to gossip instead of work, Tony was going to let them figure out how they failed the assignment on their own. He’d given them enough warnings.
Steve frowned, “Kat you’re working yourself a little hard. Didn’t you already study all this for other tests? I’m sure you’ll be fine!”
Steve tuned them out, but he didn’t really mind their bickering. It was kind of sweet that they cared. Bucky was probably right though. He needed to be more direct with Tony. It was a Monday, after all, maybe it had just been a rough morning.
"I'm not letting you go, Steve. The people need you," Tony answered stubbornly, holding Steve tighter.
“Papa, I know!” Kat groaned. “Peter and Daddy have said that, too.”
“-downtown, would you like to go with me?” Steve’s question trailed off a little at the end, and when Tony glanced back, he looked confused. The furrow between his brows was, frankly, adorable. Tony needed to get out of there.
Peter answered before Kat could exaggerate anything, “A car came screaming around the corner – just outside the Tower! – and I picked her up and jump out of the way.”
They’d eaten late, so upon entering Kat’s room they found her sound asleep on her math book. Tony moved the book from under her head and Steve pulled a blanket over her. They were going to catch her tomorrow after school. Surely she had all the material practically memorized? Besides, she should have a day to rest her brain. Peter and Gwen could be there, too. They hadn’t spent time together as a group for a long time.
Steve raised an eyebrow, "Which one NCIS or Sherlock?"
It was about four o’clock when Ms. Cordova – their supervisor – entered the yard followed by two men. They were chatting and looking around, Kat and Peter only looked up for a moment before turning their attention back to the – almost finished – sketch of four of the Avengers. Kat was finalizing some of the details on the faces. She was working on Captain America’s face when three pairs of legs appeared in her peripheral vision. She raised her head and looked into the same pair of eyes she had just been putting the finishing details on. She looked down at the drawing and then back up at the face. Down again, up again.
“Adorable?” Rhodey cut him off, finishing the thought for him. “You see him at work, right? Ask him out for coffee or something.”
"Just don't spend all day watching television, okay?"
“Everyone’s here to say hello and wish you good luck. So eat fast so you’ll be ready to go out the door in time to deal with traffic.”
Tony watched the clock for a couple minutes, trying to decide if he really wanted to check the break room. On one hand, he might run into people if he waited until tomorrow, and he wouldn’t have two thermoses in the morning. On the other, his students were clearly up to something, and that just didn’t sit well with him. If he got it over with, though, his winter break plans could proceed without any hiccups. He took a deep breath, and packed up his bag before slipping into the hallway.
As he glanced behind Peter, he could see Harley and the girls sitting together and pretending not to listen. He looked back up at Peter, raising an unimpressed eyebrow. “They put you up to asking, huh?” But it wasn’t really much of a question. Tony stood to address all four of them, arms crossed, “I’m fine. Okay? I don’t know why you’re all such Nervous Nellies all the sudden.”
, Peter shrugged and went to sit back with Harley. “Just saying.”
Peter dropped next to her and slumped to the ground to look over her shoulder at her sketchbook, “What’cha drawing?”
Saturdays were new video days. Tony didn’t really like that he knew that. He glanced over at the laptop, and decided that today, he would not give in. During breakfast, as he scrolled through the news, he kept telling himself, no, he wasn’t going to watch today. He tried to grade a few more papers that he’d had to set aside the night before, but he was still distracted. Tony sighed, biting the bullet, and pulled his phone out to call Rhodey. At least he knew when to call in the cavalry.
They all went out that night to celebrate. They started at a local diner, everyone ordering some type of burger. They spent the rest of the evening around town just walking, talking, and admiring the displays in the store windows. There were several times that one of them wanted to stop in somewhere, so they all agreed to meet back at the Tower by ten o’clock. Eventually, it was just Kat and Steve walking together.
“It’s like an electric piano,” Peter cut in. “I can make it sound like any instrument I want.”
No, he was going to shower. He was going to shower and go to bed and not think about it.
“So what makes you most excited? The Tower? The fact that you’ll be surrounded by badass superheroes and SHIELD agents?”
Sam, Clint, and Wanda were hurrying through the remains of the building, searching for Steve.
End of Chapter Eight
The line was silent just a moment before Rhodey pointed out, “If he’s still trying to talk to you, it can’t be that bad.” Tony hadn’t considered that. Rhodey continued, “Just see if he wants to get coffee, okay? The worst he could do is say no.”
“Peter, where’s Tony?”
Tony put his arm out and stopped Steve from going any farther. When Steve had moved Loki had tightened his hand around Kat’s throat. The pressure she was feeling was unbearable. Dark spots began to float in front of her eyes and she quickly lost consciousness.
Kat laughed, “I’m not an Avenger yet, and I won’t be until Fury approves my skill. You don’t have to worry so much!”
"I deserve it," he whispered.
Steve watched Tony go. Tears welled up in his eyes. Damn it. Damn it all! This shouldn’t have happened! Why didn’t Kat warn them? He ripped his helmet off and slammed it to the ground. He buried his face in his hands and tried to calm himself.
“Yeah. But, um, today is the, uh… Steve puts out new videos on Saturdays. I’m trying not to be creepy today. Could you just come over, and we can hang out?”
Steve pulled both kids into a hug, “Both of you be good to your teachers, they’re just not paid enough. And have fun.”
“And what are you planning to do with your week, Pop?” Kat asked.
“When do you have to turn these in?” Steve asked.
“Did you tell them to do this?” Tony asked.
Steve rolled his eyes and finished putting in the grade for the assignment before setting his laptop aside. “You couldn’t even wait to ask, could you?”
Kat smiled, “Yes. And I am glad I can help you protect our home.”
“So, what happened after I blacked out?” Kat asked, once her father and brother were settled in.
Peter startled and moved to brush it off, but it jumped on him and bit his hand before he shook it off and stepped on it. Peter looked at the bite. He looked over at the scientist and bid her a good evening, saying that he and his sister should get home but that he was glad to talk with her. The expo was a while from the Tower, but it was faster to walk than to brave traffic, and neither twin could drive yet, anyway.
Kat took a bite of the bacon and then put some of the eggs in her mouth as well. She moaned.
Kat smiled as she watched Peter drowsily pour himself a bowl of cereal and try to pour milk on it. He sat himself next to his sister and looked over her sketches with her, marveling and how much better they'd gotten over the past year. They finally made it to the last sketch. Kat didn't turn to the final page.
“I can see out of the eye slots, but around the inside of the mask there’s a screen that can pull up anything I need it to: data on people outside the suit, the suit’s energy levels, video of what’s going on around me, and pretty much anything I want.”
Tony pointed at them, “Alright, okay, that’s enough. You forget that I have the ability to fail you both.”
“Oh, c’mon, Stark, you can’t tell me you never noticed!” Riri laughed. “Not with all that mooning over him you’ve been doing all semester.”
"Steve, I just didn't want to chance them finding you. I... my own tech I'm sure they can't track, anything else..." He shrugged.
“We will, Pop,” Peter said. “Don’t worry.”
Tony out for coffee instead of this version of you that’s being an ass?”
“Uh, hey, Dr. Stark? Sir?”
Kat nodded and followed her dad to the elevator. Once they were in the lab and Kat’s suit was off, Tony got to work and Kat was free to do what she wanted with her afternoon. As she was leaving the lab, Tony’s remark followed her out the door:
And she did do that. She walked with her parents to the living room, where she was immediately wrapped in both Peter and Gwen’s arms. They were silent, but she knew what they would say and that was enough. They sat and watched Bambi. Kat fell asleep on Steve’s shoulder about three-quarters of the way into the movie. The others finished the movie and then Steve carried her to bed. He kissed for forehead and watched her for a few minutes before returning to the living room, from which Tony has disappeared.
Immediately, Steve hooked up the camera to his home computer and started downloading today’s footage. He grabbed his water bottle, finishing off the last bit before taking a second out of the pack. He left the office, sitting on the couch in the living room to check his work laptop. Finals season was always busy, and he needed to stay on top of grading. No one seemed to have uploaded anything yet this afternoon, but Steve left the tab open, knowing his health class had an assignment due by 11:59. Some would send them in before supper, and some. Steve knew, he wouldn’t see until the next morning.
End of Chapter Ten
“Hey, Dad! Pop! What’s up?” It was fake, but she didn’t want to worry them.
“Pete… I….” Peter raised an eyebrow at Steve. “You’re right. Okay. I’ll stop.”
The video froze, finished, and Tony quickly shut the laptop, sighing heavily at himself as he walked towards the bathroom. He showered and went to bed, curling up with his back facing the desk. He determinedly kept his hands above his belt, not wanting to add to his shame. God, if he did that, he’d have to change schools probably. He’d never be able to look Steve in the eyes again.
“See you after, Kat.”
Peter, Gwen, Steve, and Tony were sitting in the living room when Kat came home. They had the TV on and were talking, so they figured she would notice and at least ask what was going on. But she did the exact same thing as the day before. Tony and Steve quickly followed her. They walked in just as Kat was settling down with her history book and study guide.
Kat shrugged, “I guess. I still wish they’d write.”
Tony stared up at his lover, "Steve...."
“What?”
Kat smiled at the pet name. “I promise to try, Papa.”
“Maybe.”
"Were they any good?"
“But I was uncomfortable and I didn’t want her to be. Besides, she woke up! What if she’d woken up and I had her pants around her ankles?”
“Steve, babe, you coming?” Tony asked, quietly.
If possible, Tony looked even more nervous as he ran out of the break room. Steve didn’t know what he’d done to make Tony act like that, but he didn’t appreciate his accusations. He huffed and put the coffee pot back, maybe a little rougher than he’d intended. This was way more difficult than he thought. Even opening a conversation with Tony was proving to be impossible. Impossible, Steve mused, a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. When had Steve Rogers ever backed down from something impossible?
“You move pretty fast Rogers, should I be nervous?” Tony teased.
I hope you enjoyed!
It had been months since the fight in Siberia. Maybe a little over a year. Steve didn't remember. It hurt to remember.
Steve was suddenly aware of the fact that he was standing on the other side of the room, and that the chair he’d been sitting on was tipped over. At first he thought he’d had an inner monologue, but the look on his daughter’s face made him realize that he had, in fact, said it all out loud.
Peter smiled and put an arm around Kat. They walked to the next booth, which exhibited a presentation on how to safely dispose of nuclear waste. It was a cool setup, but viewers had to stand a bit back, on account of the actual radioactive material being used in the demonstration. Kat and Peter had been lucky enough to get the closest to the presentation before the next demonstration began. They were halfway through the demo when Kat saw something crawling on Peter’s shoulder. She looked closer and saw that it was a spider.
“What’cha thinking, Papa?”
Really nice? Steve’s smile dimmed, placating. “Maybe he is,” he allowed, “but we’re not going to talk about it right now.” He turned away to continue wiping down the equipment he planned for the class to use. Thankfully, his other students began to trickle in, stopping any further conversation about Tony.
Tony’s eyeroll made Steve laugh, but he was smiling, too. He accepted the glass Steve handed back to him, and followed him when Steve nodded for them to head into the office. Earlier, he’d set up his backdrop and the camera, and gotten the first small set written out on the board. He checked the camera angle again as Tony explored the space a little.
“But it would look so good!”
Steve shook his head, “I don’t want her to wake up and be alone. I’ll stay for a while longer.”
“The energy isn’t like the tesseract! It’s like something we associate with the tesseract! We’ve been running the wrong kinds of scans.”
Tony started to walk, intending to head into the bathroom. But his feet took him over to the desk, to his laptop. It was habit by now, relaxing by watching one of the videos. At least, he thought, he didn’t just sit there and watch it like a creep. He did some of the stretches – kind of – trying to follow along with Steve’s movements. Steve made it look so easy, but Tony was huffing slightly as the video came to a close.
“You haven’t tried them yet.”
Steve felt bad, so he stood and started backing up a little to the coffee maker. “Sorry, Tony, I didn’t mean to scare you. But, um, I was hoping to see you. I thought maybe we could talk.” He pulled the pot of coffee off the warmer in offering. “How do you like your coffee?”
Tony’s arms crossed, “Now you’re just teasing me.”
Alone in his apartment, Steve felt like he could finally relax a little more. He dropped his bag by the door and kicked off his shoes. The apartment was sunny, and he was glad he’d remembered to open the blinds before he left that morning. Paint tubes and brushes still littered the corner of the living room from the weekend. Steve didn’t really feel like cleaning up his supplies, though. It was delightfully chaotic.
"Catching up on a show."
The next chapter is going to be longer, almost two times as long. It's the climax of this story, so there will be one - maybe two - chapters after it. I hope you'll all like it!
Steve sighed and began giving out assignments.
“Seriously, Pop, this is great. We’ll have to thank Aunt Nat for teaching you how to make this.”
Kat smiled weakly, “Papa, ‘safe’ is never leaving home. ‘Safe’ would be just watching out for myself and not the team.”
"Herr Schmidt will be glad to hear about this. It is a shame he cannot be here to see it."
“I know.”
Steve turned around and saw Tony standing in the doorway. Steve smiled and walked over to Tony. He put his arm around the smaller man and began to lead him down the hallway.
“I thought we weren’t going to have this conversation without me,” Tony teased.
Steve smiled back, “See you then.”
“Yes, Woman of Iron?”
"I was going to tell you!" Peter repeated.
Tony laughed, “I don’t think we’ve heard you guys play yet.”
No rest for the wicked, Steve supposed. He just sighed and gave in, “Well, I asked him for coffee next weekend.” The pause after his answer was far too lengthy as Bucky and Sam just stared. “What?”
Kat chuckled, "Most likely."
“Sounds about right,” Tony chuckled with him. He sipped his water, and Steve offered to refill it for him.
“That’s great. What do you guys play?”
Tony watched them for a moment before sitting next to them and running a hand through his daughter’s hair. Kat cried and cried, finally releasing all her pent-up emotion while being comforted by her fathers.
Kat thought a moment and suddenly it hit her like a pile of bricks.
Steve and Tony watched this, being home early. The Avengers had been told to take some time off, since they had been so busy for the past few months. Peter was taking Gwen on their first official date in months, and Steve and Tony had been looking forward to spending the evening with their daughter. But seeing her disappear like that without checking for the presence of anyone else made them reconsider their activities in the past few months. Had this become normal? They saw that Kat had taken quite a bit of food with her, and it was clearly not for a snack. But they knew she had things to do, so they let her be. It was only after they’d eaten dinner that they went to check on her.
“Peter,” Tony warned.
Kat smiled, “It’s fine. I’m sure you get a lot of fans acting weird about comments you make.”
Steve took a deep breath and looked up at his daughter. He stared at her a moment before smiling and wiping his watery eyes.
