“He loves you more than anything in the world, Tony,” Barnes says. He never uses Tony’s first name, just like he never uses Barnes’.
Steve didn’t protest, just followed the directions. He kept hold of his bag and they took off for the Tower. Talking really wasn’t an option, and the soul bond while it could be quite revealing never truly offered clearly articulated thoughts. When they landed at the Tower, Steve stepped off and then as the armor dismantled, he said, “Thank you, Tony. I’ll get out of your hair.”
Steve tightened his hand around Tony’s, failing to impart his support he was sure, but it was all he had, all he could do. “Tony, I’m right here.”
“Our lion?” Tony says and his mouth is dry. “Maybe, I don’t know. He was my companion. I looked on him like a guardian.”
“No, Tony. I think it’s deeper than that. I know it would be for me.” Steve stroked a hand down Tony’s back. “When I dreamed of being with someone as a kid-.” He didn’t mention it was always a woman along society’s norms at the time. “-I always thought it would be for love. That we would finish each other’s -.”
She giggles again and rolls her eyes. “Just Pepper.” With a swing of her ponytail, the Duchess leaves him to the opulence of the prince’s world.
Natasha glares at him. “Sometimes it’s better not to say anything at all Clint.” Turning back to Steve, she says, “He’s not wrong. You brought Wanda out of her shell and I’ve heard you’ve helped a lot of the warriors with their stress in more ways than just physical. You worth it, Steve.” She squeezes his hand.
Hanging by his wrists, cuffed and beaten, smelling the putrid stench of the men around him, sick, infected, dying. They hung him up, whipped him with a scourge because he tried, he helped one of the sick men the other prisoners wanted to ravage, to rifle through his belongings when he finally succumbed to death. The sharp lash of the whip had been nothing compared to the smell as he hung for hours after the beating, as the blood and sweat smeared down his back through the rivulets of flayed skin.
Tony sucked down the last of his come and then sat up. Gooseflesh marred Steve’s skin and he shivered against the cold. Tony gathered him into his arms and then caught the edge of the blanket at the foot of the bed and covered them. “Shush.”
“Buc-.” Steve manages to spit out as Bucky hunches over him. His eyes are on fire, sweat pours off his face into his long slick hair. With both hands, Steve grabs Bucky’s arm, putting his thumbs near the vulnerable tendons of his wrist, trying to pry him off. “Plea-. Buck-.”
“Tony,” Steve says and tentatively reaches over to grasp his hand. “Tony, Hydra had your parents killed. They didn’t die in an auto accident, and it’s very likely that the Winter Soldier was responsible.”
Steve bites back his words and the events of the day flood back into his consciousness, the outstanding pain of Bucky fresh and new again. “I -.” He stops considers what to say and then only whispers, “I wanted to apologize. I promised you a service and I didn’t accomplish it. I also left when you are a paying client. I’m sorry.”
Hesitating, Tony reached out and laid his hand on Steve. “You have a home, you know. I made you a home.”
Abruptly, Clint laughs and the whole scene begins to move again. It’s so dizzyingly sudden that Steve tastes bile at the back of his throat. He swallows it down with a cringe.
“An illegal prison,” Nat said and threw the best snarl Fury that Tony had ever seen. “He was kept there to try and equilibrate his brain to the present. The memories of 65 years of freezing and being isolated, not being able to move overwhelmed him. He could barely talk at times.”
“Tony, that’s the one scheduled for termination. There must be something wrong with him.” She notices the man for the first time and her expression drops, crestfallen. “I’m sorry, Tony, you can’t do this. This isn’t one of your charity cases. You have to be serious.”
“After everything I’ve done, I just want to forget,” Tony said, eyeing the empty bottles haphazardly thrown on the floor and at the foot of the bed. He could still taste tequila on his lips.
Victoria calls him as he climbs down the rickety stairs. She tries to pull him into a conversation about a program at the park tomorrow, but Steve just waves quickly, signals to his shoes, then breaks out into a run from the stairs.
Somehow, Steve couldn’t help but believe the words were a lie. He couldn’t feel well because he threw up late into the night. Tony was trying to be strong for them—but he didn’t have to. He never said a word about the nausea he must have felt after he finished vomiting.
Steve watched that stupid imported VHS every evening, rubbing himself raw. It was the one thing that let him live through the violence in the desert. It made him want to come back to base at night. There was a time when he got sloppy at work, where he questioned what the hell they were doing in another country, fighting a war for men who yell too much about democracy but don’t do anything about inequality on their own soil. Then, Tony Stark comes into his life, giving him this sense of salvation.
“Is that what you want?” Steve waits patiently. He runs a finger through Tony’s bare shoulder, softly scratching at the space where his flesh and prosthetic meet. He’s a man whose body is filled with scar tissue. Steves has the time to explore Tony’s body now.
She was serious, she had no time for bullshit. He liked that about her. Seen a lot of other planets lost, she had said. She wanted to do good work. Steve respected that, but he couldn’t picture the scenery Tony supplied him with: Carole in a long white dress, Rhodes in his uniform, both of them dancing barefoot on the lawn of the Compound.
“I’m sorry, Mr. Stark, we are under strict orders not to provide alcohol for the rest of your stay.”
“Thank you, I’ll use it later.” Steve’s gaze softens in increments. He’s been glacial since this entire Registration Act bullshit started, since they can’t talk without resorting to unveiled insults or worse, fights that end in cuts and bruises. It’s like watching the ice caps from the mountains melt. It’s a pretty side from a distance. But Tony knows better. Up close, the snow is sludgy revealing patches of land that's covered in grays. He traces the slope of Steve’s face and Tony thinks,
He’s struck with a sudden urge to run along the tracks with them, hop on the boxes and give Kate some pointers on her chin-ups, but he doesn’t. It’s not his place.
Eventually, Steve follows an unpaved path two blocks from the residential area and stumbles upon a creek after circling the vicinity for miles and miles. He’s finally sweating now. His hair, too long and damp, a drop of sweat making a home in his thick beard.
The only bruises he has on his body are self-inflicted. A gauntlet falling over his arms. A hammer falling from the table and onto his foot.
Steve’s the so-called ‘man with a plan,’ but he couldn’t think of a battle strategy to cope with Tony’s condition.
“Yeah, you’d know, wouldn’t you?” He raises an eyebrow. A solider sees another solider. This is familiar. War starts, war ends, the world spins. Soldiers try to adjust. Sometimes they fail.
Tony ignored him, grasping the folder and flipped the crisp pages. Steve trailed off, feeling out of place.
Over a pitcher of cold beer, the man introduces himself as Samuel. He lost his wife to cancer years before the Decimation, and he has lots of opinions on the current state of healthcare system. He finished his plate of cheesy fries and barked out facts about the town. He threw down his hat across the table and refilled their glasses, telling Steve about his only daughter, an adult now, and still alive. She wasn’t lost to the Snap, but one of his grandkids was taken from the Decimation.
“You can. Do it.” Steve eagerly thrusts deeper and deeper, only pulling out to add another finger inside.
“Another intervention,” he said, trying to tone down the accusation in his voice. He sat back on the sofa. Tony used to nap there in the afternoons.
The bruises will fade tomorrow, but the cuts on his thighs will remain for days until they scab over.
Steve knew the signs. He read the stupid pamphets the doctors handed him after every hospital visit. He just wished he didn't have to see it, wished that the inevitable would never come.
Steve is glad that Tony’s sunglasses are perched on top of his head rather than sitting on his face. Under the brightness of the natural light, the lines of Tony’s face are more pronounced, and there’s a tiny freckle that’s appeared at the edge of his cheekbones, close enough to touch the beginning of the goatee.
He shouldn’t be so maudlin. Better to save these thoughts for after—when he’s eventually crawled home, pulled off the scratchy sheets from his bed, and forced himself to sleep.
“Stark,” Natasha calls out, eyes never leaving Verenake. “We could use you during the interrogation.”
someone more than you needed to live? To love someone with your bones and your flesh and all of what makes you who you are and how much of a goddamn happy thing it is when they love you the same way? You can’t get that again, even if you try.”
He can see the man-made lake by the main building. There’s a set of swans, moving to the flow of the water, a perfect picture of calmness.
It’s bare of anything but a bed, a small ensuite bathroom without a door and a television set that’s already on, but muted, playing the news.
He rolls a cigarette, smokes, and lets the sharpness of the tobacco dull the despair sitting on his breastbone.
There's the Metro, but hardly anyone uses it. Steve does, just to see where it goes. It's even more inefficient than the subway lines in New York. Steve uses the money from his pension to purchase a decent car in a lot in his neighborhood and rent a studio room in Koreatown. There are bars on the windows of his apartment building but his neighbors are friendly, if not cautious with their warnings about race wars. He fought a war in another land, then he comes home to find there’s another one.
He flexes his hand against the counter top, keeping his eyes on Tony’s form. The desire to stand behind him, grip his shoulder, and apologize, say a million things, is strong. But it’s a behemoth task, and while Steve’s punched the Red Skull and piloted the Valkyrie, he remains there, unmoving, paralyzed by potential rejection.
Steve inches forward, recognizing the man. He leans over and kisses Tony’s temple. It’s disgusting. His lips are too thin and his teeth are uncharacteristically straight. Tony looks up at him, taps his arm, then leans over to snort a line. Tony comes back up and the woman grabs his face with these hot pink fingernails wiping at the blood on his nose.
Steve slits my throat, just like I wanted, and I smile because I’m wearing Tony’s face as he kills me.
His hands shake, haunted by flesh turning green and the smell of rotting bodies. The pigs snorting in their hogs. “In a moment, Miss Barnes.”
“Can I, please?” Steve fists the base of his cock, trying to stop himself from coming too quick. God, he wishes for a bed. Next time, he promises himself, next time they’ll use a bed and he’ll open Tony up for hours before showing him how loved he is.
There are five pairs of eyes on him, and he almost wants to lecture Natasha about how it’s impolite to throw him here without any back up.
“Still, it’d be better if Rogers was around,” Sheriff Red Wolf says, tone wistful. “I was wrong about him, called him a crazy son of a bitch —”
“Is this the video you’re talking about?” He pointed on the screen. There it was, the sepia tone he’s become familiar with these last 16 hours.
The sun over them, surrounded by flowers. What happened next? Steve would lie Tony down in the patch of grass and fuck him so hard that the flower crown with fall off his head.
Steve licks his lips and raises the mug. “I made coffee,” then, he points to the plate of food, organized in those floral plates Tony doesn’t use. “And, I thought you might want something to eat? You mentioned something about spaghetti yesterday and...and you had the ingredients for a carbonara.” Steve looks away for a beat, then stares at Tony, determined. God, he’ll be weak for this man. “I was going to bring it to you.”
“That you grieve for a man you love,” he replies with a shrug. “That Rogers meant something special.”
Steve didn’t want to say yes and confirm that Tony’s dead. He’s read about it the last few days as if he wasn’t sitting beside his husband in those last moments of his life as if he wasn’t holding Tony’s hand and kissing his cold face all over.
He kept most of the fan mail in his room and hung up his favorites in the office. There’s one letter thanking him, Steve Rogers, not Captain America.
Now, there’s this archive in his brain that reads: TONY STARK, in large, bold letters, and it contains all their memories in a loop. These days, Steve finds himself perusing the most awful ones.
Steve, impatient and hard ever since Tony landed on the roof and took his face plate off, removed his fingers and shoved in.
Tony shifts, feeling the fire in his belly, the swell between his legs, and he’s helpless to stick his hands on the glass window, allowing Steve’s ministrations. He leaves fingerprints on the glass, pressing further forward as Steve snakes the hand from his hip to Tony’s stomach, rubbing, gentle,  checking the forming bruise of where he punched Tony just earlier.
Steve's jaw was clenched and his eyes narrowed. Tony hated how he could be reduced to silence when Steve looked at him. He thought Steve might tackle him down and choke him.
The sun climbs in the sky, the wide azure sky that reminds Tony of Blu’s eyes. There aren’t any clouds; it’s brilliantly blue and wonderfully quiet as if all the birds and insects fall silent in reverence to this moment, Blu’s last moment. “No!” He looks down at Blu whose every breath is tortured, labored. He buries his face in Blu’s fur, the softness, the silkiness against the coarseness of it etch memories into his very skin. His whole body trembles against the inevitable. “Please, you healed before.”
Tony cuts him off with a disparaging laugh. “Don’t go all sentimental on me, Obie, not with that motherfucker.”
“Yes.” He realized he wasn’t lying. For the first time in weeks his dreams hadn’t bothered him. Sitting up, Steve said, “Peggy came to visit me.”
“You were a kid once, Tony.” Steve cocks his eyebrow and then grabs Tony’s hand. “Let’s find out what else the genius doesn’t know about us poor people.” He drags Tony to the exit (with little resistance on the part of the prince). They make their way out of the ship and Steve notices the guards trailing behind them and heading out before them but ignores the entourage. “To the park, my dear prince, if you will point the way to the poor soul who doesn’t normally have such privilege.” He bows to Tony.
“No, we have a plan. We’re going to stick with it.” Tony’s voice shatters. His hands in the massive metal gauntlets feel numb, his breath cold even in the heated armor. “We have a plan.”
Tony claps him on the shoulder. “You will. You always do. I trust you Rhodey. And yes, he’s my husband. Steve Rogers, meet Colonel James Rhodes. Rhodey meet Steve. I like to call him Blu.
“It wasn’t supposed to work this way,” Sam says but he’s not looking at Tony. His arms are crossed over his chest, protective, worried. “It wasn’t supposed to be dangerous.”
Over the course of the morning, Tony and Natasha got Steve to dress and to eat – though only an egg and toast seemed a little too small for a super soldier’s metabolism. Later, Sam reported that Peggy would be interned in England and her funeral would be held in two days’ time. Bruce worked with JARVIS to schedule the private jet and Tony arranged the hotel reservations. Steve went through his daily routine, punching bags, running Central Park, and answering lingering questions about SHIELD’s collapse. On the surface, Steve remained cool and calm, but the storm boiled underneath the surface. He held it back but even when he clearly tried to cut the rest of the pack off with chanting the Mantra, his pain and denial seeped through the links. More often than not, Tony sought him out to try and alleviate it, though he had no idea what to do. Not even his usual resources like Pepper and Rhodey gave him strong direction about what to do and how to handle Steve. Neither of them was part of the pack and didn’t have much understanding on how something like a soul bond worked. In the end he succumbed to asking Strange for help.
“Luke wants to be Jedi like his father,” Steve explains as he sets the huge bowl of popcorn on the table with two bottles of water. “He blows up the Death Star at the end with the help of the cowboy with his dog.”
Steve offers only a weak smile. “Same thing that Nat said. But would I really want to watch it all happen again? No. I thought about it, but I learned too much from Tony Stark to think that if I went back in time I could change enough to save everyone.”
She hopped up on her tiptoes, kissed his cheek, and then opened the door. “You can always ask out your neighbor, Kate, and see how that goes.”
“They took it,” Tony says. “Sorry, I didn’t know what to do with your wounds. I cleaned them out as best I could.”
With a quick kiss, Tony hurries out of the room and heads toward his own room. He knows that in the side pockets of this suitcase or even the toiletry bag he usually has the required lube and condoms. He rips through his case and finds nothing and then moves onto the bathroom where he goes through the toiletry bag. “Got it!” He grabs the lube and packet of condoms and rushes back to the master bedroom only to find it empty.
Before Tony can answer a high wind staggers them and they turn to the darkening skies. The ocean’s once emerald color turns storm grey and then roll of thunder sounds in the sky. On the edge of the horizon, Steve sights the angel – coming toward them. His own wings arch up and around Tony, protective and shielding. They’re coming, the Boundaries are open, and all of Hell may be upon them.
“Steve.” He manages the word, but he wants to say so much more before the end. Steve must go on, must try, must carry the Avengers forward to a new day, to repair the world, the universe. He can’t hide away.
“I can’t fucking believe you!” Tony yells as he watches Steve dismount the bike. He reminds Tony of those old westerns his dad used to watch. He’s a cowboy getting off his horse. He’s all legs and wide shoulders and Tony licks his lips. He’s happy the mask of his helmet conceals his hungry expression.
“It means what’s on the outside. People don’t see beyond the outside. Many people judge books by their covers but that doesn’t mean what’s on the outside tells you what’s on the inside. Does?” Maria asked.
Tony seems all the weaker the more time goes by, his body limp and pliant in Steve’s slowly thawing fingers. Luckily the cabin is small enough that the fire begins to warm it in minutes. Tony jerks under Steve’s ministrations, his eyes dull and unfocused.
“Fuck,” he says and goes to his rooms. He feels like for years he’s been battling within himself. Good and evil. Is he of two minds melded into one? He doesn’t know. He needs to find out who Tony Stark is. Is he the dom alpha who only wants people to bow at his feet? Or is he the alpha who would change the worlds?
He blinks and sees that Sam is still holding him. He wants to tell Sam to go, that he’ll be all right but he’s suddenly too cold to think. He wants to see Peggy again, but instead it is Bucky – but not as he is today but when they were growing up.
Frigga only purses her lips in reply and ushers them back into the house. “We have much planning to do.”
As he ponders his choices, Steve says, “I’ll stay. You don’t really want me to come with you. I can stay and watch over it.”
Redwing flies out of sight and Bucky doesn’t admit that he panics for a moment. Sam lives and breathes around that bird. Even as he confronts yet another gang of troopers and they try to shepherd him toward – who know what – he still worries about the bird. Yet he needs to concentrate his energy on the soldiers swarming around him. He takes the first two out easily enough with his blaster, but the second two take cover and that means there’s going to be a prolonged shoot out that Bucky cannot afford. The longer he stays in one place the higher the probability he will be captured. That’s not happening, not when he’s as close as he is to rescuing Steve.
Natasha ran for it, scooping it up and sending it through the darkness. The blast ricocheted into their space-time sending everyone down, with the gurney toppling over and Steve slamming into the floor with a thud. Tony scrambled up at the same time several of the agents in the elevator surged forward. The gunfire pinged off the overturned gurney and both Clint and Steve huddled behind it. Tony scooted away from the barrage. Natasha’s working of the space-time continuum offered them a dark shade to afforded them some protection. The air felt thicker as if they moved in a viscous fluid. He shot a glance over to Natasha, huddled by the wall working the dimensions, curving space-time around them.
“You’re part of a pack now, Bucky.” Steve jumped up as if commanding the room would allow him to control the situation. “As part of the pack, we can help stabilize you. We can do these things now. You should have been there when Clint -.” He stopped. “The one with the bow?” Bucky nodded and gestured for him to move on. “Clint was nearly comatose, and we brought him back. Bruce healed him, and I was there. It was phenomenal. We can heal you, I know we can.”
“I represent that,” Logan says and gives him a wolfish look. Why isn’t he called Wolfman? Was that already taken? Logan is positively buzzing with excitement. Tony hates him for it, hates everything about it. If they succeed – and Tony knows he will since apparently he’s already succeeded once – then Logan wins the romance battle. Tony loses. He loses his future. A man he would love so much that he would commit his life to.
“You may.” He smirks at her. As Rhodey and Happy stand off to the side, Tony leans over the high counter. “I don’t want it to get out just yet because it was a fast romance and all, but – you see -.” He throws a glance at Rhodey. “He’s my husband.”
“Lots of them.” Steve turned then, not wanting Tony to see his eyes as he spoke. “I went into art instead of something that would put food on the table. I foolishly thought dreams came true.” He laughed then, a hard rock on his chest. “Then Bucky went off to war and I literally couldn’t feed myself. I had too many meds to take and had to make a choice.”
“You have to, Sweet Pea, his life depends on it,” Tony says as they sit in a conference room after Tony declared that Stark Industries would no longer be manufacturing weapons. The place is a nuthouse and he should help Stane. Right now, he couldn’t give a crap, he’s made his decision and he needs to find someone who will go back for Steve.
“Prison level?” Pepper asked, and Tony shuffled his feet. She didn’t know just how horrible Howard actually was.
“We got only the shield you made me and your gauntlet. That’s going to have to be enough,” Steve says and berates himself mentally for leaving the storage closet.
Her eyes glint at Clint and she says, “Thanks Hawk, I’ll take it from here. Can you hunt down Thor? I think he might be doing another Dose run for the girls. I told him not to.”
Instead of waiting to find anything more out, Steve reached out within the bond – the bond he was supposed to have with Clint and found a tattered thread. The tendrils reached out as if in fog to an unseen shore. Through the bond he felt the vibrations of anger and pain and something more insidious – something Steve knew too well – isolation. He focused his attention on Cho. “I need to see him. Now. He needs my help.”
.  Maybe his luck is changing. He scans the cityscape; it’s hard on the eyes, the glare and glint of metal and steel. It sets his heart fluttering rapidly. He gulps a few times and then smiles. How can this all be his? He presses a hand to the window.
“So does Natasha,” Steve said. He didn’t take no for an answer, he wouldn’t be rejected. He kept at it, trying to grasp Tony through the astral dimension.
“This isn’t the way to get a college degree Tony.” He’s saying one thing but doing the complete opposite. He’s got Tony turned around, standing facing the desk, jeans tugged down around his knees.
That night, Tony watched in silent joy as Steve descended into bliss that only Tony’s words gave him. The power of a Submissive lie in their capitulation, the power of a Dominant lie in their compassion. Tony protected Steve as he lingered in subspace and he loved every moment of it.
Steve leaves the safety of staring at his empty hands to look up at Tony. He finds a certain sadness echoed in Tony; this is a gift to Steve – this truth etched in Tony’s expression. “What truth?”
“Don’t see how,” Steve says as he carefully positions the cup at Bucky’s mouth while holding his head in place. Bucky sips the liquid and cringes.
Steve rubs his hand along Tony’s thigh, calming him and then pushes in. At first it hurts, there’s resistance and pressure. “Breath, Tony. Push a little it will help.”
“What?” Steve says as he steps out of the elevator and heads toward the kitchen. “You thought I’d get disgusted with the thought of the media pairing me up with you?” His voice is lighter than Tony would have assumed. “Nope. I’m bi. My fiancé knew it and she had no problem with it. If anything, Tony, I’m flattered.”
“Shit!” Steve reached for Tony as he shifted away on the bed. “I’m sorry. That was insensitive of me. God, Tony. I didn’t mean anything by it.” The idea that he would joke about the torture that Tony had gone through repulsed him.
“Barely any flying at all. I have some launch work done but not the maneuvering or the landing. It’s be damned dangerous,” Tony calls out. He lifts his armored hand. “Over there.”
“Whoa, what’s that about? Don’t tell me you’re some weird ghost or something. Fuck, don’t tell me I’m like in a coma or something. Are they torturing me and I’m hallucinating dead war heroes. Why would I hallucinate dead war guys?” Tony scrubs at his face and then blinks a few times at Steve.
“There’s no time, Tony. We can shower together, later.  I’m going to my quarters and I need to get dressed as well. You got half of your snacks all over me.” Steve looks down at his shirt with the prince’s fingerprints all over it. It will be a wonder if they keep out of the news-vids.
She folded her hands into the opposite sleeves of her robe. "Yes the great Service Order of the Jedi has been besmirched by the evil doings of the dead Emperor. I cannot have what's left of us be turned."  She stood looking out upon the twisted branches to the far below shipyard and dock.
“On a space station? Isn’t that a wasteful use of water?” The more Steve lives out of the Beyonds, the more he realizes the rest of the Conclave really hasn’t a clue how hard life actually is.
Steve read some of the stories about Howard and Tony’s relationship. “Did you argue over how to deal with the Conclave?”
Steve took in a breath, held it to calm himself, sent out the Mantra in a cooling wave, and then said, “Is Sam around?”
Steve nods silently. Dinner is a quiet affair. Tony tells Steve about where Stark Industries is headed next and that he’s dissembling the Iron Legion. Too many variables leave it as a liability rather than an asset. They also touch upon the idea of a shield around the world. Steve’s not sold on the idea, and Tony worries it might fall into the wrong hands at one time or another.
The army floods the plains around the fortress and Bucky has no other choice but to call on Sam for assistance. He can't get to the ramp way into the fortress without over a dozen Skull troopers spotting him. He could take out half but then the others would most certainly kill him.
“And I could starve to death too. That’s always a fun thought.” He reaches to Tony and clasps his hand. “You want to go shopping. Let’s go shopping.”
His outfit mimics his colors, red, white, and blue. But it reminds Tony of that uniform Steve had when the Chitauri and Loki attacked. Steve lifts his shield. “Let’s go sledding.”
Blu only huffs and watches with those intensely blue eyes. It’s disconcerting that the lion eases Tony’s troubled soul. Only hours ago, Blu terrified him, but now the lion sits like an expectant pet waiting for dinner.
They maneuvered the gurney down the stretch of the corridor until they ended up outside one of the prison cells. Ross waited for the V-Corps agent stationed outside the prison cell door to key in the code and then he stepped into the dark room. Everyone except the guard outside the door followed him.
Biology. The theories and ideas have been ingrained in him since he was a child. He understands the differences of the alpha caste, the beta caste, and the omega caste. He also comprehends the subsets. Being a Prime Alpha, like Tony is, happens to be rare and very much sought after, so much so that during the last century the Alpha Wars broke out and nearly decimated most of the human worlds. At the time genetics had been used to ensure alpha lineages and beta lineages as well as warrior omega and drone omega lineages. It is said that the drone omega had been created at that time. The warping the genetics of the caste system led to affects that couldn’t be predicted. So many of the alphas turned to insanity. Too many of the omegas ended up in berserker rages. When the dust settled only truly untouched Alphas were allowed, no genetic manipulation. Omegas had been divided into classes, while Betas were fine. Warriors took their place alongside alphas while drones went to the blocks.
Yet, they have their detractors. Multiple groups protest the clinical trial from those who say it’s making people into cyborgs (Steve can’t believe how naïve and uneducated people can be) to those who call Tony an ableist because he won’t accept his blindness. The latter one is the hardest of all for Tony to handle. He knows he dealt with his blindness in a way others would call shunning the community, pretending he wasn’t blind. All of which he admits to now. But 15 years after the accident, Tony has a right to say he wants his sight back and be truthful about it. What Steve’s learned over the years as a sighted person living with a blind person is that it isn’t his place to decide what is best for Tony – the only person who can decide that is Tony.
Steve swallows hard and nods. Thankfully, she dismisses herself and then Steve’s able to collapse on the bed. Part of the Fleet. Tony’s idea. He mulls it over and he can only come up with one conclusion – Tony likes him. He wants to present him as part of his crew. Steve can’t help himself from swooning.
Tony stood up and dusted off his jeans. He glanced around the room, peering out the windows. The windows were glass so maybe it wasn’t middle age construction. It was decidedly cold in the room and Steve couldn’t find one modern fixture – nothing to indicate it had any kind of heating system, except for the fireplace. The place – or wood cabin (because that’s what it seemed to be) – was a single room with a stone fireplace, a stool near the fireplace, a kettle and a pot sat on the floor, and a bed or what could be both a bed and a place to sit.  That was tucked in the one corner of the room. The door to the outside opened to what looked like a mountain wilderness with a substantial amount of snow all around them. Neither of them were dressed for a march down the mountain side. Spotting a pile of chopped wood to the side of the cabin, Steve hurried out, gathered some, and brought an arm load into the cabin.
“Mainly technical drawing. We did projects for drafting communication devices like phones and computers, but also more advanced engineering projects. I did one on solar panels and on a Bugatti. We used a lot of computer graphics in that class. So, it really led nicely into the digital art classes I took.” Steve falls silent as Tony gazes at him.
But then horrible life got in the way. He ended up in California for two weeks and all he could think of was getting back to New York City. Stane noticed, and the results turned ugly when Obie's answer to 'fix' Tony had been to have a private dinner with some very high prices sex workers. The women had been beautiful, but Tony couldn't stomach it. He'd played the part brought the leggy blonde to his room in the hotel instead of his home.
“That’s not the end of the story, but the coffee is in that one,” Steve says and points. “Give me a cup, please. So, how’d you get back here so soon? Did you have to go through all the rims? How’d you bring my backpack with you?”
as someone less. He discriminated against himself. Told himself, he is less because he cannot see. Never in all the years before the accident had Tony ever considered the idea of being below average, less.
“Estane?” A plate is given to Steven, though he doesn’t have the variety of foods that Tony has been afforded; there’s still plenty. It is a simpler fare since even though he’s part of the executive branch, he’s still an omega and by definition a servant. Steven has porridge, fruit, and fresh bread. A mug of coffee is also offered to him which he accepts.
“You’re sure this will work? We’ve tried several other vampires. None of their glands were affected at all.” Ross glowered at them.
The tension running through Steve’s body flexes his hands as Tony grips them. “You know what you need? A good sparring match. How about it? You and I. We could spar a little, you could get used to the body?”
He jolts awoke, panting. The sun is still high and the heat of the day has begun to settle over their small town. He presses the heels of his hands into his eyes and sits up, swinging his legs over the bed. Bending over he breathes in and out, trying to wrestle with the horror of his memories more so than the terror of his nightmares.
The guy comes back with a boat load – he starts handing them to Tony. At first Tony tries to get him to set them on the table but that’s not happening and Tony concedes to just grabbing all of the boxes and bottles. After the guy finishes dumping the first aid into the cradle of Tony’s arms, he says, “Take good care of him. He deserves it. God knows, he takes care of our sorry asses.”
“Hello, Tony,” he parrots back and something inside of him bursts open. It isn’t an ember of hope, but a conflagration.
Tony stands up and shakes his head. “No. I’ll get dressed but you stay here. I need you to rest. Whether you want to admit it or not, you’ve been through an ordeal. I’d like to know you’re safe and well-rested.”
“Yeah, I suppose,” Steve said and mummed up about his own belief system. He grew up in a different time, but his mom spent hours teaching him about right and wrong. One of the things she implored him to take to heart was that vampires weren’t a different version of human. They weren’t even technically dead. They were just transformed. He had no idea why his mom pushed the idea. But he accepted it.
Tony shakes his head. He’s actually heard of Hank Pym and his wife, Jan. Jan ran in the same circles Tony did growing up. She was a renowned fashion designer with a head for advanced technology. It didn’t surprise him when they hooked up and started the tech company. Sure, she still dabbled in fashion design and her creations wowed Paris every few years, but her heart seemed to be tethered to high technology advancements.
“A vow that I made under duress. The thought of losing my most faithful servant to a sinful Revelation-.”
They’d come so close to finding a way out of the mess, so close. But then Tony called Wanda a weapon of mass destruction. And Steve had gotten so angry. Then Tony said it and it ripped Steve apart.
Steve growls and shuns the voice mocking him in his head. His muscles strain and his face feels the pounding warmth of pain and a new flush of agony. He eyes the next crossroads – a left and right turn – he needs to jump over the wall. It’s at least ten feet high. Adding a bounce to his stride he preps and then heaves, leaping high and clearing the wall easily, rolling to stop on the other side but then colliding with a metal boot.
“We’d better head out. There's an old miner’s cabin across the river we can set down in before night fall.”
“I can answer it. Of course I can answer it,” Steve says. He grits his teeth because this is not what he wanted, why he sacrificed his gland. “I wanted to give you the freedom to start again. I was – am – willing to do that for you. This wasn’t a cry for help. It was an act of kindness. Of course, I love you. There’s no question. But I’m not the right omega for you and that’s a different thing, isn’t it?”
“Any luck getting into the security system?”  Steve yelled to Tony over the cacophony of helicopter blades above and gunfire at ground level.
“Well, don’t worry about it too much. He’s leaving for DC soon,” Tony said and he stood up. He didn’t need to sit here and listen to this crap. This “let’s all get along” shit. Although he knew that Bruce hadn’t said anything about that at all. What Bruce said only served to open up the idea of sympathy and maybe a little pity for the Grandpa Hero.
“I’m good, I’m fine,” he said and shook his head. “Actually I’m less than fine. I need to know something Rhodey.”
He dressed quickly - jeans, blue t-shirt, white tube socks - and then he tied on sneakers. He didn’t really like sneakers, but Natasha got him to wear them more often than not these days. When he reached out to her through the soul bonds now, he got a disconnected feeling as if the soul bond stretched and thinned. He hated the feel of it and tried to reel her back in, even after his near breakdown in the shower. He might think of the soul pack as something of a curse at times, but the truth of the matter was they were his family as well as his team. He groaned. Of course, Sam would be pissed at him. God, he needed to get his damned head on straight.
“Yes, so am I,” Steve returns. Vision has left the kitchen as they work silently side by side. She asks a few questions about his recipe for hot chocolate, but mostly she keeps to herself as she scrambles the eggs and adds a salt and pepper to season. She’s busy with the bacon when Vision yells from upstairs.
“Fuck! Fucking stop!” Rumlow raged. He bashed his closed fist against the side of Steve’s head, but it did nothing to deter him. Steve bit down harder; the crunch of bones against his molars only served to encourage him. Skin tore in his mouth even as Rumlow punched him in his abdomen, where the nanobots where burning him from the inside. Steve hung on as tears streamed down his face, but he thought of Tony, alone on the roof, splayed out and crucified.
“Oh, are you?” She had always been the hardest nut to crack. She wasn’t showing any fault lines now. “Is that why you called out the Mandarin all on your own and ended up with a pile of rubble in the Pacific Ocean?” She hadn’t taken a seat.
“Why shouldn’t I? And I told you, I think you needed help. The Tony Stark that went into the cave isn’t the same Tony Stark that came out. And unless someone cloned you somewhere in the wilds of Afghanistan, I think someone helped you, changed you.” Pepper gives a small shrug of her shoulders. “I watch and know you a lot better than most do, even Mister Stane.”
“He escaped from your gulag and went on the run?” Tony asked and the idea of a man so desperately pained and lost running from shadows both imagined and real hurt deep inside. That’s when Tony realized it – knew that he still loved, that he still cared even after all the time that had past.
Finally he gets one of the wires twisted onto the node and then start to work the other one as well as the wind blasts him in the face. He glances at Tony, sees the droplets of water in his hair turning to ice. “Damn it.”
“Maybe he doesn’t,” Nat said. “Look at the data, you’ll see. He deserves to have the chance to get back at them.”
“Yes, I accept the calls. Time Delay?” Steve asks. He wants to know if it will be a live discussion or if he’s just going to get an update from his friend.
“And he can’t do it without his friends,” Rhodes returns. “Say hello to him. It will make him feel better after everything that’s happened. He needs to know you’re here.”
The scarlet flames engulfed the train as the other passengers sobbed for help. He raced to retrieve his shield yet never got there. The side of the train, the actual metal of it, peeled back, screeching as it did. The flares of red energy licked at the sides and then pierced it, opening it like a tin can. Steve grabbed at his bag, but before he could free his shield the searing red energy reached out, away from the metal and, instead, wound around him. It neither burned nor froze, yet every nerve of his body protested, screamed in agony. His core, his soul came alive bright with white blinding light. He couldn’t control it.
Unimpressed by Steve’s stoic response, Ross walked up to him and smiled. “I’m not going to do that. You see, you’re much more important to me than that.” He placed a finger on Steve’s side, close to his injury. Steve hung there, frozen as Ross glided his hand around on his torso. “Human perfection. That’s what they called you, you know. Perfection, so beautiful and so profoundly wrong.” His finger touched the injury and Steve bit back a hiss of pain. It should have been healed by now. It was only a stab wound. Throughout his years in the war and as a V-Corps agent, he’d suffered worse. Ross eyed him and then pushed his finger in slowly. “He must have drunk excessively from you for it not to heal.” He cocked an eyebrow as he watched Steve try and remain passive to the probing in his wound. Steve held back any sound, any cry of pain. “It’s the serum that must have drove him to drink so much. How did you manage for so many years? So many, many years?”
He starts to eat, because he wants to understand why Stark is here more than anything, and what an unconventional life means.
Steve curses himself- when others of the hierarchy appear he should keep watch – it always means bad news. The main leader of the terrorists comes in with a number of his henchmen.
“I went ahead and added a plate of your favorite pasta, boss,” Vision says. “Well, Wanda did. She didn’t think a bowl of soup would be enough for Captain Rogers.”
He thumbs it over his shoulder. “Empty rooms back there. I think we have to follow the main corridor and see where he’s leading us.”
Ultron’s playing with his food again. That much is obvious. His food is brain games, and what other way to play with Steve than to make it a physical chore. Everyone always thinks that Steve is nothing but the muscle of the group anyhow. First things, first, he needs to climb out of this well and find out what Ultron has cooked up for him now. With a swing of his legs he manages to leverage his feet against the wall. Gripping the chains holding him in the well, Steve begins his ascent. It’s easier than simply climbing the chain. The wall is slippery but easy enough to balance against with his barefeet. His muscles strain against the pull and heave of the climb. It makes him wonder at the virtual reality. How everything feels so real but at the same time still oozes with non-reality. The periphery blurs out when he’s not looking at it directly. It’s clear that Ultron may have invaded the internet, but it overwhelms his capacity. Steve files that away for use later as he grits his teeth.
Steve stayed quiet during most of the rest of the flight. While they didn’t hold hands the entire way, Steve seemed to take comfort in Tony remaining close to him. The bond spoke to Tony in ways it never had in his experience. Between them the link grew and warmed – Tony found that he liked it, and even more so he discovered his soul craved the contact, both physical and metaphysical. He watched Steve for any sign that he might be experiencing the same thing.
“Might be a good time to engage,” Iron Man answered. “JARVIS has clustered the civilians near the Legion in the outer meadow. Looks like we have hostiles and civilian signatures as their shield.”
That got his attention completely, and he balled up the holographic projects and tossed them to the save folder. “What? JARVIS didn’t report anything to me.”
True enough, Tony’s phone chirped and the message came through to him. Tony glared at the phone as if it betrayed him. He shouldn’t have agreed, but as he considered sending a message back to decline, Pepper walked into the lab.
Tony has the scarf pulled up over his mouth but he nods and concentrates on the path, keeping an eye out for the horse’s footing. It gets uglier as they get closer to the water. The rock gets slippery with moss and old vegetation.  He needs to have the horses go single file, so he turns and gives the reins back to Tony.
“Yes, I got that.” He had wanted to wring the guy’s neck. For ages he had been invading Tony’s space.  Was he waiting for some kind of medal or thank you for being a bug in Tony’s ear all the time?
"You fixed old Betsy!" Mrs. Fury declares and hugs him tightly to her over abundant chest. He pats her back and then says
She lifts a shoulder and then consider his idea. “Maybe. We don’t know. All we really know is that this is the Soul Stone’s Realm. I died -.”
“Fell right down during one of the shows in Buffalo. The handler, my handler said it was part of the act. It wasn’t - my blood sugar must have been low or something.” He digs into his food again.
“Not sure I want little robots in my body,” Steve mutters but then realizes what he’s just said and to whom he just said it. The prince has an armor that he stores in his body, somehow due to his augmentations. He scrabbles. “No offense, of course.”
“No!” Tony jumps up. Now he needs to pace, to move around. This is getting to the nitty gritty of the problem. Anytime Tony’s close to a breakthrough, the energy bubbling through his nerves needs releasing. He has to move. “It’s not like it’s something I bring up when we’re – you know – romancing. In fact, he spends a lot of time asking me about things. About my work, about deep space exploration. Who knew Captain America was a science nerd?”
Tony cradled Steve against his chest. What could he say? He had resented Steve for saying the things he had – deviant, wrong. But then again, had he even considered Steve’s upbringing? Had he even considered that the world that Steve understood and the environment he’d grown up in had been less evolved – if that was the way to put it. “It’s okay.” Was it? Tony thought it was. Normally Tony would tease and extract some amount of apology – more than what Steve had offered. But the fact was that he didn’t want that – he wanted what they had in this moment. He wanted it forever. “It’s okay. You get a pass. You get a do over.” Making the moment light might not be the best avenue to take but the intensity might drive Tony into an early grave from a heart attack.
“Survey. I can survey but not much more. Like I told you the maneuvering is off and the landing a bitch,” Tony says. He powers up the armor. “Stand clear, this baby isn’t certified safe.”
He waves at her and wanders to the line of cells that are empty. Three of the cells are dark and the computer readout states that the cells do not contain omegas. The fourth one is dark as well but it states it contains an omega.
“When you get to recovery.” Cho pats his shoulder as they move him from the table to the gurney. His body feels like gelatin. The weakness pervades every muscle, every joint. He feels numb all over and barely attached to his body.
“The last known location of the lion was reported to be outside of Kunduz on the border near Tajikistan. The Lion Hunter has a stronghold in the area. Local warlords have been attacking the stronghold over the last fortnight to no avail.”
“This is artificial human blood,” Natasha replied as she worked to set up the i.v. line. “Helen Cho – you know the head of the Asian coven that you contacted without telling me – she formulated it. I only have a few experimental batches for emergencies.” She threaded the needle into Steve’s vein on his hand much to his protests. She ignored him completely. “Doesn’t work as a good substitute for human blood for us, but it works – well, kind of works – for situations like these. She’s still perfecting it.” Natasha rigged the bag up to the headboard. She glared at them. Steve with the blankets tucked around him and the tray on his lap of raw meat and Tony in his father’s robe, and she shook her head. “Get some rest. Then we must have a discussion on our next steps. I want all the information you can supply me, Rogers. All of it.”
He loops the ship toward the planet but then at the last minute pulls up. Few could outmaneuver Clint's flying skills. Sam whoops in the background as Bucky clings to the rail. He only wants to get there. The intelligence that they received from the bounty hunter, the Black Widow, carved terror into Bucky's chest like a serrated knife, jagged and torn. She'd told them that within the Gavinian system, the sixth planet from the twin stars, had hanging over it a large structure as big as the Death Stars of old, but there was something different about this space station. It wasn't round like a planetoid. It was a multiplex station like a an insect hive. Complex and interwoven on purpose. To ensure safety and security.
Strange concentrates on the small laptop computer but then switches the feed over to a large monitor on the side counter. Tony hops off the table and stands at the monitor, studying it. Steve can tell it’s a series of graphs with information about whatever virotherapy is. He’s learned quite a lot in the last few days, but his knowledge isn’t this deep. He steps to the side so he can watch and listen but stay out of the way. Strange doesn’t react to his attention, his focus is only on Tony.
Tony’s stomach growls loud and insistent. “Great! You ate all the rabbit. Maybe save some for your doctor.”
He thinks of the lion, beaten and bruised. King of the beast and a cowering in a dark cave. He glances down at the battery clutched to his chest, the wires hanging – a lifeline. He sees the burning sands of an unforgiving country and he knows the future.
Steve rattles the manacle attached to his wrist and then lifts his hand to his mouth or would if the chain allowed him. It comes up short. He can't reach his mouth with either of his hands. He's been dependent on the Red Skull to find the mercy to feed him over the past year and a half.
Bruce silently agreed and heaved one of the coolers out of the SUV. He followed Tony up the front steps. They were greeted by Tony’s former security guard who had become Tony’s point man on everything secure and stable for the coven, though technically Happy stilled worked for the company. Happy would conceal the vehicle in the underground garage. “I’ll get that, boss. You and Bruce just get to your rooms. The shutters are all closed, and the house darkened for you.”
“It depends on what the truth is. It is not generally believed that Icarus flew too close to the sun in reality.”
Tony only nods to that proclamation. Whatever. He hadn’t even known. What kind of husband doesn’t know their mate’s actual sex?  He forces the analytical brain to the forefront again. “How long will the surgery take?”
“Yeah, that is not a nice smell at all,” Rumlow said. “Image what it smells like on the roof right about now.”
He strokes his cock without finesse. He’s fierce and hard and he wants to find relief. But Tony’s watching him, and he’s never done this so blatantly, so wantonly in front of someone. He closes his eyes as the embarrassment flushes over him, but he wants it so much he cannot stop.
“That’s because you’ve consumed about a dozen cups of coffee, two Mountain Dews, and I think too many 5 hour energy drinks that might just cause your heart to explode.” Steve yawns. “Can I go and get a shower, at least?”
Placing the chair back in the stack, Steve went to the semi-circle and sat down. Cross legged was something that he couldn’t achieve but he did his best. He wondered if they were going to meditate. He’d spent some time reading up on meditation techniques so he would understand what Bruce was doing to quiet the Hulk. As far as he knew from Bruce, it worked wonders.
His hand shaking, Steve hits the implant one last time. “Query, is James Buchanan Barnes’ status official or unknown?”
“I didn’t expect this. I didn’t know I could do this,” Steve said. “I wasn’t planning on it. Not today. I thought maybe sometime in the distant future. I thought it was wrong for so long.”
"You said that," Steve replies and thinks he might be lost, he might surrender every part of himself that he normally keeps so reserved and closed inside. Steve breaks away, folding his hands in his lap. He cannot do this, it isn't right.
“Four fines since we left the match. Can I have another word, please?” Tony asks as he watches Steve packing his clothes.
“Yeah I got that,” Steve says. He falls silent and Tony knows why. This isn’t supposed to be about Tony and his blindness, this – this was about their escape, about acknowledging who they are to one another. Is it just boss and Personal Assistant or something more? Steve clears his throat. “Really your tux is ruined.”
The world whited out before him as sounds transformed from screaming to a brutal, guttural growl. Spittle had splattered across his face as he struggled against the metal hand clamped around his throat, threatening to crush his trachea. He could barely make a sound. He gasped for air but the maniac holding him down never ceased. His eyes were an inferno of anger, his face a grimace of loathing. He was hell bent on killing Tony.
Lightly, Steve strokes his hands through Tony’s hair. Using both of his hands, his fingers trail over and over again through Tony’s hair. He rubs with the softest of touches as he massages Tony’s scalp and then places fingers at Tony’s temples and under his eyes.
Tony paled but his hands stayed on Steve as if to lose contact might mean he would sail away in the wind. “Shaken. That was fucking weird. How did you do that?” His tone was light, but his expression was anything but – the levity drawn out by the monumental moments.
Lurching out of the bed, Bucky leaps on him using his knees to pin Steve to the floor. He releases Steve only for a second but then something inside, some horrible nightmare whispers to him and he punches Steve, clocking him right in the chin with enough force to snap his head back. The hysterical look in his friend’s eyes tells Steve that whatever Bucky is seeing isn’t here, isn’t today.
Glancing around the room, his focus stopped at the man with the ridiculous cape and medallion around his neck. He considered the man and then went back to Fury. “You keep saying that, but all I can figure is that the future kind of went a little off its rocker.”
Suddenly, Steve finds his breakfast fascinating. “Yeah. I know. I saw.”  With that pronouncement he falls silent.
Here the story diverges as he learns of his Rebirth and how he transformed into the powerhouse knight he is today. Strong, superior, but always a little off, always questioning if he was doing the right thing. That again is alien to him. Since he woke in the Realm, lost in a forest as a boy, he never asked a question. He found he couldn’t once the Soul Keeper found him and bound him to the Realm’s soul.
Gathering himself and wiping away his tears, Steve straightens his shoulders and tells JARVIS to remove the starfield holograph. The room plunges back to normal and then Steve nods for JARVIS to allow Pepper entrance. He gets up to greet her. She’s carrying a garment bag and another small purse.
On the other hand, Bruce looked like he was in deep conversation with himself or maybe the other guy – who knew. Bruce – his science buddy and friend – kept his opinions to himself. But his eyes when they met Tony’s were soft and sympathetic. He would get it. Tony had no idea if Bruce was Dom or Sub or Neutral. But the man had a raging beast inside of him, and he had to understand that each and every one of them presented a face to the world, and that face only a select few would ever see. Bruce wasn’t the problem.
He suffers a whine and tries to suppress it. She brings a cloth to his ravaged wings and dabs at the torn flesh, the ragged feathers.
He removes his hat and duster and hands them to Jarvis, who smiles and leads him into the parlor. The room is cozy and well appointed with a thick rug on the floor, chairs by the fireplace, and small table near the chairs. There’s a writing desk set by the window with a glass lamp on it. Tony is there, in a smoking jacket and dark silk pants, sitting in one of the cushioned chairs at the fireplace. He smiles when Steve arrives. “I missed you today” He stands and looks healthier, stronger than he has in the recent days.
He hurries his pace as he pushes backward, and then pulls forward. Hours ago the alpha placed a ring on his cock and then hooked it with a chain to a collar around his neck. Any time he wants he can yank on it, drawing the noose tighter and causing the merest bit of friction to send hot shudders through his cock. He feels the hot semen flood into him and he cannot stop himself. He pulls up, tensing his neck muscles to get the barest jolt to his cock – just as he does, the alpha behind him wraps a hand around his heavy cock, stroking it. Steve works into the hand, and it’s just right, just perfect. He wants so badly to come. It’s been days on the edge. With his heat burning through him, his nerves on fire, he sobs with it. His cries come in small whimpers as he rubs into the clenched fist.  He doesn’t know if he can hold it back, but the ring around him constricts and he mourns and wants only to weep for reprieve.
Tony spins on his heels and there’s Steve, walking up the pathway from the damaged and shattered Avengers compound. But this isn’t the Steve who left the platform only minutes ago. This Steve is older – slightly. He’s hair is a mess; he has a beard. His uniform shows its age. It’s tattered and old.
Tony grimaced at him and he shut up. He hadn’t, in fact, really noticed until the catastrophes started to occur on a weekly basis.  He questioned what the hell was going on, but he had no inkling that a super virus named Ultron that they defeated months ago had been the culprit. None of them did. Ultron finally announced himself and ransomed peace of mind for power. The world took notice and put them, the Avengers, on notice. They didn’t have much time to clean up their mess before the United States Army stormed the gates. They had to capture and destroy Ultron or the very idea of the Avengers was dead in the water.
Tony stared at the offered hand. In so many ways the room around Steve vibrated. The differences solidified around him.  In any dream, Tony would take Steve’s hand, hold it, maybe bring it to his lips. Kiss, and then it would lead to touch, and a caress, and more. Steve found himself holding his breath both hungering for Tony to touch his hand and dreading it all the same. For some reason, Steve could both convince himself that he was in a dream and that the reality around him had substance.
Tony takes in the sight before him – how the rest of his family, his clan, literally sank into their seats. They melt with exhaustion and their eyes are dull with the relief of finally going home. But Steven is still working, still watching and protecting. He’s not only on watch as Tony’s protector but he’s also securing the clan. As an alpha Tony has the urge to lead, to bring together those coalitions, to see the future and shape it. For the first time, Tony can see and understand how an omega reacts and acts in a situation. As Tony is compelled to shoulder the responsibility of seeing his clan through the future, Steven is just as compelled to protect and serve. It’s written in his genes, in the code of his life.
"Don't know," the man who fiddles with his zipper says. "You think we should do this? You know what it's all about. We should call in it."
Protests die on his lips as he falls deeply to sleep. When he wakes, Steve’s surprised that he even slept at all. When he was first injured, his asthma attacks ended with him in the hospital, but lately they have been far apart and few. He glances around the room and sees that the light is different – he must have slept for hours. Tony’s sitting next to him with a book in his lap and his hands on the book. Steve shifts and sits up.
The Plexiglas doors to his workshop slid open and Steve entered with a file folder tucked under his arm. At first sight, he looked no different than he did yesterday afternoon, but on closer inspection, Tony glimpsed the lines of exhaustion on his face. He even detected a hint of sadness the way he held his shoulders and the slight down turn of his mouth.
The words were distant and frightened. Some part of his brain knew that Steve called out to him, begged him to hear. Some part of him felt the bonds – the Beloved bond – snap taut and vibrate with energy. He ignored it because there was a hole in his chest a mile wide and his life poured out and died again as if he was seventeen and learning his parents were gone.
When Steve looked up, Tony’s mouth was agape in astonishment. “You mean to tell me it was like an internal radar?”
“Well you need to suffer, considering,” Tony said and tried to walk away. But his pride and his excitement just wouldn’t let him leave it like that. Spinning on his heels, he raised his eyebrows and said, “I didn’t tell you but a certain Captain of all that is Spangley thinks he might be attracted to the same sex.”
“One thing,” Tony says. He grabs Steve’s shirt and pulls him down, smashing his lips against his mouth. It’s messy and painful but then it transforms into a lightning rod of hunger sizzling through him, sparking wants and needs he long ago condemned. He wants to forget everything else, the pain, the agony, the guilt of what he’s done and just stay with in Tony’s arms. This could be his heaven. He could ignore all the strange world around him and just stay with Tony.
“This all sounds a little fishy to me,” Steve says and pushes the blankets down. He’s naked and he flips the blanket back. “Can a man have some privacy?”
Steve cranks his neck to meet Tony’s gaze. “Why do you say that?” They shift around so that they are facing one another.
“Damn,” Tony said and dried quickly. He knew that as a younger vampire he required more rest, but Natasha should know better regarding Steve’s health. He dressed and headed to the kitchen. He passed the Security Center. It was in the east wing of the house. Happy sat in the center with Clint hanging to the side of the room. The room harbored some of Tony’s most extensive and creative technological advancements. He worked hard to make the safe house a haven of security measures and the center reflected that fact. Surrounding Happy’s console, multiple holographic screens could be called up and manipulated. Sensors from visual to audio to tactical fed into the console and were constantly analyzed by JARVIS. Tony stopped only to greet Happy and to check on the status of his sanctuary. How safe it still was.
“Oh you have no idea,” Tony muttered. “I cannot believe it. It’s fucking fantastic. You gotta understand Steve – this is like nothing I’ve ever felt before.”
The prince places his hands on the keys. The silence grows. The weight of the cock on Steve’s tongue anchors him. In an abrupt explosion the music sings through the room. It thunders through chords and octaves. Tony uses the whole keyboard like he’s possessed, and Steve finds himself sucking and swallowing in time with the music. Tony keeps his hips absolutely still. He moans as he follows the course of the music, every now and then he tosses his head back and cries out with uncontained want. It’s enough that Steve’s own body vibrates with the music. His abused cock perks up with interest and he moans against Tony’s erection.
Tony bites back the words again and grumbles a fuck you at Steve. He simply ignores Tony’s protests. “After you.”
He pushed the idea out of his head and then said, “So you’ll get more of them, unless we can find a way for me not to transfer so much of the memories to you.”
The seven leap at Steven as if on cue.  It is brutal and shocking. Steven flips one over his shoulder into one behind him as if he has eyes in the back of his head. The sound of bones cracked and crushed echoes in the room against the heavy panting of men in battle. Steven doesn’t stop. He immediately gathers up the stunned man and smashes him into the next attacker. It works, but it also throws Steven off balance. He stumbles and one of Estane’s omegas gets the upper hand and punches Steven in the groin. He muffles a cry as he hunches down on his knees. One of them laughs at Steven and goes to smack a boot in his face, but Steven catches the boot and jerks the leg, pulling it out of the socket and fracturing the bone at the same time.
“Something like that,” Steve says. “We wanted a new start. And seems a lot of places back home treated Bucky like he was an invalid.”
He’d had a headache earlier when he tossed the glasses, but the truth is he hasn’t thought of it for hours now. “No. Not really. I-.” This is presumptuous of him, but he’s going to say it anyhow. He’s Tony Stark after all. “I think we need condoms and lube. Now we might not but that’s my read of the situation.”
T’Challa’s dark eyes reflected the light from the window, a million colors drown in them, a million responsibilities to his nation. “I am not here to cause you anxiety. You are welcome here for as long as you need. But I wonder, Captain, if you realize what has been done does not save your country.”
Steve smiled with a knowing gaze. The power of a Submissive should never be under estimated. “Home Tony.”
Without turning to look at Tony, Steve says, “You won’t like it in the morning. You’re anxious and stressed from everything that’s happened.”
“You’ve been given a reprieve on your death sentence. Lucky for you, I happen to be Aria Carbonelli’s heir.” The omega jerks his shoulders but keeps his face averted as if to hide his reaction to the name. “Did you know my mother? That was a long time ago, but then you’ve been in stasis for decades.”
Tony wants to pout but he’s too intrigued by Steve’s hypothesis. “I hadn’t considered that at all.” Does he want to go down the pathway? Is being blind in public even an option for him? For these past 10 years it hasn’t been, he’s paid hundred of thousands of dollars to ensure no one would speak of it. “Damn.”
“I don’t feel right,” he mumbles. He has a nasal cannula in – he can smell the plastic of the tubing, but his body feels loose and separated.
The words shiver through Tony like an ice storm. They pelt him and he waits for the lights to go out with their fierceness, but it never happens. He hears the words and it takes moments to compute them, to put them together with what he knows, what he fears, and what can be. When he looks at Steve, he doesn’t see earnestness, he sees determination and power. He may have been playing more innocent and earnest before, but he’s shed all of that to show Tony more of who he is and what he’s willing to offer. He thinks tears may sting his eyes. “That’s good to know, because I’m going to tell you something. I want to you remember that after I finish telling you.”
Steve gets to a small ledge. It’s not much but it’s enough to use the shield. He swings it downward and tosses it with a low arc to glance at the side of Hulk’s temple again. It works like a charm. Hulk tumbles. Steve rustles up enough energy to race up the rocky ridge. The snow impedes his progress, and his thigh muscles burn with lactic acid. That almost never happens now with the serum – but his body’s reacting to the virtual dream.
“Come on, where’s your sense of adventure?” Tony tugs him along onto the grassy hill near the cabin. “This way.”
Clint turned to Steve as he picked up his bow. “Just got a call from my better half. We better get our asses in gear because we have a job to do.”
As Steve started to rock into his mouth, Tony ran his tongue along the underside of his thick cock. Pre-come ran freely from his cock and Tony lapped at it, sucking and licking as he did. Steve growled out a half scream, half cry. Tony looked up to catch a glimpse of Steve, rolling his head against the back of the couch, hands now gripping the threadbare fabric and tearing it. His mouth was open as he cried out and it jolted Tony. He needed to stop or else he was going to come without a hand on him. Just seeing Steve so overcome and feeling the reflection of it along the lines of their souls as they wrapped together took his breath away. Yet he transcended the physical plane of feeling, of experiencing the moment. He tried to clasp onto the feelings, the coiling in his groin as he closed in on climax but he failed to stay. The energies surrounding them permeated his consciousness until it lifted him and it transformed him. Souls merged and he only succumbed to its power, its potency.
Tony’s face twists into an expression that befuddles Steve. “You’d do that? Even with what happened today?”
“This is what a degree in fine arts gets you, Rogers,” Steve says. Bucky used to bait him all the time about his degree. Not that he was mocking him, but Bucky had always been more practical about his life choices. Look he picked Sam – or Sam picked him.
He sounds so desperately earnest as if he needs to convince Tony for fear he might lose something. It should be endearing but all Tony thinks is – who asks questions like that? Steve’s desperate for validation as if he worries about losing something so precious and rare that he cannot handle the thought. Yet, as Steve pointed out, they’ve only been involved for three weeks and they’ve never even done the nasty.
“Her name was Aria bey’Carbonelli. She’d been fostered and named by the Family,” Tony supplies and turns to Pep as she gapes at him. He cocks an eyebrow and then turns back to the antiquated screen. “I’m her son and heir. Therefore that omega is mine. Prepare him for bonding. I’ll be in the bonding room.”
“Hey,” Tony said. He thumbed over his shoulder. “Just got a message. I thought you might want to know, Natasha is on her way back.” Tony lightly stroked Steve’s arm. “You don’t have to deal with it.” He changed his tune. “
Tony peers into the boiling pot of thin broth. “I’m sorry to break it to you but that’s not a nice Bordelaise.”
“Mrs. Clint wanted to know if you two love birds are coming to breakfast,” Sam called from the other side of the door.
Tony bites into his sandwich and then says – because he’s always curious and he’s a scientist and why the hell not? “Do you shit a lot?”
Silence eeked out the next few minutes until Tony took in a useless breath and then released it. “I want to tell you. I understand. You went through a lot. So did I.”
A deer in headlights has a better chance than Steve does at that moment. He shifts his attention between the bed and the couch, half glad that Tony couldn’t see him. He gathers up his sketchpad and pencils. Sitting on the edge of the bed, Steve wills his heart to stop the stampede in his chest.
“Not when you don’t have the stone to control it.” That’s Natasha’s voice in the distance as if she’s hanging on and telegraphing her words through Tony.
“Yep,” Tony says. “So we need to isolate that singularity. Otherwise it’s going to encroach on our reality. Since that alternate Steve is affecting our Steve, and I’m getting echoes too-.”
“Ultron knows everything I know because he had access to JARVIS before we knew he was an evil doom AI. Well, I had dossiers, files of information on all the team members. I kept accumulating it.”
Steven continues, “It’s true. In some ways. I didn’t know you. I still don’t. Not truly, not the way I want to.” His eyes are searching, constantly moving over Tony’s face. For a moment, Tony realizes that Steven could simply and completely crush his head in his massive hands. But there’s not a molecule of fear in Tony. He utterly trusts his omega with his life. The truth comes to him then that Steven cannot trust Tony, not at all, not with his unpredictability.
“Yeah! Yeah! She’s fabulous. Her lines, the 40s motif. The detailing. Wow!”  He’s skipping around the bike, skittering with his booted feet.
"You're not going to try and scam me are you? Cause I'm smarter than I look."  Steve manages to force the words out, but the youth has his arm around Steve, and there’s comradery in his mannerism, something very foreign to Steve. Plus, he doesn’t want this to be a scam, he truly doesn’t.
“I don’t need to-.” Tony said but Steve only growled while Bruce joined them. It was then that Tony felt the heat in his mark and that he glimpsed that both Bruce’s and Steve’s soul marks pulsed a red beat.
He peered over the cliff into the abyss where the stars disappeared and then he looked back at Sol in the distance beckoning him. Implicitly he understood the question. Fundamentally, Steve yearned to be warmed inside to his bones. The sun offered him that pleasure. He longed for the heat of it. For ages he’d been chilled and paralyzed by the cold. He gazed down into the chasm – where the cosmos elongated and vanished.  The darkness echoed back to him, the coldness sweeping through him. A pulse and he felt the life he would leave behind and the beautiful agony ached.
Natasha knocked him with an elbow, winked, and as she ran to catch the lift with Bruce said, “Steve’s coming around.”
“The Syns will be there. Vision and his General – I think that his name is Ultron. They’ll be pushing for a stronger surge. They’re terrified of the Supreme Intelligence of the Kree.”
The sir throws him a bit and he shakes his head. “I don’t want you to call me sir. I understand I’m the client, but from here on out, I want to be the omega in the room. I’m a sub omega so please, let’s just-.” He draws in a breath. “Let’s just start.”
"You gotta name?" The boy asks as he pulls out a pack of cigarettes. Steve’s eyes go wide when he sees them. When the boy offers, Steve only waves them off – he doesn’t need to smoke with his asthma and bad heart.
Hill startled as if she understood the significant of not only the soul pack, but the position Sam held. It was the closest to the position of Beloved according to Wong. Hill accepted him immediately after Steve’s announcement.
When they get to the service elevator, it takes a bit for the car to arrive and Steve anxiously looks behind them, worried the wait staff or some of the media reporters will sneak away and find them. The elevator dings its arrival and they step on.
“Steve this is the particular client I told you about when you first started. I truly believe you’re perfect for him. You’re his physical type and you treat your clients like individuals. We need that for him.”
“Dormammu. The eater of souls. From the dark dimension, Dormammu attacked Earth, and tried to nullify it. I stopped him, but as I did it – time and space changed. I believe because of it, the universe changed and the parameters transformed along with it. The whole of the universe changed and soul packs and mates became a reality. The world around you changed and you accepted it. Yet, the humanity doesn’t look at soul packs or mates as a real thing because they are still rare.”
“No,” Tony said. He grabbed on tight; this one wasn’t going to escape that easily. “No, I’m good. Just wanted to know if I should bring my check book.”
“Don’t say that!” Steve went to stand up but then realized he had no clothes. Sure, Bucky had seen him naked a number of times, but under these circumstances Steve decided it might be better to be a little less revealing. “Don’t. It’s not like that. And people don’t think that. Not anymore.”
“Snarky,” Steve mumbles and leaves his cabin. It’s only a short walk to the prince’s quarters but he finds his palms sweaty by the time he knocks on the door. JARVIS allows him entry. When he joins Tony, the prince’s demeanor is calm and quiet – all the joy gone.
The suggestion elicits a reaction deep in his gut and he moans. His throat tightens and his salivary glands contract. He lifts up onto his outstretch arm in time to spew what little he has in his stomach. The comforting hand strokes up and down his back and he vomits again though it is really only a dry heave. His body trembles and he almost falls into the mess but a strong arm yanks him away from it.
Steve considered the landscape as Tony watched from the side. “They have guard towers in tandem. That means once one knows we’re there, the whole line will.”
Tugging on the shirt, he considers her. He narrows his eyes and tries to discern if she’s testing him, trying to find the cracks in his memories. “I’m not changing my story, he was there.”
Tony taps out a few commands on the controls. “You have me there. Like I said I did some refinements and I helped Coulson – a little – well a lot. He didn’t always accept my ideas, thought my brains were too out there in the cosmos. Maybe he was right.” His words drift as the ship turns toward the massive nebula.
Thank you - all of you for such a great reception on this story. If you haven't noticed, because of your interest and some of your comments, I have decided to add a few chapters - though I was mostly done with the story. I decided it needed the depth and resolution that the readers would demand! So you get a few more chapters!
He doesn’t know when he wakes up or if he actually slept at all. When he does he gets out of bed and stands by the windows, looking at the ocean. He feels the calming waves as if he bathes in them. Finally he feels a little release as if he’s done with all that’s happened. He can dive into his work these final months that he has left until the palladium kills him. He can do this, he can find a way to make the world a better place.
He shoved his hands in his pockets to stop from clenching them. “I wanted to tell you something, Tony. Something I learned right before the fall of SHIELD.”
“I wonder why he did that?” Stark says with his chin in his hand, peering at Steve with a quizzical look.
“All this time?” Steve’s voice is hushed, awed in tone. “You’re on the news all the time. On the magazine covers. All the time.”
Hot. He feels so hot and achy and he cannot climb his way back from the darkness. He allows it to consume him and all the questions and fears melt into it until it is a potent thing. He shudders in its embrace until he finally manages to open his eyes.
Tony agrees and they find their way through the overgrown garden to the cottage where all the occupants have arisen for the day. Frigga looks at them and intuitively understands.
Tony sips the coffee, blanches at it, and then, as he stands, says, “I’m wily. Have to be sharp around me to fool me. And that coffee is terrible. Dump it.”
Tony rushed to Steve’s side and searched for any sign, any molecule of life. It ebbed away, leaking like the blood staining the rocks below Steve. Kneeling, Tony reached out with his soul and the tattered remains answered him.
“And how did this end? A Collapsing Event and you can’t hide your wings. How do you hide wings anyhow?” A look of frustration crosses Tony’s face.
“Okay, so the Army?” Rhodey asks. He’s not being patronizing, at least Tony doesn’t think he is – but considering he’s still recovering from his ordeal, he just returned from the dead, and made a sweeping announcement regarding his company, he’s not surprised that he’s having a hard time reading his friend.
Just his fucking luck as soon as Tony got Steve in his Tower, showed him the apartment he could be living in, Steve brought up the old war pal, Bucky Barnes. Tony’s nerves bristled when Steve sidestepped their moments together to focus on Barnes. With Steve in his Tower, Tony suddenly needed some sort of equilibration with his pack, especially with Steve. Now, though, he wasn’t even going to get the time required to do that – not only did a psychic blast hit him today with such urgency and insistence that he had to drop everything and rush to Steve’s side, but some half-crazed Hydra henchman was going to block his way. Tony had said he needed time to process, to figure out what being part of this pack really meant to him, but the truth was when coming face to face with Steve, all of his conflicting emotions drained away. Steve – his presence, his very real blood and bone presence – moved Tony like a seismic shift. It almost felt drug like, the need, the want to be close to Steve overwhelmed all of his doubts. Yet, here Steve was pushing his old war buddy who also happened to be an evil traitor.
“Of course, the guards are following but at a discrete distance. You just don’t see them.” Tony closes his grasp on his arm. Steve peers around the station and the act of turning his head causes a swooping loop and he nearly collapses right there. Tony keeps him on his feet. “And that’s the aftereffects of a shock rod. It’ll pass, but you need to sit down and rest.”
“Your eyes look fine,” Steve blurts out and then stammers. Just standing close to him, Tony can feel the vibrations of actual embarrassment. “I mean-.”
Steve reads it easily enough. Tony’s worried about the deal with Secretary Ross. Testing Tony about the details is off limits. On the other hand, there’s Natasha. Steve shares a look with her, but she keeps her expression frozen, solid and strong. There’s a reason she’s a top ranked assassin and spy. Steve shifts away to gaze out the window the plane.
“What can we do for you, Nick?”  Steve had his arms folded over his chest, his shield on his back. He was ready, alert, and spirited in a way that Tony had never seen before in his interactions with Fury.
“But Ultron and JARVIS separated long before we knew about Barton’s farm,” Steve says and points in the direction of the house. “How?”
He fell before he managed to get to the safe house. His energy depleted and the sun beginning to rise in the east. He chanced a moment just to glimpse the rays but, of course, the pain shot like spears through his retinas. He slipped inside the Foggy Bottom rowhouse, closed and locked the door. Safe. He hated DC and he despised the rowhouse. The windows were boarded up, making it look like the house was run down and used by addicts in the local area. He rubbed at his eyes before he climbed the stairs to the living room on the main floor. His legs jellied, and he felt like his lungs burned for air. Which was a ridiculous notion. Tony no longer needed air. He didn’t breathe. Vampires, the undead, left the sweetness of a breath, a sigh, an intake of air behind when the world turned preternatural and the eternal lands of immortality encompassed him.
“But maybe having children will change that. Can’t roll the dice on that one.” Tony wrapped an arm around Steve’s waist and pulled him. “Whaddya say, baby? Let’s have an actual baby. You know, the one that cries for you in the middle of the night. One, two, three. How ever much you want.”
Steve was on the rooftop, squatting tending to the wild arugula. Their vegetable patch was a hodgepodge of Tony's favorite vegetables and Steve's plants. On the west side of the roof stood a carnation garden, while the south side was reserved for their baby greens and tomato tree.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist and dropped his head on Steve’s bicep. “Good morning, beloved.”
“Forever isn’t infinite. Your life isn’t over, Steve. You have to live. I know, it’s like listening to a broken record, you have all of us giving you platitudes, checking on you. I see you’ve reached the end of the line. But it’s true, Steve. You’ll be alright, one day. But grief, it stays. You’ll always miss him. Love him. But you can’t keep doing this. Your children need you.”
It takes Steve getting shot for Tony to stop self-medicating. Alcohol can’t appease grief, especially as Steve’s bloody body was fed to the pigs.
Steve is making beans when Tony walks into the flat. He smiles like a good man, and presses a kiss to Tony’s lips. “You must be starved from your walk with Miss Barnes.”
“Shall I take pride in that? When will you kill me? After you’ve taken my other leg, my right hand?” I laugh, and it’s my own voice I speak to him with. “None of that matters, just this face right?”
He can’t decide if he wants Tony to come on his face or his mouth, but he wants Tony to see the evidence of his spunk dripping down Steve’s cheeks and jaw. It’s not possible—it can’t be—and so Steve just sucks Tony off. He flicks his tongue on Tony’s slit, then mouths at the head of his cock. Steve’s not above pretending that Tony’s moaning his name.
“She’s swimming!” Tony laughs, full bellied. He clutches Steve’s forearms and kisses his cheek. “What a handful.”
Steve kisses me again, like an apology, then he’s pressing against my hole, still wet and swollen from hours ago. He groans, kisses my cheeks, and tells me, “Shellhead, god. Tony.”
Steve pulls me to his chest, and he settles his chin on my shoulder. He nuzzles my neck and keeps me warm, even if I’m not cold.
When they reach town, there are screams from the Walter household. Jessica Drew is in the corner of the room, crying beside Rhodes and Mayor Danvers.
He wiped his forehead, standing to give them all a brief one-armed hug. He went to the kitchen and fixed them drinks, movements mechanic. Get the glasses. Pour the drinks. Put them in the tray. An easy task. He could do that.
Just for payback Steve kissed Tony soundly on the lips.  “Now, my Red Hot Lover has time for me, does he?”
” She asked with an arched eyebrow. Her hands went to her hips. Steve wondered if this was the same irritation and fear Tony felt around Pepper.
Steve grimaces, heat rising to his neck. He’s ready to defend his actions. He hasn’t done anything spectacular to write home about, but he’s proud of what he’s done, even if he knows it’s not enough.
Some people are able to go home, take the country road there. One foot after the other, and feel at peace. Some people know the way by heart and it comes easy for them. Steve wonders what it’s like now for empty homes after the snap.
Once, an old woman in Tunis called him a vagabond. He supposes that she’s right. He's done nothing in the years since the Snap but drift, wandering from one place to another, never staying long enough to get comfortable.
And now they’re here—in the hospital. Tony was about to go into surgery and he had cancer. What the fuck was happening? How did Steve miss this? Life was going too quickly. Maybe he got complacent, too delighted with his family life. He couldn’t help but wonder whether they’d be able to detect the cancer if he was more attentive.
He prods the organs, his sleeves covered in green slime. Blood, Tony realizes. “Is it just Walter or are the rest of the returnees like this?”
He wants to talk. He wants to say so much. But there are rules in place, and he’s trapped in limbo, at once having what he’s always wanted, but not in the circumstances he’s wished for. Steve imagined evenings in the Mansion, together in the workshop, walking around the city, crawling across the town and its people like they’re just two ordinary citizens. Breakfast served and eaten together, late evenings that end in soft kisses and the promise of more. More. More. More. That’s the thing with Steve, isn’t it? He’s always wanted more.
Rhodes hummed, ruffling her hair. His face was grim, but he smiled at her. “Looks very pretty on you.”
The trunk closes with a sharp thud. Steve sags with relief, wishing he could search Tony’s eyes for a clue of what he’s thinking.
The mission was a close call. Tony’s a hero. But he didn’t always have to act the part. When a huge chunk of building dropped on the Iron Man suit, it felt like watching Tony fall out of the sky again.
I don’t know who I am without the suit. Connection to Extremis. I like to think there’s a man in there. Maybe there was once a time we could all go home, back to 890 Fifth. Share a pizza and call it easy. Call it home. Call it friendship. That’s probably the issue. Nostalgia is a horrible sentiment because it eats you inside out until you’re just hollow bones. Can’t touch me though. I’ve got Extremis stored there so I’m invincible. I got that going on for me.
His little baby boy may be thirteen, but it’s just like yesterday when he and Tony took him home from the hospital.
Carol traced the perimeter of the room. There were painkillers on the bedside table, vomit on the floor, and blood on the sheets.
Tony clicked play before Steve could respond. Steve forced himself to watch, alternating between the screen and Tony’s face.
Steve shifted forward, holding Tony’s body closer to him and intertwining their fingers. “Everything will be fine.”
“Fine, sweet talker, you can go. But just for today.” Tony offers his palms and Steve hands him the plates. They’re quiet as they clean the rest of the kitchen. Steve clears off and rinses the table with a rag, returning to the kitchen just in time for Tony to start the dishwasher.
Before Steve can talk himself out of it, he presses a hand against the ajar bedroom door, peaking in. The hinges are well-oiled. It doesn’t creak.
He went on about his day, cleared the plates off from the kitchen table, washed the dishes, dried them, then stacked them inside the cabinet. He washed the mug then placed them on the dish rack.
It would have been better if it was Steve. If it was Steve, he wouldn’t have to deal with waking up in the middle of the night and sobbing until his chest felt numb. Maybe that’s selfish, because how would Tony deal if Steve died? Would he move on? Would he remarry? He has always been a stronger man than Steve. He would be fine.
Every Friday like clockwork, Tony will twist his mouth and proclaim Dutch Honey has no actual honey and he much prefers real honey that comes from bees, thank you very much. Then, Steve and Morgan both have the answering reply:
Steve watches Rumiko maneuver around, grabbing the bottle of lube and squeezing the bottom of the dildo as she pulls out. It makes a salacious sound. She croons—puts one hand on her cock, adjusts her stance—and then she’s mounting Tony, fucking him faster and faster until the only sound in the room is Tony’s moans, his breathy voice as he begs to come.
He shifted, and their toes touched. Steve exhaled, hard. Tony breathed in the smell of him. Sometimes, when he closed his eyes, he recalled when they first found Steve on ice and fighting side by side.
“I’m going to Tony Stark’s.” He paused by the door and straightened. “I’m going to tell him what we found. He could help us.”
“You wear his face. And you’re truly, truly kind.” Tony chokes out the words, letting the tears fall. “Thank you for being kind. But you aren’t him.”
“Nah, he was a crazy son of a bitch.” Tony pockets the pipe and glances back at the Sheriff’s Station, missing how Rogers used to stand out in the patio with both hands on his belt like a goddamn sovereign subject.
I can’t help but think of you. I don’t know, Steve. It doesn’t have to be love. Replace the word with something vile or another metaphor, but that’s what it is. Being human. Being us, superheroes, viginilate, whatever it is. We’ll see death soon enough.
Tony placed a hand on Steve’s cheek and turned his face. Steve balled his fists over Tony’s hospital gown, letting the tears stream down his face. “It’s gonna be alright, Tony.”
Tony wants to say that’s not true, it’s you who’s always been impatient. Can’t swallow down words that disagree with you, Tony doesn’t utter these words. Instead, he goes up on one elbow and bends over to grab Steve’s hair. He tugs and barks out, “Shut the fuck up and make yourself useful for once, Cap.”
“Ok, back to my presents now!” Morgan held out the box calling their attention. Since she was the youngest, everyone in the family spoiled her rotten as if she didn’t have Tony and Steve trained.
He wanted her out of the workshop and out of the brownstone. Didn’t his friends see that Steve wanted  to deal with this shit on his own?
“Yeah. But they don’t belong to me,” he huffs. “In a sense, I kind of want to tell you, that yes, they’re mine.”
He places them on  the table, then reaches over, once, twice, three times, until he pulls back last minute to grab his glass of water or the cutlery.
“I’ve stopped asking why. I know how it happened. Biologically, I can explain it to myself. To Harley. To Morgan. But dad’s gone. I might never fully understand that. Ever.”
Steve’s world trembled. Maybe his memory failed him. For all of Abraham Erskine's talk about enhanced memory, he wished he didn’t have to remember Tony this way: eyes closed, lips still plum and slightly blue. His body still. His chest and ribs no longer rising with every breath.
It isn’t until they’re moving him to another room, “clean sheets,” Steve had promised the night before when Tony finally orgasmed, that he sees the photographs lining the hallway.
“Did you wake me up just for this?” He juts out his jaw, wishing Steve would hit him until he’s dead.
He gives no explanation of why he’s changed his mind. Steve wants to ask, but talks himself out of it. Instead, he focuses on reading all the highway signs.
He looks at Steve and sees a man he’d do anything for. Yet, there’s Steve, but something different about him. It does not please Tony to know there’s something about Steve Rogers that he cannot name. It isn’t a frightening difference, no, it’s barely there at all. His eyes are still clear, blue, and honest. The smile he wears is unadulterated, still bashful, though he has no reason to feel shy. Not around Tony.
It’s winter in New York. I had some down time today. Yeah, what a surprise. I finished all the paperwork at the helicarrier so I busted out my jeans and sneakers and walked to Mosco Street. Out of the armor for the first time in a long while. It’s probably not good to show myself without the armor. Everything could go wrong. I count the hours when there isn’t a crisis. Everything’s gone to shit, Steve. My Avengers—
Steve pulls off only to straddle Tony’s face. Tony’s looking up at him with wide eyes, bright under the night light. There’s a moment he’s shocked, and then tilts back, head going side to side, slurring again. Steve presses the head of his cock on Tony’s lips, then shifts back down to splay between Tony’s legs. He doesn’t want to choke Tony, not tonight, when their movements are heavy, bodies filled with drugs. Steve brings their cocks together once more and jerks them off until they both come.
Steve drops his fingers in the cup, then tilts Tony’s jaw back up, pries his mouth open again, and swirls his fingers onto Tony’s tongue like he’d do if it was his cock. Steve coats his lips with the paste and breathes heavily. Tony doesn’t have to look down to see the erection Steve is sporting. “Now, swallow.”
Steve groaned, jacking Tony off. He was a dirty bastard. He circled the rim, before pressing a finger in. He pumped it in and out, using his other hand to fondle with Tony’s cock head.
Tony blinks his eyes open, turning on the bed to find a glass of water. He’s been called a futurist, but Tony doesn’t have that much foresight to prepare a glass of water for himself after a night of partying. The water is cool, the glass has condensation. He doesn’t remember bringing anyone home. He doesn’t remember much. His head still feels like it's filled with cotton and his body is heavy. Sitting up, he drinks the water in slow, measured gulps. Tony presses the cool glass to his forehead, hoping it would alleviate his headache.
Natasha leaned forward offering Morgan a large box wrapped in cartoon reindeers. “So I guess Morgan’s gonna get all her presents first. Here you go, my dear, from me and Uncle Bucky.”
“Hey now.” Steve can’t help but trace the lines crinkling beside his eyes even if irritation springs upon him. “Language.”
He turned back to his friends—family—they all appeared to be waiting for him to say something. Steve had nothing to say unless it was to describe the emptiness of living. Waiting.
“God, you’re my dream.” Tony slides a hand through Steve’s hair and pulls him back to suck his dick. “God, Steve. Fuck.”
He remains silent and stares at the wicker chair in the corner, wondering if Tony’s ever here, if he finds the greenhouse with all of its various scents and colors, relaxing. Steve bites his tongue. He has so many questions, but none of them come out.
Steve watched it another three times before writing his notes on a legal pad. It’s just a jumbled mess of thoughts and read more like reflections on life in the new century. What the fuck was he doing here? What the fuck was going on with SHIELD? HYDRA? Bucky was alive and was HYDRA’s pawn? What was the difference between HYDRA and SHIELD? Did Nick Fury know about this?
“If you think partying around this area is such a bad thing, then why are you here?” Tony challenges with a raised eyebrow.
No matter how many times Tony explained the process of cancer cells to kids, pathologized it, instituted scientific terms and delineated the decline of his biology, it didn’t prepare the kids for the emotional impact of his passing. It didn’t prepare Steve.
There were jasmines at every corner of the Compound starting from the concrete path leading to the facility. They filed out of the vehicle, one by one, and gathered in the lounge.
“Oh, fuck.” Tony cuddled closer, resting his head on Steve’s shoulders. “We got one room down for the housing warming party. Next time, I want the bed, Rogers, so you better set up the bed frame after this.”
Steve smiles, trails open mouthed kisses down Tony’s neck. “Tony, you’re so perfect. Like a dream. A goddamn dream.”
Tony isn’t used to this undivided attention. It’s as if Steve’s seeing too much of Tony, finding all the pockets of hope and despair that live inside him.
Clint glared at his open hand as if he might set it on fire with his stare, but after a long moment of evaluation and study, he accepted the offer and clasped Steve’s hand. The soul bond opened as Steve felt his astral projection harmonize with Clint’s soul, but at that moment a loud horrible squeal raked the air. The train juddered, causing them to lurch forward, and their hands broke apart as the soul bond screeched between them. Clint collapsed as the sound of metal protesting and twisting screamed through the air. People let out cries of surprise and the train jerked. Steve braced himself as the train continued its harrowing journey, half on and half off the tracks.
He reaches over to pull off the blood pressure cuff, and then yanks out the intravenous line, feeding him what he doesn’t know. The pulse-ox monitor is taped to his finger and he has a time of it trying to unravel the tape to get it off, but finally he does. The bed rail is easily handled and he shifts off the bed only to be stopped by – “Hey, where are you going?”
It takes a moment and Steve sees the flush of anger flare over Tony’s face, but he holds back the reaction and says, “Make me. Make me understand this thing. Make me understand why I shouldn’t want your friend gone or dead or in prison. Make me understand why you protect him like you’re his omega. Are you? Are you his?”
Throwing himself on the bed, he stares at the exposed beams. It’s beautiful if a little too rustic for Tony’s tastes. He’s all clean lines and metal. The warmth of wood and the texture of roughness presents a different picture – one of nature and hominess. Tony never really known home; it’s a foreign concept to him.
“Oh,” Shuri said and then stepped away to check on one of the monitors. She tapped on her bracelet and then smiled at them. “The spiritual plane is something Wakanda has been studying for some time. It’s part of our King’s journey.”
“It’s holographic, but the lush greenery is not. So, what do you think? Should we go?” A shift of expression crosses Tony’s gaze – hopeful and pained at the same time. It’s that haunted look that Steve first noticed when he met the prince.
The armor melts away from Tony’s face, that’s battered and bruised. He lets out a troubled breath and coughs. Steve bends over him, checking to see if anything impeding his airway. Tony bats him away.
“August 1st. Yep.” Steve hopes to hell he can catch some sleep tonight. It’s been a long few weeks. “All ready to roll.”
It almost sounded like home and Steve’s heart skipped a beat. He felt his cheeks warm and he bowed his head, trying to suppress a smile. “Okay.”
Natasha gently lays his head back onto the cot and pats his shoulder. “I’m sorry, Steve. I am. There’s not much I can do.”
“Well, it grew it back. Eventually. Took a few months. From what I hear. It’s like one of those salamanders that you cut their tail and it grows back.” He directed them through the lobby, never stopping to point out the curving archway toward the mezzanine. Instead they went to a bank of elevators. “They cut it out because it was bad or something. If you want, sir, you can get all the reports downloaded. They’re all digitalization. We spent the last few years doing that.”
“The honor is mine, sir,” Steve said. He remained calm. No need to show his anxiety and worry to these men. They were shrewd, and Steve needed to know exactly where Pierce stood.
Strange huffs in little grunts – Tony easily recognizes them. The arrogant doctor has a habit of puffing out groans and grunts when he’s taxed by his patients or their family members. “I assure you that Tony is not in any danger. We will run imaging tests, but I suspect that problem will be the implant.”
The bond fluttered around him, like a tattered battle flag. Steve reached out inwardly to grab them. Yet, as soon as he gathered a few of the tendrils more would slip away like whispers of clouds in his hands. He forced himself not to panic, not to allow the anxiety of the moment to capture him and use him. He eased away from his fears and concentrated on the anguished call of the soul before him. It ached like stabbing cold winds of winter. Grimacing he began again to collect the remnants of Clint’s soul only to be thwarted again and again. Maybe he approached it the wrong way. Maybe he needed to command the souls together.
“Okay, okay.” He glances at Luke before they depart and mouths ‘thank you’, all the time thinking he might regret what he created. Luke only laughs and waves him away.
Steve muttered the Mantra as he went to the garage and got his bike. It would be at least a three hour drive. That meant that there was no way for Steve to make it there, deal with Bucky, and then back again before Tony woke up and noticed Steve was gone. One way or another Steve would end up paying for leaving the Tower and not telling Tony. He hopped on the bike after donning his Captain America helmet to stop the police for pulling him over. He didn’t start up the bike right away as he mulled over the right decision.
Rhodey tucked his shirts into the drawers in the small walk in closet. “How do you even know where a Blood Den is? I thought those things were illegal.”
“Come, open your mouth, my sweet omega,” the man says and his voice deepens. Steve follows the direction as the alpha slips a hand into his loose trousers to pull out his thick and long erection. Steve nearly doesn’t hold the pose. His arms quake, but he keeps up as the man slides his dick onto Steve’s tongue. “Should I knot your mouth? I think I will.” He pushes into Steve’s mouth. He’s long and wide and Steve’s lips stretch over him, the hood of his cock thick against Steve’s tongue.
Steve inhales and it seems to suck all the agony out of the car and into his broad chest. When he speaks it shatters Tony’s resolve. “I know that, but I had to let it happen if I wanted to stay here. Now I can’t, darling. I have to leave.” His words rips open all the wounds and destroy all Tony’s hopes.
Doing so now, though, would be wrong. His whole world fell apart. He twisted it and the strain frayed it until it could no longer withstand it. “I can’t ask that of you.”
“Hey, hey. What are you doing? Bad kitty! Bad kitty!” The big cat stops and scowls at Tony in the dim light of evening. “Look what you did. You’re making a mess!” He marches over to the armor and starts to sort it again. Bending over hurts like hell but he’s too pissed to care. “This is not Dagobah and you are not an old Jedi Master. You don’t get to fuck with my stuff.”
“As you say,” Steven says. “They say time heals all wounds.” There is resignation in his voice. He changes the subject. “If it isn’t punishment, then what?”
“Alone. Without your pack, without your Healer?” Tony asked. Again, Steve kept falling into the same trap in his head. But, then again, Tony knew how that was. He often fell into the same anxieties and fears over and again. Tony admitted that he separated his soul from Steve – as much as he could – but at the same time he wanted to encircle Steve with his soul, with his arms. He felt the fear, the uncertainty. He understood a lot of that. Hell, he just wanted to run because of his part in what was going on in Sokovia, but the truth was they needed to see the bigger picture. Thor was right about understanding who and what they were.
He didn’t look because it was Peggy again, her hand perched on his shoulder. “Don’t deny yourself happiness.”
“Pu-punished?” Pep says. The shock on her face is almost matched by the horror when he adds that he’s being caned. “Caned? You’re having him caned? What did he do? Try and kill you? Betray you with another alpha? What the hell did he do?”
Tony slowly rounds the lab bench, leaving behind his latest work. “Any idea if they’ve captured it yet?”
“Thank you, sir.” Steve doesn’t want to venture to the question of his months missing in action. Everyone knows where he was now, everyone’s heard the stories of Andersonville, the Confederate prison encampment where nightmares took root to grow and mature and follow a man all the days of his life.
Speaking of which, Tony nodded. “Yes. Make the plans.” He kissed her on the cheek and then squeezed her hands. “Do you know if Bruce stopped by?”
The dead indeed. Standing in the middle of the Barton kitchen Nick Fury managed to glare at them through the shades of his sunglasses. Tony wanted to act surprised, but the idea that Nick Fury survived multiple gunshot wounds and haunted the shadows and alleyways failed to move him at all. Glancing at Steve, Tony noted that dear old Cap wasn’t any more surprised than Nat or Sam. Thor had no idea that Fury was supposed to have kicked the bucket and greeted him with a hearty handshake and smack to the shoulder. Bruce stared wide-eyed at Fury like he might turn tail and run or at the very least turn into the Hulk and pout out by the apple orchard to the back of the barn.
Dropping the skinner, he picks up the sharpest blade he has and prepares himself. He closes his eyes to the mess of blood. He holds onto the gland even though the pain coils in his stomach and he wants to vomit. The shivers come over him and he knows he’s losing his nerve. He needs to do it, now. Now. Opening his eyes he glimpses himself in the mirror, his pupils are blown wide and black, only a thin ring of blue is visible. There’s blood in the whites of his eyes. He quakes but he forces his focus back to the gland he holds in his hand.
Steve wants to tell her he’s not a captain anymore, but his mouth declines to cooperate and he only manages a low groan. He can’t believe how weak he is, how all of his energy has drained from him since the flight. In the Iron Man armor, Tony bends over. The servos spin and then Steve is gently lifted into his embrace. He feels young and old at the same time. Tony carries him across the small space, the laboratory lights flashing above Steve as he tries to concentrate but fails. Tony stops, lingering and not bending down to the cradle.
Tony smiled at Stane. Obie treated him like a treasured nephew, always doting on him and giving him the attention Howard never did. “Good, Obie. I’m working on cores for the arc reactor today.” Obie thought it was a useless project, but he’d always supported Tony’s ideas.
They would keep him alive, Steve concluded. Alive and in the dark room hanging from unbreakable chains. They’d keep him injured and in pain. Muted and violated. Ross continued to talk, babbling on about his plans, how this was God’s work. The words smeared together and fell into the blood stains on the floor. The smell of the room wafted around him, the blood, the semen. Piss. He must have urinated at some point. He couldn’t remember. The heat of embarrassment burned on his face. He shuddered against his bonds. Finding a way out, searching for a way to save Tony. He couldn’t even bargain, not with the gag on.
Steve wets his lips and then bows his head. He looks up at Tony, obviously steeling himself for the bad reaction with his hands folded on his belt – the classic Cap stance. “I want to tell you something that I learned.”
She smiles and it lights up the room. Steve chances a glance at Stark and notes how he adores her. It is clear in his every motion and the glint of his expression. “Oh, just call me Pepper, everyone does.”
“You didn’t see him in Siberia, Nat. You couldn’t know what it was like.” He hasn’t really discussed his feeling about it with anyone. Not even Bucky. On the flight to Wakanda, Bucky stayed quiet and Steve had been numb with sorrow. Dissociated from everything and everyone.
The truth of how he always shuts away the pain bubbles to the surface, yet he still braces against it. “Years of practice.” It’s all he has to say for Steve to wilt a little.
“Oh yeah. I forgot to send her a message that we were staying a few extra days. She dropped off supplies though and left.” He points to the paper bag and then focuses on the coffeemaker. Taking two mugs down, he asks, “What do you want for breakfast? We worked up quite the appetite last night. Even I’m hungry.”
“I take my leave.” Heimdall doesn’t wait for them to bid him farewell, he simply disappears in a burst of vibrant rainbow light.
“Send it to the prince’s quarters on his ship. He wants me to wait for him. Important meeting or something.” He yawns halfway through the word something.
“Not as intimidating as the shell around you,” Tony said as he tapped the halo around the cluster of stars in the center. “From how it works and how I felt it in London – this is me. I’m the armor around you.”
“No. No. No.” He heard Tony say and grab onto Bucky’s flesh and blood hand. “Don’t you do this. Don’t you leave him now! He just fucking found you.” The words meant the world to Steve even as the sight of Tony leaning over his friend grayed out. He swayed as he cradled a shivering Bucky in his arms.
Tony’s gaze pops over to her. He didn’t realize he’d been staring at the platform, hoping against hope Steve would appear. “What’s that?” He hears himself say.
“Don’t, Tony,” Pep says. He spots the tears welling in her eyes but ignores them. He’s not ashamed of being an alpha. He can’t be. The way of the society and science has established the superiority of his nature. He won’t live hindered by it.
“That’s to be expected,” Bruce said. Steve knew he was trying to be comforting, but the way Bruce watched him, analyzed his movements, just felt like how a scientist might observe a subject – an animal or an insect under the dissecting microscope.
Steve stands up from the basket and goes to the side cabinet where he keeps a water pitcher and bowl for quick clean ups. He pours out the lukewarm water and notices that Tony picks up the garbage bin and brings it outside. When he returns the bin is pristine and doesn’t smell anymore.
“Printed out some of the best stuff that JARVIS found,” Bruce said and handed the thick wad to Steve. “You can read over it and then we could talk about it.”
A super soldier with super soldier serum and a bonding gland. They cut it out, time and time again. They left only the stem, the root of the plum sized gland near his collar bone so that the serum would heal him and it would grow back again and again. The pain was agony and it isn’t something he likes to dwell on. But the worst of it was – that the bond he had with Tony broke. The cut, the removal of his gland splintered his bond and he was left neutered in some ways. They tried to re-establish it, but failed. Probably because it was too soon, his gland wasn’t mature enough – that was Helen Cho’s theory. But they would never really find out.  Steve went on a mission, met Rumlow, and Wanda made a mistake.
“You are dead! Fuck you!” Rumlow snatches at the air and grabs Steve’s wrist – that’s when he finds it. The bracelet Clint gave Steve for emergencies. “What the fuck is this?”
She smiles at Steve but then turns to Tony. “You have to remember this. He’s not going to, he’s too far gone into the Transformation.”
When Tony touches his wings - his heart and soul sings. He resonates with the touch as if each caress becomes a part of his nerves, his flesh, and his existence.  He knows in some way that is a true perception of what is happening. He’s being defined by Tony, the bond is growing, developing, becoming stronger as they touch. He wants only to be with Tony, to forget the rest of his cares. As they fumble together, trying to find an easy way with Steve’s injured wings, he dismisses the pains, the torture he went through, he sets aside the idea of a Collapsing Event and what evil may be seeping into the mortal worlds.  He’s falling irrevocably into the waiting arms of sin and he does not care.
In the end they decide on a rugged beach with the ocean splashing against the shore. According to JARVIS the scene is a projection from a planet in the Stark Systems – one the Tony has his own mansion on. In the distance from where the table’s set an image of a beautiful white curving mansion can be seen. The virtual reality of the simulation astounds Steve.
Truth be told, though, Tony had seen the way Steve looked at him. Even when they were just hanging around, watching a movie in Tony’s private theater, he would catch Steve staring at him with a tender look of such love and trust that it felt like a little death. Something special, something unexplainable had happened and Tony missed it. He hates that the moment flashed by and, for all his genius, he never recognized it. How does someone fall in love with you from a far and you never know it? He asks himself this over and over.
“You cannot imagine,” Steve replied. He walked her to the door. “Thank you for listening, Nat. It’s good to have someone.”
He grappled against her, but the tiny movements only worked for her as she stroked his cock and then wrapped her other hand around his waist and then lower, pushing a finger into his ass. He screamed around the gag as Ross smirked. He shook his head, denying that it felt anything like a real orgasm. It felt dirty and ugly and he hated Ross and the vampire as he climaxed. It was weak and tore away at his integrity and honor. With self-abhorrence settling in his bones, he apologized to Tony.
“You’re not doing well, Steve,” Natasha said. “Your soul is shattered. All over the place. Are you sure you can-.”
“Experiments.” Steve closed his eyes and stilled the memories. Wanting to help his fellow Americans, wanting to save the world from a mad man. “Let me guess.” He opened his eyes. “Sokovia was devastated and they were enticed by the opportunity to help change things for the better.”
Steve nods. “Yeah, not a lot of water on that dump. Don’t get me wrong. I had a lot of friends there, still do. But since the war there’s nothing. No food, no water. People just eking by.”
“The wings are healing,” Steve says and his eyes are too heavy, his mouth too dry. He licks his sore lips. “Need to be in the water.”
“Hey, hey!” Tony searches his features, landing on his troubled eyes. “Listen. We have our lives to figure it all out. If you’re willing.”
“How do we know that it’s all about us anyhow?” Steve moves around pieces of the shattered fuselage for signs. “Maybe this is just here to throw us off.”
Steve looks more nauseous than Tony feels. “No, I -my last name has always been Rogers.” His face screws up like he doubts what he’s saying and then standing up, he brushes his hand on his pants. “Why do you want to know? It doesn’t matter, lots of people have the name Steve Rogers.”
“So, you hoped to travel to one of the Inner Regions to be a Residential Artist for one of the Elite Families?” Tony leans closer to him, his gaze intense and searching.
“Maybe you should start believing them,” Tony returned. The corner of Steve’s mouth upturned and Tony felt something hard and harsh ease through the bond. “You really are tense.”
“Trouble in paradise. Please don’t say this is a flash in the pan marriage Tony. That won’t be good for you. Steve seems like a nice guy. Is he not nice? Is he a jerk?”
“It’s awfully fast the way you’re offering this to him. You don’t really know him all that well,” Natasha commented as she zipped up the backpack.
Bruce stepped in to the weighted conversation. He finished chopping the vegetables and tossed them into a slow cooker. “The twins, Wanda and Pietro are doing well. They actually accepted the pack faster than I thought, though there is some resentment on their part concerning Tony.”
That elicited a small spurt of come and Tony smiled. He reached over to the table, knowing he would find lube there – and knowing that it would be from the modern world, not the world that once was. He popped open the cap and said, “I need you to relax.”
But the truth hurt. It tempted him. The truth. It asked him to believe in fairy tales. He didn’t start it, not knowingly. He didn’t even accept that he was doing it. But his hand like a teenager’s crept down to his flaccid penis and began a long slow stroke. He told himself he was doing it to see if he could get himself to respond. He worked it slow and easy. Lying to himself. Pretending he wasn’t thinking of the strings of his soul that were disconnected and needy, yearning. Telling himself that he didn’t think about broad shoulders and thick arms around him. Even as the thought materialized he grew hard. His breath gasped and he thrust into his hand. The calluses on his palms, on his fingertips sent sharp shivers through him and he played with it a little. Edging his one callus on his thumb along the tip of his erect cock, sliding a fingernail along the slit until he hissed in respond and felt a little precome spill out. He held back, letting the sweet anticipation and hunger eat away at him. He squeezed his cock, tormenting himself with need.
“As long as the UN doesn’t manipulate who we are and what we stand for,” Steve says. “I don’t want another SHIELD.”
“It’s okay. He’s with me. He told me where to find you,” Natasha said, her eyes were darker than he’d ever seen them.
When he glances over at Tony talking with Friday over his computer interface, Steve realizes he shows no signs of slowing down or resting for even a little while. Steve blames himself, the whole fiasco at the pier. He’d been so happy on the bike and then when they got to the shore, how Tony stood close to him, talked with him. It delighted Steve and that warm feeling he’d been experiencing for days now, deep in the hollow of his chest spread out. Watching Tony so relaxed with himself, so happy had given Steve hope that even if the implant upgrade failed or worse, Tony could be free, could be blissful – with Steve. It was damned selfish. Tony would call it ableist.
“A little bit of all three, of course,” Steve replies and cannot help but feel comfortable in his own skin again. Talking to someone who knows him to his soul hasn't ever been a luxury for Steve. Bucky has always known Steve, never chastised him, but always hid him.
Nothing shows him why or how Captain America survived, nor why he ended up in a flea bitten apartment with little to no support system and an occupation as a prostitute. “Well, something has to give.” Tony needs to find out what else is known by the government on Captain America’s disappearance. A little snooping never hurt anyone. But he needs to know where to snoop. There’s only one person who might be able to give him more information.
Steve stands up and starts to clear the table. He tries to sound casual about his query but doesn’t think he pulls it off at all. “When it almost leaked what did you do?”
Steve places a finger on Tony’s lips, feeling the bristles of his beard. “Shush. I want to prep you, would that be okay? I want to open you up for me.”
“Yeah,” Tony said. He watched it happen on television and on the streets as a human child. “Your perspective really changes once you end up undead.” As a child and a young adult, he’d spent most of his genius on building better weapons and restraints against vampire super strength. “Some of the time I think back and can’t believe how blind I was.”
“Oh, you don’t have to worry, mister Stark. Those are for the guards only. The 18704 isn’t allowed outside. From what I heard the last time 18704 was allowed those privileges was about 15 years ago.” He patted his ample belly. “Long before my time. 18704 tried to escape.”
“You kept it secret? All this time?” Steve huffs out a breath like he’s not believing a word Tony is saying.
“Oh, there must be something to tell. You look like that old war hero my dad used to go on about. Captain America. And come to think of it, wasn’t his name something like Rogers or Bucky or something.”
The land around them is settling in for a long winter’s slumber. Except for the sturdy pines, the trees are bare like gnarled bones reaching up to the steel gray sky. Steve doesn’t pay much mind to the landscape, instead he steadies an eye on Tony. The man is bundled up, he sees Pepper’s touch and he smiles. At the very least, Tony must have acquiesced to it in order to convince the woman to let him go on this journey.
“So, Pepper is strawberries. What’s Happy?” Steve asks. He hasn’t moved his leg, even as Tony gently follows the contours of it with his hand.
As Captain America he ran missions into the heart of Nazi territory, saw horrors unfold in front of him, took more bullets than he cares to remember, but something Ultron did to him qualifies as worse. He searches his memories, but he only finds holes, pits, an abyss of nothing when he chances upon the last moments he can recall.
“So do I,” he snaps and regrets it immediately. “You don’t seem to understand. I care. I cared about him, I loved him. I wanted him as my alpha from the very first time. He didn’t want me. It took so long to convince him, after SHIELD came down.” He wraps the pain and the sadness and the ache away. “We had too many chances and they all – they all disappeared. It’s over now, Nat. Just let it be. I know you want to go back to him. I see it. I won’t hold it against you. You can.”
“It seems to be something more,” Jane says. She isn’t teasing, she’s testing the waters to see if he wants to talk about it.
“We’ll talk tonight.” Stane squeezes Tony’s upper arm, then winks at Steve over the prince’s shoulder. He mouths ‘later’ at Steve and then excuses himself.
It’s Steve’s turn to emotionally collapse. His face long since gone pale, turns as white as a sheet. “I have to believe that he did it under the control of Hydra. He didn’t have a choice. He must have been brainwashed. I saw him not even know me, Tony. I saw it.”
“Yes. We -we talked. Surprisingly in the dreamscape. We can do this, Steve. It won’t be fun and it won’t be comfortable. I’m not going to call him Brother anytime soon. But a pack is a family. A family doesn’t abandon one another when it gets rough.” Tony dropped his hands. If Steve was going to escape, if he was going to cut their ties, he would do it now. There was no more argument. Tony pointed to the void around them where the unknown, the good and the evil lurked. “This is the endgame. Here. Now. We have to decide how we can face it. What’s best for not only the pack but for the Avengers. I can’t tell you how much my instincts tell me to race off like a maniac and do what I do best.”
Steve knelt by the silent armor and dropped his shield to the side. He grabbed at the faceplate and said, “JARVIS update on Iron Man.”
“Sorry about that Cap. It’s the way it is. It’s nothing personal, like I said before,” Rumlow said and slowly twisted the knife. “You think I should slice you sideways and open you up like a frog on a dissecting table. I could pull out your intestines, let them hang out there. Supposed to be an awful way to die.” He chuckled. “Did you see that during the war? Kids, boys, laying out with their hands over their guts crying for their mommas. Will you cry for your momma?” He shoved the knife in farther and Steve felt it tear through the skin on his back.
“Don’t move, don’t move,” Steve whispered and there was a horror in his voice that ate away at Tony’s last reserve.
“It’ll be close, but we could do it,” Pepper replies. “As long as you leave Jarvis here to help. I can pull in Natasha for security.”
“Tony,” Bruce said and frowned at him. Tony shrugged but the far away haunted look stayed. His gaze never really met Steve’s eyes.
Ross cleared his throat. “We’re not philosophers or justices of the Supreme Court. We’re not here to debate. We are here to protect this country and to uphold the laws that are in place.”
"Big ass? Who the hell has the big ass?" Bucky laughs as Sam swings forward to dump him into the turret of the tower.
“No, far from it,” Steven says. “He was kind, and he needed someone to fill a gap in his life. I fit.” He stops and moves slightly, the water sloshes. He shields himself from Tony’s hands. “Please, you don’t need to do this. I understand the ways, the rules of the Council.”
Steve ignored Ross. He’d been called worse in his day. He’d been a poor bisexual man in the middle of New York City in the 30s. During his youth he’d been besieged by prejudice and hatred. Sure, it had never been as bad as vampires, but the fact remained that the laws at the time put him in the same bucket as vampires. A perversion of the norm. A disgusting creature that only needed to be hunted down and thrown away, separated from the rest of the normal, beautiful society.
“You don’t have a say in the matter.” Her expression ices over. “Right now, you could be deemed not competent because of what you did to yourself.”
“I know you’re there. I can hear you breathing,” Tony says. He tries to get comfortable in bed and then asks, “What time of day is it? My circadian rhythm is all wonky again.”
“Of course, I know braille. I ended up getting my degrees when I was still effectively blind with no implant. While the profs did what they could to teach at a distance, I had to do a lot of my studying on my own. Jarvis actually arranged to have lots of books translated for me.” Tony lifts the book. “Haven’t touched some of these in years. Just lucky I had a few laying around here.”
“Stop with Dummy.” Estane had gripped Tony’s slim arms and shook him. “Listen to me. You want to be a good alpha? You have to fuck that omega, and beat him, and punish him. I’ll take you one of the Stalls.”
“It’s okay. It’s okay.” Tony cries, tears of pain he’s been holding in stain his face, and Steve holds him. “I’m here. I’m here.”
“He was and as you well know I am the beneficiary of my mother’s estate including all of the Carbonelli assets. That includes this omega. He’s now mine. We’re bonded.” He sips the drink, relishing his moment but not the simple citrus drink.
Tony stopped and stared at Steve as if the acquiescence stunned him. He scratched at his head, messing his perfectly coifed hair a bit. Clearing his throat, he cocked an eyebrow and then said, “Okay then. Let me see the brand thing.”
As he lies there in the sun, holding a lion no one else on Earth will know, Tony feels the warmth of Blu surround him. It saturates him, calms him, brings him peace. Blu doesn’t cool, but instead grows warmer still until he’s unbearable hot – as if his body temperature had always been too cold. Tony shifts away and gasps.
His First climbs up the last of the ladder and swings the tablet from her waist clip. She eyes Steven and then offers the tablet for Tony to review. “Isn’t that the tradition? He can work with Harry once we dock.”
“I should be able to. I’ve seen them in real life and it’s not like it’s a difficult engineering problem. Just give me about thirty minutes to do the math and then-.”
It's Darcy who appears at the top of the stairs, her hands are bloody and her eyes dark. "He wants you."
Darcy smiles at Tony and puts a hand on her hip. “Now, you come in here with our Sheriff, I don’t recall saying it would be all right to do that, sir.”
“Mostly asteroids. There’s a belt not far and it’s shipped in.” She points to the bath. “I expect you to usually shower before and after each client. Clean yourself out with the hose. You’ll always use protection, but you never know if these things break.”
Blu rumbles a purr at him and walks over to the shoreline, waiting for Tony to get up. “I’m coming.” His reluctance isn’t about leaving behind this sanctuary. He’s only been here a little more than 24 hours. It’s just the long walk back, the hilly climb – that’s all. He will get out of here, leave all of this behind, and go back his normal life. He freed the lion. He wants to go back. It is a good thing. The path downward to the base of the hill weighs on him, the gravity heavy in his chest. It tugs at the arc reactor, causes his ribs to ache all the more.
