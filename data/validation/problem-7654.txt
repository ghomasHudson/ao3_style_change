“Um… what’re we going to do with all these?” he asked from behind the pile.
Tony’s expression turned downright devious. “They’re not going in that end.”
Next thing he knows, Steve is leaning over him. He looks worried, but Tony opts instead to focus on how ridiculous he looks with snow clinging to his eyebrows.
He kept running things over in his mind again. Was Tony really put off by what he saw? Steve wasn’t one to let embarrassment bother him too much; so this kind of… shame was new to him. He shouldn’t care so much about what Tony thought of him, yet the feeling wouldn’t go away.
Steve’s words replayed in his head: “I… want… you…”
Steve looked indecisive for a moment and Tony felt his chest freeze up until Steve finally nodded and said, “Yeah, sure. Tomorrow’s Christmas, after all.” As though that explained everything.
Steve felt something like a jolt in his ass as the hose or whatever the hell it was went taut. He wasn’t sure what to expect until he felt something slightly warm and wet enter him. He couldn’t help tensing up at the unfamiliar sensation.
It was almost like the mask that Steve had seen him put up so effortlessly in public. A few months ago, Steve would’ve been too frustrated with Tony’s behavior to bother looking beyond it. But now, after he’d worked with the man and gotten to know him better, he could tell when Tony was trying to distract from something making him uncomfortable. Steve wasn’t willing to back down on this, that was for sure.
Tony stepped back away from the door. It led to a sealed chamber between the current room and the larger lab, but Tony wasn’t taking any chances.
Steve opened one eye just to get a sense of what Tony was about to do. He walked around to where Steve was precariously exposed with something that looked like a hose in his gloved hands. Steve wondered if he should ask but then thought better of it. He flinched at the first sign of something prodding at his hole and then quickly relaxed like Tony had told him to.
Tony has almost drifted off when Steve’s breathing returns to normal.
Needless to say, Tony wants to climb this guy like a tree. Not that he would, seeing as how Tony does
“Gradual increase in heart rate, but still within what SHIELD records estimate as a safe level for his enhanced physiology. An increase in blood pressure as well. Also within estimated safe levels.”
“What!?” Steve watched in disbelief as Natasha headed toward the women’s locker room. She was just going to leave him like this? Was this some kind of elaborate prank? “Nat! Wait, you can’t just leave me here like this!”
Tony went into a rant about how, apparently, the apparatus was fully maneuverable, tiltable, and could be raised to any height needed. There were also supports on the side, which Tony said with a wink would come into play later.
The man shakes his head. “No, it’s just… are you sure you’re okay? You smell like...”
The bizarre spiral shape was slowly uncoiling, revealing itself to be some kind of insect with a long body and, Steve noticed when he looked closer at how it was moving across the floor, a ton of legs. What was most alarming about it was its size; what he assumed was its head was larger around than his arm and its actual length was difficult to assess with most of it still coiled together.
That’s when everything comes back to him—the jet getting hit, ending up in the middle of nowhere, and Tony’s injury… He tries shifting his shoulders, and sure enough, the lancing pain that he’d felt before is gone. Of all the crazy things, Steve’s unorthodox method apparently worked, which means—
Steve nodded fervently. “Please, Tony. It feels so good right now, but I want
Steve groaned at Tony’s words. His cock had flagged a bit when Tony had started strapping him to the table, but now he was getting hard again.
pretty good with his mouth. Not like he’s going to bring that up at the moment.
Steve abruptly stands up and nods. “Okay. Sounds like a plan.” He heads for his discarded uniform belt slung over the chair by the fire.
“There’s more?”
Tony raised an eyebrow. “Kyushu? Wow, that’s a ways away from here. You fly up here or what?”
Tony ran a hand through his hair in frustration as he looked over the holographic diagram. It looked like he’d need to build a new version of the suit to implement the kind of foolproof seal he was looking for. That meant going back to the drawing board, which would take a week at least…
Steve moaned against Tony’s mouth. Even through his shirt, Tony could feel the heat from Steve’s dick against his abdomen. He reached down to stroke himself a bit before pulling back to position himself.
“Better?”
The man gave him a look like he was crazy. “It’s Christmas Eve.”
He tried gently shaking the man’s shoulders. “Hey, you with me?”
“Mmm, yeah,” he responded lazily as he continued to work his pants off. It was getting a bit difficult with the creature pushing against him, but he finally managed it. With his pants gone, all that were left were his white boxers soaked with precome. He always got so wet, and now everything was turned up to eleven. He reached for the waistband.
“There we go,” Tony said in a soft, reverent tone. He smiled down at Steve before saying, “Do you have any idea of how gorgeous you are like this? Wish you could see yourself right now. Such a perfect mess for me. Never seen you give yourself up so completely like this before.” He reached down and stroked his own cock once with the hand covered in lube and moaned. “I could get off just watching you like this. But that wouldn’t be as much fun, now would it?”
Tony Stark?!” Bucky slaps the table with his hand. “I never would’ve guessed the guy was an omega!”
“Tony? What’s wrong?”
“Are you okay, by the way? You were pretty drunk last night.”
Chuckling, Tony took another sip of his drink. “So you arrived late last night and then ran into my sorry ass, huh?”
He lets the waves of pleasure wash over him as he relaxes into the sheets. He’s hard, but he doesn’t even care about that right now. It feels good just to be used like this. And sure, Steve isn’t
Bucky huffs out a breath, sounding annoyed. “Okay, there is definitely something you aren’t telling me, here. You mind clueing me in? Something happened after the not-interview?” Bucky shakes Steve’s foot. “Come on, man. You know you can tell me anything.”
Needless to say, he isn’t in a good mood as he marches to the elevator.
Tony glanced back at the screen. Steve could handle himself, but…
did, you mean?”
Steve shrugs. “Didn’t want to crowd your space while you were recovering.”
Natasha did a feint to Steve’s right, which he caught, but then she twisted under him when he went left. Next thing he knew, Natasha was under him and Steve instantly knew he was in trouble. Within the next few seconds, he ended up flat on his back. Natasha took the opportunity to get on top of him, straddling his thighs. She was smirking at him, again.
“We haven’t even gotten started and you’re about ready to go off, huh?” Tony’s hand that had been on his thigh moved down to caress the curve of his ass. “Don’t worry, I’m almost ready.”
Tony just raised an eyebrow. He’d shifted from apprehensive to inquisitive, which was also a bad sign. “I’ve been going about all of this wrong, haven’t I?” He took one step closer to Steve. “It really didn’t harm you?”
Tony froze, which was already a dead giveaway. Just the mention of his name made Tony think back to how Steve had sounded when he was begging the alien bug for more, when he was overcome by pleasure.
Tony continued to move it around while murmuring praise; saying how good Steve was at taking the plug. How nicely stretched his hole was. He pulled it slowly, stopping for a bit at the widest part, seemingly listening for Steve’s harsh breathing. Steve cried out when he finally pulled it loose with a wet pop.
“Not fast enough,” Steve said. His jaw was set, which was not a good sign.
look very American,” Tony said with a smirk, his eyes drifting down toward Steve’s biceps. “100% American beef,” he added.
“I’m fine.” Tony shrugged as much as he could in his position. “Pretty used to this, anyway.”
Steve nodded. “Thanks.” He took the mask and promptly strapped it around his face. He wasn’t wearing his helmet, which was probably for the best. It wasn’t designed for hazmat situations, either.
“Because it’s going to sound ridiculous. Like I just said.”
“I’m well aware, but...” Bruce rubbed at his forehead in annoyance. “I still feel like I should’ve known better.”
“Okay, so maybe that wasn’t the best sales pitch. But trust me on this, Steve. This will be
“Can’t even tell me a little bit about what you’re planning?”
devious under that wholesome exterior, aren’t you?”
could see him. See how badly he wanted to be taken.
The man looked puzzled for a second. “I’m not trying to steal your organs, geez. And keep it down, would you? If anyone else hears us, we might both get kicked out.”
It took him a few moments to untangle himself from the sheets so that he could sit up. Once he had his back against the headboard, he let himself relax as he slipped his hand under the elastic of his boxers. He should’ve been ashamed, but he couldn’t help it. The dream had been so vivid and he could still see it so clearly in his mind’s eye: Tony gazing down at him with feigned indifference as he fucked Steve’s face with abandon.
“I don’t even fucking care anymore,” the omega says, his face slack with arousal. “You know what? I
Steve finally managed to get some actual information out of him after one of their weekly team meetings. Tony had just shown off a new design for some of the team’s weapons to solicit some input, and now that they were finished and the rest of the team had left, well...
“I think Tony’s avoiding me,” Steve admitted, feeling like a kid complaining to his ma.
“Hey… do you need some help?” Steve winces at how rough his voice comes out.
Tony lets out a sigh when Steve finally pushes a lubed finger past his entrance. He’s impressed with how good Steve seems to be at this. Makes Tony wonder how often he’s done this in the past. He was pretty sure Steve wasn’t even into men. Maybe he isn’t? If he apparently got into the habit of doing this with his comrades way back in the day… well, it could have just been the sort of thing where he was helping out a teammate. That’s what Tony tells himself to hold onto his sanity for the moment.
“It will be necessary, believe me.” Tony planted a kiss on his forehead from the side. “Besides, this isn’t the first time I tied you up, now is it?”
“Something else the matter?”
Steve did as he was told, knowing already what was going to happen. Though he wasn’t surprised when Tony grabbed the hem of his loose sweatpants and pulled them down along with his boxers, he still couldn’t help the gasp of relief as his cock sprung free and slapped against his stomach. He’d been leaking a fair amount of precome before; he was surprised it hadn’t shown through his sweatpants yet. But now it was there plain to see, and Steve could feel his blush spreading down to his neck. Out here in Tony’s workshop like this, as opposed to the bedroom, he felt like a specimen on display.
“JARVIS?” he asked through gritted teeth.
“Why do you say that?”
Tony mumbles something he hopes sounds like agreement.
Tony glances up at those earnest blue eyes. It seems wrong to lie, so he says, “Honestly? Feeling like shit.”
“Strip,” Tony said as he set up what looked like a pullout tray attached to the bottom of the table.
Bruce crossed his arms, eyes narrowed. “JARVIS let me in a minute ago. And announced my arrival.”
On top of everything else, his elevator companion is an
The next few minutes are a blur after Steve gently sets Tony down against the wall next to the door. Steve wastes no time getting the door closed again and moving around what seems to be the cabin’s single room. Tony feels useless just sitting here. He could at least start a fire. On the other hand, the ache all down his back is getting worse. Seems like a good time to just rest his eyes, instead.
“T-Tony?” For the moment, the creature’s movements had stopped and Steve’s mind cleared somewhat. Tony was here, which he knew was a good thing. But… it was hard to remember
“Of course, Cap. Any time.”
“What do you mean, exactly? Is that why it was able to affect me despite the serum usually protecting me from other things like this?”
Tony grunts in acknowledgement. A few seconds later, Steve’s other hand is running through his hair and Tony has to resist the urge to purr like a cat.
Steve tried to imagine what would have happened if he hadn’t been there. Knowing Tony, he might have tried to go in by himself without the armor if he felt there was no better option. And if he had, well… Steve didn’t know the details, but he knew at the very least that Tony’s heart wasn’t the healthiest.
“S-Steve?’ Tony managed to get out through his haze of confusion and quickly building arousal.
“I’m not gonna be mad at you if you didn’t get the job, man. I mean, I know more than anyone how hard you worked for it. But sometimes these things don’t work out, you know?”
“Sounds reasonable.”
Tony shrugged. That was the last thing he wanted to talk about. “Yeah, this is a business trip. Trying to make some deals with some Japanese electronics manufacturers and all that. Pretty boring, to be honest.”
That’s when he notices Steve on the floor sitting by the door. He’s back in his uniform and upon closer inspection, Tony realizes he’s asleep. The sight sets off a pang of something in his chest, but he ignores it for the moment.
Tony’s gloved hand was back on his thigh. “Relax, champ. Just some sterile gel that’ll ease the way for what’s coming next. And believe me, you’ll want to be ready for that.”
dying in some shack in Middle-of-Fucking-Nowhere, Canada.”
“Won’t let them have you,” Steve murmurs into his neck.
Ignoring his raging hard on, Tony tried speaking to Steve again.
Tony was here for him. He’d take care of him. Steve just wished that Tony was lying next to him and not ten feet away locked up in the armor.
“Well…” Tony glanced away briefly before looking back at Steve. His pupils were dilated, almost completely overtaking the brown. “I told you this is nanotech. It can do… a lot. Right now they’ve taken the form of something compact to make it easier to move inside you. But now that they’ve settled, they could… expand.”
Steve tried to think through his post-orgasm haze. His thoughts felt hazy, like his mind was full of soft, warm clouds. The intense pleasure radiating from his skin was like rays of bright light piercing through his clouded mind. It was so much easier to just let himself give into it and let himself
He mostly zones out aside from making sure Steve stays on the route he charted out in the HUD. There’s a persistent ache all along his back, which he knows isn’t a good sign. The cold temperature is probably acting like a giant ice pack. Tony can appreciate that, but it’s not so great for Steve. As always, Steve grits his teeth and doesn’t show any outward signs of discomfort. Tony’s known him long enough by now that he’s learned that even Steve has his limits, though. Not to mention that this cold can’t be pleasant for him.
. He was floating as pleasure filled his entire body. It burned through his mind until there was nothing else.
“Dammit,” he said as he backed away. “It got me with something.”
“Who knows?” Bruce takes a sip of his water. “No one’s even sure what the evolutionary purpose of this would be, let alone if someone could have multiple super compatible partners.”
Steve considers the man’s offer. Ruts aren’t exactly pleasant spent alone. And, well, if he’s offering… “You’re really sure?”
“Mmm, yeah, just like that, Steve,” Tony coaxed him as he continued rubbing off on him. He set a rhythm; pushing down onto Steve’s cock and then pulling off to rub against Steve’s swollen belly. The lube kept the slide against Steve’s tight skin easy as Tony pressed his lips against Steve’s chest every time he rubbed against him.
There’s a pause. “...Oh. Is that all? I mean, they’ll call you back, right?”
“I just met with Steve.”
“That’s what I like to see,” Tony said as he lowered himself slowly so that he was hovering over Steve. “You’re being so, so good for me, Steve.”
drunk. The last time he’d been this drunk, he was pretty sure he had been drinking out of a red plastic cup with Rhodey giving him disapproving looks from the other end of the frat house’s ratty couch.
In retrospect, Tony blames the fact that he and Steve were in the middle of a rather heated argument for him not noticing the first warning of an approaching missile.
He feels the mattress shift a bit before Steve says, “It’ll be tight, but I’ll go slow. Is that okay?”
Steve squirmed against his bindings. He looked lost in a haze of lust as his bleary gaze met Tony’s. “Please, Tony… I’m so close, I can’t take it anymore.”
He hears the sound of something being opened and some rustling before Steve says, “This might be a bit uncomfortable, but I’ll take it slow. Okay?”
He has to mentally shake himself before answering. He’s letting himself think with his dick already, which can’t be a good sign. “Yeah, just… not happy with all this.” He gestures at everything around them. “Apparently a transformer just blew.”
The creature was winding around toward his back as it made its way lower. Each leg felt like hundreds of points of pleasure racing like lightning across his nerves. His hand was still on his cock, which was still so hard it almost hurt. Steve felt like he could only hold on as his cock continued leaking precome against his stomach.
“How much time?”
Tony would shrug, but moving seems like a bad idea. “Snow’s kind of taking the edge off, to be honest.”
“God, Tony. You really are full.” He pushes his hand against Tony’s swollen belly, and Tony’s answering moan is music to his ears. “You’re taking me so well. Such a good omega. Letting me fill you up like this.” His omega. His perfect, wonderful omega.
“Don’t think I’ll ever get enough,” Steve said solemnly. Like it was a confession.
Steve quickly locks the door and then joins Tony on the couch. He’s hit with a sense of déja vu—this whole situation feels as surreal as everything in the elevator did. Just thinking back to it makes Steve’s face warm. He’s been trying not to think about it all week. And now he’s sitting next to the man, though thankfully without the overwhelming omega scent accompanying him.
Steve shook his head. “It’s fine, Doctor Banner. No need to keep apologizing. I knew the possible dangers when I went in to deal with the threat.” Well, okay, he thought he’d considered all of the possible dangers. He couldn’t be blamed for not anticipating the actual situation. “It sounds like I’m fine, and the whole mess has been cleaned up, right? No harm done.”
The thing was, Steve enjoyed getting fucked. Absolutely loved it. While he was thankful for the strength the serum had granted him, sometimes he wanted to let go. Tony had recognized it, too. The way that Steve naturally took charge in the field. How Steve sometimes just wanted to get away from that in his down time. In bed, he could trust Tony to take care of him. To direct his considerable strength toward the purpose of their mutual enjoyment.
Once they hit the smaller alleys off of the main road, Tony really did turn into a kid in a candy store. Steve could barely keep up as he watched Tony go from storefront to storefront, eyes wide as he looked at the various components they had on sale.
Falling back onto the pillows, Tony gave into the endorphin rush. Unfortunately, his brain was quickly waking up from the haze of sleepiness. It wasn’t even surprising when the rush of guilt hit him like a ton of bricks.
. It’s no wonder he was able to fill Tony like this.
“Mmkay,” the man said before seemingly passing out and going limp against the door.
...Tony’s hand was on his dick before his eyes were even open, he was so turned on. It only took a few strokes to get himself off to the quickly fading memory of Steve writhing underneath him.
good. It turned out that he didn’t need alien bug pheromones to be able to have multiple orgasms.
He ran a hand through his sweaty hair in embarrassment.
As Steve pulled Tony close by his shirt collar and kissed him for what felt like the thousandth time that night, he couldn’t help grinning against Tony’s red, swollen lips.
Tony lets Steve take the lead because anything that uses his back muscles would just be painful at this point. He went commando, which means that he’s completely naked without the undersuit. He can’t even summon up the energy to feel self-conscious as Steve finally removes it.
“Ugh…” The omega doubles over and slumps to the floor.
Before he even realized it, the fourth object hit his prostate. He was so close already, and it was driving him crazy. Even as the object started to emerge out of his entrance, he couldn’t quite reach his climax. With Tony’s help, it didn’t take long for it to come out, leaving Steve gasping in frustration. And then he felt a warm, callused hand wrap around his dick and he gasped as that tipped him over the edge.
Tony forced himself back into the seat in front of the monitor room’s main console. His leg was tapping rapidly against the floor as his hands fidgeted restlessly. Situations like this were his own personal hell. He hated watching someone get hurt due to his own negligence and not being able to do anything about it. He trusted JARVIS to monitor Steve’s vitals, but… that didn’t mean that Steve was okay. The second the armor was ready, he was going to bust in there. He didn’t care if he had to tear down half the lab to save Steve.
Steve crossed his arms. “I’m not even sure of what we’re doing, here.”
Tony turned and nearly fell out of his chair when he saw Bruce standing on the other side of a table, as though as he’d appeared out of thin air.
good.” Tony slips a hand down to run a hand along Steve’s cock. “Bet I’m not the only one feeling good.”
As Tony headed out of the room, he resolutely ignored the voice in his head calling him a coward.
“Even stuffed full of nanites, you’re a damned menace,” Tony said as he shook his head. He stepped forward and ran a gloved hand along Steve’s leg, moving up toward his abdomen. “Let me help you.” His hand settled softly on the still sizeable curve of Steve’s belly. “Can’t let you do all of the work, after all.”
Tony stepped back. “Pretty much.” He turned toward a holographic screen that Steve hadn’t noticed until now. “On my count, in 3… 2… 1…”
Tony’s face lit up immediately. “You won’t regret it, Steve. I promise you. It’s like the ultimate dildo… combined with an enema but without the mess!”
Steve nodded. “Yeah, down in Kyushu, actually. It’s a really small town, but… it’s nice.” He rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. He usually wasn’t this nervous when talking about his job. He
Steve glanced up at the bright lights overhead. This guy must’ve been really out of it. “Not really, no. You’re just really drunk.”
For once, Tony can’t think of what to say. Usually he’d have something snarky on the tip of his tongue to diffuse the tension that has suddenly settled over the small cabin room. The longer the moment draws on, the more an odd sense of anticipation simmers under his skin.
“Buck,” Steve says, deadpan.
He gasped when he felt the eggs moving inside of him again. He thought maybe he’d gotten used to them, but they felt different once they started moving. Probably something to do with how they changed shape, as Tony had explained.
“Tony…” Steve groaned from a few feet away.
Steve did as he was told, heading around into a part of the workshop he hadn’t paid much attention to before. When he finally found Tony, he stopped dead in his tracks.
“Of course!” Tony ran a hand through his hair in frustration. “Geez, I’m not being very considerate, am I? Here you are sweating up a storm and I haven’t even offered you anything to drink.” He winced as he pushed himself off of Steve, and they groaned in unison when the head of Steve’s cock finally pulled free. Tony gave him an apologetic smile. “Guess I got carried away, seeing you like this.”
a new one.”
“And our fault for storing an unknown alien creature without more precautions.” Tony stopped his pacing to pinch the bridge of his nose again. “Looking back, I’m not even sure why the hell we bothered—”
pretty damn hot.”
Steve nodded. “Very good.”
Steve’s laughter turned nervous. With Tony, chances were that he’d walk into the workshop the next day and find Tony working on an actual fucking machine.
By the time JARVIS called him down to the workshop, he had already been debating giving in a third time. He breathed a sigh of relief as the workshop’s doors opened for him.
He turned his head so he could just see Tony. “I’m done. Really, Tony.”
“And the sex afterward is part of it, too?” he can’t help asking.
With the power out, the building’s state-of-the-art air filtration system isn’t working either. Even then, Tony didn’t think he’d be
She was facing him now, looking like she was ready for a fight. “I wouldn’t worry yourself too much, Steve. It’s Stark. You know how he can be. He’s as mercurial as a cat sometimes.”
“Steve. Come on. How long have we known each other? Nothing is dumber than some of the shit we’ve done.”
“Oh, fuck,” Steve managed to get out, his voice rasping and heavy.
The creature’s body wrapped around Steve’s torso lifted slowly, revealing Steve’s huge, hard cock—just as Tony remembered it. It was flushed red as copious amounts of precome ran from the tip, down to his balls.
Figures that on today, of all days, Tony runs into this mystery Adonis. Well, at least he has something for the spank bank when he gets home. Every cloud has a silver lining, and all that.
It’s amazing how quickly Steve goes from opening his eyes to smoothly rolling from sitting to standing, his pose set for a fight. Sometimes Tony forgets how gracefully Steve can move. Once his eyes settle on Tony, he relaxes.
“That’s its pheromones, or something like that, Steve! Whatever it’s doing to you, you have to resist it. You hear me? I’ll be down there as soon as I can. Just… hang on until then, okay?”
This was where Steve liked to spar with Natasha, but seeing as how she was also okay with tying him up to teach him a lesson… “Fine.” He pulled back from Tony to settle down on the mat and gave him a look. “I’m not even sure I care anymore, after the day I’ve had.”
“Oh god,” he said with a groan as the first egg started vibrating as it brushed past his prostate. He could feel his cock start thickening up again, painfully.
questions. It’s a mark of how exhausted he is that he decides to save them for later. After they get out of this, though, he plans to get to the bottom of this.
Shaking his head, Tony kept laughing. “You must be rubbing off on me.” He ran a hand through his hair before turning away. “Let me just get a few things ready and get a new pair of gloves.”
“Don’t wanna talk about it,” Steve mumbles from under the magazine.
Steve thinks he manages to mumble out something that could be a ‘sorry’ before pulling back. It’s an odd sensation, with his whole body feeling so light. He nearly loses his balance because his hips are moving of their own accord. Dizzy, he gazes down to find his knot fully inside Tony. Heat radiates from where they’re connected to the rest of his body.
He’s not prepared for when Bucky snatches the magazine away from his face.
“Oh yeah?” Steve raised an eyebrow at him. “And so modest, too,” he said with a smirk.
Tony had seen him like no one ever had before. His memories were hazy, but Steve could recall enough to know that he’d been completely shameless. He could only imagine what he might have said in the absence of his inhibitions.
Eventually, Tony ended up dragging Steve into his frenzy as he tried to ask shopkeepers questions about various things. Steve did his best to translate for him, though sometimes it seemed like the language of electronics nerds transcended all barriers.
When he glanced over at Tony, he was met with Tony’s own gaze directed back at him under dark eyelashes. Feeling his face heat up, he glanced away quickly.
Tony moved his hand away to find Bruce giving him a look like
The room settles into a calm quiet that’s only interrupted by Steve’s grunts as he continues to push into Tony.
The man slowly raises his head, and his eyes lock with Steve’s. Even in the dim lighting, Steve can see how much the man’s eyes are dilated, the brown almost completely taken over by black. Steve can sympathize—he can only imagine how obviously his own scent betrays his interest. He’s been sweating heavily ever since he first caught a whiff of the omega. It’s almost like he’s going into rut, which would be ridiculous. He can count how many times that’s happened on one hand.
“What the hell are you doing, Cap?”
“I heard you get in late last night, punk. I thought you just got stuck in an elevator? That’s what you said in your text.”
“Oh…” Tony hopes that makes Steve blush even more. The mental image alone is great. “Well, I’ll still take it slow.”
The door opened to a hallway filled with lockers, which Steve knew from the information card he’d been given was the locker room. He slowly made his way to the locker matching the number on his keycard while doing his best to support the man. When he finally reached his locker, he carefully settled the man on the ground while he opened the locker to stash his duffel bag in the cramped space. When he glanced up to find a pair of slippers with a note that politely requested that he leave his shoes in the locker, he realized he had a bit of a problem. There was only one pair of slippers, and the man he’d helped up here was still wearing his very fancy, clearly expensive shoes.
That, of all things, makes Steve blush.
“Oh, huh.” Tony took a sip from his coffee and gazed out the window of their cafe over the busy Tokyo street. He looked back to Steve. “So you teach kids English?”
Without another word, Steve kneels down and moves to help Tony up. It’s slow-going and uncomfortable, but eventually Steve manages to get his arm around Tony’s shoulder and hefts him up.
The person next to him stirred before trying to push himself up. Who was this guy? Was he his kidnapper? Were they shipping him somewhere to harvest his organs?! He glanced toward the light at the other end of the tube or chamber or whatever the hell it was and tried to frantically crawl toward it. Unfortunately, he got tangled up in the other occupant’s feet and fell forward on his face.
Tony groaned as he freed his cock from its confines. He glanced at the vitals to make sure that Steve was still okay before wrapping a hand around himself. The suit wouldn’t be ready for another ten minutes, and it wasn’t like there was anything else Tony could do until then. Might as well reach new heights of depravity while he was at it.
“You’re perfect for me, Tony, so perfect,” he repeats as he speeds up his thrusts. His balls are already drawing up, both heavy and tight as they brush against Tony’s ass. “I’m so close. God, Tony, you feel so fucking good.”
Speaking of Tony, he was startled by the sound of him swearing loudly into the comm.
He didn’t know what he expected, but what he found himself looking at definitely wasn’t it. There was something shiny—a black coloring that gave off a purple reflection in the low light—coiled up against the side of the cabinet. It was shaped like a perfect spiral, and Steve wasn’t quite sure just what he was looking at.
“Wait,” Bruce said. Steve stopped with his hand on the doorknob. “He hasn’t said anything to you at all?”
By the time Steve starts on his belt, his gaze drifts down to find a truly tantalizing sight: the omega on his back, his legs bent in the air and his pants halfway off. A fresh wave of omega scent—sweet and floral, with the added tanginess of slick—hits Steve. He’s reminded of how he’s been in a fairly long dry spell as far as dating and sex go. The last thing he imagined when he walked into this building for an interview was that he’d put an end to that dry spell tonight.
His life is over. There’s no other way to look at things. He sighs into the art supplies catalog he has draped over his face. He’d been tempted to do a Google search for ‘so you went for an interview and ended up fucking the CEO?’ but had a feeling that wouldn’t lead him anywhere useful.
Steve started pushing his boxers down. It was getting difficult to keep paying attention to Tony’s voice.
He heard Tony chuckle again. “Yeah, it’ll take some getting used to. But that wasn’t even the best part.”
Steve glances down briefly at his paint-stained shirt and jeans. He wasn’t exactly expecting a guest. “W-what are you doing here?”
“Yeah…” Tony glances toward one of the floor to ceiling windows of the penthouse. That alpha is somewhere out there in the city, and Tony can’t stop thinking about him. “I sent him home with Pepper, but you know how I tend to intimidate people.”
“Mhmm,” Steve hummed back.
“Can you just… get me out of these? Natasha said you have the key.”
“Fuck, you’re huge,” Tony says breathlessly. He pushes back against Steve on his next thrust and they both moan in unison.
It turned out he wasn’t in a room at all. It was some kind of enclosed space with a little bit of light coming from the direction of his feet. That was weird enough; then he glanced down to see someone asleep at his side. That must’ve been who he heard.
Tony sighed dramatically. “If it means it gets me some faster, then yes.”
“You know what? Maybe we should table this conversation for later,” spilled out of Steve’s mouth before he could stop himself.
And the man’s face, well… Steve told himself he wasn’t helping this random salaryman-looking guy because he was attractive. Still, it wasn’t like he could deny that the man was devastatingly handsome. His hair was in disarray, but had clearly been styled to look like it was messy on purpose. There was some evidence of a mustache that probably needed to be kept in check. Besides all that, there was just something about this man’s face that drew Steve in.
“Which means?” He could have asked JARVIS to replay the recorded footage, but he wasn’t exactly keen on reliving that moment.
Steve shook his head. “Not for the past day or so.” He pushed away from the table and headed for the door.
“Only if I get to watch,” Steve added with a small smirk. He was gratified when Tony nearly choked on his own breath.
He still wasn’t sure what to expect from this kind of hotel by the time he’d walked up to the neon blue sign outside of the building. Well, no way to find out unless he went in. He marched through the sliding doors into the bright lobby like he would have marched onto the field back during his boot camp days.
was the one that might turn green and very, very angry.
“As tempting as it is to just sink down on that nice, big cock of yours, I’ve got this all planned out. So just bear with me for a bit more, okay?”
Steve reached back to pat Tony’s side. “I’m not going to die from lack of orgasms, Tony. Really, it’s fine.”
He needs a cold shower. That, and a nice night with some of his favorites from his sex toy collection. As he’s thinking over which vibrator he’ll start with, the elevator starts slowing down. Glancing up at the number, he resists the urge to sigh. Fucking floor 52—he’s not even halfway to the garage.
Shaking her head, Natasha turned her face toward the gym’s large windows. “I think that’s enough for today.”
“So how about you?” Steve asked from across the table. “Sounds like you’re here on some pretty serious business.”
Tony takes pity on him and holds in his laugh. “I feel a hell of a lot better. So you know what? Your crazy plan worked.”
Steve undoes the button on his pants and starts on the zipper but stops, feeling sheepish.
“Nah, I’m good. Honestly, I think I blend in more in this than I would in anything else.”
Tony watched in horror as Steve proceeded to remove his undershirt while the creature crawled over him. He needed to get Steve out of there.
“Oh, yeah, this is a design I’ve been working on. No idea how Natasha got them out of the workshop, unless…” Tony ran a hand through his hair. “Wow, yeah. They both really got us good.”
She shot in an unimpressed look. “You sure? Seems like your mind is actually a few floors up from here.”
The lines on the page in front of him blurred as Steve’s eyes unfocused. He’d been on edge all afternoon, ever since Tony had instructed him to keep himself nice and open for what he had planned. While this wasn’t his first time using a butt plug, this was his first time keeping it in for more than an hour or two.
When Steve returns, he’s holding a small tube. That’s all Tony sees before he feels the mattress sink under Steve’s weight.
He groans when one of Steve’s hands moves down to the swell of his stomach. Feeling Steve’s hands over the stretched skin is deeply satisfying. Eventually, Tony brings one of his hands up to place over Steve’s. Steve hums into Tony’s neck. He sounds as content as Tony feels. He’s not sure how long they spend like that. Steve’s knot is still going strong and Tony’s tired cock throbs pleasantly from where it sits against the jut of his round belly.
“It’s not that bad…”
“You are not going to die, Tony,” Steve says. His tone is surprisingly firm.
Pleasure shot through Steve’s nerves before he even realized what was happening. His eyes flew open and he cried out as the thing inside him started to vibrate right up against his prostate.
“Pretty sure your Ma always told you to look at people when you’re talking to ‘em.” Bucky raises an eyebrow at him, clearly unimpressed.
“Sir, Dr. Banner is calling.”
“Tony!”
Tony hesitated for a moment before answering, “No. Tell him that he can contact me if he needs anything.”
Natasha raised an eyebrow. “Don’t forget the leg press incident.”
Steve started approaching it slowly. “I’m not really sure, to be honest. It’s curled up against the wall or something.”
He grunted as he pulled down on the weight, his body straining against the weights he’d set.
“There we go,” Tony said in a soothing tone. “Just like that.” He ran a hand along Steve’s thigh almost as though he was rewarding him. “You’re being so good for me, Steve.” He glanced up from what he was doing to meet Steve’s eyes. “You’re always perfect for me, aren’t you?” He added with a chuckle.
Tony groans again as he reaches up to pinch the bridge of his nose. Fuck his good intentions. Seriously.
So Steve had decided to let the man share his little capsule with him for the night. Which was crazy, he knew. For all he knew this man was a serial killer, though Steve seriously doubted it. Bucky would’ve smacked him across the head back when he was taller than Steve for doing something like this. Bucky always told him he had a hero complex with his need to save people. And, well, if that was the case, then so be it.
“Alright. Just give me a heads up.” Bruce gave him one last look over his shoulder before he stepped through the workshop doors.
“What did happen to the creature, anyway? I was unconscious when Tony carried me out.”
Steve puts his face in his hands as he rests his elbows on his lap. “Fiiiine. But I need to eat something first.”
“You’re damn right, I am!” Tony tried to think back to the night before, but he came up blank. He remembered drinking way too much at shabu shabu with his clients. After that was a giant blur, though. Served him right for getting drunk off of his ass in a foreign country. He held up his hands. “Look, I don’t know what you want from me, but I’m really attached to my organs. I can spare a kidney at most, but that’s it.”
Steve just glared at him. “I think Natasha and Bruce set us up.”
“Sorry,” Tony said as he kept his attention on Steve’s ass. “Just seeing if I can make it easier for the next one.”
Natasha elbowed him in the side. “Whatever is bothering Stark, I’m sure he’ll get over it soon.”
, then.” He started gently pushing Steve back toward the table. “In that case…”
Panting heavily, he could only lie still and groan softly as the object continued to travel further inside him.
Caught between so many sensations, Steve felt like he was building up to something amazing. As the creature kept teasing at his asshole, he rutted against its underbelly and cried out in pleasure as sweet liquid dripped down his chin and neck.
Tony reaches up to run a hand through Steve’s hair. “You know how hot this is?”
Once the doors had closed, Tony slumped back in his seat. “JARVIS: Unmute.”
because Steve, devious bastard that he is, shifts his hand so that he’s pressing both of their dicks against the taut, stretched skin of Tony’s stomach. The mixed sensations of his sensitive cock against his tender skin are too much.
“I… huh.” Steve’s not sure what to think. It’s not like he’s angry. He hadn’t really expected to hear back from them, all things considered. “I mean, it’s not a big deal. It happens, right?” He turns toward Tony.
Steve blinked at him, turning his head against the table that was slick with his sweat now. “What’s the fun way?”
That was a good question, wasn’t it? “Well… I texted my handlers when we were at the police station to make sure they don’t think I’m dead. No meetings today or tomorrow, which means I’m free for both days.” He waggled his eyebrows at Steve. “How about you?”
“Not so bad, are you, fella?”
The end of the creature still hanging over his face was moving its antennae back and forth again. Steve wasn’t sure what to expect until he felt some of its legs moving against his ass. It was almost like…
“Tony.” Steve knew his tone made his intentions clear.
go easy on you.”
Steve almost immediately regrets stepping into this man’s personal space because he’s hit with an intense wave of sweet omega scent. Oh God, how did he not notice before? The man smells like an omega in his second or third day of its heat. He takes a step back and hesitates.
“So, um…” Steve’s not sure of what to say. “You looked me up?”
Steve moaned at the praise and strained against his restraints. He could feel his cock twitch against his sensitive skin.
Bruce gives him a lopsided smile. “Not a soulmate. Though you could look at it that way if it makes you feel better.”
Which isn’t possible when he’s run out of his goddamn suppressants. He had dug through the workshop earlier, found nothing, and then remembered that he sometimes kept some in his rarely used office. So he came up here for a few meetings, hoping to grab his suppressants, only to find himself at 6 PM on a Friday with his heat coming on and not a prescription bottle in sight.
He’s gratified when Steve keeps going. As the moments draw on, Tony wonders to himself hysterically, if this works via the other end, too? Tony
Tony swiveled his seat back toward the holographic screens displaying the project he’d been working on. “No naps today, J. Once I finish this, I’ll turn in.”
Tony huffs out a laugh. “I was in a hurry to get home and canceled everything on my schedule for the rest of the day.” He looks down at his hands in his lap. “Of course, I totally forgot that I was supposed to sit in on an interview with marketing.”
Bruce shrugs. “I mean, there’s always cases of alphas and omegas getting a bit too enthusiastic when stuck in a confined space for too long. And you said it was consensual, so…”
Tony glanced down at his slightly rumpled suit and pants. He could go back to his hotel, but he had a feeling that his 5-star luxury suite overlooking Shibuya would give him away.
He flinched when he felt Tony’s gloved hands probing around his entrance. Glancing down, he could only see the top of his head.
“A-Ah,” he gasped as the pressure continued to increase and his abdomen bulged out more. His back arched as he struggled against his restraints. It was too much, yet so,
Before Tony can answer, he hears a growl right next to his ear. He turns his head to see that Steve is glaring at the elevator panel.
“Oh thank god,” he says as he reaches up to take off his shades. “Was worried I had the wrong address.”
“More,” Tony gasps.
“Whoa whoa whoa, wait a sec.” Tony stepped toward him and placed a hand on his shoulder. Not that he could stop Steve in any meaningful way. “We’re not 100% sure what we’re dealing with here. JARVIS is working on sealing up the Mark 43 and then I can head in.”
Tony slid his hand upward to stroke Steve’s chest. “Do you think you could take a bit more?”
Steve puts his hand on Tony’s forehead again. The way his eyebrows jump is not a good sign. “Definitely warmer than before.”
“Huh,” Tony said as Steve noticed another bit of movement.
As Steve stepped into the lab, he took a quick look around. Aside from the alarms going off, the place didn’t seem any different from usual. He hadn’t spent much time down here—it was more Bruce and Tony’s space than anyone else’s—but he remembered the layout from the last time he’d been down here. As he stepped further into the room, he also noticed that the air in the lab didn’t seem any different. Of course, it wasn’t like he should expect any biological agents to be visible.
Laughing, Tony said, “Well, let’s go by process of elimination.”
“Tony…” Steve rests his face in his hands. “I’m being serious, here.”
.” When he meets Steve’s eyes, again, he’s smirking in a way that reminds Tony how Steve can be devious when he needs to.
“I am,” Steve replied. He was panting now, his breath warm against Tony’s lips. “Wanna come on your cock.”
“Mmm,” Steve answered as his tongue seemed to not want to cooperate yet.
The man is attractive, there’s no doubt about that. Under different circumstances, like at a bar, Steve might’ve gone for it. Like this, though? It doesn’t seem right.
“Oh yeah?”
Tony raises one hand up and waves his hand in what he hopes Steve interprets as a signal to keep going.
“Try to get comfortable. I’ll make sure not to touch your back or anything.” Steve settles behind him on the mattress.
“Well, fuck me, then.” The man seemed to deflate at that as he let his head lean back to hit the door. His eyes were closed, and Steve couldn’t help the feeling of pity that welled up inside of him.
“As you wish, Sir.”
me, already.”
Tony knows that resigned tone all too well. “Some bullshit, huh?”
Tony looked as though he was thinking it over before answering, “Fine.”
“It’s not about blame. It’s about proper lab safety procedure,” Tony kept on going on as he started pacing again, almost talking more to himself than to Steve. “I’ve been working on properly sealing the Mark 44 for the past three days…”
Now that Bruce mentioned it, Tony had clearly found the time to meet with Bruce as soon as he’d returned to the tower. Yet JARVIS had claimed he had an important deadline keeping him busy.
He was about halfway up the first flight when he heard a noise coming from the second floor landing. He stopped for a second and sure enough, he could pick up what sounded like a low moan. His instincts told him to hurry up, and he took the rest of the steps quickly. Steve wasn’t sure what he’d expected, but a man in a suit leaning against a door wasn’t it.
An uncomfortable silence started to stretch between them as Steve realized he didn’t really know the standard operating procedure for the “you’ve been intimate with an unidentified alien creature and we need to make sure you’re okay” talk.
“J, any issues clearing my schedule?”
Before he even realized it, Tony was approaching Steve. His hand flew down to his belt, but then he hesitated.
He answered with an enthusiastic moan around Tony’s cock buried in his throat, which seemed to be what pushed Tony over the edge as he finally came down Steve’s throat with a cry.
A minute later, as he was coming down from the high of his orgasm, he felt the other end of the creature reach his ass. He rocked back, bringing his hips upward, to give it space to move further down. Something cool hit his skin as the creature’s legs crawled across his ass. Whatever that stuff was, it was easing the creature’s way across his heated skin as it went lower.
“God, Steve, you look so good like this,” he said, his tone breathless as he ran a hand across Steve’s cheek. “Were you waiting for me this whole time?”
“You okay?” Steve asks as he reaches for Tony. It’s a statement to how tired Tony is that he lets Steve feel his forehead without any protest. “You’re pretty warm…” he glances away for a moment and Tony can see him clench his jaw.
He’d ended up deciding to take a long trip for Christmas and the New Year. After saving up for a few months and budgeting carefully, he’d snagged a cheap Shinkansen ticket and headed up here. Even with the fast ride, though, the day had been long and now he was looking forward to settling down for the night in the hotel he’d reserved a “room” in.
“W-wait a sec,” Steve started to say. This wasn’t usually how things went at the end of a sparring session.
Throwing his head back, Steve moans as the overwhelming warmth envelops his cock; it’s almost enough to make him come right away. He moves his hands to Tony’s hips and grips hard as he starts to push all the way in. Steve closes his eyes without thinking as he focuses on how Tony feels all around him: his slick inner walls are loose enough to make the slide easy, yet tight enough to provide some wonderful friction.
They stay there for awhile, Steve gently rolling his hips as his cock continues pumping come into Tony. His knot shows no signs of going down, but Steve can’t bring himself to care; he feels high on pleasure. Tony’s words are mixed with moans as he tells Steve how good his knot feels, how full he feels, until his words slur into incoherence. Every now and then, Tony comes again—the way he ripples around Steve’s cock like Tony’s body is milking his come out of him, unable to get enough.
“Hm?”
Tony floats back into consciousness slowly. The first thing he notices is that he’s warm all over—to the point that it’s somewhat uncomfortable. His limbs feel heavy, too. He curls up further against himself, but that doesn’t feel right. It feels like he had way too much to eat before sleeping, which doesn’t make any sense…
“Oh, uh…” Steve’s nostrils flare involuntarily, which only draws in more of the sweet aroma. Warmth quickly builds up in his cock and then spreads to the rest of his body. “S-sorry?”
“Oh yeah?” She put a hand on her hip expectantly.
“JARVIS, let me know when he wakes up.”
,” he said, tone breathless. His gaze drifted upward to meet Steve’s. “I know this sounds weird, but watching you do that was kind of… beautiful?”
“It’s a… millipede?” Steve said into the comm.
Steve could hear Tony breathing heavily right by his ear. He was clearly starting to wear out; a fact that Steve’s sex drive was unfortunately indifferent to.
He heard Tony sigh heavily before Tony reluctantly turning to face Steve again. Tony raised an eyebrow. “Yes, Cap?”
“Considering how boneheaded you both can be, we decided we should take a different approach,” Natasha said as she stood up. She reached up to her ear. “I’ve got him secured. How’re things on your end?” She nodded once before saying, “Good.”
“Whoa, whoa, calm down,” a deep voice said as a hand landed on Tony’s shoulder. He flinched, and backed into the wall, turning onto his side. From this vantage point, the whole place looked sideways. “I know you’re probably confused right now.”
Despite how worn out he felt, Steve almost forgot how to breathe when he looked up and saw Tony’s expression. He looked entranced as he stared down at what must be Steve’s gaping asshole.
“I think I found our suspect,” he said quietly into his comm.
He reaches over to pat Steve’s arm. “Calm down, honey.” He winces at the overly familiar endearment before adding, “They’re gonna get us out of here.”
Tony finally stirred, slowly pushing himself up from Steve’s chest. He had this dopey smile on his face that Steve wanted to kiss so badly.
That was how he’d found himself wandering around who-the-fuck-knows-where neighborhood in Tokyo, doing his best to not trip over his own feet. There weren’t many people out this late, and those that were tended to be men similarly indisposed or groups of women that just ignored him. It was weird, to say the last. Not at all like what Tony remembered being drunk in New York or Boston was like. It was like no one here really cared if you were stumbling around the street. It was a good thing and a bad thing, he supposed.
Steve pulls Tony against him, which pushes his cock against Tony’s abdomen. Tony breaks the kiss with a gasp. When he pulls back, he finds Steve looking back at him, eyes wide with wonder.
“Tony,” he said as he smiled as he shook Steve’s hand from his awkward position. “So… you don’t have any plans for today anymore?”
Tony smiled down at him. “You can still feel it moving inside of you, huh? Like I said, it’s peristalsis—all those circular gastrointestinal muscles contracting to push it through you. So you’ll feel it the whole way through.”
“Feelin’ great, Tony,” he declared cheerfully.
Tony’s not sure what to say. What would Pepper want him to say to encourage someone who wants to work at the company? “You should be good. HR’s always on top of stuff like that.”
“You feel so goddamn good like this,” Tony said as he started to move a bit faster. “So full for me. Fuck, Steve, you’re so good to me.” He followed up with a particularly hard thrust against Steve’s abdomen.
He didn’t notice anything at first. Tony just kept idly stroking his stomach as he peppered kisses over his chest. Occasionally his hand would stray up to tweak one of Steve’s nipples, which would make Steve writhe in his restraints. Maybe that was why he didn’t notice things sooner.
He shrugged. “Fine, Tony.” He turned toward the door. “I’ll leave you to it. Just… make sure to get some rest and try not to run yourself ragged.”
“Yeah yeah, I know. Could just be a fever due to inflammation.” He glances out the window again. “But ugh, this is a shitty situation to be stuck in.”
The way Steve was lapping up whatever bizarre fluid the creature was secreting was bad enough. The fact that the creature’s head, or what seemed like it anyway, looked rather suggestive. Well. The mental imagery was unavoidable.
The mass of the alien’s body began to shift, moving Steve’s limbs on its own. He allowed himself to be moved, groaning as he felt his legs spread wide. Like this, he was completely exposed. Going by the loose, wet feeling down there, he knew the creature must have prepared him somehow.
Tony’s eyes widened for a second as his mind quickly worked through what Steve said. “Oh.” He glanced down at Steve’s bound wrists and ankles. “Uh…”
Tony glanced up to see the man scrutinizing him with concern. The amount of sincerity in those blue eyes was almost too much to take this early. He needed a shower. And a massage. And maybe to kiss this guy’s pretty pink lips. ...Well, shit.
“Shit,” Steve cried out as he felt the creature’s legs against his perineum. His vision whited out and his back arched off the floor as dozens of legs moved over the sensitive area. The blinding pleasure continued as the creature moved over his balls and then up along his cock. When he finally mustered up enough focus to glance down, he saw the other end of the creature crawling up from underneath his groin. It was so close to his cock. If it just kept moving upward…
The softness in Steve’s expression as he moves to help Tony out of the armor registers in the back of Tony’s mind. Looking back, he feels guilty about getting into an argument with him on the jet. Now that Tony thinks about it, he can’t even remember what they were even arguing about. Probably something stupid.
“I’m serious!” Tony yawned just for show. “Going to head to bed right now. I’ll see you later.” He cut the call before Bruce could respond. Even he had to admit he was being a dick, but he actually was tired now that he thought about it. A nap couldn’t hurt. He had a cot in the corner of his workshop for these occasions.
Christmas really was a couples’ holiday in Japan, Steve thought to himself with amusement as he relaxed into Tony’s kisses. He had a feeling that this would be a very nice Christmas, too.
Tony was taken aback for a moment before he realized Steve was messing with him. They both broke out into laughter before going back to their food.
There’s the sound of slick skin against skin, the mattress shifts, and then there’s a pressure pushing at his entrance. He lets out a moan before he can stop himself when the head of Steve’s cock pushes past the ring of muscle. Steve’s fingers felt big enough. Now, it feels like Tony’s being split in two. But god, it’s good. It’s so fucking good. Tony’s always been a size queen and Steve is just
It seemed to take forever for Tony to finally sink down all the way. Steve gasped when he felt Tony’s warmth settle against his balls.
“I guess. Graduated from college early and all that. Anyway, are you okay with me sticking around?”
“Do I need to be prepared before we do… all this?”
And there Steve goes again with that tenderness in his eyes. Those blue, blue eyes focused on Tony like he’s actually something worth protecting.
He offered Bruce a lopsided grin. “Well, there’s a silver lining to every cloud after all.”
The long, deep groan that seemed to tear itself out of his chest surprised him. He blinked a few times as he tried to wrap his head around what was going on. As creepy as the creature looked up close, its legs felt… really nice. Abruptly, he sat up and started to pull off his undershirt. Lying back down, he closed his eyes and let out a sign of relief as the creature reached his shoulder.
“Well?” Tony asks, leaning on his elbow and making himself look far more relaxed than he feels.
Tony turned toward him, eyes wide. “What?”
“Mmm, yeah. That sounds about right.” Steve moved to roll them over again and slid his hands down along Tony’s torso to do just that. The startled moan that move elicited from Tony was music to Steve’s ears.
Steve liked to think he had built up some resistance to that look, yet at the moment he wasn’t so sure. He told himself that he at least knew he could trust Tony, especially in something as… uniquely intimate as this. “I guess… we could give it a try.”
“Yeah,” Steve gasped out. “Just… really weird.”
“Yeah, I’m good. Doesn’t seem to be anything corrosive, anyway.”
Tony scooted forward until he was spooning Steve from behind. “You are so needy.”
“Not helping,” Tony grumbled under his breath before swiveling around on his chair to face Bruce. “Well, you’ve got me. What’s up?”
Steve nodded. He settled back and watched as Tony closed his eyes and started to finger himself open. As Tony moaned and gasped and shuddered above him, he wished he could reach up and kiss him or just pull him against his chest or something. But he felt so sluggish, all of his energy seemingly sapped by the heavy weight in his abdomen. It was nice, though. With the serum he always felt like he had an excess of energy. For the first time he could remember, he was able to just relax and let go in a way he never had before.
Steve let out a long, loud groan at the contact. With his stretched skin as oversensitized as it was, it felt like he could feel every bit of Tony’s thick, hot flesh. Now he understood why Tony had applied lube there before starting.
way I’ve been propositioned,” he finally says.
“Um… isn’t this a bit much?” He turned to Tony, expression wary.
“I’m just soliciting feedback!”
Once again, Tony has
“Nah,” Natasha said.
He turned around a bit to check on Steve again. The man was still out like a light, though he was breathing steadily. The suit’s HUD reported that his heart was beating at a normal rate and Tony breathed a sigh of relief.
“So here’s the deal,” Tony said softly to him as he continued to run a soothing hand over Steve’s abdomen. “We can get the nanites out of you the easy way or the fun way.”
“You okay, honey? We can stop here, if you need to.”
Chuckling, Steve smiled up at Tony. He was beautiful like this. Naked and so open for Tony. Even with the alien creature surrounding them, all Tony really cared about was Steve. Tony couldn’t resist leaning forward to kiss him. When Steve moaned enthusiastically into the kiss, Tony let it turn filthy as he sped up his thrusts into Steve’s welcoming heat.
“Tony, Tony…” he gasped into the pillow that was already damp with sweat and saliva. “I’m so close.”
Tony inwardly breathed a sigh of relief. Except Bruce looked worried now.
Tony shrugged. “Yeah, but I don’t have to go back just yet and I can cover both of us tonight.” He offered Steve a lopsided grin. “Least I could do for my knight in shining armor.”
“Cap, I don’t know what this thing’s trying to do and I don’t like it. You feeling any better now that you’ve... gotten off?”
The countless little appendages caressing his skin felt so damn good. It took a bit for him to open his eyes; his entire body felt loose and relaxed. Bright light surrounded him and he blinked a few times before settling onto bright LED lights hanging overhead. He’d been here before.
Tony shakes his head. “Wouldn’t have happened if I’d been on top of my shit.” He turns to Steve, looking into his eyes steadily. “So I just wanted to say I’m sorry about all that.”
Steve nodded, though he had one question. “Um… will they still…” He felt awkward even trying to finish the question.
“I’m good for tonight. I mean it.” He could let it go down on its own. It was uncomfortable, but he’d live.
He was so damned sensitive that it was almost impossible to ignore. As much as he wanted to be good and wait to let Tony take care of him, he’d already gotten himself off twice. Once in the shower because even a lukewarm shower wasn’t enough to discourage his dick.
Just their luck, Tony thinks to himself. He sighs and says, “Suit’s already sending out a distress signal, for all the good it’ll do us up here.”
“You’re absolutely, one-hundred percent sure this will help?”
Tony leaned down to kiss Steve lightly. “Mmm, you’re so good to me.”
Steve stood up as he pushed his duffel back in and turned to Tony with a small smile. “Yeah, sure. Like I said, my plans for today are shot.”
“Don’t wanna talk about it.”
“Ah, ah,” Steve cried out. He was still oversensitive after being brought off so many times in succession. Now, it was driving him crazy.
“I gotta,” he breathed out. “F-feels so good, Tony. You have no idea.” He felt the creature’s other end move across his torso and let out another groan.
Laughing, Tony dropped down next to him. “That’s the spirit!” He patted Steve on the shoulder. “You’ve already broken some gym equipment. Why not ruin the mats, too?”
“You look like you could use something to help you take your mind off of everything.” She smiled at him and nudged her head in the direction of the now broken cable machine. “And unlike that machine, I’m much harder to break.”
“You’ll see.” There was a notable pause before Tony added, “Or, well, I guess you’ll
Tony’s eyes widened briefly before he started laughing. He was glancing down at his hands on the edge of the examination table. He raised his head to smile at Steve. “God, I love you so much.”
“I’m here until the weekend,” Steve said as he dug through his duffel. “I have my days planned out, but it’s not all set in stone.” He glanced up at Tony, looking hesitant. “So you’re… really here for business?”
“Oh, um, well…” Bruce glanced away, removing his glasses again. “From what Tony told me, he was worried that the creature was hurting you. So his top priority was extracting you from its hold as quickly as possible.”
Tony’s gaze slowly drifted up to Steve’s face. He looked pensive. The fact that he was quiet was definitely a bad sign.
Sure, Tony maybe—kind of—sort of had a thing for Steve. Who wouldn’t? The man was literally human perfection. Not that that was the reason, necessarily. When Tony was a frustrated teenager figuring out his sexuality? Captain America comics and some select memorabilia from his dad’s collection were enough. Actually meeting the man and realizing that he more than lived up to the legend was another story entirely. Tony had a thing for competence, and Steve had that in spades both on and off the battlefield. That would have been enough, but this back and forth thing they had going ever since he’d moved into the Tower? Natasha kept saying she could cut the sexual tension between them with a knife, and Tony had to grudgingly agree. He liked Steve, at the end of the day. And, well, if glimpses of Steve in the showers after a mission were fuel for some fun time alone, that was Tony’s business and no one else’s.
Steve gazed up at him, imploring. “Need you to take me.
“Feeling good?”
“Tony…” Steve finally says.
Steve narrowed his eyes. “
“Oh, well… I’ll try to remain optimistic.” The guy’s gaze drops to the floor. Like this, he bears a striking resemblance to a kicked puppy.
enjoying yourself that whole time?”
Eventually, a crackling noise brings Tony out of his haze somewhat. He’s confused at first until he glances toward the elevator panel.
It turned out that the man wasn’t Japanese after all. In fact, he looked like he might even be an American.
Maybe it was disgust keeping him away?
Steve nods once. “Got it.”
“Good,” Tony said with a nod before settling back on his knees. He produced some lube seemingly out of nowhere and squirted some out onto one hand. It wasn’t long before he was reaching behind himself, letting out a gasp soon after. Turning his attention back to Steve, he said, “Won’t be too long, now.”
Steve goes quiet all of a sudden. He stands up and turns to look out the window. When he turns back to face Tony, he has that look on his face that he always gets right before he does something really dangerous on a mission.
“Give me a second,” Tony said. “Checking with JARVIS.”
Steve took it gratefully and let her help him up. He apologized as he ran a hand through his hair in frustration. He’d been feeling off all day and had been hoping that sparring would take his mind off of things again.
Steve huffs out a breath and starts to cross his arms before stopping himself. He turns toward the fire. “Let me just add some more wood to the fire, first.”
Steve moaned as Tony pushed his tongue into his mouth. Before he could think better of it, he ran one hand around Tony’s thigh to pull him up against him. That got him a nice high pitched whine out of Tony’s throat, which only made him want more.
The touch of a hand on his cheek caused him to open his eyes again. He glanced up to see Tony staring down at him. The disgust was still there, but it was mixed with something else.
“That would explain all the corporate parties…” Tony mumbled to himself.
Tony gave him a lopsided smile. “Look at you, all sweet like this.” His tone was so tender and reverent that Steve couldn’t help groaning. “Can’t wait to feel you inside me.”
Steve was in a daze when Tony finally pulled back. It was like the rest of the world dropped away and all he could see was the way Tony’s eyes were focused on him so intensely. Steve had seen the way Tony could work on multiple projects at once; so having all of that intense energy fixated on him was a heady feeling.
“Get away from that thing!”
“You okay?” Tony asked, a tinge of concern in his voice.
Steve didn’t waste another moment and started pushing again. He groaned as he felt yet another object move through him until it passed his prostate, at which point he gave into the overwhelming pleasure that burned through him, from his core to the tips of his fingers. He was beyond oversensitive by now, yet his dick didn’t seem to care: it was already half hard and seemingly ready for another round.
One end of the spiral that Steve hadn’t even noticed before moved. Before he could step back, he reflexively brought his shield up to block what turned out to be a spray of some sort of liquid substance. His shield blocked most of it, but it splashed off the edges and hit the skin on his neck and the exposed fingers of his other hand.
They ended up stashing them one of the racing game cabinets for some kid to stumble upon.
“Ready to feel even better?”
It wasn’t long before the alien was wrapping around Tony, bringing him closer to Steve. Tony groaned as his orgasm started to build.
“Oh god.
hot.” He pushes his abdomen against Steve’s hand. “Can’t move without feeling you.”
Tony leaned forward. “Mmm, yeah, that is settled in there real nice, isn’t it?” Steve flinched when he felt Tony’s hand on his ass cheeks. “Used one of the medium-sized ones, too.”
Steve puts down the paint brush and scrubs a hand over his face. He’s running up against a deadline, but he’s run into a block he just can’t seem to get past. Glancing over at the clock, Steve realizes it’s starting to get late. He gets up, stretches, and heads out of his room-slash-studio for a drink.
The omega shakes his head. “Honestly, I’ve been thinking about jumping you since you got on here,” he admits, voice raspy. “If I’m gonna go into heat, then I’m damn well gonna enjoy it.” His gaze flicks up to Steve. “Come on, I can smell how badly you want me.”
“I’m not dead, Cap. I’m wearing armor, remember?”
“Will they vibrate against your prostate?” Tony asked with a laugh. “Sure. Wouldn’t be nearly as fun if they didn’t, right?”
Steve groaned, his head hitting the headrest with a faint thud. “So damn full,” he murmured in agreement.
“Tony!”
“Bet you’re pretty full, huh?”
“Fuckin’ door won’t open,” the man complained, his speech slurred.
Tony smiled back at him. “Ready when you are.”
Bruce hesitated, his gaze darting to the ground. “And sorry about this whole thing, Cap. Tony and I had no idea that the creature would be able to break out of its containment cell like that. That was reinforced glass and everything.”
Steve took a moment to think it over. “I guess I just really enjoy… the feeling?” He added, hastily, “Especially when it’s a lot.”
Despite JARVIS being his creation, Tony felt as if he could feel the AI’s silent judgement. He wasn’t objecting to sleep for the usual reasons, he could at least admit to himself. The problem was that
A voice in the back of his head was telling him that he should be embarrassed. Ashamed, even. Like this,
“Mmhmm,” Tony answers faintly. “Just… so full.”
“If I recall, Sir,” JARVIS replies, “you consider them to be in poor taste.”
His thoughts are cut off when Steve adds a second finger and his breath hitches.
That’s what Tony was caught up about? So maybe it wasn’t that he’d been disgusted by what he’d seen. Maybe it was guilt that had kept him occupied the past few days.
Steve nodded and gave him a thumbs-up. “Thanks, Tony. I appreciate it.” He turned toward the door and opened it quickly with the manual override.
Steve smiled back. “Don’t get sappy on me now, Stark.”
“Huh…” Did Tony have any plans for today? He couldn’t even remember what day it was. “What day is it, anyway?”
Sparring with Natasha really did end up taking his mind off of things. She was always an amazing sparring partner and could keep him on his toes more than anyone else on the team, except Thor.
Tony continued to lie against Steve’s chest, his own chest heaving as he regained his breath.
Panicking, Steve glanced around hoping no one had heard the sudden outburst. The room remained just as silent before and Steve let himself take a deep breath to relax. He glanced down at the man he’d been dragging around since he’d found him on earlier.
He gives himself credit for how quickly he grabs Steve and escapes through the cockpit window. Considering the situation, it’s a pretty good maneuver. Everything after that happens so fast that it’s almost a blur. There’s a loud explosion and the quinjet starts to veer downward as one of its engines is taken out. Tony does his best to get clear of everything, but there’s another explosion that must have hit the fuel tank because it’s bigger than the first.
“Of course, Sir.” Another holographic screen with the relevant information appeared next to the one monitoring the lab.
When he came back to himself, he glanced down to see the other end of the creature hovering in the air above his groin. His cock was still cradled against his underbelly, held securely by a few of its legs. When he tried moving his hips, the creature responded by wiggling the legs holding his cock. He practically choked on his own breath. Even though he was still hard, he was starting to get oversensitive. The continued onslaught of sensation was becoming overwhelming.
Even with the current precautions, Tony couldn’t help feeling uneasy. As he watched Steve head into the lab itself, though, he knew there wasn’t anything he could do about things now. His mind made up, he headed for the observation room.
“I owe you one.”
, you’re right.”
“I…” Steve’s not even sure how to bring this up.
Steve nodded before Tony had even finished speaking. “Let’s keep going.”
Steve’s response was cut off when the egg finally passed through the resistance of his entrance. Relief washed over him, so strong it was almost like an orgasm in and of itself. He glanced up at Tony, who smiled at him. Or at least, it looked like a smile. The edges of his vision were fuzzy, and he felt oddly detached from his own body. It was nice, though. Like he was floating and everything was just flowing through him.
Blondie shakes his head. “Probably not. I’m, uh… I was here for an interview.”
“You okay? Saw that you took a hit back there.”
Steve wraps one hand around Tony’s waist as he deepens the kiss. He slides the other around the back of Tony’s neck, making sure to avoid his back. It’s like it’s automatic for him; to make sure that Tony is comfortable. The realization makes warmth bloom in Tony’s chest as he lets Steve lick into his mouth. He had wondered how it would feel to kiss Steve, and he’s gratified to learn that he kisses with a passion and intensity that takes Tony’s breath away. He’s seen Steve’s knife-sharp focus in a fight or on a mission. To have all of that on himself is something else.
“Yeah…” Blondie says, sounding resigned to his fate. “I was already having a hell of a day. Guess this is par for the course.”
“—and all that…” Tony’s eyes narrowed. “Excuse me?” He tilted his head to the side a bit, like Steve was a mathematics problem he hadn’t figured out yet.
No Steve around to prod him and push him, to humiliate and praise him in the same breath.That was just fine. Tony didn’t need him anyway.
Steve threaded Tony’s leash over the top of the bed’s headboard and in through one of the centre vertical slats. With an experimental tug, Tony’s collar was pulled taut against his windpipe for just a second, and Tony gasped with surprise, and then let out a deep moan. His pupils were blown, staring up at Steve like he was a god.
want that to happen. His left hand shot out and tugged Tony’s wrist away just as Tony’s fingers had been dipped below the waist of his suit pants.
Tony let out a weak whine, twisting his face away uncomfortably. He leaned forward to press his forehead against Steve’s bare hip, his thighs were lightly dusted with blonde hair. Steve’s hand dug into Tony’s hair and tugged experimentally. “No, you don’t hide from compliments, don’t you dare, or I’ll have to spank you.” Steve’s nails lightly scratched at Tony’s scalp and Tony practically purred. “And I can think of much better things to do to your ass.”
to this man. He shifted to face Tony more directly on the couch and raised his free hand to grip Tony’s chin and force eye contact.
No Steve.
Thanks for reading! Even though I'm absolutely terrible at responding to comments, kudos and comments are my lifeblood.
“Yeah?”
The first push of his finger had Tony gasping. “Is this what you wanted, Stark? Hmm?” Steve stepped closer to reach his free hand into Tony’s hair. He pumped his finger slowly, in small circles pushing against the muscles of Tony’s hole.
you, I—”
21 anymore. Steve looked too pleased with himself as he pushed his cock in slowly. “Your cock is mine to play with.” Steve’s voice was playful, eyes crinkling with his grin. Tony’s stomach flipped pleasantly, and he tightened his fist around the leash handle. He focused on his breath as Steve’s cock seemed to take up the space in his body that oxygen usually did. Still, he readied his left hand to tug, waiting for Steve’s first proper thrust.
“Agh— please,
Tony paused for a moment. “... I want too many things,” he said, and Steve’s grin faltered.
Steve snorted at that, looking over at Tony’s sticky body. “Out of the two of us, I think you’re the one who needs the shower.”
Steve’s cock pulsed as he came down Tony’s throat. Tony held his breath and swallowed earnestly, long after Steve was spent.
“I’m sorry, Pep, really— I had an unexpected emergency.”
Tony licked his lips before letting out a standard Stark quip, “You’re just saying that so you can get your hands on my naked body.”
I'm still considering writing the Second Appointment from Steve's POV just as a side-fic, but it's not high priority right now.
“Hold on, baby, the main course is still coming.” Steve teased, pulling his thumb away. He brought his hand down to support the back of Tony’s head.
He darted into his bedroom and skidded to the floor on the side of the bed out of sight from the door. After a beat, Steve felt ridiculous. He could be mature. He could be brave. He’s Captain America—he could face Tony. He could talk.
“Green?”
“I don’t think he hates you.” She put her phone down next to Clint’s plate.
“Y’know what I mean. You kept coming… Did you— oh, I wasn’t the only one was I?” Tony suddenly felt sick, felt like he was thrown out of his own body and forced to watch as he made a fool out of himself in front of Captain America, Mr Perfect, Captain Sculpted Ass. Of course Tony wasn’t the only one Steve was meeting with. Steve was… Steve. He was smart and gorgeous and he somehow knew his way around Tony’s kinks like he had crawled up into his brain to take notes. Tony wasn’t special, he never was.
It dawned on Steve that the sight of Iron Man walking was strange to him. They started together on foot Westward from the truck wreckage. “You seem to be even less sociable than usual today, I’m surprised you want to ‘
Tony sighed heavily behind Steve as he carried the towel into the bathroom. Which was… decadent. Steve spotted multitudes of bottles of bath products that promised relaxation and improved sleep lining the shelf by the large tub. The shower was white tiled with a large sliding glass door.
Steve had been instructed to kneel on a cushion by the client’s feet in the lush living room of his large home. The television played some drama program that Steve was, of course, unfamiliar with. Steve had his head bowed, giving access to the man’s hand to pet and scritch through Steve’s hair quietly. The ropes laying across Steve’s nipples were the focus of Steve’s attention; any shift would send sparks of sharp sensation and pleasure from his nipples and trigger fireworks in Steve’s brain.
Black Widow smirked before heading Eastward with Hawkeye in tow. They quickly disappeared into the trees.
Before Tony’s thoughts could return to science, his stomach rumbled in a cry of hope to get attention. “That’s a good idea, I guess.” Tony lifted himself to his feet.
Tony’s eyes scanned the apartment and zeroed in on the open bedroom door.
Steve’s right hand dipped further to grab Tony’s balls, rolling them in his palm.
“Or do you want it slow? Soft, sweet? Want the sap of lovemaking?” Steve ignored the fact that he had experienced none of that before. “Staring into each other’s eyes as I make you come on my cock?” Steve internally winced when his voice waivered. Tony whined, eyes squeezing shut, arching up to gain more friction against Steve’s hard cock.
Tony’s eyes cast forward to Steve’s cock, a scant inch or so from his mouth, and licked his lips. His gaze traveled up Steve’s defined abs, his firm pecs, his pink nipples, his beautiful broad shoulders. “Please—

“Or do you want it slow? Soft, sweet? Want the sap of lovemaking? Staring into each other's eyes as I make you come on my cock?” Steve’s voice waivered when Tony whined, arching his back and rolling his hips up for friction against Steve. “Impatient, sweetheart? Shh... I’ll take care of you, don’t you worry.”
…” Tony’s mind floated, but he was determined to get his words out. Steve’s thumb stroked gently over Tony’s pulse point, patiently waiting. “…choke me while you fuck me again.”
Well, so much for the drop-off idea.
“Fuck, sorry, I didn’t—That’s not cool, I—”
It was weeks until Tony received an update from the escort service. He was not too torn up about it, though, because he had been flooded with work to do. A couple of calls to assemble, some repairs and upgrades to tinker with on the suit. Tony also had a feeling he could design a sturdier arrow for Clint that can pierce through thicker armour but not weigh him down too much.
Tony was sinking into the stimuli of Steve; his left palm resting on Tony’s ass, his hot breath on Tony’s skin, one finger testing his patience. Tony found himself rubbing his face helplessly into the pillows, ass presented up to Steve like a gift. Or a desperate plea.
Suddenly Tony was stammering an apology. “Fuck, sorry. I didn’t—That’s not cool, I—” Steve raised his hand before Tony could dig his own grave, and he sat up.
Relief came over Steve and he took a calming breath. He reached across the counter and placed his hand on Tony’s elbow, then quickly decided against the touch, and placed his palm down on the counter instead. He smiled at Tony warmly to make up for the indecision. “Tell me what you’d like to talk about.”
He brought his hands up to touch his shoulders. The skin was slightly raised and flushed with colour from Steve’s teeth last night. Tony’s fingers delicately reached to touch the stripe of purple across his throat, a small hum coming from him unexpectedly. Last night was incredible; Tony hoped to see Steve again.

Steve then felt bad about keeping Tony completely clothed so he reached up for the top button of Tony’s shirt. When he made contact, Tony’s let out a weak but sharp gasp and grabbed Steve’s wrist. He wordlessly shook his head, staring into Steve’s eyes. That was alright. Steve could live without taking off Tony’s shirt.
Steve’s mouth ran dry for a moment. It was as if shock had frozen the words he struggled for. War. Silence.
“Thank you,” Tony whispered sleepily.
It took a moment before realization seemed to set in and Steve wished that he knew how to operate a camera simply to capture the moment directly before Tony’s face flooded with newfound knowledge. He briefly wondered how often this look crossed the man’s face, the man who seemed to know everything. Somehow, that made it all the more valuable. He blinked hard once, then twice, then a smile lifted his bearded face.
happening again.” A pause and his expression softened. “I won’t make you, though.”
“Alright, then lay in bed.” Steve bargained.
“‘Can’t repeat the past? Why of course you can!’” Steve’s face lit up, the literary quote springing from his lips. “I didn’t know you liked to read.”
“Tony,” Steve tried again, drilling holes through Tony’s eyes with his own gaze. “Are you a heroin addict?”
The medicines were a mess on the counter once he’d dumped the contents of the cart, pushing the items toward the cashier.
He’d received these calls before, or so he thought. Occasionally, an urgent mission simply couldn’t wait for the next day. Just as the diligent soldier that he was trained to be, he shot up from his sleeping position and reached easily for the phone, expecting to hear Nick Fury or Hill’s voice on the other end.
it to stay there. Instead, Tony’s palm settled over his shoulder. “I’m all in, alright? Or I-I’ll try. I’ll try.” He repeated the words like a mantra, as if convincing himself. His index finger tapped morse code on Steve’s sleeve, a nervous tick. They smoothed over the t-shirt material there, then slipped over his collar. The skin-to-skin contact sent a jolt through Steve’s spine.
At first, Tony was at an obvious loss for words. His steady gaze which had been trained on the ceiling had drifted to Steve’s expression, reading a helpless confusion. Then, anger. Tony sat up and shoved away from the other warm body so near to his own, erecting that steel wall once more. His torso was covered again and he faced himself painstakingly to a seated position, allowing his legs to hang over the side of the bed.
Kitchen floor? Basement floor?
“I’m serious.” Those two words were enough to shake Tony back to reality and out from his humorous daze which he guarded himself so passionately with. “I’m here because I care about you- and I’m going to be staying here until this-“ he made a waving gesture at Tony’s frame, shaking now with far more conviction. “- is all fixed and done for. Trust me in that it would be so much easier if you’d just tell me the truth.”
“Not only is there a gaping wound a few inches away from your appendix, but I suppose you haven’t looked in a mirror yet this morning,” Tony countered, rifling through a first aid kit that had been sitting in one of the drawers. He retrieved what he had been looking for and pulled it out, an instant ice-pack. He popped the chemical bag inside and shook it, the bag becoming icy almost as quickly as he had shaken it. He made his way back to the bed, crawling over to Steve’s side and sliding beneath him, resting Steve’s head in his lap.
The was a groan from beside him. “J-just give us everything, alright? We need all we can get.”
“Yes, Tony, but I don’t make a big deal out of it, alright? So let’s keep it on the down low.” Steve stressed, gesturing in front of him as if in a calming movement. The giddy expression on Tony’s face faded from manic and Steve allowed for himself to return it.
“No, baby, no- of course not,” he comforted the child, smoothing his hands along Peter’s forearms. “Why would you say that, Pete?”
“What happened?”
“I never asked for anything.”
The bathroom was nearly as pristine as the others that he had seen, though it had collected a thin sheen of dust due to being underused. Steve almost felt a pang of melancholy for the bathroom, in a strange way. He chuckled out loud at the thought and turned the shower knob. This bathroom was… different. It was schemed in red instead of white with the taps being gold instead of silver- whether painted or
“Was that a masturbation joke from
“Tony, stop.” Steve’s voice interrupted him and he turned to face the smaller head on, seatbelt unclipped and disregarded in his conviction. Most of Tonys face was reddened and hidden by the shadow that the hood cast over him, but Steve’s eyes were caught on the stubbly skin just below his jawline, the way that he swallowed hard and his lower lip wobbled in a feeble attempt to hide his vulnerability. Gentle lips. Steve just wanted to touch them, to shut him up for once. He didn’t have the patience to entertain what that desire meant. “You deserve me just as much as anyone else does- no, more. You… you know what you don’t deserve?” He paused for emphasis, gaze trained on Tony’s wavering expression. “This. You don’t deserve to-to feel like this and you
“You’re getting your information from tabloids now? Oh, sugar, even Pepper’s tits are less fake than that wad of bullshit. If only ol’ deadbeat Howard could hear his hero now.” It wasn’t funny anymore. Tony was then shoving Steve back weakly considering that he only had one arm to do so. “Leave me the alone for your own good, Steve. Just… just go, alright? Go home.” There was a sudden note of mourning buried in Tony’s voice and Steve wanted nothing more than to chase it out.
.” He rolled his eyes, arm fumbling clumsily as he tried to gross it over the casted one. There was something guarded behind his expression.
“Not like this,” Tony refuted, shaking his head which was mostly covered by the protective barrier of his sleeve. “W-when I had to get out of that cave, I did it for all the people I-I had waiting back home. When I had to deal with all the-“ he gestured to his forehead, “- mental stuff, I did it for Pepper. W-who do I do it for now?”
“Stay,” a raw voice whispered, teeth chattering through the words.
Steve sighed, finally surrendering to the other man’s soft touches. Tony fussed over him, relieving the skin and setting down the ice pack every once in a while. His fingers gently reached for Steve’s bandaged side and he pulled at the white wrapping to inspect the wound, wincing. It had healed rapidly due to Steve’s regeneration abilities, but it still looked fairly rough with stitching sticking out against his pale skin and wound slick with various medicines. Tony shook his head and bandaged it back up, going back to applying the ice pack.
When Tony began to heave heavy breaths and tire out, Steve allowed for one hand to rest down on the small of his back.
what a heroin high would look like so… maybe this was it? The tabloids had said it after all and maybe they’d been right. All that Steve knew was that Tony’s state was certainly not alcohol induced alone. “The magazine on the table… it said something about you being a heroin addict. I-I know how ridiculous they can be but, I don’t know, I thought maybe…”
“I am not.”
“Good.” There was another long, stretched quiet, but it was broken by another guarded statement. “Let’s… let’s just go back to bed.”
a hundred years old.”
A moment of unmoving quiet.
“No, I’m not,” Steve refuted and
“A bad kind of complicated?”
“I’m too hot,” Tony whined and Steve forced a sigh back. Of course he would remain un co-operative.
“Tony, are you alright?”
“Gentlemen first,” Steve began.
“Tony,” Steve began helplessly. He didn't have a chance to continue.
A large and angry scar cut down from Tony’s left collarbone to his right ribcage, just beneath the arc reactor which glowed steadily from his chest. It was wider near the middle and tapered out by the edges, white inflamed skin sticking up against the olive tone of Tony’s bare chest. He barely avoided shaking himself physically out of the sudden nausea that overcame him. He hadn’t cut past the Iron Man suit… right? Steve decided to unnerve himself with another thought.
“Better now, soldier,” came the reply, then the grin faded just slightly. “I just, uh, I-I gotta keep my pulse down for a while to… to…”
“I know,” Steve admitted, forcing a thin-lipped smile.
He settled with placing the boy down on the floor beside the woman, flailing and kicking.
“Romantic, I mean, just… the idea. It’s romantic.” Tony explained quickly, gaze resting lazily on the page in Steve’s lap. “I like it.”
“I-I can’t, Steve, I can’t.” The voice was broken, thin. It would be so easy to give up- Steve knew not by experience but by the simple dread in the other’s words.
“You know, you could, uh, keep those on.” Steve crossed his arms in front of his chest, fingers tapping manically on his forearms as if to distract him. Tony’s dick was literally just
“Yeah, I just, uh…” he stammered, biting down on his lip. “I, uh, thought maybe you could just stay here? You know, nothing weird. Just in case, um…”
_____________________________________
Tony shut up immediately as the realization sunk in. Steve half expected him to bite back a retort or shrink into himself but instead, Tony just moved closer to Steve for comfort. Steve began to gently comb his fingers through the tangled brown strands of Tony’s hair, careful not to pull to hard; even when he did, Tony didn’t even move. It was a while before he even spoke again, silently willing the tears to clear away from his cheeks and for the pain in his chest to ease up. It was a while before these things came to fruition and Tony felt his breaths evening out, steadying enough that he could even begin to speak.
“No.”
The various medicines were pushed up onto a shelf out of view once adequate supplies were gathered. A glass of water, painkillers, a cool cloth, soda crackers. When Steve returned, armed with his weapons of choice, Tony blinked in wait.
“You don’t have to carry me,” came the weak protest and, yeah, of course he would say that after he’d turned the majority of Steve’s shirt a dark red.
Both arms remained splayed out, his eyes trained on the ceiling.
Of course, every child had meltdowns. Steve and Tony had dealt with the occasional “I-won’t-eat-my-peas” meltdown, just as every other parent had. However, these meltdowns were much different. Tony’s work would be interrupted by a call from the first grade teacher, lamenting in a panicked voice that Peter was completely inconsolable. The sobbing would last for sometimes an hour along with all the fix-ins, kicking legs and screaming and writhing on the floor. At first, the fathers had dismissed it as a bad day or a poor night’s sleep due to nightmares- however, it quickly ran downhill.
“Tony, really,” Steve insisted, meeting his gaze. “I have shoes on, at least- and I don’t trust you to stand right now, to be honest.” The larger man gave him a once over, sucking in a deep breath. “Uh, okay, this might hurt a bit.” He gently turned Tony toward him and slid one arm beneath him, the other going to support his back. He lifted the man with ease, not without a small noise of protest from Tony and his broken ribs. “Sorry, sorry,” Steve muttered quickly, side-stepping back over the shrapnel and taking Tony to the couch, setting him down with all the care that he possibly could manage. Even so, Tony groaned in pain. “It didn’t get you? The glass, I mean.”
“For the Avengers?”
No response. Blink, blink.
“Yes.”
It didn’t take too long for him to settle in with Jarvis having sent Tony’s personal hired hands to retrieve enough clothes and necessities for him to stay for at least a month. Steve felt a discomfort at imagining men in suits going through his sock drawer, but surrendered to the complexity of it all. The men offered to unpack, but Steve wasn’t
Steve’s unoccupied hand fell just over the nape of the other’s neck and he stayed, tracing circles into the trimmed hair. It was very nearly terrifying just how much Tony’s fingers shook in his own and he held tighter as if to will them to still. They didn’t. Steve’s vision clouded slightly so he cleared his throat and forced his eyelids to shut.
Once they had reached the vehicle, Steve didn’t have time to worry about their rain-soaked clothing seeping onto the leather seats. The single thought which consumed his mind was
Steve paused a moment, then huffed softly. He felt quite in over his head and with Tony’s refusal to seek inpatient help, he felt the burden all on his own. “If we’re going to do this,” he began gently, “I need you to be willing to at least visit a psychiatrist. You can’t do this with only my help, Tony. You need
Steve sighed and shook his head, struggling to find any words that would be appropriate to say. Instead, he just looked reassuringly into Peter’s eyes, biting down on his lip in thought before he spoke. “Do… do you know that he loves you?”
Once the elevator slowed to a stop, Peter practically leapt from Tony’s arms, squeezing through the doors and sprinting through the hallway to a large bed. Just as it seemed he was calming down, he immediately began to sob again once he laid eyes on his other father. He flung himself onto the duvet, crawling over to the sleeping mound. Steve’s sleepy frown was even visible in the dark, growing into a deeper look of concern as he gently roused and allowed Peter to crawl onto his lap. The boy clung white-knuckled to Steve’s t-shirt, rubbing his face all over Steve this time. Tony winced, obviously knowing that Steve couldn’t have cared less, but still feeling a small sickness in his stomach at the thought.
“Shrapnel,” Tony finally said simply. “Shrapnel in my chest. Another prisoner, uh… Yinsen-“ Tony cleared his throat uncomfortably. “He put a batter in my chest to- to keep the shrapnel from my heart. Hooked to a car battery.” Tony forced a laugh. Steve didn’t join him. “I deserved it. You know what I was, right? They wanted me to make my weapons for them. They, um…”
Steve’s mouth remained slightly parted, willing even a whisper to come from between his lips. Instead, he was met with only dry air on his tongue, air that was suddenly far too thick for his lungs to adjust to adequately. He abruptly felt like an asthmatic teen again, pursing his mouth around a puffer during gym class. “Do…” he began uncertainly, a hot and uncomfortable tightness welling in his chest and throat. “Do you think that’s why I came? B-because I… I felt bad for you?”
There was a pause as Steve mulled over this information, pressing his lips tightly together. He inhaled deeply, thinking. “Is he okay, then? Can you tell me that?”
“I’m sorry,” Steve whispered, willing to do
, he demanded inwardly, cursing his numb mind.
Steve sighed, allowing for his own eyes to fall closed and for his aching body to relax into the gentle embrace. “I wont.”
“It’s bad,” he murmured gently, unable to keep the confession from spilling from his own mouth. “Tony… it’s bad.” It was. He could see it in the way that Tony’s expression lost its luster only moments after it had returned, in the way that his hands shook when he struggled to steady himself. Steve could only imagine how Tony had lost ability to weld and type and screw down in his workshop.
Tony was comatose still for a moment, eyes staring intently down at his bare feet. His bottom lip slid in-between his teeth, chewing intently as if he could stave off some pain with another. He nodded in response. Steve felt his heart sink down somewhere in his gut.
and Steve was supposed to avoid getting red in the face?
Some stitching- metaphorical and literal- comes loose.
The least expensive car that Tony had in the garage was just shy of $900,000 because
“An ambulance was called to the scene of a crash where Mr. Stark was found. The impact was caused by his own motor vehicle colliding with a barricade at a high speed- we don’t know exactly how high yet, but estimate that it would have been at least 60 miles per hour. For the most part, he has sustained treatable injuries. A nasogastric tube was forcibly inserted for feeding purposes due to his refusal to eat. The left arm is broken in two places and lacerations needed stitching on his face and abdomen. Two ribs are broken in the right side. We have been keeping him on opioids for pain relief and he seems relatively unresponsive due to… well, we don’t know. We hoped a familiar face would help to set him at ease.”
Steve’s legs strained as he reached out to get it, sliding it back along the surface until it lay open in front of him. He flipped idly to the front page to find a glaring, glossy image of the man standing directly in front of him. At first, he expected to see reports of the crash but reasoned that it was far too early for reports to already be out- right?
Once they had pushed open the door, Peter flailed slightly to indicate that Steve put him down. Once Steve had obliged, Peter stepped over to the bed, frowning. A large mound was huddled there, quiet and likely asleep. The boy clambered onto the bed to the best of his ability, pulling aside the duvet.
“Don’t you get it?” Tony questioned, flickering gaze finally resting still on Steve’s face. “I forgave you a long time ago.”
Ball Cap - Mother Mother
“You’re not supposed to drink with that medication and-“ Steve broke off, slapping a hand to his forehead frustratedly. “God, Tony! Could you at least act like you cared? I don’t have the energy for this.” It was true. No matter how Steve wanted to help, Tony was clearly in no state or mood to be receptive.
And of course, that was the ultimate last-thing that Steve had expected to hear over the static. He barely heard his own lips form some words of recognition as he got to his feet, hurriedly stumbling into his beat-up lace boots. He was slighted to notice that his fingers were trembling as he tied the loops.
“You’re thinking too loud.”
!” A shriek. Steve whirled around to find a mob of shoppers swarming like wasps around an empty soda can. Steve pushed his way between two bubbling teens, grimacing when he found the hooded figure hunched over and shielding his face- or attempting to with one arm. Steve would his own arm around Tony’s shoulders and continued their beeline to the counter.
“J, read the room.”
“I thought you’d never ask, Tony.” Steve worked to keep his voice level. He had been enjoying the dream-like state he had been floating on. This had felt like a
Steve had returned to the Avengers tower feeling at peace that night. And the next morning, Steve had finally done what he had been procrastinating on for weeks. He responded to the repeat request from Tony Stark.
This piqued Steve’s interest and he watched Tony’s expression for tells. Hints as to what Tony could be thinking. He slid one hand warmly from his own thigh onto Tony’s, “That sounds like fun,” he said, smiling.
and he was pulled roughly backwards against the sheets and then rolled to face Steve again. His balance was teetering with his legs bound, he found himself extending his foot to balance himself precariously on the tips of his toes against the bed.
Upon closer inspection, Tony’s tie was loosened and rumpled, maroon button shirt undone to expose his black undershirt, and the man himself was walking gruffly and Steve could smell the vodka once Tony was a few feet from him.
“Lube in here?” Steve asked, but received no response more complicated than a soft grunt of agreement. He opened the nightstand drawer he had been referring to and pulled out two small bottles of flavoured lubricant. Strawberry and pineapple. He held them out for Tony’s selection.
“Not much of a conversationalist, are we?” Tony’s face lit up with a grin. Steve chuckled and felt his face heat up. “That’s alright, I’ve been told I talk enough for three!”
“Good boy…” Steve whispered, stroking Tony’s hair as his cock was sucked clean. “Come on, now. Let’s get you lying down properly.”
Steve scanned Tony’s face, his squirming body. “You want me to fuck you, Tony? How do you want it, baby?” Tony’s eyes drifted closed again, but he seemed to catch himself and open them again, staring up at Steve. “Rough, on your elbows and knees? Want me to bend you over and take you and leave bite marks across your shoulders, bruises on your hips?” Steve grinded his hips down against Tony again, swallowing up Tony’s moan with a kiss. This time, he put everything he had into the kiss. It was aggressive and fed by the desperation of both men. Steve luxuriated in sucking and biting on Tony’s bottom lip for a long while before speaking again. Steve couldn’t stop himself from grinning at how Tony’s blush spread down his cheeks onto his neck and by his collar bones. His eyes were getting hazy, soft. Steve recognized it, he had read a
“I can do that. I could fuck you up real good, sweetheart. Could tie you up and flog you with that leather number I saw in your drawer last night.” When Tony’s breath hitched under his palm, Steve grinned. “Yeah, doll, I noticed. What could I be for you tonight?” Steve’s mind ran through ideas of roleplay scenarios. “Could give you a thorough dressing-down for some naughty thing you’ve been up to, hmm? You seem like that type of bad boy to get yourself into handcuffs once or twice.” Tony chuckled at that.
Tony scowled at her without any real fight. “It was good, I think. I was hoping for it to be more than just… I don’t know what I hoped for, really, but it can’t happen so it’s just an absolute mess right now.”
“I never wanted to hurt you. It wasn’t my plan. I don’t think I ever had a plan. What I did was selfish. Immoral…” Steve had a sudden flash of back home, attending service with his ma and listening to the priest’s words. Immoral.

Client name: Stark, Tony
– it had been exhilarating.
Steve looked up to meet Tony’s eyes, watching for cues, consent. Tony’s throat was raw, eyes glazed, mouth pink and lips swollen. He looked well-fucked and he took a deep breath before nodding quietly.
The rest of the team were easier to get along with. Hawkeye, Clint, worked hard in the field and seamlessly with Natasha. Without his hearing aids, Steve struggled to communicate with Clint a bit around the tower, but they were on a good enough basis. Steve adapted to texting technology quickly, but he did need to ask Natasha about the emojis Clint sent frequently.
“Enjoying the view?” Steve teased him, climbing into the bed. He left the sheets laying on his thighs, allowing Tony to ogle. Steve found that he did not mind in the slightest. He even felt a small squirm in the gut when Tony licked his lips. His mouth was so fantastic.
Tony’s grip was firm and steady, a good handshake. In that moment, Steve recalled Howard Stark’s handshake, and Tony did resemble his father so very much. He blinked away the thought.
After rearranging the cowl’s position and folding and unfolding it about five or six times, Tony forced himself to leave it alone.
“Fuck my mouth.”
Steve started to bob his head enthusiastically, now that he knew Tony was awake, Tony supposed. Tony gasped quietly as Steve took him down deep, the head of his cock nestled roughly in Steve’s throat, his nose pressed against Tony’s pelvis. Tony brought both hands up to cover his face, his cheeks were hot. Steve’s free hand came up and pinched Tony’s nipple cruelly and Tony let out a loud yelp, before Steve pulled back for air. Tony peered at him through his fingers. Steve sat on his heels, looking at Tony with a challenging expression. His cheeks were pink, his lips looked swollen and red. Maybe Tony had been sleeping through this for longer than he’d thought…
“Can’t resist testing out an ass like that.” Steve grinned, his hand rubbing Tony’s ass, squeezing and teasing his hole gently with his thumb. Tony let his head fall forward and closed his eyes.
He set about making himself breakfast before he would head down to the gym, or maybe find Natasha before she found
“Your first time?” Steve asked, kissing Tony again softly when Tony climbed over him slowly, planting an elbow by Steve’s shoulder for support.
Natasha was not going to let him hear the end of this. He texted her immediately.
The panic that pulsed through Tony’s veins as they walked towards the living room couch had him about to run to the nearest exit until Steve’s hand closed around his wrist as they sat together, knees touching. He breathed.
Steve looked, watched Tony’s face.
being Iron Man.
“I know, Tony, I know, come for me. You look so fucking gorgeous, I wanna see what you look like when you’re coming.” Steve’s words were kindle to the fire of Tony’s arousal, sending shivers down his spine and waves of need to his cock.
“So I’m told.”
Tony wanted to crumble into nothingness, his cheeks were hot, and his eyes prickled with tears. Never had he been happier to be on his hands and knees and not forced to see whatever Steve’s expression might be. Cocky? Angry? Pity?
Tony took another bite out of his sandwich. “Where do you want my hands, specifically?” He brought his hand up from Tony’s shoulder, along his neck and grazing upwards into Tony’s hair. Tony hummed. “In your hair? Do you want me to pull it?”
“Tell me,” Steve began, coaxing Tony to speak. He began to gently stroke Tony’s thigh, gradually sliding closer and closer to Tony’s groin over his soft suit pants. “Tell me what you want me to do with you.” Steve’s grip squeezed over the lean muscle of his inner thigh.
the Lightman Group meeting, you’ll go talk to him about whatever hurdle that tripped you up.”
Steve stepped out of the elevator and reached out his hand for Stark. Well, Tony. “You have a beautiful home.” His mother always told him it was best to open a visit with a positive remark. “My name is Steve.”
“… Yes.”
Now that Steve had discovered that Tony was even more entangled in Avengers business than he initially thought, he felt obligated to step away. Tony was under his command in the field (however, Iron Man did not tend to respect this chain of command anyway). Nonetheless, it would be inappropriate for a superior to be fraternizing with a subordinate, regardless of how insubordinate the man in question tended to be.

Tony took a breath and nodded. Steve stood from his chair, his fingers still in Tony’s hair.
“So, I had an idea: if I really just need to let out the sexual energy, or whatever…” Steve felt his cheeks heat just a bit. “I figure I can isolate that variable by setting myself up as an escort. If it’s just a sexual outlet that I need, it would do the trick. I found some places that hire online.”
Let us forget how long this chapter took.
He had to send off a post-appointment confirmation to the escort service to confirm his safety. He pulled out his phone once he sat on the couch. He confirmed the activities they engaged in, blushing as he added
“What do you want to do?” Steve asked, matching Tony’s volume.
“Do you have a collar, sweetheart? Did you want me to put you on a leash and have you crawl for me?” Tony’s eyes fell closed and he nodded quietly.
“Now I want you to keep your hands to yourself, Tony.” Steve began, and Tony was working very hard to focus on Steve’s words when Steve was so very naked, and so very beautiful, and so very
Content warning (a bit spoiling) at the end notes of the chapter
“I was wondering,” Tony began as they sat together on the couch. Knees touching again. “How do you feel about a little roleplay?” Tony spoke as if every word were a flower petal he was plucking, hoping for his wish to come true.
TOTAL TO CREDIT CARD = $3335.00
“Yeah, just give me—gimme a second.”
Natasha grinned devilishly. “Why do you ask? Worried I might know a few things?”
The shower was hot and soothing on Tony’s limbs, his arms pleasantly ached. He breathed deeply as he tapped on the arc reactor. He stepped out of the spray and dried himself off with a lush towel. With a fresh folded towel, he emerged from the bathroom dressed for sleep, but he was feeling restless.
and Tony gasped. “I’m—” Tony moaned, wriggling under Steve’s hands.
Steve pressed in, fulling sheathing himself inside Tony’s heat. Tony’s breath was punched out of him, he was gasping for air, breathing heavily and reaching up to grip Steve’s shoulder. Steve lunged forward suddenly, mouth latching onto Tony’s neck. Kissing, sucking, nipping.

going there right now?”
“Y’like that?” Steve growled, running one hand along Tony’s thigh, his ass, scritching and soothing in a hazy pattern.
“He ate a banana for you.” Clint said, looking up at Steve like it was obvious.
They took another moment of silence. Steve listened to Tony’s heart, thumping rapidly but steadily relaxing to a natural rhythm. Tony rested his forearms across his knees, leaning his head back against the wooden cupboard door behind him.
“I’ll hitch a ride with you if you need the babysitting.”
“Fuck,” Tony’s voice was raspy. Steve released the bite, grinning at the mark left behind. “S’good.”
“You want my come, sweetheart?” Steve planted a wet kiss on Tony’s neck. Tony nodded, gagging momentarily as the tips of Steve’s fingers tapped the back of his throat. “Pity I didn’t take your gorgeous mouth tonight, you’re so needy.” Tony moaned, and Steve gave his fingers a few thrusts in time with his hips. “Well, the night is still young. I can get in another round or two—fuck, you’re so tight.” Tony’s hole clenched at the suggestion of another round and Steve’s hips quivered. He came hard, spilling hot inside of Tony.
All at once, both of Steve’s hands left Tony, ruffled and empty, his eyes following Steve’s movements with want. Steve wrapped the hand with spit-wet fingers around his length and guided it towards Tony’s parted lips.
Steve cocked one eyebrow; his face was serious. Tony swallowed, and amended, “Please, tell me… Sir.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve opened his mouth, expecting
Steve nodded. He did, indeed. Steve had researched every item on Tony’s request list. He had been eager to learn, to be able to step into this role asked of him and be able to appreciate something other than a successful SHIELD mission, as Natasha insisted that he needed to do. She may not have exactly envisioned
A thought struck through Tony’s head.
The pet-name struck Tony, and another shiver ran down his spine. “Please,” Tony whimpered. “Please, Sir, let me come.” Tony worked desperation into every syllable, needing to express his need in his voice since Steve couldn’t see his face.
Steve somehow managed to sit them both on the couch once more, the smaller man tumbling awkwardly into his lap. He made no effort to move, so Steve held him against his own body tightly and securely, even when his good arm flailed and hit and tried to push him away. Steve had spent far too many PTSD-fueled nightmares next to Bucky not to be an expert in calming panic attacks- and Tony was far smaller and easier to manage than a mental-armed super soldier. Steve was used to this panic, yes, but at least with Bucky, he knew every trigger. Here, he was clueless.
Silence from Tony. Steve pursed his lips slightly and continued to sketch, making careful lines across the page. They sat in that surprisingly comfortable quiet for a while before Tony’s eyelids opened and he looked down to the pad of paper, eyebrows raising just slightly and blinking sleepiness from his gaze. Steve couldn’t quite see the size of his pupils- most of him would rather not know.
It was the day that Steve was called to a mission and Tony was left alone with Peter that shit started to hit the fan.
“Petey, it’s okay,” Tony responded, scooping up the smaller body and pulling him close. “Let’s go find daddy, alright?”
“It’s, uh, weird. Gross.” Tony offered, his own fingers curling around Steve’s wrist and tugging to urge it away. Steve didn’t budge.
“Well…” To be honest, Steve had no
“You just said that you were hot.”
______________________________________________
Steve continued to work at the task at hand, forcing himself not to think too deeply into the question. Clearly, Tony was referring to their dispute. Steve tried not to read into it; however, it was almost impossible not to sense the hurt in Tony’s voice. Steve had chosen Bucky- and now he was here acting as if he cared so deeply for Tony? It caused an uncomfortable welling in his chest which he simply didn’t have the energy to entertain. Why didn’t he come back? So many answers, so many.
“Sleeping.”
that hurt. The man knew exactly which points to hit, it seemed.
Tony’s face paled at Steve’s words and he sniffed halfheartedly, curling his toes into the sleek floor. He watched there intently, staring and staring as if his staring downward would will Steve away. He sniffed again, rubbing a palm tiredly over his face and- oh, that wasn’t tiredness. Those was tears. Steve felt his stomach twist painfully and he practically leapt forward, only slowing once he was in arms length of the man. He stood for a moment, helpless and pondering what to do. He reached out a hand, deciding that a manly clap on the shoulder was appropriate. Tony flinched away immediately.
“Why not?” Tony shot back, staring blankly ahead. “Is the real me inconvenient?” His rugged tone was full of venom, voice having been completely stripped raw from hysterical crying. Now, all that remained of the meltdown came in the form of hoarseness and reddened, teary eyes.
Just as they had begun, Steve found himself wrestling Tony’s arm through the sleeve of an oversized hoodie- though pulling him out of it was much simpler than it had been to put it on. He dropped the wet material to the floor and started on the next layer until Tony’s skin was exposed, shivering in only his boxers. Steve’s eyes traced over the scars-
“That’s, uh… what this is doing; keeping it all from shredding up my aorta.” Tony’s fingers tapped on the metal of the reactor. Steve’s eyes followed the sound, then darted back up. Tony sighed dejectedly, retracting his arm from where it rested on Steve’s shoulder. “See why I don’t talk about this shit?”
Silence.
“I-I can’t make him stop, Steve,” Tony lamented, panic coursing through his veins. What if Peter was hurting? What if he could never fix this? Was he that incompetent, that he was thrust into a full-blown panic attack at his son’s crying?
those goddamn tubs of water but today,” he chuckled again and released their interlaced fingers, patting the heel of his hand against the surface of the bathtub behind their backs, tears falling freely over his cheeks at such a point. It terrified Steve when Tony got like this- and it certainly wasn’t uncommon ground. “I-it’s like I wanted it to happen, Steve.” And then he was really crying, letting his face fall into his hands and becoming wracked with spasms which any other person would mistake for sobs- but, no, he was laughing.
Let It Be by Hayley Kiyoko
“Is it… is it because you can’t sleep?” Steve didn’t ask because it was a lucky guess. It hit far too close to home- and he knew the fear of isolation all too well not to recognize its grinning teeth around Tony’s throat.
Steve couldn’t help but mentally curse his own features. Of course, the serum had given him enhanced healing, superhuman strength and endurance, but it also gave him endurance in other areas- which would be fine so long as he had some outlet for all of that energy. Sadly, all that was left for him was just that; his left hand. And so, in the particular situation, he allowed for his hand to snake down to the length and fix over it, stroking slow, up and down. He allowed his eyelids to shut once again and focused his attention on creating a caricature of a young man- maybe some amalgamation of the young models he’d seen so often posted on billboards in this century. Brown hair, brown eyes, lithe figure…
“Like… like less than a friend?”
“Yourself.”
Tony was apparently far too good for hoodies, so he had to settle for what Steve had to offer him of his own clothing. Of course, by the time that Steve had slung a ridiculously large bomber jacket over Tony’s shoulders, the casted arm was trapped beneath five layers of clothing and the complaints had begun.
Tony sighed on the other side of the door. Then, “I thought you left this morning. Why didn’t you?”
such a high caliber vehicle gave Steve a sensation of nausea, forget the very fact that they were trying to be as inconspicuous as possible. Unfortunately, Steve’s motorcycle was out of the question due to Tony’s arm and the high fever that he was running. Just getting the man situated in the passenger seat was enough of a task.
Another scoff. “That might get you off, sure. Not me.”
“I… I don’t think so. I-I think-“ Steve cleared his throat in discomfort. If he hadn’t already pictured this happening a hundred times before, he might assume that his heart would explode all along his ribcage. It fluttered there, alive and so, so afraid. “I think… it’s complicated.”
“Tony,” Steve breathed, both hands fixing on the smaller man’s shoulders. Even with the reassuring, firm grip, Tony continued to look over his shoulder at the screeching child. The little hands were gripping at his curly brown hair, pulling and pulling as he cried. “Tony. Tony, look at me right now.” Steve said again, coming out as a stern command more than anything else. When Tony’s reddened eyes finally met his, he continued. “It’s gonna be okay, Tony. I need you to try to calm yourself down so that I can deal with Peter- he’s scared, Tony. I need you to close all of the blinds, okay? That’s your job right now. Okay?” He instructed, feeling his chest tighten with Tony just stared at him blankly, sniffling. “Tony? Close the blinds, okay? Alright?” Finally the man nodded, gasping in a shaky breath as he pulled away.
The door creaked open.
“It’s gonna hurt.”
Fault Line by Flatsound
“Pete? Pete, it’s daddy. Breathe, okay? You’re going to be okay.” Steve murmured, putting his hand out. “Can you give me your hand, baby boy? I promise I won’t hurt you. It’s me, it’s daddy.”
Steve didn’t reply. He lightly returned Tony’s grin before angling his blush downward to the paper. The lower lip had just begun to take shape, soft and real. Not real enough. It was once the drawings were done, once he had hung them or set them by the window to catch light or slid them into pressed pages that the mourning came. Not real enough. Not real.
“I didn’t say anything,” came the response and thankfully he returned, blinking a few times and fixing Steve with a sour expression.
Steve swallowed a lump in his throat, shakily standing and lumbering clumsily, slowly, over to the man. He stopped when he could adequately face the other with nothing in the way, but no closer. Tony stood, like a broken and frightened wild animal- Steve knew that he would hate himself if he scared the gentle creature away.
and he averted them quickly, staring down Tony. The man had a smug grin plastered on his face, those same pinprick pupils having returned.
Maybe it was true that if he hadn't asked, Tony wouldn’t have pulled away from Steve’s touch and tried to push himself up and walk back to the elevator alone- maybe. But that was one un-negotiable thing. He barely registered a hum of disapproval that left his throat, sliding an arm around Tony’s shoulders and then another under his knees, lifting him close.
“I’m cold,” he whined, his good arm attempting to cradle his casted one to no success. Those damn glassy, drugged eyes blinked once, twice, expectantly.
ing under his breath. “Jarvis?” He called out expectantly.
“Fuck,” Steve hissed out loud, brow falling as he felt his muscles tensing more and more progressively. His imagined spectacle gripped at his leaking and swollen length, tugging a few times and swiping a thumb over the dripping precum leaking from his slit. “I-I- fuck, I love it. Yeah,” he groaned softly, chewing hard on his bottom lip. “Fuck, Tony, fuck..”
“Steve, c’mon, get the stitching and t-the anesthetic now. Bottom right.” The voice was murmuring. Quiet. Steve began to search until he dragged out the items. Something in him numbed. He set up the thread and needle-
“What… what do you mean?” Steve’s voice cracked on the last syllable and he felt his neck grow hot with embarrassment.
“H-hi, sir, can I get an autograph?” A high pitched, quivering voice.
there- he could worry himself sick if he continued to stare there.
“Oh my god!” A shriek sounded from just down the aisle and Steve spun on his heel, finding a young couple staring in their direction. The woman clung excitedly to her husband’s arm and she began to fumble in her purse, finally clutching to her phone. Steve’s fingers grasped at his own hood and he pulled it over his head quickly, guarding Tony’s form almost instinctively with his own body.
Steve’s hand, which had somehow rested gently around the back of Tony’s neck, loosened its gentle hold. His skin, which had at some point pressed itself to the dark scruff on the other’s face, drew away. Blue eyes fluttered open to the shocked expression in the other brown ones. The knot in Steve’s throat dropped down to his gut. Twisted.
Cry Baby- The Neighbourhood
“You need t-to get the kit in the kitchen.”
“Don’t.” The voice was gravelly and raw, clearly from overuse. It chilled Steve to think about the tube in his nose.
“Don’t leave,” he demanded, though it sounded more like a weak request- and who could say no to that?
“Tony, no.” Steve’s hand curled in the soft texture and he tugged it from Tony’s shoulders, tossing it back onto the bed. “Come here, I’ll get you a jacket.”
“You’re burning up,” Steve insisted, placing his palm thoughtfully over the sweaty, warm forehead. He replaced it with the cloth despite the string of protests and complaints which followed.
“I never said it wouldn’t. I know you’ve been hurt worse before.”
things about me within the past ten minutes. Maybe you could return the favour.”
Steve didn’t have to respond.
“No,” Steve allowed, still facing Tony’s form. “But Bucky, my best friend, was. The fight was over for a while, sure, but not for him.” Silence.
The sickness came that afternoon and Steve watched Tony crush up a pill called Vicodin, then inhale it off the surface of his dresser. Even Steve wasn’t naive enough to flush the medication and expect Tony to go cold-turkey immediately. One, he agreed; start with one to take the edge off.
“No, what you need to do is to get your spicy, all-American ass back to bed before your husband makes your stab wound look like a paper cut.” Tony threatened, shooting Steve a look from beneath his brows which dared Steve to test him. With a resigned huff, Steve shouldered past Tony and made his way back into the dark bedroom, stripping off his white tank top to reveal his bandaged side.
Tony winced, his hand untangling from Steve’s t-shirt and coming to lay across his throat in a painful expression. Though he seemed significantly more relaxed, he still trembled even when he sat completely still. “What do you want to know?”
Steve’s mind swam with the information, eyes never leaving Tony’s still form. So much of it he was… surprisingly able to stomach. Tony had been hurt far worse in the past; it was the silence that caused his chest to tighten in an uncomfortable way.
The elevator doors moved in complete silence, shutting them in and beginning the ascent. Steve’s heart dropped, then skipped a beat, then allowed him to nod. “Yes.”
“I crashed the car,” Tony continued, his words almost painful to listen to. Steve figured that the screaming and the tube had torn his throat to shreds. “I-I wanted it.” Steve was completely silent, so Tony continued. “Did you know that the Manhattan Bridge would be so busy at midnight on a Wednesday? I didn’t think it would be. Still, at least I got enough room to speed up and hit the barricade.” There was almost a self-deprecating tone hidden even in the dry, seemingly emotionless words, some sort of Tony-Stark-esque humour within it. “G-guess I didn’t hit fast enough.”
“T-thank you!”
“Some people think- or know, rather- that Nick Carraway is gay.”
together. “This is so much worse, Steve. It’s so much worse.” No nicknames, no humour. All was suddenly borne out into the open air and Tony
for Christ’s sake, but he could hardly help himself in that instant.
To be honest, he wasn’t sure exactly what he had expected when he pulled up to the hospital. Of course he knew that the public hadn’t seen this as ‘just another accident.’ No, this was Tony Stark, ‘genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist’
“Yes, oh Captain, my Captain?”
“I-I don’t usually do showers.”
There was a long silence- by now, Steve assumed that he would be used to long silences such as these. However, they never came easier at all and they simply seemed to unsettle him. He felt frozen again, helpless.
“Tony?”
The one thing that Steve never expected was the shrill ring of his flip phone at 2 AM.
“Does it look like I’m leaving?”
so that Steve could sleep in peace.

gold, Steve didn’t want to know. He likely could have brought his mother and himself above the poverty line with just the doorknob.
Steve would have normally objected, distracting Peter and giving Tony some time to rest. Unfortunately, it didn’t look to be his best option at the time. Wordlessly, Steve nodded and scooped Peter up. “Jarvis, where is Tony?”
The meltdowns were clearly not tantrums; no, Peter didn’t want attention or candy or toys. He just cried and cried, slamming the door to his room or pushing his way into a corner or under a table. He would throw himself on the ground with so little awareness that he would wake up with bruised knees and elbows- he would bang his head against the wall until he had a large bump on his forehead. At first, Steve and Tony turned to their teammates whose immediate advice was to give Peter tough love and such. However, when they would witness the meltdowns firsthand, they insisted that something else was wrong.
Steve felt his mouth run dry. “Tony-“
“C-congratulations, you have eyes!” Tony’s tone became suddenly harsh, shrill with panic. “Is now a good time to let you know that I have a bum ticker? Get to it!”
“Daddy’s not going anywhere, okay? Daddy loves you,” Tony mumbled out various strings of affections, sniffing. The next morning, Steve had told him that he had been harder to console than Peter had been.
“Nah,” Steve responded, allowing for the corner of his lip to lift in amusement. “It’s just a lady I knew back in the day.” The woman didn’t have all of the life that she used to with only the bones of the sketch laid firm. He had the shape of the face, the eyes, the way that the nose peaked up just slightly at the end. Now, he added the shadows beneath her youthful face. “I, uh… I draw things from back then. I didn’t have any pictures when I woke up so it’ll never look just right but… I can try.”
Steve allowed himself to relax, sliding out a chair by the counter and taking a seat. Admittedly, he was exhausted and had no clue how Tony was possibly on his feet what with no sleep and opioids in his system. He seemed almost… normal. Steve didn’t allow his mind to get carried away with this notion.
Tony huffed a sigh of relief. “Jesus, Cap, you had me worried the-“
“Stop!” Tony interrupted, getting to his feet in a less-than-graceful fashion. He tripped over his right foot, struggling not to let the wince on his face show. “I-I don’t want you here! You wanted to know why I called you last night? Because you were the only one who hasn’t seen me fucked up so bad that y-you change your goddamn cellphone number and move states.” Tony’s raw, hoarse voice echoed off of the expansive walls until the sound died out, leaving a chilling and cold silence. “So… so you can go now.” Tony swallowed hard, throat straining at the movement. He turned away from Steve, still clinging onto Steve’s jacket around his shoulders. “You’ve served your purpose and you can go home f-feeling good about yourself. You’ve done your good samaritan act for the day, spandex.”
In which Steve gives an AI the silent treatment and promises that he isn't leaving.
Just as the water had begun to steam up the mirror and the sleek walls, he cranked the knob to cold and waved a hand beneath the chilly water before he remembered that, no, he wouldn’t appreciate having a flashback to his time in the ice so early in the morning- even if it was 11 AM. Begrudgingly, he dialled the knob back to lukewarm and finally allowed himself to step under the stream.
“Can’t we save that sob story? I-I just spent the last twenty minutes watching life flash before my eyes.”
“No, it’s just flatulence,” Tony snapped sarcastically. “Of course it’s the reactor.”
Tony didn’t respond, just nodded silently. A nod that said,
“Then get under the covers.”
“I’m serious, Tony. You’re not going to be having showers for at least a month and I hardly trust you to walk, let alone get into a tub.”
Steve didn’t know what Tony had been on about; it took him far less than three minutes to gather all of the pieces into a dustpan- however, it did take him around seven just to
“Of course it is. It’s me.” Tony shrugged, flashing a comical expression that practically read,
“We can fix this,” Steve vowed, lowering his gaze to press his nose into the brunette hair. Coffee, machinery, and shampoo- it was perfect. “We’ll find a great rehab a-and-“
“I’ll miss you,” Tony pouted and, yeah, it was certainly just a fever. A fever. Thankfully, the other climbed onto the sheets, collapsing on his back in a show of over-dramatics. Steve dimmed the lights.
“I’m gonna take you downstairs, then, alright?” Steve informed gently. “I need you to hold this on the wound.” He grasped Tony’s hand and pressed it down on the maroon towel. He struggled to press down his panic when his hands drew away wet and red from just holding the towel. “I’m gonna pick you up, alright? Is this okay?”
————————————————————
Tony barked out a laugh, shaking his head. He sniffed, struggling to draw in a bout of tears that seemed to leap toward his eyelids. “It’s funny,” he replied, laughing disdainfully at his own pain. “B-because they’re holding me under, right? And usually, when it’s
Tony sniffled, then wiped any remnants of emotion from his face with his arm. Finally, he allowed himself to show. His eyes still contained a redness that was a trademark of tears, skin flushed and red even without the fever. To most, it would be unattractive- to most. To Steve, it was nothing short of determined, brave.
“Does Stark hear about all these things that you pick up on?”
Instead, all that he could manage was, “just because.”
Steve said nothing.
Steve continued and they sat like that, cradling each other almost subconsciously and with no inhibitions, for what seemed like only moments. In reality, Steve felt his heart jump to realize that he had been rambling for around fifteen minutes, Tony clinging onto him and simply listening.
Tony stayed silent. Steve wanted to pull a reply from the man’s mouth, to let Tony berate him and curse him out; it would feel better than the eerie quiet that came over them. Despite this, Steve couldn’t help himself. He was afraid. He was afraid to mess this up.
No response. Steve turned to the nurse- whom he’d forgotten was still present- and felt his jaw clench.
Tony’s form was crouched between the toilet and the bathtub, hunched over himself. On his side, he had pressed a large white bath towel- well, what had once been white.
a broom on the entire floor of the tower. Of course, he should have expected Tony to have some fancy disposal. He dropped the shards into what looked to be a garbage can only to see them disappear from sight into what he could only assume was some sort of black hole that led into the vacuum of space and spat out the ceramic somewhere near Jupiter, knowing Tony.
“You alright?” He asked quickly, wincing as the startled boy in his arms began to cry. He outstretched the boy toward his mother only to see, much to his disgust, that her hands were too busy snapping pictures on her cellphone and grinning because
“Leftmost cupboard over there,” Tony replied, voice laboured. Steve ignored that- or tried to. He was bringing back a large marked container in moments, cracking it open and rifling for the needed supplies.

“Daddy, don’t cry,” Peter sniffled, prying away Tony’s hands and beginning to smear his hands across Tony’s face to clear away the tears. “W-why are you crying, daddy?”
“What? Baby, no,” Tony interrupted, a concerned look crossing his face. He propped himself up on one elbow. “No, honey, you never have to be sorry, I’m the one that needs to be sorry. I-I should have been… better.” Tony’s weak smile began to fade as he struggled to hold back emotion.
“Hey,” Steve coaxed, the memory of the scarred chest still visible clearly in his mind’s eye, even after Tony had covered it up again and collapsed onto his back again, staring at the ceiling in resignation. “I understand.”
Then, there was no more talking. Nothing more; full halt, full stop. Steve’s heart slowed, slowed, and felt like it stopped beating altogether. Tony’s lips were pressed to his own and it was just Tony.
“J-just shut up,” Tony choked, voice weak and feeble. “I should have b-been better.” Steve’s lips parted, prepared to defend Tony but he was quickly shushed before he could. “I thought, it’s was a win-win. I-I survive the crash and get some more pills o-or I…” He didn’t have to finish- and Steve didn’t want him to.
No response. Steve waited…. waited….
Unfortunately, the moment passed nearly as quickly as it had come. Once his skin became red hot under his grasp and immediately unbearable in its oversensitivity, he dropped his hand away and sniffed halfheartedly, scrunching his nose at the sight of white streaks over the red shower curtains. He splashed water over the marks until they were mostly faded and finished his work quickly, struggling to push his momentary fantasy from his mind. It was just a fantasy. Just a thought.
Tony pursed his lips in a disappointed expression, crossing his own arms over his chest- just below where the arc reactor glowed- in a mirror image of Steve. “C’mon, stripes, are you pulling my leg?”
to Tony. Tony had his secrets, so Steve could have his own. Even though he knew that Tony had been outed as a raging bisexual a year after his “I am Iron Man” speech, he doubted the man would
heart palpitations. Despite the affirming gesture, Tony still remained unsure, not taking any motion to actually
“Another game?” Steve asked, a lopsided smirk on his face. He clearly didn’t expect a response, so he took the silence as a ‘yes.’ His large hands began to move the pieces back to their starting places with only the click of plastic against plastic and the hum of the fluorescent light serenading them. He placed the last pawn in its place.
“You care because you pity me.”
“No.”
” Tony’s fingers wound around Steve’s, a pale and sluggish expression sprouting a forced smile. “It’s going to be okay. I-I’m fine, okay? It’s gonna be fine, spangles. I need you to c-calm down, though. Can you, uh… can you do that for me?” His tone was shockingly sincere and almost out of character. Steve felt a buzzing inside of him begin to still, a warmth settling down in his chest and blossoming outward like glowing flame. Warm.
A slammed door. Steve awoke with a start. Beside him, where his arm rested, was warm with body heat- but no body. It took moments for the man to compute the absence and sit upright, immediately sprinting into combat mode; where had Tony been taken to? Who was he taken by? Steve’s breaths came shallower, reserving energy and-
Steve turned at this, eyes drawing down
“I’m sorry,” he mumbled, sniffing.
A relatively uncomfortable silence settled over them, Steve flustered and struggling to think up something to say. No, of course he wasn’t a virgin, but he surely didn’t want to reveal
“You’re not your meds, Tony,” he stated calmly, though his heart broke at the thought that Tony would think such things. “You’re not weak for taking them- you’re actually pretty strong for fighting what you’re afraid of.”
“No.” Steve shook his head despite that he knew Tony would not see the gesture. “I think it’s a good kind.”
“No, don’t fucking pawn me off to some nuthouse like they all have! I-I-I can’t do it- fuck, please-“ he was literally begging, hysterical and heaving tearful breaths. What was once were reddened cheeks were now blanche white, appearing sickly with anxiety. Steve’s stomach flipped, complete helplessness washing over him with the given situation. Tony’s fingers tightened in Steve’s.
This one is quite messy so sorry about that haha.
“Because I care about you.” Steve finally settled with, swallowing hard in order to fight back the lump in his throat as it threatened to well over into his words.
Steve dismounted the bike and shouldered his way between two cameramen, struggling not to feel the hot breath of the media on the back of his neck. Despite his best efforts to keep his head down and remove the yelling voices from his mind, one question remained there:
“I didn't expect you to say anything.” Finally, the empty air was broken. “I would have taken you back anyways.”
Steve hadn’t really expected that from Tony. He’d moreso expected mockery or jokes cracked at his expense. Instead, there was a surprising amount of sympathy- no, empathy- in the other man’s expression. “I thought you’d think it’s stupid,” Steve chuckled weakly, resting his fingers against the grainy surface of the paper. A small hum of laughter came from the other, one of mutual agreement and understanding, almost.
“I-I…” Steve began, face a comical expression of guilt. “I just need to get out, Tony,” he explained. Tony’s non-verbal communication stayed the same, not moving from his unimpressed stance.
“We’ll just park further away from the entrance, I guess,” Steve mumbled to himself. The engine purred to life as he turned the key in the ignition and, yes, he had to admit that the steady rumble of the vehicle was certainly satisfying. Tony seemed to think so too, leaning back and allowing himself to settle.
He could almost imagine Tony in there, lounging about, doing something Tony-like such as discussing innovative, new ideas and thoughts with his AI. He’d mentioned that Fitzgerald was toilet reading; maybe rocket science was his in-shower entertainment. Steve began to undress and the image continued to play out in his mind; of Tony soaping his hair with his lithe, toned arms extended up and toward the ceiling. He fabricated an image of Tony leaning over to reach a fallen bottle of conditioner. He looked into the mirror to see a bad case of morning wood. He scoffed at his overwhelming human-ness.
Tony’s eyes were open, staring into nothingness. For a moment, Steve’s blood chilled. The deep cut in his eyebrow was inflamed and red, stitches only more angry due to the blossoming purple and black bruises around the bones there. A white tube was draped over his ear, curling over his still face and disappearing into his nose. Finally, a blink. Steve released a breath that he didn’t know he had been holding.
Steve scoffed to himself, a smirk tugging at his lips as he read into Jarvis’ words and almost heard a note of irritation. He knew that he was likely imposing his own emotions onto the AI, since it was only an AI, but it struck him as funny nonetheless. “What about him? Do you monitor him just as closely?”
That was enough to break Tony, the man pushing Peter’s hands away so that he could cover his own face. Steve was by his side immediately, running a comforting hand over his back as he sobbed. At first, Peter’s face held dejected confusion. Had he hurt daddy? Then, Tony was sitting up and pulling Peter into his lap, giving a gentle hug as if he were afraid to break the young boy.
“Is there anything I can help you with?”
“Tired,” came the reply. Steve didn’t ask of what. Steve’s fingers curled around Tony’s, frowning at the trembling sensation that was there. The skin was cold.
Tony expected that he would be left.
“I’m serious,” Steve insisted quietly. He didn’t allow his mind to wander, no. He didn’t imagine the next time that something similar would happen. He didn’t recall the expressions of horror on Natasha and Bruce’s faces when Tony’s arc reactor had been shattered during combat once. He didn’t think about those things. He didn’t.
let him live it down if he knew that America’s sweetheart swung the same way as he did.
“I want you.”
“Didn’t know if you’d understand,” Steve admitted. “I-I guess I know now.”
“There. Does it feel like I’m leaving?”
If there was one thing that the man did not expect, it was the sheer wave of emotion which capsized at the robotic voice, practically bristling with irritation. ‘The greater good?’ ‘His service to the team?’ Steve knew that it was completely irrational to become angry at a damn
Silence.
Song for this chapter:
“You know, some around the watering hole have… speculated… that you’ve never put it in.” Tony’s expression was the picture perfect, carbon copy of a bratty child who'd just smudged black paint all over the kitchen walls. Naked.
———————————————————
“We did a good job of fucking that up for b-both of us, didn’t we?”
“Wow, Cap, years in the war and you can’t sleep because of a little hum?” Tony shot back, a heavy sigh escaping from him. What followed was more uncomfortable silence.
“You promised,” Tony responded quickly, his fingers tugging at Steve’s sleeve persistently. “You promised that you wouldn't leave.”
“Stop,” Tony demanded suddenly, sniffling. “D-don’t even say that. This is all me, Steve- all the meds are good for is to mask it.”
“Can’t I come to say hi?” Tony plopped himself down beside Steve, releasing a breath of exhaustion and leaning his head back against the pillow, eyes falling closed. Steve’s eyebrows only cast an even darker shadow over his blue gaze.
“Why, then?” He challenged, voice hushed despite the staggering amount of malice within it. “Why didn’t you tell me that he was in pain?”
Steve paused. Was this really too much for him to handle on his own? He’d fought HYDRA face to face and had survived seventy years after careening a craft full of bombs into the ocean. Could he really not handle taking care of one man by himself?
“Dandy,” Tony dismissed, sucking in a lungful of air. He used the countertop to support him, flushing and turning to the sink to rinse his mouth. Steve pushed the door open further, leaning on the doorframe as he surveyed Tony. The man’s hair looked painfully matted, sticking this way and that with no purpose or position. It was clear that he was far overdue for a shower.
“You’ll survive.”
“Keep it on the down low, Tony,” Steve repeated, staring into Tony’s pools of brown with his own blue ones. Really, he could only see the general iris of Tony’s eye in the poor lighting and wasn’t able to stress himself over the size of Tony’s ever-fluctuating pupils.
A pause. “I… didn’t think of that.”
Nothing, then a simple nod.
Tony clearly wouldn’t make a move toward Steve, only an expression of clouded shame masking his expression. The tears flooded there, glossing over his reddened eyes though he made no movement. Steve stepped forward hesitantly and clasped their hands together- or, at least, Tony’s free hand. There was a silence. Tony’s face fell and he allowed his forehead to rest on Steve’s broad chest. His shoulders shook.
“So…. you care about me like a-a friend?”
Steve’s stomach dropped. “Let me in.”
To be honest, Steve had no
“You care because I’m your team-mate and you have to, Rogers.”
“We should probably get you in the bath,” Steve recommended, tilting his head slightly. Tony chuckled weakly, sniffing as if sick.
“Guess so,” Steve responded quickly, dismissively. “This is a nice bathroom.”
“No! I-I-“ Steve sputtered, arms thrown out suddenly to the side in an expression of shock. He didn’t even want to look into the floor-to-ceiling mirror beside them to see his horrified face. “Of course I’m not a virgin! I’m a grown man!”
Steve huffed out a frustrated breath, realizing suddenly that Tony was certainly not in his right mind. Upon closer inspection, Tony looked even more worn out than earlier, though his energy remained bubbly and driven. He looked as though he’d been involved in yet another crash, looking as though he had two black eyes for how dark and deep the circles around them were. However, the tremors had stopped completely and he no longer was a sickly shade of green from before, strangely recovered. His pupils were pinpricks swimming in his irises.
Steve swallowed down a persistent knot in his throat and he slung an arm around Tony’s shoulder, urging him to keep his head down. “We need to go,” Steve muttered, pacing quickly in the opposite direction of the crowd that had begun to form. Tony stumbled over his own feet in order to keep pace with the larger man, curling his own hand into Steve’s jacket to keep himself steady.
Tony drew in a sharp breath through clenched teeth, tugging at the white material of the shirt. When he spoke, his throat strained. “Still want you, though.”
Steve couldn’t quite decipher if he had been the one to pull Tony away from the small girl or if it had been an animalistic reaction on Tony’s part to stumble backward as if he’d been singed. Either way, Steve grasped the medicines, looped his arm around Tony, and darted to the exit.
“What is?”
Tony smiled, thin-lipped, painstakingly. “Good.” He patted the back of Steve’s palm firmly and withdrew. “Now, uh, let’s get this sh-show on the road, if you don’t mind.”
“Heroin? Really?” Tony managed, his good hand going to clutch at his surely aching ribs. “You went straight to heroin? Jesus, Steve.”
“You… getting up?”
“Most people prefer it that way,” Tony pointed dully, breaking his sincere streak of confession by patting Steve’s cheek sarcastically and forcing a fake smile. “You’re not special. Y-you’ll figure it out the hard way if you stick around.”
“I’m not gonna sleep, you know. My everything hurts too much.”
“Steve,” Tony called and the man probably wouldn’t have heard the weak, raspy voice if not for his super hearing. He was at Tony’s side in a moment, looking down at the frail form. Tony had clearly gone into a feverish descent, though from what Steve didn’t know. His brow had broke out in a sweat, eyes blinking far too quickly. Steve knew that it killed the other to let himself be seen in such a state. However, he had hid it well up until such a point. “I-I… I need you to get me, um-“ he broke off, chewing his lip thoughtfully.
He almost didn’t expect to see a mess of brunette hair among the white sheets and if his dreams hadn’t startled him, the sight of Tony laying next to him certainly did. But there he was, facing away from Steve- just like he’d been doing for decades now. Part of the man wished, longed to see the way that the white-yellow hue of the sunlight illuminated his face, if it brightened the deep purple beneath the brown eyes. The flyaways of his messy bedhead illuminated the space around him in a blurred halo. It seemed ironic, and yet suited him. If only he could reach out to lay them down, to feel them slip in-between his fingers like sand or water or… or…
“Still feels like it, though,” he whispered mostly to himself, biting down hard on his lip as if to ward off another impending burst of tears. His fingers reached feebly for Steve’s and the other responded by fitting his palm firmly into Tony’s. They stayed like that for a while, Tony’s eyes having fallen to stare at their interlaced hands. “Jarvis, lights.” He said simply, releasing a breath of relief when the bathroom was plunged into a steady darkness, only the feeble light from the ajar door casting a glow on their feet.
Tony rolled his eyes in irritation. “Please, treat me a little more like an idiot-“
“I know, I know.” Steve’s eyes scanned manically for the young woman, whirling around with the intent to pace urgently to the counter and pay for the basket full of medicine. What he saw caused his heart to skip. The woman was no longer at the computer or rustling around in the medications behind the counter. No, she was huddled closely with her friend just behind the cash register, giggling and whispering. They each had an iPhone clutched in their hands.
Of course drinking problems were serious; of course they were. It was simply that Steve had heard more about it than any other illness he had come to know. He had known many people who had depended a bit too heavily on their liqueurs and would crack open a bit more than a cold one at the end of the day. In his time, he was used to hearing about alcoholism- hell, he was shocked to hear how taboo drunk driving had become while he’d been in the ice.
“How long? H-how long has this been… going on?”
“Tony?”
“You’re so fuckin’ dull, Rogers,” Tony muttered, shaking his head sadly. “I-I’m not… I’m…” His words trailed away from him and he seemed to be grasping at the frayed ends, struggling to piece something,
Then the sheets were… wet? The white bedding was no longer white. Red. Red.
“You’ve been through so much worse,” Steve insisted, sucking in a sharp breath. “Tony, you’ve been through so much worse than this and made it out, please-“
“Um, yeah,” Steve replied, retracting his stare from Tony’s face and directing it back to the task at hand.
“It’s enough- you’re enough. All by yourself.”
“No, baby, not scared of you.” Steve paused, drawing in a deep and difficult breath. “He was scared of himself. He was scared… he was scared that he would be a bad father for you, just like his daddy was.”

The man was curled up on the seat, knees pulled to his chest in a position which would be simply impossible for Steve to achieve. From afar, he likely just looked to be a bundle of oversized clothing, hood pulled up in an attempt to hide his face from the other- and previously from the public. Shaking. Not that Steve expected much more.
Song for this chapter:
So Steve sat outside of the door, lips pressed together as if to will himself to keep quiet. In the past, Steve would have dialled Nick Fury’s number and demanded, for the sake of America or some other stretched truth, that the man allow him to read Tony’s files. Fury would have scoffed, refused for a half-hour or lecturing, then eventually handed over the folder with some ultimatum or warning. Unfortunately, such a thing was no longer an option with S.H.I.E.L.D having been disbanded. Now, if there was any information, it was likely either hidden under government lock-and-key or had been burned up in a spectacular show of fire and explosions.
“You have a fever.” That was why. “You only want me here be… because you have a-a fever.”
“Who does?” He said instead, offering a comforting expression.
“Are you joking, pops? The Great Gatsby is an All-American classic during this century.” Tony scoffed. “Also, um, I’m one of the world’s greatest geniuses of our time; Fitzgerald is toilet reading to me.”
“The reactor?” Tony released a strangled chuckle, thought the grin didn’t reach his eyes. One of his hands came to rest over his shirt, just where the blue light filtered through. “Let’s just say you’re not the only one who’s seen war first-hand.”
Song for this chapter:
“What reputation?” Steve insisted, louder this time.
Steve set his pencil on the pad, sliding the surface against the couch and settling it on the arm of the chair. With conviction now, driven completely by a bead of moisture which had sprung forth on his brow, he turned to wholly face the other man, fixing his arms on the other’s shoulders. Steve crossed his legs in front of him almost in an anchoring position, his full attention laid on the other. Tony blinked in surprise at the sudden change, drawing back in an animalistic instinct. He flinched. Steve didn’t want to read too much into that.
Silence.
“Tony!” Steve called, rising to his feet and following after the other. “I just want to help you! I just want to understand.”
“I know.”
“What…?” Steve murmured weakly, expression falling into a frown of deep concern. “I-I… is it the palladium again? I thought you’d-“
“Just today or…?”
Tony’s bottom lip jutted out in a pout. “But I’m hurt,” he protested, cradling his side dramatically.
Steve wanted to tell the cashier. “
“What are you, chatting up my AI?” Tony’s sharp voice cut into Steve’s thoughts and his heart leapt as he swivelled to face the man, breathing out a breath of relief once he realized that there was no malice or awareness on Tony’s face; it was clear that he hadn’t heard the conversation.
Song for this chapter:
The smaller man pursed his lips and shot Steve an unimpressed look, only serving to fuel his irritation. It was quite honestly a comical sight, the world’s most well-known billionaire buried beneath thick clothing twice his size. In Steve’s jacket, he looked almost like a child. In addition, Tony had pulled up the hood after lamenting that the bright fluorescent lighting in the store was irritating his eyes.
Steve's first hour alone with Tony is basically what he had expected.
Tony continued to face forward, staring emptily out the window. His shaking had died down if only slightly and his shoulders had come down from his ears, a still silhouette against the morning light. He shrugged in response. Then there was nothing. There was more heavy, heavy silence.
A quick errand gone wrong.
“Tony!” Steve growled, spinning the bottle of Aspirin in his hand and struggling to read the small print. “Just give me a minute, I’m-“
Neither men spoke until Steve had nearly finished, running his fingers though the wet strands. Tony’s eyes blinked open sluggishly and he sighed contentedly.
Steve began with washing Tony’s hair, gently soaping the strands and rinsing the bubbles into the tub. Throughout, Tony remained completely silent, seeming to be completely lost in his thoughts. Steve thought nothing of it- one would have to be stupid not to know that Tony was clearly under the influence of
They were the only two in the place, so Steve didn’t need to turn when he heard the elevator begin to whirr, signalling that Tony was moving about somewhere in the place. Steve hadn’t expected that he would sleep, especially since it was only 11 PM- which, Steve had learned, was practically 3 PM for Tony Stark. He was probably on his way down to his workshop to tinker away endlessly and manically unit Steve came to drag him to bed. The man kept his gaze down to where the only light in the dark room shone, a lamp curled to aim directly at the page in his lap. He focused himself and continued to shade in the dips and curves of the portrait’s upper lip.
“Then just try,” Steve prompted, reaching out to run his fingers through Tony’s unkempt hair who practically purred at the sensation.
In the rearview mirror, tens of people had spilled out into the parking lot, watching their idols flee from beneath the haze of the rain. He didn’t even want to try driving toward the crowd, so he pressed his foot down on the gas and exited via the entrance to the lot.
“Once, I broke my own window because I thought Hydra was in my house.”
This one is a lil' short.... but also a lil' steamy. Some good ol' fantasizing this chapter so WARNING: soft smut ahead
“No.”
“But I… Tony, I mean it.” Steve insisted, his tone cracking on the last syllables. He followed Tony’s movements, sitting up and pushing closer. Tony flinched under the touch of his hand. “I… I’m smitten, Tony- and that’s not pity.”
“Alright,” Steve turned away to fetch new clothing because
Tony gritted his teeth, eyes squeezing shut in concentration. “D-do you know how?”
“The light h-hurts.”
“You know,” Steve began gently, “not everyone in my time was straight.”
But all be damned, if Steve himself couldn’t understand Tony, he couldn’t expect a being who thought in ones and zeros to comprehend the true nature of pain; the pain that lay within the mind.
“… we will have some paperwork for you to fill out in a while. For now, make yourself comfortable. We should be able to release him by 8 AM.”
“Why didn’t you come back?”
“Bad dream,” Peter sniffed, wetting Tony’s shirt with his tears and-
“I don’t.” Steve settled for saying simply. Even despite the protests, his arms slung around Steve’s neck. Skin to skin, warmth on warmth. A small smile came to Steve’s lips.
“For me. Would you… would you do it for me?” It was more than a suggestion; a request, almost.
“No more playboy,” Tony offered, feigned amusement a sorry attempt to pass the situation off, “no more suntanning.” A crack. A break in his voice.
“Steve-“
Steve grimaced, trying not to think of what would happen next. He stepped forward, finding the hem of Tony’s shirt and tugging upward, allowing for Tony to maneuver his cast out of the material. Once the shirt was discarded, Tony dropped the floral print boxers to the ground and
Tony’s eyebrows creased together in a pained look, fingers on his good hand pulling idly at a loose thread on his shirt. Twirling, twirling nervously. “Nevermind,” he forced out, shaking his head for what felt like the hundredth time. “It’s nothing. I-I didn’t want it to be weird. Okay, capsicle?” Tony tried to cover up the discomfort with a grin, rolling his shoulders back and releasing a breath.
“W-where’s d-d-daddy?” Peter forced out, voice raw and scratchy. Steve paused, eyes searching the darkened room for a figure. It seemed that, during the whole process, Tony had left. Steve felt an overwhelming grief strike him and regretfully, even some irritation that Tony hadn’t cared to help. He knew it was wrong, but that didn’t stop the thought from entering his mind.
“You stop,” Steve countered, voice soft to contrast Tony’s urgent one. “This might be a part of you, but it’s not all of you. And don’t try arguing with me because I’m not gonna have this conversation when you’re not thinking straight. We both know it’s not gonna solve anything.” His tone was still quiet, but his orderly military mannerisms had begun to take over. He knew, after being with Tony for so long, that people needed different things when they were panicking- what Tony needed was to feel safe, so he provided that steady hand by remaining confident and level-headed.
“C’mon, don’t get cold feet on me now,” Tony chuckled, though he pulled away nevertheless. However, he didn’t make any move to stand.
“I had expected Captain America to be a prude, but you’re really living up to your reputation.”
Steve suddenly felt quite sick.
“But you
Finally, Peter’s sobs calmed enough that he could reach a shaky palm out to clasp Steve’s. Steve allowed himself to smile, stroking the clammy fingers comfortingly. “I’m gonna put your hand on my chest and you’re gonna match my breathing- like a game. You ready to play? Okay, here.” Steve helped Peter into a position where he could reach Steve’s ribs, the small boy giving in and pressing both palms flat to Steve’s chest. He still continued to cry, though his shaking breaths were noticeably longer, struggling to match Steve’s.
“Y’know, the doctors are kind of, uh, taught to get on your ass about shit so,” Tony began, stumbling over the words. “I really don’t think you need to be treating this like it’s some goddamn mission.”
“What do you mean?” Steve prompted. Quite honestly, he prepared for the worst- for Tony to pull away and stalk off to bed.
“You come on,” Tony muttered, his other hand working to comb through the sandy-blonde hair. “If I were in your position, which I have been many times, you would have me strapped down to the bed.”
A shallow cough, then more silence.
“Shh,” Steve comforted, pulling him closely again. This time, Tony wrapped his arm around the large torso and clung, white-knuckled and laced onto the fabric of his shirt. “Okay. Okay. Take deep breaths with me,” he encouraged. He then attempted to copy the other’s earlier gesture, clapping twice. The light dimmed, then flickered out.
A laugh came from Tony, his eyes lighting up with a sad sort of humour. He threw his head back, chuckling briefly before he maintained himself, ruffling a hand through his wet hair. The outburst was genuine, that smile that few ever saw from Tony stark; the kind where a grin was pulled across his rugged face and his eyes wrinkled at the corners. Somewhere in there, though, there was deep pity- for Steve or for himself, he didn’t know.
Tony’s jaw locked and his gaze fell, sucking in a calming breath through his teeth- it didn’t work. Steve could still feel the shaking, could still feel the dam of emotion about to be swept in by the tide. “You don’t,” he disagreed, shaking his head slowly. “Not a good idea, spangles. I-I don’t deserve it.” Steve felt something within him pound at the words, wishing to scream a resounding defiance at the words because
“You could just stay here-“
“Bucky didn’t sleep for four nights in a row once.” Steve wasn’t sure how talking about Bucky would help their situation, but it seemed appropriate in the time. “He’s got PTSD too, you know. I think we… I think we all do. I-I ended up having to chase him for half a mile before I finally quit and waited for him to tire out. Found him crouched in the mud and scratching at himself until he bled. That’s only one of the times that I’ve had to pin him down and wait for the flashbacks to pass.”
“No, I’m getting your medicine. I’ll be back in twenty seconds.”
“I don’t need water. Step to it, man-with-a-plan,” Tony insisted rudely , extending his arm over the arm of the couch and making a pinching motion with his fingers as if to say ‘give them to me’.
This time, it was Steve’s turn to be silent. Blinking, blinking… more blinking.
“It’s my time of th-the month,” Tony joked dryly, though his state was no laughing matter. Every possible colour had drained from his cheeks and now was a ghostly pale instead.
I think this was my favourite to write so far... things are picking up speed!
“Leave me alone.”
“You’re gonna make me walk across the parking lot to the CVS?” Tony questioned, a disgusted tone creeping into his words. Steve merely let out an irritated huff.
“Was that the one I gave you?”
Tony shook his head, eyes falling closed almost in an expression of concentration. He waved his hand dismissively. When Steve began to walk back to the scene, Tony quickly caught his wrist with surprising grip, continuing to shake his head ‘no’.
At first, Steve wanted to roar in frustration something like
“Then… do it for the greater good.”
“Hello?”
“Hey,” Steve murmured, shocking himself with how abruptly gentle his tone was. “Hey, hey, what’s wrong?” His right palm left Tony’s shoulder and smoothed over his head, covered protectively by the large hood. Tony hadn’t stopped shaking for twelve hours, but now it felt as though his bones were rattling together with the force of it.
“Daddy?” He murmured, little hands reaching to stroke at Tony’s face.
“I used to panic every time they recapped our defeat of the Tchitari on the news. C-couldn’t watch television for six months.”
“Someday,” he began slowly, lowering himself so that he sat with his back pressed to the door, a mirror image of what he knew Tony was doing on the other side. He was struggling to keep his pounding heart from jumping into his throat and suffocating his words. “I want you to tell me about Afghanistan.”
An uneasiness churned in Tony’s gut when he considered the idea of Steve with another person.
Tony pouted as he was sat in a chair in front of a spread of various cheeses, crackers, and slices of exotic meats. Steve cocked one eyebrow. “You got this for
“Tony, Tony, whoa, calm down, hold your horses!” Steve had to grab Tony’s face between his hands and force him to look at Steve. A blush arose on Tony’s cheeks and he was fighting tears as Steve pulled him into a hug. One large hand firmly rubbed Tony’s back, another hand cradling the back of his neck. “Shh… I didn’t mean anything like that.”
I swear to god—”
His excitement was barely contained until DUM-E sprayed him briefly with cold water. He yelped and shook, muttering grievances towards his creation as it dropped the hose and hurried off to its charging station and
He had every intention of telling Tony this would be their last appointment together. That had been the plan. He didn’t feel… right. It wasn’t right to keep going like this when he knew the truth and Tony did not. He risked a glance back towards the bed. Tony had his eyes closed, breathing softly and calmly. Steve felt a rush of pride for having helped Tony to that state. Except... it had been Captain America, in Tony’s eyes. Tony wanted Captain America. He tried his best to remember roleplay was just that— it was play. A game. Steve shouldn’t be taking it to heart, and yet it aches in his chest.
“Can’t stop you, but if you get off without my permission, you definitely won’t like the consequences,” Steve said. Something in Tony’s mind made him think he definitely
It had to be Tony.
Tony’s eyes followed Steve as he knelt on a rolled-up towel beside the tub. He could not quite pinpoint the reason he was confused as to why Steve was not joining him in the bath. Was it because this wasn’t on the list? For a list a mile long, Tony managed to omit
