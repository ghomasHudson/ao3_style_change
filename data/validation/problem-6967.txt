When he placed a gentle hand on Tony's shoulder, it might as well have been a zap with a cattle prod.
Stark's eyes darted across the page. He paused bringing his drink half way up before setting it down. His stare intensified as he flipped quickly through the pages.
Bucky looked down at it sheepishly. "It got caught on something. It was really damaged when I first woke up, but I guess when I shifted, the mermaid gift took care of it."
Tony let it go until they got all the armor off and he was sitting in his own undersuit with a half-drunk bottle of water in his hand. "Alright. So spill. What's up?"
A hand fell on their shoulders, and they both jumped. "I've got an idea," Nat said. "Where's Steve's pack?"
When Steve went to let it go, Tony pulled his hand close to sniff at it. He opened their hands, but Tony didn't let go. He opened and closed Steve's hand, looking between his fingers. "No wonder you humans are horrible at swimming." Tony released his and but bent down and grabbed at Steve's foot. He lifted a it up, and Steve fell back on his butt with an oof.
So far, he hadn't found anything, and the sun was just going to get higher. Still, he wasn't going to stop until he reached the end of the beach near where the docks jutted into the sea. There was a tiny nook, hidden from view by large rocks, where all kinds of stuff got trapped and washed up onto the sand. A lot of it was garbage thrown off the docks, but there was usually something worth a few pennies.
Only when he heard the front door close did Bucky finally get up to get dressed. It was Saturday, and he didn't have work, so he put on his thickest sweats and baggiest hoodie. The arm still wasn't responding much, but other than a quick struggle to put it through the sleeve, he didn't have trouble.
Tony took the phone away from his ear and muted it. "JARVIS, did some guy just ask me how to find The Google?"
Tony was in a pissy mood, so rather than letting it go to voicemail like he usually would, he answered it. "Tech Support. Here to fix all your screw-ups."
"Calm down?!" Tony snarled and took his hands down. The black cat ears on the top of his head angled back,  and the black tail poking out of his pants swished in agitation.
Tony's heart ached for him. He could never decide who had it worse:  the man who remembered everything of every lifetime and was consumed with the need to find the other half of his soul, or the man who remembered nothing but was overcome by an emptiness he couldn't understand. Steve always described it as a dark pit where his heart was suppose to be.
"Then it doesn't!" Tony said, waving the idea away with one hand, the other still clasped with Steve's. "If the day never comes that we officially tie the knot — our way, the way we want to — then it never comes. And I'll still never have any regrets. Because I don't need a piece of paper and some nice pictures and a cake to solidify that I love you."
He was reminded of his first, and last, USO show overseas. The soldiers had seen him as a clown in red, white and blue. He could acknowledge he hadn't proven himself at that point, but once he had, he'd never had to do it again with the men on the ground.
Steve lounged forward and wrapped his arms around the merman. Tony stiffened but relaxed and returned the embrace.
Tony squinted at him a moment. "Tell you what. You look like a man of integrity.  I'll let you try my Marvelous Iron Cupcake. If you think it's alright, you can skip the line and eat anything you want, free of charge, every morning for the rest of our lives, but. BUT. If it’s the best damn cupcake you've ever had, you'll have to get a tattoo of it."
Steve didn't notice at first, until Tony tilted his hand and blue glinted in the light. He gasped and looked at his hand more closely. There, nestled at the base between his fingers, was the beginnings of thin webbing.
Tony sobered. "You left, and I was swimming back home when I heard something hit the water. It was you."
Steve blinked at it and checked his watch. It was an unusual sight to see no line outside the door at 6:30.  The bakery was very popular, and people were willing to wait for hours just to get inside. He guessed he wasn't the only one deterred by the weather.
Steve frowned at the gear. It didn't feel right, leaving their equipment here without inspecting it and stowing it away. He looked over at Sam and Bucky. They looked as tired as he felt, but waited on Steve to make the call. That loyalty certainly couldn't go unrewarded. "Alright. Let's get some rest."
Bucky moved his hand like he was about to yell 'hey punk!' but Sam quickly grabbed his arm and brought it back down.
He heard a hush behind him and arms wrapped around his middle. "It's okay. It's okay, Steve. Just breath normal. I know you're panicking right now. It's scary, but you're okay. I promise. I promise, Steve."
"I won't be gone long," Bucky said, sipping at his cabbage broth. It was really all they could afford on Bucky's measly salary and any money Steve could bring in from trading in cans and the occasional odd job.
"I know. This is your phone." He slid it closer. He waited for Steve to meet him in the eye again. "In-person sessions aren't working. We both know that out in the field if a tactic doesn't work, we try a different approach. We don't go into a situation with only one plan. If the mission is important enough, then we don't give up until the job gets done."
Steve scrambled over. There were so many! He doubted he'd even be able to carry them all. He took a moment to wonder if he should leave it and bring Bucky back to help.
Steve looked towards the back of his parlor. He should really do some of the paperwork that’s piled up... Steve wasn't usually one for sweets, but Bucky and Sam never said no to a donut in the morning. This was probably the only opportunity he'd get.
"I'm wounded," Tony said with an exaggerated groan. "I send you a brand-spanking-new tablet, and you let it collect dust? I bet you haven't even checked your email, have you."
Steve's face felt like it was on fire. He rubbed at his hot cheeks, sure they were bright red under his beard. He cleared his throat. "Right. Yeah."
Tony gave a sad smile. "I'm sorry," he repeated. "I guess we just... We got complacent, right? Whenever we set a date for the wedding, we'd either be halfway around the world or so deep in battle we wouldn't remember until a week later that we missed our own wedding." Tony squeezed his hands again. "I know you don't want to elope, and honestly, neither do I. We just have to wait for the right moment."
"Don't worry about it. So, uh." He walked out of his bedroom, rubbing his forehead with enough pressure that he could feel his fingertips leaving indentations in his skin. He couldn't believe he was doing this. "I assume you have the computer on. What kind of computer is it?"
The shower had done a lot to relieve the tension in his shoulders, but Steve was still restless from the 'training exercise.' That was what Fury had called it anyway, but Steve had his doubts. It had been a mess. Even Natasha hadn't come out of it unscathed.
"If you need any suggestions, I'm full of them." Too many of them, if Pepper and Rhodey were anything to go by.
“Sorry, sweetheart,” Steve cheekily replies, not sounding sorry in the slightest as his hand winds its way around Tony’s waist and guides him through the mobs of people. “Would it make it better or worse if I told you that you and Peter were all I wanted for Christmas?” Tony gives him an exaggerated sigh in response and Steve releases a warm chuckle. “Yeah, I thought so. But seriously, you made my day — no, my year —- by doing this today.”
He watches Steve praise their giggling son and Tony can’t help but smile fondly at the two before he catches Steve staring warmly back. He schools his features, feigning annoyance at him when Steve walks towards him.
Tony looked around in confusion. “What? Why are you looking at me like that? Is there something on my face?”
He pointed up and Tony followed his finger to find a giant, gaudy mistletoe hanging above them. “I didn’t realize we were recreating
If Tony had his way, they wouldn’t even be at the mall. Tony had just mentioned that he wanted one of those cheesy pictures of Peter on Santa’s lap and Steve had taken that idea and ran with it. Instead of hiring a Santa to come to the tower like Tony had initially wanted, Steve had the notion that they needed to go all out and venture into an overly crowded place to get the full experience. Now that he’s been in line for thirty minutes and he still has at least twenty more to go, Tony is positive that Steve is getting coal for Christmas.
It’s a fleeting pity party though when Steve’s free hand pulls Tony over and nestles him against his broad, comfortable chest. Tony can see why Peter likes this because Steve’s body is warm and he smells delicious. If he closes his eyes, Tony can almost imagine that they are wrapped up on the couch at home with the heater roaring.
Tony's cock is straining severely against his thigh, with all the blood rushing south, he thinks he might die. He's needy and desperate, releasing soft whines, he knows Steve can sense it, can observe all the signs.
Santa is gingerly bouncing Peter on his knee and pointing to the gentleman behind the camera so he will look in that direction. He even whispers to Peter in what Tony only thinks can be him bribing him with the promise of a toy if he behaves. The poor photographer is also trying, doing everything in his power to grab Peter’s attention to no avail. He’s hollering, making funny faces and shaking toys, but Peter's eyes are locked on his parents.
“Welcome to married life, baby,” Tony says with a playful grin and a wink thrown in for full effect. “What’s yours is mine, pretty sure it was in the fine print.”
“Me ‘oo!” Peter happily chirps once Tony and Steve finally part lips. Tickled by their display of affection and not to be outdone, Peter makes sure to give them both a sloppy kiss on the cheek before cheering excitedly.
Two weeks. That was how long it took for Tony to come out of hiding. He stayed on lockdown and on the off chance he did need to navigate the tower, he used JARVIS to make sure that Steve was never in the vicinity. When he finally emerged,  it was him who pursued Steve, finding him in the gym in the early morning hours. Steve had halted his assault on the punching bag when he noticed the genius stalking towards him, and braced himself for a lecture or a punch thrown in a blind fit of rage that would have been well deserved, but he couldn’t have prepared himself for what came. Tony launched himself forward and smashed his lips into Steve’s, who toppled over in surprise at the action but never lost his tight grip on the smaller man, as they both fell to the padded mat below.
“Yeah, messy, not tetanus.” Tony smoothes a gentle hand down Peter’s back absentmindedly, smoothing out his little button-down shirt, a complete contrast to his passive-aggressive tone. “Besides, we’re here for pictures so he needs to be moderately presentable,” Tony offers as an afterthought. It’s a feeble attempt to keep his little baby in his arms, although it has less to do with the state of the dirty mall floor and everything to do with cherishing his son for as long as possible.
When the doctor left the room, the first thing Tony said to Steve was that he couldn’t marry him, which threw Steve for a loop. Tony was shouting hysterically, trying to stifle back sobs as he said anything to get Steve to leave his side. As the yelling ceased and only tears remained, Tony’s outburst came down to one fear, and Steve didn’t know how to fix it. The close call out on the field had only served as a reminder that Tony was just a man, and an older one at that. No serum would change the fact that Tony would continue to age and deteriorate until he died, leaving Steve alone in the world again. Tony’s death was a given, not a question, and Tony didn’t want to marry Steve, who would never physically age, because a day would come when he would be widowed. Steve did the only thing that ever worked at shutting up the blabbering genius, and kissed him, assuring him that a life with Tony Stark was better than one without, no matter how short it was.
Tony can’t even properly respond, too speechless from the cheesiness that’s been oozing from Steve’s pores all day long. He just nods and slinks under Steve’s arm, letting himself be guided to the exit, his enormous grin never leaving his face as he stares dreamily at his family.
Tony’s shirt is lifted and pulled over his head, discarded wildly with Steve’s own just past his bed. Then Steve’s hands settle on his hips before they gently tug down, until nothing is left on either of them, not a trace of clothing to be found.
“Okay, Uncle! Uncle!” Tony cries out, batting Steve’s face away to take another bite of the s’more still in his hand. “Jesus, I know I’m irresistible but I’m trying to eat here. I expected better of you since
“Oh baby, shh. You’re okay,” Tony soothes as he runs gentle circles on Peter’s back. “Daddy’s sorry for yelling, he’s not mad.”
Tony picked up their photo package and was pleasantly surprised. The picture was pretty adorable. Peter had given a large, radiant smile and he was looking straight at the camera, which was a miracle. And as silly as Tony looked, he could see his happiness in the picture too.
It had started small, with Tony complaining of stiff muscles. Steve would massage the affected areas but it never seemed to improve. He gradually became more and more unsteady on his own two legs. As he walked around the tower, Tony dragged his feet like they were made of lead and his legs barely supported them. The more movement he did during the day, the more Tony complained of how exhausted he was, which is when Steve felt the gravity of the situation hit him like a ton of bricks. In all the years he had known Tony, not once had he ever admitted to being tired. As his muscles weakened, Steve found Tony opting to sit a lot more, which only aided in the waning of what little strength he had left, until he couldn't even stand on his own.
“Stop,” Tony half-heartedly grumbles as he lightly swats at Steve’s chest. “I’m trying to be mad at you, handsome.”
As they work to calm their son, Steve has let other families take their photos. Some end up in the same boat as them, while the lucky few are in and done within minutes. Each time Tony thinks that Peter is ready to begin again and tries to set him back on Santa’s lap, he just clings tighter and his cries grow impossibly louder.
“Petey, bud, it’s just a picture and then you’re all done,” Steve tries to reassure. “Just say cheese, can you do that for Papa?”
His hand lifts Tony’s leg permitting him to thrust impossibly deeper, and Tony knows right away that Steve is a keeper. He’s groaning in pleasure, pleased with Tony’s performance, his sounds mixing with Tony’s pants as they collide like a chorus.
Steve pushes in deeper and does a come hither motion, making Tony cry out, no longer able to conceal his emotion. Steve is aiming now, seeking out that bundle of nerves, that will usher Tony closer to the orgasm he deserves.
The sunlight filtering through the floor to ceiling windows woke Steve from his slumber the following morning, as he laid in a tangled mess of sheets, where he found himself wrapped around Tony in his massive bed. For the first time in his life, Steve didn’t feel the need to rise at the crack of dawn, instead choosing to pepper gentle kisses across the brunette’s face. Tony was groggy and pliant as Steve ran his hands over the man’s tanned skin and they lost themselves in languid lovemaking. There was no rush to their movements or lingering heat from the night before, just a steady build to pleasure that left them sated and disheveled in bed for the rest of the day.
It’s finally fall in New York and Steve couldn’t be happier. Fall is by far his favorite season because the weather is just right - not enough chill to remind him of the cold and not overly hot for his always overheated body. Plus he enjoys the sunsets that cascade over the skyline of New York, painting it in breathtaking orange and pink hues that he loves to capture in his art.
Tony leans back, giving himself over to Steve, conveying his gratitude for whatever he'll receive. He's rewarded with blunt nails exploring his chest, traversing the expanses of skin like they're on a quest.
“Da!” Peter happily shrieks before erupting into a giggle fit as Tony’s beard tickles against his face.
Steve still remembers their first fight. The team had been separated in their quest to keep the remaining infinity stones out of Thanos’ reach. The man had been bigger, stronger and more conniving in his drive to attain the stones and in the end, the Avengers had failed. With his gauntlet completed, Steve and the rest of them had no choice but to fight the mad titan that held the power of the universe in his hand with everything they had. By the time Thor’s ax had severed Thanos’ head and the dust had settled, the team was bruised, beaten and bloody.
Tony looks into Steve’s eyes like he’s trying to see if this is somehow a trap, so Steve maintains eye contact and waits for Tony to nod and pick up one of the s’mores before he grabs his own. He takes a bite of his portion, aware of the eyes fixed on his expression to see if it twists in disgust. The s’mores are mouthwatering though so Steve has no issues swallowing and gazing expectantly at Tony for him to do the same.
Steve’s hands lightly sketch patterns over his hip, before tightening their hold in a bruising grip. A rut of Steve’s hips against his own makes Tony gasp, and he tightens his hold on the bedspread within his grasp.
from their phones — which I’m not sure if that’s amazing or terrifying yet,” Steve admits as his brows furrow adorably like he’s truly weighing the pros and cons of technology. He sighs and gestures around the chaos of the mall he’s dragged Tony to before turning his blue pleading eyes at Tony like he’s asking him to understand. “I guess I worry that like most children, he’ll probably have to mature faster to adapt. Before you know it, he’ll be a teenager that wants nothing to do with us, and one day he’ll even move out and start his own life.”
And whatever brownie points Steve’s all American looks just scored him vanish in an instant, which Tony makes known with another look of disdain. “I am this close to making you sleep on the couch,” Tony warns as he brings his thumb and pointer finger incredibly close together right in front of Steve. “I can’t believe I let you talk me into this. We could have paid for twenty Santa’s to come to the tower, but
“Trust me, you’ll love it. You want to try a bite?” Tony looks nervous like the innocent snack will strike at any moment, so Steve appeases him. “Look, I’ll eat it with you.”
“Yes, Steve,” Tony sarcastically agrees as he rolls his eyes. “At this rate, you’ll probably be the first to give me diabetes with all the sweets you leave around. My body has to be ninety percent sugar at this point.”
By the time the meeting had ended, Steve could still only think about the short-lived hysterics the genius exhibited. Tony was always so composed and the sight of him stock-still, like a deer caught in headlights, had been enough to make Steve’s stomach twist. As they made their way home and were free from prying ears, Steve asked what happened as nonchalantly as possible. There was no use making a big deal out of it if Tony’s mind had simply been running a million calculations at that moment, which is why it came as no surprise when Tony had merely brushed it off as nothing serious.
Steve just chuckles and pulls Tony against his chest, letting him sag against him and relieve some of the aches in his feet. As annoyed as he is with Steve for this ridiculous idea, he’s grateful for the reprieve. He huffs loudly just so Steve is aware that he’s still upset, but then slumps against him.
“Says who?” Tony idly strokes a hand through Peter’s unruly curls while he tries to not think about the future. He already knows he’ll be a blubbering mess when his boy is no longer an actual baby, but a smart, capable adult that doesn’t need his parents. “We could homeschool him,” Tony ponders aloud, even though he knows it’s a ridiculous notion. ”Plus, he has Dum-E, Butterfingers and U to play with. They love him and I could always make more bots. And, he is
Tony swivels his head beckoning for a peck; he’s sweaty and writhing, he must look like a wreck. Steve smiles back though and meets his mouth halfway, and Tony swears the room starts to sway.
Steve still remembers the phone call that brought him to tears. The Alzheimer’s had been a painstaking battle in their lives. Tony seemed to forget more and more, and with that came frustration. Steve tried to help, to be the shoulder Tony could lean on, but each time he tried to assist, Tony lashed out and became volatile. It was understandable, but it didn’t mean it hurt any less.
“Huh?” Caught off guard by the question, Steve follows Tony’s gaze to the plate of s’mores that he had long forgotten. “Oh, um, s’mores?” Steve’s confused, not sure why Tony seems so invested with his plate of food.
Lowering to one knee, Steve had asked Tony to marry him there in the penthouse bathroom. If Tony wanted to claim him and make his mark, there would be nothing better than a ring on his left hand to solidify their love. It was a promise to be Tony’s, forever and always. There was a sobbed yes heard from above as Steve released a breath he didn’t realize he was holding. That night they showed up two hours late to the event – after cleaning up the tear tracks littered down their faces and a hasty escapade that resulted in both of them needing a change of attire – and spent the evening sharing the news with the rest of their friends in attendance.
Christmas cliche in one outing,” Tony teased, not able to hide the blush creeping along his skin or the over the top smile he can’t resist giving. Steve doesn’t reply, just leans down and captures Tony’s lips with his in a sweet, tender kiss.
Steve still remembers the first time he said I love you. He knew he'd been pining for Tony since the battle of New York, and there was no mistaking that what he felt towards the man was pure unadulterated love. That phrase was always on the tip of his tongue threatening to spill out, but he kept his lips sealed and bid his time. Tony needed to say it first, come to the conclusion on his own, so that Steve knew he wasn't rushing him or moving too fast. The longer he waited in anticipation though, Steve became more nervous that Tony didn't feel the same way.
Tony’s body practically melts into Steve’s and he releases a content sigh of approval as he snuggles closer. “Mhm. FRIDAY has to run some simulations so I can’t do anything down there for the next few hours.” Tony cocks his head towards Steve and purses his lips, asking for a kiss that Steve happily returns. He smiles against Steve’s lips to murmur, “But, I can think of a few things we could do right here...”
They are still a few spots from the front and Tony considers calling it quits. He’s exhausted, a combination of lack of sleep from throughout the week and being denied extra caffeine this morning when he was rushed out to this hell hole. His body is just as tired from holding his growing boy for so long and just standing in one place for an extended period of time. Tony’s never been one to seek out sleep without being told to do so, but his bed sounds real good right about now, especially if Steve is cocooned around him.
Peter looks like he’s in the same boat from where he owlishly blinks at Tony from Steve’s shoulder, no longer having the fuel to stare in wonder at all of the decorations and those passing by. Tony is almost jealous of how relaxed he looks in Steve’s arms and for a brief few seconds wonders how outrageous of a request it would be to have Steve hold him too.
Peter will be taking over Stark Industries at twenty-one years old, the same age Tony was when he took control of the company. He's smart, nearly evenly matched to Tony's intellect. Steve knows his husband would be proud. Their son moved out at eighteen with his best friend. It made more sense for him to live in the tower, but Steve doesn't hold the decision against him. Peter tried to visit every weekend, which had turned into once a month, before he only met with Steve outside of the tower for lunch or dinner. Now, the only time he talks to Tony is on the phone. Seeing his father slowly decaying was just too hard.
“First off, you didn’t make these, I did,” Steve points out, setting the plate out of the way on the table. “So, technically I’m still taking care of you. Secondly, I made them for me and you came in like the damn Cookie Monster.”
When it came down to it, the right moment had been before a huge gala they were attending for the September Foundation. Tony had been fixing his suit in the mirror and grumbling to himself in what appeared to be frustration. Steve had thought it might have been nerves, but when he embraced the smaller man to ask, the answer surprised him. His shirt had been pulled to the side to reveal a large love bite that Steve had left days ago, perfectly concealed under his attire. Tony had been frustrated that Steve could lay a claim to him that told the world he was taken, but Tony would never be able to return the favor. Steve had never hated the serum coursing through his veins more than at that moment.
Then he feels the bed dip and puffs of breath ghost across his skin before lips kiss his shoulder feeling like sin. This cannot be real knowing Tony’s luck, but a look behind him surrenders him awestruck.
He thinks of all the skin hidden beneath Steve’s tight shirts, and the way he might taste sweet just like dessert. His dreams feel so real he imagines hearing Steve’s voice, and Tony wonders if he’d desire him if he was offered the choice.
Now, its just Steve and Tony. It's kind of poetic in a tragic way. Their story had started with the two of them and it would end the same way. He still loves him. Sometimes, he wishes he didn't, then maybe this whole experience wouldn't hurt as much. Every single day Steve tells Tony stories about their time together, updates him on Peter, tells him what Rhodey and Pepper are up to and declares his love for him all over again. It's the same speech each time and it never gets any easier, and Tony never acknowledges him with a response, although sometimes Steve imagines a glint in Tony's eyes that gives him hope that some of what he's saying is getting through.
Steve still remembers starting their family. Tony had been watching an overabundance of cheesy romantic comedies and a creepy amount of time fondly ogling families that they passed on the streets. They had never talked about children or starting a family, but Steve could tell it must be on Tony's mind. He never would have taken his husband as a family man - assuming he was content with his bots and A.I.'s - but Tony was always surprising him in the best ways. Steve waited for Tony to bring the issue up himself which happened to take a lot longer than he expected. He had hinted towards it and threw out generalized statements a few times, but Steve never took the bait, wanting Tony to ask for what he desired and know that Steve would provide. It took weeks of Steve feigning ignorance at Tony's hints before his husband finally blurted the question out as they were driving home from dinner. He wanted a baby, a bundle of joy that he could raise with Steve.
Steve smiles and Tony is slightly relieved to see that he doesn’t look so downtrodden anymore, but instead is amused with Tony’s hijinks. “Sweetheart, he has to go to school, make friends and eventually date.”
He’s settling in on the couch for a presumably quiet night with his book and homemade snack in hand when Tony finally surfaces from his dungeon he calls a workshop. Steve spares a glance at him as he shuffles into the kitchen and takes note of his disheveled hair, socked feet and one of
Releasing a sigh, Tony leans his head back against Steve, hoping that he can rest his eyes for a bit too. Just as he finally begins to relax, Tony is bumped into hard by the jerk behind him. He stumbles forward further into Steve and the sudden movement jars Peter awake too, and Tony sees red. He turns, ready to pounce at the guy who is oblivious to Tony’s rage and the fact that he’s invaded his personal space. Luckily for him, Steve somehow effortlessly spins Tony so that his short fuse will have to go through him first before inflicting any sort of real damage.
The moment is short-lived when Tony can feel Peter becoming dead weight in his already weary arms, which is not a good sign. This whole escapade has taken much longer than they anticipated and Peter is due for his nap. It’s a lose-lose situation. If they’re lucky, he’ll fall asleep while they continue to wait, but with all the commotion surrounding him, Tony isn’t holding his breath. Besides, a short nap could be just as disastrous as skipping one altogether. Either way, it looks like they might be in store for a cranky baby of their own.
What use is a genius without his intellect? What does an engineer do if he cannot create? Steve’s not sure how long they sat huddled together on the floor listening to Tony ask the questions he had no answers for between his labored breaths as he continued to cry. Promises were all Steve had to offer. He reminded his husband of their vows. There was no assurance that they would beat it, without a cure Steve knew they couldn't. He could only guarantee that Tony would never face it alone. Steve would stay by his side until the end of the line, no matter the obstacles that would arise. And while he didn’t voice it, Steve was frightened that for once their love wouldn’t conquer all, that he wouldn’t be enough to support Tony, that he couldn’t keep his promises.
do something. Not to be outdone by their eight-year-old son, Tony had gotten them reservations at Eleven Madison Park for that night. It wasn't a place Steve would have normally gone to - ever - but the restaurant was famously known for having a long waiting list, so if Tony wanted to eat there, Steve would suck it up. They both had to dress to the nines if they wanted to even step into the fine dining establishment, which had left Steve feeling even more uncomfortable, and his movements constricted in the suit he wore. Their table had been tucked away in a quiet corner of the bustling restaurant, and as Steve looked over the menu, he imagined his eyes bulged out like in the cartoons. When the waitress had come to collect their orders, Tony must have seen the panic on Steve's face and felt compelled to rescue him from his inevitable embarrassment, because as he was racing to find the cheapest item that would be considered filling for a super soldier, Tony chimed in and asked if they had cheeseburgers. The scoff that seemed to echo through the room was answer enough and Tony had grabbed Steve's hand and drug him out to their waiting car, politely asking Happy to step on it to the closest burger joint he could find.
As the ceremony ended, Steve and Tony had met in a bedroom before heading to the reception and exchanged their vows. Steve had known that Tony wasn’t willing to be vulnerable in front of a crowd and happily accepted the middle ground, which turned out to be more beautiful than he could have ever imagined. Tony had promised to love him with the same passion that he put into his projects, to spend the rest of his life enjoying the moments with Steve instead of losing them in the workshop and to love him fiercely until his dying breath. The love pouring from his husband - God, he would never stop saying that - was overwhelming. Steve’s vows were simple and to the point, promising what he knew he could provide and quelling any reservations Tony had ever expressed. He promised to always protect him from harm and stand with him against his troubles, to share in the celebration of his triumphs and love him all the more for his failures and to love him faithfully and unconditionally through difficult and easy times, for as long as they both shall live.
Steve pumps it in slowly at a steady rate, exercising meticulous care to prep and not hit his prostate. It feels wondrous and Tony arches back, of course, it figures Captain America would have a plan of attack.
Peter and Steve didn't move as Tony eyed their son suspiciously, the same boy he had tucked in last night. And who do you comfort first, when your husband is standing there pleading with his eyes for you to help him understand and your son's eyes are brimming with tears as he tries to pretend he isn’t hurt by his father forgetting the last fifteen years of his life? Steve spent an hour trying to convince Tony that the boy in front of him was his son to no avail, because Tony believed wholeheartedly that he would never forget his kid if he had one, which had resulted in Peter fleeing the room wailing. It had taken time to calm the boy down enough so that Steve could explain how it was the disease talking and not Tony, but the damage had already been dealt. Peter would never forget the moment his dad didn’t know who he was, and Steve didn’t know how to be strong enough for his son and husband moving forward.
Tony watches Steve’s lips part and eyes squeeze shut, admiring the sight, before Steve's grunting and spilling and painting Tony’s insides white. He’s grinding deeper into Tony trying to allow him every last drop, while his hand continues stroking and taking Tony over the top.
Tony takes a laughably small bite, before going back in for a decent-sized second helping at Steve’s urging and once he’s deemed it safe. Steve can see the moment his eyes light up as the flavors mix in his mouth. “Oh my god,” Tony lewdly moans as he throws his head back and finally relaxes and seats himself in Steve’s lap. “This is the best thing I have ever had in my entire life.”
“No!” Peter whines as he thrashes his little head back and forth quickly. He holds his arms up in a feeble attempt to be picked up and Tony is already taking a step forward before a hand on his wrist stills him.
, that’s a lot to unpack when they’re supposed to be relishing in the holiday spirit. Now Tony is just horrified at the prospect of his child inevitably growing up. Tony looks affronted at the thought, coiling back like that alone would burn him. “No, absolutely not,” Tony says as he shuts his eyes and shakes his head to knock that thought out of his mind for good. “He’s never leaving the nest. I won’t allow it.”
The more the super soldier did to chip away at Tony’s walls, the closer the two of them became. It took time. Tony had tried to push him away. Sometimes he used his words, spilling every insult he could imagine. Other times he used force, like a laser shot precariously close as a warning, or a shoulder check in passing. When Tony finally figured out that Steve wasn’t going to walk away, his whole demeanor changed and their relationship blossomed.
The morning had started like any other. Steve was up early making breakfast for his family when Tony sauntered into the kitchen and wrapped him in a hug, humming a quick good morning. It was such a small moment of tenderness but it was something Steve always found himself looking forward to, a reminder that the man he had married was still there. They had been exchanging lazy kisses, still locked in an embrace when Peter had shuffled into the kitchen rubbing sleep from his eyes. Steve felt Tony’s body stiffen against his. He went to tighten his grip on the smaller man when Tony had blurted out the question asking who the kid was, and Steve’s arms fell to his side in defeat.
allowed to date. We all know what dating leads to and my son will not be getting married and leaving me. Isn’t that right, baby boy?” Tony asks as he peppers Peter’s face with rapid kisses in quick succession.
Seeing Tony drop his guard around him left Steve even more infatuated with the man. There in the safety of the tower, Steve witnessed all forms of Tony, and each one was appealing. Happy Tony's laugh was contagious. It was loud, merry and so unlike the quiet, humorless laugh he fed the media. Steve never considered himself a comedian but he'd be lying if he said he didn't try to research jokes just to hear Tony let loose. Relaxed Tony was also a hidden treasure only few had the pleasure to see. Steve appreciated the sight of Tony in his tailor-made suits that cost thousands of dollars, but he also loved to see Tony in his loose, worn-out jeans and raggedy tank tops covered in grease stains when he was in his element. Sleepy Tony might have been his favorite though. Steve could never tell if the brunette had just woken up or finally emerged after nights of hard work. Tony would shuffle into a room with his clothes rumpled, his fluffy mop of hair a mess atop his head and his eyes half-lidded, and plop himself next to Steve as he searched out comfort in his tired state. It was an excuse to press his body against Tony's and embrace him, listening to the soft snores he emitted when he finally dozed off. With each day that passed, Steve's feelings became more complicated. What had started as friendly, had quickly veered into attraction, and Steve didn't know how much longer he could resist the magnetic pull he felt between them.
,” Tony chides, his pet name coming out more condescending than endearing. “Do you know how disgusting this floor is? That stickiness you keep stepping in is guaranteed to be some sort of bodily fluid.”
All the rage from moments ago is gone now that his focus is on comforting his son. Tony thanks his lucky stars that it doesn’t take long for Peter to relax, although it seems sleep has gone out the window as he moves restlessly in Tony’s grasp. As a parent, Tony has learned to take a win when he sees one though, and is overjoyed that Peter has at least stopped sniffling into his shoulder.
He stills inside allowing Tony time to adjust, and Tony moans loudly, lost in his lust. “Steve,” Tony pleads, “more, I need more,” as his ass pushes back, craving Steve like a whore.
looks delicious. “The best thing, huh?” Steve asks as he leans in and kisses Tony, tasting the sweetness on his lips, before doing it again, and again and again.
“Relax, mama bear.” His hands rest gently on Tony’s shoulders and he aims for a calming tone, but Tony’s wound far too tight right now to find it anything but irritating.
Peter is staring at them like they just abandoned him. His big, beautiful eyes are tinged with a sad, haunting look and his little lips are wobbling, and Tony knows that the waterworks will start soon. “It’s okay, baby. You’re okay,” Tony says gently from where he stands. “Papa and I are right here and we aren’t going anywhere.”
Steve’s brows furrow while he ponders, and Tony sees the exact moment a light bulb goes off in his head by the way the sly smirk spreads across his face and a healthy glow dusts his cheeks. “I do,” Steve proudly replies, before a look of worry crosses his face and his tone becomes hesitant. “But, you’re not going to like it.”
While he chooses not to voice that particular want, it doesn’t stop him from imagining it. Instead, he presses himself into Steve’s side and leans fully against him for support. His eyes close as Steve’s hand curls protectively around his hips and Tony can feel the faint kiss placed on his forehead.
It had become apparent very early on that trying to separate Tony and Peter was never a good idea. They were inseparable the minute Peter had entered the tower. Tony would spend all day cooing at the child who never left his arms and gladly woke up in the middle of the night at the barest hint of a cry. As Peter aged, their hands-on approach to parenting didn't change, but their lives did. It was like a flip had been switched and there were no longer all-nighters in the workshop, excessive working hours or a million meetings held by SHIELD. Steve and Tony remained Avengers, but they were reserved for world-ending wars instead of spending time dealing with an untrained villain that Natasha could take down in her sleep. Their lives had become about each other and nothing else, and Steve didn't think he could get any happier.
“We could just take him home and try another day at the tower like I insisted in the first place,” Tony scolds without thinking, too focused on his distressed son.
Santa didn’t have time to look bewildered before they were instructed to smile. “Look right at me you two,” the photographer yells while Steve stands next to him waving earnestly in the hopes of getting Peter to pay attention long enough.
“I don’t know,” Steve huffs with a shrug. “It’s just a lot has changed since you or I grew up. There’s more that kids have to deal with nowadays, and they can access
“No offense, but these weren’t exactly ingredients in the Stark household,” Tony replies with a shrug before his face twists up in a look of disgust like he just remembered something disgusting. “Caviar was Howard’s idea of dessert, not ingredients he could buy at a gas station. I don’t even think I had chocolate until I went to MIT and Rhodey gave me some.”
“Let’s just give it a sec,” Steve whispers. Tony can see that he wants to rush over too, but he’s trying to be strong so Tony nods.
A slicked up finger traces circles around his heat, then breaches Tony's entrance without missing a beat. How he managed to find lube Tony doesn’t have a clue, but saying he’d be concerned about the how would just be untrue.
Steve still remembers their first date. Courting had changed since his time in the ice but he still felt it was right to ask the closest form of family Tony had if he could go steady with the man. That turned out to be wrong, considering how loud Jim Rhodes chuckled over the phone before he hung up without even giving his approval. Still, Steve took the man's laughter as a green light. Days were spent with Steve tearing out his hair trying to devise the perfect date to no avail. Being a billionaire, Tony had already done everything he could have ever wanted, so Steve had to hope the effort he put into planning would be enough.
“Sweetheart,” Steve oh so softly says like he knows he has to tread lightly, “you can put Peter down if you want. You’ve been holding him this whole time. Aren’t your arms tired?”
Tony is two seconds away from decking the guy practically pressed against him that clearly doesn’t understand personal space. He is screeching into his phone like he isn’t in a crowded space, while his rugrats irk everyone’s nerves by running back and forth, bumping into the legs of everyone else in line or screaming at the top of their lungs. One of the little banshees knocks into Tony’s knee on his dash back through the line and Tony’s legs practically give out.
Steve’s lips against his own are delicate and sweet, and Tony finds he has trouble controlling his heartbeat. A tongue swipes across his lip asking to be let in, and Tony complies, granting him access with a tilt of his chin.
The deafening silence that followed them home was dreadful, a reminder of how out of his depth Steve truly was. It was nothing compared to what unfolded in the comfort of their home though. Tony had barely made it out of the elevator before he collapsed and released the most heartbreaking sob that had Steve’s gut-wrenching. All Steve could do was hold his husband while he broke. There were no words that would have calmed Tony’s panic, no pill he could have taken to absolve it and no action they could have taken to overturn the diagnosis.
“I know,” Steve sheepishly replies as he runs a hand down the back of his neck. “It’s just...Peter will be all grown up before we know it. And I thought — I just wanted a fond memory that I can look back on. Just one day where
“Way too late I’m afraid,” Tony remarks, nodding his head in mock sympathy. “That serum of yours has ruined the merchandise for anyone else. I'm afraid you’re stuck with damaged goods.”
The kiss is unhurried, Steve’s tongue takes its time; exploring his mouth, every swipe is sublime. It’s erotic and mind-blowing in a sensual way; Tony thinks he might be in love, he knows it’s cliche.
He had sat up to comfort Tony, afraid that he had said too much and scared him off. Tony didn’t run though, choosing to stay and straddle him on the couch, attacking his mouth in a bruising kiss instead. It had been all fire and passion – teeth clacking and nips at the other’s lips – that electrified Steve’s whole body. Their clothes had been strewn and thrown haphazardly around the room in their haste to caress every patch of skin they could get their hands on. The feeling of Tony's skin against his own had ignited a primal urge to have his way with Tony, and he had. It had felt like every one of Steve’s senses were dialed to eleven as Tony writhed on his lap, panting and pulsing with every thrust. It was rough and fast and so unlike anything they had done before, fueled by the fire raging within them. Seeing Tony ride out his ecstasy had sent Steve over the edge until they both sat there clinging to each other as they worked to catch their breaths.
“Who says my baby won’t always be sweet and innocent?” Tony asks, trying to lighten the mood. He’s finding it hard to hold onto any lingering anger when Steve’s good intentions were always planned with him and their son in mind.
It’s a nice touch that he offers the suggestion under the guise that he’s worried about Tony, but he’s sorely mistaken if he thinks Tony is any less annoyed about their predicament. Tony’s eyes drill holes into Steve’s at his proposal and the overly sweet tone he used to placate Tony just to drive home the fact that he’s still on his shit list.
Tony’s, unfortunately, reminded how numb his limbs have become when his arms begin to tremble from Peter flailing around in his arms. Steve and his scarily accurate, if not overprotective senses regarding Tony register his struggle and gently take Peter from him, settling him on his hip with one arm. It’s a welcomed break, but it also does funny things to Tony’s stomach when he feels like he’s unable to provide for Peter in the same way.
Steve didn't see Tony a lot, but every time he went down to the cove, there would be a pile of cans waiting for him. Steve didn't think he'd ever had so much money at one time.
"I don't remember subscribing to anything," Steve said. He was probably frowning. "You told me not to read the Terms and Policies things. Was that— Oh, it let me in."
"You kidding?" Bucky smirked. "Then we'll never get out of here. If Nat's glares could kill, the clock in the cockpit would be a burning hole."
"There's nothing wrong with being cute!" Jan huffed. "I totally get by on my cuteness. And I hate to break it to you, but you were totally cute even before your new accessories. Right, Steve?" Jan turned to him.
Gritting his teeth, he reluctantly nodded. He didn't want to admit that he wasn't getting the hang of it, but he he knew nursing a hurt pride wouldn't solve anything.
He looked over at the battered armor. If he didn't know better, he'd say the suit was unoccupied and thrown onto the couch like a discarded shirt you were too tired to take to the hamper. "You still in there?"
"No!" Steve yelped, and waded into the water a few feet until the cuffs of his rolled up pants started getting wet. He looked down, but the water was too murky for him to see anything. He groaned.
There were so many terms that he started making a list of anything he heard and didn't recognize. Then he asked for a little notebook and pencil to write things down, he might as well have been asking for a stone and chisel if the requisition officer's face was anything to go by.
Steve was starting to feel bad about it. As far as he was concerned, Tony had repaid him with the first net of cans. But when Steve told him he didn't have to keep doing it, Tony would wave his tail dismissively. Tony had no use for the cans, and he was using it was an excuse to clean the seabed of all the trash from the docks.
Bucky sat down, and Orzman did as well. Bucky didn't bother warning him it was the wobbliest chair, watching his pinched face as he tried to steady his seat.
It was the merman, lounging on the shore. He was giving Steve a smirk that hinted at sharpened teeth. His red tail lazily waved behind him. Even in the cloudy weather, it was shiny and magnificent looking.
Tony swiped through the pages, not paying much mind to her latest acquisitions, all older pieces. He wondered what Pepper made of his demands for these detailed reports. She probably figured she was humoring one of his many quirks. She didn't know what he was really looking for.
The next time Steve became aware, he knew he must be in a dream. He felt warm rock against his back, but he didn't feel like he was lying on it. He opened his eyes to a soft glowing green light, the beams of it waving through the room.
Sam knew why Tony had suddenly appeared before they left, and it wasn't because he wanted to run a last minute diagnostic on the team's new comms. No, this mission was going to be a long one, rooting out Hydra basecamps all over Europe. They'd be lucky if they got back in a month.
"Think they'll finally kiss goodbye?" Sam murmured. Steve probably had the ability to hear him even from this distance, but he was so focused on Tony, Sam doubted anything short of an emergency alarm would pull his attention away. And even then...
Steve looked up to find Tony had managed to take off his chest piece and a boot on his own. "Sorry, sorry." He put the ring on the coffee table and helped him with the next boot.
There was noise like the phone was being removed from his ear. "The Stark Industries logo is on the back, so I guess a StarkPhone."
In the middle of the cove was another large net. Thankfully it was filled with cans and metal, not a body.
Hogan didn't look happy, but he and the other two security guards led Bucky out of the building without any threats. He was sure Hogan would have loved to slam the door on him if it hadn't been revolving.
Steve gave a begrudging sigh, picturing a cupcake tattoo. He probably didn't have to do it. He had a feeling Tony wouldn't actually force the tattoo on him any more than he would have eaten all his desserts for free. But as Tony said, Steve had integrity. "Where do you want it?"
Coulson gave Steve a bland smile, a smile Steve came to realize over the last few months was more genuine than it looked. "I think maybe we should try something different," he said. He reached into his inner jacket pocket and put a cell phone down on the table between them.
Steve sat in his and Bucky's apartment. He stared down at his hands. He wasn't sure what he was going to do.
In the beginning, Pepper was glued to his side. Tony had been tight-lipped to her earlier interrogation attempts. Once they arrived, he just wondered around, schmoozing with a few people and taking a photo-op or two. Luckily, the art was actually worthy of being exhibited, and an hour of looping past the more abstract art piqued Pepper's curiosity enough for her to take a closer look. Tony waited until she was in a deep conversation with a stunning redhead about a painting of some violent slashes of color before slipping away.
Tony looked like he wanted to say something, but he seemed to think better of it. He smiled and just said, "me too."
He kept that hand in the sleeve as he opened the door,  and was hit with the smell of caffeine. In the kitchen, he found a pot of coffee already brewed.
Steve woke up to a world where there was more technology than anything Steve or those science fiction writers could imagine. But instead of making things simpler, everything was so much more complicated.
Steve scratched his jaw, still unused to his beard even though it had been growing for the last couple months. At least it wasn't as itchy as it had been. "I just want to shave this thing off."
Steve winced. He figured there would be few ways to explain his lack of common knowledge, but this story didn't sit well with him. It felt dishonest, but he couldn't very well tell the truth, could he?
When Steve asked if Erskine could feel emotions too, he said no, but that he could see people's auras, an energy field that spoke of the character of one's soul. It was that which told him Steve was not like other men, that he was special. This serum would take what was already in Steve and return it tenfold.
The warmth hurt at first, like prickly needles all over his limbs. His hands and toes felt like they were on fire. He tried to turn away from the warmth, but he felt like he was floating, unable to get leverage on anything. He tried to move his limbs but it felt like they were weighted down.
"Maybe." Bucky said, noncommittal because he probably wasn't gonna go, but he didn't like to say no to Steve.
"No!" Tony suddenly yelled and reached a hand out to Steve's face. He stroked it once before freezing, as if realizing what he'd just done.
Stark walked over to a wet bar behind the desk and picked up a heavy looking crystal decanter. "Drink?"
Stark rolled his eyes, and waved Hogan away. "Only in your dreams, Happy." He moved out from behind his bodyguard to regard Bucky. "I think I've got some time."
The man glanced down at Steve's arms inked in red, white and blue, and recognition dawned on his face. "You work at the tattoo place across the street."
He watched Steve and Tony as they spoke at the entrance to the hanger. It wasn't unusual to see Steve suited up in his uniform standing next to Tony in jeans and a weird shirt. It also wasn't unusual for one to find some reason to talk endlessly with the other. Even when a certain Capitan should be on a Quinjet heading over the Atlantic right now.
Steve startled and turned. His eyes were clear, bright blue, a color Tony had ached to see again. "I'm sorry?" He did a small double take, as if struck by a sudden deja vu.
"Find Connections..." Of course once his headphones were slowly blinking blue and his phone was showing an established connection, there wasn't anything to test them on.
He looked old. Older than the three years since he'd last seen him would account for. There was a tired slump to his shoulders that you never saw on the magazine covers or tabloids.
Bucky kicked Steve's shin under the table. "You keep glaring at your food like that and it'll spoil."
Bucky became acutely aware of the metal at his side. It didn't matter how hidden Bucky's arm was, its presence would always be there where Stark was concerned. "I'm not here to talk about that," he gritted out.
"Now, Mr. Rogers." He brought up his briefcase with a creak in his chair. He took a long moment to spin the number lock before opening it.
Tony winced. So maybe he wasn't that successful at hiding his annoyance. "My fault," he admitted. And now he was owning up to his mistakes. Who the hell was this guy. "So!" he started, forcing the cheer a little but he was gonna push forward. "Swipe down from the top. You should see a little gear at the top right," he repeated.
When Steve reached what he supposed would be the merman's knees, the tail lashed out, whipping sand into Steve's face, forcing him to fall back again.
Tony nodded. "We don't do it often. It needs to be the right conditions, the right time." Tony met Steve's eyes, and the intensity took his breath away. "The right person." Tony reached up, brushing Steve's wayward hair from his forehead. "It usually isn't done with permission. There usually isn't time. When a human is drowning and on the brink of death, a mermaid can give them their gift."
Steve nodded slowly. The hero worship made him uncomfortable enough, but many treated him like he was dumb. Like they didn't have smarts back in the forties. "And the phone calls?"
Before Steve could move away, Tony leaned into him. "It's real," he said, his breath ghosting over Steve's lips before brushing them gently with his own.
Everything was telling Bucky to slam the door on the snob's face, but he doubted this was something that could be ignored into going away.
Steve stared at him. This jet black hair that was usually plastered to his head floated around his face like a halo. The fins on his head and tail swayed in the water current. His tail shown and glowed in the plant light.
The space was warm and cozy with gold and red highlights accenting the fixtures. Rows and rows of colorful donuts, cakes, cookies and pastries lined the displays, almost overflowing with baked goods. Steve had never seen anything like it.
Bucky glared, but it wasn't like he was interested in small talk. "I want to know what the fuck you think you're doing." He pulled out the contract and tossed it onto the desk. The paper was slightly crumpled, from Bucky's hands gripping it on the journey over, but Stark didn't seem bothered as he sat behind the desk and smoothed it out.
His arms were solid and strong as they crushed Tony into an embrace. This second kiss was far from gentle, and Tony wanted to weep. If Steve has been drowning in the ocean, Tony had been dying of thirst in a desert. It was the sweet cool water of an oasis after years of wandering alone.
The arcade was dark, but the lights on all the machines were bright, blinking with the sounds of dings and music. Sometimes a distorted voice would say something you couldn't even understand.
Steve tried to stumble away but another one grabbed it too. "I could use a jacket like this. Too bad you're such a squirt.  Is this a woman's size?"
The merman huffed deeply as if trying to get more air. Steve had the horrible thought that he may not be able to breathe.
The sound of a car approaching spiked Bucky's adrenaline, and he scrambled around the nearest blackout car. He stayed crouched to stay hidden. As soon as the people left, he'd get out of here.
With more pep to their step, Sam and Bucky walked away, starting to debate if they should get food delivered.
"Nope, I'm paying." Tony reached down to grab the stool before putting his arm around Steve and steering him towards the game. "Come on! You're doing me a favor. Everyone else sucks in the place. You're nowhere near as good as me, but I think you can at least keep up."
Steve startled, and turned to find a boy smirking at him. He was a head taller with dark hair. He had on a denim jacket over a worn Queen band shirt, nice jeans and high top Chuck Taylors. Steve had seen him a lot around here, pockets full of coins to play as many games as he wanted. He'd seen him playing this game a whole lot.
"Tony," the merman said, staring at the offered hand, like he was expecting it to start doing something.
Steve didn't know a whole lot about how it worked, but when he promised to read up on it, Tony leaned up and give him a quick kiss to the cheek, making him blush even more than the cold wind.
"You should give me your hand," Steve told him. Tony frowned, but held his hand out. Steve clasped it, surprised by how warm his hand was. He moved their hands up and down a few times.
Steve relaxed a little. "Thank you. I suppose it is." He turned back to the painting, a sad longing overtaking his festures. "Very beautiful."
Steve ducked his head against the rain as he jogged across the street. It was a short trip, but he was soaked by the time he reached the door. He opened the door, darted inside and abruptly stopped.
"Unfortunate, yes," Orzman said, as if agreeing to something Bucky said. "However, this is very easily rectified." He took out a large, expensive-looking pen and offered it to Bucky. "We have rewritten the paperwork to also include a million dollar settlement for any inconvenience."
Jan walked up to the base of the statue. "Tony! It'll be okay. I'll modify a couple pairs of pants for your tail. Ooh, maybe I can even design some accessories to put on it. Like cuffs. Please come down?"
"I've got to go, but I really appreciate this," Steve said. "I've been having a really hard time with this."
"It's hard to grow things in the city," Steve explained. "If it gets canned, it keeps the food from going bad when it gets moved here."
He looked over his cover and saw Happy Hogan next to an open door. And then Tony fucking Stark stepped out. He didn't even think before jumping up.
Steve scrambled over and fell to his knees on the sand. His hand hovered over the seaweed before he carefully started moving it away. His stomach lurched again. The male face he uncovered was pale but handsome, with trimmed facial hair in a peculiar pattern. He uncovered a mess of damp dark hair and a thin neck.
Steve still remembers watching his husband deteriorate before his own eyes. Dr. Cho had told him that late stages of the disease would impair Tony's basic motor skills, but it was another thing entirely to see it happen in real time. It was devastating to watch Tony - who had been a superhero for crying out loud - become entirely dependent on those around him.
Steve fails miserably to stifle a chuckle at the terrible puns Tony has made without even knowing. He tries to use his hands to conceal the goofy grin he wears as Tony, his adorable little genius, fails to understand him.
After an impromptu make-out session following their emotional declarations of love, they had made their way to the reception where they were greeted by those they loved. A few tears were shed when Jim and Bucky gave their best man speeches, but for the most part the evening was spent with laughter filtering through the air, good food in their bellies and a charming ocean breeze. As they gathered on the dance floor for their first dance as a married couple, some sappy ballad played as they slow danced under the twinkling fluorescent lights. Tony's head laid against Steve's broad chest and his arms wrapped around his waist as they twirled around in a world of their own, oblivious to the onlookers and focused solely on each other. Steve knew he would never forget the feeling of Tony's warm body pressed against him and the chill of the air as they spent the rest of the evening floating on cloud nine.
The man shook his hand, his grip nice and strong. He didn't say anything, and Steve raised an eyebrow. The man glanced at his name tag before rolling his eyes. "Tony, as most people know." He released his grip and clapped his hands together. "Alright. I would suggest one of everything, but I don't suppose you want to spend that much on breakfast. No one likes their coworkers that much."
Bucky was determined now. He went into his bedroom and changed his pants into the stained jeans he'd worn yesterday. He grabbed the contract, throwing the card in the trash,  and was out the door.
He finally stood up when the heat began really getting to him. He took a moment to brush as much sand off his trousers and shirt as he could before putting away his knife and grabbing the net. Even with the large hole cut into it, it was worth at least a few dimes. When he turned to head back to the beach proper, a glint in the sand caught Steve's eye. He knelt, and carefully picked it up.
Nat smiled at Steve and nudged his hand away from his face. He hadn't even realized he'd been scratching it again. "The beard can wait too. Go to bed, Steve," she said before heading towards the stairs.
The next day, posters were plastered everywhere of Steve and Tony with their ears and tails. Tony would have been more bothered except in all the pictures, Steve was looking at Tony with the happiest puppy dog look he could imagine. So maybe Tony wouldn't banish Loki from his cheese fridge for too long.
Sam leaned against the side of the Quinjet. Emotions warred in his chest. He couldn't decide if the tightness he felt was from agitation or fond exasperation.
When they broke apart Steve cupped Tony's face with his hands. His eyes shown bright in the dark hallway. He looked at him with recognition, with disbelief, with all-encompassing love. "Tony."
Steve didn't like to run, but he didn't have a name in this fight and he scrambled to get away before the stunned group got over their shock. Unfortunately, they did far too quickly and grabbed at him. They got a couple good punches in, and when he fell back hard, his coin purse ripped open, scattering his money across the deck.
Steve had gone back the next day, and the next. He wouldn't do much more than peak around the rocks to see if there was anything there before retreating. He wasn't sure what he was hoping to find. He had the scale, which was grounding. Even if it wasn't a merman he saw, there had definitely been something there. And the net had been real. Even with the large hole Steve had cut into it, it still got him a lot of coins. For once, Steve was glad Bucky hadn't been there. He doubted he'd have been able to hide how shaken he had been, and he didn't need Bucky thinking he was crazy.
Tony snorted. "Are you kidding? My life was so much simpler before you guys showed up." Truth. "I'd like for my tower to be nice and quiet." Truth.
Tony turned to Steve. "It took Bucky here a whole week before he could figure out how to keep from swimming upside down."
It took a week for Steve to make his full transformation. He was worried about his legs turning into a tail until Tony explained they'd wrap them up so they could fuse together. Steve said it was like a cocoon, and Tony had him explain the whole life cycle of butterflies.
The summer seemed to skip autumn, and slid right into winter. This year, Steve was able to buy himself a nice thick coat and some tough boots with the money he got from Tony. Instead of just the junk he could find, Steve started to actually buy Tony somethings. They sometimes cost a little more than Tony gave him, but his eyes lighting up in delight at seeing the few pieces of silverware, the small magnifying glass and the padlock was worth it.
Their linked hands though, that was drawing attention. It was mostly smirks, plus a scowl from the Enchantress and a high-five from Sam for Steve who turned red as a tomato but that didn't stop him from clapping his hand.
Bucky sighed but didn't argue. He had known Steve long enough to know trying to stop him would be useless. He just clasped Steve's shoulder, shaking him a little. "Okay, Stevie."
It was a quick jog across campus. The sidewalks were full of other students and teachers wondering around, but none of them seemed to take much notice their new states.
"As I said," the man started with a forced smile. "I have some matters that I wish to discuss with you. If you would allow me into your... abode, I could explain."
Steve couldn't help but laugh, splashing Tony a little. "Please? I want to know what it's like living in the ocean. Do you guys have houses? Or cities?
They said he developed weapons, that he was smart. Bucky was sure he just paid off a bunch of people to let him sign his name between his martinis.
Steve frowned. "I was already given one of those." He couldn't get it to work any better than the computers. More often than not, he left it in his room.
The merman held up his webbed hands. "Okay, okay. You're a big man. I didn't come here to eat you or debate your size, alright?"
Steve paused. Tony assumed he was trying to figure out if that was an insult or not, but when Steve spoke, his voice was somber and sad. "I can't," he said. "I can't go back home."
Steve never took bets on tattoos. It was the worst idea in the world, but... Steve took in Tony's twinkling eyes and, well, he also wasn't one to back down a challenge. "Fine."
"No, not that. This!" he gestured to the two lovesick idiots. "I love Steve like a brother, man, but if I've got to spend over a month in the middle of nowhere listening to his pining sighs, I can't be responsible for what I do."
"Feet," Steve started to correct, but there were suddenly raised voices on the dock above them. In the time it took for Steve to look up, Tony had disappeared in the water again. "Wait!" Steve said but he was already gone.
With a stop at the dorm, they made it to SHIELD HQ in no time. The ride up in the elevator of was quick. Tony all but threw the blankets and pillows they'd collected on the roof before pouncing on Steve.
"So, you are going to hit the menu button at the top, three lines, and go to the Playlist tab. You'll hit the options button at the top right, three dots, and select New Playlist." Tony instructed, following the instructions on his own phone.
Stark led him to the door and opened it. Potts was still there, along with a glaring Hogan and two other security officers.
When he was selected, Erskine had been right. His powers were almost overwhelming at first, but he had to learn to adapt on his own when the assassin hit its mark.
Tony was now waving a hand around like he would with the holograms in his workshop. Steve laughed at whatever he was saying. When had they gotten so damn close? Now Steve was rubbing the back of his neck like he usually did when he was trying not to blush.
Steve could remember when he was younger. Half the time he was sick, bedridden and bored out of his mind. His mother would bring him new books from the library to read. Anything from history to poetry to adventure novels. Every once in a while, he'd get a science fiction book. They weren't his favorite genre, but he enjoyed reading them, imagining the amazing things that might happen in the future. Everything seemed so much easier. You hit a button and food was deposited fresh and hot. Cars that drove themselves and flew. Thousands of people living on the moon or in space stations.
Steve's heart was in his throat and he started to shiver. He knew he didn't imagine Tony, but at that moment it felt like he had to be. He felt so alone.
Tony grinned, delighted that Steve seemed to remember to look at the back. The fact it was a StarkPhone was gonna make all of this easier too. "Great. So you'll want to pull down the top menu by dragging your finger down from the top."
Steve's tail thumped louder on the roof, and he grinned, not minding at all. "Coming from a cat, I'd say that's quite the compliment."
When Steve made it through the first ten levels and back to America, the kid who had been watching the whole time was leaning in, looking more invested as Steve started the race levels. Steve wasn't used to anyone watching him play, and it was a little distracting. The kid was so full of energy, jolting at every one of Steve's near misses. It made him anxious, but also so ready to show this kid how good he was.
It was a cloudy wet day, one Steve probably shouldn't have been out in. Still, he trudged along the beach, picking up the cans and some scrap metal.
Tony froze, and Steve looked over in concern. "Is this okay?" he asked. He didn't want to make Tony uncomfortable.
Steve gave him a final peck before pulling back and moving around the couch again. He settled on the coffee table in front of Tony. "Let's get you out of that armor."
"Don't worry about it," Steve said. At least it sounded like he had a bit of a smile on his face, so Tony must have said something right. "I'm a, a mutant." The term stumbled off Steve's tongue like he wasn't used to it. Maybe he wasn't.
Steve watched bemused as Tony prodded his foot. He bit back a giggle when he traced a claw down the middle of his foot. When he poked at his toes, Steve wiggled them. Tony leaned back in surprise. He moved Steve's big toe around.
Steve had never heard anyone speak of his mutation. He didn't even really understand it at the time. He couldn't read minds or make people hallucinate.
"Thank you so much, Tony." Steve's voice was so grateful. But not the usual 'gratefulness' Tony is used to hearing, the fake kind just said in obligation. It was so damn sincere, it struck Tony quiet for a long moment.
Tony wiggled out of Steve's hold and climbed up the big lion statue to glare down at him from atop its head.
Tony went through almost every dessert on display, going indepth on the flavors and techniques he used. He spoke a mile a minute, but Steve soaked it up. It could have been minutes or hours since he walked in, but Steve didn't really care.
Tony tilted his head, pushing the pieces of plate around, putting it back together. "We don't build places, really. But we do live together in colonies. A few miles off shore, past where the seabed dips, there's all kinds of natural coral reefs and caves. We live there."
Steve hesitated. "Yeah. Isn't that how it works for mermaids? Don't you, I dunno, trade seashells for food or something?"
Bucky looked ahead, gripping his hands into fists. He wondered if Stark was calling for security. Sure it didn't make sense to invite Bucky up just to boot him out again,  but god only knew why Stark even agreed to speak with him. Bucky hadn't even thought about it at the time, not questioning when he was getting what he wanted.
Bucky knew if he walked into the lobby, he wouldn't get anywhere. Instead, he walked past to the next block and a nondescript garage door.
Steve knew he wasn't strong, though that never really stopped him from getting into fights, so he knew when his fist connected with the man's nose and he fell hard, it had been the element of surprise.
The two quarters had grown warm from being clenched in Steve's hand so long. They were the only quarters he had for the week, and he didn't want to waste them.
Steve couldn't help but lean his head into the touch. It was gentle but it sparked nerves that shot through his body, alighting it.
"JARVS!" Tony barked, startling her. He quickly swiped back to the exhibit details. "What's the date?"
Steve gasped, his chest expanding like he was taking the first full breath of air after being trapped underwater.
Steve sat up straighter. That made a lot of sense. "Right." He carefully picked up the phone, feeling clumsy with it. He didn't know how people knew how to handle this thing without touching the screen. He held the phone in one hand and used his finger to slowly move through the contacts.
"This thing looks pretty warm," he slurred, leaning in to look at it and sending noxious fumes of alcohol from his breath.
Pepper was too professional to roll her eyes at him, which he admired. He didn't have the same amount of patience she did.
Luckily, Steve didn't seem completely unfamiliar with computers, and Tony made quick work getting the guy online ("Trust me, Steve. They're not the same. Just use it to download Chrome."). He seemed a quick learner, and it didn't take long for him to catch on. Tony got him an email account and gave a few minor tips about surfing ("Don't turn safe search off. Ever.").
"When we, well," Tony hesitated, "When we weren't on speaking terms, let's say. I always tried to keep track of you, but you guys knew how to cover your tracks, leave no clear images. When we finally saw each other again, it was gone. I never actually saw a picture of you with the beard until afterwards... I don't know if it was fortunate or not that I didn't see it before. I probably wouldn't have left our rift go on for so long if I did."
Tony smirked and grabbed his hand. Steve resisted a moment, but soon allowed Tony to pull him out of the main gallery to an empty hallway. He pushed him against the wall, and by the tightening anger in Steve's face, this was the extent of his cooperation.
"It's called a foot," Steve supplied, because he wasn't sure what else he should say to the strange merman examining his soles.
He didn't like the sound of that, but Steve wasn't deterred. He just had to look past it. "You'd really love for the tower to be empty?"
He bent over, but before he could pick any of it up, Tony reappeared, sliding up the shore quite gracefully considering his one arm was tight against his chest. He moved his arm and suddenly tons of coins fell onto the sand next to Steve's pile.
Tony. He was close, hovering near with his webbed hand out like he didn't know if he should touch him or not.
Steve grinned to himself. He couldn't help but imagine the mermaid in a large bowl of water, lounging and pouting at anyone who walked by. "I'm Steve," he said, holding out a hand.
Tony had a feeling Steve was taking 'anything' more literally than Tony had really intended. Tony should probably clarify that it could only be computer matters, official consulting hours 8 to 5 every other Thursday. Because if he didn't, who even knows what Steve could be calling him about next. "Yeah. Anything."
But Tony wasn't looking at the portrait. He was staring at the man before it. His back was to him. His broad shoulders were made to look even broader in his suit jacket, and they blocked most of the painting. His golden hair glowed lightly in the gallery lights. It was shorter than Tony last remembered. He was...
The walk around the cubicles was uneventful, save for the fact that everyone was paying Bucky far more attention than the infamous man he was following. The curious eyes made his skin crawl, and he fought against ducking his head.
Tony took a moment to imagine someone forcibly bending a smartphone in half to put in their pocket. Terrifying. "Then it should have bluetooth."
Tony jumped down and slinked over to Steve. He smirked at Steve's red cheeks. "You think I'm cute, huh?"
"Go back to the home screen. There's probably an icon with a music note on it at the bottom. It's just called Music."
Stark dropped his hand. He turned and gave Hogan a smack in the chest, startling the man who had been glaring at Bucky for the perceived disrespect. "You will kindly escort my guest down to the lobby," he commanded before leaving in the other direction with Potts.
Coulson turned the phone towards Steve. He slowly made his way through unlocking it, and opening up the contacts. "You were complaining that people wouldn't give you a chance to do things yourself." Steve wondered if Coulson saw the irony in what he just did. "Over the phone, they can't just do it for you."
Jan clapped her hands together. The only ones who didn't know Tony and Steve had huge crushed on each other were themselves. "How about you two stick close? For... Just because. I'll work on some new designs for you. You can make the most of it."
Bucky had been to a few weapon demos, including the one when Steve met Stark. The guy talked big about protecting soldiers and efficiently ending the conflicts.
Steve leaned over and pressed his lips against Tony's. He gently scratched at the stubble growing on Tony's jaw.
Stark stared at him. Or Bucky assumed he did since he was wearing a huge pair of sunglasses.  "Barnes?"
Bucky huffed. "Yeah. Damn little stow away. He was pretty determined to help. Too stubborn for his own good. Reminded me of you." Bucky smirked, but when he looked down, taking in Steve's tail his grin fell off his face. "What happened to you?"
Steve hesitated, because now that the shock wore off a bit, he could clearly see that the net was bait. The merman said he didn't want to eat him, but there were plenty of stories of mermaids pulling sailors from their ships for some reason. "Why did you come?"
Tony heard the clacking of plastic as the guy looked around the outside of the computer. "No. Nothing. Do you think it fell off?"
The government deemed it a failure with Erskine gone and gone with him the possibility of more super soldiers. A senator came to him, offered him a job selling war bonds. Steve was acutely aware that the man wasn't giving him the whole truth, but he felt the joy and hope he gave people when he performed. He reveled in the happiness of an audience watching one of his movies.
Tony blinked, then put his head in his hands. He guessed he couldn't fault Steve for not knowing this stuff, but it was driving him a little crazy that he needed to explain everything. He reined his annoyance in. "No, Steve. You can put the call on speaker. Take the phone away and push an icon that looks like a speaker." He waited for the ambient noise to change. "You there?"
"Oh. Thank you," he said, relief confusingly clear in his voice. "I'm, uh, on my lap computer and I'm trying to get onto the Google, but I don't know where to find it?"
Steve took out his small knife and crawled closer, but the merman twisted. Steve shuffled back and put his hands up. He supposed he didn't look very non-threatening with the knife in his hand, but he couldn't leave him there. Even if Steve had been strong enough to pull the net to the water, he worried the merman couldn't get out.
Biting his lip to hide a smile, Steve looked down at the blueprints. "I don't like when you spend too much time alone down here in your workshop. I like when you're a part of the team." He looked up and met Tony's eyes. "I like you."
"Humans are strange," Tony repeated. "But smart." He turned and dove back into the water with barely a splash.
SHIELD was recruiting the Amish now? "Right. It's just. Unusual." Tony could smell the coffee brewing as soon as he entered the kitchen. He vowed to buy JARVIS as many ponies as he wanted.
The kid leaned against the side of the game to watch him. He looked bored. He probably thought Steve wasn't gonna last a damn minute but he'd show him!
Tony took a closer look at his own face, which, at the risk of sounding narcissistic, was very handsome. The love flowing out of his eyes would feel exposing if it wasn't what had kept him going for so many lifetimes. "You must feel truly loved by this man. To paint him so boldly, so carefully."
The heat of his first cup did a lot to thaw out his head. He was half way through his second cup when there was a terse knock at the door.
Tony moved along from one painting to the next, each more stunning than the last:  a smoky scene in a bar, a landscape of snowy pine trees and, finally, a portrait.
His eyes trail up. At first he didn't understand what he was seeing. Had a fish swallowed his lower half? But no. The scales gave way to skin, a torso, shoulders.... Steve blamed shock for not having seen the bright read scales on the forearms and webbing between the fingers.
Steve's shoulders relaxed a bit. That was an analogy that Steve could understand. During the war going against Hydra, the plans that he and the Commandos made before the attack rarely unfolded as they thought it would. They always improvised, brushed aside the small failures and found a way to win the battle.
Steve grinned. He knew he probably shouldn't be using his powers like this, especially when no one knew about them, but he was starting to get the hang of Tony's game. "You do. You love being on this team. You love how much you belong here."
Steve never inhaled a cupcake faster in his life, even as a young boy who rarely got the chance to indulge.
Steve looked outside the front windows at the pounding rain. He was debating whether he wanted to still do his morning run when he focused on the illuminated storefront of Marvelous Cupcakes across the street.
"Buck." It was Steve, just on the other side of the door. "You okay in there?" It must not be the first time he'd called.
"What the fuck are you talking about?" Bucky was starting to get pissed off. He'd always felt stupid around Stark.
"It's been five years!" Steve said, it coming out far louder than he'd meant it to. "I know we aren't in any hurry. It doesn't really matter if we're engaged or married or neither as long as we're together. But—"
Tony hummed happily and started picking through it. While he was intent on inspecting everything from a spring to a bent nail, Steve's eyes followed his tail. The large fin waved happily back and forth above the water. It was a beautiful sunny day, and even in the shade of the dock, the scales were bright red and shiny. He still had that scale he'd found in the net, but it was nothing compared to seeing it on Tony.
The voice was familiar and soothing, and he tried to do as it asked. He felt the water moving in and out of his lungs. Instinct told him he should be panicking, but the water didn't burn his throat or make his head dizzy. Instead, he became more and more aware of his surroundings.
"I," Oh no. There was the dejected puppy again. "I was, I was raised Amish. I never really learned any of this stuff."
Sam felt the vibration more than heard the footsteps as Bucky walked over and plopped down on the side of the ramp, his legs hanging off the side.
Tony smirked down at the collection of tarnished cabinet knobs and a broken plate. "It's big and blue and wet."
Stark gave him a withering look. "What do you think Steve demanded out of this divorce, Barnes? Nothing." He threw his hands up. "He refused anything. He only wanted what he came with because—" Stark stopped. His throat worked as if he was trying to keep something in or out. "Because of his fucking pride."
Tony jolted up and waved his hand at holograms that weren't there. "Test the joint for 600 psi at negative 20 degrees Celsius." When nothing materialized he blinked and looked around before finally seeing Steve.
With a new coin purse he'd bought a few weeks ago, Steve made his way from the beach and up the docks to go home.
He quirked a smile. "As long as I'm not paying millions for some cloth painted black and called deep, I'll take your word for it."
Tony hummed in delight. He could never suppress that thrum of excitement, even knowing he was probably facing disappointment once again. He took off his gloves and accepted the offered tablet. "Tell me you've got some good ones today."
Steve was nice and warm, and his bulky body shielded Tony from some of the cold wind that whipped around this high. It was hard to find any privacy, but at least up here any guests were limited to fliers, nosy spies and Squirrel Girl.
Now that the opportunity presented itself, Tony wasted no time heading towards the collection in the back corner that he'd avoided all night. He had waited so long. Too long. He couldn't stand another moment.
Steve nodded his head quickly. This was more than enough for him and Bucky for a whole month. He wouldn't have to go out on a ship again, maybe. But it wasn't really his to take...
"Whoa, hey, hey!" Tony grabbed Steve's hands, which he hadn't realized he'd been flailing. "Where's this coming from?"
It was with Erskine that he learned to block out his senses. He did not want to invade others privacy, but he knew that if he did appear in combat, he would not want to be so overwhelmed by the intense emotions of war.
He was practicing swimming around a large spire of rock and seaweed when a body slammed into his own. He squawked and tried to twist away but the two large arms around him wouldn't let go. He was about to start hitting him, when he heard a voice.
Tony cleared his throat and suddenly the tail was gone, hidden below the water once more. There was a blush on Tony's cheeks that rivaled the red of the fins on the side of his face. But he looked pleased, so Steve supposed that was a good thing.
He almost didn't bother looking in the cove again, but he dutifully climbed around the rocks and peaked over.
"Still having trouble with technology?" Coulson didn't like to beat around the bush, Steve would give him that.
It was a silicone ring. Or at least it was before it was broken. The golden shine didn't pass for real metal, but it was really the safest option for Tony if he wanted to wear an engagement ring.
But Tony wasn't about to let some bored real tech guy pop Steve's tablet cherry. "So you opened the box right? You've got your tablet?"
"We both signed the divorce papers, but I blocked it. It was never submitted, so it was never finalized." Before Bucky could say anything, Stark asked again, "Who was the lawyer?"
TS. Tech Support. Tony Stark. Tony facepalmed so hard it made a smacking noise. Tony couldn't even fathom the idea that SHIELD would give his number to anyone considering they didn't want their agents exposed to logic and sense and free will. Maybe Steve wasn't the only one messing his acronyms up.
Underneath where the tablet had been was a collection of pamphlets and cords in perfect slots. He flipped through the safety booklet and the manual before settling on the "Quick Start" guide.
Tony couldn't even begin to imagine why a NICE guy like Steve would be banned from an Amish community. Maybe he liked buttons. Steve seemed like a guy who liked buttons. Wait, did the Amish actually not like buttons or is that myth? Tony was halfway through typing out 'Amish button hate' on his tablet when he stopped.
The man shrugged, and poured himself a glass, not bothering with ice. "I'm still on Hong Kong time." He took a huge gulp, and studied Bucky. "When's the last time you had that arm checked?"
"Putting him through," JARVIS said, apparently deciding it was rude to leave him waiting any longer.
Tony's lips met his, his own facial hair brushing against Steve's. Stars burst behind Steve's eyelids. Then all Steve could do was melt.
"Yeah. Sorry," Steve said, his voice sounded further away, but the embarrassment in his voice was pretty clear.
Suddenly a cool hand grabbed his own. He jerked in surprise, ready to draw away until he felt webbing against his fingers and a gentle brush against his forehead.
"I think it would be best for you to start getting help from someone who doesn't know who you are. Captain America can be an intimidating guy to try and teach."
The kid looked at him like he was crazy before digging into his pocket and offering a whole handful of coins.
When Bucky left early that morning for the ship, Steve walked with him. After getting Bucky's assurances that he would be careful, they parted at the docks and Steve headed to the beach.
The Ameri-Can-Do Tattoo didn't open until eleven in the morning, but Steve was usually up before six. The little apartment above his parlor was small and didn't get a lot of hot water, but he and Bucky made the most of it.
The next section was recent gallery openings and exhibits that she had selected to sponser under Tony's name. He spent a little more time scanning through those. Examples of the featured art flitted past until he landed on one piece.
Captain America was his favorite character ever. He didn't have a lot of comics, but his friend Sam let him read all of his. Captain America was big and strong and wasn't afraid to stand up to bullies. He was pretty different from Iron Man.
"Computers are finicky, Steve. When in doubt, turn it off and on again. It's like the tech support mantra." Which was all perfectly true. It just didn't actually pertain to this instance. But Tony had learned a while ago, some people tended to object to him buying them things. Steve seemed like that kind of guy.
Tony rolled his eyes. Was SHIELD interning High Schoolers now? "Sure. I have nothing better to do than help you out."
Steve frowned down at his own bowl. He hated to be such a burden, but jobs were scarce, and Steve's long list of conditions made sure he never got any of the steady ones. He knew Bucky didn't like going out on the fishing ships, but it made more money than his job on the docks.
Steve was actually tempted, wanting to try it all himself, but he only replied, "Would that I could."
When his stop finally came, Bucky wasted no time getting out onto the street. It was still another two blocks, but he didn't need to look at street signs to know which way to go. This was unfortunately a route he was familiar with.
Steve rolled his eyes, but still blushed, suddenly conscious of the fact his white shirt was soaked to see-through. "What, uh, do you recommend?"
"By the time I got to you," Tony said slowly, "you had already been in the water too long. And it was too cold to just drag you up to shore. I didn't know when someone would find you, and you needed attention immediately."
When they'd returned to base and had their five-hour long debriefing, Steve was ready to climb in bed for the next 48 hours.
"It'll grow," Tony hesitantly explained. He placed his hand on top of Steve's, showing his own webbing. "You'll get more scales. More fins... Less legs."
"No, I, uh. The line has always been too long," Steve admitted, which sounded silly now that he knew what the place smelled like.
Steve sat up, his suit feeling stiff. His arms ached as he managed to pull off the top half, and then the bottom, leaving him in just his undersuit. He was quick to peel off the top of that as well, leaving it bunch around his waist.
Unmute. "Yeah, sorry. I'm still here." Did he just apologize? Tony vowed that Pepper never meet this guy, because if she could learn the Art of Puppy Whimpering Voice, Tony would have to show up to all his meetings and actually meet deadlines. He crawled out of bed. He needed caffeine; Tony sensed this could take a while. "Right, so. What was your name again?"
"Oh." He must not have known about the drop-down menu. "Oh! The settings." He sounded delighted. "I thought you had to find the icon with the other icons." Did he mean the apps menu?
Steve pinched the bridge of his nose, something he only did when he was overwhelmed with emotion and irritated at not keeping control. "Right. If you'll excuse me--" He turned away.
Bucky gave him another squeeze before letting him go. Steve took in Bucky's long black and silver tail that looked almost like a shark's than a fish. His hair was longer and flowing with the current. His left arm was covered in the same silvery black fleshy scales.
When his music lowered, Tony automatically turned to see Pepper open the door to his workshop, a tablet under her arm. He put down his soldering iron and took off his mask. "I thought I signed enough forms after yesterday's meeting to last me at least a year, Ms. Potts."
When the started fighting the exploding pyro people, the kid was leaning in so far, he was almost knocking Steve off his stool.
Tony hugged him back tightly, burrowing his face in Steve's neck. The fin on the side of his face tickled Steve's own.
Steve smiled, shaking his head. "Cans don't grow like that. We, other people, grow the food and then put it into the cans."
“I guess we could try again,” Tony sighs like it takes everything in him to concede defeat. He even pretends to not notice the glimmer in Steve’s eyes and how his entire demeanor changes with just a few simple words. “I mean, we’re already here. He won’t let me put him down now though, so any ideas? Because I’m too exhausted to even think straight.”
Steve mustn’t care because he’s giving it his all, and Tony’s reasonably certain his screams can be heard down the hall. He can feel Steve’s fingers digging into his thigh leaving marks, it’s like Steve’s claiming his territory and producing his own landmarks.
When Peter realizes neither of them is coming, the first tear falls and Tony curses himself as he runs across the stage with Steve hot on his heels. By the time Tony reaches him, Peter is openly sobbing. Nothing Tony says seems to calm him down so he takes to shushing and rocking him while he paces off to the side.
Steve smiles fondly at him, like he hung the moon and the stars or some sappy shit like that, cherishing Tony even when he’s being moody. It’s the same look that will make Tony feel bad later for being so bratty, but for now, his resolve holds strong.
He picks up the dish and brings it between their bodies so that Tony can have a better look. “No, this is a s’more,” he gently informs, gesturing with the plate. “It’s a graham cracker sandwich filled with marshmallow and melted chocolate. Usually, you make it over a campfire, so you can toast the marshmallow, but I used the microwave,” Steve adds sheepishly, his free hand moving to scratch the back of his head awkwardly. “It’s how my ma used to always make them.”
Steve can already imagine Tony’s body illuminated by the evening colors filtering in through the windows, softening all of his features into an angelic haze. Tony can read his thoughts too because Steve catches the sly smirk moments before he moves to straddle him and his hands instinctively reach for Tony’s hips.
It won’t be long now before it finally hits; Tony curses himself, he feels too close, too early he’s losing his wits. But he’s been dreaming about this for oh so long, that finishing so early just feels fundamentally wrong.
Tony had been driving to the high school when one of his episodes had occurred. Now, Steve’s husband was pulled over on a road somewhere in New York, lost and afraid. Steve remembers hearing horns blaring and the sounds of traffic whizzing by through the phone, but Tony was in no state to provide a location, and Steve wasn’t sure he could even if he had tried. The thought of Tony being all alone with no situational awareness brought Steve to tears. With a heavy heart, Steve excused himself and Peter from the science fair to find Tony, who they located using the cell phone's GPS. Peter stayed on the line with Tony as they drove and Steve could tell his husband was trying to desperately keep it together so their son wouldn’t be upset. The man cracked a few jokes but each one fell short as the gravity of the situation was heard in his tone.
Steve still remembers the day Tony forgot who he was. He had been exhausted trying to manage Tony’s day to day, raising Peter and handling paperwork SHIELD threw at him. Captain America had been given up long ago when he was too afraid to leave Tony alone, and his entire day became filling in blanks for his husband. The one thing Steve held on to was being a safe haven for Tony, even though he knew that would inevitably end too.
It’s silly, but Steve feels like a shield against the outside world. With a single kiss and a sweet embrace, he melts away the screaming kids, the elf that hollers at everyone in line and the asshole behind them who
“Only one way to find out,” Steve murmurs as he leans in and nibbles at Tony’s neck. As much of a hit as the snacks were, Steve is smug to see Tony hastily forget them in favor of the promise of some adult fun with his husband.
Steve pulls a face, raising his brows before swatting Tony on his behind. “Did you want me to dump you on the floor?”
“Good point, stay here. I’ll probably crash from a sugar high and need you as a pillow,” Tony admits like he has to give Steve a reason to stay when he has no intention of leaving.
“Jesus, fuck yes,” Tony rasps, “I’m so close,” and Steve just rocks his hips faster saying he knows. A hand reaches down enclosing Tony’s cock, while his ears fill with the sound of sweet talk.
JARVIS had informed Steve that the fastest route to Tony would be on foot as it appeared traffic wasn’t moving, so Steve parked and huffed the rest of the way with Peter in tow. The scene was worse than anything Steve could have imagined. Tony’s ostentatious car was at a complete stop in the middle of a busy street. There were cars at a standstill on all sides and an angry group of pedestrians screaming at his husband, who looked so small at that moment. One or two kind citizens were trying to help Tony and get him out of the street but it was like his feet were glued to the pavement. Steve didn’t waste any time rushing to the brunette and enveloping him in his arms, ignoring the vehement shouting surrounding them. All that mattered at that moment was that his husband and son -
Steve blushed, and looked back at the game. It congratulated him being the new 5th highest score. He wished it could be higher, but he was still proud of what he'd done. He nudged the joystick to put in the name he always used. C-A-P.
A smile spread across Steve's face. "He probably shouldn't sleep like that all night. It would be bad for his neck and back."
If Sam had to name one man who was never afraid to take action, it would be Captain America. If he had to name one man who was prepared to die without telling his crush he liked them, it was Steve Rogers. This was getting ridiculous.
Tony was particularly interested in the padlock. Asking all kinds of questions about how it worked. Apparently mermaids weren't interested in making things. They would craft some necessary tools for hunting and cooking, but most were uninterested in more.
Steve rolled his shoulders as he trudged down the Quinjet ramp. It was late, nearly four in the morning, but he had to fight the disappointment at not seeing Tony waiting for him.
Bucky didn't bother to look at who it was until he heard one of them speak. He didn't know what he said, but he fucking knew that voice.
It had lot of pictures and few words, but it all seemed to swim in his vision. He tossed the guide down, not having the patience to figure this out right now. He felt dumb and useless and lonely.
"While lie detection using voice analysis has proven to be unreliable, I would say that he sounds very sincere, sir."
The lawyers voice jump-started his brain, and Bucky sent him a dark glare. He stood, and Orzman jumped up himself in shock. "And he just thought he could fucking sic some lawyer and that would be fucking it? He doesn't even have the balls to show up himself?"
Steve looked over at the pile. It didn't look like Tony took anything, and Steve couldn't help but be disappointed. He guessed he didn't pick anything good out.
He saved Bucky. He saved a group of men who he would come to know as family. It was a group of men he trusted fully. The Howling Commandos were men who never lied to him. He came to rely on the honesty they gave him, and expected it.
He didn't have to wait long before someone swiped to get into the door next to it and he rushed over, grabbing it before it closed and slipping in. He followed the wall to the right until he reached an area with an unmarked elevator and a line of black cars with black out windows.
Bucky grit his teeth and sat down on the ground next to the doors. Stark was one of the richest men in the world. Bucky was an idiot for thinking he could just waltz right up to his office. The guy may not even be in the country. He should just go home and give the contract to Steve. Let him actually decide what to do with it.
Orzman huffed. "Mr. Rogers, I realize this may be a shock to you, however if you would just sign, you may go back to your," he glanced around trying to hide a grimace, "I'm sure, quite fulfilling life. You will receive the million dollars in the next 5 to 10 business days."
So he decided to do his own collecting. Tony was always fascinated by human things. Steve had no idea what Tony would want, but he filled his pockets with all kinds of junk he wouldn't be able to trade in for.
Orzman hesitated, but frowned and closed his briefcase. "Very well. If you would prefer stronger legal action, than so be it. But I promise you, that million dollar settlement will not be offered again."
Steve hadn't liked Iron Man for a while. He was just some rich jerk in a shiny suit. But one week when he had been really sick, Sam had brought over a whole bunch of comics for him to read. He started at Issue #1, and he couldn't put them down. Iron Man was smart and cool and funny. Iron Man had built his crazy powerful suit himself. In a cave!
A peek through the peephole showed a skinny man in a suit who looked like he was smelling something horrible. When Bucky cracked open the door without undoing the chain, the man sneered like he found the source of the smell.
Steve idly wonders if he’s just making a pit stop or done working for the night, but when Tony doesn’t acknowledge him, he assumes his husband will depart for another all-nighter and buries his head back into his book before indulging in the treat he prepared. Before he’s even finished reading the first page though, Tony plops down beside him with an audible sigh and Steve can already see the
Tony can feel the come in his ass and the glide of Steve’s hand before he hears Steve say, “Come for me, sweetheart,” but it’s more like a command. His whole body tenses, every muscle wound tight, then he’s wantonly mewling as his vision goes white.
When they are finally ushered to the stage to take the photo, Tony automatically moves off to the side to watch. After being in line for so long, he wants nothing to do with any of this anymore. But Steve? Steve is overly ecstatic, which is oddly endearing. He excitedly makes small talk with Santa before placing Peter on his lap and then begrudgingly making his way over to the sidelines to wait with Tony, as if he’d rather be in the picture and the midst of it all. Tony huffs at his antics because being with Steve is like having an overly excited puppy — cute, but reminiscent of another child. Tony follows his heartfelt gaze and it’s only a matter of seconds before Tony realizes this isn’t going to go as smoothly as Steve had hoped.
His coordination went next. Numerous meals turned into frustrated tantrums as Tony struggled to keep food on his utensils, and an even harder time bringing it to his mouth. Steve had to plan their meals accordingly, which meant sustenance like soup and coffee had been the first to go because Steve was terrified Tony would burn himself. Eventually, most items were crossed off the list of approved cuisine because his husband couldn't gather them on the plate or properly feed himself. Tony's blunders grew, rendering him useless to carry out even the most meager tasks. Steve had to assist him in brushing his teeth, managing his hair and shaving while his husband pouted like the toddler he had been reduced to. Even though they both knew what was happening, Tony never verbally acknowledged his body's decline besides his groans of protest, and Steve never voiced his concerns as the last few remnants of Tony perished.
He has to clear his throat and feign nonchalance when he notices Tony become rigid as he so usually does when he becomes nervous and feels like people are laughing at his expense. If Steve doesn’t nip this in the bud now, he knows Tony will shut down and he’ll be looking forward to a night of emotionally distant Tony, which could take weeks to correct.
Tony gets the sentiment, he really does. Steve had grown up in a different time and under very different circumstances. Even after all these years, he hates when Tony throws his money around when it’s unnecessary, not seeming to realize that Tony can afford to do so, let alone wants to do so for his family. Who else better to share his wealth with than the two who make him happiest?
Tony faces forward again, feeling the bed rustle more as the body behind him presses flush against his; fingers skirting to and fro, mapping his body like there might be a pop quiz. He’s unsure if he’s dead, maybe this is heaven; how else could he explain this moment with Steve, the object of his obsession.
“Steve, honey,” Tony cautiously says without prying his eyes from the end table, “what the fuck are you eating?”
The slip-ups only got worse though the more Steve focused on it. They were always small details, nothing serious, but Tony wasn’t known for being average, and these were things that Tony knew. He forgot the name of one of the Stark Industries board members when he was on the phone with Pepper, who seemed to take the slip-up as his usual snark and not a mistake, because Tony didn't make those. When he talked about his latest projects he would forget the correct verbiage until JARVIS helped him out, which usually ended up with Tony threatening to give him a virus. Tony couldn’t seem to remember which Mark version of the Iron Man suit he was on, which might have been the most alarming to Steve considering the suit was his greatest accomplishment and first love. The more occurrences Steve noticed, the more worried he became, until he and Tony made a doctor's appointment.
Steve stopped them in the middle of the mall, his signature million-dollar smile lighting up his face as he looked at Tony.
sweatshirts that dwarfs Tony’s small frame, hitting about mid-thigh. While he looks delectable, part of Steve wants to chastise him about his workshop outfit of choice and the importance of safety.
Steve complies and starts shallowly thrusting; the simple act has Tony close to combusting. “God, Tony,” Steve groans, “you’re so fucking tight,” as his dick continuously hits that spot just right.
Colonel Rhodes took Iron Man's spot on the Avengers, but they disbanded about a year ago, letting the younger generation of superheroes take over. The team all visited Tony after he was diagnosed, but they came less and less the more Tony's health declined, stating it was too difficult to see their friend in such a state. Now a days, Rhodes is the only one who consistently drops by. Sometimes he just sits in silence with Tony, smiling fondly at his best friend. Other times, Steve catches him regaling stories from their MIT days, and although he tries to hide it, Steve can hear the pain in his voice. Bruce stopped showing up when the sight of Tony almost brought the Hulk out. He had worked for years on a cure with world-renowned doctors and scientists, but none of their prototypes garnered positive results. As a desperate last attempt, Thor had even asked Loki for help, but that too hadn't worked. It seemed Alzheimer's had no natural enemy.
Tony jerked back and glared at him. "You're not a dumb dog! You're smart and you're loyal! They don't call dogs man's best friend because they're dumb."
Steve reached underneath the Iron Man helmet and unhooked it. He carefully pulled it off Tony's head, revealing his unimpressed face and an impressive head of hair. "Is that any way to treat your fiancé?"
...but the guy just sounded so dejected. Like a little puppy whimpering because it lost its favorite ball. Like everything in this guy's day had just gone so wrong until something finally seemed to be going right when Tony said he would help him, and Tony. Just. Couldn't.
"Uh." Was there more than one? Tony designed the tablet but he didn't actually make any decisions on the packaging. It was quick work to bring up the specs. "The thicker one. The real thin one is a set of headphones." Amazing high-quality headphones. Tony didn't do things by halves.
Steve smirked. "You're call. I'm going to bed." He stood up on sore legs and stepped over his discarded suit to stand behind the couch.
He couldn't believe it. He felt his hands, both of them, curl into fists so tight it was difficult to loosen them. That fucking rich prick. Bucky wondered if Stark even batted an eye when he found out about it. He was probably just annoyed.
The most startling thing was no one could tell him how to use anything. They would tell him to go to the "settings" but he didn't know how. Usually they would just do it for him with an indulgent smile. He knew they were trying to help, but he wasn't actually learning how to do anything.
He knew what others were feeling, but not by visual cues or listening to the tone of their voice. He felt it. He felt their fear when they read the newspaper. He felt their grief when learning of a death. He felt his mother's exhaustion when she came home from working as a nurse.
Owning a tattoo parlor certainly hadn't been in the plan, but he loved it. After doing some amateur tattooing on his army buddies, Bucky had pushed him to think about it seriously once they were discharged. His parlor was on an old street lined with different kinds of small businesses.
Stark strolled over to the elevator and pushed the call button, which lit up and immediately opened the doors.
Nat seemed to look through him for a moment. "All our gear will be here in the morning. Why don't we all head to bed?" Nat gave Steve a pointed look. "All of us."
Until the shock smoothed away to a more determined look. He finally moved, but not away. Closer. He stroked the beard again.
"I remember one time Nat found me staring at you in all your bearded glory. I couldn't look her in the eye without blushing for a week." Tony grinned and brought his other hand up so both could stroke through Steve's beard. "Don't shave it."
"So," Tony said as he created a new ticket and submitted a requisition for a StarkPad, "what's a guy like you doing with an organization like SHIELD anyway?"
Steve cleared his throat, bringing up a hand to cover Tony's. "Yeah?" Steve leaned down, clearly telegraphing his movements. But he stopped. He couldn't read this wrong.
Steve made a sound of surprised recognition. There was the faint sound of fumbling to get the headphones out. "They're missing the part to connect to the tablet."
Steve pressed two fingers to find a pulse. The skin was sickeningly cold and slick. With his other hand he moved more of the seaweed away and... There were bright red scales?
"Mr. Stark?" Pepper asked tentatively. He didn't blame her concern. He'd never reacted like this before. He'd never had reason to until now.
"Those people don't line up outside for my good looks! Not that I could blame them if they did," Tony smirked.
Steve managed to get all the way to the Mandarin before a huge blast from one of his rings zaps the last of his arc reactor energy. Steve groaned. He'd been so close!
Tony had always encouraged Pepper's expanding of his art collection since she first showed interest. She was drawn towards the abstract, anything that required some interpretation. He let her indulge in Rothko and Mondrian, and all those artists that throw some paint splatter on a canvas and call it a day.
Tony shrugged. "They're all over the seabed. I couldn't figure out what they were for, but I figured they weren't worth anything. I guess they are?"
He heard a hum down the line. He couldn't tell if Steve was agreeing with him or humoring him. He'd take it either way.
He didn't know what these men thought, but survival out in the wilderness hadn't changed much. He was probably better equipped, seeing as he wasn't used to the creature comforts expected in modern life.
Tony returned to looking through the pile. He picked up the dimes and pennies Steve hadn't realized he'd taken out as well. Tony scowled at them before tossing them over his shoulder and into the water.
When Natasha let him go, Loki vanished. "I'll keep tabs," she promised Tony and Steve. "He's going to have a rough couple days," she said before vanishing herself in a less mystical.
He'd hoped that the elevator would just open. He'd seen Stark, and Steve, just press the call button. But it didn't light up. Bucky only hit it a few times, paranoid that too many would make the security system suspicious.
Once Steve made it to the elevator, he leaned against the side as it descended to his floor. He hesitated before asking JARVIS, "Is Tony awake?"
"And if I am?" Bucky shot back. There was no way he was letting this guy anywhere near Stevie without knowing why.
Steve was still learning how to use his tail. It was frustrating to no end, and Tony wasn't helping when he kept calling him a small fry.
Steve got pretty good at weeding out the bullies. They were always lying, whether it was about their intentions or their beliefs. A man yelling flippantly at the news reel, disrespecting the soldiers fighting overseas and the others in the theater. He felt their frustration at the man's attitude. Steve hated the negative effect someone could have on so many people.
Tony sighed and wrapped himself around Steve again. He shimmied bit, trying to get as much of his scent on him as possible to Tony's embarrassment. But it didn't stop him from doing it.
Tony looked back at Steve. He smirked with a flash of sharp canines before grabbing Steve's hand and pulling him out of the archives.
It was a long mass of seaweed and netting. He couldn't pretend that that was all it was, not with the arm under the rope netting.
Steve blinked. He fought his knee-jerk reaction. He knew. He knew he wasn't wrong about this. "You love me."
They'd just finished redesigning the security for the tower when Steve said, "I like working with you, Tony." He opened his senses a bit, trying to pick up as much as he could.
The elevator doors opened to Tony's workshop. He gave the nearest camera a flat look but walked out.
"I've got to cut this short, Steve. I'm sorry," Tony apologized, and really meant it. "I'm going to include some instructions on how to add the songs to the playlist, and then how to play them."
Perhaps he was so used to working with the Commandos. There was never an evac for them. They would raid a Hydra base and then have to trudge back to camp. Steve had always taken the first watch. Sometimes he wouldn't sleep at all, not until they were back at base, where he would be out like a light.
Tony blinked, his emotions shocked into nothing before a warm sense of happiness felt like the sun on Steve's face. "I, uh, like working with you, too." Lie.
Tony poured coffee into his favorite mug. He spilled sugar over the counter as he messily scooped a few spoonfuls and stirred. The first taste was too hot but just right. "Well, there was no apple on the back, so it must be a PC. What does the screen look like?"
Steve gave a sheepish smile and he rubbed a hand over his beard. "I swear I packed my razor, but it wasn't in my pack when we got out there." He knew for a fact it had been there when he did his pre-mission check. He had no idea where it could have gone.
When Dr. Erskine first approached him, he did not talk about Steve's physical limitations. He spoke of the emotional effects of war. He spoke of the men who broke under the horror. Steve didn't understand why he was describing this, but Erskine was not trying to be deceitful or manipulative, so Steve listened.
How the hell did it... It was perfect. The cake was rich and moist, the filling had flavors bursting on his tongue and the sweet frosting on top complimented everything.
Stark smirked, something that actually looked genuine. "And you didn't say no," he concluded. He flipped through the pages again, the smile fading from his face. "Describe this lawyer to me."
"Oh. Well. They told me I could get a hold of Tech Support if I needed help." 'They.' Sounded ominous. "I'm not very good with all these acronyms nowadays, but I looked in the address book in the phone they gave me, and there was one labeled TS."
Steve moved over to the desk chair to get a better look. It was a very plain box with a simple Stark Industries logo etched over a precise sketch of the tablet. Steve used his fingernail to cut open the thin plastic wrapping, and carefully lifted the lid.
Stark raised an eyebrow. "It's none of your fucking business, but since you brought this to me, instead of Steve," he paused. "There was a prenup, but Steve didn't know that in the fine print, it only applied to patents and shares in Stark Industries and its holdings. In the event of our divorce, Steve would get half of everything else I owned. Which is a lot."
"Only people with bad taste say that," Tony dismissed, getting the laugh he was hoping for. "I'm going to email you a list of songs, and you're going to add them to this list," Tony explained, making himself a SHIELD tech support email. He started listing out all the hits, ACDC, Black Sabbath, Queen, Guns N Roses, and hell, some Beatles and Rolling Stones. You had to start the guy right. "When you—"
Steve paused, knowing what that meant, and what Bucky wanted. Or didn't want. "I'm heading out to work. I've told Sam I'd help him at the VA after if you wanted to come." Subtle, Steve.
"How do you not know any of this?" Tony demanded much sharper than he intended. Actually he didn't mean to say it at all, but it just slipped out.
Steve blinked at him. He didn't think anyone really noticed. He blushed at the awed expression the kid was giving him, and climbed down off the stool.
"You okay?" Tony asked. "You're not bleeding internally or anything, right? You got that pinched look."
"Neat," Tony said, because even he knew it was rude to just interrogate some guy over the phone about his mutations. He did a quick skim of Windows 8 guides, and was relieved to see you could still get back on the original format. He could definitely work with that. He hoped the guy had an Internet connection. "So, I want you to look for a tile that says desktop. It's probably a picture of a hill..."
His stomach swooped, and it took everything in him not to vomit. He was no stranger to death, it was hard to be in these times, but never like this.
Steve jerked the joystick to the left, and had a moment of panic that the kid just said that to make him crash, but he narrowly missed a huge whip that came from the right, taking out three cars.
Bucky stood frozen. He couldn't even tell if he was trying to take it or not. All he knew was that the arm stayed unmoved at his side.
It was a dark landscape, a fantastical skyline of skyscrapers silhouetted by a burst of a starry sky. One skyscraper in particular rose above the rest, seeming to reach for a large, bright blue-tinted star.
"Yep," Tony confirmed. Steve wasn't a dummy. He was quick to follow Tony's instructions, and they seemed to stick in one form or another.
Steve couldn't stand it. He had to do something about it. So he signed up for the army. Again and again and again.
The body jerked and Steve was elbowed in the stomach. He fell back as the body thrashed and twisted in the sand. Steve watched, wide-eyed as all of the seaweed was thrown off.
"He really wanted me — Steve — to sign it." Bucky leaned back in his chair. "He offered a million dollars to make this go away. He must have been desperate."
Stark stood. He walked around the desk and offered the contract back. "I'm going to look into this. But you can show Steve. And if this is what he wants..." Stark stopped. "Show him. If he wants nothing, if he wants the million, if he wants everything, he'll get it."
Orzman produced a bundle of papers with a flourish. He pushed it across the table towards Bucky, who only glanced at it. "It has come to our attention that an unfortunate error has been made. The divorce was never finalized, and you are, officially, still married to Mr. Stark."
Tony feels his arousal pool in his gut, and braces himself for the inevitable with his eyes clenched shut. But then, Steve abruptly removes his fingers, and Tony's left with only a fleeting feeling that lingers.
Tony huffs in frustration at what Steve recognizes as him considering this to be a dumb question like Steve is playing a game with him. “How could I want
The whole day had so far been a chaotic mess, but that night had been the best anniversary Steve could remember. They had pulled up to some run-down diner and ordered enough burgers for an army before getting back into the town car and having Happy just aimlessly drive around. In the backseat of that car with the tinted windows, Steve and Tony stuffed their faces with greasy goodness they usually didn't allow themselves to indulge in, recounted stories from their first few years of marriage that had them laughing so hard their eyes watered and they rolled around in the backseat like a couple of horny teenagers. As they finally made their way back towards the tower and Tony was slumped against Steve's side, the brunette's head resting on his shoulder, Steve knew that this was an anniversary he would never forget in a million years.
“What? No.” Steve shakes his head. He’s flabbergasted by the genuine confusion from his husband. ”Tony, have you never had a s’more?”
hasn’t finished his phone call. For the first time that day, Tony feels like he can truly relax, and he does until he feels soft murmuring in his hair and he blinks himself awake to find that they are next in line. How that happened, Tony doesn’t even question. After all these years, Steve’s abilities never cease to amaze him.
The world has become a darker place without Tony contributing to it. There are no new inventions changing people's lives, no suit of armor protecting the world and there's no longer a doting husband and father spreading cheer throughout their days. His family is trying to step up and attempt to fill the void that Tony is leaving behind, but it's not the same.
The sound of skin slapping can be heard through the room, and Tony can feel the beginning of his orgasm start to bloom. He’s cussing and moaning, drowning in pleasure galore; the telltale warming is starting, beginning in his core.
Steve could have sworn he sat there for years stiff as a board and silent, but it had only been seconds before he felt his earbuds being removed. When he turned to find the intruder, he found Tony instead, beaming at him with that smile he had missed so much. Steve had been up and over the couch to scoop Tony into his arms in an instant - plastering kisses across his face as he rambled off a form of missed you's in between - before Tony had zapped him back to the present by softly chiding him about not saying it back. It had taken Steve far longer than he was proud of to realize what Tony was even talking about before his brain registered the I love you that Tony had dropped only minutes before. Steve wasted no time returning the phrase, mumbling it hundreds of times into the crook of Tony's neck where his face was buried. It was like Tony had opened the flood gates and Steve couldn't stop saying it now that he was able to do so freely. He had waited so long to tell Tony that he knew at that moment that he wouldn't go one day without telling Tony how much he loved him from there on out.
Tony was finally nestled all cozy and warm in his bed, while visions of Steve dance in his head. He’s curled up on his side and hugging a pillow, pretending it’s much more, perhaps a certain fellow.
Tony tilts his head, getting a good look at the item, but makes no effort to take it. “It looks disgusting.”
Steve is so damn lucky that Peter is adorable because Tony had every intention of scowling his way through this photo so he could consistently remind him how miserable he was. But hearing Peter’s version of cheese has his mask falling and a goofy, toothy grin appearing.
Tony melts into the touch, his body relaxing little by little, as Steve pushes all the right buttons, playing his body like a fiddle. A surprising smack to his ass startles Tony from his bliss; Tony turns his head in shock and Steve quells him with a kiss.
While the lacerations and bruises from the war had healed, Tony hadn’t come out unscathed. The wormhole had instilled fear in the genius that left him with horrific nightmares, that inevitably led to destructive tendencies. Tony, the self sacrificial idiot, clearly needed support. Needed someone who could shoulder some of the burden he felt and lighten his load. Steve didn't hesitate to fill that role for the man who somehow captivated his thoughts.
When Steve finally slips a second finger inside, Tony responds kindly, arching his backside. Steve takes his time scissoring his fingers apart like he's trying to know every inch of Tony by heart.
Tony’s arms wrap around his neck as he leans against Steve’s chest and presses their bodies flush against one another. Steve’s hands glide up Tony's thighs, creeping ever so slowly past where the oversized sweatshirt falls. He nips at Tony’s ear before whispering, "I'd like to see s'more of this view," as his hands reach around and cup Tony’s ass.
date. As they reached the penthouse floor where he was dropping Tony off, and they shared a soft sensual kiss complete with exploring tongues that seemed to last for hours, Steve knew he wanted to give Tony so many more firsts.
He whines and squirms, wanting to be taken apart, and Steve leans over and whispers, "I've got you, sweetheart." Strong arms surround him in an embrace hauling him nice and close, making a shiver run down Tony's spine, from his head down all the way to his toes.
“Relax, I’m going to take care of you,” Steve whispers in his ear; Tony’s reward is finally coming, he barely stifles a cheer. It’s thick and long as Steve pushes his cock in filling Tony to the brim, until he’s fully engulfed and stretching Tony’s rim.
Admittedly, he had thought that it would come in the form of a repulsor blast. What he wouldn’t give for that to have been true.
Steve rolls his eyes fondly as if he hoped Tony would be in a better mood but somehow knew that he was holding onto his annoyance like a vice to lay into him later when they weren’t in public. “He’s a kid. They're supposed to get a little messy now and then.”
Steve still remembers their wedding. They didn’t want the paparazzi, media or some villain to ruin their special day so the details had been kept under wraps. It was a small affair, only about fifty of their closest friends, at a private mansion in California that they rented out for the event. Their handmade fitted suits were a deep black, adorned with a red tie with gold accents, representing both of their colors. And as Colonel Rhodes walked Tony down the aisle, Steve was pretty sure his perfect heart skipped a beat.
Tony had been in Japan for over two weeks working with Pepper to broker a deal for Stark-Fujikawa and Steve was losing his mind without him around. He hadn't realized how utterly enamored he was by Tony until he was forced to go without him and realized he didn't like his life without his little genius around. They talked on the phone whenever they could, but it seemed like luck wasn't on their side, as each time they connected Pepper came to reel Tony back into negotiations, Fury urgently needed to speak to Steve about a possible HYDRA mission or the time difference simply meant the other was asleep. Steve knew he was being dramatic, but it had felt like they were living two separate lives.
It had been a hasty but affectionate peck that was over far too sudden, but it had been enough. Steve had been floored by the emotion he had felt from that brief moment and was at a loss of words. He was lost in a trance staring at Tony while his mind reeled in a haze of his racing thoughts, which is why he never saw Tony’s next move coming. Before Steve had a chance to react, Tony had fled the room without a word and locked himself in his workshop, revoking all the access codes Steve knew.
He was lost in his thoughts about the boy in his arms when the flash erupted before his eyes. Before he could clear his vision, Steve had practically scooped them both up and rushed them off stage. Steve happily spun Peter in the air, praising him. “You did so great, bubba! You’re such a big boy now!”
“Ugh,” Tony groans even though he feels the butterflies in his stomach, the same feeling that only Steve could ever provoke. “You’re a big ol’ sap, you know that? You’re just a big adorable lug.”
Before the moment even begins though, it’s over. Tony’s face changes to a look of bewilderment as his eyes lock onto something on the table to Steve’s left and his hips hover above Steve’s as if he’s frozen in time. He tries to gently nudge his husband to lower into his lap, unsure of what exactly has him in a trance.
When the night had come, Steve whisked Tony off on his motorcycle. The feeling of Tony pressed against him, clutching tightly to his shirt, still vividly ingrained in his mind. They raced over the Brooklyn Bridge - just enjoying the feeling of the wind whipping through their clothes - until Steve parked his bike at a small, family-owned pizza shop. Taking their food with them, they had walked hand in hand to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade where they sat and ate, watching the twinkling lights of the sprawling New York City landscape. It was probably the cheapest date Tony had ever been on, but it was all Steve had wanted, him and Tony laughing and snuggling for warmth under the starry sky.
There was no one to call that would be able to calm Tony down, except maybe Rhodey, but he had been with the Avengers on a mission. It was possible that he would have remembered one of the others, but trying to play guess who with a frightened man at that ungodly hour had seemed like a terrible idea. JARVIS had spoken before Steve even reacted and to his surprise, Tony was relieved to hear his old friend. Tony had been looking for his human butler JARVIS, but by the time the A.I. explained how he had come to be, Tony had calmed down enough to trust JARVIS to bridge the gaps in his memory for him. While Tony's panic had subsided enough to be in the same room with Steve, he didn’t leave any chance to get near him. That night, Steve slept in a spare bedroom at Tony’s request and cried himself to sleep, wondering how many more of those nights he’d have to face.
Peter and Steve had been at the high school where Peter was entering his project into the science fair. His project was a study of the use of multi-frequency acoustics to improve production in oil and gas wells, something Tony and him had spent weeks working on. Steve had been listening to Peter’s breakdown of their research when his phone rang and Tony’s picture popped up on the screen. He had answered, expecting to find out if Tony had arrived, only to be met with a frantic ramble from his husband. Tony was lost.
“I can’t believe you’ve never had a s’more before,” Steve absentmindedly says as his hands settle on Tony’s thighs.
"Oh my god," Tony loudly groans as his head falls forward onto Steve's shoulder and buries into the crook of his neck. "That was cheesy, even for you, sugar plum."
He keeps his attention on the book in his hands while sneaking glances at Tony through his peripherals, trying to gauge his intentions. He can tell Tony is facing him and his exaggerated groans and sighs assure Steve that whatever he was working on is on pause and Tony has no idea how to entertain himself in the meantime, which means it’s up to Steve. Accepting his fate, he closes the book to wrap his arm around Tony, pulling him snug against his body. “Hey, darlin’. You finished for the day already?”
The tail suddenly turned, giving Steve a gentle pat on the side of his head. He couldn't help laughing as he reached a little further and petted the shiny scales.
He unlatched the right gauntlet and carefully slid it off. Tony's knuckles were raw and bruised. He placed a soft kiss on the roughest one.
Steve made quick work getting the left gauntlet off as well, but when he moved over to the table, something fell out onto the floor. For a horrible moment, he thought it was a piece of finger, but when he picked it up, he could help but give a sad little laugh.
Tony reared back and looked at him like he was crazy. He opened his mouth a few times, but seemed unable to speak. Instead, he gave Steve and exasperated look, grabbed Steve on either side of his face and kissed him.
Steve shook his head. "No, he needs all the sleep he can get." he felt oddly relieved, knowing that the reason Tony hadn't greeted him had not been because of apathy.
Tony stopped to look at him. The large fin on the back poked out of the water, and Steve took it as an invitation. When the tail came closer, Steve reached out to touch it, but hesitated, glancing at Tony for permission. All he received was a grin, so he petted the large fin. Steve had been afraid it would be cold and slimy, like most fish. Instead, it was smooth, almost silky. The little spines made long ridges along the webbing.
For once in Tony's life, he had no idea. He had never used Windows 8, and he sure as fuck never wanted to learn. "You might need to call someone else."
Tony finally motioned to a smaller cooler case sitting on the counter next to the register. "But all of that is nothing! Nothing compared to my speciality!" He gave a flourish before opening the back and taking out one of the cupcakes on display. It was in a shiny gold wrapper topped with bright red icing and a scattering of gold leaf. He presented it to Steve. "This is the Marvelous Iron Cupcake. My own version of red velvet with a frangipane filling and a honey cream cheese frosting."
Bucky gaped at him. "What the fuck. Is that why you stopped the divorce? Were you trying to find a way around it?"
The merman watched him, his head propped up on his hand. "Most humans probably wouldn't have helped me," the merman reminded him. "I've heard about your circus shows and big fish bowls."
Tony had to agree new ears and a tail wasn't even close to the weirdest thing that ever happened at the Academy. Hell, Cap was a full-blown werewolf at one point.
Tony blinked and the noise he hadn't even noticed stopped. He burried his face in Steve's neck to hide his blush. "Why did you get to be a tough dog and I'm a sissy cat?" He moved his tail out of Steve's reach to tuck it against his side out of the way.
That was over seventy years ago, but for him it was only a few. Finding himself surrounded by men who didn't trust him to know which end the bullet came out of a rifle was infuriating.
He usually played The First Avenger for a quarter a play. He was great at that game. Even with only a few quarters every time, he had the highest score. But...
Sure, Stark was rich, and Bucky could begrudgingly say also charismatic and good-looking, but Steve was no dummy. That wasn't anything that would fool him. Stark could charm his way into people's bank accounts and their beds, but that's all it was. There wasn't any depth to that.
The elevator didn't open to a horde of armed security guards. It was a harried-looking young man waiting for the elevator, and trying to flip through a binder while holding onto a huge paper coffee cup.
It only became worse when after ten days in the middle of a forest, in the rain and mud, they'd stumbled onto a hidden Hydra base. They had been as surprised as the Hydra goons. When Steve took charge, the others didn't want to follow. It was only when Natasha had snapped at them that they fell into line.
Tony offered him the cupcake, and Steve took it. He felt Tony's unwavering eyes on him as he pulled back the wrapper to reveal deep red cake underneath.
"You don't like working with me," Steve began, and the tiny jolt of Tony's panic emblazoned him on. "You love working with me."
Steve sighed. "I got you this ring so we wouldn't have to worry about it hurting you. But it keeps breaking or getting lost. It's like the universe is telling us something."
That was how Steve became a part of the army trials for the next super soldier. All of the men had some mutation, even if it was only a heightened sense of smell.
A dull numbness overcame him. His vision was blacking out. He only had a single thought for Tony when his mind slipped under, making him imagine he felt lips against his own.
Stark rolled his eyes. "Stand down. Mr. Barnes is leaving quietly." He gave Hogan a meaningful look before turning to Bucky and holding out his hand.
Peggy would be proud to see a female agent who could command obedience like her, but it was bittersweet for Steve.
The men on his squad didn't know how to react to him. He held their respect but not their confidence. He was Captain America, and the uniform was a symbol. Before the exercise, one of the men had come up to shake his hand, and thank him for his service. But Steve Rogers was from another time, a 'less enlightened' time.
He shut the door to undo the chain, then opened it again to let the man in. The man stood awkwardly next to the closed door before following Bucky into the kitchen. Bucky didn't get any threatening vibes off the guy, but he still liked the idea of a gun being nearby.
"Tell me about the ocean," Steve said, taking a bit of bread with the cheese. Real cheese! He couldn't remember the last time he'd had real cheese. He wouldn't have normally splurged on it, but Tony had been interested to try it. To say he was unimpressed was an understatement.
"Mr. Steve Raber. He is the young man from SHIELD whom you helped reach 'The Google' two weeks ago, sir."
"Okay, what kind of phone do you have?" Tony asked, wondering if he should just help Steve through the settings from the get go.
By the time Steve wiped the sand out of his eyes, he saw only the flash of the red tail and the merman drove back into the ocean.
Tony sighed and looked at his hand. There was a shallow cut on his ring finger, probably from one of the finger plates being bent in during the fight. "That's what, the tenth?"
It had been three long months away from home. Months without sparing, without movie nights, without impromptu meals when Steve would bring food down to the workshop so Tony wouldn't forget to eat. There had obviously been times before when they'd been apart for longer, but not since they reconciled. The friendship that had been torn apart was now mended stronger than ever. Strong enough that Steve wished for more, but he didn't want to risk what they had now. Not when Tony was probably only being friendly back.
The person cleared their throat. "Uhm. Hello, sir," a man said, unsure and way too loud. "I was wondering if you could help me?"
The group laughed and Steve tried to jerk his arm away, angry. "Get off me." When the man just tightened his grip, Steve wound his arm back and swung.
Steve was frozen too. Even after the initial shock, he didn't move an inch, as if doing so would spook Tony away from him.
Steve jumped, breaking out of his daze to look up at the man he hadn't noticed come in. He was handsome with twinkling eyes and dark trimmed facial hair surrounding a smirk. He wore a black shirt with the store logo, partially hidden by smears of flour. His name tag just said "You know who I am."
When Stark led them past, the man didn't even even notice his boss as he gave Bucky a double take. Bucky shifted his shoulders, making sure the metal hand was still in his pocket. He was suddenly aware if what exactly he was wearing.
Steve bit his lip but continued to stroke the scales on his tail. "It's beautiful. I've never seen anything like it."
Right when Steve resolved to go down to the gym to release some frustration on a punching bag, his eyes landed on the clean silver and black box on his desk. It had arrived the morning they'd set out, so he hadn't more than glanced at it, much less opened it.
As they bickered back and forth, Steve couldn't help but laugh. He didn't have his 'sea legs' yet, but he'd be swimming soon.
The sun was just starting to color the sky orange, but it was already warm. It was going to be a stifling day just like it'd been all month, which was why Steve was up early trudging through the sand, collecting garbage and anything valuable off the shore to exchange for some coins. He never found much, but every bit helped.
Tony was ready to hang up on the guy, because really? You didn't ask Mozart to write a jingle for your cat food commercial. Or to teach your 3rd grade class the recorder. Or to tune your piano. Ooh. That sounded sexual. He was getting off topic. Anyway. Really. He was ready to hang up. His finger was hovering over End Call...
He shivered, only now becoming aware of the goosebumps covering his skin. The arm was a dead weight. A hard chunk of metal fused to his shoulder.
The office Stark gestured him into was large, ornate, but looked unused. Bucky wasn't sure if this was Stark's actual office or just someone else's he was appropriating. He probably owned the whole building, he could do whatever he wanted.
The Invincible Iron Man music started and a thrill shot up Steve's spine. The game started right at the beginning in the cave where Tony Stark was kidnapped. His first job was to get through the Ten Rings to freedom.
Steve mashed the buttons, one for punching and one for his repulsors. It took a while to get used to not needing a jump button. Iron Man could fly after all.
"Yeah," he said back, his voice like gravel. Clearing his dried out throat hurt. "Yeah. Just a slow morning."
