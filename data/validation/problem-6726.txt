“Who? Who was looking for you?” Natasha’s fingers stilled in Peter’s hair. Her hackles immediately raised at the mention of someone or something trying to hunt Peter down.
Natasha slid her laptop over to Bucky, who was seated across from her. “Look through these,” she gestured to the footage on the screen, “I’m gonna head down to the lobby to speak with Happy.” She stood up and grabbed Steve’s arm in one fluid motion and directed him into the hallway.
“It is not okay.” Tony turned, so he was facing Peter fully, his hold tightening on the teen’s hand. “I yelled at you and sa-said awful things. I was so mean to you.” His voice shook on every other word, laden with the crushing weight of guilt. The self-deprecation overt. “And because of my own arrogance, you got hurt. They took you and- they… you nearly died, Pete! And it was all my fault.”
“Hey, guys. I got the good stuff.” Ned said proudly, dumping a large handful of single-sized chip bags, packs of randomly assorted candy, and a six-pack of Pepsi onto the floor. He looked back and forth between his two friends in confusion. “What’d I miss?”
Peter didn’t say anything, just nodded and leaned further against the billionaire’s side. He loved team movie nights. And there was no way he’d pass off a chance to snuggle with his teammates, particularly his father-figure. Odin knows May never gave him any affection; unless you counted slapping and kicking as affection.
Peter sat quietly opposite the billionaire, cuffed with two armed kidnappers on either side of him. Even though he was handcuffed with two guns pointed at his head, and six other armed guards surrounded him, Peter was calm, seemingly unfazed by the whole kidnapping thing.
“And we can’t forget the dinner you so rudely interrupted.” Rose continued, the smirk never dropping off her lips. “It was such a nice meal until you interfered.”
Rose gave a noncommittal shrug, clearly unbothered by the topic at hand. “If you call surviving monstrous. Then I suppose we are monsters.” She took a few steps closer to Peter and leaned down to look him in the eyes. “And we will continue to survive. We will continue to hunt down viewers, no matter their age, no matter their background. I don’t care how much they beg, scream, and cry. But I think,” she straightened up and took a few steps back, “I think we can start off with the Avengers.”
“You know why we have to do this.” A smile accompanied her words. “Why we conduct our experiments. Don’t you, subject?”
Rose, the hat, looked down at the little girl pinned to the ground with fake pity. “Oh, sweetheart,” she smiled maliciously as she held up a scalpel for the terrified child to see, “of course we are.”
“I’m so sorry, Peter.” Tony leaned forward as far as the men restraining him would allow. He meant those words with all of his might. But
Peter shuffled from foot to foot uncomfortably, not ready to confront his teammates. If there was one thing he hated most, it was being at the center of attention; whether he was Peter Parker or Spider-Man, it didn’t matter. Feeling people’s eyes on him was unnerving, his past experiences of being in the limelight unsavory. Typically, people only gave him attention if he did something wrong or if they were angry with him.
Rose’s smile grew, morphing into a twisted grin that could rival the DC Joker’s. “My name is Rose. We’ve already met.” Her eyes trailed Peter’s small form, taking in his weakened state, pleased with how much he was suffering and enjoying the agony he was currently in. “But I can’t wait to get reacquainted.”
Tony and Peter were chained to the cracked cement floor in the center of the vacant warehouse, a heavy shackle around their left ankle. During their uncomfortable ride, the handcuffs they initially wore were switched out for shiny, much bulkier cuffs that, by the looks of them, were not your standard police handcuffs.
“Really!” Clint practically screamed. He jumped off the refrigerator and grabbed a soup spoon out of the nearest cabinet drawer, nearly stumbling over his own feet in his haste. He held up the spoon at arm’s length and asked, “can you bend this?”
Rose couldn’t suppress the panicked gasp that escaped her when multiple shadowy figures started to emerge from the portal. Stalking closer and closer to her as the whispers only increased in speed and intensity.
This is my drawing of the Wendigo from the previous chapter! I actually kinda like it and I hope you will too:)
May didn’t know about Spider-Man’s secret identity, something Peter had assured them of over a year ago. However, both she and her late husband had known about Peter’s mutations and some of his many powers. And it was rather apparent that May didn’t like mutants or super-humans; that much was clear. Why none of the Avengers knew. Fear often drove most people’s hate and inability to accept those who were different.
“Ah, speaking of intern,” Tony muttered to himself as he pulled a thick white envelope from his back jeans pocket, “here. I almost forgot.” He handed the envelope, which was now creased and crumpled from being in his pocket to Peter.
With that, Peter turned and left, the emergency exit door slamming shut, signaling the end of the conversation.
“Yeah.” Billy laughed. “She didn’t put up much of a fight. Screamed like crazy, though.” The cult broke out in boisterous laughs and cheers as if they had just won the lottery.
Each ghost gave some form of consolation in an attempt to make their living friend feel better. Most of them knew what it was like to lose a family member. After each spirit said their piece, they waved goodbye with a smile and vanished back into the Unknown, where they resided until deciding to move on.
, and Natasha led Peter into the large, open-concept kitchen on the first communal floor. She guided him towards the granite island and sat him down on one of the tall bar stools, subtly making eye contact with Steve, who was standing in the archway between the lounge area and the kitchen talking to Tony.
“Of course, Boss.” The AI replied dutifully. In an almost happy tone, she said, “it is wonderful to see you awake, Peter.”
MJ’s typical demeanor of aloof indifference faltered momentarily. Peter, the skinny, adorable, lovable little nerd, made her happy. She couldn’t deny how much he meant to her. If something ever happened to him...
“Bud!” Suddenly, Tony was in his face, tears streaming down the older hero’s cheeks. “Holy shit- You’re… you’re gonna be fine.”
“So,” Rose looked around the tiny room, unimpressed by its simplicity and lack of decoration, “this is your room.”
Each Avenger had a different expression, although each one could be equated with either shock, fear, or confusion. The exception being Natasha, who watched Peter with nothing but love and pride. This is precisely why Peter hadn’t wanted to tell any of them about his sixth sense and psychic abilities. He did not want them to be afraid of him and ostracize him as a result.
“I don’t remember giving you permission.” May stalked towards him, like a tiger cornering its prey, teeth bared and claws out. She grabbed his arm, slowly rolled up the sleeve of his hoodie, and pressed the lit end of her cigarette against his skin.
Peter leaned farther back against his pseudo aunt, relishing in the warmth and comfort she brought. “English. I’m too tired to focus on anything else.” He sounded fatigued as if he hadn’t slept in days, his voice slightly hoarse. The purple rings under his eyes a physical affirmation of his fatigue.
He was just about to start talking, begging, crying, anything to buy them more time; when a sickening crack echoed throughout the otherwise empty expanse of the warehouse.
“Well, I’m glad you did.” Tony huffed, his impatience becoming more apparent the longer they waited to take off. “As much as I don’t like it, you and Peter have a friendship goin’ on. And the more help we can get, the easier this’ll be. So,” he looked at the wizard, expectantly, “ya got any tips for us?”
Recovery is always difficult no matter the trauma. But Peter’s got his friends and family by his side to love and support him.
Peter shook his head then abruptly stopped when the motion made him dizzy. “Everyone messes up sometimes, Mr. Stark. The important thing is that you learn from your mistakes.” A content smile grew on his lips as he recalled the many things Tony had done for him. “You’ve helped me a lot ever since we met, more than you realize. And I appreciate all of it.”
Bucky furrowed his eyebrows in confusion and leaned further back against the plush leather armchair he was sitting in. “What’s a viewer? I’ve never heard that term before.”
“Please, momma!” Peter begged, tears streaming down his pale and sunken cheeks. The tiny eight-year-old stood pressed up against the cement wall, petrified. Blood trailed down his skinny chest from the three-inch-long incisions below his collar bones, staining the pale grey fabric of his shirt red.
Peter was surprised… to say the least. Seeing the billionaire openly crying and expressing his feelings was an unusual sight. Outside of the Avengers and his closest friends, no one saw Tony’s softer, more emotional side. An air of snarky confidence and sometimes arrogance always being worn by the seemingly infallible man. But in private, the iron walls thinned, revealing Tony’s ability to be empathetic, kind, and loving. His ruffled edges softened even more around Steve and Peter.
“So… are you going to tell me why you’re hiding out in the panic room?” Natasha asked curiously, watching the skinny teen from her position in the doorway, arms crossed against her chest. “You’ve been in here for quite a while, and I know what happens when you’re left alone with your thoughts.”
Peter’s telekinetic/psychic powers are a combination of Eleven’s from Stranger Things and Nico Di Angelo’s from Rick Riordan’s Heroes of Olympus series. There’s also a few Harry Potter references in this chapter.
“Hey!” Peter swatted at his mentor’s hand, playfully. His curls were hard enough to tame as it was; he didn’t need anyone fluffing them up any further. “I’m your only intern, Mr. Stark,” Peter smirked, looking and sounding more like Tony than he realized.
Peter was just tired. So tired, and he no longer wanted to fight. After all, who would miss him if he died? The team would no longer have to babysit him, Tony wouldn’t have to associate with him out of guilt, and his friends would move on, happy to no longer be weighed down by his presence.
Upsetting Peter was the very last thing he wanted to do, especially with how much the kid adored him and looked up to him. Tony would never forgive himself if he broke the kid’s trust. But Peter was hiding something; Tony knew that much. And he had a hunch whatever secret Peter was hiding involved May. And not being one to beat-around-the-bush, Tony decided that asking outright would work fine.
Depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem were tough things to deal with, let alone talk about. And Peter wasn’t one to vent to others because he didn’t want to bother anyone, often putting on a mask instead, feigning normalcy in order to spare others. A facade so good that he left even the best spies in the world guessing. So, when something was clearly bothering Peter, the heroes found a way to get him to open up without him having to have to do much talking; a game of yes or no. And more often than not, it worked.
Crow whistled, impressed by this child’s immense power. “We gonna go get ’im? Or should we recruit him?”
As the argument spurred to life, no one took notice that the lights throughout the kitchen, dining room and lounge began to flicker. Their power being drained by the young meta unknowingly.
Steve dropped down beside his boyfriend while the rest of the team hung back. Their faces pinched in either concern or guilt. Maybe a mix of the two. Peter was too out of it to care.
“Good.” Natasha crouched down in front of Peter, so she was looking up at him. “Now,” she pulled a first aid kit from behind her back and held it up for the teen to see, “let me clean you up a little. Hm?”
“Just a turn of the head.” Peter mumbled absentmindedly as he helped Tony to his feet. “That’s all it takes.”
The two geniuses remained in each other’s arms, even when Steve entered the room with a tray of food in his hands. Instead of pulling apart, Peter beckoned the Captain over, grabbing his hand as he approached. Without needing to be prompted, Steve wrapped his muscular arms around his boyfriend and son, holding them in a gentle grip.
Peter’s eyes glowed brightly, another animalistic snarl escaping his throat before he answered, voice echoing. “I am death.”
“Let’s get you something to eat.” She mumbled absentmindedly as she dug through the two-door refrigerator. “There’s plenty of food here. What would you like, sweetheart?”
Anger surged through the young hero at the realization that the little girl had likely been kidnapped and that she would not be found alive. She would die out in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by strangers. The strangers who killed her.
Mary stepped forward, her heels clicking on the smooth cement floor. She patted her husband’s shoulder and smiled. A signal for him to wait. That she would take it from here. Crouching down, so she was eye level with Peter, she reached out and touched his cheek. Her movements were slow and her touch soft with mock gentleness.
“Pepper and Michael are away for their first wedding anniversary so Tony won’t be scheduled for any meetings. And unless an Avengers level threat pops up, no one will be away on any missions.” She smirked. “So you’ve got all of us to deal with, kid.”
She kissed Peter’s forehead, lightly caressing his cheek in a soft display of motherly affection, something Natasha only showed towards the young arachnid. After another quick kiss on his cheek, Natasha moved back into her previous position, so their backs were touching once again. “Now, continue.”
The realization that they wouldn’t make it out alive seemingly dawned on them from the very second he broke free. There was no way Peter would let them leave alive, and they knew it.
Peter grumbled silently in his head. As much as he loved Tony, looking up to the man as if he were his father, one of the only grievances he had with the billionaire was that Tony rarely apologized.
Next chapter is the last. I also drew a picture of the wendigo from this chapter, and I’m going to try to upload it so you can see:) if I have time, that is.
An old, rundown apartment building in the low-end of Queens, New York, ended up being her destination. The once red bricks were now brown, verging on black, tarnished from years of pollution. Most of the windows were barred off in a feeble attempt to fend off any potential criminals and provide the inhabitants’ peace of mind. The majority of the surrounding buildings showed similar signs of decay, all of them past their prime.
Each hero adored Peter and had their own personal way of showing it. Clint and Scott, both being fathers, couldn’t help but “mother” the young teen, using their paternal instincts as an excuse to tell dad-jokes. Bucky became extremely protective of him almost instantly, due to Peter’s strong resemblance and personality akin to Steve post-serum. Even the iron walls Tony had so expertly built around himself were no match for Peter’s big heart, crumbling as if they were composed of nothing but sand.
“Y-yeah.” Tony’s face fell, and he looked away in shame. They were supposed to be at the Tower, goofing off in the lab together while U and Dum-E frantically tried to clean up whatever messes got made. But instead, they were tied up in some horror-movie warehouse being tortured by an ex-con.
Sunlight poured through the large windows cut into each wall, illuminating the barren room in a warm light. No longer bathed in shadows, the added light gave the warehouse a warmer feel. But now, it was so much easier for the Knot to notice Hamir’s presence.
Clint swiped one of the remaining pancakes before climbing up on top of the refrigerator, his usual perch that gave him a birds-eye-view of the entire kitchen, adjacent living area, and hallway entrance. “So, how you feelin’, Pete?”
A soft hum fell from Rose’s lips as she closed her eyes. Breathing deeply, she pulled herself into a meditative state. She rested her hands on her knees and slowed her breathing as the external background noises faded into nothing. The wind that tugged her hair only seconds ago settled, removing the chill from the night air. Using the energies around herself to sift through the universe, this her element. With her third-eye wide open, she allowed her consciousness to drift.
“Look at me,” Natasha scooted to the side and put her hand under Peter’s chin so he would look at her. Once his big, doe-eyes met her emerald-green ones, she said what the entire team knew to be true. “You are not a freak, Peter Parker. It doesn’t matter that you’re a mutant, it’s what’s in your heart and mind that truly matters.”
Her smirk fell off once she turned and saw the uneasy look on Peter’s face. “Right?” She asked again, less confidently this time.
Peter’s current situation brings up old memories he would rather forget but the Knot’s persistence and cruelty forces him to unmask a side of himself he never wanted the Avengers to see.
“Got these babies from Toomes,” the guard cuffing Peter said proudly, “before his entire operation went up in flames anyway.” He shot Tony a hateful glare. “No thanks to you and your team of freaks.”
His consciousness began slipping away as the hunger, pain, and fatigue took hold once again. Dark spots danced across his vision, and he went under without a fight, the persistent loneliness in his chest disappearing along with his consciousness.
“Good behavior.” The man chuckled, waving his hand dismissively. “But that’s beside the point.” He crouched down in front of Peter and smiled, looking the young hero up and down. “I’m more interested in the fact that you have a kid.”
Taking another deep breath, he unlocked the door and slowly entered the dimly lit apartment with plain beige walls. The smell of smoke struck him immediately, and his spider-sense buzzed incessantly at the base of his skull.
“Yes, I am, Rogers,” Natasha answered before Peter could, a cheeky grin on her face. She gestured to the refrigerator with the spatula in her hand. “Why don’t you make yourself useful and cut up the strawberries that are in the fridge.”
Peter gripped the strap of his backpack tightly, much tighter than was necessary. But he couldn’t help it, his anxiety soaring through the proverbial glass ceiling. It was Sunday night and the end of May’s extra shifts, which meant leaving the safety of Avengers Tower, where he felt most at home. He didn’t want to go.
After a quick but thorough once-over, Natasha gave the signal. “It’s all clear. Get Tony and Peter, then head to the quinjet. Go!”
“No! Oh, god, no!” Tony shook his head furiously, more upset by the fact that Peter thought they could ever be mad at him or afraid of him. “Kid,” he rested both hands on the teen’s boney shoulders, “we could never think of you like that. Right, guys?” Everyone shook their heads and gave a verbal affirmation. “See,” he smiled at the adorable hero he considered his son, brushing the downy-soft curls from Peter’s forehead. “You don’t got anything to worry about, okay?”
“It wasn’t residual energy. Mary wasn’t just going through the motions or haunting her tomb. S-she was conscious. It was like…”
“No, it’s not.” Natasha quickly shook herself out of her stupor, well aware of how worried Peter was feeling. The very last thing she wanted was to make Peter feel any worse than he already did. She needed to be there for him. “How long have you been able to do this?”
He was hovering in the sky, looking down on what appeared to be a small caravan of trailers parked in a circle within a small forest clearing. It was nighttime wherever they were, and the forest was dark except for the lights on the trailers and a glowing campfire in the very center of the clearing. He could smell the smoke, hear the nocturnal wildlife, and see what those people were doing.
“I can not wait to get my hands on you,” Rose murmured as she brushed her fingers through Peter’s soft hair. “You will keep us alive for centuries to come.” She grinned, baring her teeth at her unsuspecting prey.
The child sleeping before her was slight of build and had curly honey-brown hair that fell over his closed eyes. His long eyelashes greatly contrasted against the pale skin they rested on. He looked far younger than sixteen years old, and he certainly didn’t appear threatening. If he could be equated with anything, it would be a fawn. A fawn who had yet to learn how to run and possessed all of its spots.
Soft beeping and cozy linen sheets that smelled of lavender gently welcomed Peter back into consciousness. He was in a hospital bed with the head propped up, so he was in a seated position. There were various machines connected to his small body. However, he only recognized the heart monitor clip on his index finger, his mind still too cloudy with sleep to distinguish any of the other medical equipment. An IV was attached to the back of his right hand, which, on any other day, probably would have unnerved him since he hated needles. But right now… he didn’t feel stressed, anxious, or angry. All he felt was calm, a tranquility he never felt before. It was nice.
Hamir looked away once again, guilt written all over his face. “I always thought the same thing, Mr. Stark.” He spoke somberly, tears pooling in his eyes. “But it was not my place to interfere. Like the Watchers who oversee the multiverse, I was simply meant to stand by and guard Peter against more… supernatural threats.”
Peter took a hesitant step inside, prepared to fight whoever had so-obviously broken into the apartment. What, or rather who, he saw crushed any hopes he had of saving his aunt.
“She won’t come to the Tower or anywhere near this place.” Peter left out the fact that May hated mutants and Tony Stark. That she hated him, her own nephew. “Mr. Stark, please!”
This time Peter managed to choke out a quiet, “yeah.” However, it was barely audible unless you had enhanced hearing like the super-soldiers.
Hamir nodded, sadly, his lips pressed into a firm line. “I do know,” he said, “although I wish I could say differently.”
“I’m assuming that’s the major proponent to you not liking Halloween or the month of October in general. Most people go all out, decorating with gory and ugly ornaments. And some people, the bad ones, try to conjure things that bring about dark energies.”
“Because he’s the kindest and most selfless person on the planet.” Tony stated with confidence. He glared back at his tormentor. “And he doesn’t deserve to have to deal with scum like you.”
The phone rang and rang, and rang. After it went to voicemail, he tried again. The second time it went to voicemail, he froze. A sudden thought struck him, sending chills down his spine and forcing his heart even further up his throat. He stepped away from his desk and called his fastest suit. “Mark forty-nine.” His suit molded to his form, and he blasted off into the night sky.
The spirits would welcome him and accept him as one of their own. He could slip into the Unknown without a hint of difficulty and just… let go.
“You ready to go, kiddo?” Tony asked once the service came to a close, his hand still resting on Peter’s shoulder.
Peter’s grip on the knife handle tightened to the point where he could hear the wood begin to splinter. “You mean me, their experiment.” He wouldn’t look at Tony and stopped cutting, the knife being squashed under his powerful grip.
“She told me to be careful because they were looking for me and that she was sorry she hadn’t been able to kill them all when she was alive. That they kill people like her and me; people with psychic abilities.” He cleared his throat in an attempt to put his heart back in its place within his chest. “Then she disappeared, and I got the hell out of there. Only Ned and MJ noticed I was missing.”
“It would be a good idea.” Natasha punched in the deactivation code for the panic room, then put her arm around Peter’s thin waist and began leading them to the nearest elevator. “You’re spending the weekend, right?”
But he couldn’t help but wish that maybe someday, she would be. MJ was strong, beautiful, unique, and Peter absolutely adored her. But he would be putting her in even more danger if they started dating, a risk he wasn’t yet ready to take. MJ and Ned were already risking their safety by simply knowing him. He couldn’t bear losing another loved one.
Peter looked up at Tony and Steve, his dad and papa. The adoption process was still in the works, but Tony had gotten custody of Peter with the help of Fury, Pepper, and his team of lawyers. But Peter had started to call Tony dad and Steve papa the day he woke up in the med bay. Both older heroes had expressed how much they and the team adored Peter and that they wanted him to be a part of their crazy, somewhat-dysfunctional family, permanently.
After what felt like hours of driving, the van eventually came to a halt, and the two heroes were roughly grabbed and removed from its bowls. Metal barrels, broken equipment, and trash littered the surrounding landscape. Peter looked around, trying to take in his surroundings as best he could. But the starless sky offered little to no light. Even with his enhanced eyesight, he could only make out vague shadows and figures. Ominous-looking cumulonimbus clouds started to gather, becoming a symbolic representation of the heroes’ situation.
Tony was thoroughly enjoying himself, like he did anytime he was with Peter. But in this case it was their downfall. He let his guard down, allowing these unknown criminals to kidnap them. And now, as he and Peter sat tied up being jostled around in the back of a van, he was thoroughly kicking himself for it.
“Pete, I-“ he massaged his temples, feeling a stress headache begin to form. “I think it’s safe to assume that you don’t want to have a full-on conversation, so… questions?”
Tony set the empty cup on the nearby overbed table tucked against the wall to his left. “Your healing factor sure is outstanding.” Tony mused, genuinely amazed by Peter’s incredible powers. “But I guess sleeping for almost five days can help too.”
Peter looked away from his mentor, the plate of eggs in front of him untouched. If he tried to eat anything, he was sure it would all come back up again. “I’m sorry.”
Of course, Peter would forgive him. The kid was compassionate and the most selfless person in the universe. There wasn’t a spiteful bone in his tiny body. One thought kept circulating Tony’s mind.
“And I- ugh.” The teen groaned when a particularly deep cut on his left shoulder throbbed painfully, and fresh blood began pouring out. He pointedly ignored Tony’s concerned look. “I’m assuming you did something to piss him off.”
May’s posture was stick-straight, her hands clenched into fists, and her eyes held nothing but fear. She was breathing, but very slowly. It was like she was partially frozen, a statue. Blood flowed freely from the long gash on her forehead just above her left eyebrow.
Tony stood outside Peter’s bedroom door, too afraid to knock but too remorseful to walk away without saying anything. It wasn’t often that the billionaire was left speechless, but at this moment, he had absolutely no clue what to say. He didn’t want to offend Peter further, but he knew that saying nothing would be even worse.
Friday responded through Tony’s nanotechnology glasses, her voice a notch lower than usual. “Yes, Boss. Anything else?”
“Be-because,” a fresh wave of tears cascaded down his face, some catching in his long eyelashes as they fell, “because I am-am a mutant.”
Tony dropped to the ground to stand beside his husband. “Peter’s in there.” He spoke in a hushed tone, his voice wavering ever so slightly.
“Feed off you?” Tony’s uneasiness was apparent, not liking the sound of someone trying to feed off of Peter.
“Don’t worry, Steve.” Natasha squeezed her friend’s hand and offered a smile. “We’ll get your boyfriend back. And our little spider.”
Peter had a rough life. He experienced more loss in his sixteen years of life than most people would experience in a lifetime. And Peter had just turned sixteen just two months prior. Even before he started going out as Spider-Man, pain, both physical and psychological, neglect, and abuse were things the teen was very familiar with. And while Peter never openly talked about his parents and what it was like growing up with them, there were enough clues for the team to piece together how horrible it had been for Peter.
Crickets chirped in a steady rhythm, and a nearby owl hooted as they came to life with the dying twilight. The black canvas above was speckled with bright white stars and the smallest traces of a waning crescent moon. A single campfire illuminated the circle of campers below, casting shadows that reached out to the otherwise dark forest.
“But, Mr. Stark, I yelled at you first.” Peter didn’t regret being honest; it had been a long time coming. But he could have gone for a more gentle approach. Yelling rarely solved anything. At least in his experience.
“And you shouldn’t have tried to defend me. You should have just run.” He looked away guiltily, knowing there was no point in trying to convince Peter not to save someone. Besides, this was all his fault. They were in meetings all day, so he hadn’t thought to carry any suit or weapon on him. All he had was his phone, which was lying in the middle of Central Park smashed to pieces. Hopefully, the team had gotten his distress signal.
“Yes.” Steve rolled his eyes. Despite being adults, his teammates sure could be childish at times. He was grateful that Peter was so mature and polite for his age. “About ten more minutes.”
“Peter,” Hamir reached for Peter, his desperation evident. He knew he was going to die, but Peter, the child he loved as his son, didn’t have to.
Unsurprisingly, the front entrance was locked, a rusted deadbolt serving as the metalloid gatekeeper. The locked door proved to be more of a minor inconvenience rather than an obstacle. Rose didn’t have a key, but there was no need for one in the dream realm. She took to the sky once again, drifting counterclockwise around the building until she found the source of power she set out to find. She found her destination seven floors up, and with minimal effort, she phased through the wall.
The armed kidnappers brought them into a nearby warehouse, its metal siding tarnished and dirty from years of neglect. Besides the occasional cardboard box or piece of scrap-wood, the inside was empty, a thick layer of dust covering just about every available surface. Large wooden beams held up the sheet metal ceiling, the rust and decay prominent even from the ground. Three rows of single-bulb pendant lights hung from the rafters, the old bulbs flickering every few minutes as they struggled to stay lit.
“Holy shi- Ah shoot. I’m so glad you’re okay. We’re all so glad you’re okay.” Without hesitating, Tony wrapped his arms around the teen, carefully so as not to disturb any of Peter’s wounds, and pulled him against his chest. “Oh, Peter,” he spoke against the fluffy curls tickling his cheek, “you scared the living shit outta us. Ya know that?”
Peter couldn’t move. Just sat there in silence and stared at Hamir’s lifeless body, watching as a puddle of blood slowly grew around him.
A silence heavier than lead fell over the room, settling on the heroes like a blanket. None of the heroes had expected such a grave turn of events, and it caused their stomachs to twist into knots. This cult seemed to be as abominable as any other villain they’d faced in the past.
Peter couldn’t help but smile, grateful for the amazing heroes he saw as his family. Never had he ever dreamed of being a part of such a wonderful, albeit crazy, family. A soft poke from his pseudo aunt told him to continue. “They grabbed me. I couldn’t fight back without revealing my identity, so…” he took a deep, shuddering breath, “so I let them drag me back over to that creepy, decrepit mausoleum and throw me in.” His breath caught in his throat as tears clouded his vision, the memory playing on repeat in his mind. “They shut the doors and locked it behind me.”
He and the team needed to figure things out, but for now, he just wanted to lift Peter’s mood. And he took great pride in the fact that Peter loved tinkering in the lab with him.
“Why aren’t you in the panic room?” Tony blurted then immediately cringed. That was not a good way to start this conversation.
Peter sat quietly for a few minutes, contemplating what he should say and if he should even talk at all. The Avengers were his family, and getting them involved could be potentially life-threatening. He would never, ever consciously put his family in harm’s way.
Clint sat in the pilot’s seat with Sam as his copilot while everyone else remained in the fuselage. Despite the heroes' intense need to be close to their previously MIA teammates, everyone hung back so they wouldn’t overcrowd the small family unit. It was more important for Tony, Steve, and Peter to be near one another right now.
“Holy shit, Steve.” Tony collapsed into his boyfriend’s muscular arms, completely melting into the warm embrace. He grasped the back of Steve’s suit in an iron grip, seemingly afraid Steve would disappear that he would blink and find Peter and himself back in that warehouse.
“Hm?” Peter peered around the super-soldier into the living room to see the rest of the Avengers seated in a semicircle; an elderly man in long robes was standing in the middle. He gasped, “Hamir!”
“I can hear your heartbeat,” Peter spoke up from the opposite side of the door, scaring Tony more than the mechanic would ever admit.
“Wha- h-how?” Crow looked between Rose, who was cowering behind an old barrel, and the teen in front of him. “That’s not possible! You ca-“
“You do know that none of us are afraid of you, right? None of the Avengers, Happy, or Pepper. We are not afraid of you. We care about you, Peter.” Tony stated adamantly and with as much conviction as he could muster. He needed Peter to know that he meant it. “We love you, kid. You’re a part of our crazy family, and we’ll stick with you, no matter what.”
“Anyway, I tried to move away from it while Mr. Harrison and the rest of the class talked to the tour guide by an oak tree nearby. I had just turned back onto the path when some kids grabbed me and started pulling me back over to the mausoleum.”
Because in Tony’s mind, he deserved nothing more than to rot six feet under for all the pain and grief he caused Peter.
“No.” Peter dropped out of Steve’s hold and backed away, his anxiety levels rising the more he thought about his aunt. He couldn’t stay even though he wanted to. The Tower was his home, the place where he felt safe and loved. But there was someone he needed to check on before he could allow himself to rest. “I… I can’t stay.”
“You’re monsters.” His tears continued to fall, and he forced himself to look away from the dead man at his feet. No amount of wishing and pleading would bring his friend back.
“We-we’re here, Steve,” Tony responded, his voice still shaking more than he would have liked. Once his eyes landed on his boyfriend, Tony sighed in relief. He wrapped his arm around Peter’s narrow shoulders and gently pulled him to his feet while keeping the boy tucked against his side.
“I didn’t know Flash was still on your decathlon team.” Natasha mused. “He’s got the IQ of a troglodyte.”
Deciding to wait until Peter had eaten, Tony and the rest of the team joined the others in the kitchen. The billionaire sat beside his protégé, watching him with nothing but love in his eyes. Peter had grown on the mechanic pretty much instantly. And as far as Tony was concerned, Peter was his son in every way except biologically. He loved the teen more than life itself.
“See ya later this week, kid.” Happy gave the teen a curt nod before pulling away from the dilapidated apartment building.
“The decathlon team and my English class went on a field trip to Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn to celebrate the start of our Junior year. Mr. Harrison had been planning it for a while but settled on going today because it’s Halloween and the tour offers discounted tickets for the holiday. We left before the second bell and got back to Midtown around 2:00, half an hour before school lets out.”
The next time Peter woke up, it was to hushed murmuring and a hand on his forehead. A warm, calloused hand that felt nice against his chilled skin. Peter jerked back instinctively, his injuries protesting at the sudden movement.
“Would you get your goddamn hands off me?” Tony snapped, glaring at the kidnapper restraining him and effectively keeping him from comforting his kid. “And these,” he shook the too-tight cuffs on his wrists, “are these even necessary? It’s not like I could actually break out of a speeding van filled to the brim with armed criminals.”
The woman wearing the patched magician’s hat paused for a moment, looking around the surrounding forest as if listening for something, searching for a distant call from an unknown source. Peter cried out again, begging them to stop, and the woman’s gaze found him. Her eyes were cold and unfeeling.
Crow was next. The warlock fired off spell after spell; each one meant to incapacitate the mutant he was fighting. “Alarte Ascendare! Petrificus Totalus! Stupefy! Sectumsempra! Expelliarmus!” But Peter dodged or deflected each spell and incantation, unfazed by the magic. Crow continued to back up until his back hit one of the mold-covered walls of the warehouse. He whimpered in fear as Peter closed in. In one last desperate attempt to stop his attacker, Crow screamed, “Avada Kedavra!”
Tony opened his mouth to speak but quickly snapped it shut. He was not really sure what to make of this entire situation. He and the Avengers - as well as many affiliated heroes and part-time Avengers - had experienced countless bizarre happenings. But this was different. It was personal because his kid had a history of sorts with these villains.
Tony quickly headed for the door, suddenly very eager to get out of that apartment. “Call the team, tell them to suit up.”
“Yes, I am.” Hamir nodded. “Initially, I planned on going myself. But after conferring with some of my fellow wizards, I elected to meet with you all first.”
She quirked an eyebrow and huffed sarcastically, “right. And the sky isn’t blue.” MJ lightly touched her friend’s neck, her fingers ghosting over the barely-visible bruises. Bruises that looked like someone had dug their fingers into his skin. “Ned might be oblivious, but I’m not.”
Another kidnapper, with a bazooka strapped to his back, chuckled, “you two’ll be hidden well enough by the time they even realize you’re gone.”
Peter’s and the Avengers’ job was to make sure criminals like that got what they deserved. And Peter was not about to let Mr. Stark, his mentor, his father figure, die. Not after everything they had been through.
“Don’t be upset, Mr. Stark, please.” Peter lightly tugged at the billionaire’s sleeve to get his attention. “He’s helped me a lot, honest.”
No matter how many times Tony inconvenienced Peter or forced him into an uncomfortable situation, the teen would shove aside his feelings and put on a brave face, unwilling to let his mentor down. Press events and galas were two things Peter despised - another thing the two heroes had in common - yet he never griped whenever Tony dragged him along to one of the lengthy events. Events that were always filled with sensory-deprecating lights, sounds, and smells that undoubtedly hurt Peter’s enhanced senses. Peter was just his polite, well-behaved self every time.
It hurt to see such a sweet, innocent kid whither away under all of the weight he felt he needed to carry alone. But the teen’s selflessness just pushed the Avenger to support him further.
“Where were you? Hm?” May asked from her seat in the living room, a heavy frown masking her delicate features. She gestured to the small space that was sparsely decorated with second-hand furniture, her scowl deepening. “I came home, and you weren’t here. Even though you were supposed to be.” She looked him up and down expectantly, a lit cigarette between her lips.
“None that I’ve ever seen before.” Clint huffed, his unique eyesight allowing him to see the otherwise invisible force field. He was familiar with all types of force fields, from magical Asgardian ones, alien energy shields, and the defense shields that SHIELD had created from confiscated alien technology. Each one had its own colors and sounds, which helped to identify them. This one, however, was new.
“Nice to finally meet you, Peter.” Crow said politely. He smiled, but it was anything but warm; the large dagger in his hand only solidified that fact. “I was just talking with your aunt,” he gestured to May, who was seated in the chair next to him, “she’s very disappointed in you.”
“Boy. A teenager, I think.” She took a seat on a nearby tree trunk a few feet from the grave and directed her fellow Knot member to sit beside her. “He’s the one who threw us back.”
The shadows all darted forward at once. The details of their appearance became visible as they dove into action. A wendigo, a hellhound, a rake, and various malevolent spirits swarmed Rose. Their fangs and claws tore into her soft flesh, and they greedily drunk up her bloody screams.
After returning to the Tower earlier that afternoon, Tony filled everyone in on what he found at the Parker’s apartment. Confirming their suspicions that Peter had been taken. Each Avenger and associated heroes had a dime-sized tracking chip embedded in their necks in case any of them dropped off the map or needed to be located quickly. The trackers were powered by body heat, so they never ran down and were manufactured by Shuri in Wakanda. Using the tracking chip in Peter’s neck, Tony found the boy’s location.
“I-I know. I s’pose it’s time I told you guys anyway. But… I don’t want you guys to be afraid of me or… or to hate me.”
No matter how much Tony disappointed him, dropping so far under the kid’s expectations it would be considered comical, Peter never lost faith in the man. Peter never once questioned Tony or his authority as an Avenger or otherwise. He just followed Tony like a lost puppy, eager to learn anything and everything he could, all while looking at Tony as if he’d hung the stars above. Even after Tony harshly criticized him as Spider-Man and brutally lectured him as a civilian. Peter just took it without a word of protest.
Hamir smiled in understanding, “It’s what we wizards and other beings of the supernatural realms call people with the ability to see or communicate with the dead or have natural psychic abilities which are not connected to a mutant gene.”
“I can find him.” She replied confidently, mentally compiling what she’d need to do to prepare. “It might take some time, but I’ll get him. Don’t you worry.”
Hazy and unfocused eyes locked onto the figure crouched down in front of him. The voice sounded familiar. Very familiar. But Peter’s spider-sense was on high alert, and pain was clouding his mind, messing with his perception. He began to struggle, using what little strength he had to move away from the hand that was touching him.
“We want to help you, bud,” Tony said once they pulled apart. He kept one hand at the base of Peter’s neck, squeezing gently, knowing how much Peter loved physical affection. “But we can’t help you if you won’t talk to us.”
Tony sighed, guilt settling deep inside his chest, the heavyweight making it difficult for him to breathe properly. “I know, kid. And you’re right. But I meant that you shouldn’t have taken my punishment.”
The temperature dropped drastically to the point where Rose could see her breath every time she exhaled and goosebumps formed on her skin. The heavy smell of adrenaline and fear hung around them as the tension continued to build.
“Anything yet?” Steve asked as he paced back and forth at the head of the conference table in the Avengers conference room. “When did you receive the distress signal?”
Crow walked closer to stand beside Rose and draped his arm across her shoulders. “My name’s Crow,” he greeted, his tone far too polite and charismatic for the situation. He gestured to the other people standing behind him, saying their names as he pointed to them. “These are our friends, Billy, Sarey, Snakebite Andy, Barry, and Diesel.”
Tony desperately needed to hear the kid’s voice. Even if Peter just continued to scream and berate him, Tony didn’t care. Peter had always grounded him, and he needed that more than ever right now.
But appearances didn’t mean a thing. Rose could feel the massive amount of power the teen possessed. The energy rolled off of him like waves, even in sleep.
The heartbreaking confession was a metaphorical punch in the throat. None of the heroes could speak, not having the words to respond to such a heartbreaking admission. Peter continued, his tears never ceasing.
“You will not touch my memories or my mind,” Peter growled, his voice echoing as if he were in a cave. Fists clenched, he stalked closer to Rose, who found herself frozen in place by some invisible force. “How about I take a look at yours?” Peter’s eyes glowed brighter than before, and he put his hand on the center of Rose’s forehead.
He also felt like such a burden to the Avengers and was dreading the day they became tired of dealing with him and told him to stay away.
He never had anyone that cared about him growing up; no mother or father to hug him or dry his tears when he was afraid, tell him they loved him. No one had ever looked out for Peter, only seeing him as a burden or waste of space. His friendship with MJ and Ned had been a sturdy rock in his otherwise melancholy life. Peter looked up to the Avengers, seeing them as not just teammates but also family.
“As you are all aware, Peter is a very powerful meta, or mutant as some people like to say, and is the  most powerful viewer I’ve ever seen. Thus, he is a magnet for spirits and other supernatural entities, allowing them to detect him easily. Sadly, the entities that are attracted to his presence tend to be malevolent in nature. Therefore more likely to cause harm.” He explained the situation to the best of his abilities, knowing full-well how protective the Avengers were over Peter and that they needed to know more in order to protect the beloved vigilante and themselves.
The journey from Manhattan to Queens took about seven-minutes in the Iron Man suit on average. Tonight it took less than five minutes; a new record. Tony instinctively powered off his thrusters, so his landing was quieter. The suit compacted into a briefcase that he quickly grabbed before rushing up the apartment building’s creaking staircase.
“There’s a child we need to find.” She said, her tone one of complete seriousness. “During our dinner, I felt it. I haven’t felt raw power like that in centuries.”
Peter’s face lit up instantly, which caused MJ to smile. “Really!” He was positively beaming. “Do you want to, um, go to the park, maybe? Can we walk around and talk? Only if you want to, that is.”
“You-you can see dead people?” Tony started slowly in an effort to not stress Peter out any more than he already was. And judging by the kid’s tense posture and rapidly bouncing leg, Peter was chest-high in anxiety and worry. “Like the kid from The Shining?”
The rest of the team froze; even Steve paused stirring to look up at Tony with wide eyes. Tony could be arrogant and overconfident at times. But it wasn’t like him to instigate a full-on argument with his teammates, at least not out-of-the-blue. And especially not with Peter. Everyone knew that this conversation wasn’t going anywhere good.
Rose’s eyes rolled back into her skull, and she let out a piercing scream. She could see Peter going through her memories, feel his presence in her mind, and felt a searing hot burning sensation emanating from where Peter grabbed her arm and was touching her forehead.
The conversation dropped off after that, and they fell into companionable silence. A lot of previously unknown information had just been thrown out into the open. And while Natasha was grateful that Peter felt safe enough to talk to her and open up about some of his other abilities and experiences, she now had more questions than she did answers.
After their fight, Tony retreated to his lab, unable to face his team and what he had done. Both Steve and Rhodey tried talking to him, tried to convince him that everything would be okay. That Peter would forgive him like he’d done so many times before.
“Leave her alone. Please…” Peter sobbed, trembling uncontrollably with his hands fisted in his hair while he curled into a tight ball. It had been a long time since he had seen anything as gruesome as that, even as Spider-Man.
Peter nodded forlornly. “Yeah. It seems like supernatural things are more active in October because people embrace that kind of activity more willingly. But they aren’t all bad,” he paused, running through some of his more positive memories with the undead. Memories of kind, joyful spirits who meant no harm. “Some stick around so that they can check on loved ones or because they simply aren’t ready to move on.”
A mural of blood painted the wall where Crow once stood, coating the wood in a graphic display of red. The man’s body laid off to the side, mutilated beyond recognition.
“Do you see anything else?” Natasha asked from her crouched position behind a wild holly bush. She cocked her gun, “or are we ready to go?”
“That little brat! He got me!” Rose shrieked, her eyes blown wide with fear. The drop in adrenaline, causing her to shake. “I went into his dreams, and he got me! He was in my head!”
Rose continued to scream and cry as the creatures tore her apart, flesh from bone. The hellhound bit into her side, leaving a gaping hole where her lowest ribs were supposed to be and the rake broke her arms. The spirits fed off of her essence, perfectly content to let the cryptids do the dirty work while they took in the emotions that followed.
There was no mystery as to why Peter endured their mentor-mentee relationship. It wasn’t because Tony was a billionaire, an Avenger, and a world-famous inventor. Peter’s tolerance of him came from something much stronger than a need for fame or greed.
“You little brat!” Rose screamed so loudly her voice began to crack; her rage so strong it was nearly visible. “How dare you fight! How dare you attack us!” She looked at the bodies of her fallen cult members, their blood coating a good portion of the floor and walls. “We have existed for centuries. Watched civilizations rise and fall, dismantled entire kingdoms, and had kings bow at our feet. You do not get to take that from me!”
“So, you wanna tell me why every glass surface in the penthouse exploded?” Tony asked as he sat across from Peter at the kitchen island on the communal floor, a fresh cup of coffee in hand. Last night was rough, and if Tony planned on getting to the bottom of this, whatever
Bypassing the broken elevator that had sat unused for nearly three decades, Peter made his way up seven flights of stairs. He stood outside of his apartment door, mentally preparing himself for whatever happened to be behind that cheap pine door. Slowly, Peter breathed in and counted to five before releasing the air in his lungs. If he learned one thing from his meditation sessions with Bruce, it was how to slow his heart rate and lower his cortisol levels effectively.
And had he been more aware, Peter would have heard the light footsteps approaching, smelled the newcomer’s scent, and would have pushed Hamir out of harm’s way the second his spider-sense went off.
“Peter? What...” Tony’s voice shook, void of the usual confidence and snark it almost always held. His strong timbre reduced to a mere squeak.
Justine and his goons moved to the front of the warehouse, cackling to each other like they just heard the funniest joke in the world. There were two dirty, paint-stained tarps hanging from one of the lower rafters in a crude attempt to divide the massive warehouse space into two separate rooms. It didn’t seem as if Justine was concerned about his detainees escaping. He and all of his hired criminals picked up where they left off on their poker game, completely disregarding the injured teenager and enraged billionaire tied up at the opposite end of the building.
“Mr. Stark,” Peter started slowly, the anger he was trying to squash down inside himself moments ago beginning to show through. “you know I couldn’t let him hurt you. He nearly killed you!”
“The guilt and self-loathing is rolling off of you in droves.” Rose peered down at her prisoner, a large smile on her face. When Peter didn’t make any move or sound to acknowledge her, she shook her head and tutted disapprovingly, “now, now. That is no way to treat your betters.”
Tony wanted nothing more than to pull the skinny little hero into a big hug and cuddle together up in his king-sized bed in the penthouse to watch a movie. To tell Peter how much he and the team loved him, how excellent of a hero he was, and that he made the world a safer, brighter place just by existing.
As Tony’s protégé and successor, Peter occasionally attended meetings and even shadowed his mentor on business trips, learning the ropes as Tony often said. And in all honesty, the teen enjoyed every second of it. Even if there were some boring parts, he still loved being with his mentor. And after a particularly slow day, Tony always made sure to take his kid out for ice cream or to grab a sandwich at Mr. Delmar’s sandwich shop.
“No.” There was no hesitation or room for questions. Peter knew, with all of his being, that May didn’t like him. He was a mutant with freaky powers, and on top of that, it was his fault Ben was dead. She had every right to resent him.
“I know how you’re feelin’, runt,” Bucky said, his voice full of understanding and warmth. “You don’t want to hurt anyone, even the villains you face.” He sighed. “But sometimes you don’t have a choice. Either the bad guy dies, or an innocent bystander does. Or, in this case, a teammate. Even if it doesn’t feel like it, you did the right thing. There’s no need to beat yourself up over it.”
More unwanted memories rushed to the forefront of Peter’s mind. Memories of cruel laughter, scalpels cutting into his skin, forcing blood to surface as he fought the urge to scream. His stomach clenching painfully as a constant reminder of how famished he always was and how his powers could be used against him. The punches, kicks, and whips were his only friends, although nothing ripped Peter apart as much as the hateful, dehumanizing words thrown at him by the people he was supposed to call his parents.
Tony’s hold on the teenager tightened exponentially on that last word. The mechanic was beyond confused, but the way Peter was freaking out told him it was something terrible. Very, very bad. “Who was killed?”
“I highly doubt that,” Tony said confidently, sitting up straighter. “The Avengers are the best of the best. They’ll find us, and when they do,” he paused for effect, making eye contact with each kidnapper, “you guys are dead.”
Rose took a step back, so she was just an arm’s length from the rest of the Knot. She ignored the instinctive dread coursing through her veins and spit out a fact she knew to be true. “You, Peter, are afraid of what you can do.”
“What do you need me to do?” Asked Steve. He didn’t know much about computers or technology, so he usually looked to Natasha when it came to situations like these. But he desperately wanted to help; anything he could do to aid in the search of his boyfriend and self-proclaimed son, he would do it.
“Yes,” Steve responded, “we’re coming up on it. Stand by.” He and the rest of the team slowed to a halt just behind the tree line. A large building circled by dead grass stood before them in the otherwise uninhabited wilderness.
“Hey, kiddo.” Steve greeted the teen with a fond smile and a quick side hug. Gently though, so as not to hurt the seemingly fragile child. He couldn’t help but smile when Peter leaned into the hug, his entire body melting against the super-soldier’s side. “Is Nat making her famous Oladushki?” He asked after seeing Natasha standing by the stove, mixing some type of batter.
“I love you, Peter.” Tony said with as much conviction as he could muster. He meant it with all of his heart, and he needed Peter to believe it. “I love you so much. You’re my kid. My son.”
This was a lot for Natasha to process. The prospect of spirits, ghostly entities, and an afterlife wasn’t surprising in the slightest. Dr. Strange often spoke of many different astral planes and about how life does indeed go on after death. What concerned her was the fact that Peter had been dealing with this ability by himself for years.
Natasha continued to run her fingers through her baby spider’s hair, knowing it soothed him. She would do anything to ease his mind and make him feel better. “Whenever you’re ready, I’m here.” She pressed gently, willing to wait all day until Peter felt comfortable enough.
Peter jolted awake with a scream on his lips. The unrivaled power he possessed and his pure, unbridled emotions caused every glass surface on the penthouse floor to shatter. Mirrors, windows, lightbulbs, and any of the like exploded simultaneously.
“Thank you, guys.” Peter hugged both his dads so tightly they both nearly squeaked. “I’ll be right back. Promise.” With one last thank you, Peter headed off towards the little grove of dogwood trees at the edge of the cemetery. Under the ancient trees stood a group of long-since diseased beings that were not ready to move on, friends of Peter that tried to look out for him whenever they could.
Avoiding the actual question; a tactic Tony was familiar with, having used that tactic as a way to avoid questions from Pepper or Fury. “What happens when both you and your aunt are home at the same time?” He chose each word carefully, making sure to cover all of the bases so Peter couldn’t divert his response to anything else.
“It doesn’t fucking matter how old I am! My parents beat me and abused me ever since I was able to walk. They hated me because I was a mutant, and so does May.” The tears he had been trying so hard to hold back finally started falling, streaming down his ashen cheeks like a waterfall. “I’ve never been able to just be a kid! Not ever.”
“Peter, it is Hamir.” The elderly wizard tried again, voice soft. “I am not going to hurt you.” His concern spiked when he took account of all of Peter’s injuries. The boy was nothing but skin and bones, and blood coated various parts of his body. His bones and joints stuck out skeletally, and that, combined with his pale skin, made him look dead.
“Floor eighty-six please, Friday,” Natasha called to the AI once she and Peter entered the private Avengers elevator.
, but he didn’t let Sam’s snarky comment get past him. Just as Sam went to sit down on one of the other bar stools, Peter used a tiny bit of his energy and focus to move it about six inches to the left. Which resulted in a sore rear-end for Sam and a good laugh for everyone else.
It was only three weeks since Peter’s rescue, and none of the Avengers let him out of their sight. All of his wounds were healed within a week, his healing factor taking care of everything. Dr. Cho’s main concern now was how underweight Peter was. But it was something he was working on, slowly but surely. Tony, being a billionaire, had more than enough money to feed Peter’s extremely enhanced metabolism. And Peter was looking forward to not feeling hungry twenty-four-seven.
Tony didn’t appear to be injured, which did wonders to ease Peter’s mind. One of Peter’s biggest fears was that somehow, Tony would get hurt or killed because of him. That Tony would be gone, and he could never get back the man he saw as a father. Even if the Avengers decided to get rid of him, at least they would still be alive; Peter could still watch out for them. But seeing as he was in the Tower’s medical wing with Iron Man beside him, Peter believed it was safe to assume that neither of his fears had come to fruition.
Peter sighed heavily and maneuvered himself to rest the back of his head on Natasha’s shoulder but was still facing the opposite direction. “Yes and no.” He sighed, “today was just… not a good day.”
Reluctantly, Tony released the teen after a few minutes and returned to his hard seat, never releasing his hold on Peter’s hand, their fingers entwined. Peter looked much better than he did five days ago. The nutrients being given through the IV helped to jumpstart his healing factor and rapidly speed up his recovery. He was no longer as pale as the sheets he rested on, his cheeks dusted with a soft-pink hue. Most of his smaller scrapes and bruises were healed entirely, and his more extensive injuries were steadily mending. Keeping his weight up would always be an issue because of his metabolism. His body mass was already way too low due to abuse and being kidnapped. But it was something they could work on. With lots of food, rest, and support, Peter would recover just fine.
A loud bang jolted Peter from his fitful sleep, leaving his heart thudding rapidly against his rib cage. He looked around blearily, his eyes unable to focus on anything through the fog of sleep and pain that consumed his mind. The only things he could be sure of was that the shackles around his wrists tying him to the wall were magically reinforced, meaning he couldn’t break them and that he was in some vacant building.
The killing curse hit Peter head-on. The electric-blue glow of the spell hovered around the teen, dancing around his small form like the Northern Lights in the sky. Still, despite the potency of the curse, Peter stood firm.
“Everyone ready?” Steve asked his teammates once they boarded the quinjet. To which he received a chorus of acknowledgments ranging from the conventional, “yes, sir” to a sarcastic, “aye aye, Captain.”
“They torture people like me and drain the life from us. Our life force allows them to live much longer than any normal human, adding our lifespan to their own.” Peter pulled the sleeves of his gifted MIT sweatshirt down over his hands, something he commonly did whenever he was feeling anxious, which was a lot, honestly. “They’re evil people, Mr. Stark,” he said with as much conviction as he could muster.
“Good,” Bucky said as he approached them, “’cause there’s someone here to see you. Came through one of those sparkly gold portal things.”
Tony groaned, mentally kicking himself for his lack of preparedness. He knew from experience that bad guys often showed up when you least expected it. Hence, the necessity to always be prepared. Of course, that logic had been temporarily lost to him, which is why they were in their current predicament.
And Peter did understand. Hero work was dangerous. And inevitably, people got hurt and sometimes killed. Peter accepted that cruel yet inescapable truth long ago. But that didn’t mean he liked it. The young mutant would always do everything in his power to save people, no matter how bad they may be. Sure, he couldn’t save everyone, but he’d be damned if he didn’t try.
Peter couldn’t help but blush at the praise. “I should be thanking you,” he said, “you warned me that they were coming.”
Once he’d laughed for a good five minutes, Tony calmed down enough to continue with the previous conversation. “You’ve had these powers since when?”
This chapter gets dark. Like, really dark with some gore. Just a heads up. But I’m honestly super happy with how this chapter came out! I’m super proud of it, and I usually attack everything I do, so that’s saying something.
“Mr. Sta-“ Peter’s throat felt so dry, causing his voice to crack. Clearing his throat, he tried once again to get the mechanic’s attention. “Mr. Stark.” He squeezed the larger hand gently, hoping it would help pull the man back into consciousness. “Mr. Stark, are you okay?”
“Is there anything else you want to tell us?” Asked Tony. He knew the teen well enough to know there was something else Peter needed to say. The kid always nibbled on his bottom lip when he tried to put his various thoughts into a coherent sentence or was hesitant to speak.
“The Knot. A group of ancient people who keep themselves alive by feeding off of people like me. People who have psychic powers and or a sixth sense.”
Tony just stood there, confused as to what his son was pointing to. But Steve picked up on the hint easily. “Go talk to your ghost friends. We’ll be in the car with Happy, waiting for you.”
Richard roughly grabbed his son’s arm in an iron grip, eliciting a small whimper from the young mutant. “What have we told you about that?” He snapped, voice hard and void of any emotion.
“Is everything okay?” Peter asked once they had pulled apart. “I haven’t seen you for a while,” he mumbled sadly, allowing Tony to pull him back against his side.
That creeped Natasha out; she couldn’t deny that. The thought of having a ghost, who lived decades ago, know your name, and talk to you was just crazy. Not to mention terrifying. No wonder Peter’s anxiety was reading its ugly head.
Even Ned, MJ, and most of his fellow decathlon teammates were there, offering their own form of moral support. Ned gave his best friend one of the biggest hugs possible, even controlling his inner fanboy when he saw the Avengers. And in MJ’s case, a big hug and a kiss on the cheek accompanied by a soft, “I love you.”
Steve had wanted to check on Peter that morning because he seemed very shaken up the day prior. But after asking Friday of the vigilante’s whereabouts and finding he was talking with Tony and that they had migrated into the lab, Steve decided to approach the teen later in the day so as not to interrupt the genius duo.
“You mind introducing us to your friend here, Pete?” Tony eyed the man suspiciously. Clearly, he was one of Dr. Strange’s wizard friends; if the robes, pendants, and how he magically appeared through a magical portal were anything to go by. He was also missing a hand.
“I’ve come into contact with a bunch of negative spirits before, some of which were vocal or lashed out. But she was just… different.”
“What?” Tony spun around and grabbed Peter’s hand just as he was about to push open the emergency staircase door they had just exited from. “You need medical attention, Peter. You can’t just leave.”
“You were right, though, Pete. I… I hurt you in so many ways, and I never even realized it.” He wiped his face with his sleeve, removing some of the salty tears slipping down his cheeks. Looking away, he murmured, “I really am a shitty mentor, aren’t I?”
Oladushki, otherwise known as Russian pancakes, was one of Peter’s favorite foods, so Natasha tried to make them for him whenever he visited. Seeing Peter eat and his beautiful smile was well worth the effort.
Peter broke the chains holding him in place with a determined shout, just as the light bulbs and window panes shattered, spraying shards of glass everywhere. Ignoring his aching stomach, throbbing cuts, and the despair within his heart, Peter stood tall. His appearance started changing until he looked just as he had during his confrontation with Rose after she invaded his dreams. He looked like a ghost.
“No, no, and no. Thor’s in Asgard, and I am not waiting for him to get here. Even if it only takes him a second with that rainbow bridge thing he uses. Scott is visiting his daughter, and I’m not wasting time picking him up and catching him up to speed. And I don’t think we’ll need T’Challa.” Tony flexed his armored hands. “Besides, Friday could find their locations in seconds. I wouldn’t need you to call anyone.”
Tony could barely make out two people sitting upfront through the metal divider separating the front driver and passenger seat from the back carriage. Presumably, the two people up front were armed just as the other six kidnappers were. Peter and he were going to have to wait for an opening, which, unfortunately, looked pretty sparse at the moment.
Peter looked up from the blood coating his hands and glared. “She was just a little girl. You tortured her.”
Horrible memories of him murdering countless people came to the forefront of Bucky’s mind. Dozens of missions he unwillingly carried out because HYDRA needed him to further their agenda. He had been nothing more than a puppet on strings. After being deprogrammed, he could finally process everything that he had seen and done.
“No,” he murmured, his temples throbbing from the stress of today’s events, “I guess not. I was kinda just hoping none of you would notice.”
There were sure to be hard-times coming with his and his family’s line of work. But the ups and downs, that was a part of life, and nothing he couldn’t handle. And Peter was more than ready to start this new chapter of his life, with his family and dads beside him.
Rose picked up the hatchet, admiring the dark red lines dripping down the metal end and onto the handle, highlighting the wood graining in crimson. The rest of the cult stood in a line behind their leader, equally large smirks on their faces.
“Sorry, kiddo.” She chuckled. “You’ve so effortlessly worked your way into our lives and hearts. We care about you far too much to see you hurting.”
“We’ve already lost Grandpa Flick. We can not afford to make any mistakes.” Billy said in a serious tone. Their time to find this child and drain him was running out. Each passing moment brought them closer and closer to their demise.
What made the whole situation worse was that Peter’s life wasn’t much better now that he lived with his aunt, poverty and emotional tension affecting their every move. New York was expensive, and it was evident that the Parkers were very poor, the teen’s clothing weathered and worn; covered in holes, or poorly stitched up from previous tears. Even his shoes seemed to be more hole than shoe, the soles threatening to fall off with each step.
“With all due respect, Hamir, why are you here now?” Steve asked once the wizard was comfortably seated. He took one of Peter’s small hands and held it against his heart, feeling the pulse beneath the skin of Peter’s thin wrist.
“Don’t worry, маленький паук.” (Baby spider.) Natasha cooed, her arm still firmly locked around the teen’s thin waist. She tried to ignore how easy it was to feel each individual rib through his thick Midtown tech hoodie and how cold his skin felt.
He nodded, relief evident in his voice. “Yeah. May is working some extra shifts, so Mr. Stark said I should stay here.”
Peter’s dark chuckle had the warlock snapping his mouth shut immediately, the fear palpable in the stale air. With a wave of Peter’s hand, the wand Crow used splintered into a hundred pieces. Little particles of light flitted up from the wand’s remains before fading into nothing.
Before he could stop himself, Peter leaned into the touch, relishing in the warmth of Mary’s hand and the physical sign of affection. He knew there would be a punishment waiting for him and that this display of kindness was fake. But Peter couldn’t find it in himself to care because he craved this version of Mary; the kind words and soft touches. A mother. Not the cold scientist he was used to.
But on the other hand, if he explained everything, they would know what to do and how to better defend themselves. They could be prepared. Maybe, Tony could even post suits at MJ’s and Ned’s homes. Just in case.
Peter is unknowingly drawn into the sights of a dangerous organization as his family struggles to find a way to save him.
Bruce’s shoulders visibly slumped, and he couldn’t stop from smiling. “Oh, I’m so glad you two are okay!” He moved forward to hug his fellow scientist but quickly retracted his arms in fear of accidentally hurting the mechanic more than he already was.
Peter extended his left arm towards the wall opposite him and behind Rose. A circular portal opened up, steadily growing until it was approximately ten feet in diameter. It was ink-black in color with varying shades of grey swirling within it. Disjointed whispers, both male and female, young and old, could suddenly be heard.
“Don’t worry about your aunt!” Tony said, apparently much harsher than he meant to when Peter flinched. A little softer, he said, “I can call her and have someone bring her to the Tower. You’re staying here and getting treated. You can talk to May later.”
Natasha’s eyes widened somewhat in a rare display of shock. It was true, not much surprised any of the Avengers nowadays. Aliens, monsters, and villains had become the norm. But ghosts and the undead... that was new. “You- you can see dead people?”
“I had a vision last night,” Peter explained softly, “I’ve had them before… especially when they’re getting too close to me.”
Everyone’s eyes fell on Peter simultaneously, making the teen very uncomfortable. Tony rested a hand on his shoulder and squeezed it reassuringly, “just take your time, bud.” He spoke gently. “No need to rush or any-“
Peter grabbed her wrist again, sending another wave of blistering hot pain shooting up her arm and through her body. “Stop!” She cried, desperately clawing at the hand firmly locked onto her arm. She had never felt this much pain before, and she needed it to stop right now. “Stop it!”
“No,” Bucky shook his head, looking at his old friend sadly, “we’ve got more footage to go through. But so far, we haven’t found anything.”
“That spell won’t work on me.” Peter growled, baring his teeth. There was something oddly satisfying about watching Crow and the others cower before him. He could smell the fear rolling off them, their heartbeats ringing in his ears like a dozen gongs.
But this time was different. Because this time, Peter had purposefully killed someone. And there was nothing the older heroes could do to change that fact. They would move heaven and hell for their little spider, but all they could do now was support him and let him process in his own time. The hope that there wouldn’t be any long-lasting side effects sat tucked away in the back of everyone’s mind.
She waved her hand, dismissively. “Nonsense. You would have figured everything out regardless if I intervened.” Mary looked at the gifted boy in front of her, happy that she got the pleasure of meeting someone so special. “You are a brave young man. I know you will do great things.”
It was as if his lungs just decided to stop working, forcing a choked gasp past his chapped lips. One of his hands held his throat while the other sat firmly against his chest right above his rapidly beating heart. Panic attack, he thought absentmindedly. Each breath physically hurt, and Tony quickly delved into the breathing techniques his therapist taught him decades ago. Slowly, he began to calm down and gain control of his body. Yet, his self-loathing and anguish remained.
“I know.” Steve kept his eyes peeled for a weak spot in the force field or some other type of opening that would allow him and his team inside. But he found none. “I don’t… I can’t find a way in.”
Besides wizards being far more powerful than any member of the Knot, the most significant difference between them was that the Knot set out to hurt others. To bring pain and suffering in order to sustain themselves and their greed. They moved in the shadows. Using the cover of darkness to mask their tracks and cloak their heinous crimes. They were people filled with dastardly means and cruel intentions, not afraid to cut down anyone in their way.
“Petrificus. A simple spell to temporarily freeze anyone in place.” He looked Peter up and down, sizing the teen up. “That spell isn’t strong enough to work on someone like you. But in your weak state, a bewitching spell might.”
This is one of the last “setting up” chapters. There’s some fluff because I’m a sucker for domestic Avengers.
“I really care about you guys too,” Peter mumbled against Tony’s shoulder. Tony’s hugs were the best, and he never passed up a chance to soak up the affection. “So much.”
“No,” Peter whimpered as he tossed and turned in his sleep, tangling his legs in his blanket. He was used to the nightmares that plagued him on a near-daily basis. But this felt different. Not a dream but more of a vision. “Don’t... please stop.”
Peter didn’t know this, but Tony was building a case against May and planned on taking her to court to fight for custody. Pepper had already sent him adoption registration forms, which were on their way to be verified, and the Avengers were putting their various skills to use in obtaining records, documents, and evidence proving that May was unfit to care for a minor. They weren’t ready yet, but they would be soon.
Peter smiled to himself as he made his way back to the cars parked along the road. His parents waiting beside the car as promised, their lips turning up into smiles when they saw Peter returning.
“Now,” May ran her fingers through her nephew’s curls in mock gentleness, “what should I do with you?”
“Right,” Tony knew he was walking a fragile line here, wobbling back and forth along a wire ready to fall.
May was dead; therefore, he no longer had a place to stay. CPS would try to put him in the system, and if he went into foster care, he’d likely have to switch schools and leave his friends. And that was something he would not allow. He would have to mull over his options during his temporary stay in the med bay.
I based Mary Rivers off of Dorothea Puente. She was an American serial killer who killed 15 people but was rumored to have killed many more. Seriously, she was a piece of trash. (There's a really awesome Ghost Adventures episode on her. I highly recommend watching it.) However, Mary Rivers isn't old and is actually a good person.
Silence fell over them once more as Rose’s words hit home, causing dread to writhe around their insides. This was an obstacle they had never encountered before. There was always some level of risk when luring and capturing a viewer. But this… this level of power and capability had been foreign up until this point.
“Here.” Tony held up a plastic cup filled with water for Peter, who drank it greedily. Peter drained the cup quickly and handed it back with a quiet thank you.
“These people are the real deal, aren’t they?” Tony finally asked, his concern evident in his voice. “Like, an Avenger level threat.”
A huge grin broke out on Peter’s face. And, as fast as his battered body would allow, he rushed into his mentor’s arms, basking in the affection offered by the man he saw as a father.
“I think,” Rhodey sighed at being the bearer of bad news, “I think we’re gonna have to wait until whoever put up the force field takes it down.”
Peter, of all people, didn’t deserve to suffer under the weight of being a hero. Not while he had to maintain a three-point seven GPA to keep the scholarship for Midtown, a place where he got bullied and was labeled an outcast. Not when he lived in poverty, struggling to afford basic needs every human being should have without question. Not after having a tragic childhood filled with abuse and medical experimentation.
He spun around to see two young teens walking out of a quaint corner-store cafe. Their hands were entwined, and they laughed as they walked, taking pleasure in the other’s company. As the boy, Peter, stepped closer, another wave of energy hit him.
“But until then,” she walked over to the adjacent wall and pressed her hand flat against it, and released her magic, causing the paint to ripple and peel off the wall. The color fell away to reveal an array of books lining the once empty wall. The book wall resembled that of library bookshelves, each book varying in size, shape, and thickness. “I’m going to search your memories.”
Tony didn’t flinch once. Justin Hammer didn’t scare him; neither did the gun held to his head. He experienced plenty of similar situations in the past and was desensitized to most threats. What truly scared Tony was that Peter would be left alone with this psycho if he was killed. And there was no way Justin would let the teen go. No. Justin would continue to torment Peter, both physically and mentally. And that was a scenario Tony could not allow to happen.
“You don’t need to apologize, Mr. Stark.” Peter smiled tiredly. The cuffs around his thin wrists were much too tight, and he knew that he could break them easily. But Peter didn’t destroy them because he could not give his identity away. These people, whoever they were, didn’t seem to know he was Spider-Man, and Mr. Stark always told him to hide his secret identity no matter what.
This chapter takes place where the first left off. There's some cute momma spider and baby spider fluff so I hope you all enjoy it XD
“Really?” Crow’s eyes widened. The number of viewers in the world seemed to decrease with each passing decade. Even the potency of their powers was becoming more diluted. No one viewer was able to sustain them for more than a few months at a time. “Boy or girl?”
And to be honest, Tony had no clue how he got so lucky to have Peter in his life, bringing him joy and hope. But he’d be damned if he continued to take Peter for granted.
“Rose!” Snakebite Andy was the first to reach the injured woman. Her eyes widened in alarm at the charred skin on Rose’s right forearm. “Your arm!”
“Alright, then.” She tapped her finger against her chin, trying to choose the best way to go about this. Eventually, she decided to start with broad questions, narrowing things down depending on what Peter’s answers were. “Is the month of October hard for you? And or Halloween?”
The first thing Peter registered upon waking up wasn’t the dull pain spreading throughout various parts of his body, not his gurgling stomach that clenched painfully every few seconds, or the fact that he was still chained to the floor in an abandoned warehouse. No. The first thing he discerned was Tony’s pained grunt and the gun pressed against his mentor’s temple.
Justin chuckled. A maniacal, sadistic laugh that shook Tony to his core. He stood up slowly and sauntered over to Peter, who was curled up on his side, attempting to put pressure on his various wounds. “What have we talked about?” Justin screamed, making Peter jump. “Huh?” He kept eye contact with Tony as he dug the tip of his knife into Peter’s thigh, causing the boy to scream.
“I’ve noticed you’re not a big fan of horror movies and creepy or scary stuff in general. Does that have anything to do with your negative feelings towards this month?”
A piercing scream echoed throughout the otherwise unoccupied forest as the surgical tool turned weapon found its mark.
Everyone’s primary concern was Peter’s current mental state. It wasn’t the first time he was kidnapped or tortured or in need of immediate medical attention. Hero work and having the Avengers as your family guaranteed all types of dangerous situations. It wasn’t anything new.
Clint reached across the island to steal some of the parsley sprigs while Peter’s attention was on Natasha, but the teen was too fast and slapped the archer’s hand away. “Ow!”
Natasha kissed Peter’s forehead after wiping it clean of any blood. “Я люблю тебя, дорогая.” (I love you, honey.)
No one moved or spoke for a good five minutes. Each hero was left reeling from the events prior to that moment, unsure how to react.
“Of course, Miss Romanov,” the AI replied in her light Irish lilt, allowing the elevator to ascend. “The rest of the team is in the lounge waiting for you.”
“I must thank you.” Mary Rivers said, a cheeky grin on her face. “Because you destroyed the Knot, I may finally rest in peace.”
Peter stood on the cracked, graffiti-covered sidewalk and watched Happy drive away until the black Audi merged into traffic and became lost in the sea of cars. He waited another few minutes before heading into his apartment building, trying to prolong the too-short moments before he had to confront his aunt.
“So… how are we going to go about this?” Barry looked between Rose and Crow. “We can’t beat this kid.”
She floated above the massive forest that stretched for hundreds of miles in every direction. Lakes, mountains, and fields masked in darkness passed below her. Eventually, suburban towns filled with cookie-cutter homes and bustling cities passed below as she grew closer and closer to her destination. She could feel it. Or rather, him. Her entire body practically vibrating from the pure energy radiating off of the teen she desired.
“Hey, kiddo.” Clint greeted his favorite teenager as he and Tony exited the elevator. He shot the billionaire a harsh glare before turning back to the teen, his smile quickly returning. “You feelin’ better?”
“Of course we do, Pete.” Tony moved around the granite island to sit beside his protégé and pulled him into another hug. Peter’s hair smelled like the green apple shampoo Tony had gotten him, knowing they both liked the scent of it.
The woman, Mary Rivers, was a serial killer when she was alive in the early 1900s. She was charged with murdering twenty people. But everyone believed more victims had yet to be found. She lured her victims into her home then poisoned them, burying their decomposing bodies in her backyard. When police arrived at her house to arrest her, they found Mary’s lifeless corpse hanging from a rope in the front hallway.
“There it is!” Rhodey said into the comms, Ironman and the Falcon flying close behind him. He flew high above the large building that he assumed was an old warehouse. “You copy?”
Warmth bloomed within Peter’s chest, filling him with happiness and joy. Natasha was his mother as far as he was concerned, and her affection was always welcome. The little smile on his lips remained in place as he continued his tale.
After five minutes, Rose began to succumb to her injuries, and her shrieks of agony began to fade. The monsters disappeared back into the portal, grateful for the offering they were provided. The wendigo drug a half-dead Rose behind it as it entered the black swirling door, nodding at Peter as it passed. Rose’s screams came out as muted gurgles due to the blood flooding her throat and blocking her airway. Her blood stained the floor, mixing with the dust and solid to form mud, the heavy scent of iron remained.
“I,” Peter spoke softly, struggling to contain his anger. He pulled the chains attached to his feelings, yanking them back and tucking them deep inside himself where they couldn’t interfere. “I do not owe her a damn thing.” He sent Tony one last harsh glare before rushing out of the room.
“She ignores me most of the time,” Peter answered honestly. “She’s never wanted anything to do with me. So long as I do my schoolwork and keep the apartment clean, she doesn’t care what I do.” He explained. “She doesn’t like mutants and what we can do. Honestly, I… I think I scare her.”
“Do your friends know about your sixth sense?” Peter, despite how easy he was to read, was actually very good at keeping secrets.
“Mhm. Some are. But only if the spirits were mean people in real life. Like, if they were murderers, rapists, or committed some other horrible crime.” Peter explained to the best of his ability. “Sometimes people that have been killed or were… wronged in some way… they stick around because they’re angry or afraid and they want their stories told.”
Without a second thought, she reached for one of the books, not planning on receiving any resistance. The child was asleep, completely oblivious to her sneaking around in his mind. She had dream hopped countless times and knew what she was doing. There was nothing to worry about.
Peter was on the verge of collapsing from a combination of hunger, exhaustion, and the injuries he sustained while under Justin Hammer’s watch. Pure adrenaline and determination were the only things keeping him going right now. The drive to protect his aunt overriding everything else. His tears had lessened by the time he reached his apartment building, while his fear induced anxiety remained. His spider-sense continued going off like crazy, a constant buzzing at the base of his skull sending shivers down his spine.
That unknown dimension is where these monsters, demons, and ghosts come from in my AU. I’m calling it the Unknown.
Not even his parents. The two people who were supposed to love him and take care of him no matter what. The people Peter was supposed to trust but couldn’t; who Peter wished he could rely on but knew he never would.
“You needn’t apologize,” Hamir’s voice was barely audible. It took all of his strength to continue breathing. “Your family is coming.” He held Peter’s shirt in a white knuckle grip. “Remember what I taught you?”
He furrowed his eyebrows and turned back to the cutting board. Voice tight, he said, “I don’t think she really knows enough to have an opinion.”
Peter snaps Justin Hammer’s neck like how Eleven does to the government worker in season one of Stranger Things. And the Knot puts Peter to sleep using a bewitching spell that is used in Harry Potter.
She looked pretty damn mad right now. And Peter knew he was in for a beating by the time this conversation was over.
Peter’s head snapped up at that. Surprise, adoration, and hope sparkled in his beautiful doe eyes all at the same time. “You... you do?” He knew that the Avengers liked him to some extent. Otherwise, they would’ve gotten rid of him already. But it was always lovely to receive a verbal affirmation of the heroes’ feelings.
“I um… I can t-talk to spirits. An-and get rid of them.” He met Tony’s gaze for about three seconds before ducking his head to look at the floor some more, studying the intricate patterns in the wood grain. “I also have, um, Telekinetic powers.”
No more than ten minutes later, all of the Avengers were seated around the fifty-inch flatscreen tv, a random assortment of snacks spread around the heroes watching Atlantis. The movie was a favorite among the team, but no one was paying attention to the screen; their focus set upon their youngest teammate, who was already dozing off.
No matter what Tony said or did, Peter never complained, just went along with whatever was going on, and tried his best to help in any way possible. Like all of the times Tony fell behind on SI paperwork and had to cancel lab days - something he knew Peter thoroughly enjoyed. Instead of getting angry, the kid would nod and say, “that’s okay, Mr. Stark. Would you like some help?” And the kid would stay up with Tony into the wee hours of the morning, on a school night, helping Tony get caught up.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Kid, you fix armor and make high-tech weapons for the Avengers. You fight with us on missions and risk your life patrolling on a daily basis. Not to mention that you help make SI tech and assist me immensely in the lab.” He stuck his hands in his pocket and leaned back against the wall behind him. “You more than deserve to be paid for what you do. Besides, you need the money.”
“Fuck-“ Tony inhaled sharply. He took a few measured breaths, forcing himself to remain calm. Freaking out wouldn’t help Peter. Oh god, Tony thought, they have Peter. This is my fault.
Once they were out of earshot, Tony put all of his attention back on Peter, the kid’s soft groans of pain tearing at his heart, chipping one piece away at a time. “Kid,” he whisper-yelled, “why would you do that? You can get out of here! You can escape!”
After an awkward five minutes in which Tony continued to glare at the wizard, he grudgingly conceded. “Fine,” he mumbled reluctantly, pulling Peter down onto the sofa where Steve was already seated. Tony on the right, Steve on the left, and Peter securely tucked between them. He then gestured for Hamir to sit as well.
“W-what d’you mean?” Peter stammered lamely. He cleared his throat before trying again. “Nothing’s up, MJ?”
Peter couldn’t save her, the realization slamming into him like a punch in the face. “Leave her alone!” He screamed in pure rage, his immense power sending the woman and her companions flying back, far away from the bloody child dying in the dirt.
“Thank you so much, Miss Romanov, Mr. Rogers.” Peter thanked them, slipping back into his old habit of using their last names. He was incredibly grateful for their kindness, and promptly dug in. He was practically starving all of the time due to his enhanced metabolism and only got enough food when he ate at the Tower. Stress, depression, and anxiety often made Peter’s appetite dissipate, but luckily, he wouldn’t have to worry about that for the next couple of days.
“I want you to call Rhodes.” Natasha said once they were in the elevator heading downwards. “Tell him to come here ASAP. We might need him.” She crossed her arms and glared at the elevator buttons panel, watching impatiently as the floor numbers lit up.
It didn’t take Peter long to get through nearly a dozen pancakes, each one drenched in butter, syrup, and strawberries, courtesy of the Black Widow and Captain America himself. But he forced himself to not eat any more in fear that his stomach would rebel against the sudden gift of food, not used to eating that much all at once.
Peter glared at his mentor, “why are you making a big deal out of this?” He tried to sound angry because he was. Tony was pushing a big red button that was not meant to be pushed. But he couldn’t help but feel hurt as well. Stress and malnutrition were wearing him down, and he just wanted someone to hug him and comfort him, not start an argument.
“Kid.” Tony shook his head, smiling fondly. “That’s the fifth time you apologized. And there’s absolutely no reason you should be apologizing.”
A bright light went off, illuminating the room in a yellow glow just as an unseen force hit Peter. He was thrown back against the kitchen cabinets, splintering them upon impact. A debilitating wave of lethargy settled over him, pulling his already exhausted body closer to the darkness of sleep. Peter tried desperately to keep hold of consciousness, but his weakened body gave out.
Peter was young and had yet to leave the basement he called home, but deep down, he knew that parents weren’t supposed to treat their children in the way his parents treated him. Punches and slaps were not acts of affection. Being cut open and prodded with surgical tools was no form of endearment.
“I’m feeling a lot better. Thank you, Mr. Rogers.” Peter replied, not looking away from the herbs he was chopping as a garnish. Whenever he stayed at the Tower, he liked to help Steve, or Bucky and Natasha on occasion, cook dinner. It was something they bonded over, and Peter had learned a lot so far. Peter also loved hearing Steve talk about his life before the war, and all of the stories he had to tell.
Because if he lost someone else, his heart would surely break into a thousand pieces, never to be whole again. Their deaths would only add to the crushing guilt already festering inside him like a disease, threatening to consume him from the inside out. His strength was already diminishing under the massive weight he carried as a hero. Unlike Sisyphus, he continued to struggle with the weight on his back, and he knew it was only a matter of time before he cracked under the pressure.
“Oh, really.” Tony’s snapped. “What kind of guardian lets a kid’s parents abuse them and treat them like some feral beast?”
Billy wasn’t so lucky, his death being everything but painless. Blood steadily flowed from his ears, nose, and eyes. His skull crushed to splinters from the rafter Peter dropped onto him. But that’s not what killed him. With minimal effort, Peter forced Billy’s brain to implode. The destruction of his body’s most crucial feature and the indescribable agony killed him within seconds. Throwing the broken beam on him was just for good measure.
“Hey, MJ?” Peter blurted, wringing his hands in nervous anticipation. He couldn’t help but admire how beautiful MJ looked, the bright sunlight pouring through the windows illuminated her delicate features. “Do you, um… are you busy this weekend?”
Peter didn’t say anything for a while, and Natasha thought the conversation had abruptly ended. She was just about to ask Peter if he wanted her to leave when he spoke up. “Yes. Over the past couple of years, I’ve run into multiple dark entities. As Spider-Man and as a civilian.”
Hamir opened his mouth then hastily snapped it shut. He knew more about Peter’s sixth sense and telekinetic abilities than anyone else did. Peter was the most powerful viewer in existence. It was no wonder that the Knot was so desperate to get their hands on the young vigilante. And sometimes, as much as he hated to admit it, Hamir was afraid of what Peter could do. He did not doubt that the Avengers loved Peter as one of their own, but he was also well aware of the fear that Peter could instill within people when they saw him use his powers. It could be downright terrifying.
“The fix-it bots fixed everything, so I figured I’d come back up to my room.” Peter shrugged even though he knew Tony couldn’t see him. His room was another safe place for him to go when he needed some time to think. “Why are you just standing there?”
Each time someone asked him about his home life, Peter said, “May’s busy and works a lot. She’s rarely ever home, so we don’t interact much.”
“I...” he began hesitantly, eyes downcast, “I will explain to the best of my abilities. My only request is that you keep an open mind and hold nothing against Peter.”
Her plea went ignored. Peter effortlessly yanked Rose to her feet and threw her out the window. “Get out!”
“Good.” She was barely able to conceal how ecstatic and relieved she was to know that Peter would be living at the Tower, albeit temporarily. Peter made everyone happy just by being around them, a ray of sunshine and innocence in their otherwise unstable and melancholy lives. The Avengers loved it when he was around because Peter could bring joy to just about any situation; the nephew, little brother, or son the heroes never knew they needed.
Sam stood up to dust himself off, huffing indignantly and muttering a string of curses. He glared at Peter, but the corners of his mouth were turning upwards. “You little brat. My ass is going to hurt now!”
“Stuff that can be easily fixed. By lunchtime, everything in the penthouse will be good as new. And fixing everything costs like… a couple grand tops. That’s pocket change for me, kiddo.”
They finished their food and decided to take the scenic route back to Stark Tower through Central Park. Despite the chill in the air, both geniuses enjoyed themselves, talking about various projects they had lined up, scientific theories, and anything else that came to mind.
“I think I’ve explained enough for the time being.” Peter snapped, in a rare display of anger. He was not in the mood for this. Not at all. “How ’bout you just drop it.”
Some organizations would do just about anything to get their hands on a powerful mutant like Peter. And Tony didn’t want any HYDRA wannabes to find him.
He quickly shook those thoughts out of his mind. There was absolutely no way he would pull his friends into that mess. They didn’t deserve that.
It didn’t take long for the vigilante to grow on the heroes. Only after a month of knowing him, they were absolutely smitten and understood what Tony had meant when he said the kid was adorable. Peter was empathetic, selfless, a genius, and an extremely powerful mutant who risked his life daily to save people. Now, a year and a half later, after completing dozens of missions, field operations, training exercises, movie nights, and everyday activities accompanied by the vigilante, the Avengers considered Peter a teammate and a family member. They would die for him.
“Because I wanted to check on you, but I didn’t know what to say.” Responded Tony as he sat criss-cross-applesauce on the hard-wood floor, unknowingly mirroring Peter’s exact position.
Peter continued to smile, shaking his head at the pathetic creature before him. None of these people knew the extent of his powers. How he could channel the power of death and control the undead. Death, both a good and bad thing, was a part of him, entwined with the very fabric of his being. Even as Spider-Man, it would be so easy to not hold back. To dish out lethal punches and hits rather than just knock criminals unconscious. But he wouldn’t do that because Spider-Man is a hero. Someone who saves people, not kills them.
Wizards were extremely powerful beings that had a firm grasp of the mystic arts, bending magic and alchemy to their own desires. People of magic was how Thor and other more supernatural beings referred to them. The Avengers were beyond grateful that most of them were benevolent and considered them allies since they shared a common goal; protecting the Earth. Some of them even going so far as to help the Avengers in battle when an Avengers-level threat arrived.
“And give Fury a message. Tell ’im to send some of his SHIELD agents to May Parker’s apartment.” He didn’t fully trust Fury but knew he could rely on him for instances such as this. Situations where the police and government could not get involved. SHIELD had been fully rebuilt after the Project Insight debacle, and Tony knew they would be able to handle this part of the equation.
Natasha ran her delicate fingers through the honey-brown curls tickling her cheek. Everyone loved those adorable curls, never passing up the chance to pet or ruffle them. “I won’t force you to talk about it. But you know it’s only going to hurt more if you keep everything bottled up inside.”
“Let’s go to my lab for a while. Get your mind off things, ’kay?” He chuckled when Peter’s demeanor brightened instantaneously; his plan of cheering up the teen working.
And May… his last living relative. The only other Parker left… was dead. And it was his fault. He had failed to protect her. It seemed that Parker luck would never release its grip on him.
The van they were in was definitely traveling at illegal speeds, the tires screeching around every turn; even the tiniest of bumps roughly jolted everyone inside. There were no windows and the back doors of the van were double bolted.
Peter watched from afar; his concentration focused on keeping the portal to the Unknown open. It took a monumental effort for him to keep the doorway between his reality and theirs open. Opening a portal to the dimension where dark spirits and monsters dwelled wasn’t something Peter had ever wanted to do, and he had no plans on doing so in the future. It drained him of his energy and was beyond dangerous because you could never know who or what would come through that door.
Natasha grinned and powered up the quinjet, the engines humming to life. “Location locked. Let’s go get our boys.”
A small wooden desk stood along the far wall, its scuffed surface covered in highlighted papers, pens of varying colors, and books. The thin spindle-like legs looked as if they’d snap under the weight of the various textbooks piled on top of it. A little woodblock was placed underneath one of the legs, presumably in an attempt to level them and prevent future spills. The chair nearby didn’t match the stained oak desk but was equally warn, its green paint chipping off every time someone touched it. A backpack with a broken strap and fraying edges was thrown haphazardly beside the yard sale antique.
The super spy wasn’t one to fixate on any of the people she fought and killed in the past or present, be it aliens, supervillains, or regular people. Whether the Black Widow’s victims deserved death or not wasn’t her call. And frankly, Natasha didn’t care if they did or not. She did whatever she had to in order to survive, and Natasha had no qualms with that. Protecting her family was more important than sparing the life of a supervillain or criminal.
“Stop, stop, stop!” His volume steadily grew until he was screaming, his voice strong despite the fear resting in the back of his mind. These people were laughing while they tortured her as if killing a child was some type of joke. He began to toss and turn violently as the unknown child’s screams grew weaker and weaker.
