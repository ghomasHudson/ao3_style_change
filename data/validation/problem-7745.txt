“Of course.” Tony answered, taking the bottle of water that was being handed to him. He sat on the sofa in Steve's living room and Steve joined him there as he drank the water. Steve watched him curiously.
"I felt so stupid." Tony sighed. He always wanted alot of kids. He always dreamt he'd marry someone and they'd have a bunch of children together. He didn't want several kids by different men but he couldn't change that now. And besides, his two sons made his life so much better. He wouldn't change anything.
“Happy to hear. Thank you.” He smirked, swallowing the last of his whiskey.
He was wearing pajamas. His favorite navy blue pants and the white long-sleeved shirt that came with it. Tony knew them well. He had bought them for Steve not that long ago.
“Friday! We need an ambulance.”
“Anna?” He called out.
It also seemed Brooklyn’s hair had no intention of getting darker as Harley’s had when he was 3 months old. Brooklyn was special.
“You’re very right, your majesty.” Cassie mentioned. She hugged Torunn and bid Asgard’s Queen goodbye before addressing Torunn. “See you out there.”
“I’m going to see my doctor tomorrow.” Peter began and Wade hummed. “I think I’m going to get the shot.” He’d just have to be consistent with his appointments and they wouldn’t have to worry about pregnancy for a while especially since Peter still had another year left in high school.
“Tony what’s going on?” he worried. It was 2 in the morning. This couldn’t be a regular phone call.
“There were three voices Harley.” He clarified and Harley finally met his hazel eyes, a smirk forming on his lips. “You’ll never guess who the third voice belonged to.”
“Hey Tones. What’s up?” he said it all casual and innocent like he didn’t know what he had done. Steve got closer than he really needed to be and Tony couldn’t just let that slide.
“That didn’t stop Steve,” Sam countered. The light bulb clicked in Bucky’s head. That’s what had Sam on edge. Everyone knew Steve had cheated, that was no secret, but he supposed the revelation that he’d cheated with someone so close to him and Tony – someone they called family was plaguing Sam’s thoughts; making him feel insecure. Making him see something that wasn’t there. He’d never have anything with T’challa. And sure, T’challa had voiced his interest in him in the past but neither had pursued it. He respected himself, his husband, his family too much to ever get involved in such a scandalous affair. He wasn’t Steve.
“You remember last summer when I spent time with Nat’s family in Volgograd?” That was the city in Russia where Nat was born. Surprisingly enough, Nat still had family there.
“Well…” Tony hummed. He could.
“What do you mean?”
“Stephen?” Tony responded in a whisper as well. “I –”
“Oh. I got to know Friday and Karen while I was waiting for you. They’re cool.” Wade announced; he was sitting on Peter’s bed going through the contents of his bedside table.
“For cuddling, eating junk food, maybe a movie.” He explained shyly.
“No. I get it. Harley over stepped. I just don’t think you should be putting all the blame on Harley when they both admitted to it being consensual.”
Next Chapter: Stay With Me - Part 2
“And Wakandians, Bartons, Banners, Wilson-Barnes…” Pepper trailed off. There was always some kind of inevitable drama at Tony’s parties and no matter what she did, she could never prevent it because their very large family was absolutely crazy and according to Tony everyone was family. Everyone.
Thor hadn’t known but he wouldn’t doubt it. Nertha was her mother’s daughter. She liked to do mischievous things. “She will be dealt with accordingly.” He swore, looking to Harley. “But this marriage is happening.” And his eyes were trained on Torunn.
He had to tell Steve before anyone or anything else. How he’d tell Steve though, he still didn’t know.
Today Tony was off from work. He was taking a nap while Amelia and Morgan played together, and Jacob and Harley used Harley’s tablet. Carol and Rhodey had stopped by. It was no question that they’d discussed the whole situation. Carol was so ticked off by it all that she’d almost gone out of her way to find Nat with the intent of hurting her. Pepper and Rhodey who were just as protective of Tony, weren’t as short tempered as Carol, thankfully. She did however get a few hits in on Steve after they had a one and one. Rhodey stopped it right before things escalated out of proportion. Pepper stayed out of it.
“I ran into Rhodey almost 5 hours ago.” He added to make things clear. “Where were you?” That was five hours unaccounted for and Tony blinked up at him, wondering how much Stephen really knew about Hammer’s deeds. But Stephen’s face appeared more concerned than infuriated. He’d heard about the fight and for the next five hours, his boyfriend was unreachable. That warranted some worry.
, she’d be okay with that.
He was left smiling down at his phone because Steve always did that to him. Being with him again, put him on cloud nine. He was so happy. Nothing in the world could ruin that for him, for them.
I would never kill Tony guys 😂 Sorry for scaring some of you.
“How did you find out?” Peter wondered.
And then Carol pursed her lips and spoke. “I like her. A lot.” He had the hunch. It was one thing to think something but to have it confirmed was another.
Steve:
Yikes! I was so scared to post this chapter for so many reasons 😣
“Yeah. Me and Steve Rogers.” He admitted, emptying the contents of the tray into the trash and placing the plates in the sink afterwards.
or whatever it is, they’ll be at your throat again in no time, regardless of Peter’s age.”
“Okay. I’m offended.” He really was. He thought he looked good today, considering the lack of sleep. Morgan couldn’t sleep which meant he couldn’t either.
Torunn’s stomach rumbled at the sight of the food. It smelled wonderful too. Harley set the plate before her and grabbed her a bottle of water from the kitchen counter and a glass of juice from the fridge. She said her thanks and they ate together mostly in silence.
And Tony actually gave it some thought before agreeing. One date wouldn’t hurt.
They found Tony and Anna at the end of a conversation in the nearest sitting room – the one adjacent the dining area. Tony’s back was turned to them and they could see Anna biting her lip nervously before she realized her siblings had entered the room and she put on a poker face. Tony noticed her change in expression and glanced over his shoulder at Morgan and Peter. He got up to greet them.
“Tony, there’s no need to apologize.”
“So…er, I was thinking that we could do some research on the cases first. You can do some research on the laws, if you want?”
Steve made his way deeper into the room, his gaze scanning the crowd. He frowned when he realized that Tony was no where to be found. This
Steve, of course, recognized the voice immediately. He took his bag away from the seat as he glanced up at Tony.
Over the next week, Steve met with Tony, Rhodey, and Natasha a lot to study. Even Bucky came to some of the sessions. Most of the sessions were focused on studying, but Steve found himself actually having, fun, too. They would always eventually get off topic and would talk about random things, like movies, books, what would they do if they were stranded on a deserted island, etc.
“You told me that you had to do the last fight alone. I won’t let you do that again.”
“Thanks.”
Bucky brought the beer bottle to his lips.  The blonde turned around; he took out the tray of bacon and placed it on a mat that was on the counter.
Steve was invited to a Stark Industries' function and now he's having second thoughts about going.
The last piece was of Tony on the battlefield, the gauntlet on his hand, his eyes glassy. Around him, the once vibrant land was gray, destroyed by Thanos’ attack. On the horizon, the sun could be seen just starting to spread its light over the land.
Unfortunately, Steve’s reprieve didn’t last for very long. The waitress came over a few minutes later and took all of their orders, along with their menus. Steve wanted to tell her to cancel his order and leave, but he knew that wasn’t the mature thing to do.
“Are you okay?” Tony asked.
“I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of your Captain America voice.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve blinked; his gaze flicked over to Tony.
“I’m still working on it. It’s taking a bit longer than I thought to finish.”
Steve raised an eyebrow at that. Maybe an hour away from his books wouldn’t be too bad.
“You know that he won’t, Bucky.”
[I didn’t think that you meant that you wanted me to text you right away. –Steve]
“I can’t believe you kept it.”
Thanks so much for reading!
Finally, the class ended. Steve shoved his sketchbook back into his bag and practically ran out of the door. He pulled his phone out of his pocket and glanced at the text.
Steve let out a hoarse chuckle; he sucked in a breath as knives buried their way into his ribs.
Thank you for reading this story! Here is the next chapter. Hope you like it!
This is a shorter chapter - I apologize about that.
The crowd started to yell questions at them, but Steve didn’t care. Oh, no. His attention was on the man next to him, who he had somehow found after all of these years.
A week and a half after that conversation, Steve finished
Once the room was arranged, Steve went into his bedroom to change. He had no idea what to change into, though. Obviously he had to look presentable – he couldn’t wear the sweatpants and t-shirt he was currently wearing – but he had no idea what to wear. Sighing, he looked through his closet, trying to find something that would be comfortable enough to wear while he was drawing, but still look nice on him.
This chapter is shorter...I apologize about that. I promise that some of the next chapters will definitely be longer.
“I’m glad that you do,” Steve replied; he finally looked up at him. Tony smiled softly at him before letting his hand drop from Steve’s shoulder. “Do you want me to put it in a frame?” The blonde took step back, creating some distance between them.
“Yes. That’s why I asked.”
“Doing it here is fine. Perhaps we could do a house tour later, though? I could see your bedroom, then.” He winked at Steve.
Tony shrugged. “Couldn’t sleep. How long have you been up?”
“Then what is it? Can’t stand to look at someone as pretty as me?”
“Clearly. Just is odd. I saved the universe…you’d think she’d be thrilled to see me.”
“You took in the energy of those infinity stones…you are not fine.”
“I remember…,” Tony said; his voice wavered a bit, as if he was unsure of where Steve was going with this.
Natasha began talking about some article that she had read for one of her classes. Apparently she was a first year, too. They all were. Steve listened intently, enjoying hearing each of their views. Steve even participated a bit. It felt nice to participate. Steve was so used to just listening. At one point though, the conversation shifted, and Steve found himself listening more than he was talking. But, he didn’t find it as a bad thing. He enjoyed listening to them talk, especially Tony. The guy had a way of speaking that was just…nice. Steve couldn’t really explain it, but he liked the way he spoke.
“Of course – go ahead.”
A few days after the gala, Steve found out that the construction site had been closed, so he couldn't spend time there to get his mind off of it. If the site had been open, Steve would have spent more time there to try to get his mind off of this. Apparently, it was closed though until they gathered the materials that they needed to start rebuilding. They had ordered some previously to the gala, but those orders had been delayed because the manufactures couldn't get the materials in time for the shipment date. Now, they had no idea when the building of Avengers Headquarters would begin. It could be anywhere from weeks to months.
One day, while Steve was on his lunch break at the site, he somehow started to think about one of the first times Tony and Steve really spent time with one another outside of the Avengers and missions. The activity itself wasn’t very exciting, but for some reason, it meant a lot to him. Maybe it was because before that, he had just viewed Tony as his colleague. Someone that he talked about his suit design and missions with. That day…well, he had started to become his friend, he supposed.
Steve wasn't able to finish his statement because all he could focus on was Tony’s warm, soft lips pressing against his own.
He gave him a quick hug before the brunette left the apartment, leaving Steve to mull over what he had said. He doubted that it would happen, but what if Tony did change his mind? Steve shook the thought out of his head. He wasn’t being realistic. He couldn’t focus on that, anyways. He had to focus on helping rebuild the facility and doing well in his art class – not the ways of Tony Stark’s heart.
He let go of the shovel, which fell to the ground. People cheered and clapped. Tony took a bow, a grin plastered across his face.
In the MCU, the Avengers technically never live together in Avengers Tower. However, in this fic, they briefly lived together for a short time after the battle. Then, they went on their own ways just like they did in the MCU at the end of Avengers.
“Anyways…after you drew that portrait of me, I knew that I wanted to be around you more, so I tried to come up with ways we could see each other.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “I think, at the time, I didn’t realize that I liked you more than just a friend.”
“What? Why?”
Steve couldn’t help but blush a bit at that. He thought that nobody really noticed him.
The waitress nodded and turned to Tony.
“But –,” Steve began, but he got cut off by Bucky.
“Your waitress will be right with you,” she said, placing menus on the table before leaving.
Steve sighed deeply.
Tony looked up and smirked at him. “Wasn’t it?”
Tony rolled his eyes and took another step into his room. “There’s no need to apologize. If I was annoyed, I wouldn’t be here right now. You know that.”
Thank you for reading this! I really appreciate it.
Steve paused and stared at the wall in front of him. Sending it to Tony had never actually occurred to him. He figured the man would just pick it up so it wouldn't get ruined by shipping packaging, but if Steve wanted him to send it to him, he would.
“How’re you doing?”
“Not to me.”
“Okay.”
Tony narrowed his eyes but continued walking along the kitchen island, putting some sausages on his plate before pouring syrup over the pancakes. He served himself some coffee and took a seat at the table. The corner of Steve’s mouth quirked upwards; he had been worried that Tony would eat in his lab, but he supposed that he hadn’t needed to worry about that. Steve served himself and made his way over to the table; he took a seat opposite Tony.
Steve glanced at his textbook one more time before closing it.
Steve blushed. “Yes.”
“No need to thank me-”
“Yes, you did.”
“Tony…it’s our project. The Avengers' project. Besides, you were the one who wielded the gauntlet; this should be your honor.”
Well, that went that plan. Yeah, he could still leave, but that would be rude now.
“Really? I thought that you would want to do this since it’s your project.”
“Sure,” Steve said. It was better than being out in the main area not talking to anyone. Sure, Bucky had said he had just been going for a drink, but he knew Bucky. He probably would up talking to a bunch of people.
“You were never a scout.”
“That’s great.”
Steve padded into the room, stopping a few feet away from Tony’s bed.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Steve,” Tony said, pivoting on his heels to look at the blonde.
[Okay. What time? –Steve]
After the gallery, they stopped at a pizza place before heading to Tony’s place that he had bought when Pepper and him got divorced. The new place was near Avengers Tower. Tony said that he could walk home, but Steve insisted on taking him home. Tony didn’t protest much, luckily. Steve had hailed a cab and told the driver Tony's address.
Steve’s lips parted; he stared at him. No, he couldn’t be serious; he couldn’t actually be
“I suppose you’re right.”
Thanks for your continued support! I really appreciate it.
“What are you doing up?”
Steve stared at him; what kind of question was that? But, Tony wasn't known to ask vague questions. “Someone with shared life experience, I suppose.”
“Yeah?”
So they finally kissed!!!!
Steve ran a hand through his blonde hair.
The coffee shop was one that Steve had discovered a little after the Snap. It was about ten minutes away from his apartment and it was close to a small park. During the five years after the Snap, he had often sat at one of the tables they had set up in the park and drew while he drank his coffee. Other times he would get coffee or tea to go. He had visited the place so much that the people knew his order.
The little dots appeared on the screen; a few seconds later, a message appeared.
I hope that you enjoyed this story.
“What is it?” Tony asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Ready?”
He set his phone on the small table next to him that was littered with colored pencils. Steve moved his chair closer to the easel; he let out a soft sigh when he realized just how much work he still had to do on the portrait. He had managed to complete about a fourth of the drawing so far.
“Yes.” Steve turned around to get a mug that he knew was one of Tony’s favorites. “But I decided to make breakfast instead.” He placed the mug next to the coffee maker. “Pancakes and sausages – your favorite.”
To keep busy, Steve stuck with his daily routine: work out, draw, and go to the facility. These activities weren't the most exciting things to do, but they distracted him from anxiously waiting for Tony to contact him. He also tried to meet with Bucky and Natasha when he could. Since they had officially settled into their apartment, they had more free time. During one of the times that he visited them, he asked them if they wanted to rejoin the Avengers. They said that they wouldn’t mind officially retiring, but they weren’t sure yet. Steve wasn’t sure what he wanted to do about the Avengers yet - if he wanted to rejoin them or not. On one hand, he missed going on missions, but on the other, he had been enjoying the last couple of months. He enjoyed focusing on the things that he wanted to focus on, like art. Also, if not being on the Avengers would make having a relationship easier - whether that be with Tony or someone else.
Right?
Most of the first year of law school was a blur. Steve was too busy getting acclimated to everything to really concentrate on the people who were in his classes or any ‘extracurricular’ activities. It’s not that Steve wasn’t interested in those things, he was just too busy focusing on, well, getting good grades. Law school was competitive, and he didn’t want to ruin his future by focusing too much on ‘fun’ things. Bucky, the one friend who he had made during the first year, made sure that Steve didn’t waste countless hours studying. Whenever Steve was locked up in his apartment for too long, he’d drag him out and they’d do something – like go to a pub or go to the movies. Even when Steve didn’t want to do those things, Bucky made sure that Steve didn’t overwork himself. And, as much as Steve liked to complain about him forcing him to go out, he did appreciate it. He knew that he needed to get out every once in a while.
Tony took a seat on the couch, too, only sitting a few feet away from him. Even though Steve knew that Tony was precisely sitting two feet away from him, he didn’t get why that fact was so important to him. He had sat the same distance away from Bucky before and it had never met anything. So…why was Tony so different?
His name on Tony’s lips brought Steve’s attention back to him.
Steve ordered himself.
“Thanks.”
“I said one of the only good things.”
“Buck, I’m thrilled to see you…I just mean, why aren’t you with Natasha?”
had scheduled just seemed wrong to him.
Steve peered down at the title. “Okay, thanks. I will."
“What?”
“It’s…going,” Steve said.
“Where are we going?” Tony asked. “Not that I don’t like being driven to a random location while being blindfolded. I’d just like to know.”
“Why?”
time, but you’ve been doing it since I’ve been here.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve winced; he hadn’t meant to scream.
“Really? Then why did you tell me? Hm? What were you hoping was going to happen?” His tone was harsh, grating.
Steve nudged Tony’s shoulder with his own. “Come on…let me be a gentleman.”
“Y-yes, it was more than okay, Tony.”
“Not exactly.”
Steve forced himself to shrug his shoulders and go back to reading. Steve tried to read, but the words were meaningless to him. His mind wouldn’t stop replaying Bucky’s words. Tony had texted him. Why? Why did Tony care so much about being friends with him? He was Tony Stark; he could be friends with anyone. Steve was a nobody. But…clearly Tony had some interest in him. Him. Steve Rogers. Still, he couldn’t understand what Tony would find so appealing about him. But still…Tony must’ve found something appealing about him. A small smirk curled Steve’s lips upwards. Tony Stark found him a least a bit interesting. And no matter how scared Steve was about letting Tony learn more about him, he was pleased that Tony at least liked him a tiny bit.
“Him.”
With that, Steve went back to work, determined to try to get this completed by the end of the day. He wasn’t sure if he would, but he’d certainly try.
Thank you for your continued support! Here is the next chapter.
A walk? With…just the two of them? Steve looked at him with wide eyes.
Tony Stark stood a few feet away from him, a smirk upon his lips.
“Don’t worry about it,” Steve said, his tone softening. It really wasn’t that big of a deal, he supposed. Traffic could be unpredictable at times. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to be harsh.”
“I can draw you again if you want…,” Steve murmured.
“I really, really, like it.
“What?”
“Is this the first time you’re having this dream?”
Steve nodded.
“Just checking, old man.”
“If I didn’t, why would I be here?”
“This is Natasha,” he started. He pointed to the boy sitting next to her. “And this is Rhodey.”
Tony looked offended.
“We were, but then Natasha got tired of the music so…,” Tony said.
Tony sighed, but he didn’t say anything else. Steve took his hand in his again and led him to the front doors of his building. When they reached the doors, Steve turned to look at Tony. Steve opened his mouth to say something, but nothing came out. All he could focus on was that he had gone on a date with Tony Stark and it had gone
And Bucky, on the other hand, was taking therapy to deal with his aftershocks after the damage he’d caused as the winter soldier. He was mostly in hiding but Steve and Nat helped him get back out there. Nat was Tony’s friend first; she’d posed as his secretary years before and it turned out she was some sort of spy and they hit it off well and then with Steve.
“Not particularly, Princess.”
“Wife.” He said back, their foreheads touching.
“You seem a bit distracted,” Stephen noticed.
“Together?” Anna gave her a look of genuine confusion. Remy told her nothing was going on there. Strictly business, he had said so vaguely so she really had no clue what was going on there.
When Stephen got home, Tony was sitting up in bed with his phone projecting a screen before him. He was busy moving bits and bobs of a holographic model around. Always working on something. Stephen started undressing and he swore he saw something fly past him.
“You better be or you’re not getting any tonight.” Tony teased; arms now folded over his swollen breasts. Tony was stark naked, and Steve didn’t stop reminding him how glorious he looked.
Harley and Torunn were always busy as well but still found time for each other. Harley focused on S.I. and Torunn started a business of her own in wedding planning with her Uncle Loki. Their business expanded to the realms of Asgard as well where Torunn often travelled for any crucial Asgardian duties on her part.
“I’m really so sorry, Anna. It was crazy of me to even think such a thing.” She explained, pulling Anna into a tight hug.
“You two know babies get older, right?” Steve teased. Wanda rolled her eyes and Vision responded. Of course, they knew. “This is a big responsibility.” Steve lectured. He used to treat Wanda like she was his own when they had first joined the Avengers. Back when her and her brother where playing for the wrong side and discovered they were more than just pawns. They were just kids in Steve’s eyes and Vision was a good person…machine? He was good. Both were young and inexperienced. A baby was no walk in the park.
“I want to congratulate my future in-laws.” Wade began and those words alone rocked the entire room. Steve and Tony glanced over at each other and then to their youngest son. “I asked Peter to marry me.” Wade carried on, making Steve groan as they found Peter amongst the crowd, sure enough, sporting an engagement ring. “He said yes.”
Once inside and the case had been introduced, the judge offered Tony’s lawyer, Lance Tate to speak first. Nova Caffrey may be one of the best, but so was Tate.
“What a bitch.” Carol began, whispering the last word as she remembered the kids before them. “I always sensed there was something off about her.”
“Or maybe she has something to do with Hammer’s death.” Morgan spoke as she recalled a conversation she had had with Anna in the past.
floor where his mom was waiting, no doubt. Tony minimized the screen projected before him from his phone that then disappeared altogether, when he saw Peter and his “friend”. Tony stayed seated while they approached him.
Nertha scoffed at that. “As if they scare me.”
Ned who had been listening the whole time responded. “Yeah. Sure. Later.”
Nat made space for Morgan on the sofa. “What’s up Morgan?”
Peter then pulled off his mask to encourage him to do the same but all he got was Wade, taking one of his gloves off and gingerly holding his face with his uncovered hand. “Gosh, Petey. You’re even more beautiful up close. I could kiss you.”
“Banner doesn’t suit me.” She countered.
“Torunn’s coronation was a success.” And there were plenty of outsiders present. “I wouldn’t worry.” He reminded his wife, beaming at her but Thor seemed to had forgotten that drama always followed the Stark-Rogers family somehow.
Unbeknownst to her, Harley was staring at her figure and admiring her. He knew beauty when he saw it. He was looking at it – her. “Yeah. I can appreciate beauty.” Then he joined her at the balcony. They stared into the night together in silence until she suggested they head to bed.
Tony:
Tony and Steve didn’t understand why Stephen was on his way up to the main floor of
Not long after, Pietro left the group of swooning girls and joined his sister and Vision at their table. Cassie stayed behind with her friends. Wanda got up to hug him as did Vision. They got to catch up, talking about Vis and Wanda’s adoption that was already in progress. They’d met the 8-month-old they wished to adopt and were awaiting the finalization in paperwork. The agency had informed them that things were to hopefully be concluded by the end of March of the following year when the baby would be almost a year old. The couple had already had everything ready and waiting for the toddler.
Peter chewed and swallowed slowly. His eyes brighten and he found Wade staring at him expectantly. “This is good Wade. Like really good.”
and he wanted to do something special for her. She was also in dire need of a distraction. He settled on a small intimate gathering of close family – well as small as he could get given the size of their family. Tony scrapped the theme he had planned for months in advance. It was too loud and large and extravagant. Morgan needed something mellow and chirpy. Something like Easter and that’s what Tony did.
“Love.” He responded, simply, giving Tony a small smile. He was just holding on to the hope that this baby was his. It had to be.
Tony halted his cleaning. He and Stephen were going to tie the knot at some point, but they hadn’t chosen a date yet. Stephen apparently had an epiphany when it came to their relationship, some sort of rude awakening following the Christmas party where he was so close to losing Tony, he didn’t want to wait to get married. Tony, on the other hand, wanted to take things slow. He was still recovering mentally from the incident and needed space. Stephen had done the opposite however and moved into Stark Mansion officially so they could always be together.
Wade stayed quiet. He was a little hurt. Captain America had just told him, he didn’t like him.
“We have a very dysfunctional family,” Morgan noted after a moment. Everyone else at the table knew it but none of them would admit it. Tony smiled sadly at her.
He stresses that he didn’t know they were at the point where they gave each other gifts and apologizes immediately. Wade shrugs it off. “Open it.”
“And if I talk to a guy, you guys want to kill him.” Peter almost shouted. “I know he’s older. I know it looks illegal, but I’ve never done anything with him. Wade’s a good guy.” Tony and Steve wished they could believe that. “And if you guys just gave him a chance and got to know him and trusted me...” Peter trailed off. The room was flooded in silence again.
“No, did you?”
Steve wanted to say that they didn’t all need to be here, but he knew that wouldn’t make them leave.
Steve’s eyebrows furrowed. What was that supposed to mean? Stark Industries had already invested money in the building. They didn't have to invest more money. Even if they didn't meet their goal tonight, he wouldn't want them to invest more money into the building. Before he could get a word in though, Tony spoke.
“The list has arrived,” Tony said, crossing the bedroom to Steve’s desk. He held up the list in one hand.
[So, did you just not take it seriously when I told you to text me?]
“Well, it’s not like you didn’t have any impact on it.”
“We are working together, you know.”
He entered the kitchen and placed the pizza on the counter. “Do you want anything to drink?”
“I missed you too, Steve,” Tony whispered.
“Steve.”
“Fine, I’ll show you them. But…please don’t let anyone else see them, okay?”
“I know, but as I said, I didn’t know that I was into you until a bit after the divorce. I just thought that I wasn’t in love with Pepper anymore. That’s why I mentioned marriage counseling to Pepper. I thought that doing that would help salvage our relationship. Obviously that didn't work out.” Tony took a sip of water and sighed. “Pepper had every right to divorce me…my heart wasn’t in it. I loved Pepper, but my heart wasn't completely in our relationship, like it should have been. That’s partly why I was so upset when I came to your apartment that night. I was angry at myself for letting Pepper down. I was angry at myself for having feelings for you. I was angry at you for telling me that you had feelings for me.”
“Whenever you are.”
“That was related to me, I assume.”
he thought.
Tony let out a short laugh. “You told me that we’d do it together. Battle together.”
For the entire week, all Steve could think about was the fact that Tony and him had a date on Friday. Well. Was it a date? When Tony had said that, he didn’t exactly know if he was being serious or not. Sometimes people said ‘date’ when they didn’t really mean that it was one. Steve, of course, could ask Tony if it was a date, but he was not going to do that. He didn't need Tony to realize that he was truly an idiot quite yet. But, even when he told himself that it probably wasn't a 'date date', his nerves didn't calm down. At all.
Steve lead him through the hall, towards the kitchen. He glanced behind him, at Tony; he couldn’t help but think how Tony was in his apartment. After all of this time, Tony was finally seeing where he lived. It was hard for him to get his mind around it.
“I’ll be right back,” the bartender replied.
“Well…either way, I appreciate it. I’ll take a team with me and we’ll get started.” He gestured to a group of other Stark Industries employees that just arrived. “Follow me.”
“Idiot,” Steve muttered. He carded his hand through his hair. He picked up his phone again and sent another message.
“How about tomorrow afternoon?”
The bartender returned with a glass of whiskey, placing it on a napkin in front of Steve. Steve mumbled his thanks and turned his chair so he could see the room. Still, no sign of Tony.
The car slowed when it reached the red carpet. Steve bit his lip and moved over to Tony, who was now looking out the window.
He took a step closer to him and placed a hand on his shoulder. Steve’s gaze flicked from Tony’s hand to Tony. The man was standing so close, he could smell his cologne. Steve looked down at the floor, worried that if he looked up, he'd do something stupid.
“Tony!” Steve called.
Figure out what he wants? Well, that seemed somewhat cryptic, but Steve didn’t comment on it. He wasn’t going to discuss this anymore. Discussing it wasn’t going to change anything, it wasn’t going to help him any. The only way anything would be different is if Tony realized that he was with the wrong person, which didn’t seem likely. Which, he supposed was okay, as long as Tony was happy.
Surprisingly, no one deterred him from his plan until Tuesday, the day that he received a text message from the person that he had been hoping wouldn’t bother him.
With that, Steve resumed his work, tossing debris to the side while trying to find anything of value to put in the bin that he had been carrying around for hours. So far, only a few pictures of the Avengers were in it.
Since he spent most of his day at the site, he barely answered his phone. He knew that he should, but by the time he got home at night, he was exhausted. He just made time enough to grab a quick bite to eat, shower, and go to bed. The next day, he would do the same thing all over again. On the weekends, Steve would work on the drawing that he had done for Tony.
“What just happened?”
“I’m fine, Nat,” he said.
Tony sighed deeply. “Can you please not be stubborn and just accept my apology? I know that you may not be upset with me about it, but I feel like my behavior wasn’t right, so I want to apologize for that.”
This happens about 2 months before Thanos attacks.
“I appreciate the words of encouragement.”
The answer seemed to evade him for hours, but just as he felt tired enough to finally fall asleep, the answer came to him. The thought made his heart constrict. He may have even let out a slew of curses. Out of all the people he could possibly want to be with…he had to pick the person who was off-limits.
“How about you?”
He changed into the suit and tied a navy blue tie around his neck as quickly as he could. Ten minutes to go. He glanced in the mirror and smoothed out his suit. Satisfied with how he looked, Steve ran out of his bedroom. He grabbed his wallet, phone, and keys on the way out of his apartment. He doubted rushing like this would get him to the event on time, but he had to try.
“How long we have been working and how much more we have to go.”
“What makes you say that I am?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t do that.”
Steve’s breath caught in his throat. No. No. He couldn’t do this. Not after everything. One yard. Once Tony snapped his fingers, he wouldn’t be able to stop the stones from tearing Tony apart. He wasn’t going to get there in time. He wasn’t going to be able to save him. He’d let Tony down, once again.
Over the last week, Steve had found himself at the gym every day. It gave him something to do, something to get his frustration and confusion out on. It was odd, being back at the gym. After the Snap, he didn’t bother with the gym. He went running or did work outs at home. He wasn’t sure why he hadn’t visited a gym during that time, but he didn’t. He grunted as his fist made contact with the bag again.
“Of course.” Steve’s eyebrows furrowed at that. “That whole…incident happened.” Tony waved his fork around.
In the past, Steve had gone to a few of Tony’s events that he held for Stark Industries, but the last one he had attended was ages ago and all of the other Avengers were invited to it, too. Tony had never actually outright asked him if he wanted to go, either. It had always been brought up over dinner or when all of them were hanging out. This was definitely different, which is why Steve just stared at him, at a complete loss for words.
Well, Steve certainly hoped that this walk wouldn’t be unpleasant. He didn’t think it would be, though. Nothing with Tony seemed to be unpleasant. Tony had a tendency to make simple things – such as working on a presentation – enjoyable. Maybe it was his company; it seemed to have a calming effect on him, even if he was nervous most of the time he was around the other man.
About an hour later, Steve leaned back in his chair and put his pencil down. He looked at the drawing in front of him and smiled. He still had a lot of work to do – he still had to shade it – but it looked...good. The Tony that was on the paper looked almost exactly like the one who was sitting front of him. The one who was currently taking a sip of water.
His thoughts were cut off by the sudden press of soft lips against his. Steve didn’t know what to do at first, too shocked by what was happening. Within a few seconds, though, Steve kissed the Tony back. His heart beat rapidly in his chest.
“Do you want to see it?”
“You know, when I was on the run…I thought I’d never be back here again,” Steve said. Why he was saying this, he had no idea. He just had to say something, and this was something that he had wanted to tell him for a while now. Steve rubbed his neck. “I…wanted to come back here, but when you didn’t call after a year, I figured that I wouldn’t be seeing this place again.” That I wouldn’t be seeing you again.
Good point.
Steve furrowed his eyebrows; this was definitely not what he had been expecting. He shook his head.
“See you around,” Steve said.
(See the end of the chapter for
He walked a bit further into the room, leading Tony to the center of it. The walls were white, marked only by paintings or other art pieces. Some people stood in front of the paintings, but thankfully, the gallery wasn’t too full yet.
“Steve, it’s your turn to give the closing speech.”
“Fine. I’ll go.”
“What is it?” Tony asked, glancing up at him.
Natasha nodded and gestured for him to go. Steve made his way to the other side of the room, where Happy was standing at the podium, instructing their guests to find their seats. Steve stood next to Happy and looked at the crowd. There were so many people; he swallowed thickly.
“But he’s there?” He wanted to know.
“How old are we talking?” Tony wanted to know because
Sam reached out to kiss Bucky when he found him in the kitchen, but he retreated. Before he could ask what was wrong, Bucky let him know.
I know. There are errors somewhere but! How'd I do?
Peggy’s son and daughter were already in the room sitting by her side. She was still unconscious for the most part. They got up to greet Tony and Maria before passing along what the doctor had told them. She was going to be okay. She was very lucky.
Tony reached down to touch himself and Steve swatted his hand away. “No touching.” He reprimanded. Instead Steve used his thumb to rub his clit in rapid circles.
James Romanov, Morgan thought, typing it out before changing the Instagram handle to
“Still pining after Tony, huh?” of course he would answer a question with a question. “I don’t blame you though.” Stephen teased, raising his glass to his lips again. “Just don’t see how you could cheat on Tony Stark and ruin everything.”
Tony needed to find Steve.
“No. We’re together.” Steve showed him the rings on his ring finger as he met his eyes for the first time. Tony looked upset.
“Morgan got pregnant and you guys didn’t even bat an eyelash.” Peter complained. Morgan felt uncomfortable. “Harley was sleeping with any and every one at my age and you two didn’t do a thing about it.” Harley thought about defending his past behaviour but decided against it. He let Peter speak. “I’m literally the only virgin left in this family.” Peter reminded them. The rest of his family listened intently.
Stephen heard and was about to respond when Tony re-emerged from the kitchen, plate and glass in hand. Tony helped share Stephen’s plate and Tony was grateful when a voice was heard over the clinking of utensils against plates. It was his mother.
“Steve.” Bruce explained. Apparently, Steve had taken it upon himself to let everyone know that he was seeing Stephen.
“Oh yeah.” Tony confirmed. “It’s too late to fix you two.”
Sam respected his decisions. He grabbed a few of his stuff and left. Winter couldn’t understand why her father was leaving their home. Bucky promised to explain to her later. He stayed at a hotel that night, regretting doing the one thing that got him kicked out of his home, had put his family in a bad place and wounded his marriage with Bucky.
“Am I attracted to the father of my child?” Pepper repeated. She laughed. She’d been by herself for so long. Maybe she was confusing her need for companionship with a attraction for Remy. Yeah, she was going to go with that. “I wouldn’t take it that far, but I do respect him.” Tony sighed in relief. He didn’t want any more drama. He was already dealing with carrying another man’s child.
“I am. What’s it to you?” Anna shot back.
He held onto Steve’s chin and gently caressed his smooth, beardless jawline. “I miss the beard.” Steve grinned at him and Tony went in for a proper kiss, leaning forward to press his lips against Steve’s and slipping his tongue in.
“Dr Stephen Strange,” he corrected.
Few months later and the Wilson-Barnes welcomed two beautiful babies;
“Wow. Okay but maybe later. You don’t want to be late for school.” Tony stood up. Peter followed suit and Tony practically shoved him out his room because Steve’s cum was running down his leg and it was making him uncomfortable. “Love you honey.” He finished.
Steve didn’t bother arguing. Strange was right. He pulled up a chair to sit on the other side of Tony. All they could do was wait and hope Tony would wake up. And Steve hoped that was soon because he didn’t know what he would do if Tony was lost to the world forever.
The judge eyes Tate suspiciously but agrees. This court hearing is for the custody of a baby. She addresses Pepper's claims first. “Miss Potts. That’s quite an allegation.”  Judge Brooks turns to Nova next. “You have proof of this, Miss Caffrey?”
And thanks for reading! 💛💙❤
A dazzling light eventually flashed across the sky and before long her father, mother, aunt Hela and Valkyrie appeared in the middle of the lawn. They were dressed in full Asgardian drapes and armor. Torunn longed to dress in full Asgardian fashion again. The little bits and pieces she added to her everyday wear was never enough making her sword, the closest thing she had to home.
“I went down to the lab. Thought you might be there.”
He managed to injure Steve far more than Nat because he drew even closer when Tony had fallen to the floor on his knees, screaming and howling. “If you didn’t want me anymore all you had to do was tell me.”
Remy LeBeau made certain she didn’t see it.
. That was weird to say, she thought. He was seated at his dorm room’s desk, shirtless and a messy head of dirty blonde hair. He wore a smile on his lips and in his eyes but Torunn could tell there was something else hidden in his eyes. Worry and sadness.
That last statement didn't sit right with Steve. Peter's father had left too, on his own.
“I do not wish for Harley to know my feelings for him.” She paused. Loki motioned for her to proceed. “I believe he is incapable of love or having feelings for anyone.”
“And we’re afraid – I’m afraid of any of you ending up in that type of predicament.” Tony spoke up as he focused solely on Peter. Peter was starting to feel guilty for still seeing Wade behind their backs, but Wade wasn’t like Peggy. He would never take advantage of him; Wade was different, and Wade happened to love him. Peter’s cheeks burned with embarrassment.
They made eye contact when she spoke again. “You’re pregnant.” She stated.
“That can’t be a coincidence.” Harley chimed in. He knew he wasn’t crazy for thinking Anna was up to something.
They both leaned closer, Peter raising his hand to remove the mask and Wade stopped him as soon as he started pulling at it. It snapped Peter out of whatever trance he was in with the realization of what he was seconds away from doing dawning on him. He was going to let Wade kiss him.
Tony and Bucky were the only two people Steve had ever shared this with. After he got injected with the Super Soldier Serum, Peggy Carter took advantage of him. She was evil and manipulative. She hadn’t taken a proper look at him until he stepped out of the pod, his muscles all newly defined and on full display. She couldn’t resist touching him and very soon she was using him to fulfil her sexual desires and Steve had no say in it. He was supposed to listen to her; do as she said. He didn’t have a say in it but then he met Tony and he didn’t want to be a part of that anymore.
SPOILER ALERT!!! If for some reason you haven't read chapter 12 yet. Otherwise, Enjoy!
I will try to upload sooner 💕
“Us.” Peter informed him. Tony rolled their eyes and Maria joined in on the laughter her grandchildren were sharing.
“She has this great potential. She's so powerful and because I enjoy hurting people.” He stated, honestly. If she wanted to pry, he’d show her his worst because Amelia wasn’t a child anymore. She would decide on her own if she wanted him in her life and there was nothing Pepper Potts could do about it. “I kill for sport.” He went on. “Dare I say, I get high off the feeling and I know Amelia would enjoy it too but she's just
“What about the baby?” Steve wondered. Tony squeezed Steve’s hand in frustration.
“Think about it Pepper. Who else could it possibly be?” And Pepper started to consider it until she saw Carol pour herself another glass and, nearly missed the glass.
“Great.” Anna added, with a sigh of relief. “I do not need my inheritance splitting up any further than it already has.” Anna snarked, which made the room laugh but she was in fact, very serious.
The event was magically really and so touching with each speech their friends and family made about them and their unbreakable love, how nothing could ever really keep them apart. Tony was having another cupcake - his latest guilty pleasure, when Wade Wilson got on the mic and he heard Steve sigh beside him. It made Tony wonder if his
“Why would you two think that?” Tony wondered, his eyes darting from Harley to Morgan respectively.
He was greeted with a floral arrangement of flourishing plants and flowers, wrapped around out door seats and in those seats were members of his extended family, all smiling back at him over their shoulders. They separated in the middle, forming an aisle and down that rose petal scattered aisle was Steve standing before an arch - a wedding arch. He grinned back at Tony, beckoning him forward.
Steve wanted to hold him in his arms and tell him everything was okay like he used to when he had episodes of PTSD and he wanted to apologize for all the pain he caused him. He had stayed with him and tried to move pass it but of course him staying in contact with her didn’t help the situation. Tony thought he was still cheating and after 9 years, he caught Steve in a moment with Sharon Carter. Steve explained nothing had happened but it was too much for Tony to handle. They became on and off for the next few years for the sake of their kids. But Tony got fed up with the situation and ending up filing for divorce for the sake of his own sanity. Steve signed, unwillingly and it was just finalized a year ago after 3 years of processing.
And after 18 excruciating hours of labor in the hospital, they welcomed a beautiful healthy baby boy. He was the spitting image of Tony; dark hair but with Steve's blue eyes.
He then thanked Jacob for helping him calm down and his best friend’s relationship or lack thereof with Amelia came to mind. “How are you, man?”
Bucky was fresh out of the shower when Sam entered their bedroom. He had taken Winter to school. Bucky was always paranoid for her safety and though they were lenient with other aspects of their daughter’s life, they wouldn’t let her ride the school bus.
she thought.
“Yes. Twins.” Steve explained, proudly. “Sam’s and Bucky’s.” he finished, adjusting Nicky on his hip. He was really heavy now and harder for him to carry as he got further along.
“It doesn’t matter to me.” He lied. It did. It meant everything and he’d be crushed if the baby wasn’t his. But this was Tony’s choice to make. Tony’s decision. Tony’s body.
“But you never fully moved on. Even after years of marriage with someone else and having someone else’s child. You just couldn't let it go."
“Good.” He stated. “Call Pepper please.” Tony requested. He gathered himself and spoke with Pepper as he got his and the kids’ stuff together. He couldn’t stay in his home, at least not tonight.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m on the pill.” She said plainly. Peter nodded. He’d never thought about getting on the pill. It would be a good idea though since he and Wade wanted to go condom-less for their first time. They wouldn’t have to worry about pregnancy so much. It would limit the chances by a lot.
Torunn led him up to the highest tower in the palace. At the very top, one had the perfect view of Asgard in its entirety. “This is my favourite place in the entire palace.” Torunn explained, leaning over the balcony slightly. “Is it not magnificent?” She got no responses from Harley. “Surely even you must be able to acknowledge true beauty when you see it.”
“No. I couldn’t let u leave after you came all this way,” Stephen did live far away. “Looking so good,” Tony was nibbling on his bottom lip as he reached a hand into Stephen’s unbuttoned shirt.
“I don’t think I can forgive Dad and Aunt Nat for hurting you Mom.” Peter chimed in. Tony broke eye contact with Morgan to face him.
Stephen took in Tony’s appearance as best he could. He was seated at the side of his bed. His eyes were having a hard time focusing and he felt the room spinning. To him, Tony looked as if he had been crying. “Were you crying?” His pained expression softened, dissolving into confusion.
Peter stood as well; he and Morgan then looked over the document. Morgan had flipped the screen and zoomed in so they could see more clearly. That was definitely Natasha Romanov’s gun. It said as much, all detailed in a SHIELD report dated only two days ago. This discovery still didn’t actually place her at the scene of the crime, but all signs and evidence were pointing to her and Remy LeBeau.
“You’ll be the death of me.” Steve confessed when he could form words again. He pulled his soften cock slowly out of Tony. He saw him wince and his hole was red and puffy still gaping for something to hold onto and Steve’s cum leaking out of him.
“Gambit.” They knew each other. They’d crossed paths before at Xavier’s school.
Rhodey stared at her for a long time before she disappeared into the bathroom again. She was lying. He knew she was. There was more to it than what she was letting on. He pulled himself up to the side of the bed and thought it over for a minute. He called out to her when a thought came to him and she came waltzing out of the bathroom, her top now gone. She met his gaze and Rhodey saw something in those green eyes of hers that he hadn't seen in years. “It’s more than that, isn’t it?”
“Hey. What are you doing here?”
Steve had assisted a nurse in dressing Tony’s wounds while at the hospital. Once he’d been all patched up and Sharon had woken, Steve let her have a piece of his mind. He felt so used and humiliated. Afterwards, he’d taken Tony back to his home so they could finally be alone and talk. There was so much to discuss.
Harley was woken to the sound of a spoon hitting the insides of a cup. The room was still very dark, and he could barely make out Torunn’s figure. She seemed to be stirring a cup of tea, he assumed. He sat up so he could see her better. Before he could get a word in, she let him know what she was making. “Moon-tea. Far more superior than any earthly contraceptive.”
Tony tensed but responded coolly given he wasn’t facing him. “Again Stephen. None of your business.” He then paid for his stuff quickly and headed to the exit.
“It’s just Stark, Wade.” Not legally, Tony might add but that was a discussion for another time. Wade apologized not meeting Tony’s eyes. “Peter’s dad wants to meet you.”
“I wouldn’t go that far.” Nat tried.
. Hammer was gone, after all and no one was in immediate danger it seemed at the time, so he was over it as much as Tony and Steve were.
Wade didn’t want to have sex with Peter. Peter was sure of it and he couldn’t understand why. They loved each other. They’d talked about being intimate with each other – going all the way, many times before but when Peter became legal at 17, Wade still denied him. He had said he’d never been with another guy before and it was all new to him. He had said he needed time to be ready for it, but Peter figured a few months would be more than enough. In fact, Peter was turning 18 in three months. He thought they’d be ready by now.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I just didn’t think he would disappear like this. I thought…” and he took a deep breath to prevent himself from crying. He was subconsciously playing with his necklace again before he let it fall back into his shirt. Michelle gave him a moment. Peter threw on a smile and tried to perk himself up. “You were talking about Calvin. Which I guess means you’re finally over Amelia.”
Then Bucky showed up, asking out loud, who had been at the door only to find his husband standing at the doorway. T’challa decided to take his leave. “I’ll be going. Take care, James.” He said and Bucky let the King hug him. “Greet your daughter for me as well.” He added as he left and patted Sam’s shoulder in the process. Sam said his goodbyes as well.
Harley rolled his eyes. “Grandma, could I get a moment with Wade?” It didn’t take more than a few seconds for Maria Stark to leave the room and Harley, stepped into protective big brother mood.
I apologize for errors in advance. Lo siento.
This year, Tony took his mother and children out for breakfast. He received gifts from his four and Steve, and he sent a few out to the mothers he knew and his own mother, of course. And it was enough. After breakfast, he spent the day just being with his family until everyone had to do their own things. All, except for Steve.
“That’s not strange at all.” Wade remarked. “I can tell you’re very protective of your mom.”
“You’re so good Steve.” Tony remarked. It was breath-taking how accurate it was. Steve’s arms came wrapping around him, settling on his bump and his chin hooked in the sink of his shoulder.
she thought. “Does it matter?” she asked. Anna had heard it from Morgan. She was close with her older sister; they shared many things with each other.
Wade wanted to make things up to Peter for his absence during the past few months. He asked Peter to come over to his place so they could have a ‘date’. It was the least he could do since they couldn’t spend time together out in public. Peter informed Tony that he was just going out patrolling for the night and since his revelation, his mother had been really understanding. Peter initially thought, Tony would be super overprotective, overbearing and prevent him from doing what he loved and was good at. It was the opposite and Peter was relieved he didn’t have to lie about that anymore, even though he was hiding his relationship with Wade. Now, Tony would just hug him before he went out and asked him to be safe and to call him if he was ever in any trouble he couldn’t manage on his own. He told his son, he’d dust off any of his suits in a heartbeat if he ever needed help.
“An accident.” Lila suggested but Torunn wasn’t stupid. She then adjusted her crown herself and touched up her make up.
“Hey Mom. What’s going on?” She glanced back at Anna and then her mother again.
“You guys worked things out then?” That’s the only assumption Pepper could make. They’d somehow worked past the issue and things were amicable to say the least.
“Maybe.” Morgan agreed but she didn’t want that to be true. She wanted her parents back together but then she realized, “I’ve never really asked what my mom wanted.”
Note: Mentioned that Peggy took advantage of Steve (Ch13, 4th paragraph)
he was making his husband feel. He would have taken things a little further too if their daughter hadn’t joined them in the living room
“You just happened to take a sudden interest in tech?” Harley bombarded her with questions. Anna could sense that he was trying to insinuate something.
“I forgot.” She murmured. He told her it was okay and that she should open the box. There was an adorable little black kitten inside. Tears weld up in her eyes again. “I love her and you. I love you. Thank you.”
Their appointment with Kayla was coming up soon and they’d have their definite answer, and Steve was hoping faith would be on his side because he still believed Tony was in fact carrying his baby. And if he wasn’t, he hoped Tony wouldn’t hesitate to get the abortion without him even asking. He couldn’t raise Stephen Strange’s child. He couldn’t.
turning 45 in May.
“I won’t hold back.” Amelia smirked, extinguishing the flame.
and with Remy, afterwards.
“Nicky is happy with me and Tony. We’re a family.” The kid explains and Steve can’t stop himself from smacking him across the face. The kid uses a hand to cover the area and he’s left in shock.
Pepper got quiet again, thinking things over. There he was, trying to manipulate her, praising her parenting, trying to get under her skin but she wasn’t easily fooled. “I think you give yourself far more credit than what is due.”
around his home when he had a fully functioning and immaculate AI running his household. He only hired help at this time of the year to aid in getting his guests settled in and to cater his event. The crowned princess of Asgard was patiently waiting to greet her Asgardian family. Holidays were the only times of the year, she got to see her immediate family in person and Christmas was when they came to her.
“What babies?” Tony wondered, his eyes darting back and forth at his 3 children as Friday’s voice in his ear announced Steve’s arrival.
“Aquarium?” she suggested. “I want to see the dolphins. Then we can watch a movie at home later?”
Nat watched the scene unfold. Steve tried once again to explain it all to Tony. “Please Tony. Let me explain.”
“And you shot him with an arrow.” She turned back to her father.
“You’re lying,” he added, getting up so they were face to face.
“Okay.” And Sam pressed his lips onto his. His hands found Bucky’s chocolate locks and Bucky held him close at the waist. “Winter is at the Lang’s. Playdate with Christie.” Bucky mumbled.
“So you’re some kind of superhero?” the guy, Deadpool inquired, circling Peter at this point like a shark.
Steve mimicked his tone. “Strange.”
So thank you Stony fans for sticking around for 24 chapters (of IronStrange) 😘 I'm so glad that's over and done with. The future is looking bright for Steve and Tony 💛💙❤
“Just thinking about my kids,” Tony lied. Because what was he going to say, ‘
“Missed you too Harls.” His fiancée admitted.
“Never.” He whispered, allowing Tony to nibble on his ear while a hand slipped between his legs and began working on Steve’s member. “There’s something different about you.” He breathed out as Tony disappeared under the covers to suck Steve off to completion. He grunted out his next words. “You feel different.”
“Hold on a sec.” Steve interrupted, holding a hand up. “What are you guys talking about?”
Peter knew the obvious answer, but he wasn’t going to say it. Instead, Wade did. “Probably sex.” He said, proudly like he’s just answered the million-dollar question and got it right.
(See the end of the chapter for
Then he asked himself, why he hadn’t gotten the abortion yet so he could avoid this altogether and get back to his normal life? He was a little scared and so confused. He needed Steve for reassurance, who was very much awake and sitting on the ottoman before their bed when he re-entered their bedroom. Tony noticed he was wearing a robe now, same as him, to conceal his nakedness after their multiple sessions of love making the night prior. Steve beckoned him over as he parted his legs a bit and welcomed Tony’s presence there.
of July celebration/birthday considering where he stood with his kids. Peter and Harley had stopped by to give him a gift and celebrate with him. Harley had wanted to know if he and Nat were a thing and he set the record straight. There never was a thing to begin with. Just a mistake. Morgan, however, was actively avoiding him. That wasn’t sitting well with Steve.
“That’s not what I’m saying Stephen.”
Peter took Wade’s hands in his. He was silent for a while and Wade was starting to regret what he’d said. Then Peter released his hands and wrapped his arms around Wade’s waist. “I love you too.” He whispered and Wade embraced him.
but the people of Asgard would never forget. Thor read his expression and let Loki know that Torunn was his heir and always would be, no matter what the people thought. She was his first born. And unbeknownst to the people of Asgard but Sif and Hela, Thor asked of them to ensure Torunn was crowned Queen after he had passed. His word would be law, even after his death.
Tony could sense the worry in just those two words and had to assure him all was well. Steve Rogers really was such a worrier.
Steve pulled out the mini whiteboard and marker Sam had bought so he could communicate while his neck healed. Sam had ventured to the kitchen, trying to put together something blend-able for Steve to eat. Bucky waited on him to finish writing.
Next Chapter:
“This is crazy.” Hope exclaimed. “I hope they find them soon because Tony and Steve have been through enough.” They really couldn’t catch a break.
Then Stephen
Morgan, Torunn and Peter had just gotten home from school. Morgan and Torunn disappeared to their rooms and Peter lingered in the kitchen. He unconsciously twisted the “W” on his necklace while rummaging around the kitchen to find a bite to eat.
Dinner was good. The atmosphere was so cheerful and positive. Conversations flowed freely and easily, and no one was going at it with each other. Everything said and done was genuine. Morgan didn’t know the last time she had a family dinner in her home that was this positive. There weren’t fights. No one was ever at another person’s throat with a knife – so to speak – but it could never be this passive at the Stark Mansion.
It took some time, as expected, for him to wrap his head around everything. He inevitably resented Natasha Romanov and for a time, his parents Tanya and Misha.
“I thought your Dad was dating that blonde lady. Sarah? Shannon?” Amelia questioned, trying to recall her name.
left his mind.
“No mission today?”
really was. She had to remind herself to keep on track and not let Anna sway her thoughts.
Tony uncovered the location of Hammer’s home. He and Rhodey were sneaking into the building dressed in full suits of armour. The place was dark and dingy, but their suits enabled them to see around. Friday scanned the area for any signs of life. The moment she detected life, a large stand of light filled the entire room and a voice was heard from a series of speakers bordering the perimeter.
Winter was a happy child and Steve remembered clearly the day she was born. He found it a bit strange that they had named her Winter, knowing what Bucky had gone through in becoming the Winter Soldier. But Bucky explained that he couldn’t change the past. It was what made him, him as unfortunate as that was. He’d learned to forgive himself and move on from the darkness that came with the memory and wanted to give the word a new meaning. And what better way was there than to give the name to his and Sam’s miracle? Now every time he said the name Winter, he thought of their daughter. Steve thought it was kind of poetic after all was said and done. Sam actually cried more than he did during the birth.
It was close to the truth but still a lie – a lie Steve didn’t have to tell Morgan and Peter and eventually Harley, but he did anyways. He’d watch them squirm a little longer. He knew they weren’t actually over it. They did want to keep that secret between the parties involved though, like so many others that Steve and Tony had buried but secrets always had a way of coming out.
Cassie broke the silence that followed. “That was a little unexpected and forward even for me guys.” She resonated with such affairs because she was openly bisexual as well.
And for a second it looks like Tony might give in. He’s always wanted a boy. He loved Morgan so much but a boy would be so different.  He wanted a boy. He really did.
“Bye Winter,” Steve responded while sitting at the kitchen island. “Gosh. She’s gotten so big.”
“Did Uncle Tony burn his cooking again?” She questioned, already knowing the answer.
“Yes.” Torunn said as if it wasn’t obvious. “Where else would I be referring to?” Harley shook his head. He was thinking about it too hard and Torunn became aware of it. “You must attend. It will give me the chance to show you what a good party looks like.” She gestured to the room in its entirety as she spoke.
The guesthouse was left mostly bare per his and Torunn’s request, with only the essentials in it. The couple wanted to decorate themselves so that every aspect of their home reflected their personalities. Tony respected that. He was just excited to have another child of his, closer to him.
“I never stopped.” Wade explained and he realized something in that moment while his eyes stayed fixed on Peter’s. He was falling for Peter. He was falling so deeply in love with Peter.
“Anything.”
“No more secrets.” Tony confirmed. He was just going to put everything out there from now on.
“Do you wish to discuss your mother?”
“There you go Pep. Remy LeBeau is the problem.” Carol said in a “ah-ha” voice. Pepper knew for a fact that her best friend was tipsy. “I have to be honest, I’ve always gotten a bad vibe from him. You should speak with Amelia one and one and him.”
“Yeah.” She responded, glancing back down on the sketch before her and back at him when she heard Harley groan. “You okay?”
“Steve.” He breathed. “I need you to fuck me like right now.” He didn’t like when Steve was too in control of the situation. He tended to get a big head. Pun intended. So Tony let go of him and leaned back on the counter, using his arms as support and spread his legs further so he could fit between his legs. Steve withdrew his curled fingers from Tony’s hole and stood back on his feet in an instant. Tony noticed Steve still had his pants on. He undid the buckle and dragged his pants and underpants in one go as far down as he could given this awkward position.
They got Tony ready for surgery, placing an oxygen mask over his nose and mouth. Stephen’s team worked fast to get the bullet out, but Tony was left unconscious after the operation. Stephen informed everyone that was to be expected since Tony had lost so much blood.
Bucky and Sam sat Steve on the sofa in their shared apartment. Bucky wouldn’t let Steve stay in that apartment by himself ever again. He had almost lost his best friend and little SJ. They would stay here. They’d get his stuff in the days to come.
“You are smart.” Torunn remarked, handing him a gift in return. “Never forget that my father is the God of Thunder; he wields stormbreaker and I carry a sword.” She smiled brightly at him and Harley faked one.
"After we brought Harley home from the hospital. We got into an argument. He wanted a divorce and I assumed he was gonna take Harley with him but he told me, he was unhappy and he never wanted to be a father. I figured he was just very emotional after giving birth days ago. I thought, maybe he just needed time but two weeks later and he never changed his mind. I got my lawyer to draw up the papers and he took half of everything and left."
Tony tried. He swore he did. He and Steve found themselves sneaking in kisses and little touches as they fondled each other. Steve had been starved, unable to touch Tony in all the ways he used to for years. He couldn’t resist and Tony wouldn’t blame him. He welcomed everything. They just hadn’t had sex yet. Not because they were saving it for something but because, they were hardly ever alone.
“So many changes.” Anna remarked after her thoughts of sole proprietorship had passed. She smiled. Morgan hummed in agreement. “Even within this short time that I’ve gotten to know our family.” She needed to be sympathetic. “You moved out…”
“Yeah. Um.” She paused, thinking about what she would say first. “It’s just my mom,” She shook her phone for emphasis. “Asking for my help with Anna and Peter’s party.” Jaime nodded. “You should come.”
“It’s 2 in the afternoon.” Steve expressed, pointing at his digital watch. He came bearing a plastic container with pastries as he entered their home.
“You didn’t let me finish.” He pulled Steve closer if that was possible. “One of the worst but one of the best.” He kissed Steve and Steve grasped Tony’s ass, raising a leg as he did to nestle the tip of his cock inside Tony. “I’d do it again…” He trailed off and Steve mumbled in agreement.
“Goodbye Dad.” She sang.
, like mom liked to say. He wouldn’t be difficult on the baby.
- Hammer was murdered by his accomplice who is still out there targeting Steve & Tony & maybe Anna
“Not really.” Anna responded. Her brother had clearly mis-interpreted what she’d said. “I got to train with them but never got to go on any missions.”
“Nothing.” they responded simultaneously. They could have passed for twins at the right angle and Tony wondered what his little Paige would look like today had she survived. Probably identical to Morgan, he figured but with his eyes.
Tony shook his head. He didn't want that and so he turned to his children. "Are you two satisfied now?"
“I don’t think you could ever bore me Tony. I know we don’t know each other well but there wasn’t a single doubt in my mind about meeting you the moment I heard about you.”
Morgan rolled her eyes. “I’m sorry, okay?” She tried. “Look we should have a family dinner, all of us.” They could address all of this.
“Fine.” And another kiss before he stood up straight and away from Tony’s face. “You want me to take the tray?” He noticed Tony had stopped eating.
“No.” He assured him, quickly, after which he trailed off into silence. He maintained this for only so long before he forced himself to fess up. “I’m a virgin.”
Jacob’s hands were glowing on instinct. Nertha became amused. “It’s mind control.” She informed him. “Courtesy of this lovely spell book” Said book appeared in the palm of her hand. Jacob smirked. Okay so maybe it was a spell. Whatever. “Borrowed from my dear Uncle Loki.” It materialized just as fast.
It was now nearing 4 years since they’d met, and they’d have a total of 4 kids by August. Twins was a hell of a surprise. Not that they couldn’t afford it, well Tony could but it took a lot out of them. They were fortunate enough to steal little moments like this – just the two of them. In those moments if they weren’t making love, Steve would sketch Tony and occasionally, paint him.
, only a second later. It sounded better in her opinion. It flowed better. And once again, as luck was on their side, the name was available.
Harley’s own blue eyes rolled. “I still know plenty of single people.”
“Peter.” He whispered, into his hair. Wade had limited his usage of nicknames for Peter since his return and became more touchy-feely than ever before. It was adorable. Peter pulled his head out of the crook of Wade’s neck so he could speak.
“Yes please.”
In the box was a necklace with the letter ‘W’ on it. “Not a ring but I want u to wait for me,” Wade stood up. As if he wasn't the one that needed to wait for him to be legal.
“Yeah?” Steve was littering his neck with kisses now. He rubbed his hands over Tony’s exposed bump. They kissed for a while before Steve pulled his own shirt over his head. Tony got an eyeful of his toned chest and abs. He longed for the day his body would look like that again. He was all fat, stretch marks and swollen tits. The baby had been having a field day with his body but it was worth it all.
Morgan:
Harley’s attention was caught. “So your parents made up,” but his eyes stayed fixed on the task at hand, only darting from other screens around him with information and different model designs.
When two days passed, and Tony hadn’t woken, Steve demanded answers from Stephen who hadn’t left Tony’s side.
Nat was hurting for her. She could only imagine how painfully it must be to lose a baby. She was so grateful that she wouldn’t ever have to go through that pain, given her inability to have children.
“You can leave now, Lila.” Sif commanded. Lila curtsied and left. “Always some jealous ex or the other.” she said, thinking of the first time she’d interacted with Carol Danvers following her wedding with Thor.
“Does it matter, Morguna?” Steve glanced over at her. He looked tired. He looked like he needed the investigation to be over and done with and Morgan was right. Steve just wanted to focus on being with Tony. He was done fighting and dealing with issues that weren’t affiliated with Tony or their children anymore.
A smile worthy of the name Cheshire cat smile stretched across Sharon’s face. Justin’s plan was something she could get behind. Anything to hurt Tony would make her happy. He was the reason after all, why hers and Steve’s relationship wasn’t making any progress.
Kayla rolled her eyes but smiled at him knowingly. “You forgot, didn’t you?”
Surprise covered Harley’s face. “Really?” Or was she just saying that?
“Tony?” Stephen whispered, so only he could hear and not over the mic. Tony knew he needed to say something, he was making a scene. This silence on his part was going on for too long now. All he had to say was yes because he did love Stephen and yes, he wanted to be with him.
Tony was racing out his room to get to Morgan’s. “Is there someone else here?” What if someone had gotten pass his security and attacked Morgan. Tony could never guess who. He and the avengers had rid the world of villains years ago. Only petty thieves were left that Peter was conveniently taking care of as Spiderman. Still, it wasn’t impossible that some new villain had come out and decided to attack his family first. No matter what he did, he always made enemies.
“Then why does Uncle Thor intend to gift Magni with Mjolnir once he is of age. It is, after all, a ruler’s weapon.” Torunn became consumed with doubt. She was never offered Mjolnir. Why should Magni have it? She was beginning to think her sword was of no value.
Pepper left Remy with Amelia when they found her. He would see himself out of the party after he’d spoken with Amelia. Remy passed on his gift and shared a hug with her. He spotted Natasha from a distance and the sight of her intrigued him.
Anna pursed her lips, annoyed that her question was being answered with a question.
Steve picked Harley up the moment the door opened, and he saw his son’s face. He was scanning the room for his mother. “Where mommy?” he asked, wrapping his little arms around Steve’s neck.
Tony snapped his hips. “I’m always right, Steve.” Then a firm hand grabbed one of his hips and Tony could feel the cock against his ass, standing proudly. Tony cleared his throat.
“Thank god!” Morgan exclaimed, throwing her arms up in the air and completely changing the dynamic of the conversation. Tony was taken back by her gestures.
Asgardian traditions stated that celebrations be held for significant birthdays in a royal family member’s life and dubbed coronations for heirs: crowned princes – future Kings and most recently, the crowned princess – the future Queen. Torunn had a lifetime more of coronations to attend while Thor was still King, but it wasn’t a bother for her. She enjoyed being home and celebrating with her family and her people. She just didn’t enjoy the part where she had to meet suitors. This was something she brought to her parents’ attention and they agreed to cut back on that.
“Do you hear yourselves?” Steve wondered out loud. “You four are so spoilt and entitled.” Morgan made to counter but was quickly cut off. “And not to mention, extremely inquisitive. When are you four going to grow up?”
It was early February. Nathan’s 18
Harley spoke up first. “Are you saying Peter is the good child?” Although he always knew Peter was. Morgan always tried too hard.
“Right.”
“Steve.” He responded.
“Let him in.” Tony informed her. He hadn’t seen Stephen in a while. He’d become a little bit standoffish following that conversation not too long ago, but he’d been busy with work and out of town for some time as well.
“I know some people that could maybe work on diminishing -” Tony stopped himself. That wasn't the right word. “- neutralizing your powers. Temporarily.” He didn't want to take them away. It was a gift and could really come in handy for her own protection, should she need it.
“Say what you have to, right here.” Tony explained, never letting go of Steve or moving away as he held onto him in turn.
He found Stephen among the crowd. The man smiled lovingly at him, but Tony was looking out for Steve who had said he’d be running late. He and Steve were on good terms of course so Tony would still worry about him. He hoped he’d arrive soon. For now, he’d indulge in the comforts of his boyfriend’s arms. Stephen was happy about that.
“I just don’t want to lose my husband.” Sam confessed. “And here you are surrounded by all this chocolate. And I know how much you love chocolate.”
As Stephen's mind wondered, Tony fell into a deep slumber with thoughts of finding Paige filling his dreams.
Bruce and Tony pulled apart and Tony got to hug Natasha next.
Morgan and Peter gave her a look of betrayal, but Tony smiled. His older three were always so nosey and Tony wondered if that was his and Steve's fault for always including them in their own drama or something else. Either way, Anna was starting to become his favourite child. “Thank you.” he said.
She left Renee to finish with Steve. Tony insisted on staying. He never paid must attention to this division in S.I. and he was suddenly fascinated. She let Tony be and headed back to her office, only after reminding Steve that she needed to see him later. Soon Renee disappeared to the next room to retrieve something else.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve chuckled, leaning closer to kiss him sweetly, slowly. “You are so snappy today.” He kissed Tony again.
“Wade you sound harmless,” Tony didn’t believe for a second that he was. “But Peter is just a kid.” He continued, “And maybe you guys aren't doing anything,” Tony doubted that. “But it doesn't look good. You got a kid. Surely you get where I'm coming from.” What would his reaction be if his daughter at 16 was “seeing” an older guy?
“Language!” Tony teased.
“Thanks.” Harley could see her looking flushed under the lights.
“Baby. It doesn’t matter. That shouldn’t have happened.” Laura added. She saw Natasha approaching them.
“Oh. That’s Aunt Nat.” Amelia provided, and he awaited her full name. “Natasha Romanov. I told you about her.”
“Yeah. Not easy at all.” Stephen agreed but still his attention was not on him. Justin knew he had to up his game.
Leave me your thoughts in the comments about the chapter 😉 and I hope the anticipated Stony sex scene was decent? 💛❤💙 (Because I feel like my writing has depreciated greatly)
Lila twisted up her mouth at that. “Your father is literally so hot.” She added, before sticking a lollipop into her mouth and sucking on it slowly. Amelia chucked a pillow at her. No one had even seen when or where Lila got the piece of candy from.
“How exciting.” Maria said joyously. She was secretly longing for the day her grandchildren would start their own families. With marriage on the way, she knew children weren’t too far off.
Almost everyone slept over. Tony had arranged accommodation like he did every year for everyone. They only exceptions were his kids’ friends that went home to their own families once the party was over last night. Steve was just getting back from his regular early morning run with Sam when he caught sight of Strange helping Tony with breakfast. They were giggling and Tony had on an apron that read “kiss the cook”. He seemed genuinely happy. Steve wished it was him making Tony laugh like that again but for the past few years all he ever did was make him cry. He saw Strange press Tony up against the counter and he couldn’t bring himself to look away. Sam patted him on the shoulder, making him turn away from the scene. It was his way of sympathizing with him. Sam eventually left Steve standing there to go freshen up for breakfast and wake his husband and child.
“Smells really good too,” Peter chimed in. and Maria went around kissing their foreheads.
Love, Raymarie 💞
“You’d been watching my 16yr old son?” Tony’s jaw tightened. “Should I just call the cops and get this over with then?” He didn’t have time for this. Not only was this terribly inappropriate, let’s not forget it was illegal.
He had hated Wakanda a few months ago, didn’t want anything to do with the country. What changed?
He noticed way too many men staring at Bucky like he was a rarity or some prize to be won. Sam found it appalling how well Buck fit in and he didn’t. His nerves were getting the better of him, so he had to address it with Bucky.
And Tony would have never let that relationship continue even when Anna was legal until he took a look at her almost identical file. She could take care of herself, apparently and Tony realized that he and Steve didn’t really know Anna. It still didn’t change the fact, however, that this was their child, a person they created together from their love who Tony had carried inside him for 9 months.
Steve awkwardly pulled Tony into a hug. Tony didn’t object. He needed that hug. “I’ll never let our little girl go through that.” he explained. “Never.” And he knew he was part of the reason Tony faced depression. Gosh he regretted it all.
Tony sighed, almost feeling sorry for him. “Stephen. You need to go.” His voice had hardened, as he faced the man who was still causing issues in his and Steve’s relationship. He heard Stephen take a breath. Tony thought he was finally going to let it go until he was pulled in by the waist and kissed on the lips.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony stayed quiet for a minute. Of course, he believed every word. Steve had never lied to him; would never lie to him. “Well I’m not opposed to you hanging out with Bucky and Nat, but Morgan was waiting up for you.” He lectured.
“Don’t.” Tony pleaded. “Enjoy your relationships first.”
“That was really sappy, huh?”
“Yeah.
“We should visit them this summer.” Nat suggested. “All of us.” Because last summer, it had just been Nathan while she and Bruce stayed home and had some alone time. It was great being alone with Bruce, she wouldn’t mind doing that again. But she was thinking it would be wonderful to see her sister and her family again. To stay on their farm, do farm work, camp out in the woods and take some time away from the real world.
“No.” Pepper responded firmly. “Not even if he was the last man on earth.” She would never think of Remy sexually, but he could see them having a decent friendship.
“I know. But I also know they miss each other so much.”
“Did something happen between you and dad?”
“Yeah. That’s you-know-who from now on.”
All the components needed for a possible rekindling of their relationship, if Tony just ended things with Stephen. Morgan had relayed most of this information to her friends being sure to omit the mention of Paige per her parents’ request. They didn’t want to jump the gun, didn’t want to get excited only to find out Paige wasn’t really at Xavier’s School.
“Nothing else exciting happening?”
"Yes."
Sorry that it took me so long to post this...here you go.
Tony canted his head to the side. “I think I may know someone for you-”
that from happening. Based on Tony’s frown and downcast gaze though, he knew that he had heard Tony correctly.
Steve wanted to say that he did that five years ago, but he wasn’t going to bring that up. Even if things had been better between them then, he wouldn’t have wanted Tony to go. He would’ve told him to stay at the facility or go home and get some rest.
“Mhm, sure.” He opened the door more and gestured for Steve to come in. He led him over to the living room. Some snacks were already placed on the coffee table. “I thought that you may want to eat something, so I put some food out.”
Tony walked away from the podium and made his way back to where Steve was standing. He flashed Steve his signature smirk.
He followed Tony to the pictures.
“Ah, right.”
“Are you going to keep staring at me or are you going to take it?”
Silence fell over them again. Steve clasped his hands together in his lap. He twirled his thumbs while he waited for Tony to say something.
“I finished it,” Steve said proudly.
Bucky shrugged. “Whenever the nurse tells you you can, I guess. That’s typically how it works.”
The next day, Steve spent his morning and part of his afternoon at the construction site for the facility. He hadn’t done much building, but he helped supervise different teams of people. When he arrived that the facility, he had wanted to get rid of some of the extra energy that had been buzzing through his body, but Happy told him no. So Steve spent most of the day supervising. When Happy wasn't around though, Steve had snuck in some building in here and there though, which seemed to help dissipate some of his nerves.
“Steve,” Bucky said, gaze still on him. “Rest.”
“Here’s your drink,” Steve said, carefully placing it in front of Tony.
“She said a few hours after you wake up and you’re stable.”
“What if it isn’t received well?” He knew that some people obviously wouldn’t be happy with the news, but what if the entire world turned against them?
And they did see each other in class.
to be a great friend to Tony. He didn't want to let him down again. He pushed his mug away from him and took out his wallet.
“So we actually did it.”
“I wasn’t going to let you do it alone.”
Tony shook his head and smiled. “You never cease to amaze me, Steve.”
And that was the moment that Steve broke. Tears sprang from his eyes, creating tracks down his cheeks. He couldn’t believe that he did this, made Tony this hurt. Yes, he had thought that not signing the Accords was right. But…if he had known that it would’ve caused Tony this much hurt, he would’ve acted differently. If he could go back, he would’ve just signed them and helped Tony negotiate some aspects of the Accords. Adjust them in a way that made both of them more comfortable.
Steve’s gaze roamed the room again. Well, that meant Tony had to be around here somewhere. He just had to find where; with how crowded the room was though, Steve doubted that he would be finding him any time soon. Besides, Tony was probably moving around the room anyways, so it would make sense to stay in one place just in case he walked past. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw a bar tucked in the corner of the room. Perfect. Steve padded over to the bar which had a few people standing near it. He took a seat at the bar and glanced around the room again. He thought maybe he'd see him from a different vantage point. Still, no sign of Tony. Where could he be?
“That’s okay. As I said, I haven’t been looking," Steve said, cutting him off.
“Yes. I didn’t want to, but Nat insisted. Things were tense between us, but he apologized.”
“So, Steve,” Tony started. Steve looked at him, a questioning expression on his face. “Tell me about yourself.”
Steve sighed deeply. She was right.
“Y-yes, sorry.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “I suppose that I could…if you want me to.”
Steve cleared his throat. “Anyways..I…er, just wanted to say bye before I left.”
“Me too.”
many people here. He knew that there’d be a lot, but he didn’t realize quite how many there’d be. He cleared his throat.
“You weren’t going to say goodbye,” Steve whispered.
Steve rolled his eyes, but his smile didn't waver. He still couldn't get over how Tony was here.
Thank you for reading this chapter! I hope that you liked it.
“He clearly wants to talk to you.”
Tony let out a soft laugh. “I’m joking, Steve. I guess I was just waiting for a good moment to bring it up.”  Steve exhaled softly; his shoulders relaxed a bit. “Obviously I’m here because I...well, I’m feeling better than I did then.”
Steve smirked; he was glad that his “Captain America” gaze still had some weight behind it even months after he was last donned the suit. He moved towards Tony, who was still the target of many questions. The crowd seemed to quiet when Steve stood closer to him. Probably because they didn’t want to be on the other side of his stare. They reached the doors of the gallery; the two guards who stood on either side of the entrance opened them for Steve and Tony. The brunette walked in, but stopped when he realized that Steve wasn’t following him.
“Well, you know what they say.”
Steve knew that it was common for people to exchange numbers, but it still felt so…foreign to him. Bucky had been the only one at this school who ever wanted to talk to him. Now, suddenly…Tony did too? Smiling softly, he turned back around and headed home.
Steve wasn’t sure if ‘humble’ was the proper way to describe Tony’s place. It wasn’t fancy, but it definitely was nicer than his place. Gleaming hardwood floors lead the way to the kitchen, which had granite counter tops and what seemed to be brand new appliances. He remembered seeing commercials for some of the appliances that were sitting in Tony’s kitchen. Tony lead the way to the family room, which was opposite to the kitchen. A big flat screen television was hung up on the wall. A leather couch sat across from it. Two chairs sat near the television, facing the couch. On the coffee table there were some magazines that were from other countries. Steve bit his lip; he hadn’t even been out of the country, and here Tony was, showing off magazines from various countries.
Tony nodded and crossed his arms over his chest, leaning against the back of the wooden chair Steve had set out for him.
Steve bit his lip. There was plenty that he could say, but he just didn’t know where to begin. Or what exactly he wanted to tell Tony at this moment.
Steve’s cheeks grew warm. He didn’t know how Tony could do that – make him blush with just a few words.
I have to admit, this is one of my favorite chapters of the story so far. I hope that you enjoyed it! As always, thank you so much for reading!
When they took a turn that led to their campus, Tony glanced at Steve.
? He could’ve said anything else, but he had to say “of course” like he had been waiting to be reunited with him.
I apologize for any typos or grammatical errors that may have slipped through the editing process.
Here's the next chapter! I really hope that you guys enjoy it. Also, thank you so much for taking the time to read this story; it really means a lot to me.
His phone went off a few seconds later.
He had originally wanted to sit outside, but it was raining today. Steve made his way inside and sat at a table that was placed in front of the windows that lined the front of the shop; he watched people pass while he waited for Tony. A bit later, when there was still no sign of Tony, Steve glanced at his watch. Fifteen minutes late. Steve muttered to himself about how he couldn't believe Tony was late. He took out his phone so he could text him, ask him where he was. Right when he was about to send the message, the bell attached to the front door chimed. His gaze lifted to the door; Tony walked in, sporting a leather jacket, a light blue shirt, and dark wash jeans. For a moment, Steve just looked at him, unable to pull his gaze away. He knew that it wasn’t nice to stare, but he couldn’t stop. Somehow, Steve seemed to snap out of his stupor.
“Is that so?”
“So it’s just me, then?”
Steve smiled; he was glad that Tony had managed to heal over the last few weeks. He didn’t like the idea of Tony ruminating and scolding himself over something that he couldn’t control even after he put all his effort into saving it.
Steve blushed. Perhaps he had taken some inspiration from Tony’s outfits…but that wasn’t important right now.
Bucky’s mouth twitched. “Punk.”
“We don’t have much time…I can’t wait once I get it.”
Tony pressed his lips together; he shook his head. “I suppose it doesn’t. You know that I can’t-”
“I suppose that is true,” Tony finally said. “Anyways. I think that you don’t talk to me, or many people, because you’re worried about how you come across. The less you talk, the more difficult it is for people to learn anything about you.”
“You really kept that phone on you for two years?” Tony asked, as if Steve’s words from just a few moments ago had finally sunk in.
Thanks for reading!
Steve stared at him phone. He wasn’t against that idea, but he didn’t know if it would be the smartest thing to do. But then again, Tony was specifically asking him to come here. Maybe he didn’t feel safe to talk about whatever he wanted to talk about in public.
Steve bit his lip. “No, it’s not. But I forgive you.” Even though he didn’t think that there was much to forgive - Tony was obviously upset.
“Why the long face?”
Tony gave him a look before taking a sip of his drink.
“Steve, it’s fine. I was joking.” He paused for a moment. “Were you planning on sending it to me or did you want me to pick it up?”
Oh…right. That.
Tony chuckled. “No need to sound so surprised. I like reading.”
Tony let out a long, exasperated sigh. “No one understands me,” he said, placing the back of his hand against his forehead. He slid his hand off of his forehead, back to his side. He looked at Steve. “You know that I’m not one to do that.”
Oh. Right. They weren’t the only ones in the room. The color on Steve’s cheeks darkened. Tony must’ve seen the blush, but he didn’t comment. He gestured to a red-headed girl who was sitting on the couch – she was about their age.
he thought to himself. Sighing, Steve followed him into the living room, where Tony’s portrait was still sitting on the easel. Tony stood in front of it, his head tilted to the side.
“I’ll have the pineapple and sausage pizza.”
“I know.” Steve reached for Tony’s hand, which was resting on his lap. “I’m not saying that I’m against this - us - from happening. I’m just saying...if we’re going to do this, I want to do this right. I want to do it when we’re both ready for it.” He gently squeezed Tony’s hand. Steve obviously was ready for it, but he didn’t want Tony to feel rushed to heal. He wanted him to take his time, to come back when he was ready.
Steve rolled his eyes. He wanted to tell him that he always looked good, but he opted not to say that. He probably wouldn’t hear the end of it. He typed out a reply and sent it.
So...Steve and Tony finally kissed. What will happen now?
Steve shook his head. “That’s not what I want to show you.”
“Please, Tony,” he said, his voice cracking over his name. “I know that I can’t undo what I did. I realize that. But this thing between us…it’s eating away at me.” He paused and looked at him. “To know that I did this to you…to us…to our friendship…I feel awful. I threw away one of the only good things I had.”
“Well, some people don’t bother to be polite.”
“I figured that you may want one.”
“You have one?”
“You’re the boss,” Tony said.
“That’s where I sit, yes,” Steve said, trying to change the topic.
“What are you talking about?” Tony began. Steve turned towards him, his eyebrows furrowed. “It’s really good, Steve.”
“Coming!” Steve called.
“I know.” Tony brought his beverage to his lips, taking a long sip of it. He put it back down and regarded Steve with a soft expression, as if he couldn’t quite believe that Steve was sitting across from him. “You know, I never thought that we’d do something like this.”
Steve’s eyebrows knitted together. “I just wasn’t expecting you to be here.” A blush crept onto his cheeks at the mention that it was his night. Perhaps it really was his night. Not that he cared if it was - all he wanted was for the function to be a success.
“Well, whenever you don’t talk to anyone else – except for Bucky – and whenever I try to make a conversation with you, you try to avoid it.”
“About what?” Tony asked, his voice soft. All traces of his earlier tone had vanished.
“Well…still. Thank you.”
Tony’s gaze settled on his mug. He ran his thumb along the rim of it.
Tony shook his head. “No, it’s definitely shocking. Pray tell, what made you come out here?”
Steve didn’t look at him. “It was just a nightmare. It’s not a big deal. I’ve had plenty of them in the past.”
have his outfit lying on the bed, though. The blonde looked at his reflection in the mirror and carded his hands through his hair, smoothing out the sides. Once the stray stands of hair were put in place, Steve sped over to his bed. He glanced at the time. Fifteen minutes before it started.
Steve canted his head to the side and smirked. Of course Tony was owning the crowd, like always. It was nice to see Tony back in his element, no matter how much he complained about going to these sorts of events. Once the crowd’s cheering settled, Steve made a beeline to the brunette.
“Your place?” Tony asked, raising an eyebrow.
He opened the door; Tony was standing on the other side, a pizza in hand.
A blush painted Steve’s cheeks. “Yes, I thought…well, I know that they’re your favorite.”
“They’re fine, Tony. I’m not trying to poison you or anything.”
(See the end of the chapter for
An answer should’ve come from Steve immediately. After all, that's exactly what he wanted to hear. Instead, he simply stared at Tony, convinced that just imagined him saying that. Tony Stark couldn’t possibly want to be with him. He was just a kid from Brooklyn. Somebody who just got lucky. But, that's what Tony had said - he actually wanted to have a
“She was worried about you. She thought that maybe I could get through to you, see what’s wrong.”
Twenty minutes later, Steve wondered if he had made a mistake by coming here. He still hadn’t seen Tony and when he looked to see if there was anyone else he knew, he couldn’t find anyone. He had thought that Natasha and Rhodey were going to be here, but perhaps he had been wrong. Steve pivoted in his chair and looked around the room; more seemed to be taking their seats, but a lot of people were still standing in the middle of the room and along the sides. Still, no Tony in sight. Sighing, Steve turned back to the bar. Perhaps he should just go home and tell Tony that he had come but he couldn’t find him to congratulate him. Yeah, that would be a good idea. When Steve tried to get up though, his body wouldn’t move. He
“You too.” He gave her a small smile.
“I’m not doing it alone – you’re right here.”
“Well, we wanted to say hi to you, but you seemed busy hosting so we didn't want to bother you,” Natasha said. “It’s good to see you, Steve.”
“I should get going. Besides, I don’t want to keep you from your guests.”
They ate their breakfast in silence for a few minutes, each one of them lost in thought. Steve glanced over at Tony every few seconds before he pushed away his plate and cleared his throat.
his event, right? Steve bit his lip and glanced around the room again. Perhaps this was a different Stark Industries event. Maybe the one that Tony was in was in a different room. But, he didn't believe that there could be two events at the hotel hosted by the same company. His gaze surveyed the crowd again. Where was he, then? Frowning, he padded over to one of the waitresses who was near him.
“It was.”
Tony didn’t say anything for a few moments, his gaze on the table. Steve was tempted to say something, but he didn’t want to interrupt whatever thoughts that were going through Tony’s mind. Finally, Tony spoke.
No, this couldn’t be happening again. Steve shook his head and stared at his lap. No - no. It couldn't be. He had done everything
“Honestly? I thought that I wasn’t going to make it. Then Carol showed up and rescued me.”
“Where’s Tony?”
“Sorry for talking about him,” Steve mumbled. “I didn’t realize that it upset you.”
“What about me?” Steve's head snapped up.
“Tony…you know that I didn’t want this to happen. If I had, I wouldn’t have left that day.”
Steve rolled his eyes. Sure, Tony was pretty, but he wasn’t that level of pretty.
“Tony…I didn’t tell you that because I wanted this to happen. This was the last thing that I wanted to happen."
(See the end of the chapter for
Bucky let out a sigh. “Is that any way to greet an old friend?”
Steve stared at him. He wanted to say something, but his mouth refused to work. All he could think about was the Tony Stark had kissed him. Tony Stark. Had. Kissed. Him.
The last sentence made Steve smirk. “I thought you found me annoying.”
“They’re not shallow things.”
"Yes."
Steve rubbed the back of his neck and paced around his living room. “Yeah, I know it took a while. I’m sorry about that-”
“Yes, we need them,” he said before he realized how quickly he had responded. Well…that sounded desperate. But…they were. Now that they had a chance of reversing what had happened, they had to fix it. They had to at least try fixing it.
“Since the battle, you mean? Three days. You woke up briefly yesterday.”
He remembered when Tony first told him that he liked to drink cinnamon tea when he couldn’t sleep one night. They had just worked a long mission and both of them were wired. So, Steve had suggested that he make each of them tea to help them sleep. He was going to make them both chamomile, but Tony had said he wanted cinnamon. Steve was concerned about that because the tea had caffeine in it, but Tony said that he was sure that he wanted the tea when he saw Steve hesitating. After that…well, Steve couldn’t forget his drink of choice.
you.”
Now that got Steve’s attention. His gaze shifted back to his friend. “He has?”
Tony stared at him for a few moments, as if waiting for Steve to say something more. After a few seconds, Tony sighed.
Tony smirked at Steve. “Miss me?” he asked.
“I promise it won’t be too bad to take a walk with me, you may even enjoy it,” Tony said. He winked at Steve.
Why’s that?
Steve bit his lip. “Thank you.” He took a sip of his beer and glanced around. Some people looked in their direction. “Would you like to talk somewhere else?” Not that he had a problem with talking with other people around, but he preferred to talk Tony alone. Besides, it was quieter out in the hall.
Tony smirked. “Having difficulty capturing my essence?” he teased.
Steve shrugged. “I’m doing okay. The project is taking up a lot of my time.”
The waitress came back to their table with a basket of garlic bread. The aroma of garlic and butter weaved its way into the air. Oh, god, it smelled delicious. The waitress looked at Steve and asked, with a wink, if she could get him anything. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Tony’s mouth purse into a thin line. Well, that was certainly interesting. Steve switched his attention back to her and grinned.
For the first couple of minutes of the walk, both of them remained quiet. The only sound that could be heard was the occasional snapping of tree branches that had fallen onto the sidewalk. Steve glanced at Tony a few times, wondering if he was going to speak, or if they were going to go this entire walk without talking. Either way, Steve didn’t really think that he would mind. It was nice just to have Tony with him.
Steve didn’t talk to Tony for a couple weeks after that. Not exactly because Steve didn’t want to talk to him, but because he was worried about what Tony would say to him. During their last encounter, Tony had basically read him like he a book. Knew things about him that he hadn’t expected him to know. What would happen if Steve let him see more of him? That’s right – he’d be in more danger. Not physical danger, of course. But in danger of allowing himself to get hurt down the line. Once people got to know Steve, they rarely stuck around.
“Tony,” he said softly. His heart hammered in his chest.
“Thank you, thank you,” Tony murmured as he stood back up.
When Steve had first heard that he had gotten into the law school of his choice, he hadn’t been able to believe it. Yes, he had the grades to get into the school, but he still hadn’t thought that they’d want him to attend. But here he was, holding the letter to the school. Tears threatened to spill over his cheeks. Steve Rogers, a nobody, just some kid from Brooklyn, had gotten into an Ivy League school.
So, for the next few days, Steve buried himself in his books, preparing for the upcoming exams that he would have to take. It wasn’t the most pleasant way to spend his days, but he had to do well on them. Get all As, if he could. If he did, he would possibly be eligible for a scholarship for the next year. He had taken out a loan to go to school, but a scholarship would definitely make going to law school less stressful. Unlike most kids at the school, Steve wasn’t a rich kid. He couldn’t just beg his parents to pay for his education – he had to figure out how to pay for it on his own. That’s why he was that much more stressed about the upcoming exams. If he got good grades on them, that meant that he wasn’t just wasting his time or money here – that he actually belonged here.
“Make yourself comfortable,” Tony said, gesturing to the couches. “Would you like anything to drink?”
He sucked in a breath; no, that couldn’t happen. They just got back together; they still had so much to talk about. And he had made a promise. He kicked off of the ground, closing the distance between Tony and him. He grabbed Tony’s other hand just as he snapped his fingers. The energy of the stones surged through Tony, making the man collapse against the rock. His eyes slid closed. The energy from the stones found its way to Steve, weaving through him. He gritted his teeth as he held in a scream. He didn’t let his hand leave Tony’s. He wouldn’t let Tony do this alone. Pain surged through him, making his vision blurry. A scream left his mouth.
“No. There’s a new restaurant that just opened up and a bunch of people are going there. You’re coming with.”
He could feel Bucky staring at him.
“What?” Steve asked, failing to find any other words.
“Pepper and Tony are a great couple. Besides, Tony’s not the type of person to marry someone that he isn’t completely in love with.”
1.) Bruce decides to take back the stones after they win.
“No need to thank me.” He pointed to number three on the list:
“Mind? Of course not. I’ll meet you in your bedroom in a few.”
“I don’t think so,” Steve replied after a beat.
Even though I edited it, I apologize for any typos I might've made.
The crowd didn’t say anything. Some people just nodded to show that they had heard him. Well. He supposed that was better than nothing. Steve loitered in the lobby while people gradually made their way to the ballroom. Once the lobby was almost empty, Steve walked towards the Grand Ballroom. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead as he saw the doors. He licked his lips. Well, here went nothing.
“How about you?”
Steve’s face grew warm. “I guess I’m just not used to someone looking at me at like that.”
Steve closed his sketchbook before Tony could see what he was working on and turned towards him. If Tony saw what he was drawing, he'd always tease him about it.  Tony eyed the sketchbook; his lips parted, as if he was about to ask a question. Steve braced himself for the question that he was sure that Tony wanted to ask, but Tony just placed the list on his desk.
Tony nodded and helped himself to a cheeseburger. Once he dressed it the way he wanted – with ketchup and tomatoes, he took a seat at the table. Steve plated a cheeseburger for himself before meeting Tony at the table. He sat down and smiled softly at the other man. He gestured to Tony’s untouched burger. "Feel free to eat."
Steve wanted to tell him that his apology wasn’t necessary, but he knew that Tony wasn’t going to let this go; he obviously felt bad for what happened after the battle.
About ten days after that, Steve’s plan of Avoiding Tony Stark was put to a halt. Steve glanced up from his laptop, unable to believe his ears.
Thank you so much for reading this chapter! Feel free to leave a comment or kudos. ^_^
Steve peered at Tony from over his menu. “I’m not sure yet. You?”
“We’re working on our presentation, Bucky.”
“You’re really talented, Steve,” Tony said.
“I didn’t mean to wake you,” he said softly. He carded his fingers through his hair, now slightly damp.
Steve couldn’t help the blush that rose to his cheeks. He felt like a fool.
“I’m sor-,” Steve began to say.
“I’ll see you in class, then,” Steve said.
“Getting snacks. And drinks,” Natasha said.
He held up his hands in surrender. “Sorry. Bad joke. I’ve had my fair share of bad dreams. About me…you…the other Avengers. Pretty much about anyone I care about. What I do, when I wake up from them, is remember that they’re not real. I think about the last good thing I did with that person, or heard about that person, and it helps make me feel better. Helps me realize that the dream was just that – a dream. May not be the best method, but it’s helped me.”
Steve’s eyebrows furrowed. “But you were with Pepper.”
“Steve,” he said softly. “…these are incredible.”
Tony laughed. “I can find you annoying and
“Go.”
“They weren’t listening to me! I had no choice,” Steve said with a huff.
“I wanted to walk you out,” Tony explained. “It’s rude for a host not to walk out their guests.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Natasha rolled her eyes; she glanced around the room before looking back at him.
The car turned into the Ritz-Carlton’s driveway and pulled up to the double-doors that led to the lobby of the hotel.
“Do you ever draw people?” Tony asked.
“What is?”
Steve woke up to find himself screaming. Sweat covered his forehead. His throat felt raw. How long had he been screaming for? The covers that had been up to his chin before he went to sleep were now at his waist.  He sat up and wiped the back of his hand against his forehead. He breathed deeply, rapidly, as if his body couldn’t get enough air.
“Yes, definitely.”
Anyways, thank you so much for reading this story!
Feel free to leave a comment or kudos if you want!
I apologize for any typos or grammatical errors.
Steve nodded and both of them fell quiet for a few minutes, each of them nursing their tea. The blonde glanced at Tony.
Thank you for your continued support! I hope that you liked this chapter.
“It’s a joke, Rogers.” He winked at him. “Although, I’m sure that you can’t wait to see what’s under this.” He gestured to his clothing.
Tony’s eyes widened at that. “Well, aren’t you just full of surprises?” he mused.
Bucky walked over to Steve and grabbed the remote that was sitting on the table. He turned off the television.
Thank you for your continued support! I hope that you liked this chapter!
“Yes, you do. You used that voice when the Avengers were fighting over which movie to go see at the movie theater”
Here's the next chapter!
Thanks for your continued support; it means a lot to me.
That was the past, though. He couldn’t change anything about what had happened between them now. He got up and walked over to Tony’s side of the table. He wiped the tears that were making their way down his face and sat down in a chair next to Tony.
“No…it’s not.”
Steve stood there, watching Tony disappear at the top of the stairs, unsure of what he had just gotten himself into. He could’ve said no, he supposed, but Tony seemed so excited about it, he hadn't wanted to turn him down. Besides, he may have been reading too much into Tony’s behavior. He and Tony were friends again, so maybe he just wanted to spend more time with him. Yeah, that was probably it. Steve nodded to himself and walked into the dark night.
Steve said goodbye to them and hung up. He pulled on some workout clothes and headed out for a run; he hoped that would help clear his head and temporarily forget about the event that was tomorrow.
“Is it done?” Tony asked, twisting the lid back on the bottle.
“No worries. Anyways. Would you like to sit at the table? Dinner is going to be served soon. Or you could continue to sit here, if you'd like.”
Steve sighed in an exasperated manner, but he couldn’t stop the smirk that tugged on his lips. “You know what I mean, Tony.”
Nodding, Tony gave him the tour of the rest of the place. As Steve expected, the rest of the place was nice. He wondered what it would be like to have parents that could afford to give their child their ‘temporary’ house. The tour ended in a large office that had a desk and two couches. A coffee table sat in the middle of the two couches.
Steve crossed his arms and looked both directions, trying to see if Tony was walking towards him, which he quickly found out that he wasn’t. Sighing, Steve went inside of the restaurant, thinking that maybe the brunette had gotten there before him and was inside.
He made his way into the room and sat down in an armchair that sat across from the couch. The guy who had been talking to turned to face him.
“Happy told me that you weren’t happy with the progress you were making.”
Oh, but Steve knew that Tony was right. He did tend to talk about shallow things. It was…safer that way. Because if he did open up to someone, like Tony, and they didn’t like what they saw…well, that would be that friendship – or potential friendship, down the drain. And Steve didn’t want that to happen. So, it was best to keep people at an arm’s length. Bucky had been lucky that he was his roommate. It was harder for Steve to be so closed off to him. But, he wasn’t really worried about Bucky judging him. Bucky rarely judged anyone.
this to happen. All he had wanted was Tony to be happy.
Tony pressed his lips against Steve’s again. A shiver ran down Steve's spine. Time seemed to evaporate as they continued to kiss, each of them lost in the moment, lost in the feeling of the other.  Eventually, Steve pulled away, his face flushed. He cleared his throat and looked at Tony. Even though they were sitting a little farther away from each other now, their knees were still brushing against each other.
The professor raised her eyebrows at Steve’s remark.
Now what was that supposed to mean? Steve crossed his arms over his chest.
“Getting coffees with Sam and Rhodey.”
Nodding, Steve focused his gaze back on his notebook. He felt like he should say something, but nothing came to mind. Small talk was never really his forte. Luckily for him though, Tony walked into the room a few moments later. He was holding a tray that was stacked with snacks and had various pitchers of drinks on it.
Thank you so much for reading this story.
“Ah.” He walked over and sat down next to him. “What are you reading?”
“So, I noticed that you haven’t sent me any of your drawings.”
“Mhm, sure,” Tony replied. “You just like using it.”
“Ah, right. That.” Steve looked at him expectantly, waiting for more of an explanation. “You had been avoiding me, so I figured that he would know what was going on with you.”
“And you don’t think that you should talk to him?”
“Going to keep on staring or are you going to invite me in?”
A few minutes later, he heard voices come closer to the room. He closed the notebook when the voices seemed to be right outside of the office. He drummed his fingers along the cover and glanced towards the door.
“How’re you feeling?”
Work seemed to help a little bit, but not as much as he hoped. He would focus on doing one task for a few minutes, but then his mind would go back to Tony, how they used to spend so much time together and no so little. It was so different compared to the time period after the Battle of New York where all of them stayed at Avengers Tower and Tony and him used to spend a lot of time together. Those times weren’t necessarily special, but it was a time where Steve was still finding his footing in modern day society and Tony spent a lot of time showing him the ropes – giving him cooking lessons, telling him shows to watch, books to read, etc. It was overwhelming at the time since there had been so much for Steve to catch up on, but now…he appreciated all the effort Tony had gone through.
Guess we’re partners, huh? –Stark.
“I have to go.”
Steve thought that Tony was finished with surprising him, but he supposed that he was wrong. And really, Steve was glad that the man wasn’t through with it. It would be boring if he could predict Tony’s actions. Not that he could, really. All of these years later and Steve still couldn’t quite figure Tony out. He knew him well, but not as well as the other seemed to know him. Steve had wanted to change that after they had been reunited, but he hadn't really gotten the chance.
Steve chuckled and gestured for Tony to come over and see the picture, but Tony was already moving. He stood behind Steve, his gaze focused on the easel. The brunette didn’t say anything for a few moments; Steve licked his lips and stood up, moving towards the easel, ready to tear down the page and start over again. He glanced at Tony.
Steve nodded even though they couldn’t see him. “Yeah, I know. I’ll go. You’re right.”
“That’s true. Sure. Your place, then.”
“Oh…thanks. I’ll have the fried rice.”
“I never went anywhere without it, to be honest,” Tony said. “Over the first year, I had no desire to call you, but I still kept it with me.”
“Let me get that frame for you,” he said.
Unless he decided to ditch tonight’s event at the last minute, which he doubted, but Tony could have chosen not to come and not have notified Steve.
“Continue,” Steve said softly, knowing that Tony probably had more to say.
“It is called the Avengers facility, Steve…of course you can help rebuild it if you want.”
“Is it really that shocking? I am an Avenger, you know," Tony replied, leaning against the wall.
“Do you always stare when you first see someone?” Tony asked, throwing Steve out of his stupor.
“Nice to meet you,” Steve said. He shook their hands before settling down on the couch.
“But that was different…”
“Great. I’ll send you the details later.” He winked at him. “I’ll see you later.” Tony padded away from him, leaving Steve standing there, staring at his back, completely bewildered by what just happened.
“We have to win.”
“I didn’t know that I was coming until last night. Happy asked me if I would come.”
The response came back a few seconds later.
“After the Battle,” Tony began, his gaze focused on the table. “…I was healing, yes, but I thought that I could fall back into my normal life. Go back to Pepper and Morgan. I thought that things would go back to the way they were prior to the Battle. I also knew that our friendship was in a better place, but I wasn’t sure how it would fit in with everything I had going on at home.” Tony winced. “I know that sounds awful.”
Tony looked at him. “Don’t blame me for that.”
Steve cringed. “Yes, I know that. I didn’t exactly want it to happen this way.”
“So?”
Tony nodded and walked to the front door, Steve on his heels. Steve opened the door for him, allowing Tony to pass. The brunette turned around to face him.
Steve placed a gray hairband in his hair - he still hadn’t gotten it cut - so it wouldn’t fall into his face while he worked. Grabbing a colored pencil, he set to work, shading in the drawing. He stuck his tongue out through his lips as he colored; he didn’t know why he did that, but it made him feel like he concentrated better. When Steve was about halfway finished the portrait, his phone buzzed next to him. He glanced at the screen.
Steve mentally winced. That was a great comeback. Jeez. He definitely needed to work on that.
Steve let out a breath. The tension that had riddled its way into his muscles disappeared. The corner of his mouth twitched upwards.
“There you go. Now, you can get into contact with me.” He winked and went back into the room before Steve could say another word.
“It’s very well done.”
He cleared his throat. “Oh, right. Thank you.” He took the pizza from him and gestured for him to come in. “You really didn’t have to bring anything…I have food here.”
“Everything okay?” Steve asked.
Right after the nurse informed him that he was free to move, Steve practically ran out of his room. His body still ached, but he didn’t care. He had to see Tony. He rushed down the hallway to a room that was right next to the elevator. He knocked on the door once before walking into the room. Tony was in his bed, his gaze set on the television that was attached to the wall.
“Yes.”
“Bucky told me that you were asking about Tony…he’s awake now.”
“I want to get to know you, Tony.” Stephen carried on. “All of you, if you’ll give me the chance,” and he brought Tony’s hands up to his lips and kissed his knuckles.
“Maybe not but I don’t think Tony Stark and Steve Rogers would be too happy to hear that their son has been subjected to mind control.”
She also advised him to press charges against him if he ever showed up again. She explained to Steve; he didn’t have to worry about Morgan growing up without a dad. Tony had brought everything on himself and everything that was coming his way. And Morgan would be okay. She didn’t need that sorry-excuse of a man as her father in her life. Pepper knew it was just an excuse on Steve’s part. He was probably so afraid of taking action against Tony. He was after all, a very powerful and now highly dangerous man. A danger to Steve and their unborn child. But Tony was gone, completely disappeared without a trace.
Harley, Morgan and Peter were seated in the living area when Steve and Tony joined them. They sat across from their kids on an ottoman. Harley tried to break the ice with a little humour. “Are we in trouble?”
“You’re not considering that because of me, right?” Morgan asked. Anna denied it and decided to change the subject altogether. Morgan would want pry even further and she wasn’t ready to share anymore yet.
“What?” Peter snapped. He just wanted to do it and get it over with. He wanted to know what all the hype was about, if it was as amazing as everyone said it was. The next thing he knew Wade pulled him to his feet and held him by his waist, Peter’s head tilted back, and their eyes stuck on each other.
“So, you have noticed!” Sam fired back.
Maybe, but Bucky wasn’t ready to try. Steve directed his attention to Nat. “When are you going to find a partner?” Bucky laughed at that.
“Rogue.” Her X-men alias.
Why was the universe screwing him over like this? He couldn’t answer that question even if he wanted to because Kayla came knocking at the door. He was inside for longer that he should be so he dried his hands and decided to join Kayla again.
“With Uncle Bruce.” Peter answered. He remembered because Nathan had mentioned it at one point or the other. He was almost sure.
“Thanks.” Harley responded, as a matter of fact. “After the whole mind control fiasco, I’ve decided to live my life differently –”
Steve came up in the elevator a moment later. He wore a checkered blue and white shirt and dress pants. He was freshly shaven and his strong cologne hit him as Tony turned to face him.
Peter listened in horror as Friday started listing pieces of information on Wade. “Yes Boss. Wade Winston Wilson. Born November 22, 1988 in Ontario, Canada. Age 28. One child: Eleanor Camacho. Age 5. Alias: De –”
Pepper had heard the splash and ran out with Morgan in her arms completely alarmed. Tony had reached the house by now and Pepper took in his very calm demeanor before asking what on God’s earth had just happened. Tony replied with “nothing” and Pepper spotted a soaking wet Steve coming from the direction of the dock. What was happening here?
Sharon’s due date was drawing nearer. Their daughter would be arriving in the world soon and even though he didn’t want a child with Sharon, Steve knew he would love that little baby like he loved his other children. Sharon was, unfortunately the burden that came with his child.
“It’s the anniversary.” He reminded her.
“So, you don’t want to do the egg count?” She asked, when he casually stated he didn’t want to do the thing he had made the appointment for.
“Of course.” They couldn't hide
“Well, who was it?” Morgan inquired.
“Pump this.” Renee Marshall, the head of the division under Peggy spoke. She was checking Steve’s reflexes following the strenuous mission he’d returned from the day before. He had been battered and bruised but was recovering quickly as was expected. Steve pumped the item in his hand as the woman made her notes on her clipboard.
He was going to meet Stephen Strange tonight so he told Peter and Morgan bye, grabbed his keys and opened the door only to come face to face with Steve. He was wearing a tight grey long-sleeved shirt that was rolled up to his elbows and a pair of jeans. He looked good, too damn good and he could smell Shawarma coming from the bags in his hand.
“Of course, they do.” She stated, adding more food to his plate. “Wade is here all the time. And he eats so much.” Harley grew very concerned as he saw Wade grin up at his grandmother.
After ending the call with Tony, Pepper got to packing containers of food and then Amelia walked in. She’d seen this scene before. There was only ever one reason her mother would be packing food.
Steve got up from his seat and walked over to Nathan and Morgan. He stooped down before her and attempted to wipe her tears with a napkin. It crushed him whenever he saw her cry and that was rare. She always held everything together. Always had everything under control. She was miss perfect. Tears were out of character for her and it pained him to see his little girl cry. Nathan let go of her hand and let Steve pull her into his arms.
“I guess.” Bruce added, when she pulled away. “It would be nice though…” It really would be, but it wasn’t for her. Nat was settling back into his arms when her phone beeped, signaling a new message. She reached over to grab it. It was a text from her sister, Tanya with a picture attached of her and her kids. She showed it to Bruce.
“You’re not worried?”
“I think Morgan’s losing the baby.” He whispered and saying the words alone was painful enough. Why was this happening?
“And I think you’ve spent way too much time with Harley. You may be almost 20 but I’m still your mother Jake. I can still blast you into the next galaxy.” Jacob found his hands, glowing unconsciously. He didn’t use his powers often. He didn’t like how destructive it could be. He often wondered, how his mother could control it so well. But when he thought about it, she never really did. Carol Danvers just let everything out.
“Friday?” He called out, hoping she would know what he was asking for.
“Yeah you are.” They got to Morgan’s room. She was standing in her crib, her dark hair getting in her face, her eyes red and nose running from crying. She saw her father and instantly lit up. “Dada!” she screamed, making grabby hands at him. Steve scooped her up easily with Harley still in his other hand. She rested her head in the crook of his neck and Harley was rubbing her arm in the attempts of soothing her. He’d seen his mom and dad do it on numerous occasions to comfort Morgan. Steve noticed it. Harley was such a smart kid and now Morgan was content. She had an unwavering connection with her father.
“I wanted to say congratulations.” Carol gestured to her belly.
Dr McIntosh glanced back at the screen for a second. “We’ll have to do an ultrasound to be sure.” Tony nodded, still in shock as she led him into another room. He really wasn’t expecting this kind of news today.
“Peter. Are you listening to me?” Michelle pulled him out of his thoughts. They were in the sitting room by the kitchen where they had started doing their homework until they broke off into conversations that were completely unrelated. Michelle had been chatting away and he was chewing on his pen, absentmindedly still deep in thought about Wade.
“Thanks,” Jacob responded. “Wiser words were never spoken by Harley Stark Rogers.” He teased.
daughter, Evie Rhodes -
“I don’t think it will ever be like that until they forgive each other. But I get why your mother never could. It’s almost unforgivable. And if he does, who’s to say he won’t do it again?”
“What?”
Cassie Lang was an only child for 10 years. Then Hope Van Dyne and her father had her little sister, Christie. Growing up she never had many friends until her father became Ant-man and he gained a few superhero friends who had children her age. It was how she met Morgan, Amelia, Torunn, Lila and most recently Michelle. She became good friends with these girls, which would explain her attendance at Amelia’s sleepover party and, why she was called and told about Pietro.
“Your Uncle Loki will show up soon enough. He has always been of his own way.” Thor explained. In all his years, Loki was one thing that never changed. Torunn finally turned her eyes to Valkyrie. It was nice to see another familiar face but it was strange that she would stand as a guard for anyone of the royal family. They all could fend for themselves. They were Gods and skilled warriors alike.
He and Lila were talking about Volgograd. Nathan always enjoyed his time there. Nat’s family was always kind and he was great friends with her nephews and niece. Jaime would be taking his first trip to the United States in December and Nathan thought he and Lila might enjoy each other’s company, so he asked her to be his guide for the duration of his trip.
That was not what Stephen wanted to hear. “Are we breaking up?” Stephen’s voice had faltered. Tony could hear his unwelcomed sadness.
It's short. But I had nothing else to say.
“Oh. I’m sorry for not seeing that.” Bucky mumbled while he pulled her into a hug. “Does daddy know?” He wondered. She shook her head. “Can I tell him?
“I figured you weren’t having sex.” Tony raised an eyebrow.
Steve was grabbing his keys from where he left them on the kitchen counter when his favourite child entered the room, a gift in her hand.
Clint shook his head and tsked. “I would.” He grabbed a biscuit from the plate before them. Natasha stared at him with confusion. She couldn’t understand the newfound resentment towards Steve, Tony and their children so she changed the subject altogether.
“You’re hyperventilating, Sir.” The AI explained. He thought of his babies. He had to relax for their sakes, for their lives. He took some deep breaths before he spoke again.
“I’m sorry.” Morgan took a step towards her parents. Since no one was speaking, she’d gladly break the ice. “Did you just say Aunt Nat is the woman you cheated on Mom with?” She paused, narrowing her eyes at her father. “Aunt Nat is the homewrecker?” For a lack of better words and she found Nat among the crowd, looking ashamed of herself. She came forward and so did Steve. “You’re the person that made my parents’ marriage fall apart?”
“Mom. It was consensual. He didn’t force me to do anything.” She carried on.
Tony finally looked to their children. “That’s why you’re our favourite.”
"I know. I just - he's always been very protective of me." Tony added.
Tony took the elevator down to the last floor and ventured to their indoor-outdoor seating area that opened up to the backyard. He noticed the blinds covering the glass windows were closed as well and the glass doors were heavily tinted. He wouldn’t be able to see anything until he opened the doors and walked outside. So he took a deep breath, pulled the doors open and walked in.
“I love you too.” Steve countered. He kissed him again. “Do you remember our wedding day?” The thought came to him as he was reminded that their first-born’s wedding day was less than a week away.
“Why didn’t you go?” Bucky questioned. Steve was quiet for a while.
Those who weren’t aware of the relationship, were shocked by the union. They couldn’t see that coming even from a mile away but like Hope had told Scott, they were adults, no one had jurisdiction over whoever they chose to date.
And Peter pulls out an even smaller box from within the box and then Wade is getting down on one knee and he doesn’t know what’s happening anymore.
Sam did have work. He was supposed to drop Winter at school, come back for a quick shower and head back out. But Bucky was very wet and inviting when he entered their bedroom this morning. Sam squeezed his ass and finally pulled away.
“No, I do not.” Harley agreed, checking himself out one more time before they made their way towards the grand ball room. Luckily for Harley, Torunn hadn’t arrived yet.
, Sam thought, watching his husband sigh in relief and pure ecstasy. He had both hands rubbing and massaging one foot at a time. It was the least he could do after the hurt he had caused him. They were both happy to put that issue behind them and move forward with their lives together and as a family as small as it may be.
“Okay. See you in a bit.” Peter headed to his en suite and Steve left his room, closing the door behind him. He was getting nearer to Morgan’s room when her door opened, and she popped out smiling widely at her father.
“I’m not but like that’s a big deal, Mom.” Because what if he did have sex unprotected one day and he winded up pregnant when he wasn’t ready for a baby?
“No Steve?” she asked, looking around. Even in her sickly state, she would never forget Steve.
“Yes. I miss you and our little girl. Miss our family.” Sam advanced again and Bucky allowed it. “Wanna come home.” He begged.
“Was I supposed to cry, Anna?” Her voice rose, her eyebrows crinkled, and her mouth formed a thin line. She was annoyed and her little sister decided not to respond but instead she studied her face. Anna wouldn’t cower away from her older sister’s words. That’s not who she was but Morgan hadn’t caught on yet.
“Okay…well, I get home and I hear them doing the nasty.”
"Family is Everything" check it out? Maybe?
Thor disregarded her words, engaging further into conversations with Steve and Tony. “How did you come to know of Harley and I?” she wondered.
After weeks, here it is. I'm so sorry. I hope everyone enjoys even tho I personally think I could have done this chapter way better.
“I should have you relieved of your duties,” Thor joked once she was in earshot.
“Dad aren’t you going to do something about that Wade guy?” Harley shared a few striking qualities with Steve. His overprotectiveness of his little brother was one such quality.
T’challa was kind enough to send a ship to bring them to Wakanda. On arrival, the Wilson-Barnes were greeted by the King, the princess and the fierce female guards, the Dora Milaje – led by Okoye. When T’challa saw Bucky, he approached him, speaking to his guards and servants in his native tongue to take their belongings to their rooms. Winter held on to her papa in fear. She didn’t feel comfortable being around all these new faces.
