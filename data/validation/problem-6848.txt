So I just lay back and take it. Some people have different tastes. Some like me on top, some like me on bottom, some like me to be tied up against the wall. Whatever it is. I just take it. As long as the money comes in.
"So its alive?" He was holding the egg carefully in his hand. Tony looked at her and then ran. He held the egg close to him. His child. One of them were alive. He would have gotten away with it, had he not bumped into Steve. Steve looked at him.
"Are you the great Tony Stark  who took 2 men at the same time? Really? You're pathetic." He threw me to the ground.
"If it becomes a monster, then we will deal with it then" Steve said, backing up Tony. Tony had lost so much recently, Steve wasn't going to let him go through any more pain.
"It's nothing" Tony said. Steve wasn't buying that. But he didn't really know what to do. He just thought that Tony needed affection and so kissed him. He pulled him close and kissed him. Surprisingly, Tony didn't push him off. Instead, he kissed back. That means it worked and that meant that Steve had come up with a plan.
At that moment, I felt like running away. I wanted to run away and be a homeless person- but I'd never make it as a homeless person. I didn't know what to do. My feet were frozen and then out of the ashes, came my father.
Light reflected off the thing she pointed at, but they couldn't figure out what it was. Tony started to fly towards it and placed Nat on the ground. Together they went to investigate. Thats when something wrapped around Tony's armour and stopped him moving. But there was nothing there.
"Who is most likely to have sex with a squid like creature out of them three?" Steve asked. Both he and Nat thought for a while. The answer was obvious.
He had a friend with him. I didn't know the other guy was coming. I couldn't say no because I was gagged. This guy just leaned to my ear and said:
It sniffed him and then what seemed to be a tongue forced its way into Tony's mouth. Clint started to laugh a little.
Steve heard the yelling and rushed to Patrick's bedroom. The creature and the child was gone. Tony was on the floor holding onto himself in pain.
"Steve. Please leave." I said desperately. "Thank you for the lift but please go. I'll see you at school tomorrow." He looked at me, like he could tell something was wrong. He nodded and left without another word. Now all I had to do was face my father. I really didn't want to face my father...
I moved seat. I moved next to the red haired girl from before. What was her name again? Natasha. She shot a glare at Clint and he went quiet.
"Tony?" Steve asked, opening the door. Tony quickly wiped his eyes, not wanting Steve to see him in such a weak situation. "Tony, you okay?" he asked.
"Natasha!" He shouted. She jumped. He had his hand over his stomach. He felt sick. She looked at his stomach and then called for Bruce to come quickly. His stomach was moving, meaning the eggs had started to move.
"Patrick, put him down." Tony said firmly. Patrick responded to that by throwing Steve at Tony angrily. Steve went flying and hit Tony. It was like Patrick had just played bowling with Steve as the ball and Tony as a bowling pin. The men hit the ground hard. Tony harder than Steve, due to Steve's fall being cushioned. Tony had actually hit his head.
Steve tried to get through to Tony, who could hear the screaming from Patrick anyway. He ran out to him.
Tony smiled happily as he saw the little arts and crafts that his son had made. He picked it up and one of the eyes fell off, making Patrick gasp and quickly glue it back on.
The doctor went to Natasha first, since she was bleeding out badly. She got the help she needed and was put onto bed rest until she felt better. Naturally, she wasn't going to stay in bed.
They had their weapons now, thanks to Steve and Nat, and so they were in for an even match. But Steve wasn't fighting. He scooped Tony up in his arms and pulled him to his chest, stroking his hair. He just wanted to comfort the man now.
Steve rushed inside and got Natasha to call for a doctor, he dragged Bruce outside to check Tony over briefly.
"Keep off them." Tony said. His voice blunt. He looked angry. Even Tony Stark knows better than to have sex with a monster. But if he didn't, he believed that the monster would force it onto the other two. He didn't want the other two hurt. That would be his fault.
The guy touched Tony. He started to take control and did everything he wanted. He held the knife in his hand.
Behind him was another muscular man. He wasn't as built as the blonde though. He had dark hair and dark eyes. He scared me, just a little bit.
"Shield." She said, but Steve didn't recognise the location they were heading too. He gathered Shield was still keeping secrets from him. He hated how he was not trusted there, after everything he'd done for them.
The male kept whispering "What have I done?" I suppose that means he's done something. Not that I knew what.
"Don't say that. You are banned from saying the word 'fault'.  It is not your fault at all." He said. I whimpered a bit. Of course it was my fault. If it wasn't my fault then whose fault was it? The guy went after prostitutes and jiggalos. I was a jiggalo. I had it coming.
The next few days were hell for Tony. He grunted and groaned every time he did an activity which involved more movement than getting up out of a chair. His stomach was doing flips and it felt like something was moving in him constantly. Of course, there was something moving in him. He had eggs in him. Eggs that, at any moment, could hatch. He was terrified and would barely speak to anyone.
"What do you think you're doing with that little man?" The guy said, coming closer. "I'm glad you chose which weapon you wanna die by. Lets make this good." Before Tony could act he was back on the floor. His head whacked against the wall. He blacked out briefly. The calendar fell from the wall and landed over his face.
Break here was very different to the public school.  Well it isn't. A gathering of people surrounded me, lead by the kid which I now knew was called Clint. I stood up to face him.
"They are coordinates. Come on let's figure out where he wants you to go to meet him. It won't be far away, walking distance." She said and we sat at a table. Once we figured it out I had the location up on Google maps.
A tentacle penetrated his ass and wriggled around inside of him. Then another joined and then another. He had tentacles in him. They started to move in and out while still wriggling. His body couldn't take it. He came into the 'mouth' of the tentacle sucking him off.
Tony grabbed Bruce and the three men all started to run, but there was no where they could really get to. Their was grate at the end of the corridor which was locked shut. No where to go at all.
"I love you, Daddy" he said to Steve. Steve's jaw opened slightly and he froze. He wasn't Patrick's daddy, Tony was. He couldn't take that away from Tony.
Tony cried as she continued. Bruce came in at that point. He was panting as he had ran from the other side of the compound. It was a large compound. He looked at them.
"Where is he normally when he vanishes?" I asked. When she said the garage I ran out. She didn't know where the garage was, but I did. I knew exactly where I was going. I suppose with what happened between me and him, he had some thinking to do. But that didn't warren a full week in this place. Something else must be up with him.
Since the battle of New York, Tony had been struggling. He was having a lot of panic attacks and anxiety attacks and he hated himself for it. Fortunately, the only person to see him have one so far was Rhodey. And Rhodey was the only one he wanted to see him like this, but right now- he was in a meeting and they had brought up
looked shocked. "I don't get it. It was like one minute I was invisible to them, the next they all want to love me."
Steve watched his comrades fight, but he didn't do anything to help. He couldn't. Tony was curling up around him. He squirmed around in pain. His ass was bleeding. His soul was damaged. Steve couldn't help but feel bad for him. Tony's hands clung onto Steve's shirt, making the soldier worry a bit.
"I noticed your arms are scarred" he looked at me with eyes that were worried. I started to cover up my arms.
I went inside to see him working away. Welding mask down. Focus on whatever the metal thing in front of him was. He looked like he hadn't even realised that I had entered.
"I love it!" He hugged him. Tony displayed the tube on the mantal piece to show it off for everyone to see.
Only today was different. When Hulk went chasing Clint the power cut out. Everything went dark and the lifts stopped working in the building, which meant poor Steve was stuck in them.
"I don't pity you, Tony. You are not the only person in the world to get a black eye. I don't care what you say. Everyone needs a friend and I will be here for you when you realise that." With that I walked away. I could tell that he was staring at me but I didn't look back. I wanted him to learn that I aren't pretending to care. That I actually do. But it is true, hes not the only one to get a black eye. The amount of times I went home black and blue. My mother freaked- every time. But I didn't tell her what happened. I just started to go to the gym and built up my strength so I could fight back. It felt good once the bullying stopped. Really good.
I did as I was told. It started to foam. I got it then. It was very satisfying. It surprisingly calmed me down.
"A door. I'm going to open it." She shot at the door's hinges then grabbed it and pulled it off the wall. She walked through.
Nat didn't flinch at this. She carried on shooting, but the others did. Clint lowered his bow for a second and that gave Pax the opportunity to get it off him.
Where my garage stood was just now a pile of rubble. Ash floating up in the sky. It was hot, like the flames had only just recently burned out. My little robot was outside of it. That was the only thing left. The whole place was gone. My father wasn't here but I knew it was him. He had threatened to burn the place down if he ever found out where it was.
"Y-You mean... That wasn't it?" He asked. His cheeks were stained with tears. Pax smirked and then it became clear he had a huge penis. Tony had only just noticed that. It entered into Tony's ass, tearing him a little from the size. Tony cried out in pain.
Living with Steve wasn't that bad. He was annoying at times- making me go to bed by a certain time, and waking me up for breakfast at 9 am sharp. 9 am is too early.
"The only thing we have on the system is a creature called the Jagkar" He said. "They are creatures which alter their looks but basically their original form is a huge green and blue tentacle monster. Looks kind of like a squid. They can turn invisible, which is what you saw. And can look like a woman with a tail. They hang out in sewers and swamps and places like that. They are increidbly strong, but if you had a Hulk, then he would probably beat it. Whatever you do, don't let it have what it wants. That will only make it stronger."
The Hulk saw the creature jump and land outside the window. He snarled before making a Hulk sized hole in the kitchen wall.
"Hey, Cap. Whats up?" Nat asked. Her, and Clint, were both in pyjamas. Clearly, Steve had woken them up. Bruce was in a bathrobe and Thor- well... Thor was just dressed like Thor.
"When I was finally able to remove the rubble, there was no Hulk or Clint. It was like they weren't even there to begin with. So that means-"
"So you're gay? " She whispered. I froze. What if someone had heard that? "Don't worry, you're not alone. I'm pansexual." For some reason, that made me smile a bit too. It relaxed me a little bit. I am glad I'm not the only none straight person in this school.
Tony was sat at his desk, scuffing down a 14 inch cheese pizza and drinking a milkshake. Natasha looked at him and couldn't help but feel sympathy for him. He looked unwell, but he also kind of looked happy. And if he agreed to getting rid of the eggs, then he wouldn't be happy any more.
I let out a sigh. The only thing going through my head right now was 'she could be a friend. Don't push her away too.'
"I know... Sorry. Did we actually kill that creature Steve? It makes me worry." Nat sat down on the bed and just pulled out his wallet from his bed.
"What is he doing at an abandoned garage?" I asked Nat shrugged. No. Of course she wouldn't know. Only Tony would know. Its him that is there. I will make sure to go alone though, I don't want to discourage him by bringing along old Buck or someone else.
"Alright. Just know, he won't speak until he has his coffee in morning. Thank God its weekend because there is no way I'd be able to send him to school tomorrow." She said. I walked over to Tony and rubbed his back. He was just staring blankly at the table. When I touched him he turned to look up at me and then buried his head into my stomach. I ran through his hair comfortingly.
"I don't know. the lift broke down. The numbers aren't on the little screen. I'm going to see if I can get the door open."
"No. You're daddy." He said. He got out of Steve's grip and ran out of the room crying. Steve followed him but then decided to leave him alone because he had ran into Natasha. Nat could look after him. Instead, Steve went to check on Tony.
"But when you're done in the shower, we can't have sex," one of the creatures tentacles started to come out.
"Do you wanna know why I was there all week? It was because my Dad took me to his stupid homophobic old people club. They don't accept me. He doesn't accept me. My dad just wants to change me. He burned this place down to control me. You lead him to it." I was crying. I don't know why I am so angry at Steve. I am just hurting.
Steve made his way into the base. Nat was already calling through to Fury, who was busy. But he had heard what had happened on the news. Fury did care about the Avengers afterall, even if the only one he had actually told this was Tony.
"Okay. I made you a present." he squealed and dragged Tony out of the room. He had put some pipe cleaners and googly eyes onto a toilet roll tube. He smiled happily at his dad. "Do you like it?"
"He left the house- just after your friend did- and hasn't returned yet." Steve then stood up as well.
"Why aren't you greening up. Dude!" He said. Clint wanted out, that was clear. It stunk down there and was wet and they were under threat of that creature.
Natasha had Patrick wrapped around her. She sat with him and watched cartoons and funny videos with him for a while, until Steve walked into the room. He had a red mark on his neck.
"It wasn't hatching at the time. We put it in the fridge to stop it from hatching. Aparently they don't like the cold that much."
"He's never had a tentacle monster in him though. I'm pretty sure that man has taken 2 or 3 dicks in him at once but not a whole bunch of tentacles." Said Romanoff. And there was the comment that Steve didn't wanna hear.
"Oh that's cold." He whispered. He walked over to them, "Are they all out?" Natasha nodded and Bruce started to stitch him up. Natasha cleaned her hands off as she had successfully murderered all the eggs. Tony was crying his eyes out. Bruce felt bad. He wrapped his arms around Tony.
I watched Steve walked away. My chest sank. I really did need friends here. I had no one. It took guts for me to get out of the car right now. I made my way to class. Steve was in the class. I hadn't realised that before. To make things worse, Pepper had said she wasn't going to be used like that.
"Hey... Hey knew boy." A male with short hair, which was like a browny blond colour said. He then threw something at me. "Do you actually get this?" My eyes stayed down at my work. Do not respond. I will not respond to idiocy. "You ignoring me new kid?"
He picked him up and rushed out, getting Tony safe. He got through to shield, who had got a van ready to collect them. Steve got into it and laid Tony down in it.
I was horrified. Tony had told me he had a new Client coming. Well this new client seemed to be doing something he really shouldn't have been. I have never been so angry.
"Glad to see you up." She said. She did feel a bit of guilt about what she had done, but she stuck by her desicion. The eggs needed to be destroyed. Tony opened the fridge and looked at the eggs they had in there.
Patrick walked nervously into the medical room. When he saw Tony he ran to him and hugged him. He hugged tight. His head buried into his chest and he cried.
"Because I'm your friend, Tony." I feel like everytime I say that, I am friendzoning him. I don't wanna friendzone him.
"Bad." Steve said. He sighed. "Fury said we need to get the eggs out of Tony before they hatch. I've tried to convince him to go through the surgery but he snaps every time I tell him."
He went into the lab and pulled up the plans for his new suit. He sighed looking at them. He had time to work on that. He put away the plans and then pulled up the plans for something to help Steve. It would be a surprise for him. He wanted to make sure that his shield never got lost and he also wanted to make him a head set which would be attached to his clothes. The headset would monitor his breathing and his fitness, meaning he could take it on his runs every morning and track his progress. Not that Steve needed to progress any more.
"But why would your dad hit you for when I came round unless- wait. Do you have feelings for me?" Tony started to play with a screw driver, going rather awkward.
have standards." I told him. That angered him. Me and my stupid mouth making things worse. He grabbed my hair and pulled it making me wince. His knee rose to my crotch and he rubbed it roughly. I hated this. I didn't want this.
"Nat" Clint said. Nat couldn't answer, she was more focused on what was happening to Tony right now.
"Okay. First. Are you alright?" I repeated my first question.  He answered all the questions eventually.
"I think they are in here" She said. The lid was back on it, but luckily there was a Captain America to lift it off. But when he did there was two glowing green eyes staring at him. They turned red when the creature realised who it was.
"The others? Look, sir, if you want my services you have to follow the rules." He walked over to me, he was so much taller.
thinking. You know that saying: 'don't think, you'll hurt yourself'? You look like you're hurting yourself." Bruce's response was
"Too many questions. One at a time please." He said and rubbed the bridge of his nose. He looked tired. I feel like by distracting him from whatever it was that he was doing, I pulled him out of his cloud of happiness and back to reality. I  kind of felt guilty for doing that. I don't think that I should have.
Tony was the first to enter the water because he was the most covered. He stayed in the water a while, then put head under. He wasn't 100% clean when he got out, but he was good enough for the creature to be satisfied. Clint just walked through the water and the creature pushed him backwards back into the water.
. He carried him out of the room and to his bedroom. Tony was breathing heavily. "Why are we here?" He asked.
When I went to work, I was glad to have him. Especially after what happened on a Monday. I don't remember the date. I just remember seeing the word 'monday' as it happened.
"What? What happened?" He asked. He looked around, though he couldn't really see anything. The light was too dark, then out the corner of his eye he saw a light. Something was swimming in the water towards them and it didn't look friendly.
"Alright Buck, see you tomorrow." Steve said. I lifted a hand and waved a little before the male ran off. That left Steve and I in an awkward silence. Another thirty minutes passed. No sign of Dad.
"Leave him alone, Clint?" A ginger lass said. He sat back, listening to her. I could hear him grumbling. "Sorry about him, I'm Nat-"
"Patrick. Me and Tony aren't together." Patrick now looked confused. His little brown eyebrows were furrowed.
I stood next to Tony and watched him work. Even when I was stood almost touching him, he still didn't realise that I was there. He took off the mask and moved onto something else. He looked so content and happy.  It seemed almost cruel to interrupt him, but I had to do it.
"I don't know. We don't know what we're up against. Stop asking questions, Rogers, I'm as worried about them as you are."
I got out of the car and went to my class in silence. The thought of me just ruining my one shot at friendship filling me up. I am alone. I will always be alone.
"You look terrible." I laughed. He smiled a little then walked over to me. He hugged me tightly and buried his head into me. I didn't understand what was happening. I didn't know what was wrong with him, or why he decided to vanish to the garage for a week. But I wasn't about to ask him. Whatever was going on inside his head, I didn't want to bring it up and make it worse.
The release on his armour got triggered and he fell out of his suit. Whatever had him, wrapped itsself around his leg and started to drag. Nat could see the lights reflection again and started to jump to dodge. She watched Tony get dragged into the sewer.
I was not expecting Steve to stay with me. I'm a handful. I showered quietly then drank my coffee, looking over at my mother- who was pacing back and forth.
Natasha quickly realised and picked up a gun. She shot at it rapidly, tentacles flying everywhere. Pax got angry and charged towards her. He started to snap his jaw like he was a shark and then he caught her, taking a chunk out of her shoulder. She let out a scream.
Tony let out a cry as all the liquid in his ass erupted out. Along with it came a load of poo. Pax had forced an enema on Tony and it wasn't a pretty sight. He cried out as it happened.
After a long while, Pax 'came'. His cum was just eggs. He had filled Tony up with eggs. He pulled out and then Natasha started to shoot at him. Everyone could move again.
"I'm not going to give you it now. You haven't made your appointments." I told him. He sighed and stood up.
Tony moved the calendar and the guy pinned down his arm. He couldn't cry. He was too angry to cry. He just wanted this over.
"We were trying to perserve it. By orders of Shield." Natasha answered. So this was a Jagkar egg. Tony held it in his hand.
"No. You're.... Mother? was a monster. You aren't you are whatever you want to be" He said and took his hand.
Natasha rushed into the building. It was a large place but luckily she didn't have to look very far before she found the scene. Her face twisted in horror and she put her hand over her mouth. She felt sick.
"Which one of you is the leader?" It asked with a bit of a hiss. Instantly both Bruce and Clint pointed at Tony. Tony looked at them at them with a feeling of betrayal.
Tony got excited and went to find Steve. He dragged him by his arm into his lab and they watched the little egg hatch.
"So I asked you here because I was thinking about what you said." That peeked my interest. "You were right. I do need friends. I'm sorry for saying you pitied me but I've never really had anyone that actually cared for me."
He stood up and stumbled his way towards the kitchen. The billionaire made himself a cup of coffee and sighed contently. He had a small smile on his face. Even when Clint came in grouchy, he had a smile on his face. Clint shoved Tony out of the way to open the fridge. In furnace, he was stood right in front of it.
"I'm fine." He said and got up. Only to be lifted off the floor by Steve and carried out of the room. "What are you doing? I said I was fine."
"Oh. Well don't tell your father. He said if he ever found where that place was then he'd burn it down." I know that Dad had said that. Which is why he will never find out where that place is. "I'm surprised you came home if you were there though."
I just decided to leave the school. The hate for school was growing stronger, however, Nat came with me. It was nice to spend the day with someone who understood me. It felt great. I guess Steve understood me but I don't know if I can trust him any more. I aren't a pity party. But...Maybe he wasn't giving me pity afterall... What have I done?
So last night after Steve left, I ran myself a bath. I sat in it for a good hour just soaking. I called someone and got a massage. Cream was put on me on irritated areas. The massager cost an amount of money which I could not afford. Seeing Steve today was going to have to be cheap, because I am flat broke.
Seeing Steve today though. It was amazing. We just hung out, I bought him a shirt... That guy loves skin tight clothing. But then he had to ruin it.
"Our invisible friend got them" Steve said. She nodded. They sighed. Nat crouched down to Steve and inspected his leg.
Bruce had noticed this, and thankfully, the doctor was willing to help out. He brought his gentle kisses down to the top of Tony's jeans.
"Well... You must be better than his last sexual partner... Well... Maybe... Well... There was a lot of tentacles in and on that man." She was trying to get her head around it.
Tony sat up in his bed. Sweat dripping from him. He wiped his head. His boyfriend, Steve was laid next to him. Steve put his hand on Tony's and looked at him softly.
"I'm going to go and try to convince him. Woman to... pregnant man" She said and got up. She headed towards Tony's lab to talk to him.
They were led into rooms which had ensuit bathrooms. This place where the tentacle monster lived was extremely civilised. There was only 1 creature though, so why it needed a place like this alluded the three men that were currently accompanying it. The mosnter led each guy to a seperate room and told them all to go shower. Clint, however, didn't trust the place. Bruce went to shower because he felt awkward and Tony had to shower because no matter how good that river was, he stunk massively and it was burning his nostrils.
"Well whatever it is, I'm sure itll be okay." She said "You'll figure it out." But Tony couldn't figure it out. And the creaking started to get worse. He put his suit on as quick as he could and flew out of the nearest window. The top floors were starting to collapse and he could see what was going to happen next, so he flew back in to grab Nat. He did it just in time for the building to be demolished right before his eyes. Nat looked around.  "What's that?" she pointed.
Nat was quickly rushed to the medical room, as was Tony. Tony was whimpering and crying. Natasha just sat suffering in silence. She always suffered in silence.
There was a total of 8 enterances and exits for this place. He saw Romanoff in the river ahead of him. She went up to him and smiled.
"My time in Afghanistan." He said. He didn't need to say any more. Steve knew very well that the two months that Tony was in Afghanistan was hell. But he thought he was over it as well. Clearly not.
"I'm not gay. I am taken though. I have a girlfriend. She's called Pepper." I said. He let go. I had just lied. I aren't with Pepper. She's just one of my best friends. He was right... I am gay. Not that I want these idiots to know though
Tony looked at Natasha. He knew what she wanted to say, but he didn't want to listen to another person preach about how he should get rid of the eggs. The truth is, he knew he had to, but he just couldn't bring himself to do it. The thought made him feel like crying.
"Oh there's one more thing." Fury said through the communicators, "it needs its victim to feel like theres no other choice and it needs to be consentual. The Jagkar may even make the 'ceremony' public" He explained. That made Steve grimace even more.
The building started to creak and the air started to feel heavy. Something was going on. Steve managed to open the doors of the elevator and lifted himself up on the ledge, just in time for the elevator to rapidly start crashing downwards. Whatever was happening wasn't good.
"Nothing Tony hasn't done a thousand times already." Steve said. Given that he was feeling uncomfortable about the whole situation, that comment was asking for more comments which will make him feel more uncomfortable.
Romanoff got nervous when Patrick was born. She was even more nervous when he grew legs and started to run around the compound like an actual child, but Tony reassured her that it was okay. He knew Patrick couldn't do any harm. He watched as the young
Luckily the coms were still working. By habit, Steve had put one in on his way out. It was he was always on call.
"Okay... I'll go see one of your friends instead then. I bet they taste better than you anyway." It started to go away. Tony thought for a while. This creature was a monster and had tentacles. Now, he'd seen enough hentai to know that tentacles + humans do not mix very well. He didn't want to be the reason for his
"I didn't say it was." I wanted this conversation to end, but Steve took it a step further. He took hold of my arm and pulled my sleeve up to look at it. I looked down in shame.
"You're quitting. I thought you needed the job" Steve said in concern. It was true, I needed the job. But after what just happened. I can't. Steve wrapped his arms around me tightly. I should have been okay with that but I really wasn't. I launched backwards to get away from him. "Sorry" he said. He closed his eyes.
"I'm not-" he lifted me up over his shoulder. "What are you doing?" I wriggled, trying to make it difficult for him to carry me. He held on tight, eventually my arms and legs got tired and I surrendered.
place to work. Straight afterwards, you come home. You will be pampered and looked after. The best possible care. Look I know you need that job, thats why I'm not stopping you doing it. But if you think for one second that I am going to let you hurt yourself or worse over it, you have another thing coming."
Tomorrow I will have another customer. A regular. Hes a client. The guy enjoys giving pain. A sadist. I wish that I was able to use an alias on these jobs, but anyone with a tv knows who I am. I have 3 more days till my day off. My day off is always the same.
I can honestly say it was pleasant. I would love it if he stayed my client, or if I just kept doing with him casually.
'A new school, a new life.' That is what my father said when he pulled me out of public school.  'So you don't have to make the same mistake again.' But I never made a mistake. All I did was be me. It is not my fault them people did not accept me. Surely that is their problem, not mine? And so maybe I will be myself here. Not sure though. Public school. I'm probably more likely to get wedgies, swirlies and just plain beaten up here than I was at private school.
Throughout the day, I was just thinking of Tony. I don't get why I can't get him out of my head, but I can't. No person has ever had this affect on me. Not even Peggy and she was my girlfriend for three years.
"Nothings bothering me. And I tried a bath." Two sentences which just contradicted themselves. Tony looked at Steve.
"Don't Tony me. Stop pretending you care for me. You pity me. I don't need your pity. You are not my friend." That hurt. I clenched my jaw and nodded.
Tony wasn't in school the next day either. Maybe he was sick. That's what I thought. But when he didn't show up on the third day, I started to worry. By the fourth day, I went round to his house. His parents didn't know where he was. His mother was worried. I was worried. Where could he be?
"Can you stay? While I bathe? Can you stay in here?" I asked. He nodded. I got in the bath while it was still foaming and giggled at the feeling of the bubbles coming out of the bomb touching me. I leaned backwards and relaxed a little, holding my hand out to Steve, who took it willingly.
All I saw was red. The next thing I knew he was unconcious on the floor and Tony was clinging to me shaking. I called the police and, by Tony's request, took him home. He needed to be looked after.
"Would you like to dominate. I don't want to add any more pain onto you." I wasn't fussed but he insisted that I dominate.
"Yeah. I can feel that." Tony spoke. He put his hand over his head and sat up. "I think you need to get us a doctor." Tony said. Patrick wrapped his arms around Tony's waist and hugged him tightly.
Inside Tony was 15 eggs. Each one looking like a ping pong ball and moving around. They were starting to hatch. Natasha was not scared to do what she had to do. She put her hand into Tony and grabbed the eggs.
Steve had a sofa bed in his bedroom. Of course he had a sofa bed in his bedroom. When night time came, he locked the bedroom door and made the bed for me. There was no using the bathroom tonight, I guess. Though, I wouldn't need the bathroom if I slept all night. That probably wasn't going to happen. Steve doesn't know all my problems though.
"You have fresh cuts." He sighed. The super soldier stood up. He towered over me. "Come on." He said. I shook my head and covered my arm.
"Did he follow me?" He asked. My mother didn't know. I ran out, with Steve following close behind. Then I found out where my father was.
"Guys? What's going on?" he asked, but got no response. The building creaked again and then it started to fall. Steve had no choice. He took a step back and jumped out of the window, landing with a thud. He let out a groan.
"Guys? Can anybody hear me?" He asked into the com. He let out a bit of a whimper as he tried to move the Hulk off him. When he got the reply he was over the moon but no one came to help him.
Romanoff was shooting at Pax, who did a squeal like scream and shook his tentacles wildly. He started to charge towards her, teeth growing in his mouth. Each one as sharp as fangs. It looked like he had a sharks mouth now.
He was up for that. Tony spent a few hours reading his son to sleep before there was a knock on Patrick's bedroom door.
"Can you tell Steve Rogers to meet me at this location after school." He handed me a bit of paper. So this was about Steve. I took the paper. He'd given coordinates. Once I nodded to say that I would, the male vanished. It was strange.
"You can control it, Patrick. They are part of you, you're not part of them." Steve said, trying to calm him down. The tentacles wrapped around Steve's waist and lifted him in the air. Patrick's eyes were turning red.
Tony's hand reached out of the shower to feel for a towel, but he couldn't find it, so he grabbed the shower curtain and used that to cover his dignity. The creature was looking right at him.
Nat walked for what seemed to be an hour, but was actually more like 5 minutes. Everything was the same. Rusting walls, disgusting water. The water was black and felt lumpy in places. At the end of her direction there was a door. It was locked and rusted over, but that just made Nat want to open it.
"Tony is getting French kissed by some kind of lizard thing" he was laughing. Bruce nervously laughed too, but Tony didn't seem happy. His eyes had widened when its tongue went it, but it shut as it was forcing its way down his throat, almost suffocating him.
"You're moving in with me until I deem you fit to look after yourself without doing this to yourself!" he held my arm up, showing me my scars. Each scar was just a reminder of the way I f***ed up my life.
"Then why are you here?" the other male asked. I didn't think it was any of his concern but I answered anyway.
"You are both my prisoners. Toys for my children. Your leader is my toy." It's tentacles rubbed their cheeks. Clint moved his face away but then nearly fell over. He couldn't move his feet. Bruce gave Tony a look of sympathy.
"Ill run you one" He patted my back. He called me through once he was done, though he had just filled a tub with hot water. I looked at it, looking confused. He chuckled and handed me a bath bomb. "Drop it in" he said.
then they would have to give him some form of affection. Knowing Tony, the affection would have to get sexual at some point. Surprisingly, at the thought of it getting sexual, none of them were repulsed. The only one who felt a little uncomfortable about that was Bruce, and that was only because he was worried he might turn into the Hulk while doing something like that.
He ran after the Jagkar, chasing it into town. It was a bad idea but Hulk wasn't exactly leading the chase. He was just running after the creature.
"Why is one of the eggs round?" He pulled out the carten of eggs. Inside the pack of 6 laid one ping pong ball shaped egg. He frowned and picked it up.
Most of the bullets were being blocked by tentacles. Well, they were blocking Pax but as each tentacle got shot, it exploded and grew back.
Clint followed Tony, but he kept his distance. The guy absolutely stunk. He was plugging his nose the entire way there. The place they arrived at was not something they expected. After walking for 3 miles through the sewers they arrived to something which was under water. It was a glass dome to keep the water out and had oxygen tanks all over the place. There was a white building in it and it was spotless. A small, controlled stream ran in front of them with no bridge across.
After school, I rushed to the garage. It smelt old. Dust and ash going up my nose. I could hear a saw being ran. But this place was abandoned, which meant that the only person who could have been using it was Tony.
"Where's Tony? Is he not included in this team meeting?" Clint asked, annoyed that the billionaire got to sleep or stay in the lab while he got woken up. He was close to going to wake up the sleeping man when Steve stopped him.
She sat next to him and closed her eyes. Her shoulder was hurting because her arms were (uncontrollably) swinging as she walked. Natasha put her hand on her shoulder and looked at Tony.
"This place is huge. You must be rich." Steve laughed. "Oh... That's Howard Stark." He looked at a photo of my dad.
Tony got treated, but Patrick just felt guilty. He was currently hating on himself. He hated what he was and what he had just done.
I left before Steve could ask me how we wouldn't work as a couple. It was just obvious. I'm not allowed to be gay according to my father. I know it's not fair but it's how it is. On top of that, I barely know the man and I don't want to just rush into a relationship. Though it's true. Love at first sight probably does exist. Well in this case it did. But love is just chemistry anyway. A series of chemical reactions going on inside your body. It's science, not destiny. Destiny doesn't exist, and I'm happy about that because if it is my destiny to live in a house with my homophobic father forever, I would rather die.
"What are you doing?" Steve asked, he didn't want to push her back down to make sure she stayed put. Natasha would probably beat the crap out of him, even in her injured state.
"Now isn't really a good time." He said. The creature had the look of a woman right now, and it wasn't wearing any clothes.
The billionaire made his way to the kitchen one morning. It was the first time he'd been in there since it all happened and Romanoff was in there with her breakfast. She looked at him.
"It's trying to escape!" It squawked. The creature launched itself at Tony, making Tony have to jump down from the top of the ladders very quicky. He fell straight into the sewage and so, luckily, wasn't injured. However, he did now have a look of disgust on his face.
"I don't have my licence. I just thought I would drive here so I didn't have to wait for my Dad again. The man is brutal." Tony said. I bit my lip. He was driving the car illegally. I suppose it is okay if it is just too and from school, but still- he should get his licence.
"Tony?" I asked. He didn't seem to hear me. He had in earphones. Of course he did. So I put my hand on his shoulder and he jumped.  He almost hit me.
It took a while for the meeting to finish, and the longer Tony was out of the room, the more Steve worried. He left it- and not being able to find Tony anywhere in the building- he returned back to the compound. Tony was there alright. It was frightning because Steve could hear his cries. He rushed to the younger/older males room. Was Tony older or younger? Literally he was younger than Steve but biologically he was older. Nevermind, Steve had gone to his room.
Tony watched as the tentacles rose up. He bit his lip and looked at it. It seemed preoccupied with attacking whatever was up above them, which he assumed was Steve. Then it slithered off down the gutter. Tony took a step forwards.
Steve lifted the lid which covered the sewer and Nat jumped down. He followed after her. They made a bit of a splash but the Jagkar weren't around to hear it. They didn't want to split up, but there was two directions to go. Nat went left and Steve went right. They were connected by coms. They weren't going to lose them like the others did.
"Hey. That girl of yours doing okay?" He asked. I didn't want to speak to him. "Are you ignoring me? Hey you okay? How'd you get that bruise on your face?" He was throwing questions at me. I was getting annoyed.
boy tried to catch a butterfly, and as he did, he started to cry as he had hurt it. Tony, of course had cheered him up. He let him know that it was just an accident and that it went to a better place when it died.
"I guess... I'm the leader then?" Tony sighed. The creature came closer to him. So close that he could feel her breath on his face. It put its hand on his face and turned it to look at him properly, as if inspecting him.
Clint was the one who noticed the green showing up on Bruce. He rushed towards Nat and grabbed her, running as quick as he could out of the building.
That shut Steve up. If he had to trust any shield agent it was Natasha. But only because he'd spent such a long time working along side her, and she had chosen to move in to the tower. She had become part of the Avengers family. He followed her to what seemed to be an abandoned factory, and then she walked inside. He thought about it, and assumed there would be a secret elevator or door or something in it, which led to a shield base. And he was right.
"Get off me. You helped her murder my children!" He said and stood up. He was hurting as he made his way out of the lab. He ran to the only place he could think of that was safe, and that was to Steve's room.
"Hey, what have you got there?" He asked. Tony trusted Steve. He showed him. Tony's face lit up. His eyes were sparkling and he had a smile that ranged from ear to ear. He looked like an innocent child. "Is that one of....?" Steve's question trailed off when he saw Romanoff come out of the kitchen going after Tony.
"Tony is the reason for this meeting." He said. He explained about the panic attack. He told everyone what had happened, and what had triggered it. He then went on to tell them that he needed affection. That him kissing him, calmed Tony down a lot. It was enough to get him to sleep. And so the plan was hatched. If the Avengers saw Tony acting a little strange,
"And if it becomes a monster?" She asked, "It's better we just keep it under lock and key for now. Make sure it doesn't hatch. Then there won't be any chance it'll turn into that disgusting creature."
Nat saw Steve land and rushed towards him. She shot at his foot, injuring it, but it got the thing off him. She helped him stand and they got away from whatever was trying to get them by jumping up onto a nearby roof top. They looked at the mess in front of them.
I made my way to class and sat down, praying the teacher wouldn't make me introduce myself. Funny enough they didn't even notice I was new. It's good that I know all the stuff they are teaching already. A normal person would have no chance at this. But knowing what to do, does not stop people from being dicks.
Tony didn't come into school. After not getting an answer for why we wouldn't work as a couple. Then I realised how homophobic his father was. The man would probably kill Tony if he found out he had a boyfriend. It made sense.
Bruce rushed as quickly as he could, but Natasha started to get a bit panicky. She laid Tony on the table and started the procedure herself.
"Hey there, Tones" She said. Tony looked at her with some cheese hanging out of his mouth. He looked adorable and Natasha giggled a little.
"Not happening. But Steve. If it makes you feel better... I'm quitting." I told him. People are so disrespectful when it comes to us prostitutes... Or jiggalos as the males are supposed to be called. First I got double penetrated by some morons- against my rules. Then that happened. What made it worse is the guy knew I got double penetrated. They must have been working together.
"Okay Clint, leave him alone now." A male said. I turned my head to him. He was like a God. His hair was like gold. His eyes were like the ocean. And don't get me started on his muscles. I knew I probably shouldn't get mixed up with him. He probably had tonnes of ladies lining up ready to date him. He had to be a popular lad.
And so we began. He wanted to dominate because he wanted me to be 'okay'. When he saw my ass, his mood dropped massively.
Steve rushed around from the back of the building and came in the front entrance also. His reaction was the same, if not worse than Nat's. He went next to her and then couldn't move. His feet was stuck. They were stood behind Clint and Bruce, who turned their head to look at Nat and Steve.
"Yeah I know." Clint said and stuck his fingers into the jar anyway. He did that when he had no intention on leaving any. Tony sipped at his coffee.
The inventor pulled down his jeans and boxers together, just far enough to let Bruce see his member. The doctor stared at it for a while.
I was in pain. I couldn't do it. I stayed sat down all day. And for the first time ever, I invited my client to my home. I just couldn't walk longer than to the door. This person is under the name 'old but sexy'. I don't usually know client's names, but that is for confidenciality. This person is aparently a virgin, but I am unsure as to if they are interested in dominating or being submissive. I don't mind which. Either way they will be gentle.
Clint opened his eyes. Everything was dark. His vision was burred. He shook his head to try and come to his senses only to feel a lot of pain. He let out a groan as he realised what had happened.
I stared at the 'bed' in front of me and zoned out. I had to. Usually I zone out but this was worse. I had to block out all my senses for this. I managed to do it, however, which means I don't remember what happened. I just know that both men got off with me, my ass felt sore as fuck and I couldn't walk afterwards. Hands were covered in liquid, as was dicks. I just assume I got fisted then double penetrated. Just the thought of it makes me shudder. And I have to work tomorrow aswell.
Steve's reaction was to look after Tony. This egg meant a lot to the man and so Steve was not going to let it be taken away from him.
A light was at the end of the tunnel. It reminded Steve of when people are dying and they go towards the light at the end of the tunnel. For a moment he thought he was dying, but he wasn't. He walked towards the light and came out onto stone floor with a river in front of him and the white building. He looked around.
Tony was still crying. He couldn't sit still long enough for the doctor to check his pulse or anything like that. Given what happened, the doctor needed to give him an ultrasound. Steve was in the doorway watching. He felt the need to make sure Tony was alright. He felt like this was some how his fault. Like, if he had got there sooner, Tony wouldn't be in this position right now.
"I'll teach it to be good. It could be an Avenger" Tony said, with a whimper. Steve looked between them.
By this point, Tony had pretty much forgotten the horrors of Pax. Patrick was the same spiecies as him, but Patrick was far more human than Jagkar. Well he was, until something happened.
"P-Pax" Tony said. The creature slipped in. It looked him up and down. Tony was in shock, he thought that Pax was dead. The creature pushed him, making him go flying and then started to move very quickly in the direction of Patrick. "PATRICK!" Tony yelled.
Every morning was the same. He'd drink his coffee. Clint would eat something of Hulks. Natasha would come in for her breakfast and ate it quickly before Hulk came crashing through. Hulk would then groan because his pickles were gone, or his peanut butter, or his gacamole. Then he'd go find Clint and chase him around the tower. And that would be when Steve made his way back to the tower. Thor was off world at the moment.
"Steve... Is this really what you want? I don't want to do it with you if you don't want to. You can have your money back."
I never knew what had happened between Steve and Tony, and frankly I didn't care. They were both my friends. I just wanted them to be okay and right now, Tony wasn't. I didn't know the guy well, but that didn't stop me from helping him.
Tony started to panic again.  Steve got it from that. There were a lot of men in the war that had to come home because they had similar symptoms. They were unfit to work.
"W-who?" He asked and the Jagkar ran to a river. Patrick let out a noise, but when he didn't drown he got even more confused.
"Yes please!" His eyes sparkled. He wanted to see Tony, just to apologise a million times and to make sure he was okay. Tony, of course, was okay. But Patrick did't know that yet. He didn't fully understand what had happened.
The kitchen was mostly quiet, apart from the eating competition which Thor was having with Hulk. They were seeing who could eat the most food in 10 minutes, when Hulk suddenly stopped and sniffed up.
"Are you okay, baby?" he asked. He sat up and looked at Tony. Tony just wiped more sweat from his forehead. "Tony?"
He punched again, and again, and again, until Pax wasn't conscious any more, and then he kept punching.
The Hulk showed himself, clothing tearing as the man went from a small, normal sized man to an over sized, muscular, green guy. Hulk let out the loudest roar possible and punched the ground before running over to Pax.
"Oh. She was nice. Not really my type though." I scratched my head. He then grabbed me by my collar and pinned me to the wall. He didn't scare me. He wasn't that strong.
"No. My parents know where I am." He said. He had a big smile on his face that made me want to both kiss him and hit him.
While looking after the egg, Tony had become childlike. Steve figured it was just his way of dealing with everything. While Tony was acting like a child, he wasn't thinking about what happened to him in the white mansion or what happened when the eggs were destroyed. Plus, he found his childish mannerisms to be adorable.
"Everything alright? You wanted me here. Wait, have you eaten anything today? Or had a drink? Why are you here? Why did you get me to come here?" Tony held his hand up.
The doctors lips roamed the billionaire's torso for what felt like forever. Tony's face was red, and his pants had become way too tight.
"Why don't you do some exercise for me." The man smirked and laughed. He man-handled Tony like he was some weak child in need of scholding, putting him on his back. Tony reached to grab the man's hand in an attempt to stop him.
The day ended and I was glad that it did. But when it was time to go home, my dad didn't come. I don't know what I was expecting. He was usually late to collect me from school. And so I sat and waited. Thirty minutes went by and I started to get bored. That's when Mr Perfect came out the school doors with his little boyfriend.
"I thought I was over that." He mumbled, hoping Steve didn't hear him. The pair had gone into the kitchen to get some much needed coffee.
"You don't have to bottle it up. I understand you know." He said and sat on Tony's bed near him. Tony didn't really respond to that. He was trying to bottle it up but his bottle was full so kept over flowing and it had holes in. He wasn't able to hold it in; he started to cry again.
He carried me to his motorbike and forced a helmet on to my head. I was sat there trying to take the helmet off when he started the engine. I had to quickly grab hold of his waist otherwise I would have gone flying. I started to roll curse words off the tip of my tongue. I was swearing like a sailor.
Tony looked happy. This was his child. After a few days more, it had grown too big for the incubator. The warmth had allowed it to grow. And now, it was also starting to look a bit like Tony. It had grown legs. In all honesty, it now looked like a child with a tentical tail. Tony loved it either way. To him, this was his little man. His child.
"Sluts shouldn't have rules. They should just be sluts." He said, backing me against the wall. His hands placed either side of me, trapping me.
So the client today likes to give me pain. I just never expected... I mean of course I expected it. My heart pounded. He tied up my body, making me unable to move. My body was bound to whatever bed this was. This guy was insane. Usually its just whips and spanking. Today he wanted a change.
"I never really thought about that. I just know I like you as a person. But you're the straight pretty boy that everyone likes at school and I-"
"Come on guys, I think it's best we do as it asks." He said and started to walk. The two other men followed but only because they saw what happened when it launched itself at Tony.
The egg was in an incubator. Tony watched it a lot. He watched it when he was eating (which wasn't as often as before, but Steve made sure to get at least one meal into him a day). He watched it while he was working, which was just him tinkering. The only time he didn't watch it was when he was asleep (or in the bathroom using the facilities).
"Go help Barton, I'll be okay." He said. She looked wary but she had to go help her friend. Afterall, he had a Hulk on top of him as well as a building. She rushed over and started to go through the rubble.
Nat had finished eating her breakfast and headed back to her room when the building started to creak. She heard it and rushed to Tony's lab.
Once again, she picked up a gun and started to shoot. Bruce was also still in the fight. He got up and started to shoot, until green started to show.
There was more water inside the door, but it was clean. It looked like it was being filtered.  She looked around. Everything was black for a while and then she slipped. Natasha fell through a hole and landed with a splash in a river. It was a river under water.  She swam along it, and was able to see the magnificent white building.
Tony had started to sink in the bath. He opened his eyes and quickly got out of the water, trying to avoid it. A towel wrapped around him tightly. He curled up in the corner of the room, staring at the tub full of water and shaking. He had never reacted to the memory of Afghanistan this way before. He put his head in his knees and let out a cry. It was a cry for help.
Tony awoke the next morning to me handing him coffee. He didn't speak. He just took it and drank it, then he showered and got dressed. I looked at him.
"Or perhaps it went to find another sewer cap." Was Nat's response. "Come on, we should go." She took his hand to help him up and then they ran, but where they were running too was another story.
"Don't. This is all my fault. I can't believe I let you know where it was." I spat. He looked hurt. I went to pick up my robot. "You're not my friend. You don't care about me. If you did- why did you show him where it was?"
"Sex. The Jagkar want sex. Gender does not matter, it just wants to get its tentacles up inside a human and lay its eggs. Once its eggs are laid, it'll get into a sort territorial mode and look after the host." Fury said. "It's how they breed."
Steve had just managed to get out the lift when it dropped. He let out a bit of a sigh of relief and picked up his shield. He looked to see which floor he was on. It was floor 56. He sighed and then heared a noise coming from the stair case. He went to check out and the noise. He saw Hulk falling many many floors and land on the floor. He decided to run down the stairs until he heard the building creak.
Who do you want next? I intend to get through the original Avengers before I move onto doing more people like three sums and orgies and stuff
Natasha couldn't fight any more. She was loosing a lot of blood. She put her hand over her injury and then struggled to her feet. Tearing her shirt, she put it over her shoulder and looked at everyone. Even though she was in a
"Try and touch it with your finger" He said. Tony lifted his arm and reached out. He completely missed about 4 times before he managed to put his finger on Bruces. Only it wasn't his finger tip, it was more the middle of his finger.
"Where are they?" Steve asked as Romanoff returned. She looked at him and sighed. She was going to shake her head but thats like saying they are dead.
"I really hoped you wouldn't be as awkward as the others." Then I remembered where I had seen this man before. He was in the news. Wanted for r*ping and murderering 4 prostitutes. I backed up from him.
Tony got dressed and looked around. 'Where is Steve?' he thought. Steve had gone out for a run earlier when they woke and hadn't returned. Usually, that meant he had a mission. And a mission meant Tony was alone. The bath hadn't calmed him so that meant he'd be heading to the lab.
"Nat. I don't like being called Natasha." I laughed. Suddenly I realised that I did need friends. And when Steve came in the classroom, guilt overcame me. I hadn't even realised he was in my class. He looked at me briefly and I frowned.
That gave Bruce chance to shoot at him, but Pax just whacked him away. Clint got back in the game and grabbed his bow. He lifted it up and shot an arrow. It went through 5 tentacles and then jabbed into Pax.
I think Nat is next, but if you want a different character just say. Characters not done so far is Thor, Bucky, Steve (technically) Nat, Loki, and I was thinking I could do Dr Strange too even though hes not an original Avenger.
Something about Steve. I was starting to really appreciate him. My heart pound in my chest when he is near me. Its unnerving, but I love it. I haven't felt this way about anyone in such a long time.
Coffee is next on the list. I have a strong coffee and wear an oversized jumper. I try to get comfortable and sit on a sofa. I look over at the mantle. 'Proof that Tony Stark has a heart'. That old arc reactor sits there. I haven't needed one of them for a while. But its proof of me having a heart. That is a symbol of who I used to be before I lost it all.
"Can I see your shoulder?" he asked. He wasn't going to give her chance to talk about the eggs. He'd already been asked to get rid of them by Steve, by Fury, by Clint, by Bruce, by Thor (because he came back to Earth). He wasn't ready to hear it from Natasha because she was probably the only one who could convince him to get rid of them, and he knew that.
It begun. Tony closed his eyes, feeling overwhelmed. He wanted it to stop. He felt wrong. Pax's tentacles rubbed at his ass, begging for entrance. There was tentacles sucking on his nipples. There was now a large tentacle sucking on his member. And several tentacles rubbing against his chest and stomach. Some were choking him. He had a few in his mouth now. He closed his eyes and whined. How uncomfortable he was, was showing in his face and it concerned all his friends watching.
"I love it. I wanna call it... What should I call it Patrick?" He asked with a smile. The small boy scrunched his face up and then energetically said:
"Yes, I understand master." Saying master hurt his soul. He was dominant...most of the time. It was rare he was a submissive person. Though, even when he was being submissive he never used the word master. He hated it. Pax shifted his body from a woman's to a mans. His eyes gleamed down at the billionaire who wasn't looking at him.
"Well, he's technically pregnant right now. You're telling a mother to abort her child." Nat was understanding Tony's side in this situation.
I rushed out of the room. This was stupid. I just couldn't. The classroom was awful. The corridors were awful. I found myself just sitting outside on a bench. But that didn't help when the bell rang for break.
"Well, if I don't know, then I don't know what im trying to stop it from getting." Steve told her. He was right, and she had to admit that.
"So these creatures want sex, right?" Nat said to Steve, who seemed really uncomfortable with the whole ordeal. "So that means its going to lay eggs in Tony." Steve's face grimaced.
Tony didn't recover quickly from what happened. The next few weeks were full of flashbacks and night terrors. His flashbacks turned into hullucinations and he would feel Pax on him. The Avengers all wanted him to be okay, but none more than Steve. Steve's golden heart kept an eye on Tony. He let him share a bed with him so he could sleep. At first it didn't work, but the more Steve comforted the man, the more comfortable Tony started to feel around him.
"Bucky wanted me to lose my virginity. So what is this like? I can't imagine it's very pleasant for you."
So Steve gave me a lift home. I was awkward when he came to my house. He wanted to make sure I was okay but I was nervous to let him in. My mother looked at me and sighed.
"I don't know. Something knocked JARVIS out. I can't get him back online." He said with a pit of worry coming out as he spoke. She put her hand on his shoulder.
They got everyone back quickly. Pax was taken into custody of shield and was going to be experimented on. They did not need to worry about him any more.
"Way to go dark, Steve." I laughed, trying to hide my emotions. I actually felt embarrassed right now. Upset and embarrassed. I felt vulnerable, like I had just walked into the street wearing no clothes. Exposed.
"Are shield going to be able to help?" He asked. Natasha didn't respond. "Romanoff?" He asked again.
The bathtub. Thats where he put me. He locked me in the bathroom, wouldn't let me out until I had washed. This was turning into some of the kinky jobs I have had in the past. Afterwards, he had laid out some pyjamas for me. I think this was all a scheme so he could keep an eye on me.
They ran. Oh how they ran. They needed to be there quickly. They had to stop Tony. For all they knew, it could have been Clint they had to stop, but they were 90% sure it would be Tony.
"You have to be joking. She is everyones type. Unless you're gay. Oh my God. You're a gay fag aren't you?"
"Fury says that if...he? Isn't dead, then they will come after Tony and Patrick." Natasha rubbed her hands together. Steve looked at her.
"You know youre going to have to put your hood down and take the sunglasses off right." I said. At that he climbed back in his car. I wouldn't let him close the door. "Show me." My instinct had kicked in. I knew something was wrong. He sighed and took his sunglasses off. His eye was bruised. I put my hand over my mouth.
Tony followed the creature. It knew what it wanted. It had made an alarm and summoned Bruce and Clint. When they were there the creature circled them. It was becoming intimidating.
"Let's see this Pepper then." He said. I pulled out my phone. Luckily, she was a good friend of mine so I had photos of her and me together. It was convincing for now. I would have to tell her later that we were fake dating though, and pray that she accepted it and stuck by me for this.
As much as Pax tried to block the Hulk's attacks, his strong punches came through and then Pax went flying into the wall. When he fell out there was a hole in it. He looked between the Hulk and the hole in the wall and hissed.
Steve looked around in his room. He had lost his wallet. Panic struck the males face as he couldn't find it.
Tony looked him up and down. All there was, was a load of tentacles. Tentacles slivered over Tony's body, rubbing on each sensitive part of it. Three over his penis and balls. Some little ones wriggling over his nipples. They were rubbing his legs, and stomach. His face had turned red. As much as he hated this, it felt good. He grew hard really quickly. He had never had every sensitive part of him touched at the same time before.
"Oh it's nothing. Your father is just being... Well he's being your father. How was school?" She asked. She looked at my face and checked over my black eye.
