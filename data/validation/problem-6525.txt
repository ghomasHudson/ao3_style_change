,” he whined as soon as the door closed behind them. He dropped his plate of food on the workbench and shuffled immediately for the bed, where he belly-flopped with a groan.
“Perfect,” Tony murmured against the flushed head of Steve’s cock, and he lapped up the gush of precum with a playful enthusiasm before parting his lips and smoothly swallowing him down.
Tony could not bring himself to stop smiling. The evening at the Christmas market had gone so well, and their night in the palace kitchen had been even better. The crowd had been intimidating at first, but Steve had been at his side from the start, and most people would only bow and smile as they passed. It had been a happy surprise to learn that while most adults did not say more to them that ‘good evening, your Majesties,’ the children were enamored. They all gravitated towards Steve, and they so openly adored him that Tony’s heart had ached with joy to watch Steve picking up one child after another, hugging them and posing for pictures without complaint.
“Tony,” Steve said in a quiet voice, interrupting Tony’s righteous protective streak. “Before… before you do all that,” he continued once he had Tony’s full attention again. “What if… uh. Um. What if?”
He shuffled into work late, where he received Friday’s third gift between his last bacon roll and second dose of paracetamol. As if the hangover and missed calls from Steve weren’t enough, his next gift was none other than Bond, James Bond.
Tony was quick to agree, and, together, they went back to the truck to grab Steve’s luggage before making their way to Tony’s room. It took a moment for Steve to realize nothing they were passing on their way there looked familiar.
“Still processing,” Tony murmured, then cautiously reached to smooth his fingers over the curve of Steve’s left pec, tracing its firm but obscured contour over his chest hair.
“No, I don’t have a jet anymore. It was Howard’s jet,” Tony said with a wry expression. “I’m… between homes at the moment. I—you just started your job here and I thought, you know. If there was a chance, I’d find a place here. But, maybe LA? I’ve heard it’s nice, it’s sunny. Geneva’s… it rains, a lot. It, um,” his voice grew quieter with every word, until he finally lost his voice and looked down at his hands. He gave himself a shake, took a deep breath, and looked back at Steve. “Okay, no. I can’t do this right now. I’ll just go pay.”
“Fifty dollars for a jockstrap?” Steve muttered to himself as he inspected something garish and glittery (a description he’d only now learned wasn’t inherently redundant). Whoever Neiman Marcus was, he clearly was out to personally offend him. “It won’t even hold an avocado.”
“Got the hole patched up, it’s all good. Luckily, no mold,” Clint clarified. “That would’ve been a nightmare.”
Steve frowned a little in confusion, and without shrugging or leaning out of Tony’s arms, he lifted his head to look at Maria, and then Clint, over Tony’s shoulder.
“Six, I think,” Steve said with a smile, and when Seamus rolled over for belly rubs, Steve rubbed his big hand down his dog’s flanks with notable pride. “The people who dropped him off at the shelter said he’d been this old woman’s support dog, but she’d had a stroke and had to be moved into a home that didn’t allow dogs. Her family couldn’t keep him. So, when I got him two years ago, we started doing this. The whole service role he was trained to do, you know?”
“I really hated you, for a while,” Steve told him from the kitchenette. His back was still turned while he puttered around, and Tony stood in the small entryway of the room, watching him from a distance without adding a word to the conversation yet. Eventually, Steve came back with two cups of coffee. “You made my life a living hell. Hate mail, phone calls—people were calling my mother, Tony, do you understand how scary that is?”
Steve closed his mouth before he asked where that was. “Thanks,” he said instead, “Where do I pick up the social events calendar?”
“A lot of people treat it as another adulting milestone,” Steve said as he sat back in his seat, watching Tony rinse off their dinner plates before putting them away in the dishwasher. “They probably think about marriage like it’s another superyacht, and they don’t understand why you’re not interested in the superyacht, too.”
“Your cello solo last night was inspiring,” they heard him tell one of the women. He sounded hopeful and overeager as he hesitantly asked her out; blood in the water for most overachieving women. Steve and Maria slowed to a halt in the shadows and listened as the women laughed and called Phil a dork.
“I am glad to hear that, Mr. Rogers,” Hawley said and came around to take a seat in a chair opposite him. “Your intuition about the case has been helpful to the case so far, it would be to the detriment of the case to see you go. In fact, I have been impressed with how you’ve handled yourself so far,” she smiled, leaning a little closer until their knees nearly touched. “And this… misstep can be corrected easily. That’s why I asked to see you today.”
“Call Banner, tell him we’re coming to the lab right now,” Steve told his partner just as he was digging out his own phone. The block was crawling with cops, and he was thankfully put through to a black and white who was very eager to start her morning by plowing through every red light to get them back to the station in record time.
“Keep your pants on!” Steve called back as he pulled on a t-shirt and some sweats before getting the door.
“And here we thought we were being quite clever,” Bucky admitted with a sarcastic, feigned ignorance. “If you do use a ghostwriter, you can stick around and finish your signing, and probably sell hundreds of your latest bodice ripper—”
Whether Steve was giving in to his possessive or protective streak didn’t matter, because he never failed to reduce Tony to a hot, giddy mess. Tony would invite his touch and hold him close any way he could, whether he’d squeeze his legs around Steve’s waist, curl his arms around Steve’s neck, or as on one memorable occasion, smack Steve in the face and hold on to his hair.
“Whoa, buddy,” he snickered, more tickled than bothered by Tony’s minor meltdown, “did you give your car to the wrong agent or what?”
Tony shut his mouth in the middle of his rambling, and as miserable as he looked, there was a glimmer of gratitude in his eyes.
Since Steve’s first appointment was in the afternoon, he made a video of his morning for Tony. He watched the sunrise rise over the Seoul skyline from the comfort of a jacuzzi big enough to stretch his legs in. The breakfast feast was unlike anything Steve had seen. In his childhood, cheese, eggs, and nuts had been his typical breakfast, and he had come to love the addition of cold cuts, bread, and vegetables from Machtberg’s customs. Rice and short ribs were so unexpected that he couldn’t help but tell Tony about it, and he tried everything - the seafood salad, the spicy stewed fish, the cold cucumber soup - and told Tony how it was.
“I hope you’re hungry,” Tony said and pulled the door open to let Steve in first. The hostess didn’t even ask for names or a reservation once Tony walked in, and simply asked them to follow her.
“It is the least we can do,” Steve corrected gently, and watched as Tony’s smile visibly grew steadier and more relieved. “We will spend the first night with our people, but in the morning, if no emergencies interfere, we retire and rest in private. Agreed?”
“We live in a cottage in a swamp,” Clint announced in the silence. “A stinky-ass swamp where two sewers dump into the river.”
“That’s what you want?” Steve mumbled with a loopy, delirious wonder, but he obliged Tony and eased his weight down on top of him and pressed his hips flush against Tony’s ass. “Don’t worry, babe. ‘m not going anywhere.”
“Text me when you're home safe,” Thor replied, making Tony almost feel bad about his most recent thoughts.
“That is not how the archival discs commemorate his sacrifice, Jane Foster. Crossbones was an evil unimaginable even in their period for unthinkable crimes. He was not like Johann Schmidt, with his clear, if disturbing, agenda. If these archival discs are to be believed, then Crossbones taunted the Captain; he rejoiced in his own crimes! Violence was pleasurable to him. How a man so far out of his time would react to such lunacy… it is impossible to guess, Jane Foster, even when a man is as brave and valiant as the good Captain. But to the rumored circumstances of his imprisonment, I have no answers. Only gold class officers have sanctioned access to the case files, including the sentencing statements of our extraordinary Captain America.”
“But dad ate everything,” Steve replied, sitting down on the edge of his desk before someone caught him pacing like a fool. “He made the best grilled cheese sandwiches. With the pears.”
“Because he’s one of my best friends and I just hate to see him hurt. And you know how much Thor hates it when I’m upset,” she told him with a childlike innocence that did nothing to conceal her very real and very serious threat to his person.
He should have been upset when MIT lost, but it was so difficult to care when Steve had done so well.
“You got this, Tony. Let’s get two more puppies,” Steve stage whispered as he hauled the rotund little Mango (who had tried to engage Violet into playing) up into the air. “Hello, you monster! She doesn’t want to play right now, sweetheart, you’re stuck with me!” he laughed as Mango squirmed with excitement and eventually sat him down on his other side where Steve could pet him and Mango couldn’t bother Violet.
“You would do that?” Steve blurted out, then with a shake of his head, he tried again. “I mean, I thought you could not physically touch another person.”
Carol was a marvel. A living, breathing marvel. Steve was delivered to Tony’s dorm within the hour, fed and showered and ready to tumble into bed.
“It’s so good to talk to you,” Steve admitted softly, gazing at him through his lashes and watching the interest in Brock’s eyes turn into lustful hunger. “We’ve barely spent any time together since we got here.”
In this chapter, I'm going to give you an outline of what would happen (both in 'Present day' and future dates) so you can enjoy the already written finale at the end.
A few minutes into his shower, Steve could feel the fog lifting. Finally, he was waking up. He rushed through a shower, dried off as best as he could. Underwear went on first, then a comfortable grey long sleeved tee that he mostly hid under a sky blue thick-knit sweater. He was digging out his shoes when there was a knock on his door.
, when it upheld a ban on federal funding for abortion. The burden of ‘privacy’ fell on poor women’s shoulders.”
“He was beheaded outside a building down that street,” Tony told him, keeping his voice low since Steve was already so close. “There’s a guard’s house where the clock face is smudged over the 2 because that’s when Charles was executed.”
“Famous last words,” Tony with an exaggerated sigh, but as Sarah got up with her half-full glass and her album safely tucked under her arm, mischief warmed in his eyes as he watched the Rogers go head to head.
“You’re home,” Steve whispered against his ear once he was buried to the hilt in Tony’s body. He adjusted carefully, rolling his hips experimentally to learn different angles and new ways he could make Tony cry and whimper on his cock. With one leg pinned between their bodies, Tony body was already stretched to the point of pain, but Steve was a quick study, and with every slow, controlled rocking of his hips, Steve found new combinations and tricks to draw delirious, fluttering whimpers of pleasure from Tony’s lips.
“I’ll follow up with them,” Tony told them, already shrugging out of his jacket to take his seat. “You got the profile ready?” he asked Natasha.
“Anyone who can give consent and who our readers can relate to,” Tony replied for lack of a better answer. “I’m not trying to fall in love, I just need two or three dates.”
“I don’t—uh,” Tony floundered, visibly struggling to find the words. “I didn’t mean for that to happen, Steve, I promise. Yesterday wasn’t some grand scheme to rope you into marriage. I wanted to show you the lighthouse chapel and then ask you out for a date sometime after the case, maybe to dinner somewhere on the water or, but I guess - all those young people in love, and your smile in the moonlight, I, I—”
But Tony didn’t look as calm as he sounded. If anything, he looked tired and anxious, like he was waiting for the final blow to come any second.
Tony blinked after him while Steve slid down Tony’s body. “It’s your turn?” Tony echoed, his breath catching his throat as he watched Steve kiss his way down Tony’s abdomen, raising goosebumps with his teeth.
“I…” he started to say, but no words seemed to follow. He reminded himself of Jane’s advice, and as politely as he could, he stuck to the truth. “I’m afraid nothing caught my eye. Would it be possible to order off the menu?”
you talked to our parents. The same parents who never agree on anything except that one time they wanted us to live in a winnebago so we’d always ‘be home’ when we moved to different sets? You’re light-years past overthinking.”
“What do you want, my tax returns?” Steve bit out, then pursed his lips again as he reminded himself to keep calm. If he wanted to count this a win, he needed to keep a cool head. “I assure you, I have enough money for a good life for a long, long time.”
“He was feeding my pony sugar and oats,” Tony stage-whispered from Steve’s right, unwilling to let Clint have full control of the story. “I was racing that day, he sabotaged me.”
Tony opened his mouth to speak, then shut it with an audible click. Then, in a fit of bewilderment, he asked, “How does Winter Wonderland know who Kim Cattrall is?”
“What’s he done to you?” Bucky muttered with a borderline homicidal concern, and on Steve’s right, Sam was just shaking his head with a frown.
“Steve, Sharon was my girlfriend at prep school,” Brock explained. “We got back together over the summer at my grandmother’s birthday party.”
Steve startled out of his reverie when he heard Clint’s voice from the general direction of the front door. He made his way back through the labyrinth hallways, through the sitting room, and found Clint still standing in the foyer.
“Is it true that the preeminent Captain America would help the elderly cross the road despite the increased risk of potential traffic-related injuries?” Jane whispered, spellbound. “My father, Raymond Foster, may he rest in peace, would many nights tell me of the good Captain’s heroism as nighttime stories. The stories recounted his great acts of heroism, how he could climb trees without fear of injury to collect frightened kittens, and even communicate with the French.”
But despite their people’s continued blessings, the King and Queen were repeatedly denied the gift they wanted above all. As the years passed, the king’s counsel grew more explicit in their advice to find a new Queen, one who could provide a healthy heir. On every occasion, the King refused.
“But,” Stephanie continued, albeit uncomfortably. “She wants me to bear her a child as soon as possible, a daughter. She suggested I consider one of you as the man, but she has accepted that I will only ask you and give you the choice. If you do not wish to make me with child, you will be released and be free, unharmed.”
Steve was finished with his midterms by Tuesday, 1pm. He had nowhere to go. Nobody was waiting to celebrate the end of midterms with him, nobody was waiting to hold him after days apart. Steve adored his friends and they each had their place in his life, but Tony had a knack for making even the worst test feel like a victory. At the very least, he would say it was
Tony stared at her. He couldn’t tell what was worse: that he was about to be caught out in his own lie, or that she had known of such a specimen and failed to hook him up. And she called herself his friend??
“Alright, looks like there’s a tie here, guys, so it’s going to go to the tie breaker. Do you think you’re ready?”
“I can help,” he offered, without knowing anything about fences. It was almost worth it to see Tony blinking wildly in surprise.
“I’ll be right here, Tony,” Steve promised, “whatever happens, I will be here, standing beside you.”
“I can’t do this with you again, Tony,” Steve still managed to say, keeping his tone gentle. “You didn’t trust me. You weren’t honest. I asked you, Tony, so many times. I asked you to tell me what was wrong; I knew something was wrong, and you denied it. To my face. You told me it was your defense, or Dum-E. You lied to me because you decided I couldn’t help you,” Steve finished, pulling all of his frustrations into one sentence. “You didn’t even give me a chance.”
The question surprised Tony enough to take his attention away from the scenery, and he looked up at Steve with a questioning look. “Yeah, you had a concussion the day before from a motorcycle stunt,” Tony recalled easily. “We stayed in and had a DIY spa day and watched
“By your own account, you have not met anyone whom you are willing to trust in eight years. In all the time you have been away from home,” Dr. Odinson summarized. “How does that make you feel, Tony?”
“No, these appointments are for you,” Happy told him with a hint of impatience. Finally, when Steve had stood in the same place for too long, he reached over and pushed Steve aside so he could close the passenger door.
Steve’s head snapped around so fast Tony almost felt a vicarious whiplash. Tony cringed—he knew where this conversation was going, and he wasn’t sure he liked it. “I think I’ve heard of this,” he admitted with a queasy smile.
Steve slowed his steps, and for the first time since the incidental connection in the car, he turned to look at Tony. He smiled, but it was not a kind smile. Irony, perhaps, or what the 21st century historians would have called 'sarcasm'. Tony couldn’t be sure.
“I was just,” Tony said instead, searching for words, “surprised. Is this—are you alright with this?”
“I used to be like you, too: the science always came first, publications and figuring out - well, everything, but Thor isn’t getting in the way of that, it’s just different now. I promise, it only gets better when you have someone to share it with.”
Steve didn’t acknowledge his response at first. He gazed up at Tony instead, as if searching for an answer other than what Tony had given him. Tony found himself unable to look away. Gently, he curled his fingers against Steve’s cheek, sweeping his thumb reverently over Steve’s temple.
“Motherfucker, you lost my car in a fucking card game?” he hissed through gritted teeth. To hell with first impressions. “The fob is the tracker, Bond!”
“It goes with the theme of the day,” Steve muttered with a wry grin on his lips. Steve’s smiles were usually irresistible, but this time Tony found he couldn’t smile back. Spending dozens of hours a week for months on the receiving end of Steve’s expressions, from the subtle to the heartbreaking, he had considered himself quite confident navigating his friend’s moods and faces.
A tension seemed to snap something deep within his partner, and Bruce viciously shoved away from Tony's desk to stomp back to his own side. “Do not patronize me, Tony Stark!” Bruce snarled, and distantly, the chipper voice of the morality box notified Bruce that he had been fined three credits for excessive aggression in the workplace.
“Did, um,” Steve started to say as his eyes caught on the golden ring on Tony’s hand. His question seemed redundant now, but he needed to ask it. “Did we get married last night?”
“Oh my god, we haven’t even gotten to the shoes yet,” Tony moaned through gritted teeth, then took a deep breath and tried again. In his most reasonable, rational voice, he said, “Remember why we’re doing this, Steve: there’s a man - or a group of men - out there, taking advantage of young men’s dreams in order to
“How come you did not wish for her to visit?” Tony wondered. Orfeo shrugged uncomfortably and looked down at his hands in his lap, color rising in his cheeks and up his neck.
He was slowly talking himself into bundling up in the reading nook for the rest of the day where he could enjoy the flowers when a black car pulled up beside him on the street and rolled along at his pace.
“Just skimming for the sexy parts… that last one had you jumping naked into a vat of milk,” Tony reported, though as the sound of turning pages started up again, he became a little more distracted. “I’d pay good money to see that, que rico.”
“I thought it would let me sneak in to see you, but I’ll develop it for skin grafts. With a little work, it could be, uh. Useful,” Tony finished his confession lamely, clearing his throat to sound less obviously embarrassed by the plan. He did his best to keep his eyes on the mask and away from Steve’s sharp eyes, because the last thing he needed was for Steve to laugh at him. They hadn’t known each other that long, and this was only their second night together. Being laughed at was not on the night’s agenda.
“Talk to me,” Steve begged, swallowing down against the swelling lump of tears threatening to choke him. This was Tony, he tried to tell himself, it was no-one else.
Tony’s expression warmed with a big smile, as if he had a reason to be proud of Steve’s transformation. “It was your rehabilitation during Cryostasis, Steve Rogers. Using the genetic traits of each inmate, the computers identify a skill or trade you are predisposed to excel in that is also projected to be most useful to society at the time in which you are released. Once this skill is identified, the rehabilitation program implants and nurtures each inmate with the knowledge and desire to carry out their training so that when they are released into society again, they can become successful, independent, and contributing citizens once again.”
Brock hadn’t said a word in his defense, not a single word. Steve couldn’t believe it; the guy who’d been there for him through thick and thin for years, driving through hours of traffic in the rain just to get Steve his favorite soup when he was sick or staying up with Steve through the night when Steve felt too anxious about an upcoming shoot. What was it about this place that had turned him into such an unreliable asshole?
“No!” Tony cried as Steve moved to get up, “Steve, damnit—no, this is plenty. End of discussion. So, uh. I’ll go deposit this?” he stalled briefly, and Steve savored his victory. In his rush to stop Steve from giving him
Tony glanced back at Bruce, who was at a loss for what to say, and the Chief Director, who was running low on patience. In the end, there was nothing Tony could do but face Steve again and say it even more plainly.
“Lucy’s stealth technology is the first of its kind. If we lose her, she’s lost forever, do you understand? She’s our only working prototype. I can’t even track it; that technology gets into the wrong hands, we’re screwed. Is that clear?”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Steve whispered, carefully lifting Tony off his lap before sliding out from under him.
People barely noticed them when they joined the market. They were as noteworthy as any other couple without blue sashes or ermine to decorate their respective wool coats, and instead of shiny designer shoes, they wore sturdy boots made for the winter weather. Tony had even indulged in wearing his old red and gold scarf that his mother had knitted for him while she was pregnant. They told him she had worked on it a little bit every day since she learned she was expecting, and she wanted her son to know how long she had thought of him and waited to see him.
“He is real,” Tony interjected firmly, clasping his hands behind his back before anyone noticed how his fingers curled into agitated fists. “Captain America is legendary, but he is no legend. He is flesh and blood, a mortal man like you and me. He is currently in Cryo, where he is serving 10 consecutive lifetimes for involuntary manslaughter he most regrettably was responsible for in the events leading to his capture of Brock Rumlow. However,” he added as concerned murmurs spread around the room, “there is no man better suited to apprehending this vile criminal. Chief, it is within your power to reinstate the good Captain. We cannot overlook this advantage, sir. I implore you to give Captain America a chance.”
“Tony, you asked me not to come or watch it live on TV,” Steve reminded him in a gentler tone, “and I promised I won’t. Unless there’s some freak acci—”
Steve didn’t have the energy to be outraged or horrified by the suggestion of cheating. He’d been trying to do this homework since he finished his dialogue interpretation assignment for comms, after coming home from his French discussion section. He was so worn down that even cheating sounded reasonable.
“Oh,” Tony whispered after a quiet pause, then turned on his heel to find the kitchenette. “Just, thirsty. Forgot my water. Is it cool if I—”
“You can stand up, you know,” Tony said instead of answering him. “He can’t climb in through the window, he can only reach a few feet.”
Luckily, Steve had already turned back to his notes on his own laptop, so he was the only one around the table who missed the way Tony openly mooned over him, deeply fond and miserably crestfallen at the same time.
The Graekol had moved on to discussing the typical reasons why private harvests often failed to deliver the safety and dependability of industrially harvested products, and Steve listened attentively even as he held Tony by the hair and leisurely rocked his hips to fuck Tony’s throat. He paused now and then when he hadn’t felt Tony exhale for some time, holding Tony’s face down against his crotch until Tony made a big show of breathing in and out through his nose so Steve would resume his thrusts.
“What better time to learn?” Tony countered happily, gesturing at the wide open road. The I-90 ran one lane north and one lane south, and the highway was practically abandoned. “No passing, no merging, no clutch. Just point and click. Besides, it’s a rental: we’re insured to the gills.”
“People go through the roof when gas prices get close to three dollars per gallon, meanwhile, this shit is—is, what, 90—no, 88 dollars per gallon! Who does that!”
“How was the market?” he asked the table at large, since it had been a new experience for nearly all of them. “How was the food?”
There was no reason for Captain America to know anything about him, but Tony didn’t care. All that mattered was that he wanted Tony. After all these years of people thinking he was too strange, his hobbies uncouth and his excitement uncivilized, somebody was finally interested in Tony as their steward.
She laughed in delighted surprise, and happily took one of his offered fries. “I’m Amanda, it’s nice to meet you, too, Tony.”
There was only so much spontaneity he was afforded in his life, but this was too good to deny. He couldn’t even know how Steve would react, he only knew he had to try.
Steve frowned at the thought, finding himself feeling bad for baby Tony. Tony probably never had to worry about whether adults fighting would lead to him being kicked out of the house, but that didn’t mean the fights weren’t scarring.
“I know, babe. I want to,” Tony assured him with an easy smile in his voice, and Steve pressed his face into a warm towel so Tony wouldn’t possibly hear his blush. “My schedule is flexible on Tuesday, the zoo trip is no problem. But, for Thursday,” he continued, a little less enthusiastic, “could we maybe do it on the weekend? I have a big meeting Friday morning.”
“Not in the class, but when I got back to my room I was a mess. She could make your blood run cold in your veins if she wanted to.”
Steve moaned in complaint while Tony laughed. “Easy!” he said with a cocksure grin that distracted Steve from the adorable blue merle puppy long enough to slant Tony a long suffering look. “He was a background student athlete in
Steve blinked at the beige locker room wall. He’d already had a long Saturday running errands and getting his life in order, and he had just spent forty minutes tearing up his shoulders. All he wanted to do was go home to indulge in a long, hot bath and an ice cold compress.
Steve couldn’t go rogue, he just couldn’t. Pissed as he was, the thought of one double-oh pitted against another made Tony want to tie Steve down and never let him leave. He wasn’t ready to give up the privilege of shouting at Steve for being an asshole yet.
“They are dead,” Tony whispered, his words breaking and borderline hysterical in his shock. “So many dead.”
supposed to get attached? Come on! The definition of irony, you know how crazy—but Steve, I’ve had more fun with you; watching you freaking out over the Rangers? I could barely watch the game, you—”
“Then what? Ya no me quieres?” he demanded, looking down at himself in anger. “This is only what seventeen pounds of muscle looks like, Steve; are you going to dump me before we even get to thirty?”
“Only with people who want to kiss me or punch me,” Tony purred, practically bragging. “And you don’t seem that violent to me.”
“No,” Tony insisted, thumbing over to his contacts and scrolling down the list for Annelise’s number. “I’ll—I’ll outbid the other guy, or, I don’t know, I’ll buy it,” Tony muttered to himself with a self-deprecating grimace. “Why didn’t I fucking buy it last year? Steve loved that place—Annelise, hi.”
“You asshole!” he laughed, sitting up so suddenly that the horse startled back and withdrew from the window. “Get in here, Dummy! Come on,” he called after the horse with a smile in his voice; it wasn’t long before the horse nickered and nudged the windows open again, sticking its head into the room to nuzzle into Tony’s waiting arms. “You’re dumber than a bucket of wheat, but your nose sure works.”
“It’s that way,” Tony whispered, jerking his chin to the right. “Hot tub’s a bad idea baby, lube won’t work and I’ll never forgive you if you make me wait, Steve, please—”
Steve stared down at the index cards in his hands, and tried not to think about all the generations who would have enjoyed these precise recipes. The task she had left him with, however, was fairly straight forward. He shook himself out of the stupor, and focused on his work.
But for Bucky, the world had suddenly turned very, very cold. There was an urgency to the situation that he didn’t want Steve to hear, but as his friend, there was no way to avoid it either.
Steve returned to bed with a travel size tube of lubricant and a small box of condoms that he sat down on Tony’s bedside table. “No judgement,” Steve promised with a little smile when he climbed back into bed, pressing himself against Tony’s side this time.
Friedstadt was the highest city in old Machtberg, built on a mountain peak made hospitable by a natural spring. Despite the altitude, it had been one of the earliest cities that attracted large numbers of immigrating families from old Terrini. Many of the early families were goat farmers who brought their livestock with them, and the goats, with their sure footing and stubborn attitudes, thrived in the lush, mountainous landscape around Friedstadt. Like many cities in Machtberg, Friedstadt historically struggled to develop a local agriculture - people were highly educated and unaccustomed to farming, particularly in such mountainous terrain. The families from old Terrini brought with them generations of practical wisdom, and soon after their arrival Friedstadt had local access to nutritious crops and fresh eggs, dairy, and meat.
There was a pause on the other end of the line. Steve’s heartbeat sounded like war drums in his ears. Why was he so invested in hearing Tony deny it? The guy sounded nice, and genuinely fun—he
“...I could use some good news,” Steve admitted, albeit cautiously. Everyone knew you started with the bad news, but if Steve got thirty seconds to pretend everything was fine and Tony only had good news to share, why deny himself? He had the rest of his life for bad news.
“But,” Clint protested, and helplessly he tried to gesture at the peacefully napping dragon. “Are you kidding me? You have a dragon! Nobody would dare harm us; she is terrifying.”
“I love you, Tony,” Steve whispered, a confession that under any other circumstances would have left Tony elated and so deeply relieved. He had not been brave enough to speak those words yet in his lifetime. “Every chance to see you, to share in your life, it brings me unspeakable joy. But I am not meant to see you,” he finished in a quiet, tired voice. “And I am not meant to share in your life. We can’t do this forever.”
“Three fingers and you’re still so tight,” Steve groaned in his awe, changing his grip to pull Tony’s hole open by his middle and fore- fingers. Tony could only bite down on his fist to muffle his grunts of pain, silencing himself to let Steve look his fill, but somehow Steve noticed. He slackened his grip immediately and asked how Tony was, promising he’d be more careful. Before Tony could assure Steve that he was fine, that the pain was a good pain, Steve slipped his hands down to cup and squeeze the meat of Tony’s ass, gently spreading him open for a less invasive treat.
As if on cue, a seating chart was passed to Steve by the girl on his left, and he realized with a rising concern that he was signing to make his front-row seat a permanent commitment. Steve was still signing in as he felt the attention in the room shift towards him. He looked up, and once again Professor Stromwell was staring back at him.
His arms were raised directly over his head in a matter of seconds. The machine worked more slowly in adjusting his legs, turning him first to angle his hips down. That first step had been relatively easy, but Tony gasped at the pinch of discomfort and pain as the cuffs folded his legs and tucked his thighs against his torso. Inch for inch it raised his legs further. It didn’t matter how Tony pushed against the cuffs, the machine was too strong for his body, and soon his knees nudged up against his shoulders as if it was a natural position to lie in.
“Anything,” Tony said simply, though he said it without a smirk of amusement Steve would have expected. As if
But Tony disagreed. “No, he’s right, it is a serious question,” he said, then he turned to answer Bucky. “Doing anything about dinosaurs is guesswork, which is a lazy way of saying ‘developing theories based on observations of animals in similar environments.’ Penises are surprisingly important to the four F’s of evolution: feeding, fleeing, fighting, and making love.”
“I’m calling you now, doesn’t that count for something?” he asked casually. “Can I assume you’re still in London?”
“Welcome everyone! All settled? Drinks at the ready as we make our introductions. You see, Miriam has a thing,” he explained, both to the audience and to the three men on the couch. “She doesn’t like to know who she’s coming on with, it keeps things interesting. How are you doing tonight, Miriam?”
“What is this, Tony?” Steve asked even as he sat the bags down on his desk to snoop around. One was stuffed with chicken wings and Chinese food containers, and the other had two six packs of beer. “You carried all of this up from the parking lot? Tony—”
By the third morning, the abrupt change in Tony’s routine left him aching to come. Every morning he begged for release until Steve fed him from his cock, placating Tony despite his frustrated misery. At night, if Steve was away or unable to come again, Tony rubbed off against the cushions of their nest until he fell asleep.
“Steve, Steve Rogers, how could I forget?” Tony laughed, his voice honeyed and deep. It sounded grounded and gentle, and so very different from the caffeine fueled anxiety Steve had met earlier in the week. “You were my lucky star, Steve. What the hell did you do?”
“I think you should just go call him, Stevie,” Bucky cut in before either Sarah or Jenna continued that line of thought, and Steve couldn’t agree more. Anything to get out of the conversation.
“Don’t you think I know that?” Tony cried, then shut his mouth and ran a hand through his hair. When he seemed to have pulled himself together, he continued. “I know I was an asshole. I was hurtful and manipulative. A liar.”
“And if what we hear about Mächtingen is true, maybe we can encourage them to address the anxiety and emotional strain of their daily lives. Once a rail connects Machtberg to Terrini, it would be easy for all to escape the congestion of the city. Visit the coast, the islands. And inland we have many lakes and rivers, beautiful old villas that are now too expensive for locals to own but which can be repurposed for tourist lodging. Provide local jobs and create new forms of capital.”
Steve took a moment to process what he heard and barely had the time to groan before Tony startled him by drumming the most obnoxious tattoo against the doorframe.
“Just because it’s going fast doesn’t mean it’s not where I want to be,” he said with the deep-seated conviction that sent shivers tingling down Tony’s spine. “I don’t like uncertainty, and I know what I want. I’m not interested in playing any unnecessary games about being hard to get or, or to test you somehow. You’ve been there for me when I’ve needed you,” he added, more quietly. “I know a good man when I see one.”
“He can hold his breath for three and a half minutes,” Tony told her anyway. Carol stared into the middle distance and tried to ignore him as he continued elaborating. “We timed it. For science. I only took two minutes and twenty-four se—”
Off-screen, Steve could be self-deprecating, and Tony had seen him genuinely angry, frustrated, or upset plenty of times; this was none of those. On a number of occasions, Tony had even seen Steve toe the line between glum and something worse. Fortunately, this wasn’t that either.
Steve’s brows quirked in question since that was a little out of his overview of the company, but he couldn’t help smiling at how pleasantly surprised Tony seemed. Before he could ask anything further, however, Howard spoke.
The audience laughed, but there were a handful of people who audibly gasped. Without thinking, Steve turned in the direction where he thought they came from and smiled shamelessly.
Tony blinked slow, heavy eyelids until he could level a reeking glare at his co-star. “This might be my first promotional tour, but I’ve pulled all nighters before, Rogers. Get out of my way.”
They had told him that sex was illegal, and there was no doubt in Steve’s mind that Tony would never stray from this Governor-for-life’s outlined way of life. But maybe ‘sex’ only extended to reproductive sex, and same-sex couples were not denied the natural pleasures consenting adults could enjoy together.
“He saw right through me, Tony—what was I thinking, going into that meeting without any planning? Peggy called and told me to go, so I said yes, and I blew it.”
“You live in a cottage?” she whispered after a long silence, a buoyant wonder lifting her voice, and even Tony’s spirit. Any fear or shame he felt in thinking she would find the very idea of living in a swamp revolting was forgotten, and he watched her with a budding hope he hadn’t dared to feel for a long, long time.
“Let me touch you, sweetheart, please,” Steve whispered, reaching with his fingers to stroke up and down the exposed cleft of Tony’s ass. His cock was already hard between them, the head wet with precum; it would have been so easy to take what he wanted.
“One moment,” Steve told Bucky quietly. T’Challa was still introducing the subject of sustainable agriculture in Wakanda. There was plenty, it seemed, that Steve would have to talk to him about later, and he took the time to finish jotting his thoughts down for later reference.
This time when Steve led him into his place, they went to the living room first. Steve made sure they sat down; sitting seemed very important to him in this moment, except he couldn’t seem to sit still for very long himself.
Tony blinked at him, then turned in his seat to look at the date. “... fucking shit—it’s Friday?” he breathed, then immediately turned back to Steve, wide-eyed in his regret. “Steve, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean—”
“Come on,” he said after they had let the mourning go on long enough. “Listen. Thor. Sure she broke your heart, but if you think I’m going to let you lose your job over her, too, you’re down shit creek without a canoe. You’re going to take a shower. You’re going to look and smell out of this world; not for her, but for you, because you deserve it. You got it? I need you to get on your feet, Point Break, chop chop: we’re doing this right now.”
“Welcome to Taco Bell!” a young woman behind the counter greeted him with false cheer. “May I take your order?”
Tony watched him in quiet, humbled awe. Slowly, he pushed himself up to until they were eye to eye, nose to nose.
“We’re staying on a mountain overlooking the lake,” Tony started to explain, doing his best to contain his giddy relief to see Steve was warming up to their holiday. The night only got darker and the rain persisted, but they continued strolling through the streets, arm in arm, while Steve listened to Tony paint the picture of the little alpine paradise they were about to discover together.
Steve stepped away from the delicate, artfully folded underwear and did his level best to ignore where he was. Unfortunately, he wasn’t great at multitasking.
Steve exhaled slow and steady around the wet and flushed head of Tony’s cock, sending a shuddering thrill of excitement through Tony’s body. Between the warm and tender sensation at the head of his cock, the rough manhandling of his drawn-up balls, and the deep, steady thrust of the thick canister, it didn’t take Tony long to come again with a choked-off cry and an aggressive thrust of his hips.
, Steve had only laid out one toy. Tony tried not to look disappointed, but the damn thing wasn’t even particularly intimidating, it was a run of the mill beaded glass dildo with a gentle curve in the shaft.
Steve could see through the water where the small bruises over Tony’s hips and thighs had nearly faded away. As archaic and covetous it made him feel, seeing the bruises he left on Tony’s body stirred Steve’s emotions unlike anything else. He could - and had - spent hours cherishing them, softly kissing them better or reviving them with greedy enthusiasm. Tony’s hips mapped Steve’s desire in the firm, unwavering grip of his hands anytime he fucked Tony from behind. The soft flesh of Tony’s inner thighs, the firm, supple curve of his ass, Steve could spend every morning tasting his skin and raising bruises with his teeth and his lips where Tony’s body was most delicate and responsive.
Tony opened the door barefooted and dressed more casually than Steve had ever seen him. It was hard not to stare.
“Well… can’t fault his taste, you look… sinful, Steve,” Tony grumbled under his breath. He spared two seconds to just drink in the sight of Steve in his skin-tight uniform, so perfect and understated in its simplicity. Superman was an alien, a legend, and who knew if he was even alive anymore? But Steve, Steve was real and genuine and everything Tony could have dreamed of. He was every inch the super man Tony needed.
“Look, I don’t want to be the person who doesn’t let their partner have their privacy and their secrets. You’re your own person. I love you and I trust you. You don’t have to tell me much, I only want to know whose it was, when you got it, why they’re so important to you, and whether or not you’ve ever fucked them.”
“This isn’t a state visit, or a scheduled appearance. Nobody will know we are there. Unless that’s what you want three cars and ten security guards to do; it only invites trouble. How am I supposed to get to know the people from behind a wall of security, Tony?”
With a cursory touch, Steve spread lube from his fingers over his cock, then guided his cock into position and pressed in with one slow, painfully slow, thrust. Tony clutched at the bedspread as those first few inches breached him, but at the same time as he felt his body stretching and straining to accommodate the blunt, unyielding intrusion of Steve’s cock, Tony could hear Steve’s quiet, otherwise unheard puffs of effort against his ear, his gasping prayer and his praising curses.
Even in his sleep Tony heard that familiar click-clack across the hardwood floors. Confident and purposeful, she gained on him faster than he could think of an escape.
Steve had heard rumors now and then about King Howard and the man he was before he lost his Queen. He had been adventurous and bold before he met the young
“He’s classically trained as a dancer first,” Tony continued, clearly not discouraged in the least by the irritated looks people were throwing their way. Then, as if his whispering wasn’t bad enough, Tony suddenly laughed in the silent movie theater. “Oh man! I forgot his name was
“You thought,” Tony growled against Steve’s laughing lips as his shock dulled into disbelieving joy, “you really thought I wouldn’t want to lock this down?” Tony stole another kiss, a filthy, unhurried slide of tongue and lips and scraping teeth until he had to pull away, panting against Steve’s swollen, spit-slick mouth.
“Breathe,” Tony repeated softly, and Steve cried out when he first felt slow, pulsing vibrations against his prostate. “Breathe, darling,” Tony said again, and if Steve had had two brain cells left to rub together, he’d tell Tony to stay in his lane and worry about his own damn breathing.
around the world and Steve moved to some nondescript, professionally furnished apartment in the East Village to film
Hammer eyed the redhead agent standing beside him, but her expression betrayed no opinion. None of the eavesdropping agents were facing Bucky or Steve, except for the towering blond - Steve 2.0 - who from the back of the war room shrugged and asked nobody in particular, “What’s the harm?”
Steve frowned a little to himself, and finally looked up at Clint to give him a flat, tired stare. How many people told him he didn’t have a life? How many people told him he’d die alone?
Tony laughed and sat up next to him, pushing the blankets away so Steve couldn’t hide behind anything. But before Steve had a chance to take his t-shirt off, Tony smacked Steve’s knee and demanded, “Turn on the light! I want to see you, babe. Who does a sexy reveal in the dark?”
In his experience Steve always stopped what he was doing to smile when he saw Tony, so to be greeted with a frown now made Tony’s stomach drop. He tracked Steve’s subtle nod until his gaze snapped to some unfamiliar suits crowding around his and Steve’s desks, clacking away on keyboards and digging through drawers. The laminated badges clipped to their suit pockets told Tony he couldn’t kick them out for trespassing, so instead he turned on his heel and marched into Fury’s office, intentionally slamming the door shut behind him.
Tony tore the door open to glare at the man disturbing his peace, but there was nobody there. He was glancing left and right, wondering if a particularly fierce wind hadn’t carried the intruder away for him, but instead something short and stout shoved past his legs, making a break for it into his warm little home.
Steve frowned, and for possibly the first time in recorded history, Tony immediately shut his mouth. None of it was new information and they both knew Steve’s memory was super-human; there was no need for a recap.
The world was spinning, and it was already more pleasure, more satisfaction from being penetrated than Steve had ever had. Heaven help him, but he wanted more, he wanted everything Tony would give him. As Tony developed a hard, steady pace with his fingers, Steve experimentally pressed his hips back to meet Tony’s fingers.
uhhhhhh about time? It’s almost been two years. They should’ve gotten divorced and cheated on their respective SOs with each other by now.
Tony's delighted laugh and natural charm effortlessly drew the attention of all cameras in their section. The press rarely witnessed his giddy happiness so openly shared in public, and as his joy filled the air it lifted the dignified, business-minded atmosphere like the warmest star in the night sky.
“Same,” Tony admitted, dropping the poker face to smile at Steve. The whole situation still felt insane, but Steve smiled back in a way that left Tony feeling buoyant and excited in a way he hadn’t felt in a long time. “I’m looking for a guy who’ll stick around, bring me pizza every once in a while, and lovingly squeeze my ass.”
“Could I have four black bean tacos with roasted sweet potatoes and poblano peppers, six grilled shrimp on slaw, six roasted corn and chickpea, and, uh. A second agua fresca.”
“Then I hope she’s busy,” he mumbled mutinously, toeing the line between resignation and petulance. “If you only knew how nosey she can be—”
Tony stared up at him and swallowed. He nodded, and without another word, he resumed his downward climb.
“Buck, I need you to do me a favor,” Steve told him without addressing the typical griping. “Call up Imperial College London, give them this name.
“At the time of his disappearance, he was a current member of Gay Arrangement dot com. According to his account history, he described himself as a sugar baby looking for a sugar daddy to, and I quote: ‘guide his professional development, fund his tasteful lifestyle, and help him refine and control his unbridled passion.’”
Steve stared, horrified. “No,” he said before he could think of a more diplomatic way to express himself.
He had his back turned to the kitchen table, but he heard the moment Tony’s absent, thoughtful humming stopped and he set the script down with deliberate calm.
“It’s not like I love turnips… we only brought turnips because it’s all I had at home,“ Tony explained quietly.
When Rhodes checked on Tony shortly after, Tony explained Steve’s absence by saying he’d gone to bed early and sent Rhodes away to enjoy dinner with the rest of his team. Nobody could have guessed Steve was already in Tony’s bed, and that he had no intention of leaving until the next morning.
That May, Steve graduated from Sargent College in the College of Health and Rehabilitation with a Bachelor of Science in Athletic Training. His mother was there to watch him in that sea of scarlet gowns, surrounded by his friends and fellow junior officers. He had so much to be grateful for, and so much to be proud of. He carried his diving medals over the stole recognizing him as student-athlete graduating with honors. Steve and all ROTC cadets wore their dress uniforms under their gowns to mark the occasion, and outwardly signaled their service to their country with red, white, and blue graduation cords. Sam and Carol wore the additional royal blue cords of the Air Force, while Steve and Bucky wore golden cords for the Army.
“I met him as Tony Stark, single museum curator with a heart of gold! I want to meet Tony Stark, my son’s steady boyfriend.”
“Who raised you this ugly?” Howard commented with a frown, but Tony was too agitated to fully address the irony of his words.
The scene that greeted Steve was disturbingly familiar. He had read about it just the night before. The red rope, the mismatched candlesticks, the scattered bottles of wine. The victim was gagged and stretched over the hood of a car, his arms tied over his head and his legs spread wide in a nauseating facsimile of how Tony had masterfully opened Steve’s body up for his ritual sacrifice. Similar knots tied to secure the victim by the thighs, the calves, and the ankles, ensuring that he could not close his legs at any cost.
Bucky gave him a long-suffering look that spoke of a lifetime shaped by a meddling mother. “You think you’re telling us something we don't know?”
“You think this is their connection?” Steve asked dubiously. Online dating was fast becoming the norm, as were the countless social fail-safes friends used to keep each other safe. “You think they were all looking for sugar daddies?”
“Aren’t you… you know, too big?” he asked, a sentiment Sam seconded by saying, “You got more muscles than any of the victims.”
“What—what do you mean?” Steve stammered, momentarily breathless. He was bracing himself and gearing up for insisting that it
Weeks passed, and little by little, Steve started to get better. The first time Tony had helped change Steve’s bandages, he’d almost been sick. How a man could survive with such awful wounds - let alone stand - astounded him. He could only imagine how uncomfortable Steve must be in hospitals to check out so quickly.
A thrill of amusement tickled down his spine, and Tony eased himself down on the mattress until he could lean far enough over the edge to kiss Steve’s nose. “Anybody ever tell you how gorgeous you are first thing in the morning?” he whispered with a mischievous smile.
With her boss on extended holiday, Sharon knew she could have done one of two things: taken it easy, or continued to run the office the way Steve had taught her over the last three years. She stepped in for his meetings where she could, responded to emails when she could, and otherwise scheduled everyone else to see Steve when he returned.
Even with his back turned, Steve could practically feel Tony rolling his eyes as he muttered, “But can you find it?”
“It’s been a long week,” he whispered, weaseling his way into Steve’s personal space to slip his long, mischievous fingers under Steve’s soft flannel. Steve’s response was immediate. The sensation of Tony’s calloused fingertips drawing absent patterns over his skin teased a full body shudder from him, and he leaned in close, his dark eyes intent on Tony’s lips.
He wouldn’t pull out of Tony until he was satisfied, but he’d still keep him shoved up against the ropes and exposed. Instead, Steve would kneel down to eat him out, cant Tony’s hips back and spread his cheeks wide, eating his own come out of Tony until Tony was a panting, whimpering, wheezing mess, and the ropes were pretty much the only thing keeping him upright anymore. After countless months of being haunted by the look in Tony's eyes from their one moment of intimacy, of wanting him but never finding him, Steve wouldn't want to stop. If they stopped, Tony might never come back. This could be their last time all over again. So Steve would throw an arm across Tony's hips to anchor him in place against the ropes, first to straight up rim him, then eventually press his fingers in, too, spreading Tony further for his tongue and mouth or to massage his prostate, forcing an orgasm out of Tony at last.
Despite failing to plan any of the things Tony hoped for on their special day, Steve arrived on Tony’s doorstep on Wednesday afternoon with a smile that warmed Tony in every way that mattered. He had never felt so happy and yet so upset to see someone before. Tony had failed; Steve deserved better than this plain room.
“He—he broke,” she stuttered hoarsely, her voice breaking and croaking around the syllables as if she hadn’t used her voice in many, many years. “He broke the curse. Clint did. I’m—I’m the one you’re looking for,” she said, repeating Stephanie’s words from earlier. “I am the Last Chief.”
His cheek was smushed against the firm couch cushion, contorting half his face. Clearly, Tony was too comfortable to care, and Steve couldn’t stop smiling up at him if he’d wanted to.
“I told them first because it was important to do this right and I didn’t want to mess it up,” Steve explained, quietly but without regret. “I haven’t really done this before, I needed help.”
Steve moaned softly at the squeeze, and again at the question, kissing Tony’s smiling lips and trailing a reverent trail of wet love bites down chin and his throat. “Anything you want,” he murmured quietly, between the kisses.
“Again with this?” Bruce sighed, picking at his sugar-free, fat-free bran muffin. “What did he actually say?”
“Hands in the air!” someone shouted, and for the first time in his life, Steve recognized the distinctive sound of two cocking rifles, something he had only previously heard in film and TV.
“Do it,” Tony whispered, lifting his ass as best as he could on his tiptoes. “I want it, baby, please.”
It wasn’t until he looked over his shoulder to catch his reflection in the mirror in his next break to show off his fucked out ass to the camera that Tony lost it. He reached back and lined the dildo up again and thrust back onto it like this toy would bear his salvation. He braced himself on his forearms and rolled back on the dildo with reckless abandon, his heavy cock bobbing wildly between his thighs with every thrust until finally, clawing at the floorboards, he threw his head back and came with a strangled, breathless groan. Come splattered over the floor and his abdomen, but as Tony crawled off the dildo on wobbly arms, he couldn’t care less. He planted right on top of the mess, panting and rolling onto his side as he luxuriated in his high and tried to catch his breath.
“You know what I think?” Steve continued with his thoughtful observations while Tony struggled to help him to his bedroom. “I think you’re a great actor, Tony. But there’s so much of your big old caring heart in Iron Man that when this movie comes out, and the fandom inevitably explodes,
Tony rolled his eyes to himself at the thought of wasting another hour of his life in a meeting that decided who wrote about new car engines and who wrote about the most exciting upcoming hair transplant procedure. It was Bruce who looked out through the little window and glanced around the office.
“Answer the phone, please,” Steve said, doing his best to sound reasonably patient. The muffed noise grew a little louder, and Steve could imagine Tony digging through his bag for the phone. He didn’t give Tony a chance to interrupt. “There were two packages left at our office and now there’s a crazy person on the phone threatening the building with something he’s calling long-range electric detonators, do you know about them?”
“I didn’t order this,” he started to explain to the attendant when he actually noticed the well-dressed man behind the tray.
Steve smiled and patiently waited for Tony to circle back around to catch his eye. “You don’t look that bad yourself, Stark.”
“This is so good,” he mumbled around his mouthful. “First thing we do after your shirtless scene, we’re going out for burgers and booze.”
In the age of social media and in front of functional cameras? But it seemed to be the only event Steve really wanted to win, and after the fifth pie, Tony had found himself hypnotized with a morbid fascination.
“Aw, come on,” Clint sighed, rubbing the dragon’s nose gently in an effort to soothe her. How something so scaly and so frightening looked heartbroken and miserable was beyond him, but somehow it explained Stephanie’s hesitation to bring the dragon into a fight. “Can’t you see she’s sad? She’s sad, Tony.”
“Appreciating the view,” Tony replied as he slid his hands up the back of Steve’s thighs to frame his thick and sinfully unblemished ass. Tony’s hands were big, strong and nimble enough to build anything, with long, clever fingers that could solve problems even his eyes couldn’t see. But even for him, this ass was a lot to handle.
“And Tony, pull up your pants, I can tell your religion,” Maria snapped, but whatever was meant to follow was quickly forgotten. She lowered her hands to her sides and looked past Tony, who had just gathered his loose jeans in his hands again. Tony turned to see what she was suddenly staring at, and to his horror, he saw Steve standing in a corner of the kitchen, hunched into himself and still covering both his ears with his hands.
“I’m glad you asked,” she purred with a broad, self-satisfied smile. “You see, I have a daughter who is your age. You would be a good match for her, provide handsome children.”
When he started thrusting it in earnest, the rippling sensation of pleasure and pain left Tony breathless and unable to form any word besides Steve’s name to beg and plead for release. Immediately, Steve wrapped his free hand around the base of Tony’s cock with enough force to stave off his climax. Hoarse from his desperate and near-delirious need to find release, Tony cried out with a sob, but Steve didn’t seem to care as he pulled the toy out.
“No! No,” Steve hurried to assure him even though waiting one more night would make him feel infinitely more comfortable. “Not too soon. If no sex, that’s fine, maybe not the best way to wake mom up, really, and, I don’t know. One more night wouldn’t kill me, but I’ve missed you. I don’t want to twist your arm, but I… I really miss having you next to me.”
Tony kept his hands to himself in the end, and did his best to keep smiling at Steve. “Thank, um. Thank you, I know it’s a busy day, and—”
Steve and Tony got disapproving stares and tutting as they made their way back to their table. Every one of their friends turned to give them knowing looks, but they said nothing. Steve quietly shifted his chair closer to Tony’s so he could keep his arms around him and rest his chin on Tony’s shoulder. He wasn’t so good about leaving distance between them after sex, especially when it was rough, but Tony only ever indulged in Steve’s after care.
“Right, sure. Let’s think about that for thirty seconds,” Tony drawled. “The intersection of the Venn diagram with people who were willing to drive you home to stay with you and who wouldn’t try to get into your pants are pretty much me and Clint.”
From that early age, his mom had impressed on him that as different as people could be, wherever they came from - rich or poor, foreign or local - all people sought and cherished the same principles: love and respect. Steve didn’t have to change the world, but if he recognized people’s fear and insecurities through their anger and offered love and respect in kind, he might change the world for one person.
“What? No,” Steve said instinctively, but Tony continued tugging at his shirt and blinking big, puppy-dog eyes at him until Steve grunted his frustration and yielded. “Fine. Just remember you asked for this.”
“You have to make sure my mom has at least three cats at all times,” Tony recited from memory. “I’ve brainstormed stories for the next fifteen years for ways you can get your parents down to Portugal every summer, so you should be okay there. We need your dad to retire already and move them both there, but short term goals: get her there every summer. She’s only going to get worse in Boston, so you can’t forget it. And after an appropriate mourning period, you need to move on—but you can
But despite Tony’s attempts to goad Steve on, to urge him closer or to deepen their kiss, Steve only pinned him down, keeping Tony from seeking his pleasure by rolling or grinding his hips against Steve. Tony grunted and sighed until finally submitting to Steve’s lead and melting back into the mattress. Steve smirked as he mouthed at Tony’s pouting lips, until finally he coaxed a reluctant smile from Tony. Soon, Tony’s meager resistance withered away, and he wetted and parted his lips under Steve’s beseeching little kisses. Steve wasted no time deepening their kiss and sweeping his tongue over Tony’s to taste him again. Their kiss was endless and unhurried, until Steve briefly pulled away to find the lube he’d left nearby.
“Hammer?” Sharon supplied, albeit skeptically. When Steve grunted in agreement, she said, “You got it, boss.”
“I already felt like an idiot for being the most awkward person in a the history of conversations, ever,” Steve explained, which wasn’t a lie, but it also wasn’t the truth. “And if he’s important to you, I just. I hope I didn’t make a bad impression.”
None other than Victoria and David Beckham looked back at Phil and the women from the phone in Phil’s hand. Between them stood a little seven year old girl in a pretty blue dress and a jean jacket, clutching a plush wolf. Phil glanced up at Steve before daring to hit play.
“Ye—sure,” Brock stammered, and without another word, Steve spun on his heel and walked on, full of confidence.
“I know exactly four things about Trafalgar Square,” Tony said on the way, walking closer than usual so they could easily hear each other while they walked down the busy street. “It’s named after a battle, it was featured in Hanson’s MMMBop video, it kind of commemorates the last execution of a British monarch, and it is the only official location of American soil in this country.”
From somewhere deep in his heart, deep in his bones, Steve could feel himself growing warm with the thrill of seeing Tony when he least expected it. “Sweetheart—Tony, what are you doing here?” he asked with a broad smile that he just couldn’t suppress.
Tony contained his sigh, restricting himself to giving her a tired look. He took the keys from her and threw them into the trash. “Fine. Come with me,” he said with a rueful tone, leading her around to the block in his part of the lab. Each part of the lab had their own block, where the final set of prepared assets for each operative would be laid out before the mission. They took turns equipping the operatives, double-oh’s only the most irritating and destructive among them.
