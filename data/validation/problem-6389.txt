“It’s - hey, I guess there’s a briefing, right? Did we miss the briefing? We should probably, you know…” He managed to get himself to a chair without incident and slid mindlessly into it, not taking his eyes off Barnes.
“And the surgery?” He’d had the updates, of course, and Rhodey was quite clearly out of hospital and back in a normal bed, but that wasn’t quite the same thing as hearing it from the horse’s mouth, so to speak. He studied Rhodey carefully. There were signs of fatigue, of course, which was to be expected. And he’d lost weight he couldn’t really afford to lose. But he was only a few days out of major surgery, and he was quite clearly moving about at least as easily as he had been when Tony had seen him last. But, of course, that didn’t mean that the surgery had achieved all it had been intended to. “How’s… everything?”
Barton shrugged. “Seems fine. We weren’t shot out of the sky by the Air Force, so we’re probably OK.”
“He doesn’t need to smell you, he’s not a dog,” Tony said, irritated. He hefted Steve in his arms, jostling him a little. Steve had done as promised and stayed under the blanket the entire time they’d been in the storage room, not making a peep as Tony recorded the bodies and the smeared symbols on the floor. “Hey, kid, you awake?”
“You're not.” Rhodey’s voice was sharp. “Tony, I love you, but you need to stop thinking your opinion is the deciding one, here. T’Challa explained the situation, and I agreed to come over. And yeah, I get a bonus medical consult with the brightest minds of the most advanced nation in the world as a side perk. Either one of those reasons would have been enough to guarantee my attendance. Both of them at the same time? It's a no-brainer, Tones.”
“That’s what we thought about the palace guard, and now they’re sushi. And anyway, the fucker’s using some of portal techno- I did
He knew he was asking a lot. He was pretty awful at talking about important things himself; hell, he’d nearly died without mentioning any of it to Rhodey. But he liked to think that this was because he was a complete moron about emotional things, and not because it was everyone’s default state. (He
Well, he’d deal with that later. Tony had plenty on his plate before dealing with the trauma of the sleeping arrangements. And the fact that T’Challa - or whoever - had decided that because Steve had yet to freak out over the Iron Man suit, that meant it was ok to put the HUD faceplate on his fucking
Mordo... well, Mordo spends the Doctor Strange film being a hero, and then decides that he opposes the Masters on moral reasons and breaks with them to go off and kill magic users because he views them as parasites. So he's not a fan of Wanda. He is, however, very clear on his position that if something like Dormammu were to threaten reality, he'd fight to protect it (because he's a bad guy, but not that type of bad guy, if you follow me.)
She nodded a little at that, her face pale as she looked down at the scepter. It shimmered and faded into dust, sifting through her fingers.
He’d hoped… but no, it was too much to ask for. He closed his eyes and dug the heels of his hands against them, trying to blot out the image that immediately sprung up.
One false move, and he could trigger a major conflict. Did the US even have a position on the Ossetian question? "FRIDAY, prepare a briefing for me on South Ossetia for the trip over. Recent events, key players, things likely to explode. You know the drill." How the hell had Rogers even made it into Georgia undetected?
“Nothing.” He smiled again, almost avuncular in his concern. “It is just that… you do not trust yourself to make that choice. Nor anyone else, either, no matter what you say. If I had brought an army with me, if I had brought all those who have my powers and my knowledge, and together we had come for the child… your answer would have been no different. I find that amusing, given the circumstances.” He sat back in his chair and closed his eyes, looking by all appearances ready for a nap. “Amusing, and a little sad.”
“Eh.” Barton wriggled a hand. “Apparently there are politics involved. But the Jabari - that’s the people here - are pretty lethal in hand to hand combat. If D'Artagnan turns up again, I’m fairly certain that Lord M’Baku - that’s, uh, the guy you fainted on - can turn him into paste.”
“I’d promise that his virtue is safe with me, but I’d be lying.” Wilson said flatly. His eyes flickered to Rhodey. “You ready?”
He thought about fighting him on this, but… “I - yeah. I mean, I’m not so hot on the plan, let’s put it that way, but there’s not a whole lot of choice, so…”
OK?” He shook Tony’s arm slightly to underscore his point, then let go. He forced a wide smile on his face. “Capisce?”
“He’s fine, Tony,” Barton said slowly. “Like I said. No injuries. Just has a bit of a chill.” His eyes were fixed on Tony’s face. “Tony? Are you on any medication right now?”
Tony dug the heels of his hands into his eyes, groaning at the pressure. “What’s the score? FRIDAY didn’t give me much before we were sent to the Lonely Mountain and Apollo Creed’s welcoming committee. I thought this was meant to be a safehouse?”
“My best friend is seeing someone and fails to mention it, and I’m not supposed to take it personally?” OK, so making it all about him was probably not the best move, but he was more or less grounded until they dug up a lead, unshrunk Steve and figured out what the bad guy’s next move was. Or who the bad guy was. Or what the fuck they wanted in Ossetia. Or anything at all, really.
Hill shrugged. “She told him where he could stick his concern. Politely. She may also have mentioned that no CEO worth her salt would let a NED mess up long-term strategy for the sake of short-term profits. That the liability shield between SI and the sub was practically impenetrable, and only an illiterate idiot would think she’d have signed off on it any other way. And a few other… less polite things.”
Dhakiya managed to hide her smile. “If you need anything, please just indicate on the request list here.” She handed him a sleek tablet. “It has a retina-lock which you can enable. I suggest you do not use it around the child overly much.” She nodded at the room. “His majesty was very specific about the furnishings. There should not be anything present which would disturb the child. I understand he is from an isolated area, and unfamiliar with modern technology.”
There were dead kids on the slide behind Barton’s head, for God’s sake. Sure, they’d been de-aged Hydra soldiers, but there were limits even to Tony’s sense of humour, and there was a surfeit of morbidity in the room already. OK,
His mouth quirked. “Pep telling tales? Or are you still in contact with -” with Romanoff, he almost said without thinking, but caught himself in time. “With Rushman?”
Romanoff raised an eyebrow at him. “I really have no interest in any schoolmarm fantasies you may have, Tony; that’s between you and your confessor,” she said crisply. She called up the screen again, and a world map came up with red dots picked out across it. One of the dots was on the location of the south Ossetia base. “I’ll be brief. We’ve had an unexpected breakthrough in the last few hours, which leads us to believe that this incident was not an isolated one. Similar events have occurred across six other locations over the last four weeks. There are indications that further events are forthcoming, and we therefore have a tight deadline on this.” She tapped at the screen and the locations flashed, a date appearing beside each of them.
T’Challa held his gaze unblinkingly. “None of those individuals are in Wakanda. Nor do I have a way of reaching them.”
“... yeah, I know how that goes.” Wilson looked at him for a long moment. “I was against it, by the way.”
He heard the whimper before he saw the movement out of the corner of his eye. His head whipped around, the HUD tracking the source of the source and zeroing in on it in seconds. "
He'd need to leave a note, make it clear that his trip was unauthorised and that no one in the US military (or the UN Accords Council) had any knowledge of his entry into Georgia, let alone the restricted South Ossetia region. If anyone spotted him...
Tony was once again forcibly reminded that Barton had tried his own variant of that, and look how that had worked out.
“Quinjet’s standing by to get us to Wakanda,” Barton said. His gaze was thoughtful as he watched Tony struggle to get back into the armour without dropping the sleepy child in his arms. “I figured you could make your way back from there, once we get Steve settled down.”
Lang shrugged, as if this settled things. “Well, then. Look, I get that this makes things a little bit more complicated for us. But…” he shrugged again, leaning back. “It’s not really our call, at this point.”
- had oversight over the companies supposedly suing them, then they could drop the lawsuit whenever the danger was past. It did have the downside of denying SI itself access to the data, but if the Avengers were suspended, there wasn’t much point to it anyway. (And it wasn’t as if Tony didn’t keep off-the-book back-ups.) Tony paused for a moment, then turned to Barton. “Well?”
“No, there’s limited power, I don’t want to drain it in case there’s a problem. Just - send them to us, we’ll be waiting.” They didn’t have much choice on that front.
Tony cuts him off with a wave of his hand. (It costs him, because the gray isn't all gone, but he still has his other hand on the edge of the worktop. He can do this. He can.) “Or. You can work it off in trade.”
Tony sighed. Well, he’d tried. It wasn’t his fault he had no idea what to do with a pint-sized and traumatised Steve Rogers. He barely had any idea what to do with him when he was adult-shaped and not in danger of breaking by sneezing too hard. “We’ll fix this, don’t worry,” promised, mentally running through his options. T’Challa, of course - he could mind Rogers until Wanda or someone else managed to turn him back - or maybe he could contact Thor, see if his lunatic brother couldn’t be persuaded to help them out… that was, if Loki wasn’t behind this in the first place.
“Still not sorry,” Tony said, and activated the boot repulsors, aiming for the open sky above, Steve held safely in his arms.
get the stone to apologies for the inconvenience afterwards. Bastard hadn’t ever met a power move he’d disliked.
“The Captain went in alone,” Vision said mildly. “And although I do not have magical powers per se, I believe that I may be able to provide some limited shielding from the radiation we have observed.” He looked down at the briefing packet in front of him. At his side, Maximoff shifted closer infinitesimally. “The most logical approach is to split into two teams,” Vision said, thoughtful. “One team to focus on the imminent threat, and the other to work on returning Captain Rogers to his adult state.”
Tony had managed to avoid talking to, at, or near Maximoff for the most part, but… “Shouldn’t you be working on a way to turn Rogers back?” That… was a bit blunter than he’d intended. “I mean, as our only magic user, your skills may be better placed there…” he trailed off. Maximoff was looking at him, her eyes wide. “What?”
She took a deep breath. “It is as I said. I … apologise. For what I did to you at the base, when you first came.” She swallowed, looking a little green. “I should have said something before. That I did not… It was… cruel.”
“Barnes should stay here,” he managed after a long moment. He addressed Barton, not quite able to make himself face the Soldier. “He should -”
he checked with T’Challa’s med team that the Soldier was safe to be around. For all that Tony didn’t want to spend any more time with him than he needed to, he also didn’t feel entirely comfortable handing the kid over until he was certain that certain safeguards were in place. “If we’re done here, I suggest we go give the kid his beloved Bucky back, and make sure that we’ve figured out the baby-sitting. No offence, Barnes, but I’m gonna want to check what arrangements have been made to keep you under control so I don’t come back to find that you’ve turned the kid into part of the exhibit.” He waved a hand at the projection still on the screen. One small face stared blankly into the camera from the bottom-right corner, its eyes filmy-white.
Coney Island Boardwalk opening in 1923, so it's perfectly feasible - at least in theory - for a poor family in the mid-20s to have made a special birthday trip out there to partake of the amusements.
“Shhh, just go back to sleep,” Tony murmured, and wrapped the blanket around them more securely. He figured he’d stay awake himself. Steve was clearly halfway back to unconscious, but Tony was wide-awake and it was really too fucking cold to sleep. He’d just stay here to make sure the kid was okay, maybe check the comms console for any messages, and -
“Well, that’s why I’m taking with me the dynamic duo of Messers Barnes and Barton, marksmen extraordinaire,” Tony snapped back. He stopped, then tried for a more conciliatory tone. “Look, we’ve no indication that Umar is even aware of Steve’s existence, let alone that this might be a problem for her. All we have is Mordo’s story, which I still don’t buy a hundred percent. And, besides…” He shrugged again, settling an arm around the child. “I can’t stay out here, you know,
believe it, but - damnit, he’d been holding out hope that T’Challa was a voice of fucking reason, a kindred spirit, a - a -
“Who’s going to be with you?” Happy interrupted. “Boss, who’s going to be watching your back while you have the kid with you?” His frown deepened. “I can’t come out there, I have the spi- um, the
There really wasn’t any point to putting things off any longer; he might as well get it over with. She’d not come for Steve, so that was a good thing. That she’d come for hm instead was… inevitable.
This was fucking ridiculous. The idea that he’d use his brother in this way…  “I'm not gonna use you as a human shield!”
Why the hell did the kid sound so uncertain about that? “And I’m one of them, that’s right. In fact, we have a plan to stop that man from hurting you. But there’s something I want to do just in case we have a problem, OK?”
Barton left them alone with the art supplies after a couple of hours, presumably going off to do whatever it was unconcussed people did: reading Jane Foster’s notes, planning a trap for their evil portal-maker, passing notes to Rhodey, Tony wasn’t very clear on this point and didn’t much care, as long as he was left alone to nurse his headache and try to get some sleep.
“Yes,” Rogers interrupts him, finally looking him in the eye. “I mean - yes. That -” he swallows. “That seems fair. I'll help with whatever you need. Whatever you want, Tony. Materials, access to scientists, secret research, whatever it is. Just tell me.”
“And whoever is waiting for us will be able to fight off a super-strong wizard wielding a sword?” He asked doubtfully, already turning in the direction of the mountains. His right boot repulsor had a bit of a list to it; a blow must have pushed it out of alignment. He bent his knee slightly to compensate, wincing at the pressure this put on his hip.
The thought came unbidden, intended for a different recipient than the child lying quiescent on the bed.
A small hand landed on his arm, followed by something cold and sticky being put in Tony’s hand carefully. “I brought you a crayon, so you don’t get sad,” Steve said in a tiny voice.
There had been a lot of shouting. T’Challa had kept order, and M’Baku had mostly disagreed with everyone, and Shuri had eventually conferenced in and had been
“Not a robot, Steve. I'm human; it's just a suit.” Moving slowly, Tony opened up the faceplate. “See? All human.”
“Dr Stark, welcome back. You requested medical assistance?” T’Challa’s gaze was sharp as he looked at the child Steve in Tony’s arms. “It is a hard thing to believe, to see him like this…”
Hill relaxed infinitesimally at this. “Pepper will forgive you eventually. The FAC Chair probably won’t, though.”
“Tony, I’m really not sure you should do this,” Pepper said, her voice strained. Her hair was a messy halo around her head, falling to her shoulders in back-lit waves. She was still blinking sleep out of her eyes and shrugging into a dressing down as she sat down in front of the personal video screen.
out of line, and I swear to God we’re gonna find out if keelhauling is possible on a plane. You get me?”
He was fast coming to realise that, when the chips were down and he had to make the hard choices, he also had an order of priority. And most of the Avengers?
The child nodded, his little fingers tight on Tony’s T-shirt. He didn’t seem surprised to hear that, and by the familiar set of his jaw, he was clearly trying his best to be stoic about it.
This was a hell of a lot worse than Steve not trusting him to be his protector. This was… He didn’t know what to do.
blinked at him. Oh, fuck his life. He’d finally managed to drop off to sleep a grand total of two hours ago. And it had been a good dream, too; someone had been hugging him, and he’d been just about to -
At this point, Tony was not entirely sure what the answer was to that question. “Absolutely,” he said confidently. “They need to lull both assailants in a false sense of security and then…” He trailed off delicately. “Why, d’you have an alternate solution?”
He might be vulnerable himself to the temptation to decide on other people’s behalf - keeping the palladium poisoning from Pep and Rhodey, and locking Wanda away, being two notable examples - but at least he acknowledged that it was on
“So how do you know it is her?” T’Challa broke in. “You said that she posed a threat to this entire Dimension, that if she is not stopped, reality itself is in peril. And yet you tell us that you do not have access to any of the information that would be useful, and that there has been sundering between you and your allies. How do you know what you know, and - forgive me -” his expression was hard, “what
“Right.” That was a relief, at least. Tony rubbed a hand over his face and struggled to sit up without dislodging Steve, clinging limpet-like to his side. “Well, that’s good, I guess. Did you catch the name of the guy I fainted on? I should probably apologise...” Had he been a Lord? For some reason Tony was fairly sure the guy was a Lord.
They weren’t even sure if this physical state was permanent, or whether it would start to degrade or destabilise. Would Steve grow normally if left to his own devices? Everything seemed to point to his situatedness in this time, from his responsiveness to the antibiotics to his ability to ingest food and expel waste, but that wasn’t a guarantee. Mordo had called him a fixed point; they still didn’t have a clear idea of what that meant, other than he could use Steve to somehow fight Umar. Did being a ‘fixed point’ imply the permanence that Tony would have attributed to the description, or was it just Mordo’s turn of phrase?
Barton had said during one of their last debriefs before he’d retired. They'd had to evacuate a school bus of children, and it had… not gone especially well. The youngest kids had been so terrified, they'd crawled under the seats and refused to come out. Tony had ended up dragging the entire bus out of the line of fire because it had been easier than ripping it apart to look for the kids.
- whatever visiting hours, magical torture or other hideous activity Tony had agreed them to attempt with the kid. Who Tony as now in charge of.
“The fifth attack was in Volgograd, another thirteen dead. The sixth was in Ossetia.” She tapped the screen, and a seventh dot appeared, hovering over Tajikistan. “The seventh was yesterday, in Dushanbe. Twenty three dead.” Images flashed through on the right-hand side: close-ups of the bodies of the victims, of the writing on the walls, of the limbs and entrails carefully arranged.
, she said nothing about kneeing you in the balls.” Barton looked at him for a long moment before groaning and sitting down at the table, watching warily as Tony joined him. “All right. Fine. So we should have told you.”
“I have some options for you to look at,” Hill murmured, seemingly discomfited by the change of subject.
the child said, pleaded, sobbed, and then Tony was the one with the shield, and he was bringing it down on the child’s unprotected chest with a sickening
When they got to the suite, on the desk in the little study was a sealed box, coded to his thumbprint. "Agent Romanoff has left a copy of the files with you," Dhakiya said. "She said that the audio recording was in there, and that you should listen to it when you were alone." She looked at the child in Tony's arms. "I can put him to bed, if you'd like to listen to it now."
“Probably off to go do whatever it is super-spies do when they’re not babysitting Americans,” Rhodey said. He had positioned himself in the standard ‘stretch’ pose - legs crossed, torso level, arms stretched out on the floor - and was balancing himself with his elbows on the outside of his knees. “I didn’t get the impression that managing us was a stretch of her abilities.”
“You should probably think of it as a retirement party,” Barton said, grinning. “They’re just jealous you’re heading off to have babies in the suburbs while the rest of us do the real work.” He shrugged again, then turned and went back to the cockpit and the pilot’s seat.
“These?” The swordsman raised his arms, looking from one to the other, his expression untroubled. “They are temporary.” He lowered them back slowly, as if to stress that T’Challa should not underestimate him. “I assume you wanted to talk. You have gone to all this trouble.” His eyes narrowed. “What are you waiting for?”
“Yeah, OK. Thanks.” He wasn’t sure what to do with the advice, admittedly, but he did appreciate Wilson
Tony had the overwhelming impression that it was not what he had originally intended to say. “He’s hiding something,” he muttered.
“Much the same thing you are,” M’Baku said, smiling. He’d changed his clothes; he must had stopped off at his quarters. It was strange to see him without all that ceremonial fur and so forth; he was still impressively broad-shouldered, but a little less… imposing. “Tjaila!” M’Baku called out, and two children looked up, grinning. One was about the same age as Steve; the other a bit younger, around four or five. They both clambered to their feet and ran over to M’Baku, grabbing hold of a leg each.
A couple of familiar faces were waiting for them at the end of the corridor, flanked by four guards.
point, the whole lot of them had wormed their way into his heart, like an infestation he was helpless to defend against - he didn’t trust her. In battle, sure, but not to have his back. On the list of people she cared about, he imagined he came fairly low on the totem pole, perhaps a step or two higher than Justin Hammer.
“Hmmmm,” M’Baku said, which seemed to be neither here nor there. He sat down in the chair beside the bed, on the opposite side from Steve, his hands relaxed by his side. Tony did not fail to notice how carefully he positioned himself, so as to look non-threatening. (He did not delude himself into thinking this was for his benefit. No, if he’d been on his own, this conversation would perhaps be going differently. But with Steve by his side…) “I have not kept myself as informed of the outside world as perhaps I should have,” M’Baku said slowly. “But I have heard of you, Tony Stark. I had thought that you did not have children.” His expression shifted minutely.
“Hey, Tony. Everything OK?” Rhodey squinted at him from the screen, rumpled and still half-asleep. There was a movement next to him on the bed, the bedlinen lifting as someone turned over and tugged the sheet closer to them. Rhodey made a soothing sound before angling the screen away so the other body wasn’t in view. “Gimme a sec.”
“I’ve learned not to take any of that for granted,” Romanoff said, in the air of one imparting great wisdom, laughing a little as Tony rolled his eyes in response. “Besides,” she said reasonably, “that, and his pop culture knowledge - thanks for that, by the way - gives us a useful lever.”
Tony really was wishing they’d tied up and gagged the guy and left him in the fucking hold. He could see Wanda stiffen in her seat, very pointedly
Romanoff’s eyes flickered to the bundle of blankets in Tony’s arms - and the spindly, bare arms that poked out to cling to the raised collar of the Iron Man suit - and she raised an eyebrow. “I was in the neighbourhood.”
Moving slowly, he slid his hands under Steve’s (too thin, too narrow) shoulders and lifted him up and into the seated, open armour. He was small enough to fit easily in the chest cavity, his knees pressed to his chest. Tony thought about pulling the armour closed a little around him, but he wasn’t sure whether Steve had any issues with confined spaces and the last thing he wanted was a crying fit on his hands.
“I am. I promised, didn’t I? Shhhh, go back to sleep. I’ll see you in the morning.” But Steve was already asleep, wrapped in the memory of Tony’s embrace.
“Two days at the very minimum,” the doctor said oppressively. She scribbled something on her tablet that Tony strongly suspected included the words,
Not the base, OK. “Something else?” Tony hazarded. He shifted them so he was sitting with his back against the headboard, the kid sprawled in his lap. He brought the comforter up around the both, pillowing Steve against his shoulder. “Did something else scare you?”
what we’re talking about,” Rhodey muttered. He sighed. “Would you believe me if I said it had nothing to do with you?”
There were a ridiculous amount of plates in the air. Steve, Umar, the Accords, Ross, the whole fucking team… his head ached abominably, a tell-tale sign that he hadn’t hydrated enough on the flight.
He hugged Steve to him one final time and then stepped away. “I’ll be back soon,” he promised, and patted Vision’s arm.
“Come on, come on,” he muttered, wiping his face. The pebble still refused to connect, flashing through to a
“I told you,” he said, his voice deliberately light. “I’m gonna move us back to the US for a bit. I’m gonna do the heavy lifting on this, Pep, I promise. All I need is a favour or two.”
(It's actually a 3D holographic version of Pong. He likes Pong. Pong is playing across his worktop, and it's actually a lot more soothing than it has any right to be.)
After a moment, Barton stepped away, shaking his head. “I don't know why I bother.” He shoved a finger in Tony’s face. “You didn't fuck it up so far. Just try to resist the urge to set anything on fire in the next few days, okay? We can handle the rest for a bit. The whole team is on this; all the two of you have to do is just sit tight.”
; Christ, this better be one giant plan-within-a-plan or he was gonna put T’Challa’s head on backwards for this double-cross.
(He dies on the icy ground, his metallic heart in Barnes’s hands, the small child crying, Steve frowning down at him, and Captain America turning away, disappointed.)
“That is true, isn’t it? You don’t think of him as a shrunk version of Captain America. There are two people, and you think that we have endangered one for the benefit of the other.” She sounded confused, and a little sad. “But… you know that is not true. We are all working towards the same goal, here. We need to stop these attacks, and we all want Steve back.”
A small voice asked, and he quashed the thought ruthlessly. No. This wasn’t a Lovecraftian horror; there were no Old Gods to placate with a blood sacrifice.
Her lips thinned. “All right.” She sat down, little-girl prim, her ankles folded away to one side, her hands clasped in her lap. She’d swapped her leather boots and skirt for one of the long printed dresses that seemed to be in fashion here, a thick belt buckled around it awkwardly. A necklace of tiny red and orange beads hung heavy about her neck.
“OK, I want you to remember that. I have to go and talk to the bad guy - we hope we can convince him to stop being a bad guy - and my friend, Vision, is gonna look after you for a bit. Vision will keep you safe. Won’t you, Vis?”
“Now, more than ever. Your recent absence has not made you any friends among the other Board members, and especially among the FAC. Pepper has been working overtime to calm him down. Something about a missing derogation on the BARF design?” She spelled it out B-A-R-F, her entire expression indicating that no power on this earth would be able to compel her to just call the fucking thing BARF as God (and Tony) had intended.
M’Baku, for his part, was less than amused to be roused out of bed at three in the morning for a conference call. “If you insist on prattling senselessly, mzungu, I shall have you gagged.” He scrubbed a hand over his face, looking tired, and slumped into the nearest seat. “I may opt for that in any case.” He glared at T’Challa, sat by his side. “He does not cease, this one. None of them ever shut up, whine whine whine. How do you stand it?”
Steve stared at him, his eyes huge. (He still had the odd bit of green paint in his hair that Tony hadn’t been able to wash out the night before and had eventually surrendered to.) He didn’t say anything.
Vision volunteered to re-review all the available data alongside Barton and see if there was anything that could be drawn out that wasn’t immediately apparent on their first pass.
Well, far be it for Tony to get in the way of a good makeover montage. “Always remember that you can either wear statement lips or dramatic eyes, but not both,” Tony advised on the way out, then went to collapse back in the seat beside Steve’s. The kid was still asleep, which wasn’t surprising given all the activity of the day, the time difference, plus the albuterol dose he’d needed mid-way through the flight. He mumbled under his breath as Tony retook his seat and wriggled so that he was half-draped on Tony’s arm and drooling on his shoulder. Tony smoothed his hair back from his face and leaned back in his seat, waiting for Barnes and Barton to turn into strangers and let them know it was safe to disembark.
Apologies for the longer-than-usual gap between parts. I needed to figure out a few plot points before I could continue and knew where I needed to get to, but not quite how to get there. We're back on track now.
Her eyes were dark. “Well, it is in my DNA, as you say.” Her voice and face were perfectly expressionless, like computer recordings.
Barton shrugged at that, looking a little uncomfortable. “He’s fine. Tired - he wouldn’t sleep. Wouldn't let go of you. Screamed every time we tried to coax him away. Holding on to him while you were under was a piece of work, let me tell you. If he wasn't full of supersoldier serum, Barnes would still be sporting the scars.”
He grabbed for the pebble and scrolled through to the contacts. Rhodey had been loaded up as a contact, although his name still showed up as greyed out. Lack of connection or the contact hadn’t been set up correctly? It had worked when Rhodey had called
“... I understand,” Tony said. He did. It was the difference between having everyone pressing him into the arc reactor surgery, and him choosing to go under on his own terms. It was the difference between Rhodey taking War Machine, and Tony signing it over to him. (It was the difference between Steve taking Tony’s resources to find Barnes, and…) “I’m sorry too. I'm sorry I didn’t give you the choice.”
. No, they wouldn’t have told Rhodey. Lang might have been against it - he had a kid, if Tony was remembering correctly - and although M’Baku had clearly agreed to go along with it, he hadn’t agreed with keeping Tony out of the loop. The others, though? Christ, he had no idea. Would Romanoff have backed Barton or Barnes on this? Wilson? T’Challa?
And Tony… Tony was done trusting her judgement. For the good of the team; sure. For Rogers’s sake; absolutely. But for Tony’s sake, for Tony’s well-being? No, he knew exactly where he ranked on her priority list.
All they had so far were some inconclusive readings and a whole lot of conjecture and hand-waving. Who the hell knew what had truly happened, and what level of awareness Steve had of his situation.
He knew that, first hand. (He still couldn’t tell Pep he was ‘fine’. Those words were now forbidden, stricken from the vocabulary of their friendship. He had said them one too many times, and now,
in the Lancelot-Grail cycle. I liked the idea of little!Steve knowing his Arthurian mythology, and of course Tony only really offers his name once, when they first meet, when Steve is probably too frightened to really take it in.
Barton came to her rescue. “Look, Tony. The portals, the two assailants… they are all using magic or tech we can’t match or figure out. It was bad enough when all we were trying to do was to get ahead of the attacks and to work out how to turn Steve back. But when we knew he was a target…”
The blinds, Tony realised suddenly; Wilson must have been sat in the chair near the window and he’d closed the blinds when Tony had complained about the light. “What’s he doing here? What are
There was definitely something there. Tony made a mental note to watch out for any sorcerers and wizards when he was back in New York, if they were running some sort of holy place right under his nose. Not that he’d be able to necessarily spot them, of course, if they were anything like Mordo, of course, but - well, if they were anything like Mordo, the body count would likely give them away.
Steve looked up at him and nodded. He was dressed in his thin pyjamas, his feet bare. His lips were already starting to turn blue from the cold.
Tony waited until the doctor had left the room to raise an eyebrow at Barton. “Don’t you have a couple of serial killers to hunt down?”
Wilson gave him a brittle look. “I don’t think that anyone was deluding themselves on that point,” he said. He looked at the still form on the bed, frowning uneasily. “Barnes was never really the issue here.”
“Look on the bright side,” Wilson said, sounding far too chipper for Tony’s liking as he took his place behind Rhodey and carefully maneuvered the wheelchair out of the door, Tony following awkwardly. “Maybe Steve will turn back to normal and they’ll strangle each other before then.”
“FRIDAY, suit.” The suit assembled around him as he hurried back into the bedroom and carefully caught hold of the sleeping Steve. “Kid, wake up. Come on, Steve, I need you to wake up now.”
Yinsen said to him, reaching into Tony’s chest once more. His hands were gentle as they nudged Tony’s heart to one side, cushioning the magnet in its new home.
Romanoff tapped at the screen. “Attack number four was where things got interesting.” Everyone leaned forward at that one, staring at the little dot flashing over Moscow. “The Moscow attack resulted in twelve dead, and one survivor,” Romanoff said quietly. The image on the right changed from the Interpol case file to a video of a small blonde-haired boy, clearly in a hospital bed, talking quietly into the camera. “
“Are you certain you have the right place?” Okoye asked, looking around. “I do not see an entrance.”
Looking after a sickly kid in a secret bunker was not quite the same thing as looking after one in a royal palace.
“When did you guys get back?” Tony asked, surprised. He had thought Vision and Lang were still out in Burkina Faso, being visibly
His head hurt. He pressed his hands to his face and sat back down in his chair, trying to marshal his thoughts into something useful. Behind him, he could hear Barton whispering loudly, “see, it’s not just me who has a headache from looking at it,” to an unimpressed Barnes.
“Hey.” Tony put his hands on the child’s shoulders and drew him in for a hug, bedding and all. “I promise, OK? I’ll be back in two days.” He drew back, smoothing down Steve’s hair. “I need you to be brave for Vision, OK? I need you to listen to what he says.”
Oh, Barnes had been given the all-clear - for a given definition of all-clear, which seemed to mean,
It was mostly luck that had kept him from fatherhood. He winced at the thought of subjecting a helpless child to the mess that was his life. Oh, sure, any child of his would be loved and cosseted and would want for nothing. But they’d also be hounded relentlessly by the press, unable to live a life of their choosing, and would be forced to deal with a parent that had not-inconsiderable chance of being blown up, magicked into space or impaled by aliens. If Tony had had kids… well, he was fairly certain that being a father and being Iron Man was fundamentally incompatible. Barton had hidden his kids away and left the raising of them to his wife. That wasn’t an option for Tony now - not that it had been much of one when he’d been in a relationship with Pep, of course.
Tony sat down at the desk, the pebble in his outstretched hand. “Locate audio recordings, Steve Rogers,” he murmured. The pebble beeped softly, the screen unfolding in front of his eyes, a list of entries appearing. There were about three dozen of them, spread over the weeks following Siberia, varying in length. Some were over an hour long; others, just a few minutes. There were associated files linked to them, photographs and maps that Tony recognised from the briefing packs, structured neatly in thematic trees.
Blinking a little at the non sequitur, Tony nodded. “That was eighteen months - no, closer to two years ago? With…” He couldn’t remember the unit. It had been one of Rhodey’s last deployments with the Air Force, before his assignment had been changed to base him firmly on US soil. Before he’d started taking Avengers missions, as well as War Machine ones. Rhodey had been one of the senior liaisons to the Iraqi government, supporting the joint taskforce moving against ISIL. He’d spent several months in Kurdistan, overseeing the US Air Force/ US Army / Iraqi Kurdish peshmerga forces and ensuring that the supplied equipment was used correctly.
The two bedrooms were adjoining, one clearly intended for an adult, with a king-sized bed, and the other… not.
The kid looked at him through narrowed eyes, then seemed to relax. “That’s OK, I’m OK.” He looked back down at his sneakers and edged the tip of his right one over his left, making the Iron Men bump extended fists, mid-flight. “Thanks,” he mumbled.
“I hope Wakanda believes in clotheslines,” he muttered, and set the suit to scan for any movement following the wind direction. Maybe they’d get lucky and come across a blanket or a sweater pegged up to dry outside.
Steve nodded and demonstrated putting the mask up. “I used one when I got real sick once and mom took me to the doctor. I put it over my face and breathe real hard, and then medicine gets in me.”
Wilson wasn’t going to fucking tell him, why the hell should he? If he’d thought that this was some political move, some deliberate move on the part of a few governments to stamp what they thought as ‘acceptable’ on the Avengers… Tony had always wondered how a fucking
The scary woman - General Okoye - surveyed them all with the air of someone who had taken their measure in the first few minutes of their acquaintance, and had found them all sadly lacking. “Charmed, I’m sure,” Tony’s mouth said without any input from his brain.
Bad enough that Barnes chose this as a bonding moment, all Tony needed was Steve thinking he would be part of the fight. “That’s enough out of you. You don’t get to have an opinion until you’re taller than my shoulders. Come on, let’s get you ready.” With a bit of help from Steve, he managed to get the child into the large coat that Dhakiya had sent and zipped him up firmly, making sure that the Kevlar inserts were properly positioned over his back and front.
Okoye shook her head. “Photostatic veils leave a trace signature on electronic equipment; we are compensating for it. We may not be able to see the face beneath, but we will b able to know if the image has been altered.”
Okoye wishes that T'Challa will stop running headlong into danger, but knows that she will never get that wish.
“How d’you think M’Baku got you down here, anyway?” Barton picked idly at his nails as the doctor left the discharge papers on the desk and exited. As the door closed behind her he shifted a little, moving up off the door frame so that he was blocking the door more effectively.
he could fly them to, but… there was an exit, at least. “Aren’t you supposed to be skulking behind doors and columns so as not to freak out the kid?”
“Thank you for joining us, Dr Stark. I am pleased you are recovered. And I understand that Captain Rogers is also recovering well and is expected to be discharged from the PICU imminently.” There was a brief murmur of relief around the table at that; although not of surprise, Tony noted. Clearly the kiddification of Rogers had already made the rounds. “Agent Barton will lead this briefing - Agent, Barton, if you would -” T’Challa took the seat next to Romanoff and tapped at one of the tablets on the table. A screen rolled down the far wall and the lights dimmed slightly.
“I’m fairly sure she’s part of the king’s bodyguard,” Tony said absently. Not that Tony minded having someone nearby who could put Barnes down, by any means. The suit was a silent statue in the corner, and although he wore his repulsor watch, it would be a poor defence if Barnes were to snap and go after the kid. No, better to have someone here purely for defence. “Are you sure you should be doing that?” Even from this vantage point he could tell that Rhodey’s positioning was putting a lot of pressure on his lower back. Why would he do something like that?
But Barnes was shaking his head. “He doesn’t know me,” he croaked. “He… I can’t do this. I’m sorry.” He pushed past Barton blindly, almost running out of the door. The two Dora Milaje smartly followed, leaving Barton and Tony alone with the child.
. His fingers went to his wrists, to where he could feel the metal of the suit bracelets. He'd put them on once he'd repaired the suit, and never quite got around to taking them off again. It was probably for the best, anyway; it couldn't hurt to have the suit accessible wherever he was. (It wasn't like he had someone in his bed he needed to be considerate of, anyway.)
He stared at Tony and sniffled, letting go of the knife with one hand to drag his forearm across his face, managing to transfer both his snot and the majority of his camouflage make-up onto his oversized uniform sleeve.
He slept and he dreamt of a darkroom suffused with red light, the photos slowly developing from a spool of negatives discarded on the floor. There was the car, crashed against the tree; there was his father, his face brutalised; there was his mother; her neck snapped. And there was someone standing over him - someone he knew, someone he loved - and he was bringing his shield down over Tony’s heart, again and again and again. Beside Tony was a small, crying child, holding Tony’s hand.
(Now, Tony wished he’d complained a little less vociferously about being made to walk everywhere. Jarvis had been old, yes. But now, it appeared, so was Tony.)
,” someone gasped, too close, and Tony went down in a tangle of limbs, the breath knocked out of him despite the suit’s cushioning.
“OK, so, first off, congrats on not being dead, must be good to, you know, have the paperwork for that.”
And he'd rubbed his chest again, his small hand clenched on the fabric of his pyjamas as he'd sniffled, his eyes huge and watery.
She looked a little discomforted at M’Baku’s scrutiny, but at Dr Foster’s encouraging look she nodded. A screen unfolded between her and Dr Foster, their calculations spooling out across it. It was pretty much what Tony had expected - a whole lot of work on the radiation from the portals - but there was something else in there. Tony squinted at the notes on the bottom right, which seemed to be a little… odd.
,” he said. His voice was thin and laboured. There was a plastic mask on straps around his neck, pulled away to one side so he could speak more clearly. “
Tony shook his head. “His extremities were very cold before, but I got his core temperature up pretty quickly, and FRIDAY would have alerted me if it had slipped back down again.” He released one hand from the suit and pressed it against the nape of Steve’s neck. “I thought his breathing sounded a bit off earlier…” He shouldn’t have been holding the kid against the armour like that, or letting him sleep on his back, for that matter; he’d probably made it worse. “God fucking dammit!”
Barton shook his head. “He couldn’t. We got the message in the dead drop after you’d already arrived at the base; once T’Challa knew you needed collecting, he gave us the details and FRIDAY provided the quinjet.”
Although, come to think of it, a human who was willing to do what he’d seen in that room was probably no saner.
On the other side of the room, Lang spoke up. “I don’t think you’re gonna win this one.” His eyes were on Tony, but he seemed to be addressing Wanda. “You’re - look, I get it. You’re getting your kid to safety, right?” He nodded at where Steve was staring warily back.
. Tony was on his knees in an instant, leaning forward and pressing his hands in between Rhodey’s hips and the sides of the wheelchair to check the bandages. “Are you ok? Was there any damage during the flight?” Dammit, what was he thinking? He should have checked on Rhodey immediately!
“Enough, FRIDAY; I'm up, Jesus fucking Christ.” Tony groaned, a hand over his eyes. His head felt like someone had taken a sledgehammer to it. Christ, he could do with a drink.
Tony mouthed at Barton, who shrugged. Despite Barton’s earlier declaration that the whole team had magically reassembled for God, Justice and the American Way, he had trouble believing it. Well, no, not when the American Way was currently sprawled in a feverish sleep on Tony’s shoulder, his breathing patchy and laboured. But the rest of it? That everyone else would be able to set aside what had happened so easily, when Tony had been unable to do so, and Rogers had only gone so far as to write him a
Huh. “Send her a holding note, FRI, polite but - well, you know the drill. Jet lag, cranky child, will contact her when possible, et cetera.” Shuri wasn’t waiting around, evidently. But Tony wasn’t taking Steve anywhere other than the Stark Industries facility right now; after they’d all had a chance to adjust to EST and get some decent sleep,
“So, how did the grand farewell go?” Barton asked with a raised eyebrow at Tony’s disgruntled expression. He leaned against the wall, arms folded.
The king looked away for a moment. “Dr Stark, I do not mean to presume, but I feel that I should clear up some misapprehensions on your part with respect to your teammates.”
Clint wordlessly dragged across the duffel bag he’d dumped on one side, and produced a heavy thermal blanket from the depths, shaking it out. He attempted to reach around Steve to wrap it around him but stopped when Steve shrank back against Tony, hiding behind his leg.
T’Challa nodded at that, looking thoughtful. “You will need Maximoff and Barnes with you, to contain him. And -” his eyes flickered to Barton. “Perhaps one other?”
His hand moved restlessly, twisting in the restraints, trying to open and close, looking for the warmth that had held him down before. (It had been better, that warmth, even though it had hurt. He’d recognised it. He wanted it back.)
There was a neat pile of Steve’s books left on one side, the child’s crayons packed back into their box. He added the box to the case, and slid the books in after it in a heap. One of the books - the Arthurian mythology book - had a piece of Steve’s artwork stuck between the pages. The paper, even folded, was a bit too big to sit comfortably in between the pages, but clearly this piece was important enough to Steve to try to protect it during transit. “Steve, you OK in there?” He called out absentmindedly, unfolding the drawing and smoothing out the wrinkles.
“Oh, piss off,” Rhodey laughed, that dimple back again. He made a rude gesture with one hand. “Go look after that kid. I’ll keep things under control here.”
“Security detail, fifteen years ago.” Even his voice sounded different. He flexed his shoulders and adopted the carefully blank expression of the security professional. “The cover story pack was comprehensive.”
That said, for all that going to Hong Kong held a certain appeal - he was sick and tired of being coddled - he wasn’t sure about the logistics of it. Could he bring Steve with him safely, if Mordo turned out to be planning a double-cross? Not that he could leave the child unattended - for pretty much the same reason - but maybe with Vision -
It took Happy a little longer to get it, but then his expression also fell. He didn’t look mad, oh no. He looked
There were signs of more recent habitation inside the base. The doors had been rebuilt, and then forced open again - courtesy of a supersoldier, no doubt - and there were supplies stacked near the entrance, mostly food rations. A supply run? Someone had re-occupied the base fairly recently, and Rogers had interrupted during a vulnerable moment. They'd tried to close the door, Rogers had fought...
Vision interjected, “To be fair, mud wrestling is not common for Courting Ceremonies even in this modern day. That is just a…Tony Stark feature.”
“We all know that, but celebrity comes with people being extra stupid about you sometimes,” Tony said with a shrug, leaning hard against Steve’s side to attempt to soothe him. He called over to Bucky and Sam, “Are you guys done yet?”
Wincing, Steve said in a wry tone, “‘Mister Stark, please ignore my existence while I spill coffee all over myself.’”
On day four, Tony decided he needed to be more hands on. He had demanded to see Steve’s toolbox which meant Steve had to go out and buy one since he didn’t actually have a toolbox in this house. Tony had examined each tool closely, most of them larger than he was. He had flopped and tumbled over the tools, and Steve had to rescue him when it looked like he was going to accidentally stab himself through his stomach with a screwdriver after he tried to lift it by its pointy end. And all Steve got for as thanks was that serious frown, as if Steve was impeding Tony’s learning process by stopping him from stabbing himself.
“They were lies. People shouldn’t talk about you like that,” Steve said in a flare of temper, only quieting down when he noticed someone sending him a startled look over Tony’s shoulder.
And before Steve could tighten his hold on Tony’s hands, Tony had slipped out of his grasp and moved into the crowd of people around them. Steve stared after Tony, tracking his bobbing head and scent until he was finally lost among the people.
Except Thor was back from Asgard now and Tony had managed to track Bruce down, exchanging text messages for the last month until Bruce agreed to a visit. Tony said he had an interesting idea on medical scans that had Bruce’s attention. And he was also enticing Bruce with special stretchy pants tech that would ensure the Hulk’s modesty wasn’t threatened every time he transformed. According to Tony, both topics seemed of equal interest to Bruce.
He turned his head, breathing in Steve’s musk and finally started mouthing at the hard erection presented in front of him. Steve’s mouth was a deadly weapon and he had Tony so distracted that he was hardly holding up his side of their position. Tony kissed up the thick vein on Steve’s hard cock, kissed until he sucked the plummy head into his mouth. Steve buried a groan into Tony’s ass before licking in again, causing Tony to hum in pleasure around his mouthful.
“Thanks,” Tony said, in a tone that hinted that he was laughing at Steve. “How about you? You seemed to know it was me even before I spoke.”
“I thought there were more interesting things closer to home base this year,” Tony said, his voice flippant, but his gaze dark and serious.
Tony’s heat passed in a blur of ecstasy and discovery and joy and desire and pleasure. He came back to lucid moments of being fucked into the bed, voice crying out with growing pleasure as Steve drove into him, only to plunge back into the maelstrom of overwhelming heat and want.
“You think too highly about yourselves,” Ty sneered, not even pretending to be polite anymore. “What is with all the ploys for attention, Tony dear? First, the unseemly Courting Ceremony at
Tony was thoroughly dejected by the time they got back to the tower. He seemed to have really been fascinated by the dragons, even getting close enough to touch one of the smaller ones, eyes widening and mouth falling open in an expressive O when he laid hands on their scales. Steve had been tense and stiff the entire time, because even a small dragon could sink sharp teeth or breathe fire onto people. But Tony had walked away with no injuries, only looking dazed and even more enraptured over dragons.
Slowly, bit by bit, Steve slid down the wall, his legs no longer able to hold him up even with the support. He collapsed with his back against the wall and Tony moved up to straddle his thighs, hand still squeezing around his knot.
“No, to whoever sent you as the most hilarious undercover agent in S.I.. I’m guessing one of the U.S. agencies with an acronym as a name, probably S.H.I.E.L.D., based on what you can do,” Tony speculated, sounding calm. “Let’s talk it out. What do they want?”
But Tony wasn’t listening anymore. He couldn’t. He felt hot, a desperate surging heat that boiled through his bones and blood and left his skin smoking with the need for touch. He knew what would slake his thirst, knew what he needed.
Steve took Tony out onto the beach, discreetly carried in a bag, and kicked off his sandals. He waded into the water up to his knees, behaving like he was just admiring the sunrise. Then he bent down and Tony splashed out of the bag into the shallows, as per their usual routine.
Steve lurched into motion, grabbing the two discs and practically throwing himself back towards the couch, his arms outstretched. Calmly, Tony reached up and removed the dull disc in his chest.
“I didn’t ask you,” Rhodes pointed out with a casual shrug. “I already know you’re serious. Probably the whole world knows you’re serious except Tony Stark.”
Tony hummed. “When you put it that way, it does seem a little much.” But he didn’t sound repentant at all. In fact, he sounded like he was grinning.
The smell of roses and sunflowers permeated the space and filled Steve’s lungs. It was sweet and delicate and nothing at all like Tony. He had no idea why this was called
Steve’s cupped his cheek gently, which cut him off. Looking at the creases at the corner of Tony’s eyes, brushing a thumb over the laugh lines around that expressive mouth, Steve said, “No, I’m not surprised by that. And you look good for any age. You’re gorgeous, Tony, I didn’t think you needed anyone to tell you that.”
“What happened, Tony? How did you change your size? And why did your chest mechanism go out?” Steve asked with no small amount of anxiety.
Before he had come to any firm conclusion, there was a short announcement from Happy calling everyone back into the hall for the final moment of the Courting Ceremony: Tony’s choice.
The corner of Tony’s lips ticked up and he murmured, “A technicality, huh?” And Steve understood what he meant. It wasn’t a very strong excuse for presenting more than one gift, but Tony seemed to accept it. He put the lid of the box aside carefully, like it was made out of the most delicate of precious material instead of cardboard glued together.
T’Challa continued, voice a little softer, “But to be honest, M’Baku did not consult Nakia and myself before he entered as a suitor. It’s a surprise to me as well. I’m almost certain that while his interest in Tony is genuine, he has no interest in a long relationship with him since he did not speak to us first. We were led to believe that such a ceremony as tonight’s is likely to be mostly scripted and a short term distraction. If M’Baku was more serious, he would put more effort into drawing Tony’s attention instead of spending his time bedding as many people as possible here.”
So Steve had watched as Tony bought new and better and more expensive sheets and pillows and pajamas and robes. Tony had scattered all of these items around their bedroom with haphazard lacklustre. Meanwhile, Steve slowly introduced soft and worn pillows, requested that F.R.I.D.A.Y. disabled the fragrance dispenser in the penthouse for now, brought in the comfortable plush throw from his bedroom that Natasha had given him and he had used regularly. He watched with satisfaction as Tony always sought out the items Steve had brought in until finally, Tony threw his hands up and gave all the newly bought items to charity and declared that nest-making would be Steve’s job.
“You’re both bad in different ways,” Rhodey said, sounding aggrieved. “And you know, they got together at your Courting Ceremony so you’re kind of to blame for this.”
To Steve’s disappointment, Tony released their clasped hands before he flopped down onto the couch, immediately unbuttoning his suit jacket. Steve chose to sit right next to Tony despite the ample space on the couch. To his relief, Tony didn’t wince or move away, simply shrugged off his jacket and threw it over the back of the couch. He turned to face Steve, right leg tucked up underneath him.
“Oh, don’t, now you’re giving free PR to these scentears companies,” Tony joked. “I can see it all over the headlines now:
With a harsh, punishing thrust, Tony’s length was seated inside of Rogers’ body once more, so deep Steve could feel him in his stomach.
Tony lost himself in the heat of the moment, Steve’s muscles pinning him, making his dick twitch. He was getting close, he could feel all his blood rushing down south, his heart thumping loudly, his shortness of breath.
A soft female voice pierced the shadows, ‘You sure about this, sir? This could blow up in our faces,’ Maria Hill said, taking a step forward out of the shadows.
‘We’re over. Goodbye, Stark,’ replied Steve as he made it past the automated door, never daring to look at Tony again. As he marched on, a single tear fell down his cheek, warmly caressing the curvature of his jaw. The hurt he felt travel his body was more than any injuries he received at the hand of Stark.
‘Dammit Rogers, stand down! It won’t m-make things easier for you…fuck, so tight….’ A rugged palm connected with the curve of his ass, sending a red streak across the flesh there, stymieing Steve into place.
‘Most would argue there is plenty wrong with me,’ Tony smirked at his own joke. ‘You know, you aren’t trying very hard, Rogers. I thought you wanted our friends out of that place.’
'Woahh there! That's not very nice. Look, you even made me come here and find you myself,' Tony argued nonchalantly, his tone light while his eyes portrayed anything but, furious that Steve had disobeyed his orders.
‘If you’re asking if I have ever been coerced for sexual favors, my answer would be no.’ Steve paused, swallowing the lump in his throat, his voice devoid of emotions.
For a brief moment, it looked as if Tony contemplated something. He must have found it, because his wicked grin grew larger and his eyes twinkled in delight towards his prey.
‘Fuck…’ Breathless and his breathing ragged, Tony savored the coppery taste of Steve’s essence, making sure the other could see him.
Tony grunted, his pace sporadic. He felt his orgasm building. Even in pain, Steve’s erection never waned. He could feel the other man tense, fighting the incoming orgasm.
He hadn’t seen Bucky since he left after their argument and in a rash decision, Steve decided to up and move them to a new, hopefully safer, location.
‘Wait, did Cap just crack a joke? Wow, never thought I’d see the day…’ he teased, his tone mocking ‘…but seriously, we’re supposed to blend in, and trust me when I say this; you won’t fool anyone with whatever that is…’ pointing at Steve’s bland white polo shirt, his long beige baggy pants, and his plain cap.
With resolve in hand, Steve exhaled through his parted lips as he quietly did an about face towards the veiled figure sitting on the couch.
. Why can’t you fucking get this through that thick head of yours?’ Tony muttered with vitriol at Steve’s head, the stabs of his throbbing cock amplifying in vigor.
‘Like I have your thumb up my ass, what do you think?’ Steve snarled through clenched teeth, his body pushing against the intrusion.
Had Tony….? He shuddered, knowing exactly what it was that tickled his entrance. Tony’s thumb had made quick work of him as it was already pushing past his rim. This wasn’t pleasant at all.
‘Oh! Hmmm….Ah…G-God…T-To…ny!’ Steve’s eyes shot open, a white flash blurring his vision. He was leaking all over the sheets. He could feel the wet patches.
‘Really? I thought you enjoyed yourself plenty, Rogers. Who knows, you might change your mind,’ snarled Stark. His sharp wit was always a result of his fears.
Also, it has come to my attention that they are super soldiers. I am aware, but I like to believe that they can be like regular people and have dreams and still get undisturbed from them if they feel safe. It is fanfiction anyways ahahah.
‘Oh! What do you know?’ Tony corked an eyebrow, his twisted smile impossibly cocky. ‘You like this, Rogers…You like me fucking you hard?’
He thought, while keeping his pace steady, his impulses driving his body to the edge. His mind fogged up from Steve’s strong masculine musk as well as his pathetic struggles and moans while his eyes remained glued to the man’s cheeks engulfing his length.
It hadn’t rained much lately, but there was a stagnant fog in the air tonight as the Super Soldier cut through it effortlessly.
‘Say hello for me!’ Tony barked as he chuckled, enjoying the flicker of anger passing through Steve’s eyes, hoping for a reaction.
‘And why exactly do you need us?’ From his previous work with Shield, the soldier knew that they sometimes liked to omit certain pertinent details. He felt there was more to the story than that, he felt it in his gut.
It was him being defiled by Stark the first time. It made him sick, the heavy pounding of his heart threatening to give out. He forgot to breathe for a short moment.
‘Not so perfect now, are you? I fucking hate you, Rogers…you deserve this…goddammit…I-I won’t last much longer…’
Tony had on a pink button-down Tommy Bahama shirt with green palm trees scrawled all over it.  He left the first few buttons undone, exposing a black tank top, obviously needing to hide his arc reactor somehow.  His shorts were navy blue and very short and his feet were clad with two simple leather flip flops.  Tony’s aviator sunglasses sat perfectly on the brim of his nose.
‘N-no. No.no…’ Steve felt it. His blood boiled with excitement. He found himself meeting his captor’s violent thrusts. In his panic, Steve didn’t realize Tony had stopped moving, letting Steve rock his hips on his flesh. He blushed when he realized he had been the one seeking friction.
To shield himself properly from the harsh temperature outside, he stepped inside his room and turned his back to close the door.
He didn’t mean to feel this way, he didn’t want this. Not now. His mind was tearing itself apart. He didn’t know how to stop this. He didn’t think Tony was in the right state of mind to stop either. His head was addled by betrayal and lust. For every involuntary buck of his hips and for every moan torn from his lips, Stark only seemed to sink deeper into darkness, encouraged by the degraded form of his former friend.
With that, Steve hurriedly slammed the door on Bucky’s nose, leaving no room for argument, which infuriated the dark haired man even more.
‘See? How do you expect me to work with that?’ Steve yelled, pointing at Tony’s childish outburst. ‘I don’t do undercover missions because I’m horrible at them. And you want me there with Stark? He can’t follow orders…at all. Natasha is better suited at infiltration, use her.’
The mechanic’s hands leapt up and latched on to the Captain’s blue collar, pulling him down for a bruising kiss. Steve almost lost his balance trying to keep up with the savage onslaught of his mouth. Steve was not prepared for the intensity behind Tony’s searing kiss.  Tony’s goatee rubbed against his fair skin, leaving red rashes and scrapes as evidence.
Even worse, Steve had gone and gotten off from all of this, which had simply added more oil to the already raging fire.
‘You can’t outrun this and if you don’t want others to pay for your stupid mistakes, you’ll do what the fuck I want. I tell you to jump, you ask how high. I call…You fucking answer that phone like your life depends on it.’
Tony didn’t care for such insubordination and locked Steve’s jaw in place, facing the softening flesh of his cum coated cock. Steve’s eyes flashed at Tony with a soft glare, begging him to stop there. The other man used his thumb to caress the side of his bruised cheekbone in fake affections.
‘Fuck, stop clenching…r-relax,’ Tony groaned as he tried to push past the ring of muscle he had loosened before, but he knew it was Steve’s way of telling him no. It only built his resolve more. Steve growled, his chest reverberating with anger.
Ohhhh! Will Steve have the last word, or does Tony plan on trolling Steve a little more? What about Bucky? Will he leave things be? Will Tony stay one move ahead of everyone else? Stay Tuned... The next chapter Phase 5 will look at a final confrontation between both men!
At least, I'm happy with the dialogue ahaha. Enjoy this conclusion for this fanfiction, hope you enjoy it.
That earned Tony a dangerous growl. Steve Rogers rarely swore, so Tony was taken aback by such an intense remark. Pristine black shoes took an involuntary step back as he saw the Captain’s features darkened suddenly. He did love to push the righteous man’s buttons, though. It made for such an attractive picture.
After taking the time to mark Cap’s upper body with rigorous bites and sharp kisses, it didn’t take long for Tony’s gaze to set on his long-awaited prize.
To have Captain America, the man who had made his childhood miserable, the man whom he knew he could never measure up to… at his mercy, whimpering under him; there were no words. He was drunk on it.
Tony’s anger abated a bit with Bruce’s kind words, hoping they held any kind of truth. He gave a weak smile in response.
‘What the hell’s wrong with you?’ Steve shouted back, growling at his friend, cradling his arm with his shaky hand.  ‘I told you, I’m fine.’
Tony's descent into madness. An introspection on what is going through his mind, how's he is pushing everyone away from him, causing Iron man's eventual demise. Starter point for the next fiction I'm currently finishing (part 2 of the dark Stark Chronicles)
Steve dared to raise his head, afraid of what to do next. Tony stopped breathing for a moment. Having Cap undress him slowly was making him sweat. He couldn’t wait to get the man on his knees. The Captain’s rosy, plump lips were sure to be a treat. For now, he could indulge.
Steve’s body was wrenched and folded in two, Tony’s chest and looming form hunched forward, pearls of sweat falling on his defined abs. His hand was holding and pushing Steve’s thigh in an awkward pose, paving the way for better, deeper access.
Banner circled his arm around Tony’s lean, yet strong shoulders. He had noticed something of a spark between Steve and Tony. At least from Tony’s end, what with all the shameless flirting and riling him up and whatnot.
Steve's grip faltered on Tony's shirt, allowing the man a bit of leeway to leer at Steve's current attire. Steve’s mouth was agape, his eyes big, making the blue of his irises drown in the white of his eyes.
Steve’s body ached everywhere, he was pretty sure one of his ribs was broken, judging by his raspy breathing. Nothing that wouldn’t be fixed before he got back home. First, he had to get his bearings.
He wasn’t nearly as prepared as last time and that made it worse. He tried to will his body to relax, but every time Tony pulled back, the girth of his length made the stretch more painful than the last. His skin was flushed, he felt hot and dizzy under Tony’s precise, torturous thrusts.
All he could do was hope for the best and make sure Tony got the information they needed that allowed them to rescue the missing SHIELD agents and unveil whatever it was HYDRA may have been up to behind in their new expensive vacation retreat.
However, as soon as his sole touched the carpeted floor, his senses alerted him, making his skin crawl.
‘G-good boy,’ Tony huskily applauded, earning him a soft moan from Steve’s lips at the praise. He gripped his prick harder, his fingers rubbing at his bludgeoning head, propping himself closer to Steve’s awaiting lips, all the while keeping a safe distance away.
Steve’s ass quivered, but remained clenched tight through his wrinkled pants. Steve’s glutes could be clearly seen giving his ass the beautiful curve it deserved, after so much work had been put into it.
‘Are you shitting me?’ Those large hands straightened, tense at the blond man’s side. ‘What the fuck is wrong with you, Tony?’
Steve choked on a lump in his throat as he took the bottle marked ‘Shower Gel’ and squeezed it harder than necessary until it poured out its contents in the center of his palm.
‘You’re lucky I like you on your knees. So how about it? On your knees big guy!’ chirped Tony, his brown eyes pointing to the floor. ‘And don’t make me tell you a second time,’ his ominous tone threaded with finality.
‘I have to say Cap, your costume doesn’t do your ass justice and that’s saying something, considering how tight it looks.’
Luckily, he hadn’t heard from Stark since then and he’d worked hard to keep it that way, regardless of what Tony’s letter had stated. He wouldn’t allow the other man to fuck with him any longer.
‘Make a sound and we’ll have a problem,’ Tony’s strained voice commanded, struggling himself with the need to simply fuck the soldier into the mattress and not cum right inside him. Sometimes he was impressed with his self-control.
He wouldn’t give Tony the satisfaction of seeing him react to his taunts, but it was hard when each thrust made his toes curl. He prayed Tony wouldn’t notice his very interested erection.
I hope you have a better understanding of Tony's reasoning for his treatment of Steve. Hopefully I have portrayed them well according to this situation. It took a long time, struggling to get the right emotion, but I think it came up nice. So, enjoy this last piece.
‘Well, someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed?’ Bucky said, walking past Steve. Steve gave a half-hearted glare in Bucky’s direction, who simply shrugged it off, the cup of coffee serving as a peace offering to which Steve gladly accepted.
As he headed towards the exit, the billionaire bent toward the crumbling form below him, his palm resting solidly on Steve, squeezing ever so slightly, to assert his dominance.
‘Are you deaf? What part of this is a fancy ass resort; this shit won’t fly where we’re going by aren’t you getting, Rogers?’ Tony snapped at Steve, not comprehending where the disconnect was with his explanation. ‘This ain’t a retirement home party, Cap. You’d get us noticed within seconds of reaching that island.’
Hope you enjoyed it! Next chapter will see Tony finally getting what he always wanted, but with horrible consequences... Let's see if STeve is a forgiving soul. Comments keep me happy and writing!
The droplets of water hugged his bulging pecs and fought against the towel drying him mercilessly. He circled and tied the towel around his waist, until he reached the cold emptiness of his and Bucky’s living quarters.
Tony leaned in, the sound of the chopper getting louder and louder as they drew nearer, ‘Just so you know, I have a reputation that precedes me and I can’t have you ruining that, undercover mission or not.  Anthony Roberts, Tony Stark, doesn’t matter…so get changed when we get there and try not to cramp my style, yeah?”
Oh god…Steve could feel the applied pressure aimed at his ass, he clenched in hopes of stopping Tony from assaulting him a second time, but all it did was pull him apart.
Comments are always welcomed and encouraged! Kudos fills me with happiness!! I'm surprised by all the support I receive. Thanks so much XD
Maria snapped back, ‘Enough, Stark, we don’t have time for this,’ as Maria swiped again, this time revealing a detailed blueprint and pamphlet of the island. ‘This is it gentlemen, Dreamland Island Resort, take a look…’ motioning behind her, drawing attention to the task at hand.
Tony began to reply, wanting to say something about an image he had to uphold and how he wouldn’t be forced into an assumed lifestyle beneath him…but then he bit his tongue.
‘Still, it was unwanted risky behavior.’ Steve’s hand ran up his face in exasperation, moving soft locks of hair from his forehead with his fingers.
Steve could only listen as his body was fucked hard into the wall. His hands tore into Tony’s shoulders, gripping hard. Tony winced, but continued on as he leered suggestively at Steve’s helpless body.
Steve slowly worked on pulling down his sullied underwear, the rough fabric scorching his skin until they pooled at his feet. His drenched shirt was next, joining the rest of his clothes on the cracked tiles of the bathroom floor.
Tilting his head to the side, he tried to reason with the man pressing down on his body, his breath heavy and warm at his back.
Thanks so much so far for the love and comments and kudos! I didn't expect much from this story, so thanks!
Tony didn’t waste time when his tongue licked his way up the base of Steve’s flushed neck, leaving a trail of warm saliva in its wake as it sent pleasurable shivers through that firm body below him.
Tony let his hard on settle on those plumped cheeks, the coarse material of Steve’s armored pants blocking his way as they partially covered Steve’s cheeks, hanging low on the man’s hips.
While his arm clutched at Tony’s dark, hairy forearm, he attempted a weak murmur, hoping to ease the grip.
‘T-Tony...wait-’ pleaded Steve, his words muffled by those warm lips devouring him. The soldier needed space; he needed to calm down. Tony didn’t stop, but increased the pace and ferocity of his bites, leaving streaks of red bruises along Steve’s large flustered neck.
Thank you for being patient! Here is the next short chapter. Thanks for my boyfriend for the edit. Hope you like it.
The aftermath of Tony's visit causes problems for Steve when Bucky confronts him about the other man's recently strange behavior.
He couldn’t stop the next words from falling out of his open mouth, tasting his sweat on the padded item at his head.
Tony enjoyed antagonizing his friends by arriving late for meetings. He enjoyed their facial expressions, ranging from exasperation, amusement or simply downright furious.
’Just because I don’t talk about sex like you do doesn’t mean I have no experience with it. It wasn't anyone's business...’ snarked Steve, hoping his captor wouldn’t get angry for forgetting himself. Tony looked at him, amused.
Tony could feel the resentment emanating from Steve as he shot the man a glance from the corner of his eye.
Maria stood by herself in silence, having watched the previous events unfold, as the two men boarded the helicopter and softly mumbled to herself, ‘We’re doomed…’
Tony wouldn’t permit Steve to detach from it all. His facial features were contorted in anguish, his teeth bared, his pupils expanded with a crimson ring over them.
‘Take off my jacket, slowly and be careful, that suit is worth more than you are,’ Tony taunted as Steve’s long fingers grazed the lapel of his jacket, tracing downward hesitantly, popping the first button out of its hole. Steve’s hands were shaking, causing him to fumble with the next buttons until he finally undid the last one; exposing the arc reactor as well as Tony’s lean stomach under his silk shirt.
Steve’s body rocked forward, his hands grasping the sheets tightly, twisting them within his grasp. His cries concealed by the softness of the pillow slowly smothering him. He prayed to God his pleas remained unheard from Bucky. The last thing he wanted was for his friend to witness his distress…. his shame.
‘Good boy,’ praised Tony, his teeth flashing in the dimly lit room. Shadows were cast on half of Stark’s body, his crimson suit giving him a villainesque presence.
‘Shut it, Clint,’ Nat shot a glare Clint’s way, shutting him up instantly while the others just went along with it.
This had to stop. His body was at the threshold of what it could handle. He wasn’t used to being touched after all. It had been so long, and Stark took advantage of that…his vulnerability.
Extending his calloused hand towards the space that separated both men, Tony beckoned Captain America towards him. His heart was pounding dangerously, pumping blood straight to his groin in apprehension.
Neatly handwritten words peaked out of the paper, next to the screen of the phone that pictured Steve’s painful cries when Tony had assaulted his mouth with his hungry cock during their reunion.
‘I know what I said,’ as Tony slowly pushed down the darkly tinted glasses that rested on his face while shooting a quick wink in Clint’s direction before haphazardly sliding the glasses back into their normal position.
Tony cut Steve off mid-sentence, ‘Come on, Capsicle, why the long face? I’m a joy to be around,’ Tony ended with a wink.
With a flick of her wrist, Maria dismissed the bright holograms, leaving the room to bask in darkness. She knew she’d be met with protests from Captain America, but this was getting out of hand and fast.
crossed the stern looking man’s mind as he turned around in Natasha’s direction, seeing a waving Tony and Maria Hill making their way towards him.
Tony’s nostrils flared as they took in Steve’s natural musk. He made sure to take in all he could for the future, committing this to memory. His nose brushed Steve with feathery light touches all over the length of his exposed neck, sharp teeth indenting those quaking, broad shoulders.
Steve’s moans went straight to the genius’s cock. The tension coiling at Steve’s flesh only made the friction sweeter. Steve’s weak whimpers quickly escalated to full blown wails as Tony finally hit his prostate.
‘No…No, Sir, you... didn’t.’ This pursuit at humiliating him was something Steve wasn't used to from his friend. Tony might rue over his power over him, but he sure as hell was not going to look at him.
‘Where’s your bag?’ Steve twirled on his foot, showing his duffle bag, leaving Tony utterly unimpressed.
With a mouthy exhale, Steve stepped into the small tub, permitting the hot water to hit his face, his lips partially parted. He shut the nasty curtains behind him.
oh oh! Bucky is awake. What will happened. Will Steve finally get the help he deserves or fold and fall for Tony's sinful touches..... I thrive off comments, so comment away! thanks so much for the support and kudos!!! until next time... Next chapter, the conclusion....
‘Anthony Roberts and Steven Evans...’ Steve muttered as he opened the envelope to peer inside, fishing the two passports out, handing Tony his.
‘That’s because it didn’t exist until 2 months ago,’ she said as she flipped through her tablet once more, showing missing person’s files, ‘Before our agents went missing, they managed to link the resort to several missing person’s cases. Furthermore, SHIELD keeps a record of potential criminally involved individuals, and some of those individuals have found themselves at the resort.’
Bucky felt the breath leave his chest as he tried to calm his rapidly increasing adrenaline pulsing through his veins.
Dark, toned fingers circled around the Soldier's pale wrist, simply resting there. Steve's eyes darted to Tony's bemused ones.
Both men faced each other. The deadly silence in the room was palpable. The blond-haired man quickly found his sharp tongue and cut the silence as he made his way past Tony, their shoulders bumping hard. Steve didn’t look back. He could feel Tony’s glare on his back.
Hello guys, sorry for the late post, I was in Japan for vacation, therefore we slacked up a bit. Here is the new chapter. Hope you enjoy it!  Tell me what you think!
He was squirming in his seat. The thought of having to go on a mission, alone with Tony, didn’t please him at all. He couldn’t believe it was even under consideration. The two of them hadn’t been the best of friends, although he had tried without much success. This mission would be a disaster, their personalities were totally opposite of each other. To be honest, Tony’s constant bickering, disregard for orders, and nonchalant attitude drove him up the fucking wall.
Tony scooped the recently discarded phone off of the ground and hastily tossed it back into Steve’s clammy palms.
Tony snickered to himself, his lips twisted into an evil smile while his eyes burrowed deep into Steve’s. He raised himself, the clatter of his heels bouncing off the walls threateningly.
Tony spared a glance at the soldier’s blood-filled dick as it slapped against his balls. He bit down on Steve’s neck, his next words muffled by the sound.
The thin, yet fit woman put her hand on the tall blond man’s shoulder in comfort, which stole a feeble breath from Steve’s moist lips. Steve’s nerves were getting the best of him, ‘Still…This mission doesn’t feel right…’ went past his lips in an inaudible mumble.
OMG...this is so hard to write...I just want them to kiss and make out, but I can't argg… hope you enjoyed this chapter and its light flirting. Will they actually focus on their mission, how will Steve react in the next chapter upon finding out what type of resort this is? Stay tuned! Comments keep me going and are super appreciated as always. More will come! Thanks again
With only seconds to spare, Steve barely managed to push down his wrinkled shirt, hiding the remainder of his temporary marks, before the smell of freshly brewed coffee assaulted his nostrils, in the hands of a very still Bucky.
‘T-taking you down a peg or two… I've had many… p-pleasurable nights thinking about you submitting to me…fuck…you keep swallowing me up…such a damn whore, Rogers…’ Dark, coarse hair flew as Tony’s head went back, his eyes rolling to the back of his head in ecstasy.
He opened the letter, carefully reading it. Not believing what he had read, his eyes were glued to each word over and over again as it sunk in.
‘Sure, Steve. Go on...Do it.’ Tony spit the warm blood that coated his teeth onto Steve’s face, hitting the side of his cheek.
Tony kept fucking Steve’s plump ass in earnest, the tall man’s inner walls squeezing him so hard, Tony had to keep himself from cumming right then and there. Tony’s eyes rolled to the back of his head when he felt the man clench around him. He licked his lips wantonly.
The proximity between him and Bucky made him squeamish. The Captain felt dirty as if Tony had wormed himself in and laid his disgusting larva inside him, corrupting him. He didn’t want to show this weakness. He needed to get out, process everything. Bucky’s presence only amplified the panic he felt crawling in his bones tenfold, ready to burst out dangerously.
Steve yelped and yanked his hand back forcibly, Steve’s fiery gleam piercing Bucky’s own unwavering stare. Tension built up in the atmosphere as both men got ready to fight.
Seeing Steve’s face lose its color brought Tony closer to orgasm. He rocked his body forward while Steve choked.
‘This says otherwise,’ Tony’s right hand left Steve’s neck to slither under Steve’s crotch, finding a hard mass in his palm, tugging it. ‘I knew it…Can’t get enough of this, you fucking whore…’
‘That’s right, man! Cap can be a bit stiff about these things, but I’m sure he’ll figure things out. Deep down, he knows there’s no one he’d rather work with,’ cheered Clint, poking at Tony childishly.
‘I mean I didn’t know which would say ‘thank you’ more: flowers or a fruit basket, so, you know me, couldn’t resist, I got you both…’
Whatever power Tony thought he held over the Captain, he felt it evaporate slowly as he looked up at the silhouette towering over him. His nose twitched at the rich, manly, earthy scent that reached his nostrils. To anyone else, this man would look intimidating; but not to Tony Stark. He was Iron Man and right now, he knew Steve would play house.
When the lift arrived, the doors opened to reveal Tony Stark, eyebrows shooting up and eyes widening.
After almost an hour of talking strategy and what army they could marshall, Tony got up all of a sudden and sauntered over to T’Challa. The discussions paused as Tony seemed to examine T’Challa, sniffing his hand on the table.
The half-fish-person rolled his eyes, which didn’t seem like something a hallucination should do. It just looked so normal on a strange being like that. Steve finally figured out that the being was gesturing at Steve’s hand, like he wanted them to shake hands or something.
And damnit, but Steve did want to learn about Tony’s kind. This was the most interesting thing that happened to him during his extended holiday. Tony must have read the softening of Steve’s resolve on his face because he flung his hands up in the air in clear excitement. Of course, that cut off their contact so Steve couldn’t hear whatever Tony might be saying. Tony quickly grabbed Steve’s finger again, grinning.
“Ugh, I’m supposed to be the one with all the smart comebacks,” Tony complained, before looking down at the bracelet. He looked up from beneath his dark lashes and said, “Well? Aren’t you going to put it on me?”
Letting out a huff of laugh, Steve did as he was told. Tony was all of eight inches high and he was still telling people what to do. The head of Steve’s cock was wet with pre-come, the tip flushed from arousal after that spectacular scene.
His senses were battle-ready, his adrenaline high but his nerves calm because he was prepared and he knew in his heart that he was the most compatible with Tony.  It was the most important mission of his life and he had spent weeks getting ready for this day. He knew he could do this.
Steve sighed. “Why spend time on the gifts when I knew no one was going to accept them, not with the way I looked back then? I only gave them because Bucky kept trying to get me to do double Courtships with him.”
“Mister Stark has asked that I introduce myself.” The voice was coming from the black disk and the blue sphere pulsed as the voice spoke. “I am J.A.R.V.I.S., an acronym for Just A Rather Very Intelligent System. I have been created by Tony Stark to be in essence, his butler and his communications specialist with the outside world. I can facilitate his work around the house and assist with his business ventures. At this moment, everything you say is being picked up by my voice-to-text program so that Mister Stark can read it on his tablet.”
Tony jerked as Steve’s knot pressed against the inside of his hole, locked in tight so Steve couldn’t go anywhere. The thought sent another wave of pleasure through him, how he was holding Steve in place so Steve couldn’t go anywhere. He rolled his hips back, only minute movements but enough for his prostate to be massaged by the hard cock pulsing in him. Steve couldn’t move much anymore but his body was still shuddering and jerking, as if out of his control, as his knot lodged into place and shot come deep into Tony’s body.
. One might buy pillows or blankets for nesting before the first shared heat, but you didn’t buy furniture for Courting Ceremonies. That fleeting thought about Tony’s heat and what they might do together to prepare for it was enough to make Steve squirm and feel warm under his collar.
Tony could feel Steve practically vibrating with anger beside him. Having heard similar things and worse before from the likes of Ty, Tony rolled his eyes and sighed. “I’ll hold a Courting Ceremony if I want to, Ty. Much as you wish otherwise, you don’t get a say on what I do. And for all your big talk now, I remember you gate-crashing and climbing onto stage to beg for my hand. Are you having trouble keeping your company afloat? Big strong Alpha like you run your father’s company into the ground and now you need my fortune to save it?”
For some reason, Tony’s close proximity, the way he looked at Steve with worry, the way Steve could practically count his ridiculous lower lashes…
“I don’t think anyone can call you a regular anything,” Steve said fondly, stroking behind Tony’s ear.
And through his haze of grasping want, Tony realized that Steve wasn’t as in control as he might have seemed. That he was dancing on the edge as well.
Bucky’s curiosity got the better of him, and he peeked around the door to see Steve giving Tony a significant look. At that, Tony only said, “Uggghhhh…” and gave Steve a significant look in return. Bucky had no idea what either looks meant, but apparently the message was received because they went back to passionately kissing.
Hand in hand, they waded out further into the water, until they finally had to let go and start swimming instead. When they had swam far enough that they had to tread water, they turned to face each other. Tony was bobbing a little frantically in the water, having never gotten used to swimming without his tail.
Tony arched sharply, curling his arm around Steve’s pinkie and pushing forward into Steve’s gloved palm before pushing back hard into the pen, over and over again in frantic motion. His body tensed, backside visibly clenching and unclenching repeatedly until he spent himself, body shuddering as his movements slowed.
“Are you alright?” And all of a sudden, Stark was right there in his personal space, hands reaching out but pausing as if unsure what to do. “Damn, are you burned?”
“And cheeseburgers,” Steve continued, also thinking about how Tony hovered when he had some meat patties for cheeseburgers on a grill.
Tony said, sounding offended for all the wrong reasons, like a few million dollars was so paltry that thinking Tony had to steal it was just an insult.
None of this was doing much for his self-confidence, and he wondered if it was too late to join in the mud-wrestling instead.
The moment the word ‘penis’ passed through those pink lips, Steve deposited Tony as gently and quickly as humanly possible onto the couch and dashed for his bedroom. He heard Tony calling after him, which was a novelty to be able to communicate without skin contact, but he kept going until he reached his closet. He spent a solid five minutes with his head inside his closet, allowing time for his heart to stop racing and his cheeks to stop burning.
Tony continued. “The timing fit. You turned up here on vacation after the alien invasion, clearly in need of rest after a stressful ordeal. You forget your strength and speed sometimes. If the beach wasn’t so deserted most days, I’m sure everyone there would know you’re Captain America, with the speed and stamina you show when you jog. And your strong jawline and lovely mouth and pretty blue eyes are all quite distinctive, they’re hard not to recognize even from blurry mid-battle photos.”
Tony murmured, “More than okay,” and looked up with a smile. But something wasn’t right, because his smile was a little wobbly at the edges, and he tugged at Steve’s hand immediately, drawing him inside from the landing zone.
Tony reached up to his ear, touching the Scentears’ globe behind his earlobe before flicking the DUM-E earring so he could feel the little arm move up and down. He never failed to get a thrill out of that, and from the way Steve’s eyes followed his movements with that little smile on his face, he enjoyed Tony’s enjoyment.
“That makes sense,” Steve said carefully in agreement. “That’s what this whole Courting Ceremony is for after all. For you to meet people and be sure about who you chose.”
Without the haze of heat, it was pretty embarrassing to say aloud. But it was worth it when Steve pressed his whole body to Tony’s side and peppered his shoulder with kisses. Tony turned his head in invitation and received a kiss on the lips for his efforts.
He had to suppress a shudder at that. No matter how gauche, he would be asking for his gifts back, if… Well, if. He would probably be too heartbroken to dwell on those sketchbooks in any case.
When Tony licked and groomed both paws and his side, he finally leapt lightly off the stand to land beside Steve and stalked away, tail swaying behind him in annoyance.
Steve nodded stiffly, not even able to imagine Tony wearing a scent like this. “Thanks, but it’s not really what I was looking for.”
“I suppose I have to learn to blend in with other two-legs,” Tony said with a huff, like blending in was completely beneath him but he would try.
Steve would miss the constant contact, but he thought it was a fair exchange to have Tony here, in full size, able to talk to him whenever he wanted.
He remembered the Scentears salesperson talking about how they had been inspired by Wakandan earrings, but he hadn’t realized that there must be some Wakandan Courting ritual tied in with the earrings as well, involving wearing their partners’ symbols and scents.
Tony reached out and brushed a thumb against the lines between his eyebrows, trying to smooth them out. “Tell me.”
“It really is,” Steve murmured, and then added, almost absent-mindedly, “I guess John is pretty cute as well.”
Tony grimaced and then shrugged, caught out. “An amalgamation of magic and tech is always tricky. There are risks.”
Steve and Tony shed a couple tears as well as they exchanged their wedding vows and wore the wedding necklaces that matched their engagement bracelets in color and scent. They twined their fingers together and swore to be together to the end of their lives.
Before the Whip Guy could attack him with his remaining whip, Tony was on him, grabbing the whip straight on with his gauntlet, ignoring the surges of electric shock and blasting the guy with a repulsor from his other palm.
Instead of speaking through their minds, Tony made a high pitched squeak that ended with a click, the sharpness of the first note enough to make Steve wince.
There was a small splash in the water and Steve found himself even more astonished when the little being propelled himself out of the water to reveal that the lower half of his body wasn’t legs, but a fish tail with vibrant red scales that shone with a golden glimmer in the sun. The little...half-fish-person flopped onto the rock and waved at him, gestured incomprehensibly with a small hand.
They were civilians so there was naturally some panicked shouts and confusion at first, but they started moving, which was good enough for Steve.
That seemed to cause Tony to shift in embarrassment, which pressed his crotch up against Steve’s finger. Tony let out a startled short moan. It wasn’t easy to feel at that size, but Steve thought he could feel a small hardness against his finger.
Tony leaned the canvas carefully against the side of the box before reaching into the box again. It was another canvas painting and Tony ducked his head when he stared down at it. After a quiet minute, he showed it to the audience again but made no commentary. He only looked at Steve, eyes soft and warm.
Tony scoffed. “No, that’s not what this Courting Ceremony is for, and that’s not what I meant. I meant, I wanted to be sure that you’re sure.”
Then, he felt the slightest nudge, just a faint pressure against his shoulder where Tony’s hand rested and there was the brush of a knee against his own, and Steve moved accordingly, stepping back. Caught in that sharp gaze, Steve had no time to look at his feet, to fuss about where his elbows were. He found himself automatically following Tony’s lead, moving to the steps based on Tony’s cues.
“There are short courses for that,” Steve said. It was the only way he could have included this gift when he needed a theme of some sort to tie all his gifts together.
On the fourth morning, Tony’s heat broke. It had been easing back for most of the night, allowing him to sleep for a total of five hours, which was more than he had slept in a stretch over the last three days. He had woken up with a desperate need for Steve all over again, ridden him hard twice over before falling asleep right on top of Steve’s heaving chest. But when he drifted awake once more to Steve wiping a washcloth over his thighs, he felt clear-headed and calm.
“You know... Obie was a terrible person. And he’s to blame for a lot of things, many of which I didn’t find out about until right before he died or well after. But surprisingly, he isn’t to blame for the pictures being leaked out,” Tony said.
“Thank you,” Steve murmured, touching a thumb to the corner of Tony’s lip in reverent awe, loving when Tony’s soft lips quirked up in amusement.
Steve frowned and said, “That game was cute, but what does that— wait, you made the Sea Garbage Party game? The puzzle game where all the pictures were little garbage in the sea? It’s the new bestselling game! There was even an article about it…”
The crowd went wild, the cheering and clapping reaching thunderous volumes. Tony’s charisma and showboating was working overtime, so it made sense that the crowd was reacting accordingly.
T’Challa’s eyes were wide. So was everyone else’s as they all stared at the sight of Tony curled up for what seemed to be a nap on the King of Wakanda’s lap.
“I want to make the world a better place,” Tony said with a smile, before his eyes brightened with mischief. “And I want to talk to you about the Avengers initiative.”
T’Challa sighed before saying, “The mask is from Stark. As I’m not a suitor, there is no real need for my anonymity and I suppose he thinks this is funny.”
“Tony, you’re so wet,” Steve whispered, the words so dirty but earnest, a statement of the situation made filthy when issued from Steve’s lips.
Anyway...furniture. He couldn’t believe he had considered furniture as an appropriate Courting gift.
Tony scrabbled at Steve’s shirt, at his tie, feeling abruptly beyond impatient and unhappy that there was so much lying between his skin and Steve’s. He demanded, “Take it off.
While everyone prepared for the upcoming alien invasion, Bucky trailed after Steve and Tony who seemed to be determined to explore Wakanda together. Well, perhaps Tony was determined to explore Wakanda and Steve was determined to stick close to Tony. Bucky stared as Steve and Tony both sat in front of the field of goats, their tails almost touching as they watched the grazing goats. It was surprisingly peaceful as they watched the goats for at least half an hour.
“That reminds me,” Tony said brightly, wriggling away from Steve a little so he could pull out a little box from his jeans’ pocket. He held it on his palm in front of Steve and offered it up. “A gift.”
Steve reached up and cupped Tony’s cheek, brushing a thumb below his eye as he gazed up at Tony. It was enough to cause Tony’s lashes to flutter, aware that he himself was also hapless under Steve’s own tender touch.
He leaned in and Steve tilted his face up for a kiss on the cheek, both angling their heads automatically so that Steve wouldn’t be smacked by the faceplate. They had learned through trial and error on this. Steve smiled as he felt soft lips and facial hair against his cheek, remembering a time when a much smaller, feather light kiss had been bestowed on his cheek. How things had changed. His life had been a whirlwind ever since Tony arrived and he didn’t think it was going to change any time soon.
T’Challa gestured at his ears, turning his head so Steve could see both lobes one at a time. On one side, there was an ear stud of a finely carved roaring ape, probably made of the famous Jabari wood Steve had heard about. On the other side was a gleaming green stud, a painted knot that Steve thought he had seen on Nakia before. Now that he was standing so close to T’Challa, he could smell the waft of M’Baku’s earthy scent, the smell of cold fresh snow, intertwined with Nakia’s fiery scent of waiting ambers buried in ash. They were coming from the earrings.
After a moment of examining the box, Tony looked up with wonder in his eyes. “Did you paint this box?”
But all of that was reliant on Tony’s large brain and his keen observations. He could look at something in a glance and figure out what was lacking, what was needed, what could make things better.
Steve had spent the most time painting Tony and he thought it showed. Tony was almost glowing with happiness in the painting, the corners of his eyes wrinkled as he laughed in sheer delight.
“According to F.R.I.D.A.Y., he’s an ex-employee from Viastone. He seems to be saying that his product line’s failure to capture the market is the fault of Stark International releasing a similar product earlier than he did, so he wants Tony to pay for it,” Nat said, sounding long-suffering.
Then, Tony spoke up, “They’re worried about the two massive power surges they detected here. They probably rushed over expecting to find this little seaside town nothing but a smoking crater, with your holiday home at the center of the blast radius.”
He looked around, completely confused. To his sharp ears, that didn’t sound like a man speaking from somewhere inside his house. It sounded like a voice that was coming from a set of speakers. But it wasn’t from his television or his radio, and it didn’t sound like something from his phone.
Tiberius paled and allowed himself to be escorted away. He shouted over his shoulder, “You’re just a has-been, Tony. You think you’re so great? Nobody really wants an old, dried-up Omega like you, they only want your money!”
Because Bucky was right. When it came to the dancing, he was screwed anyway. There was no point thinking about that right now. Steve forced his eyes to the stage, forced his considerable attention onto what was happening on stage.
Lifting them out of the box, Steve took a sniff of the globes behind the earrings and groaned. He shot Bucky a glare. “You told Tony about our shopping trip before the Courting Ceremony.”
“Welcome home, Sir. Good morning, Steve,” F.R.I.D.A.Y. said, because it was morning. Very early morning.
“Because you hate that,” Steve said, sounding almost dazed. “You hate if anyone behaves like you need protecting. I wanted to snarl and bite, but I know you hate Alphas behaving like idiots around Omegas.”
Tony groaned, almost collapsed back against Steve. “You noticed.” He sighed, squirming until Steve loosened his hold a fraction, enough for Tony to turn around and stare at Steve in confusion. “Why didn’t you say anything?”
Steve looked between J.A.R.V.I.S. and Tony, smiling. “Wow, Tony. This is really…” He shook his head. “You’re amazing. You’re both amazing.”
Trust him to ask now despite all the months of talking. Tony reached a hand back and gripped Steve’s head, pressing him tighter as he bared his neck to Steve’s mouth. “Yes, yes, do it,” he gasped.
The Japanese ambassador Yamato, whom Tony was talking to before Alexandre and Vicente had appeared again, blinked slowly at this suddenly graphic description and turned to Tony. “I believe I must take my leave now. Let us talk again later when everyone is more settled down, Mister Stark.”
Their group walked along the curved wall of the vast hall, ensuring they kept a vantage point of the wide open area out of habit. The whole place had been sprayed with a mostly neutral scent of spring water, the only way to mask the scents of so many people in one place. Scents from individuals were still detectable, but they had to be standing pretty close. Right now, Steve could only smell the comforting scent of his team as they walked close together, the familiar scent that let him know they had his back.
Tony swung onto Alexandre who was smirking and looking smug. Oh, that expression just pissed Tony off even more. Didn’t any of these idiots realize that Tony had much more important matters at hand to deal with, specifically one over-stepping Omega?
He watched as Amber suddenly leapt up into the air and breathed out a small fireball into the air. The attack didn’t seem directed at anything as she dove through her own fire and then flew around the room. Rather than be concerned that Amber was randomly spouting fire in the common room, Tony and Clint both clapped.
Then he felt it...a thumb swiping up through his slick, gathering it up until the digit touched lightly over his hole. Tony pressed backwards, felt his body try to open, slick dripping even more in anticipation and want. But Steve didn’t press in, just let his thumb rest there against Tony’s fluttering hole. Then his hand disappeared and Tony was confused, upset, wanting Steve back…
They were courtship bracelets, metal weaved in with fabric so that the fabric could soak up scents. The bracelets had been worn on Steve’s wrist for days already, so it strongly carried his scent. If Tony wore one of the twin bracelets, it would be a symbol of his acceptance of Steve’s courtship, signalling to the world that Steve was seriously courting him. Steve would wear the other bracelet, so they would be a matched pair, and they would swap the bracelets with each other from time to time to keep the scents fresh.
He blinked, feeling hoarse and not really knowing why. He felt wrung out and thoroughly soaked, could feel his ass and thighs just drenched with his slick and probably Steve’s saliva.  Then Tony realized his mouth was still around Steve’s cock and his throat was sore because he had choked himself on that hard intrusion while he had come his brains out.
Steve turned and gave the cold metal a kiss, knowing Tony’s sensors would pick up on it. “Then you would complain that I was being overprotective of you.”
He was about to ask for Clint to try to find a shot from a higher vantage point when he saw the cafe wall beside the attacker start to shimmer. Then a small golden ring seemed to boil into existence on the bricks and Steve was certain he was looking through the circle into the Avengers’ common room. Amber darted out of the little portal and with lightning speed, her long neck snaked around the attacker’s shoulder and her jaws clamped down hard on the man’s fingers, wrenching them away from Tony’s neck.
Tony reached over and picked up the remaining bracelet, turning Steve’s hand over so he could put it on him with nimble fingers. Their hands touched, matching bracelets brushing together on their wrists.
Raising his eyebrows, Tony asked, “You’re impressed by how I leaked sex photos of myself? Your baseline for being impressed is really low.”
that my weight has dropped dramatically since you insisted on putting me through a ridiculous training regimine that, may I point out, nobody else has to do!”
That got everyone else’s attention. They all stared at Steve in worry, which did not help his tripping heart and clammy hands.
“I’m glad you think so,” Steve said, looking back at him from beneath his dark blond lashes, blinking slowly. What an outrageous flirt! Tony loved it.
His friends must agree because they were all a few paces back from him as if afraid they would be trampled by his flailing feet the moment he moved. Before he could slink away to lick his wounds, someone tapped him on his shoulder. He turned and found hands on his own, guiding him into a new slow dance.
Because that Omega had just reached up and whispered something in Steve’s ear. He had leaned up and moved in close enough that his cheek had
The orchestra had been replaced by a band some time during Steve’s complete distraction, a group called Steely Dan according to Sam. Natasha informed him that a little stage was also set up outside as well for magic tricks as a different form of entertainment. That had Steve wondering if Tony had arranged for that because he knew Steve found sleight of hand and the magic tricks that seemed almost like mindreading fascinating.
“Look, people, it’s my party, and I’m going to do what I want,” Tony said, which was such a Tony thing to say that Steve found himself shaking his head and smiling at the same time. “If you don’t like it, you don’t have to be here. Actually, that’s the part I’m coming up to. I’ve just decided this is a Courting Ceremony for everyone.”
Steve stared at him, boggled. “You taught yourself how to read?” Because he remembered how proficiently Tony had used his phone and devoured information from the first day. “And wait, you don’t have written language?”
Steve would be worried he had offended Tony somehow if Tony didn’t sound so shocked and thrilled at the same time.
Tony wiped a hand over one cheek, the rest of his face thankfully free of semen, and said, “That was literally raining come.”
“I didn’t know that was a common practice. Back in our day, the one being courted kept all their suitors’ gifts, even the ones they didn’t choose at the end,” Steve said a little faintly, distracted. It had been unusual Courting Ceremony behavior that Tony had accepted and rejected gifts, instead of just accepting it all and making a final decision later.
“Did you order this using my card?” Steve asked, not angry because he really could spare the cash what with all his back pay. But he did wonder how Tony made the payments.
Before Steve could say anything, Doctor Strange turned to the tablet Steve was holding, looking at the screen. He addressed Bucky directly, “You’re still in Wakanda, yes? Please tell T’Challa that Wakanda’s help will be needed as well. This is no time for us to be disunited. We’ll need everyone we can muster to save the Earth, possibly to save the entire universe.”
Finally, Steve looked up from his forearm and said in a quiet tone, “You’re right, that’s not the point. I’m sorry I tried to make you jealous even when I knew you were so close to your heat. I messed up your hormones and reactions during your heat as a result.” He looked a little pale but his face was set in resolute lines, seemingly upset with himself.
Steve had gone for his morning run, pushing hard for miles around town and along the beach until he was finally out of breath. After that, he lay back against his usual slab of rock, letting his hand fall into a rockpool and graze against the moss-covered rocks. It had been high tide in the morning but the water had receded now, leaving behind beautiful, emerald pools of water among the rocks. He closed his eyes, tried to calm and center his mind. He liked to spend at least 20 minutes just stretched out by the beach, absorbing as much sunlight as he could.
There are individual Courting Ceremonies and open Courting Ceremonies. For the individual Courting Ceremonies, one person is courted by multiple people. At the end of the Ceremony, the person will choose their preferred suitor and they will enter into an extended Courtship after that to be sure they are compatible with each other, with the aim to eventually get engaged and married.
Tony didn’t bother to even react to that question. He just lightly stepped off the table onto T’Challa’s lap. Then he circled the lap once, twice, before curling up on it, tail wrapped tight around his body. Resting his head on his paws, Tony closed his golden eyes and seemed to relax.
“Yep, no idea what the hell that was, but I’m not surprised at all,” Rhodes said with a shrug. He thumped Bucky on his shoulder as he walked by. “Don’t worry about it, they’ll work it out.”
It takes them hours before they make it to the town, the afternoon sun beating down their backs. Steve had eventually put him down after many mock-complaints and they set themselves to walking.
“People were hung up about knotting inside an Omega for the first time during heat,” Bucky corrected, looking at Steve with a telltale smirk. “Not sex in general, but knotting.”
Oh, it was ridiculous that such a sappy thing could make Tony want to arch up into Steve’s hard body, could make his stomach clench in want and his body get wetter in response.
It's Monday somewhere in the world still, right? Sorry about that... I went on a road trip and time became meaningless once I got back!
He had worried that the earrings were too silly and childish but went ahead with it because ultimately, he felt that it would appeal to Tony’s whimsical side and his love for his bots. Watching Tony’s excited smile as he showed off the earrings, Steve thought he made the right choice.
He lapsed into silence for a moment. Steve asked quietly, “What happened to the damage to your heart?”
“It’s not going to be you for much longer if you don’t come back to bed,” Tony grumbled from his nest of blankets and pillows, enconsed so comfortably in it that he didn’t seem willing to even sit up.
Loud, impatient knocking started against the front door. Tony only smiled and shrugged when Steve looked at him questioningly. So Steve sighed and went to answer the door. At least Tony didn’t look perturbed so it couldn’t be that bad. Maybe Tony was just kidding around and that was their pizza arriving.
Did none of them realize that Tony was way past the ideal child-bearing age? Did they even consider that he had no interest in having kids? Well, they probably did and were just saying whatever to get a roll in the hay. Who really cared? Certainly, not Steve Rogers, who hadn’t even looked over once even while two idiotic unbonded Alphas practically pursued Tony around the room. Oh no, Steve was much too busy chatting for the last
When Tony’s tongue flicked against his own lips, Steve opened his mouth and learned the taste of Tony’s saliva, lips, tongue, mouth. It was breathtaking. This was Tony. He was kissing
He walked into the shop and looked at the prominent display on a stand right by the entrance. On a deep blue velvet cushion was a delicate round bottle encased in finely wrought red metalwork, the bottle containing a clear gold liquid. There was a smaller tester bottle beside the cushion and he picked that up to spray a little of the scent into the air.
Tony was sheer determination squeezed into all of six inches and he wasn’t going to let something like a body not compatible to dry land or human-sized tools stop him.
But his caveman hindbrain clubbed cool and logical sense over the back of the head and went charging out.
“It’s the latest fashion, an idea we’ve picked up from the Wakandans, although they don’t call it Scentears,” Lee said with genuine excitement. He started explaining to Steve, “The original Wakandan earrings are made from a special Jabari wood imbued with scents, but obviously we’ve no access to such special wood. What we do here instead is make these earrings with tiny little globes that sit behind the lobes. The little globes contain scents, to better enhance those sweet spots behind our ears. We have a whole range of beautiful earrings
“Come on, maybe we can try some last minute lessons here,” Bucky said, sounding resigned, his usually soothing Beta scent souring with a hint of anxiety. “Now, move, come on, you go. Yeah, count it, one, two three, one, two,
“We were too busy holding Stevie’s hand through his panic attacks over his plans to court Tony,” Bucky said. “Didn’t have time to pick up the phone and gossip, sorry.”
“Wow, it’s amazing,” Tony breathed, even getting off the stool to admire it from a few different angles. Steve's gaze haplessly followed Tony's form, unable to stop looking at Tony's bare shoulders revealed by the shirtless waistcoat ensemble. When Tony walked around the box, Steve had to frantically think about cold showers and Red Skull's face. The waistcoat was cut low in the back and Tony's bare shoulder blades were right there in front of him and he wanted to lick them, to trace the dip of Tony's spine.
Rubbing his forehead, Bruce frowned. “I don’t actually know. It’s hard to say with the two of them and it’s not like getting turned into animals is actually scientifically logical in the first place. And with Steve and Tony, they’ve always had this silent communication thing going on as well.”
Bucky was rummaging in a small packet of popcorn that he had picked up from who knew where. He stopped to explain, “He was terrible at Courting gifts. He didn’t really spend any time on the gifts, just got whatever was easiest and fastest to obtain.”
“I can remove it,” Tony said, and then winced when he remembered another time when he had removed his arc reactor and shoved it into Steve’s hands. In terms of symbolism, he couldn’t have been any more obvious during that period of dazed dehydration. “If the light bothers you.”
Tony still funded the Avengers but it wasn’t like Steve was going to dip into the Avengers funds for a Courting gift for
Before Thanos can respond, a repulsor blast hits him from the side.  Even as Tony sends more repulsor blasts at Thanos from his watch-turned-gauntlet, he calls out, “Thor, ready to join the fun yet?”
“None of my fantasies could ever prepare me for your cock,” Tony said with wonder in his voice. When there wasn’t an immediate answer, he looked up to find that Steve was now blushing up to his ears. “Oh, so you can stand here with your cock proudly presented without a hint of embarrassment, but the moment I talk about my fantasies, you’re blushing?” Tony was delighted at this.
Amber finally released her grip on the man’s hand and flapped up to Tony, who welcomed her with open arms. She nuzzled into Tony’s embrace, sniffing him over and rubbing her neck frills against Tony’s cheek as if to confirm he was alright. Steve had no memory of moving, but he was suddenly standing right beside them too, patting Tony down urgently for any injury.
Lee said hesitantly, “That’s unusual, but we do have that in stock. I’m not sure if grass and coffee will go together though—”
Sam suggested, “Coffee, the smell of petrol from a fancy car, expensive aftershave, oh yeah, that’s the sexy stuff.”
Steve stared after at where Tony had been. For some reason, he felt uncertain, the first stirrings of worry. That was strange because it wasn’t something Tony usually said when he went for his swim.
Steve interrupted with tight anger in his voice, “Your venue was overflowing with suitors so they were clearly
Now it was Tony’s turn to laugh, long and deep. He wriggled up so that he could kiss Steve’s smile, taste his parted lips. When Tony pulled back, he said, “I’m glad you’re secure in who you are.” Then he grinned mischievously. “After all, you’re the Alpha of all Alphas.”
He arched his back, knew his hole was dripping, slick sliding down between the cheeks of his ass, open and ready for Steve. After all the days and weeks they had spent teasing each other, playing with each other’s bodies but never going all the way, Tony was desperate for Steve now, desperate to feel him deep inside.
“I wasn’t actually considering them as scents,” Steve protested. “I was just thinking aloud when that salesperson was asking what things you like.”
The little robots were new additions to the various things Tony had scattered around the house. For such a small merman, he was taking over quite a lot of space, not that Steve was complaining. Tony had several miniature machines, and he had even made the two little bots to help him with, well, making more things.
He was underwater, quite a distance from the surface, and when he looked around, it was mainly just blue water all around him. Did it work? Did he—
“Might be,” says Tony, cupping his fingers as he peers down at the doorway behind the counter. “Heeey!! Scuse me, paying customers here!! Hello?! Is this an honesty store?”
Maybe Steve’s panic and distraction helped, because before he realized it, he had Tony in his arms, their hands clasped together and Steve’s other hand resting around Tony’s waist. Steve felt frozen in place, staring into those bright eyes, large and rimmed with dark lashes, peeking through from behind the eyeholes of his mask. Distantly, he realized the music had started up again, but he couldn’t do anything about it. He had completely forgotten what was involved in dancing.
“Steve, please,” Tony said, not knowing why he was saying that, except that Steve would know, Steve could...could…
Tony swam about in his little plastic bag, trying to look at the bathroom from every angle. He popped back up and grabbed Steve’s thumb where he was holding the edge of the bag.
, at least not by the standards of most people on land. He was speaking like how Tony used to, through the mind.
Thor had taken Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard shortly after. Clint had been benched as they had tried to figure out if the mind-control by Loki had been completely removed, while Natasha had been sent almost immediately on an undercover mission where she was completely out of reach from everyone. Steve had withdrawn to an isolated seaside town to lick his metaphorical wounds and try to handle his feelings of loneliness after being woken up almost 70 years into the future, discovering all his friends were gone, being thrown head first into a battle with
Absently, Steve noted that there were gold accents at the collar and buttons of the waistcoat, but otherwise, he was too busy staring at Tony’s bare biceps and strong forearms. He drank in the way the halter of the waistcoat drew an upside down V close to the neck that emphasized the breadth of those shoulders. The waistcoat didn’t cut too deep down the front, just enough to reveal sharp clavicles and the dip between pectorals. From just above the waistcoat’s collar, there was a hint of glowing arc reactor and nanite container.
Steve danced with several strangers after that. He didn’t want to be seen as breaking the rules by only sticking to his own friends since the point of the masquerade was for the guests to mingle without knowing anyone’s identity.
But otherwise, the place was mostly empty except for a document cabinet filled with knick knacks instead of files and an old table that, based on the plaque on its side, was a model of the 1974 Stark Expo.
“Genius doesn’t stop for reminders,” Tony informed him with a sniff, taking the empty chair beside him. He leaned over to the other side and gave Rhodey a cheek rub too.
He had gone to the lobby for his usual coffee break and was in the queue when he spotted Tony walking in through the front door carrying a silver suitcase. At first, Steve wanted to duck his head and avoid being seen after the last two disastrous encounters.
“It’s Tony. It’s the exact thing he would do,” Steve said, leaning back with a faint smile. “And it makes sense. With the number of applicants and short amount of time he has before the ceremony, you’re the only one who would be able to interview numerous people at the same time. You can probably go over all the application forms and make decisions in minutes. And he trusts you.”
Sweet relief swept through him and Steve closed his eyes just for a second as he relished the sound of that voice in his mind. He opened his eyes and looked down, seeing a small bobbing figure, a tiny hand against his shin. It was such a light touch, he hadn’t even felt it.
It took a surprising amount of effort to get Tony into clothing. For one thing, there was a lot of complaining from Tony while Steve averted his eyes. Then there was the fact that Tony was still wobbly on his feet and needed help to get dressed. Steve was flushed to his hairline and had been staring mainly at the floor the whole time he held Tony up, helped him manoeuvre his legs, pulled on his clothes…
“I…cannot say for sure, Captain. My systems seem to have been tampered with,” JARVIS said with a note of worry.
“Wait until the media circus lands, you might change your tune then,” Tony said with a sigh, like he expected this piece of information to scare Steve away.
“It was partially from surprise,” Natasha explained, but she looked proud of her team’s destructive capabilities in all forms. “I don’t think he expected Tony to still be able to use his nanites in cat form. And for Steve to still be able to smash things with his shield.”
The party had been filled with rich and beautiful people, and Steve hadn’t known a single one of them. Tony hadn’t turned up yet to his own party and Steve was mainly hiding in a corner scarfing down tiny hors d’oeuvres before big robots came crashing through the glass doors and tried to attack the guests. Steve had been forced to jump in and take the robots down quickly to keep the fleeing guests safe. It hadn’t been that hard to use the robots own weaponry on each other as they weren’t very sophisticated compared to Iron Man.
Even though Steve had opened the box in a hurry because he had his suspicions on what it would contain, he was still faring no better and was staring back with an open mouth as well at this tiny version of Tony.
Steve was pretty sure his shirt was a size too small, the seams of his sleeves constantly at risk every time he bent his elbows. And his pants were so tight that he couldn’t stay seated for too long. He really needed to speak to Coulson about the sizing of the clothes; there had to be something wrong with them.
Except Tony started incorporating cheek kisses into their daily routine as a necessary show of affection and gratitude, according to Tony.
Tony let out a loud outraged ‘MIAOW’ in protest, and then continued to scent mark Rhodes. Laughing, Rhodes rubbed Tony’s cheek with his fingers, which seemed to be enough to appease Tony’s grumpiness because he went limp in Rhodes’ arms.
“Is it just me or do they seem really unaffected by what happened to them?” Bucky asked, a little plaintive. He felt emotionally drained after a day of shadowing Steve and Tony but the people who should be most affected by the transformation seemed to be taking it completely in stride.
“Sounds gauche,” Alexandre said with an elegant shrug. “We put a lot of importance on the ability to provide and on the personal strength to pass on a strong line.”
“Of course, our friendship forged in battle is not so easily broken. I will look for a suitable home for this snake,” Thor said and swooped forward to plant a heavy kiss on Tony’s lips. They couldn’t see much more than the back of Thor’s long blonde hair but his large hand could be seen cupping the side of Tony’s face as he tipped Tony’s head back.
“Let’s not keep everyone waiting, hey?” He stepped forward to the front of the stage and bent at the waist, stretching an arm out. Smiling, his eyes bright with warmth and happiness, Tony asked, “Do you want to join me on stage, Steve?”
Things were better between them. They were friends again, bond reforged through loss and a shared goal.
“Don’t try and pacify me with water,” Tony says, but he takes the water anyway. “Listen, just because I can’t kill someone with my thighs or shoot an arrow from a million feet awayㅡand honestly, Clint needs to stop shooting arrows off of roofs and hoping I’ll catch him because one of these days I might actually forgetㅡbut oh my god, why do I have to run every morning, Steve? I could be spending extra time in bed with you.”
Steve’s heated blue gaze left Tony feeling like he was breathing in fumes, like he was wading through thick steam from evaporating water.
Sometimes, Steve had to remind him to get back into the water, right now, when he forgot how long he was out and his scales had started to dry out. Tony always grumbled but he still hopped into his glass, swishing around in frantic circles like that would speed up his body soaking up the seawater again.
“Shall we dance?” T’Challa asked. When Steve hesitated, T’Challa continued, “I know you are here as a suitor to Stark. From your earlier panic, I think I might be able to give you pointers.”
“They’re bullying me, Steve, stand up for me,” Tony complained, slinging a metal arm around Steve’s shoulders and leaning the side of his helmet against Steve’s cheek.
Fury’s expression was unimpressed, clearly noticing the deflection. “Where are you from? Your identity is falsified and didn’t exist until a couple weeks ago.”
A growl ripped out from deep in Steve’s chest, loud enough that a few of the audience members around him started to edge away. Both Bucky and Sam poked him in his sides until he stopped growling. Steve took deep breaths, trying to remind himself to stop acting like a caveman.
Steve wasn’t sure if they were still together, but on one of his visits to Wakanda, he had walked in on M’Baku backing T’Challa up against a wall, large hands cradling T’Challa’s head. The way T’Challa’s hands had been tangled in M’Baku’s furs, pulling him down so that their lips met, had been telling.
Steve had to grit his teeth and look away. What the hell did he have to offer Tony over T’Challa, Nakia and M’Baku, the combined trio that included royalty, intelligence and power.
But regular office worker Steve Ranger probably couldn’t, so all Steve did was turn his head, hiding it as an instinctive flinch. Steve took a hard skull full on to the side of his face. He had avoided getting his nose broken, mostly because he didn’t want to deal with a nosebleed right now. But he still felt an explosion of pain around his left eye. Steve didn’t even have to fake stumbling back and clutching at his face with one hand.
Steve looked down and gasped again, except he realized that if he gasped, he would swallow seawater.
Then Tony drew back and Steve’s eyes fluttered open, just in time to see a lithe pink tongue sweep out along Tony’s lower lip, as if chasing Steve’s taste.
The flashy red and gold suit took a circuit around the room, flying in graceful criss-cross loops before speeding back to the stage that was closing up again. Tony flipped in the air, light as a butterfly, and then dropped right out of the air to land with reverberating impact on one knee, his fist on the ground for balance. He held the position, probably basking in the adoration of the clapping and shouting crowd.
“Sorry, Caplet, I don’t know why she hasn’t warmed up to you yet. If you set the drink on the table, I’ll get it myself,” Tony said apologetically.
Steve knew his worries were absurd, but it didn’t stop him from running faster and faster until he had almost worked himself into a lather by the time he came back to the usual spot near the rockpools at the allotted time. He waded into the water immediately and stood there, breath coming in fast and chest heaving. He held his breath, waiting.
“This looks like it’s walking the line between classy and completely over-the-top,” Sam commented on idly as he looked around the place.
During the chitauri invasion, the World Security Council — which S.H.I.E.L.D. reported to — had tried to nuke New York in a move of extreme stupidity. Bruce in his Hulk form had grabbed hold of the nuclear missile, jumped to the highest building, and jumped through the portal with the nuke. He had fallen back out eventually, crashing on top of a building. But when they had went looking for him, all they found was a building with its top five stories destroyed by heavy impact, and the Hulk was nowhere to be found.
“Is that so hard to believe?” Steve asked, before saying softly, “I gave you my sketchbooks. You’ve seen what I draw.”
But Steve didn’t have time to daydream about Tony’s gorgeous shoulders and back or stare at the other suitors. His slight worry from earlier was turning into a full-blown panic. The tips of his fingers were actually tingling as the back of his neck broke out in cold sweat.
Tony groaned, rocking backwards on Steve’s fingers. “I’m drenched, you asshole. Please, Steve, please…”
They must have broken so many speeding laws. Time seemed fractured, jumbled up. Suddenly, Tony was looking out at the buildings speeding by. Suddenly, Tony was in the basement, watching as his car door opened and Steve held out a hand to him. Suddenly, Tony took a deep breath and realized they were safe, safe, safe and…
For some reason, that sent a spike of lust through Tony, knowing he had pulled Steve to this point just by presenting, by showing him what was his anyway.
Then he held Steve’s cock upright and sat on it, his hole easily sliding down the large cock after hours — days? — of fucking. Tony groaned and shuddered at the thick length filling him up, filling him up to the brim. He rocked back, fucking himself on Steve’s cock, because that cock was his, all his to use, only for Tony’s pleasure, for Tony to kiss and suck and ride and fuck himself on.
instead. Steve tried not to have thoughts about Tony in lingerie because he was in public and he didn’t need to explain why he was suddenly sending out possessive and aroused pheromones.
Tony moaned, clutching at Steve’s legs, mouthing mindlessly at one knee. Ugh, even his knee was perfectly shaped.
Tony looked up through thick dark lashes, probably not realizing what a potent gaze he had. “Guess I need to get used to balance first. Talking seems a lot easier than walking.”
“So you would come over to where I was immediately,” Steve mumbled into his own forearm, trying to hide his face.
. Although, maybe if I just licked you…but would you even feel anything? What if I wore a condom on my whole body—”
