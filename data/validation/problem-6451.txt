“Makes two of us,” Lifting his mug in salute, Tony tried to keep the pity out of his eyes. Jesus. Rogers had been a rather large pain in the ass since they’d met, but he couldn’t imagine what it was like dealing with the Chitauri and Loki and everyone you’d ever known being dead or ancient and not the same at all at the same time. That had to be a bitch.
Squeezing his hand back and staring into his eyes, Steve scooted closer to Tony on his knees, so that their faces were only a few inches apart, the table hovering over them. Tension rolling through him like lightning, Tony swallowed, eyes on Steve’s face and Steve’s lips and Steve’s mouth.
It was a pretty good ending to the Mandarin disaster, and Tony sat exhaustedly on his couch, grinning like an idiot.
It worked, but wasn’t enough. The bomb exploded before the plane had been given time to get far enough away, and clipped the right wing. With a terrible noise that drowned out even the engines, the plane spun, dovetailing rapidly, knocking everyone off balance. Even Tony clattered against the wall, unable to stay upright, and he cursed up a blue streak, trying to right himself.
“I think it would be great. We can get up to all sorts of trouble in the Californian sun, and the Malibu house has great views. Plus, it’s a chance to get away from the cold for a bit. You’ll love it. What do you say?”
“I…Jesus, Steve, are you serious?” Feeling all the blood leave his face, Tony considered the possibility, the ramifications of it. And felt like he was doused in ice. “Holy shit. Holy
“His JARVIS,” Thor replied, gesturing to the ceiling while Tony pushed away to pace and mutter to himself. Loki had the Tesseract and had some kind of game going with the scepter? Was he planning on letting it tear them apart again, like it had on the helicarrier? Fuck. That was going to be a bigger problem than he’d thought, he needed to find his suit and repair it
He’d be having quite the conversation with Anne Marie about how the hell they got them once this wrapped up. They’d spent weeks hunting those down, dammit, and it wasn’t so a wrecking crew could become a pain in his ass.
“Well, when we get home and you’re all healed up we’ll go flying more often,” Tony said, then cleared his throat because far too many emotions were about to break through. Steve liked flying with him? No one liked flying with him. Pepper hated it, still gave him glares when he mentioned how he’d flew her to safety after the Vanko disaster. And Rhodey would also insist he liked having his own suit, he didn’t need to be carted around by Tony. “But we’re going to have a proper take off and landing, none of this jump crap, not unless we’re on a mission and I have plenty of time to make it to you in time, or there’s no choice, okay? You and Clint, I swear, you’ll be the death of me. But I will catch you, if you fall. You know that, yeah? Of course you do, that’s why you leapt out of the freaking plane. But I gotta agree, flying is something else. Maybe I’ll make a special grip on the suit’s shoulders so you’ll have somewhere to hold on. Or something. I’ll figure it out. And then we’ll be all set. We’ll go flying anytime you want, Cap. Alright?”
They were becoming a team, a family. The Tower was often filled with laughter and arguments when they were all together — Clint was a slob and hid in vents, Nat was tidy and hated clutter. Bruce was a combo of the two, Thor had a tendency to forget he didn’t have attendants, and Steve was neat but left his sketchbook and pencils everywhere. Tony couldn’t remember a time in his life when he had felt so at home around others the way he did now.
Her gaze softened. “I know that, Tony. I just wanted you to be prepared for it if I refuse him and we take a hit.”
Air vanishing from his lungs so fast he saw stars, Tony gasped, fighting to get his arms around Bulldozer to pull him the hell off. While he did that, Bulldozer reared back, and rammed his head into Tony’s stomach again, hard enough to make his head hit the back of his helmet, rattling his vision.
Nodding, Steve reached out and started yanking at the manual release options, grunting as he did so. Ears ringing like he’d been in front of the speakers at a rock concert all night, Tony watched him, brain fuzzy and slow. Something was off in the way Steve tugged at the suit, but he couldn’t place his finger on it.
“Yeah,” Tony said softly back, because, you know what? The Mark II and III did deserve some recognition. They had saved him in more ways than one, especially the Mark III. It had fixed the ice problem and saved his ass from Obie. “Although technically the first is in pieces in a desert in Afghanistan.”
Also, we are gearing up to head into IM3 territory! I know some people aren't super fond of it, but I have a bit of a soft-spot for it...
Tony frowned. “Well, yeah. Thor can’t leave until we find his brother and fix his magic rainbow road to get home, and I told him we had plenty of space. I mean, you can’t expect him to help us from New Mexico, can you? So, I told him he could have a floor, and bring his genius girlfriend, who I wanted to meet anyway, and….Pep? Why are you frowning at me? What? What’d I do?”
Deciding to let that go for now, he snarled at her instead. “What the fuck did you bring me here for, Hansen? What did Killian get you into?”
“Thanks, big guy. I can take it from here,” Tony managed, the back of his neck burning. Dammit, the guy had picked him up like he’d been some pretty princess in distress. Not the best way to impress the much larger teammates.
And since he set her up so perfectly, Natasha popped out from behind the two goons, and quickly swung up and over the shoulders of the first one. Tony couldn’t blame him for the surprised grunt — he knew damn well if Natasha hadn’t given him a flashing glimpse of her red hair, hadn’t wanted him to know she was there, he never would have seen her, either.
“That’s absolute crap,” Bruce said, so vehemently that Tony would have taken a step back, if he’d been standing.
“That’s not gonna do a damn bit of good, let me out of here. Maya!” he shouted, but it was too late. She was gone.
Snorting, Tony poured his precious coffee into two mugs and strolled over, offering one to Steve. “A bit of a mess is an understatement, Cap. But I know what you mean. I can’t sleep, either.”
“I don’t…” Tony began but stopped at the strangled noise that sounded behind him. Whirling, Tony turned at the same time Steve did to catch Clint looking like a fish on a hook, eyes wide and horrified.
Sleep beckoned, but right as Tony walked into his bedroom, ready to flop into bed and try to pass out, JARVIS spoke.
“It’s what I think,” Steve said. “And I thought you should know. I didn’t want to keep it from you.”
Please don't judge Nat and Thor too harshly. They really thought they were going to help! Also, the "can't eat, can't sleep, reach for the stars, over the fence, World Series kind of love" is totally a quote stolen from It Takes Two. I have it my head that Darcy made Tony watch it with her some morning he was half-awake after a night in the workshop
“Those people would be wrong,” Steve repeated, and looked Tony straight in the eyes. Tony couldn’t help but get a little lost in his intense gaze —  Rogers had an insanely intense stare game going.
So when the call came in, he groaned, knowing instantly what it would be about. It came from Shield— Tony supposed there really wasn’t any way around that. Refusing to answer Fury’s call for aid would have sent up way too many signals, so after having JARVIS hang up on him once or twice, he answered the call, and agreed to help. Tony, Thor and Steve took off to face the group that was wreaking havoc on Mid-Town. Bruce went as well, but drove in an SUV so he could stay back to help run interference with the Shield agents that were there (and keep a close, close watch on them), and bust out the Hulk as needed.
“Look Sammy, I’m really, really sorry ok? I will explain everything, just please don’t be mad at me?” Dean asked somewhat desperately.
Dean started waking up and the first thing he felt was a pounding in his head, the second thing he felt was a lurch in his stomach. With the lurch, he bolted upright, briefly noting an asleep Sam next to him, and then ran to the nearest bathroom. As soon as he found the room, the contents of his stomach come up and he threw up into the toilet.
“The girl I was dancing with offered it and again I thought…” Steve raised his eyebrows, “Well, the same as before,” he finished. Tony’s small smile went unnoticed.
Oh god. The drugs. ‘What did he even take?’ he asked himself. Dean sat back on his heels and then he felt a hand on his shoulder. He flinched and turned; hands ready to fight.
Steve couldn’t control his anger as he punched the man over and over again. He didn’t know how long it was until he felt Natasha’s small hands on his shoulder. He moved back and Nat stepped in front of him.
Tony sighed heavily and lifted a hand to cover his face. Steve noticed his husband’s stress and pulled him aside.
Dean just gave his cheeky smile and pulled it over his head, once again ignoring the pain shooting through his back as he moved his arms and pulled the hoodie down over himself.
When the team noticed Dean, they all smiled. Sam gestured with his head to the empty seat next to him and Dean made his way over to his brother.
Dean gave an affirming nod but remained silent, his pain was starting to come back a little more and he didn’t trust himself to speak.
When breakfast was over, Steve and Natasha were left in the kitchen with the pile of dishes and mugs. They were loading the dishwasher in a comfortable silence. Once they were finished, they walked into the living room where everyone was sat watching cartoons.
Once they reached the room, Steve knocked but they received no answer. They knocked again, but again didn’t receive an answer.
Sam heard a door slam and ran downstairs to see Dean passed out on the floor. “Oh shit, Oh shit!” Sam exclaimed as he rushed to his side. He dropped to his knees and placed two fingers on his throat. ‘Oh, thank fuck,’ Sam thought as he felt Dean’s pulse. ‘Thank god Dean taught me how to drive.’
The husbands looked at each other and then back at the boys, “Okay, we’ll see you back there then,” Tony said.
When he entered the room the smell of scotch got a lot worse and began to sting his eyes. ‘Seems like he’s been drinking all day,’ Dean thought to himself as his father stood up from the couch and swayed a little.
Dean didn’t respond, but he turned his head to look at Steve and that’s when he smelled it. The tequila on Dean’s breath.
As soon as Sam had gotten to his room, he pulled out his phone and created a group chat with the whole team and himself, excluding Dean, because Sam knew he wasn’t planning on using the numbers.
He was concerned, but didn’t go out right away, not until he stopped hearing the soft cries coming from downstairs.
He went to grab some clothes but realised he didn’t have any here. He sighed and pulled out his phone.
When he managed to turn, he saw Steve’s mouth move out of the corner of his eye. He ignored it in favour of getting the hell out of there.
When Dean got to the gym, after changing into suitable clothes, he saw Natasha, Clint and Bucky in there.
“I don’t know Dean, I’ve been sat here for two hours, I think I’m allowed to be mad. Just tell me what happened.” Sam stated, not easing up on his annoyed tone.
After the boys were shown to their respective rooms, Sam had gotten excited about the change of lifestyle and decided to explore the tower a bit.
He turned on the shower and let it get hot. He stepped under the steaming water and let it wash over his sweaty skin. The water relaxed his muscles and he could feel the body paint being washed off.
“Dad won’t stop,” Sam spoke, hushed, “Dean’s passed out and he won’t stop, I think he’s killing him.”
They were met by a very anxious looking Sam and Thor and when they caught sight of the teenager, they only became more worried. “What’s wrong with him?” a nervous Sam asked.
He stopped when he was in front of him, looking into his glazed eyes, then something snapped in Dean’s eyes.
“In 2008 there was a house fire involving the Winchester family. It seems that the mother, a one Mary Winchester, died in the fire, but her two sons and husband, one John Winchester, made it out.” Friday paused for a little.
Sam exited his room, expecting his Dad to have left so he could help Dean, but he froze at the top of stairs, looking down to see his father standing over an unconscious Dean, continuing to hit.
Dean straightened himself up and recomposed himself as if nothing happened. Something he learnt young was to cover the way he was feeling, no matter what it was. ‘Feelings are weakness. Do you want to be weak?’ His Dad’s voice rang through his head again.
Sammy stayed silent until they were in impala and immediately exploded with questions that Dean had to answer.
He kind of stood out against the colourful, happy crowd with his black hoodie, sweatpants and the haunted look in his eyes.
“Yeah, look, as much as we want to call CPS right now, we don’t want you to get that badly hurt again, so please just get in contact if it gets too bad.” Clint said, “And give your brother our numbers as well, just in case.”
“Yeah your gonna need those,” Sam said, pointing to a pair of crutches leaning against the bottom of the hospital bed.
“Just promise you won't do it again?” Sam asked softly. Dean smiled slightly and looked Sam in the eyes, “Promise,” he answered. The two sat in silence on Sam’s bed.
Dean averted his eyes and looked at the floor while he answered, “I don’t know,” Steve raised an eyebrow, “Thor hit me in the back and I know that it didn’t mean anything but it made me think of things and then you came closer and I thought you were someone else so I freaked out and just started hitting and then I realised what I was doing and freaked out again so I ran,” he said this very quickly and quietly so Tony and Steve had to strain to hear him.
“I’m leaving,” he started. The doctor looked as if he was about to interrupt when Dean spoke again, “I know the drill, just get me the form you need me to sign and I’m gone.”
“Ok Dean,” the voice began, “There’s a bathroom at the end of this hallway and on the left. I’m FRIDAY by the way, Mr Stark’s AI.”
“Wait a second,” Sam replied. Dean turned expectantly towards him. Sam reached over the side of the bed and resurfaced with a plastic bag, “You’re gonna need to put this around your cast.” He said.
Dean didn’t let his emotionless façade fall away and instead gave a small nod, saying, “Yeah ok. Thank you.”
Dean didn’t say anything and nodded minutely. He felt the bed dip slightly as the weight of the super soldier landed on it.
Bruce stood quickly and injected morphine into the IV line in Dean’s arm and he slowly drifted back to sleep.
Sam stood and followed, only to nearly bump into Dean when the older boy was stopped by one of the doctors that treated Dean earlier.
Tony reached the tower and flew through it to the med bay, laying the boy down onto a bed. Bruce was already back at the tower, along with the other avengers and ran to the side of the bed.
The team unfroze from where they were staring and started to go forwards to Dean and Steve, before Sam shouted stop them.
“It was,” Clint started, “But he just looked so terrified, so I figured this could let us know he’s still safe while we think of a way to help.”
He found a stairwell a just ran down as far as he could, exiting into lobby area and continuing to run out of the building, ignoring the odd looks he got from everyone and the flaring pain in his chest.
Dean turned and said, this time louder, “What the fuck!” In front of him was about twenty ugly blue things that he had never seen before and the avengers flying around and fighting about another ten just behind the ones stood before Dean.
“Well then, I can leave,” Dean said stubbornly and made a move to leave when he realised, he was shirtless. His anger faded away and panic replaced it.
“That doesn’t change a thing,” he replied somewhat calmly, trying to hide his worry. He made a move to leave but Clint put his hand out again, this time resting his hand on Dean’s chest.
“Well, it was nice to meet you and all, but I really should be going,” Dean said with his usual confident, some may say cocky, demeanour. He tried to step back, but Captain America reached out and grabbed his shoulder, making Dean flinch back quite obviously. ‘Damn it’ He cursed himself ‘now they would probably know something was up and they would have to move again, and Dad would blame me again and that didn’t end well last time.’ The last time a teacher had been suspicious of Dean’s home life they had called social services and Dad packed them all up and moved. That was one of the worst beatings he’s had. It happened about two years ago and he was in the hospital for two weeks and in a coma for a week and a half. When he woke up, he learned that Dad had told the doctors he had been hit by a car.
Dean surged forward quickly and pushed Steve, Steve was shocked and didn’t have time to prepare himself, so ended up falling down. Dean jumped onto him and started punching and didn’t look like he was going to stop.
Tony and Steve’s hurts broke simultaneously as they heard a small whimper come from Dean, one that sounded like he was trying to keep it in but couldn’t.
He sat down hiding the wince as his back moved. He grabbed the glass of water in front of his plate and took a big swig.
Dean quietly made his way to grab and apple for each him and Sam before motioning Sam to the front door. Sam stood without question and walked to the door, Dean following behind.
He then went to his closet and picked out some clothes to put on top of them to hide them, ‘It’s not like he actually needed the clothes with the whole fucking store Tony had stocked his closet with,’ Dean thought.
The whole team were on their feet the second Sam started talking. Tony linked the phone to the comms as they were all dressed in their suits.
The husbands were on their feet and out of the room quickly, speeding down the halls to get to Dean’s room.
Dean sighed and shook his head, “I don’t know,” he began, “I can’t really remember a time it wasn’t happening.”
Tony sped towards the tower, glancing down at the boy in his arms. ‘He can’t be more than 16’ Tony thought looking at his young face.
Dean opened his mouth as he had decided he would give a fake name and get out quick. But as he was about to speak, it suddenly felt like he had been punched in the lungs. He tried to suck in a breath but couldn’t. He couldn’t breathe.
Sam just nodded and took the apple from Dean, taking a big bite from it while Dean sped off in the direction of school.
Dean struggled to remember a time when he wasn’t covered in bruises or cuts that would eventually scar. His back, torso and arms were covered in scars, ranging from belt whip scars to knife scars to burns to anything else his Dad could get his hands on. Considering he was a hunter, he had very few scars pertaining to fighting monsters, most came from his father. There was also never a day without a bruise on him, and John didn’t seem to care about hiding it, Dean having a black eye or busted lip was kind of a weekly occurrence. It was odd to see Dean without some sort of bruise showing, let alone the ones that could be hidden by clothing.
Dean made another move to get off the bed, this time ignoring the pain so he could reach out and stand with the crutches. He looked down at his body and saw he was in a hospital gown. Dean groaned again and asked, “Where are my clothes?”
He blinked his eyes open and saw Sam sat in the middle of the avengers and thought he was dreaming. He realised he wasn’t when Bruce stood up and walked towards him.
“Is that what it was?” Dean asked, trying to be his usual self, but it lacked his usually confidence.
Dean could see the truth behind the words in his eyes and surged forwards to hug him. He stayed silent through the gesture but calmed slightly knowing he was finally safe.
“I can press the pedals with one foot. Now get in the car Sammy.” Dean said with no room left for argument in his tone.
“Just call me Dean, and where’s the bathroom?” He asked, looking around not really sure where to look.
The brothers waited for Tony and Steve to pull out of the driveway, so that they could reverse out to, and then followed them back to the tower.
“It’s fine Sammy, I don’t need help.” Dean replied with a tone that told Sam to drop it. So, Sam just sighed again and went back to patching dean up.
When he got downstairs, he saw his jacket hanging up on a coat rack and went through the pockets, pulling out the keys to the impala.
The brothers got to the front door and as soon as they stepped in, Sam was running up the stairs, leaving Dean stood in the entry way.
He left his room for the bathroom but walking down the hallway he realised he had no idea where to go.
Dean woke up, and a searing pain flared in his back when he tried to move. It hurt so much that he cried out in pain.
Once the four arrived back at the tower Dean decided he wanted to go to the gym and work off some steam.
All the avengers went to suit up and once they were ready, they exited onto the streets and saw dark blue creatures about the size of humans throwing around cars and ripping up lampposts.
“Everything’s okay now, you’re safe,” Steve soothed once again. Dean felt a strong hand being placed on his knee, and even though he would normally flinch away, he knew that Steve wouldn’t hurt him, so he stayed still.
Once Dean was finished, he dropped down onto the floor and leant against the cold, tiled wall, the coldness cooling his temperature.
He immediately felt better. The loud bangs somehow relaxed him, it was something familiar, the smell of the gunpowder and the slight tingle in his shoulder from the kick back.
“what’s his name and what happened to him?” The female doctor asked. Sam panicked, he knew Dean didn’t want to be anywhere near hospitals, they might get suspicious.
‘Where should I go today?’ Dean thought as he was getting into the front seat of the impala. ‘Maybe just drive around, get a burger or something.’ And with that Dean was off, speeding away out of the school parking lot.
Dean wrapped his arms around his legs and buried his face in them, still struggling to take in air. All the marks on his body burned as if they were still fresh.
Natasha walked into the kitchen already dressed and sat down on a stool in front of where Steve was mixing the pancake mix. “Pancakes today,” Steve stated. “Delicious,” Nat responded sincerely, she always loved Steve’s breakfasts. Bruce entered shortly after grumbling something about coffee with his hair a mess and still in pyjamas. Next Thor walked in, chipper as always and sat next to Natasha. Bucky waltzed in after that, he was dressed but still half asleep. Less than a minute later Clint walked in but immediately slumped on the couch grumbling about someone giving him some coffee.
“I don’t need to tell you a damn thing,” Dean retorted, his angry glare once again appearing on his face.
“Wait a second, you need to tell us how the hell you took down twenty aliens by yourself,” Clint said after he pulled his arm away.
The boys looked at him in confusion and remained silent, but Dean nodded his head as a sign to carry on.
He danced with the random girl, floating on air. And then he and the girl were kissing. Her hands were everywhere on him, and his on hers.
“I picked up his face in New Jersey three days after they disappeared from the motel. It was on a hospital camera and it seems he was admitted under a fake name as there were no records of a Dean Winchester being treated there. The boy looked to have been seriously hurt and was in a coma for a week and a half.”
Dean looked through the closet and pulled out the loosest t-shirt he could find and a pair of baggy joggers.
Dean sat bolt upright in his bed, sweat dripping off of him and wetting the sheets. His breathing was ragged, and his chest felt painfully tight. He moved so he was resting against his headboard and had his knees brought up to his chest.
“Well, I’m Natasha, that’s Steve, Tony, Clint, Bruce, Thor and Bucky,” she replied while each of them waved when their name was called. Dean would have laughed if he weren’t so worried about Sam.
“Sam, we’ll be there very soon ok?” Steve said, trying to hide the panic and anger in his voice, “You need to stay on the call.”
“Ok, what can you do to fix it?” Tony asked, almost desperately. He looked down at the scars and bruises littering the young boy’s body and it made him want to throw up.
“Bad?” Bucky added disbelievingly, “He looked like he’d gone ten rounds with a fucking tiger or some shit.”
He bumped into a girl dressed in a bikini top and short shorts, with glowing body paint all over her body.
When Sam heard the familiar rumble of the impala’s engines, he slid off the wall and marched to the car grumpily. “You’re two hours late Dean,” He stated, annoyed, “Where the hell were you?” Sam asked while sliding into the passenger seat.
The avengers let out collective noises of agreement before they all turned to each other, ready to discuss a plan of action.
Dean calmed slightly and he didn’t know why, he should be freaking the fuck out but something about Cap and Ironman made him feel better. He immediately hardened his face and went back to feeling angry.
Steve moved to hold Dean just by his arm and took in his appearance. Dean had a glazed look in his eyes, his hair and clothes were messed up and he had what looked like glowing body paint in splotches and lip prints all over his face and down his neck.
He reached the driver’s side door and Sammy was already sat in the passenger’s seat. Dean started the car and drove off, again ignoring the slight struggles he was having breathing.
Sam stayed silent and made his way downstairs. When he was downstairs, he saw Steve and Natasha standing over his unconscious father, the sight made him happy and he briefly wondered if that was bad, but then he remembered everything his father had done and no longer wondered. He was happy.
“It’s a cream to put on you back, to help them heal,” he started, “You might need help to get some areas and you can ask anyone you want to.’’
“Ok, we should all split up and look, except Thor and Sam, Thor, Sam’s too young and someone needs to look after him,” Steve said, taking charge.
Dean really started to panic, and it started to show. ‘How the hell could they know anything about New Jersey?’ he thought.
Dean knocked on Sam’s bedroom door and heard quick footsteps on the other side. The door opened with force and before Dean could react, he had an armful of worried younger brother. “You're idiot,” Sam said but it was muffled.
“Answer me!” John yelled coldly but with force. Dean was forced out of his thoughts and tried to remember what he and Sam came up with.
Tony stepped back into his suit and picked Dean up, “I’ll fly him to the tower, you meet me there quickly.”
The unknown creature halted and swayed for about a second before collapsing onto the road. Dean raised his gun again and let out three more shots, again hitting the creatures perfectly between the eyes. They all fell, motionless.
Another four shots were let out and four perfectly aimed bullets hit their target, sending them down onto the other four Dean has already put down. Dean was letting out shot after shot, never missing and putting down eleven more. There was only one more because the avengers had finished the battle with their own lot. Again, Dean raised him gun, aimed and pulled the trigger. And again, it hit the intended target perfectly, sending the last one down, revealing a group of seven people who were stood behind the creature, now staring at Dean.
Sam had mathletes after school today, so Dean had a couple of hours after school to kill before he had to pick Sammy up. He was thinking he was just going to drive around for a bit and wait.
Dean looked down at his bare chest and sighed, ‘They’ve already seen it no need to hide them,’ he thought.
“Kid,” Steve began, “You need to get out of that house, but if you’re not ready to get help, then just…keep in contact please. And if things get too bad, call us,” he finished with a sigh.
“Is this what you guys like to do in your spare time? Stalk high school kids?” Dean asked sarcastically.
As much as Dean disliked his Dad, he did thank him for one thing, the 1967 Chevy Impala that Dad had given to Dean, even if it was just because his father couldn’t fix it so just decided to get a new truck. But with Dean being as well versed as he is in cars, he managed to get her working again, his Baby was his pride and joy.
“We’ve been searching for three hours and we still haven’t found him,” Tony complained, half angry, half panicked.
Steve looked at him sadly and began, “He’s in a cell at the police station right now and he’ll be going to prison for a long time.”
He stepped out of his room and headed down a hallway towards the kitchen, which was one big room with the dining room and living room as well.
“I didn’t give them one, just make something up.” Sam stated without emotion. He hated seeing his brother hurt and seen the many times that Dean refused to get help.
“Shut up Tony,” Steve retorted as he knelt down to check on the mysterious boy laying on the ground. “Oh god, he’s not breathing.”
Dean was sat on his bed trying to concentrate on his homework. He couldn’t get his mind to focus because he was trying hard not to think about his Dad coming home in five minutes. Dean tried not to be afraid of his father, but with the way John treats him, it’s hard not to be.
He left the club and started walking back to the tower, alcohol and drugs still coursing through his blood.
He started walking down the stairs and when he reached the bottom, he was immediately met by a fist to his face, enough force to throw someone to the ground, but Dean was so used to the beatings by now that he had built up a tolerance and didn't feel it as much as he used to. You see Dean and his family were hunters, so he was used to being roughed up by werewolves, vampires and anything else out there, and his Dad.
Everyone around him started reaching into the middle for food, and Dean waited until everyone was finished to grab some cheerios and milk.
Dean turned, walked over to his closet and opened it to find it fully stocked with nice clothes and shoes.
The girl turned around, her head coming up to the top of Dean’s chest. She smiled at him and then pulled him closer and started dancing with him.
“Good to see you awake,” Sam said. Dean just grunted as he made a move to get off the bed but stopped when a sharp pain shot through his left leg.
Bruce continued caring for Dean, cleaning and dressing his back. He then loaded him with pain killers, telling Tony, “He’ll be very sore when he wakes up, we should at least take away some of the pain,” at which Tony nodded.
The AI quickly started again, “That’s all I could find on them until about 2 years ago. I found a CPS file with the names Sam and Dean Winchester. CPS were referred to the boys by a teacher who noticed continual bruising on Dean and reported it. In the file it said that CPS sent two social workers to the residence the boys were staying in, a motel. Once the social workers knocked on the door and Dean answered, they explained themselves and Dean immediately tried to get them to leave.” FRIDAY took a short break to let the information settle.
Dean walked into the kitchen and when Sam noticed him, he smiled. It looked like he was trying to make bacon but failing miserably. “Here, let me take over.” Dean said smiling, slightly amused. “Sorry Dean, I wanted to do something nice for you, but I’m not really used to cooking,” Sam replied sounding slightly defeated. “It’s fine Sammy, it was a nice thought.” Dean responded.
“What about my jacket? Where is it?” Dean asked, more and more panic seeping through his words no matter how hard he tried to keep it down.
He walked for what felt like hours, but in reality, was only about an hour, before he saw a glowing sign and made his way his over, not really thinking about where he was going.
Sam’s eyes widened but he didn’t say anything, just went and sat next to his older brother, his protector, and he decided then that he would protect Dean from then on. No matter what.
Dean just gave a small breath of laughter before swinging his legs over the edge of the bed, which was slightly harder because of the added weight of the cast.
Tony just smiled sadly, “Okay, we’ll leave you to it and come get any one of us if you need anything.”
Sam was deceptively strong for his slim stature, so he lifted Dean and put his arm over his shoulder. Sam dragged Dean to the car and lay him down in the backseat. He hopped in the driver’s seat and started the car, speeding out of the driveway and towards the hospital.
“Yes. I didn’t locate him at this present moment, but I have two more things to share with you,” the AI continued.
He put the gun in his waistband and started to make his way back to the tower, feeling the best he had in a few days.
Tony went to pat Dean on the shoulder, but Dean flinched away, leaving Tony’s hand awkwardly raised in front of him.
‘Jesus fuck, what is happening today? Why can’t I breathe properly?’ Dean thought as he struggled to take in a breath. His breathing had been ragged and shallow all day and he starting to get slightly worried, not that he’d ever admit that. ‘Real men don’t worry. They don’t get scared.’ His father’s voice rang through his head and he shook his head trying to clear it.
The last few weeks passed as usual. Everything was the same for Dean. But he didn’t know that Sam was keeping in touch with the avengers every day, letting them know that Dean was ok.
“I told you, we ran your name. Didn’t know his name though, only that he existed,” Tony said calmly.
Dean took it and started to put the numbers in. “It’s each of the avengers’ numbers, they came to the school and tried to get me too accept help. I said no, but they made me take the numbers in case shit gets too bad.” He replied nonchalantly.
Dean walked to his closet and pulled out some black joggers, ‘easier to get over the cast’ he thought to himself. He also pulled out a plain black t-shirt and a white AC/DC jumper.
,” Steve read from the page with a regal tone, but Tony was too shocked at the mention of star fates to appreciate it, “and I was wondering what that meant?”
It’s lazy mornings, kisses as they pass each other in the corridors, “beloved” and “sweetheart”, “darlin’” and “honey”, date nights and little gifts. They’ve danced in their quarters to Sinatra at three in the morning, taken each other apart and put each other back together more times than Tony can count. They train together, go through paperwork and mission analysis together. Steve sketches in Tony’s workshop, and Tony works on his tablet when Steve’s back in his corner. There’s bad days, but they’re far outweighed by the good days and Tony realises.
“You like me.” It was not a question – suddenly it seemed strikingly obvious, the time Steve spent seeking him out, the hit Steve had taken – “and yet, you’re pulling away. Why?”
It was by far the easiest shift in his life, the anger at the harming of his hoard fuelling the smooth transition from mild-mannered billionaire, to fifteen feet of winged fury.
Clint steps forward, but it’s an aborted motion like he doesn’t know how he’ll be received, and in that moment, Tony can recognise Clint’s anger on the Raft and forgive it. “Get over here, Legolas.” Tony tells him with a roll of his eyes, but Clint’s hug is tight and solid, hands clutching at the back of Tony’s suit jacket.
, and Tony’s choking back a sob. He stares at it for a moment, wondering what the shock it’s brought him would feel like in a different circumstance – less like acid, he knows. Warm. He’d probably cry, Steve down on one knee with those hopeful blue eyes of his that Tony loves. The answer would be shaking, and the ring would be slipped on with gentle fingers-
will be ready when Loki comes back,” Steve said softly, “if you join us in the meetings. And come train. We need to come together as a team if we have any hope of winning the next round.”
“J, we know why they’re pissed at me, why are they after Thor so badly?” Tony asked, getting back up and fighting harder than ever. Tired of stunning everyone, he just started grabbing minions and throwing them into each other so they would stay down.
“You don’t remember. Why am I not surprised.” Scowling, she continued her approach until she was right in front of him.
“What?” Snapping up the faceplate, Tony whirled, finding Steve leaning heavily on Thor. His uniform was scorched and black in several places, and the flesh underneath looked red and burnt. Almost charred. Tony’s heart leapt to this throat at the sight of it. “What the hell happened? Steve, you alright?”
quiver with fear at her anger. Instead he kept his gaze straight ahead, slipping his sunglasses on and fighting back fidgeting until the driver appeared and held the door open for them to get in. Nat yanked her arm away, got in, and waited for Tony to follow and for the driver to close the door behind him, before she hissed, “What did you do?
“They’re gone,” Steve said hollowly, staring at the floor. “The whole base we’d discovered is just…gone. We can’t figure out where they went. The building was a burned and empty husk when we got there.”
Nodding, Steve took a deep breath. “When Loki and I fought after he took the Tesseract…well. You know how that ended.”
“God fucking dammit!” Tony adjusted, getting above Steve, trying to block him from exploding plane debris. Certain that that the suit covered Steve as much as possible, Tony wrapped his left arm around him, holding probably a bit too tightly. “Where the fuck is your parachute, you maniac!”
“Hey, hey, hey.” Sitting his scotch down, Tony hurried over and plopped on the couch as Steve’s voice broke and he buried his face in his hands. At a loss at what to do, Tony patted his shoulder pathetically, and said, “You still saved thousands that day, Steve. Your sacrifice saved so many people, even if some Hydra assholes managed to survive. And if they did, we’ll ferret them out. We’ll take them down for real.”
Which Tony completely ignored, but at least he headed to the workshop feeling like the world was a bit brighter.
“Thanks, Tony. I will,” Steve said, and though the promise wasn’t a solemn vow, Tony felt the weight of them surge through him.
Natasha, however, did no such thing. With a small nip, Nat bit his lip, startling him and making him laugh, before her lips crashed down again. Okay, point for Romanoff, she was one hell of a kisser. And it had been a while since anyone had touched him in such a way, and he found himself sinking into it a little more than he probably should have, with a little sigh. Wrong as it was, he couldn’t help but wish the hands in his hair and the soft lips devouring him belonged to someone else….
He turned to leave, and Tony’s brain kicked back in. “Steve, wait. I was wrong too. The bottle thing. Everything special about you was already there. The serum only enhanced that.”
“Hey yourself, Cap. Where’ve you been, you and Barton all right? You’ve had Bruce and Thor terribly concerned, you should be ashamed,” Tony said, trying not to let the panic he’d felt since last night show.
Steve nodded. “I was at Shield, gathering a few things from my room, hoping to speak with Fury. I wanted to know how they got the scepter from Loki, and he had told me he wanted to speak to me about joining Shield. As I was walking down the hall, an agent approached, thanked me for saving the city, offering to shake my hand. While we did, he leaned forward to put his mouth by my ear.” Shuddering, Steve’s hands clenched. “He whispered
A little bit of the Christmas spirit rushed through him as he walked through the doors. He loved it here, in this space where he had felt so at home before he realized what a true home was. The workshop in New York was nearly perfect, with its advances and the Avengers (particularly Steve) always popping in and out, and Tony loved it to pieces. But there was something about his garage here, in Malibu, that never failed to soothe the tension in Tony’s shoulders. Even on days like today when there was hardly any tension. He’d never had a spot where he could be so completely himself before buying this mansion, before making this safe haven in his garage. Only Rhodey and Pepper ever ventured down there — he made it so that Obie never really came in.
Laughing, Steve let Tony lead him into the elevator, and Tony set a small prayer of thanks to whatever deity listening for the brilliant grin that had replaced the agony in Steve’s eyes.
“Well, you better. Because you can’t be our leader if you can’t. And God knows no one else on this team can lead. Barton’s head would be bigger than Australia, and Thor would demand we bring him Pop Tarts all the time. Bruce and I would hide in our labs, and Nat would take over the world.”
“Then we’ll go get them,” she said firmly. “In the meantime, there’s been another Mandarin message.”
Time to get some backup. Keeping behind some bushes, Tony broke into the goon’s phone and contacted his personal server.
“Oh hey, Cap,” he said nonchalantly, knowing better than to start off asking what was wrong. Yawning exaggeratedly and dragging his feet a little, as if he were more exhausted then he felt, Tony headed for the kitchenette in the corner. “I ran out of coffee downstairs and thought I’d venture up here to steal a cup. Want some?”
, you know they don’t last with him around. Why are you—ohhhh.” She tilted her head, pursing her lips at him, eyes suddenly more sympathetic. “Steve still hasn’t checked in yet, has he?”
Growling, Tony picked his gloves back up, intent to go back on working on the suits. He needed to be more prepared. Way more prepared. “Is someone going to do something about that guy?”
The jury was still out on Fury himself. Tony had a few ideas, each one as plausible as the next, but kept them to himself for the time being.
“So then we’ll give them a new purpose, and a chance to kick the rats out. We’ll give them a home, and avenge everything you worked for. We’re the goddamned Avengers, aren’t we?” Leaping up, Tony opened a holo file, mind already ten steps ahead. “J, get some searches running. I wanna know who the hell was dumb enough to
“There was a file. We were given a file on all of you, weeks ago,” Clint said, not looking at anyone. “Barnes must have been mentioned in Steve’s, I must have told Loki about him when he questioned me on all of you. I’m sorry, Cap.”
“Clint and Natasha…” Steve began. He sighed. “I don’t think they’re Hydra. I feel it in my gut. But this is going to be awful for them.”
“No, no,” Tony hurried to assure him. “You picked things up faster than anyone would have ever thought, Cap, it’s not that. I guess…you’re our leader, and a great one at that, and you’re always worrying about us, and I just…who worries about
“Well if it isn’t the long lost hero,” Tony said, grinning at his phone like an idiot, because though he looked exhausted and slightly banged up, Steve seemed perfectly fine and okay.
“That went well,” Tony remarked after the silence had stretched out between the three left. “What do we do now?”
“Sorry you had to come all the way back because I got my ass handed to me,” Tony said quietly, trying not to let the shame trickle into his voice.
Landing on the hospital’s roof, Tony stepped out of the suit (thank God he’d gotten that upgrade working correctly, now if only he could take it one step further…) and hurried to the door. If the hospital staff was surprised to see him,  they didn’t say anything. Thanks to previous info Pepper had given JARVIS, he quickly found his way to Happy’s room, where Hogan was still lying unconscious.
“JARVIS, put everything we’ve got into the thrusters!” he shouted, praying. The plane was still in the air — not falling, but it had been several minutes, and Steve could have been hurt, or could have gotten sucked out or….
For a moment, Tony almost refused to end the call. He didn’t want to let go, didn’t want for Cap to disconnect yet. He wanted to hear more of Steve’s voice, and make Steve smile, and watch the way Steve would laugh at the outrageous things he said, and just…be with Steve.
,” she said, so forcefully that Tony took a step back. Then she took a deep breath, and said more calmly, “It’s not happening, Tony.”
, coming, actually I know that bastard was in on the Vanko mess with Hammer, I just haven’t been able to prove it yet…Nat? You alright?” he asked, because the spy’s eyes had widened slightly (which meant on a regular non-super spy person they would have been as round as dinner plates) and she looked from Tony to Stern with flared nostrils.
“They’re never going to get there and back in an hour,” Bruce said, and Tony resisted the urge to bang his head against the wall. Now that his mind was on food, he was hungry. “Listen, I’ve got some things in my lab brewing, so I’m gonna go work on that until they get back.”
“He’s thirteen,” she said, and for a moment he swore the arc reactor glitched again, before she did another eye roll. “And no, I need your help. I need you to come with me, now.”
Setting down his gloves and torch, and sighing, Tony said, “Christmas is over two months away, and you’re not getting near my robots, Darcy. Leave DUM-E alone. He’s a menace, but he’s my menace. And what the hell are you still doing in my workshop? Who let you in here?”
Footsteps sounded in the hallway behind him. Instantly pissed, Tony put his hands up, putting the repulsors on full blast, not wanting to take any chances with Steve already so hurt. Not on his watch.
“Clint loved Firefly,” she explained when she saw his befuddled expression. “Moped for months when they cancelled it.”
“And I could really use your help,” Steve interrupted, and Tony abruptly stopped speaking, because, what?
But as he desperately wanted Steve to kiss him, that would have been a liiiiiiiiiiie. So he kept that smartass comment to himself this time.
his past always came back to bite him in the ass. “I would have helped you before you started experimenting on people. Before you got involved with Killian and the Mandarin. You should have come to me a long time ago, Maya. I can’t help you now.”
, he had everybody on his side down. As fast as he could, he went to Thor, and after another twenty minutes, between his repulsers and another round of Thor’s lightning, The Wrecking  Crew and their minions were down for good.
“You don’t have long before he heads this way,” she said, continued, ignoring his cursing. “If you want to save Pepper, you should choose quickly.”
Cradling him close, Tony carried Steve back to the jet, as carefully as he would with precious glass or an infant. He wouldn’t risk hurting Steve.
“It is with great regret that I must leave it at that,” Thor said seriously, plopping Tony back on his feet. “The lady Jane would be most displeased if I were to take things further, but know that you are loved and cared for this Yuletide, Stark.”
“He thought it would be good for Steve to work with Shield, have a purpose outside the Avengers, yes. The Strike team was one area of consideration. But Steve was rightfully focused on finding Loki, and wasn’t interested.”
“What I didn’t mention before…is that I was winning,” Steve said, the words rushing out. “I was winning our fight, had the upper hand. Had my arms around him in a chokehold, could tell he was on the verge of passing out.”
legit, we don’t have an Avenger social media page.” Did they? Shit, Pepper was going to kill him. He was supposed to run all Avengers promo by SI’s PR team, just because it affected their stocks so much. Tony thought he’d solved the problem by just staying out of it. It wasn’t like Cap or Bruce or the superspies were that into social media, and Thor thought just shouting at the phone was fun enough.
“I know that. But you are my friend.” Steve’s voice was confident, left no room for doubt. He really meant it, which…Tony was not sure how he felt about. Were they friends? He supposed they were.
“We need to stop the bleeding,” Tony admitted, hurrying over. “Goddammit, why didn’t you say something earlier, I could have…could have done something then!” He looked at the cabin again. “Maybe there’s something in the…”
Which was a problem for another time, he thought, once he was all dressed up and stepping into the common area to grab Natasha. She stood in the kitchen with the rest of the team, decked in a gorgeous black dress and a diamond bigger than his fist flashing at her neck. He idly wondered how much that had cost him when he caught sight of Steve, looking like he’d just stepped out of the shower, hair damp and framing his strong face. Tony’s mouth immediately went dry. Steve’s face was a little pink, likely flushed from the hot showers he loved to linger in, making those fierce blue eyes stand out. And he was barefoot, looking relaxed and happy, and
Tony started out, expecting Steve to follow him to the guest room, but after a few steps he paused, realizing no one was behind him. Throwing a glance over his shoulder he saw Steve staring out the massive windows, looking out over the ocean like the weight of the world was on his shoulders.
Thank God the partition was up. Tony sighed, unbuttoning his top collar button and loosening his tie a little. “What I had to, Nat.”
“No, no, it’s okay. It’s not that.” The pained expression appeared back on his face, and Tony felt the urge to reach out and run a hand down Cap’s back. “I lost Bucky in the snow. When he fell from the train…there was cold. And snow.”
hero  — someone who wouldn’t back down from a hard fight, who would do his best to keep those he loved protected, to do what was right, no matter what. That was what radiated from him now. That ferocious passion, and resolution to do what was right.
She was so frazzled that her nails dug into Tony’s arm as she latched onto it, and Tony winced slightly, trying to extract her as he said, “Pep, hey, relax, of course I’ll help. Nat, I’ll be right back, okay? Go get me some cheesecake before Rhodey-bear eats it all.”
“Ah.” Shit, the back of his neck was burning again. Why the hell did Spangles always bring that out in him? “Yeah. I’ll be better about that. Had to work through some shit.”
“You told me yesterday you wanted to talk about something. But you had no trouble telling the whole team about Bucky, so I’m guessing it isn’t that. What aren’t you telling them that you thought you could trust me with?” Tony asked, putting the bread down to stare at Steve. For some reason, his hand was slightly sweaty. Like he was nervous about what Steve was going to say, or something.
to do with everything. Steve had been gone the last two weeks on a mission looking into where Loki’s scepter was. They’d determined that Fury had locked it in a vault in the Triskelion after Loki defeated Steve, but in a far too casual conversation with Maria Hill after their latest mission, she’d hinted to Steve that it wasn’t there anymore.
“But I broke Harlem,” Bruce continued, his eyes too sad and far too old. “And it wasn’t pretty. And I have to live with that. Every day. So I won’t say I understand. But I will say, when my memories sneak up on me like that, tea helps. And friendship. Talking. So. Would you like me to make you some tea?”
Now that they were all back in New York, the Avengers spread out in the communal area, eating, drinking, and chatting. Pepper chatted with Jane and Darcy, though Tony noticed she stayed close to Rhodey, as if she wasn’t quite sure she could trust anyone but him yet. Thor was telling Rhodey tales of his childhood, which had Tony’s honeybee throwing his head back and laughing a lot. That was good, Tony thought, watching Rhodey cackle. He wasn’t sure how Rhodey and Pep would fit in with the team, but seeing them intertwine with everyone like this was nice, even if Pepper was a little skittish. No one would have blamed her if she stayed far, far away, but she was there, making the effort, and that meant more to him than he ever would have thought. Made his little reactor heart warm with pride.
“Yup, me too,” Clint said next to him. Tony couldn’t see him, but he could picture the smirk on the archer’s face easily enough.
Maya appeared in his line of sight, and Tony tried to tell her to run, to get her to find help, but the pain was so intense he couldn’t form the right words. Which meant he barely felt it when the needle slid in. Before he could react, (shove her away, call for JARVIS, do something fucking
That surprised him enough that his symptoms dulled, and he stared at Bruce while the doctor crouched in front of him. “Me?”
“Oh come on,” Tony scoffed, turning to get ready to go find him and Thor and help. “It’s a small group of wanna-be bad guys, Cap, I think it will be——”
“Jesus. Seriously?” Running it through his mind, Tony tried to picture it. “Do you think they caught wind of us?”
Full disclosure, I have zero medical knowledge. So bear with me here, and have fun in the name of hurt/comfort!
“Right,” he managed after enough time had passed to get sufficiently awkward again. “Well. In that case, I’m glad you're here, then. I’ve got something to talk to you about. Seeing as we’re friends and all.”
He didn’t comment on how that was his fault, how they’d only left because Steve was worried about him, because he didn’t think that’d go over very well after their last talk.
idea what you’ve just unleashed?” She was actually shaking with her rage now, and Tony gulped, trying to keep up the nonchalant act he had going on.
“Yeah, me too. It wasn’t his fault,” Clint said pointedly, and Tony felt a small kick to his chair. Ignoring it, Tony continued to fake sleep, and was grateful for the act. It was his fault. If there was anything about this whole fucked up situation he was certain of, it was that. He’d taken Steve on the vacation, he’d let Steve on his compromised plane, he’d
“Of course not, Ms. Hoag, but I’ve just been informed that I’m needed elsewhere. Avengers business, you know,” Tony lied, getting to his feet.
“To get ready. In case Hydra attacks. Phil’s team would have total loyalty to him, there’s no way they wouldn’t, even early on,” Clint said. “It’s
Again, not that surprising. The cell phone companies were probably going kablooey with everyone calling to check on their loved ones or to talk about how the fact that aliens were a thing now. Or to upload videos of Avengers kicking said alien ass. That was probably why. Had to be.
“Come on, come on,” Tony urged as the suit snapped into place. The HUD lit up instantly, and Tony looked all around, trying to take in everything he could at once. “J, what do we got?”
from Natalie/Natasha? Sure, pain had overridden his senses, but that had happened before, and he’d survived. “Ffuuk.”
In answer, Tony moved forward, gently reaching out to gather Steve in his arms. Bruce had patched him up while Tony had gotten the suit, and now a proper bandage covered Steve’s side, keeping his injury hidden away for the time being, but Tony knew what was underneath. Burnt, torn, mangled flesh, caused by Tony’s carelessness.
Twisting so he was face to face with the armor, Steve wrapped his arm’s around Tony’s neck. “Don’t need a parachute!” he yelled as Tony evaded more debris.
Catching his scowl, Natasha continued, “You conked out as soon as we sat down. JARVIS confirmed you haven’t getting much sleep lately, so I didn’t wake you.”
But hey, there was a lake, and houses all over nearby, and while it was cold and not perfect, it was better than letting them go splat on the ground. Pulling up a little more, he got them over the water, scanning the depths and temp to make sure it wouldn’t shock them too much, and dropped them in.
Tony tended to agree — it was a scenario that still gave him nightmares occasionally. Obie’s domineering frame, towering over him, stealing the reactor while Tony struggled to move, to breathe. Not exactly a great night. But he didn’t like the way Steve’s eyes were pinched, so he tapped his fingers against the reactor and forced his voice to stay light. “It’s alright, Cap. I’m clearly still alive and kicking. Luckily, Pepper is a smartass, and DUM-E is the best boy when he’s not dousing me with a fire extinguisher, and I managed to stay alive until Rhodey got to me. Then I kicked Obie’s ass.”
“The bad guys, sure. It’ll be fine, Natasha, now we can finally get them to make a stupid move and take them out.”
. And as Steve’s soft mouth devoured his, as he gently licked and nipped at Tony, a small whimper popped out of him —
Steve’s eyebrows shot to his hairline. “Collapsed? Stark? You okay?” Then he blinked again. “Lives in the ceiling?”
Hot, burning tears blurred his vision for just a moment. Then he blinked them away, fixed his gaze onto Steve, and said hoarsely, “I’m sorry.”
“Uhhhhhh,” Tony said, his own eyes going wide as saucers as Steve nudged Clint out of the way, then stood directly under the mistletoe and lifted his chin. “Whatcha doin’ there, Cap?”
They stumbled through, and Tony managed to get Steve to the bed on the side of the room and gently eased him down onto it. It was dusty, and old and without sheets, but in decent shape, so that when Tony stood back up to hurry and close the door he didn’t worry about Steve falling right through. The lights didn’t turn on, so he swore, grabbed a lantern, and quickly got it lit.
At a loss, Tony nodded. Smiling, making sure to keep his hand in Tony’s, Bruce led him out of the workshop and to he kitchen. There, he gently guided Tony to a stool, and then released his hand to go make the tea. Watching him as he did so, Tony thought of the small slice of himself Bruce had just offered. Banner didn’t talk about what happened before Nat pulled him into the Avengers. Ever. Yet he’d brought it up tonight. Because he was a great guy, because they were teammates, because…because they were friends.
Steve shrugged. “Well, it looked like the team was getting in on the Christmas spirit. Can’t be the only stick in the mud. You guys would never let me live it down.”
“Steve,” he said as the suit opened up around him, and Tony was able to sit up.  It came out muffled so he cracked his jaw and tried again. “Steve.”
,) the room instantly blurred, his eyelids getting heavy in seconds. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch, he’d let his guard down. And didn’t he know better, hadn’t he learned
Cheering excitedly, Tony grabbed the bag and dug in. “Burritos, excellent. You really know a way to a guy’s heart, Cap.”
full of Chitauri weapons they had collected had gone missing. How the fuck that happened was beyond Tony, but he was absolutely livid. Someone’s head was gonna roll.
“We have to tell the team,” Tony said immediately. Maybe it was naive, but they’d saved the world together, came together to fight off an alien invasion. He had to believe someone that could do that wouldn’t be part of Hydra. He had to. “And then keep ourselves separate from Shield. Have you give that Hydra guy a reason the two of you can’t be around each other. You’re infiltrating the Avengers, or something. Gotta be top secret. That’s step one.”
, Tony thought, cursing his mouth and wishing he could take it back. Fucking hell, how pathetic was he? Steve didn’t need him, he’d proven that on the helicarrier, and in the workshop earlier, but…but Tony just couldn’t let the guy think he was totally alone.
“Tony.” This time, his name sounded warbly as Pepper’s chin wobbled, eyes filling as she stared at him. “Oh my god.
Too tired to be unnerved, Tony did as JARVIS suggested, and made his way to the workshop. As he got out of the elevator and made his approach, the sound of music already blasting from within made him pause.
Her attack was quick and brutal. Less than a minute later both men were unconscious on the floor, and Nat was tilting her head, lifting an eyebrow at him. “Fought your way out of a cave with a box of scraps, but you can’t get free from zip ties?”
Steve shifted, folding his arms and planting his feet. “I’ll make you some pancakes and bacon, if you stay away from the coffee and go to sleep right after.”
Awkward silence stretched between them, but damned if Tony was going to be the one to back down. He’d dealt with awkward silences all his life — from the ones his father had caused by being too distracted and ignoring him, to the ones Obie would create in board meetings, in a power move to make the board toe the line. So he kept his arms crossed and his head tilted until Steve finally caved.
“I think we need to remain, your JARVIS indicated that you would need some help,” Thor said firmly, grasping onto Tony’s shoulder to keep him from bolting away. Despite his vow to not show any other weakness in front of the god or Cap, Tony winced. Fuck. Apparently there was a rather bad bruise there.
A strangled noise ripped from Tony at the sight of the wound, at the sight of Steve trusting him, at the knowledge that Tony was going to hurt him.
“Why, so he can feel awkward and uncomfortable around me? The guy’s had enough shit to deal with since waking up, Nat, I’m not adding to that by letting him know I’ve got an inconvenient crush.”
Rolling his eyes, Tony picked up a screwdriver and fidgeted with it, trying to get his thoughts sorted before saying anything further. While he did, Steve took a tentative step forward and asked, “So what now?”
The one bright side was that his wrist, while aching like a sonovabitch, had at least been treated. So there was that. He wouldn’t die of infection or some shit. But he had still been kidnapped. And that burned his ass. So he turned to the goons, not even bothering to hide his pissiness, and cleared his throat.
“Right. Of course not.” His brain would never let him sleep if he didn’t do all he could in that search as well. “We’ll do both. We’re the Avengers, yeah? So what if we got more than one thing to avenge? We’ve got this. Absolutely.”
Before Steve’s run-in with Sitwell, Tony remembered. Steve had said something about Fury wanting to talk to him.
Laughing, Steve leaned into Tony’s touch a little, and it was all Tony could do not to wrap his arms around the captain, and engulf him completely. DUM-E chirped once more, approvingly this time, and went off to go make what Tony assumed as an inedible smoothie he would have to pretend to love.
. Completely at home. Pulse picking up wildly, Tony snapped his eyes back to Nat, hoping he didn’t look too much like a besotted idiot.
“I wanna know what’s next,” Tony repeated. It was a chance to stall, but it also wasn’t a total lie. So he went with it. “Loki, the Chitauri, alien gods? What’s next, Fury? How are we going to be ready for it?”
, he thought, while he scuttled away, trying to tap the bracelets on his arms, praying he could get the suit to spring to action.
of suppressed feelings, thank you very much) and focus on making Steve smile that bright the entire time they were there. The next night, Tony convinced him to take a break from cooking, and they went out on the town, eating at Tony’s favorite Italian restaurant and going Christmas shopping for the team. Tony, naturally, hadn’t gotten a thing yet. Steve said he was almost finished with his gifts, but that he wanted to keep an eye out for something for Darcy. They wandered around, grabbing few things, and then headed back to the mansion to watch more of the movies on Steve’s list.
“You know what? You should take more of an interest in this. This woman is the best thing to happen to your company, and he’s got her attention, and a guy that’s shifty.”
The next day, Tony was working in his workshop (carefully, because Natasha had indeed ratted him out to his Science Bro, and Banner was actually quite stern about the concussion so he wasn’t using screens but paper, it was horrible) when Steve walked in. Putting away a folder containing the multitude of projects he had going on, Tony crossed his arms and watched Steve enter, face blank.
Natasha’s gaze hardened. “The truth is a matter of circumstances. It’s not all things, to all people, all the time. And neither am I.”
Thor was the most difficult to spar with. He’d try to go easy on Tony but would inevitably forget his strength and Steve would have to intervene. After it happened twice, Tony bowed out and was in the middle of watching a truly spectacular sparring battle between Steve and Thor (the muscles. Dear God. What had he done to witness such beauty?) when JARVIS spoke.
” Steve said again with a small huff of impatience as Tony shrugged and averted his eyes. “I’m trying to give you a compliment.”
trust Fury, that’s the whole problem. If he’s pulling this on us, and not looping her in, it’s hurting her because she doesn’t know why. And Phil…”
Pepper’s words sounded over and over in his head while he soared over the Mid-West. Because he had followed the shifty guy, and Tony wasn’t there to help. A bombing, Pepper had told him, tears in her eyes. Like the ones the Mandarin had claimed responsibility for. The guy Tony was supposed to let the military handle, the one they agreed didn’t need super-hero interference.
“You know me well, buddy. I’m gonna stake the place out, get a feel for what they’ve got hatched. I’ve got a feeling it’s something big. Tell Natalie to move her ass.”
But it was his evenings that were the best. The first night, Tony had arrived home to discover Steve beaming at him from the kitchen counter, thrilled he’d managed to replicate Bruce’s enchilada recipe. He hadn’t, it had tasted terribly, but Tony ate it anyway, and then they went for an evening swim and Tony was treated to the sight of Steve wet and gleaming in a swimsuit.
“Well, if we must, we must. Pucker up, there, Cap,” Tony joked, thinking he did a pretty good job of keeping the wistfulness out of his voice. But maybe he didn’t do so great job because Steve’s easy demeanor faded, and he was back to looking determined again.
And thank god. Relief making the stone that had sat in his gut finally start to break down, he turned his gaze back to Pepper. “I gotta go, Pep. We’ll talk tomorrow, yeah?”
Choking out a laugh, Steve lifted his head, blazing blue eyes shining. For a moment Tony was startled by the brilliance of them, and was only able to stare as Steve said, “I could have stopped him, Tony. I almost had him. But he said Bucky’s name, and now we’ll never know. And I was embarrassed, so I didn’t tell you all of it until now. I should know better.” Shaking his head, he shifted, looking out the window again and away from Tony. Tony felt the world dim a little as Steve said in a small voice, “The one thing I can’t figure out, is how did he know? How did he know Bucky’s name, how did he know he would be one of the only things that I…” his voice caught, but he huffed out a breath, and continued, “that I would let my guard down on?”
When he yanked his arm free, the glowing ripple occurred again, and the man’s hand lit up with flames. Quirking an eyebrow at Tony, he spread his palm wide, and the flames went out.
Clint strolled in, Natasha right behind him. Eyebrows practically shooting to his hairline, the archer took one look at the melee and destruction and whistled. “Damn. You guys can’t fight for shit without us.”
He looked so unbearably sad while he said it that for a moment Tony considered sinking to the floor next to him and giving the guy a hug. Just as he was about to, however, Steve cleared his throat.
“Fair enough.” Rubbing his eyes, he glanced over at the wall and saw it was two am anyway. “Okay, you win. I’ll get some sleep, and then we can chat in the morning. Square deal?”
Purple jets of light erupted everywhere. It was a constant, endless torrent, from a group on the other side of the garage, and all of them focused on Steve — who was taking out the ones he could while under the constant attack, the shield out in front of him, offering protection. Not far away, Thor battled the crowbar guy, a dude with oversized, pile-driving fists, and the one Maria had warned about with the demotion ball on a chain.
As if she knew exactly what he was thinking, Natasha narrowed her eyes. “And don’t you dare hide away, Steve deserves better than that. And so do you.”
“Oh, well.” Tony waved him off with his free hand. “Lotta people would disagree with you there, Cap, not that I’d blame them, I’m really not…”
“Natasha! Nat wait,” Clint yelled as she turned on her heel and strode from the room. Cursing, he threw one last look their way and took off after her.
,” Natasha snapped, standing. “I need to think. I need to look into this on my own.” She stared at them all, face still blank. “Thank you for telling us, Steve. But I need to process this on my own.”
“Thanks,” Steve said, smiling again. Then he turned back to Tony as Tony sat down in the new chair, and studied him with a thoughtful expression. “
Footsteps shuffled, and then there was another kick to Tony’s chair. “Alright, we’re in the clear. You can sit up now.”
“Hold on, Cap!” No lake around this time, Tony thought sadly, and wrapped his arms back around Steve. Only a shit ton of trees. Flipping them again so that his back would be what would hit, Tony tried not to brace too much for impact. That always made it worse.
“Steve.” Heart shattering, Tony did reach out this time, placing his hand on Steve’s shoulder. “You didn’t. Sometimes bad things happen, Cap.”
Fury held his gaze for several moments. “Yeah, Stark. I got your back. You’ll have my aid, or sword, or whatever the quote is.” He shifted, looked back at the cat. “Goose’s too, if she likes you.”
“Goose sort of does what Goose wants,” Fury replied. “And to answer your question, I kind of had the impression that the Avengers were going to take care of whatever threat comes next. What with the whole, team-bonding, living in the Tower thing, and all.”
“I read your file, read Coulson’s and Nat’s reports. What you let Fury keep in them, anyway,” Steve said with a wry smile. “I read between the lines. Drew enough information to know that you weren’t the only Stark he gaslit, Tony.”
“Knew you’d catch me,” Steve murmured. That made Tony’s heart flip, (he’d asked Steve to trust him, but he hadn’t expected Steve to trust him so much, how the hell was he supposed to handle that?) when Steve said, “And I like flying with you. S’fun.”
Natasha shook her head. “My focus was on you, not so much the circus occurring around you. But you’re right, he was after your suits. I wonder…” she trailed off, then looked at Pepper and Rhodey expectantly.
Then he tapped his fingers on the table, wondering what the hell he was going to do until JARVIS let him back into his files.
“What the fuck did happen?” Tony asked, moving his free hand to rub at his mouth. “How did they trick security, trick
“Bulldozer,” the man grunted, grinning. He fired the gun he held, making purple jets of light slam into the armor. Cursing, Tony took a step back, and reminded himself that Cap said to be careful. Gritting his teeth, Tony set his repulsors to stun and went to town.
Bile rose to the back of his throat as his mind pondered the things it took to scare the Black Widow. “Natasha. It’s going to be—”
“I will, Tony. I promise,” Steve said, eyes blazing. Tony stared back into them, drawn in completely. Had Steve’s eyes always been so endlessly blue? How had he never noticed that before? And damn, Steve had insanely long lashes. He could be on the cover of a magazine. Actually, he’d easily outshine any other model they put on there, he was
Okay, that was a low blow. “Zip ties are a pain in the ass. And to be fair, I was working on it. You just showed up to do your thigh move of death before I could get anywhere.”
“Yeah, I play all the essentials. AC/DC, Triumph, Black Sabbath, Metallic….what is your face doing? Are you laughing?”
Frowning, Steve looked back at Coulson’s photo. “So, what? He ushers Phil off to a new team? To do what?”
Alright, it was probably totally ridiculous to suggest such a thing at all, because Tony was head over heels for Steve and Steve totally did not feel the same, but the more he looked at Steve, the more the circles under his eyes and the tightness around his mouth stood out. He’d been going non-stop since waking up from the ice. If anyone deserved to relax, it was Steve.
Feeling an odd sense of deja vu, Tony tilted his head, and asked, “What’s the distance from New York to here?”
“Tony!” The last few weeks Steve had been slowly losing his Oscar the Grouch look, and now looked more and more like a Labrador retriever. Hydra and all he had lost still weighed heavily on him, but with Thor and Darcy around, it was hard not to look on the bright side. As he walked down the hallway, eyes lighting up, Tony couldn’t help but return the grin Steve sent him, smiling brightly.
A clang sounded, and a familiar shield boomeranged into five of them, giving him a temporary break while the rest scattered.
So Steve and JARVIS continued to try and find out more on Hydra. They’d narrowed down a few worldly events that could have been caused by the group, and were now looking hard at the current agents of Shield, trying to decide who could be trusted. Coulson had been clean. Maria Hill also appeared to be legit, which made Tony feel somewhat better. He’d liked her no-nonsense attitude and ability to cut through bullshit.
But Mary tumbled helplessly about, and Tony flew to her. “Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys?” Tony asked, getting as close as he could.
Surprised, Tony blinked before picking the bread back up and continuing with the sandwich. “The group you and Peggy Carter destroyed?” Steve winced at her name, his mouth turning down and eyes getting sad. Oh, Tony thought, recognizing heartbreak when it stared him in the face. Right. Maybe it was wise not to mention Carter’s name. Tony wasn’t the only one suffering from loneliness and a broken heart, these days.
. And if Hydra makes a play, Fury’d know he’d have one team on his side, without a doubt. Coulson would have his back.”
Okay, he’d grovel for that later. “So that bastard wasn’t just after my suits for the government he was after them for
gone, Tony tilted his head, and stretched again, his back cracking after leaning over the workshop table for so long. “Uh huh. Who needs me on the communal floor? If it’s Barton, tell him I’m sleeping. I’m still annoyed he made us watch
Bulldozer didn’t bother responding, just bent down and charged Tony. With his head down like he was bull or something, what in the actual fuck? Twisting out of the way, Tony lifted his arm and fired. But Bulldozer had obviously learned a few things from their first go-round, and doubled back quickly, charing again to ram his armored helmet into Tony’s stomach. Oh. So that was what had hit him earlier. The dude’s helmet. Lovely.
“Off.” Thor said firmly, and that was that. Telling himself that it was fine, that Thor and Steve were not Obie and he had nothing to worry about, he pulled his shirt over his head. Cool air hit his skin and made him shiver a little, goosebumps erupting down his arm, which spurned him into action. He wanted to be warm, and have a full stomach, and be horizontal for a while, dammit. Reaching over for the cords that would help scan the reactor, Tony got to work, not looking at his teammates until Steve cleared his throat.
“Not really,” he said honestly. At least he’d finally gotten something to eat and a chance to shower. That had to count for something.
Natasha shook her head. Panic burst through him, blooming at the heart of the reactor and spreading out until his fingers and toes felt numb. Steve and Clint had checked in every night since they’d been gone. But last night there’d been nothing, and not knowing if he needed to give them more time or get int the suit and hunt them down was driving Tony mad.
“Brucie-bear!” he shouted. “Come in, sit, we’re about to watch a movie.” Shoving at Barton’s feet, Tony budged over more to make enough room for Bruce. Refusing to get up, Clint merely held his feet high until Bruce sat down, then plopped his legs back across them. “Jesus, Barton, can you sit like a regular person? We haven’t reached the cuddling portion of team bonding yet.”
“What? Nat taking over the world? Me too, but don’t you dare tell her or she might actually try it, and then I’d be responsible.” Tony paused, then thought,
“My best friend,” Steve said quietly. “He died in the war. Right in front of me. And when Loki said his name, it was like I was that sixteen-year-old kid from Brooklyn again. I froze. I knew it was a lie, I knew he was trying to distract me. But I still froze. And Loki got away.” Looking away from them, Steve let out a small sigh. “I’m sorry. I froze and let him go.”
One early evening, Tony dragged himself away from the workshop on his own for once, and back to the penthouse. A breeze billowed in from the hole in the window, making the tarp flutter and flap. Tony eyed it while making himself more coffee, unable to look away. Why hadn’t that been fixed yet? He should have made that a priority. He’d been flung out that fucking window like a rag doll. When they found Loki, Tony was going to fire a repulsor straight up his ass.
Walking over to the spot Tony pointed at, Steve paused, placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Thank you, Tony.”
Steve’s frown reappeared. “AIM and Killian weren’t your fault. And if Pepper couldn’t handle you being Iron Man, that’s on her, Tony. Not you.”
“This is the most wonderful tradition, is it not?” He asked Tony. “And now we are also under the mistletoe together, and I shall show you my affections!” He reached out, grabbed Tony by the elbows and plucked him off the floor.
Then again, Happy had been a little busy lately, what with recovering from getting blown up and all….
So instead of mocking the poor guy, Tony nodded. “Great, let’s fix this small heart problem and get….” He trailed off when the elevator doors opened and frowned at who they revealed on the other side. “Cap. What are you doing here?”
. It’s mostly Thor and Clint, but the others have some golden lines too. Come on, Tony.” Leaning over, she poked him, making him frown and swat her hand away. “Gimme something I can use. One of those classic Stark quips. Chop chop.”
Then Jasper, then Mary, then Alex and Kit, despite Steve’s best attempts to grab Alex’s arm, to keep him in the plane. Steve, who clutched at the back of a chair, and was using his massive strength to keep himself from getting sucked out right along with them.
The disdain disappeared from Clint’s face, only to be replaced with wonder. “Well, holy shit. You’ve got no clue.”
“What? Of course I…oh. Sorry.” Lowering his arm, he disengaged the gauntlet, and pressed his face into Steve’s hair. “Please tell me you have Bruce.”
The Oscar the Grouch scowl returned. “Of course not! I wouldn’t…no. That’s not what happened. But I did let my guard down, just for a second. And he got the jump on me.”
Scooting back so he could get up, she waited until he was steady on his feet before gracefully sauntering down the hallway. “Was beginning to wonder if we’d ever see you again,” she said casually, wandering into the kitchen.
Steve’s face was flaming now. Tony was pretty sure his was bright red as well, but he didn’t look away, because he didn’t want Steve to think he wasn’t telling the truth.
Face warming again, Tony huffed out a breath. “I get thrown around a lot in the suit. It’s not a big deal, I’ve got plans to make that better. And the bruises will fade, so really, it’s fine.”
, he wanted to respond, but no one could hear you in space, and he couldn’t get the words out. In the back of his mind he wondered who that soft, female voice belonged to. It wasn’t Pepper, the call had failed, he hadn’t said goodbye.
“Aside from the fact that Rhodes, Pepper and Steve would go ballistic for even considering it, it’s not a good tactic, Tony. They’ve kept hidden for 70 years. They won’t make the kind of mistake you’re thinking.”
He didn’t really know Pierce, which made him automatically suspicious of him. He was suspicious of Fury too, but well. The bastard had tried to stop the nuke. Whether that was because he had been trying to do the right thing, or if he was trying to play them all was anybody’s guess.
Probably he should have stayed the hell away. Not gone anywhere near Shield, or its headquarters. Clint and Nat were doing their thing, he needed to let sleeping dogs lie, and all that.
“So, what, we go back to trusting no one, then? Not even these guys?” Clint asked, gesturing to Steve and Tony. “Never showing anyone our true selves, who we really are?”
“Tony. May I?” Steve asked again, quieter this time, the determination fading away to something softer.
“I honestly don’t have that much to tell yet,” Steve admitted, sitting on Tony’s workshop couch. He should have looked huge on the old, worn-out thing, but instead he looked right at home there, settling in easily. Huh. Ignoring the urge to go sit with him, Tony took a sip of scotch and tapped his fingers on the glass.
“I….plead the fifth,” Tony said. At the curious glean that popped into her eyes, he decided it was way past time to change the subject and said, “Hey, weren’t you just gone for a bit? What was up with that? Find anything useful?”
“I try,” Tony managed, wondering what the hell had just happened. Patting his shoulder, she strolled away as Thor bounded over.
“It is noted that Dean had fresh and healing bruises covering his face and arms.” FRIDAY continued. “It is said in the report that the social workers managed to talk themselves in and they met the brothers in the living room. It is said that Dean denied every accusation towards their father, but the younger boy told them everything, about how his father hits Dean and Dean protects his brother.” FRIDAY took another short break.
He walked back to the punching bag and started hitting. He immediately felt better as his hands connected with something. ‘God, I missed this,’ he thought.
Sam grabbed a bag from behind him and passed it to Dean, he reached out and took the bag, wincing at the pain in his stomach.
“We took him to the police station and explained what happened, they have him in a cell,” Steve explained.
With no words spoken between the two, Dean got up and headed back upstairs while his father slumped down onto the couch. When dean had reached his room, Sam was sat on his bed with the first aid box the same as he was every time Dad got rough.
“Aren’t you all a little old to be watching cartoons?” Natasha said with a hint of sarcasm. “Shut up Nat, you’re never too old for SpongeBob,” Clint retorted seriously. Steve snickered and went to sit next to Tony who was completely engrossed in the show.
They obviously responded with a yes, so that was how Dean found himself driving to the tower, with Sam in the front seat because he had insisted that he get to come too.
“If they got help from a social worker then how come Dean still had fresh bruises and a broken rib?” Steve asked.
“Um, okay thanks FRIDAY,” Dean replied somewhat awkwardly. He made his way down the hall and into the bathroom.
*Thanks Sam, will you keep us updated on how you and Dean are doing until we can figure out a way to help* Steve answered.
He slowly got out of their bed and made his way to the kitchen. Every one of the avengers, and Bucky, lives in the tower with Tony and Steve as they thought it would just be easier should an emergency arise. Steve was always the one to cook, he would prepare breakfast for everyone while the whole team slowly funnelled into the kitchen. Usually Natasha would enter first and try to help with the cooking, but Steve banned her from helping after she nearly burnt the kitchen down. Then Bruce would enter and start brewing the coffee. Thor, Clint and Bucky would show up sometime after with Tony always being the last awake and in the kitchen. Today was no different.
Dean was distracted when a sharp pain shot through his leg. John had stomped on it and it didn’t look great. There was a strange lump sticking out on his shin and he assumed it was his bone. The pain was tremendous, and Dean felt even more like he was going to pass out.
“It’s just behind you,” Natasha said. Dean turned around and the team now saw his exposed back and noticed it was even more scarred than his front. They all stared but kept quite as to not alert Dean they could see.
“Okay,” Steve stood, and he and Tony made their way to the door when they were stopped by an almost inaudible, “Thank you.”
“Stark, you and Thor go up into the sky and blast them,” Steve said with authority. “Widow and Hawkeye take the left and get people to safety, me and Buck will take the left and get as many as we can.” A chorus of ‘okays’ came through the comms and they were all off.
Sam looked at his brother, as if saying ‘you don’t have to be suspicious of everything Dean’. Then turned back to the team and smiled even bigger than before and said, “We’d love to. Thank you so much!”
He looked through the avengers’ names and settled on asking Natasha. ‘She looks like she can handle scars,’ he reasoned with himself.
The elevator responded with a, “Sure thing Mr. Winchester.” Starling both Sam and Dean before it started to move upwards.
Sam came back outside with two doctors and they helped get Dean onto a stretcher and wheeled him inside.
Dean didn’t know what to say and open and closed his mouth a few times. ‘Should I lie and give a fake name? Should I just run?’ Dean thought as he was formulating a plan of escape.
Dean took a deep breath and opened his door. He saw Sam was poking his head around from his door and gave him a look both brothers came to know as, ‘Don’t go down there no matter what, I’ll be fine.’
“We need to get him to surgery and patch up his lung,” Bruce stated already going to move around him to grab the tools.
Steve woke up next to his husband, Tony, and smiled faintly. He will never get over waking up with him, he considered one of the best things to ever happen to him.
“He’ll be charged quickly given that we all witnessed what happened and you can testify to the past years even if Dean doesn’t. Plus, people only need to look at his body before knowing what’s been happening. So, he’ll go away, we’ll make sure of it,” Natasha added., rage still bubbling slightly.
Dean looked down and realised he was shirtless only wearing a pair of grey joggers. He suddenly felt self-conscious that everyone could see his scars and looked around for something to cover himself.
Dean made his way other to his closet and again picked out a baggy t-shirt, but this time with dark blue jeans and a plain black baggy hoodie. He also picked out a pair of black converse.
Dean replied with, “No I’m sure it’s just cracked or something. Besides they’ll ask too many questions.”
Dean went straight for the signature line without reading the form, he had done this before. He started to write James, then turned to look at Sam.
Dean woke up the next morning and was slightly struggling to breathe. He got up and ignored it trying to convince himself it was just allergies or something. He got up and exited his room, to get into the shower.
Steve looked up when he heard the ding of the elevator and relaxed his tense shoulders when he saw Dean walk into the room.
Then suddenly strong arms wrapped around him and he could hear a deep voice trying to speak to him, but it sounded slurred and far away from him.
Another punch to the face and a kick to the stomach and Dean was gone. His vision started to fade, and he passed out.
He saw his Dad’s feet shuffling away and only just noticed the strong smell of alcohol radiating from his father. He guessed the reason for tonight’s beating was frustration on not being done with this case yet.
They arrived back at the house and Dean steered into the driveway. They both got out of the car slowly and made their way to the house even slower.
He placed the teen, stomach down on the hospital bed and waited only two minutes until Bruce showed up, shortly followed by Thor and Sam.
“His blood alcohol level is extremely high, and it looks like his drug of choice was ecstasy that was laced with a little cocaine. So, he’s going to have a fun morning.” He started solemnly but ended sarcastically.
*I was just making sure you knew who I was since I’ll probably be the one talking to you as Dean has said he won’t do it*
It only took Dean a few seconds to step into action and pull his gun out of his waistband that he always had for protection. He aimed and shot one of the creatures perfectly square between the eyes, he always was a great shot.
“Why are you late?” John asked with malice. By the look in his father’s eyes Dean knew he was going to get a beating. His eyes were filled with anger and Dean tried to think back to a time when his father’s eyes were kind and happy. He could only remember one instance and it happened before his mother died. ‘I guess that’s when it all changed,’ Dean thought to himself.
‘Fuck, I hadn’t even thought of that,” Dean thought to himself as more anxiety flooded into him. “We could just say that we had some project we needed to do and stayed in the library,” he suggested.
Dean pulled his phone and thought about texting Sam but then decided against it as he didn’t want Sam looking at his new injuries if he didn’t have to anymore.
He dialled Steve’s number. It rang three times before a deep voice answered, “Sam? Is everything ok?”
Dean smiled slightly, ‘at least he can make jokes’ he thought to himself. “Honestly?” Clint nodded, “I don’t know,” Clint sighed.
“I’m sure it will be fine, it’s not like they know where to find you,” Sam stated, though he sounded a little unsure. “And we need to think of something to tell Dad about why we’re late.”
Dean ran out of the room while the team checked on Clint. ‘I didn’t mean to do that to him, it was just instinct,’ Dean thought to himself as he desperately tried to find a way out of the unfamiliar tower.
A few minutes later Dean heard the front door slam and knew he was about to get some fresh bruises at the very least. And sure enough, only a couple of seconds later, John shouted up the stairs, “Dean! Get your ass down here!” Thoughts raced through Dean’s mind about any reason his Dad might have for the beating tonight. Although he rarely ever had a reason anyway.
Dean seemed completely relaxed throughout the day, and the team felt glad getting to see this happy, normal teenager side to Dean.
When the team broke through the door, the sight made white hot rage bubble underneath the team’s skin.
“Alright you can wait here or go with Sam, but I’m gonna do my stuff alone,” Dean said as he walked up the stairs.
“It’s the best way.” Tony’s got no fight in him. He hasn’t in a long time. “Earth needs you more than it needs me.”
He leaves the ring on til morning, when he wakes up hungover, and takes it off in disgust at himself.
“Anthony Edward Stark-“ Tony groans at the use of his full name, but he’s smiling and Steve’s smiling and his voice is soft as he squeezes Tony’s shoulder, “will you do me the honour, of allowing me to be your husband?” he asks, and he’s smiling softly, radiantly, when Tony tears his gaze from the ring to look up at him. The happiness of this moment, the hope for their future sits warm in Tony’s chest, and despite everything, there’s a burning at the back of his eyes.
Tony caught Thor’s eye across the table, and the god merely raised a pointed eyebrow at him. Some help he was going to be. “Good luck working it out,” Tony told them – though they barely noticed, not even glancing away from the debate as he stood from his chair, “I’m going to find some clothes.”
“So, what’s up with you?” Tony asked several hours later, stepping off stage from the press conference. It had gone well, Tony had attended exactly as Pepper had asked him to, and nicely answered and fielded all questions. It was like the press had a newfound respect for him in places, and Tony only wished it would last. Once they got over discovering that he was a dragon – and a baby one, by all respects – they’d go back to degrading him.
“I have some phone calls to make. Tony,” she nodded at him with a smile, “Avengers,” she waved to them, and then stepped back into the elevator. Tony watched her go, and then headed into the kitchen. He intended to grab something from the fridge, but Bruce – who hadn’t been called out – pushed a plate over to him, with what they all jokingly called the Steven on it. The Steven was a foot-high monstrosity of a sandwich, designed to give Steve all the calories his heightened metabolism burnt off during callout. Tony considered a protest, but it was pointless now they knew, and happily tucked into the meal.
to make an ill-timed joke regarding the last time the split into two between Tony and Steve before Tony even thinks of it. It doesn’t ache like it did, and he doesn’t flinch. It’s a regret but not a problem, and the day is going to be spectacular. Rhodey, Pepper, Natasha and Clint are on Tony’s side, while Bucky, Sam, Thor and Sharon take Steve’s.
“I don’t mean transforming in the middle of the street!” She snapped, and then took a deep breath. “The world will get over it. I mean why didn’t you tell
“Huh. Um, well- here.” Tony held the book out to him, and Steve took it reverently, tracing his fingers over the inscription in the heavy binding with a feather-light touch. “This was my mother’s jewel,” Tony told him, and Steve looked up from the cover to gape at him. “My grandmama’s journal. A wealth of information on dragon lore.”
Even now, when magical species are integrated with humanity across the globe, and most dragons chose human forms; all dragons have hoards. Whether they keep dragonish features, or hide themselves completely, a dragon has a hoard and it will probably give them away.
. Tony pretends not to notice. He’s getting good at pretending, so many years of pretending he’s fine.
, Tony.” Her voice was shaking, and Tony immediately felt even more guilty about his secret than he already had.
No one said anything in the elevator, and Tony had Thor’s cape wrestled into a makeshift toga to step out onto the common floor, hoping for a snack,
?” Tony’s heart clenched, realising she had tears in her eyes. He stepped forward, and carefully brushed a tear away as it fell – his eyes wouldn’t be human yet, he still had scales down his arms, his horns were still grown and his teeth were still sharp, but she didn’t flinch, leaning into his hand for a moment.
Tony never really considered what being in a relationship openly with Steve might mean, but he’s almost eager to try. Steve seems a little more apprehensive of the backlash he’s going to get from their friends, but he’s not backing down. They’re going to tell them all, together, the united front they should’ve
It goes down well for the most part – with cheering and several “it’s about fucking time guys!”, and a few calls for people to pay-up that Tony’s going to ignore. Rhodey walks straight up to them both – and Tony
Steve huffed, but he tipped the last of the bag into his mouth, and pulled off his shirt without protest. Tony bit back a groan at the number of bandages covering Steve’s torso, but there was no visible blood – Tony couldn’t smell any either – and he let his fingers trace over the bandages. They were still secure and Tony hmphed in surrender. He looked up to tell Steve that he was happy, and found his face mere inches from his own.
“I love you for many reasons.” Steve had begun, “for the way you look with a new idea, and how cute you are when you’re tired. For how you always know just what I need, and for the way you make my heart skip when you smile at me,” and he’d blushed at the aww-ing they were subjected to then, “and for how you gave me a home. Not just here, but with
, rubbing circles on his back and crouched in front of him. She takes the tablet from his hands with careful fingers and Tony’s
Natasha merely raises an eyebrow at him, and Clint is gaping at him, Steve looks confused and Bruce looks wary, but Thor is smiling brightly at him.
“Okay Tony,” Steve whispered, and allowed Tony to pull him out of the elevator. Tony pushed him down into the central pile, where he’d been curled up several hours previous, and went towards one of the smaller shelving units. He rescued a first aid kit and some snacks, and a bottle of water, bundling them in a corner of Thor’s cape and taking them back to Steve.
Tony put down the solder, and turned fully to give Steve his full attention, considering how to answer. “In dragons,” he began slowly, “it is often expected that a dragon’s jewel is the same as their hoard. A book hoarder’s jewel will be a book, a plant hoarder’s jewel will be a plant.”
“Eat, drink. I need to find clothes.” Tony pointed at the food and then at Steve, and Steve dutifully picked up one of the bags of trail mix and began to eat. Tony wandered over to the closet hidden behind a barrier, and dug around until he found underwear and comfortable jeans. He realised with a startled glance in the mirror that his eyes were still golden slits, and that while he’d lost the extra extremities that came with his dragon form, crimson scales were starting to take up permanent residence in small patches. He tugged on a shirt but left it hanging open, and returned to find that Steve had already moved on to a second snack bag. Tony grinned in triumph, and dropped down in front of him, cross-legged. “Shirt off, Rogers, I need to check you haven’t torn your stitches.” Tony told him.
“Too long.” Steve quirked a small smile and glanced down at him. “They only stopped because Thor pointed out a dragon’s hoard is often private.” Tony laughed.
Part of Tony, a large part that Tony almost hates, wants to drag Steve down into a kiss, but the rest is angry, and Tony goes with that. Anger is easy, after everything, in a way that comes a little too close to Howard’s hair-trigger attitude that Tony can’t believe he’s thinking of
!” Tony demanded, and Particle Man (Tony was sticking with it, names were a useless thing in the face of titles to be won and earned) set to work, returning the items to their former state, under Tony’s watchful gaze. Not long after he’d finished, were Shield taking him away, and Thor was grinning up at Tony – Tony gave him a smile that showed all his teeth, and then called out; “I
Dean joked and laughed with everyone, and they were all having fun until Thor slapped Dean on the shoulder good-naturedly.
“The boy seemed to have only left the hospital a few hours ago with a slight concussion and a broken leg. He seems to have used another fake name as when I looked into it, again there were no records of a Dean Winchester. There was, however, forms with the name ‘James Brown’ matching the boy’s injuries.” The AI completed.
“Ok, now figure out what’s wrong with him,” Tony said. Bruce started to take Dean’s shirt off and once he had cut through the white material, he and the whole team gasped. They saw scars, burns, cuts and bruises covering his entire torso.
“Ok, well, he has a broken leg and it seems a slight concussion,” The male doctor said. Sam just stared at Dean; he didn’t say a word.
While Steve and Natasha headed straight for the older man, Tony and Bruce headed straight for the unconscious teen laying on the floor, a fair amount of blood pooling around him.
Sam sat down at the table as Dean fixed the bacon. The couch was empty meaning that Dad was either up in his room or he left last night. Dean was praying that he left, or he would at least not wake up until the boys were out of the house. Dean was sporting a purple bruise on his left cheek, mirroring the slightly more healed yellow greenish one on the side if his chin, a small cut just above his right eyebrow and a busted right side of his lower lip. He didn’t particularly feel like reopening the cuts.
*Of course* Tony texted, *We’re just figuring out a way to avoid something like New Jersey happening again*
Sam’s ragged breathing hadn’t stopped, and the team thought they heard a small sniff, as if he was crying.
He exited onto the street outside and thanked all the God’s he knew that his Baby was parked just two blocks away. He raced to the impala and jumped into the driver’s seat, speeding off with the only thought in his head, ‘God, I hope Sammy’s ok.’
He put some bacon on two pieces of kitchen tissue after he realised the time and that they would be late if they didn’t leave in the next thirty seconds, plus he also wanted to get out of the house incase his Dad was asleep upstairs and decided to wake up.
Their eyes softened and they turned to look at him. “So you had a flashback?” Tony inquired. Dean shrugged and remained silent.
“What?” Tony said with a panicked edge to his voice. “Move, I’ll fly him to the med bay at the tower.”
“Wait, you just had surgery, you shouldn’t be out of bed let alone moving around,” Steve said quickly.
As Bruce began working over Dean to make sure he was ok to be moved, Tony began “Hey buddy, you have to wake up for us.”
Dean look confused for half a second and immediately played along, internally thanking Sam that he was smart enough to give a fake name.
It was nearly time to take off the cast, but Dean didn’t want to go to the hospital, so he had texted the avengers for the first time, asking if he could get his cast of at the tower.
Once he was dressed, Dean went to get Sammy out of bed, but to his surprise Sammy wasn’t in his room. He was downstairs and cooking breakfast, something that was normally Dean’s responsibility.
“No the burn scars aren’t twelve years old, and besides, a fire wouldn’t cause the other scars we saw,” Bruce replied calmly.
When he woke up and tried to get up Bruce tried to get him to lay back down, but Dean was determined. He swung his legs over the bed, a pained grimace on his face.
Dean walked into the living area of the tower and straight into the avengers and Sam sat watching TV.
Dean winced when Sam put a little too much pressure on his hurt rib and Sam pulled back to look at him in the eye. “Maybe you should go to the hospital, it could be broken.”
As soon as Steve sat down, six pairs of hands reached for the stack and once they disappeared, the stack only had two out of the twenty-eight left that Steve made. He chuckled and reached for the remaining pancakes. The team ate happily and talked about random things.
Thor only nodded, he still felt bad about setting Dean off, even if everyone did know it was an accident.
“Like Dad would believe that YOU stayed late at school to work on a project, but it’s the best we have,” Sam said with uncertainty.
Dean stopped hitting and looked up to see all three of them staring at him. He then looked down to his knuckles and saw a small amount of blood seeping through the tape.
‘You’re a stupid worthless good for nothing brat’ his father hissed, punctuating every word with a kick to the stomach.
Dean was about to retort when he suddenly remembered he was probably late to pick up Sammy. “Shit!” He exclaimed, causing the team to jump a little in surprise.
Dean made it back to the school in 5 minutes to see Sam sat on a small brick wall with his head in his hands. He pulled the car into the parking spot closest to his brother.
This continued for five minutes, alternating between kicks and whips, until Dean passed out. But John didn’t stop because Dean passed out, he continued hitting and hitting and didn’t look like he would stop anytime soon.
This ritual carried on for 6 more rounds, until Dean stood up, swaying slightly, vision blurry and made his way into the
John was still hitting Dean, over and over again, when he heard a loud crash and turned to see the front door off of its hinges, and something round hurtling towards him.
“Good,” Bruce said, “You’re going to have to stay in the bed for a little while, we don’t want you to reopen your wounds and start bleeding again.”
When Dean walked into the living room, hair still wet, he saw Tony pacing in front of a calm looking Steve.
“Are you sure we can just do that?” Bucky asked, “I thought the plan was get him and his brother out immediately?”
Bruce unfroze from where he was starting and began to inspect the bruises and cuts when he felt a strange lump where his ribs are. “His rib is broken,” Bruce spoke, “It might have pierced his lung, resulting in his not breathing.”
Dean froze again, “How the hell do you know about Sammy?” he asked with some anger. ‘I will protect Sammy if it’s the last thing I do,” he thought to himself.
Normally he would have flinched from the contact, but for some reason he felt safe, he thought it might have just been the tequila and drugs, ‘What did I take anyway?’, but he knew, deep down that he was safe with whoever was holding him now.
The other three joined them at the table then. “You’re not mad?” Tony asked, hating himself for asking, but needing to know.
Jarvis was hoard, Maria was hoard, even Obadiah was hoard which Tony understood as much as he resented.
