“Your timing is awfully suspicious, that’s all,” Tony says, shrugging and dragging a hand through his hair, wincing when he realizes how badly he’s in need of a shower. “What, you afraid to do things without your partner in crime?”
“There’s nothing you need to get in touch for,” Steve points out, but the words feel flimsy.
He almost wants the same treatment, but settles for brushing his hands together until they’re mostly clean.
That afternoon, Steve’s in the middle of patching the screen door when Bonnie steps out onto the small screened-in porch.
It’s almost cute, Tony thinks, that Steve had put that much thought into it. He absently sucks the pad of his thumb into his mouth just long enough to get it wet before soothing it over the slightly swollen nipple, and if he didn’t have his legs locked around Steve’s hips, he thinks he’d land on the floor with how Steve full-body shivers, head thrown back and knees buckling.
He locks the door behind Sam before returning to the couch to finish his coffee. Remote in hand, he resolutely ignores whatever lingering commentary about the Avengers is being spewed and ends up powering the whole thing down when he can’t find anything halfway decent that isn’t morning cartoons. Just the thought of listening to people - people who don’t even
“I’ll be right back,” is what he settles on, and Tony feels his mouth drop open as his front goes instantly cool. It’s not an unwelcome feeling, exactly, when the literal heat between them had been enough to make his head swim even without taking the circumstances into consideration. He still feels left, though, and blatantly checks Steve out as he makes his way across the room and into the bathroom.
It’s Tony in response to a question about the state of Sokovia in the aftermath.
Steve shakes his head, similar to how he had when Tony had asked the question the day before, moments after it became abundantly clear that his alternate self wasn’t coming back. They’d both suspected, Steve more certain than Tony for once, but to be confronted with the reality or it was something else entirely. He’d told Steve that it wouldn’t have been unnatural for him to suddenly reconsider the decision, and had even gone so far as to offer to send Steve himself into that parallel universe to retrieve it.
It would also bleed him dry. Being in the city day after day, remembering how it used to be, remembering what had gotten him through those five years. It would drain him, and he’d just be scraping out his insides, selling his organs on the black market, letting others live so he could die. It would be a noble cause, but Steve knows. He knows he won’t survive it, not without her.
As it is, by the time he’s up in the penthouse for the night, the only thing he’s got to show for his hard work is an address in D.C. and a sliver of damning evidence from JARVIS.
“Yeah.”
It’s only then that the hard angles of Tony’s face begin to melt, gracious edges coalescing into something much less harsh.
Everything feels charged, Steve’s ears buzzing as he wars inside, between what he’s wanted and what he knows they’re not ready for. In the end, he licks his lips and looks away, hating the glimpse of disappointment he catches on Tony’s face.
Carol fills an enormous mug to the tippy top, and Rhodes dramatically drains the entire carafe while looking Tony straight in the eye the entire time. Tony’s jaw unhinges in outright shock, and Steve tries not to laugh as Rhodey and Carol walk their mugs to the kitchen table.
Steve makes his way between things, between heaps of scraps and what he swears looks like a children’s biology playset. He points to it as he gets close, and then pulls the safety glasses off Tony’s face to stroke the dent left behind on the bridge of his nose.
“Maybe this is my punishment,” he says unthinkingly, and Peggy frowns. “Maybe this is what I get for staying here.”
The sun hasn’t even risen yet, Rogers’ hair sticks straight up because of the cowl, and it’s not a life Tony ever thought he’d be living.
He casts a look around, trying to remember what the hotel room he’d checked into at Caesar's Palace had looked like, because this is decidedly
It hadn’t taken much convincing, and Steve hums around the straw of his shake. It’s peach flavored, a touch too artificial, but he’s been swapping back and forth for Beth’s Oreo.
Then there’s a noise from the phone in his hand and he remembers who’s on the other end, and curses.
“Sam was getting annoying,” Steve says, tucking the Neosporin back in its slot in the kit. “Figured it was the only way to shut him up.”
So he won’t dig it out; won’t even look at it. He’s known since the beginning how unrealistic of a fantasy it had been, has long since locked it in a drawer and thrown away the key, but merely knowing that it had existed - knowing that he’d had the smallest spark of reason to hope for it in the first place - makes the reality that much harsher.
“What will you do?” he asks, knowing the answer but needing to hear it anyway.
Natasha turns quickly, gripping his wrist so her nails dig into the underside, nearly enough to break the skin.
“If you’re offering.”
He’d write the same sort of article he’d written at the time of the kidnapping, and that’s exactly why Tony wants him for the job.
“I used to think chemistry was boring,” Tony says. “But then I built a particle accelerator in my garage.”
“What?” Tony mumbles against fevered skin.
Tony looks at him, likely mentally rattling off that very short list, and taps his fingers against his glass.
“I hope you know I wouldn’t - ”
“Learn how to take a compliment, Steve,” Tony says, tapping his fingers on the arm of the chair, and the familiar action makes Steve think about a kitchen table and a glass of lemonade and secrets being spilled. “Alright. So you fresh out of the ice is a dick in every timeline, and water is wet. Continue.”
“I need to know,” he says, and it’s easier to keep from wavering when he’s pretending he’s talking to the cityscape, polished and shiny black behind Tony. “That first time we met. At your house, in Malibu.”
“I only wanted to - ”
“You’ve got an interrupting problem, you know,” he remarks.
“Should it not matter that people swooped in and leveled an entire downtown?” Tony’s eyes had met Steve’s momentarily, shadowed and dancing madly. “Regardless of intent, what’s been done has still caused irreparable damage to thousands of households, and that’s without getting into the death toll.”
“You’re welcome, Tony,” Pepper says through another yawn. “I’m going back to bed. Please do not bother me.”
It is then that he realizes: he is young again.
“I’m not here to make you out to be anything.” Steve wants to bristle, not appreciating the insinuation, because Tony should know which side of the line he’d choose if forced to. That’s why he’s here, isn’t it? “I’m here to interview you within a set of specific parameters. TIME wants an article about the series of events that occurred this past spring and the relevant factors at play. Public perception is a pretty large part of what you do, and I’m asking you to comment on that.”
“Well,” he says, looking down at Steve calculatingly. “I guess this is the only time he’s ever been right about something.”
“What did Peggy say?”
“I’d like for Morgan to know you beyond the creepy shrine Barnes has got going in the compound.”
Tony doesn’t answer, but he does keep talking as he begins walking. “You think I don’t know exactly who you are? Of course I know that you know Happy. I’m not an amnesiac, and the helmet’s equipped with more than adequate impact absorption. I meant, how do you know he’s out of commission?” He stops a few yards away and casts an expectant look at Steve. “Are you coming?”
It’s hard to hug Sam - Sam, who got him through one of the loneliest times of his life - but he does, and he tries not to hold on.
“But I’ll see you,” Tony says, seeking confirmation that Steve gives in the form of a head-tilt-nod kind of thing. “Otherwise, I’ll blast you all over Twitter. Send angry mobsters to your front door with pitchforks, that kind of thing.”
retiring, seeing as how
“I always thought I’d be the one kissing you,” Tony says, and it’s so surreal that he feels almost giddy with it. “I can’t believe you did it first.”
“Mr. Stark will agree to accept the honor only if they permit you to conduct the interview.”
Steve’s about to vibrate out of his skin. Every inch of him is buzzing when Tony sweeps in just as they’ve started eating, fixing himself a plate and then sliding into the seat next to Steve with not so much as a greeting.
The instinct to keep it all to himself is so strong, ingrained from a lifetime of secrets, but this is Tony, and it’s one more chance than he ever thought he’d get, and he’s not going to let it slip through his fingers.
“You’re a selfish coward,” she cries, and it’s the worst fight they’ve ever had. “You’re going to - they’re going to
“Come swim with me,” she says, placing her hands on the sides of his face. He really needs to trim his beard. “Daddy’s too busy.”
And Tony knows exactly what he’s going to say next because it’s been an automatic mantra on the tip of his tongue all week -
Steve ends up leaving Clint a thank you note.
“Really?” Bonnie breathes out, leaning in and twirling the ends of her hair around her finger. “That was real? That wasn’t CGI?”
“Tony,” Steve says, and this time he does fully huff, even as his back arches and he shoves himself down to Tony’s knuckles. “I am begging you to stop worrying about vectors and velocity and whatever else is going on in your head right now, and just enjoy this with me.”
“Yes?” he asks Steve, who is in the middle of digging bullets out of his body with the pair of forceps that Natasha had insisted he use in place of his bare hands. “Is there something you’d like to share with the class, Cap?”
“I know,” he coaxes. “It’s different, I know. Just talk to me, tell me what you need.”
He does take his time draining the last of his coffee though, rocking back on his heels on the almost-edge of the sidewalk before getting a move on.
Because Steve doesn’t touch Tony, not like this, not beyond casual accidental brushes or purposeful redirections. There’s never been any cause or need, and Tony flashes back to the moment at the front door, wondering how the hell the man he knows so well can still manage to surprise him. Admittedly, they haven’t known each other for very long in the most basic of measures, but the things they’ve been through - well, it’s more than enough to pull two people together.
“What about me?”
Tony lets out a strangled little laugh, caught in the back of his throat and scraping and rough, and Steve is sure he’s about to be told off for how inappropriate that was. But Tony seems intent on surprising him and nudges their temples together before aligning their faces nose-to-nose, and Steve goes a little cross-eyed but refuses to look away.
All of it - whoever else may exist in this heaven, how the three of them will adjust to the new dynamic, whoever else may come to join them in the future -
“You,” Tony says, recognition barely flickering in his hazy vision, body unfocused and tense in all the wrong places.
“I leave because I know you never want me to stay!” Steve yells out, and he needs to get out of the car. “Jesus, Tony. It’s the only thing I can do! You’ve never let me fix anything, never accepted an apology. I’m not going to push you when you’ve got all the right into the world to hate me, but I’m not going to stick around to be crucified, either!”
They defile the hot tub, and it’s the most glorious night of Steve’s life.
He’s pleading and it’s so much that it’s all Tony can do to listen, chasing his own end as much as he’s trying to give Steve his. Everything comes down to this, and Tony can’t remember if anything else has ever mattered as much as this does, as much as cementing what they feel and what they’re going to have from here on out, this consummation the most vital point of any timeline to ever exist.
“We’re here,” Tony says abruptly, pulling his phone out of nowhere and momentarily lifting upwards to rap his knuckles hard against the partition.
“You yelled at me when I paid for dinner last night,” Steve reminds him.
, their bodies an intoxicating back and forth and then Tony doesn’t think he can hold off for much longer.
“Seriously,” she says, bending in. “What do we think it is?”
The line falls icily silent. Steve curses to himself as he fumbles his phone and plastic shaker bottle, balancing the former on the narrow railing ledge while attempting to simultaneously avoid spilling his cookies-and-cream shake and switch the call to speakerphone.
“Yeah?” Tony says, twisting around to look at him. “That’s it? Nothing about how you’ve got to spend time at the house, and how it’s a miracle that you and I haven’t blown up half the continent yet? Or - ”
“Sam told me about you and Pepper,” Steve says, a foul taste in the back of his throat. “Says you live at the new compound. I’m not going to kick you out of yet another home you built for yourself and your family.”
“Only if you do too,” Steve says, and it’s kind of funny, the way he tries to inject a commanding tone into the words but only barely manages it.
“I love you.”
That’s not even the real problem, Steve thinks wildly.
Steve would have sworn he’d already made it clear, or that it was so heavily implied that it would be impossible to miss, but he looks into the tortoiseshell of Tony’s eyes and brushes his lips over his eyebrows, first one and then the other, while he readies himself.
“Just talking about the room situation,” she says, sounding tired but as happy as she gets. “Some of these guys will have to bunk together.”
“I’m just a journalist,” Steve points out. “Hardly the first you’ve met, I’m sure. We’re not all that interesting.”
“I have no idea who this ‘we’ you speak of includes.”
“Do you want me to have asked you here to get to know Morgan?” Tony asks, and Steve can’t look away from his mouth as he talks.
“Tony’s thinking of retiring,” Rogers says directly.
Tony packs protein bars in the suit and always remembers Gatorade after, because Steve is stubborn and forgets to fuel up and recover properly, reckless and dependent on the serum in a way that Tony will never understand.
After he hangs up, Steve breathes easy.
If Steve is going to do this, he’s not going to write that story. He’s not going to write about playing with power, and he’s not going to force Tony to hold himself accountable. He’s going to stay true to the facts and his own standards, and -
“Yeah,” Tony says, sitting up straighter. “Because the way I figure, it’s one of two things. One,” - he holds up an index finger, again - “it’s worse than the whole brainwashed buddy sob story, which at this point, wouldn’t really surprise me. If Natasha’s SHIELD data dump taught me anything, it’s that even I’ve got a lot to learn in that particular area. Or two,” - he flicks up his middle finger, then pointedly folds down the first finger, earning an eye roll from the man sitting in front of him - “it’s not bad but you still don’t want me to know about it, which begs the question of why, and means it’s probably worth putting on a little puppy dog face and playing the dead parents card in order to get it out of you.”
“I shouldn’t have, either,” Tony says. “Do you really think I never want you to stay?”
Steve laughs him off the phone because Coulson had been good, but nobody could ever beat Tony Stark at his own game.
Tony is suddenly hyper-aware of his heart in his chest, of how it’s rabbiting along and expanding to take up all the room where his lungs are supposed to go. He can’t inhale but it’s not terrible, it’s almost
“You? Never.”
Steve’s eyes are earnest and determined, and Tony knows he’s trying.
“Same with my kids,” Steve says.
Steve talks and talks, only breaking when Natasha comes to bid them goodnight before retiring to her rooms, and his voice never grows hoarse. He tells Tony about Fury and Rogers, and Tony chuckles.
Tony’s eyes go wet, and Steve opens his arms. It’s a bit awkward but Tony finds his way in, still slight against Steve’s gradually diminishing frame, and the smell of metal and sweat and pure Tony makes it near impossible to pull back from the hug.
“Hard to be Cap when you gave away the shield faster than I gave away my virginity,” Tony says begrudgingly. “Borderline same level of enthusiasm, too. Kind of frightening, when you think about it.”
Tony squints at him exaggeratedly. “Has Pepper been reading to you from the sexual harassment section of the SI employee handbook, too?”
He’s not the same man Steve used to know, Steve realizes with a pang. But he still smiles at Steve the same way.
“I went back and stayed there. What else was I supposed to do? I got a second chance, and I took it.”
“You staying on the team wouldn’t necessarily involve us fighting,” Tony tries to tell him, but Steve isn’t having it.
“Sorry,” he says, injecting the word with hardly enough sincerity to pass muster. Sam always knows when Steve’s feigning apology; his remarkable ability to see through anyone’s bullshit is one of the many reasons he’s worth keeping around. “You know how I get when you throw things.”
“That’s okay,” Tony says, and Steve knows he’s being studied. “I’m serious, no one’s asking you to. You don’t ever have to go into open combat ever again, if you don’t want to.”
At least he isn’t dirty.
But Wanda just smiles at him kindly, and maybe everyone has gotten the memo to handle him with kid gloves, because there’s no sign of a welcome committee. There’s a quiet electronic hum as he’s led through hallways and up open stairs, admiring the design. It’s got Tony written all over it, from the mementos installed in alcoves behind glass to the holograms sprouting up in midair.
He’ll bring it up soon, he tells himself, watching Tony toss his crust back in the box and brush crumbs off his hands.
He slides home inch by trembling inch, and by the time he’s fully seated, he realizes that at some point during the process, their free hands have found each other. Tony is driving Steve’s into the mattress, both of them clutching fiercely, and he feels a little sideways at the enormity of it all.
Steve is jolted awake, more aware than he’s been thus far.
It’s the definition of picturesque, and Steve carefully snaps shots of the scenery and sends them off to Beth and Josie, knowing that the latter will show everyone at the house.
Tony blinks wearily. “Not my assistant. I hope you didn’t call her that. She basically runs the team. I just sign the paychecks.”
“Yeah, Steve,” Tony says, and he sounds like he’s smiling. “That’s okay.”
“About...forty-five minutes ago,” Steve says, checking the microwave clock as Tony crowds his space. “And I did tell you. I gave you your own mug, and you took one look at it before getting back to work.”
He opens his mouth, prepared to fumble his way through an explanation of why he can’t explain anything at all, when Tony’s posture changes, eyes flitting beyond Steve.
“He’s
“You had Pepper,” Steve says helplessly, and the sun is setting rapidly, the clouds turning from fluffy white to mottled shades of gray. “And Rhodes, and this time you had Morgan. I wasn’t going to insert myself where - ”
Beth texts back almost immediately:
Instead, he takes it as assurance that they really are in this together.
“I didn’t want you to,” Steve says. “You can understand the risks. You are only the fifth person to know.”
Refusing to let go, Steve keeps at least one of Tony’s hands in his at all times. It’s a tether and he’s not ashamed to need it, and Tony seems to understand without Steve needing to explain it. They sit on the wooden steps, side by side, Tony curled into Steve’s side and breathing steady and heavy as they both stare out before them.
"Is that why - "
“I’m okay,” he says with a shrug, like it’s no big deal. “They’re just pictures.”
Rogers apologizes and Steve waves him off, but he still strides ahead down the hall to check on her.
“I can help,” he says, because it’s all he can do.
Tony whirls around, and Steve can read all of the transcendent indignance etched into his features.
have other factors to be concerned with. Like getting into bed at a semi-decent hour.”
“D’you normally smoke?” Steve is carefully conversational, and Tony looks at him briefly.
The microwave beeps and Steve hooks his thumbs in his belt.
Fury leaves only after he’s demolished the better half of one of Peggy’s biscuit packets, and Steve grumbles loudly about having to go to the store to restock. Steve walks him to the door, glad that the serum has preserved enough muscle and coordination that he doesn’t need assistance, not yet at least.
“No,” Steve agrees. The word somehow crumbles to ash as he speaks, feeling more like a dissension. “No strippers.”
“So?” Tony prompts. “The package? Or is Bernard scamming me?”
“Er,” Tony hedges, watching closely as Steve stands stock still in front of the deli counter. “Do we need to - ”
Tony taps his fingers some more.
Tony is, justifiably, skeptical.
The line goes quiet.
“Tell him what?”
Steve has never been able to do a single thing to point the two of them in the right direction. Tony is the wind, forcing them wherever he decides, and Steve has always been powerless to protest, to try and change course. The one time he had, he’d lost as much ground as he’d gained.
There’s a glint of
“You didn’t bring me here just to tell me about some unrequited tragic love story,” he says, unable to keep the awe out of his voice. “You brought me here to tell me that you love me.”
He shoots Steve an accusing glance, but the guy doesn’t even look up from where he’s maneuvering the cart down to load the plastic bags in.
“I won't,” she says. “At least, I’m going to try not to. Anyway. Are you still visiting Tony for Memorial Day? Because Callie wants to see you again but that’s the weekend she was thinking of coming.”
“I don't think that - ”
Steve just shakes his head. “Don’t do that. Not for me.”
Steve sits in his favorite spot, the second cushion from the left. His arm stretches out along the back of the couch, nodding along and sipping his water as he listens to whatever Natasha is saying. He looks recently showered but has completely forgone all social norms in wearing sweatpants and one of his indecently tight shirts, and Tony doesn’t even hesitate before falling into the space next to him.
There had been flickers, moments in time where Tony had dared to step closer. Steve had only seen them too late, after he’d inadvertently burned out a flame that had little to no chance of surviving anyway.
“I don’t mind going over it all again,” Steve says, his hand resting on his thigh, still safely ensconced within Tony’s.
the remarkably succinct text had read
Pierce rolls his lips together unflatteringly. “Do you realize the kind of opportunity that’s fallen into our laps, here? This is a once-in-a-lifetime shot, kid. If we play our cards right, this can be huge. You were one of the last civilians to see Stark before he flew to Afghanistan, and we can capitalize on that. Leave the speculation to everyone else - we can talk about whether or not you saw it coming, if maybe this is karmic retribution for all that he’s contributed to the war effort, all the signs that point towards him being an irresponsible cocky - ”
“Oh, Steve,” she murmurs, coming down beside him. “Darling. Come here.”
“I didn’t suck his dick,” Steve emphasizes.
“He’ll get us there safe,” Sam says, jerking his chin to where Bucky is already fiddling with the controls. “We want to sleep in our own beds tonight. Everyone misses you, you know.”
“Borrowed your toothbrush. Saw it in the bathroom, figured you wouldn’t mind.”
“I know,” Steve says gently. “I intended on staying this long, anyway. Long enough to see you through Thanos.”
Steve rolls his eyes and wheels them towards the cart drop off, case of seltzer tucked under one arm.
“Yawn like a normal person,” Tony chides uselessly.
- and rolls his eyes before tossing back three more almonds to keep from saying anything he’ll end up regretting. They’re dry enough to suck all the moisture from the membrane of his mouth, so he takes a too-large gulp of grapefruit-scented bubbly water before wondering if the line has gone dead.
She just pulls her left leg up to rest on the seat, and they settle into easy conversation about life in the compound. Words come much more readily from her than ever before, and while she’ll never be as talkative as Sam, he’s content to let the lulls come and go as they make their way through the suburbs and into the country.
Morgan looks thrilled.
Steve releases Tony’s elbow with a stern stare.
He has a few more calls to make.
They collapse together, Tony’s face tucked in Steve’s neck and they’re both sweaty with heaving chests pressed together. Steve feels like he might never catch his breath again, never wants to if this is what he gets to have, and it’s like all his bones have dissolved with the sheer intensity of it. His brain goes blissfully empty and it’s got to be the same for Tony, who just puffs short, uneven breaths against Steve’s thundering pulse point.
If he’s going to go out with a bang, might as well make it a big one.
He remembers why when he’s working the phones the next day.
When he tells Charlie, it’s because he's is upset and frustrated about bullies at school. He comes home running his mouth about some kids in his class who wear expensive sneakers and trip kids on the playground, and Steve takes him down to a public park to throw a ball around and slip in what life was like for a teenage Steve Rogers. Charlie brushes it off, but when Denise comes to him late that night and tells him she loves him for loving her family, he tells her that he loves her and it’s his family too.
“You know what you can tell them? You know what you can write in this crap-tastic article you seem intent on writing?” Steve flinches where Tony can’t see, not with his hands dragging down his face. “Tell them that Iron Man is fucking
“I need the angle, sunshine,” Tony tells him, scissoring his fingers in gradually widening intervals.
“This sounds like a private conversation,” she says tightly. “Please don’t make me wish I’d bunked up front with whatever opera Bruce is in the middle of forcing Thor to listen to.”
He swears he sees the stars of their cosmos when he does, and Steve believes him.
“Give Peg my condolences,” Howard says mildly. He’s not quite hardened yet, not the man Tony had spoken of, but Steve can’t be sure that that means anything will go differently. Decades still stretch out in front of them; plenty of time for him to become absent and for Tony to become bitter.
“Come on,” he cajoles, a last-ditch effort. “It was either this or hospital food, and I’m not paying to eat rubbery scrambled eggs.”
There’s a stupid impulse to joke about it, to offer Steve a chicken’s exit and let him get off the ride before it really begins, but then Steve is nodding with a resounding, “Yes,” and Tony thinks that maybe Steve had been onto something, doing it all in this very specific order, starting with traveling to the house before moving onto their own series of confessions.
Rogers mouth presses into a thin line as he nods.
“It’s something, isn’t it?” she says, knocking their shoulders together. “It was a bit of a collaborative effort if I’m being honest. Let me say, Tony isn’t easy to work with. I really would have liked something a little less rustic, but I guess all those years on the lake permanently changed his interior design preferences.”
There’s no good answer to that question, something Tony seems to realize as he gets his feet under him.
“Just be careful,” Steve says, because it’s the only thing he can reasonably think to say. “You don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings, or lead anyone on.”
“You looked good in the tux,” Tony says, like it’s nothing, like it’s not an expensive outfit that Steve knows will fit him like a glove if he could stand to open it long enough to actually consider putting it on again. “I told you. You look good in blue.”
Steve steps back and lets her settle in to his desk chair while Clint leans in over her shoulder, whispering instructions that she bats away with pointy elbows. He doesn’t even stop to watch them; he trusts Natasha, trusts Clint by extension, and is grateful that he’d made the decision to take them up on their offer of Friday night beers back at the end of his very first week at the office. There’s no way they’d let him do this alone, he knows, no matter how much Clint is probably holding himself back from all kinds of inappropriate snarky innuendos.
The expression on Bonnie’s face tells him that whatever she needed to hear, he hasn’t said it, so he tries again.
They catch each other's eyes, and Steve can see how Tony’s smirk falters.
“I don’t care,” Pepper says. “Should I keep her for the night?”
“Are you just never going to come back?”
“Not much,” Steve says. “We’re almost at the end.”
Neither of them needs him to finish that sentence. There are many things Howard should have been, that he was not.
Serena magnanimously allows her hands to be squeezed within an inch of her life as Steve cleans the shallow wound, and Christina howls in childlike pain. He winces but keeps going, dabbing on Neosporin with a cotton swab and reminding himself to thank Denise for keeping the first aid kit stocked. Just as he’s handing Christina the box of Disney Princess Band-aids, letting her pick who she wants plastered over her knee, the phone rings.
“Anything.”
Steve grabs his extended fingers, holds them in a tight grip, and Tony feels compelled to look him directly in the eye.
He doesn’t have to look to know that Steve is rolling his eyes, hands assuredly set on his hips as he surveys what’s in front of them.
“We can go inside,” Tony says, low and calm again, as soft as the fattening flakes landing all around them. “Get warmed up. There’s hot chocolate, we could - ”
“I can hear you, you know,” Clint calls from the front of the Quinjet.
“Not. That one,” Steve repeats, and now there’s just one bag left in the cart, and Tony pulls a face before exaggeratedly hefting it up and into his arms.
Daily, he visits Peggy.
The celebrations are over, and those who do not reside at the compound have finally departed. Thor, the last to leave earlier that morning, had promised that he would return in a timely manner after checking in on New Asgard and ensuring their prosperity.
“Do I need to cut you off?” Tony asks, sincere but winking, and Steve’s getting whiplash.
And then Howard meets Maria, and Steve remembers what it’s like to breathe.
The box looms, fancy and over-large in a way that makes it impossible to guess what’s inside, considering he doesn’t remember ordering anything larger than a replacement pack of razor blades recently. Not to mention, he rarely orders anything to the office, mostly because his desk is only one amongst a sea and the lobby is usually manned by at least several relatively competent security guards at all hours of the day. The color of the ribbon is vaguely familiar, a nice rich blue against the goldenrod of the box and obstructing the black of a logo, but that’s hardly a valid clue.
Tony pauses. “Are you worried you might burn Stark Tower to the ground?”
“No,” Steve says emphatically, because just - no. Absolutely not. “I can’t tell you what to do, but I’m not going, and this really doesn’t seem like a puke-and-rally situation to me.”
Somehow, they’ve figured this out. It feels a little like a bubble, but Steve realizes that he isn’t waiting for it to pop. There’s no other shoe to drop, and when he slides into the water because the heat bearing down on him is making his head swim a little, he holds his breath and stays under for as long as it takes to convince himself not to drag Tony up to their room and ravish him six ways to Sunday.
“San went to change,” he explains, and Tony pulls a face at the smell but Steve just pulls Buck in for a swift hug. “Thank fuck, who got the coffee started?”
He can’t force Tony to do anything, but there’s a certain kind of anger-melting beauty in taking what he wants.
Steve cannot answer that. Not without coloring Tony’s perspective in a way that he has no right to.
He’s still holding his latte, he remembers, only he’s adjusted to accommodate Tony, which means that the inside of his left arm is all pressed up against Tony’s side, half under the flapping of his suit jacket. There are too many clothes, he thinks desperately as Tony opens his mouth to allow for the ordinarily objectionable Eau-de-coffee breath to waft up and momentarily interrupt the salon-garbage-wind smell, except that thought is all wrong because there are just as many clothes as there should be.
Eventually they move on. Tony wants to know why he stayed away, and Steve answers as respectfully as he can without lying. He makes sure to look Tony in the eye as he talks and feels the bands around him become one again, the pressure lessening almost instantly as Tony listens.
“Well if you remember, feel free to come talk to me about it,” Steve says, and
Steve just gestures to his beer and doesn’t point out the fact that the fog of the large room isn’t purely from tobacco, or that they’ve been drinking for hours upon hours now.
Tony settles further into his chair, scowling slightly, but there’s something good-natured about it that makes Steve smile.
She holds his hand, and he takes great care not to squeeze too hard.
Tony waves his hands around as he goes for the coffee machine. “Not at all. I didn’t say I didn’t like it. Personally, I’m just surprised that you decided an activity involving a hot griddle warranted a shirt.”
Tony tips his head. His eyes are thoughtful, critical, and Steve refuses to allow himself to squirm. He keeps as steady as he can, pushing back the threatening panicked eruption until he can be alone.
Without everything, Tony might never become Iron Man.
Those icy fingers wrap around the wrist working its way to Tony’s hip, tight enough to demand attention. Steve can feel the rosy bloom as it works its way across his cheeks and blinks his eyes open, ready to joke about being the forward one for once, but instead is greeted with a carefully blank expression.
He stares at the blinking cursor on the desktop, rereading the last handful of words he’s written instead of allowing himself to associate the phrase with the words Pierce had once spoken to him.
“You’re looking at my new home,” Tony says with an almighty shrug, casting a glance around them. “Does it look wrecked to you?”
, Rogers.”
It makes Tony’s throat go tight with emotion. It’s overly sentimental for them, and if he were a braver man, he’d like to think he’d duck under Steve’s extended limb and cuddle in close. He wants to rest his weary head for the first time in a very long time, wants to feel Steve stroking through his hair until he drifts off into a dreamless sleep. Maybe it’s the near-death experience of it all, an ominous prophecy nearly coming to fruition, but if there was ever a time to show Steve how he feels, now would be it.
“That’s a very generous offer,” he begins haltingly, and Tony is shaking his head before he can finish.
“Maybe,” she says, but it doesn’t feel ominous, and when he goes under again, he doesn’t worry about whether he will see her again.
Some trivia for you: research shows that the official MCU timeline puts Tony's kidnapping on Friday the Thirteenth. Which is kinda cool, if you ask me.
But Tony is ignoring him, cackling in delight as he pushes out a service exit that opens out onto a small lot occupied by nondescript white service vans. The door is the kind that needs a key card to open from the outside, so Steve stands on the threshold and rests his hands on his hips to steady them. The last thing he needs is to get locked out.
“I’ve got you,” Steve tells him, and Tony doesn’t know how Steve is holding it together right now, and when he finally gathers himself enough to voice that thought, Steve gives a surprised and muted bark of laughter. “I’m not. You wanna hear something?”
Steve slips the piece of paper in his pocket, careful not to smudge the pencil.
From there he heads west, because any further south would be too far south. He stops on the side of the road to help two middle-aged women without a carjack change a flat tire. They thank him profusely, offer him snacks from the cooler they’ve packed for their trip into the mountains, and he accepts an apple while their baby babbles and blows spit bubbles from the safety of one of his mothers’ arms. What he does refuse is an offer of payment, despite their insistence that he’d saved them time and money. Steve doesn’t know how much a tow truck charges, but he climbs back on his bike after watching them merge back onto the highway.
“Tony,” Pepper says, a chastisement that lacks any real heat and instead reads just this side of fond. “You probably don’t remember, but this is - ”
Steve doesn’t answer him, though, not in the verbal sense. He just moves swiftly and assuredly, and that’s how Tony knows he means it and doesn’t end up instinctively scrambling away as Steve comes at him. There’s a warm and heavy touch at the back of his neck, firm but not forceful, and Steve positions himself precisely so that when he leans in, his lips land squarely on Tony’s.
“If someone wants you to stop being Iron Man, then fuck ‘em,” Steve says with so much conviction that it startles a laugh out of Tony.
Another fifteen minutes pass, and this time it’s Steve who speaks first.
“You wanted an article, sure, and I was more than happy to give you one. You were attractive and let me charm you, but you also let me toss your recorder and drew the line at skinny dipping while letting us pretend that we gave a fuck about those strippers, all while making it very clear that you weren’t in it to write about my excessive partying or how I’d abandoned my responsibilities.
“I know,” Steve says, and the creeping embarrassment in his voice is overladen with thick affection. Tony has no idea how he was hiding that for however long he did. “I just - you have to promise not to judge.”
“So do I, kiddo,” Tony says, extending a palm for a high five that Alexa returns. “Besides. He doesn’t have the patience for this kind of precision work.”
“I did give us two options,” Tony reminds him. “That’s why I’m asking if you think it’s weird. If you think it has anything to do with us.”
Steve ignores the precisely-engineered indifference dripping from his tone.
“I could drop her at Pepper’s,” Tony says. “Or we could go to the beach.”
“Any party poopers will not be invited,” Tony decides. “And you’ve been toeing a thin line, Cap, so tread carefully if you don’t want to get left behind.”
But like many times before, when it comes to Tony, he knows he doesn’t get to stay.
Steve looks around, startled, but doesn’t see anyone else in the vicinity who might even remotely resemble the generous description. It’s mostly stuffy suit types, anyway. Not a whole lot of visible triceps - Grecian or otherwise, whatever the hell that means  - to be spotted, honestly.
motion, and Steve smothers a bark of a laugh with a cough in the fist of his hand. Tony leans in with his familiar smile, elbow reaching for the table Steve’s been standing at for the better part of twenty minutes and missing, the pointy bit slipping. This time Steve really does bark out a laugh, and Tony just takes it all in stride, trying again and succeeding in nonchalantly posturing with his back to nearly the entire room.
“If we run into each other again…”
“I've got a room?”
“I love you, too,” he tells her, soft, and the words come out far more emotional than he means them to.
“Is that what you want right now?”
It’s a balm, to be gripped like Tony needs the contact as much as he does.
“You made coffee?” he demands, wounded. “And didn’t give me any? You didn’t even
It’s all he can do to nod in response.
Pepper drops Morgan off in time for dinner, and Steve relaxes.
Steve runs the tap to rinse the sink and washes his hands. When he’s done, Tony is facing him while looking lean and ready to pounce, both hands open and imploring. It’s a cue that it’s time to go.
“I don’t know what I’m doing,” he says, hit with an unexpected wall of emotion.
“Kinda my job,” Steve reminds him, and Tony bumps their forearms together. It’s bare skin-on-skin, and Steve shivers.
It’s his own voice, painfully optimistic and lost.
“Hey, Mister It’s-Within-Walking-Distance. You got a plan for getting all this back to the house?”
“I’m sixteen,” she says stubbornly, fishing fries out of the paper bag. “I’m not putting any money into your swear jar.”
” Tony says, and Steve catches him rolling his eyes, and hides his grin in his wine.
“There’s no way I would have missed that,” Tony says with a surety that he doesn’t quite feel, because there’s absolutely no reason for Steve to lie about this. The guy might be an uptight asshole most days, but he’s not a liar by any stretch of the imagination. “He knew me as a kid. I saw him during breaks from school. He and Peggy stayed with Jarvis the entire week of the funeral, for crying out loud. He doesn’t even look like - ”
“People get lonely, Bonnie,” he says, keeping his voice gentle and wondering how the hell parents deal with their teenagers. “Sometimes having someone else there helps. People need other people, whether they realize it or not. I forget that a lot. But Tony’s an old friend, and him being here reminded me.”
“Yes, and no,” Tony says, looking up to see Steve regarding him intently. “Maybe you started out the same, but life shapes us. Everywhere your life has diverged from his has changed you.”
It exudes life, choices made over years and years, little bits and pieces added here and there. There’s paint peeling by the back sliding doors, gray trim giving way to a brown that’s truly horrendous and eighties inspired. The picket fence is snow-white and new, made of that durable recycled material that’s everywhere nowadays, and Tony wonders when it was installed because he’s fairly certain it had been wooden before.
“Slow,” Tony tells him once he gets reoriented, working in and wishing he had an extra hand to pet at Steve’s temples where sweat is starting to build with the effort of keeping perfectly still this far into the game. “You’re okay. Just breathe, and let me go slow. We’re not in any rush here.”
“I’m sure he’s got his reasons,” he says diplomatically, sitting back down on the bench across from Tony.
He half expects fairies to twinkle in the air and a golden unicorn to appear in front of him. It’s that exact sort of mythical beauty, that which humans only fantasize about and never get to see, and it’s not at all what he expected. Knowing Tony, he’d expected a sudden steel monument to rise up high out of the ground in front of him, but this is different and nothing Steve would have guessed. It’s so similar to the meadow Steve had woken up in, with grasshoppers chirruping and a bubbling fountain that stands in the middle of a very miniature pond fed by thin rivulets coursing gently over rocks, and he suspects that Natasha’s demonstration has something to do with its existence.
“That was - that wasn’t a real offer, though,” Steve says, feeling far less confident than he tries to sound. “You asked because - you didn’t mean - ”
Tony looks at Steve, who is reflecting back the same incredulity layered with mild shame at being rebuked twice in such quick succession.
He does talk of Morgan, as his voice grows hoarse, as he tells Tony why he had gone to him after so many years, and it’s there that Tony truly interrupts him.
“Cosmos,” Rogers says flatly, mouth a thin line.
“Hey!” Clint crosses his arms across his broad chest and pouts, exactly like a teenager not getting their way. “I’m just saying.” He gestures lewdly, and Steve quickly lifts his eyes to the paneled ceiling. “Stark is attractive, Steve is attractive,
brings him back to his surroundings just as abruptly as he’d let them. He wrenches his thoughts away from Steve before failing miserably, and then sighs and reaches for his phone. His jeans are sticking slightly, the mid-Atlantic humidity just about as insufferable as any kind of weather gets, and extracting the device from his mysteriously tight pockets feels more like trying out for a contortionist circus act than an everyday task.
He gives Sam the shield, and doesn’t answer any questions.
“Yeah, I’m not so sure that’s a great idea,” Steve says, eyeing the circuitry. “I didn’t even understand when you explained the first time, so...”
he really needs to stop going down that road), Steve is forced to adjust the angle and pressure of his left arm to steady him. They’re not hugging, he tells himself firmly, they are absolutely not, because that would be ludicrous.
“Like this,” Natasha says, inclining her head and the noise is faint at first, but then grows stronger until Steve can hear the babbling of a small brook, mere dribbles of water running parallel to their path. He can see it through the trees every here and there, and as they walk onward, he can sense it widening into a small stream.
“Did you come here just to not apologize?”
“It’s alright if you do,” Tony says in that same way. “Just try and do me a favor if you can, yeah?”
“In 117 countries,” Steve says proudly from where his torso is fit between Tony’s legs, and it’s worth the shocked expression he gets in return.
“I didn’t mean to scare you off,” Tony says, slightly too late as Rogers turns to leave.
He stops first, to pause the recording and slip his phone into his pocket. It’ll be awkward, he reasons, trying to operate his phone in a group of people, and he’s got a more-than-sufficient memory anyway.
“C’mon,” Tony wheedles, faceplate snapping up. “Anyone else in the world would kill for this opportunity.”
“What did I do?” he asked, his tone hushed, bordering on reverent.
Steve nods.
“Oh, I know,” Tony calls back, not bothering to avert his eyes from where Steve is fully stripping out of the top half of his suit and his undershirt, poking at his wounds to make sure the bleeding has stopped before pulling on a gray t-shirt. “You know, most people would clean the blood off first. You know, just because it’s the sanitary thing to do.”
Tony swallows, scanning Steve from head to toe, because he knows that if he doesn’t do it now, he’ll be too distracted later on to catalogue it properly. His hair is a disaster zone, courtesy of both Tony and the pillows, and every inch of his body seems primed for this. From the rosiness making its way down his neck to his chest, to the leaking tip of his velvet-hard cock, it’s vulnerability stripped down to its bare bones.
“Is that why you haven’t settled down yet?” He does his best to keep his tone light, curious.
Tony chuckles.
It shouldn’t come as a surprise that Rogers is hardest to convince to take up residence at Stark Tower. He’s been resisting it the longest, and only gives in once Natasha convinces him that Tony is one of the better landlords in the five boroughs.
“It’s just Steve, now,” he says, and they shake hands while Carol pulls tequila out of seemingly nowhere.
“I think you’d be a good dad,” Steve offers, and it’s almost a compliment, and Tony grimaces.
“I know,” he says, just as unnecessary. “But you and I’ve only really spent time together under more structured circumstances, so to be invited here in the first place was unexpected.” He shakes his head. “I thought you’d want to meet at a restaurant or a hotel bar. Or the Tower, even. I didn’t really think you’d invite me out here.”
“What
“Don’t be,” Tony says, and he’s so dismissive that Steve’s confused. “She’s been a good sport through it all, didn’t try to bury me in legal fees or a custody battle. We juggle Morgan around like a little hot potato, but it works, and she’s not demanding to see a therapist yet, so I figure we’re doing alright.”
“It wasn’t long after I visited you,” Tony says, uncharacteristically outwardly contemplative. “After I found out who you really are. I put the pieces together, and you told me to find something to live for. I started hiring contractors, Pepper found out, and we decided to end things.”
“Rhodey!” Tony says, all exaggerated delight, and Steve hates that he can gauge how genuine Tony being at almost any given time. “Where’ve you been all night?”
“Yeah,” he relents, because they seem harmless and he’s never been very good at saying no.
“You’re not working right now.”
But he just shakes his head, keeping his face blank.
“It wasn’t the being dead that I had a problem with,” Tony sighs out as they walk down a long hall, lined on one side by more seamless glass that looks out onto a courtyard. Some sort of grand tree sits in the corner, and Steve admires the small white flowers dotting the greenery. “It was an afterlife that I couldn’t wrap my head around. I was never much for religion, you could probably guess. I just thought you lived and then you died, and that was that. Never thought about anything coming after, you know?”
“Jarvis says he wouldn’t ask if it were anything else,” she says steadily as she looks him in the eye. “But Ana is in the hospital, and Howard and Maria are in California.”
“Bold of you to assume you’ll be around that far into the future, Rogers,” Tony retorts, but Steve can hear the fondness in his tone.
Elliot and Elizabeth are fifteen-year-old twins, he learns.
“Steve,” Tony demands, and Steve shrugs in surrender.
“Also,” she adds after a beat during which he stops to stare at what used to be a vegetable patch, the soil moist but barren as though someone had forgotten to plant the next round of crops. “Don’t forget. You guys just went through something pretty monumental. It’s okay for you to need him to be there for you, too.”
true, because who wouldn’t kill for the opportunity?), and most days he’s content to try and spin celebrity think pieces into written windows into the human psyche and examine the devastating impact fame has on individuals.
“Ah, yes,” he says, as Steve rolls his eyes and faces the water. “Remind me again - how many times did you lie on your enlistment forms? Because I think they’re opening a new exhibit, and I just wanted to personally fact check a few - hey!”
“I know.”
“Just take it easy for a few days,” Steve says, still staring, and Tony knows he’s feeling guilty at having roped them into all of this, but the truth is that they all want to be here. Even Bruce, who has better control over his transformations than ever before, and Thor, who despite originally only signing on to retrieve Loki’s scepter, has come to enjoy sporadically residing in the Tower just as much as Tony would have predicted.
Steve doesn’t even have to think about it.
“Yeah,” Steve agrees, and then he twice pats the empty stretch of thin mattress beside him. It’s a small motion but it holds the weight of the universe, and Steve’s heart pounds away in double-time.
“Sorry,” Serena says, with an innocent smile. “But it’s late!”
Steve lowers his glass.
He doesn’t think he’s aging much, if at all. He needs the least amount of sleep in the house, so he stays on the pull-out couch downstairs. The house isn’t huge but it has five bedrooms and works exactly the way they need it to and he wonders how Tony knew. It takes a while to settle in but it feels like a home the entire time, and Steve smiles as he helps Elliot with precalculus and holds Serena while she watches cartoons.
“Yes,” Steve says carefully. “We used to work together.”
It takes a very long time for him to break the surface, and when he does, he catches Tony looking at him. There’s no concern in his expression; he just looks irrefutably enamored, and really, it’s nothing short of incredible.
“Sometimes I say shit,” Tony says dismissively.
“Uh,” he says, forcing an awkward laugh. “Maybe you don’t know this, but usually saying something like that precedes some very bad news that the other person is definitely not going to want to hear.”
It stings, but it’s not untrue.
Steve can’t remember what he’d been so scared of in the first place.
“I’m not,” Steve starts, the words all in his head but jumbled, and he has to shift them around like rectangular hipster fridge magnets until they form a cohesive sentence. “I don’t think this is a good idea.”
“Nah, you’re good,” Steve says, rising automatically. “I’ll wash, just leave the mug in the sink.”
Steve rotates his wrist, long fingers skimming the inside of Tony’s wrist before sliding up his palm and weaving their fingers together. It’s impossible not to stare, and despite the muggy weather, goosebumps spread up Tony’s bare forearms.
“Everything is only what we want it to be,” Steve summarizes.
Steve laughs and tells her yes, then to hold on. He pumps his arms back to Tony as fast as he can, Morgan screaming the entire time.
“No. Store brand is cheaper, though.”
Tony doesn’t hold back a grimace. “Like getting the other you to his universe and back without ripping him in half?”
“You should go,” Steve says, pointing with his coffee-holding hand at the flow of traffic in front of them. “Your lady says you’ve got a meeting to get to.”
This is nothing short of breathtakingly lovely.
“Did happen,” Steve insists. “Were you even actually a physics major?”
There are so many of them. Thor is in deep conversation with the space cowboy, Vision and Wanda are sharing the loveseat, but the one person Tony really wants to see isn’t anywhere to be found amongst the victors. He wants to climb back upstairs and call it a night, sleep through the daylight until he regains the energy to join the waking world once more, but everyone wants to shake his hand or pat him on the back.
What matters is that he’d said no in the back of that limo an eon ago, and that Tony is saying no now, and it’s his turn to responsibly respect that.
Steve smiles in a way that feels wry, mischievous, and he feels much younger all of a sudden.
“Unless you’re expecting me to drive us back to the compound for the night,” he continues, hefting himself up and making sure he hasn’t gotten dirt on him, “we need to figure out what we’re doing. Because I want food, a bed, and a shower sometime in the near future.”
Tony blinks. Steve doesn’t elaborate, and Tony pointedly blinks again.
He bites his tongue instead of telling her how she makes him long for the days when his biggest work annoyance was Natasha forcing him to fetch her coffee in exchange for her not hoarding every baked food that came through the doors. While he lifts the substantial ribbon off the double-weighted box, Christine taps her nails against her hip where they perch.
He might have the same expressive eyes, the same name, the same wild tuft of dark hair, but he’s not Steve’s Tony. It’s almost painful to hold him, to let the bend of his arm support the tiny newborn and know that no matter what happens, no matter how the decades unfold, he will never be his Tony.
“The cosmos,” he remembers. “Harmony, within the universe.”
Steve knows it’s not meant to be an innuendo of any kind - hell, Pepper is
Tony does the math and promptly winces.
“Fajitas for dinner,” Rhodes says, indicating the chopped onion and peppers on a cutting board. “Welcome back, Captain.”
“Then why’d you ask me to give it back?” Tony asks, and he goes to wave the frame around but changes his mind at the last second, wrist jerking until he’s back to cautiously framing it with his fingertips.
Steves exhales, his breath crystalline in the cold, and he feels warm. He presses their foreheads together, gathers her into an embrace, and exhales again.
“I can’t leave these kids,” he says, and it’s not an excuse, and Tony must see that because his expression softens. It’s nearly dark now, the angles of Tony’s face transformed into gentle lines. “But like I said. I’ve always left it up to you. All you have to do is be straight with me.”
“Darling,” she says, rasping and weak. “I know.”
“So where I was - ”
he’d received a lifetime ban before being dragged outside by whoever Happy’s latest replacement had been.
He can’t help but sob, feeling so constricted with fear that it’s a miracle that he manages to let out any sound at all.
Beth sits in the front seat, feet kicked up on the dash as Steve drives. She’s been restless all day and Tony is busy trying to play nice for some investors, so Steve had suggested milkshakes and fries and a night drive.
“Tony.” He’s too short, not willing to tolerate Tony’s cleverly disguised avoidance now that the cat is out of the bag. There’s no point in playing it safe anymore. “I don’t think we should see each other again.”
“Oh!” Steve cries out, and he’s so utterly present that Tony wants to shout, wants to make sure some abstract power out there knows that only he gets Steve like this. “Oh, Tony - ”
“Just focus on being here,” she says, and they keep on to whatever destination she has in mind. “We’ll work on it later, but it can be difficult at first. Tony bounced around between some fifty-odd locations at first because he couldn’t focus properly.”
“Yes,” Steve says, like they’re on the same page, which they most definitely are
“You owe me creamer,” he says, once his coffee is an ugly beige and he’s taken an evaluating sip.
“It’s perfectly safe.” Tony is attempting to cajole him, even as Steve rests his hands on his waist and shakes his head. “Unless you’re prone to motion sickness, in which case I ask that you give a guy a little warning, because I might not be a sympathy vomiter but the joints are pretty delicate and - ”
“Yeah,” Steve says, almost pityingly. Tony thinks he understands.
“I wasn’t sure,” Steve says, and he’s so rarely unsure that Tony needs to put a stop to it right this instant.
For a moment, Rogers looks like he’s second-guessing himself, but then his resolve hardens.
“They only managed it because I helped them cheat,” Steve says quietly when the initial relief and exhilaration has worn off and Tony’s body is sagging despondently. “We wouldn’t have been able to, Tony. It wasn’t just one thing I did for them. Maybe it was one thing at first, but at the end, I told them exactly what needed to happen so they couldn’t lose.”
“I like this one,” Tony responds instantly, and he’s edging around the circular table too quickly, bumping up against Steve’s side like a wildfire. “Steve’s barely even really a journalist - more of a friend, at this point.”
The sheets are damp against Steve’s temple, and when he blinks, a fractionary sheen of a teardrop blurs what little vision he’s got left in the dark of the room.
“No,” Steve says, his tongue suddenly too big and foreign in his mouth. “You’re not.”
No version of Steve has ever let anything be easy, and Tony loves him for it.
“Come on.”
“Joe. I’m like, ninety percent sure that’s his name.”
“You know what?” Tony says, squinting at the house in front of him. “I don’t understand you at all.”
“It’s going to be strange not to have him around,” he says, stifling the declaration threatening to crawl out of his mouth. “Just as I was getting used to him.”
“This one,” Steve says before he can talk himself out of it.
“Yeah,” Steve says, and he’s just as choked up as Tony is. “I asked him before he left, if I could tell you.”
“We did it, Cap,” Tony had said, faceplate melting away as an eerie silence and stillness descended upon them. “Thor killed him, and Danvers destroyed the gauntlet.”
the ticker reads. There’s some debate about the practicalities of using federal resources to put together a search and rescue mission for a civilian with essentially unlimited access to private resources, a scathing comment on how Stark Industries has yet to put out a statement accompanying speculation on how this will affect the stock market, and an announcement that there will be more after the break.
Tony’s mouth presses into a grim line, and Steve prefers his laugh lines.
“As you so helpfully pointed out a moment ago,” Tony drawls, “I’m all for accountability.”
“Who’s there?” he asks.
But Tony hugs him goodbye, and Steve holds him close, and the bands seem to fall away. He can breathe. It’s amazing how the panic recedes, how the anxiety ebbs away until he stands up and feels at peace.
And at first, it is.
“No.” Steve doesn’t think about it for even a split second, and he’s tight but not the rigid kind of scared that Tony had been worst-case-scenario prepared for.
Because he knows in his soul that this Tony will suffer the same as his Tony.
can afford to.”
And then he comes back, furious and right out of the hospital with stitches still marring his pretty face, and Steve forces him to sit down and be quiet before he wakes Peggy.
“I’m surprised they haven’t already,” Tony comments. “With how long he’s been here, you’d think some would have thought of him by now.”
Steve sets his personal phone down on the desk, grips the landline, and shifts the mouthpiece far enough away that he can exhale in conflicted frustration while parsing through what an appropriate reply might sound like.
Steve hums. “And the other option?”
They don’t talk about anything serious, and Steve thinks about what he’d give to share a bed with Tony again. He wonders if the universe hears him, because Tony asks what he’s doing the last week in March.
“Are you seriously insinuating - ” He starts, ready to deny, deny, deny, but she just clicks her tongue at him and grins like the cat who caught the canary.
“What the hell did you two talk about?” Natasha asks, amused.
“You spooked him,” Steve says, tracking its retreat.
Rogers is a grown man, Tony decides savagely, as he swipes a jam-and-brie canape from a passing tray. He can handle himself.
“I know, darling,” she tells him, and he can picture her tucking him in, smoothing the covers over his tiny body. “She should be back tomorrow.”
“You shouldn’t give me more than you can afford to.”
Steve feels something crumble inside of him, a melancholy surrender that tastes like rich blue and sounds like his insides ballooning up until they’re stretched to their limits and ready to pop, all beautifully iridescent and bubble-like. He just hopes they don’t explode all over Tony’s laboratory floor; he’d hate to mess with Tony’s progress on the engine.
He could do it now, the suggestive voice in his head whispers. He could ask Steve if he’d be willing to take a chance on him, could press Steve up against the hall wall and pull his lips down to meet his, could slam their hips together and -
“Too far, Everhart,” he says, shaking his head. “Too far.”
A week after that, he’d been contacted by Vanity Fair, asking him to come and interview.
Tony blinks.
“I’m picking up the tab, if that’s the problem,” Tony says, gesturing to the abundance of food between them.
“That’s all I wanted to say,” he says, lamely. “Just...thank you.”
hovering just in front of his mouth. “You don’t have to tell me.”
“Steve. Tell me I’m not the reason you’re taking a break,” he demands.
Well. In for a penny, in for a pound, he figures.
Steve sighs, and nearly runs a hand through his hair again before stopping at the last second, opting to run the heel of his hand over the bare patch of skin high on his cheek.
There’s so much that he can barely wrap his mind around it when he’s like this, muscles pliant beyond his control. Memories of conflict flash through his head like they’re on a movie reel, someone’s finger glued to the fast forward button. Every argument they’ve ever had, every unkind word, all the times they’d been apart and Steve had thought of Tony while wondering if Tony was thinking of him too.
Are you secretly working for the CIA or something?” a crystal-clear voice demands down the line, and Steve accidentally jerks his hand, sending almonds all over his keyboard and lap. “Because unless you’re working for the CIA, there’s no justifiable reason that would explain why it’s damn near impossible to get ahold of you.”
“He went back,” Steve reminds him, effortlessly coaxing Tony to fullness with evenly paced strokes. “Maybe they’re not done.”
He brushes his hands together, shedding any lingering dust, and pokes around the built-ins flanking the fireplace. There’s nothing to be found, not that he’s looking for anything in particular, and once he determines that there’s nothing to be seen aside from the bare-bones furniture, he moves towards the kitchen. It looks exactly as he remembers, which is eerie and comforting at the same time. The water works and the electricity is still running, which is good to know. Poking around in the refrigerator and cabinets turns up absolutely nothing besides a few boxes of baking soda and stray sugar packets, and Tony can’t help but frown.
Goddamn friends who knew how to get under his skin and important men who kissed like there was nothing else in the world that mattered.
“I’d think the better question is ‘why.’”
It takes a moment to take stock of the middle-aged suburban woman on the sidewalk across the street, clearly coming out of the open garage behind her. Tony sloppily wipes his mouth with the back of his hand before raising it high, waving obnoxiously.
They see Howard less and less as Stark Industries soars to unprecedented heights, and then Tony gets shipped off to boarding school. Occasionally there is a holiday and Steve will politely steer clear, but as adolescence approaches, Tony understandably grows grumpier and less eager to associate with his father’s old colleagues, and there’s no need to be careful. Peggy sends birthday gifts every year, and Steve breathes as easily as he can as the eighties close out and then Tony turns twenty-one.
and there’s stuff about ethics in his chosen profession swirling around his suddenly gooey brain. It takes all he’s got to shake his head, because even if he knows that it means nothing, that Tony loves to flirt like he loves to fly and save lives, his body refuses to get the memo. There’s a too-warm rush down his front, swirling around his navel, and he isn’t some newbie anymore, he should be better than this, better than falling for Tony’s well-practiced tactics and tendency to harmlessly seduce at least half the people he comes across.
“Coming from you, that means a lot.”
Despair claws at the circumference of Steve’s throat, and he wonders what Tony really believes: that he’d saved the world, or that he’d nearly destroyed it. He doesn’t see how they can exist simultaneously, how any one person can live with those conflicting viewpoints without going mad. He clears his throat so he doesn’t end up blurting all of that out. What he wants to say is something about how clearly public opinion is still in his favor enough to warrant a person of the year award, but when he speaks, what comes out is what he’s been wondering for a week.
A blow to the stomach is what wakes him the second time. He’s bleary-eyed but snaps to attention immediately, and Serena is scrambling off of him as Josie yells at her.
“The magazine dresses me every year,” Steve says, and maybe he’s being stubborn, but the thought of looking at the black-edged blue again is enough to make him nauseous. “I don’t need to own a tux I’ll never wear again.”
From there it just grows, and he grows used to it. The back of his neck and his arms gradually turn tan under the beating sun as fall stretches on, October just as brutal as September had been. The kids gather in small crowds as he crouches down, sweeping curves and sketching out sharp lines. He thought they’d find it traumatic, but kids are resilient and call out what they want to see next.
Denise has a head full of plaits that show off how young she is. She would’ve still been a kid when it all happened, and he tries not to think about it. About how she probably lost her parents, about how he’s pretty sure the whispering kids behind her are her younger siblings, and how it makes him sick to his stomach.
Steve looks away.
“Yeah?” he asks, motivated to drive onward urgently. “Talk to me, is that it?”
There’s no one else around them, not at Caesar’s private pool, no one except for Tony’s bodyguard who manages to be both discreet and good at his job, as evidenced by the way he’d easily slotted himself between Tony and a mob of paparazzi in the casino earlier. No one else is in the vicinity and Steve knows it, because it feels like Tony is the only other person who matters, who
“You should get out of the way.” Tony repeats in an aimless slur, sliding his hand higher up the threshold before taking a single wobbling step forward. “I need the sink. I think I’m gonna be - ”
This time he brings himself up short, not giving Tony the opportunity to cut him off again. He can’t stop thinking that he’s been under the impression that maybe he’d mattered, only now he’s finding that the gift had likely been some warped manifestation of guilt and the granted interview a misdirected investment in Steve’s future. It’s clear now, how little he’d mattered to Tony all along, only it’s not all adding up and it’s making Steve’s head hurt.
“I wouldn’t dream of it,” Steve promises. “I won’t let you regret me, not again.”
“You’re going to be mad at me,” he says, a laugh bubbling up in the back of his throat because it’s so absurd, the story he’s about to tell. “You’re going to be so mad.”
He doesn’t let Carol top them off as everyone gradually gets up, and goes their separate ways.
if you can eat an entire order by yourself.”), and rapid-fire inquiries (“Did you really think I didn’t know your mother’s maiden name and the street you grew up on before I met you the first time around? I do my research. I can’t
“Oh,” he says dumbly.
“Knew you’d be a good kisser,” Steve mumbles distantly, almost like he’s not aware that he’s saying it, and Tony just nips at his lips and goes ahead and works the third finger in without ever getting an answer. It’s worth it, for how Steve practically whines into the kiss, the rough vibrations a satisfying counterpoint to the smooth drag of Tony gliding in and out.
It’s insane, Steve tells himself. Tony probably doesn’t even realize, probably has no idea how flirtatious he’s been. Between the touches and the glances, Steve’s been reading into this all too much.
For a moment, Tony’s face goes stormy and stoic at the same time. Steve thinks maybe he’s reading the room wrong, that he’s fucked up and taken things too far and crossed another kind of line in his inappropriate drunkenness.
She doesn’t sound nearly as surprised as he’d like. If anything, she sounds bored, but maybe that’s just the exhaustion. It better be just the exhaustion, because his current predicament is anything but boring.
So Tony just offers up a tired smile.
(“He might need it,” Steve had said, gaze focused on the platform before them. “What if he turns young again?”
Steve doesn’t even bat an eye.
He presses the handset closer to his ear. “Tony?”
Tony sighs unnecessarily heavily.
“I'm going to be a superhero,” Tony informs Peggy, smiling with crumbs sticking to his mouth. “Just like Captain America in the comics.”
“Uh.” Caught off guard, Steve points in the direction of the maintenance hall he’d seen the beginnings of a few minutes prior. “Somewhere that way, I think. Why?”
Tony calls him not long after.
“Rhodes is a good one,” Steve says eventually. “Keep him around, yeah?”
Miraculously, gratefully, Tony does understand why Steve stayed away.
“Because believe it or not, I don’t love it when you make fun of me,” Steve says, and Tony frowns, eyes drifting to where Steve’s ass is high in the air as he reaches under the desk to grab a few straggling pencils and paper clips.
“Wanda offered,” Steve admits, the nerves coming back.
“Tell me something,” he requests. “Anything.”
“He’s going to want to see her, you know.”
“I would not have called had I believed there to be a better alternative,” Jarvis says, and Peggy crouches to lift a sleeping Tony off a hospital recliner and into her arms.
Steve’s brows furrow. “Separation?”
“You don’t have to explain,” Tony says, and he’s kind, brushing off the weird not-quite-full-blown panic with the gentle ease of someone who’s experienced much worse, and Steve aches sharply with gratitude. “They’re a lot, I know.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, confused. “Okay.”
Tomorrow, Steve decides. He’ll stop letting himself want that tomorrow.
It’s not that late, Steve thinks, as he rubs the sleep out of his eyes and rubs a hand over Serena’s head. He gets up and takes in the usual morning chaos, lost for how he managed to sleep through as much as he did, but then stops in his tracks.
They spend a couple of days like that, lazy and dragging on in the best way. Steve helps Morgan drop blueberries into pancakes, letting her sit on the counter even as Tony gripes about how she should be standing on a stool instead. The three of them are content to drift in time, but then Morgan gets restless and whines about Disneyland.
“Glad we’re on the same page about that,” Tony says. “I’ll be alright. Shit like this - keeps us humble, you know?”
As hard as some of them had partied after defeating Thanos, Tony just remembers a lot of sleeping and conferencing in with T’Challa and various world leaders. He can imagine that Steve’s week resembled his pretty closely, only with shorter periods of unconsciousness.
“As if you’re one to talk,” Steve says, because while Bucky might be rocking a more cropped cut now, there’s photographic evidence of previous hairstyles.
“Do I think what?” Steve asks, and Tony’s biting his lip like he’s not sure how to put it into words, so Steve tries to do it for him. “Do I think that it’s fate that I lived a whole life in another universe and yet still ended up here with you?”
“You mean when I first became Iron Man?” Tony clarifies. “Probably because of Sokovia. They passed over me after the Battle of New York, but I only saved a city then.” He shoots Steve a funny look that might pass for a smile under normal circumstances. “If it had landed as intended, the impact could have destroyed the planet. Without me, and to a lesser extent, Rhodey, who knows if we’d be here today?”
“I can handle it,” Steve says, because Tony might not have shared this thought with him, but Steve knows him well enough to know that he’s been thinking it anyway. “As long as I get there.”
“Excuse me?”
“Yeah,” she says. “But, uh - ”
Tony pulls a face and takes a pull of beer. “People take pictures,” he says, so casually that Steve has to look for the slight downwards turn of his mouth to detect his displeasure. “And normally I wouldn’t mind, but she’s my kid. And you're….”
It makes Tony’s heart clench, and he squeezes back.
And she gives Steve a meaningful glance before stalking off to join everyone else.
This world is the one he gets to stay in, permanently, in all of its blazing glory, and that’s nothing short of a goddamn miracle after everything he’s been through.
“What’s funny?”
“To what, give me shit?” Tony says in mock-outrage. “I can make your life very difficult, I’ll have you know.”
“Nothing,” Tony says, but he’s grinning, and Steve can’t resist momentarily separating their hands to feel around Tony’s hip, to stroke over his shirt right above the waistband.
“We’ll never know what really happened,” Steve says again, exponentially more heartbreaking than it had been the first time he’d said it because
“Want to tell me about it?”
“Don’t stop on my account,” Tony says, voice gravelly as he indicates for her to continue. It feels good to get off his feet, and he’s got half a mind to kick his shoes off and fall asleep right where he is.
“Don’t do that,” Steve says, now shaking his own head. “That’s not the problem. You touched me yesterday and I was fine. And then I touched you, and it wasn’t. Just…” He doesn’t know how to tell Tony that he doesn’t need to deflect like that, not with him, except for all Tony’s bared to him all the years, Steve’s rarely - if ever - shown him an iota of vulnerability in return. The thought doesn’t sit right, and Steve swallows again before inhaling long and raggedly. “Quid pro quo.”
That, though, he thinks he can apologize for. So he does, stammering through the whole thing as if he doesn’t have conversations with people for a living, and he tells himself to get a grip.
“I’ll be there when I’m needed,” he says, because he’s had years to think about this, and he’s fairly sure he’s pinpointed the moment he can change things.
“I’m in D.C. with Steve.”
They move to D.C. for SHIELD. The distance from the Starks does them good, and Peggy travels less. She is a saint, Steve thinks, when one day late in June he weeds the garden he’d started shortly after the move. He wipes sweat off his forehead and leans against the white picket fence, aware that he’s being watched from the window. This summer is shaping up to be a particularly warm one, wet enough that he barely needs to water the cosmos flowers, climbing high and flowering magenta-red and pale orange and sunny yellow.
Steve finds the convention center downtown and parks his bike, staring. There’s nothing to indicate what the building is being used for, but he glances at the newspaper in hand to confirm he’s in the place in the accompanying photo. He holds it up, comparing, and just as he’s decided to approach, a young woman pokes her head out of a pair of doors.
“I’m having a hard time keeping my hands to myself when you do things like this, okay?” Tony says, indicating the small of his back for clarification. “So pick a side and stay on it. Either we make out like a couple of teenagers whose parents will be home any second, or you kiss me like you
It must be answer enough, as Steve encourages him with every little movement and noise. He’s more responsive than Tony would have dared to hope for and it’s sexy in a way Tony hadn’t anticipated, watching Steve react to him. They’re a little all over the place and Tony knows synchronicity will come with time, he’s not worried about it. Besides, it’s hotter like this, the lack of a choreographed routine keeping him on his toes and entirely focused on the unadulterated sensations.
She leaves then, but it takes at least ten minutes after the clicking of her heels has faded for Steve to summon the strength to place the lid back on the box and get back to work. He ends up staring at the computer monitor for the better part of the next few hours without really getting anything done, mostly just spell-checking his work and reading the bits that Christine has contributed.
Tony comes close, and just as Steve thinks he is about to continue his path of figure-eights, he falters.
Pierce turns truly ugly for a moment before his face smooths out into something a little more diplomatic, but the damage is done.
There are so many palm trees. Steve tries not to stare in awe, but there’s something about being alongside the ocean that makes his insides feel inflated with helium.
“You wouldn’t,” Steve says, and his hand wraps around Tony’s as best as it can, and Tony is forced to let go of his leg. Steve just pulls it closer to his front, proof of his peak-of-perfection flexibility, and tries to pull Tony closer as well.
“You don’t have to stay with us,” she tells him. “Just because you landed here, it doesn’t mean this is where you have to be. There are other people you can go see.” She pauses, and then adds, “Our feelings will be hurt, but we’ll get over it. It would be nice of you to come back eventually, though.”
It’s the confidence boost he needs, the assurance he’s been lacking ever since he’d been bowled over by Tony’s presence, and he heads to Pierce’s office ready to present him with what he dares to think could potentially be a final draft.
Steve watches the ever-changing lines of the body he’s studied over the years, and it all comes back to him with no effort at all. He aches with love, so much of it stored inside but too timid to try and find an outlet. Tony is beautiful, and Steve is in love, and he wishes it could be that simple.
“Do you think we can set up a reserve program?” Tony asks, even though they’re hardly in any shape to be discussing this currently. “So I don’t have to fully retire?”
Christine had been right. Steve had never been able to bear the idea of being another notch on his bedpost.
“Damn,” Tony says, and he smacks the tube against his palm, enjoying the way Steve is scratching at the dark sparse hairs littering his kneecap. “I must have been way off my game to completely miss this.”
Steve jumps, pen clattering on the floor as he curses under his breath and twirls around in his seat to see Christine being trailed by a courier carrying a very large box adorned with a very large bow.
“But then I saw you,” he forges onward, “and I knew that I could not be in your life. I did not want to impose any expectations on you. In my universe, in my timeline, you died quite unexpectedly. I wasn’t ready for it, and there was a lot I would have liked to formally resolve that I never got the chance to. I didn’t want to inadvertently place any kind of expectations on you.”
“Right,” Steve repeats. “I’ll finish the Person of the Year piece, and that will be it.”
“You mean besides that fact that she refuses to call Earth home for more than a few days at a time?”
There aren’t adequate words to communicate what he’s thinking, and more importantly, he doesn’t think he can speak them anyway. To show his hand like that, expose how he’d been ready to go to bat for a man who can’t even be assed to defend himself, to be so fucking
Tony’s face suddenly reappears, and Steve hastily takes a too-large sip of gross reheated coffee.
“The shower here works just fine,” Steve says, jerking a thumb at the house, and it’s so typical of him that Tony’s look of disbelief is to be expected. “There’s still a bed, if you’re okay with that. Smells clean, like everything else in there.” He’s watching Tony closely, and suddenly shifts gears, shrugging and sliding on that veneer of imperturbability that he wears whenever he has to pretend that he’s not bothered by someone else sitting in his favorite spot on the couch. “Or we can find a hotel. It’s getting late, but there’s bound to be something. Might not be up to your standards, but it’s not like the house is either, so.”
Tony yanks Steve inside behind him, and it’s a credit to Steve’s compliance that he’s able to do so at all.
“It’s alright,” Bucky says with a shrug, and he hugs Steve goodbye. “Was good to see you. Don’t be a stranger.”
Steve stays at the compound, and the stones stay where they belong.
Steve kneels, pausing in making sure he’s gotten the last of the debris off the carpet.
“Now, Rogers,” he says, too calm, too practiced and confident. “You’re a bright kid. You could have a real nice future here, if you wanted. This has turned into the piece of a lifetime, you know that.”
The line goes quiet, and Steve’s phone buzzes. He checks Natasha’s reply -
Tony looks almost proud, for lack of a better word.
“He keeps asking to visit,” he tells her, and she nods.
The echo of Steve’s words is as hollow as can be.
“Don’t be sorry,” he tells her, lifting her hand to kiss it. “You’ve given me more than I could have ever asked for.”
“So no clues,” Fury says, as he lingers over the threshold. “Nothing. So far my universe has lined up exactly with yours, and I get squat out of you?”
“You do that,” Tony says, and he looks focused on his new task but Steve can tell he isn’t from the way his hand falters, a dead giveaway for where his attention truly lies.
“I’ll bring you one,” Steve tells Tony, and it’s the first they’ve spoken directly to each other, but the warmth on Tony’s face as he shoots him an appreciative look more than makes up for it.
“This is what’s been keeping you up at night,” she says, and it’s not a question. “You knew - you know.”
But Steve is already striding out of his office, blood boiling in his ears as he makes for his cubicle.
“How’d you know what Pierce was asking?” Steve feels like he’s losing the thread of conversation. Either Tony’s ability to make someone else feel like they’re drowning is contagious, or a very specific quality he looks for when hiring.
He never spins out very far from Steve’s orbit, even as he asks Laura for advice on how to deal with headstrong daughters and dares Peter to challenge Bucky to arm wrestle. By the time the food is ready, Steve feels sufficiently ogled and he’s gotten plenty of opportunities to study Tony’s backside. He dips his feet in the pool while he eats hot dogs and watermelon slices at Tony’s side, and lets himself be splashed by Clint’s youngest until he’s finally called out of the pool to be forced to eat something of substance.
Tony isn’t taking visitors besides Stane, and then he disappears into the bowels of the city. Steve worries and worries and Peggy refuses to talk to him, instead seeking Jarvis’ company and helping with the more private funeral arrangements. Only a very small group of them attend: Steve and Peggy, Tony and Rhodes, Jarvis, and Stane. Tony looks stoically miserable the entire time, eyes red and empty as he looks into the distance and refuses to allow anyone to touch him.
The arch to her brows feels like a challenge, and Steve sets out to make the best pitcher of margaritas anyone has ever seen.
Steve’s got the feeling that there’s been a lot of temporary placements in Tony’s life as of late.
Tony blinks, too stunned by the unexpected invitation to process it properly.
A past life. A life that never was. A life that never will be.
“I don’t know,” Steve says. “You could come visit.”
When they get back to the house, Josie looks at him funny all night. She doesn’t say anything until late, until the kids have gone up for the night and she’s unwrapping a pack of Hostess cupcakes from her secret stash.
“We,” Tony confirms.
Tony just looks at him. “Is that why you’re here? You couldn’t afford to give any more?”
“You know our history amounts to one profile piece and one drunken lapse in judgment,” Steve says, because he stopped being embarrassed about that night after the Oscars right around the time he realized that if he didn’t stop obsessing over what could have happened, he was going to drive himself insane.
He blinks, eyelids heavier than elephant tranquilizers.
“Thanks,” Tony says, blinking, after a few long seconds.
“Beth,” he sighs.
you changed?”
“Maybe what?” Tony asks, seemingly perturbed by the lack of opportunity to be reasonably belligerent.
Tony could only watch as she stepped inside the elevator, wiping tears from her face and asking JARVIS to call for a cab.
“Happy’s not my driver anymore.”
“You don’t need me now,” Steve says. “Sam and Buck and Rhodes - ”
This is a reminder that we know next to nothing about what's been going on in Tony's head, despite what judgments Steve passes and the conclusions he comes to.
Steve just waits until Tony’s done squirming around.
happened between him and Tony that night, nothing beyond some overly-familiar handsiness, he still knows how it must’ve looked, and at some point after the piece had gone viral but before Steve had forced himself to get rid of the lingering crush that he would deny even on his deathbed, he’d realized exactly why Pepper had been less than overeager when forced to deal with Steve the morning after.
(Not that at any point has Tony appeared sober enough to indicate that he would recognize Steve.)
“No snap,” Tony had said while letting the armor recede entirely back into the reactor and snatching Steve’s hand out of the air. Flesh on flesh, warm and pulsing and alive, with Tony’s pulse hammering in his ears despite the rising din of relief surrounding them. “We’re all still here.
That propels him onward.
“You gonna finally tell me how you’re doing?” Steve asks, thinking of how Tony’s evasive maneuvers have changed over the years.
“I’m never letting you help me move again,” Steve says, shaking his head.
“It didn’t win out the first time I asked you to take a look at the suit?” Tony asks, looking sideways.
“Yeah,” Steve says ineloquently, embarrassment winning out as Tony remains close, leaning forward with his elbows propped up on the table, chin in hand as he looks at Rhodes challengingly.
“What makes you think something is going on?” Steve asks, like he really wants to know.
“There wasn’t ever a whole lot of talking involved,” he says with intention, and then he sucks harder, bites just enough to draw a gasp from Steve, and can’t keep himself from smiling.
“When did you get so boring?” Tony asks as a black limousine makes an appearance in the lot. He’s apparently too entertained to pay it any attention, eyes fixed on Steve. “Seriously. When we first met, you were so much fun, and last time in New York you wouldn’t even - ”
Rogers comes by less than a month later, right on schedule.
Steve’s is a breath from the front door and in the middle of looking up taxi companies when he hears the click of five-inch heels approaching, and he whirls around so fast he feels the not-yet-dissolved tablets in his stomach threaten to violently eject themselves via esophageal escape route.
Steve hedges, primarily because he’s too busy being awestruck by the fact that Tony is caressing his face, dulled sensations be damned, but the pause is enough for Tony to laugh and cup Steve’s face preciously in the palm of his hands. If the man wasn’t so damn enchanting to begin with, Steve would be annoyed at being cooed over like a small child or baby animal. As it is, he just exhales and resigns himself to his fate for the millionth time.
Tony fidgets with one of new DUM-E’s joints, avoiding Steve’s eyes as he talks.
been inhumanly drunk, no matter how well he’d pretended otherwise. He hadn’t needed to send the tux along, but guilt
“He found me?”
His throat tightens unexpectedly as he catches the frame.
When he is finished weeping, he calls Rogers.
She fixes him with a look, and he thinks she’s buying it, but he’s not sure.
Steve lets him have a minute. Steve takes his dead weight without complaint and sweeps his fingertips along the length of Tony’s spine, and it gives him chills.
The air tastes of the crisp bite of fall, not dissimilar from that which he’d left behind. Petrichor and chocolate flood his nostrils, the latter faint but distinct enough to rustle up his memory. The sun shines bright and warm on the exposed skin of his face and arms, a sharp contrast to the damp press of the ground against his back. Birds chirp and bees buzz close by, and when he finally peels his eyes open, he’s only a little dazed by the vast expanse of cloudless blue sky above him.
Steve rests a hip against the counter and runs a hand through his hair. He’s in dire need of a proper cut and shave, but Alexa likes rubbing her face against his beard, says it feels funny. Besides, after what happened at the mall all those months ago, he likes being able to go places incognito.
you, really?” he asks, words tinged with a desperation that Steve understands all too well. “You’re not just some old guy. Are you?”
Once he’s in place and Tony is readying himself to descend the platform, Rogers steps forward.
“Cap,” Tony says, nodding, and Steve slowly turns where he sits to see. “How’d it go?”
“You were great with Morgan this week,” he says, leaning back in his chair.
Steve feels the blood rush to his cheeks and then divert south as Tony sends another wink in his direction.
that this is too personal for that.
“You wouldn’t have. I’ve learned that nobody is anyone’s, Steve.”
He takes a detour through the food aisles, perusing the brightly-colored shelves until he comes to something that makes him slam to a stop.
It’s just research, he tells himself. He’s paying attention, and that’s just good journalism. It’s got nothing to do with how Tony’s so close that Steve can smell the barest hint of cologne still clinging to his pulse points.
“Yeah, but according to him, everything with the Accords happened before you found out,” Steve says, and Tony loves watching his brain tick, getting to see how Steve lays everything out as though it couldn’t possibly exist any other way. Even when it’s infuriating, it’s still fascinating. “I wouldn’t have let us get torn apart like that. I would have found a way to talk it out with you.”
“She’s a little young for me.”
He’s not entirely sure when the urges started. He just grips the glass bottle tight and refuses to allow himself to reach out.
“I am not,” Steve says, shaking his head as he dries his hands with a paper towel. He knows he doesn’t look like himself anymore, hair nearly entirely white and his face only retaining a fraction of the angled handsomeness from his youth. While appearing youthful for his age, he knows that this acknowledgment isn’t enough for even a genius like Tony to be able to approximate his real identity.
The gutters need cleaning and Steve should probably shower and get ready to walk to the home improvement store so he can get supplies to patch the tear in the screen door, a result of Manny and Zeke’s continued football practice the previous afternoon. He stays in the middle of the kitchen though, long past when he’s caught his breath.
He feels as light as air, and for the first time in his life, feels truly content with what he is leaving behind.
“If I didn’t need you for an alien invasion, then what the hell
It’s meant to be flippant as he lifts his cup with a wry grin, something for Pepper to smile politely at before getting in the car and leaving them to go their separate ways, but then Happy is opening the rear door and -
“Don’t you know her?” Sam’s questions cuts through the tangent about whether or not Sokovia had been a cover-up for much more nefarious motives, and Steve looks up, grasping the lifeline gratefully.
“Pete, I’m going to need that back
Tony looks closer, taking in the worry lines around Steve’s mouth and the tight pull to his eyes.
, Tony thinks.
The door is pushed open, nearly noiselessly, and Steve turns his head to see Peggy who appears to be equal parts uneasy and unsurprised.
It’s a bit of an epinephrine-spiked blur from then on. Pierce comes by to yell and Steve just ignores him, packing his personal belongings into his bag before swinging the strap across his chest. There are threats of lawsuits and security comes up at one point, but the two men are beer-bellied and eye Clint’s biceps and Steve’s height warily, so they wait until Natasha is done and the monitor is dead before Steve allows them to escort him to the elevator bank.
“Good,” Tony says, grin amped back up to four-hundred percent. “So you’ll come?”
Tony levels him with a reluctantly impressed glare. “You hold your liquor appallingly well,” he says distrustfully. “If I’d known that it would take as long as it did to knock your sweet ass on the floor - ”
He’s beyond insulted. She of all people should know that his ideal honeymoon includes a sinfully lazy and luxurious romp through the Mediterranean, complete with marathon sex between gauzy white sheets and endless scoops of gelato. Sweaty clothing and a seriously frightening impending descent into starvation have never been on the table, and after one seriously misguided farce of a relationship where they both preferred to fantasize about what could be rather than what actually was, Pepper should
Acceptance has given Steve the ability to breathe. He reads articles with a steady heartbeat and scans magazines in checkout lines without dropping anything. Pictures on the news don’t bother him, and occasionally he feels a flicker of tightness in his chest when he’s confronted with that familiar face, but that’s it. He isn’t angry, or lovesick, or heartbroken. Maybe he’ll never really be
“Tony? What’s wrong?”
“You care about me!” Tony crows, walking backward, which really must be the worst idea in the universe as the heel of his shoe catches on a tuft of carpet and sends him careening onto his ass. Sighing internally, Steve watches to see if he needs a hand to get up. He doesn’t, slowly but surely getting back to his own two feet and decidedly
To his credit, Steve takes it in stride, only blinking once before gathering himself.
The words get caught in his throat, and Tony’s curiosity is instantly piqued.
“I do know everything,” Natasha says, and it’s a short walk to the living room where they’d informally asked the live-in Avengers to congregate, so they pause while still out of earshot. “But it would be nice to have it confirmed.”
“No - I mean, yeah. Yeah, I know her. Knew her, really, but we were never close. Everhart worked at the office with me before she wormed her way into stuff like this, that was all.” Christine looks almost exactly as she had when he saw her last, roots touched up and sporting a rather shocking amount of bare skin for a spot on a national news station. She’d transitioned to screen by starting local before quickly landing a position on one of the popular morning shows, and now she routinely features on the national news channels with reports on whatever political issue she’s deemed worth investigating.
Natasha talks, telling Steve everything that Tony had filled her in on. He’d done a thorough job, Steve notes bittersweetly, nodding along as he relives the final battle with her. A couple of times she offers him the opportunity to talk about what he’s been up to since then, but he doesn’t take her up on it and she doesn’t seem too offended. Eventually, the ground starts to level out and then the trees abruptly come to a stop, the forest turning them out onto a stone path that transforms into wide stairs, and Steve spends the last small bit of the journey staring at the sight in front of them.
Tony clicks his teeth back together and pulls his fork back to his side of the table, shaking his head to clear the visual before it grows roots in his brain matter.
There’s the flush of the toilet in the downstairs bathroom, and Tony appears a minute later. Steve’s set up for the night, reclined against a pillow with a book in his lap, and they stare at each other.
“If I’d known you were going to be so petty about it, I wouldn’t have let you bring it up,” Tony says, and he’s finally getting up, but the moment he’s on his feet, he’s turning his back on Steve and heading to the engine again.
So they sit, arms around each other, and Steve has never been more thankful for the invention of glass with the ability to turn opaque on demand.
“Shit. Sorry, Pep.”
“Here’s what I can tell you,” Steve says, once Rogers’ footsteps have faded away. “I’m going to need that time machine to work inter-dimensionally.”
“I don’t need you to buy me things,” he settles on, trying to sound decisive.
Tony’s face goes wobbly before smoothing out.
“You’re really not giving anything up?” Tony is annoyingly persistent in a way that would make anyone else a douchebag rather than enchantingly entertaining. It makes Steve turn the question over in his mind like he’s seriously thinking about answering, abandoning any remaining iota of integrity so that he can finally give up any lingering pretense on his end and fall into the trap of letting this feel like a back-and-forth, like a date, as though he isn’t being fucking
Tony takes off his sunglasses and polishes them on the bottom of his shirt.
It’s just that now, this is feeling a little less like a profile and a little more like something
“I try,” he says quietly. “Don’t always get it right, but I try.”
He looks at his computer, the screensaver back and displaying a photograph of a Great White Shark off the coast of South Africa. It reminds him of clever teeth and bad choices, and he touches the mouse to get rid of it as fast as he humanly can.
Steve hedges, scratching at the back of his neck because he’s gotten the gist of it, knows that despite the ambiguous passage of time it hasn’t been long enough for Tony and Natasha for them to have expected him, and he’s not sure that he’s ready to talk about Peggy and his branching timeline.
Tony’s everywhere from the start, wide hand a brand through to his thigh while the other curls into the meat of Steve’s shoulder before finding Steve’s face. He holds him there, palm flat and insistent against his cheek, kissing like he’s afraid Steve might run away at any moment. Only that doesn’t make any sense; surely any second now Tony will realize he’s kissing some second-rate moron who turns into a stuttering irresponsible imbecile every time they meet. After that, he’ll come to and see what a horrible error in judgment this is, hopefully saving Steve from having to admit that he’s the one who’s making a mistake.
In a last-ditch attempt, he struggles to blink his eyes wide open.
“Thank you,” Steve murmurs, soft enough that Tony can barely hear. “That means a lot to me.”
Beth gives him a very serious look.
“Which one?” he repeats.
Steve knows it’s time to take his hand away, but doesn’t. He rakes through Tony’s hair again, feeling minuscule shards of ice that pierce his skin before turning to fat water droplets. Tony is patient, pale lips open a mere fraction and long lashes unblinking. There’s no excuse for how quickly Steve’s mind is sliding into places it shouldn’t remember: wondering if Tony’s mouth is as soft as it had been before, if Tony would let him sneak under his quarter-zip to brush the warm skin of his waist, if he’s brave enough to do anything he’s ever wanted to or if he’s destined to have only ever gotten the briefest taste of liquid-sweet indulgence.
“There’s so much I want to tell you,” he says, and as he speaks, his lips shape the words against Tony’s. “You’re the only one I’ve ever wanted to crack myself open for.”
At least Steve can blame the heat in his cheeks on the flames from the grill, he figures. It’s not like he’s interested in maintaining plausible deniability, not when his thighs ache as pleasantly as they do, but when Tony comes by to rest a hand on the small of his back and ask if he wants another Long Island Iced Tea, he can’t quite meet Clint’s humored eyes.
Steve stills, and Tony must sense the way he tenses because now he’s stroking Steve’s forearms reassuringly.
There’s a glint to Tony’s eye, something that Steve doesn’t want to see grow roots, so he puts an end to the visit and declines to visit the Tower at any time.
“It looks like what we could have had all along,” Steve says, and the burn is depthless.
Sharon still delivers the eulogy, only this time it’s aching and poignant, not existing under the guise of anything else.
But Tony doesn’t seem interested in listening to him. Instead, spine supporting him as weakly as any column possibly can without crumbling completely, Tony lets out a pitiful moan and clutches his stomach.
Unlike almost everything he says, Steve can tell that Tony means it.
Tony can’t even imagine. He’s not even fifty yet, but the thought of living that long makes him shudder. For the time being, he’s on friendly terms with his own mortality, but that could change in an instant. Words echo in his head, a firm but kind reminder, and Tony thinks of the solid wood chairs in the kitchen and minty lemonade.
“I’ll take the tour,” he says. “Might be nice to run into some old faces.”
No matter how certain he is that Tony will escape and be found, Steve keeps an unconscious eye on the date.
He almost regrets the words as soon as they’re out there, but Sam hums like he’s considering it.
“Your words, not mine.”
When Tony appears in the room, he slides off his sunglasses and tucks them in the front of his shirt.
“So,” he says, having to nearly shout to be heard clearly. His cheeks warm when Tony leans in to hear him, cataloging the furrow between his eyebrows while hesitating and parsing through his words. “This must be a pretty typical night for you.”
“I don’t care,” Steve says with authority, shaking his head. “I’ve fought enough people in my lifetime to know that I don’t ever want to fight you. I wouldn’t have let that happen.”
The rest of the Avengers line the very back row, like a gaggle of children being forced to stay quiet during Sunday mass, the promise of a reward for good behavior the only thing keeping them in line.
“Obviously,” Tony says, waving from Steve’s immobile head to toe. “But if you could kindly move aside and get some photographic evidence - ”
Steve wants to linger on that, to ask what exactly he means and what any of this means, because Tony’s knee is too far away despite how Steve knows that wanting proximity is a thorny path to venture down. Only he remembers what it’s like to be pressed together, to want each other, and memories are faulty and rose-colored and Steve can’t remember why he ever let himself get so twisted up about this when it could’ve been as simple as them wanting each other -
“I’ve got to move,” he says, truly apologetic as Steve’s limbs rest uselessly.
“Just say whatever it is you’re going to say.”
“Who are you?” Tony asks, in that childlike way that would be rude if not for its genuine curiosity and charm.
Neither of them needs to acknowledge how patently untrue that would be.
“I’m just saying,” Tony says, holding his hands up defensively. “I’m the one who brought up retirement first. You did kind of hop on the bandwagon there, champ.”
Steve knows that “didn’t want to” can be interpreted in a myriad of ways, and he wouldn’t know where to begin even if he wanted to.
“You know all about me.” His eyes are intent, fingers bluntly squared off as he drums them on the slightly tacky tabletop.
When Steve gives Beth back her phone with the promise that she won’t be bothered anymore, he feels strange.
Tony can’t help but lapse into hysterical giggles as Steve shows him a can of whipped cream and a bottle of chocolate sauce, the latter of which has a vibrant pink sticky note attached. It says
Steve knows his lack of a response gives him away, and Tony sighs.
If Tony had really regretted anything, he wouldn’t have let things happen between them again in the limo. But he
“I can afford plenty,” Tony says, confused. “Billionaire, remember?”
Colonel Rhodes, Steve remembers, and he observes closely as they engage in some sort of manly bump-and-hug before separating.
“And I meant what I said about always needing you,” Tony says finally. “I couldn’t have done any of it without you.”
Whatever he’d been working on must not have been important, because Tony doesn’t put up any semblance of a fight. Instead he just lets Steve tug at the waistband of his sweatpants and swirls patterns over the length of his beautiful, exposed spine. Eventually, Steve sinks to his knees and then Tony is moaning, running his hands through Steve’s hair until he’s twisting and pulling hard and muttering nonsense about how the caveman hair isn’t so bad after all. Steve smiles as best as he can, hands braced on the outside of Tony’s thighs. It’s lazy and perfect and when they’re done, he settles back on Tony’s lap and stays there.
Christine peers at the creamy folded garment bag, fingers navigating to the zipper just slow enough for him to catch her by the elbow.
Steve scoffs again, only louder this time.
Yeah, he knows he lets Steve get away with murder. It’s not news, not to him at least, and certainly not to those with a keen eye and an ounce of awareness.
“Depends,” Tony says, word drawn out. He rocks side to side on the bench they’re occupying, slow and creaking with a jab of his index finger to Steve’s thigh before he settles upright. “Pot.
Steve had pushed his upper half upright, Tony assisting minimally as the silence started to disappear, awed whispering buzzing around them as everyone began to feel the impact of reality.
“I can help,” is all he can think to say.
“What?” he asks, uncertain.
So, not entirely nonplussed, then.
His throat almost closes up in panic.
“You have to find him first,” Steve says, and Rogers makes the noise again.
But several months later, Maria delivers a healthy baby boy and Peggy strokes the back of his hand.
Really, if Steve’d been able to locate any, he’d have popped a bag of popcorn and sat down on a stool to enjoy the one-man show. Around the time Tony’d circled back around to complain about Pietro’s completely unjustified lack of faith in the current jet’s reliability, Steve had started digging through the cabinet of the kitchenette at the far side of the shop and uncovered a bag of coffee grounds that passed a rather ginger sniff test. He’d brewed a pot mostly to have something to do while Tony once again swerved clear of telling Steve anything he really wanted to know and drank an entire cup that tasted like his unpaid internship days, but Tony’s neglected to resurface long enough to down more than a grand total of one sip and the contents of his designated mug have since gone stone cold.
“That for me?” Steve asks, treading water till he reaches Tony and nods at the cherry popsicle in his hand.
“Yours truly,” Tony says proudly, flicking through his holograms, and Steve wishes there was a way he could cook and watch him at the same time.
“Apparently,” Steve says. “You two feel like explaining your lack of faith in me?”
“Tony.” His tongue curls desperately around the syllables, and Steve rests a hand on the seat between them. He wants to say anything worthwhile - whether to reassure Tony that it’s not about not wanting this, or to ask if he’s missing something from four years prior - but can’t land on any combination of words that doesn’t feel woefully inadequate. “I just - thank you, for the ride.”
“Tony - he told us we could call him Tony. It’s okay that we call him that, right?”
He never responds to Tony’s messages. He just lets them haunt him on the days he isn’t busy convincing himself that nothing ever happened.
“You’re ridiculous,” Steve tells him.
“What were you thinking?”
“Callie is supposed to call at seven,” she says.
she’s got a much more advanced UI than that outdated piece of - ”), ordering demands (“We are not getting garlic rolls, that much gluten will wreak havoc on my small intestine, I don’t
The Avengers keep busy, and that’s fine. Steve doesn’t need Tony’s undivided attention; he only needs Tony sometimes, enough to make sure the time machine is ready to go when he needs it. He watches as Tony progresses, watches as he improves the tech and gear of everyone on the team, and otherwise stays out of the way.
“We need help finding people,” she says. “And we always need money. Denise thinks we can move somewhere smaller by the end of the year, and the damn mayor won’t let us stay. They think getting conventions and performances up and running will help, somehow.”
“That’s up to you, isn’t it?”
Cold sweat prickles along Steve’s hairline, and the text in front of him begins to blur.
“Ms. Potts,” he says, feeling relief and awkwardness spread through him all at once. “Hi.”
Steve lifts their hands to his mouth, kisses every single one of Tony’s bones, and looks him dead in the eye.
“What about other people?” he asks, running a hand along the bark of a tree. He concentrates for a split second, and a squirrel runs up to disappear into its branches.
Sharon does, occasionally. She’s been another casualty of Peggy’s lifetime, held at a distance, and Steve is careful to never be present when she is. Aunt Peggy is little more than a name to her, some vague inspiration impressed upon a young girl through her father.
It’s all starting to blur together, as Steve inhales and feels his memories grow fuzzy.
It’s not a lifeline as much as it is a damnation. Sam nods at the screen, where a well-groomed woman is currently taking up half the spliced screen while standing on the ground outside Avengers Tower. Mouth curling spitefully, Steve shakes his head.
“I can be yours,” Tony tells him, haltingly but unexpectedly sincere. “I can have been yours.”
“They were nice,” Steve reassures. “Feels a bit strange to be allowed into the inner sanctum like this, but they’re nice.”
“There is something I think I need to tell you, though,” Steve continues, and Tony freezes.
“I couldn’t even if I tried,” Steve says through a humorless laugh. “I thought that maybe - ”
He feels like he’s spent almost his entire life on the sidelines; can’t remember a time when life didn’t feel like a spectator sport.
From the way Tony looks over, he thinks he does.
is off the phone and rid his apartment of its current invader -
“I don’t know how the world works,” Steve says. “I just know that you’re mine, and the stars aligned so it would work out like this. Maybe they align differently in the other universes, but I don’t want to think of a world where we don’t end up like this.”
“I wasn’t even there,” Steve says, and it feels self-flagellating and pathetic, but Tony shakes his head and holds Steve closer.
“You’re welcome.” Tony doesn’t even glance up, still busy with his phone.
“Sam,” Steve sighs, but it’s hard not to loosen up when Sam is so on the nose about Steve’s tendency to retract in on himself whenever the going gets tough. “It’s not worth talking about.”
Tony’s mouth wrinkles into something unpleasant. “Still think I’ve always been nice to you?”
So Tony does what he does best - he takes matters into his own hands until the table is nearly groaning with the weight of it all. He encourages Rogers until he’s tried everything the waitress brings over (she’s perked up considerably at the prospect of an exorbitant tip), and it’s hard to look away from this new form of entertainment.
It doesn’t take long to figure it out.
Proof that Steve Rogers had never been stupid, he thinks, before giving him a talk practically identical to the one he had given Fury.
Once in the air, Tony lets FRIDAY take over the controls and they sit in the cockpit and debate whether or not it would be irresponsible to have sex without another human available to pilot in case of an emergency. As much as Tony argues that he can tap out and take over for FRIDAY in an instant, Steve’s seen enough to justify his reasonable doubt and they end up just talking with Tony half-curled against his chest.
“It’s not that,” Tony says, stalling by acting like he needs Steve spread wider, nudging at his one flat leg. Steve adjusts obediently. “I just need a second.”
“You did,” Steve says simply.
Tony opens his mouth, but she’s faster.
“What?” Tony asks. “Careful, you’re going to yank my arms right out of their sockets like that - I’m coming, calm down - ”
Steve doesn’t want to leave. He wants to stay, to listen to Tony talk forever, to soak up and encourage every bit of his genius and bury him in so much love that he never wants for anything. But he knows he can’t, because this Tony is not a substitute for the one that he lost.
“Motherfucker,” Tony swears, determined to come up with ten ways to blackmail Steve Rogers to kingdom come before the day is over.
“You matter, Steve,” Tony says, and they’re coming up on the airport. “You matter so much, to so many people.”
Steve’s just gotten his heart rate under control and begun to turn around when Tony says:
“Do you feel like you have more to say?”
“Your mind sent you where it wanted to be,” she finishes, and he’d suspected, but it’s still nice to know. It makes sense, what with the flowers and animals and sunny open sky.
“I’m serious,” he says, clinging to the vestiges of his dignity as he turns the knob. “You’re not getting away with leaving it there. You should know me better than that.”
“Hi, Morgan,” he greets her, unsure of how to interact with her, despite the fact that he’s got a Serena and a Christina a few states back, and he does just fine with them. This feels almost like a test, one that he really needs to ace for some reason.
It’s going to be a controversial choice, Steve knows, to appoint him Person of the Year. Stark Industries and associated organizations have contributed more aid and technological advancements worldwide than any other entity, Tony’s last name plastered all over everything, and that’s even without factoring Iron Man into things. Some people think he’s a fraud, though, a man in an expensive tin can with a god complex who’s spent way too long unchecked.
“Only because you’re my guest here, and the sushi was supposed to be my treat,” Tony says.
“I will not be an accompaniment to your booty calls,” Sam says, and Steve promises with an extra-wide, extra-genuine grin.
“So what happened next?” he asks, enraptured.
“I’ve had a really great time,” he confesses, staring out over the ocean. “I - I don’t think I’ve felt like this in a really long time. Or ever, really.”
“I still can’t believe your five-year-old likes sushi.”
“I do,” Steve agrees. “I do know you much better than that.”
So Steve grills and Tony settles into his lounger with his tablet. It’s peaceful and almost fantastical, and they eat outside in the dark with glasses of red wine. Between the two of them, they polish off close to two bottles, and Tony is gloriously red-mouthed as he talks about how Carol is supposed to visit next month, dependent on whether or not the galaxy throws anything new at her.
Steve looks away, focuses on Elliot who’s miserably failing at acting like he’s not hanging on Tony’s every word.
He swallows that down before it can turn dangerous, a remark that would normally be flippant and discarded as “Shit Tony Stark Says That He Doesn’t Mean,” because he would mean it, and that means he definitely can’t say it.
“Tony here was telling me about what he wants to be when he grows up,” Steve says, wrapping his hand around Peggy’s, eyes still trained on Tony. He waves his hands around when he talks, always restless, just as Steve’s Tony had been. “What was it again, Tony?”
Then there’s a slightly mechanical voice coming from the ceiling and announcing the time and weather conditions, and Steve barely manages to land on the bed instead of the floor when he falls on his ass in complete shock.
“You hate feeling useless,” Pepper supplies as he ambles alongside slightly untidy hedges and pretty multicolored flowers wrapping around the side of the house.
Thankfully, he doesn’t have to, not right now.
Steve knows that she’s a talented journalist - more talented than him if he’s being perfectly honest - but sometimes he doesn’t know how she ever got anyone to take her seriously in the first place. “What makes you think he’d entertain the idea of propositioning me at all?” It’s only meant to antagonize her, but she merely sips delicately at her wine while eyeing him sideways.
Steve glances around at the boys. Elliot is pushing his glasses up his nose, but otherwise they all seem unbothered.
Tony looks inordinately pleased as Steve pulls his hand back into his own lap.
“Yeah, well,” Tony says, unbothered as he leans back against Natasha’s legs. “You heard me earlier. Needed to make sure you didn’t decide to snatch up the first pretty face you saw.”
“Pepper moved,” Bucky corrects.
“Yeah,” Steve says blankly, dipping his head in acknowledgment as Rhodes wraps a strong arm around Tony’s shoulder and begins to guide him across the lobby. Steve watches Tony leave, feels the ghost of his tingling mouth above his jaw, and knows that whatever kind of article he manages to cobble together from this night is going to be just as much of a mess as the last piece he wrote about Tony.
Rhodes snipes Tony’s mug, prompting loud complaints as it’s carried to the pot that’s in desperate need of refilling.
“Sorry,” Steve says into the receiver. He’s a little surprised Tony is still there. “I’m borrowing one of the kids' phones.”
“Maybe later,” Steve says, but it feels like a lie. He’s been in Houston for a couple of months and November has finally freed the city from the oppressive heat he’s grown used to, and he’s in no hurry to leave before he’s made sure that every kid who could have a home, makes it there.
“It’s time,” Tony says, going over to a station to fiddle with some buttons, discreetly wiping his face dry. “Everyone ready?”
Tony knocks aside the primitive, childish urge to stick his fingers in the gaping hole in Steve’s thigh, because aside from being inappropriately close to his groin, it’s also more than a little gross.
Beth shrugs and takes a long drink of peach milkshake. “I don’t know, that’s just what she told Bonnie.”
Hill clears her throat. “Is this a ‘no,’ then?”
“I want to,” he says, like it’s nothing. “So unless you don’t want to hear it - ”
“You know, we’re supposed to be the ones taking care of you.”
For the first time, Rogers wavers.
“So you don’t think it’s weird?”
“I don’t hate you,” Steve protests, but it feels too hollow even in his own head to be of much convincing. It’s all he has to offer though, because the alternative is something like
“I know,” Steve says. “You’re being really brave, Christina. What do you say the three of us take a walk to Burger King after this?”
They part with a heavy handshake, reluctant on Fury’s end. The sun rises and Steve proceeds as usual.
“It was a close call,” Tony admits. “Just say you’ll think about it.”
Tony looks around at the home he visited a handful of years prior. He remembers it well without even trying, not eidetic but impressively close, and reaches for the memory easily. Steve doesn’t give him time to verbalize the recollection, too itchy with expertly concealed nerves.
He thinks of a different compound, familiar and foreign in its insignificant deviations. He thinks of a second funeral and camaraderie beyond that of his wildest dreams.
“Talk to me,” he orders, low and undemanding.
“If you were flexible, I’d’ve propositioned you when we hired you,” she says sweepingly. “But you’re not, and he is. You’re both extremely attractive, and we all know what happens when attractive people get together. Forgive me for assuming you’d know better than to pass up a chance with someone as reportedly talented in bed as Tony Stark, especially considering the history there.”
Only her profile looks familiar, and she must be thinking the same thing about him as she does a double-take.
Tony grimaces. “You saying that is exactly why I want to.”
“Behave,” Denise says then, finally stalking across the room to the stairs, like a cheetah after its prey. “We’ve got kid ears everywhere.”
“What?” he asks. “Is my hair really that bad?”
“He did.”
“You don’t have to come back,” Bucky says, and Steve’s chest loosens and tightens at the same time. “But things are okay here. He’s okay with everything. In case you were worried about that.”
Tony gnaws on the edge of his thumbnail.
“No,” Steve says, because that’s not what’s happened here. “I just know you. Better than either of us want me to, probably.”
and it could have been horrible and ugly or beautiful and world saving, except it hadn’t saved anything, not the way old Steve had told it. They might never know, but Tony has a bone-deep inkling that it had been a tragedy, and he knows as Steve grips his hand that he knows it just the same.
Steve is grinning wide, fingers easily finding Tony’s side under his suit jacket and pinching him through his dress shirt.
to delve into this man’s life until he has enough with which to paint a glossy picture for anyone to read, should they want to.
The faceplate clicks down, and even though Steve’s sure the motion is highly controlled and mechanized, he wants to swear that it snaps with a petulant finality.
It’s been - difficult, to say the least. He can’t stop his mind from scrolling through stupid Buzzfeed articles and tabloid slideshows; pictures of Tony on the arm of his date on the way into the party, pictures of Tony stumbling out of a club at an hour more morning than night, Tony sliding into the same car he’d exhaustively dissected Steve’s mouth in only hours before, only this time some prettily non-descript blonde was sliding in behind him.
Steve remembers what that used to feel like, and how rare it had been. It had been like winning a contest on the radio, something that you didn’t think would ever happen until it did, and it was a thousand times more exciting than it had any reason to be.
“Steve, no,” Tony says. “You can’t - I know you loved her, but - maybe I didn’t live in a parallel universe, but I don’t think it works like that.”
Steve swallows around thoughts of the sidewalk chalk art he still does for Lance and Ben, and how he fixes Christina microwave mac and cheese on nights she’s feeling particularly picky. He thinks of Jackson and Charlie, Denise’s little brother, and how they point out every dog they see when Steve walks them to the school bus stop in the mornings.
“Steve Rogers, right?” The courier is a hilariously acceptable level of squirrelly, double-checking the pad before glancing at Steve, then Christine, whose assets are on full display with her blazer abandoned at her desk in favor of showing off the undone buttons on her shirt. “I’m supposed to ask for some photo ID.”
Pierce is standing before his desk, gesturing at the enormous tv tucked against the wall with a Rolex-wrapped wrist and his usual smarmy expression.
“That whole Sokovia thing was a bigger mess than the public is ever going to know,” Tony says, and Steve pours more coffee into the emptied mug as well as the other one he’d pulled off a shelf above the sink. It’s yellow and bears the word
“I’ve got to go,” he says, forcing his voice to stay even. “I promised the girls Burger King.”
Steve just shrugs. He’s not sure that he even knows.
No matter what, Steve insists on keeping his old duffel. He even refuses to let Tony send a plane for him, but when his boarding pass informs him that he’s been upgraded to first class, he decides it’s not worth fighting about. After all, first class on a flight this length is hardly noteworthy. The extra legroom is appreciated though, and the flight attendant clearly knows who he is as she repeatedly and eagerly offers complimentary cocktails and snacks.
When Steve wakes, he’s neither surprised nor disappointed to find Tony absent. Instead he just calls for FRIDAY who points him in the direction of Tony’s lab - which does have secret passageway access, he makes a note to confide in Wanda. He doesn’t bother with clothes, just asking FRIDAY for blackout mode. Tony is absorbed enough in whatever he’s tending to with a furrowed brow that he doesn’t notice, not till Steve approaches from behind and wraps his arms around bare shoulders.
“I’m happy for you,” Steve reassures him, and he means it.
“I don’t remember,” he says, a little white lie.
The lettering is still identifiable, though.
“Yeah, I’m gonna need more than that,” Tony says, gripping the edge of his desk and wheeling himself in tight under the surface as he exaggeratedly reaches as if to grasp the phone sat in the corner, almost too far away to realistically access. “Otherwise, I’m calling a shrink. Or 911.”
“Do you really think I - ”
Tony looks about the same, just with more defined wrinkles. He looks good, still all compact muscle and Steve wonders if he still flies around in the suit to keep his endurance up. It had always been his favorite form of exercise. His hair has less gray than Steve remembers, but he’s not sure if that’s due to faulty memory or dye. As much as the years have worn on them, Tony could be a lot worse for wear.
Things stall in the food section, inexplicably. Tony is searching for something, anything that will give him his caffeine fix, and is gripping a quart of cold brew in each hand when he realizes that Steve is several yards away.
“Come on,” he says. “Or else you won’t get to decide where to stay, and I’ll make sure you get the smallest room ever.”
say something, and suddenly Tony’s fingers are pressed to his lips, a fierce expression on his face.
Steve is unsurprised despite his racing pulse, and he catalogues the location of all their body parts.
“I don’t need anything,” he says softly, truthfully. The band is gone, and Steve knows it won’t be coming back. Not anymore.
“I thought we were all here because it was an excellent bonding opportunity,” Tony says, and he goes to sit very gingerly on the bench next to Steve, thankful that Clint is piloting them back to the Tower and he doesn’t have to concentrate on anything other than the throbbing pain that runs up and down most of his right side. “Has Barton apologized to you yet for not taking out that minion in time?”
Tony despises him, from his too-pink mouth and too-long eyelashes to his too-stiff posture and too-broad shoulders.
Tony tilts his head to look at him. “No one’s asking you to.”
It makes him ache inside, so deep inside that he isn’t sure he can feel anything at all.
“I just wanna forget about it,” Steve tells her, misery tugging sharply at his throat and the corners of his eyes. “It’s so stupid, he’s not even worth it.”
Tony can feel his brow crease with confusion, because he’d barely known the older Steve Rogers before he’d come to the compound and spilled his entire life’s story in between quietly watching as Tony worked on interdimensional time travel. As significant a mark he’d left behind, Tony hadn’t known him, no matter what Steve says to the contrary.
“I love you,” Tony insists, hands coming up to cover Steve’s. He doesn’t pull at them, just holds them, and exaggeratedly puckers his lips until Steve indulges him with a tender kiss.
“Tony doesn’t like to be kept waiting,” she says, waving him forward, and she stays several paces behind as he goes to leave. “Enjoy your time together.”
“Oh.” Tony rubs at the back of his neck, and Steve defers a frown. “I didn’t say you did. I just thought - you want coffee?”
“Mr. Rogers.” The woman has a face that Steve’d researched thoroughly, demeanor professional and distant and all the things that Steve had wanted to be as Tony’s interviewer. He’s never heard her voice before but had scheduled the interview through her, and she looks every ounce of frighteningly efficient that their email correspondence had warned him she’d be.
“At Target?” he asks petulantly, and Steve places a hand on his thigh, all warm and electric. “Was I that distracted by all the body washes?”
Tony’s eyes begin to shine.
Instead, Steve heads back to the place he stayed in when he wasn’t keeping Natasha company at the compound. It looks as it did the last time he was there, and he packs a duffel bag and finds the stash of cash behind a loose brick. There’s a cap jammed on his head, he exchanges most of the cash for a bike that’s old but runs well enough, and he gets the hell out of dodge.
Steve considers his words with the utmost care, but ultimately it doesn’t matter. The truth is one that he has long been intimately familiar with. There’s no desire to lie.
“Yes, you do,” Steve says. “What’s not to understand?”
She’s still looking at him, unscrewing the cap of her drink and sipping while she does, and it’s disconcerting to say the least.
“I made a choice,” Steve says, and it’s all pouring out of him now, because this Tony is the only one who can ever really understand all that Steve has been through, from beginning to end. “I made choices, and I was so sure that I made the right ones, but what if they were only right for me and not for anyone else ?”
“Thank you for the opportunity,” he hears himself say, finally extending a hand. He doesn’t catch whether or not Tony regards it with any particular type of expression, only registers the cold clasp of hand around his - brief, firm, and sure. As though Tony has nothing to hide.
“You’re part of the public,” Tony points out, much to Steve’s chagrin. “So don’t I get to hear your perception?”
it - hell, he’s semi-seriously dated other people and still hasn’t gotten over it - but that had been just as much a part of acceptance as the rest of it.
“Um. No ma’am. I mean - no, Captain. Captain Marvel? Miss Carol. I’m not - and you’ve got to be at least twenty-one anyway, so - ”
Because when he reaches down for the first brush against Steve’s hole, there’s not a single iota of doubt in his mind that this is what they’re supposed to do together.
And well - it's been well established that Tony isn’t very good at denying him anything.
It’s not easy, staying away from the others. He longs to spend time with Natasha again, wants to laugh with Sam, and aches to hug Bucky one last time. But he can’t do any of that, even after they all understand who the weird old man living among them is. He doesn’t know what Tony and Rogers had told them, and quite frankly, he doesn’t care. They’re in the home stretch now, and knowing can’t hurt anyone more than what would come if he were to stay away. Aside from Tony, he really only interacts with Rogers, but it’s clear that his other self had gotten all the answers he needed a long time ago. Probably had gotten them the first time they’d met, if Steve thinks on it.
“Who gave you these questions, anyway?” Tony interrupts, sitting up. “A bunch of diplomats in wolf's clothing? When did you turn into such a people pleaser, anyway?”
Steve wonders if he’s capable of blushing as hard as he used to when he was young and his circulation was not yet diminished.
“I know,” Steve says as the doors ding open. “Thanks.”
“I don’t understand,” Tony says, brows furrowed.
He hadn’t meant to ask it quite like that exactly, but something similar had been in his head and now he’s rather glad that he didn’t get the opportunity to voice it.
“See, Steve knows better,” Tony says, pointing at them warningly.
“It’s not like I thought it would be,” Steve says, almost wondrous as his nails carve half-moons into Tony’s deltoids before deliciously raking up and down. “It’s so full, but it’s like - it’s like - ”
“Yeah,” Tony’d said, free hand finding Steve’s pulse again, using it to help regulate his own rapid respirations. “We did it together.”)
manner, an entirely different person than he'd been before they'd been interrupted.
but he suspects there’s more behind it than that. “Just be good with both of them, alright?”
“I’m not a virgin,” Steve says, and Tony can’t decide which one of them he wants to smack in the face.
Yep, sure enough, Steve turns around just in time to see Natasha neatly push him onto the floor in a crumpled heap. Steve doesn’t laugh - they’ve all run through various iterations of this routine too many times in the last several months - but Natasha meets his eyes before rolling hers, and he can’t help but grin, mood buoyed with their usual nonsense.
Tony rumbles a gravelly laugh.
“Right, because you let things be that easy,” Steve deadpans. And then, just as Tony is ready to defend himself - “Besides. You look better in black.”
“Oh,” Tony interrupts, and then, quieter - “Oh.”
Fury just sighs.
When Tony finally poses a question, his voice is as crystal clear as the sky stretched wide open above them despite the fact that he’s still nestled into Steve’s chest.
For perhaps the billionth time, Steve takes stock of all the things he has deprived his Peggy of. Their life together was full, rarely dull and personally fulfilling, but he attempts to take comfort in knowing that she was a different sort of happy in his original universe.
He gets fluffy white cream all over his mouth, and Tony can’t look away. He’s vaguely aware of his jaw unhinging as Steve swallows, Adam’s apple bobbing smoothly before he’s licking his lips clean, leaving behind wet, shiny, spit-slick lips that would kill a lesser man.
“So I was thinking,” Tony says, his voice rising in that way where he’s demanding to be listened to, and Steve behaves. “That since your road trip kind of got derailed when you decided to adopt a million kids, we could pick up where you left off. Take Morgan for a week or two, and end up back in Malibu.”
“What, you figured I’d end up in another ugly tower?” Tony asks ruefully, and Steve looks at him guiltily. “I thought about it. Didn’t feel right. Didn’t feel like a place to rest.”
“No,” Tony says, and Steve wastes no time in closing the door and dropping his bag to the floor. “I swear, it just had to do with space constraints, and - ”
“You think I need someone to tell me that you brood?” Sam asks in amusement, and Steve clangs his teeth together all wrong as Sam smirks broadly. “I’ve known you for how long now, and you think I can’t tell when you get in your head about something?”
“I’d like to have seen you sit in a modern-day university for a semester or two,” Tony says primly, neatly waving aside Steve’s flimsy excuses. “You would’ve caught up to me and Bruce in an instant. Why do you think we let SHIELD keep you busy doing muscle work? Couldn’t have old grandpa surpassing us.”
It is hard to stay away from them. Natasha feels close enough to touch, but he refrains. While he might know them, they do not know him. Still, he misses them all so much he aches with it.
Steve can’t help the way his mouth quirks into a smile. “Is it bothering you?”
“Got a super-sized bed for the super soldier,” Tony says. “There’s the attached bathroom - you’ve got an extra tall shower head, lots of attachments that are supposed to help with sore muscles. A custom bathtub, although I don’t know, do you like soaking?”
(Steve already knows what he’s going to decide. He’d known the moment he’d been asked.)
Steve lets JARVIS guide him in the kitchen, and after Tony’s been away for business for too long, he comes home to warm kisses and warm chocolate chip cookies. They’re a little undercooked and nearly fall apart in his hands, but Steve just licks chocolate smudges from his fingertips until Natasha tells them to get a room.
“My friend?” Steve asks, thrown.
Steve shrugs. His mouth is redder than Tony’s thumb and glorious. “Just thought it would be nice to go back. Didn’t get to fully appreciate it the first time around.”
“And remember, not Cap anymore,” he says, like Tony could forget.
“I’m making margaritas,” she says, stealing Rhodes’ knife and grabbing a bag of limes. “What are the chances Tony shows up with Parker?”
“So why divorce now?” Steve asks. “I don’t mean to - if that’s rude, you don’t have to answer.”
Josie indulges the handshake but looks at Steve like she can’t believe the guy, and he privately agrees with her.
“No one said you had to get up with me,” Steve reminds him, and Tony grumbles incoherently, safely assuming that Steve will get the gist of it. He does, or he must, because he just wraps an arm around Tony’s shoulders to pull him into his side. “He cared about the garden. The least we can do is get it up and running again.”
“If I wasn’t leaving, you were,” Steve points out. “After Loki, we all split. You left after Ultron. You didn’t exactly keep in touch. I got the message after that.”
After so long, perhaps they’ve finally mastered the give and take between them. It’s an effortless compensation, to know exactly how to balance himself against the smallest of movements. A perfect imitation of earlier words exchanged, neither leaving the other wanting or waiting.
hums slightly and pushes back against his nonverbal protest.
in the back of his throat. He drives into his dry fist at a punishing rate, too close too soon, oversensitive and unable to distinguish reality from memory as Tony clings to him and whispers in his ear.
The phone on the wall rings, just as he’s about to head to the bathroom.
“Which part of it?” Steve asks, head tipped back still, and Tony knows he only does that when he’s trying to keep himself together. He lets him have this, whatever shreds of composure he’s got left.
“Will I see you again?” Morgan asks, brown eyes enormous as she looks up at him.
Tony’s dressed exquisitely, tailored in black-and-white, but his tails are half-hanging out and his bowtie looks like it came undone at one point before being clumsily tied back together. There’s a visible wet splotch on his pants, too far down the thigh to be caused by anything truly indecent. He can’t seem to look at anything besides some ambiguous location beyond Steve, which while rude enough to sting, gives Steve a good opportunity to observe how slowly Tony blinks. If Steve didn’t know better, he’d think Tony was unwilling to come any further into the room, based on how tightly he’s gripping the doorjamb.
Tony goes quiet for a nanosecond before he’s huffing out a laugh that makes Steve irrationally displeased, considering how accidentally biting his words had come out.
When he’s in the middle of crouching down in front of the vegetable patch, considering poking through the soil to make sure they’re not missing any hidden gems within its depths, he hears Steve approach. It means that Steve wants to be heard coming, because he’s so light on his feet sometimes that he could give Natasha a run for her money, and Tony ignores the fondness unfurling in his chest as he balances his forearms on his knees.
“I don’t know what I’d do there,” he admits. “At least here, I’ve got a purpose. We got more than three hundred kids back to their families. And the ones we’ve still got...I’m not their dad, and they know that, but I’m what they’ve got. And they don’t have much.”
Except as Tony wakes up fully, he begins to chatter. Even at such a young age he has so much to say, and Steve does his best to hide how he marvels at him. Tony talks about his tutors and his favorite toys, and Steve listens intently and nods and asks questions in all the right places. He almost doesn’t notice when Peggy gets off the phone, and when she touches the back of his hand, he nearly jumps.
“Pretty sure that’s not what that phrase refers to, Cap,” Tony says suggestively.
That first real inhale feels like a bucket of cold water.
“Full-fat, full-sugar, got it,” Sam says, lifting his mug in a mock toast. “Are we still on a peppermint kick, or are we switching back to pumpkin spice?”
They don’t see Tony. If they did, Steve wouldn’t be able to help himself.
Bonnie looks past Steve, into the backyard, and refuses to make eye contact as she talks.
“The man is a vault,” Steve informs him. “He makes me look like the most open guy in the world.”
Peggy notices, and he doesn’t deserve her. He loves her so much.
“Of course he’ll remember you. We’re both blondes,” Christine says, tanned shoulder lifting prettily as she raises a hand to pat her hair, as if to ensure that the heavily hairsprayed updo hasn’t budged since the last time she checked. “With big racks. Kind of his thing, if you haven’t noticed.”
know who I am,” he deadpans, and she pushes at his arm and whines until he does one yellow and orange for her.
“How’d you know?” Tony asks in surprise, before shaking his head. “Of course you knew. You knew me, of course you know. Coming along swimmingly, now let’s get you inside, it’s about dinnertime. The others are out doing recon, should be back later, but I can get you something now.”
They just...kiss. Steve has no idea how long it goes on for, rubbing his thumbs into the perfect sloping divots on either side of the base of Tony’s spine. There’s some tentative jerking of hips, but strangely Tony doesn’t seem in any rush to hurry things along. Steve’s silently appreciative, not wanting to do anything more in the back of a car with a hired driver mere feet away, but nevertheless falls victim to the scorching tidal rush of Tony’s teeth tearing into his lips with a magical unit of pressure. It tugs at something deep behind Steve’s navel, desire-spiked lava flooding out to singe his fingertips and toes, and he moans loud enough to feel ashamed by it as Tony breaks the kiss to smile down at him in a pleasure-soused blur.
“Wow,” Steve says, eyes fully blinking open. “I think that’s the easiest you’ve ever agreed to anything. How d’you feel about giving me a piggyback ride to my room?”
“I can’t change the whole world, Peggy,” he says, because she’s got to understand. “We don’t know how much I changed by coming back in the first place.”
“Your hotel.” Tony’s thumbs are flying across the screen as soon as his ass is seated, except Steve knows what those phones are capable of, that Tony likes showing off and projecting the screen’s contents to impress everyone with his genius. He’s hiding, and Steve’s rational enough to know that there’s nothing wrong with saying no but Tony’s still allowed to feel however he does about it.
“Got you these,” he says, indicating the toothbrush and toothpaste. “In case you wanted…” He doesn’t need to clarify, merely nodding in the direction of the restroom.
“You haven’t told me how you feel about any of this,” Tony says, looking him straight in the eye once Steve has followed suit with his own pants and is looking at him expectantly. Steve opens his mouth, ready to deflect, but Tony holds up a hand. “No, no. None of your bullshit. Come on, I’ve told you how I feel. At least do me the courtesy of returning the favor.”
Steve hums, and Tony feels it more than hears it.
“You did, didn’t you?” Tony asks through a delighted chuckle, now rubbing the pads of his thumbs over Steve’s cheeks, and Steve is definitely not going to mention Sam’s advice. “You’re lucky, you know. Not every guy can grow it out so late in life and
“No,” Steve says, and he musters up a smile that Pepper doesn’t bother to return. “Just...thank him for me, will you? I really appreciate the opportunity.”
“They smell like cake,” Tony says, nose scrunching up as Steve takes his hands away. “Like - red velvet. Mom loved red velvet. Thought it was a novelty. Dad thought it was classless.”
“You don’t know where I live,” Steve says, unable to help the scoff that rises quickly enough to force itself out. “And I’m pretty sure it’s mobs, not mobsters. Two very different things.”
“A prototype,” Tony confirms. “I messed around with some other materials, but nothing else compares. I assume you know that.”
“You stopped for her?” He wants to know, wants to gauge the importance of other people in Tony’s life.
“Rhodey,” he explains. “His idea of romance, I don’t know. Damn fool.”
“No,” Rogers says quickly, scowling slightly.
He winces as he says it, and Steve wants to reach out and hold him.
His fingers itch for a cigarette for the first time in years.
Steve’s skin is smooth, from the notch above his sternum to the musculature of his deltoids. They kiss while Tony explores his torso, the loose and messy slide a sharp contrast to how he traces every ridge and dip with his fingertips. He’s torn between wanting to learn everything right this second, from how Steve reacts to different touches to minute differences in texture, and wanting to move forward because he’s wanted this for so long and now he’s finally getting it, and he doesn’t want to waste a single second.
Tony scratches the back of his neck. “I should have asked, shouldn’t I?”
It’s just a box of cereal, some kid-friendly brand full of sugar and packed with vitamins and minerals to make up for it. Instead of grabbing it, the way his instincts tell him to, he picks up a box two down from it and pretends to be reading the nutritional facts of something with too much chocolate to ever count as breakfast when he hears it.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, taking great care not to drop the contents of the plastic bottle as he climbs out of the window and sticks out his thumb, rubbing it along his eyelids.
When he goes back to the house, he sits at the counter and eats the bowl of rainbow-colored ice cream that Beth scoops out for him.
They pause, cutting each other off, and Tony laughs awkwardly.
“Me?” He doesn’t like the uncertainty coloring his tone.
“Tony and Pepper,” Sam says, and Steve can hear the frown in his voice. “You didn’t hear?”
Clumsy hungover fingertips catch on fine sheets as he nakedly scrambles out of bed, bare feet slipping on pale polished hardwood floors. A glance out the wide wall of windows reveals a fucking
Other hand halfway to tapping out a message to Natasha, Steve freezes, bitter fear coiling unpredictably in the pit of his stomach.
Less than six hours ago, he’d been stupidly hopeful, believing that this could be his way out of borderline poverty-level wages after years of unpaid internships. It’s not exactly that he doesn’t believe it anymore, after a dinner in one of the casino’s insanely overpriced celebrity chef restaurants; after gambling away more money than he’s possessed in his entire life at a table where he hadn’t known a single rule and hadn’t cared a single bit, not when he’d had hot breath searing a flush down the back of his neck, not when there was the occasional heavy hand resting against his hip, a little too low to pass as friendly; after too many drinks, the glass at his elbow perpetually full and the alcohol smoother than anything he’s ever had in his entire life.
“He said nothing bad,” he promises, and cringes at his middle school conversational skills. He’s supposed to be a hired journalist, for crying out loud, not head of the yearbook committee. “I just.” He makes an ambiguous movement with the hand that isn’t clutching his phone, holding out fingers in a poor imitation of typing on a computer. “I did my research. You’re...you’re actually very impressive,” he admits. “But. For the record. Tony did speak very highly of you.”
A loud buzzing jolts him back to the reality of sitting across from a man who will never be able to give Steve what he needs, and therein lies the why of all his questions for his past self.
His phone is on the top of a stack of personal belongings on the dresser, plugged in alongside an expensive bottle of spring water and a tiny packet of Acetaminophen. He checks the pile and yeah, there’re his pants and shirt, his overnight bag from the hotel resting on the floor, everything he owns neatly set up for him. The back of his neck flames as he dresses quickly and downs the pills, images and sensations flashing through his head with varying degrees of legitimacy, because there’s no way some of them aren’t dreams instead of memories.
“I think you can call me Steve at this point,” is all he gets in return, and there’s a goddamn twinkle in those bright blue eyes. Instead of taking Tony’s fork like a normal person, he just dips his head to eat right off the proffered utensil.
“So we like that,” Tony says, releasing the tension in his thighs and tapping Steve on his bicep. “Noted.”
Steve wants to throw his hands in the air and give up.
“You want a comment? I’ve got a comment for you. It’s like, I didn’t even know what I was doing,” Tony says, gesturing at himself and then the room at large. “I didn’t even know what I was doing, because of the adrenaline, you know? But you ask me, and somehow, don’t ask me to explain how, I remember exactly what it felt like to be up there. There was a nuke, you know? And then there was someone in my ear telling me to try and get rid of it. Those are the facts. That’s what I know. But you forget the part of it that has to do with you, you know?”
“Sure,” Sam says, and Steve sips his coffee and watches a perfume commercial, this one featuring a woman in a floaty dress frolicking through a field before the screen switches to a bank ad. “But if you wanted to...”
Morgan gets dropped off with Pepper on Sunday afternoon, because she’s got school the next day and Steve’s flight leaves in the morning. When it comes time to say goodbye, Morgan won’t let go of Steve’s leg.
“I think I’d like that, actually,” Steve says, thinking of how he’d meant to travel the country before happening upon Denise and Josie. “I can’t remember if I’ve ever been to California before.”
“‘Tony Stark is the greatest person I’ve ever met,’” Natasha reads aloud, and Steve feels his ears go scarlet. “‘Which is what I told him I’d say in this article if he followed me on Twitter, and he did.’”
Tony hums thoughtfully, and Steve thinks he has more to say, but nothing comes.
“Don’t worry,” Steve says, crueler than intended, judging by the way Tony’s head jerks in his direction. He takes greater care with his next words. “I didn’t touch anything.”
“Tony,” he says, because he’s even more tired than he was after he married Peggy, more so than when he asked an alternate Tony to send him back where he came from. “Look at where I am. Look at where I ended up. Think about who it was that inspired me to go and get a life, the only life I thought I could have.”
“Let me pass the phone to Sam.”
(From what Steve had managed to glean, it had to do with access to equipment and Tony insisting that he didn’t even know if he wanted a full workshop at the compound if he was just going to be retiring anyway.
Not that he can blame her, he thinks once he’s made it through security and is clutching his boarding pass and a greasy breakfast sandwich that’s only marginally settling his still-roiling stomach. He’s crossed a line, a dozen lines, and while he’s sure that Tony brings people home all the time -
So he does.
By the time Steve is crawling over to him, Tony is just noticing the tube in his hand.
“Who are you?” he demands, bratty and beautiful and not his,
It takes a quick fumble, but Steve pins the box to his side with the inside of his bicep and accepts Tony’s warm palm against his. It’s a solid shake, affirmative and parting, and it doesn’t matter if Tony’s lying. What matters is what he’s chosen to share, and reading between the lines might be something Steve’s used to doing with his subjects, but this isn’t an assignment anymore. In severing their professional relationship, he can finally stop overanalyzing everything Tony does.
When Steve returns, he’s got that furrow between his brow, visible even in the near dark, and Tony sits up in alarm. He orders the lights on and then he can see, can get a good look at what Steve’s got in his hands.
Steve elects not to respond to that, so Tony grabs several choices to drape over the sides of the cart before moving to pajama pants. He’s deciding between black and gray when Steve wheels up beside him, underwear and a pack of one-size-fits-most socks safely stowed away.
“Good man.”
They don’t speak for what feels like days but could be mere minutes. There’s no need. The ambient noise is a pleasant soundtrack, frogs croaking and reeds rustling with every slight breeze.
“Mr. Stark has already left the property,” she says in a tone that isn’t quite clipped, but very close. It’s admirably decisive. “Unless there was something further that you needed to discuss with him.”
Steve just digs nails into palms and stares at the front of his book until it becomes a blur.
“Sure thing, boss,” Tony says.
“Feels like it,” Steve admits. “Wanda was asking for my advice earlier. And I was sparring with Buck, and - ”
“We’ve been trying to simulate the impact of certain celestial forces,” Tony calls from where he’s seated, shaking out his hands. At Steve’s look, he waves to the tools in front of him. “Just cramping.”
“You think I don’t try to do anything for you?” he asks, veins coursing with rage, regret, and an infinite amount of frustration over their inability to ever be on the same page. “You think I didn’t stay away for you?”
Furious at everything, Steve refuses to return the gesture and feels the scraping of enamel-on-enamel as he sets his jaw. If this is going to feel as monstrously terrible as it does, more indomitable than it ever has been, then he’s not going down without a fight. For once, he’s not going to talk himself into chickening out under the guise of doing what’s best.
There’s a wrestle on the end of the line, and Steve exhales.
Sometimes, she looks hesitant, like she wants to press further.
She’s right, of course she’s right, even when he doesn’t want her to be because he’s a man, goddamnit, and his entire foundation of being is built upon not verbalizing anything he actually means.
“I’d be a better friend if I made you get rid of that box,” Sam says, opening the front door.
Steve understands.
“That’s very nice of you,” Rogers says with a quick nod and the ghost of a smile, and then he’s gone.
Tony looks up at him, and suddenly he looks like he’s aged every single one of those years they spent apart.
“Yeah, buddy, I gotta be honest here, that’s not what ‘threatened my manhood’ means. At least not in this century,” Tony says carefully, trying and failing not to laugh.
“Thank you,” she says, inclining her head slightly. “Now. There’s a company car out front waiting to take you to the airport. I’ve had your flight information forwarded to your email, and if there are any issues with the reservation, feel free to contact me. I believe you have my number.”
This time, when he looks up at Tony, he doesn’t feel like an overwhelmed, crushing adolescent anymore. For the first time, he feels like the two of them standing on level ground isn’t the grand improbability it’s always been.
“Yes,” Morgan says, sounding affronted at the insinuation that there’s anything she can’t remember.
“Do you miss her?”
The girls’ eyes go big.
Steve just eats his ice cream. It’s fruity, he thinks, and nothing he would ever pick out himself, but it’s good.
know each other like that, and girlfriends and superhero status only mean so much when Tony’s got this uncanny ability to see right through Steve and avoid prodding all the delicate parts without needing to be told where they are.
Tony takes a breath, wanting to frame this accurately.
“I don’t think my barber does white guys, but maybe he’ll make an exception,” Sam says, and Steve rolls his eyes. “At the least we can get you a recommendation, a little beard oil, maybe do something about those split ends and - ”
“I know,” he says on an exhale, one hand settling on his hip while the other leaches warmth from the mug. There’s a commercial for some cologne on the tv, a ridiculous montage of shirtless men in dark rooms enticing the viewer to buy the product as a holiday present. “I know you won’t.”
help, you know.”
“Yeah.”
Steve chuckles. “You think I’m worried about you giving my secrets away?”
“You seem kinda bummed,” she says, licking her spoon again. “Sometimes I get bummed after I talk to Callie, you know. But Denise says that’s normal, to miss your friends right after you talk to them. Reminds you of what you’re missing.”
There’s the smallest intake of breath before Tony expectantly asks, “Yeah?”
Steve had shoved the magazine back under the bed and let the not-a-relationship fade into mutual indifference.)
It turns out that Tony’s managed to be sweet-talked into driving the teenage boys to school, and Steve loses him as he gets pulled into an argument between Jackson and Serena about who gets to play with the Nintendo on the way to school. Josie has to intervene, pushing them out the door so she can walk them to the bus stop.
Steve’s mouth forms a tight line. He can hear the girls on the stairs again.
And Steve is reluctantly prepared to admit that no, he doesn’t remember much after the strip club and that’s why he doesn’t think that anything about spending time with Tony is a good idea when a vaguely familiar man approaches.
The day has passed into the next and they are all exhausted. Peggy remembers the Stark penthouse and directs Steve through the artificially lit streets while sitting in the backseat, a protective hand curling over Tony’s head where he lies in her lap. She carries him to a bedroom, and Steve hovers until the boy stirs.
. What the hell could drive a man to live that kind of life? He’s barely lived, he’s in that tiny old house, he’s - ”
“Yeah, we both should,” Steve agrees, and neither of them move to actually get up.
“You said you’d always thought you’d kiss me first,” Steve explains, and there’s tension in his shoulders that Tony fights against.
He knows that his presence changes things. He’s capable of helping her, of feeding her and changing her and helping her move around the one-story house he’d had the forethought to purchase years before. They love their little home with their white picket fence and Steve’s garden, the wallpaper in the laundry room and the renovated kitchen that had been his gift to Peggy for their sixtieth anniversary.
“Thank you,” he says, and it seems genuine enough that it catches Tony off guard. Steve must see that, because he elaborates. “Most people forget how I ended up in this body to begin with.”
Tony is too cool to text, too busy, and FRIDAY doesn’t like running interference that way.
And that is a concept Tony can get behind.
Tony pelts him with a squishy grape, and Steve’s face splits with a shit-eating grin, and Tony can’t help but join in on the ensuing laughter.
It’s quiet, too well-enunciated, and Steve’s hand tests the boundary of Tony’s acquiescence to the manner in which Steve’s slammed on the brakes.
“Yeah, you go,” Tony says, voice dripping with disdain. “It’s the only thing you’ve ever been any good at, after all. Hey, let me ask before you go.”
It’s not what Steve was hoping for, but at least it’s something.
So Steve starts talking.
“I didn’t know I’d end up here, though,” Steve whispers, and for a moment the coincidence and enormity of it all takes his breath away.
“Right.” Tony nods. “So. Mind sharing how you ended up here, of all places?”
“I don’t think I’ll start a fire,” Rogers insists, and he’s set his fork down, and Tony almost feels bad when he gets up and dumps the rest of his pitiful snack in the trash.
Still, he removes his hand from Tony’s nape and fights the instinct to wipe his palm on his leg.
“I know you only drink that crappy coffee because everyone expects you to be as dependent on caffeine as the rest of us,” Denise says, and she’s right that he loads it up with cream and sugar because the taste has never done much for him either. “You don’t have to entertain them, you know. You’ve been through as much as they have.”
Pepper’s response is barely audible. “You’ve got a guest, Tony.”
“I don’t know where he is right now,” Steve says, amused. “Focus on finding Bucky, and getting Wanda’s powers under control.”
“To understand,” Steve says, clarity striking. “It’s been - it’s been seventy years for me. I don’t know if I missed something, or if being here changed how you thought of me - ”
Tony, who’ve probably never met him even once - pass judgments and pretend like they know anything, makes him borderline nauseous.
It’s been seventy-three years, Steve thinks. Seventy-three years with a dam firmly in place, and then finally it all cracks into a million tiny pieces. It’s the exact thing he’d been terrified of since he’d first jumped over to that alternate timeline, and it finally happens.
His world has ended a million times over, but this world -
“You don’t have to tell me,” Steve says quietly.
Tony forcibly stabs a piece of underripe honeydew with dull fork tines.
“It’s what he’d want,” Tony says, shrugging against the hard but comforting breadth of Steve’s front. “The cosmos, right? Those insane flowers he was obsessed with?”
“You wouldn’t have,” Tony tries to say. “I was just a kid, you wouldn’t have - ”
“Good question,” Tony says, and he’s well-dressed in a black suit and white shirt with a slash of what looks to be a dark red tie, seemingly the exact color of the shirt he’d been wearing in Caesar’s casino all those years ago, the one he’d shed poolside to reveal acres of evenly toned muscle, and Steve imagines that his face is rapidly attempting to match the same shade. It’s flattering on Tony but Steve doubts the same can be said for himself, and he’s gone to move backward and put some space between him and the interior of the car when Tony looks up, halfway through a sentence that Steve doesn’t really process until it’s too late.
And he makes a smooth exit, clapping Rogers on the shoulder and almost feeling guilty for the way he leaves him to paste on his USO smile and politely greet the incoming guest.
He keeps half expecting the world as he now knows it to crack into tiny pieces, expecting to go crazy, expecting things to go differently than they should. Bruce and Tony had talked about the science of it all, physics and branching timelines and phrases that elude his mind now. He knows he shouldn’t have stayed, but he did, and surprisingly, the world doesn’t end.
“Tony,” he asks, determined to know, “did you want me to come here so I could get to know your kid?”
The relief he feels when Pepper doesn’t look upset, only amused, saves him from worrying.
The problem is, Steve thinks, treading water and drowning in dark eyes - eyes that he knows are the richest of brown, mischievous and magnetic - that he’s pretty sure this isn’t part of the assignment.
Christina sits on the counter with tears in her eyes, and Steve tries to find the right angle at which he can look at her knee without blocking the overhead light.
“You going to give those kids a heads up before you leave them?” Tony asks, and it cuts so deep that Steve thinks it severs his spinal cord, leaving him numb. He hangs up the phone without responding, without trusting himself to speak without yelling, and he doesn’t want the girls to hear all the things he wants to say.
“I’ve got you,” Tony says, there with an easy arm for Steve to hold onto. “You going to tell me what this is about?”
“I’m a friend of your father’s,” Peggy explains gently. “You’re safe with me.”
Steve jerks his head up without thinking, looking at Tony without really meaning to. It’s only once they lock eyes, Tony’s wickedly unfocused, that he realizes he’d sort of been counting on escaping the restroom without a single word between the two of them. So much for that, he surmises, and tries to quell the rising desperate laugh from deep inside of him.
There are towels sitting on a lounge chair. They hadn’t been there before, and Steve hadn’t noticed anyone pass by, which is worrisome because he’s practically paid to notice things that other people would miss. One thing he doesn’t miss, though, is the way Tony’s tiny underwear clings to the very tops of his shapely thighs. He’s got an ass you could bounce a quarter off of, Steve thinks absently, and then feels his cheeks burn as he processes that thought, rubbing his towel over his face to hide the flush just in case the late hour doesn't do an adequate job.
She points out the rest of the rooms, tells Steve that Morgan has her own next to Tony’s on the next floor up, and he says he’ll check out his room later. For the time being, they mosey on back to the common area where Carol is now dressed in jeans and a t-shirt and Rhodes is at the stove.
Under a luxurious white duvet and smelling of expensive botanical hotel shampoo, Steve can’t seem to close his eyes. His fingers want to navigate through his phone and craft convoluted questions, but he doesn’t have Tony’s number, only Pepper’s, and he’s not about to use it. There’s Twitter, but he knows without having to
“No,” Tony says bitterly. “You just left without telling anyone where you were going, without any way for us to contact you.”
“I guess you’ve got a point,” he says, and the way he smooths his hands down the front of his bespoke tuxedo feels like waving a white flag. “Considering what happened last time.”
“I know what I’m doing,” Tony says, but there’s no hint of a protest. Steve’s fingers go to claw at the foreign object in direct opposition to his screaming conscience a split second too late to have any kind of effect, because Tony is wiping at his saliva-slick mouth with the edge of his hand while clambering off Steve’s lap with far more elegance than anyone who’s seemingly consumed as much as he’s appeared to has any right to. It leaves Steve bereft, that icy sensation leaching from his capillaries into his muscles and his skin. “
“I wasn’t aware,” Steve says quietly. “I assumed - most everything else has been the same.”
“I haven’t been able to catch you off guard in more than thirty years,” she comments.
“Finally,” Tony says, stealing a used lime wedge from Steve’s plate and sucking on it. “Someone who gives a shit.”
Steve watches Tony on the other end of the couch as a paused movie is forgotten.
“That he had a secret,” Steve says, his eyes reflecting the moon as he looks up, and Tony watches him intently, beer forgotten on the step beside him as he ignores how their hands grow clammy together. “I don’t think he wanted me to know, at least not at first. But she could see how it affected him, and I think she thought if someone else knew, it would hurt a little less.”
It’s worth the effort it takes to focus because this time he sees a flash of brown. Rich, like the chocolate flowers.
Of course, because at this point, fate practically dictates that the two of them must run into each other whenever sharing a zip code.
He strategically constructs the beginnings of a list, now that he’s in the thick of it and can see the objective a little more clearly. First on the agenda is giving Steve the time he needs to soak up the smell of stale disuse, or whatever it is he’s busy doing wherever Tony can’t see or hear him, but as soon as he gets a chance to intervene, Tony’s going to be demanding dinner and decisions about how Steve was planning on spending his time in town.
He has to arch away from the solid warmth of Steve’s front to fit a hand between them, finding his length and curling around it.
His thumb hovers over
Carol ducked out during the wee hours of the morning, which was a surprise to approximately nobody. Rhodes shakes Steve’s hand and there’s a silent conversation, and Steve knows that if he doesn’t do right by Tony and Morgan, he’ll be getting his ass kicked by the War Machine armor.
“So you’re here by what, pure chance?” Tony asks, shaking his head like the very concept is ridiculous. “You could have stayed there, or gone back, and ended up with your Peggy till the end of time - and instead you’re here?”
It’s the right thing to do, no matter how long Steve’s been ready to tap out. He might be dangerously close to his boiling point, is dreadfully suspicious that it’ll be too late for room service nachos by the time he gets back to his hotel, and knows that there’s a selfish part of him that wants to soak up every bit of Tony’s company while he’s got the chance. For all he knows, they may never see each other again; it’s the same perspective he’s held every time they’ve crossed paths before, and it hasn’t worked out too terribly yet.
Steve thankfully ignores both of them, instead kneeling directly to Tony’s right, and Tony curses under his breath as he reaches for the hem of Tony’s shirt, the strong line of his torso bumping against Tony’s thigh.
As much as he wants to, he knows he’ll regret not getting enough time with everyone.
Steve’s surprised he doesn’t go into cardiac arrest as he stares at the phone.
He thinks he hears Tony reply, but everything fades and he is gone again.
“What, you’re not going to make me use bar soap, are you?”
“Maria’s pregnant,” Howard says, and his eyes are too bright for a man his age. They’re all getting old, even Steve.
Perhaps he’s made a mistake.
“Because that worked so well for you last time,” Steve notes.
“You mean, since you threatened the sanctity of my apartment before falling out of a hole in the sky and convincing my editor that neglecting to show up tonight was a fireable offense,” Steve interrupts, and swears Tony’s smile stretches further than humanly possible.
“We can barely spend time together without hating each other,” Steve says, thinking of Tony’s visit to Houston. “Don’t you think that’s kind of a jump?”
