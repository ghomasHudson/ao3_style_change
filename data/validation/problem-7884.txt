“So what the fuck have these last few weeks been then? If I’m so different then why have you been playing the same fucking games with me that you’ve played with everyone before me?” he demands and well.
“No shit? He’s gonna cry!”
Tony pulls away to blow gently on Steve’s hole, watches it twitch, “I bet, baby. Hey, how about this, how ‘bout you play with that pretty cock of yours. Think I wanna watch my baby jerk off tonight,” he muses casually, and then gets right back to work, swirling his tongue around the soft furling muscle.
“You’re so fucking gorgeous like this,” Tony moans, watching him intently, “I can’t get enough. And you love it so much, you’re so needy. I’ve barely gotta do anything to get you goin’, you’re just so
“Oh my-,” she hisses with pleasure when they go over a bump, “
“In my lap,” he commands. Tony’s eyes droop closed for a second and he shudders but brings his knees up to straddle Steve like he was told. Tony hovers over Steve’s lap and waits for further instructions or the okay to make the next move. “I missed you baby. I missed you so much,” Steve tells him, sliding a thumb past Tony’s plush lips. Tony sucks the digit into his mouth, laving over it obscenely, drooling down the length and watching as his saliva pools in Steve’s hand. With the other hand, Steve unbuttons his jeans, wasting no time with foreplay. Tony is already hard and dripping as Steve tugs his cock from the confines of his briefs and Steve dips a finger into the drop of precome welling at the head of Tony’s dark length to taste. He closes his eyes as if savoring it and Tony squirms in his lap, trying to thrust into the loose grip Steve has on him.
“I’m gonna pretend you didn’t say that,” he chuckles, “Now, hands and knees baby, wanna have your come all over my face.”
He meets Tony, who is carrying a tray with two omelettes, two servings of toast, a bowl of strawberries, a very large cup of coffee, and a glass of orange juice, in the foyer. The two of them stare at each other for a few long, glowing moments before breaking out into matching giddy smiles.
“Excuse me, folks,” he said, trying to sound commanding, “But unless you have a press badge, I can’t allow you to take pictures in here.”
Tony does, Steve shuts his eyes, “Steve, answer me you fucker.”
“Be a good boy and wait, huh? What the hell did I tell you?” he demands.
Finally, nearly two hours later, Tony finds Steve. They had started the night hanging onto each other, Steve saying hello to the few people in attendance that he didn’t hate, but eventually they separated and Steve isn’t ashamed to admit that he was bored and lonely the whole time and is happy to be reunited with his boyfriend. He’s sitting on a bar stool when he feels a gentle tap on his shoulder and turns to find Tony standing there, his eyes gone dark and a grin on his face that’s absolutely uncalled for.
“I can’t believe I’m going.”
, not nearly as thick as the one Tony packed, and purposefully rough as if it hadn’t been properly shaped. It’s beautiful and strange, and Tony can immediately picture himself wearing it. He wants to cry. He wants to scream. He wants to dance. But he can’t move because he’s just so damn surprised.
“Bucky’s gay freak out of senior year, yeah I know.”
Out of all the rooms in the house, Steve’s is the smallest. It might not actually be, that could be Clint’s, but it feels like it. He has this secondhand brown/black desk that’s made out of real wood and carved to hell from his bored scissor drawings and exacto knife excursions. The desk is cluttered with plants, an old jewelry box he keeps weed in, two lamps (one that works and one that doesn’t), a telephone that’s shaped like a Big Mac, stacks upon stacks of sketch pads, boxes of charcoal, pencils, markers, and cups full of brushes, pens, and erasers, and other various office supplies. The drawers are stuffed full of complete drawings and painting, and lots of tape for some odd reason, and everything there is completely and utterly his. Even the chair, this ugly thing his mother was given by an old coworker, belongs entirely to him and no one else. It’s Steve’s, unable to be shared and unwilling to be given away. Tony eyes it, the posters surrounding it, the burger phone, and Steve’s bed with its cheap plaid bedspread and takes a seat, delicately, in the corner next to the old bookshelf that came with the room. He’s wearing slacks and an unbuttoned shirt and he looks like he might clean the entire house with his presence.
and occasionally Clint’s adopted teenage girl, and walk up the creaky old stairs to sit in Steve’s bedroom and admire his wall art. The first time it happened Tony offered to buy him these amazingly expensive ink pens Steve’s been saving up for and after a nice dressing down from the blonde, Tony shut up real quick and just wandered around the space with this horrible awestruck look on his face. Like he was surprised but not, like it was obvious that all of the art in the room (vintage inspired nudes, abstract water colors, contour line drawings, smoky charcoal pieces) was amazing but mostly because it came from Steve’s mind. Or at least, that’s what he said and then Steve could match the look to the words and almost believe it when he was in one of those “I’ll never amount to anything” funks. And when they’re not doing that, Tony takes him on picnics in Prospect Park and shit, like they’re 16, except they ride there in new ugly Ferraris and listen to Soul Coughing really loud.
Steve wonders aloud, “So where’s the truck now?” Clint, sitting on the couch and now sipping his cold coffee from the pot (as in a literal Martha Stewart pot), looks to him forlornly, but not regretfully.
“Yeah. It’s Sam’s place though,” Bucky answers her, flipping through the channels until he finds Rocco’s Modern Life playing on Nick.
The club itself doesn’t look like much. It has a nice brick facade with an awning beneath the sign which further proves its uppity hipster purposes and is likely a sign of impending gentrification. Steve has Opinions about gentrification.
“I can’t,” he tells Pepper. She tsks on the other line but doesn’t comment, “I just can’t do it.”
And that ties a bow on his Saturday.
“It’s not almost like,” Steve says around his mouthful of smoke, “I definitely do. It’s just…weird is all.”
“-and they like trendy uptight shit. Nightclubs, mostly. They’re into raves.”
“Shall I take you home?” he asks, quirking a brow. He’s gorgeous in a dark maroon suit, black button down underneath, watch sparkling on his wrist. The perfect chocolate of his curls look darker than usual in this light, making his cheekbones stand out and his lips appear bright, bitten pink. His posture is casual but the expression on his face is anything but. Tony offers his hand to Steve and Steve takes it as he drops his legs and stands up from the stool he was warming.
Steve sighs, “What would Mama think?” and this time Clint starts laughing too.
“What do you call me? When we play?” Tony asks gravely.
He asks, “Expanding? Like… renovations?” even though he has a pretty good idea of what Tony
“You want me to drop everything for 17 and go to California with you? And do what? Wait around in your hotel room for you to come back and fuck me?”
“Okay, what the hell is up with you?” Steve demands one evening. He’s standing shirtless in the kitchen and washing dishes. His feet are protected by a pair of pink slippers that Natasha had jokingly bought him from Forever 21. Tony—sitting at the kitchen table, typing away furiously and trying not to break into hives at how domestic they’ve become—is caught by how perfect he is. Even slightly annoyed, Steve is a sight to behold.
“Fuck do you want?” Rumlow says, throwing the door open. He’s got a cigarette in his mouth, hand rolled, which means he and Rollins have probably just fought and he’ll give it to Steve real good to let it all out.
“Were you gonna…?” Steve asks dreamily.
When Steve wakes up the next morning, it’s surprisingly peaceful. There’s no Motley Crue blaring from any speakers, Steve can’t smell any gas leaking from anywhere, and when he looks out of his window and towards the street both Sam and Bucky’s cars are still parked, which means they’re both home but neither one of them is yelling. It’s unsettling to say the least, and while Steve pulls on a shirt and his glasses he runs through a series of probable scenarios to explain the state of his home. He pokes his head around his doorframe and looks down the hall, but every door is shut. He considers the possibility that Natasha stayed the night and therefore Bucky is distracted but then Steve notices a jar of mayo is still sitting at the top of the stairs and there’s an electric razor still buzzing on the bathroom sink, so he doubts that’s the case. Natasha would never allow this bullshit on her watch. Steve brushes his teeth with the door open so he can still hear a little bit, just in case his roommate are preparing some sort of stealth operation. If he lived anywhere else this would be called “paranoia”, but here it’s simply taking necessary precautions. Nothing happens though.
It takes a while for Bucky to bring it up, but Steve was waiting so it’s not like he’s shocked when his best friend finally does. Bucky has never been really fond of any of the guys Steve has messed around with, other than himself, and mostly for good reason, so it’s not like his weariness it’s unwarranted. It’s just that Steve is happy and he doesn’t need Bucky’s pessimism to shit all over it. He does that enough subconsciously and it’s nice not having someone else doing it, confirming all his weird self loathing shit.
Don’t get him wrong, sometimes he and Tony do just sit around the penthouse and fuck and blow dank and fuck some more, but even then it’s special as shit, and not just because Tony can afford that
, thank you, thank you.”  And Steve means every word. He’s so thankful, so glad that Tony will always give him exactly what he needs. He wants to get fucked fast and hard until his hole is open and loose and sloppy, throbbing from the abuse, but Tony knows that this is what he needs. Tony knows that if Steve wants to go down to that soft, sparkling place and stay there then he has to pluck Steve apart, unwind him like a piece of thread until he’s delirious with need and pleasure and he can barely speak at all. That’s how Steve really likes it, deep down, but he’d never ask. He likes it when Tony is sweet with him, gentle and all encompassing, surrounding Steve until it’s just their sweat and the constant grind of their bodies taking over all of his senses.
“No I couldn’t! Bucky would have a fucking spasm!”
things because Steve liked them and he didn’t really expect much in return. It was weird, Steve didn’t know what to do with it.
despite also being what everyone else has always understood him to be pierces right through him like a spear. It shakes him to his core.
“You already have a ring babe.”
s as Steve strokes and squeezes, hips gyrating in search of that perfect friction. Normally Steve would stop him, tell him that he takes what Steve gives him, but this time Steve just watches, almost awestruck as Tony takes what he needs. Steve can see it in Tony, the same way he feels it himself; a need that burns through the body like a fever.
“Because it’s new, and soft and the way you treat me makes me feel like I should be cared about the way you care about me. I don’t have to- I’m never the person I was that first night when we’re together. I’m not pretending and I’m not even trying. I don’t have to work for you, you just are,” he exhales shakily. Tony’s hands are quivering when he reaches them out to cup Steve’s face.
prefer to have you in Amsterdam with me, but I—please, I totally get why you can’t come.”
“Same. I like him way better than that Bucky guy,” Sam tosses over his shoulder as he walks up the stairs.
“I love
Kate gasps, “Some guy was following you?” she squeaks.
“Mmhmm,” Tony encourages her, thrusting his cock up into her grip, “I wanna see you. Wanna watch you come from humping my thigh, you desperate little thing. So perfectly slutty, so fucking perfect, I’m tellin’ you. Goddamn you’re sexy, I can’t wait to see what you look like all come dumb. Can’t wait to fuck into your tight little hole when we get upstairs, bet I’ll slide right inside. I bet you’re so fucking
“Oh, oh, oh,
“Please daddy,” he begs. He isn’t even sure what the hell he’s begging for, and the older man must know this because he gives Steve’s balls a mean flick as punishment. Steve positively wails, his body going taut.
mine; you know that? You’re mine. My sweetheart, my beautiful, precious boy. The sweetest little cock hungry boy I’ve ever known. All mine. Mine to fuck and use and play with however I want right?” Steve nods, tugs on Tony’s hair, “Yeah mine. You’re such a good boy baby, you know exactly what to say. I’m so proud of you honey, I know your hole must be so sore and fucked out, but you take it so nicely. Not one complaint out of you, thank you baby, thank you sweet boy, for letting me have you.”
, you’re gonna make me come,” like it’s breaking her heart to say it, like she’s about to really fall apart. Her cunt is drooling all over his face and she tastes so fucking good. Steve is glad he hasn’t touched his cock because thinking about how easily he’ll slide past her swollen, soaking lips and inside her is the stuff of dreams. Toni’s knees tighten around his head and she just falls, suffocating him between her legs and the lovely folds of her pussy.
“Um…sure,” she shrugs. Her thin shoulders are muscular and pale and her collarbones look oh so kissable. Their fingers brush as Tony hands her the glass and she bats her eyes at him with the contact. Tony only smiles wider. She’s too fucking cute. He wants to mess up that hairdo, smear mascara all over her perfect, pale face. He wants to make her blush; her face colored so sweetly back at the hall and he wants to know how far down it goes. Maybe she blushes right down to rosy nipples, or the perfect dip of her belly button. He’ll have to find out. For science.
Steve clenches his toes in the plush carpet, “Daddy. I’m sorry, I won’t forget again,” he swears. Tony nods in approval.
The apartment itself is a whole nother level of holy shit. There’s a foyer, for one thing, but like a real one with shiny white floors and a staircase that actually winds up and into obscurity. In the distance, because there’s a helluva lot of it, Steve sees a sunken living room with fat ass leather couches and a huge TV that likely also includes all of the latest gaming stations. Hell, next to his head is a key holder with 7 different rings for 7 different cars on it.
Tony cups Steve’s pecs in his hands, massaging his thumbs over the abused nipples. They’re so pink and perky, like a woman’s breasts almost, and Tony says as much. He kisses a bruise to the left of Steve’s areola and jabs his finger into it. Steve lets out a low groan and goes completely limp. When Tony looks up at his face he’s relaxed, eyes closed like he’s sleeping. Tony stretches up and kisses his spit slick lips, just as rosy Steve’s nipples.
“-the fuck?”
He babbles, “It’s not! Just fun Tony, this isn’t just fun for me okay- it was never, this could never have been just fun. Not after that first night. Not after that day we spent at the Central Park Zoo, or at Gagosian Galleries when you let me get tipsy off all that expensive champagne. Not- this wasn’t just fun after you sat for 3 hours and let me draw you. This was- I couldn’t lie to you and tell you this has been anything like the “fun” I’ve had, and trust me I’ve had a lot,” he says in a rush and Tony still isn’t breaking, totally unresponsive to his kisses and attempts at affection. Hell, Steve has let the sheet fall and is standing naked in front of him, letting his hands roam all over Tony’s chest and usually at this point he’d relent and give in to whatever Steve wants but not this time.
“Hi,” Tony demures, “I’d kiss you but I’d rather not take a trip to the hospital and explain the second degree burns all over your cock.”
Steve takes one look at Tony (clad in a rare pair of dark blue jeans and a sweatshirt that so obviously doesn’t belong to him) and he knows that there’s absolutely no way they’re going to make it the
Once they return to Brooklyn and they get into the brownstone, Nat deals out blankets for those who can’t really make it up the stairs (Bucky) and those who don’t actually live in the house (Kate) so that they can sleep off the night on the couches downstairs. Kate curls into a ball in the loveseat and Bucky stretches himself out on the sofa in a dramatic sprawl that causes him to groan and wince and hiss like a whiny bitch the entire time. Natasha, a saint, puts up with this mess stone faced and serious while she bandages up his face (which is probably fucked to hell in a non sexy way) and makes him drink water. Tony, an adult, does the same to the rest of the herd and everyone shepherds themselves in their separate directions. He gets to come into Steve’s room.
“Everything’s just so wonderful right now,” Steve sighs dreamily. Sam looks to Kate Bishop and mimes shooting himself in the head. In reply she does a very deft and surprisingly accurate mimed rendition of hanging herself. The whole group watches in morbid fascination as she does so.
getting liver ruiningly drunk, but Sam’s got to go to bed because he’s planning to drive to Hartford to see his sister and her newborn baby and won’t be back until Wednesday so Steve figures he’ll just live a few nights not internally berating himself with Sam’s advice.
“So what is it? Did you…yknow, have you slipped up or something? I won’t be mad if you have, Tony. Really.”
Considering the amount of godforsaken love songs Tony has had to skip over the course of this drive, he is fairly certain that the majority of adults on earth are familiar with the sensation. It is, apparently, a very common affliction. He is not the only person to have ever been shaken to their core by its mere suggestion. It just feels that way.
you!”
Steve takes a step closer, “That so?” he drawls.
They don’t really talk about it though. After their first few conversations about it—Steve telling him he applied for the program, Steve telling him he was accepted to the program, and Steve telling him he was afraid to accept his acceptance—they don’t ever talk about the situation in as many words for quite a while. Steve wouldn’t leave until the beginning of his senior year, so they still have about five months, but Pepper keeps telling him they should sit down and hash everything out so that they’re on the same page. Tony agrees in a logical sense, but the more emotional part of him would love to just ignore his impending doom for as long as possible.
“You could help me pick the venues. You’ve got an eye for aesthetic.”
“Mornin’ sweetness,” Steve greets him beatifically. Tony doesn’t blush but it’s a close call. Instead, to disguise how Steve makes his heart race, he grabs his coffee and takes a long gulp.
“And you and all of your friends smoke like chimneys to top it off. I’m surprised you’re a walker,” they laugh. Tony presses this deep, tense kiss to Steve’s mouth that’s more of a gasping thing than a happy one, but that’s okay. He craves this closeness unabashedly now, he has to.
“You’re so fucking stupid,” Rogers groans, tearing at Tony’s sweatshirt. He pulls it over Tony’s head quickly, and his huge hands wander over Tony’s stomach and chest until he’s cradling Tony’s head in his hands and jerking him forward into another bruising kiss. Tony moans into it, reaching for Steve’s belt buckle and pulling his half hard cock out, not bothering with any preamble. Steve is long and thick, throbbing in Tony’s hand immediately, and he groans when Tony rubs his thumb over his cockhead.
“You like the way I treat you?” he asks finally, breaking the superimposed silence.
“Because I’m
Pits aren’t nearly as dangerous as people think they are, especially if you know what you’re doing. On the day of the Machine Head show Steve and Bucky load up his truck with liquor and weed, but also lots of sandwiches they get from the deli down the street and a metric fuckton of water. Moshing isn’t a joke at the best of time, but it’s definitely nothing to play with in 90 degree weather. Tony watches, standing in the driveway with Sam (someone he’s deemed sane in Steve’s mess of friends) and chatting about how scared he is to die. The night before, Steve had laid next to him and regaled him with epic stories about injuries he’s sustained moshing; an elbow to the jaw, a knee to his ribs once, even the incredibly shocking Doc Marten (sans foot) to the tailbone. Tony hadn’t looked pleased about these things or particularly ready to enjoy this himself, but Steve had assured him it was going to be great.
And suddenly, in a burst of uncharacteristic earnestness, Steve finds himself saying, for some inexplicable reason: “Yeah,” but getting up and walking over to the booth where his friends are to tell them he’s leaving before Tony can reply. When he returns to his spot at the bar, he finds the man sitting there with a sort of puzzled look on his strange, pretty face. He looks nothing like Brock Rumlow, or Max Payne, or Dylan Blanchard from 10th grade English, or even goddamned Leigh Raymond, the nicest guy he’s ever fucked.
“Nothing just fuck me on these Egyptian cotton sheets please.”
“You’re gonna make it up to me though?” he pants.
Meanwhile, Tony glares at him icily, “I want you to say that this fucking means something to you!” he yells, his face becoming flushed. He walks over to one of his dressers and starts throwing himself into underwear and other articles of clothing but Steve doesn’t really care about that. All he knows is that his vision has gone blurry with… tears and he doesn’t know how to make this better but he does know that he wants to. Make this better, that is. If Tony walks away from him Steve will never be able to fix this, he knows that too, and he’ll never be able to fix himself afterwards.
Tony’s apartment is in Manhattan. They go all the way to the Upper East Side in some chauffeured pretentious thing that looks like a hearse and Steve spends the entire ride without a shirt on, showing Tony all of his tattoos even though he’ll be able to get a nice close look once they arrive. Tony oohs and ahhs appropriately at their design and it almost makes Steve blush to have his fingers skittering across his collarbones and his eyes on the slope of his nose. Steve adamantly does not acknowledge these feelings and has another shot of something smooth to help ease his inhibitions.
or have any right to be pissed because we are not dating.”
Friday Steve goes to work. That means he gets up at 7 to go sit behind the counter at Mel’s and watch people pretend like they actually read. There’s maybe 10 patrons all day that purchase something other than the stupidly expensive coffee or porn from the back room, and two of them are teenaged girls reading YA lit about a teenaged wizard boy. Altogether it’s not a bad day. The worst part of it was ringing up some strange werewolf fantasy roleplay porn for a couple that seemed a little too eager about their purchase.
“How’s that? This what you want? Want me to make you come? Won’t even take your panties off, baby, just stuff you full of my fingers right now and watch you make a mess,” Tony rumbles quietly, still stroking over her. Her clit is stiff and hard, obvious to him even though he can’t see her. He wonders how she’ll react to his mouth on her; will she roll and grind sensually, or will she twitch and jump? Does she like to have her clit sucked on, will she grab his hair and fuck herself back and forth on his tongue, taking what she wants from him, or will she lie there and take it when he slips his fingers inside of her and licks at just the right spot? Tony’s dick is stiff in his slacks, tenting between them and aching for attention, but he ignores the pulsing need there so that he can focus on Rogers. He wants to take her the fuck apart, show her how grateful he really is for this opportunity.
“I had to get it fitted this morning,” Steve tells him, breaking the silence. It’s so quiet in the room still, however, that Tony’s heavy breathing becomes the loudest noise around. They stare at each other, so much hanging in the unmoving air between them.
So Tony shoulder checks Rogers on his way out the room, “Right, right. Real mature of our benevolent dictator here,” he calls behind him, slamming the door as he goes.
And Tony always makes good on his promises. He feeds Steve bites of apple and grapes from his own hand, spreads the juice that drips from the fruit over Steve’s lips gently and kisses the sweetness away. His mouth tastes like the whiskey and Steve whines every time he pulls away. Steve’s dick is very interested in the proceedings, but he’s never allowed to touch unless Tony says, so Steve just kneels like a good boy and takes what his daddy gives him.
He has to be buzzed into Steve’s building by a girl at a front desk, but he’s around often enough that she just smiles and lets him up without question. Tony never lived on campus, not even when he was a minor in undergrad, so he isn’t really familiar with the procedures but he’s pretty sure Steve is supposed to come down and sign him into the building. He doesn’t think about the fact that he’s at Brown so much that security doesn’t even feel the need to do it. Tony just attributes it to them knowing who he is.
“Oh sugar, honey,
Steve nearly goes fucking cross-eyed at the words, “Yes, yes, I am,” he insists, “I need it so much Daddy, it’s so good.”
Anyway, Steve’s right and Rumlow is in a pissy mood so after a few rough kisses, Brock’s pushing him into the couch they keep in the basement and pulling his skinny jeans off of his body to jab a few lubed fingers at his hole. It’s a quick fuck, nice and dirty and Steve would be lying if he said that Brock didn’t fuck a mind numbing orgasm out of him. He leaves with a few nice bruises on his hips and wrists, a sort of raspy voice from having his throat fucked, and pleasant, floaty, untouchable soreness everywhere else.
“You most certainly are.”
Tony, Bucky has been spending with Natasha, at her place. Steve doesn’t blame him; having that kind of privacy is sort of addicting and wonderful, and gives one all the liberty to fuck and get fucked all over the place. Plus, Natasha is a grade a woman, the type that studies psychology at one of the best universities in the country but also shamelessly fucks around with and cares about a tattooed mechanic from Brooklyn who only really knows how to fix cars, smoke weed, and have sex. He doesn’t really mind losing shotgun to her.
“Sorry.”
“You’re only to answer R&D calls or emails if you’ve been contacted enough times for it to seem like an emergency. I told Pepper and she says that she’s passed on the word to the developers too. If they know what’s good for them your phone won’t ring at all,” Steve says as they triple check that they have everything. Unlike Tony, Steve packs his things neatly and doesn’t rely on “I’ll just buy it later”. Tony thinks it’ll probably be nice to have everything he needs readily available for once.
“Shut
He breathes turbulently, “I didn’t know what to do, Tony,” he admits, and the older man sucks in a gasp, “I was scared and I didn’t know what to do. Because… because you’re right and I was fucking a bunch of other guys before you and they were all just a means to an end, I guess. They were to scratch and itch I couldn’t reach; they weren’t around to care about me or be wanted by me. But you are, right? You want me and you want me to want you back. And you’re right, I was treating you like them and I should’ve known better than to be afraid of- of liking the way someone treats me but I didn’t- I still don’t really. I’m still scared.”
Tony runs out of excuses after graduation. He has his master’s from MIT, is already considering whether he’s going back for his doctorate’s, and Steve has graduated with his bachelor’s. Their ceremonies are a week apart and that means Tony gets to come to Brown and sit with Steve’s mom and Sam’s and Bucky’s families to cheer them on. When Steve walks across the stage his face is bright red, but he’s smiling so hard Tony thinks his face may crack in half. Sarah Rogers is a tiny little woman but she makes a bigger fuss than all three of Bucky’s sisters put together when her son finally has his moment. He can’t blame her; he’s whooping and screaming too. Proud doesn’t even begin to describe how he feels. When the ceremony is over Steve rushes over and picks them both up, swinging them excitedly in his arms.
. He hates waiting.
“But you think now is?”
“Is that a StarkPhone in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?” she asks lasciviously when her breathing slows. Steve groans, but still smiles at her fondly.
. Blind Melon is blaring from the shitty speakers they keep in the living room and Bucky is trying to scream the merits of the horribly played out “No Rain” at Kate, who’s nodding along a little fearfully but listening to the lyrics more intently than is specifically necessary. Steve doesn’t know where Sam is but the fact that there’s a random 16 year old sitting on their couch breathing in the scent of Bucky’s weed breath is probably the reason why he’s not at home. Steve waves to them and walks into the kitchen to look curiously into Clint’s pan and then moves on to the refrigerator to possibly find some rotten apples to eat instead of whatever concoction Clint has brewing.
Tony grins tiredly, “Sorry, sorry, I know you’re a little too drunk for sass.”
“Okay, so you know that’s not gonna cut it right?”
Kate looks to Steve, as if this proves something. Steve shrugs, “It is for Bucky. That’s just how he is.”
“Right! So I’m like, she’s my girlfriend man, and we’ll
very normal. So juvenile. Young love is so beautiful,” Pepper giggled. Tony could feel his face heating up and astutely ignored her. It was always slightly embarrassing for his friends to acknowledge his small age, even if they claimed they were supportive of him engaging in age appropriate behavior.
“You do as I say, you understand?” Steve snarls, eyes dark with power and uncontrollable lust, watching Tony squirm and making his eyes water with lack of oxygen. When Steve finally lets go Tony’s head is swimming and arousal is lighting him on fire from the inside; he’s so horny his stomach hurts.
“Absolutely,” she confirms, and in the midst of this super charged moment she bats his hands away and climbs into his lap with an unexpected ease and dexterity. Tony’s hands instinctively fall to her small waist and he groans as he realizes that his fingers are nearly touching; his grip nearly encompasses her entire width. It’s heady, feeling like he could break this woman in half but knowing, as he feels her muscles bunch and shift beneath his hands, that anything he does to her tonight is being
“No. No, I don’t think so,” Steve admits, “I think it’s like. For real.”
“I’m into you,” Steve admits gravely. At least, he thinks.
“I know. You’re always such a good boy. Hop to it now,” he instructs with a pat on Steve’s rear. Tony doesn’t acknowledge him further, just expecting Steve to jump to follow whichever directions he’s been given. It’s the little things like that, the small ways in which Tony shows how thoroughly he’s possessed Steve, that make nights like these so delectable. Because Tony is always wealthy, he’s always just a little too much older than Steve, he’s always commanding and alluring, but he isn’t always
“Oh.”
“You gave me a home, Tony,” Steve tells him seriously. When Steve is being solemn and making promises he puts on his Serious Voice. It’s the voice that makes parents, colleagues, and superiors alike trust him. It’s the voice that tells Tony when he’s being and idiot and that Steve loves him. “And I can’t thank you enough for that.”
,” Steve admits breathily. Tony pulls away only slightly before diving in for a kiss. His tongue sweeps across Steve’s bottom lip, delves past his teeth, licks across the planes of his mouth greedily. Steve moans into it, arching towards Tony as if he can’t get enough, letting the older man control the kiss and winding his fingers through dark curls. The kiss goes on for what feels like forever, the two of them sucking at each other’s tongues and nipping at bottom lips like high schoolers in the back seat of someone’s car.
Steve would hate the guy if he weren’t caught in his gravity too.
but she couldn’t help herself and Steve loved it. He loved seeing Mrs. Three C’s, Toni Stark, out of her mind with pleasure, feeling so good she drooled with it, and the best way to achieve that was to let her saddle on up, sit on his face, and fuck his mouth until she didn’t think she could come again. And then make her come again.
“I wanted to be right here Stark,” she tells him, her voice gone low and sultry. She leans back into the seat, her posture soft and civilian as she slouches. Maybe it’s purposeful, but maybe it’s not, either way her legs spread slightly and suddenly the little sliver of skin exposed by her dress isn’t enough for Tony. He can’t help but drink in all the skin on display, can’t help but rest one hand on her thigh and tilt his head in silent question. Tony notices that his hand can almost completely encircle her thigh and it sends a thrill through him. He knows she can tell. Captain Eve Rogers, master seductress apparently.
Tony teases, “How’s that?” lowly. His strokes are slow and precise, but his grip is tight and unforgiving. Steve thrusts into his grasp, his hands going to grip Tony’s shoulders for a little more leverage. As he does though, Tony’s other hand rises from where it was resting on Steve’s thigh and his hand goes to gently rest around Steve’s throat. The action, simple in every way but literally, drags a frantic moan out of Steve, who hurries his thrusts now. Tony gives a squeeze to his throat, cutting off his air just barely, like a warning.
And the thing is, Tony’s been hoping for this for quite some time. He and Steve have a very particular relationship, one based off of mutual stress inducing pigtail pulling that consists of nearly dying and giving in to their more self-destructive tendencies. Every time Tony is forced to watch Steve jump from planes with not parachute, or race to catch him as he dives from buildings with no trouble, his heart drops into his stomach and he simultaneously wants to wring the guy’s neck, tuck him in for a nap, and kiss him stupid. It’s frustrating and he can’t imagine Steve feels much differently when he’s angrily visiting Tony in the infirmary for the third time in a month or prying his unconscious body from the dented remains of a suit.
Instead, “I’m so glad we met,” he admits. The look on Tony’s face is completely priceless, and Steve will remember it even through the blur of intoxication.
“Yeah,” his boyfriend sighs. Tony goes back into the chat so that he can see the way Steve’s eyebrows have pulled together and his mouth has gone all pinched and tight. His heart clenches at the sight.
“Uh, what?” Tony asks eloquently, looking up at his boyfriend. Steve fixes him with a look over his shoulder.
“Yes, you may baby. Come for me, let me see how much you like it,” he says kindly. Steve weeps out his thanks and just as his powerful hips start fucking into the air, just as he squeezes his thighs together and lets himself start to come, Tony lays quick snaps of the cane across his nipples, alternating very fast for the moments of Steve’s orgasm crashing through him.
daddy. Thank you for t-taking such good care of me,” he sighs.
Tony pulls away, and this time flicks Steve’s balls even harder, watches how the jump up close to his body, “What the fuck did I tell you?” he growls, using his other hand to harshly grip the base of Steve’s cock, effectively stopping his movements. The younger man stills instantly, his hand stops flying over his cock and he sobs in apology.
“Yeah. I got my first tattoo in the bathroom here.”
Dexter’s isn’t even a nice club, in fact, it kind of sucks. It’s dirty, like there’s muck caked along the floorboards and shit. It’s terribly insulated, so it probably would be freezing inside if not for the probably unlawful crush of bodies crammed into the building, and if Steve’s being honest, the bartenders aren’t very good at mixing drinks. That being said, it’s also close, cheap as hell, and always full of local talent. Most of the time, bands that are doing the who bar crawl thing are whiny and haven’t practiced enough for anyone to actually understand what they’re saying, but the bands that come through Dexter’s are always good. There’s always some punk playing, sometimes rappers too, and when Steve and Bucky had discovered the place they vowed to make it a regular hangout. Cut to ten years later and they’re still coming through all the time. As soon as they walk through the doors Steve is beelining towards the bar (Tony close behind) while Natasha leads the rest of the group to a booth.
to help her. And then she was afraid to get on the bus, I don’t know I think that guy had been following her or something, so I gave her the keys to Buck’s car and told her to get lost. I took the bus.”
And here they were.
“I’m yours, nobody else’s,” Steve nods. And Steve sinks down into the lowest, most delicious level of that place he loves, makes himself comfortable there as wave after wave of pleasure crash over him and bury him deep beneath an ocean of joy and satisfaction.
That is, until Tony starts to suspect something.
Steve whimpers at the harsh tone of voice, frantic for touch but even more eager for the warmth of his daddy’s approval, “I take w-what daddy gives me,” he states dutifully, “I take what daddy gives me and no more.”
and from how cherished he feels in this man’s hands, positively quakes and pleads, “Can I have your mouth please?
, and my
Tony pauses, “And I want you there. I don’t wanna not see you for 17 days. Plus, who better to keep me in check in Cali then a no nonsense fella like yourself?”
to himself maybe two minutes ago and already he’s about to lose this man. Because that’s what Steve does, apparently. He’s the guy who lets love leave. And it pains him to know that. It pains him to know that he’s had to deal with men like Brock Rumlow and settle for the affection of men who can’t stand themselves, let alone him, and now that he has this real tangible possible love in the palm of his fucking hands he doesn’t know how to treat it because it took him too long to see.
“Bucky’s always yelling,” Steve comments offhandedly, finally grabbing a bottle of water and walking out of the kitchen. His best friend glares at him as soon as they make eye contact and Steve rolls his eyes. Bucky’s the least scary person in this room.
“It’s just—well I’ve never even left the country on vacation before. And my
“He kicked some guy’s ass for her and let her take Bucky’s truck.”
“I brought
“You could not go!”
The four of them ride in Bucky’s truck. It’s this shitty gray pickup truck his stepdad bought him when he was 16 and spent the entire summer of ‘86 fixing it because it was a piece of shit even then. It was a really good bonding experience for them, or at least Steve assumes because after that summer Bucky stopped fantasizing about his mother taking all of Richard’s money and leaving him all the time. The truck has more sentimental value than monetary, as it’s been through thick and thin with them and Bucky refuses to buy a new car even though he could probably afford to now. Instead, he uses most of his skills and freetime keeping the damn thing barely breathing. Steve absolutely loves it and he tells Kate Bishop as much when she crawls into the squashed back seat. She gives him a surprised, but definitely happy smile and goes, “Really?” when Steve tells her that Buck taught him how to drive in this damn thing, which makes the both of them grin at each other in the front seat.
how that fucking feels to me! You don’t call me because you
“Rub yourself off on my thigh? Fine by me precious, I am but an instrument for your pleasure.”
“Sorry ‘bout that fella,” he sighs. The two of them let the moment hang there, breathing each other’s air and allowing the need to build before their mouths are crashing together. They groan simultaneously, and Steve’s cock throbs; he hasn’t heard that noise in three weeks. He devours all the sounds Tony’s making, quiet hums and moans of pleasure at their closeness, and licks across Tony’s bottom lip, and Tony lets them fall open, invites Steve’s hot, wet tongue into his mouth. He sucks on Steve’s tongue hungrily, like he wishes it were his dick instead. Steve brings his hands to either side of Tony’s face, holding the other man still as he licks into his mouth. Tony’s hips grind in a dirty rhythm, his erection a hot brand against Steve’s own straining length.
engraved on the inside. And it’s not the most expensive piece of jewelry he’s ever bought, not by a long shot, but it’s definitely worth more than anything else he has in this world.
After a few minutes, Tony decides that Steve’s had enough of a break and he reaches for the glass of water on the nightstand. Dragging the straw to Steve’s lips, he holds the other mans head up and allows him a few sips before pushing him back onto the mattress, placing the glass back where it belongs, and picking up the cane. Steve’s eyes are still closed so he doesn’t see it. Tony waves it next to Steve’s ear, lets him hear how it slices through the air, and his body goes so taught that Tony thinks he’s coming.
, and I wouldn’t fucking
Natasha at least has the courtesy to roll down her window and turn in her seat, ignoring Bucky’s elitist punk comment, and staring at Steve and Tony in the back, “Hiya boys,” she greets, and blows a cloud of smoke into their faces.
Tony switches to torturing Steve’s other nipple, and as he goes back and forth Steve’s noises get louder and needier. He unleashes a particularly harsh snap, vertically over multiple welts, right on the sensitive little nub and Steve starts to cry. His cock is so hard it’s practically purple. Tony himself is breathing heavily, his own prick a heavy, needy weight in his pants, but he tries to ignore it. He lays a few stripes on Steve’s thighs, instructing “I wanna see you play with your tits,” as he does so. Steve whines, tears slipping down his cheeks, and does as he’s told. He looks up at Tony with pleading blue eyes and squeezes his own nipples, tugging at them and pulling them away from his body, twisting them cruelly. Tony doesn’t allow himself to be distracted, but it takes a great deal of effort. Steve is so fucking hot, he’s so goddamn gorgeous like this Tony can barely stand to look at him. Groaning, Tony continues to use the cane, laying stripes on the bottom of Steve’s feet too.
As soon as Toni is in place, Steve rests his big hands on her hips, and gives her a squeeze. Toni is always trying to direct in the bedroom, trying to be as sexy as possible and put on a show for Steve, but he doesn’t need that. He wants her to let go, give herself over to pleasure, and this is the best way to get her to do so. She looks down at him and gives a tentative smile.
,” Toni screams then, and neither of them stop for a second. Steve knows there are probably tears in her eyes, because every one of her breaths sounds like a chest wracking sob, but he fucks his fingers in and out of her furiously. Crooking his fingers, he rubs them up against the soft fleshy wall of her cunt, the perfect spot, the one that makes her pound her fists into the mattress in frustration. Her hips move quickly; she’s chasing another orgasm. Steve doesn’t let up, sticks his tongue out as she bucks back and forth over his mouth.
“No?”
“I know how badly you’ve wanted me. I can see it Stark, you’re so easy for it. So needy,” he teases. Tony squeezes his eyes shut, orgasm building low in his belly, a coiling hot weight, fighting not to lose himself in the dark tones of Steve’s voice, heart racing, and oxygen depleted brain reeling.
“At Kate Bishop’s house,” he admits.
“Yes please,” Steve grins. Tony moves his hand to the small of Steve’s back, gently guiding him through the thinning crowd of people.
“Yes sir.”
Clint joins in harmoniously, “and talk!” and because this is Steve’s life, Bucky starts cackling like a madman. He really needs to move out of this place. Real friends wouldn’t laugh at their friends’ relationship related calamities or harmonize about them. Real friends would do something nice like take their sad friend out to drink at a club said sad friend’s relationship problem doesn’t own.
They have to take two cars, which is a first. Bucky, Natasha, and Clint get in the pickup and Sam drives the lovebirds in his sensible Mazda. Tony had offered to have them driven in the Suburban but what’s life if you don’t have to worry about navigating your way home in tequila induced haze?
“I’ve missed you, sweetcheeks,” he murmurs into Steve’s ear. His voice is low, gravelly, and he squeezes Steve’s hip as they make their way past photographers. They both duck, hiding their faces slightly, until they’re met by Happy with the Rolls Royce. Tony opens the door, allows Steve to slide in first, and then joins him. They’re mostly silent on the ride home, sharing small smiles and pecks on the lip, but not much more. Tony likes to let the anticipation build.
” type of dates. They leave Steve feeling all blushy and lightheaded and totally unlike himself. He’s never been shown off before and while Steve likes to think he has a great sense of self and propriety, it’s nice to not wonder if the person whose fingers he’s moaning around at night is ashamed of him during the day.
They arrive in the bedroom and Steve doesn’t even pause to be intimidated in the sprawling space of it, instead throwing himself back onto the incredibly plush and extravagant bed and looking up at Tony with a look he knows most men who take him home fall for, hook line and sinker: “So are you gonna fuck me or what?” and as expected, Tony pretty much tears their clothes off and glues himself to Steve from that point forward.
“The teenage girl Clinton has decided to raise,” Sam chimes around the neck of a bottle of vodka.
“As a general rule, no,” he chuckles. Feeling vengeful, Rogers unbuttons his trousers with one dexterous hand and slips it into his briefs. As soon as her fingers make contact with his sensitive cock Tony lets out a very manful yelp. She toys with the head expertly, stroking her index finger through a drop of precome beading at the slit and leaning back to pop that finger in her mouth and suck. The noise Tony makes after that is pure need and he surges forward to capture her mouth in a bruising kiss, she nearly doubles backwards with the force of it. Rogers moans into the kiss, her hand going back to his dick, which stands at attention now between them, looking obscene against the backdrop of their formal wear.
“I uh…- well fuck man I dunno,” he shrugs, “We’re just… together, I guess. It’s more than just fucking. We like, see movies and drive around town together a shit.”
“I think that’s enough,” Tony tells him eventually. He searches Steve’s face, looking for something that he doesn’t find, because then he’s brushing his hand over Steve’s head and kissing his forehead, “Be a good boy and put all that down.”
wakes up there too, it’s rare that he drapes himself all over the other man when they sit and watch movies, he doesn’t even steal off of Steve’s plate. He’s never been a particularly dependent person, if only because he didn’t grow up accustomed to physical affection and the things that make a person that way. Steve’s gotten used to that too, has probably grown to expect the occasional brush of their hands or hugs and is now slightly uncomfortable with Tony rubbing all over him like a cat. Tony winces internally. That would suck.
Tony laughs to himself. He hopes Steve isn’t planning on bringing him breakfast in bed since the chef is going to be round at 9 and that would just be awkward. He follows the instructions though and just stays put, basking in the warm beams of light creeping into the room. He takes time to stretch and pop his joints before deciding that brushing his teeth and making use of the facilities probably counts as staying put. He doesn’t leave the room and go curiously exploring the living room or kitchen. The master bedroom is lofted over the main floor, facing a wall of floor to ceiling windows that boast a truly spectacular view of the mountains; Tony doesn’t even peak over the bannister to see what could be going on downstairs, though the anticipation is killing him. Instead, he lies in bed and thinks about Steve all bundled up and eager to hit the slopes. Steve is blonde and buff and gorgeous, so of course Tony (and most people with eyes) enjoys seeing him shirtless on the beach, but Steve is a winter lover. Perhaps it’s a product of growing up in very snowy New York. No matter the cause, Steve loves snow and can fall into the winter spirit very easily. Tony knows he’s excited to get outside in his snow pants and do all sorts of fun outdoorsy stuff. That’s almost enough to make it fun for Tony, who definitely prefer the Mediterranean climate of his homeland.
Steve finds himself in this weird position of confusion that he doesn’t know how to handle. On one hand, he doesn’t want to end things with Tony. Tony is so much fun; he has such a wonderful sense of humor, and he’s always laughing and despite the fact that he’s, like, old and shit he’s wonderfully understanding and curious and just everything that every guy Steve has ever been with in the past (including perplexing). And Tony possesses this softness, this ease that Steve is more or less addicted to like a drug that actually hits the spot instead of making him trip out of control. Tony strokes instead of grips, even though he also makes fun of everyone and everything relentlessly, and despite the fact that he gets mind blurringly angry sometimes he’s still
“And Bucky?”
say yes and they planned a beautiful wedding, a ceremony at the estate in the Hamptons and they got in front of each other and Tony just…couldn’t say the words. “I do,” Tony dreams. He fantasizes about it, but the notion is far off and clouded by an endless fog of possibility. The chances of this going poorly are too high. He’s run the numbers, and numbers don’t lie.
like this. He doesn’t always treat Steve like a possession.
From upstairs Sam calls, “You need to pull your head out of your ass-,”
“Yes.”
. Your mouth is so perfect honey, you eat pussy like a fucking champion.”
All in all Steve has a pretty good day, even he spoke to maybe 5 people for longer than 30 seconds.
“No that’s not the question,” he practically purrs, twisting his hand just so and making Tony see stars. He tries to kick Steve off, put up a bit of a fight, make it seem like he’s not so gone on this, but it’s no use, and that only frustrates him further. “The question is, why pretend like you don’t fucking want it, Stark? Why get me all riled up like this? I’ve known this whole time, I’ve just been waiting for the right moment to get you alone, work out some of this pent up energy, yknow?” he rambles.
“Hey there, soldier,” he chuckles, rubbing his hand over Steve’s back. He’s like a giant puppy. Even with his bulky muscles and sometimes severe eyebrows, Steve is really just the cutest thing. Tony wants to bop his perfect nose. It’s humiliating.
“You loser,” he laughs wetly, kissing the corner of Steve’s mouth, “It’s okay to be scared of something you don’t understand. But it’s not- you don’t run, Steve. You’re not a runner.”
Steve does as told and comes so hard he barely remembers how to talk.
“Good.”
“For obvious reasons.”
“No, we’re not. I don’t even know if we’re exclusive, Clint. He could very well be
“Exactly,” he winks. She’s facing forward and Tony catalogues all of the random information he can. Her slender nose is slightly crooked, there’s a scar on her jaw, too-short pieces of hair have escaped her smart updo and now curl prettily on the back of her neck, her lip gloss has lost a lot of its shine. “Would you like a drink?” he asks her. Tony’s almost positive she’ll say no, because he’s learned that she’s quite staunch and stubborn, but he reaches across her lap to grab a bottle of champagne and two flutes anyway. He could definitely go for some scotch after a long night of pointless schmoozing but he knows how that might look. Tony maintains eye contact as he pops the cork and pours two glasses. Happy pulls away from the curbs smoothly and Tony leans back into the cushions of the seats as he stares Eve down.
Tony goes completely still though. Like, stops breathing, the smile that might have been on his face completely gone, the arms wrapped around Steve’s skinny frame slack in their grip still, and Steve is even more confused. The night had been one of their better ones; no fighting just fucking and a shared tab of something special, and the morning was going okay, if a little rocky. But that was expected, Steve was used to this now. When they weren’t fucking or were sober, they weren’t the same, and he got that it was his fault, but never this. Never has Tony ever gone from
“I’m just happy,” he shrugs, beaming. He adjusts his bow tie, looks at himself in the mirror proudly. It’s true.
ready and Steve
Steve, whose face warms up at the sight of the shy tugging
Steve quakes with relief; his dick is so hard and hot and aching, he could practically cry as soon as he wraps his hand around himself, “Thank you daddy, thank you so much,” he cries, and begins stroking eagerly. Tony hasn’t told him how fast he’s allowed to go, so Steve just lets himself have it, jerking himself fast and rough. His cock is wet with precome and he barely needs to spit in his hand to get himself wet.
and Steve’s face would crumble in on itself like a building or a broken glass. His eyes would fill with fat, sad tears, his mouth would turn down at both corners and that little line between his brows would be so deep and unfortunate.
to this person lying under Steve right now.
“To a death metal concert?” Tony says absently, “totally. I love death metal. Metal and death. I love that.”
“Motherfucking Christ,” Toni spits, “I’m gonna come so hard—I’m gonna come on your face—fuck, your gorgeous fucking face. Baby, goddamn, goddamn, suck on it like that,” and she continues on like that, fucking her clit at the perfect angle to light herself up. Steve loves being used like this by Toni, he loves watching her take what she needs like this. She gets so—so fucking riled up, is all, and she can’t be tamed. It’s like watching her unravel or strip.
They look at each other, heads tilted in mild confusion. Neither of them have ever been in a situation like this, one that warrants discussing
“You wanna come to California with me for a few weeks?” he asks casually. Steve strips down to his boxers before answering, even though his stomach is on the floor and his heart in his throat at the question. He pretends, almost, like he didn’t hear the words to come out of Tony’s mouth, for fear of something embarrassing and altogether stupid coming out of his own.
been fuckin’?” he wonders incredulously. Who the fuck denies breakfast in bed. In a California king bed, at that.
“How’d he get back?” Steve asks, looks at Clint “How’d you get back? Weren’t you driving the truck? Why have you decided to raise a child without consulting us? Where did the girl go?”
“Yes! Is this about the award? You know I would come baby, but I can’t just leave the country for two weeks, I have-,”
Bucky narrows his own, “I’m in love with a woman. I told you about her, like twenty minutes ago. Natasha?”
Pepper’s plans consist of lots of blues and yellows and she made it very clear that no one was to wear white. No one stands with them, as it would be odd to have groomsmen at such a small affair. Happy runs security and is allowed to be as ridiculous and strict as his heart desires because he knows how Steve feels about their photos being taken without permission. Tony wouldn’t care if Perez Hilton had decided to break in and install cameras in the bedroom, so long as he got to have Steve the way he’s wanted him for so long. He’s nervous and scared but he’s ready, he wants this.
, and it was all very stressful, as one could imagine. Tony could imagine, obviously, because it’s not like Steve had told him how stretched thin and anxious he had been feeling, but his boyfriend just knew. Because Tony knew him better than anyone, maybe even better than Sam and Bucky. In just a year he had managed to dig himself a home in the deep, empty parts of Steve and set up shop. Hell, he’d started making repairs. Steve loved him and feared him for all of the power that he held.
“I’m sorry,” he admits.
“First of all, this is your pity party, not mine,--” Sam begins, just as the front door is thrown open. It shakes on its hinges, the knob makes a small dent in the wall behind it, and Clint emerges from the shadows and tumbles into the house. Sam lets out and indignant scream and Steve jumps about ten feet in the air.
Steve rolls his eyes, “That and then some.”
,” Steve sighs happily, “You’re here.”
“Alright girls, Tony’s head is already too big for his body, let him alone,” Bucky gripes, but he’s laid out in the grass looking an awful lot like a cat that got the cream so there’s not any bite in his words. Steve is spread out next to him and Tony wants to lick the slice of skin exposed between his shorts and where his shirt has ridden up, but he knows that’s inappropriate. The day has been so perfect. He thinks about the box with the ring in it, sitting now in the sock drawer at his apartment back in Boston, and he’s about ten seconds away from jumping in his car and driving home to go get it. He can’t be away from Steve though. Being in his presence when he’s this happy is like standing next to the sun.
They go shopping too, and Sarah Rogers is a lot like her son in that she doesn’t expect anything from anyone, but Tony can’t help himself. The woman responsible for raising the person Tony is starting to consider the love of his life all on her own deserves some kind of gratitude. He goes ahead and buys her a dress that he caught her eyeing in a window and then he finds a purse that would go perfectly with it. Sarah’s just as stubborn as Steve too (it’s obvious where he gets it from), so Tony has both things mailed to their home address to ensure that she accepts the gifts. At night when she goes back to her hotel she gives both of them a hug and a kiss and the gesture warms Tony right down to his toes. Steve gives her his class ring and they both cry.
And Steve, who is about to fucking come just from this, from this adoration and
“Tony please,” he whines, “I want your mouth on my hole,” and he shivers with the words. His legs are hoisted over those perfect shoulders, crossed at the ankles around Tony’s neck all in the same motion.
In the morning, Tony rolls over to find himself alone in bed. It’s not surprising. Most of the time, if he actually makes it to sleep at the same time as Steve, his boyfriend will rise earlier than him to get his run in. He isn’t sure if Steve is running this morning, but he’s always been an early riser. What is surprising, however, is the little sticky note attached to a pillow.
“Fuck me,” Clint groans, lowering himself onto the ground and sprawling on his back. He kicks the door shut and toes off his Adidas and just lies there breathing heavily. Steve looks over at Sam, whose eyes have gone pinched and tired like he wants to say something mean but knows it isn’t worth it, so Steve just hands him the pipe. It’s incredible how much marijuana can fix when applied in the right doses.
Kate makes a face, “You said she could step on your trachea and you’d probably enjoy it.”
“Oh, I know baby, you’re such a good, clever baby boy aren’t you? You know who you fucking belong to? Smart cookie.”
“I’m very well, thanks,” she grins, giving a positively filthy roll of her hips, “I think I’m going to sit right here and-,”
The entire group turned to stare at him, various looks of disbelief coloring their faces. They had been slow to put away their smart phones and Nikons but Steve just kept giving his best disappointed, stern look and eventually they disbanded. The man and woman who’d been surrounded by fans turned to look at Steve, and suddenly he was hit with the full force of Tony Stark’s biggest grin.
“So what? This is just fun to you?” he asks angrily. Steve is sitting on feet, his eyes wide in shock at the whiplash change of heart he’s seeing right now. His fingers grip the sheets covering his hips nervously.
,” he preens, quieter this time. Tony is even happier than when Steve got home from France.
Steve bustles around the kitchen quickly. He grabs Tony’s favorite crystal decanter and fills it. He takes a glass as well, pours exactly how much Tony allows himself to drink, from the fridge Steve takes some grapes, slices an apple, and places the fruit in a small bowl. He sets all this on a tray. Steve stops in the hall to turn on the AC as well, and then makes his way back to the bedroom, anticipation making the hair on his arms stand on end. His cock twitches in his briefs.
“Thanks for the assist, Gramps,” he chuckled, looking Steve up and down appreciatively. Steve felt his cheeks warming but refused to acknowledge his own embarrassment.
this is not his life.
Tony’s thrust become misplaced, erratic, and then his big, calloused hand is wrapped around Steve’s prick. The sensation is so sudden and so fucking amazing that Steve goes stiff, his entire body tensing, muscles coiling, and his asshole must clench up too because Tony positively yells at that, lifting himself off Steve to pull his long legs up and over his shoulders. He’s even deeper then, his cock sinking in heavily to the twitching, hot flesh of Steve’s opening. Tony shudders, “Come for me baby. Be a—be a good fucking boy and come for me. Wanna see my baby come,” he bites out.
“I wanted you in bed when I came back.”
Tony buys a ring the next day while Steve is as work. He doesn’t know Steve’s ring size but he does his best guessing, and he tells the jeweler on 5
Now Tony sucks a bruise into the thin skin behind Steve’s ear, licks wetly over the spot in apology, nips at his earlobe, and twists his hips so that Steve cries out before saying, “C’mon baby, be a good boy and tell me how good it feels. Tell me what you want me to do to you baby, tell me, I wanna know.”
. He’s crying. He sniffles for good measure, in case anyone in their small audience couldn’t tell how pathetically in love he is.
“You finished testing,” Steve pulls away to check the time, “like three hours ago.”
“Now who’s being a brat?”
. She can be so infuriating, seemingly so thoughtless and immature, to the point where you almost want to knock her down a peg, but that’s not who she is. Toni is loyal to a fault, so smart it makes your brain hurt, and secretly sweeter than honey if you manage to claw past her hard exterior. Steve is absolutely whipped, and he’s sure anyone that’s looking can tell.
Maybe that’s what makes Tony so—this is why Tony gets all shy about it. Being with Steve isn’t anything to be ashamed of, and he’s made enough terrible mistakes in his short life to have done things that are really and truly disgraceful, but the way he wants more is so…stupid. He knows that 50% of marriages end in divorce, and he knows that he (still) drinks too much, and he knows that Steve is only
“Oh fuck, nah she ain’t dead, she’s just in Boca. A sort of paradise I guess, if you’re 92 and want to pretend you’re one of the Golden Girls for the rest of eternity.”
Tony swallows down the tears threatening to escape him, “Yes,” he says certainly. Because even if he is scared, he’s sure that he wants to give Steve his hand. They don’t look away from each other as Tony slips the ring onto the appropriate finger. Steve inhales sharply.
“Please don’t be rash about this,” Tony says over Facetime a little over a year later. He doesn’t Facetime anyone but Steve, who pretty much despises texting and will call to say things as simple as good morning. It’s both endearing and inconvenient.
For one thing, Steve and Tony’s relationship is very unique for both of them. Though Tony has a much more extensive sexual background, he’s only ever been in two meaningful and monogamous relationships, and one of them ended in utter heartbreak. He’s never had anyone that cared for him the way Steve does, someone who wants to see him smile and laugh for absolutely nothing in return; someone who pushes him to be the best version of himself without making him feel bad about who he already is. Steve has never asked about any wrong Tony has done, has only ever held his hand and listened if Tony ever wanted to talk about his past, and that is more valuable to Tony than anything. Tony trusts Steve implicitly, he feels safe with Steve, and there aren’t many people alive that can say as much.
Clint takes another drink, “You’re not,” he deadpans. Lucky
Eve rides out her orgasm, still and quivering with the force of it, sighing and whimpering to herself like the orgasm had been painfully wrenched out of her. Tony gathers her small frame up into his arms, fixing her dress straps and rubbing a soothing hand over her back as she pants moans with the aftershocks.
Softly, Tony murmurs, “What do you mean?”
“Is that so? You’ve not been sleeping?” Steve asks. Bringing his hand away from Tony’s mouth he spreads that wetness all over the hot swell of Tony’s dick. The other man groans aloud, pretty brown eyes rolling backwards as he’s finally offered some stimulation. Steve’s hand is big and warm, engulfs most of his length in a perfect sleeve for him to fuck into. Tony plants his knees firmly for leverage and thrusts into the circle of Steve’s hand.
stop fuckin’ followin’ my friend around and shit” and I’m like okay well the only person included in this conversation that’s not present is Nat-,”
“Yeah. And then I had to be the one to tell that guy to fuck off once and for all while he was on the ground,
Tony raises a brow, “To stupid to understand what, exactly, Steve?” he challenges, and makes up the space Steve has put between them by stepping forward. Someone, he assumes Clint, sucks their teeth in exasperation, and then a door slams, signaling that they’ve left. Tony doesn’t look away from the other man though, tilts his chin up defiantly as they stare each other down. The tension in the room is thick, palpable, and something about it has Tony’s dick twitching in interest.
or his asshole would be to invite his soft ass to a fucking Machine Head concert. Where the music is loud and vulgar, and everyone is as pierced and tatted as him and Bucky, if not more so, and just as angry. Plus, there’s the added fearful bonus of the
Sam clucks sympathetically as they come into Steve’s view, “I know buddy, but you also can’t just give away Bucky’s truck. He needs it to get to work,” he drops the keys to his own car, a sensible Mazda, on the counter next to Steve’s ankle. So that’s why Bucky was screaming bloody murder. Steve nods his greeting to Clint who just nods back in the sad way that a scolded child might. He represses the urge to roll his eyes.
“And why’s that my beautiful, sweet, baby boy?”
And who is Tony to deny Steve what he so desperately wants? Tony flicks the cane over Steve’s right nipple immediately. It lands with a quiet snap and Steve gasps, his hands clenching together as if in prayer or thanks. Tony repeats the action, and then again just a little lower. Steve’s wet mouth is open, panting and he just takes it.
In New York Steve splits his time between Brooklyn and the mansion in Manhattan. He goes back to his same summer job every year, spends some of the day with Bucky and a few of their acquaintances in the neighborhood, and at night he comes out to Manhattan to be with Tony.
“Hey Nat,” Steve smiles.
“No,” Tony shrugs, playing with a loose thread in his blanket. They’d never really talked about it.
Steve’s scowl deepens, and he takes a step forward in those ridiculous boots, “You know what? You’re right. We did cover this,” he’s in Tony’s face now, his eyes bright with rage, “Guess I’m just confused as to why a genius like you is too fucking
“Well yes. You seem to be an upstanding citizen of this lovely country of ours. It seems odd that you’d even consider retiring for the evening with a rapscallion like myself. I mean, we’ve all heard the chatter,” he chuckles. Eve raises an eyebrow at that.
“I know. I missed you too.”
Tony starts to jerk them off faster now; one hand moves purposefully over their hard lengths, pressed together, and the other hold steadfast around Steve’s throat, watching how it makes him go pink as he gulps in air. It’s heady, giving this much over to another person, telling them they have the power to decide when you get to fucking
And Steve knows why Tony wants him to say it; nothing gets Steve blushing like the slight embarrassment he feels at having to—to tell Tony the way it feels with the bulging head of his cock finally pulls free from is puffy, wet hole or explain why it gets him so hot and needy when Tony presses his face into the mattress. It’s just so—it’s terribly vulgar, is all, and Steve doesn’t think it’s all that sexy when those kinds of words are coming from his mouth. But he wants to be a good boy, wants to be the best thing in Tony’s life and if this makes him good, if that’s what will unlock all those sweet words from Tony’s mouth then he’s going to do what needs to be done.
“Me,” she murmurs surely and simply before giving one of his pecs a particularly harsh bite. Tony sucks in a deep breath through his nose and gives up all pretenses of self-control. Faster than either of them can really process Tony worms one hand between them, manages to get his fingers on that elusive flash of lace so that he can rub at her cunt over her panties. He feels the heat there, how she’s so wet that she’s soaked through her pretty underwear and rubs over the nub of her clit gently. The way Rogers writhes at the sensation, going still only to tremble bodily, encourages Tony further and he presses just a bit harder, trying to find how she likes it. Eve loses focus and buries her face in his neck, panting hotly as Tony’s nimble fingers work.
“You just look out of it. In a way that’s eerily similar to-,”
“-When the dude elbows me in the side of the head. Literally winds the fuck up and elbows me in the head, and then I’m dizzy and still tryin’ to fight and he just shoves me across the floor and puts his knee in my stomach and this twisted piece of dried dog shit headbutts me like we’re in a goddamned movie Katie, I shit you the fuck not. I’m ‘bout to be down for the count, y’know because he did get me pretty good and he’s still punching my face in, when I manage to knee him in the gut, and dude fucking almost pukes. So, I know when to bow out of some shit, and I’m trying to get up and get away, y’know get my last few words in, when security rolls up and they pick me and Steve,- who somehow got hit in the face during all this? I dunno,- up off the floor and we get tossed. Meanwhile, Nat’s standin’ at the bar shook out of her mind because she just watched me nearly get my ass kicked and thrown out of the bar for some unknown reason,” Bucky finishes breathlessly. Suddenly, Natasha brings them all to a hault, props Bucky up on the wall of an alleyway, and glares at them collectively.
“I was going to do that for you,” Steve laughs.
At this, Lucky opens his one eye and peers over at the two of them judgmentally. Steve’s face goes red in rage, because what the fuck does Clint’s dog know, and Sam sputters out a laugh, “That’s just pitiful,” he giggles helpfully. When the pipe is back in Steve’s hand he smokes the rest of the bowl with no consideration for Sam whatsoever, and then quietly stomps up the stairs to his room.
Bucky doesn’t blink, “You and Tony are…? What? Fucking? Dating? In love?”
“More than you love sex with me?”
Sam groans, “Oh god,” he mumbles dazedly. He’s right. This story is a mess and Bucky launches into it merrily, much to the disappointment of everyone but Kate and Clint.
Sam sighs behind him, “And that’s what you missed on Saved By The Bell.”
Tony blinks. Perhaps he’s been weirder than he thought, if Steve is guessing that he’s
Eve rolls her hips again, her free hand going to play at her stiff nipples. Tony pulls one strap of her dress off her shoulder so that he can see her breast bounce free. Her nipples are such a sweet shade of pink, like strawberries and cream, and he knocks her hand aside to pinch and play with the little nub until it hardens at his ministrations. The residual wetness from her pussy makes her nipple glint in the low light streaming in from the street outside, and Tony pulls her closer so that he can get his mouth on her. He sucks at her nipple sharply, like he’s trying to bruise, before lacing gentle licks around the areola as if in apology. When he starts to place quick bites around the soft weight of her breast, Eve throws her head back and sighs and frees the other, grinding her hips like she’s riding his cock. Her hand never falters on his dick, stroking slow and deliberately, making slick, vulgar noises. He doesn’t know how long they keep up their rhythm, he doesn’t even know how it’s taken them this long to reach the Tower, but he can’t be half assed to care, not when the sexiest woman he’s ever seen is currently using his leg to masturbate. Like he’s a pillow or a particularly active vibrator.
, in this moment, is everything.
“Thank you, thank you, thank you T-Tony, sir, thank you. That’s so good, fuck, thank you!” he screams, writhing around as thick streams of come spurt across his rippling abs. Tony groans right along with him, rubbing his hand over his trapped cock for some relief.
“And what do you say after?”
Of course, just because Tony knows that Steve is going to go doesn’t mean Steve actually says it. And just because Tony is truly happy that Steve gets to go doesn’t mean he wants him to either. It would be incredibly, painfully selfish for him to ever say as much but Tony wants to keep Steve as close as possible at all times. The fact that they can’t sleep in the same bed every night and spend all of their free time together already drives him insane; not even having long weekends or random day trips is going to kill him. But he wants Steve to look back on his life and have no regrets, whether Tony is in his future or not. And Tony doesn’t want to be a regret himself. He wouldn’t ever be able to shake the guilt of knowing that Steve didn’t do what made him happiest just so that Tony could have someone around to cuddle him and stroke his ego. That would be…just not good.
“I’m gonna get to work now,” Tony warns,” You just lie back and enjoy.”
“Yeah baby? You like that?” Tony asks, delivering a deep stroke that makes Steve gasp and whine and go stiff, “Tell me about it, sweetcheeks? You talk to me now.”
“I…” he tries, and then tries again, “I don’t… know.”
Tony’s cock is a nice length, pretty average in that department, but Coke can thick and he forces Steve’s tight asshole open with 4 fingers before he’s pressing in with his dick. They go bare for the first time, a wordless agreement, and both of them let out needy moans at the feeling. Tony forces Steve’s legs over his shoulders and around his neck so he can get his mouth on Steve’s hole and that’s it; he’s totally done for. He’s heaving in these huge wheezing breaths and he’s probably tomato red and Tony just keeps growling low in his throat, and coming up for air and to encourage Steve to be as loud as he want. Tony calls Steve his “good boy” but the possessiveness in his tone is what gets Steve’s cock dripping. He’s never been someone else’s, he’s never wanted to be, but to be
, helping her along, bounces his leg some more, “Fucking come for me, pretty girl. Wanna lick you clean as soon as we’re alone,” and that’s it, she’s done.
“I… Tony what do you want me to say?” and Tony
“Of course. Look,” and Tony squirms until Steve frees him and he can rummage through his suitcase. The little black box is carefully hidden so that Steve’s little folding fingers never would have found it while he double and triple checked that Tony had everything. The velvet is soft and purposeful beneath Tony’s fingers. He turns shyly, facing Steve and presenting him with this box that has held Tony’s entire heart prisoner for years. He opens the box and sees the ring, one he usually didn’t allow himself to look at because it just got him too worked up. Thinking about the way it would look on Steve’s hand filled him with so much love Tony suspected he could float away like a helium balloon or sink to the bottom of the ocean like a sunken ship. It was nearly embarrassing except here Steve was, blushing and grinning and looking the way Tony felt.
“Confused? Yeah, he is,” he says, looking back at Steve from the driver’s seat, “What are you doing? Get up here. And what the hell are you talking about? What happened to all of you?”
“You don’t know shit,” he spits, voice wrecked. Rogers just chuckles and squeezes their members tighter, playing in the precome they’re both leaking.
The man grins, a sharp easy thing that reminds Steve of an ex sex partner he was particularly fond of, “You look desperately out of place, lost even, if you will. I thought I’d make myself a familiar face for you to latch onto.”
“I’m close already,” she mutters. Steve takes that as his cue to stop trying and let her have her way. He licks a small circle around her clit before sucking it into her mouth. Toni grunts and thrusts her hips forward only to keep them where they are. She keeps her movements small and tight, grinding in a hard figure 8. Her right leg shakes harder, like she’s having a muscle spasm. “I’m so motherfucking
“How would you like a little treat?” Tony asks. Steve just blinks at him. He’s so sweet like this, when he’s under. Steve sinks into that perfect place, lets himself be led instead of bearing the weight of leading all the time and it’s so beautiful. Tony’s pretty sure he barely understands English at the moment. “Hm baby? You’ve been so perfect, let me make you feel good, okay?” Tony babbles. It takes him a few moments to process but then Steve is smiling, a sloppy, exuberant thing that means he’s obviously pleased. He nods slowly. Tony smiles back at him and pats the corner of the bed. Steve unwinds all of those gorgeous muscles and crawls over—the chain connecting the nipple clamps dangling—so that he can climb up onto the bed. He lies back, sprawled out and looking like a wet dream.
“And the dog?”
“Romantic, even.”
They’re quiet for what seems like an eternity, only the sounds of their heavy breathing filling the air, and in that eternity Steve ages maybe a million years. Saying those words took something out of him and despite his flushed face and heaving lungs, he feels calmer. It’s settling to have that in the open: his fear. He was afraid, it’s as simple as that, and now that Tony knows Tony can make a decision and Steve can stop living in fear. He can deal with pain, but fear is something else. Fear is crippling and he’s hated being afraid. He’s hated not trusting that Tony wouldn’t want him to be afraid.
“They’re all gone,” a voice says suddenly from behind the refrigerator door. Steve, with a carton of orange juice in one hand a bottle of Corona in the other, turns and immediately tries to brandish the beverages as a weapon. Except it’s just Tony. Tony in a pair of
“Oh yeah? And what does that s-say about you, Captain? Following me here like a lost fucking puppy? You must be desperate; you must need this even more than I do. I could have anybody, yknow that? I don’t-don’t
He snarls, “Yeah, there. I said it. I bet that fucking hurt right? To be treated like the one thing you never want to call yourself.”
And Steve, who is a reasonable person and knows a thing or two about how men who fuck him work, gives Bucky a look that reflects how absolutely impossible and shocking the words he’s just said are, “What the fuck?” he asks, for good measure.
Low in Steve’s gut, arousal builds. He’s been half hard since his third glass of whisky, and that was before he caught sight of Tony running his hands through his hair, loosening the collar of his shirt. That was before he got to be close to him again and could smell the musky spice of his cologne, feel the strength in his grip as he held onto Steve. It’s nice to be in Tony’s sights again, it makes Steve feel like he’s in his care, under his protection, trapped in being possessed by the world’s most secretly possessive man.
Tony considers this a close call and goes about monitoring his behavior from then on out. He does go to the lab and work with Bruce, like he should be doing. Everyone there is a little shocked to see him, which means he’s definitely been shirking his responsibilities, but Tony just claims to have been busy moving. Bruce does not buy it. Tony stops offering to buy Steve a car and instead buys him a CharlieCard like a reasonable person. Steve gets a big boy job. Sarah visits the apartment. Tony goes to Amsterdam to accept an award from a bunch of stiff theoretical physics and he brings Bruce. At one point they even help Pepper move and Tony drives a big ass U-Haul all the way to D.C. They celebrate their four year anniversary in September and Bucky gets so drunk that he throws up on Sam’s boots. Things are great. Steve suspects nothing. Everything is perfectly normal.
Stark, your fucking mouth. Do you ever sh-shut the hell up?” she groans, eyes rolling as she finds a particularly favorable angle to rub up against him.
“Yes,
“What even happened?” Kate Bishop asks curiously once they’ve safely rounded the corner. She must not be as drunk as the rest of them because when Kate gets even slightly tipsy, she’s just as rowdy as Clint himself. The fact that she’s Steve’s size means that she reaches this point about 3 drinks in.
“I’ve never needed saving. I’ve never needed anyone to promise me they’d be there in my darkest hour, or tell me they’d do anything to protect me. I’ve done those things for myself too many times over to need that, or to trust anyone else to do it. But Steve, honey, I trust you. You’re like…my hero,” he laughs, feeling half crazed with the emotions that are flowing through him, “You’re the man I trust to help me save myself.”
Tony doesn’t look away from the screen when he says, “No but seriously, I’ll go with you if you want me there.”
and needy already. I know you missed me baby, I see the way you’re falling all over yourself. Like a horny teenager, like you’ve never been touched before. I know you’re close already too,” he growls. Tony whines and the movements of his hips become erratic, sloppy. He’s humping into any friction he can find now, rubbing himself into Steve’s palm and the deliciously wet length of his shaft, pressing his cockhead against the fold of Steve’s foreskin; he wants anything he can get. Steve likes that, chokes back a moan of his own at the sight of such lewd desperation in his lap. He’s rock hard, leaking like a faucet and panting as if he’s just ran around Manhattan island twice. He licks around the shell of Tony’s ear and allows himself to groan quietly so that he can feel his boyfriend shiver.
“I don’t listen to the chatter. I figured you didn’t either.”
“Yeah,” Tony nods.
“I’m being clingy?”
“A proclamation of love if I’ve ever heard one,” Clint sarcastically calls from the kitchen.
“And you want them to be?”
“You two aren’t- okay so you aren’t fucking him?” she looks at Buck, “He wears your clothes. Like every time Clint mentions one of you he mentions the other as well.”
this is not my life,” he says in awe as they step through the threshold. The floors are this weird tan color like sand, but classy and not annoying, and everything is decorated in neutral shades of beige and brown with the accentuation of green everywhere. It’s like stepping into the desert, but with A/C and a California king bed.
Steve’s research includes interrogating this weird couple that comes into Mel’s every Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday about things that are important in their relationship (excluding card games), and how they manage to not hate each other after having been together for so long. All in all it’s a very long boring conversation that barely mentions drugs, sex, or alcohol in reference to any type of happiness or happy things like Steve expected and instead includes lots of mentions of physical intimacy (not the same thing as sex), discussion, respect, and doing things to make the other happy. Relationships didn’t sound so soul sucking and life ruining until then.
Toni kneels up and gives Steve some room to breathe. Her chest is heaving and sweat trickles down her spine, Steve can feel it pooling at the small of her back. He smiles up at her.
Tony wants to talk about it. After the excitement has died down and he and Steve are moved into their new apartment in West End, he wants to sit down and discuss their…future, if there is one. The only thing is, and Tony has no problem admitting this, he’s scared of what Steve will say. On one hand, he and his boyfriend could be on the same page. Tony could propose. They’d be engaged, fresh out of college and ready to take on the world and get married. But then that begs the question: are they ready? Will it work? Stark men aren’t notorious for their ability to commit to anything; they’re fickle, they get bored, they like to drink. Tony doesn’t want to think that he’s Howard in the making but perhaps life just has to catch up to him, and Tony doesn’t want Steve to end up trapped and silently seething like his mother.
Steve takes a nap before they head out. He’s walking out of the front door with Clint, Bucky, and a very secretly frazzled Kate Bishop when Sam pulls into the drive in his white Mazda and everyone applauds when they see him. Everyone except Steve, who’s still a little dazed from having just woken up and not having eaten anything since like 11 that morning. It’s cool though, he tells himself, because he’s going to get like half sloshed at this club and then Bucky will feel obligated to feed him in order to ensure he doesn’t vomit up his own gastrointestinal system. Maybe he’ll get some of those really good burgers from the place on Flushing. Sam would probably want him to eat
“Can’t he just call a tow?”
“Yeah.”
helpfully. Steve scowls at the both of them.
Steve narrows his eyes, “Buck’s not gay.”
Tony can’t stop thinking about all the different versions of his terrible dream. He’s standing there and staring into the eyes he’s loved for years, his breathing in the comfortable, intoxicating scent of Steve’s cologne, and he’s hoping and hoping that the odds are in his favor on this one. There’s certainly a reason why they’ve made it this far, and Tony’s counting on that reason prevailing.
Tony slides in a third finger then, prodding at the loosening muscles of Steve’s ass. He always starts off so tight but Tony is nothing if not determined, and he works the younger man open with dedication. He alternates between forceful, necessary strokes, and sweet rubs across Steve’s prostate with his fingers. Steve has gone practically cross eyed with pleasure, and it takes everything in him to not fuck himself back against the fingers fucking him open.
“You want me there. In California for 17 days while you do business?”
Steve yells as well, “But I always go!”
“Fuck,” she whines, returning her hands to his hair. She yanks, hard, and the pain is so sweet, such a dull burn that it makes Tony’s mind go completely black as he throws his head back and moans. He likes her, he decides, likes Rogers and the attitude he can tell she has, likes how all that bite comes in such a sweet little package for him to defile.
time, I’m ready to make good on all your promises.”
So that’s Thursday.
This could be attributed to a number of causes. One, Tony has only ever had two friends at once during at time in his life up until now. He isn’t familiar with the trappings of traditional young adult life, and he has precious little experience giving or receiving naïve love advice from his peers. His friends, like him, are workaholics and dedicated academics and often don’t have time for dating. Of these few and far between friends, Tony has thought he was in love with three of them and had his heart terribly broken by 2 and a half of them. Two: Tony’s parents weren’t even in love. Most kids’ first example of a loving relationship is their parents, right? Watching the people that made them hug and kiss and tell each other inside jokes while they cook dinner. Not Tony. Mom and Howard barely spoke to one another in Tony’s presence, leading him to believe they spoke even less when he wasn’t around. They probably liked each other alright, were comfortable enough to settle into easy routines and know how to defuse arguments, but they definitely weren’t in love. Tony is, unfortunately, wholly unfamiliar with what love looks like or what you’re supposed to do with it. There isn’t enough information at his disposal.
When he gets to Providence Tony makes reservations at a small French place and picks up some flowers. Steve doesn’t really like big gestures (reckless spending stresses him out) so Tony can’t have Akihiro fly in from Los Angeles to make them sushi or have $3000 worth of roses delivered to his dorm, and that’s fine. Spending money is the only way Tony really knows how to express how much his boyfriend really means to him, but he’s getting better at the little things. In fact, if Tony says so himself, he’s better at the little things than he ever could have imagined.
“So you will then?” Steve sits up, wraps himself around Tony properly, “Marry me?”
“I’m swooning.”
So they make their way over to the bar, where Steve locks eyes with Clint and gives him a specific look that means, vehemently, DO NOT ENGAGE I’M TRYING TO GET FUCKED BY THIS GUY, and takes a seat so Tony can buy Steve a drink. He orders a few rounds of Silver 1800, like they’d discussed and sit at the bar and chat for a while. It’s pretty good. Steve can even ignore the docile tones of teenage bubblegum angst in the background while Tony’s talking because the man is an amazing storyteller, and he laughs a lot. He’s exactly Steve’s type, except softer and less angry, and more likely to encourage Steve to keep talking instead of trying to shut him up. Steve doesn’t really know how to handle that softness, the lack of an edge; most of the men he’s slept with in the past haven’t had the time to listen to his rambling about Nickelodeon cartoons or the expensive paints he’d splurged on for his birthday. Most of the men Steve’s slept with have been quick and to the point, efficient almost in their way of seduction, but Tony isn’t. Tony rambles with Steve, drunkenly meanders through their conversation happily, as if he isn’t ashamed to be seen with Steve, or ashamed to be
Tony has barely made it to his room before there’s a hand on his arm, gripping harshly to turn him around. He gasps at the grip, tries to snatch his arm away, but finds that whoever is holding him is way too strong for that.
When she’s finished, Steve lifts her bodily off him. He arranges her so she’s lying on her back, comfortably propped up by the pillows, cradled by blankets. He leaves briefly to pour her a glass of wine. He lies down next to her, resting his head on her right thigh.
of all things in a drawer. There aren’t even any dishes in the sink. His skin is crawling.
Eloquently Tony says, “What.”
, making her sob at the pain. Tony’s glad that she stopped jerking him off because that sight alone, her hurting herself while she comes, would’ve made him shoot off right then. He’s leaking all over himself; the stain on his thigh is the least of his concerns.
“I…don’t know.”
“Fuck babe,” Tony gasps against Steve’s ankle. He moves his mouth up higher and higher, biting and sucking until his lips meet his fingers on Steve’s thighs and then he’s sucking bruises into the pale skin there too, “What do you want?” he husks.
He's no different in the bedroom.
The words “I do” fall from Tony’s lips so easily he almost doesn’t remember why he’d been so worried in the first place.
Steve says, “Bucky landed on top of me and nearly concussed my skinny ass. Tony would be so-,” as he makes it to the car that Nat’s just shoved his best friend into. Kate and Clint joined in with little question and no one has started to scream yet so Steve is guessing this must be one of Nat’s elusive college friends, or one of her dad’s people when Tony starts speaking.
Tony reaches up to cup Steve’s jaw in his hand, stroking his thumb over the perfect swell of his cheekbone, “What if I’ve got other plans for you?” Tony asks. His thumb slips past Steve’s lips and into his mouth, just resting on his tongue until Tony pulls away. “Maybe I wanna play with my little boy for a while.”
“He’ll have one anyway! I think Nat’s gonna be there tonight!”
“Who’s Kate Bishop?”
“Eat,” Tony demands gently. He doesn’t even reach a hand out towards his food until Steve has taken at least two bites of his omelette and sipped his juice. He looks disproportionately happy at the sight of Steve enjoying himself.
She smiles wanly, “Yes. Here we are, you and I. In the backseat of a car your purchased but don’t drive.”
“What the fuckening fuck is going on here?” he mutters to himself when he finds
Just as Steve is about to add in his two cents, because no one gets to tell an epic story like that and
“True ‘nuff.”
“This is definitely your kind of place,” Tony laughs, looking around. He’s right. Steve loves it.
When he first caught sight of her, Tony had been struck by two things: one being her diminutive stature and two being the crowd of old school military brass practically foaming at the mouth to speak to her. She stood ramrod straight and held her clutch like she was actively trying not to allow herself to stand at parade rest. Unlike lots of other military women, however, this one wasn’t dressed in their formal green suit. No, standing on the other side of the room (way too far for Tony’s liking) the small blonde woman donned a classic looking long blue dress that hugged her tiny waist perfectly. The slit up the side displayed a perfectly muscled, yet somehow dainty creamy leg that Tony knew would look so beautiful over his shoulder. The heels she was wearing looked deadly and were intimidatingly high, however she still only hovered around 5’4” tall. Tony wanted to tuck her under his arm and flee the scene before anyone else could get their paws on her. So he did.
have him interject, the flash of headlights blinds them all. They’re gathered in the opening of an alley, far enough away from the trash to not be able to smell it so much, and not deep enough in to get mugged or murdered without someone else noticing, but people don’t usually drive into alleys. It’s generally pretty gross and dangerous, and when Steve gets a good look at the shiny Suburban that has somehow managed to squeeze itself in between the bricks, he figures this guy isn’t from the city and doesn’t know this.
“I-I like it when you—well sometimes you put y-your fingers in t-too. I like it. And I like w-when  you get a little r-r-rough. Last time you—oh god Tony—you put your f-fingers in my mouth and-,” Steve can’t finish the sentence without letting out a huge sobbing moan and Tony grabs him tighter, pulls him impossibly closer, getting right up in Steve face as he pants.
“You came straight here?”
When they pull up to Tony’s building, Steve has to fight not to say something embarrassing about being poor. Instead he gives Tony a sly look and tucks his hands into the pockets of Bucky’s old leather jacket he’s wearing, “Nice digs, daddy,” he snorts and in return he gets a surprisingly heated look.
“We really appreciate it,” the woman (who Steve correctly assumed was the notorious Pepper Potts) had smiled warmly, “Who knew security would be necessary at an art gallery.”
It’s a fun night, an easy night. Tony slams back a shot with the rest of the group, sips from a beer, but doesn’t drink for the rest of the night. Steve gets absolutely fucking blitzed. The band that plays definitely errs on the whinier emo side, but they’re loud and their basslines are awesome, so he and Bucky waste no time throwing themselves into the fray of it. Less than three songs in Bucky has his shirt off, they’re headbanging wildly, and have been threatened with bodily harm at least four times. It’s great. They get back to the table and do a few more shots, and when Bucky drags Nat into the crowd Steve stays back with Tony. Steve pushes himself close, grabs Tony's arm and drapes it over himself so that he can feel  warm and safe and small. The older man looks more amused than anything, watching Steve's friend run about and make fools of themselves for the entire night, so Steve doesn’t bother asking if he’s ready to go.
Tony smiles again. They take the food upstairs and Tony stands by the bed as he watches Steve get comfortable again before settling the tray over his lap. When he’s sure that Steve looks satisfied and pleased as a peach he sits on top of the blankets, that have been pushed to the foot of the bed mostly, and he crosses his legs like a little kid. His face is creased with ill concealed excitement, like looking at Steve with sleep in his eyes is enough to make his day. Usually, if he spends the night at Rumlow’s, Brock is gone in the morning for work and Rollins hadn’t even come home.
Clint looks to the ceiling, trying to remember, “The Bronx probably? She said she likes the zoo.”
to you-,” Tony’s shaking his head and pulling away and Steve is positively panicked. All these days of preparing himself to leave or be left and now that it’s here, now that they’ve run their course, he’s trying desperately to hang on. And it’s probably not fair but Steve doesn’t care, so he wraps his arms around Tony’s neck frantically and plants kiss after kiss on his face, panting.
Eventually when her breathing evens out she says, “You can tell your driver not to circle the block for the 6
“Do you want the first hit?” he asks dreamily, laying on the romance.
Bucky’s right: the show was worth it. Not only did the four of them get high as a fucking kite off of weed and these pretty ass uppers some girl Nat knew vaguely from school sold them, but the pit was crazy. There were hundreds of people, men and women, and there were so many grabbing hands and the music seemed to reach a crescendo whenever there was an epic clash. Steve’s blood had run 200 degrees too hot and his heart, with its delicate sensibilities, could barely handle the rush but he loved it. When they’d managed to drag themselves back to the car, after Bucky threw up twice, and Tony fell into a puddle, they turned the lights on and took stock of their injuries. Natasha, who was the same height as Steve in her boots, sustained many of the same kinds that he did. They both had bruises on their stomachs, and one high on their cheekbones from stray elbows, but Natasha also had a few strands of hair missing and a bloody lip. Bucky’s nose was bleeding all over his front, his eyebrow piercing had nearly been ripped out, and he was limping a little. Tony was behind the wheel, because he was both the least impaired and had the biggest apartment for all of them to crash at. The most he suffered from was a punch to the jaw and a nice little dehydration headache. Steve had tried to stay with him while moshing but that’s a little impossible and plus, that night in bed, Tony had told him how great it was to see him so excited and full of life, flushed down to his ankles with happiness.
“Turn off the light and get in bed, please.”
“He threatened me with violence when he asked me to teach him sign language,” Clint adds. Steve hears something clang and fall to the ground and he rolls his eyes before finally stepping on the first stair. Steve is pretty sure that it doesn’t take other people 10 whole minutes to get from their front door, to kitchen, to the first stair leading to the second level of his house and he’s vaguely sad about having missed out on a normal 20 something’s experience of life. And then he hears Clint groan, “Oh oven mitt, you’re useless,” regretfully and he’s incredibly happy that he’s made the decision to live with this merry band of fucking losers. They’re pretty great when they want to be.
“Yum,” he laughs breathlessly. Toni rolls her eyes good-naturedly and as a distraction for the both of them, leans backwards to run her own hand over Steve’s dick. He hisses; he’s so hard he’d probably pop as soon as he felt her bare skin.
Tony laughs, “No, no. I mean the clubs. I own a bunch of property now all over the city, but they’re not a chain.”
And then Eve gives Tony a look that makes him rethink what he thought he knew about her. There’s a deviousness there that he hadn’t expected, like she’s planning on beating him at something. She holds her glass out for another pour and Tony obliges, but he doesn’t stop watching her. Eve takes a sip this time, leaving sticky residue from her lip gloss on the glass, and she gazes at him over its rim.
? I don’t wanna—it’s so weird when you bring it up. It makes me feel…weird.”
Now Bucky rolls his eyes, “It’s
“We fuckin’ get it,” Bucky slurs, slobbing on himself. His lip is fat and bloody, his knuckles are scraped to hell and back, and he’s sitting on the ground in an alley with a can of beer pressed to his temple while they wait for Natasha to exit the bar they were just in. Thankfully it wasn’t one of Tony’s, or that would’ve been a mess in and of itself (who gets banned from their boyfriend’s place of business?), but now it means the 6 of them are stupid drunk in public and need to figure out where they’re going to go to avoid getting arrested for assault and or public intoxication. As it is Bucky and Natasha could face some pretty serious charges for making a grown man cry and Clint could be getting there in his irritation with Steve talking nonstop about his undying love for a certain Anthony Stark.
“T-Tony what? Please stop!” Steve starts, hopping out of the bed too. He puts a hand on Tony’s shoulder, “I- what the fuck this does mean something to me! We mean something to me,” he admits, blinking tears of his eyes.
Steve. It’s nice.
“You think he wants to marry you?” she asks innocently enough, but it brings Tony pause. Steve has never talked about getting married, but then again neither has Tony. Steve’s own parents had been happily married before his father’s passing so it’s not as if he has a fear of the institution like Tony does. He’s just…never mentioned it. Steve tells Tony he loves him all the time though. While in France he’d sent Tony at least 20 drawings of himself, all lovingly crafted and drawn from an artist’s memory, like Tony was his muse or something. Steve left mushy voicemails all the time too, telling Tony how much he missed him and wished he were there to hug and kiss (and fuck). Tony knew that Steve loved him, there was no doubt about that. He wasn’t sure if Steve…felt anything beyond that. Because Tony felt something beyond love. He felt a longing for him, felt passion for him, felt that deep, gnawing want that had been unnamed at one point in time but now called itself
