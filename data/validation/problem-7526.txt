on a mission.
Steve’s hand lingered in the air for a minute, his eyes probing, but then he nodded once and drew his hand away.
He settled back into the couch, resting shoulder to shoulder with Steve to watch the news. Bucky knew he had the best friend anyone could ask for, but he wanted more than that now. At least, he was pretty sure that was what this was. Friendship was fine and dandy, but not…complete. Somehow, it wasn’t complete.
“Did you take her temp—
He looked down, too ashamed to even look at his son as he spoke.
“Miss Morgan!”
They had two minutes to get into the compound and out of sight once they activated their cloaking systems. Similar to the stealth mode of the helicarrier, their combat gear was laced with nano particles that essentially turned them invisible for a short period of time. Of course, it wasn’t perfect, but it was much safer than trying to sneak in without it.
Blaine’s rifle was pointed down and toward a corner Steve couldn’t see into.
“Want to sleep in my bed?” Tony offered. “I promise not to be inappropriate.” He shot Steve a smirk.
Bruce was behind him a little ways,  standing off to the side and far from the high-powered friends of Jackson’s that were staring at him. Steve smiled when Bruce saw him.
Peter smiled. “I’m glad to see you understand.” He patted Steve on the shoulder and Steve fought the urge to throw his hand off and break his arm like he was trained to do. “I’ll see to it that your superiors reward you for the safe return of my daughter. Keep up the good work.”
“Who are you? Where are you taking me?”
He tried not to think about it. Sometimes he tried to think about another man’s lips on his skin or about being pressed close to another warm body, his fingers tangling in a man’s hair.
His phone buzzed in his pocket and Steve glanced at Tony, who was facing away from him and presumably watching Jackson, just to make sure it wasn’t a call for the Avengers.
Tony waited a moment, then sighed. “So you’re just going to sleep like that. All twisted up.”
How devastating it must have been for him to find out he’d tricked himself into loving—
I am your friend –
Tony sat up completely, shaking his head so that the sand fell from his hair. It half worked. He still looked good, as always. Steve hated that his brain still made those mental notes.
Steve’s gaze traveled over the photo one more time. “I dunno, Tony. Last night—”
Tony frowned. “So. Definitely work on it.”
Before, he had been an American icon, a trophy to be tarnished in the press with every mistake. To these men he was some sort of monster. He was the thing they heard whispers about in the ranks, the man who never aged and never hurt.
Rhodey slipped two IVs into each of his arms, connecting ports to each with practiced ease.
Steve waited for him to elaborate, but when Tony didn’t, he decided not to press. Clearly this wasn’t going to be an easy topic to bring up, even if Tony seemed to want to tell him about it. Steve could understand that; he never wanted to speak to anyone about Bucky falling off the train either.
Bucky set his rifle on the floor and lay down behind it, checking his scope and ensuring everything was in order. He had a good view of the fields and forests. Given that the team started to the north, they probably wouldn’t be flanked.
“His happiness is our first priority,” Steve corrected. “He hasn’t seen me in four years. I’m not going to force it on him at his wedding when he doesn’t want me there.”
“This hard drive better be worth it,” Steve said, extending a hand to help him up.
Jackson probably wasn’t ever going to grey, the lucky bastard.
Steve stopped walking and turned around, his eyes red and his cheeks wet. “I’m sorry I ruined us,” he said shakily. “But I wanted to save what I could of our family. And I did. You and Peter have done so much together. I’m proud of both of you.”
Steve nodded once and looked back down at his bowl of oatmeal. That had been a really stupid thing to say. He
Tony’s gaze turned to Mary Jane. “MJ, you’ve the best thing that’s ever happened to my son.”
Maybe this was just absolute desperation kicking in.
Tony had to be here.
Tony’s smile fell ad he shook his head. “No you’re not. I know you, Spangles. You’re not glad.”
He yawned as he clicked the phone to lock, and ran a hand through his hair to see if it was greasy. It wasn’t. It never was. Even so, Steve made sure to keep a strict routine. Every morning he showered, shaved, and dressed nicely when he wasn’t going in to do Avengers work. His outfits had gradually adapted with the times, but he always felt more comfortable in a button down or oversized t-shirt than the sweaters and fitted clothing he seemed to receive in abundance every Christmas. He did like sweatpants, though. Those could stay.
Steve laughed nervously and tried not to melt under the force of Tony’s smile. “Yeah, sure.”
“The night of the party,” Thor explained. “I had just returned from Asgard. Seeing how miserable you both were, I brought back an elvish potion. One derivative of the Aether.”
Tony didn’t leave a message, of course, but he had stood there in his bedroom for a very long time contemplating throwing up.  It hadn’t even sounded like Steve. It sounded like someone had woken up a college student at 4AM during finals week and demanded they make a voicemail message.
Despite being close to waking, Steve could still find peace in Tony’s features. His skin was smooth, his lashes long and dark. His cheeks soft, that immaculately groomed facial hair still in place despite being sandblasted from an afternoon spent dozing on a windy beach. Tony’s brain was quiet—and Steve seldom got to see when Tony Stark’s brain was quiet. Even in their most intimate moments, Tony was always at least a little bit distracted. His mind could not focus on one thing—that was never ever going to be how he worked.
And in typical Steve fashion, he looked up exactly in Tony’s direction and exactly into his eyes without even knowing where he’d been. Tony’s heart locked up in his chest, and panic began to rise when Steve stood, taking Morgan’s hand and leading her back over to him.
“I’m going to sleep,” he said abruptly.
“And I’m not him,” Tony replied. “I dunno about you, but I’d take a ‘sorta’ him over an empty bed without him.”
“Steve, it’s Bucky. Hey, uh, I was just callin’ because I got somethin’ in the mail from Peter today. Look…I think you should call me.  Soon, yeah? I need to talk to ya anyway.” A brief pause. “The dogs are fine. I’m fine too. Kinda lonely here though. But I’ll—hey ya big asshole, get off! Steve, teach your dogs to fuckin' listen. Anyway, call me.”
Steve clicked the button again, ending location sharing. He took a breath and strode into his bedroom, collecting his duffel.
The lights went low. Rhodey started moving equipment around them, clearing space.
She was lying to him.
They headed for the compound, searching for an entryway that wouldn’t trip an alarm. It would be impossible to tell which doors were safe, but they had no other choice.
“We could meet you at the street corner,” Steve offered. “Just get in the car and go.” He ached to be home, to be wrapped in Tony’s embrace and all of the familiar surroundings he knew and loved.
“Tony?”
The revelation probably should have shocked him more, but everything was fitting into place—pieces of the puzzle finally finding their rightful spots. It made so much sense.
When Steve reached the end of the corridor, sliding doors opened with a small hiss. He peeked into the room, but it looked the same as he remembered. A few potted plants, some priceless artwork on the walls (all post-modern, not really Steve’s favorite), and cool lights washing the room in a pleasant blueish hue.
“You won,” Steve croaked, a sob escaping his lips. “Now get out of my fucking apartment and get back to your fucking penthouse and raise him!”
“Ton--” he choked, but blood filled his mouth before he could finish.
“You brought me home, must count for something,” Steve teased, and for once he seemed oblivious to Tony’s unease.
“And you just want to ignore that and have me go completely out of my way just so I can be here? What do we even do? We sit around and do nothing, that’s what. We do nothing.”
Bucky yelled some more, then his voice was clear. “It’s always a fuckin’ bad time if you call,” he snarled.
“You have intel in your bag, Steve,” Blaine cut. “You nearly compromised this mission—“
“Dada,” she warned, burrowing her face into the couch cushion. “No.”
Nobody knew that the core of his happiness didn’t come from some notion of finally being able to move on—no, it was far more selfish. Steve considered this wedding a victory. He had won. He had been the one to prove everyone wrong who said he was a gold-digging super slut that was going to date someone else and take Tony’s money. He made his own money and had raised Peter without so much as a cent from Tony. Even that extra money from the museum had felt tainted in his wallet, but so long as Tony’s name wasn’t on the check, he could swallow it.
“Hey, speaking of which, where are you parents, MJ?” Steve asked after having gathered the courage to say something. Peter was his son, for God’s sake. He should have to feel small in the presence of his—
“He told us this was what he wanted,” Vision murmured. “I trust that he knows that this is what’s best.”
“I’m fine,” Tony muttered. “How’s your apartment?”
“Did you call Bucky? Maybe they’re out on a run,” Tony offered.
“Okay, okay,” Morgan shrieked, barreling toward him again.
But every time, he stopped himself before opening the cooler that housed the “strain.” Extremis wasn’t exactly a disease, but it wasn’t really a chemical compound or anything either. If he had to call it something, he would probably use magic.
“Let’s go to bed,” Tony whispered, feathering Steve’s jawline with kisses. “I missed you so much.”
Even in the night sky above, he swore he saw an enemy UAV, an oncoming Predator strike, or the flicker of a bomber wing in the moonlight, ready to turn the whole island into a bloody mess of rubble.
As he pulled into the valet line, he wondered if Steve would approve of a kids art gallery that had catered dinner and actual art critics in attendance. Steve bucked societal trends like his life depended on it, but he also never complained about rich people things unless Tony asked him about it directly. Steve knew full well that Tony stressed out when he thought people were disappointed in him, so he never said anything negative about where they were or who they were with. And usually he had plenty of reason to.
to cry right now, okay?”
His phone buzzed and Steve felt his entire body tense as he looked over and saw that the message as from Tony.
Steve stood and headed over to his bed, leaning to pull out a large hard-shell suitcase from underneath it. “I’ll take first watch,” he said, flicking open the latches and pulling out his assault rifle.
“Copy that,” Blaine said. “We’re cloaking in.”
But now he had someone else to focus on. A little girl with dark hair and eyes just like his. Same long eyelashes too, and probably the same brain. Except, you know, without the alcohol poisoning. For a kid who’d grown up in foster care, she was a wildly happy toddler who saw every remotely sharp object in the penthouse as a personal challenge.
Peter pulled back and raised his brows with a sigh. “Finals went fine. Some of my professors though…”
At one point in his life, Steve would have known exactly where Tony was going with this, but that part of him was so warped now that he waited until things were spelled out to him. Better not to confuse things.
That stupid girl he had saved was his granddaughter.
“Thought you said I wasn’t allowed to sleep on the floor.”
“Is this how the U.S. military treats all of its rescued hostages?”
“You’re torturing him.” Bucky worked his jaw, clearly upset, but it wasn’t angry. It was…worried. For Steve. Tony wasn’t sure he’d ever seen Bucky
“See, it’s ridiculous, the way I think about you,” Steve said. “I still want to ask you if we can sleep together out here, and pretend it’s to stay warm.”
“You as well, Captain Rogers,” Jackson returned in his smooth baritone, giving a respectful dip of his head.
Tony didn’t respond, he just nuzzled into Steve’s arm a little more and went still. It was clear the conversation was over, and Steve was glad for it. They didn’t need to talk about it. They shouldn’t have brought it up at all.
Steve glanced over at Tony and Jackson, who were laughing about something.
Steve looked down at his hands and swallowed hard. But all he had to do was close his eyes and remember the arguments where he and Tony had shoved each other against walls, yelling about risking too much or not being home or not acting the least bit acceptably in a briefing. All he had to do was remember the pure fury he had felt, and how many times he had only kept his fist from Tony’s jaw because a voice in his head screamed for him to stop.
Seeing you last year is something I still think about. It’s stupid how often I think about it, actually. It’s something closer to obsession. I still think about you every day. I say your name a lot, in my head. Steve, Steve, Steve. It’s like a fucking mantra. Whenever it’s quiet, I hear myself saying your name. I feel my tongue move in my mouth just the slightest bit, feeling out the word like I might speak it aloud someday and have it mean something to you.
“And after me and Daddy start really fighting, do you know what happens next?” His voice was quivering madly now, and hot tears rolled from his eyes, hot and scalding.  Oh, Peter. Not Peter.
He blinked, gesturing around the room. “Are you being facetious?”
“Shh, shh,” Tony hushed, and Steve could hear that he was crying too. That bastard.
“Sorry,” he said with a cough. “This wine is terrible. I forgot how rich people only drink dry wine.” He coughed again, staring at the shadows on the floor.
His eyes itched for just a moment, but no moisture. That was as close as it got anymore.
Tony didn’t connect him to BARF technology this time. He insisted that Steve still was going to be in the program, but it wasn’t going to be an active experience.
But when a letter arrived to his room sent in a thick, tied-shut envelope from New York, he knew Tony was gone.
Tony sat down in the chair beside him as Steve stared through the wall across from him, trying to figure out what the hell was happening. Peter had never even asked about Candice when he was a child. She had been part of Steve and Tony’s life for the year that they had gone through the legal proceedings and when they helped out with her pregnancy needs.
“I remember getting nervous before I asked you to go on stupid adventures,” Steve continued, chewing his bottom lip. “Like when I made up that stupid story about how there was that really fancy smoothie place four hours away and how Bucky bailed on going with me?”
“I didn’t say that.” Tony’s voice was tired. Disappointed. Again.
He waited for Tony to call him a hypocrite, but the accusation never came. This Tony never told him he was too hung up on Bucky, that he needed to let go. This Tony knew what that kind of loss felt like.
Steve swallowed, licking his lips. He didn’t need Tony’s help. He didn’t want it.
“Yeah,” he finally replied. “Yeah.”
Back on his feet, he noticed that the lights were back on, but something was off. It took a moment for Steve to realize why. He looked down at his hands, and they were…spotless.
“Again,” Steve insisted, wiping his mouth. No blood. Yet.
Steve cleared his throat. “I’m sorry?”
“Do you remember anything from last night?” Steve asked.
Steve stopped messing with the paintbrush and turned to face him. “What?”
“Out with it,” Tony murmured in a tone barely above a whisper.
Us. Separate from—
Peter smiled at him from underneath the shadow of his graduation cap. Steve smiled back before dusting off the photograph and replacing it on the wall he had taken it from. A year had already passed since that day. Peter already looked older than he had at his graduation. His voice had gotten deeper too.
So he would stand by and let the love of his life get married to someone else.
Except around Tony.
“It’s okay,” Maria assured him. “I’m fine, Dad.”
“It’s Tony’s decision,” Natasha said. “He’s the one actually going on the mission.”
Bucky’s lips quirked. “Was it Peter or Tony this time?”
Occasionally, Steve found himself thinking of the other Tony from years ago. He woke up from nightmares of fire and a shriveled, burning hand. He heard the scream of a child in his ear. In some dreams he heard that laughter too, and felt the deep, oozing warmth that Steve had felt being a family with Tony and Peter.
He turned to see Blaine hunched over the body of the first soldier, cleaning his combat knife on the man’s jacket.
“Stay right here, and don’t move, whatever you hear. Don’t leave this fucking car, Peter.”
“I do,” Tony argued, setting down his mug. “I know you, at least.”
Silence.
His Tony.
“Would it be alright if I carried you to cover?” Steve asked, only meeting Tony’s eye at the tail end of his question.
He found Tony in a corner booth, tucked up against the wall. He was scrolling through his phone, but Steve didn’t buy the relaxed act. For one, Tony’s tie was still snug at his throat, and he was still wearing a watch on his wrist. That meant he hadn’t relaxed at all, which was unusual for midday. Especially when he was dressed up.
“I know,” he replied, but he wasn’t sure he believed it.
Steve adjusted his backpack, gripping the straps for some sort of reassurance as he walked along the familiar hallway that lead to the Avengers entrance with its own special elevator. The floor was smooth concrete, the walls a reflective metal. It could withstand bombings, alien attacks—pretty much anything the world could throw at it.
The boat stopped and the men bunched at the door, pressed tight to each other. Staying in the boat was suicide, but so was leaving first. They all knew that, yet they all tried to be the first one out.
. “What the hell, Tony!”
Steve rubbed up and down the side of his arms, trying to comfort himself in some small way.
Clint stayed for a long time. Tony didn’t get much work done. Every few minutes he was glancing at Clint’s location in the building, despite having asked for Friday to tell him when there was movement. He didn’t get what could be taking so long. Unless Clint was explaining the whole mission in depth, but that usually happened on the quinjet. Or maybe they were just catching up. Steve and Clint didn’t hang out much, though. It was probably something about Bucky. Clint seemed to like Barnes quite a bit, though Tony couldn’t hope to understand why. Bucky had been the reason he got himself locked up on the island.
Rumors were running around about how Emory had been genetically modified. Bred for war. Like some kind of dog.
Steve snatched the fabric back into place with a huff. “My clothes were soaked. I’m not about to sit around in wet clothes. Besides, it’s not like you’ve never seen me naked before.”
Tony looked completely shocked when Steve finally did open his eyes again, and he realized dimly that it was probably because he’d slipped a ‘fuck’ into the conversation. It used to be that he only did that when he was especially upset, but now he was constantly surrounded by far worse profanity.
The mission was forgettable, though it was one of the rare occasions where their intel was bad in a good way. The hard drive they needed to extract was only manned by a small task force that was easily taken care of with no casualties. Tony pulled the data like clockwork and Natasha ruptured the system shortly thereafter. They got out without so much as a ding in Tony’s armor. Easy. Steve might have thought it was too easy, had he been less focused on Tony not getting himself killed.
Sticks cracked beneath Steve’s feet as he tore through the woods, and branches snapped against his rips and shoulders. He was chasing something, or something was chasing him. When he ran, he let his mind go where it wanted, think what it wanted.
“Overwatch, is this all of them, over?” Blaine asked.
“I wish you’d fuck me more,” Tony said with shampoo lathered in his hair.
“Tony?” Steve moved to follow, but he heard Tony returning soon enough, his backpack in hand.
Winona’s brow furrowed. “What do you think he would do?”
“It’s not what’s happening there, it’s what’s happening
When the couple split last year, hearts around the world were broken.  Sources claim that the Stark Industries chairman and
“Yeah, he’s a great dog. They aren’t allowed in the house when they’re wet though.” Steve motioned toward the door. “Go on in.”
“You were?” Peter sounded shocked. “I didn’t even see you there. Why aren’t you here then?”
“So you have a kid, right?” Blaine asked as he scooped more potatoes onto his plate and created a crater with the serving spoon to fill with gravy. “With Stark?”
“What’s got you so angry?” Steve said, dropping into a soft tone, stepping in to cross the distance between them. “Talk to me. Tell me what’s wrong, Tones.” He leaned into Tony’s sneer, hands framing Tony’s face, looking him over as though he could find the answer in his eyes.
“Do I get to know?”
“The only one
He sighed. “It’s Tony.” He knew he shouldn’t talk about it anymore—he’d practically talked Iron Man’s ear off at this point, but he was always so attentive. Like he truly cared what was happening in a way even Sam and Bucky didn’t quite match. Bucky didn’t like Tony at all—hated him, actually. Would probably have killed him by now if Steve hadn’t married him.
Vision’s eyes opened to give her a look. “For both of them.”
“I want to go home,” Steve said quietly.
The Private took the sandwich and the boat went quiet again.
This time, it was going back into the drawer with two signatures.
He buried his nose into the pillow, smiling to himself. He knew this place, and he was so glad to be there.  All he was missing was—
Something wet hit him on the cheek and Tony jumped in the booth, touching his cheek. Something slimy was there, and he made a face of disgust until he saw Steve smirking at him, his straw bobbing in his mouth like a cigar.
Steve flinched.
Morgan grabbed his finger and pulled. He pretended to be knocked off balance and yanked forward. It occurred to him as he “regained” his balance that this may very well be the first time he’d ever attended a public event without nerves. Without eyeing the champagne trays, without a knot in his stomach.
“Oh.” Tony flipped it around to reveal a picture of him—of Tony’s Steve—beaming from where he sat on a large rock in the middle of a creek. He looked…younger. His eyes were bright, his cheeks flushed, and he seemed relaxed in a way Steve couldn’t place. There was something familiar about the way the other Steve’s pants were rolled up above his ankles, the way his sleeves rolled up past his elbows as he held a smooth rock in his hands.
Even as they agreed, Vision recalled that night. The night Wanda had slipped into Tony’s bedroom while he waited for Steve to return, the night Vision himself had helped her seal off Tony’s whole life from his body. How Tony hadn’t even felt it as he put away one of his fancy watches—or so Vision had told Wanda after taking her from the room when it was finished.
“Wait,” Steve said slowly. “Since when is Bucky mated?”
“But it’s so fun,” Peter giggled with a teasing glance at Patrick.
“Steve just wants me for the challenge,” Tony said derisively. “He’s like all of the other alphas: they like us for the hunt and the twisted pleasure of having us fall for them, only to leave us in the dust or treat us like dirt after they’ve gotten what they wanted.”
Tony stared at him. “What?” he asked, incredulously.
His omega was so beautiful like this – his face flushed, brow knitted in concentration and hair in a tangled mass down his back from where Steve had wound it around his fingers and pulled it throughout their lovemaking.
“Well where is he, Pepper?”
“No offense, but I wasn’t gonna ask you to come on this one,” Clint said.
Jackson stepped into the living room, greeting him with a wave instead of a kiss once he noticed Tony was on the phone.
“He wants to be with you. And the kid,” Bucky said. “But it has to be his choice. When you invite him here, it becomes
Wanda released him of her touch. “For who?”
“Did you try to get Peter to call for you?” Bucky asked, his tone every bit accusing.
—son over.
But the other one was too close.
“But you managed to survive, so I guess I shouldn’t have been worried,” Tony smiled. “And the next thing I knew, you were running around the Tower—always just teetering on the edge between staying upright and falling flat on your face. Just when I started to grasp that you were growing up, suddenly you were in school. Then you were spending more time with me in the lab more than you were on homework.”
“Jackson, I fucking told you—“
“Yeah, when you start thinking all gushy it makes me start thinking all gushy and that always makes me think about being in bed with you and snuggling up to you and—“
“No,” Bucky said, and Steve could feel the vibration of his vocal chords. “You did every last thing you could to help them and they fucked you over every time. You were just tryin’ to get better and it never worked ‘cause they won’t stop hurtin’ you. It ain’t your fault.”
Morgan clutched her lunchbox, clearly a little nervous about the whole thing.
“’Course I did,” Tony replied with a sly smile.
Steve smiled wide as Peter smashed his face against Steve’s to listen to the conversation.
He had to make a choice. Just like he had twenty years ago, pacing around their enormous master bathroom, terrified Tony would be listening to his call as he explained to a lawyer that he needed out of his marriage. Back then he his greatest fear had been losing his son.
“Oh, you do?” Tony snapped. “How are you so sure about that?”
Tony tucked his quivering lower lip between his teeth, watching Steve patiently, sadly, with tears still leaking fresh from those impossibly blue eyes. The eyes that were familiar and trustworthy yet so off, so unsettling.
“Here?” Tony didn’t believe it. “This hardly seems like your kind of place.”
“Yes,” Steve finally answered in an even tone. “If I had a chance to do it over, I wouldn’t change a thing.”
Tony was so childish. Even so, Steve was warm all over. God, he really didn’t like Tony at all. “You do not.”
The sounds of gunshots made Steve’s stomach drop. Terror filled his bloodstream, but so did excitement. They were going out there to fight. To kill. His fingers twitched as he pulled his shield from his back and the rifle that had been mounted underneath it.
Not-Tony hesitated a moment before answering. “Uh, Bucky.”
Right. Thor still didn’t have email. Morgan was way too smart for her age.
The boys got to talking, so Steve checked to make sure dinner was still going to be done on time, participating in conversation only when it was asked of him.
Steve stared at the letters, tracing the indentations the pen had made on that paper. His heart ached terribly in his chest, wringing itself over and over as he fought with himself about whether or not to open the envelope and read what was inside.
Bucky advanced like an angry guard dog. “He ain’t sorry. It ain’t his fault.”
“Uh, I was talking about your heater that you wanted fixed but, um, okay.”
“Coming,” Tony murmured distractedly in a way that meant he definitely wasn’t leaving his work anytime soon.
The door slammed in Steve’s face, leaving him to glare at nothing.
The metal of the Quinjet wing groaned above them in the force of the wind. Tony chewed the inside of his cheek, glancing around their shelter.
Steve’s heart leapt to his throat. He couldn’t find any words to say, because he had no idea what was going to come out of Tony’s mouth. Tony looked equally as pained, and for a moment they just stared at each other.
“Hey, can I get my coffee now?” Tony snarled, arms crossed. “Steve, show me where the hell there’s a Starbucks around here. Hell, I’ll even take a Tim Horton’s, just get me some coffee.”
“I’m calling Bucky,” Tony said. “And Sam and everyone else. Stop making this into more than what it is. Please, Steve. Something’s obviously wrong and we want to help you.” Tony voice softened and he stepped a little closer, tentatively reaching out to touch Steve’s arm. “I think you should talk to someone. Get a dog or have Bucky move in or
Steve smiled a little before wadding up his straw wrapper.
The background noise on Peter’s end of the line died out, presumably as Peter walked to a quieter part of the reception. “Do you always have to hurt him like that, Pops? Really?”
His radio crackled to life. “Candidates ready to begin testing, sir.”
Steve drew up his line, his crosshairs glued to the center of her chest. She couldn’t see him, and he didn’t have his finger on the trigger.
Peter would stay at Tony’s for the summer, then he would decide not to come back to the “sad little apartment.” He would go to court with Tony’s lawyers and change the custody agreement and Steve would let him do it without so much as a peep of resistance. He had no right to be Peter’s guardian, any claim he had would never hold up against Stark lawyers. Tony was Peter’s biological father. Tony would always get what he wanted.
Steve let out a chuckle. “Yeah, I suppose he would be.”
Steve flashed a weak smile. “I’ve got this, Buck. He wants coffee. I highly doubt anything is going to come up that’s going to ruin my progress in twenty minutes.”
He took a slow breath and his heartbeat started to spread out, slower beats. Easier to shoot between them.
“So,” he digressed, “I just won’t call again. Over and done with.”
“I’m okay,” Tony assured him. “I’m about to be more than okay when I see the both of you. Just think, in a few hours we’ll be snuggled up on the jet.”
Tony was staring up at him, brow furrowed. A moment later he propped himself up on an elbow. “What? She’s not—God, baby, no.” He cupped Steve face in his hand. “She’s not taking him. She’s not.”
“I said, Tony, Jackson, MJ, and I are going to dinner, then having family movie night at the house. I can’t go to dinner.”
Steve put out a hand. “No, don’t.”
“I know,” she said, clearly unconvinced. “See you tomorrow?”
Talking to Rhodey had been a good idea after all. Crush done. Over. Back to the real world.
Steve closed one eye and lined up a shot.
“If you’d like to go on a date with me tonight.”
Worse, he wanted to take it. The pain of betrayal was salved over with those kind eyes and the adorable way Steve struggled so much when he should be the most confident person on the team when it came to a date. Tony had always admired that humility in him. And laughed whenever Mr. Optimism crumbled at the very suggestion of a candlelit dinner.
“N-no,” Steve stammered before dry heaving one more time.
Tony smile wide, and it rang genuine because he was so relieved. “Didn’t bring you home, I just let you walk me to the door.”
Steve nodded. “Sounds good to me. Have a good sleep, Nat.”
Steve frowned. “But we aren’t. We aren’t back together. Last night was just…”
“Pretending, Tony,” Steve hummed, thumbing over Tony’s knuckles.
Blaine grabbed the scarred man by the collar and started dragging him off toward the bushes.
But that didn’t mean Bucky felt the same way. Bucky, who only ever smiled when Steve was in the room. Who only showed gentleness and kindness when he was making Steve coffee or throwing a blanket over him when he’d fallen asleep at his desk. Bucky, who had staked Tony out on his own accord so that he wouldn’t keep hurting Steve.
“Call Steve first, then we’ll talk about filming,” Tony said, cutting him off. He hung up the phone and unfolded his hand from the metal ball.
Steve wanted so badly to be happy for Tony, but he couldn’t. He knew it wasn’t fair, because Tony wasn’t his and had every right to be happy however he wanted to be.
Humiliation began curling beneath his skin, white hot and burning. It left a bad taste in his mouth and something in his nose that gave the same sensation as smelling burning rubber.
He loved Tony. Steve’s body shuddered, wrenching as his nervous system started rapid firing, a swan song before it melted inside him.
Steve watched the men’s breath ghost in front of them as they talked, the flash of a smile from the blond man as he gestured about something in his story. Nobody in his family would know what his last moments alive had been like, or that they had taken place in a forest with a dog and a man with an ugly scar.
He ducked into the doorway, hiding the penthouse from view just in case Tony came running out. But there was only silence, then the sound of the doors closing and the jerk of the elevator as he descended to the spacious garage.
“Like right there,” Tony said, scooting closer. “You’re being all shifty.”
Tony had to miss the sex. Or at least the pride that came with being the partner of a man who looked like Steve. Where people might not have passed him a glance before the serum, he was no idiot. He was physical perfection—or as close as they could get on earth. Steve knew it. Tony had said it many times.
“I’m turning it off,” Blaine grunted.
Peter gave him a look, his eyes slightly narrowed. “Yeah I do, Dad. Whenever I go over to Pops’ house, it’s like I get cut off from everyone else.”
Steve let out a sad little chuckle. “Not so sure about that.”
He stood up on shaky legs, grazing his fingers on Blaine’s shoulder like he did when moving up from behind him on mission. Habit.
Steve took a deep breath. The chatter trickled to nothing. They lurched right and left, up and down, waves slapping the sides as their boat broke off from the battleship to begin filing into a lane  of their own.
Steve tried to smile, but he wasn’t sure if it worked. “I know. But y’were right. I forgot. Mission first.”
He’d quit the Avengers eight months ago to take Tony to a ritzy rehab facility in Aspen, Colorado. It might’ve worked if Tony hadn’t somehow worked out how to get charters back to New York every couple of days. When Steve asked him what he could possibly need in New York when everything they needed was here, Tony couldn’t answer.
Steve had never thought of himself as a dog person, but now he couldn’t imagine life without his four pets. They gave his life routine and purpose—they needed him to survive. And since the town was so dog-friendly, the only places they couldn’t go were the restaurants. It was like having four kids. Kind of. They gave him something to focus on when exercise and painting weren’t enough.
“Steve,” Rhodey said kind of loudly. He looked over to where Pepper was showing a family past the entrance. A pained smile came to his face. “Invitation?”
Steve, who was quickly realizing that he shouldn’t be here. That this wedding wasn’t something he was supposed to attend. “Oh my god, Tony, I…”
“Dad’s right,” Peter said. “You should just try it, Pops.”
Rhodey licked his lips uncomfortably, and picked his way around the desks and equipment to sit in the seat Tony had just vacated.
And yeah, maybe he missed the way the sheets smelled like honeysuckle and how much he had loathed untangling himself from Tony’s arms to yank Peter into bed with them for a tickle fight.
When he couldn’t, Steve fell forward, landing harshly on the grimy subway floor. He caught himself with his hands, and pushed back up as effortlessly as he would have if he’d planned the fall.
Dread filled him immediately as he remembered Thor’s wine, and…Thor’s wine. He could remember following Tony down to the dance floor, but the rest had surely been a dream. There was no way it had actually happened the way he was remembering.
“Are you—can you even do drugs?” Tony whispered, but he was clearly upset.
“Twice?”
“Steve?”
Steve nodded once, knowing full well he would never set foot there again. He didn’t belong there. That was Peter and Tony’s place.
“No, I didn’t think that,” Tony said with a shake of his head.
Steve wasn’t even sure if it was Jackson’s first wedding. He hadn’t thought to ask.
His vision was going hazy…and red. Unless his eyes were closing and he hadn’t realized it?
He fed his dogs and stood back as they attacked their food, crossing his arms. Then he turned his gaze to look out the screen door to where Jackson was holding Tony to his chest in a hug and kissing his hair.
“He said it would take a year or so. It’s been a year and he still fights us,” Wanda said. “At what point do we decide to stop hefting his burden?”
“You don’t have to,” Steve said, watching him carefully. “But if you want to, there’s plenty here. I was going to put what I don’t eat in some Tupperware and have leftovers later this week.”
Handlers were different. Handlers had told him the mission objective, a few loose parameters, and sent him on his way.  He had been allowed to hand select and modify each weapon to his liking, wear what he wanted, grow his hair out and only shave if he felt like it. Even the muzzle had been his choice, though he knew Steve didn’t like to know that. It hadn’t been a muzzle anyway. Just a mask.
Steve brushed some grass clippings from his pants before standing and looking out into the sea of yellow grasses. To the west was a thin treeline with thick brush, and to the northeast were thickets and a few pockets of pine. The rest was prairie grass and wild wheat varieties, smattered with the occasional thornbush.
Winona watched him carefully, her voice quiet when she spoke: “You’ve been approved.”
“You almost forgot it,” Tony panted, handing it over.
Everything in his mind suddenly went dark, and the crowd seemed to melt away before his eyes except for two people across the way.
Steve wanted to warn him, but could never find the heart. It was too late to do anything about it anyway. And Emory would have him.
They weren’t good.
The only thing they had in common was their solitary lifestyles. Tony liked to be alone in his lab wih his loud music and robots, while Steve didn’t have a choice was to sit by himself in a house or a tower or an apartment he didn’t own, maybe listening to NPR or to nothing at all.
Tony still didn’t understand how he could love his little girl so much and his own father couldn’t even come to his science fair in seventh grade.
“Bye, Shellhead,” Steve said quickly, hanging up the call.
Still, better than nothing.
Tony turned, offering him a little indignant smirk.
There was no telling when Steve would get home, though he would hopefully get a seven hour heads up from Natasha once the mission was complete. Tony’s job would be to make sure no one tailed them home, which was going to be difficult if it coincided with  Morgan’s art class.
He had to be cursed. He had to be.
“I know, but…” Steve frowned.
“It’s just wine,” Thor chuckled. “One glass will not intoxicate you.”
Part of him didn’t even want to get married, just to avoid any similarities from that other dimension. Tony wanted a baby eventually, so Steve had insisted they adopt a girl. He didn’t know if he’d be able to stand having a son that might look or sound anything like Peter.
Tony snorted. “If anyone else said that to me, I’d think that they were trying to pressure me into sex.” His eyes finally met Steve’s. “But Captain America would never dare.”
Steve’s hand folded over his. It was just a gentle hold, but Tony pulled his hand away.
“Looks like we’re here, Ms. Richards,” Steve said with a false smile.
Steve nodded. “Where’s your ring?”
“I was going to ask you the same thing,” Winona said, leaning back in her chair. She sat with her back straight, perfect posture and poise. She was someone who could adopt a kid no problem.
Steve wrestled his restraints as Tony smoothed back his hair.
“What’d you to today, hotshot?” Bucky asked, handing the spoon back over.
“I agree. We don’t see many kids her age taking this experience as an actual mentorship in art—I mean, their little kids, of course they don’t—but she genuinely wants to learn.”
But he had already taken a step back, ready to bolt.
“You know what it means,” Tony muttered.  He grabbed his coffees and handed them over to Steve. “Let’s go.”
Steve’s brow furrowed, scanning over Bucky’s face like a new person was sitting there. “Buck, I—“
They ended up staying in bed all day. Steve orgasmed nine times, three times inside Tony, twice with Tony inside him, once by Tony’s mouth, twice by his hand, and once from Tony’s tongue.
“I like the guy,” Tony snapped without malice. “Yes, like-like, crushy-wushy, he can be my valentine shit.”
Bucky frowned at him and then glanced to Blaine and Sam. “Can you give us a minute? Lemme talk to him.”
Rhodey and Pepper were checking people in before they were being sent past the picket fence and off to the beach where Jackson and Tony were greeting everyone. Steve couldn’t really see any of that, but news travelled fast down the line.
Steve leaned his head against the doorframe, looking up to Bucky’s bedroom window where a golden light shone through.
Tony kissed him. It lingered, and Steve opened his eyes, momentarily struggling against Tony’s mouth because it hurt—it was burning—
He let out a little huff, closing his eyes. He tried to remember what it felt like when he used to do this for real, relaxing his palms just slightly, letting his nose brush against Tony’s.
Tony reached forward, scooping up tomato sauce on his fingertip. He dabbed it on his nose, watching at Morgan’s eyes went huge.
Well, at least it wouldn’t be as painful as Steve had originally planned.
Tony’s smile quirked at the corner when he winked, then a sigh escaped his lips.
“Can’t count my chickens before they hatch,” Tony said, and his face went a little somber. “If you do this for me, it would mean a lot. It would go a long way in repairing what, uh, happened.”
“That’s not very healthy.”
A dog was staring at him, its tongue lolling out and eyes vacant. There was a faint pounding in his head that he soon realized was the sound of gunfire. He groaned and sat up—until Blaine shoved him back down.
Jackson took his hand and gave a few firm pumps, but his brow was furrowed. “Steve, aren’t you staying? The reception is just a little ways down the beach. We’ll all be going over there in a few minutes.”
Blaine sighed. “Look, I get it. But we’ve been doing this for two hours,” he said, scratching at his stubble. “You can beat the shit out of anyone, we both know that.”
He tried Steve’s therapist, but she refused to acknowledge that she was even seeing a Steve Rogers.
He didn’t know if he could live comfortably in a world where Tony was there, but not with him. Every time Tony left, Steve waited for him to come back. He saved up trinkets in the form of stories, jokes—even took pictures on his phone just to be able to tell Tony about them.
It was Tony’s turn to frown, though only slightly. “Kiss me again and I don’t have to tell you bad news.”
It feels like everything is finally clicking into place. Here Steve is, doing the one thing he couldn’t stop thinking about, and doing it well. He’s come a long way from the barrack-romps, in his opinion.
No one knows. No one could possibly know. It’s something that he’s kept hidden, kept private for so, so long, and it can’t be identified. He can’t have it out. He can’t be out. This cannot be happening.
Steve’s stomach starts to turn. But Fury said that had to do it together...or had he? Had Steve orchestrated the whole thing? Without even meaning to?
It’s not that Steve’s homophobic. Really, he’s fine with gay people. The only problem is that he might....be one.
“Yeah! Or, three; It’s a trap. For me, or maybe someone else within Shield that’s gay.”
“I haven’t told him yet. If you wanna tell him, then please, be my guest. Put it on his calendar while you’re at it.”
“Sure,” Fury says, an inkling of confusion on his face. “Do this mission however you want, I don’t care. Just get the hell out of here and secure those damn weapons.”
Having a crush on someone does not mean the mission is high-stakes. Steve’s feelings will not jeopardize this, because this is an important mission and Fury would skin him alive.
After careful consideration, Steve schooled his face into neutrality. “Fury said we had to be undercover. Both of us. Undercover, together.”
Tony holds up the case that he grabbed from the front seat of the car. “We secured the weapons, though. Wasn’t that the whole point of the mission?”
Tony is known to forget missions due to projects of his that take up more of his time, so he’s told multiple times what, where, and when the mission is. He’s only shown up to five. Steve completed over three hundred just in the past two years.
“I’m helping Rogers get into character.”
“Well, you’ll both have to be undercover at a gay bar,” Fury says. “Which means you’ll have to look the part.”
Of course, the occasional visit turned into a weekly thing, which then turned into Steve stopping by the workshop at least once a day to see what Tony was doing.
The walk to the elevator is a short one. Not quick enough, unfortunately, to ward away his thoughts.
Tony brightens considerably. “Sure.”
“Now,” Tony continues, “I have a few theories. One; our enemy, who may or may not be AIM, is gay and chose a familiar place. Two; the thieves thought to go somewhere where they thought Shield would never follow, which is fairly accurate, I do say so myself. I’m probably one of the only people who-”
Tony nods and darts his tongue out to wet his lips. Without meaning to, Steve tracks the movement, not noticing that Tony’s watching him.
Yeah, Tony telling the truth when he said that revealing clothes was the dress code. All the men here (and a couple women, Steve later notices) are dressed in low-cut shirts and tight, form-fitting pants. Some have on fedoras. Steve makes a mental note to stay away from those people.
“Looks like it,” Iron Man replied.
“Hot chocolate for one Steve.” That was him. “Coming right up.”
Well, he really was an idiot. Tony chuckled to himself as he crouched down with her, following her finger with his own. “Wow,” he breathed, genuinely impressed. “You’re smarter than me, you know that?”
“Tony—“
“She was the secret.”
If not, he had four hundred thousand other ways to make sure he didn’t give up on the man he loved. Not this time. Not ever again.
“Remember those poison dart monster things?” Iron man asked. “Well, I think those were babies, and momma’s here to exact revenge.”
A spasm rippled through Steve’s features for a moment, as though he might laugh. “ ‘Course not. Is your dad on his way?”
“I’m being stupid,” Tony said matter-of-factly.
“Stop talkin’ like that, Steve,” Bucky said with a bit of a quiver in his voice. “You got us, remember? You’ve got me and Sam, your new Army pals back in whereverthefuck, Natasha, Barton, Banner, the Thor guy—all of us.”
Tony shook his head. “Gets old. You can only walk through it so many times.”
He had tried to start a new life for himself while just tasting the delicacies of the fight. Sleeping in beds far too soft with a man who had spoken sickly sweet words in his ears while falling out of love with him.
“First we need to establish what ‘pursue’ means,” Rhodey said, pouring a glass of juice for Tony.
“I think I’ll give her a Cap figure next time I come,” Rhodey murmured.
That made him prickle. “It’s not that simple, Winona,” he growled. “As I’m sure you can imagine, this relationship is a little unconventional, and the other half of this unconventional relationship just so happens to be the poster boy for everything perfect all the time.”
Tony Stark died on November 4
“Thor zapped it a few times, just seems to piss it off more,” Iron Man grumbled, dodging a spray of poison. “I could use your help on civilian evacuation though. We’re trying to herd this thing toward water but I’m not so sure that’s a good idea.”
The train announced the next stop, and a few passengers shuffled to make room for a bigger crowd. Steve noticed little compartments near the front and back of the train, and stepped closer to look at the picture descriptions on each one.
“He hates me,” Steve hissed, his words punctuated by his wetting lips. “He hates me and my sad little apartment and it’s my fault he thinks he failing! It’s my fault Tony! Hu—Hey--get off! Get off!
Emory cocked a brow, blue eyes blinking in confusion.
Steve realized he had just made a monumental decision on the spot, but he didn’t care. He knew it was for the best that he never read that letter. All it would have done was made him upset or maybe even make him want to talk to Tony, but it was much too late for that.
Morgan smiled at him and skipped at his side, so he lengthened his stride to match. Attendees turned, giving wide smiles and looks of genuine happiness. Little kids waved excitedly at Morgan, and Tony was surprised to see her wave enthusiastically in return. It seemed everyone adored her, and he was pretty sure none of these parents had ever even met her.
Bucky.
“Someone must have said I was coming,” Steve muttered, fidgeting with the cuffs of his sleeves. It was endearing to watch a man so beautiful struggle with something as simple as clothing. It could also be incredibly frustrating in the right context.
“You said you didn’t love me anymore. What else did I need to know, Tony?” Steve’s eyes opened, and he met Tony’s gaze, unafraid this time. That pulling in his heart had stilled, and the dark matter that had taken the place of all of that affection kept his entire being solid. There was no wanting now, no desire.
“I can’t exactly tell him right now,” Tony quipped.
“Morgan,” Steve said, looking down at her. “You know the way to the art room?”
The noise was muffled by the man’s skull, enough that Steve wasn’t worried about anyone hearing. He flipped the body over and tossed the gun, wordlessly scanning for an ID, swipe card, or something else they might be able to use later. He spotted an ID card with a barcode and yanked it from the man’s belt.
Then the line went dead.
Someone had mentioned to him a few days ago that kids could be nurtured to a certain point, then they developed on their own. Parents could act like bumpers in a bowling alley, but ultimately the ball was going to make it to the pins sometime, and it wasn’t always going to be a strike.
“I have no idea,” Tony responded, still staring at the closed door. “You think this was some kind of prank?”
Tony can’t tear himself from Steve’s intense gaze. A horde of wild horses trotting through their room wouldn’t have been enough to rip his eyes from his husband’s in that moment. “What-” Tony runs his tongue across his bottom lip and Steve’s eyes quickly dips to follow the motion, his pupils growing bigger at the sight. “What do you mean?” Tony hasn’t felt this small and insecure since before Steve had claimed him. It’s not a feeling he’s missed.
“I’m yours,” Steve promised on a gasp, when Tony started up a slow grind. “Forever and always.”
Back then, the prince had seemed imaginary – taking on opponents double his size with nothing but a shield, not even a fucking sword, and getting the beating of a lifetime. He’d been beautiful in his fierceness even as he was defeated again and again, blond hair in a loose braid down his back, sweat pouring down his slender frame. He’d obviously still been growing into his limbs and been in the process of bulking up. Even in his drunken state, Tony had been unable to take his eyes off of him.
“You love when I’m being a little shit,” Steve pointed out and bent down to kiss Tony hungrily.
“I’m serious, Tony,” Steve said, grimly.
“No. He’s got a brain,” Natasha agreed. “He’s not stupid, Steve, so why won’t you just talk to him? State your intentions clearly.”
Steve had no idea where Peter’s ability to shamelessly confess everything he may have done, right or wrong, came from, but he appreciated it all the same. It made it easier to make peace between Rhia and Patrick every time they argued. Patrick was passionate and stubborn to the point of obstinacy sometimes – the apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree, Steve thought contritely – and had a hard time admitting when he was wrong. It wasn’t a flaw as much as it was youth and the belief that he was always right, even if Steve or Tony corrected him.
“Jerk,” Steve answered automatically, without heat. “Go, I’ll see you soon.”
“Alphas! You’re all hopeless.”
Stone tries to break Tony’s hold on his hair with a snarl, but Tony just tightens his grip and presses the tip of his dagger against Stone’s neck. Stone stills instantly, wide eyes staring at Tony without blinking.
Tony’s smile was small and a little private, as if he was thinking of a joke only he was privy of. “I’ll always come for you, Steve. You’re stuck with me for as long as you want me.”
“What’s that?” Steve asked absently, more interested in Tony neck, kissing and nipping at the soft skin until small marks blossomed, than Bucky’s relationship status.
“I had not really contemplated why omegas have been subjected to laws written to suppress and restrict them before I met Tony. I am ashamed to admit that while I have never liked bullies and have fought them on occasion, I never really had to think about what omegas have to live with, before he pointed out my own privilege to me. As an alpha I have no one to answer to, save the Gods and laws written by other alphas. Why is it different for omegas?”
“Love you, love, you
“Steve!” the man yelled, arm waving as he came closer. Steve could make out the simple, red gambeson and the brown leather pants the man wore. That wasn’t right. Steve hadn’t seen anyone on this field wearing at least some armour. What was the man yelling about?
“No,” Tony said at length, when the silence threatened to become oppressing. Steve’s hand dropped and he chewed the inside of his cheek for a moment, his jaw flexing. Here it comes, Tony thought. The indignation, the entitlement and demands for him to obey. It was always the same.
“What’s wrong?” Steve asked softly, reaching out to let two fingers slowly slide from Tony’s shoulder down to his hand soothingly.
“What’re you smirking about?” Steve asked, suspicious.
The beating of your heart,
“Peter, stop!” she yelled in Peter’s face, startling him out of his crying jag. “You’re not really upset, stop messing with Patrick.”
“He’s the omega Steve’s trying to court,” Nat explained with an eye-roll. “Only he’s not really swayed by our mighty prince’s endeavors.”
The smell of your hair,
Thor frowned. “I do not follow your train of thought.”
“I said I was sorry.”
Tony snorted. “You could say that. I never could’ve imagined that you’d be this huge troll with the driest sense of humor, or that you’re the stubbornest man in the country.”
“My shield!” Steve exclaimed, the sight of it with its white star filling him with such relief his knees turned weak.
Steve shrugged, as if it was totally normal for him to be out and about in this part of Manhattan at a time of night when most nobles kept themselves in relative safety and comfort in their homes on the Upper East Side.
Steve’s face softened and he leaned in to hold Tony close, love shining in his beautiful, blue eyes. “But you still love this alpha, no matter how hopeless I am?”
“I wanted to have your time for the rest of the day, if Consort Stark would be so inclined,” he smiled as he bent down to press a kiss to Tony’s full lips. Mmmm, he could do that all day.
“You’re a fucking troll.” Tony had to laugh, charmed. He couldn’t even find it in himself to get mad. “You followed me here, didn’t you?”
“Mm-hmm. Keep telling yourself that. I don’t understand why you just don’t accept his courting.Why do you resist it when both of you could be happy together?”
Tony looked shifty. “Maybe.”
It’s like he’s been punched in the chest. He can’t help the small flinch and quickly ducks his gaze, so Steve can’t see how miserable his words make him. Steve’s fingers gently grip his chin, thumb tenderly brushing the edge of Tony’s beard when he forces Tony to raise his face, to stare deeply into Tony’s pain-filled eyes. “I can’t deny I think he’s beautiful”, Steve repeats, “but it’s not for the reason you think, Tony.”
Yeah, what business did two, poor omegas have at the castle at a feast thrown by the King himself in honor of the tournament and its champion?
“You’re killing me,” Steve gritted out, head falling back against the pillows, groaning from deep within his chest when Tony took mercy on him and swallowed his length, taking it deep in his throat.
Ignoring Steve’s grumbles, she ordered the servants to dry him off, dress him, braid his hair and doll him up with the manic fervor of a conductor leading an orchestra through an intricate opera. Steve didn’t even have a chance to get his wits about him before he was shoved into Bucky’s waiting arms with a, “Happy claiming, your Highness!” and brought to the throne room. It felt like he’d been flung into a tornado and barely escaped intact.
Tony shrinks in on himself and tries to not listen, he really, really does, but he can’t help it when he’s stuck staring at his mate, taking in Steve’s gentle expression and Hani’s smitten face. It hurts. By the gods how it hurts, to see Steve give that kind of attention to someone else. Someone younger and prettier than Tony.
“I have no idea,” Steve said, just as confused.
Steve fell and the crow roared. Air was hard to get as he lay on his back, panting and with blood running into his eyes. His opponent leaned over him; wooden hammer raised over his head to deliver the victory blow. Steve gritted his teeth through the pain blooming in his side, where Thor had managed to get a hit in. His ribs screamed and with a roar of anger, Steve rolled out of the way when the hammer fell. It hit the sand hard, showering his back with tiny pebbles.
“They’ve already waited three weeks!” Pepper shrieked. Tony winced and rubbed at his abused ear.
“My ploy,” Stone says slowly, like he’s talking to a child. It makes Tony’s hackles rise. “I never thought I’d be able to come between you and your king. But look.” He makes a sweeping motion, encompassing the two of them. “Here we stand. You, me… alone.” Stone takes a step closer, making Tony back up. He does not want Stone any closer than this.
“Doesn’t look like it when he seems to enjoy your omega’s company over mine,” Tony muttered petulantly. He knew he was unfair but he couldn’t help it. It was the first time he’d ever felt jealous, wasn’t he allowed even a smidge of pettiness?
The hand stopped and Tony whined when Steve drew back. “No, don’t stop,” he begged.
On and on they walked, winding their way through a maze of corridors, side passages, empty rooms and so many stairs. The eerie feeling of emptiness resonating throughout the place gave Steve the creeps. Things got a little sticky when a small group of men ran out of a side corridor, right into their midst. They concentrated on Tony, deeming him the bigger threat in his armor and Steve was more than happy to take advantage of the opportunity.
“I wasn’t worried,” Bucky said, though they both knew he was lying.
Steve glanced up at it and then looked back at his cards. He had one three. Pearson had a ton of cards so he probably had one or two threes, and Blaine would be the guy to take the risk and put down two bullshit cards.
Emory caught the look of panic on Steve’s face and frowned. He shook his head.
“A lot,” Rhodey said around a sip of his drink. “Still like being a dad?”
Steve glanced behind them once and then took a chair, wincing slightly at the grating noise of metal against wood.
Steve was quick in the shower, but when he moved to leave Tony to wash, Tony’s hand folded over his. He knew what was being asked before Tony did anything, so he pulled his hand away. Tony’s eyes were so vacant that Steve wasn’t even sure he’d recognize him if this same man approached him on the street.
Tony had stopped walking.
Now that was something Steve had never anticipated hearing. Tony never said the word “need.” Not unless he was desperate, or under threat. Or someone he loved was under threat.
The grounds were the heart of the base. Despite the white, clean interior of the training facilities, the grounds were in the middle of nothing but dust, shit, and sand in the middle of Saudi Arabia. Once a powerhouse for its oil refineries, after they had dried up the place became a wasteland. America saw the chance and took it.
“And here comes my darling,” Tony announced far too loudly, all but shoving past Winona as Steve rather hurriedly entered the room.
Steve nodded minutely. “So much quieter upstate. Forgot how loud it is in the city.”
Nobody really ever touched him, Steve realized. He just wasn’t a touchy person.
An explosion rocked the earth beneath them and Steve shut his eyes as the sky above turned a bright orange over Blaine’s shoulder.
Tony flinched, but didn’t refute it. “I wanted to tell you before you left,” he said quietly. “But I was too afraid—”
“Can’t have a single lash out of place,” Tony grinned. He leaned in, pressing their lips together for a gentle kiss. “You ready?”
Tony closed his eyes, pinching the bridge of his nose. Now he felt like he had to call and warn him. Was it bad that he wouldn’t? They weren’t married anymore, there was no rule on secret-keeping.
“Nope. Not true at all. This is why I’m not leaving you alone. You’ll have yourself convinced you don’t mean anything to either of us by the time Peter comes back next week.” Tony sighed. “Steve, you’re being fucking ridiculous right now. Peter needs you. If he’d only had me, he’d be in rehab by now. Quit acting like you’ve never done anything good for him.”
“Stop right there,” Steve said, shaking his head. “I think it’s better that we don’t talk about that stuff anymore. If we’re going to stay close.”
Damn it all to hell.
They all knew that most of them weren’t going to make it. The officials hadn’t said anything about it, but they knew. Machine guns and heavy weaponry lined the beaches, and mines were presumably littered all over the sand. Mortars would be shot and they would be shelled relentlessly. So many men were being sent on this mission that Steve was sure they expected high casualties.
All of a sudden Steve’s eyes were hot again, itching with tears that were thick with salt.
“Yeah, I know,” Peter said distractedly. “They want to film in the Tower. And do you have Pops’ old address? They want to ask to see if they can film there too. Just to get the feel of what kind of places I grew up in.”
“Yeah,” Blaine said, his smile catching the moonlight. “But are you sure you wanna go back? We’ve got two more days of leave.”
Tony regained his bearings and hated himself for saying that, even if he did think it was the truth. At least he hadn’t said what he was really thinking:
“That’s not what I meant.”
And now here he was, just a juicy piece of gossip attending his ex-husband’s wedding.
“What kind of medicine did Bucky accidentally give me on my seventeenth birthday?”
Just the burning of his raw skin as he was flayed and exposed to the world’s harsh spotlight.
“Tony,” he gritted, but his hips were moving, working into Tony’s hand. “We just cleaned up.”
“I would really appreciate that,” Steve said, politely, his mouth free of food. How he ever managed to finish a meal was a mystery to Tony, but Steve’s plate was always picked clean by the end of the meal.
“Just shut up, Steve,” Tony snapped.
“Yeah,” Steve said repeated, emotion tugging insistently now.
The hurt that leapt up in his gut made his eyes hot and itchy.
A dimension away, Tony adjusted parts on a new McLaren in his garage, only occasionally glancing at the hologram feed from his nanobots. He paused for a moment when Tony and Steve exited the car, his chest pulling painfully at the sight of Steve so excited, so happy. He glanced at his watch, swearing under his breath.
Steve knew what that meant. He shook his head and guided Tony toward the door. “You can give my lawyer a call in the morning and I’ll let her know my thoughts.”
But he had seen. The moment they had completed their task, how Tony had paused, how he had brought a hand to his heart for just moment, the way humans sometimes did upon realizing they were no longer wearing a piece of jewelry they always had on.
Steve clenched his jaw, shooting arrows at Tony with his eyes.
“No, Tony,” Steve shook his head.  “That’s what changed my mind. When you first told me you adopted a kid I was terrified. Honestly, I didn’t think you were ready for a child and I didn’t want to be part of it more than I already had been. I know that’s why you set all of this up in the first place.”
This time, Tony let him.
“Sure. I’d love to.”
Bucky glared at him, chewing on the inside of his cheek.
Even so, had Rhodey ever had “real relationship stuff?” No, no he hadn’t. So he wasn’t allowed to talk any shit.
Steve pulled up his rifle and fired at one of the oncoming dogs. One flipped head over heels into the snow with a yelp.
They both knew his question had been an attempt to stall.
Furled, wrinkled ashes flaked onto the concrete floor, all traces of Tony’s last words burned away.
“Steve…I wanted to write. I wanted to—”
Blaine put the syringe in a pouch and dropped it to the floor before crushing it beneath his boot. When he picked it up again, he placed it into his pack. His hand lingered inside for a moment. Steve turned his head to see what was causing him to hesitate.
Papers didn’t talk about that one.
“Nothin’,” Steve said, scooping up some noodles and slurping them down.
It would have been nice, though, for Tony to ask this time.  Just in case he’d changed, just in case he wasn’t the person Tony had known before.
His movements were flawlessly smooth, having practiced the same techniques over and over again with Blaine in the sparring ring. Adrenaline flooded through his bloodstream as he wrenched the man’s head around and rammed a knee into his spine. The man clamored for his weapon but Steve slammed him face-first into the wall and delivered a punch to the base of his neck.
He was very handsome, with a square jaw, dark hair, and just the right amount of stubble. His eyes were hazel, a green and gold mix. He smelled like expensive cologne, and the suit he was wearing was definitely tailored.
“You’re welcome to sleep on the floor, if you’ll be more comfortable there,” Tony muttered, shifting his position.
“Your mission,” Sarah said to him, bending down, so they were on the same eye level. “Is to stay with me. Alright, soldier?”
“Tony,” Steve says, swallowing thickly. Tony glances at him, still clearly worried, though never taking his eyes off the road.
Huh. That’s a piece of information Steve will definitely be looking into later.
Looking smug as Maria hands him the keys, Tony gets into the driver’s seat of the car, groaning as he sinks into the soft leather. The sound, unfortunately, makes something inside Steve unfurl, and he quickly thinks of Fury talking about gay fashion choices to control himself.
“Well, I’m actually busy, so-”
Yeah, he’s right. It’s fine. Except Steve would never be able to touch Tony like that again, or call ‘dear’ or ‘darling’ or dance with him-
“I have to tell you something,” Steve manages to get out. This is it. He needs to say this. This is what it all comes down to. This exact-
The walk into the bar isn’t tense like the one to Fury’s office a few hours before; it’s fun, freeing, and sets the evening up to be something promising. Steve just hopes that nothing too drastic happens.
“Are you two done?” Fury says, eyebrows raised.
“What?” Steve exclaims. “Is there something-”
He agrees with it.
Tony’s mouth snaps shut, and he considers this for a moment before nodding. “Alright. Anything else?”
“We have to retrieve high-class weapons that were stolen from SHIELD.”
Of course, when Steve thinks back (again) to before the ice, he had relations with men and women, placing him in the bisexual category. Maybe he shouldn’t be in any group. He knows that he likes guys and girls; shouldn’t that be enough?
“Steve-”
“You know, Stark, there’s something fairly obvious right now that I could point out-“
Steve almost opens his mouth to prove Tony wrong, then realizes he would be outing himself in the process and keeps it shut.
Steve waves him off. “I’m fine, I’m fine. It’s just-“
“A gay bar,” Fury finishes for him, and Steve’s mind blanks.
Steve and Tony both nod.
“The gay bar,” Fury answers.
Sometimes, Steve feels a prick on his neck, all too used to being watched from years on the field, and when he looks around, he sees Tony looking at the ground or the ceiling.
“Tony.”
Tony merely laughs. “He wanted to take you home, S-uh, Chris.”
“What?” He asks.
Fury’s voice crackles over the intercoms. “We also have activity in the back room. Keep an eye out.”
, a voice whispers in the back of Steve’s mind as he closes the door.
A little while back, during one of Steve’s restless nights, he decided to look up online different sexualities and what they mean. There are a lot. Some Steve has heard of, like gay and straight, and some are entirely new to him, like allosexual and androsexual.
“What if we shorten it to just Chris Evans? It’s short, simple, rolls off the tongue.”
And, in that small, dingy Brooklyn apartment, Steve’s mother smiled down at him, sadness etched into her tear stained, tired face. Even so, she was the most beautiful woman Steve had ever seen, and not a day goes by that he doesn’t miss her.
Steve shakes his head. “What?”
“Oh, I don’t like that.”
“Sir, yes, sir!” Tony chirps, grabbing his fake ID and strolling out of the room, leaving no choice but for Steve to give Fury a quick goodbye as he tries to catch up to Tony, who’s waiting outside the door for him.
Fuck.
“We have eyes on you both, by the way.” Clint’s voice cuts through the chatter, and Steve feels Tony scowl.
Tony is Steve’s friend.
“I’ll walk you to your suite,” Tony says, and Steve’s too tired to argue. Instead, he nods, and presses the elevator button for it.
“This doesn’t usually happen.” He remarks softly, moving forward to see what the hell is going on.
Fury sighs and hands Steve his fake ID and driver’s license. It looks surprisingly real, which isn’t that much of a surprise considering SHIELD has some of the best technology available to do shit like this.
Tony is currently doing an impression of a fish out of water.
“Correct,” Maria says as she walks forward. “You have your identification?”
“Great,” Steve says, eyebrows raised. “Who?”
Fury nods. “I hope that won’t be a problem, Rogers.”
“How do you wanna do this? Should we have, like, a safe word, or something? What about Cancun? Like, that’s an infamous vacation of ours because some chick tried to kiss you and you tried to turn away, but then you moved back and told me what had happened, and I got super upset, but then you kissed me to show it didn’t mean anything and then we-”
Tony turns to face him, glaring at Steve as he does so. “Yes.”
“You know, I keep telling Fury that if he let me upgrade his security, his shit would be a hell of a lot safer, and every time, he ignores me,” Tony says, taking a sip of his coffee. “Well, look at what happened. Idiots. Who snatched them?”
He thinks.
More silence.
He must’ve been about five or six; it was around the time that he started to become curious about his father. Sarah, Steve’s mother, had to gently explain to her son that Joseph wasn’t coming back, that he was in a permanent place now, and that visiting him would be very difficult.
“I didn’t...um, I mean, I didn’t mean to, uh-” Steve starts, but is cut off by Tony whirling around to look at him, indignation written on his face.
“What’s up, Steve?”
The air around him starts to thicken, and the Earth herself seems to waver.
Steve sighs. “Fury assigned us on a mission.”
“I’m assuming,” He says, pointing at the Mercedes. “That that’s our car.”
“Great. There’s a car at the front ready to take you to the club.”
As Tony graciously checks himself out, Steve tries very hard to look anywhere but Tony’s ass. Okay, so he lied. Big deal. Tony looks absolutely gorgeous in a form-fitting black shirt and green pants so tight Steve worried that the second Tony tried to run, they would rip.
Tony decided at that exact moment to pull their bodies flush together, moving to the beat of the music, and start slowly grinding up against Steve with the sole intent of ruining Steve’s entire fucking life.
Fury glares at him, eye patch quivering. “We can’t have them falling into any more enemy hands.”
“He’s an asshole! And his tech is the shittiest I’ve ever seen.”
Tony merely blinks at him, innocent as can be. “What? A little music never hurt anybody.”
The glare that Fury sends him is enough to make Steve aware that he’s overstayed his welcome.
Then, Tony pulls Steve closer, hands on his hips, and Steve can feel his brain shutting down. Right now, all he can think about is Tony, who’s-
Steve bobs to the music, finally kind of seeing what all the fuss was about. It’s just beats and sounds. It’s designed to get people riled up, most likely.
Steve takes a few steps back. “Thank you, sir.”
Steve had nodded, not truly comprehending what was going on in the vast world of adulthood, and ran off to play with his toys.
“If I may interject here, Fury,” Tony says, taking a step forward. “In my experience, gay men don’t really give a shit about sports.”
“I know,” Steve says, desperately trying to reason with him. “But we are undercover. We have to act our parts. Which means you cannot go after him.”
“Not the-” Tony gestures vaguely to Steve’s arm and his body. “I’m talking about the car in front of me!”
“You know what, Steve? You know what really bothers me about Hardware?” Tony starts as he drives around back.
Steve chuckles again and goes to reply, stopping when he sees Tony’s eyes fixed on something behind them. They’re still swaying to the beat, and Steve wonders if he should still them.
“You-“ He points a finger at Steve, who steps back. “You stole my line! I’m supposed to confess my love to you, you idiot!”
So, he takes full advantage of it.
Even the makeup looks good. Something shiny actuated Tony’s nose and cheekbones; his eyebrows are done, and his beard is neatly trimmed just the way Tony likes it. He looks goddamn angelic.
“Move,” Tony snarls, shoving Steve out of the way so he could look in the mirror.
“Now, it’s not an ideal mission,” Fury starts. “But obtaining these weapons are very important. We can’t have them falling into enemy hands.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “That explains everything. AIM is, of course, notorious for being fucking pathetic.”
Then he kisses him.
“We’re supposed to be following you, Stark,” Fury grits out.
The ride home in the Mercedes is quiet. So is the walk up Stark Tower, where apparently literally everyone lives. As they should; it’s a big building.
Steve furrows his brow. “What?”
Steve smirks, not faltering when he eventually catches Fury’s annoyed gaze.
Steve smiles as Tony whips out of the street, Fury’s van trying to keep up with them. The club is only fifteen minutes away, but with the New York City traffic, who knows when they’ll arrive.
Great. He’s stuck.
“Fine,” Tony says, moving over to his cluttered desk where a cup of coffee sat, half empty. “What is it?”
But his clothes are simply the icing on the cake. It’s not that he didn’t see what was picked out for him, it’s that he was a bit preoccupied putting them on.
“You’re fine with this?” Steve asks, mostly because he’s barely okay with it himself.
“Oh, I’m driving.” Tony says immediately, looking incredibly stubborn. Steve opens his mouth to argue, thinks better of it, then closes it.
“You know, you don’t look too good either, Stark,” Steve says, causing Tony to look outraged and Fury to sigh.
Natasha just smirks, catches Steve’s eye, and winks. He sighs, a small smile on his face as he turns to face Tony.
“I’d punch anyone daring to try,” Steve promised grimly and with a giddy giggle, born out of pure joy, Tony threw his arms around Steve’s shoulders and pulled him down over him on the bed. The sound of their happy laughter and kisses filled the formerly, lonely space Tony had inhabited for so long by himself.
“Inaminute,” Tony slurred, sight still fuzzy, the light haloing everything he tried to set his eyes on. He blinked up at Steve, his smile all the more blinding and Tony could swear his blue eyes were glowing.
That was a strange wording, Steve thought, but he didn’t have the mental capacity right then and there to examine it deeper. He’d ask Tony about it later.
“I see,” Steve said calmly, almost coldly. He rarely got stern with their children, but he felt it prudent at the moment. “Then I guess I just have to speak to your papa and hear his opinion on this matter.”
“I have no doubt that the omega Stone has snuck in is the most… persuasive of the bunch”, Steve comments. He wipes his face clean of shaving cream and then pulls on a royal blue and white tunic, lastly fastening a wide leather belt around his trim waist.
Steve also had a great smile. His mother had always told him that.
Tony would never admit to anyone how his stomach erupted with thousands of butterflies when the door slammed open and Steve was carried inside on the shoulders of his friends and various nobles. They all stopped in their tracks when they caught sight of Tony and a hushed silence fell over them.
“Now the couple will exchange claiming gifts,” Yinsen intoned, over the excited chatter in the hall.
“The feast. In the castle. With all of the nobles in Manhattan and some from Asgard too? That feast?”
Tony’s heart is breaking inside of him, that’s what the tearing sensation in his chest is. He gets derailed from self-implosion when he feels it: a hand on his bare thigh, snuck inside the fold of his waistcloth. Stiffening in his seat, Tony glances at Stone, who smiles innocently even as his hand slides further up Tony’s leg.
“He’s resisting
Holding it to his chest, Tony swallowed back another batch of tears when they threatened with an encore. “All this time, you’ve kept it?”
“Harley’s sixteen, he’s more adult than Clint,” Steve interjected from the sidelines.
Now, fifteen years later, Steve never went anywhere without Bucky a step behind, ready to back him up in case of trouble. And, Steve had to admit as he made his way through the crowd towards the center of the commotion, he had a knack for getting into trouble on the best of days. Bucky swore behind him and clamped a hand on Steve’s shoulder, halting his steps where the throng of people began to thin. Steve caught a glance of a large man and a smaller one in front of him, before Bucky stopped him.
Steve snarled, hands circling Tony’s waist in a bruising hold as he pulled Tony down, hard, on his cock, keeping him still as Steve came in his ass; cock pulsing in time with Tony’s galloping heart. The warm, wet feeling of Steve’s cum deep inside him, the savage expression on Steve’s face, his teeth bared in a snarl, was too much for him and Tony erupted, cock untouched, cum spilling out and painting Steve’s heaving abs with sticky, white streaks.
“You’re gonna love this,” the voice behind him hissed and Tony braced himself for the inevitable while another body positioned itself in front of him; the smell of unwashed genitals, body odor and stale beer filling his nostrils. He was going to be violently sick.
He released Steve’s hard length with a last, lingering suck and crawled back up his panting, shivering form, straddling his trim waist and letting his hands caress the damp skin tenderly. Tony gave Steve a moment to catch his breath, waiting patiently until he could open his eyes properly.
“I want you to have this,” Steve said solemnly and reached out what he was holding to Tony.
Down the fingers go, touching and caressing the scars littering his arms and hands. “I see someone who has built and created many wonders with his hands – these are the marks of a master of his trade.”
Steve did the only thing he could and stewed in his anger; sitting in his cell and spending his time coming up with new ways to kill Schmidt and eradicate every trace of the man and his cult from the surface of the earth. He knew Nat had managed to escape the ambush, but Steve was starting to lose hope that anyone would come for them.
Just like that the murderous aura vanished from around Steve and he seemed totally carefree with a rakish grin curving his full lips. Damn him for being so pretty. Now Tony wouldn’t be able to think about anything other than how he wanted Steve to whisk him off to a secluded corner or broom closet and have his way with him.
“I’m pretty sure Lord Stone’s going to give you a new omega.”
He’d never felt more relaxed in his life, resting atop of Steve with his mate’s hard cock safely held within his body, binding them together intimately in a ritual as old as time, just the way nature had intended. Alpha and Omega, two halves of a whole, joined as one in fleeting moments like these.
“Steve,” Tony said, waiting patiently for Steve to look at him, reluctantly. “You never have to apologize for that.”
That we may never end our embrace.
“Get out of my fucking way!”
“It still would’ve been nice to have you at my side instead of knowing you were giving that upstart omega your attention,” Tony muttered to the floor, even as Steve’s unwavering faith in him made his aching heart swell.
“Omega sluts walking about in Heat doesn’t get a say in their partners,” the new man growled, grinding his hard-on against Tony’s leaking backside. “We’ll show you what happens when little tramps like you think they can get away with teasing us then not put out.”
“When his Highness gives me permission, I will!” Rhodes called back.
Steve looked back steadily. “I love you too. With all that I am.”
Ah well, it was true so Steve couldn’t be too bothered to care. If everyone had such an amazing mate as he had, they’d want to do it all the time too. He anchored a hand at the small of Tony’s back, rubbing gently. Tony shut his eyes in bliss as his muscles slowly softened under Steve’s touch.
“What’s the meaning of fighting if you can’t feel it afterwards?”
So came it that Yinsen, the bishop of Manhattan, crowned Steve king with as much pomp and splendor he could muster, squeezing every drop of ceremonial gratification out of the long hour it took him to bless Steve, himself, and everyone else in the throne room.
“Yeah,” Tony croaked. He got up on shaky legs, wobbling dangerously and he nearly fell but Steve caught him before he could crash to the floor. The moan Tony let out when he found himself pressed against Steve’s hard body was entirely involuntarily.
“I-I promise,” Tony stuttered, writhing underneath Steve when his hormones insisted on getting some action. Now!
“Oh yeah, I never said, did I?” Tony told him with a grin. “Two babies at the same time, a boy and a girl.”
Tony snorted and before Steve could stop him, he darted ahead, running and jumping over bodies on nimble feet towards safety. “Fat chance!” he threw tauntingly over his shoulder.
Steve frowns, startled and starting to look a little angry too. “Use you to gather information? Tony, I danced with Hani-“ he breaks off when Tony makes a noise like an enraged honey badger and quickly amends, “Stone’s omega, and suddenly you were gone and Nat said you’d stepped out for a minute and that Stone had fucking followed you. I had no idea what was going on until I came looking for you, heard Stone trying to seduce you and you flirting back!”
“Yeah?” Tony let go and Bucky’s knees immediately folded. “Thought so.” He took a firm grip around Bucky’s waist and started walking, leaving his friend with little choice but to come along. They picked their way down the path slowly, keeping an attentive eye on loose rocks so not to slip and get a fast trip down the steep slope.
“So… is that bad?” Steve sounded unsure. Tony had no problem ridding him of that ridiculous notion. He never wanted Steve doubting the depth of Tony’s feelings for him.
“Do you have a claiming gift in mind?” Tony changed the subject, his fingers tickling over Steve’s ribs and making him squirm at the sensation.
The kids loved him and even Tony had grudgingly admitted that the younger omega wasn’t so bad - once he’d stopped making cow-eyes at Steve that was – and Steve knew of more than one alpha who’d approached the beautiful omega and requested permission to court him. Hani, not having any family to do it on his behalf, had so far declined every entreaty.
Tony winced as he sat up. “Yeah, so they Claimed each other when it looked like Hydra was planning on sticking them in a room full of Heat-induced omegas. That put kibosh on the plan to turn Bucky into the fist of Hydra and kind of ended the entire endeavor. Well, except for their desire to have you father the other half of the planet, that’s not going to end soon.”
He always felt like crap after a Heat; it took a great toll on him the longer he went without an alpha’s knot. Tony knew, from his mother talking about it, that it would get better the day he was claimed and knotted properly by an alpha. He sighed. Steve hadn’t knotted him once; he hadn’t even undressed!
“You heard me,” Tony says, his nimble fingers getting back at weaving a portion of Steve’s thick, blond mane into an elaborate and gorgeous braid. “I saw him leading a cloaked figure with a chain around their neck into the keep when they arrived, and let me tell you…” Tony pauses and reaches for a pearl, expertly fastening it with a twist of his fingers. “He did a lot to make sure no one could catch a peek underneath that cloak.”
