I felt like I needed a bit of Tony and Pepper time, as much as I find their relationship in the films frustrating I do love their friendship.
‘Everything with Ross has just thrown up the fact that we can’t keep doing this by ourselves anymore,’ Tony says, looking down at his hands. ‘We should have seen it coming, but none of us picked up even a whisper of it. We’ve been too busy focussing on each other that we’ve not been looking at threats from outside, or at least not seeing them for what they are. We need someone who sees the things we don’t; someone who’s better at knowing things than we are.’
Another look casted between Tony and Natasha, “It’s not completely foul-proof, but it’s what we had time to come up with,” Natasha adds to try and wipe the disbelieving look off Clint’s face.
Steve drops Tony off at his dorm, despite the very convincing protests about saving gas and the dangers of driving while sleep deprived, Steve’s mind is running and his fingers twitching with the urge to draw that he insists he has to head home.
Tony makes work of dipping Bucky’s thigh into the water, slowly—so Bucky knows what to expect, and then running some saline solution over it to sterilize.
“Yeah alright alright, enough about me, what’s Mr. Picasso working on right now?” Tony asks, deflecting the attention back onto Steve.
Steve looks so relieved, dropping one of his hands out of Tony’s to cup his cheek, “I would love that a lot,” he says, before leaning in to softly kiss Tony on his forehead.
He has to clench his teeth together until they hurt to stop from protesting, but eventually turns back toward Red Skull. Looking straight into the eyes of the man who hurt Bucky, murdered, and plotted destruction all for his twisted scheme.
And then he’s darting back down the mountain, not bothering to let anyone else know what’s running through his head.
It’s the first time Steve’s seen him look sheepish and his brain absolutely eats it up, taking in the glossy look in his eyes and the coloring on his cheeks.
He can hear Steve softly murmuring to Bucky, Tony lets the words wash over him as well, Steve is a good talker when he needs to be.
The excitement of getting to see everyone’s reactions later when they dig into the warm muffins is already bubbling, but the one person he really wants to see enjoy one hasn’t been seen since a quick sleepy morning kiss goodbye. And if Steve is being completely honest with himself, maybe these muffins are being used as bait to get his boyfriend to come out of his lair soon, but no one can blame him for that.
Steve is reaching over Tony to grab a bag from a hidden spot, before pulling back to shake it at Tony, “Lifesaver Gummies?”
He sets out for his original destination but bypasses his bed, and heads straight for the expensive whiskey he stashes in his nightstand.
Tony looks tired, eye’s watery and low like he’s fighting to keep them open, his hair is a mess, but it usually is by this time, Steve’s heart clenches at the sight. He reaches a finger up to trace the red spot on Tony’s cheek where he must have had the knuckles of his hand resting on it for far too long.
After he’s got Bucky down, Steve’s come back from the car, even more soaked than before but with the kit in hand.
“C’mon Sourpatch, you know that you love me too much to kill me, who else would provide you with endless hours of entertainment?”
Tony has only smoked once with Rhodey, and it was the type of shit weed that barely gets you high and leaves you with a headache for the most of the day afterwards, so it wasn’t much of an experience.
Bucky’s breathing is heavy but sounds clear, so Tony isn’t too worried about anything internal happening.
Steve squeezes his hand back tightly, and Tony feels the beginnings of a warmth start to bloom in his chest.
Steve doesn’t notice him until they’re already past the halfway mark into the marathon. The once large crowd has thinned out considerably, but the moderators are doing their best at keeping the energy high. He only catches a few glances at first, mere glimpses between all of the shifting bodies, and Steve’s feet seem to make up their mind before his brain does, as he finds himself moving closer, intrigued.
Tony’s pissed that she’s right, “What am I supposed to do? Let them all pile on the jet and take them back home with us?”
And yet Tony has memories of sitting in companionable silence, Steve with a sketchbook in his hands and Tony with his tablet.
“Coming up with unique poses that translate onto paper sounds easier than it actually is,” Steve says, “I only have one more sketch to finish and it’s been breaking my brain for weeks.”
“That’s the thing, this wasn’t sanctioned, because Ross has flown the coop and gone on a secret side mission. He’s got a good-sized team behind him, and he’s not going to hesitate in using all the force he needs, he’s had a vendetta since the Raft breakout.”
“No one in their right mind is going out in this heat to buy sex toys Cap, old man Joe was in here a bit ago trying to haggle me for a discount on another pair of fuzzy handcuffs, but other than that we’re all dried out.”
“Never,” Steve says, shaking his head and tightening his fist around Tony, “Let me show you how much I don’t regret it.”
“Yeah, me and JARVIS got a baby girl on our hands, she might be small now, but they grow fast,” Tony explains as Steve has crouched down now, to get a better look at the tiniest octopus he’s ever seen.
Sleeping is also a no-go, he has to make do with staring out the window and wonder what’s going to be awaiting them in Edinburgh.
Painfully aware of the throbbing on the left side of his face, Tony reaches up to poke at his cheekbone, fingers coming back tinged with blood.
“Rhodey!” Tony shouts excitedly, “It’s not my fault you left me out here all by lonesome, who can blame me for keeping myself entertained?” Tony turns back toward Steve smiling warmly “I got myself a Steve now,” Tony adds, and Steve feels his back straighten on instinct, making himself taller and turning his chin up ever so slightly at this Rhodey.
A team meeting is scheduled for the end of the week, which discussion of calling the operation a failure or not will be had. Turns out Loki and Thor are cleverer than SHIELD anticipated, efficient at covering any tracks of stealing government technology to invent their newest Frost Giant line, from dildos to ball-gags, it’s got it all.
Who knows, the all-night distraction may very well just lead to a breakthrough in the ten-foot wall art block in his mind, that’s keeping him from finding the perfect pose to complete his portfolio. There’s nothing like a night of dancing to get your brain to shake itself loose.
With one last look at each other, Clint kicks the door open and Tony tenses at the sound of rifles clicking as they’re aimed at the team of three.
He couldn’t catch his breath, taking short gulps of air with no relief, and Steve was still standing there in front of him. And all Tony could do was scream, “
It’s awhile later and Tony’s grabbing some tools to burn through some SI projects. He realizes he hasn’t spoken to Natasha since the mission. It’s been a little over a week now, and while that’s not unusual for her to drop off the face of the earth from time to time, Tony is still a worry-wart.
But Steve just smiles at him, and says, “I thought I was going to have to wait forever for you to notice Octavia wasn’t the only thing keeping me coming around every day.”
Steve doesn’t reward that with a reply, instead focusing on double knotting the laces on his shoes, and then shrugging his jacket over his shoulders. He pats his pockets, mentally checking off that he’s not forgetting anything of importance and then steps out towards the front door.
Tony’s hands sweat the whole time him and Steve are eating their dinner, and for the first time in his life, Tony finds that he doesn’t have anything to say. Mind completely blank because this is definitely a date, and it’s definitely a date with the guy he’s been crushing on since he got to the Academy.
Rhodey leaves them both at that, and Tony hydrates as he was tasked to do, before jumping back into their previous rhythm, although this time with his arms wrapped loosely around Steve’s neck.
He’s reminded of his past few conversations with Steve, and how the other man had mentioned something about Hydra and kidnappings. Tony says as much to Natasha and she doesn’t look surprised.
He’s been avoiding mirrors, so Tony’s not even sure what the hell he looks like. He did shower before bed last night though, so it can’t possibly be
Tony waited a full 10 minutes with no reply before heading off to his workshop. Maybe Steve finally realized that they’re past help.
Tony didn't go to MIT studying electrical engineering for nothing, if not for something to engross himself into while avoiding the outside world and the feelings that come with it.
Sleeping is the last thing he wants to do. And yet, Steve is there, every night with warm embraces and soft words. He makes Tony want to
Natasha looks stricken for a moment, before her eyes widen and Tony has a second where feels like his insides are about to fall out from shock.
Steve almost starts to say it wasn’t Tony’s fault, because it wasn't, Tony has been battling and preparing for this war longer than all of them, but then Tony continues talking.
All of that was before now, and if there’s one thing Tony has learned about his life on earth; you can’t stop the bad things from happening. And you certainly can’t change them once they do.
Steve has to swallow down the lump growing in his throat, blink away the tears wanting to prick in the corner of his eyes, it wasn’t worth it. Their war was never worth losing the relationship they spent years building.
of living, breathing, it’s all hushed away. The thump of his heart, and the heart next to his, the only sound remaining.
The arms holding him tighten when he shifts slightly, the memories making his skin crawl, Steve’s probably awake, waiting for Tony to drop off. It won’t happen yet, almost every night for months he’s jerked awake, trembling and freezing.
Except every time he looks at his hands, he’s thrown back into that bunker in Siberia. His mind flashes in memories of Steve, a constant loop of
But they have no time to dawdle, and make it up two more floors unscathed, Tony now holding up the back, with his sore knees and bleeding cheek.
“You can thank Natasha, she was the one who figured it all out, I just provide the money to make it happen.” It sounds more bitter coming out then Tony meant for it to, but he’s not bothered to explain it differently.
“What’s goin’ on?” James said from behind them, coming down the hallway with Sam and Steve in tow. Steve’s eyes were red and he wasn’t meeting anyone’s gaze, but given what they’d all witnessed no one commented.
The camera watched Tony step back again and and give the man another once over before giving a tilt of his head towards a side door, quite obviously an invitation.
Tony’s body was tense against his and Steve could feel his breathing increase, the palm against his chest shaking slightly. Their thoughts were in tune because Tony bit out the word, “Timestamp.”
Kneeling next to Steve, was Tony. He looked so small, kneeling in the gore without his armor. His shoulders and arms were shaking as he reached out a trembling hand and pressed him fingers to the neck of Steve in the memory.
Next to Steve, Sam watched her lead T’Challa into the kitchen. “So, I think it’s safe to say he’s been here before, huh?” Steve nodded dumbly. “Yeah. Probably safe to assume that.” Sam hummed in agreement before he leaned over even closer to Steve and said, “He and Tony seem awfully close as well.” Steve snapped his head to the side and gave Sam his best glare. “What?” Sam shrugged. “Don’t bother telling me you didn’t notice that. I thought for sure I was going to hear Captain America growl.” Steve did his best to darken his glare, but only had the effect of making Sam’s smile widen.
“How about you confirm his theory on what that Super Soldier serum did for you.” James said as he waggled his eyebrows at Steve. “Come on, don’t be a blushing baby, Steve! I know you’ve thought about it. I also know you never got the chance to be with Peggy, or anyone else I'm guessing.” Steve blushed hard and looked at his feet. “You wanna talk about it before your first time?” James offered.
His team said their goodbyes to the people who had given them so much and Steve was last to step forward to do the same. Hugging those around him, Steve thanked them for everything they had done for them.
About 2 hours into the flight, they were all startled by the ring of the comms. Bucky pressed the button to answer the call and the video image of Natasha Romanoff popped up on the large screen.
She replied smugly. At that he laughed and began to plan out how he wanted to work on getting to know his teammates.
“Tony created Ultron because of Wanda’s vision, didn’t he?” Clint sighed. “And then we made him fight next to her and house her.” Natasha put a hand on his shoulder and said, “Come on Clint, we need to finish cleaning your head.” She wiped her eyes on her sleeve and tried to maintain some confidence in her step as the guided him out of the lab.
Natasha laid on her back, her eyes were wide and unseeing, blood on her forehead. There was no movement of her chest. Dead. Clint was close to her, his body upright but slumped at a gruesome angle, his quiver empty, blood running down his arms and face, his hands no longer had a grip on his bow or the last arrow across his lap. Thor was laying across the ground below them, his eyes closed, hammer lying just out of his reach. Again, no movement. Steve truly felt like he was going to lose his lunch any second now.
“You talk a good game about trust and teamwork and stronger together, but you don’t practice what you preach. You always work alone and you always keep things to yourself, yet you have the gall to fault me or anyone else when they do the same? If there is one thing Captain America can’t abide, its weakness. Guess what, Cap? Your weakness is that you never outgrew that kid who got into fistfights alone in back alleyways. You refuse to ask for help, you refuse to show anyone around you a crack in that Captain America persona.” He shook his head. “At least I’m aware of who I am. I don’t pretend not to have made mistakes or have massive faults. If I have a question I go to Nat, Bruce, Rhodey, and all of the other people that I am lucky are still in my life. When you have a question, you sit on it and refuse to show it to anyone else.”
After the doors closed, it was Steve and Tony alone. Tony turned in the direction Steve was standing. "He may not know it yet, but I know how sharp your hearing is, Captain."
It was Wong who spoke up with a shake of his head. “Stephen would never have done that! The Time Stone is more important than a single life.” He looked at the others and added, “I’m sorry. It doesn’t matter whose life.”
Steve looked forward to Bucky's calls to T'Challa. He had made Bucky promise he would call as often as possible and once Bucky had made it to New York and was safely in the Compound, he was good about checking in with the King a few times a week.
"And did you tell them where you were going? You left your family in a position to be just as worried as you were. Lucky for them, you all don't know how to disappear without help."
Tony focuses on the head of Steve’s cock, stopping his kisses for a moment to spit into his hand, reaching down and palming it over Steve, it’s messy and wet, and Tony can feel Steve’s cock twitch hard in his grip.
Steve's made his way to the left of Tony, studying the multiple screens in front of them, "Good,” he replies, “because I don't feel much like being a babysitter today.”
Steve's about to add that it's well justified, when Tony speaks up, "Thanos came to you for the stone?"
So, after you’ve been fighting the good fight, and paying the consequences for as long as he has, you’re just about ready to accept death as an adequate retirement plan.
Tony had told Vision to go wild, and boy did the android not disappoint. He likes to think at least some of that was old remnants of JARVIS inside him.
Everyone bursts into cheers as the first song begins blaring from the speakers, and Steve internally laughs at the song choice, because of course it’s Bowie. But then he spots a group of his friends in the crowd, and heads over to them, accepting their excited greetings as they all begin to dance together.
aliens destroy everything Tony has fought to protect. He let his guard down, let all his cracks and the half ass bandage job be shown for Steve to see, and he was mortified.
Tony’s smile falls off his face, memories of movie nights with the team, and dumb debates over fruit on pizza seem like a lifetime ago.
They spend a few moments catching their breath, while Steve’s cum cools on Tony’s skin, collecting their clothing and putting themselves back together in a blissed out comfortable silence. The squeaky ceiling fan above them is still trying it’s best to cool the temperature down, but the sweat on Tony’s lower back tells a different story.
“You’re amazing,” is all Steve could say, Tony never fails to be unbelievably incredible to Steve. God, he missed him so much.
“Steve,” Tony had said, voice small, while the others were talking among themselves, “It’s good to see you.”
He had warned them all, Steve especially. Now he’s putting his ass on the line, and he’s deeply regretting agreeing to this already.
“I saw him pack it a week ago,” Bucky says, then shrugs at the affronted look both Tony and Steve send him, “You are a bit predictable in that arena.”
It’s well into the afternoon when Tony’s just finishing up on the latest upgrades on some small projects for SI that Pepper insisted in several emails had to be done before the end of the week, or they’ll lose a chance to patent.
The point is, Tony accepted that he wasn’t gonna make it, and yet, he took that first breath, and he opened his eyes to Steve’s. And damn could he
And, he can feel himself clamming up, wanting to cut off all the emotions he can, until he can be alone to deal with them.
He sits in the common room for an hour and mulls over all his greatest fuck ups in life, this makes at least the top 20.
Bucky and Steve share a look, “Right before we were caught, Stevie here dropped his phone into this puddle, thing was dead and the look on his face had me in stitches,” Bucky remembers with a laugh in his voice.
Tony would know that brick like physique anyway, not that he’d admit that. He’s honestly not entirely sure if he’s dreaming this or not. Does he remember waking up this morning?
Tony slumps down onto the floor his back against the bed, and takes a long drink out of the bottle. Ignoring his shaking hands, he tells Friday to cut the lights.
Steve knows Tony’s just trying to be funny but he takes it seriously, nodding his head, “Together, always.”
He had just finished up in the workshop, letting FRIDAY get to work putting a fresh coat of paint on his new suit. Tony had intended to go straight to bed, needing a reprieve after the long hours spent deep in code. He was on his way to the staircase leading to his suite, when he passed by the door of his old Captain’s room. He’s never been inside, not even before everything went to hell. Tony might be curious (some might call it nosy), but he firmly believes in someone’s personal space staying that way.
It was his pick this week and Steve had never seen it, and that’s an injustice in itself. He had said as much the day before while at lunch with Wasp—who wholeheartedly agreed.
Tony’s nursing one hell of a hangover when he wakes up at noon the next day. He doesn’t know why in God’s name he decided sleeping on a couch in the common room was a smart move.
Not until Steve’s thumb comes up to wipe away a stray droplet that’s making its way down Tony’s chin.
Tony grounds himself and it may take him ten more minutes before he’s able to breathe normally and attempt to stand, but he manages.
Princess Shuri gives him a handful of kimoyo beads and makes him promise to bring their king back. Steve can only nod his head, tells her he’ll do everything he can. Okoye grabs her gently by the shoulders when she starts to sob again. She nods at him and he understands. Do everything he can and then some more. He hopes he looks as strong as he’s trying to project.
Once they’re safely slid into the oven, Steve gets to work on washing the dishes, the sleeves of his sweater rolled up to his elbows, and the apron covered in flour from an earlier accident still tied securely around his waist.
The shop today (that they’ve been stationed at for a mind-numbing 9 weeks now) has been slow, only a handful of customers stopping in. Most of them perusing the shelves and leaving with empty hands, plus a few teenagers Tony had the joy of kicking to the curb after they stumbled red-faced through a lie about forgetting their ID’s.
Once he’s done he leans back, watching Steve’s eye’s flutter open and his lips curve into a smile before letting the smoke exit his lungs.
But now, as they’re enclosed in another ship, headed for the place where Thanos gained the Soul Stone that helped him in completing his genocide, Steve and Tony have a real conversation.
He contemplates writing back for a full 5 minutes before decides it honestly can’t get any worse than it’s been.
Who the hell did Steve think he was? He wanted nothing to do with Avengers business or Tony, and then shows up at a mission. And what had they taken? Tony only remembered that after he had awoken on the jet, making sure to pass the info to Natasha. She had given him a curt nod, and a half smile before strutting off to do spy things.
But Steve just smiles sadly, dropping his head to look down at his boots, “I have to make it right, Tony.”
“Yeah yeah, listen Tones, I got a call from one of my military buddies and something big is going down.”
The rest of the week goes by fast enough, and Steve’s already getting ready to head out to the auditorium where he’ll be spending the next eight hours of his life dancing. There’s both excitement and nervous energy bubbling up inside of his stomach, some of his friends from class are going to be there so he’s not worried about being alone, but there’s something about the whole dance aspect that gets his heart pumping faster.
Steve sends him a grateful look, and Tony has to give himself a second to breathe through his internal freak out.
Clint sends a glare his way so heated, a lesser man would have gone up in flames in seconds, but Tony is not a lesser man.
He can’t bear to look at Steve, even though he’s barely 5 feet away. His headache is coming back full force now that the adrenaline is wearing off, and the exhaustion setting in.
Steve’s nostrils flare, he’s frustrated that they’ve come all this way to get nothing in return. They need a better answer than that.
Tomorrow they can go back to that site, and continue erasing Hydra from the planet with Tony in tow, but for now they’re content with just this.
“Jesus,” Tony looks over and yells to shut the three musketeers up, “You're coming back with us, and no not to get locked up, stop looking at me like that Barton,” he sighs loudly, “it’s your choice, stay here and hitchhike or come with us.”
“Yeah yeah, you say the same thing every week,” Steve says, shaking his head, “Now I’ll take this side and you get that one.”
“Let’s get some rest now Tony,” Steve says soothingly, before he begins to make work on helping Tony out of his day clothes and into a softer set of pajamas. He then sends Tony off into the bathroom to finish his night routine, while Steve pulls down both sides of the sheets, their shared bed now ready to house both of them for the rest of the night.
“That was one time Rhodey, and you know you can’t start a phone call with ‘I didn’t mean to break it Tony, I swear’.”
“Next time, just shake some sense into me please, because I very much enjoy this,” he says, grabbing Steve’s hand in his own, as they make their way over to the park.
“We were ambushed outside of their safe-house, we got separated, and those jerks got two into Buck before I could break free and get us out of there,” Steve answers guiltily.
Steve can only describe the face Tony makes as heartbreaking. His chest constricts as he watches Tony, who he thought had vanished since seeing him disappear into the sky, for the second time now, breathe, and talk, and be
“It wasn’t too late for you to get out of the weapons business, or to stop Ultron from blowing up the planet.”
Steve loves baking on his days off, it’s calming to him, the order of operations is clear; gather the ingredients, measure them out, pop it into the oven, and watch something he created all by himself come to a sweet fruition. It also helps that he’s usually alone when he bakes or just in comfortable silence with Natasha while she has her midday tea, his favorite songs playing softly in the background.
“Care for another dance, Tony?” Steve asks forwardly, and they begin to move together again, settling into their earlier groove now that they’ve successfully sussed each other out. The crowd seems to give them space of their own, or maybe Steve’s just so absolutely focused on not tripping over his own feet to impress Tony now, that everything around them dims down to a muted hum in the background.
They break apart, and Tony’s left panting against one of Steve’s shoulders, his head lolling to the side as Steve noses down his neck sucking a trail of cool kisses on hot skin. Steve’s body is generating so much heat against his, like he’s Tony’s own personal sauna, and the creaky ceiling fan on high above them is offering little relief.
Tony’s watching Rhodey take a few laps around the room, already noting down in his head a few adjustments.
Steve bites his lip, holding back a bucket load of things he wants to say, only letting his brain entertain the idea of reaching out and holding Tony in his arms again for a moment, and maybe, if allowed that is, the idea of kissing Tony, right here. He shakes it out after those few moments though, insecurity barging its way in.
But Clint and Natasha were called in by Fury last night for some side-op, leaving Tony alone with only Steve and Bruce, the latter of the two in back snoozing away while Tony makes enemies with the clock.
He shoots a repulsor blast at the pole Steve’s cuffed to and after it breaks, he’s off helping Sam out of his binds.
But for now, they need to get Octavia back into water, and there’s only one place big enough to hold her size comfortably. And, Tony’s not particularly happy about it.
“Good?” Steve asks, waiting for permission, and Tony can only nod, breathless at just the small gesture alone.
“Our messages haven’t been going the way I want them to, believe it or not I don’t want to anger you.”
In result, they’ve been under for over two months and have only made a smidgen of leeway in their mission to infiltrate the Odinson brother’s sex shop empire.
Up close like this, Steve notices more about him, the huge brown eyes, glittering with competitive light in the dark room, and how Steve is just the slightest bit taller than him, so he has to look up to meet Steve’s eyes. He spins around then, showing off before swaying his hips side to side, and Steve can’t help but throw his head back with a laugh, before doing a big spin and suave move of his own in retaliation.
They’re walking in sync up the first flight of stairs, “You think it’s more of Ross’ men, or…” Tony doesn't have to specify who.
Steve flicks her off over his shoulder, shutting the door quickly so he only has to hear her sing the first few lines of the Time of My Life, loudly and impressively off key.
“There’s 2 bodies around the corner, seem to be taking a mid afternoon nap, I guess we’re not alone.”
The bed still smells like Steve’s shampoo and a twinge metallic from Bucky, it’s comforting enough that Tony starts to lull to sleep, so he lets himself catch up on his lost sleep from the night before.
Tony’s face lights up, “That sounds perfect to me,” he replies happily, already pulling out every bowl and utensil he finds that looks like it even remotely pertains to baking. Steve watches on in silence for a moment, his heart blazing warm in his chest with all of those tender emotions again, Tony always knows just what he needs.
Tony remembers back to waking up after thinking his clock had officially run out, after he was falling and falling with nothing to catch him, he doesn’t want to think he was happy about it, he wasn’t—but he was ready to accept it.
It takes Enchantress all night, and several cases of food poured into Tony’s once immaculate hot tub later, to undo what Loki made a mess of but, Octavia finally gets turned back into her normal self. And she seems much more comfortable as she happily swims around her new tank, since her old one had shattered open on the sudden impact of her growth.
Tony runs his hands through his hair, taking a deep breath to recover from his honest to god near heart attack.
Just as he’s bending over to stick his mouth under the faucet, someone comes bounding into the room.
Tony nods his head, keeping Steve in one hand while leaning back to use his other hand to push down his briefs, his cock popping up into view.
The situation was this; some goon has set up several drone’s armed with explosives in hot spots of, guess where?
He’s scooped the batter into the muffin tins now, checking again to make sure they all got the same amount for uniformities sake, before using his thumb and index finger to sprinkle some sugar lightly over every muffin, the extra coating giving it that caramelized and crispy exterior he adores.
“My contact told me about Ross using his own team to stage what looked like kidnappings around Europe, specifically in places where Hydra had ties in the past, what better way to get Captain America caught in your trap than by using his biggest enemy since the 40’s.”
Barton opened his mouth to respond when Wanda put her hand on his arm and shook her head, communicating he should drop the subject for now. Clint looked angry, but obeyed.
So yes, tonight at the Gala would be fine. He would schmooze and sweet talk his way around the event all night seeming to have a wonderful time, and then he would go home feeling empty until he reunited with his little family that he had been fortunate enough to start building here in the Compound. He could forget for a while that half of his family had walked out on him. Then, he would fight with himself over the idea to go down to his workshop and consume as much alcohol as he could before he passed out.
She glared at him for a moment longer before finally saying, “Fine. Deal. But stop calling me that.” Turning away she started walking again, hearing him chuckle lightly and mutter, “Not likely.”
It seemed like time was crawling. Finally, they were at the Compound. After landing the QuinJet they all unbuckled and started to gather their things.
The SUV swerved as the guard’s radios came to life, the static voices reporting an attack on the caravan. Ross swore as the SUV banked hard left to avoid hitting one of their own. As they passed the wreck, they saw the Black Panther standing on top of the overturned car. Tony smirked at Ross through the blood. “Oops, thems the breaks. That’s the cavalry.”
"Quite right, Your Highness. Back to business. As I said, we are not only going to clean up this mess, we are going to spin it to our advantage."
Everyone began to put their things down and head towards the elevators. Steve lingered, watching Peter hang back and stand next to Tony, who turned towards him and softened his gaze.
“Captain Rogers suffers from an incurable illness; he is simply unable to do something if he doesn’t believe in it.” Tony tried to lighten the situation a bit.
"He doesn't know anyone in there, right?" Steve couldn't help but warm a little bit at Scott's concern.
Steve was hit with a small sense of déjà vu as he watched the scene unfold. Last time he watched Tony exit a car like this he had been attending the Gala. That felt so long ago to Steve, back when he was sure he would never leave Wakanda. Happy opened the car door and Tony stepped out, looking breathtaking as usual. He was dressed in a charcoal grey suit, with a checkered shirt underneath, his tie a dusty rose. His eyes were expectedly covered by one of his many pairs of dark sunglasses, even though the day was completely overcast. Steve couldn’t help but smile a bit.
, I’m sorry ‘bout what I said yesterday. What you do on your own time, who you do, that’s private and I shouldn’t have commented.” Tony’s breathing increased slightly, but he didn’t walk away or hit him, so Clint took that as a sign to continue as Tony turned to face him, his arms crossed over his chest.
The call ended and Tony moved to exit the ring and go pick up his things. Rhodes walked up to block his way and said, “We aren’t done with this conversation, Tony. I’m pretty damn pissed at you right now. Don’t forget that we are having team training today too. Shuri has been working on the individualized simulations and she says she’s ready.”
“I am sorry boss; I have no way of knowing. The majority of the fighting took place in Wakanda. I have not heard anything much since. I know that survivors are rebuilding, but I do not know who is among them.”
"Don't even try to start with that bullshit, Stark. I think you know exactly why I am here. I've been trying to get through to you for over a week!"
Tony finally pulled back and held Peter by the shoulders, the paper still in one hand, grinning broadly at Peter’s bright face.
Again, the floor was left in silence until Laura stood up from her spot near Clint and said, “T’Challa, can I get you a drink?” The King’s amused eyes landed on her as he bowed his head. “Please, Laura, thank you very much.” And he followed her into the kitchen, asking how she had been as Cooper, Cassie, and Lila went running after them to tell him all about what they had been up to since he last visited. The King was listening to them in rapture as Laura poured him a drink.
“Shit.” Tony cursed. “Um, alright, get under the table I guess?” Steve was about to argue when Shuri told them to hold on and ran to her bag. Pulling out a wrist bracelet, she ran over and extended it to Steve. “Put it on ‘Merica. It will make you invisible.” She said, her face glowing with pride. “No way.” Tony deadpanned. Steve looked at him for a moment as Shuri adjusted the band on his wrist and pressed a button.
He felt paralyzed. He was standing nearly shoulder to shoulder with the King, though they faced opposite directions. His hand stayed on the heavy wood of the bathroom door, almost ready to push it open, but he unable to do so. His mind was running a mile per minute.
“I believe I have a connection with someone who could get me some much better ones.” She joked. Tony’s face lit up. “That you do, Maximoff.”
Tony’s eyes flashed. He was exhausted, but never let it be said that Tony wasn’t ready for a fight whenever it presented itself.
His shoulders slump and he feels like a weight is pressing down on him. He barely manages to keep his eyes open now. Darkness bleeding into the edges of his already blurring vision. The sweet oblivion of a dreamless eternal sleep is calling and he nearly gives in, until he is startled by a firm slap to his cheek. “Do not sleep.” Nebula instructs with a steely voice. In her other arm are a variety of items he can’t focus on but he assumes are medical supplies, which she dumps on the table next to him. His vision is swimming again and he can’t concentrate on anything. He can just make out her lips moving again, but his ears are ringing dully and her words aren’t filtering through. It’s not her voice he wants to hear at this moment anyway, not her face he wishes he could see. Peter, he wants Peter. That bright sunny smile and enthusiastic young voice.
"I miss having two arms." Bucky said, breaking their silence. Steve couldn't help but let out a small chuckle at that, earning a smile from Bucky.
After splashing water on his face and trying to ground himself by clutching the sides of the sink so hard his knuckles turned while, he stayed hunched over the white porcelain trying to control his breathing.
James uncrossed his arms and came over to sit next to Steve on the bed. “I’ve been reading a lot, and more importantly, I’ve been seeing someone. Bruce thought maybe it would be a good idea to have someone who actually knows what they are doing come and talk to me. It’s been really helpful, Steve. I know Tony has gone a few times too.”
He felt lost at her words. He didn't know how to respond, since this was a new level of friendship with each other for them both.
Shuri had mentioned she and her mother wanted to watch the live coverage of the Stark Charity Gala happening tonight in New York City, hoping to catch glimpses of all of the famous attendees, her brother and King among them. Steve had insisted that she do it with them, as they had nothing better to do and wanted to be kept informed.
He spat that word out like it left a bitter taste in his mouth. "My life was lie, after lie, after lie, and standing next to me were both of the people who had caused them." Tony's chest was heaving now as he stepped closer to Steve. "So, did I lose my shit?
One morning, a few days later, Sam, Clint, Steve, and Scott were coming back from the gym, heading to the kitchen to clear out all the food from the fridge when they heard suspicious sounds coming from the kitchen living area.
Steve again felt a pull at his heart, he had missed Natasha dearly. He glanced across the isle at Clint who's face was both hurt and annoyed. "She didn't even say hello. Nothing." He said sadly.
Bruce of all people decided to join in by saying, “Captain America, all hot and bothered by Tony Stark’s blatant display of power.”
Steve didn’t know how long he sat in the room whispering promises and apologies and listening to Tony’s breathing. The door would open once in a while and one of the team would come in to see Tony and offer Steve food, drink, or just comfort, all three of which he refused. When the door opened again it was dark outside and he recognized the sound of Rhodes’ leg braces. He didn’t even bother to sit up or wipe his eyes, the Colonel could scold him and threaten him all he wanted, but at this moment he didn’t think he’d survive leaving Tony’s side for anything.
Tony shook a few hands as he walked through the Ballroom. His eyes searched the crowds of people gathered tonight, trying his best to find Natasha. She had told him she would be there, so he knew that the stealthy woman would be somewhere, it was just a matter of finding her.
He scoffed slightly and returned, "The military pays me millions for my thoughts, you only offer a penny? I'm insulted Romanov."
She shook her head, "Shouldn't be a problem Colonel. Just letting you know Stark and Spider-Man went to investigate the possibility that they've set up shop in an abandoned riverside Warehouse on the coast. They should be back around the same time you land. I'll give you a heads up when they check in, but you know them. Tony may decide to reward the kid with ice cream or something before coming home."
Scott considered this for a moment. Then, as if he made a decision, he suddenly stepped forward and moved until he was directly in front of Tony. Tony's hurt wrist that he was holding against his chest moved slightly to cover his arc reactor at the sudden proximity. Scott simply stuck his hand out and held it there, waiting.
They spent the next hour going over the BARF technology, how it worked, why it worked, what they hoped to achieve with it, and most importantly, why it would help James Buchanan Barnes.
“The bracelets on his wrists, take them off.” Ross instructed with his infuriating smirk in place. One of the guards did so and threw them on the floor at Natasha’s feet. Another guard did a security pat down and checked Tony for any more weapons.
“Sounds great, Tones.” Maggie said. “We were just going to clean up a bit.” Tony looked around the room at that and Steve tried to suppress a smile. Tony clearly had the same thought he had earlier.
. They both knew what she meant when she said that. Rogers had told them time and again that together was the only way they would succeed. He nodded and took a deep breath before looking down at her again.
James sighed and nodded. “Good.” Sam said as Tony came back to them, smiling brightly. “Alright, Peter is going to do his homework and then he will come over. Let’s get some more stuff for a celebration to welcome our friends tonight!”
He knew why they were angry and he knew that so much of it was because of lies and miscommunication. They were good people, good individuals, and he knew that if they had all of the information they would not be saying the disgusting vile things that they were.
Steve nodded solemnly as they both stood and started back up the stairs. Just as they reached the top, Sam's text tone on the secure phone T'Challa had given him went off. He pulled it out and read a text from T'Challa:
“I know exactly what they say and I know my rights. I am exercising one of those rights now; Amended Sokovian Accords Section 141 Sub-Clause E.”
"I am not saying you made the wrong choice. But you all did make a choice, and the consequences must be faced either way. Standing on one side insisting on righteous agreement will do you no good. I like you, Sam, and you are a good friend to the Captain. Continue to be this friend, he quite obviously needs it. It will not do him much good to continue to voice his agony to empty basement walls."
Steve was sorry but Captain America would probably still have made the same choice if he had to do it over again. Steve cared about him but Captain America only ever saw his flaws. Tony could separate James Barnes from the Winter Soldier, but he couldn’t do the same with Steve Rogers and Captain America. He knew why, it came down to choice. James didn’t have a choice who he hurt and James hadn’t ever meant to hurt Tony. Steve did have a choice and Steve chose to hurt him.
“Uh huh.” Was Tony’s eloquent response. Steve raised his gaze back to Tony’s. “I’m trying.” He whispered. “I don’t want to be team leader by myself, Tony. I don’t feel comfortable or confident enough yet to lead alone. I’d like to suggest to the Counsel that the Avengers be lead by two members, not one.”
Steve's heart would skip beats as Bucky talked about the amazing technological gift that Tony had given him. They hardly spoke about Tony himself, though Bucky would often leave an opening in the conversation to give Steve a chance to inquire if, as Bucky put it Steve "ever grew some balls and decided to ask". He never did, and he knew that Bucky and T'Challa thought he was being ridiculous.
The sparring continued and both Peter and Tony were so immersed in it that neither of them noticed that many of the other Compound’s occupants had filtered in to stand or sit and watch quietly.
Steve felt anger and heat he'd almost never felt before rise inside of him. This wasn't fair, this wasn't right, Tony would see through this man, wouldn't he? Tony was smarter than this.
Between the increasingly heated kisses and wandering hands, Steve managed to breathe out, “Thought I’d lost you.”  Tony nipped at his bottom lip lightly before moving down to place kisses along his jaw. “Again.” He sighed.
After they had all gathered together on the couches, T'Challa stood and nodded his thanks to them for coming.
The King considered his answer for a moment before answering carefully, "No, Agent Barton, I did not. I would much rather you had stayed in New York with the rest of the Avengers and been the team you were all meant to be. However, we cannot change the past. Now we move forward, and we strive to be better than we once were."
Sam leaned over slightly in what he hoped didn't draw any attention to them as he asked in a low voice, "Steve? Doin' alright, man?" Steve just gave a small aborted head shake as he continued to keep his eyes glued to the first real-time image of Tony he had since Siberia.
“What is wrong with you!?” Steve hissed, looking around and down to make sure they were alone in the stairwell.
Scott had been here to speak with Maggie and Cassie a few days before. When he had come back down he hadn’t spoken much and refused to give anyone any details. He had been annoyed with the guy at the time. Now though, he understood. How do you describe the feeling of someone handing you a second chance with the most precious thing you’ve ever been lucky enough to have in the first place? How do you reconcile that with the idea the person who gave it back to you is someone you left behind in pain, and mocked as you did it?
After landing, she slipped a supportive arm around him as they slowly made their way from the ship to the door of the building.
Over the next few days Steve only left Tony’s side to shower, leaving Nat or James to sit with him. The children visited everyday and brought cards and other gifts with them. Dianne brought Steve lunch everyday with extra cups of the orange jello he liked. Peter and Shuri would come and talk about different ideas they had for Tony to experiment with them on when he woke up. Most of it Steve couldn’t follow, but he appreciated their enthusiasm none the less. Usually there were a few of their friends in the room with Steve at any given time, but there were moments where he had time to himself with Tony. He spent a lot of that time just talking to the unconscious man, telling him about Wakanda, life growing up, and other distractions. Sam brought him his sketchbook on the third day and he distracted himself with that, speaking out loud as he drew.
"Alright, enough, that's enough. We don't need a play by play." Tony rushed to end this. They weren't supposed to know these things. Rogers could keep his
Turns out that maybe it wasn’t, since when the ball connected with the wall and made a dull thump, Stark nearly jumped out of his skin, ducking and diving behind the counter and whipping around in the direction the noise came from, arm raised with the gauntlet repulser aimed at the spot.
That would have broken him, Steve knows it. That boy. Tony had grown close to the boy; he was sure of it. Watching the news, it was clear that Spider Man had been given upgrades and tech that could only have come from Iron Man. If the boy was involved professionally, Steve was sure he was involved personally. Tony didn’t know how to separate those lines. Even from their limited interaction, he knew the boy idolized Tony.
Her hands faltered over the controls. “What did you just call me?” She asked incredulously, putting a warning into her voice that Tony clearly didn’t care about or didn’t bother to listen to, since he repeated, “Stardust, honey.”
Rhodes gave him a small nod as he steered Pepper in the direction of the couch and suggested a drink, leaving Steve and Sam alone. “She is absolutely terrifying. No wonder Stark put her in charge.” Sam said as they watched them walk away. Steve could only nod in agreement, the woman was a force.
Before Tony can ask what’s spurred this on, Steve’s fingertips are gently but firmly, titling Tony’s head up so their lips are just centimeters from brushing together, Steve’s blue eyes stuck on his, the palpable hunger rising in them.
And so, that’s how it all began, at first with Steve coming by every chance he got to see the octopus Tony lovingly named Octavia, until Tony got so fed up with Steve’s puppy dog eyes that he threw her feeding schedule at him and told him to come by a couple times every day to tend to her.
Tony turns his head to the sound, Rhodey sitting to his right, in a hospital acquired wheelchair. He swallows down the guilt that crawls up his throat looking at the man next to him, the memory of watching his best friend fall helplessly to the ground, in a suit that he made. Steeling himself, Tony pushes down the ache in his chest and flashes his signature smirk.
He had gotten Ross to cut her some slack, and not arrest her for letting Steve make off with their Quinjet. It hadn’t been easy, and he’s sure he’ll be paying for it some way later, but with the Avengers being so low on team members, she’s an asset. And a friend.
“I can hardly wait,” Steve replies, leaving one last chaste kiss on Tony’s lips, before stepping away and watching Tony stumble inside his building, the suaveness seems to have been kissed out of him, and Steve doesn’t try to stop this smile, before turning away and heading back home.
He feels stunted somehow, all that Steve had said to him was one goddamn word? Sure, Tony was in fucking shock, who wouldn’t be. But he feels like he deserved way more than that.
Okay, this is getting real, either someone else is fighting these guys for fun, or Steve and whoever are merely floors apart from them.
Patience isn’t one of Tony’s strong suits. Being born into a family worth billions, he’s never had to wait for anything material he’s wanted. His father Howard was inpatient in all aspects of his life, excluding his never-ending search for the one and only Captain America.
Tony knew Ross was off his rocker but to attempt this, it doesn’t make any sense. Does the guy have a death wish? Then, he remembers Ross’ shoot on sight orders from back in Berlin, and he’s not so surprised. The man is not one to back down from a fight, or handle losing one so easily.
“Yeah, it’s all mine,” Steve says, also pausing to appreciate the bike before handing Tony a helmet and climbing on.
Tony fights against the onslaught of memories surfacing of the Siberia fight, he can’t afford another panic attack right now. If he were to ever get a bout of retrograde amnesia, now would be the perfect time, c’mon universe.
Avoiding, capital A, is something Tony has had several years of practice in. Spending his childhood avoiding his father’s harsh words and his mother’s pitiful stares, to learning to avert his gaze every time he catches the sight of running water after Afghanistan. Hell, even dodging Pepper’s pleads to care more about his wellbeing then this world they live in, that eventually being the source of their break up among other things.
Steve leans forward to gently kiss Tony’s mouth, and Tony immediately abandons their gummy mountain, and cups Steve’s cheek to pull him in closer.
Fuck all logic and reasoning, he’s a man with a plan as he fills a glass with the amber liquid. Only breathing clearly after the first gulp.
Clint’s frown deepens and he talks quietly into his comm, likely informing the rest of his team he’d caught them. “Cap? You there?” Clint’s voice is louder now, concerned.
I think I’ve got enough now, thank you Tony,” Steve says, holding back his chuckling as a few people around them glance at Tony skeptically.
But all the years Tony’s had in military business have taught him to grin and bear it, especially when all you want to do is punch a pack of smug old white men in the face.
Tony can feel his adrenaline spiking, but they must be careful about this, the last thing he needs is to be seen breaking the accords and letting Ross know they’ve caught him out.
And Tony sounds so tired, like he hasn’t slept in days (he hasn’t) and Steve hates it. Not used to Tony being so transparent and outright with his fear.
They’d gathered after Thanos had left them licking their wounds, cut in half in the most visceral way. Steve’s stomach soured at the number of the fallen. Reminding him so much of his past life, losing comrades, soldiers, friends, they didn’t deserve the deaths that came to them.
“It was just a flesh wound, takes a lot more to get me down.” She flashes him her signature smirk, and then grows serious.
They see her first, she looks frustrated, body held tight as she’s pleading with someone to hurry up.
Tony walks out of the shop then, a small breeze offering him some respite against the heat, the burnt orange sun settling low in the sky. Maybe Steve was right, he thinks, perhaps good things do come from having a little bit of patience. At least, that’s what the mess he's hiding under his clothes says to him.
“Tones, you know I’m on your side, and yeah this sucks, this is a bad beat. But I haven’t changed my mind, at least not yet.”
Tony rips the bottle out of his hand and takes several gulps before feeling mostly like he can breathe again.
They went all out with the decorations, bright red and white balloons strewn across the floor and streamers draped on every accessible place they could manage. Steve has severely vivid flashbacks to every high school dance he attended and he pauses to shake off how weird it makes him feel for a moment, before reminding himself that braces and hair styled with way too much gel isn’t his reality anymore, thankfully.
The pad of Steve’s thumb is cool from his bottle, and Tony locks eyes with him just as Steve brings said thumb to his own mouth, tucking it in and sucking away the drop. Tony’s throat dries right back up despite having just wet it, and he takes a moment to swallow it away. Steve’s still eyeing him and the temperature in their little bubble goes up 10 degrees.
Steve’s panting grows heavier, “Let me see you, “he says, voice hitching when Tony’s fingers brush lightly against his balls.
Tony immediately perks up, climbing off the bed and over to Steve, both of them facing Bucky’s side of the room.
Tony just sighs and cuddles in closer to them both before Steve then gets up to actually order them some food, and Bucky makes Tony lay down with him, the exhaustion and blood loss finally catching up to him.
Tony has four hours left before he’s off duty, and the combination of humidity and ache reverberating between his shoulder blades, is setting him up for one hell of a migraine.
Tony sighs and looks down at his hands, they’re calloused and scarred from years of engineering and various sleep deprived mishaps in his workshop. Made to look strong when they’re anything but, much like his own psyche. The same hands that we’re encased in the suits gloves that were last used to fight St- Tony squeezes his eyes shut tight, not even wanting to open that box yet.
Steve shakes his head at Tony, “Six and half hours is just as good as eight to me right now, unless you’d really like to stay here by yourself and miss out on perfect, hot and salty french fries.”
“We drove here, parked the van down the street,” Steve answers instead, his voice strong but Tony catches the hint of weariness in it.
Tony starts the water and Steve gets himself and Bucky undressed, both of them needing to scrub away the grime they collected.
He feels Tony lay his head against his shoulder, arms tightening further around him, “I’m not sure, it feels like a dream.”
The warm sensation spreading its way down Steve’s spine and out to the tip of every one of his fingers can only be described as complete content. He can feel his own cheeks tinting pink from the blush Tony never fails to pull out of him.
Steve reaches out to grab a couple and slips them onto his fingers, like candy rings. He offers them out to Tony, and Tony doesn’t hesitate to slip Steve’s fingers into his mouth to bite them off.
Tony sends off Rhodey with a hug and promise to check-in within a few days. Rhodey taking his braces with him, to get in some more practice with his physical therapist.
Tony brings the blunt back up to his lips, and slowly takes a good sized hit, lest any smoke escapes before he can get to Steve. He leans in close, and Steve opens his mouth for him to bring their lips together, and Tony blows, feeling the smoke he was holding in pass into Steve’s mouth.
He was surprised when he actually found Tony in bed, sleeping, instead of in the workshop, working on another project. As quietly as possible, he laid next to him and tried not to wake him up by his shuffling. He didn't succeed.
His first thought, after he’s had a much-needed shower and two cups of coffee is; burn it. Wondering if it will be as sinful as burning an American Flag, he is always up for a lil controversy. Maybe he’ll find an old piece of stationery and Zodiac Killer one back to his dear old Captain. Knowing the reference will go right over his head, Clint would probably get a kick out of it though. He gets a bitter taste in his mouth at that, and instead throws the letter and the sad excuse of a cell phone onto the couch, promptly walking away to have another cup of coffee.
for right now. Being enough is not something he’s familiar with, not something he’d coin himself as.
Steve hauls Bucky a couple more feet until he’s dropping him into one of the chairs next to the mini fridge. Tony manages to unglue his feet from his stance and moves towards the bathroom to grab them towels to get dry.
He’s so lost in his head for awhile, Tony doesn’t hear the bath drain and Steve and Bucky walking back into the room.
“This is yours?” Tony asks, eyes wide as he takes in Steve’s shiny black motorcycle that he’s incredibly proud of.
“We have to put her in the hot tub,” he says to Steve, and Steve sends him an apologetic look in return.
Under the right circumstances, Vormir would be beautiful, dark violet skies and the same kind of hushed silence that only happens during the first snow fall of the year. But right now, Steve hates it, feels the chill seeping through the tears in his suit, causing him to shiver slightly.
“Wow Natasha, who knew you’d be my knight in shining armor, I’m weirdly equal parts scared and turned on.”
Tony makes a mock offended face at Steve, “How dare you presume I need anyone to open my jars,” he jokes, before saying “Now shut-up or I won’t let you feed her.”
Bucky only makes a small pained noise when Tony pulls past the two stab wounds bleeding on his thigh. Tony has to close his eyes as the sight of the blood makes his stomach twist, but he soldiers on and get Bucky’s jeans completely off.
There’s a brighter aura around Tony, that usually comes with spending time with his oldest and closest friend. Is there anything better in the world than knowing someone will always stand beside you, even when the going gets tough? Tony’s lucky he hasn’t pushed Rhodey away, given his many mess-ups throughout the years.
The nerves are starting to kick in now, and Tony wishes he had a suit with him. There’s one waiting back on the jet for him, but with what they’re doing here, it would receive unwanted attention.
Tony motions for Steve to come back up, pulls him close to plant a fierce kiss against Steve’s swollen lips, tasting himself on Steve’s tongue, as he whispers, “I thought you were going to make a mess of me, Rogers.”
Tony’s sitting at the back of the row of chairs, willing himself to pass out so he can avoid his life and pretend this isn't happening.
He's been working away at reviewing Octavia’s training footage recorded from earlier in the day, and she’s well past exceeded the level Tony wanted for her to be at this week and will be fully ready for a new set of tasks next month, he adores her really.
Tony sighs and finally looks Steve in the eyes. Steve is struck by how much he missed Tony, being back in his presence despite the lousy circumstances, has reminded him of how captivating Tony is. How he can display so much in just one look.
Tony curses, they’re outnumbered, but then, Natasha is making her way over to a window, handgun out, and casually jumping through it.
The song ends much too soon, and Steve bows his head, stepping away, accepting defeat while offering a nod and smile toward his competitor. “Alright, you win.” Steve says, voice picking up in volume to be heard over the start of the next song.
Tony actually seems to shy away at that, biting his lip and looking away, “Maybe, it’s a work in progress.”
Tony had been so naive all those days ago, thinking it would be fun when Fury first briefed them about it at SHIELD HQ. And sure, while working in a sex shop can certainly be interesting, he misses the comfort of his high-rise in Manhattan, and the paradise of a building that has fully functioning air conditioning 7 days a week.
The beat up T.V. is on low volume and Tony takes a minute to watch the weather woman in a god awful yellow pantsuit inform 11a.m. viewers of the 70% chance of rain in their future. Judging by the tell-tale trickle of water moving through the gutters above, Tony decides she can keep her job, questionable fashion choices aside.
Dropping the phone that feels like it’s burning a metaphorical hole through his hand. Why must he always be so damn impulsive?
For now, Tony lets himself have one more night to sink into this empty feeling in his chest, and hope for better days.
The next half hour is spent batting away Tony’s surprisingly quick hands from eating too much raw dough, and once again dealing with a mishap of some billowing flour covering Steve’s apron and Tony’s once black t-shirt, before their cookies are securely baking in the oven.
Nebula and Rocket are quick to follow him, and Steve has to make the decision of leaving Red Skull behind without getting rid of him for good, or helping Tony.
Steve leans forward to plant a kiss on Tony’s forehead, “I would never presume to know what to expect from you Tony,” he replies.
“I don’t know how serious you were last night, but I really like you Steve, and I was having the best time right before we got interrupted,” Tony says, making sure Steve knows how open he’s trying to be, “I wanted to know if we could get a redo, another try at last night, one that doesn’t end in disaster?”
Tony casts a smile at Natasha, “Vision did it, Ross should be making an emergency u-turn right about now.”
It’s all been going well, they’ve had no problems kicking ass and taking names so far. Steve and Bucky had left late last night and promised Tony profusely they’d be back before he’d be up. The jokes on them, because Tony hasn’t even been to sleep, after so long sleeping with two other people it’s more than a little lonely by himself.
Is Steve really going to try and do this shit now? He’s going to need to put in an order for more of his favorite whiskey.
Rocket has one of their quinjets equipped for space travel and ready to go in less time than Steve thinks is probably safe, but they don’t have any time to waste.
There's nothing left of the man next to him, barely an ounce of human inside him, and Steve takes a moment to look over at Tony who nods at him to continue.
Sam just stares at him, long enough to have Tony shifting in his seat, before asking another question, “What did Vis do to get Ross the hell outta dodge?”
“Why an octopus?” Steve asks, still so enamored by the tiny sea creature swimming around the bottom of the tank.
“A little, but with the power out, I doubt the cafe cart is open…”Steve starts to say, and then shrugs, picking up some of the candy they found under Bucky’s bed. “I’m good with this for now.”
He warned Peter to stop messing around with the electro-fetish villains, but no one can tell that kid a thing.
Steve pulls back up once Tony let’s go of the hold on his shoulders, and he hums thoughtfully, feigning like he’s considering the prospect.
“Okay,” Steve replies distractedly, seeming to get lost in his thoughts for a moment, before adding, “Good.”
Sometime later, Bucky walks into his shared dorm with Steve, and he’s met with the sight of both Steve and Tony snoring against the same pillow, his candy and the roach of one of his blunts sitting next to them.
Tony straddles the motorcycle quickly after that, buckling the helmet into place, and wrapping his arms around Steve’s waist. Steve exaggerates the rev of the engine for Tony’s sake and takes them off in the direction of his favorite 24-hour diner.
“I don’t have to understand anything Rogers, you couldn’t understand when I was extending you that olive branch in Berlin, why am I held to a higher standard?”
And with good reason, as Tony’s already half way to dehydration, while the sun slowly cooks the eastern seaboard to a crisp.
The cookies are cooling down now, but Tony is seconds away from asking Steve for a third time if they can break into one yet, so Steve gazes fondly at their batch of various sized cookies, before he picks up a silly looking one that Tony definitely tried to shape into something but ended up failing spectacularly.
“Help me back into my chair, and then we’re gonna have a drink and a meeting of the Tony Stark Needs to Stop Self-Sabotaging Club.”
So, it’s ironically hysterical that he’s ended up here because he was trying to avoid having the Avengers be the cause of any more detrimental chaos. The accords we’re going to be the first step towards that goal, at least that’s what he had thought. Instead all it got him was a broken suit, a broken team, and an even more broken heart.
He offers it out to Tony who quickly splits it in half, a couple gooey chocolate strings pulling away from the piece still in Steve’s hand. Tony has no hesitation in shoving it into his mouth, chewing blissfully.
For Tony to start moving on he needs a distraction. Preferably one not inside of a bottle. Let’s ignore the fact that he’s nursing one hell of a hangover right now though. Being on the wrong side of forty with a drinking problem is the last thing he needs.
Natasha had insisted on helping him move back into the compound, despite his wishes. This was no doubt her handiwork. He’ll have to call up Jane Bond herself, and give her a piece of his mind for sneaking this past him.
Steve who’s still barely holding onto the flame burning inside his chest steps towards the cliff’s edge next to Red Skull.
The one thing he could never avoid was Steve. From the day they met arguing on the Triskelion, two fuses ready to blow. Steve was everything his father made him out to be, and completely not. Howard never mentioned how self-righteous Captain America was, only stories about how extraordinarily strong he was and the bravery he had to take on Hydra by himself, never mentioning his weaknesses. Or just his one weakness, Bucky fucking Barnes.
Texting Steve has brought up a lot of buried feelings he’s not ready to sift through. He’s not sure if he’ll ever be.
Steve looks so down about it, Tony’s heart hurts for him, Steve always takes an injury happening on his watch as a slight to his ability as a leader.
Tony can see on Clint’s face when he gets no response back. Swallowing down his own anxiety, Tony steps forward, “Ross set this up, he wasn’t too happy with your escape from underwater Azkaban.”
Steve just melts, his heartbeat thudding in his ears from the soft, comforting feeling of Tony hugging him. It's exactly what he needed after the week he's had, and Steve burrows as deep as he can into Tony's chest.
‘Fine,’ she groans, but does as she’s told, remembering all the tips and instructions Natasha has given her all the months they’ve been doing this. ‘Hey!’ her eyes fly open and she smiles, ‘I’m doing it!’
Steve had insisted they all dress ‘smart’, which is the reason Tony is in the situation he is in. He needs to have some strong words with his boyfriend.
‘No they can’t,’ Peter deadpans. ‘They are monstrosities that should never have existed in the first place. Why would you think ‘oh yay let’s talk about horror’ at Christmas anyway?’
‘Peter help Bruce get Loki to the medical wing,’ Tony cuts across Steve, moving forwards. ‘Then I want you to find Dr Higgs, and
Peter is so engrossed in his newest ideas he wouldn’t have noticed Wade sneaking up behind him until the merc covered his eyes if it weren’t for his spidey-senses.
‘Steve told me to give you at least an hour to get your head straight, I snuck out while he was making coffee so I’m going to be in trouble when we get back,’ is Tony’s greeting as he closes the door behind him and sits on the bed.
Loki laughs. ‘Oh no dear child. I am still working on forgiving him completely even now, something like that cannot just be forgiven in a moment’s decision, it takes time and work. But I was able to forgive him enough that, before he died, I could look on him as my father again.’ He smiles at the confused look on the girl’s face. ‘I am sure you will never be in the situation where you can fully understand my meaning, but perhaps one day you will come closer to. Now I suggest we change this topic of conversation to one more appropriate for Christmas Day. You were asking about magic: would you like to see some ice shapes?’
Wanda’s still laughing as they reach the common area. Loki take the opportunity to twirl her around under the mistletoe, dipping her back and then, as he pulls her up placing a soft kiss to her lips. Once she’s upright again, a slightly shocked look on her face, he tells her. ‘You are too fair to be so sorrowful, let your heart heal, little witch, you deserve to laugh more.’
Wanda is tired of listening to the woman’s chattering and sends a ball of energy at her. Agatha simply absorbs it.
‘Merry Christmas, Loki,’ she replies with a small smile. ‘And better than other days at least. How about you?’ She frowns as she catches sight of Scott’s red face as he walks past. ‘You caught Scott didn’t you? How many others have you already ticked off your list this morning?’
do. Stop second guessing yourself and for once in your life let something good happen to you, alright?’
Natasha straightens up after taking out another HYDRA guard and catches her breath. They’ve done well at catching them unawares, and the guards are still scrambling into some semblance of order; the chaos is mostly helped by Wanda, who is not even attempting to hold back on her powers, her face is furious, made slightly terrifying by the red light glowing from her eyes.
Tony pulls the jet to a stop, tapping his reactor and letting his suit cover him. ‘I second the question.’
I've been wondering about whether to do a Christmas Special of this fic and post it at Christmas, but I'm never sure how I feel about them. Would you guys want a short multi-part side story to this of an Avengers Christmas? Let me know and I'll start working on it.
‘We tried this before with the weapons,’ the other responds, ‘and look where it got us: on the Avengers’ radar and Spider-Man taking out Vulture.’
‘Tony I,’ Steve looks sheepish. ‘I don’t think it’s a good idea for me to be in the dancing auction.’
Tony sees the answer on Strange’s face before he answers and feels his heart sink in sympathy. ‘You could have done better,’ he answers for the doctor, ‘couldn’t you?’
‘I have no quarrel with you, Man of Iron,’ his half-brother says as he steps into view, ‘but I will not hesitate to kill you to get what I want.’
‘Will also be useful with you being so far away. If it starts going sideways here, at least I can let you know quicker than anyone else.’
Natasha just rolls her eyes and throws the remote to Wanda who decides to put on some comedy show to drown out the two super soldiers. Sam comes and joins them on the sofa, apparently not wanting to try and break the two friends up. Not that Tony can blame him. Unconsciously he rubs at his chest where the arc reactor used to be, the shadow of a shield sitting heavy.
To his surprise she smiles. ‘The whole point of having a second in command,’ she laughs, ‘is that when you are called away to perform your duties as king you have someone who will do what is needed here.’
‘Where’s everyone else? Usually there’s at least a couple of people in here watching TV or reading, or something.’
‘Well when the genius here had his first arc reactor he decided not to tell anyone it was slowly killing him. Instead he decided working himself into an even earlier death in an attempt to ignore it was a much better solution,’ the Colonel replies.
Clint just grins at him. ‘No, but I did get him to let me move one of the mistletoe sprigs to out here.’
‘You know,’ Tony says, pulling Steve up to join him so he can dance with his boyfriend, ‘I think we need to make Bucky and Loki R-rated. If it wasn’t for the fact Pete’s with Wade, I’d be worried about them scarring him.’
‘That’s what I thought when we did the Accords,’ Tony sighs, ‘and that took over a year to sort out.’
that stone. What if they get hold of it? We need it somewhere they won’t be able to get it should things go wrong until we’ve taken care of them once and for all.’
‘Was he this excitable on Asgard or is he being especially so this year because we’re doing it on Earth?’ the inventor asks.
that’s what he’d said. The humanoid hadn’t said a thing, just nodded and tucked the folder into his bag and left. He’d returned four days ago. Four days for Wanda to have given the folder to Steve and for the super-soldier to have read it.
Thank you so much for keeping up with this story and leaving reviews and kudos. I hope you're still enjoying it. Let me know if there is anything in particular you'd like to see at some stage. I got a whole background story for this out of one request so please do send in some suggestions.
‘That’s not Tony’s tech,’ she says, voice barely audible as she takes in the reactor in her friend’s chest. ‘That reactor wasn’t made by Tony.’
‘He has forgiven you, Steve,’ Rhodes reassures him. ‘Otherwise he never would have tried to get you home in the first place. But he’s still hurting, and he’s not sure if you’re going to stick around this time. He’s scared of getting hurt again, Steve, so he’s scared of getting close to you again. He won’t admit any of this, of course. But once he realises you’ll stick around, he’ll let you back in. You’ve just got to be patient.’
‘Why? What did you do? Snap another phone in half? Because to be fair sometimes I wish I could do the same. I’ll see if I can work out a way to reinforce one better for you,’ he says, heading towards the counter and keeping his back to him.
‘Come on, Tony,’ Steve rolls his eyes, placing a hand on the small of Tony’s back to lead him out of the office, ‘or I may change my mind about tonight.’
‘Oh shut it all of you!’ Tony shouts, immediately regretting it as he struggles for breath; Peter is supporting him within a heartbeat and helps the inventor to a seat. ‘Wade you stay where you are.’
‘Am I ok? I haven’t had this much fun in months!’ the archer responds and runs back into the fight. As he takes down another two guards Natasha catches sight of Bucky. Seeing the Winter Soldier in action is something both beautiful and terrifying; he moves with all the grace that she remembers being instilled in her during her time in the Red Room, but the brutal way he cuts down the enemy, stepping over bodies as if they were nothing, sends a shiver down even her spine. She remembers having to fight him before, and is thinking HYDRA might be regretting training this particular soldier.
Peter nods. ‘I hope so. I think they’d get on really well.’ He gives the man a smile and sits up. ‘Thanks, Sam.’
Sam cuts the tape holding the box closed and they open the top to reveal the contents. ‘Is this? Have we been sent
‘Hey you made sure to get over here and warn us, it’s the least we can do. Especially since you’ve got hurt because of me.’ Tony turns to look at Peter who’s been strangely quiet throughout the whole exchange. ‘Pete can you take Scott down to the room next to yours? I’ll get FRIDAY to sort out the rest in the meantime.’
‘Oh, Stevie,’ Bucky laughs and shakes his head. ‘You and me are going to have the birds and the bees talk.’
They try and resolve their argument through wrestling. No surprises when it ends in a draw. They decide to take a break and go to sit on the benches where they’ve left their water bottles, Steve wipes at his face and neck with his towel and leans back against the wall behind them, his thoughts wandering in the quiet room.
‘We don’t know,’ she replies, and Peter can tell just how worried she is. ‘All FRIDAY could tell me was that they reached the dig site, Tony activated his suit and then she lost contact with them. She can’t get the comms connected so we have no way of contacting them.’
‘Ah, I’m afraid that might be difficult, Mister Stark,’ Rumlow sighs in apparent regret. ‘You see I’ve had the new deployment details for both Rogers and Barnes through today. They’ll be redeployed and leaving at the end of the week.’
‘They decided to settle it by who got the most kills during their time with the Commandos. I actually looked up their confirmed kills to find out who won the bet.’
‘You sound surprised to learn all of this, Captain,’ an emotionless voice says behind him. Steve spins to see Vision phasing through the wall. ‘Why is that?’
‘I think before we take any more questions,’ the Headmaster says, ‘can I request that we keep them as
Tony stiffens, and eyes Steve cautiously. ‘What do you mean? You want me to take the suit from him?’
‘No change there,’ he can hear the smile in Wanda’s voice but doesn’t respond. He’ll get her back later.
‘Maybe we should give some blank ones to Wade when he gets back,’ Tony says, ‘then he can invite some of his friends if he wants to, seeing as he hasn’t given us their names.’
‘We might be lodging with the dust mites?’ Natasha suggests with a small chuckle. ‘I think it’s a genius idea, Tony.’
He tries his best to hold back the satisfied smirk at Flash’s face from the last comment, and says goodbye to the rest of the team as he follows the spy out of the door. They stop off long enough to grab his bags before she leads him to a sleek silver car.
‘Pete what is it?’ Ned all but shouts at him, running over from where he’s been talking to Sam and Rhodes. Peter reaches into the box and pulls out an old Iron Man gauntlet. ‘No way!’
‘Scott says he’s convinced Hope to come along for Yule as well, and he’s allowed to bring Cassie,’ Steve enters behind Natasha. ‘Tony you do know you’re supposed to knead the dough and not wear it right?’
Thank you so much to everyone who has left comments and kudos on this story. I'll be honest I was slightly worried people wouldn't want to keep reading into another series, so I'm glad you're still enjoying it. Do let me know if anyone has any requests!
‘It’s the celebration of the end of the decline into winter and the start of the beginning of the year heading back towards summer and the plenty of the harvest,’ Valkyrie is the one to explain, ‘and it is also the time to remember and honour the dead that we have lost during the last year. Everyone stops working for the duration of the celebration and families are reunited and spend the time together preparing for the feast at the end.’
‘Hey,’ Sam greets him and Bucky as soon as they walk in through the front door, ‘you guys better come into the living room and hear this.’
He hears what he hopes is a breath of laughter on the other end. But that could be wishful thinking. Still the knot in his chest eases slightly. ‘I’m just surprised you got him to agree with you.’
‘I want to know,’ the voice is Ned’s and Steve can’t help but smile, ‘if the Winter Soldier was here right now what would you most want to say to him?’
‘I’m fine-’ his answer is cut off by the Cloak that takes the opportunity to hit him on the head. The man glares at the fabric and sighs. ‘I just over-exerted myself a little. I shall be fine once I rest.’
‘Taking to the skies are we, hon? It’s not going to help, you’re just postponing the inevitable,’ she mock-sighs.
‘Are there going to be more of you pests coming out of these tunnels?’ Lautenus grumbles. ‘Jotuns! Prepare for battle!’
‘Something along those lines,’ Steve smirks. ‘It’s weird isn’t it?’ How different the Commandos are to the Avengers? The Commandos were some of our best friends, but-’
‘You’re the stupid one, Wade,’ he reminds him. ‘I’m getting your arse out of trouble more often than not.’ Then he curses as there’s a crash in the classroom next door. ‘Pool
Everyone finds out about Tony and Steve much quicker than they imagined, though very few people are really surprised. The team finally gets to see Peter's history presentation, though no one's told Bucky what the topic is.
‘I did murder their king,’ Loki points out with a dark smile, ‘and attempted to destroy their world. I would not blame them for wanting to see an end to me.’
The blond smiles sympathetically. ‘We’ve got team building games after dinner, why don’t you just stick with your friends for that one seeing as you’ll be going back to your rooms after?’
‘Lucky for me it did. Although it gave me my healing abilities, and I can recover from anything, it gave me all these scars. The healing abilities counter the cancer as fast as the cells grow, and this,’ he gestures at his skin, ‘is the price I pay. So no more front page photo shoots, now its Hallowe’en posters.’
‘Alright champ let’s leave it there for today,’ he says when he realises the time, ‘otherwise I’ll have Tony grumbling I’ve been keeping you to myself for too long.’
Tony pulls him in for a hug, which he easily returns, hiding the tears that are leaking from his eyes in the material of the man’s shirt. ‘Not sure just yet if I’m honest.’
Fury sighs. ‘I can’t work out what’s going on with this new guy,’ he admits, ‘he says he’s from an alternate dimension but…something isn’t sitting right and I can’t quite place it. And the only one I feel comfortable calling in to help, the only one I actually think might be able to work all this out, is currently being a hormonal teenager.’
As they rode the elevator, Tony leaned over and with a conspiratorial smirk he asked, “Hey, do you want to play a prank on Vision later?” At her intrigued look he smiled knowingly at her and leaned down to whisper his idea in her ear, pulling back to wiggle his eyebrows. She turned wide eyes on him before she burst out in a fit of laughter. He smiled proudly at her, glad he was able to break some of the tension. “We will need some help.” She whispered back. He winked and replied, “Got it covered. Peter and Shuri are bringing the materials.” They tried to suppress their giggles as they stepped out on the communal floor.
Tony scoffed as he tried to stand up from the counter, “Come on, we’re going to the lab to get this shit off so I can get away from you.”
Steve made a swift decision. Sinking to his knees, he kept his gaze locked on Tony’s the whole time. Tony’s eyes widened, his breath catching in his throat at the sight of Steve on his knees in front of him. “Tony, you know me. You know I don’t beg often. But I am on my knees here, asking you,” his voice dropped low, “begging you.” Tony’s eyes were wild, he looked trapped as he said, “Please don’t do this.”
As they pulled out of the Compound and started down the road Sam nearly had his face pressed up against the window. He hadn’t been out of the Compound once since they arrived and before that he had only seen the city as they flew in on the QuinJet. Tony felt slightly bad for him, so he rolled the windows down and laughed as Sam stuck his head out and whooped as Tony hit the gas pedal.
His bottom lip was split open, some dried blood still clinging to it as it stretched. His was holding his wrapped sprained wrist to his chest somewhat protectively over the ribs that they had heard were bruised badly. His breath was shallow, but Steve honestly didn't know if that was from physical pain or from the sight of seeing them all standing in the living area of their floor. Tony's warm brown eyes looked dim as they landed on each of the others, resolutely avoiding landing on Steve.
They ran a few tests and simulations together and soon enough they both sat down at one of the desks. "Next on the agenda, the Accords. I think your new roomies might have some pointers they could give you on changes we need to make, don't you?"
When the doors to the gym opened, the light had faded from the sky and the room was dark. His head hung low and he didn't even bother to look up so see who had disturbed his quiet solitude.
“So he’s buying her some because she’s acting too childish to accept a gift from him?” Sam asked, trying not to sound too annoyed. James only shrugged as he continued to push the cart behind Tony, who said, “She won’t know. Vision will say he picked them up.”
, he thought to himself. He turned and walked towards the elevator and as the doors closed he heard the barely audible response from Tony's lips.
