No. No, it hadn’t. Two steps forward, three steps behind…the two of them, making aching progress on a road of their own making. They’d sprinted and stumbled, sometimes stood still and refused to move on ahead, sometimes thought of turning away altogether.
“I…” And there was a bit of hesitation here, Tony’s fingers fiddling with the hem of his jacket pocket, but he forged on. “If the UN council is……dragging its feet. If there’s any reason the…authorised Avengers can’t do their jobs. Then I’ll call. Drop the info so you guys can sort things.”
There was another tempting little cheesy strip hanging out the bottom fajita, Tony’s fingers were positively itching. To cheese or not to cheese? Gah, who cared, you only lived an average of four times, being a caped crusader. And so through a mouthful of snatched dairy and more than a little beef: “The main thing, and don’t you think I haven’t noticed you avoiding it with your ten-dollar words – you were supposed to be here an hour ago.”
“Not that I don’t mentally note it down every time you say stuff like that–” Peter straightened up noticeably, smile broadening till it went from charming to no-one-panic-but-we’ve-got-a-DEFCON-5, “but I’m going to have to ask you to save it for the toast. Which you’re making right now.”
Back, back, back. Okay. There was another shape on top of the screen, like a little white bolt of lightning. Lightning was…flashy, right? Right. That made sense. A little. Steve tapped at it in turn, his gigantic thumb missing its mark and hitting exit instead. The camera application closed. For fuck’s sake.
With unfeeling fingers, Steve prised the phone free and looked at the screen. Ten numbers, arranged in the same order he knew they would be in. And this time, there was absolutely no doubt about who would be on the other line.
“See, you say that,” Tony began, light and unconcerned, the last couple of minutes not unforgotten but…laid to rest for now, perhaps. “but I have this sneaking suspicion that Carol’s off gallivanting on Xandar at this very moment, yes?”
Steve watches, the warmth of the sun beating down his arms and back. He has a feeling Minsk is pretty nice this time of year too.
He backed up a stumbling step, heel skidding on the concrete floor. Somewhere at the back of his head, it registered that there were no familiar whirrs in the distance, no armour flying through the air in response to his gesture, assembling around his clenched fists or unstable legs.
“I’m not, actually.” An exhale that sounded more resigned than amused, mouth softening imperceptibly. “I’ve never disbelieved you, Tony. Never thought you didn’t have a point, when you’d go on about the dangers that waited out there, ready to descend from the skies. Things like these, Loki, it’s just…” Steve lifted his chin, blue eyes darting to the sky like they could still see leviathans curling through the air. “They don’t stop. They never stop. First war I ever fought, they told us we were fighting to end all wars – and the only way to keep on and on, get up in the morning and wear the uniform another day, was to believe them.”
The screen was dark, no sound playing in the background for several seconds. Steve could still feel the tension thrumming in his skin, coiling tighter and tighter by the second as he stared unblinkingly at the screen.
, never came. “It’s one of the pitfalls of being a larger-than-life hero: no one notices your big brain.” Rhodey murmured back, and Tony’s next exhale was more delighted laugh than anything else. God, just.
His voice was quiet, but immoveable, all traces of apology erased. “You said it yourself, Clint. You made your choice.”
Agent Sixty Seven smiled at him dutifully, not an errant incisor to be seen, not even a mismanaged facial muscle. “This way please.”
They were silent, as they staggered outside: the cold Siberian sun shining down bright and white on their shadowed lids. The steady crunch of snow under their boots the only sound- after their eardrums had gone deaf from anguished screams and whines and fists and metal hitting metal. Then they listed suddenly to the side- adrenaline had run out and Steve’s limbs had gone weak, and Bucky tumbled over and landed butt-first in the snow.
It had the effect of straightening him up, hovering feet above the ground; something about seeing things from the right side of gravity resolving the view into high definition from the rain-washed swathe it had been. The sky heaved with rolling clouds, stretching over fields that ran every which way; slender, hunter-green leaf blades emerging from pools of flooded land, mud-flecked inflorescences drooping downwards to touch the water. There were no signs of alien activity, nothing out of the way, not even a crop circle, except–
“There have been contenders.” Ross inclined his head. “In particular, Norman Osborn has offered up his services.”
“I heard you said some things to Stark.” The afternoon light filtered through the strands of her hair, shadowing her eyelids. Last names. She must be feeling guiltier than she expected.
Steve was moving – achingly, achingly slow, mincing steps pushing through the sludge that caked his feet. The pungent scent of wet leather suffused the shelter, acrid even through the suit’s filters, damp-thick in Tony’s nostrils. He wanted to sneeze. He wanted to stop breathing.
bizarre branch of science liked; but he could still throw in a particle accelerator for fun-damn, the kid’s eyes would probably fall out of his skull when he saw Tony create vibranium in his baseme-
Sometimes he’d raise his head, elbow propped and chin resting on his knuckles, watching the rises and swoops of the pencil with dream-heavy eyes. It was hypnotising, watching that hand deftly guide the graphite in seemingly random motions, blind to the design that was emerging on the paper in the background. It seemed almost unimportant; until those fingers lifted and Tony’s eyes cleared, like the image had suddenly come into focus and revealed itself to be a masterpiece of chiaroscuro.
“Your wife isn’t home.” Natasha returned, and something in Clint’s spine released till the edge of the counter dragged up from his coccygeal to his lumbar. This was good. This was good. One at a time. If she was here, she’d smile at him with those solemn eyes again and Natasha would slink away in the background and he
“It’s nothing. Well.” The thumb fidgeted further. The teasing tone was draining slow, but steady, from his voice. “Me and the guys, from the old unit. We used to get together, once a year, same day, drink to the guys that didn’t make it- Riley, couple of others. Grab a drink, reminisce…..you know what I mean?”
okay, he had to commit here. Tony leaned a casual elbow against the doorframe, toilet bowl in the background, and received a drizzle of plaster in his hair for his efforts. “Yeah. Like an…uhm..internship, they call it? Yep, that. Work with R&D, see the best tech months before it goes into production, hell, come up with a good enough idea and I’ll make sure that it’s
assaulted his eardrums; heart pounding at a hundred beats per minute and muscles still frozen in a backward flinch. Right, another door.
Steve’s lips curled, bitterness staining the motion. This was like giftwrapping nostalgia and smacking it straight across his face, sharp and painful.
Dawn arrived, bright and sunny-or dreary and dismal, he wouldn’t know. Steve hadn’t looked at the sky in a while.
Natasha watched him over the counter, hollows under her eyes. The light didn’t look like it was limning her every feature, now. Just putting her shadows on display.
aware you’re saying that to a self-proclaimed genius. Hell, weren’t you the target of that particularly sassy proclamation?”
century arm brace from Iran, built of steel; a Persian helm with a solid bronze body and hanging chainmail to protect the neck and face, the lattice finer than gossamer curtains. An archer’s thumb ring from 18
“Fabrication complete.” FRIDAY intoned, that soft soprano the only sound paring through the chilly workshop air.
“People. People eat popsicles and bananas and other suspiciously shaped things because we’re all fifteen year olds. Wear leather pants and tie cherry stems into knots….” And this is going nowhere. So his voice just comes out, quick and strained and a little lost. “People don’t. Don’t recite poetry to…”
“I’m sure you have.” Sam muttered. Then, a little louder, “Don’t worry about it, I’ll hang around.” Sound faded, with just the line crackling intermittently.
“Do you, perchance, need rescuing from that avalanche of fallen candy you’ve been squashed under?” Tony enquired generously. “Or maybe a hand up from that deep pit you tumbled down while running away from temples and surfing subways?”
It doesn’t get any better. Tony is still dazed a couple of days later, which is why he gets into a screaming match with Steph in the middle of Times Square during a battle. That’s right, screaming match with the woman who’d recited what may-or-may-not be love poetry at him. Because that’s just the way he
No matter how hard it was to convince yourself that heartburning, world-destroying agony was better than the nothingness. It led you nowhere, numbness assembling in layers, emotional calluses thickening until nothing could get through. Not joy, not sorrow, not life and its associated bittersweetness.
“That’s the tragic bit. You’re in a gallery.” Sam’s tone was impressively flat, even for him. “You’re in Australia. Go hiking in the bush with the poisonous snakes. Surfing with the murderous jellyfish.”
His chest locked up before he’d even really comprehended the words, pause dragging on as he blinked unseeingly at double walled glass. It… it wasn’t so much the other shoe dropping, as a giant fucking metric ton of steel, weight flattening anything in a mile-long radius.
“Nah, that’s Natasha.” Barton’s mouth moves, while every other part of him is giving the impression of sleep. “Have you heard those things? They’re fucking
“You do.” FRIDAY sounded a little….distracted, the way she always did when she was perusing information in her servers and talking to him at the same time. JARVIS never used to do that, even though their programming had been identical in those respects. It was wondrous, and endearing. “You could probably put them off till Thursday, they’re fairly urgent but will not impact too much on delay-“
Two lines, and that was it. Enough to suck him out of that poisonous little cesspool of nostalgia that his trip down memory lane had prompted. So tempting after all, to give into that train of, ‘remember how we used to laugh and have fun and dream hopeful dreams. Oh, no wait, that was just me.’
They were literally knocking into each other now-Tony and his partner cutting off the other couple’s natural trajectories, oh-so-casually boxing them into the far corner, elbows and kicking heels just barely missing body parts. Or not-the blonde kicked out her leg with an amiable smile, rounded toe tip landing straight on the back of Tony’s thigh-he buckled with a swear, a yell from the crowd arcing up, “You go, Danvers!” The woman shrugged nonchalantly, red lips mouthing an, ‘oops’. Her partner switched his disapproving glare to her instead.
“Cap, those guys shoot flames at a temperature over thirty two hundred degrees. Which if you’re counting, is eight Bosch ovens cranked up to maximum and tossed into an incinerator.” Surely even Captain America had to yield in the face of logic? Especially when he wasn’t in the red-white-blue-and-fireproof? “Last time, that was hot enough to blow holes into my armors.”
The hollows under his eyes were black- with lack of sleep, not bruises. His cheeks sloped inwards, his fingers shook constantly. Brittle and gaunt and the only living thing in a false memory- his eyes glittered as the scene began to dissolve.
“Thank you.” He whispered, sound barely escaping the ash, the hoarseness, the throttling gratitude. The Reality Gem shone on like a constant, Time a quiet counterpoint to the side.
And despite the impassive faceplate, expressionless and wrought of titanium, despite the voice modulator…Sam still heard it. The lightest, most delicate touch of contempt on War Ma-on Rhodey’s words. “Rogers and I can handle the civilian evac.”
Steve breathes the news in. The scent of summer is strong in the air, lilacs and crabapples and the soil itself.
“No your highness, thank you. You have been very kind.” And then, perhaps because he was getting a little restless. “Is it a matter for the Panther?”
“I didn’t know the stakes.” Clint huffed a short laugh, fingers tapping on his thigh faster. Any time now. “I was stupid. Everyone was stupid, sides be fucked to hell.”
had composed for him back in the land where rainbows double up as transport routes. Bruce and Natasha are the two main nerds in the debate, babbling on and on about some or the other famous dead poets that they admire-as much as a depressed guy with anger management problems and a sociopathic rehabilitated ex-Soviet assassin can babble.
, freaking hell Tony). Hijacking the hippocampus, reimagining and rewriting old memories. Traumatic memories- and Steve’s mind had flitted back to Bucky at the time and he’d smiled a little hopefully, but mostly in pride over the achievements of a friend. So generous. So thoughtful.
In spite of the myriad feelings twisting behind his sternum, Tony turned- and a bot with one hand rolled up the kitchen floor, pepper can held aloft.
ago. Add to that the fact that no one read that fast, and Tony had been the MIT Bar Bros’ (which was decidedly
More quiet – Tony glanced to the side to meet those blue irises again, that seemed distinctly unable to pull away. Steve’s jaw worked silently for infinite moments, before words seemed to spill out unconscious of himself and everything else, soft and faintly remembering. “S’been a while since I heard you talk like that.”
“Nothing’s changed.” And Steve watched on as Tony turned his back to walk away, everything done and over with, all the anguish and turmoil that Steve had been bearing on his shoulders for the past months completely futile.
Well, Steve thought, closing the lid of the bent laptop as far as it would go, plunging the room into darkness. Cool, dispassionate. Maybe Stark had a point when he said that some superheroes couldn’t be trusted to make the right decisions for themselves after all.
out of Steve’s lungs; his chest contracting rapidly and throat drying with a tightness that felt like someone had actually dealt him a blow in the gut. He blinked rapidly, swallowing again and again, but it was like breathing had quit on him and air was refusing to cooperate- he turned, but Sam was already sliding out of the seat and smiling, with that same caustic shame, “Catch ya later, Cap.”
“I do my best, boss.” He was in bed. Sitting up, though he didn’t remember that – white covers half thrown off, heels kicking lightly over the heated floorboards. He stilled them with a jerk, blinking again against the bright sunlight streaming through the ceiling-to-floor windows.
Or thousands. Tony leaned forward till his eyes were inches away from the smattering of dots, brain leaping a million miles per minute. “And since when is the UN proactive enough to send in the Avengers over ‘suspicious activity’?” To an area rampant with violation of human rights by government orders, no less. “Yeah, we’re bad news right now. But we’re still news.”
A slight exhale of amusement. Steve’s ears heard it, over all the chatter and music and Melbourne’s night air. Tony extended a hand, fingers long and tanned, the dark green card peeping from the crevice between his index and middle digits.
He couldn’t see as well as he would have if he’d been wearing the helmet, but that particular shade of blue wasn’t hard to miss. At the next intersection, stood a figure hugged head to toe in an eye-watering hue, snatched straight out of the American flag.
It looked…not beautiful, but tearing his eyes away proved impossible. Like watching a volcano erupt- awe inspiring and terrifying in its inevitability. It looked…
“They get turned away.” Rhodey replied simply. His dark eyes clouded over, because of course he was the kind of man who felt more for the suffering of others than his own. “The Australian government refuses to accept illegal refugees on its shores. Whether they’re fleeing from war or starvation, doesn’t matter. Thousands from Syria, Congo, Afghanistan…”
.wk. Well, that was an…interesting address. Tony caught his teeth pressing a little too tightly against his gums, and released the pressure immediately- eyes flicking to the rest of the details. No subject. Single attachment.
“I am sorry, but I must excuse myself. A rather urgent matter has come up, and I must fly out of Wakanda immediately.” For all of said urgency, T’Challa was as still and stoic as stone. “Forgive my poor hospitality, I and the Wakandan people would love to avail ourselves of the opportunity to entertain you better at a later date.”
Silence. It didn’t weigh on them like it did other people, settling comfortably instead in the spaces between-curling up on Natasha’s loosened shoulders, pressing down on the hands tapping out a constant rhythm on Clint’s thighs. Or maybe it didn’t weigh anything because there were no spaces between them. No room for anything to wedge them apart.
Steve was already standing at the intersection up ahead, lips moving as he spoke to some earnest-faced, freckly-cheeked officer. Chin bobbing as he listened intently to a response, sleeves of his tee pulling tight around the bicep as he gestured to the opposite end of the avenue. Hell, what thirty-going-on-ninety year old had the right to look this authoritative in a round-neck? In beige cotton pants? He didn’t even appear to have
He felt it, like clockwork; the smile breaking out on the other man’s face. The words were warm. “See, I never knew that about you.”
So something else escaped his tongue instead. “Sometimes, I’d think about if I was just imagining it too… too sunny. Too bright. What would’ve happened if I’d never gone down in the ice.”
“I hate running alone,” Steve tells Sam, who’s standing but two paces behind. He strides forward to catch up, reaches out and wraps Sam’s solid fingers over the strap of the shield in one motion. “Hold this for me, will you? Be back soon.”
But then something made him hold his tongue- and he took a step back in his head, and paused. Put aside what he wanted, for a second- and considered what was on offer. Pepper’s head was tilted slightly to the side, her expression firm but unsmiling- she was proffering a hand of support. Someone who’d pull him out of the bottles if that was what was required, make sure he was eating and sleeping, take care of him.
Evidently not. For Sam smiled next to him, lips twisted, voice filled with a queer, bitter compunction. “Which one? The android or the cripple?”
“I-“ Steve saw the second, the second of deliberation he decided to discard the lie in the face of this surprising forgiveness. “Yes.”
The answer is a farm that isn’t supposed to exist, in the middle of nowhere. “Minsk,” Natasha says instead, and it doesn’t sound like a lie he’s heard before.
” The menace in question quietened down immediately, blue eyes watching him attentively. Tony turned his head away from that stare, back faced to the bed he was still sitting on, gaze dropping to the wrinkled skin stretching over his thighs. He pinched a little of it between his index and thumb, the tiny liver spot marring the skin changing shape with the action. “Gather ye rosebuds while ye may. That’s the first line.”
All the Avengers are there, without exception, which makes Tony’s throat release with the relief and something coil tight in his belly with disappointment. They’re raucous and they’re mocking each other loudly, setting up the table; and in all the cacophony that comes with having these many superheroes in one room, Tony feels safe to notice that Steph’s changed out of her uniform, into a plain white t-shirt and black sweats. That she’s clearly cleaned his dried blood out of her fingernails, that the terrible wistfulness in her features is gone and she looks content to be sitting here, among her friends.
And then, of a sudden, Tony felt abruptly, incredibly embarrassed- a man in his late forties standing outside a teenager’s door, seeking…..what? Comfort? Solace?
was a darned sight closer to downtown Manhattan than the Avengers in the facility upstate. Flying over was a no-brainer.
They seemed to finally come to a consensus. At first, what had just transpired wasn’t apparent-they seemed to just fall back into their natural rhythm. Except the rhythm seemed…stuttered somehow, Tony stepping on to his left foot and pausing too long before the hop, his partner following through too quickly on her right. They pressed close, chest-to-chest, and Tony grinned widely over his partner’s shoulder, like inviting the entire world into the joke.
Steve’s was a life mired with regrets. But in this, insular instant – the only thing he regretted was having to let go of Tony’s bare hand.
that he was moving-except the blaring, blatant lack of purpose behind every adjustment of a buckle, every mounting creak in the silence as armour and Kevlar plates flexed and released. Another twitch, and Sam’s eyes darted to the side and down-ineffably caught by bare fingers curling and flexing uselessly in thin air.
Then, like an afterthought, to a statement completed before. “Tony Stark doesn’t seem half bad though.”
Tony shook his head a little, gaze still fixated on the floor. More statement than self-rebuke. “He lies better than that.”
This wasn’t like losing faith, like walking away in the middle of the journey. This was finally staggering to the summit, and seeing your destination over the horizon. This was adding that final fleck of paint, that dab of red, to make the picture all worth it.
split a lip on – and felt something rise to his mouth, too darkly joyous for a smile. “I think we go out there – and we fight for the right to stay alive,” He brushed chapped lips over those ruinous knuckles, a quiet promise, “and we fight to come back to each other.”
“Mr Stark, of course, has ascended to a whole new level. His heroic desire to shield his friends, family, the entire human world- married with his very human flaw of maintaining control in his world wounds him more than almost anything else. He is almost incapable- terrified of comprehending that there can be forces beyond his control, that the future he sees faster than anyone else is as unchangeable in his hands as in anyone else’s.” Steve had long dropped his gaze, and in the absence of a face before his eyes, it was like JARVIS was speaking in his ears again. Worried, anxious. Helpless. “So long he spent wilfully blind to the consequences of his actions, that once he chose to do differently and
His ears were pricked for the whine of repulsors, but they never came. The impact of boots on concrete rippled up from the floor through to his palms – then the Ferrari creaked around him, the back groaning slightly as if something had just sealed a grip on its undercarriage.
“But that doesn’t mean…” Sam started, and stopped in frustration, because he needed to get this across clear and unimpeded. “If you insist on accompanying him back to…back to where we’re keeping Barne-”
Sam stumbled as he landed; just the touch of a stagger before steadying himself, wings folding silently behind his back. There was no movement by his side, and he’d almost be fooled into thinking that there wasn’t anyone standing there at all-except for Steve’s tall, broad frame caught in a standstill, looming at the edge of his vision.
“Found it.” Peter declared, and that would have been enough except he followed it up with, “I keep forgetting that you-it feels good to have someone
His beginning words were slow, almost cautious, “I want to ask how you’re doing.” …but hell, he’d never been one for cowardice, and he wouldn’t start now. “But I’m getting the feeling that I’m gonna get punched in the face if I tried.”
Steve generally regarded himself as a rather patient man. Sure, he liked excitement as much as the next guy- his career choice was kind of a blaring signal on that front. But he’d always hoped….well, back during the war, his fantasies had always taken on a very particular form. Peace. Something like prosperity. Contentment, perhaps?
The wall at the far end of the room was already beginning to slide up-Tony strode over, refusing to let exhausted, runny leg muscles falter. The display slid fully open with a tiny pneumatic hiss, no privacy codes, iris-scans or fingerprint-matches needed. Tony had been holed up in the workshop for the past eight hours, and nothing was going to fool FRIDAY’s security except a clone from another dimension. FRIDAY would probably raise an objection to weird radiation from said clone even then.
He compares himself to one, sometimes, when he’s in the mood to be spectacularly cliché. Constantly on the road to burning up, burning out, a candle flame that flutters twice as much when closer to extinction except think magnesium powder and ten times the explosion. Helium and oxygen, burning and exploding over and over and over, till the star consumes itself from the inside-while people from several galaxies away gaze and admire and make wishes. Nova…then nothingness. A black hole that sucks everything bright away.
Steve tugged the earphones out, winding the wires around his fingers before stuffing it inside the back pocket of his jeans. He moved towards the baggage collection area, retrieved his small backpack with a smile. Sucked in a breath, nodded at the doorman. Passed the ornamental wall of falling water, stepped outside.
Before his brain could pare through those words, his feet were already moving. Towards that corner, the corner of the workshop he’d tossed all of his other junk in openly, the corner he’d half thought of renaming, ‘I’m not a fucking coward’. The one with junk like a tiny glass box labelled-
“Well they’ve got you now, huh hotshot?” Tony wriggled in place a little; his butt was starting to go numb. The table creaked ominously, Rhodey shooting him a brief warning look before lowering his head to the design again. “Ex-Air Force, uses full names and proper designations for everything. It’s Colonel Jessup’s wet dream.”
“And it takes on marks and washes them off just as easily. Camouflages under gold paint as jewellery.” Steph murmurs, clouded blue eyes far away in thought and…is she actually taking this seriously?
Whoever taught Captain America how to make audibly sarcastic quotation marks needed to be tried for federal crimes. Plus, he was right on the money with this one – Tony knew Sam and Rhodey were on mission, and
Steve didn’t know how long he stood there, hopelessly caught by dark, flashing eyes and joyous laughter-till the outbreak of applause startled him out. The song had drawn to a close, and two of them were, dear god…Tony and Rhodes were standing a metre apart, face to face, legs together and backs military straight, saluting each other. The sound of his own laugh, small and helpless, caught Steve by surprise-oh god this was…this actually made him empathise with those hordes of girls on campus squealing their hearts out over one thing or another…it was all just so ridiculously
Pitch black like Tom’s, now that he thought about it. Steve raised his eyes to meet Tom’s stare, that regard too perceptive by half. It was…he felt pared through, scraped over.
He stopped for a second before it before hating himself for the pause; picked it up with his gauntlet while loathing every pitiful part of himself that cringed with unease and unworthiness. Tony turned and walked back to where the armour stood, grip tight and cramped, footfalls coming hard and fast. No pauses this time-before his brain could weasel out with any contradictory orders, before his breath could freeze or heart could shudder, before laughter or banter or accusations or screams could ring false through his ears; he hoisted the shield over his shoulder and swung.
A strange feeling was beginning to crawl through, somewhere underneath the righteous anger- but then Iron Man caught the shield by its edge and blasted memory-Steve in the side; of course Iron Man wasn’t going to be taken down that easily. Memory-Steve buckled to the floor, between two pillars.
(He knew the language still smelt of home to her. A home that had given her more pain than belonging. A home she could never return to.)
“What?” Steve resisted the urge to glance around wildly, as if Sam had been spying on him through the numerous cameras mounted on the walls and had caught his little struggle and subsequent moment of victory. Miraculous as modern day technology was, Sam was an ordinary American university student, who did
“In the wake of SHIELD and Hydra being lambasted openly in the public, there was a clear and obvious shortage of funds.” A small thread of what sounded like exhaustion snuck into Ross’ words. “Congress, or indeed any other nation’s government, could not continue giving money to SHIELD, not while its reputation was still so tainted-state budgets tend to be public things. An intelligence gathering organisation like SHIELD needs its resources: money for bases, weaponry, tech. Helicarriers aren’t built out of goodwill. Fortunately, companies like OsCorp have been much freer with their trusts and purses.”
The workshop gently glowed to life, illuminating a stretch of floor almost completely littered with ceramic shards of erstwhile broken crockery. That was…a lot of mugs. He was going to have to pick his way out carefully. Maybe even get a cleaning crew in. He hadn’t had people in his workshop for a while.
Tony’s face stared down, lips clamped down tight like his teeth were biting through the skin on the inside. There were streaks of shining moisture on his cheeks, clear tracks running down the grime. His voice rang like iron. “No. No. Not good enough, Rogers. I don’t accept this, I can’t–”
“Why didn’t you?” Tony asked, and it was like his mind had whited out with the pain again, images flipping before his eyes in a vividly torturous reel. “There was nothing stopping you.”
And Steve….he had a tic. He knew about it. He could never stand to be quiet when someone was in his face, issuing challenges. Even when he should have. Maybe that was one of the reasons why he and Tony couldn’t help but rub each other the wrong way, sometimes. Tony Stark could never stop challenging people, and Steve Rogers could never stop accepting every single one that came his way.
Three steps away from the Mark I, and mini-missiles took to the air; hissing over his head and leaving smoke trails as they embedded themselves into the weapons systems of at least five suits along the wall, avoiding him entirely. A targeting system that prioritised weaponised threats over living signatures – smart in its design, buggy in execution.
, the version of him that Steve knew, appeared behind the domestic scene and pronounced that this was how things ought to have happened, but didn’t; and the plastic of the mouse under Steve’s grip squeaked dangerously.
. For all that it had gotten dimmer, the world also seemed clearer at the edges. Like a hazy picture beginning to resolve, showing all its grainy details, cracks in the wall. Steve breathed in the stillness, breathed in the dust. “How’re the husband and kids, Peg?”
But Peggy seemed to pay that no note and only smiled wider. Steve was braced for the breathstopping, jawbreaking clench of longing the sight brought – the corners of her quirked lips, the dip of her lower lip where the skin always seemed to be chapped and flaking. The carmine slash of her lipstick.
Two seconds. Two seconds in which neither of them inched forward, but personal space seemed to shrink anyway, two seconds in which the walls seem to close around them and whisper tales of intimacy, two seconds that were enough for Tony to catch Steve’s gaze slipping to his lips, just once.
“but don’t go anywhere, because we’ll be handing out free passes to dance classes! That’s right, Swing Patrol holds regular classes in the city, so if you liked the moves put on by our lovely guys and gals, we’re giving out a chance for you to attend any three beginner classes for fre-”
“Well, Barton is every nursery rhyme ever.” Tony says, because if he were a dwarf, he’d be called Meanie. He’s doing no one any favours by constantly making light of something Cap is trying to consciously share. He can’t seem to stop himself.
“Hiding secrets, asking no one for help, sacrificing yourself at every turn. I thought you’d stay this way forever. Until…the Accords.” And all for that Tony’s eyes were still fixed on that grey concrete, he could feel Rhodey’s gaze at the side of his face, willing him to look. “You discussed, and you negotiated. Argued and implored. Pulled every fucking trick you had, gave everything you could. Called in favours, bribed officials, made every promise. The guy who gave his address to a terrorist refused to fight till the last, possible second. Because the stakes were too high. Because your team needed you, even if none of them knew it. And you came through, and you did everything in your power to hold them together even if the world wanted to tear you apart.”
“I’m coming to the Japanese part of the exhibit now.” Steve fished out the phone from his jeans pocket, business end of the earphones plugged into the top. Tapped at the little rectangle, with the tiny red circle on his homescreen that he learned meant camera after six weeks of unmotivated fiddling. The Japanese ceremonial helmet that he’d paused in front of zoomed up on his screen. Steve waited for it to focus.
Nothing seemed to be working though, not to Tony’s satisfaction. Every reimagined take was cut short, truncated abruptly. In the aftermath, sometimes there was a black word or two of frustration- but mostly there was just silence, growing stormier as the days passed. He didn’t seem content with fantasies that depicted everything going his way (Steve couldn’t even remember Tony trying such a fantasy- and time had taught him enough that the first recording didn’t count), and reimaginings that swung wildly in the opposite direction-
“Tell me if anything changes.” Tony moved through the corridors till he emerged in the communal kitchen- shining and spotless. There was a jar of paprika slightly skewed from its position in one of the cabinets, but that was easy enough to ignore. There was a jacket slung over one of the steel chairs- one of his own. Pulling it over bare skin, Tony picked up one of the tablets on the glass centre-table and pulled up his account- dark eyes skimming over screens as fast as his finger could pull them up. “Don’t I have about two hundred documents or so to look through and sign for SI?”
“Of all the places you could go to on holiday,” Sam sounded resigned and amused all at once, like Steve had no comprehension of how entertaining and simultaneously pitiful his antics were, “you had to pick the one where everything can possibly kill you.”
Five more steps and they came to a stop, feet sinking slightly into the muddy sand. Steve began by folding his knees, then gingerly bending at the waist-Tom holding his arm up all the while. The grip slackened and Steve hit the ground with a thump, the impact thudding up his tailbone, all the way into his spine. He stretched his legs slowly, heels drawing vertical lines into the roughened sand, arms drawing back with scraped palms resting against the same gritty ground. The supporting touch left his arm, and Tom settled himself by his side-legs folding comfortably into lotus position, like it was his front porch. Steve supposed it was.
And Ross paused in response, for reasons undecipherable, his eyes scoping over Tony for several seconds. When he spoke again, there was no smile arrayed over his features like a production; but no hostility either. “Sometimes Stark, I wonder if you know yourself at all.”
“Again and again,” Steph begins quietly, dabbing away at his scraped collar bone with motions that ache in their gentleness. “even though we know love’s landscape. And the little churchyard with its lamenting names, and the terrible reticent gorge in which the others end.”
He snuffled against the pillowcase, breath moistening the cotton against his lips. The sweat on his back was still drying, the cool air in the room gusting past it pleasantly.
Minutes crawled by in silence. Three waves had crashed into the shore, and ebbed back out, before he found the voice to speak again.
, a plate sliding free. There wasn’t much to be seen in the near non-existent light, except the gleam of dark eyes.
Right at the edge, before the stage sloped down into steps-Tony paused. Looked back distractedly, eyes catching over Steve’s.
Tony grinned outright, moving away from his spot behind Rhodey’s shoulder to turn the corner of the table, and promptly squat his butt atop it, a foot away from the drafting pad. Rhodey’s brows climbed, but he said nothing. Tony beamed, swinging his legs, a dignified man of sixty five. “My nicknames are always appropriate, pumpkin patch. Can
Steve pulled back with a decidedly toothy grin, even as Tony rubbed at his twinging earlobe, blinking rapidly into the land of the living. “You seemed to be pretty open to it twenty minutes ago. Awake now?”
“Hrm?” Tony shifted on his creeper stool, tailbone twinging with the motion. The legless torso of the Mark XLVI was suspended at his eye level, cable entrails dangling to the floor.
…but it didn’t really matter, did it? Steve turned, slow and unhurried, hands burying themselves in his pockets again. His shoes padded softly against the asphalt as he walked, navigating around spilled food and fallen banners from the White Night celebrations. A night of living, they called it.

and tilted about its axis: a merry, merry, merry-go round. His head hurt, his neck even more so. The suit was so heavy.
Or maybe the other people did mean for the silence to weigh just so- but T’Challa just interjected with a non-committal, “I suppose.”
he say? All the words were jumping up and down and falling all over themselves, utterly inadequate. Sorry- but he’d said that in the letter already, and it solved nothing. How is Rhodey doing?- but that would probably burn worse than a half-baked apology. I wish I could do everything over- but wishes weren’t horses, and the things he’d already
He trailed off. The cue to cut him off had been ‘white’, or possibly, ‘presents’ – which meant people weren’t paying
(And for all of that, Sam still knew better than anyone the importance of-sometimes-keeping yourself deceived.)
Onscreen, Tony’s hands were jammed into his pockets, as he waited- frozen in time, for the light to turn green, among a crowd of strangers.
“Nice place, isn’t it.” Peggy tilted her chin, dark eyes flitting over the light fixtures and checkered décor.
Tony turned away from the window, something suddenly, terrifyingly dizzying about the height, the endless blue skies. The phantom smell of smoke lingered in his nose – fire on his helmet and burnt concrete.
Tony glanced down and was greeted by a whirring arm, rising and falling in cheery motions. A little flicker upwards of the lips- Tony leaned a hand down to pat DUM-E’s strut, then continued stroking in continuous movements, loathe to leave contact. “Crept up on me while I was busy, didn’t you. You’re getting sneakier.”
it didn’t sound physical, as much as Tony strained to jump to the worst conclusions. It sounded…wistful. Pained.
Oh, fuck it. “When you’re done breaking the hearts of middle-aged creeps, could you Google ‘high definition murder nightmare’ for me please?”
“I don’t un-” FRIDAY began, but a sharp whine cut her off-the sound of a repulsor charging. Tony straightened his elbow, gauntlet pointed straight ahead. His fingers flexed as the pulse discharged; an unconscious reflex that didn’t do much since the armour was deploying the order.
His fingers smoothed the surface unconsciously, patting down the most recent creases. Folding it down and tucking it back into his pocket.
“The first time I…the first time I thought of you like…” Steve trailed off, but Tony needed no clarifications. “When we were in the bathroom at that kebab place. You wanted to find things in common between us, and the first thing we agreed on was that we both liked being good at things.”
The sound of graphite over paper resumed – Rhodey patiently etching out line after line, mechanical pencil light in his grasp; Tony watching along, absolutely absorbed. Apart from fleeting thoughts about how impossible this would have been for him ten years ago, his attention barely wavered. He didn’t remember the last time he’d physically completed a design – MIT, maybe. Rhodey’s style had barely changed since then: he was all about the clean strokes, well-defined boundaries. Used an eraser whenever there was a scribble out of place, scrupulously neat as ever, but never too much as to wear down the paper itself.
Something that might’ve trundled out, curious about all the noise and eager to investigate. Something that would’ve wandered right up to the Mark VII, treads bumping unevenly on the glass-strewn floor, thinking it was a friend and–
Tony, by contrast, was all about sketching and resketching over the same figure, models A through F scrawled over each other, somehow coalescing into one whole coherent to Stark eyes alone. Rhodey sketched out broad skeletons, defined each major part before fixating on the details – while Tony just ran from specifics alone, building upwards and outwards till the details sort of tumbled into critical mass, somehow forming a bigger picture. Yet, they worked. Both of them.
“Every week, I go up to the terrace.” And it was strange, that for all the bouncing around that their conversation had been doing, that this particular one should feel apropos of nothing. But Steve was speaking slowly, lips carefully feeling out the words, eyes seemingly fixed on an absent point above his own shoulder. “The pool. I ask JARVIS to…to reduce the temperature. And I try to get in, as far as I can.”
Sam sighed heavily again. “Whatever you say.” Then a quick glance, down at his wrist where his watch was strapped; the third time this evening.
“There a reason you showed me the non-official data?” Mark LV? No, way too bulky. He’d need something sturdy
Tony continued staring at the two men smiling on screen. There had to be a point to this. Was there a point to this?
- whoa. Okay, diminished pain but a stupid amount of dizziness…was there water around here somewhere? Coffee maybe?
(Captain America fighting villains in shorts, and he’s too distracted by the blood of her victims running down her strong jaw. He’s never really been into kink shaming himself inside his own head-but
He hadn’t believed he could have felt anything stronger than the disgust that had uncurled through his chest then-…..but this.
to Jupiter and back. As it was, Tony just smiled, bright and blinding. “Thanks hon. I’d do it more often, except that would put party planners out of business. And that would
The sound of a repulsor charging hummed through the air-Sam could feel the hair on his arms prick up, goosebumps breaking over chilled skin. A quiet, focused blast-the colour of gold sand and concrete walls flashing in the sudden burst of light-and then everything faded back to silver and shadow again. Leaving behind a gaping maw of blackness that led below ground.
But it soon became apparent that he wasn’t grinning at the audience at all; the dark-skinned, stately man was scowling over his own partner’s shoulder, decidedly unimpressed. He tucked a hand around his companion’s elbow (straight trousers, short, voluminous blonde locks) and moved right. Tony and the redhead moved right. And then left, and then into a quick turn at counts five and six, exactly like the couple two feet away from them.
He’d thought he was going to blow it up large, hang it in the penthouse foyer when all the Avengers eventually moved in. Hah.
“You’ve worked so hard. Been… unmeasurably brave, done so much.” Peggy’s eyes glistened with the warmth of a thousand setting suns. “I couldn’t be prouder.”
It was immediate, the hot, crawling shame sliding through Steve’s veins- Tony’s fingers were coming up to massage the bridge of his nose, when Steve shut the recording off and dropped the phone, the device falling to the mattress with an inconsequential
“SHIELD agents will still be running SHIELD.” That diplomatic smile was back in place on Ross’ lips. “We just can’t put someone who was on the payroll while Hydra was still a part of SHIELD, on the face of it right now. People know your face, it’s been ages since you’ve been accused of anything particularly reprobate, your stance on the Accords is making your approval ratings hold steady. We can even use your heritage to make a better case for you. The son of one of the founders taking over again-”
“Baloney. Benefits of early rising, I’m sure there are a million articles out there.” He walked to the door, pushing it open, feeling it yield softly under his fingertips. A slight pause. “Is Rhodey awake?”
Steve blinked. Stepped back. There, hanging on the wall were just two shields-iron painted dark and gleaming, cold and hard. Memories of blows ringing past the surface coating the iron as thickly as any paint.
Natasha’s smile settled into the crinkles of her eyes, a colourless drop leaking out the side and vanishing into the curve of her cheek. Her voice was ever-so-slightly hoarse, and in that moment more tempting than any Black Widow act she’d ever put on. “You can keep this, if you want. Keep all of this.”
It’s practically encoded into the DNA of a futurist: mingled with the marrow of their bones. The regret, muted ache and white-hot agony by turns, propelling him faster and further like a stallion under the lash. He can’t wait for all the variables to reveal themselves. He can’t even wait for the problem.  Time is his enemy, and he has to,
Tony didn’t much notice the rather long, uncharacteristic pause before the next sentence, as immersed as he was in the integrity of his omelette. When it came though-
, he thinks, when she surveys him with disdain and unbending posture, fifty thousand feet above the sea in a Helicarrier that’s fated to crash. She calls him flashy, and he calls her useless, and when he spits his catchphrase at her with none of the anger and all of the smarm, she adopts his father’s voice and tells him she’s known men worth ten of him.
“Wasn’t expecting you to stay back and broom the café floors.” Steve smiled, though it was a weak twist of the lips more than anything. “Thought we could discuss… possible culprits? Motive behind attacking this location?”
.” Tony whines, but the laughter has already started-skipping gaily from one member of their insane little circle to the next. Turns out, Clint can definitely snort mid snore.
a way of working past their common lines? Walking the tightrope, being careful not to nudge things too far either way. There
He’d missed it. They were all significant in their own rights, the Mark I that set him free, the Mark II that lifted him to the clouds – but there was something inescapably…singular, about this one. Maybe it was just the nostalgia, maybe the visceral sensation of being inside the suit of a hero on a team of heroes. This was the armour that had dismantled a Chitauri whale, that had directed a repulsor at Loki’s head, that had been caught on countless cameras and immortalised in photographs…the very first ones, of the Avengers.
Steve reached him, pale-cheeked and muss-haired, like his cowl had just been knocked loose. He wasn’t carrying it either, and Tony spared a moment to mourn its absence. It felt freeing, in a way, to desert self-delusion and admit that it would have been nice to see that bright white A again, outlined in patriotic blue.
? Judging by Steve’s sparkling countenance, that would be a yes. “And you use them as literal manifestations of your ability to annoy people to death.”
“I don’t know, kid.” He relinquished the chair with one last flourish, and a single fatal creak, walking over to stand next to Peter before the window. Outside, Queens bustled- in its crowded, closeted, comforting way. “I rather like your world.”
This, was his life now. There were plans of course, large, elaborate plans for secret divisions of erstwhile superhero teams- but while the climate remained this unstable and hostile……there was a bit of a hiatus on that. So yeah, this life. Not the greatest in terms of excitement. Stepping outside was irresponsible in the extreme most of the time, so he worked out indoors. Sometimes he drew- but strange, frightening shapes emerged on the paper nowadays, the colours too stark, the red too bright; so he stopped. Sat down on his chair, and surfed the internet on his laptop like a good little twenty-first century man, all while the voices in his head tried their best to scream louder than the silence outside.
The repulsor powered down with a whine, and Steve blinked and blinked again, taking in the stunned silence. Bucky’s face was as blank as it had ever been, but there was the beginning of something waking in his eyes; the dull, disbelieving shock of a man whose execution order had been incomprehensibly, impossibly stayed. Memory Steve could barely keep the awful gratitude off his face, trying and failing not to sound relieved beyond all measure as he asked- “What was…why did you-”
“But to answer your question….” But the pronoun was too unspecific. The Panther couldn’t know who was being referred to. And yet there was something so
Tony wanted to blurt; except of course Steve did. What exited his lips instead, was something a little less voluntary. “Gather ye rosebuds.”
Not even a half-hearted shrug this time, just matter of fact words. “You wouldn’t have done anything differently.”
“Mr Stark gave it to me.” Vision said. As if there had been any other possible answer. As if Steve had been expecting anything else. “He told me to keep it, and call if additional assistance may be required on a matter, as per my judgement.”
(For someone who derides poetry as much as he does, these thoughts might come off as hypocritical. No, not really. He’s a scientist, it comes as second nature for him to break things down into their constituent elements.)
“I.” Steve felt the words wrestle in his throat, let the true ones come out instead. “I’d like to think so.”
. This was the point where everything had gone so horrifically wrong. Solving this would be the first step to solving
“I’m not your Captain any longer.” A sense memory, of the shield clattering against the floor, a long, long….not too long while ago.
Tony stared at him, not quite knowing what to say. He had secured the vibranium, impossibly enough; questioning T’Challa’s motives behind handing it over was sheer idiocy. The man himself was an insolvable question- remote and solid and unflappable, though it all had to be a farce. Hadn’t it?
Tom turned again, as if just to accommodate Steve. His face still looked kind. “I apologise, that was unfair. You must permit us our…defensiveness. I mean it from the heart-do not take it personally. Someone like you, it’s just…”
Same, Tony thought. Same, same. Or maybe since when he was four, and learned how to talk. It was so difficult to define what ‘on my own’ meant.
It’s the full stop that annoys him. It isn’t a question. She doesn’t sound questioning. She sounds dubious…and if he’s being downright blasphemous, outright sarcastic. Captain America should not know how to do ‘sarcastic’ in addition to ‘heartbreakingly sincere’. It confuses the hell out of him.
They fight some more, and the world blows up around them, going to pieces. They fight together against an army, and for once, Tony Stark doesn’t feel so common. Doesn’t feel the urge to grandstand, to be the best and brightest. It seems almost natural, being part of an integrated whole. Voices in his ear and people at his back…and it’s a strange relief to not be one of a kind, not even in this.
was the first thing to strike his head. The man wasn’t very tall, maybe five feet eight, or nine at most, not enough to loom over the bedside. He was broad though-with wide shoulders, thick, sloping arms and a round-ish face. Strong nose, smooth chin under thick lips, set against dark skin and darker eyes. His black brows arched high on a curved forehead, sweat gleaming against the hairline-the hair itself short and black, bristle-like.
Except he did live with it, just not at that particular time. Steve cleared his throat, dry to the bone, something like ash lingering at the back of his tongue. “I had to… had to carry on, for five years after. At times, it was harder than the ice.”
“HR would disagree.” FRIDAY returned, tone coloured by warmth; Tony could feel his shoulders loosen slightly. She was here. They were safe.
“You know.” Peter began, a little apprehensively, after all the tech-flailing and idea-exchanging and science-rambling was done. There was an expansive hand gesture, probably in the direction of said ‘doodads’ scattered across his study desk- “Most…..um, adults. Would be pretty pissed that I was doing this.  Instead of. You know.”
“Sokovia, actually.” Natasha’s expression didn’t change, worn out yet implacable. “She chose to side with Hydra. Started off this whole ‘clusterfuck’.”
betrayed if he was praying for strength right now, the blaspheming bastard. “Because the canards and the ailerons perform the same function together, as you very well know–
(…Nate. God. If Clint started thinking about him now, he might just break down and then they’d get nowhere at all.)
He opened his eyes, and it was like the screen had freeze-framed: his onscreen self a meter too far and absolutely wiped of sane expression, Iron Man standing dispassionately over Bucky’s dead body, stray hair strands soaking in the blood.
Some people crumple in the flame, some emerge burnished and untouched. Doesn’t matter. He just needs to find a hotter flame.
His ears were ringing. Or maybe it was their footsteps, staggering yet resolute, slowly fading away.
It was infuriating. He raised the shield over his head and struck, again and again and again. The join between the shoulder and the torso, the jut inwards of the hip, the vulnerable missile ports at the fingers and collar bones. Nothing. Not even a scuff. Vibranium left scratches on vibranium…but he’d found a way beyond that.
Tony nudged the shoulder next to his, gently. Not quite forties-style handsy comfort, but it would do in a pinch. His mouth quirked up, a softened version of the smirks he doled out all too easily. “You
And just like that, the specs ricocheting off the walls of his head changed; morphing to older, more familiar forms. Tall-ceilinged bedrooms for gods unaccustomed to Midgardian dwellings, a gymnasium built to withstand the workout of people with super strength, a biomechanics lab for the likes of one of the best biologists in the world. A shooting range for a peerless marksman, an obstacle course for a fighter who never lost her balance. An art studio for…
because this was the master mechanic at work here, the man who could put almost anything back together. “Then there has to be some level of give and take.”
and trite nature of the words lifting off his tongue…but he couldn’t have this conversation with a shell.)
“Is it the Spiderling again?” Rhodey’s eyes narrowed so swiftly that it was almost hilarious. If the idea of finding something hilarious right now wasn’t hilarious. Or bipolar. “I swear Tony, if you’ve gone recruiting in high schools again-”
Through glass doors, he could glimpse a shadowed space beyond, with shiny wooden floors and grey walls. The doors gave way silently with a push, Steve stepping through inside.
Right. Right. So this is what they’re doing. Skipping the writing on paper, saving the environment, going straight to the oration. Nice. This is a thing. This is going to be a thing, a significantly harder thing, considering the whole ‘failed high school English’ detail, but Tony will manage, Tony will probably design an app or something, JARVIS’ right brain is a little underdeveloped anyway…
“Morgan.” More liquid, welling up at the edges of those eyes, where the laugh lines usually sat – Steve ached to reach up and brush them away.
“I guess I just like being around things older than myself.” The exit yawned open beyond the displays, a steel mezzanine leading to the ground level. Steve pushed past glass doors again, walked downwards slowly.
Tony’s lips twitched upward, like trying for a shape they’d long forgotten, or hadn’t ever learned. It didn’t seem like a betrayal to try, though. Not anymore. “Wanna walk?”
had finally been proved- but he was strangely devoid of anything, but a lingering ache in his bones and the lead in his gut. “Vision, does Tony kno-“
“Old wounds heal slow.” Tony informed her sagely. He scuffed through his own head of silver, breath falling naturally. “Just…thoughts of passage of time, y’know. Anniversaries. It’s the time of the year for that kinda thing.”
Steve’s expression was just as candid, but there was something flickering under the depths there- something in those eyes. His voice didn’t waver. “I need to tell you something.”
…and that was it. The letter crumpled under his fingers, and Tony twisted his neck back on the headrest to stare at the ceiling, panels grey and dim. The light fixtures were bright though-scoring past his pupils and creating bright spots of blindness.
Maybe there was still a flicker of hope, persisting beyond the reach of logic somewhere in his brain. Something that lived for a grand total of fifteen minutes, before dying an ignominious death – as he pulled himself to a standstill six feet above
, Tony.” And Steve finally, finally turned his head, eye contact established unblinkingly; and that was why, he hadn’t been blinking, that was why his eyes were red-rimmed and blue irises glassy, that had to be…had to be it.. “I can’t go on like this. I can’t stand still, even though I should. Can’t stay quiet, even if I must. Can’t pretend I have absolutely nothing to say to you, because…this isn’t an emergency. This isn’t an emergency, and yet I know me, and I know you, and when the next emergency comes around, what’ll be left of us is me talking – apologising
There was a break there- a second of quiet that almost weighed heavier than anything Steve had been struggling with for the past few months: undercut sharply when Clint dropped the instruments in his hand with a clatter; light, piercing eyes that unerringly found their mark each and every time fixating on Steve’s face.
Natasha’s fingernails tapped against the countertop. He never knew if it was a fidget she only let herself display in front of him, or if it was just a display.
Crawling silence. He wouldn’t know if it had been seconds or minutes, while he watched Steve’s gloved hands flex uselessly at the edge of his sight, twice and thrice and four times. Watched his lips flicker minutely, eyes affixed to a point ten metres to War Machine’s right, where a circle of light glowed in a scarlet-and-gold chest. Witness an indrawn breath, sound just about to take birth-
The thought flashed past his mind, quick and involuntary, and it took a couple of delayed seconds for Steve to realise he’d voiced it out loud. Shit, he needed the serum to start working faster; he needed a clear head
Feeling around for his 14 mm spanner, Tony registered a rustle of static like a sigh. “I will poke you in thirty minutes.”
Tony had been inching back to the suit with every sentence of that last bit, fingers already fiddling with the storage drawer of the creeper. Still one more verse of the song left to go, and he couldn’t possibly turn in to bed before that incredible guitar solo. He was in such a good mood – there was time to get in one last tinker, surely? “Sounds good to me.”
to go, did he? It wasn’t a binding contract, he could just take the pass and…and not go, just raise his hand, take the scrap of paper from Tony’s warm grasp…and Sam said talk to people your age but Tony was clearly older than him, and-
It changed nothing though. By the time his eyes could comprehend the action again, Iron Man was flat on his back and memory-Steve was pulling back his fist to punch him right across the face. Again, and again, and Steve let out a tight exhale when memory-Steve paused for a second, but it was only to retrieve the shield and fuck, they were back again,
Tony waited, panic blearily waking to life somewhere at the back of his head. For a pop culture reference maybe, niftily materialising in his mind to guide this conversation to a safer direction, something blasé and glib and ever-so-slightly-discouraging to those soft, lowly spoken words.
“There’s been a….situation in Russia. St. Petersburg, to be exact.” Vision’s voice was careful, almost inordinately so. “The UN Council is dithering over whether to send the Avengers or not- Russian sovereignty is a rather delicate thing to violate. I don’t believe the Russian government would seriously object to our presence there, but by the time anything is fully finalised, there may be several lives lost already. Considering the Accords are new and must be honoured to restore the public’s faith in us- well.” And here, his words slowed down to something even more cautious. “The best option in this scenario would be to send a group….not technically under the purview of the Accords, per say, owing to a lack of signatures- to get in, erase the threat and get out before any significant damage is caused.”
“We’re rich and eccentric, it works out.” The words flitted out heedlessly, like Tony’s lips were moving and he didn’t particularly care what came out.
Tony watched Steve Rogers walk side by side his memory self, words flicking back and forth between the two lightheartedly. The Avengers facility loomed tall and glossy in the background, the lawn still smoking from where Thor had taken off to find answers in Asgard not two minutes ago. Steve was in his uniform…Tony’s eyes dropped automatically to the bare strap on his back, the empty right hand; and felt like a first class coward for the tight mix of relief and clawing black hurt in his chest.
“I dunno.” Steve didn’t hesitate with his smile. Everything about that face, the voice, demeanour…so forthright. So open. Fuck, this was worse than the memory Tony was trying to rewrite each night. “Family, stability…guy who wanted that went in the ice seventy five years ago. I think someone else came out.”
Howard. Maria. Obie. Obie. Obie. Natalie. Fury. Captain America. Himself. Bruce. Pepper. Clint. Natasha. Steve.
“Hold on for a second.” Share, share, share…okay, this he had actually done before. Share to Sam Wilson…done. Hell yes.
“So the offer’s rescinded?” Tony asked, still seated and chin raised; eye level half that of Steve’s and still looking him down.
“Was the end of war. Couldn’t have been all sunshine and roses.” And for all of his heartache, he’d gotten to skip that part, hadn’t he? Hadn’t had to live with the aftermath. Bombed out streets, diners that were looking a lot emptier, hollow smiles and haunted eyes, empty chairs at the kitchen table.
Nothing. Unmoving, still cars parked side by side, still walls. Even the lights didn’t flicker. Not a fly, or a whisper, nothing different from the thousand and one late nights he had spent, utterly alone, in the workshop. God, he needed to pick DUM-E off the floor, bed was definitely on the cards if he was starting to see things.
Several metallic clanks, as Iron Man straightened and pushed himself off of the wall. Bucky was attempting to rise off the floor, inch by inch, metal hand still attached to his shoulder slipping a little in the blood that was starting to pool beneath him –
“You know it never went away. And so do the denizens of the world, what with the highly publicised rescue of the Sokovian citizens during Ultron’s rampage. SHIELD has and continues to do good, regardless of the Hydra debacle…we’re just planning on making it official.”
Alex – no, nope. This was an excessive reaction. He was excessing. Remember Pepper. He was zen. Zen was him. The game music wasn’t playing anymore, why was the stupid, peppy game music not playing anymore, Steeeeeeve–
“Shut up and revel in the burn, you whippersnapper.” Peter snapped his mouth shut, and somehow, inexplicably, Tony found himself matching the little grin that sprung at the corners of his mouth. “Hitting as fast as you talk is what gets you on the-”
“But.” Tony’s tone was stronger here, and yet also more desperate. “If something happens, in some corner of the world. If things go south, and……I tell you to stay out of it. Promise you’ll listen to me.”
I am so sorry if I haven't gotten around to responding to some of the comments yet; I thought you guys would rather prefer a chapter over my gushing words of gratitude XD  Some quotes in italics have been taken from Avengers (2012) and Avengers: Age of Ultron. Also, a couple of comics references for the intrepid nerd may be found herein.
“I don’t put much stock in how things used to be.” He took a few, unsteady steps backwards before growing sure of his feet, then turning to trudge painfully towards the exits. His muscles weren’t going to like him, hours come.
His knees dropped to the floor, cold concrete coming up to slam against bone with a painful crack. He twisted around, and threw himself chest forward under the chassis of the car, teeth gritting as he caught his weight on his elbows. He scrabbled forward, belly to the ground – the Ferrari Roma above him had a steel-and-aluminium body at least a meter thick, which gave him a few more seconds before it could be sliced through, maybe longer if the repulsors were initially on concussive mode.
Bruce muses out loud, “That’s E. E. Cummings, isn’t it,” and the calibre of Clint’s poker face would impress the hell out of Tony if he wasn’t so busy being stunned speechless.
Steve gave him a minute nod, and lifted his chin, jaw firming up. Sam’s wings unfolded to their fullest span, and he pulled in a breath. Seconds later, the ground had shifted away from his feet and he was careering away-cutting through shear and the blast of wind in his ears, following the scarlet trail.
“Latitudinal asymmetric thrust, ladies and gentlemen. It’s a thing.” Rhodey did the pencil-twirl thingy between his index and thumb – Tony had never been able to manage it himself, and it made him terrifically jealous. “The military never did understand how to rope SI back into a contract. Instead of generals with bristling moustaches and weak-ass intimidation, they should have just chucked their inept designs at you and you’d have been all over that with a red pen out of sheer frustration.”
“Very well.” T’Challa said, and stood up. “I’ll have it shipped over to your facility by the end of this month.” He turned around, meeting apparently concluded, prepared to leave.
In that other past, and now that was The Other – Peggy had set him free in the seventies, aided by information that Steve left behind. When Steve re-emerged in twenty-twelve, he had no idea where Bucky was and how the years had passed for him – fettering his impulses in steel, and letting it remain that way. His interference would accomplish little, and Bucky had always managed on without him.
“Full time access to the common areas of the Avengers facility wasn’t so you could play peekaboo.” Tony was rapidly remembering why he’d given the finger to government-sanctioned assholes not too many years ago-they were assholes. Secretary of State or not, Ross and his unimpressed eyebrow could go screw themselves, however that was anatomically possible. “Be an ass on Halloween like everyone else.”
“Despite what pop culture would have one believe, it’s hardly as simple as clearing a video game level. Fight through the projections, get the McGuffin-y physical representation of our hearts’ deepest desires, learn The Lesson, and bam – we’re out of the delusion.” It would be so…primally satisfying though, to beat the shit out of his issues. Then again, nine out of ten of his enemies in real life tended to be physical manifestations of his own screw ups anyway – the tenth slot being reserved for the odd alien, of course.
It felt like the sound had leapt out of the floor, deep enough that it was still reverberating somewhere behind his sternum. One of the bots, probably. It came from the far end of the workshop, out beyond the bend of the L-shaped space, where their charging stations were.
, it was that moment, the transition from apologies and trust and working on the same team to accusations and questions and...and….betrayal-
Steve tilted his head just a fraction to the side – Tony had no idea where he’d picked it up from but it was endearing as
“After everything that-after us.” His words were dropping like rocks, ill-hewn and utterly unsatisfactory. Clint moved his eyes to Nat’s, willing her to see. The missions, the blood. Fury, Hill…Coulson. Homes and hidey-holes, enemy bases and foreign cells. Mind control and ledgers and books read out loud. “I’d never blame you for the way you think. For not thinking like they wanted you to.”
“It’s right here.” Iron Man’s modulated tones answered, the machine rasp staticky over the ocean breeze. He was standing maybe fifty metres ahead, but off to the side, by the obsidian-black rock overhang. The gold of his suit was cast pallid in the shadowy, unearthly light.
,” Steve had to reduce his register to a whisper, but it was still rather irate for all of that, “-and she’s working for the government, and the two of us having any kind of contact could lead to suspicion falling on her and massive consequences.”
Infantry Regiment, born March the tenth, nineteen seventeen, Sergeant, war hero, best friend of Steve Rogers- brainwashed, Winter Soldier, Fist of Hydra, assassin, destroyer of regimes, best friend of Captain America, murderer of Howard and Maria Stark-
The bristles had gone down just as quickly as they’d pricked up, strangely enough; Steve’s gaze darting to the side as he went on to needlessly clarify, “Retirement. Hate to break it to ya Tony, but there ain’t exactly farms in New York.”
Well, Steve wasn’t in a warzone now, for all that his pain-ridden eyes seemed to forget that at times. So Tony finally took a physical step back, mouth curling up into that languid smirk it had apparently deserted some time during the course of this conversation. “Not that it would make any difference to our teammates. You know, what with us being in the men’s for over fifteen minutes now.”
at him. Her eyes are fixed at a spot that is not quite the screen, not really the floor. Her jaw is twitching, there’s a red sheen to her cheeks that seems to be born of something more than a work out, the words falling out of her mouth slow and clearly pronounced, almost like she’s working really hard to keep it that way and not spit it all out in a hurried garble.
obtained that I’m smarter than the rest of you sane, mature, non-epiphanised people.” And glassy-eyed or no, Tony still toasted the air with more than a slight touch of glee, voice hoarse and delighted all at one go. “I told you so.”
Growing up in the back of circus caravans and being shuffled from one foster home to the next wasn’t very conducive for cultivating a reading habit-and Clint didn’t boast of one. He’d only heard the Tolkien novels read out loud, and not until his thirties. Laura started reading
Another heartbeat, and the schematics for Peter Parker’s floor retreated deep within his mind; doors upon doors closing on the thought till Tony could push open the crappy one separating him from Peter, watch the kid’s clouded expression and respond with a smile that didn’t seem throttled.  “So did the slumlords make you sign a rental agreement? I hear things are pretty legit ‘round this side of Queens.”
Natasha’s swift look in his direction seemed to agree with him. She smiles at Stephanie a little and murmurs, “We are disclosed by the lies we tell,” and Bruce appears to smile at her in turn.
“This isn’t how it works, you know.” Tony drags the words out, every one screaming and thrashing in reluctance all the way. “People. People pick up pens. Bend over and pick up pens, I mean. And wrap their lips insinuatingly around popsicles and slurp on milkshakes an-wait, those were supposed to be first date milkshakes, weren’t they? The day of the Doombots?”
“Fair skin, flaxen hair.” Tom smiled again, small and quiet, as if it was a joke. “Someone like you…there are many like you. Men and women. Who come…build us houses. Hospitals. Schools. Who want to help. We see it, and we welcome it. We are grateful.”
His voice was climbing in amplitude. He knew it, and could do nothing about it. “She never intended to-”
“Mr. Stark, are you okay in there?” Peter’s voice rang through the flimsy door, half ‘am I crossing a line’, half ‘I really hope Tony Stark doesn’t die in my bathroom’. And a decent amount of concern in there too. God. He was such a good kid.
“Nah.” Sam waved the question off carelessly, but his thumb fidgeted with the base of the beer can. Steve proceeded to array his features into what his friends called the ‘Captain-America-slash-Concerned-Dad’ look (well, only one person ever called it that, but Tony wasn’t arou-); and Sam breathed out a soft puff of amusement in response.
Okay, he was making some progress in this direction. He was approaching the fringes of the-no, shit. The sidewalk was cordoned off by rope, the way cut off by a large Cadillac occupying the space. Down the road, he could see an entire parade of cars lining both sidewalks: a Packard 180 just adjacent to the Cadillac, a blue Nash 600 a couple of doors away. The Cadillac currently in his path was a Series 62; Mr Demero had had one of those, gleaming turquoise body and cream roof. And there it was, in form if not in colour, transported straight out of nineteen forty one: perched on a Melbourne sidewalk, with a
“While you do what, exactly?” Standing out in the open was making Tony antsy, but the three heat-signatures were still shimmering red and safely indoors. “Find cover and cower sensibly while Iron Man saves the day?”
“People hated being on group projects with you in college…you had built your third working model, and they were still flipping through reference books. So the professors just let you do your own thing.” There was something else to Rhodey’s voice now, the faintest, quietest trace of fondness. “I’d volunteered to be partners with you once, remember? First study session in the library…you never turned up, and I thought you’d gotten drunk off your face partying again. Lying incoherent in a pool of your own vomit somewhere, the irresponsible jerk. Cursed myself for having such a bleeding heart.” Rhodey breathed out a tiny laugh, shaking his head slightly. “Found you lying on the floor of your dorm, keeled over with dehydration, and this little mechanical arm whizzing all over the place, beeping crazily. Because of course you’d finished it all in a night. Remember?”
The Bentley toppled over to its side to cut off Tony’s path, impact juddering through the air as it lost further balance and flipped completely to flatten the Lambo next to it. There was a shard of… ow ow
For all that she could emote better than the world’s greatest mime when she felt the inclination, Natasha’s reading was steady and constant. No rise and fall of feeling, no words delivered faster than the next. Clint had no way of figuring out what any of it meant, except they did for three weeks and five chapters straight-her reading from the corner, him spying on the building across the street in one of the most peaceful stake outs he’d ever had. He remembered wondering what it said about him, that an assassin’s voice spelling out the conflict between criminal impulse and conscience was more soothing to him than any lullaby, but he stopped that train of thought quickly. Clint didn’t question the facts of his life, much. They got presented to him, he moved on and adapted as needed. Simple as that.
“My dad didn’t steal it! Appropriated it, maybe.” T’Challa raised an eyebrow, and Tony had to remedy- damn, the guy was good. “Possibly by illegal means. But hey, isn’t like tons of it doesn’t get smuggled out of the country every year anyway.”
“No.” The word finally hit the air, quieter than a whisper. Steve stared at the blinking lights on the instrument panel, eyes stilled. “It was Tony.”
“An old man’s allowed his hobbies FRIDAY.” Tony twirled idly on the stool, widescreens and ceiling beams and industrial downlights spinning slowly in his vision
The TV is on and running in the communal space, and Tony usually isn’t given to agreeing with the wisdom of the common public, but he’ll agree to this-goddamn, is it an idiot box. The only reason he stops is because he hears his name (and no, that isn’t narcissistic, it’s bloody human nature so shut your trap Romanoff. Even though she isn’t technically here. He supposes it’s a little disturbing that he has a mental Romanoff voice now).
Sam’s mother had a small wooden cross, hung on a simple gilt chain around her neck. Sometimes, when she’d take it off for showers, she’d forget to put it on again; and there it would lie, entangled in stray hairs on the ceramic of the wash basin, to prick at her conscience when she’d come to floss the next morning.
“Flatterer.” Tony whispered and opened his eyes  – his fingers were entangled, drawing tighter and tighter around his chain while the plain rectangular tags tinkled against his chest. “Sure sounds romantic to say that I’ve waited my whole life for you, Rogers.”
And so the game, and the day along with it, continued: replete with narrow misses with toasters, going on dates with androgynous people named Alex (Tony didn’t know the romantic prospects of a slice of bread could be so invigorating), living life in the wilderness catching fish with yourself as bait and then wrestling them to death – all for naught, because bread didn’t exactly have a mouth. Or teeth, or a tongue, or a digestive system. What did Alex ever see in you?
“I didn’t sell out.” Tony interjected, smile just as cool and unchanging. The pain blanketing his body was a faint roar at the back of his head. “I did what I believed in. I still am. Fortunately for me, none of that includes a ‘be nice to jerks who threw your teammates in jail’ clause.”
The clock in the dining hall ticked, what sounded like rats scrabbled in the walls. Peter’s voice was noticeably more timid when he voiced, “New doodads?”
Rhodey surveyed him like he was disappointed, and Tony was a bit of a moron. “Of course we do it in the uniforms.”
Wind whipped against the bridge of his nose as he emerged on the pad, the hulking lines of the Mark XLV glowing red under the afternoon sun.
When he turned his head to the side, minutes later, Tom was looking at him, steady and assuring. “You do good things, Captain Rogers.”
Peter, though. His age almost ensured his naivete, except for the fact that people his age nowadays were more cynical than most- and he had…ideas, about power and responsibility that made Tony feel like he wanted to hide the boy away from the world, free from taint. He’d only felt like that once before.
It soothed something small and raw in his chest, the sight of Bucky’s exhausted lips pulling into a smile that somehow, remotely resembled peace. The erstwhile Soldier leaned back, the chamber clicked shut, and ice puffed over the glass.
(sometimes, if he thought back hard enough, he could almost remember a time he enjoyed being a superhero).
He walked to the attached bathroom, still barefoot, splashed water over his face and throat. Avoided his face a little in the mirror, brushing his teeth and speaking through a mouthful of foam, “This what, the third time we’ve cancelled on Amazon?”
Not the long, straightened sheet of locks he’d gotten used to during D.C.; not even the braid she’d started putting her hair in in the past five years when her roots started growing out. No, Natasha’s hair was scarlet, violently red – and done in the short bob he’d grown to know when they’d first met, and when they trained the Avengers at the compound together.
“The part where it said you didn’t mean to hurt me?” Tony inserted, smooth and seemingly untouched- and Steve felt a familiar spark of irritation light up at the back of his head despite it all. Dammit Tony.
Tell the truth. Not the truth they want, but the truth nonetheless. Nothing you ever come up with will ever be as convincing as the truth.
A little sound – more of a wet exhale than an actual laugh, but when Steve looked back up again, his eyes were blue in exactly the right kinda way. The surge of pride flooding through Tony’s bloodstream in response to that was…a little staggering, honestly.
DUM-E rolled back, and bumped into Tony’s ankle again. More rapid motions. A light exhale of air hissed past Tony’s teeth- he was surprised to find that it was amusement. Or maybe affection was a closer fit. “Want me to stay here, huh. Okay.”
“Look at this.” Steve shoved the phone screen under Tony’s nose, which had a bit of an aquiline thing going on but still wasn’t any more qualified to be in intimate contact with an Apple product. Yeurgh. “It’s a game.”
Steve should…Steve should pause it. Close it. There were better things to do, like worry about how the hell this got captured on film anyway, it was probably that
“We just……we didn’t have much time together. Amid all the fighting. I miss him, I suppose.” Steve smiled a little ruefully, rubbing the back of his neck with his right hand. It was true enough, he guessed.
He walked away, and Steve kept staring at his back, as if in remote pleading for him to stay and explain- but Steve knew, and he did not know, and he knew, but didn’t
Steve gave a quick darting glance around. No men and women in black suits, fitted with Bluetooth headsets and a perennially suspicious look on their face. He lined up the picture, and dabbed at the shutter button on screen.
Either the system they’d turned their backs on was working just fine, or the current authorised Avengers chose to sacrifice lives and property rather than call the runaways for help. The second option seemed unthinkable-but in quieter moments, the erring thought that Steve would prefer it over the first passed his mind. Times like those, Sam usually dislodged it from his head and accepted in no uncertain terms that being cooped up and on the run was driving him insane.
And him being him, he could have all those thoughts all while debating through their thirty-seventh playthrough. “I say let Alex burn. We’ve saved that prat far too often and for far too little in return.”
“Take it up with her.” Was Rhodey’s lacklustre response, head craning to the side to squint at the lines on the page as if that would make a jot of a difference. It was a pencil drawing, not a freaking kaleidoscope.
“That’s……all you have to say?” Steve probably should count his blessings, but Sam was being suspiciously quiet, and knowing him, it wouldn’t last long. Better sooner than later. “You’re okay with it?”
A pause, all too deliberate. Clint felt out the words slowly, “I thought you and Stark didn’t see eye to eye anymore.”
“Perfect.” Tony could hear himself say. His knees shook slightly when he hoisted himself up from his chair. One brisk clap of the hands, to really jolt him out. “Alright Fry, enough of the mope-reminiscing. Show her to me.”
“Yes yes, she’s beauty and grace and makes you pop duty-boners,” Tony waved his hand distractedly, “actually wait, coming back to the boners – please tell me you do it in the uniforms.”
“Don’t.” It was like the churning tar inside his chest had been sucked right out. He’d spat out all the sharp words, and now his chest was sitting empty, contracting uselessly. “UN orders must have come by now, we need to leave in an hour at mo-”
Tony stared on. It was like watching a picture fading back to greyscale. It was dangerously like déjà vu. How did he ever used to believe that
Still- he couldn’t quite care about that right now. His voice was still a mystery to him- composed or hoarse, unsteady or emotionless. He didn’t quite know. “How did you- …which phone are you calling from?”
Peter scowled almost immediately. “Har de-har har.” And then the scowl replaced itself with a look of blind panic. “No wait, I didn’t mean that- yes, my high school life is absolutely and totally terrible, you can crack as many jokes about it as you like-“
Tony was delirious, so he thought he must have been dreaming it up at the time-Rhodey bursting in on him in frustration, then the scowl on the face wilting until it resembled something like resignation, and amusement. The affection in that voice,
by a game hatched by some Camden Town kid in his attic. A game evidently called ‘a day in the life of sliced bread’.
Inch by inch, Tony lifted his eyes from the page and watched them blankly stare back at him from the grimy mirror.
“Steve.” Something hit Steve’s cracked lips, tingling there – if he flicked his tongue out, he might taste water and salt. “You can’t give up like this.”
And as if in response to the question, the earpiece fitted into Stark’s earlobe (in addition to the helmet? Strange redundancy) burst into flickering sound.
. Steve wanted to say, but couldn’t, because one ear couldn’t be exchanged for another- and Sam was more than a ear. He was the most empathetic person Steve had ever known, with a staggering touch for healing. It was almost cruel to keep him away from helping people.
Three jars of blackberry jam on the counter, not counting the ones presumably-almost definitely filling up the fridge. The breath whistled out of his tightening chest; deceptively, despicably light. Sometimes Clint wished he and Nat weren’t half this brutally honest with each other.
He walked its streets in the hours approaching sunrise, soft-soled shoes padding against the cobblestones, mist curling around his ankles. No matter which direction he cast his eyes in, all he saw were half-crumbling structures- a building missing a landing, a house with its walls blown away and ceiling half caved in, pavements and walls scorched with bullets. No people, though that could probably be attributed to the early hour.
“Cool.” Tony said faintly. “If you’d mentioned you were feeling cooped up, I could’ve arranged some playdates with the other one-year-olds in daycare. Barton’s spawn was born last year… Neville? Nemo? Nessie?”
Steve blinked in startlement, bringing a hand up to shade his eyes from the bright spotlights. That…that hadn’t really happened, had it? Except it happened
“Compress everything, chuck a couple encryptions on and send it to Rhodey.” Tony worked his way through each finger, tugging until the joints popped. Yeah he had machines to do this kind of hands-on work now – but he’d spent a whopping three hours bug-hunting through a month’s worth of FRIDAY’s logs this afternoon and he deserved some tinker time, dammit.
Before he could do more than twitch though, Clint had already begun- sharp yet resigned. “What do you want me to say, Cap? I miss my wife. I miss my kids.” The eyes swivelled away, tracing some unseen path through the undergrowth. His lips curled briefly to the side. “I miss my bloody best friend who’s apparently forgotten
Tony completed inside his head, and stopped his thoughts right there. Respect for the dead, and all that.
(Agh, the voice shitted him the most. Tony missed that reedy, high-pitched wonder of a larynx, dammit.)
Steve stared at the bleak seascape, storm clouds buffeted along the sky by great winds. The sea was forever shifting, a gigantic mass of ripples, with white flecks in the distance. The moisture had soaked into his pants, clogged in the sand caking his thighs, wet the back of his shirt and dripped off the bridge of his nose. His throat was dry.
Of course, what he also should have done in the past was let “genius billionaire playboy philanthropist” and “isn’t that why we fight? So we can end the fight and go home?” and “we need to be put in check” roll off his back. But he’d stepped up, shoulders pulled back and teeth bared, each and every time.
“I suppose I just want to see if people ask.” Swando’s teeth were brilliant white against his lips, cheeks hanging loosely on the sides. He lifted a hand to his brow, deep-set eyes straining into the distance. “I suppose I must take my leave.”
“I know of them.” Tom said, and opened his eyes. His loose shirt was flapping in the wind. “So I suppose the answer to your question is that yes, I like them very much. I don’t know if I trust them.”
Still, he’s an optimist. He can find the advantage in this. “Poetry is a scam.” Tony begins, and settles down for a nice, long session of listening to his own opinions. And voice. His voice is great. “The whole point of it is lies, Captain. Not saying what you mean. There are no rules, anything can be interpreted anyhow. Rita wears a green skirt, the poet says. And every stuck up snob out there goes crazy about what it could possibly
“So we’ll handle the rescue, and leave the sneaking around to people who’re a little less shiny and don’t attract magpies.” The words escaped without thought. Like the decision had been made unconsciously ages ago, and Tony was only being made aware of it now.
“That…has been taken care of.” Steve replied, almost on reflex- mind still whirling over the fact that Tony hadn’t mentioned his parents, or even strictly answered.
Not twenty metres away, Bucky stiffened- and just like that, Steve’s mind was clear: muscles curling in preparatory action, right arm rising slightly in defence (and that, was the first drop of something infiltrating the purity, the faintest sense of displacement and something not being the way it used to be and….saudade).
, and the Mark I’s vambraces dislocated from the whole, sliding to the bottom of the alcove and toppling out with a clang. Tony lunged for the piece, fingers sliding into place effortlessly as he hoisted the flamethrower off the ground – it had been a while since he’d borne the weight himself, but some things never left your system. There was always the chance that the missile had severed an important connection, but he whirled around all the same, staggering in place but aim holding true.
It’s been twenty-three days since Steve told him about December 16, 1991. New traumas evoking older nightmares.
Sam smiled, faintest of the faint.  “Steady,” was all he said, and they began on their thousands of feet long descent.
, fighting bad, alongside some of the best people I’ve ever known. I want spies and gods and rage monsters and robot suits- and I want to know that they still want me too.”
The ocean tossed in the distance, grey tides crashing into the surf, frothing white. Tom’s eyes were fixed somewhere in between, the horizon maybe-except the divide between sea and sky was difficult to find, when they both were tinged so hoary. “It isn’t me. It’s…a consciousness, maybe. The echo of a memory passed from man to child, generation to generation.”
“I’m… yeah. Seems like they’ve got it handled.” Tony waved vaguely at the controlled chaos behind them, wincing at the squeal of a reverse alarm as a tow truck backed into place a couple shopfronts away.
Finally, Steve raised his head three inches above the pillow and groggily opened his eyes. The room was dark, yet his eyes still burned- there must still be a couple of hours to go before sunrise. There was a flash of light, reflecting off the darkened walls after every three seconds. The part of his brain that wasn’t still in the throes of sleep (or swearing up a litany of curse words), realised it was a notification on his phone. Probably what woke him up.
“But you had to save your friend, didn’t you.” And Clint looked at him, again, and Steve couldn’t look away- and there it was, all the acrimony. All the disappointment. “Everything else was secondary. Everything.”
“When did it happen.” Steve’s voice broke through half way. It was difficult to keep his heart in check-pounding along like hammer against anvil, coupled with the ocean’s deep roar in the distance. Everything was unmoored. The cracks had gone too deep. “This link-between knowing, and trusting. Aren’t we supposed to have faith in each other? In humanity?”
Because this wasn’t entirely a comfortable silence. Heck, it shouldn’t have been a silence at all; Clint should have been snarking and tossing out ridiculous jokes for Wanda to mock, leaving Steve to fill in the gaps with dry comments interspersed with concerned questions. But here Clint crouched by the stream with a very, very obvious shadow under his eyes, Wanda was out of sight and Steve…..couldn’t quite bring himself to ask how they were doing.
“Vibranium,” she whispers against his lips. Before he can ask for an explanation, Steph releases a slight huff of amusement, brushing amazingly past his skin. “That thing you do, you know? For Natasha and Bruce and everyone else…you never mentioned for yourself, and I thought vibranium, because you build things and protect me and it shines in your chest like..”
“I mean.” Peter scuffed a shoe against the cemented floor-Tony didn’t know people actually did that. “I
Tony smiled back, sharp and cordial. “Trying to endear yourself by projecting a sense of humour? I’m petty as shit though; I’ll just yell trademark infringement.”
, that totally violates the law of conservation of mass by the way- and god, Mr Stark. Can’t we meet in the Avengers facility the next time?” Archimedes almighty, those wheedling eyes. The joy and the excitement when Peter babbled, it made denying him incredibly difficult. “I mean, your world and mine, it’s just……it’s just so small, you know?”
– his hands quivered before the armour encased them, but it was easier when the chestplate slid into place, the HUD flickering to life with FRIDAY in his ear. Easier when he was soaring across the skies of New York City, machinery locked and loaded and entirely at his bidding.
registered something as a health hazard, it was pretty damn obviously hazardous. One nudge to the right, and that trunk was going to plow straight through the bed and the floor below. Probably flatten Aunt Petunia’s microwave downstairs too.)
Steve was half braced for a muttered ‘nerd’ or ‘dork’ or whatever other interchangeable insult people had fashioned these days for a person passionate about their interests. It didn’t come, just Sam’s patient voice from the other end. “And what’s White Night?”
Steve felt the smile rise to his lips, slow and inexorable. His heart was pounding steadily in his chest.
“I didn’t.” T’Challa said, and something twisted in those black eyes. “I wish to wipe him off the face of this earth just as much as the day I learned that he had murdered my father.”
The two parted: the redhead curtsied sarcastically, Tony swept into an exaggerated bow. The group next to Steve giggled again; his own mouth was curving upwards, outside his conscious control.
“All access all the way.” There was something magical about the reactions of people, mostly the non-SI employees, when they walked into a corporate elevator and saw that they were going to be riding it with a large mechanical arm. Tony sometimes went through the clips before going to bed – his current favourite was a harried mom with her kid headed for the childcare on the 14
“They were better prepared for us than we thought. Rogue Hydra weapon blew a hole in the train, Bucky got blasted out.” A sharp breath, a contracted chest, like all the oxygen in the world wasn’t enough. “He hung on, for a bit. ‘Bout three and a half seconds. I can…I could hear his scream echoing as he fell.”
And Sam turned, because he’d done the best he could, and time was running out and Steve was in danger, and he could do nothing about either those things but Stark could and
“Talk to people. Mingle. Someone your age.” The tone sounded more entreating than anything; it was almost touching. “Relics are all well and fine, but it’s the present that counts, yeah?”
A beep inaudible to all but superhuman ears had the king glancing down at his wrist cuff- that perhaps wasn’t just an ordinary wrist cuff after all, Steve should have learned by now that deceptive technology could be cloaked anywhere and in anything, if from no one else but T- no, no, bad topic. Redirect.
Tony swallows past his mouthful of bagel and chokes a little; Steph slaps him on the back with ridiculous force, eyes glimmering in amusement all the while. “Well?”
“You need to stop saying that.” Peter turned back to his little paper plate boasting a fajita tower of over six inches, easy. Hell, to have a metabolism like
Morning was fully upon them, the first rays of sunshine rendering Manhattan too bright to look at; glass towers and steel facades aglow with light. Though they were crouching partly in the shade of Avengers Tower, a small patch of yellow-gold had begun to make its away across the bridge of Steve’s nose, contrasting with the unfair brilliance of eyes that wouldn’t stop looking at him. Steve wouldn’t stop looking at him, and Tony spared a moment to wonder if Steve too had acquired fluency in Tony’s masks; just as the passing years had necessitated Tony’s ability to peer past Rogers-branded righteousness.
“I guessed, what with the delightful references to pre-existing games of our time in-taunt. You really should pay more attention to me.” Steve’s response to that was to nearly shove the iPhone up Tony’s nostril, which…no. All body cavity invasions were to be conducted by Stark products only. So he backed up an inch, and looked. Blank turquoise screen, underset by the same bright, peppy music. Lovely.
Steve looked at him. Seconds passed, long and slowly drawn out. His eyes seemed lost. “But it’s the good parts that hurt.”
– as though this was their regular banter and Tony was blabbering on for the hell of it. Which yes, he’d been guilty of in the past, but there was a qualitative – a
Tony was a…little taken back at the change of tack, admittedly. He hadn’t actually expected to get this far. He’d come out with it, though. He wasn’t ashamed. “It has been…brought to attention that my armours have a…significant flaw.” He looked straight at T’Challa, resolute and unswerving. “I was hoping to use the vibranium to create a suit absent of any such…weaknesses.”
He knocked into the ficus on his way to the elevator, unable to slow down even when dirt and ceramic smashed into polished tile.
In the search of a, what, pillow? that wasn’t there, his insensate fingers discovered a smooth, curving slope- a nice, rounded shape raised from the ground. He tugged it toward him, snow scraping to the side as it moved, and curled his body sideways to curve around the object. Right shoulder hitting the ground, his cheek came into contact with cold, unforgiving metal- polished to the smoothest of finishes. His thumb stroked across the surface under his head, but he couldn’t see the colours in the dark.
He felt his shoulders loosen, releasing the guilt of seventy years out into the thin, chilly air, and he let them fall back- let them hit the ground packed with snow and let his arms, unburdened by any weapon wave back and forth.
There was a dilapidated shelter just before the irrigation drain, on the far end of the field, barely more than four bamboo sticks entrenched in the mud with a pile of hay slopped atop with a prayer to high heaven. It was this structure that Tony made for, slow and inexorable. When he finally ducked his head and stepped through, the clamorous beat of rain against gold-titanium faded to a muted roar. He turned.
“Tell me something.” Tony said – and it wasn’t a long time in coming. It was timed just right. “If I wanted to kiss you right now, would you let me?”
Anyway, this really wasn’t supposed to be dragged out this long. One highly immature conversation featuring Wordsworth, whichever psychopath wrote nursery rhymes, and Chester Bennington. But apparently it’s only just the beginning, because when Tony drags himself out of the armchair he’d sacrificed his back to the next morning, there’s an actual piece of paper waiting for him on the coffee table. Paper, my my. Talk about museum artefacts.
“I do not know how much you care for yourself, Tony Stark- if at all.” A feather light touch, a king gripping his shoulder for a moment. Tony stared on, and T’Challa’s eyes looked back in something akin to kindness. “But as a fellow man, I say- Iron Man deserves to be alive. Him, and every drop of redemption he stands for.”
Well, that checked off ‘hurting the strongest person he knew’ from his bucket list. What else could he knock off today?
Eyes that were a few shades lighter, flicked over him head to foot, just as scrutinising as Tony’s own. Steve’s voice barely carried when he spoke, but his tone wasn’t unreadable, not really. “I’ve missed that armour.”
The red cape set dusts swirling anew as the Vision slowly descended from the air, feet coming into contact with the ground with a gentleness that belied the sheer power that the figure was holding in. Steve raised a finger to the patch behind his ear to deactivate the veil, met those cool, calm, distant eyes- wondering if the jaded maturity he could see in them now was his fault. Wondering if Vision still considered humanity worthwhile enough to be saved.
A strange prickling at the back of his neck interrupts his merry jumble of thoughts. Tony turns halfway and sees Steph standing there, wet towel slung around a sweaty neck, staring at the TV and looking thunderous. He’s about to interrupt with a quip on how he really hasn’t been processing the bullshit for the last ten minutes and she shouldn’t either because neither of them are trash compactors; which would have been a delightful segue way to Star Wars except Steph opens her mouth and-
, and Sam didn’t need the cover of light to read those eyes. Stark’s lip twitched derisively. “Rhodey was standing by his principles, not just by me. I could’ve turned tail and ran, picked another side…and he’d still be there. Falling to the ground, robbed of full use of his spine, fighting the good fight.”
Steve exhaled, breaking the eye contact between a breath and the next. Glanced up at the Tower, sunrise mirrored in his irises. “I always thought my faith was in people, not institutions.” The lines of his chin straight and golden-strong, words steady and unwavering. “But institutions are only as good as the people holding them up. Laws are only as good as the people holding them up.”
the words pre-planned and ready on his tongue, died on exit. For the better, perhaps. “Are you scared?”
Take Iron Man. Not many people decide to switch career paths to superheroing in their forties. It’s a regret that festers under his chest, quiet and painful, to this day. How different could things have been had he shaken off the haze of alcohol and untreated grief sooner? How many more lives could have been saved had Iron Man taken to the skies ten years before the Chitauri split it in half?
Back at the beginning, when he’d been dropping off the Tesseract at Camp Lehigh – he’d briefly considered it. Dropping off an envelope on Peggy’s desk with the coordinates of the Valkyrie, so that the other him could find… something. Maybe a happy ending, maybe just a chance. But all of time and its knowledge had been laid out before Steve, and he hadn’t resisted one extra indulgence.
But then their footsteps were slowing as they neared the inevitable destination, the suit whirring to a standstill. Their chins were lifting up as one, gazes settling on…on what would always be Avengers Tower, tall and gleaming in the light of dawn like not a day had passed since two thousand and twelve.
A last burst of exhaled air, though the amusement in this didn’t seem as pure. Steve’s mouth curved to the side briefly, something almost like resignation flashing in his features. “Nice talk, Stark.”
Steve looked up. Tony looked……he had a three-piece suit on, a recent look he’d picked up that he was now sporting everywhere(from his father, from his father, so that people would take him more se-) and perfectly groomed hair, and was walking through the throng of reporters alone. He had ‘fired’ Happy after that Extremis mishap, and Pepper was…..right, they weren’t. He had resources though. Surely he could employ someone to keep the media at a distance, stop them from clambering all over him, shoving mikes into his face. But Tony Stark didn’t even need that. He could project an aura that made you want to keep a ten-feet distance, fling out fast-flying jabs that would insult your dressing sense and your mental faculties and your purpose in life (but never family, because Tony would never be so crude) before you could blink thrice.
He could hear her pull a breath in, louder in her surprise. Some people thought they knew each other well enough to predict every movement. They knew each other well enough to still throw each other for a loop now and then, the way not many could, past the experienced spies’ eyes.
Blue eyes regarded him, calm and non-judgemental from the safety of a reflection. He’d evidently been mistaken.
Steve…hadn’t realised the absence of the pattering sound, the quiet on the roof. The air smelled musty, the silence loud enough to swallow him whole. He nodded.
, except to him the stars always look like they’re flashing feebly in a canvas of nothingness, dying out in sputters. And they are-it’s dead light that the humans on the face of the earth admire, dead light from gas giants that blew up millennia ago that gets written about in poetry. And still the stars try, flashing on in a vain attempt to catch attention while there are millions of them out there, too easy to mix up. They call famous people stars-which makes no sense, because a non-astronomer can’t tell Rigel from Betelguese. They’re all the same. Glowing spots hopelessly trying to light up a perennial darkness, no different from the billion other glowing spots. And they try and try to shine brighter and brighter…and boom. Nova.
The hold shifted from Steve’s neck to the back of shoulders that were almost insensate, another arm cupping around his waist – till Tony had hauled him right up, and pressed him close, dark hair brushing over the tip of Steve’s nose. His voice in Steve’s ear was barely above a whisper, barely a question. Maybe it wasn’t even meant for him. “Why.”
So Tony had finally been sent in, replete with UN sanctions, the fastest of the lot. The estimated danger was minimum, what with the David Copperfield vanishing act, but the Iron Legion was on standby in twenty minutes in case the situation went south. The location was a mere mile away at this point, and all readings approached normal, apart from a slight spike in methane which was probably produced by all the paddy–
Behind her glossy locks, Steve could see the diner fracturing – jagged shards of light cleaving through the vinyl booths, checkered floor, white tiling on the counters. His breath was shaking along with it, sucked clean out of his chest like an asthma attack of old, fingers digging into the table– “I never stopped loving you.”
The kettle whistles, Tony pads over to the stove – and for an instant, it’s as if a cloud passes and Steve is convinced this is a BARF memory. There by the corner, the real Tony stands with shoulders curled in – gaunt, emaciated, mouthing words.
“I can’t.” Peter exhaled in utter defeat, the sound of his chin clunking down on the wooden shelf clearly audible. That mop of hair more suited to the business end of a broomstick pulled itself out of the chests, the gangly frame almost plastering itself against the wall as he slid down to crumple on the bed that didn’t fit him.
Clint let pushed out a particularly long exhale, and leaned back till he could feel the familiar granite of his countertop digging into his vertebrae. Natasha dropped down on the wooden chair three metres diagonally across from him, immediately propping a foot on the coffee table. Clint twitched.
A small, almost soundless exhale. “During World War II, the New Guinea campaign was one of the major conflicts of interest between Japan and the Allies. Over two hundred thousand servicemen died-Japanese, Australian and American. Bled out over these sands.”
“Of course, of course.” Peter started nodding vociferously. But it was almost an impossibility stopping that train once it started going. “I still can’t believe I got to see the
It was a conscious, mammoth effort to pull his hand away from where it was clenched above his chest, rigid and shaking.
“Why, a leader took up the cause of course, as one always does.” Stark lowered his chin, stared at the light emanating strong and clear from his own chest. "We’ll call him…Captain America. He steps out of the annals of glorious history…looks around the world today, and he doesn’t like what he sees. The rampant destruction, the breaking of sovereign laws, the unchecked power, the sheer presumption and
Clint was…..scraping something off his arrows. The natural assumption would be that he was sharpening them- except his arrows were pre-customised and pre-designed and all other sorts of pre’s, with poison caps and electricity and heaven knows what else at the pointier end…..so sharpening them was kind of impossible and useless.
When they parted, Steve expelled his breath in a long, dragging, gratified sigh. Tony smiled. “Besides, I don’t know if I’ve ever shared this with you, Steven – but I don’t give up easy.”
Another blink, though it did nothing to fix whatever calamity had befallen Steve’s face in the brief seconds that Tony had been contemplating hostile takeovers. It was like someone had…switched off a light behind those eyes, blue sheen dulled where they had been alight with excitement not even a minute ago. His lips had thinned, his jaw tensed, and he kept blinking compulsively – like the world was blurring in front of him and this was the only way he had left to centre himself.
Sam could hear his breathing, in the quiet. Steady and unchanged, chest lifting and falling unimpededly. His heart was still running at above eighty beats a minute.
“We’re never going to get a better chance-the quakes would have thrown whatever operations are going on there in disarray too.” Rhodey wasn’t even looking at him. His jaw had been tight ever since they’d sat down. “You and…Vision can start the rescue efforts and I’ll-”
“Penny for your thoughts?” It had gotten easier to read amusement in those eyes, over the years. Or maybe she’d just gotten better at showing it.
Tony pitched to the right, rolling over on his side and out from underneath the car; just as the Iron Man hauled the Ferrari up into the air by its trunk, front wheels barely keeping contact with the ground. Repulsors shot out the other glove, smoking a black patch onto the floor where Tony had just been.
“Atta boy.” Rhodey pronounced sarcastically. His fingers outstretched for an eraser lying just beyond the pad, shoulder straining and back stiff and unbent. Tony bumped it over with a brush of his elbow, and Rhodey’s chin dipped in wordless thanks. “ ‘Sides, if you’re itching at the balls to design this much, you shouldn’t have dropped all those military contracts, hmm?”
“Yes.” Steve responded firmly. His hands were folded behind his back as if at military rest, his spine straightened. His eyes were bleak. “Howard might have been carrying something of value, or he’d become too much of a thorn in Hydra’s side, I don’t know. But the night of the accident…it wasn’t an accident. They made h- Bucky did it.”
He could feel nothing- not his scored knees from being dragged repeatedly across the deathly cold concrete floor, not his bruised shoulder blades from being smashed against the wall, not the thick, blackened blood seeping thin and constant from his nostrils, not the repulsor scorch marks over his twisted ribs.
Next to him though, Steph seems to be taking the interruption of her bagel meal very seriously. In fact…wait, are her teeth grinding?
That, and the ridiculously neat handwriting on the page announces that it’s the doing of the only other museum artefact residing in this Tower. Tony takes a glance down at the words, reads
, his brush strayed towards the red tube of paint. A dab here and a highlight there, and it was like the painting became a new creature – vivid and kinetic, the richness of the hue enhancing the brighter shades of yellow and orange, adding depth into the darkness of browns and blacks. It was always on his palette, he couldn’t imagine picturing a world without…
And Tony closed his eyes, teeth threatening to splinter apart because of how tight he was clenching his jaw- furious, towering rage the only thing that little exercise inspired.
“I doubt it.” Peter scoffed, and then his eyes widened again, “NO, I mean, I didn’t mean to mean you didn’t mean it, it’s just that you’re Tony
(Two scenes, playing in symphony behind his eyelids. Captain America and the Winter Soldier dueling it out on the ramparts of a falling Helicarrier; him and Nat throwing desperate blows within the bowels of another one, the entire memory filtered through a cool wash of blue.)
knew what should be the central piece of the not-a-vanity-project-what-are-you-talking-about exhibit. Tony walked up to the base of the Mark VII, mysterious clanging noise partly forgotten, neck craned up to admire the cardinal red finish of the chestplate. One of his favourite pictures ever of himself was in this suit. Some stupid, enterprising citizen journalist had snapped a shot of the Avengers standing all together, gazes raised to the Chitauri descending from the sky… it was front page on a lot of papers the next day. Figures, that the world would focus on that instead of the first-ever undeniable proof of the existence of hostile aliens. But it was a nice picture.
“So he let us go.” Clint said, flatly. “Doesn’t change the fact that we shouldn’t have been there in the first place. In fact,” And there was a step forward here, Clint’s shoulders straightening and pulling back, eyes as flashing and condemnatory as they’d ever been. “There were a great many things that happened that
Tony succumbed – walking back over to the chair Rhodey hadn’t moved from and propping his arms on the wooden back, chin sinking into the warm divot between Rhodey’s nape and shoulder. Snuffled into the cotton of his shirt a little, nose full of citrus fabric softener, and eyes fluttering open to peer at the airplane design from this vantage. Tony’s words were mumbled, lips puffing moist breath against the warm, cotton-covered skin. “We’ve done pretty well for ourselves, haven’t we?”
Completely exposed, Tony lifted his chin and stared up at the Iron Man, barely able to hear his own words over the ringing in his ears. “You owe me over six-fifty grand.”
Steve smiled back, a wondrous little curve of his lips, like it was a reflex utterly out of his control. “And an amazing speech."
Rhodey’s lips curved, soft and faintly preoccupied. “Pretty sure the protectiveness is over the squishy Bruce-human, but yeah.”
He stretched his neck from side to side, a yawn of enormous proportions cracking through his jaw. Most of the screens and holograms had powered down, leaving behind a quiet that took the creaking of the creeper under his weight and the clink of his spanner as it hit the drawer and returned them back in echoes. Most of the downlights were still on – powerful beams that lit up the workshop in sharp, symmetrical lines, shadows in between.
“And you’re a pre-pubescent arachnid.” Tony said, or something else idiotic along those lines because there was laughter after that- laughter and banter and smiles- real ones- and lots, and lots of messing around with doodads.
Tony leaned closer before he was even fully aware, eyes sharpening in growing pique. “I’m guessing you didn’t add the bright orange dots just for the pretty.”
“Forty two to forty five. Right during your rise to prominence, actually.” Tom smiled again, tiredness creeping over the expression. “We were legally a British possession till forty nine, only established independence from Australia in seventy five. We still have close ties to them, though.” And the smile waned again. “Largest aid donor to the country.”
Tony breathed. Strange, how sentiments he’d fundamentally disagreed with, words that had set his teeth on edge and his blood to boiling, now coloured by real, fallible
“That’s alright.” Soothing. The voice was so soothing. Hell, he’d missed JARVIS. Why had he gone away again? “Your GPS locator is on. I can track you. I’ll be with you shortly.”
“There are still over twenty seven counts of murder alone on the Soldier, all almost certainly confirmed. This doesn’t really change much for your friend.” T’Challa spoke, something almost like caution tinging his tone.
“And while we’re on a streak-” The words exited almost in a garble, and Sam twisted his head back, to where Stark was staring fixedly at some point in the dark, or maybe just the entirety of it. But he raised his head, and his gaze found its mark. “Tell Barton to go back home.”
It was...bizarre, how effortlessly the atmosphere between them could turn to the light-hearted bickering of the distant past if he so chose; or just as easily go the other way, recent histories fraught with blunt words and twisting hurt
“Not sure if they still keep you in the know, but I tend to do the calling these days.” The swagger was nowhere near Stark levels, but unmistakeably present. It was brilliant.
“Besides. Hadn’t you devised a method to synthesise it anyway?” T’Challa steepled his fingers over his chin- Tony hadn’t realised that was an actual thing people did before this moment. “Or is that just a myth your people made up to conflate your status even further?”
he sees her mouth to herself, then her lips flicker and fall still. Her eyes keep roving, and he follows them.
Steve raised his eyes from his foamy palms, blue irises flicking over to settle on Tony’s face. Tony’s lip curled upwards challengingly. “Millions of traits, and not a single common one between you and I? Mathematically impossible, I refuse to believe it.”
“Remember to turn the flash off, the museum exhibits don’t like that. Or the guards.” Sam reminded him, oh-so-helpfully. “Got told off for it in front of a bunch of school kids once, it was pretty humiliating.”
And Steve’s shoulders pulled back a little at that because- well, there was obviously something wrong, but he hadn’t
Tony’s eyes narrowed, even as he proceeded to lick up the grease lingering around his fingernails. “I didn’t hear of it.”
Because every time they died in some ludicrous way and Tony would shake his shoulders out subtly, preparing to get his ass off the couch – Steve would chortle a little, prod at the screen and start it all over
“See,” someone said, and it took a few seconds to register that it was him. “We have things in common after all.”
Tony stared and stared, the injured muscle under his scarred chest dully thudding away. A blankness overtook memory-Tony’s face, all mirth and intimations of closeness wiped from his features in a flat second. It wasn’t even the fact of the words being said- though it was, oh it was. It was also the words in themselves, the way they had been phrased. No introductions, no justifications. No prevarications. No
He lurched to his feet, knees unsteady, and made for the nearest suit in a stumbling run. Knowing that the armour would not give chase – why bother if you had missiles to fire and an automated targeting system?
“Tony didn’t do that.” No thought preceded the words; the response was automatic, and far more assertive than Steve had been so far. It just…..it was an undeniable fact, to him. Not subject to discussion. “The General did. And just because he wasn’t behind bars, doesn’t mean he was any less of a prisoner. Besides,” And he had to soothe here, had to get more reasonable- Clint had believed he was going to be living with his family for good, being denied of that had to hurt, Steve had to understand- “I’d never have been able to spring you guys from an underwater max prison if Tony Stark really was in charge of keeping you there. Not with the resources I had.”
scrawled across the espresso machine in ant-like letters. Bruce too, casually hanging by the counter with his chamomile tea in hand, which is such a sham because Bruce never casually does anything.
Steve turned on his heels swiftly and made for the ceramic washbasins on the opposite wall, but Tony was too quick for him. One step in, and Tony had already cut him off, shoes sliding across the tile as smoothly as if it were a dancefloor, slick with…actually, Tony shouldn’t dedicate too much thought to what the public washroom floor was slick with. Especially with Captain America standing three inches away from him. Was aroused disgust even supposed to be a thing?
“Astute observation, FRIDAY.” Tony flipped the omelette, then squinted at it from one side. Then the other. Yellow-brown. That….was probably good.
“Hold on, kid.” Tony stopped him right there, scrappy heart muscle under bruised skin twisting nastily under his rib-cage. “Let’s hold off on the sap and the tearful promises, alright?”
“I brought presents!” The declamations started the second he stepped through the threshold, obviously. Rhodey had forbidden the use of Suits, capital S, within the Facility unless for training sessions or self-defence, so words were as flashy an entrance as Tony was going to get and he would make the most of it. “It’s two weeks before Halloween and not Christmas, even though I’m wearing red-and-white, which is marvellously subversive of me…”
The rain had gotten into his eyes. Tony could feel it – creeping hot and stinging past his lids, clotting his lashes and wrenching loose: a funerary crawl over the aged landscape of his cheeks. Like every trail carved new lines, new scars and canyons for a face ravaged by the decades. The rain had gotten into his eyes, even though he stood motionless under dank heather, even as he blinked – shielded, by a hero’s helmet.
The words were coming slowly, shaped by Tony’s inadequate voice with as much significance, as much unadulterated earnestness as they deserved. “He says, ‘We share things in common, but… it’s more that it already feels like we’re a team, me and her. We don’t always get each other, but we listen. We always listen. We have our fights, but we try to communicate
“Lhasa, last I heard.” Rhodey scrunched up his eyes, peering at the pad over a flared nose because of course that was a foolproof way to improve one’s eyesight and ability to spot design errors. “And it’s been four hundred and sixteen days since the last code green, so you might wanna find a new, soft-and-squishy-human nickname.”
, he was probably arthritic, or something. Old people got arthritis, right? Osteoporosis, or maybe that was just for old women. Everything-in-your-body-is-breaking-down-isis, yeah that seemed about right. Even his brain, because he stupidly clutched at the arm of his chair while he was getting up and it wheeled to the side under the pressure, sending him staggering in the same direction. Another step, and something stabbed at the heel of his bare foot- probably a stray bit of ceramic from one of the broken mugs. He contemplated raising his foot to check if it was bleeding, but nah. Sleep deprivation wasn’t great for balance, and it was barely a sting compared to the rest of his achy body anyway, so it could join the freaking line.
Must be strange. To have your pots and pans, the ones you brewed broth and chicken soup in, spooning mouthfuls into your sick son’s throat, on display like this hundreds of years later. For strangers to stare at, and imagine what it was like. Leave smudges from their fingers on glass, never touch. Forever separated. Because they couldn’t imagine, could they?
“But you know me. You know me and you know this toast isn’t getting any better from here on out, yet you’re standing there anyway all happy ears instead of booing me off. And that’s…that’s pretty special.” From the corner of his eye, Tony could see Peter quietly creep up to where MJ stood, cufflinks catching the light again as he scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. Could see MJ’s arched eyebrow, the little quirk to her lips as her fingers slipped into the crook of her husband’s elbow. Tony smiled. “And I guess that’s what we’re all here to celebrate. Something special.”
Once, twice, thrice. Three eardrum-piercing clangs and Tony staggered back by several feet, legs somehow still standing. Back slumped, shoulder pulling back, arm tensing-he let the shield fly for a last time, vibranium slipping out of sweat-stained fingers.
“Look kid.” Peter shrunk a little more into himself at the ‘kid’. Tony bit into his tongue. “I know you think I’m a…I don’t know
Tony didn’t stand around to hear the end of that sentence, barely looking sideways at Peter as he ducked out of the doorway. It was less of a hall and more of a narrow corridor, crowded walls and a grey cement floor echoing hollowly under his feet as he crossed its length in three strides and put a hand out to tug open the door at the end. It resisted him, ill-fitted in its frame and refusing to give way, and Tony could distantly feel a growing pressure in his jaw, teeth pressing hard enough to splinter. The doorknob slid in and out of his clammy grasp; and Tony had to stop himself from biting his tongue through in a suffocating surge of emotion too sharp to be frustration.
Not acrylic or oils, heavily wielded – but something softer, like swathes of water colour splashed across the canvas of the heavens. That strange shade that dwelt between pastel pinks and blues, freely flowing from one to the other – the colour of daybreak, fresh and clean.
Peter grabbed at the first glass that floated by on a server’s tray and shoved it into Tony’s hands. His fingers curled around the glass stem on autopilot – ooh, Dr Pepper – even as he stumbled a few steps ahead, being not-so-gently-nudged at the back by a
“It’s uhm, a night…” Steve’s concentration was taken up by the looming sign over the first floor exhibit-blocky, yet elegant black text on white walls proclaiming
“I just…I want the old times back.” Steve had never thought, in all the days that he’d been awake, that the ‘old times’ could mean anything within this spanking, brand-new century. But he wasn’t thinking of anything else in this moment. “Shawarma, and aliens, and all the rest. I want to be on a team of heroes, and be worthy of being carried around on trading cards in a good man’s pocket.  I want to be on the side of
A split-second of silence. When Iron Man’s voice came, it was interrupted by bursts of static; like the voice behind the emotionless recording was panting harshly.
Oh, who the fuck was he kidding. Steve stared, eyes wide awake, at the bright screen of his phone that had somehow migrated into his hand during this little, delightful diversion of his thoughts.
Maybe it wasn’t the injuries making his head feel scrambled through, turned inside out and reeling. It was like the shudders had started deep beneath the ground a long time ago, tectonic quakes that had somehow travelled into his body and made a home. He felt shaken up from the inside. Cracks running through the foundations, everything ill-fitting and displaced.
Tony exhaled. Waited for the tightness at the base of his throat to pass, before the words crept past his lips, quiet and steadying. “I wouldn’t have pictured you doing this…not twenty years ago.”
“You know me Rogers, forever the contrarian.” The flippancy, the distracting jovial tone was all there, all the requisite ingredients, but there was still something off. Tony’s voice was stiff, like an actor repeating his memorised lines for a play with none of the conviction, none of the belief. Stiff, and unconvincing. “Figured, if a supervillain wanted you to do something really, really badly, it only made sense not to do it, right?”
bottle of water. She walks over to the counter, and actually groans out loud. Because Tony needs that kind of imagery.
much louder than his usual volume, but it was like a ripple effect: the clusters of people around him immediately quietened down, and forty seconds in, Tony was counting, the entire hall was hushed and staring at him. It was scary, almost. Humbling.
the description said), made using an ancient technique inlaying precious jems into jade or metal. Recesses had apparently been drilled into the jade, and the gems inset, held in place by bands of gold. Wearing such a ring was a mark of a skilled warrior.
thrummed through the air, the EXO wings unfolding from his shoulders and drawing up high. Sam moved them-two harsh beats, slicing through the air-and the wind was alive with sand, hard and abrasive. It settled a minute later, gradually drifting to rest on the gravelly beach-and revealed a set of cemented steps, trailing downward into the ground, end unseen and buried under sand.
And Tony broke it, not just because he was Tony fucking Stark. “This doesn’t mean we need to hook up.”
Another mirthless smile, fringed by darkness, there and gone before its cause could be investigated. “I suppose so.”
When he’d blinked the spots out of his eyes, the diner seemed faded – though still bathed in coloured light. Peggy had stopped smiling, though her eyes were still kind. “I wasn’t alone.”
Steve tucked his fingers in his pockets, thumbs hooking into the riveted belt loops. It felt good to walk again after keeping still for so long.
,” And Tony’s eyes flashed again, hard and brittle and so recklessly vulnerable, “Is that you are fighting for the right of superheroes to be right all the fucking time. Which may be fine when you’re Captain America, but sure as hell doesn’t work out for the superheroic fuck-up Iron Man.”
“But you said it might be a matter for the Panther.” Now, of a sudden, it was like he had too many words- clumsy, ill-forged ones, but they still weren’t the ones he needed. “Are you…are you going to fight with him?”
It stays-the remnants of that smile, lingering around the lines of his mouth as he gets to work on the fine motor control of his new gauntlets. It lingers in the humming he indulges himself in, cocking his head from side to side, an old melody that isn’t Metallica and he can’t remember the source of. Stephanie lingers too-he can spot her tall frame huddled over the sketchbook in her lap, camped out over on the couch he usually crashes at, brows furrowed in concentration. He sees her startle in the corner of his vision when he starts humming, but then something in those shoulders loosen and she’s scribbling away at her pages, graphite overlaying marker ink on those long fingers.

He was staring at some indiscriminate spot on the floor, face wiped, harsh LED backlighting his head and casting shadows on his hands. He was blinking every three or so seconds- and some distant, mindless part of Steve noted that it was almost odd to see his face in shadow (
“I have the shield.” Tony said. His chest hurt. “I want to throw it away, but Howard wouldn’t have liked it.”
to move her eyes from Tony’s face, which is a complication because he can feel the heat building up in his face like fucking magma before an impending volcanic eruption-and fuck his mind and his bloody scientific metaphors, this is how he got here in the first place. Being swept off his feet by poetry from bloody
“Oh, this isn’t UN data.” Rhodey said, light as ever, and with a snap of the fingers the orange dots disappeared, leaving the map of the islands behind. “

things, and elevons are one, and two things are more than one thing and more things lead to more drag–
The paper crinkled between his fingers. Crease marks ran along the crumpled surface indiscriminately- lines as fine and spindly as spider webs, spanning the careful, neatly inked words on the page. The paper looked years old, stained yellow by exposure. It wasn’t. It would be completing six months today.
The kind that made him move constantly and without purpose, against restraints that weren’t physical, that made him create noise in silence. Energy pushed inwards, reverbing uselessly, without direction or drive. The kind that made best friends of fear and hope, playing hide and seek in a stoic jaw and unseeing eyes.
“Har de har har.” Tony’s lips did flicker into something genuine for a second though. Goddamn it, this was why he was so insistent. Moments like these that convinced him that he and the good Captain could do better,
“I…I don’t quite know, J.” His voice had never sounded this hoarse. Had it? Maybe Afghanistan. Fuck, he hated deserts. “I had memorised the coordinates, but the suit’s dead and I can’t seem to remember them right now.”
He’ll explain, he’ll explain it all later because…because now his hands finally tighten over her shoulders and he kisses her, and the breath leaves her chest in a hitch and they’re pulling closer and twisting tighter, tongues flickering out and her hand like a brand over the back of his neck. Deeper and deeper, while the memory of drowning flickers at the back of his mind like something he can never really leave behind.
“Ex-teammates.” Ross produced his smile again. Punching it off was sounding better and better by the minute. “And I’d remind you that said jerk kept your ass out of jail.”
(Clint could still feel the creak of his bow pushing down on the tendons of her neck, so much stronger than they seemed. So much frailer than she wanted them to be.)
He rolled his shoulders back, luxuriating in the stretch of the muscles. Wriggled in place a little, till the mattress depressed even further – eyes blissfully closed, as they would rightly remain.
“Mathematically,” Tony announced, sliding into the urinal as easy as you’d please, “it should be impossible.”
It was almost easy to miss, in the recorded echoes of a fight that he’d never forget and the slurry of memories whirling through his head, punctured by shards of pain. But it registered in his mind- he heard the whirr and moved his gaze from his best friend’s face to Iron Man’s visage. The two small, rectangular flaps on his shoulders had withdrawn, risen. The strategist in Steve, the Captain America part of him that had fought alongside Iron Man for years- dimly registered that those compartments stored the mini-missiles that Iron Man was equipped with. He’d used them to great efficiency in the past- usually against Chitauri or Ultron bots or other opponents that couldn’t merely be incapacitated.
“And yes, I’m coming for the goddamned anniversary dinner.” Rhodey huffed, perhaps a touch more dramatically than was called for, in Tony’s esteemed opinion. “We’re not living in the times of her majesty Queen Victoria and you do
Steve exhaled, light and amused, and it was almost surreal to think that it was coming from the same source as all those aggravated sighs. He turned to face the mirrors, motion efficient and soundless for all that muscled weight, blue eyes dipping down before rising to affix on his reflection. Tony watched them in the glass too.
“Stark, on the other hand, is basically every Linkin Park lyric ever written.” Tony takes all his sympathy back. And besides, who
“About…about Zemo.” Tony turned his eyes away for the first time all conversation, gaze flitting from one background object to the next. “How do you.” He stopped, then started again, T’Challa watching him with impassive eyes all the way. He forced it out. “How did you forgive him?”
“Stark.” Tony smiled, a swift bursting sunrise. Steve could feel his heart twist desperately under his rib cage, one last protest before defeat.
“Not with what they did, I don’t.” Rhodey replied, with nary a pause. Like it was that simple. That easy. To choose never to forgive, and expect the grand machinations of the world to let him keep to that choice.
“Where I’d want to be buried?” She summarises bluntly. It’s like a wound getting cauterised – relief and pain making everything insensate.
Steve lifted his eyes, from where he’d been absentmindedly twisting the beer can cover’s metal thingy into freakish shapes, and directed an unimpressed look at Sam. The phone kept buzzing half-heartedly on the table, face down on a sticky surface that had seen god knows how many spilled fluids.
Her eyelids rose, red lashes turning gold in the light. Her eyes were colourless. “You blame me for something.”
Notes: there are some topics raised in this chapter that are potentially sensitive, and neither the characters I write, nor I claim to be the best people to write about them, but we're doing our best. Do contact me if you think I could have handled something better, but I'm also making no apologies for what's up. Factual details therein have been researched, tell me if I got any of those wrong.
Steve moved at the corner of his vision again; Sam twitched. It wasn’t a fidgety kind of motion-not really. The Army stamped that out of you in mere weeks. But Steve was still...moving, the leather of his gloves creaking out of sight with every flexing motion of his knuckles. Nothing about those motions: running his palms down the Kevlar weave stretching over his thighs, undoing the Velcro of his gloves before pulling it down even tighter, adjusting the straps straining over his uniform…none of it was overtly fretful, or even restless. It could just as well be a man doing cursory checks before swinging down into a potentially hazardous situation.
He finally looks up. Steph looks more desperately, obstinately uncomfortable than all ‘Star-Spangled Man’ reels put together. It helps him speak.
The church looked like a blast zone. It appeared to be the only part of the city untouched by repairing hands, stained by the lingering, contaminating presence of Ultron- but little flags had started coming up around the entryway steps too, areas beginning to be marked off by tape- as if determined not to leave any part of the land unhealed.
His head hit the floor and Tony stared up at the ceiling, breath gurgling for long, long moments. Everything felt wet. Then there was red-and-gold in his sightlines – oh he’d wanted to tinker tonight.
The last time Tony had indulged in Mexican, he’d been toilet-ridden with gastro for over a week. “Last time MJ misheard you and now she keeps threatening to weld my ass shut.”
Natasha helped, with that sort of thing. For someone who slipped skins on and off so easily- she was more aware than most, of the….things, about a person, that didn’t change. Never changed. Immutable. That a person couldn’t simply will themselves to perfection, no matter how desperately hard they tried. Letting the monster breathe, she called it. Said if you sealed it up too tight, cracks would appear on the surface- and it would come bursting out, wild and desperate and ugly, imploding at the worst of moments.
Steve closed his eyes. Useless really, to wonder for the umpteenth time how Sam managed to do it. Know to give, exactly when the need was most dire. “…yeah.”
Behind, the Ferrari crashed back to the concrete as if tossed aside, windows shattering with the impact and raining glass; a death-screech of sound that would never make it out of here.
“FRIDAY?” The sleep dissipated from his eyes with every passing second of silence, unease squirming to life at the pit of his stomach. This was highly unusual. “Respond – passphrase seven-seven-mariner-earendil-six.”
Rhodey tilted his head to the right, bopping the side of Tony’s forehead with his own, almost absent minded. “Yeah. Yeah, we have.”
I'm definitely writing at least a second part- though I might extend the series further if the response is nice. Comment if you liked?
Sound was beginning to filter into his world again-there were scattered groups of people on the ground floor, and the distant roar of the crowd outside. “I’m going outside now. Talk to you later?”
Even Christmas. Clint snags a thumbnail under the wrapping paper and peels it open from the middle; lifts the box set of
“As much as I appreciate you taking your leadership pointers from LinkedIn,” Tony felt his lips relax into a smile, inadvertently gentle. “It’s really not you, and it’s most definitely me.”
But then Bucky was releasing a desperate snarl and pinning Iron Man against the stone wall, fingers straining to pull out the reactor- and Steve leaned forward in spite of himself, knuckles whitened, a phantom sense of panic and worry and pain and displaced warmth swimming in his chest. God,
At the periphery of his vision, he could see Steve pull wet strands back from his forehead; colourless droplets snaking down uncaring fingers. A bug crawled across the rim of his collar – his fingers stilled, then dropped down to his side without flicking the critter away. The critter crawled on.
He had to unlatch his gauntlet- powered down as it was, it would only mess with his grip. The shield was cold to the touch- burning, almost. Poisonous. Scalding the flesh of the unworthy.
Steve could not move his fingers. They twitched a little, but stayed firmly wrapped around, entwined through the scratched-up, faded metal fingers of an Iron Man gauntlet.
The screen panned over the smooth, polished exteriors of the Avengers facility- Tony’s mind whirred. Not many people had access to his data framework…okay, fine. Not many people
It was…..it was a strong word. Betrayal. Not one that he’d ever have imagined applying to himself. There weren’t many things in life he was proud of- but his moral compass had always held him in good stead. Considering he hadn’t really changed his mind on the things that had driven him to make a stand in the first place- the word couldn’t quite fit. Not really.
Another pause in response. “Breath patterns indicate Colonel Rhodes has left REM quite a long time ago, although his eyelids are closed.”
Tom grasped his left arm and pulled, Steve let him. His head reeled a little with the added height, world blurring; his weight coming to rest across a broad shoulder, Tom losing his breath with a quiet ‘oof’. Two seconds of simultaneous breathing, and then they stepped forward, staggering to the door step by cautious step.
with enough flexibility to make it through narrow passages. The Bleeding Edge interface wasn’t anywhere near ready… “Or was it just to make me jealous over what I can’t have? Because you know your existence is enough pooh bear-”
The light seeping through the windows caught in his eyes, near-blinding. Steve raised a hand to shield them – was the sun setting? “Must’ve been hard for you to go through that all alone, after the war. Don’t know how you managed it.”
It was almost easy to understand Steve’s behaviour on the plane, after this. Who could sit still, after words lit an itch in your bloodstream and guilt a pit in your stomach and there was absolutely nothing that you could do?
the point: the axis around which everything else revolves, the destination at the end of a long, tumultuous journey. Realisation, confession, resolution. Happy ending. That’s how it goes. And love
“Anger is a futile emotion.” Long way from knowing that, and actually putting it to practice though. “I’m asking you to tell me where you think I went wrong, so I can do better.”
“Well then.” Natasha tilted her head one last time, light gleaming off the devastating line of her jaw, eyes teasing like he’d remember her best. “What’re you waiting for?”
Except the one right at the end. The man’s lips curved over his immaculate goatee, but into something more akin to a smirk than a smile. He was…off, in other ways too. Unlike the rest of his troupe members, his dark trousers tapered down instead of flaring into wide pleats, hugging his calves with every movement, fitted hems shaking free of his ankles with every sharp kick. His shoes were glossy, heeled. His black suspenders stretched over a bright red shirt-did the man do his research at all? No one
“Gallivanting…working her ass off…such synonymous phrases, really.” Rhodey smiled, sarcasm doled out in perfectly measured helpings. “Not like she isn’t the second highest ranked officer in the Nova Corps and has a
And Tony’s eyes flew open, to see the King looking straight back at him. “I realised,” T’Challa said, cold and enunciated. “That by killing Zemo, I was killing two people. Him, and me. I was killing the legacy that my father was leaving behind- of grace, and control, and justice. The Black Panther stands for bigger things than vengeance.”
Steve opted for a photostatic veil this time round- Clint had a couple on him even as they’d fled, and the face morphers had proved invaluable so far in keeping the authorities off their tail. Steve ordinarily hated it- the nanoparticles of the mask shifting around his skin, the all too blatant fakeness of it jarring to the very essence of the way he operated. But here, amidst the ruins of a city and her people that had been wronged so heavily by the Avengers, a baseball cap simply wasn’t going to cut it.
there at the desolate Siberian bunker while Steve brought down the shield on the arc- and felt a wave of alarm strong enough to never contemplate the idea ever again.)
“Seems a little hypocritical, I know.” There was a rueful twist to Tom’s mouth, his large hands coming up to settle peacefully against his thighs. “But when people aren’t fighting over our lands, or building prisons on them…the biggest challenge we face is the rising waters. The warming airs, the melting ice and higher waves. Five islands have been lost to the Pacific, so far.” The words that followed were serious, somehow like only a joke could be. “His suit may be shiny, but he revolutionised clean energy. And I appreciated that.”
“I know.” Nothing hoarse about that tone. Just quiet – quiet enough that Tony could barely see Steve’s lips move. His eyes looked pallid in this lighting, washed out against this world of green and brown and grey.
So it made sense that the recordings would always begin at some point during their confrontation in the bunker, without exception. It appeared as though Tony was focusing on trying to…correct just this event in time, instead of trying to reach back further and course-correct….because how far could they go, really? The first time the Accords came up? That day on Clint’s farm? Their first meeting, when Howard’s friend Steve Rogers told his son that he’d known men worth ten of him and he’d never be a hero? Hell, Steve had been fucking up Tony’s life long before the man had even been born. His plane had plummeted into the Arctic, and with it had plummeted any likelihood of a decent childhood for the Stark. Of course, there were others (
Tony tapped his index finger to his thumb, once to recall the last screen, once more to blow it up. R&D, Ross, Ross, another U.S. Brigadier General, the legal team that represented S.I., Ross, and then…there.
? Okay, two flights, but still. He dragged his feet up the last couple and leaned sideways on the wall to catch his breath, stitch in his side burning fiercely. A few controlled exhales and he pushed himself straight, sweat-sodden sleeve leaving a streak on the wall as he inched forward, automatic doors to the main floor sliding open with a swish.
Tony could feel the pressure between his teeth, at the back of his jaw – hard enough to splinter. “The pact was, only during an emergen–”
Everybody was slowly tramping off the stage, fishing out handkerchiefs to mop the sweat across their brows, rolling their shoulders and flexing their legs experimentally. Except-and Steve’s heart liberated itself in a tiny leap-Tony was climbing the stairs back up again, a stack of little green cards peeking out from his left fist. He was-oh
Nevertheless, Peter Parker remained a sneaky bastard who wouldn’t answer a straight accusation. Instead, his thin brows went winging to his hairline, eyes flitting up and down Tony’s frame dubiously. “You look…shiny.”
, Tony continued silently within his head. “They’re rerouted and sent off to any number of the Pacific Islands, where they’re usually hosted in detention centres.”
Natasha gave a brief shake of her head. Her eyes had dropped to the linoleum tiles, scoping something in the cracks where one slab fit into the other. “Before, in the helicarrier.”
…and just like that, his heart rate skyrocketed, the poor organ slamming into his ribcage so hard that Steve couldn’t breathe. He turned, slowly.
Natasha raised her head, pixie-short hair curling under her earlobes. She’d left the grey at her temples untouched. “It was time.”
The letter looked different in the dim, incandescent light of Peter Parker’s bathroom. The motions were practiced now, muscle memory; a flick of the thumb unfolding the page from quarters to halves, a turn of the wrist opening it up completely, then smoothening the creases out. Presbyopia was creeping up on his eyes and the words were closer to blurred smudges, but his mind remembered too.
That…that flicker of an expression could almost be called a smile. “If you remember, Mr Rogers, I fought
It was still a jolt to the brain, a brief shot of cognitive dissonance on watching him turn – that square jaw, more well-shaved than baby-smooth, a head of hair that had truly outgrown its teenaged-mop phase, the black lines of a suit that
That was a stupidly long hiatus, I do apologise XP But to make up for it...extra long chapter! Woo! I'm also starting to realise that the meat of the plot of this story is going to take some time to get rolling, and we're going to have a lot of Avengers talking and communicating in the meantime. Because they desperately need to do it, and I am happy to provide. And because rebuilding trust is a tag XP
“This isn’t a slap dash job.” Light knocking, like metal fingers over glass. Iron Man tapped at the far wall one more time, then prised it to the side-it was a sliding door. Stepped through: Sam could hear boots striking the ceramic of tiles. A lab then, maybe. “I can’t find any ports, forget actual systems and hardware that I can hack into for information. No cabinets with physical records to ransack. There isn’t even a single piece of furniture in this place.”
Until a finger prodded him in the side, scientifically engineered, Tony was certain, to be extra poky. “You know you’ll whinge about it later.”
“Right, so. I’d have kept you guys waiting, but a certain spider-themed superhero isn’t feeling very heroic right now – so here I am, delaying impending doom with a toast.” Tony lifted his glass a bit recklessly to a now-still MJ, halted in her warpath about twenty metres away. She was smiling though, so maybe homicide wasn’t on the horizon. “To be honest, I’m getting a Terminator-esqe ‘I’m gonna be slaying twenty minutes in the future anyhow’ vibe from his lovely spouse, so this may all have been in vain.”
They inched through, mission by mission, chapter by chapter-reports and assassinations, blood and words. They would only complete the book two years later: Clint bleeding out in Belmopan, Natasha reading to pass the time until help came. Her reading was as steady as ever, even as he cradled his head on her folded legs and stared upside down, watching her chin move senselessly for hours altogether. He didn’t register when foreign hands pulled him away, damp hair on the back of his skull leaving the warm patch on her skin. Didn’t recall the sheer agony of being pulled out on the stretcher, dosed to the gills while the jet buzzed under him, only to be cut open even wider than he was and sewn back shut hours later.
Recited like it had happened just yesterday, because it may as well have. Because everything may as well have. Oh god.
“I can only apologise for my actions, Tony.” And his voice was quiet, but unrelenting. “Not my beliefs.”
He’d been here all night. Here through the ebb and flow of the crowds, the street filling to choking capacity at one am, drunken youth hollering at the band to ‘play their song’, and when it emptied to desolation at four, nothing but silence and tapping feet and the jazz tunes, still tripping along, to keep him company. His ass had gone numb a good while back, but his back still felt alright, courtesy of the serum.
Tony’s eyebrows had been climbing progressively to his hairline the longer the seconds passed without a reply-once it actually hit the air, his lips turned up into a now-familiar curl of amusement. Oh god oh god, his mouth was doing that because of
Sam moved, not thinking of traps that were too easily set, his booted feet sinking into the scratchy sand. And they kept sinking-his left foot was plunging deeper than the right, coarse granules piling to the level of his ankle, till his heel hit something hard and flat and solid. Something sparked off at the back of his brain, and Sam pushed his right foot forward-and it sunk even deeper, sand brimming up to mid-calf before his heel found something hard and load-bearing again.
A pause. “Would you not like to have a look yourself?” FRIDAY enquired, hesitation lacing the words.
to them?” Clint bit into his lower lip and released a scoffing laugh, eyes bright. “And this from the man who wouldn’t stop harping about his teammates keeping secrets from him during Sokovia.”
He’s curled on the couch, apostrophe-like; dry-mouthed but breathing slower against Tony’s denim-covered thigh. Tony drags blunt nails over his scalp, quietly humming under his own breath.
to boot. The latter didn’t make much sense to him (though in his less deprecatory moments, he thought it didn’t make much sense to anyone else either).
was the blaring headline, and grainy, shaky mobile cam footage was playing onscreen, of what looked like Tony Stark walking down a regular street.
of the tech, though Tony wouldn’t be able to tell you the difference between those two things if he tried). Helen Cho was still overseeing tests on the tech to see if it was safe for prolonged use, it was technically still in beta. Vision…Vision was an option, but whether the workings of his head bore any similarity whatsoever with the human prefrontal cortex was entirely up in the air.
“No.” It was funny really, how easy it was to let feigned humour slip away. Tony didn’t even blink. Didn’t think. It didn’t need thought. “No.”
Sam caught that pause. Stark probably loathed the life out of that pause. It was why he was turning around, striding away and ducking under the doorway towards the next room. Sam didn’t bother following, voice calling out at the disappearing armoured back, clear and unwavering. “You know it isn’t your fa-”
Oh, but it was far more nuanced than that. In moments, that yawned long and crushingly heavy, the future seemed nothing more than a wasteland. And yet, here was a friend grinning at him from across the ring, and his breath shivered in his chest with the realisation, a truth sitting in his chest too simple to ignore – “I’ve got more than that.”
“You’re dead.” Steve rasps out, Tony’s face shuttering in confusion. And there’s nothing anyone can do about it. “You’re dead.”
Sam smiled tiredly. “Doesn’t matter. It doesn’t change things if I know now, and it wouldn’t have changed things had I known anything back then.”
(and this was the part where the grip should’ve slackened, but Steve’s pulse under his own stayed steady. Waiting.)
He hasn’t been alone on the trip, of course. Steve’s been there: sometimes three steps behind, sometimes waiting up ahead by the turn of the road. They’ve sprinted and stumbled, sometimes stood still and refused to move on ahead, sometimes thought of turning away altogether.
Soldiers. Tony had been surrounded by them all his life. For all that their little moments of joy weren’t inconsequential, they still hinged on conveniences. Take comfort from all quarters.
Forward it was, then. Maybe he’d be able to emerge beyond the stage where the band had set up; they couldn’t have closed off the entire street. Movement was teeth-grindingly slow, it took him fifteen minutes to even draw level with the far end of the square stage. He threw back a last look at the performers-there were four…maybe five couples onstage. They seemed to be dancing to their own rhythms, instead of the choreographed, synchronised charade from before; and it was enough to stagger Steve for a second, keep his gaze locked and blinking. The band was closer now, the music loomed even louder-a slow, lilting saxophone underlying a throaty voice:
that had set them apart ages ago? But- mistakes or no, recrimination or no- there were still things about a person that didn’t change. Immutable. And in the collection of voices that sprung to life in his head, there was still a quiet one that said-
Except Steve wasn’t stupid and they probably weren’t, were they – courtesy of a certain Wakandan royal. The man had probably spilled the beans the second he was out of the UN meeting; the Last American Hero and his buds were ensconced right in his backyard, after all. Wakanda: home of the tech-savvy and asylum for the vigilante.
“It’s used in scalpels. Surgical equipment. Industrial machines. Firearms. The top of the Chrysler building.” Tony’s waiting for it. He’s ready. The mocking, or at least the raised eyebrow. This is what the head of Stark Industries spends time thinking about? “Form and function. Beauty and precision. That’s what it is.”
Sam stopped, with a strange look directed at Steve that he couldn’t parse. “No.” Then he shook his head a little, and continued. “Anyway….I guess it’s the VA I miss the most. Some of the folks there had been coming along really well.”
Steve raised his eyes, slowly, and met a matching tiredness in Vision’s own gaze. “Mr Stark has gotten so used to fixing his own mistakes that he doesn’t know how to fix those made by others.”
It wasn’t an urge befitting Captain America-but fuck if Steve didn’t want to tear it down screaming, the stage and screen and all of it, the entire goddamn
, you bet your wedded ass I’m gonna lean into it.” Tony smoothed down the lapels of his own three-piece – dove gray, just a few shades lighter than his hair, with silver pinstripes. Shiny was one word for it. Awesome was another.
Steve reached out and swiped it, his own fingers brushing ephemerally over Tony’s. They were warm. Damp.
“Me neither, darling.” The words sounded thick in her throat, but Peggy wasn’t crying. She leaned forward, cupped her warm palms over his whitening fingers, “Always.”
“The kid isn’t going anywhere near this.” Not near people deprived of all hope, crushed under rock and bars. People that stayed alive long enough to die just before you extended a hand to save them. Was it cruel and narcissistic and loathsome to even think that? Yeah, yeah it was. But Tony wasn’t feeling very well inclined towards the world today. Not with the decisions it was making. Not with the ones it was forcing him to make. “You know who I’m talking about.”
, but soon the redhead would twist sinuously, legs flying out, body curving back in absolute trust, crowd crying out in appreciation-effortlessly modern. It should have been just as off-putting as the previous performance, but as her toes touched the floor, they looked at each other-the smallest of nods, the touch of a smile on the blonde’s lips-partners at the end of a perfect maneuver.
“I could… I could do it again. Here.” Work at it, at belonging to this time again. It couldn’t hurt as much, couldn’t claw at his throat with the hollowness of it more than the first go around. “With you.”
“People from…outside find it a little difficult to pronounce our names. So I stick to something easy.” A small pause. “You’re a paranoid man, Captain Rogers.”
So of course, what he ended up saying was an astoundingly unhelpful- “Maybe we can stick it out together for the night?”
He turned around and walked two steps to find his chair again, back dropping into the leathery seat with a groan. The impact hit his tailbone, shuddered up his entire spine. God, he was tired. He stretched his arms up high, muscles stretching and shaking weakly, even as the chair groaned behind his back. Arms came dropping down, and he cast out a hand to get a grip on the side of the workbench, pull the chair and himself closer. Folded his elbows against the cold surface for a proper headrest.
He didn’t look like he’d gone on an odd forty-hour bender for science, choosing to forego sleep. He looked like he’d stumbled for hours and hours in its search and sleep had shut the door in his face.
When he opened them again, Nat’s blues were scoping over the lines of his face- quiet and sympathetic and aching. “We’ve all made mistakes before. The crux is that we regret. Stand responsible. Atone.”
“Pepper.” Tony resisted the urge to fiddle with the cuffs of his jacket. It would accomplish nothing. All his first impulses were the same- deflect, joke, snark, jibe, throw it back at her. Ultimately useless. So it only made sense to go straight for it. “How much do you know?”
(Or, he doesn’t want her to think him a lower piece of pond scum than she already does. But fuck acknowledging that-he’s masochistic, but not enough for self-honesty.)
Steve matched his gaze, eyes roving against the horizon. There, somewhere between the line where grey sea met grey sky. Something red and gleaming, growing larger.
“Tony wouldn’t.” Yeah, a drink would definitely be nice. Now it was less like churning, and more like cold lead was settling somewhere deep in his gut.
was…he didn’t know what it was. Malicious. Cruel, threatening, mocking the crudely put together but still sincerely meant apology that Steve had sent. Steve wasn’t…he wasn’t naïve, he didn’t think that weeks and months would pass, and Tony would suddenly become alright with the idea of the Winter Soldier slaughtering his parents, the relationship between Howard and his wife and their son was too complex for that. But….when the initial flush of emotion had passed…Steve had hoped that a reasonable man would be able to see past revenge and-
He’s sitting in the gym with the armour half on, steaming over his wounds, when Steph walks in. She’s taken off her boots which takes off several inches from her height. Her uniform jacket is tied around her waist, strands of hair plastered to a grimy forehead, face lined and drawn and weary. She looks smaller, and tired, and Tony doesn’t think he can describe the sharpness of the guilt lancing through him.
His fingers brushed over something cold and smooth- he pulled his phone towards him, shifting on his stomach in the process, and used the base of his palm to rub out the condensation on the screen. A quickly typed out pass code later, the screen flashed to life. One new email. No subject.
It was a sharp, sharp jab – Steve heaved a breath and laughed with it, laughed till his eyes were faintly blurring and his chest hurt. Straightened up, meeting twinkling green eyes that he’d thought once upon a time, were cold and unreadable. “You’re not getting off that easy, Romanov.”
Moisture was beginning to pepper his face- from the rain, ocean spray or the air itself, he didn’t know. Steve pressed his lips together, tasting water. “The other things, that you remember. What are they?”
“You don’t know how teams work, Tony. You never have. Then the Avengers came along, and you fought aliens together, and redesigned your entire home in the hopes they’d stay.” Another, not-quite-so-amused exhale. “And I was jealous for the longest time, till your house blew up and no one came to help and I realised that you still had no idea what a team was supposed to be.”
Tony regards him, hum falling silent. There’s a dam there, in those eyes, holding back a wave of slowly stirring anger and injury that Steve fully intends to weather – but is leashed now, for some reason.
natural, and it fled just as quick as it had arrived; and Tony stopped trying to pretend that every inch of his skin wasn’t aching, that his eyelids weren’t dry and stretched thin, that his back didn’t hurt and breathing wasn’t hard, that Vision wasn’t cooped up in the kitchen at ‘home’ making one after the other paprika-filled dish for an absent Wanda, that Rhodey wasn’t striving to keep the pain out of his voice every time he spoke, that Pepper wasn’t
Steve had a weakness for it, for red. Any time one of his paintings looked a touch too dull, like the colours had been leached of their potency, like everything was too drab, too still (
Tony opened his eyes and looked up, and Rhodey took a step in from the doorway, and buckled. Tony’s mind went white, and he kicked the covers off while scrabbling to clamber off the bed and reach across the expansive bedroom in time. They crashed into the doorway, and Rhodey’s pained, muted whimper as they both sank to the mahogany floor; would sear and scar itself into Tony’s memory forever.
“That was a…” Steve cleared his throat casually, fooling absolutely no one – god, Tony loved him so much. “That was a really nice party, tonight. Pete and MJ loved it.”
And Rhodey deserved better than that. Better than catering endlessly to someone’s infinite set of….needs.
It went without saying that this address wasn’t exactly public knowledge (though he’d made a very literal address public knowledge before…ah, old mistakes. Never quite stopped tasting bitter). If it had made its way through his filters, then there was nothing malicious in it either- no concealed virus hoping to take down his private framework, hacking into the Iron Legion. It was safe to open the video attachment. Though of course, the last time he’d viewed one-
“What,” Steve asks – turned morbid by the laughter and press of people around him. Fifty percent. It never happened here. “What about you?”
Because what did it say, really, about him-on a plane with a rogue Captain America, thinking about God and misplaced faith.
“Talk.” And it was like the façade was crumbling, the granite that made up those strong lines, that straight nose, that inexorable jaw; wavering and disintegrating before his eyes. “When you went on about blueberries and Walt Whitman, robots and shields, heroes and responsibility. I wanted to talk from the very beginning, till the very end – and the more I wanted, the more I couldn’t, even when I should have. And now there are…there are…”
“Alrighty then! Our fantastic marathon dancers are going to be taking a breather for a minute-” Steve could feel his heart shrivel into his chest at the words, oh no,
“I…..don’t nanny you.” FRIDAY sounded almost uncertain. Dammit, Tony should have worded that better. When was he ever going to get things right? “I look after your welfare, as my predecessor did before me, because it is my duty. You need reminders for your sleep, and eating, and work hours, and-“
Now….it was, mildly disconcerting. Discovering you were nothing like the fella you thought you were.
Then Tony turned, swivelling on his heels, moving over to the other end. Steve’s heart crashed into his sternum, fingers folding tight over the card, stiff edges crinkling in his palm. It was warm too, and slightly sticky. Like something phantom still lingering on its surface.
One breath. Two. Tony released a final exhale, hissing through his teeth before pushing himself back and upwards, the armour towering over his height as ever. The merciless lights were beginning to seriously bother his eyes.
Chuckles everywhere, though Tony’s gaze went winging back to the rear of the crowd, where a familiar figure had appropriated himself a glass and was leaning against one of the pillars. Prime posing location, right next to one of the biggest candelabras – Tony highly approved. “As expected, I find him hanging out, upside down, from the newly refurbished A on top of Avengers Tower. Goes there every time he has a decision to make, probably thinks all the increased bloodflow to the head is going to make it work better – I don’t have the heart to tell him otherwise, poor lad.”
Tony could recall some choice, singularly brilliant rants against Queens- emitted by yours truly on better days. He could compose a soliloquy on the grand opulence of Manhattan verse the shabby…..shabbiness of Queens (see? Even his tremendously creative masterpiece of a mind was stumped when it came to describing the blandness of Queens).
A short, sharp sound of amusement. Clint’s arm flexed as he drew back to pull another arrow out of the quiver, laying on the flat rock he was propping a foot on- all motions deliberate and economic. “I wanna tell you you’re not- but guarantees count for horseshit these days.”
Steve twisted his head, meeting Tom’s eyes easily. They were lined several times over, an abundant smattering of spots on the eyelids. Crow’s feet.
“So I could say I’ve been selfish and that I regret it – but this is just more of the same. More selfishness. What I…” Steve’s mouth moved soundlessly, helplessly, seconds on end. “..want. And I want to. I just want to
They pulled back at the same time, fingers clinging for a moment before they parted, hands curling symmetrically around empty space. Steve pushed back on his heels and slowly got to his feet, knees straightening up until he was fully in the light. Tony didn’t follow him.
He swivelled around to face Peter directly, who was standing across the room, by the window sill. “I know your type, Peter. I know your aunt could tie your hands and legs, put you in a room with boarded windows, and forbid you to ever wear the costume again. But wear it you will. Each and every single time.” Tony smiled, a bit grittier, a bit more real. “It’s in your blood.”
Tony’s footsteps echoed on the reflective concrete, lights flickering to life above him with every motion-detected step. He turned the corner, eyes flickering over the space – motionless cars with glossy hoods running all along one wall, reflecting the shiny light fixtures. The other wall was split into alcoves, each hallowed in dim blue and hosting a suit, looking on vacantly.
“And so the world changes.” Stark whispered. He looked…like nothing at all in the half-formed darkness, but besotted by this idea of a reality where he lost. Again. “People held accountable for their actions, because it’s the right thing to do. Because Captain America said so.” Another twitch, and those eyes were back on Sam. “Tell me, does that sound like a feasible reality to you?”
“With my childhood history, you’d think I’d have gotten over it…but.” A little laugh, and Stark seemed to have snapped out of his little delirium. Except for his unreadable eyes. “I didn’t do much wrong, except for the crime of not being Captain America.”
And responsibility and common sense and everything that had been keeping him inside drove him out- till he stood here. Hand raised to his face, shielding his eyes from the setting sun, somewhere in a park in Queens.
“If you did the best you could, victory or failure was outside your hands, and there was no space for fear. Now, you need to consider if you’re standing for, fighting for the right thing.” A soft exhale. “Now you stay awake at night wondering if you’ve ruined things beyond saving.”
An exhale. He’d seen that stillness in her posture before, something almost studied about its quality. “You shouldn’t have done anything at all.”
Onscreen, Tony sidestepped a passer-by, and his lips moved- maybe in apology, Steve could hear nothing. He stopped at yet another crossing, and waited, face lined, eyes fixed at some unseeing point on the horizon. Steve jabbed at the pause button, chest burning.
“It was easier before, being unafraid.” Steve dipped his head, just enough for the sun to caress his cheek, illuminating tousled strands of hair. He looked like a man Tony had once opened his eyes to, one cloudless day in two thousand and twelve, smile strong and warm and hopeful, all at once.
And wasn’t it indeed irony of the finest flavour, that Stark had to be shattered to smithereens to make way for the Avengers – but even as Tony went deliberately seeking for the bitterness in that thought, it eluded him. Just…looking up at that ramshackle A, barely holding on to the side of the Tower, set aflame in the light of the rising sun – there was something about that sight that was liberatingly impossible to regret.
capital S, the modernist leanings he himself favoured in the scant décor were unmistakeable – “You had a haircut.”
“Zip.” Tony lifted one red-and-gold finger, dropping it when Steve pursed his mouth, a little mulishly. “I am a big boy who can handle some friction with my… ‘team lead’, in the most generous description of the term. I didn’t leave the team because of you. I am not continuing to stay
“Well, I’ve got a dab hand with technology myself. Maybe that’s another area where I can help brush up your skills.” Tony leaned in, ever so slightly. His free hand reached up to tug at the open collar of his shirt as if it itched, thumb running under the cotton. And for all that the flamboyant colour had annoyed Steve before…it was something else to see the sweat droplets peppered over that tan skin, leaking into the darkening red of the shirt. Something hot, and exhilarating and terrifying. “And I’m glad to hear of your hardworking temperament, …?”
Even now, she wore a well-tailored blazer that seemed to hang comfortably from her shoulders, but not align to her every curve. Her head wasn’t angled to catch the best lighting, the sunlight skimping on the cream of her cheek to glint off her greys instead; a furrow to her brow and the beginning of crow’s feet at the ends of gloriously pale eyes.
The scene dissolved. Steve caught a flash, of a worktable and parts of something complexly mechanical, a ragged blanket slung over Tony’s thighs and a digital clock blinking 2 am behind his elbow, before the recording cut out.
“Did you not have presents in your time?” Tony asks, part snark and mostly befuddled, the multicoloured gleam of fairy lights dappled in his hair.
“I am.” Vision said, steadily. He raised his right hand, tilting it back and forth in the morning sun with fingers spread wide apart, as if perusing it. “I enclose parts of JARVIS within me, whom Mr Stark created. Parts of ULTRON live within me too, also brought into being by Mr Stark. And then I was given this.” A long finger rising to tap soundlessly against the gem set into smooth red skin. “The Stone which drove Mr Stark into madness long enough to set the wheel of fate into inevitable motion, bringing us…here. In a ruined city, seeking peace. Rest.”
They walked together into his kitchen, Clint only a few paces behind Natasha’s falling footsteps, eyes immediately darting to every glossy surface in the room. God, Laura had been stress cleaning again. She only did it when he wasn’t around, because she knew how much he hated reflective surfaces that messed with his sightlines…but that wasn’t a path he could go down either
“Encouraging you?” Tony arched a brow from his seat on the rolling chair, legs extended. He straightened with an accompanying chair creak- there had been several, very ominous creaks already emitted in the last half hour. “I don’t quite put much stock in the way things ‘should be’. Which seems a little counterintuitive for a futurist- but that’s the way things are. It’s my job to distinguish between utopias and futures that can actually, feasibly exist. It’s the only way to achieve anything in the world.”
Steve….had to pause there, for a second- maybe in admiration, maybe something else. He didn’t know why he was surprised; he should have understood the second Tony had traipsed down the corridors of the Siberian bunker, talking merrily about truces and the Manchurian Candidate. “I don’t know why I expected you to stick firmly to the rules.”
“I…yeah.” Steve’s throat was a little tight. He tried to clear it, but it didn’t quite work. “Today’s the day?”
His fingertips and knuckles were white, digging into Rhodey’s shoulder in a useless attempt to attain balance when they’d crumpled to the ground. He should have realised it, loosened his grip, pulled them back. He should not have glanced down at his own bare chest, a deer’s frightened twitch- where the contusions lay stark against his skin like a brand.
