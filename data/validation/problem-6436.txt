“Because if there is, you are saving me” she says exiting the workshop and going to the entrance, Steve in tail, where she sees the gorgeous brunette she met 7 years ago, Tasha points her gauntlet at the woman and, '
“That’s just the prototype, we are kind of the only name in clean energy right now” She looks so proud, and not without reason, that Steve has to suppress a smile of his own, Banner nods
“Why, captain, I'm flattered that you think little old me is cute” her blush was to be denied till her last breath
“I do! I understood that reference!” Steve looks downright proud and Tasha has to ground herself so she doesn’t squeal again, Captain America looked so adorable that her fangirl-o-meter is going out of the roof, she rolls her eyes at her own thoughts, but with a fond smile set in place.
"Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me" Tasha smirks and complies, those are Captain's orders after all
Up in the space, as the suit starts to freeze, Tasha looks in horror a complete armada, the black space is filled with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster, most of them hang still in the air, some, move swimmingly about; her mind seems to close on itself, all of this... should be theoretically impossible, these monsters shouldn’t exist, and even if they do, they shouldn’t be on Earth for starters. She lets go of the missile, it whistles off into the blackness as she falls back down the portal’s opening, she sees with morbidly satisfaction as the main ship implodes, causing the entire armada to burst into a supernova, creating a spectacular heavenly display, Tasha closes her eyes, her suit stops responding alltogether and she’s running out of oxigen, she doesn’t want to die, not yet, not when she finally gets to have her live in order, not when she finally knows her hero, not when said hero looked at her with those perfect blue eyes and cute smile, not when she learn the joy of teasing and flirting the most handsome national icon... a little tear rolls down her cheek , ‘
Surprisingly, Coulson and Fury were first, Steve had been flabbergasted; Clint and Nat only gave him a warning because they trusted that the dear Captain remembered the talk in the Quinjet when they were on their way to fight the alien invasion, Steve remembered; Rhodey was next, he talked like Tasha's old man, almost sobbing about how she had grown so fast; the last person to talk to him was Pepper, and while Steve had yet to find out how she learned about his feelings, the redhead woman put the fear of gods on him, with only a few words and a perfect press smile, he really thought for a second that his body was never going to be found.
Natasha was 10 when her parents and Jarvis died in a car accident. She cried, but only for her mother and her dear butler, even at that age, she understood that Howard was too much of a drunk and beating bastard to deserve her pain. She was 11 when she had to learn to be more mature, she let Obie control SI with the condition that she'd spent time there learning, so she had to divide her time between MIT, socialite life and SI, and if it wasn’t because of Rhodey, aunt Peggy and aunt Angie, she would have probably collapsed.
“I’m talking about the Stark expo you heathen” Steve would never ever admitted it, but he's secretly relieved “Is in 6 months, and it’s important cause I managed to get a hold of two other quite important scientist” her eyes twinkles
“Didn’t know you were leaving” he says trying to keep the bite and dissapointment within him, he doesn’t make it though, seeing as the girl flinchs slightly
“JARVIS has been running it since I hit the bridge, in a few hours we’ll know every little secret SHIELD wanted to hide” Tasha holds out a bag of dry fruit “Blueberry?" Steve shakes his head and sighs
“Mmmm how about never? Yeah, let's go with that” she can feel little tremors that she force to perish by opening and closing her hands inside her pockets “And if you mention the Avengers again I’m so going to throw a snowball to your face” she warns the moment she sees the kid opening his mouth. Seriously, the kid just learned that Iron Man is actually a gorgeous and young female and he just wants to talk about Cap and birdbrain?
The blond soldier raises an eyebrow “You call him uncle yet you don’t trust him?” Tasha sends him a look ‘
“Hmmm that’s better” Maya looks at her with fondness and takes Tash’s sunglasses off her “You are seeing things” she laughs. Without them, Stark looks younger, her eyes shine with deep interest, both mentally and physically, and the air between them takes another turn as both of the girls bend to kiss. Happy closes the door of the suit, or at least try before something behind him explodes
"That's it! Clint! you are sleeping in the vents!" the tiny adorable genius pouts and Barton side-hugs her this time
“I have a plan... Attack!” she deadpans in all her 20ish glory, making the older man to almost groan at the simplicity of that answer, he grabs a parachute instead
"I'll... make sure she is happy in every aspect" he says looking at the scientist to the eye, he nods satisfied and walks to the elevator. When he sees that he is gone, Steve lets out a breath he didn't know he was holding, everyone saw the exchange they had in the ship after the fight, and since then, everyone seemed to assume that Steve was going to make a move soon, that wouldn't have been a problem if it wasn't because apparently everyone wanted to protect the little genius from ill-meaning suitors, not that he blamed, he probably would have been the same.
The rest of the Avengers are flying in the Quinjet to Malibu for a 'Stark intervention' when Bruce calls them, an urgent tone to his voice
“It’s not about that Stark, and this is not up for discussion, this is something important and serious, does director Fury knows about this?”
Tasha keeps walking on the snow 'till she finds a shelter, she enters it by kicking the door in the most badass way possible. It’s dark inside, but there are a desk and a sofa, she puts her armor on the couch and sits in front of the desk, she is barely getting comfortable when a U.S.K (unidentified small kid) points at her from the doorway, granted, she probably deserves it for trespassing, she raises her hands in mock surrender
“Right, like what he did in Stuttengard” The mischief god could've fought them in any other place, or just kill innocents for the sake of it without so much show-making, but he didn't
“Have care how you speak, Loki might be beyond reason, but he’s still an Asgardian and he is my brother” the god, Thor, says with a grave voice
“Yeah there’s a giant brain, there’s a shifty character I’m gonna follow this guy, I’m gonna run his plates and I’m gonna... you know? if it gets rough so be it”
Up in the air, the Mark XLII opens an entry in the plane and proceeds to crash the glowing man to one of the airplane walls
“Oh! You are a heart doctor! So good ‘cause she’s going to need a cardiologist after I...” she makes an obnoxious sound with a honk and leaves with her girl by the arm
"No... let the idiots have their moment" she deadpans before turning to the jet waiting for them, leaving Iron Man and Captain America to themselves
“He’s not here” he answers, he burns the armor with his hand “Ever tried the jet stream? Speaking of which, go fish” a bomb sounds in the back of the plane and screams follows, to release herself she burns him with one of her beams, she then flies to the back and opens the door just in time to see the last survivor flying through the hole in the aircraft’s wall, she flies right behind her
’ look to her fellow scientist and he drops it “Fair enough. When I come back though, I’ll come up with something to help you sleep better ‘kay? Your sleeping times are not healthy”
“And of course you’ll remember that when she spilled a million gallons of crude off Pensacola, thanks to you, not one fat cat saw a day in court”
“Yeah I miss you too... but the way it used to be, now you are off with the super-friends in New York and Captain Perfect and I don’t know what’s going on with you anymore” he complains
Tasha is blasting aliens close when she sees Nat run at Captain America, and jump on Cap’s shield to grab onto a flying chariot, Stark is thoughtfully impressed with both, Nat cuts the turret shooter’s linkage to it, then jumps on the rider and sticks her knives into his nervous system, getting to bank over a building.
“Wait wait wait, don’t move it, the ceiling is being held by this” she opens her faceplate and sees him dead in the eye
This is it, thank you so much for staying with me through this fic and I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I did writing it, and I'll love to read your thoughts, comments, and suggestions about this. also, sorry about any horrible mistake in there, I'm writing this with my eyes half closed because sleeping 4 hours a day is not healthy kids!
“I’ve compiled a Mandarin database for you, Miss, drawn from SHIELD, FBI and CIA intercepts” JARVIS informs her, she nods rubbing her head, she has a full headache in effect. She just arrived when Steve yelled at her for doing another crazy and stupid thing, '
“Uh-huh, or, you know, you’ll be suiting up like the rest of us” Bruce scrunches up his nose in disagreement
“832 miles” He answers, Tasha smiles, the guy looks at his friend “I’m good like that” the beeping continues “Can you, uh, stop that?”
“Toni, you hearing me? We have a missile headed straight for the city” that promptly freezes her for a minute, a wave of panic runs through her body
“Well, I guess that leaves with a decision to make, we can either save the president or Steve, we can't do both”
“Well, so I run his credentials. I make him. Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in... where were we in ‘06? the science conference?”
“Oh, you know princess, the usual, a little knock and talk, making friends in Pakistan... now you don’t get to complain because if I remember correctly, is YOU who changed me for the star and stripes kind of knight”
“So, now you’re just gonna leave me here like my dad? What happened to the ‘be my little brother’ thing?”
“I’ve told you, Killian, we can use her, look, if we want to launch product next year I need Stark, she just lacked a decent incentive, now she has one” Steve glares at both feeling as if he is going to black out, he doesn’t know what the serum is made of, but it’s damn strong if it can knock him out as it does seconds later
"Can't right now, I'm busy, you know? planning big robots and Christmas gifts" she says choosing two wines
sorry for being MIA, just been in a dark place lately (cofcofcollegecofcof) but I hope I can finish the story before Christmas.
Steve looks at both geniuses talking their mouths off about proyects, experiments, and overall science and can’t stop the fond smile forming on his lips, Nat's looking the same and even if Clint groans about the most boring orgy ever, the smile he has on his face said how pleased he is to be back in the Avengers Tower, Steve as well is glad to be back home, it's going to be a good day.
“And you’re all about style, aren’t you?” Steve can't stop his eyes from wandering through the petit body in front of him, he definitely doesn’t mean the flirty tone. Tasha still recognizes it and bits her lip subtly but enough to have Rogers' attention
“But that’s not true, you said so yourself, if you couldn’t control it you wouldn’t be here” she turns to Steve “SHIELD and everybody else should trust him more, much more than uncle Nick any case”
“On it” it’s all her reply. She and Steve are walking through a debris-filled hall, she turns to him and says “Find engine three, I’ll meet you there” She walks into another room, most likely to get her armor. Steve leaves to suit up and find the damaged engine. When he gets there he sees that is, in fact, completely dead
“I will roger that” she smiles bemusedly, she does so and leads towards tight corners in Hawkeye's view, who fires arrow upon arrow, exploding the Chitauri riders, Iron man keeps leading Chitauri under tunnels, through open parking garages until she looks back and there’s none left “Nice call” she says blasting more aliens that are in the ground “Hey, this is getting old, lets make a bet”
“No bomb parts found in a three-mile radius of the Chinese Theatre?” she looks every part of the scene
“But if that thing gets up to speed, you’ll get shredded” he sounds a little breathless at the idea of Tasha being possibly hurt
To all of you thank you so much, your comments are my inspiration, thank you, everyone, for your kind words, you really help me through this hard time of mine, I love you <3
“Alright old and hot stuff, let's see what else we can do to help” Steve feels happy and lightheaded at the 'hot' implication
“No, they didn’t, look around you, the costumes, green screen... honestly, I wasn’t on location for half this stuff, and when I was, it was movie magic, love”
“C-check the heart, check the.. is it the heart? Is it the brain?” she urges her AI to scan her vital signs
“Creating a flight plan for Tennessee” the AI says for all answer, she closes the interface and hears the doorbell, Steve opens her workshop door a few seconds after
"Ten bucks says you're wrong" Fury smirks "There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment" he adds looking at Captain America as he walks away.
“Oh, evening sir, nice to see the man of the hour in time for the show” the armor retreats showing the president “Welcome aboard, have you ever hear about an elephant graveyard? Well, two years ago, the elephant in the room was this scow” Killian shows him the footage of the ship
“Well, I think that was meant for you, even if Barton didn’t tell Loki about it, it still was all over the news”
Unable to keep his anxiety at bay any further, he goes out of his bedroom to Tasha’s door, slightly hoping that the genius is awake, since he really wants to ask about it, a second later he can hear quiet whimpers and gaps, worried, he decides to enter her room, quietly asking JARVIS for permission, which he grants. Steve finds Tasha shuddering in her sleep and practically runs to her side
“Six people died right?” Harley nods, Tasha keeps looking at the walls “Including Chad Davis” the kid makes an affirmative noise again “That doesn’t make sense” she sits next to him “Think about it, six dead, only five shadows”
Welcome to the Avengers Tower, to your right you can see birdbrain making a prank war, to your left you can see the hulk making science and if you look into de kitchen or the workshop, you can see two idiots pining for each other
“My diagnosis is that you’ve experienced a severe anxiety attack” the answer leaves her even breathless if possible, she looks disbelieving her health graphics
“Fine! I’ll be a basic human for now, but only for you Winghead” Steve heart flutters at the endearment his best friend gave him “’sides, I need coffee”
“Of course, I wouldn’t expect Black Widow to do any differently” she smirks, Clint laughs quietly, but soon enough his expression darkens again
“J-just find the cube” he says before walking out of the lab. His blush doesn’t vanish until he is on the other side of the carrier
Steve looks as if he is going to jump to the water... again, Coulson had to fish him out the last time, but right now he’s pacing
“I can close it! Can anybody hear me? I can shut the portal down” Nat’s tired but determined voice reaches her, interrumpting her thoughts
“Well I had to learn how... otherwise I’ll be dead by now” she smiles self-depreciating and Bruce decides then that he doesn’t like that look in her
“I... uh... well it seems to run on some form of electricity” he answers dropping a little sarcasm in there, somewhat embarrassed that he doesn’t have the slightest idea of what he is looking
"Why, of course, Captain, it would be an honor" the girl puts her hand on top of his "If you excuse us, gentlemen" she says as they walk away. Steve takes them to the little dance floor and puts his free arm on her back, Tasha quietly laughs "What's this about Winghead?"
"The circular thing in her chest plate, DOES. IT. GLOW?" he looks, but there's nothing glowing or that looks remotely on
“Yeah, maybe I don’t deserve her” Steve refuses to talk about Tasha in past tense “But you are wrong, she is already perfect” he answers before tackling him and sending both of them to the abyss, in the fall, both exchange punches and a few low blows, Clint follows their trajectory perched on the Iron suit and at Rhodey’s 'NOW!' scream, he shoots his special detonator bomb at a lower point, the arrow pierce Killian’s shoulder and traps him in a container.
If there's one downside about being a super soldier is the enhanced hearing most of the times, like the ones when he has light sleep yet he actually seeks for rest. Steve rolls in his bed, he wants to sleep, he really wants to, but his senses focus too much in other things like the sounds of the cars on the streets or of the air passing through the vents and among those sounds, he can hear the quiet sobs of someone in the tower.
“That’s so not funny” Tasha sighs, yeah, Steve's still mad at her, not really surprising if she thinks about it for more than a second
“Aww come on! I promise a stress-free environment, no tension, no surprises” Tasha says that but proceeds to poke Banner with a miniature electrical pod, which makes Steve’s heart stop for a second. If the Hulk were to come out so close to her... He walks in a bit more paled than before
“You do know I can see your insecurity from a mile away, don't you?" Tasha freezes, she does, after Rhodey, Nat is the second person that can see her and call bullshit the moment she puts her barriers up, perks of knowing someone when they are dying she guesses "You can do this котенок, we believe in you, and we are going to be with you, we'll have your back” Tasha fights back the tears at the endearment and her words of support, she has always been weak at the worry of the people she loves
“It was almost the same with me and Bucky, he was with me when my mother died and he always took care of me when I was sick which it was pretty much all the time. He was sarcastic yet charming" the time keeps moving as they keep drinking, Steve tells her more stories about them as kids, and as teenagers, he chuckles "The bastard always got all the ladies, even the ones he was trying to send my way, I'm sure you would've like him" Tasha was pretty drunk at this point, three and a half bottle after, so she doesn't even try to stop herself from blurting
“Now, which one of you is Vanessa?” one of the girls answers him “Ah... Nessie... did you know that fortune cookies aren’t even Chinese?” the phrase sounds familiar to the genius so she pokes her head behind the bed, the girl named Vanessa tries to tell him that she is back there but to no avail “They’re made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe” Natasha has enough of it and charge with her gun pointed to the man that looks like the Mandarin but it can't be him
Steve chooses that moment to enter the lab and drop a HYDRA rifle on the table, he looks pissed “Phase 2 is SHIELD using the cube to make weapons” he looks over to Tasha, who is very much impressed, and shrugs “Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow to me”
“I’m calling it EXTREMIS” Maya tells Tasha as they leave the living room to a more intimate place “It’s for human application, dendritic revitalization, disease prevention, even limb regrowth” she explains, Tasha looks at her in awe
“So... who’s at the door?” the Captain snaps from his ogl- assessment; because he was definitely and positively not ogling her, just because she might have been sober and conscious when she kissed him didn’t mean...
The next morning, Tasha writes some formulas down in a card as a suggestion to the glitch, she kisses it and lefts it with a note ‘
If you know a person that suffers from this, listen to them, ask them how can you help when they have an attack (cause every person deals with them differently) and please, I beg you, be kind to them, is quite hard enough to suffer through this on your own, that you really don't need someone making you feel less or worse.
“If I die, Killian, what happens to your hundreds of soldiers?” Tasha has to repress a shudder... she said hundreds right? “What happens to your product? What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot?” Killian stops and he sethes, his look is raged and he makes the point to look dead in the eye at Tasha and kill Maya with a gunshot. Stark inhales sharply
“Well, he took your friend Maya Hansen to her hotel and stayed with her until you decided to return, but then his tracking device got broken and we lost his signal, we went to the hotel but there was no one there except for a waiter, casualty. We found a seringe with a liquid that Bruce is already analysing and Steve’s shield” Tasha grips the wheel, hard “Coulson told us to no to tell you since you were already busy, but all things consider I decided that talking to you is the best choice”
“That’s two military guys...” Tasha mutters to herself “Guess that settles it, ever been to Tennesse, JARVIS?”
“Oh god! I thought that was just a theory” she exclaims a few minutes later in Maya's room, a little soberer up
“Sorry Tash, it’s classified information” she looks at him with kicked puppy eyes, the ones she just knows even Rhodey can’t refuse to “Okay there have been nine bombings, but the public only knows about three... But here’s the thing, nobody can ID a device, there are no bomb casings... or anything else, really”
“Well, at least I’m not a bully” she says with a blank expression that she shouldn’t know how to do, Steve flinches and she lets her guard soft a little, the comment had hurt, a lot, and if she wasn’t convinced of her worth, it would have made a lot more damage knowing it came from her childhood hero (thanks Rhodey, Pepper, Jarvis, Mom and aunt Peggy for that). The environment is tense, and she knows something isn’t right; No matter what she thinks, the man aunt Peggy loved and used to speak so highly of, wouldn’t say something so cruel like that. It looks like she is the only one that notices it thought, with Thor insulting humans and Fury wanting to take Bruce somewhere else
“I just did” the AI answers concerned, Iron man leaves the streets, getting rid of the aliens on her and flies into the sky, the World Security Council thinks that they can just blow Manhattan up for a few petty aliens? Well they are wrong, this is her home, of all of them really, is where she met Clint, where Pepper and her made their clean energy dream come true, New York is where she's planning to have her new Avengers family live with her, she isn’t having any of that, no bomb, no aliens, no nothing, she's sick of all this, and if she has to do something stupid and reckless again then she’ll do it, to save her city and her family fighting there, she’ll gladly do it
“Yeah, you really killed the glass” how Rhodey didn’t drown in his own sarcasm is something Tasha would never know
“Then skip the spinning rims, we’re on the clock here” Tasha lands and goes through the gauntlet that unsuits her. Loki is on the other side of the balcony, smiling at her, then proceeds to go into the penthouse, he strolls in, holding his scepter as Tasha casually walks down the steps towards her bar
“Oh my god” Rhodey whispers, he turns to Tasha “He’s strung up over the oil tanker... they’re gonna light him up, Jesus”
“Yeah sorry, as soon as I unpacked I went to see Rhodey, his time in the army must be perfect” she dry sarcasm
“Um... nothing actually sir... I just needed a reason to kill you that would play well on TV, you see, I’ve moved on, I found myself a new political patron... and by this time tomorrow, he’ll have your job” Killian looks at one of his henchmen “String him up”
The music snaps him from his musings, it's a slow melody that gives him the perfect excuse to do what he planned all day, he walks to the group and politely interrupts
“Well, my repulsors aren't working correctly so I’ll have to walk to him, we have to find Steve, quickly” Tasha explains the situation briefly before closing the faceplate again and start running a bit off due to the armor with both Widow and Hawkeye taking care of the remaining guards; her phone rings and she answers from inside the suit
After seeing the Ten Rings’ lair full of her weapons she made the decision of closing the weapons manufacture. She made the public announcement right after she let Rhodey know, he was mad at her, but he would come around once she explained to him the reasons. The board wasn’t happy either and they try to use her underage to their advantage, but Natasha hadn’t forgotten her mother’s lesson, so she used her puppy eyes, making the most of her childish features, and her stubbornness to convince them. She was as sweet as she could to get them to listen and then she proceeded to explain the type of change she wanted to make in SI, that they didn’t want to be remembered as the greatest murderers in history, but as the ones who made a good change in the world. She talked with the passion and conviction that she had seen in her aunt Peggy and if by the end of the board meeting they weren’t fully convinced, she asked them to give her three, no, two months to raise the stocks to a whole new level than ever, and that if she couldn’t do it, they could be back to make weapons.
“As you wish Miss, I’ve also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore” JARVIS informs her
“Wait... you slept with her?! she was underage! That’s illegal!” Maya looks stricken and actually winces under Steve words
at her “What? Oh come on Rhodey, there have been a lot of presidents and there’re more to come... but there’s only one super soldier that can save us from aliens in sexy spandex” she all but whines
“Okay, first of all, I’m not super in love with Steve, okay? I just.... like him” her ex-bodyguard snorts
“As a matter of fact... I do, thank you very much” she turns to her son again “Say... JARVIS, is it that time?”
Sorry, I'm just sooo weak to all of them being friends and loving each other and being good with Tony as well, idk maybe I've just stumble with too many bashing and hateful fics lately, but I really hope you liked it
“And I’ll read all about it” she tilts her head again, the doctor quickly wonders if the action is on purpose all the time or she does it unconsciously
“He turns” Maria Hill says with an entertaining glint, she doesn’t notice when Tasha places a hacking device under the monitor
“I’ll have you know that I, in fact, have a name, ‘sides, sure, he gives up the Cube and our friends and he’s all yours, until then, stay out of our way... tourist” she adds while she walks away, she doesn’t give more than two steps before being pushed into a clear by the damned hammer “Okay... now it’s on”
“I just... there were aliens... and the wormhole.... and I couldn’t breath... and then Howard....” she immediately shuts her mouth with the little conscience she has. Steve scowls
“Bloody hell, bloody hell, look, I’m not moving, you want something? Take it... but I can assure you, that all the guns are fake, cause those wankers wouldn’t trust me with the real ones”
“Doesn’t matter, if he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract’s lost along with Barton and Selvig!” Tasha turns and gets ready to jump off the jet
“I can’t do that, his 40’s mind would shortcut” she makes a booming movement with her hands to make her point and Rhodey just
“Yeah, looks like we are going to have to teach you how to use your pad again” she giggles and walks to the other side of the workshop “So what are you doing really? Are you still harassing interns? Did the employers complaint raised again?”
“I need some air” Steve whispers getting out and walking to the cliff where the house’s entrance was hours ago “Common Tash... where are you? Why won’t you let us help you?” at that moment he feels a vibration in his pocket, is his StarkPhone, the screen is blue and there’s an input code, Steve types ‘Zero-Two-Charlie-Three-Five-Delta-Blue-S-S-Zero-Seven’ he keeps both of his thumbs in the lecture code, then the ‘access granted’ message appears, Steve put the phone to his ear, the machine tells him that he has a new message, that almost makes him choke
“Well you are not wrong” Iron man voice sounds amused. She tells him what he should look out for and Steve checks everything all over again
“Uh... to town, on each other, probably back in your room, because I also want to see your research" she manages to complete the sentence without eating any words
When she tells him, Rhodey just about dies with laughter, literally or at least that what it looks like because he can’t. Just. Stop. Laughing
“Clint and I can look for the boat he talks about, we can take the jet” Nat says feeling the urge in her namesake's voice
and now the real fun starts! (also from here on, there's going to be A LOT of dialogue so be prepared)
“I'd sit this one out Cap, those two come from legends, they’re practically gods” Natasha intervenes seeing Steve as he prepares to jump
“Okay then...” she whispers, aims at the CMS and fires, the energy from her boosters shatters, sending her and Selvig backward, she has to stabilize herself with her repulsors, yet the device remains unharmed
“Huh... dads... who needs ‘em, I sure coulda live without mine” she bitterly adds “Hey, listen, would you like to be my little brother?”
“So... Thor is inside the containment cell somewhere down there, Bruce jumped of the Hellicarrier trying to play catch with a jet, I lost my chance to see the Hulk...” she pouts quietly “Loki escaped and Coulson...” her voice almost breaks at the last one
“He made it personal, he attacked my family, 'sides I’ve been compromised from the start” she stands up and goes to the door “So prepare yourselves to see me punch a god in the face” is what she says before exiting, of course, she doesn’t get too far before a feminine hand stops her
“Then no, you’ll have the advantage of a more accurate countability” she explains as she fires the invaders
“I might have been actually 16 back then” she thinks about for a second and adds offended "Wait... What? Do I actually look like I'm 29 years old?"
“Barely, we are going to the main house, catch us as fast as you can! You are not going to believe this”
“I have no idea and honestly I don’t care” she says, having the idea of what the kid wants to talk about
“He went for the bat actually, he should be back soon” Maya deadpans this time, Tasha shudders “No, I need your help”
“I guess this guy named Chad Davis used to live roundabouts, he won a bunch of medals in the army... one day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb, then he blew himself up, right here”
“We’re dead in the air up here, our communications, the location of the cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing, lost my one good eye but I think I had that coming” Fury waits for a beat, he sighs and continues “Yes we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract, but I had a bigger bet, riskier. Tasha knows about this, it was called The Avengers Initiative. An idea of bringing together a group of remarkable people, see if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil believes in that, heroes.”
“Ms. Stark!” an older and disheveled man calls to her, but she doesn’t take notice until the guy appears right in front of her and her date “Oh wow! Hey, Tasha!” he smiles at both women prompting Tasha to raise an eyebrow. Does she know him? She can’t recall, but of course, with all the booze she had it’s a surprise she can recognize her driver, bodyguard and friend, Happy “Aldrich Killian” the man slightly stutters “I’m a big fan of your work”
“Of course you don’t remember, you were drunk, so drunk in fact you flirted with him, and he was all over you, it was creepy, let me tell you. Anyway with Pepper, first it was fine, they were talking business, but now it’s like, getting weird, he’s showing her.... his big brain” Tasha almost chokes at that
’. The MARK XVII tackles Steve to safety in a lower bridge below and he is hopeless seeing Natasha Stark fall to her doom for the second time.
"Don't sweat it point break, you didn't break anything, also... I'm not a kid!!" -Tasha Stark at some point
"When I say to you, that I love you, that's what it means, stupid Shellhead" Steve brightly smiles at Tasha's red face, she looks relieved and happy and doesn't stop herself from clinging to him and kiss him again
“How do you... you know what? I don’t want to know” with Pepper, Natasha has learned to just stop prying into some things
"You did this?" Steve shifts his weight uncomfortably, he was kind of expecting that she took more time to figure it out
“For real?” she makes an affirmative sound while taking out a wine bottle, maybe Steve won’t be against a little dinner with a little wine? “All right, so she’s meeting up with this scientist, rich guy, handsome, I couldn’t make his face at first right? You know I’m good with faces”
“Don’t worry kid, it ain’t your fault.... remember what I told you about bullies?” she nods to him hopping the kid knows what to do, he does and flashes the light beacon right into the thug’s face “You like that Westworld?” she calls at him so he can let Harley go “That’s the thing about smart people... we always cover our ass” she says as she powers up and fires right at his face a little repulsor, knocking him off.
“Come on, your knight in shiny armor is waiting for us with a warm meal” Pep coerces her up, while Steve tries to make as if his enhence hearing didn’t listen to everything
“Oh hello Miss” JARVIS answers, she notices a man that creeps behind her, but she doesn’t move since the shadow from before kicks him to the ground
“Well, even with your genius, I can’t see how would you escape from here, but hey nobody ever accused me of not being grateful, so I want to repay you with the same gift of despair that you so graciously imparted to me” she groans
“Yeah, sure, just gonna try and get my beak wet real quick, you know what I mean” she winks stepping outside
"Only if she lets you" the man jokes and everyone laughs, Steve can only smile, he won't admit it, but he is really nervous
“Why, Captain, I’m glad you noticed my new under-armor suit” she spins for good measure and tilts her head while battering her lashes. Steve blushes a deep shade of red that she thinks it's adorable and make her heart flutter, which prompts a grin on her face
“And why ever that might be?” he drops thick sarcasm on that single phrase and Tasha does what any adult would... she sticks her tongue out and shoves him slightly
“So apparantely... I’m not that easy to kill, well, just in case you were wondering” Tasha chuckles “Tell Pepper I’m okay please, and Rhodey, no one else... let them think I’m gone for a while, don’t worry itsy bitsy, I’m totally going back to kick their asses, relax and wait for the fireworks, I promise if I need you guys I’ll give you a call, see ya soon” the message is cut and Steve wants to kick something or to punch something because that was not nearly enough damn it!
Tasha grins... if Aldrich thinks he can take away the person she cares deeply for that easily, he is wrong
Antonia Stark was a 3-year-old little girl when she first created a circuit board, unfortunately, Howard was unimpressed and proceed to ban her from his lab. She learned what it meant to be strong and to not to cry when weeks after that, her father submitted her to a lot of different tasks, most of them including being handed hot or sharp objects, she was a Stark so she had to be made of Iron. She was 4 when her mother showed her the power of ‘inocence'; the board members of SI didn’t even see it coming, but when she got them to agree to Toni being the youngest stockholder with only a soft voice and her eyelashes, was when the little girl understood that strength and power can have many forms.
“Well, that’s up to you, you could be a regular genius scientist with powers or a superhero genius scientist with awesome powers” she sends him a knowingly half smile and gets back to work. Banner mimics her
Steve gets up, done with trying to relax and exits the suit the genius gave to him earlier while the rest of the Tower is being remodeled, he follows the soft sound to the common room and finds a little silhouette in the sofa, he inhales sharply; Tasha is covering her face and if it wasn't because of his special ears, he wouldn't even notice the tiny movements in her shoulders, it's a trait that no person, especially no young person like her, should have. Steve drags his feet in the floor to the couch, aiming to cause enough noise for her to know that he's there but not too much as to startle her. He sits next to her, as close as he needs to feel her freeze for a second, he slowly puts his arms around her, hugging the little body of the genius and starts humming a melody his mother used to sing to him in the nights where his asthma was bad. They stay like that for almost an hour, yet Steve doesn't even feel the time passing until Tasha looks up to him and hugs him back, he feels his heart break just a little, he wants to take her pain away, because she is such a brave and kind person, she offered them a place to live for free for god's sake! and that's not even mentioning the whole almost dying to save the city.
Day and night she worked hard to accomplish that, she didn’t want to sleep anyway, the nightmares about water and her new arc reactor being present almost everytime she closed her eyes. Following the change in SI, she created Mark II, everything was a blur after that. She was almost 18 when she learned about Obie’s betrayal in the worst way possible and it was purely in spite that she dragged herself to her spare arc reactor and went after him.
“Ah, see, I don’t get a suit of armor, I’m exposed, like a nerve. It's a nightmare” ahh she could relate
“No, not really, I... It was just... one night... seven years ago” Maya mutters and Tasha closes her eyes briefly as she prepares herself for a world of pain
Both the spy and the coronel hold onto one of the borders and jump when it swings next to the President before plunge and create a fire sea, with Nat on one side and Rhodey on the other he cut the cable holding the President and they swing and fall into a bridge, Nat shoots the last cable and the President falls in front of them
“I don’t know about that yet, but it is powered by the cube, and I’d like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys”
The god raises his hammer to the cap “You want me to put the hammer down?” he hits the vibranium shield, provoking a massive shockwave that blows Natasha up. When she stands up she looks at Steve and the shield in awe
“This is better than any right?” there’s a beeping “Well... now the air force has been compromised, and I’m not moving any mile away from Spangles so... I guess it’s time for plan B”
Steve gets close to his fellow teammate and greets him with a little “Iron man” that makes Tasha feel giddy
“Fine, but we don’t have a transport and I doubt that-” she interrupts herself and looks back at the actor “Hey Ringo! Didn’t you say something about a lovely speedboat?”
Next minute, they receive a phone call from Nick Fury who tells them that SHIELD's going to personally take the situation on their hands
“Well, if we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops” she says without missing a beat while looking at a diagram
“I don’t fucking care about your excuses, Natasha Stark is an invaluable asset to this organization, you look for her and find her!”
“Food would be nice, and booze, lots of booze” Tasha laughed but conceded. Moments later they were very drunk and talking away every little thing. By morning it was like they were friends from centuries.
"You mean, Stark, Banner, and Coulson had so much work they missed Christmas" Nat sees him dead in the eye, a mischievous twinkle in her eyes "I recall you dragging Rogers and myself to the nearest bar to join the festivities" Laura turns to look at her husband
“Look, Mr. Slattery, here’s how it works, you tell us where Captain America is and we can get to some agreement” Coulson says with his ‘
Iron Man swoops down the street, the monster following close, making a disaster of a few buildings still standing, Banner start walking to it
“We’re awaiting the arrival of genius and CEO of Stark Industries, Natasha Stark, we’re hoping she’ll give us the reaction... her reaction to the latest attack” Tasha groans, before putting on her sunglasses, it had been a good move to tell Steve to wait for her, he doesn’t have to put up with more reporters bullshit. Who told them that was the hospital where Happy was anyway?... better yet, how did they knew her friend Happy had been in the attack? She doesn’t wait for an answer as she goes out and all the cameras flash on her “Ms, Stark! Hi there, our sources are telling us that all the signs are pointing to another Mandarin attack, what do you think about that?” the interviewers get in her way to her car, but she moves with ease, confident and with all the attitude of who doesn’t give a crap of what others think about her, she's just about to escape all the vultures when a male voice makes her snap, it isn’t as much as him as what he says though
Her hips bounce from one side to another following her arms she closes her eyes in an expression of pure bliss and pleasure, then she opens them and tosses her left arm up front. Nothing happens. She scowls and does it again, again everything stays still
“The Oracle cloud has completed analysis, accessing satellites and plotting the last 12 months of thermogenic occurrences now” in the map, a lot of temperatures spikes raises
"Agent Romanov, did you miss me?” a distorted but clearly excited voice sounds on the comms. Both the Captain and Loki looks up as Tash flies over in the Iron man suit and shoots Loki back to the ground before landing right in front of Steve and taking out all the weaponry. Rogers had seen the armor in the tablet's footage but seeing it up close he has to admit it is actually really impressive. “Make your move reindeer games” there's something weird in the mechanical voice that Steve can't quite put a name to it. At the sight, the mischief god raise his hands in surrender “Good move”
“Tasha!!” she can hear Steve voice clearer, which means that he’s getting inside the house, she can’t have that, it’s too dangerous, super serum be damned, she shoots her soft repulsor at the heat signature of Steve inside the house to send him flying back, she falls with the house
“You really shouldn’t try to lie to Captain America uncle Nick, it’s not nice” she sounds innocent but a smug undertone says otherwise, Fury sends her a look
“Little brother! Or.. is it too fancy term for assistant?” she raises an eyebrow “I need an assistant kid, I also happen to need a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring and a tuna fish sandwich” the kid looks at her funny “What? My house was blown, I’m bleeding and I’m hungry” the boy narrows his eyes
Natasha was 17 when she was kidnapped by the ten rings. She was held in a cave along with Yinsen for 3 months, being tortured until she agreed to recreate the Jericho missile, before escaping with Mark I and a piece of metal deep in her chest. She couldn’t save Yinsen though, and she mourned him for months, finally creating a whole new research and development department in his honor: clean energy.
“We can’t find Steve” Tasha almost crashes the car, but she manages to control it at the last second
He can hear someone climbing the stairs to where he is, he stands up and looks, at the end of the bridge is Killian
“Oh, I’m sorry honeybear, they’re only coded to me, maybe next time yeah? But don’t worry, I got you cover” Tasha goes flying after that, she has to find Steve “Talk to me Widow, where’s Cap?”
"No, we aren't!" Clint whines when he hears Laura's quiet laugh "Stop bullying me, don't you have a damsel in distress that needs your help?" he practically pouts and his wife brush his arm with her hand to comfort him
“Come on people, we don’t have all day! Everybody grab your monkey!” she orders, they start doing it, soon she is holding seven people in one hand
“Miss, I have an update from Malibu” Tasha ignores Rhodey’s comment in favor of listening to her favorite son “The cranes have finally arrived and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak”
“What? No, but I do know it’s happening off the coast, something to do with a big boat... I can take you there... oh! And this next bit may include the vice president as well... Is that important?”
“Thank you Spangles, you are my hero” she whispers drying her cheeks and the rim of her eyes, Steve smiles at her
“Ugh, fine” Tasha practically whines “let’s keep them occupied” she heads back to the portal to continue to take enemies down. She hears a primal roar that makes her cringe, when she looks up she immediately regrets it. From the portal, a fucking Chitauri Leviathan flies out carrying hundreds of soldiers
"Yeah... but who do you think gets critizied for not appearing on the Stark christmas Gala?" Steve frowns at that comment, like Avengers, they only appear enough for the media to leave them alone, Natasha Stark is not an official Avenger, the public thinks of her as their patron, they don't even
"They are like a vultures Spangles!" she whispers quite amused, she gets closer and Steve can smell her perfume, he blushes a light pink. When the song ends, and before some other suitor can claim a dance with her, he holds her by the hand and guides them to the balcony, is a little chilly so he gives her his coat "Is this another rescue?" Tasha wiggle her eyebrows, he can feel his face hot
Natasha Stark stops working for a full second before throwing her arms to his neck and kisses him on the lips, Steve is surprised but kisses back immediately, a little scared that the moment breaks, until the genius seems to remember who she is with and stops
“Of couse sweetheart, I leave tomorrow morning, see ya my beautiful bride” she hangs up right there so she can keep having the last word, it’s a game they have since MIT, Nat looks at her with an amused smile
“I... sorry, you are right, it’s not nice and I apologized” she nods and gives him a little, more genuine smile. It's the first time someone doesn’t go out of the way in apologies and promises of rewards and stuff, which she thinks is pretty good for a change
"Of course we'll stay котенок, we need to stay close in case you do anything that stupid again" Nat says ruffling her hair as well. Tasha pouts
“To New York" the soldier looks around him as Clint starts the jet "Isn’t Tasha coming with us?” Steve asks in a tiny hopeful voice, earning a weird look from the archer
“While I agree with you, I truly want to believe that is actually this easy” she looks at Captain America and grins inside the helmet “Still, you are pretty spry for a capsicle” Steve raises an eyebrow, normally he would get upset over the name calling, but despite the weird and clearly amused tone, he doesn’t hear the type of bite he would expect from any other person
Steve keeps falling until the Hulk grabs him and tosses him to the ground just as the multiple bombs explode burning the other half of the regenerating soldiers. An EXTREMIS’ user jumps and destroys the suit Clint’s on, forcing him to jump off it and shoot an arrow through his skull in mid-air, he collapses hard enough to roll a few times. Nat arrives next to them and offers a hand to Steve
“I can’t... I can’t believe it! Rogers, Fucking Captain America is here to... babysit you?” she sends him a look that has him wheezing again, she groans
“Big Brain and she likes it, here, let me show you” Happy makes a show of putting the SPad in the air, trying to point to the offices, but the only thing Tasha can see is the bodyguard with a focused look, she giggles
In that year and a half, Clint kept visiting her sometimes when he wasn’t very busy since most of his missions were happening in New York anyway, he just took a suit in one floor of the tower, and Tasha was really fine with that, she liked the company. She went as far as to give him new arrows and upgrades on his bow, which he paid back with tips in security matters and even a bit of self-defense lessons. Soon enough, Barton looked at her like he would look a little sister (or a little pet in his own words), he told her a few missions stories when she couldn't sleep due to nightmares, sharing alcohol or just hot chocolate, on one memorable occasion, he told her when Nat scolded him for letting her drink, Tasha really laughed at that imagining the intimidating Romanov scowling at Clint just for let a 19-year-old drink her own alcohol, it was hilarious. They became close enough that Tasha knew about Laura and the kids and even if she hadn't met them personally, she sent them 5 years worth of Christmas and birthdays presents that month.
Another missile impacts the house and the ceiling of the entrance collapse trapping the genius inside
“I thought the beast had wandered off” his smile while talking like that about Bruce almost makes her snap, almost
“We aren’t soldiers” she makes a pause, letting the wall to carry her weight “We aren’t marching at SHIELD’s orders, and I recommend you to not doing it” she almost snarls at the last part
“Pepper, right” Steve bashfully concedes “Tasha is in her workshop if you want to call her over while I finish here”
“I’m so not going to talk about my useless crush on Steve Rogers and non-existent love life to you, I still remember what happened five years ago, don't think I've forgotten” and with that Rhodey made a surrender motion that has her glaring at him for a moment before drinking the rest of her beer “Why don’t you better tell me what’s really going on? With the mandarin?” her friend moves his head negatively “Platypus I’m worried for you, seriously, can we talk about this guy?” she takes his hand and idly plays with his fingers, a tic she developed since MIT
The ‘old’ Stark Tower got trashed in the New York invasion, so Natasha Stark, being both the genius and billionaire she was, remodeled the Tower to add new floors for the new occupants: the Avengers; her name in the front of the building got change (thanks Chitauri soldiers) leaving only the A, hence the name: the Avenger’s Tower. Every hero had their own floor full with suits and kitchens, plus there was a common room, two labs, a full packed gym, a playroom, a range room and her workshop, where Tasha could be found when she wasn’t at the common floor with the other guys. It had taken a full 5 months but all the residentes were quite happy and comfortable with ther new home
“Hey! Watch the face! I live from it” she whines, she can hear the sheriff asking questions to the woman who is pushing her to the table, she cuffs Tasha hands behind her back right after and tosses her to the ground, as the sheriff and the woman keep discussion about homeland whatever security, Tasha makes a head motion to Ms. Davis, she takes notice of it and throws the file under a couch nearby. The mechanic can see how her hand glows an orange color... weird, next thing the woman burns the sheriff and takes his gun, firing it making all of the people in the bar to run screaming, Tasha runs as she can feel the woman following her, only to stop to see a guy glowing orange as well looking at her at the end of the street, she is trapped, she takes cover behind a car when the man shoots at her, she looks at the guy next to her “Crazy huh?” he just nods “Now watch this” Stark runs to a window and jumps through it, yeah... not her best idea, but she uses the leverage to pass her hands beneath her and up to her front, thank god for gymnastics and ballet classes. She has to run and slide behind a counter since the woman from earlier somehow managed to get a fuckin gun. As Tasha tries to run, the woman grabs her by the head, stamps her in the wall and proceeds to beat her, until the genius manages to turn her around and tries to choke her with the cuffs, the woman start glowing and Tasha hisses in pain from the burns but at least the metal melts and she gets free. Stark kicks an oil gallon to her direction and sends the incandescent piece of cuff right to it, making a wall of fire, she puts the dog tags in the microwave and starts it just as the, now orange-glowing, woman comes from the fire, with burns but otherwise practically intact “You walked right into this one, you know? I’ve dated hotter chicks than you”
That all happened weeks ago, but Steve never recovered. All he'd done was miss Tony. If he could go back in time and beg Tony to take him back, he would. Even better, Steve wanted to go back in time and stop the argument from ever happening. If Steve thought he had a chance, he'd call Tony in an instant. But he knew that Tony would never take him back. Steve was almost certain that Tony had moved on, found someone new. Tony wasn't sat at home, all by himself, wishing someone was by his side. No, Steve was. Steve was the one lying on his bed, wishing he could do something to stop the gaping hole of loneliness growing in his chest. Steve had felt low before, but never this low. He didn't want to say he felt depressed, but all he wanted to do was sleep. He'd been pushing his friends away. All he'd done was work and sleep. He was lonely. In fact, lonely didn't even begin to cover it. Steve felt abandoned. Steve was not abandoned, despite his beliefs. He had abandoned himself. There was a myriad of people waiting to help him if he'd let them. Unfortunately, Steve was as stubborn as a mule, and refused to let anyone help him. Ever.
"Wow, you really don't remember, do you?" Pepper asked. Before Tony even had a chance to answer, she spoke again. "Have you even checked your phone?"
"It's Tony," Steve said, sniffling. "He's got a new girl. Someone saw them together and snapped a couple of photos. It's all over the internet."
"Yeah, yeah, we promise," Bucky said. "I'm getting impatient. Either you come out or we come in." Steve grumbled, but got up to open the door.
"Okay, just how much of last night do you remember?" Pepper asked, in a tone that resembled the one she reserved for her three-year-old niece.
"You posted two photos with a girl called Skye. In one of them, you were making out with her, in another, you were cuddling in bed," Pepper said.
When Steve arrived at Tony's door, he hesitated for a moment. He didn't want to knock and risk being turned away. He still had a spare key for Tony's front door, even though he wasn't really supposed to. He told Tony that he lost it. In reality, he just didn't want to give it back. Tony would be fuming if he found out Steve still had a key, but at least it meant he might be able to sneak in, grab his phone, and sneak out, without being seen by Tony. Maybe. The moment Steve turned the key in the lock, he regretted it. He could hear Tony sobbing from the hallway and he hated it. It felt like someone was reaching inside his chest and clawing at his heart. It hurt in ways Steve had never felt before, ways he didn't know it was possible to hurt. He regretted every single event that has led up to that moment. The breakup, the drinking, the sex, everything. The guilt gnawed a hole in Steve's chest. He wanted to just grab his phone and leave, but his heart ached at hearing Tony cry. Against his better judgement, Steve poked his head around the corner and saw Tony curled up in a ball on the floor, sobbing his eyes out. Steve knew that he couldn't just leave when Tony was so upset. He had to do something, he had to help.
When Tony stepped down from the podium and away from the flashing cameras, all he wanted to do was go home. The blinding lights and endless questions had been a bit too much, even for Tony. He was very used to press conferences, but that didn't make them any less tiring. Despite every bone in his body aching and the overwhelming urge to nap, Tony still decided to go out to a club for a while. He did, after all, promise Nat that he'd try and find someone new, even if it was just for one night. He wished more than anything that he could text Nat and tell her that he didn't feel up to it, but he knew she'd just keep pestering him if he did. Half an hour, he vowed to himself. He'd go for half an hour. Talk to a couple of people, and if someone wanted to go home with him, he'd let them. Tony just prayed that it would be enough to get Nat off his case.
His thighs were trembling as Tony entered a second finger, scissoring them open and hooking until he found the place that he was looking for. It didn't take long before he found the little bundle of nerves that had Steve's entire body shaking and shivering with pleasure, his moans increasing in their volume and his hips archinh off the bed.
"You! Please! I need you inside me, right now!" He panted, hips still bucking in an attempt to find friction and release.
Steve whimpered at the praise, his cock twitching before he raised up, and sank himself back down. His hands were resting against Tony's chest as he began to bounce himself on him. Tony was murmuring continued soft reassurances the whole time, on top of a cacophony of sound, moans and groans that mixed together with the sound of slapping skin filled the room. Steve looked perfect as he impaled himself on Tony's dick.over and over again, building up his speed until he was sweating and throwing his head back, rolling his hips with abandon.
Tony groaned deep in his throat at the thought of Steve bouncing mercilessly on top of him, head thrown back involuntarily, "God, Steve, yes"
"Tony, please" he begged, his hands gripping the bed sheets so tightly that his knuckles were turning white, "I need..."
He was frozen still as the music started, completely unaware of the way their friends had turned towards him with matching smirks. His heart rate picked up as Steve put both hands on the microphone and started to sing, his voice was beautiful, he was singing with his eyes fixed firmly on Tony's.
They separated for breathe, smiles wide on their faces, happiness reflected in their eyes. Tony pulled Steve from the stage and towards the door with vigor, he couldn't waist another moment not being with Steve. He'd finally got this, he wasn't going to wait around to lose it. He looked back at Steve and the way his pupils were completely blown out was a reflection of just how much he probably agreed with his sentiment. They cast a quick goodbye to their friends, not stopping to chat and made for the door. They could clearly hear Clint wolf-whistling and Sam shouting "use protection" before they were out the door and hailing for a cab.
"Oh God, Steve" he moaned before emptying his load into the condom, a deep groan coming from his throat as he threw his head back into the pillows and relished the feeling of his orgasm hitting him, rolling over him from toes to ears.
He winked purposefully at him again, taking the microphone off the stand as he started to walk around the stage. It seemed that everyone in the bar had their eyes on him. There were people cheering and men and women ogling but Tony found solace in knowing that this performance was just for him and him only.
Tony put his hands on Steve's hips to keep him still as he slowly started to mark his way down the soft, supple skin of his throat. He sucked feverishly on the pulse of Steve's neck earning him a series of delicious moans and pleas, a dark purple hickey forming right there for all to see and satisfying the possessive side of Tony. He grinned against his skin as Steve mercilessly bucked his hips to no avail, searching for relief.
Tony was only too happy to oblige, pulling away from the door and walking towards his bed, Steve still firmly around him. When he finally got there, he dropped Steve onto the bed causing him to shirek and giggle, oh what a glorious sound. Tony was smirking as he toed his converse off, Steve doing the same with his boots. They both rid themselves of their tshirts and Tony found that the best moment to climb onto the bed and tower over Steve, both moaning softly when their erections brushed against each other again. They were both rock hard and in the need of any kind of friction they could get, frotting against each other and returning to kissing.
They remained that way as they caught their breathe, chests heaving and eyes closed. Steve slumped forward to rest his head on Tony's shoulder, who wrapped his arms losely round his waist, gently rubbing his back in concentric circles as soothingly as possible. Eventually, he lifted off of Tony and fell onto the bed next to him, his eyes closed and lips parted. Tony disposed idly of the condom before drifting off into the bathroom to clean off.
Getting nowhere with his search he just leaned to his right and into Sam's personal space and asked him if he knew where he'd gone but he only looked away sharply and shook his head. Well, that was odd. He nudged Bucky away from his conversation with Clint on his left side to ask him the same question but yet again, both of them seemed momentarily awkward before just shaking their heads and returning to their conversation, this time more quiet and reserved. Damn, them. Maybe he'd found a nice college boy to hook up with and decided his friends were too good for him. For all Steve's purity and sweetness, his faux-innocent blue eyes that sparkled, he was sure, held all his dirty little secrets behind them. Tony was certain that Steve was secretly a freak underneath all of that apple-pie act. He saw the lingering looks he sent the other men on campus and he knew that he wasn't the blushing virgin everyone thought he was. Tony told the overly possessive side of him that he wasn't entitled to feel that way but the jealously rearing its ugly head inside his mind viciously refused to listen to logic. It was stupid, Steve wasn't his.
Before Tony could brood himself into leaving and finding another man or woman to climb inside of, Steve walked onto the small stage. Tony had to double-take. He was certain that Steve was not wearing that when he'd seen him earlier. He could feel his jaw hanging open at the sight in front of him. Cock jumping as he ran his eyes up and down the blondes lithe and enticing form. He heard Bucky snicker beside him and mutter words along the lines of 'close your mouth, Stark, you'll catch flies' but he chose to ignore it in favour of ogling the sinfully long legs and gripping curves currently standing on the stage.
Steve had decided that tonight was the night he would wear his sluttiest pair of denim shorts, perfectly framing his bubble-but in the back and the distinct buldge in the front. He was wearing a crop-top with the words 'dudes just taste better' in tacky writing and surrounded by rainbows that should not have been as hot as it was. To top it all off he was wearing brown leather combat boots and a long, oversized hoodie that, upon closer inspection, was clearly Tony's favourite AC/DC hoodie. His mouth went completely dry at that, a flair of possessive desire taking over him. Steve was wearing his hoodie.
Somehow, Tony found himself surrounded by roudy college students in a dated Kareoke bar that Steve and the rest of their friends had dragged him to on a Friday night when, really, he should be at home exploring the inside of some random girls mouth. He'd only agreed on the basis that he didn't have to sing and he got to hear Clint's terrible rendition of Whitney Houston's 'I Have Nothing' surrounded by people who would definitely find pleasure in telling him how bad it was. He'd even been promised that Carol would get up and sing and that was not an opportunity to miss out on. He had convinced himself at this point that him being here had nothing to do with spending time with Steve, who he certainly only saw as a very close friend. Like he said, he'd much rather have been with some random girl he didn't know tasting the inside of her legs.
“But you can control it...” he quietly says, a little appalled by what the kid had to suffer so young
”What? That this was somehow their fault? Captain America saved my life, wherever any of them are, I wanna say thank you”
“I can’t believe I’m saying this, I got a nuke coming in and it’s gonna blow in less than a minute...” her heat sensors find the missile and she puts even more energy in her boots to catch it “And I know just where to put it” she can hear the sharp breath from her teammates, her family, they are thinking the same thing she is. Tasha comes at the missile from behind, it sppeeds on, but so does she, finally she grabs it from behind, gripping it tightly. With a mighty effort she wrenches the rocket off its course, steering it from behind, she accelerates quickly, flying straight up into ths sky, torwards the portal
She mutters under her breath and hits lightly her arm a few times before doing the same movement, this time a whirring is heard and one of the gauntles fly to her attaching itself to her arm and extending, along with a part of the armor that acomodates in her shoulder. She turns to another table and tosses her right arm in that direction, the other gauntlet flies to her as well, she laughs delighted ordering her electronic butler to send all the other parts to her. She lifts her leg to welcome one of them, she looks smug until the helmet crashes with a glass protecting a suit, the others fly in every direction. Soon she is getting ambush by her own invention as it attaches itself to her, the one in the back hurts a bit and makes her go down, but before she falls face first she stabilizes her body with the repulsors, she tells JARVIS to cool it down a little bit, and after the chest plate is in place the only thing left is the face plate. She coos at her metal piece and habor to take it, she lands with a bad-ass pose, inside the helmet comes to life and the interface is shown
Natasha Stark is a genius, a patient and strategic woman who doesn’t do anything by pure impulse (Rhodey calls bullshit) so it’s all in her plans when she flies firstly to her tower in New York, despite what everybody else would say about being dangerous with the possibility of Loki being there, she has to change her suit to a more functional, less turbine damaged armor after all, so she is actually not doing something reckless and unnecessary, (shut up Rhodes).
Both spies are flying a Hunter jet, each one, and send short distance missiles to blow the bastard up
“As a team” it's Steve simple answer because they have to stop them, they have to defend New York, they have to save the Earth
“Miss, a new video is streaming” Tasha tenses and is like all her easy-going self is gone in an instant, she is full in bussiness mood when she goes in front of the TV and coolly says
"Beautiful, right?" a known voice talks next to him, Bruce is wearing a more casual black suit, he is not that comfortable in this kind of parties and tends to only stay a few hours before retiring to either his lab or the hulk room, depending on how the night unfolds. Steve nods, not taking his eyes off her, the way she talks, she politely laughs and makes conversation, only enough so they decide to donate money or invest, whatever the genius' goal is "No one here could imagine her working non stop for days trying to fix EXTREMIS so the few kids that survived the fight can have a better life" there's a little of spite on Banner's voice that makes Steve turn to him
“Excuse me, what’s questionable about electricity? All right? It’s my suit, and I can’t... I’m gonna... I don’t wanna....” Tasha feels as if the air is getting out of her lungs but not comming in, her palms are sweaty and she has to open the car door to sit on the ground, because it’s not posible, without her suit... without it she just can’t, she can’t and... and..
“Take away everywhere that there’s been a Mandarin attack” a lot of points disappears, she checks one by one of the remaining ones until her gaze lands on Tennesse “That, are you sure that’s not one of his?”
“She is not dead” Nat tells them, even if it seems that she is saying that to calm herself “She can’t be, the armor went to her so it’s almost certain that she made it out last second” she looks at her two friends “We know her, and she does that, a lot”
“Yep” she says before kicking a guy in the face. The Avengers also look in awe at the show, all the armors Tasha has created are flying at impressive speed, all the Iron Man suits form a line in front of everyone making a magnificent circle in the sky. Tasha talks into the comms “Merry Christmas everyone”
"Hey Spangles!" he looks to the sports car that drove next to him, a genius that looks far too young to be driving grins to him "Follow us, you have your designated suit as well!"
Steve opens his eyes, he feels weak, a light hurts him, makes his head cry in protest. He notices that he is stranded to a bed with tubes getting out of him, those tubes carry his blood... that explains the dizziness, he sees the man from before... Killian was it?
“So you are an idiot just like Phil” her eyes show exasperation and maybe just a tiny bit of despair, but Steve knows better than to comment on that
“Of course miss, the orders should be arriving by evening tonight” Tasha smirks, if someone thinks that she can’t make Christmas presents they are very very wrong
Tasha continuously spins the engine, giving it her all, the rotors are propelling properly and fast, making the Hellicarrier level itself and not to fall killing everyone
“Pepper!” the young woman excitedly goes and hugs her “What’s with all of you calling me Toni today, it’s so not cute” she pouts as Pepper giggles, Tasha moves her eyebrows mischievously “So.... how was your date with Aldrich Killian?” the older woman makes a disbelieving expression
“Well, now, that is an appropriate question, the ground floor, actually, of a proposal I’m putting together myself. It’s a privately funded think tank called Advance Idea Mechanics” he explains while offering two cards to the scientists
“Natasha!” Steve yells, he makes another effort to move the tubes without engaging the building, and finally he gets free “I’m coming to get you!”
“Ventilation system” he said “you need more security in there” Natasha nodded with a raised eyebrow, quite impressed “As for the reason I’m here and not at SHIELD...” he shrugged “I’m undercover, but some thug shot me; if I go to SHIELD it could raise suspicions. Nat’s been talking high about you, which is something pretty damn amazing in itself, so I wanted to check you out and I thought that this was as a good time than ever right?” he smiled while Tasha cleaned the wound, she awkwardly smiled back
“Yeah, well I’m telling you it isn’t, I’ve seen it on the street okay? People are going bang, they’re painting the walls, Maya... you’re kidding yourself” the scientist shows her an old card with the inscription ‘you know who I am’
“Access code: One-Alpha-Zero-Three-Beta-Red-S-W-Five-Three” the screen shows ‘access granted’ and immediately sounds a voice that makes everyone breath in relief
Hours later, she and Bruce are working on deciphering the workings of the scepter while waiting for their program to find the Tesseract when Fury storms inside the lab
She can’t think very well so she goes to the only place where she doesn’t have to after Rhodey’s side: with Nat and Clint.
“Captain” Hawkeye pulls a trigger on his bow that chooses an arrow mechanically “It would be my genuine pleasure” he then shoots into a creature’s head, gaining a few seconds for Steve as he falls down the bridge and races to the plaza, jumping over dozens of exploding cars. He can hear Tasha’s voice on the comms
“Yeah, took us a while to get any traction I’ll give you that one” Tasha drinks half of the second glass and continues “But... let’s do a head count here: Your brother, the handsome and sparkly demi-god; the dreamy super-soldier, a living legend who lives up to it; an amazing man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, a gorgeous genius, and you, big fella, you’ve managed to piss off every single one of us”
"So... what's that I hear about our rooms in the Tower?" Clint back-hugs her, teasing her hair relentlessly, Tasha whines by all protest
Natasha Stark is watching Happy in his hospital bed, she had always hated hospitals since she was a kid, they used to represent "accidents" that were actually beatings that went too far; it wasn’t any different now, but for one of her bests friends, she could endure it. She had been there for almost twelve hours, she put every guard she could in the entrance. Happy had been in surgery for a good four hours while the doctors were trying to stabilize him and to stop the internal bleeding, he hadn’t been too close to the explosion... but he hadn't been that far away either. Tasha went through her messages, worried texts from Clint, Bruce, Nat, Pepper, Coulson, and even Uncle Fury. While the nurse checked on her ex-bodyguard, she makes the motion of turning off the TV, Tasha stops her before that
But he doesn't have any furthest interest, because that would be completely inappropriate; it doesn't explain what's Steve doing outside the lab watching the two scientist work though. Which is really a sight to behold, seeing the kid walk like she owns the place, moving her hands around holograms, walking to Bruce and getting back. She is pure movement, fluid and easy and Steve aches for a pencil and a sketchpad. He doesn’t mean it, but his enhance hearing allows him to listen to the conversation, not that he understands half of what they are saying anyway
"I'm sorry! Steve... I... sorry, I know you don't think of me like that and we are best friends an oh my god, I messed up right? now you're going to hate me, and please don't move out of the tower, I swear we don't even have to talk about this, lets just pretend like it never happened, like last year, and you didn't suppose to know about that, anywayletsjustgosoIcanburymyselfinworkandnotcomeouttillthenextcentuyand-" Steve gently takes her face and presses their lips once again, more confident that his feelings are reciprocated this time and interrupts her rambling that gets to the point of being unintelligible "Wh-what? b-but I thought..."
“What was uncle Bucky like?” she whispers, fearful of touching a sour subject that makes him hate her, instead, Steve shows her a warm yet pained smile
"You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing" the god stands still with a smirk in place
“Thanks for the sandwich, by the way, it was fairly good, the spring was a little rusty and the rest of the materials I’ll make do” Tasha says to Harley as they walk through town “Also, when you said your sister had a watch I was kind of hoping something a little more classy and mature ya know?” the kid laughs as the mechanic sees her borrowed Dora the Explorer watch
“I know, but remember the plan princess, we also have to figure out this president, vice-president thing right?” Rhodey urges her, she turns to him as if acknowledging his presence for the first time
“Hey kid, what would you like for Christmas?” he asks ignoring Harley’s apologies to Tasha “No, no, no I think he was trying to say ‘I want my goddamn file’”
“Seeing, still working on the believing. Where’s Bruce? Has he shown up yet?” she asks as she directs herself towards the huge monster, the thing's gonna destroy the city and she can't have that
It was a good thing that Steve didn’t make another bet with Fury because he would have lost miserably after seeing the damned monster that came through the portal. The thing was huge, and practically unreal, without the heavy hitters like the Hulk or Thor it would be impossible for mere humans like them to take it down (Super-serum be damned), at least they had the genius on their side. Speaking of the devil... '
“Like someone took my brain out and play with it...” he looks down and then back to her, Tasha nods understanding that Clint doesn't want to elaborate
“Hey Winghead, so, the good news is that I’m alive. Firstly I want to apologize for being an idiot and put you in danger, and I don’t give a crap about the super serum, you are one of my best friends and I want you safe, period. Also here’s another apology... because I won’t go home yet and I’m still going to do stupid things, sorry... but I need to find this guy, you can laugh of me if you want later... I just grabbed a poncho from a wooden Indian, you know?" she laughs "any way... I’ll see you soon okay? Love ya Spangles”
“That’s my secret, Captain. I’m always angry” Bruce’s body starts to swell, stretch, get bigger and green. The Hulk smashes the Leviathan right in the nose, managing to flip the creature over 360, letting Tasha, who’s ready with her arm and a rocket out, to shoot to a soft spot. The Leviathan is blown away. Steve raises his shield to block the debris that falls to them, protecting Nat with the same movement, Tasha lands next to them. The Avengers Assemble as more Chitauri soldiers and Leviathans fly out of the portal
“I got it” Iron Patriot answers and flies next to it to get its attention, it works, and as soon as the Hulk gets out of the range of explosion, half of the remaining troops that they were fighting are blown to smithereens
“I can tell...” Tasha mocks him “You know how I can tell?” she starts the engine and send him a mocking smirk “’Cause we’re connected” she chuckles as she drives away from town
if you like it (or not) I would love to read your opinions! kudos and comments are deeply appreciated :3
“Do we need to worry about that?” in the news Channel there’s a live feed of Tasha’s Malibu house and a missile going straight at it, everyone turns to look at the same time it impacts in the wall, sending all of them backwards with the explosion, Tasha sees Steve flying and before she can even think about it, she sends her Iron Man armor to cover and protect him just at the same time they hit the wall. She coughs once, the air knocked out of her ‘
“Toni” she scrunches her nose, he is the one of the only three people that still calls her that, especially since he knows she doesn’t like it that much “I’m assuming you saw the news”
“Yeah, and that was just the preview, this is the opening night. And Loki... he is a full-tilt diva, I should know...” Steve raises an eyebrow but doesn’t comment on it “He wants flowers, he wants parades, he wants a monument built in the skies with his name plastered in...” Steve can pin point the exact moment when all the puzzle pieces clicks together inside her brain. Tasha's eyes widden almost comically “Sonofabitch” is all she says, and storms out of the room, again
“It’s not a bad idea, he can make sure you keep your sleep and eat scheadules” Bruce innocently adds
"You know where she is every time she is stressed" the spy says tilting her head slightly to the bar's direction, Steve nods and with a polite motion, he walks away trying to find his best friend
1.- To answer sassbrat1984 question, I made a timeline :3 also thank you so much for your comments <3
“I got you! Tash! I got you!, let you go, I’ll catch you” she nods, but the machine moves one more time and both its load and the rail where Steve is, falls down, both of them fall to the sea of fire, in mid-air, however, Tasha sees a familiar looking armor coming to her
This is the last official chapter, well, where the Avenger's movie ends at least, I'll put up an epilogue with fluffy Stony either tonight or tomorrow so yeah, that's that, I hope you like this fic which is my
“Your speech was great, girl!” a man tries to come close to her and Happy stands between him and his young boss
Soon enough a man appears and starts shooting at him and throwing him grenades, Steve jumps back to the other railing down with Loki’s goons. He starts taking them down, even going as far as to throw one of them off, but with one down, more men enter the room firing, he grabs a gun and starts shooting back at them. In the comms, he can hear Fury considerable shaken
Steve can do little as Tasha arranges herself on top of the walking furnace called Super-Soldier, he sighs and drops an arm around her, well if he is going to be used as a pillow he is going to take full advantage of that and hug the little genius until her nightmares are gone
“It’s too late! It can’t stop now. He wants to show us something! A new universe.” Selvig looks mad, probably a combination of Loki’s mental control and the usual scientific frenzy
“A shame, what a pity that even with the super serum you are so proud of you couldn’t even reach her, haven’t this happen before?” Steve glares, his feelings are numb because of the shock, but that doesn’t mean he can’t understand him “Oh yeah, I’ve read all about you, the serum, Erskine, I might not look like it but I also quite enjoy science you know? Ah, the train as well... you don’t really learn from your mistakes do you?” if looks could kill, Aldrich would have been already dead “I would’ve caught her, which only proves... you didn’t deserve her... as you don’t deserve that serum” Steve clenches his fist, what’s left of his blood seems to boil in anger, he runs until he meets Killian halfway and punches him on his face, who takes him by the neck, both his hand and the place where Steve hit him glowing bright orange and tosses him off the bridge, Steve hangs from the floor and impulse himself back to the rail, kicking Killian in the process. Aldrich glows again, his body reaches higher temperatures making him a target to Tasha’s suits that shoot him multiple times, simultaneously repulsing him backwards, the super soldier takes that as an advantage and kicks him again, sending him to another part of the construction, he doesn’t has his shield, but he’ll make it work, he’s still Captain America after all.
“Sure, might as well” Unfortunately they don’t answer, Rhodey in the middle of a military assault and Pepper in the plane, watching in shock the destruction in New York.
“Honestly, I hate working here, they are so weird” he says before running, Tasha walks to the exit when the last of her armor joins her
“Yeah well... Nat and I remember Budapest very differently” is all he says before another explosion blows near
“Too fast... nothing” she stands again but this time only letting her eyes peek, there are at least a dozen soldiers who, Tasha can bet, are EXTREMIS’ users, also a lot of guards “Orange glowing soldiers, and armed guards, I don’t doubt there’re more of those human walking bombs based on what Maya said” Rhodey and Tasha stand, they are surrounded
Outside, the last helicopter stops shooting both survivors and retreats, Steve runs to the ruins of the house, only to see that the rest of the Malibu luxurious house isn’t there anymore
“I recommend to anyone who can, to take the Hulk out of there in the next minute” he deadpans as he shoots an explosive arrow to the petrol container
Tasha is in the middle of tinkering with MARK XLII when Happy calls, right after she came back from her meeting with Rhodey she locked herself in the workshop, Steve was a bit concerned but he allowed her when she just looked at him with her trademark puppy eyes, which wouldn’t have been that useful if not cause of the twinge of despair behind them; the soldier allowed her to go in lock-down mode as soon as she promised to be back for dinner, and it was a serious promise, he even threatened her to use his override codes if necessary and she agreed. Tasha has been in there for 3 hours when Happy video-chats her
“This guys are endless!” she says into the comms as she has to protect the President until the unit from SHIELD she asked for arrives
“I’ll have to try to hack her server, it would be easier if JARVIS was online” Coulson replies “But it will take a while”
“Steve, I’m fine, the suit is a bit burnt but I’m fine, I’m fine I just...” she steps out of the armor gently, she doesn’t know if Killian did it on purpose but he did put that much heat to burn some circuits “See? I’m in one piece, all go-” that moment Killian’s cut arm melts the floor and Tasha falls down to the lower level on top of a cargo machine, she screams in pain when a broken pipe pierce her leg
“Manipulative? Me? Please Tash, how can I be manipulative? I certainly lack those features, obviously, I don’t have those gorgeous lashes you possess” the girl huffs, it’s not the first time someone calls her a manipulative slut, but honestly? she always does her best to at least earn those insults, not just because she stood someone up “But yes, I know he can be over the top sometimes, he is... well, he is a stage actor, they say his Lear was the toast of Croydon whatever that is, but the point here is that ever since that big dude with the hammer....”
if you are feeling on edge, the attack starts in the phrase "are you okay" and ends on "check the heart"
“Sorry, I didn’t expect you guys to return so quickly, I was actually planing the trip to get my oder armors and some new parts from a month now, and I already finished MARK XLII so it’s the perfect time...” Steve nods, then, the perfect idea occurs to him
“Really?” she giggles quite drunk “Awesome! that’s my favorite kind, it’s a winning combo!” she sways a little
“Yes! That’s the name of the guy, he created me” Tasha can feel a headache coming her way “His think tank thinked it up! The pathology of a serial killer, the manipulation of Western iconography” in a second the man loses his accent “Ready for another lesson? Blah blah blah” she supress a shiver “Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life”
“Of course Hap, what are friends for? anyway, I got to cut you off, get you taser and stop that evil secretary to steal the printing ink, bye” she cuts her ex-bodyguard before he can start his everyday rant of how Pepper’s the best and is way out of his league, speaking of which... “Hey J, you order what I told you to?”
“Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet and blow stuff up?” From there on the discussion escalates further and it looks like the shit is about to hit the fan any second. The Avengers don’t even notice the scepter glowing, and they definitely don’t notice how the attack outside the Hellicarrier begins
Thor and Nat enters the lab then, with her eyes on Banner “You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment doctor?” she asks, Bruce looks pissed
“No, no, no!, Threatening, I’m just being polite. No drink? You sure? I’m having one” she says serving herself a glass of whiskey
"And here I thought you'll be happy to see us" Clint butts into the comms, prompting a delighted laugh out of her "I'm wounded, let's go eat some pasta Nat, we are not wanted here" Tasha rolls her eyes, he's ridiculous
“If I don’t go back in 15 seconds close the portal” she says with her cold, business-like voice, she can’t show weakness, no now, no when she is going to at least die in the glory of battle, and not by some mere kiddnappers or stupid, over-rated palladium. A few chocked sounds ring in the comms
“Banner?” Steve asks confused, they didn’t even know where he was yet Tasha seemed sure that he was going to appear soon
at her “Okay fine, his mind won’t do that, but common Rhodey! be serious for a second okay? Steve Rogers interested in me? Like that? The man and the others barely see me as a little sister, it's almost a miracle that they take me seriously and that's not even mentioning they treat me like a child”
“Gary. Say, is Iron Man around? Because I wouldn’t mind asking if he could sign my super personalite tatoo and...” before the guy gets more excited, Tasha takes his arm and makes him look into her eyes while batting her lashes in auto-pilot
If you suffer anxiety and/or depression and/or panic attacks like me, I want you to know that you are not alone, and it's okay, find help, don't push your own limits unless you want to and breath deeply when you feel like that. But mostly, my recommendation is to talk to a specialist (psychologist or psychiatrist) who can help you get better at handle it.
“I know, winghead... you always got my back” she grunts in pain, because the machine is stuck but keeps moving, and it hurts. The tube that’s trapping her gets loose and falls
“Yeah” she deadpans “Think about it as if your older sister moved out, it always happens, not that I have any actual siblings to know but... yeah” she makes a pause then realization cames “Wait you’re guilt-tripping me, aren’t you?” Harley makes a total fake sad face and total fake childish voice
Looking at the ceiling, he has enough time to think about what he overheard before dinner, and about said party itself. It was the Avengers' Christmas party, Steve was looking out for a very, very drunk Natasha Stark that had taken on herself the task of flirting with every person that allows her to, which meant absolutely everyone. In a moment the drunk genius had looked at him with intensity and kissed him, softly at first but a bit more rough after
“Trust me, I’ve thinking about it as well, but for the time being, she is a civilian, and apparently, she is also Tasha’s friend, she asked me to protect her before, and I don’t want to disappoint her” Steve says in his best Captain’s voice “It would be a good time to question her motives you know? Give her a sense of security” he adds just so the agent knows that he’s prepared for anything
“Iron Man are you seeing this?” Cap’s voice reaches her and she briefly wonders if he looks as amazed and horrified as he sounds
“Tash, Tash, look I’m not trying to be a dic-... dictator...” he composes after seeing kids coming to their table, the girl looks at her smiling
“We have a HULK” just because of that the god should be begging for mercy really, who actually expects to win against a Hulk?
“Hey, watch it, it’s a limited edition” she warns him before turning to the other guy “Hey, ponytail express, what’s the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?”
“You become my little brother! Isn't it obvious?” now is the kid’s turn to raise an eyebrow “Okay fine, what about... salvation. What’s his name?”
“I’ll tell you on the way, can you fly one of those jets?” Steve saw her being co-pilot, but he wonders if they would need a faster jet
Natasha Stark and Rhodey are hiding in the dark, walking quickly but being stealthy. Clint went to get Bruce and Nat Romanov is on the other side of the boat looking for clues on Steve location, Tasha looks completely focused... too much for Rhodey's comfort
Here's an advice: don't let your homework to accumulate and sleep!!! don't be like me!! really guys! I don't even know what I'm writing at this point
“And what are you? 8?” she rolls her eyes “Look, kid, if I tell you that I’m Iron Man is because I’m Iron Man okay? I’ll put my suit on to prove my point but I kinda need to repair it first, also... rude, and I can assure, if you keep telling girls that they can’t be superheroes, you won’t be popular any time soon” she sticks her tongue out at the kid, proving once more how mature Tasha Stark can be, he just shrugs as if accepting easily that a 20 something young woman can be one of the Mighty Avengers
When the other Avengers arrive at the destroyed Malibu house, SHIELD's already on scene, Fury shouting to his agents
Sitting in the Quinjet, Steve is holding a tablet watching the footage of his soon to be teammates, starting with the Hulk, he briefly wonders why would other people want to recreate the serum, also, why would SHIELD want to tinker with one of the most dangerous weapons in history? His musings are interrupted by Coulson’s voice.
“Whoa whoa whoa, he’s here... he’s here, but he’s not here, he’s here, but he’s not here, you know what I mean?... I....It’s complicated... okay? It’s complicated”
“Yeah” Cap looks at her in awe, not quite believing that she's still alive, he takes her by the arm and pulls her to his arms, enveloping the little genius in a warm hug, he was so close to losing her twice in less than three days; Steve knows he won't be able to take his eyes off her for the next month "I know you do... just, try not to die this time"
“Those people need assistance down there” he can’t move a finger though since the Chitauri soldiers that landed near the Avengers start firing at them. Black Widow pulls both pistols out and fires
“I don’t know Captain, I don’t trust her, she looks shady, I would like to keep her to question her, at least until her records are updated”
"He's called Loki, he's not from around here, there's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know" Fury says
“According to the footage I saw...” she takes a pause when she tackles a soldier and tosses him to the sea “He is where the barrels exploded, that’s the lab” Tasha inhales sharply and puts everything in the thrusters, as she goes, the battle keeps on going, both armors and avengers kick orange soldiers. She soon enters the ruins of the lab and sees the blond bump on the ground covered on debris, she tries to take them but Steve’s strained voice stops her
Tasha talks into her personal connection with her favorite son “JARVIS, target EXTREMIS heat signatures and disable with extreme prejudice”
“I need a minute here!” Steve sounds out of breath as he climbs up the cable and reaches the railing
“What’s with the sass?” Tasha chuckles “Of course I will” she sniffs “All right, let’s do this” she looks up at one of her robots “DUM-E” she calls with a sweet voice “Hi DUM-E, you know how you get that cap on your head? You earn it” she scowls as she goes to her baby swiping robot “Hey! What are you doing out of the corner? You know what you did. Also, there's blood on my mat, handle it”
“She is back” he can hear the relief sighs of Black widow and Hawkeye, then he turns to the kid, a dashingly smile on his face “We won” he breaths, Tasha closes her eyes for a second that makes Capitan America panic, he doesn’t want to see her like that ever again, she is a swell girl after all. When she opens them, the weight of the battle seems to be reflected in her gorgeous eyes
“We located the Tesseract” she says plainly, she looks at the coordinates and adds “I can get there faster...” she starts saying before Thor interjects arguing that the Tesseract belongs to Asgard and only an Asgardian can control it, she rolls her eyes
“I just want to say, I never thought people had been hurt, they lied to me, I was used” he says blinking several times
“Oh my god! Natasha! You just scared the life out of me!” he caresses her hair and without thinking kisses her forehead, the genius blush is going to be denied to her death and used by Clint as one of his mocking tactics till the end of their days “ I thought... I thought you were...”
“Hey, Ms. Stark! When is somebody gonna kill this guy?” She turns glaring at the guy “I’m just saying”
“Thor, you’ve gotta try and bottleneck that portal, slow them down, you’ve got the lightning, light the bastards up” the god do as told and flies with his hammer, Steve turns to Nat “You and me, we stay here on the ground keep the fighting here. And Hulk...” the green monster turns to him “Smash” Hulk smiles a magnificent grin and leaps soaring high into the nearest building.
Seeing as Nat has everything in control, Tasha only flies near and shoots any surrounding Chitauri riders, then she makes her way down to land next to Captain America who is fighting more soldiers, she points her hand boosters at his shield, the energy coming off and Cap using it as a reflected beam that takes down nearby Chitauri. Tasha flies again with a blossoming happiness in her chest, she never dreamt of fighting alongside her childhood hero (and new found crush) she’s a little lightheaded, hence not noticing Clint taking down any riders near her, she does notice Hulk and Thor tearing apart one of the Leviathan though.
“Normally I would go for that sort of thing but now... I’m kind of reserving myself” she makes a point to see Steve who isn’t looking at her as he is tossing bags and his shield from behind the couch
It was, surprisingly, the first time she followed an order and she didn’t tell anyone she was Iron-Man
“I don’t remember being ever that easy, this guy packs a wallop” Natasha inwardly chuckle, but her genius and strategist mind already working a mile per hour
“Honestly, they can’t bank worth a damn, find a tight corner” he says while shooting to an alien behind him
"Thanks and Steve..." Cap looks at him "Take good care of her, I know Rhodey already gave you the shovel talk..." he groans, awkward was an understatement, but at least it had been better than Pepper's, her talk had been outright terrifying "But just for you to know... if you hurt her in any way well... the Hulk isn't going to be happy, he's quite fond of her you know? and... you really don't want to know how my type of science can affect you" Steve swallows, that last thing legitimately sends chills down his spine
“There’s something I need you guys to see” the agent takes them to a seclude tent, the five of them followed by Maya Hansen' eyes, once inside he talks to the heroes “We used our codes to enter to Stark’s private security... there’s a new message for you agent Romanov, but I need your access code” he pushes at her a tablet with a microphone and Nat proceeds to talk loud and clear
“Welcome back to the land of the living” Clint greets her from his place on the couch, Nat and Bruce are in the kitchen counter eating, she slides a plate full of food to the genius
Back in the seemingly destroyed Stark Tower, Loki crawls onto the stair, looking like has seen better days, which’s probably true, he takes a few breathers and turns sensing someone behind him, he finds the Avengers staring at him, clearly pissed off, Hawkeye going as far as to aim an arrow right at his head
“Actually Miss, it is charging, but the power source is questionable, it may not succeed in revitalizing the MARK XLII" JARVIS soothing voice sounds over the phone
“Right... Army” Tasha flies up towards the portal launching miniature multiple rockets that take down several targets, something like Jericho but tinier, cuter and deadlier, yet her weapon is useless as thousands of Chitauri fly out, she then makes the call to fly down to the city. The army blast things as it goes blowing up cars and buildings causing explosions to rip out all over the city. Soon enough, the Quinjet appears and start shooting aliens
“Yeah sure, if Richard here, doesn’t mind.... are you fine with this Dick?” she makes a point of seeing Rhodey dead in the eye, he just smiles awkwardly and agrees, he just knows in how much trouble he is in with the genius “What’s your name princess?”
I just wanted to say... Thank you, everyone, for your kind comments, you really make my day a hundred times better nun
“He was out of his league, he should have waited, he should have...” her voice breaks and stamps her fist against the wall. Steve can see the little tremors in her body and he is by her side in a second, reaching for her hand, soothing the scratches
“I was drunk and a teenager! Get over it” she rolls her eyes, honestly all this situation is being ridiculous
“I’ll take him and go with the vice-president to keep him safe. Director Fury has to take other matters at hand so he left us to solve this, Tasha, you and Colonel Rhodes see to the Iron Patriot armor, anything they do it has to be related with the president” she pouts, she really wants to find Steve at once and to know that he is fine, but the rules are clear, they both agreed to them after all... civilians and victims first
“Guys! Come see this!” Clint and Nat look at each other, they put the jet in autopilot and go to the back, where Bruce is seeing the footage of Tasha’s Stark house being attacked by missiles that some brave reporter took from a nearby cliff
“Stark...” Is that moment when the engine in the Hellicarrier explodes and everyone inside the lab is thrown at every direction, Steve helps Tasha, getting a sniff of her perfume and feeling the softness of her body, leaving him lightheaded for a minute. Tasha isn’t better, getting to feel up close and personal 70 years of well-built muscles, a blush spreads in her face, rivalry momentarily forgotten; she feels a shyness she hasn’t felt since her years with Ty. “I’ll take your offer, put on the suit” the captain says as they leave the half-destroyed lab
Natasha was 14 when she first had sex, she was somehow in love with this Tiberius 'Ty' Stone kid, barely older than her for 3 years, so she let him convince her of giving her all; he broke her nose a month later during a fight, Rhodey broke both of his hands and Peggy made sure to destroy his life. She was 15 when she created JARVIS, she also met Pepper and decided that she would be her best female friend, and it was around the same time when both of them started working on Stark Industries while she pursued her second PhD; Natasha thought she knew everything about her father's industry so far, she created new weapons and sell them to the US army, she was really grateful to Obie for handling things there, she was wrong.
“Tasha” she corrects again “And I would be offended if it was the case, which it isn’t, uncle Nick has been bothering me with testing their security program, it just happens that now is a good time as any” she grins again but now with a devilishly glint that has Steve’s heart beating harder for second
“Yeah, I’ve noticed, working on it” she sounds a little breathless and Steve can only imagine that she is moving the rotors. Losing focus, Captain America slides off the railing, only managing to grab onto a loose cable at the very last minute
“Miss, take a deep breath” JARVIS says to her, before separating the gauntlet from the armor to use it as a lever so they can release her, the gauntlet attaches to her again and the repulsors start firing “Flight power restored” he informs her as he takes them both out of the water and onto the sky.
“Cognitive recalibration it seems” he answers with the tiniest grin on his face looking at Nat, Tasha turns to her with a raised eyebrow
“Spill it out, do you know what they did to my suit?” Rhodey asks pointing a gun to his head just for precaution
The Captain follows the trail, jumping over two bridges, he has to shake his head and stabilize himself when he gets to the other side cause he still feels a little bit dizzy, a soldier is going to attack him when an arrow goes through his skull, Hawkeye looks panicked for a minute but then his attention get held up by another AIM guard, they are endless, and with the ones barely injured healing by the minute, the fight is getting harder and harder. Steve sees over the bridge that Tasha is headed to a dangerous stop
“Well... my mom already left for the dinner, and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers... I guess he won ‘cause that was six years ago” he says in a more timid voice, she crosses her arms
“You are leaving again?” she chooses to ignore the older man's reprimind. All and all it wasn’t weird for the doctor to travel to strange places, Bruce left for good 3 months at least twice before, she still pouts, but he just tosses her hair affectionately
“You think I was aiming for the bulb? Come on, you can’t hit a bulb at this distance” she says, Rhodey stands up only to shoot the lamp and shatter it, he sends her a look ”Show off” she mutters. A voice on the speaker alerts everyone about them “Ok, here’s what I’m going to do, save my spot, ready?” she says before standing to take a look and sits down immediately
“Okay, what have we got here?.... His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle meaning ‘advisor to the king’, has South American insurgency tactics, talks like a Baptist preacher, there’s lots of theater going on here” she makes a motion of closing some information windows
“It’s a stabilizing agent” she waltz right in basking in the surprise looks “it means that the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at SHIELD and it can stay open as long as Loki wants” she walks next to Thor and pats him in the arm “No hard feelings point break, you’ve got a mean swing” three pairs of wide eyes follow her walk to the crew “Uh... raise the mid-mast, ship the topsails” she says clearly having her fun. Romanov hides an amused smile “That man is playing Galaga! Thought we wouldn’t notice but we did” the genius looks awfully pleased with herself as she covers her eye and looks around “How in hell does uncle Nick do this?”
"The Helicarrier is failing... Cap! stop falling for Tasha and help her out of the turbine!! and... Tasha! stop flirting with Cap and go help the rest of the crew!" -Fury at some point, probably
“There’s only so much I can do Miss when you give the world’s press your home address” JARVIS deadpans and Steve sends her a look, she rolls her eyes. She has a little bit of oil in her face, probably there’s also in her loose bun, her eyes have bags from all the all-nighters and nightmares and her demeanor in general is quite messy. Steve thinks she looks beautiful, her eyes fired up with determination
?” Tasha raises an eyebrow in a silent question “Don’t even try to pretend, you scared the hell out of us last time with your screams, and I know for a fact there’s a reason you are refusing to close your eyes for more than 10 minutes, so who is gonna be? Me or Clint? I would add Bruce but we know how moody he gets if he don’t rest well...” Banner’s grateful for her not mentioning how posible is to hulk-up if he cuddles with Tash in a bad night “And I don’t trust you at all to sleep with Rogers” the soldier slightly blushes
“Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?” she hears Dr. Banner ask and takes that as her entering cue
“A terrorist, he calls himself ‘The Mandarin’” Tasha answers before taking the call she knew it was comming right after “Hey platypus, the love of my life”
“Yeah, mind if you let me catch my breath? just be quiet for a moment” she tenses feeling as if the world closes on her as if she is back to space
The fight starts, Clint shoots arrow after arrow and Tasha and Rhodey shoot until they are out of ammo, more AIM fighters come from the inside of the ship
“Yeah, it’s seen a bit of mileage and you’ve got the blue stick of destiny. Would you like a drink?” she asks reaching a shelf full of bottles
“Yeah, but I got you first, winghead” she answers sweetly, a lovestruck expression on her face that makes Rogers blush slightly “Get your shield, we can’t stay here” she says getting up, another missile impacts on the side of the house, sending her to the side of the window knocking the sofa in her fall, Steve turns to her “Move! I’m right behind you” Tasha jumps the couch, but before she can reach Steve, the floor between them falls apart, Steve looks at her with determination on his eyes
“So... on the bright side we have Hawkeye back and nobody died, that’s great” Natasha stands from her seat and hugs herself, deep in thought, trying to avoid the little voice in her head saying ‘
Tasha start fighting with the thunder god, at some point a lightning hits her and knocks her on her back
Which is why she's at their door, wondering for a bit if he would be happy to see her, if it's okay for her to invade their privacy. She knocks anyway, the anxiety to see if he and Nat are fine stronger than her doubts. Nat opens and lets her in, Clint is sitting in a small bed, he looks at her and tries to smile but he falls short, Tasha's heart breaks a little at the sight
“Oh what can I say? Rhodey, my love, I’m weak for men in spandex” he can hear her smug grin all the way to the midle East
“Hi, everyone, my name is Trevor, Trevor Slattery, I know I’m shorter in person, a bit smaller, everyone says that, but, um, hey, if you’re here to arrest me, there are some people I’d like to roll on”
“Last year earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town, we learned that not only we are not alone but that we are hopelessly, hilariously outgunned” Thor looks like he wants to protest but Fury isn’t done “and Asgardians are not the only one out there right? You’re not the only threat either, the world’s filling with people who can’t be controlled”
“The president is safe, but we got a situation here... some of the soldiers... are young, very young” everyone looks horrified by the implication those words carry “We got them in custody, they are pretty scared and it's hard to keep them in control so they don’t overheat”
"You are so dramatic sometimes Katniss, I swear" she chuckles "Besides you can't have any pasta without me birdbrain, you know the rules!" she says in mock dismay, the assassins can even see the grin in her voice
’ “You know? For the first 30 minutes I actually thought you’d show up, and the next hour... I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby 'cause you had mock me... I was such a little thing that the great and spoiled Natasha Stark had mocked me, it was ridiculous at best and humiliating at worst... but as I looked out over that city, nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me, no one was even looking, and that gave me a thought that would guide me for years to come... Anonymity Tash, thanks to you and your pretty eyes, it’s been my mantra ever since, you simply rule from behind the scenes, because the second you give evil a face, a Bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, you hand the people a target... you have met him I assume”
“That... was your fault, you spazzed me out” she takes her jacket and baseball cap “Back to business, where were we?” she sniffs “About the guy that died, relatives? Mom? Mrs. Davis, where is she?” she asks a little more urgently that she initially intends, but she whishes to change the subject as soon as possible
The Avengers arrive at the scene and there's a surprise for them, meanwhile, Tasha decides to investigate the little town of Rose Hill, what could go wrong?
“We are good, and you’re.... you’re... you’re right on top of me, get off, I made it, I’m fine” Happy stands up and straights his hair and suit, he starts to ask explanations to Maya when the people outside starts yelling “Hey! Happy New Year” Tasha exclaims, prompting the other two to do the same “Alright, I’ll see you in the morning, good night” she shakes her bodyguard’s hand and shushes him outside the room "Now... Where were we?"
“This is the Mandarin?” Clint asks incredulously, Rhodey has a face that Tasha can’t stop snickering at
“Of course not, he went to propose a business partnership, also I’m quite certain that he might be sweet on you instead, he looked very disappointed when I told him you weren’t joining us” Pepper crosses her arms “Thanks for calling by the way, we could go to the city to have breakfast you know?” Tasha winces
In which the Hulk gets hired as an emergency paramedic, Steve finds a new home and everything ends well
She enters to the national security contractors network and writes Rhodey’s info, with a little bit of her hacking skills she is already seeing all the AIM’s information, including some kind of proyect where there are videos of people, she clicks the first one of Chad Davis, then the video of the woman who attacked her earlier... but that's imposible since the woman in the video only has one arm but the one who she fight with had both, the camera cuts to the man who is speaking and she recognizes him... maybe she wasn’t as drunk as everyone thought because that’s definitely Aldrich Killian, next, she watches the video named:
“He’s a chunky monkey, let’s get him” she flies close enough that one man can grab him, then she makes her best to decrease the speed as she lets them fall to the sea, all the passengers cheer “Nice work guys!, excellent, good team effort all around, yeah... go us!” she cheers as well “Now... lets go get Steve-” her armor gets hit by a truck and the parts separate “Fuck... that came out of nowhere” she takes her Artificial reality helmet
"You can save yourself from a 200 feet fall, but you need help to escape a group of investors?" he teases, she subtly sticks her tongue out, prompting a smirk from the soldier
“Hi, nice to meet you Captain America" he gets closer with his hands on his back "You know? For the guy Tasha is infatuated with, I was expecting something... better” he says and Steve remembers, Tasha! He and Maya were after her
"Apparently you’re waiting for someone else yeah?” the lady nods once, the genius takes a quick glance at the file, her eyes fixiating on the marker letter MIA for a second “Mrs. Davis, I must tell you, your son didn’t kill himself, and I guarantee you, he didn’t kill anyone... but someone used him... as a weapon” the woman looks flabbergasted
“Would you mind signing my drawing on his behalf?” she asks and shows her a drawing of the Iron Man armor flying in the sky
“Take it easy Tash” suddenly the world is spinning and all the sounds seem to grow louder, she inhales sharply as the voice of the kid next to Erin whispers to her
“I wanted to say that I’m very sorry about your loss” she truthfully says “But I want to know what you think happened”
“That’s just half of the problem, we got a lot more soldiers that are healing and I don’t doubt some of them are going to blow real soon” Hawkeye warns
“You are wrong Tash, I’m a visionary, but I do own a maniac and he takes the stage tonight” he gets close to her again and touches her face, the CEO doesn’t flinch by pure force of will “I’d love to continue with our business, but I have some important things to do, you know? As an act of goodwill I’ll let you model and construct your own EXTREMIS, how about that? Sounds good, right? see you later love” Killian says as he finally leaves
“Nothing?” Tasha tilts her head once more, looking completely innocent as if she hadn’t risked her life just a second ago
“And you’ll get your cube back, no muss no fuss” she smiles brightly while looking a collection of secret SHIELD files, then... “What’s phase 2?”
“You are just a kid! A girl in a big suit of armor, take that off and you are only a little child” He snaps, but his words lose some of the severity because of the furious blush in his face, Nat looks at both of them and raise an eyebrow, Banner partially ignored
“Fucking hot ass zombies!” Rhodey adds repulsing another, he can’t take the President by himself, that's how critical the situation is, even the Hulk has trouble keeping up with the soldiers, his problem being the extreme temperatures they can reach, burning him greatly. Clint gets an idea and grabs an armor that’s flying near, by its feet, he climbs to it’s back with great effort and talks into the AI's comms
“Miss?” a voice calls her, but Tasha is swimming in darkness and confusion, an extremely loud sound takes her out into consciousness “Miss!”
sorry about the small hiatus, it was a crazy week, but I'm back hopefully with a chapter every night.
“Sorry, not feeling quite well kids, I’ll... give Iron Man your regards” and she stomps to the alley exit, pushing the other customers, she just want to get out, because there’s not enough air, she’s back at the wormhole, back at the space and it’s cold, she is surrounded by monsters and she can’t breath and she can’t just stop shaking. When she gets to the back alley, she stammers to the Iron Man suit parked in the shadows, she can’t get there faster, and she is going to choke, it doesn’t matter that she’s on earth, the air is not enough and she can’t breath and she is going to die and....
“Excuse me, Miss, I don’t know who...” she turns and makes a 'shhh' motion and gives her best press smile “Mom I need to call you back something magical is happening” the man sings as has the look of a fan-girl “Tasha Stark is in my van” he says too excitedly
“No more false faces, you guys wanted the Mandarin well... you’re looking right at him” The Avengers take fight stance “It was always me... right from the start... I am the Mandarin!” he shouts before being repulsed away, the guys turn to the side and Steve’s breath stops for a moment, because there is Natasha Stark, breathing heavily with her gauntlets and iron boots on, her hair completely down, more bruises and cuts than anyone could count and a limb on one of her legs
“Just breathe, really, just take slow and deep breaths, you’re a mechanic right? You fix things right? You said so”
“Three minutes at best, you gotta stay low and wipe out the missile” the 'please be careful' remains unsaid as uncle Nick gets cut out from the network, she snarls
“Clint, tell me when we are close to change your sit, I need to get my weapons ready” Steve can notice the meaningful undertone in that phrase, prompting a shiver to go down his spine, and with good reason, he notices, when she turns to him and while getting her already prepared gun out, she says “So... you seem to be quite worried about our favorite genius, you know, after what happened in the lab...” Steve gulps, the surviving part of his mind prays to God that they arrive at New York soon before Nat actually finds the way to kill a super-soldier
“Yeah, you do that” he almost hears the smug smile in Iron man’s face. The Quinjet shakes as thunder roars around it, Steve notice Loki looking worryingly outside the window
“Nice! Tell him to suit up, I’m bringing the party to you guys” Steve can see her coming out from behind a building, the Chitauri Leviathan follows her impatiently
“Do you know how did Iron Man got out of the wormhole?” that makes it, that sentence, no, that word makes her snap, she gasps and gets up, she is pale as a paper sheet, with her last breath she whispers
“I can assure you.... I was better at taking care of myself when I was five” she deadpans again without thinking
“So... you are the other person that was excited to meet me?” Tasha stops laughing and blushes deeply, Steve can’t stop himself from falling a little bit from that adorable vision
“No... Killian only wants to start a war, I bet he doesn’t even care” she has a displease look on her face “I mean, is it too much to ask for a villain with actual good motives?” Rhodey smiles at her and her easy going attitude
I hope you like it and I would love to read your thoughts. I wanted to say thank you to all of you and send a special hug to the ones who commented last time.
“Tash, I...” Steve had tried to tell her about the recent, more than friendly, feelings that he had been developing for his best friend, but at that moment the genius had become a death weight as her breath turned more profound, that could only mean one thing: she had fallen asleep. The next morning the youngest member of the group of heroes had the worst hangover, with no recollection of the last night... or at least that was what Steve thought until now... because if what Pepper said was true, and based on Tasha's reaction, that was likely the case, Natasha was sober... so... so... why did she kissed him? and even worst... why did she stop?
“In five, four, three, two, one!” finally, the gauntlet enters through the window and accommodates itself in her hand, she fires the repulsor to one of the guards “Told ya” she snaps the straps and starts fighting as the part of her legs and her arm arrives “Hey... where’s the rest?” more men appear on the hallway and Tasha repulse herself in the air with one boot and one gauntlet just like old times, and starts shooting to them alternating the machine gun with her beams, she kicks all the guards’ asses in the most badass Natasha Stark way. She turns and aims at the last man standing, making him toss his weapon in fear and awe
“I’m seeing them right now honey” she tells him watching as the newly renamed Iron Patriot stands next to the President “I liked war machine by the way, oh Colonel my Colonel did you had to sell them the armor? I mean couldn’t you at least pick another colors?” she acts like she is fainting making her companions to roll their eyes
“When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?” Hill asked with a raised eyebrow, Tasha beamed proudly at her
"Pot, meet kettle" Nat sounds completely amused and Tasha can say with all security that she has missed this, not the battle, but spending time with her favorite spies
“I just did” he says teasing her already disheveled hair “Nat is resting in the living room with Clint, I decided to check on you since JARVIS told me you have been up since 72 hours?”
“So you’re saying that the Hulk... the other guy... saved my life?” she nods sightly “That’s nice, it’s a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?” Bruce can’t stop the bitterness in his tone
“Miss, the suit is not combat ready” JARVIS warns her, the hud show ‘system failure’. The machine-gun fires at her again, she takes a little missile of the suit and tosses it in another helicopters direction and fires her repulsor beam making it explode. Outside, Steve has to put his shield up as one of the other choppers fires non-stop at him and Maya, he can see one of them flying out of control in the house direction, he can’t move or he is going to put the scientist in danger
“I thought they were your plan B” Tasha ends next to her friend after helping him get rid of the woman and tips her head to the horizon, Rhodey look in that direction and his eyes go wide
’ expression showing, the woman sighs, stands and walks to her “Look, a lot has happened Tash, but I’m close... EXTREMIS is practically stabilized just...”
Tasha was 20, almost 21, looking like 17 when Agent (almost uncle) Coulson went to the newly Stark tower to ask for her help with a special Avengers mission, she agreed after some coercion from Pepper (while internally fangirling about Captain America, recently defrosted, and Bruce Banner being in the team) and put herself to research Selvig's work.
“Uncle Fury, as much as I like you, I don’t really trust that much in spies and right now I have a lot on my plate” the girl made a pause, she didn't mention that she would rather talk to aunt Peggy before making any decision “I can be a consultant if you like”
Natasha Antonia Stark was 12 when Obadiah allowed her to start going to parties, she was the Stark heir so she couldn't be hidden forever. At her 13th birthday she drank alcohol for the first time, nobody was seeing her, she was curious and an older boy named Ty managed to steal some, so why not? she blushed when the other kid praised her for trying it.
"This thing on? ... Hey Spangles, if you find ever this recording, don't feel bad about this, I want you to know that I'm sorry, sorry for being reckless, stupid, irresponsible... I know that you loved me like that nonetheless, but I'm sorry... because this time, thanks to that I won't be able to go home sorry honey. Don't worry, being lost in space with zero promise of rescue is more fun than it sounds... Food and water ran out four days ago... Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning and that'll be it" she sighs "When I drift off I'll dream about you, because, it's always you... It has always been about you... I trust you will take good care of little Peggy Stark Rogers for me" Tasha's voice cracks a little thinking about her 3 months old baby daughter "I love you Steve... see you in the other side" she cuts the transmission and lays down, a single tear falls down as she waits for the end to come
The sun starts raising by the time she’s done; she is on her way to the terrorist location when her, recently bought, phone rings, she looks at it curiously, there’s only one person she knows capable of tracking her that fast
“Stop it! You are gonna freak me out” she snaps feeling as her breath gets knock out, she’s out of oxygen, and her palms are sweaty even in the cold, she stands up and starts walking “Ah man, you did it, didn’t you? Are you happy now?” she asks without really wanting an answer, she just has to get away from that crater, that crater that resembles too much like... too much like... she makes an unhuman effort so she doesn’t run and completely looses it, she takes her jacket, panting, letting herself to finally collapse in the snow, she bends and her face feels the cold soft substance, reminding her that she is on earth, not up there, there are no aliens, she is alright
"I know it is" Cap says, he looks down to his daughter favorite ribbon that somehow survived her turning to dust, and a picture of Tasha the day of their wedding that he has on his compass, she was always beautiful, but that has been the most gorgeous he had ever see her "Cause I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't"
“Well thats going to be a problem” she flies and grabs the first person “Relax, I’m going to save you... what’s your name?" she looks at her tag "Heather? Hey, listen to me, see that guy? I’m gonna swing by and you’re just gonna grab him, you got it?” the woman can barely answer when Tasha flies down again, the woman screams “Relax, I’m going to electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand, ready? Let's do this, Heather” she manages to grab the other man after two tries “Easy, right? Eleven more to go” she hovers to the next one “Remember that game called barrel of monkeys? Well that’s we’re going to do”
“Right” she whispers, she takes out her cell phone and sees a message from ‘almost uncle’ Coulson “Oh look, apparently the President is safe on the air force along with Colonel Rhodes... huh... curious... I thought Rhodes was next to me... Ah! You are here! it must be your long lost twin!” Rhodey looks at her unamused by her antics
“Remind me again how your fortune was made? You have no right to talk here about this” Nicks says and she, and Steve, looks outraged
"No..." her voice becomes barely a whisper "That... no! she isn't-" Steve freezes, a top spy like Romanov doesn't act like that, not unless... Clint lets out a sob. But Steve... Steve's a soldier, he can't have another innocent youngster die on him, he just can't, he can't take it. He relieves on Captain's America cool and collected mindset, but before he can do anything, like CPR, the Hulk roars in fury and pain, the noise startles Tasha alive, who takes a huge and panicky gasp
“I wasn’t, I called and Happy updated me” she sends Tasha a suspicious look, she raises her hands “I swear I wasn’t spying, I’m just worried, who is this guy? You like him? Is he sweet on you?”
Steve watches as Tasha flies the missile with a feeling of dread, she is so young, she doesn’t deserve this, he doesn’t want her to do this, he wants to keep seeing those beautiful chocolate eyes, that little energy she showed at the lab, he hasn’t even had the chance to draw her or get to know her better. A weight is clutching his heart, he has to blink back some tears as he continues to fight aliens. Suddenly all the Chitauri soldiers and Leviathans keel over and begin to shake, then stop and fall over. She made it, Tasha saved them, Steve smiles just a little, hoping that this is a true victory and she comes soon to them. The Avengers looks at the portal begging for their little genius to return, slowly, oh so slowly, Steve Rogers counts to 15, even to 20 seconds, Thor and himself see as the supernova threatens to pass through the hole, they have to stop it before it can cause damage to the city. Captain America makes the choice
“Why were you at the house tonight?” Steve kindly asks to the scientist while driving to the hotel “What was so important that you had to speak to Tash about it?” he can hear as she takes a sharp breath
btw, the little and subtle change of pronouns when Steve talks to Iron man is because he doesn't knows he is actually a she at this point (hope that makes sense)
“Yeah, yeah fine, I’ll stay with you tonight beautiful widow, I don’t want to wake up covered in green woo like the last time” she promptly glares at Clint who just dies laughing
“She’s six! Anyway it’s a limited edition so treat it well. Hey so when can we talk about New York?” he asks as they walk side by side to a dead end street
Since the beginning, Pepper and Happy had had a soft spot for the young genius.... that also means that both of them love to tease her relentlessly
With the god secured in the Quinjet, all of them proceed to return to the Helicarrier, Tasha keeps her eyes on their prisoner the whole time and if she is internally bouncing for being next to her childhood hero, well only she and probably her dear Nat knows about it
“Yeah I get that, you two are cute together” Tasha scrunches her nose sweetly “We are already talking so fill me in, what’s going on with Peps?”
Everyone in the debrief room has a look of numb shock in their faces, Tasha is out of her armor, her head resting in her holding hands and her mind running a mile per hour, she struggles to summary all the variables after seeing the footage of the different rooms
“I’ll be in India this time, there’s a major component of my research there, and if I can be of help well...” Tasha nods but keeps the pout “I’ll be back in a few months” Bruce offers
So... the 'Avengers Endgame' trailer is already out huh? it's so sad already, it would be a shame to...
“I like you, you know? A fierce woman, you might be a good addition to the throne..." a little shiver runs down her spine at his words, it doesn't show "but before that, I can assure you, your friends won't even be having time for me, since they’ll be busy fighting you” Loki taps Tasha on her chest with his scepter, a ping sounds the moment the magic staff touches the reactor but nothing happens, Loki tries again but still the energy dissipates doing nothing. “Weird... it usually works” she smirks this time
The one where Tasha "I can't roll my eyes harder" Stark, has to learn to not judge a book by its cover
“The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig’s reports on the Tesseract. But it’s gonna take weeks to process” Bruce low-key whines
“Happy, Happy, you don’t want my help to woo Pepper okay? You can do that on your own, remember how I tried? And failed? Miserably at that? Yeah, you can do that alone” she makes a pause, then “A giant brain really?"
“I’ll see you up there then!” the man yells but she doesn’t hear him, she has a hotter date after all
“You... you want to make her your trophy” Steve spits the words with weak anger, the man only smiles. At that moment the Iron Patriot armor comes into the room, Killian completely ignores him in favor of turning to the newcomer
“You know I can help” she exclaims as quietly as possibly “Just ask, I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile suit, I...I got a bomb disposal, it even catches explosions mid-air”
“Some people call me a terrorist, I consider myself a teacher...” her scowl deepens, she can feel her family joining her in the living room “America. Ready for another lesson? In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado the US military wited until the friendly Cheyenne braves had all gone hunting, waited to attack and slaughter the families left behind and claim their land. 39 hours ago, the Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked... I did that. A quaint military church filled with wives and children of course, the soldiers were out on manoevres, the braves were away, President Ellis. You continue to resist my attemps to educate you, sir, and now you’ve missed me again” another scene with men yelling while guns fire them “You know who I am, but you don’t know where I am. And you’ll never see me coming” The transmition ends and Tasha lets out a breath she didn’t know she was holding, almost inmidiately after the video, the news begins
“Of course! Better clench up Legolas” the smirk is obvious even without seeing her face. He goes to her and passes an arm behind her neck so she can lift him with the armor
“Where?” Nat asks raising an eyebrow, she knew Tasha would work fast to know where Loki was but she didn’t expect it to be this fast
“See.. that’s you being helpful” Harley points the direction she needs to go “So.. wait for me here” she says him and walks to a bar in the middle town she crashes with an elegant lady and stops to give her wallet, she was a little odd but hey, Tasha Stark ain’t judging. As she enters she can feel the christmasy atmosphere, she looks around until she sees an older woman who doesn’t looks like in a merry spirit “Mrs. Davis?” Tasha asks getting closer, the woman looks up to her with a tired expression “May I join you?”
“Tasha...” she corrects and adds “After not letting me die in that turbine I think you can try to call me by my name” Steve internally agrees
“You know... I’ve got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart” she points at her arc reactor in her chest “This stops it, this little circle of light. It’s part of me now, not just an armor, but without it, I would have never become Iron man, you know? it’s a.... a terrible privilege actually” Bruce sees for the first time a maturity that shouldn't be in a 20-year-old, not even a genius 20-year-old
And since all of her theories result being true, or at least most of them, it’s not a surprise when she finds Selvig activating the device that’s holding the Tesseract
“Thanks, it's an honor to meet you as well” she beams at him, thinking how fun her next hours are going to be. Fury enters the room then interrupting Tasha’s train of thought
“He does... but what he also got is an ACME dynamite kit that it’s gonna blow up in his face and I’m gonna be there when it does” she grins and Bruce half smirks
“Aldrich Killian, seriously? How do you even know about him? Are you checking on me?” Pepper mocks indignation
Outside, the Hulk throws two AIM guards off the bridge he is in and one of them falls and starts a mechanism that moves the cargo machine with Tash on top of it
“Yes and I’m not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I’d like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction"
“Well that settles it, Steve is going to go with Stark so he can take care of any difficulty she might came across with” Tasha just. Gapes. At. Them. While Steve looks oh so smug about it.
“Hmmm I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all SHIELD’s secure files” she says zooming into another hologram. The soldier blanks for a beat
“Yeah right, you know that’s biologically impossible Stark, the human body can’t be without sleep for more than 10 days, and last time I checked, you were still a human and not a cyborg” she rolls her eyes once again “We are concerned about you Tash, I’m concerned about you, maybe it’s a good idea Rogers came with you after all you know?” she looks at him with deep betray in her eyes
A little while after Killian leaves, Tasha is contemplating all the possible, and maybe the impossible as well, ways to get to Steve when the watch Harley gave her beeps, indicating that it's time to start her escape plan. One of the guards takes it and shakes it, trying to quiet the noice
“I’m not a kid, old man” Tasha smiles and then assures him “We are going to get back at him, I promise, we’ll stop him”
“What is this I hear about an orgy? If I weren’t happily married I’ll totally participate” Clint thinks about it for a second and adds “I think I can ask Laura though” Tasha elbows him laughing
“To tear us apart...” he concedes, Natasha dislodges herself from Steve’s hands and starts pacing, her mind racing
“Eat” is all she says, Tasha rolls her eyes but makes a grateful sound “So... who you want to sleep tonight with
“Shut up, you didn’t even were on the ‘80s” Rhodey pouts “All right, WAR MACHINE ROX, with an x, all caps” Tasha faintly hears some chuckles and she laughs as well “Yeah yeah okay”
“Ah, so you must be Captain America” the man says cleaning his bleeding nose and jaw, Rogers can see how the cuts are cured almost instantly “Don’t even try to fight it, Extremis is more difficult to control than your super-serum so the tranquilizers are stronger and denser than what your metabolism can burn, you are going to black out in a matter of seconds, by now your body must be feeling very relaxed” the worst thing was that it did, his body was relaxing even without his concentment, then the man turns to look to Maya “Mind telling me why you where at Tasha’s tonight?”
“Screw you spangles, I was worried sick, you owe me a dinner” is it weird that Steve’s heart flutters in that same moment despite everything?
Steve rapidly goes back to his teammates to help, uses his shield to hit oncoming Chitauri soldiers, it quickly becomes too much for them though, fortunately after a few minutes a lightning strikes down from the sky, channeling the blast, firing the electricity out of the aliens around them. They're blasted back in a massive shockwave, the Chitauri convulse to then drop dead to the ground. Thor lands right beside them
“Yeah... who might that be?” she innocently says “It’s not the ‘80s, nobody says hack anymore granpa” she snorts
“My family, sweetheart, and that includes you too” Natasha does her best to prevent herself from blushing hard
“Coulson arrived, he is taking care of the remaining soldiers on the other side of the ship along with his baby agents” she looks to all the sides “Where’s Tash?” Steve feels a pain in his chest too big to put it into words, but before anyone can answer, they hear metal bending noises, they turn around and Killian is walking through the flames, quite burned and glowing bright, hot orange, but very alive “You gotta be kidding me” Nat whispers
In the TV pictures of people dying and screaming are shown, then a older man appears, he has his hair tied in a man bun and is using glasses, his voice is deep and cold when he speaks
“Yeah, yeah, him, ever since he fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day, you know what I mean?”
“Let’s start with that stick of his, it may be magical but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon for comfort”
She puts play to the records and they can see Loki, the god of mischief stand up at the Hulk, "Enough! All of you are beneath me! I'm a God, you dull creature, and I will not be bullied..." his rant stops short when the Hulk starts smashing him against the floor like a ragdoll. When the god's good as a pancake, he steps away muttering “Punny god”, and Tasha and Steve just about die laughing
“Don’t even think about it” Tasha gently advise the man but he just smirks and stomps on the cute little watch “Hey! That’s rude! It wasn’t mine to give away” she scolds, her armor must be arriving any minute now and, if the shadow that passed in front of the window 5 minutes ago is any indication, her back up just arrived “It was of my little brother’s sister, and that’s why I’m gonna have to kill you first”
Soon Tasha arrives at a mansion full of security, she quickly creates a plan, runs, jumps the wall and then she is in. She creeps quietly behind the stairs to hit a man in his neck, making him fall on his face, she then takes a little hand-made gun and shoots to a man on his side so she can knock him, the man that comes to her is tased by her own invention, she throws a christmas-bomb to two guards and shoot the one standing, she gets to enter the house that looks just as trashed as one of her home vacation in a party when she was 16, full of drunk women, bottles and more than two types of posible drugs laying around, not much like the typical terrorist hide-out, she comes close to a guard that’s talking to one of the girls and electrocutes him with her glove, she takes the gun in the table, the girl on the couch is so high or drunk that she only makes a mimic gunshot as Tasha makes a quiet motion, she enters a room with a lot of monitors and cameras, at the end of the room there’s a bed with two surprised girls on it, they hear a toilet flushing and Tasha hides behind a wall, a man’s voice with english accent rings in the room
"I'm incredibly proud to announce that Stark Industries will be broadening our horizons. While we are famous for creating technology that many people carry around in their pockets, we want to create a different type of everyday technology. As a company, we want to expand to produce life-changing medical technology, such as prosthetics and implants. We want to change people's lives, and we want these changes to be affordable. We aim to work with people who need this technology, in order to make it the best that we can be."
"I'll never leave you," Nat replied, taking the vodka away from Tony. "And neither will Pepper. You're stuck with us both now, until the day you die!"
"We're worried about you, dude," Sam said. "Just come out with us and we'll leave you alone to wallow in your sorrows for the rest of the week."
"I know you're in there, Steve," a familiar voice shouted from outside. "Ignoring us won't make us go away."
"My life's a mess and I'd really like to forget about it all for a while. No better way to forget than with alcohol," Tony replied.
"You really don't have to do that," Steve argued. "Spend the night with Sam, I know it's date night. I'll be fine."
"Okay, stop being a sap and start drinking! If I can still remember my own name in half an hour, I'll be bitterly disappointed," Tony said, motioning for Nat to hand him the alcohol.
"I haven't been able to stop thinking about you. I've missed you so much I can't even put it into words. I wish more than anything that I could have you back. I know you've moved on and I'm happy for you, but it still hurts. It hurts so much," Steve barely got to the end of his sentence before tears started rolling down his cheeks.
do," Pepper replied. "But the morons who write these articles don't. I'll put a statement out to clear everything up. I'll make it clear that you're not dating and that she had nothing to do with your breakup with Steve. Sound good?"
Tony could hardly believe his eyes. Steve was still in love with him! He had to text Steve back, and he had to do it right then. He knew that both Pepper and Nat would disapprove, but he really didn't care what they thought.
"Right now?" Steve asked. Bucky handed Steve his phone and glared at him until he started typing. Steve wasn't even sure what to say. He had a little bit more to drink, in the hope that some Dutch courage would help him figure out what the fuck to say.
"I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry," Steve said, stumbling over his words almost as much as he stumbled over his feet.
When Tony emerged into the hallway and saw Steve struggling to put his sneakers on, he felt a wave of emotion bubble up inside of him. At first, he thought he might explode like some sort of emotional volcano, but he didn't. He wanted to speak, but he didn't know what to say. Meanwhile, Steve simply looked like a deer that had been caught in headlights. He didn't dare to move, or speak, or even breathe.
Tony wasn't being particularly choosy when he picked a club to dance at, but he must have picked a decent one. He couldn't remember the name of the club, but the neon lights filled him with energy, the music filled him with happiness, and the alcohol gave him a buzz. He wasn't drunk, not yet, but he was definitely tipsy. Tipsy was good. For Tony, tipsy meant confident and fun. Drunk meant sloppy, emotional, and out of control. The music inspired Tony to go dance, which wasn't something he did very often. He found a handsome man that looked about his age and pulled him onto the dancefloor. They danced together for a while, but he reminded Tony too much of Steve. After a while, he decided to start dancing with girls instead to avoid the heartache and the memories. He found a pretty girl who went by the name of Skye and decided to spend the rest of the evening dancing with her. Sometime in between dancing and drinking, she kissed him. Sometime in between drinking and dancing, he kissed her. Sometime before 1 am, they left together.
True to his word, when Steve got home he pulled out his phone to install Grindr. While the app was downloading, he decided to scroll through social media. He didn't have a reason behind it, he just wanted to see if his friends were doing anything interesting. As it turns out, they were. His friend Sharon was on a date with her new girlfriend. Steve didn't know her personally, but she was pretty. A redhead. Sharon sure did have good taste. Steve scrolled past to see what his other friends were doing. Scott and Hope were having a movie night, watching some obscure sci-fi film. Steve carried on scrolling, hoping Grindr was almost finished installing. Carol and her wife Maria were looking after their daughter, Monica. Steve kept scrolling. Surely Grindr had to have installed by now. That's when he saw it. Tony. Tony was out with someone else. A girl, to be precise. Tony was out with a girl. They couldn't have been friends, he had his arm around her waist, pulling her close. She was beautiful and glamorous, she must have been a supermodel or something. No wonder Tony hadn't texted or called Steve. He was too busy. He'd moved on to someone much, much prettier. Steve felt physically sick. He could picture the things Tony was doing with his new toy. All the things he should be doing with Steve. The more Steve thought about it, the more ill he felt. She was a brunette. Did Tony even like blondes? Did he even like men? Was their whole relationship a lie? Steve felt like he could burst into tears at any given moment, so he called the one person who would always be there for him.
"I know we were," Tony said, hoping that Steve would just shut up. It was so much harder for him, having to listen to Steve regret everything that had happened the night before.
'Of course it wouldn't,' Tony thought. 'Because you hate me.' Neither of them spoke for a while, but Steve's apology felt heavy. It weighed them both down, to the point where they thought they might drown in their own emotions. Steve in his guilt, Tony in his sadness.
"Yeah, it's that bad," Steve said. There was a comfortable silence for a few seconds before Steve spoke again, this time a lot quieter. "You're the best, Buck."
"If we were sober, it never would've happened!" Steve said, almost as if he was trying to justify his drunken mistakes. 'Because you hate me,' the unspoken ending of the sentence hung in the air between the two, not quite reaching Tony and not quite escaping Steve.
"I thought you knew the right way to turn the tap on," Tony said, feeling like an idiot because that was the only thing he could think to say. That seemed to snap Steve out of his trance, as he suddenly started rushing to get his shoes on and get out the door.
"Just go," Tony said, forcing the words past the lump in his throat. They cut Steve like a knife, but he accepted them nevertheless. He didn't say anything, there was nothing left to say. He just nodded and walked out the door, leaving everything he'd ever loved behind.
The rest of the night passed by in a blur and, true to his promise, Tony could hardly remember his own name. Luckily for both of them, Nat had only brought one bottle of vodka and they'd run out before they could cause any serious damage to either their liver or their memory. The sound of Tony's phone snapped them both pout of their drunken stupor. He wondered who it was, but assumed that whoever it was, they could probably wait. Then a little voice in the back of his mind said that it might be Steve. It was probably wrong, but it didn't hurt to check. Sure enough, there was a text from Steve. A sloppy, drunken text, but a text nonetheless.
"Just shut up," Bucky shouted from the kitchen. Steve could hear him rummaging through the cupboards and could only assume that he was looking for shot glasses.
Steve snapped out of his thoughts and his loneliness when he heard someone knock on his door. He didn't want to answer it, so he ignored it, in the hope that whoever it was would go away. They didn't. Instead, they knocked louder.
"I love you too, more than I can ever say. I'll always love you Tones," Steve said, as he pulled Tony closer and kissed him. The kiss felt like everything Steve had been missing. It was fierce and passionate, but also gentle and sweet. It was Tony, and Steve couldn't have been happier to have him back.
Steve knew he fucked up. He knew it from the moment he walked out of Tony's house and out of his life. As much as Steve hated to admit it, him and Tony were meant to be. Sure, they fought about dumb shit, but they could never actually stay mad at each other. Except this time. Steve couldn't see them making it back from this. This time, it was over. For good. Steve couldn't even remember what the argument had been about. It was something stupid and insignificant, it always was. Maybe the press had seen Tony out with someone else. Perhaps Tony was spending too much time at work and Steve was starting to feel like second-best. Tony might have become distant and Steve assumed he was cheating. Whatever it was, it pissed Steve off. It pissed him off enough to turn it into an argument. There was shouting and screaming. Steve called Tony a cheating slut, Tony called Steve an attention whore. Tony punched a wall, Steve slammed a door. Tony tried to calm down, make things right. Steve packed up all his things in a bag, told Tony he was leaving and not coming back. This time, there was no shouting, no slamming doors. Only a whisper, an unspoken apology, and the sound of a door clicking shut. All of a sudden, it was over. A relationship they'd built together for over a year came crashing down. All it left behind was silence.
