She was only young, probably about his age, with thick and vibrant red hair that Steve had caught himself staring at, mentally working out the composition of the paint he would have to mix to try and capture it. The first impression he'd gotten, though, when she told him to sit down and wait, was that she was older. A hostile if professional manner and a well-tailored outfit could do that to a person.

'Yes,' she said. 'I do.' Then, with an air of having made a decision, she pushed back her chair and walked over to him, high heels clicking efficiently over the floor. 'I am Mr Stark's personal assistant,' she said. 'But I am also
He was in his suit. It was a cheap, itchy polyester thing that always felt too hot, that he'd only ever worn for funerals. The jacket had gone to holes in the armpit and he'd had to hurriedly try and sew it back together; and the cut of it had been out of fashion when his mom had bought it for him almost seven years before. The tie had been his father's. The shirt and shoes were Bucky's, and no amount of folding and tucking or padding with socks could disguise the fact they were far too big for him. The ridiculous engagement ring on his finger was making his whole hand ache, and he was desperate to take it off, but couldn't. He was sitting in his uncomfortable suit on a small couch that had probably cost more than their apartment, just outside the heavy oak door to Howard Stark's personal office. Opposite him, a few steps away over a marble floor, Stark's PA kept glaring stonily at him.
'This isn't fair, Tony. Right now I need your support, not whatever this is.'
He had wondered whether Stark would really meet him at Shield, given that the man was one of their most wanted, but as he exited he found him already waiting outside, surrounded by a dozen unconscious agents and looking extremely nonchalant, as far as it was possible for a suit of armour to look nonchalant. As soon as he saw Steve, he started talking.
Race Across the World
. I bet you've done some stupid shit in your time.'
'He wasn't interested in Stark, sir. Everything he did before was for Peter's sake.'
before asking Santa to keep an eye on her and make sure she isn't cheating; or the bit when you ask for a stocking full of bullets for the boys. Honestly I'm not sure which is creepier. Probably the girl thing. But then, how many bullets would fit in a stocking anyway? Did you ever-'

'Open the door, Stark.'
'Make a Wish already drew up a confidentiality agreement,' Steve said quickly. 'No cameras, no publicity, no social media, no authorities-'
And then Steve realised he was still wearing the cowl, and most of his face was covered. He pulled it off.
'We need to go?' Steve asked, alert.
, managed to eat a bowl of cereal between them, and because Peter didn’t feel like getting up and getting dressed, had ended up staying cuddled up under blankets on the couch, playing on the Starkphone Peter had been given. The young boy was fascinated by YouTube playlists and had begged Steve to get an account so they could make one, which of course he had. They sat there listening to increasingly obscure songs as they went from related video to related video, every single one of them getting added to Peter’s playlist. Steve started to sing along despite not knowing the words, and Peter laughed, and Steve tried to share in it even though he noticed how out of breath Peter was getting. And at 11 o’clock, just as they were thinking about an early lunch, there was a knock on the door.
of December.'
'Where are we?' Steve asked, trying to squint down at the shops below.
'Steve?' Tony whispered, staring. 'You're here.'
Unresisting, still looking bewildered, he lay back down beside her. Peggy turned the lamp off and fought her own tiredness, hoping to hear the settling of his breathing that would mean he had gone back to sleep. Instead, not quarter of an hour later, she felt him rise and slip quietly out of the room, heading downstairs.
'You're right,' Tony said, sighing. 'These are
Jerking his arm upwards, Steve got out of his grip, shaking his head. 'You're sick.'
'Really.'
'Do you think this is how they got the recording?' Steve asked as they walked, his shield raised and ready. 'That it came through this rift thing?'
It happened towards the end of summer after he'd graduated high school. Out of nowhere he'd gotten a message from one of the art teachers, asking if he would consider life modelling for an evening class she was teaching, as he had an 'interesting body type'. He'd meant to disagree, he couldn't think of anything more humiliating than stripping off and letting strangers draw him, but at the time he had been trying to get more out of his comfort zone. It didn't hurt that Miss Rivers was only twenty-four, and although he had never been fortunate enough to be in her class, Steve had been nursing a crush on her for months. So he had gone, and tried not to feel too weird about it, and hoped to dear goodness that Bucky never found out about it, and at the end he had gone behind a screen to get dressed as the class filed out. Miss Rivers hadn't drawn him, just supervised. The next thing he knew, she had joined him behind the screen and he stood, frozen against a wall as her fingers went everywhere and did everything, and she kept asking him if he was okay, if it was good, if he wanted it, and he kept saying yes, because he was so damn touch starved, even though he would have preferred to have been touching her, even as a hot ball of shame started to fill him.
'Leave it,' Tony groaned.
But something was wrong, Steve could tell. Tony kept glancing at where Peter tossed and turned in the bed, and seemed to doubt himself as the hours wore on. Eventually Steve realised that Stark wasn't sure it had worked; that, or he had not expected Peter to be in so much pain. In the end, Stark left. Steve was left alone to sit and to wait, hoping that this would work.
Peter's eyes widened. 'I heard of you!' He blurted out, and slopped juice over his front. 'You're a scientist!'
'No!' Peter shouted, as he struggled. Mr Osborn was much bigger than him, but he was struggling to hold onto Peter's arm, and Peter was nearly free -
Steve and Tony looked uncertainly at each other. Pepper sighed, throwing her hands up.
'Worst moment? Since when has that been the worst moment?'
Steve considered this. It was true that he had known a lot of loss in his life, and he didn't really want to imagine losing anyone else, he wasn't sure he could take it. Knowing Peter was sick was painful enough, and he knew there was worse to come. He had no idea how he would handle it, how he would survive it. He knew, somewhere deep in his bones, that his life - or at least a large part of it – would end the moment Peter's did. But change it? Live his life without Peter? That was unimaginable. It was no life at all.
When he got in sight of the Sheriff's station he was surprised to see someone waiting out front for him, looking up at the building with interest. Things had been mostly peaceful in Timely since Fisk had gone and they had reached an understanding with Red Wolf's people, and Steve couldn't remember the last time someone had been waiting at the door for him.
Steve looked confused. 'Sick of what? I don't make a habit of attacking housekeepers, it was just-'
Stark said nothing, merely smirked again.
. It was
'Not a one,' he said, smiling, and went to get the coffee. The soft, warm light was still inside him, and glowing as bright as ever.
'Right. Thanks.'
, and Steve wouldn’t have known.
Everyone knew Tony, of course. He was rich, famous, a genius. The sort of kid the school liked to brag about having, the kid whose picture was on the front of every prospectus and advertisement, even though everyone knew he was only there because he had been thrown out of so many private schools for the rich elite that his parents had run out of other options. Steve didn't think they had ever even spoken before. They didn't have any classes together – heck, he wasn't sure Stark had classes with
“Yeah. So be careful please. That person is still out there.” Tony sighed, knowing that not only were he and Steve at risk, Anna might be a target as well. They had no way of knowing how long this person may have been working with Hammer.
“It was keeping her in check, ‘chere. But I just told her to fess up or I’d tell myself.” He scooped her up and sat her down on his lap, so they were facing each other.
plan. Where does a baby fit in? So the fact that Steve is standing on the patio of his lake house, claiming to be pregnant with his child has Tony completely baffled and confused.
“Anna – what –?” He stuttered, jumping down from the ceiling and looking from the explosion to his twin, who was still trying to make herself appear decent. She clenched her jaw. She had forgotten to tell Friday to keep her door lock and to prevent anyone else from getting in. Stark Tech was something she still wasn’t used to yet. “You and Amelia’s dad?”
“Of course.” She could respect that. He’d tell her when he was ready. No need to go snooping around. But she was Morgan Stark Rogers. Snooping was her middle name.
Everyone said they were moving too fast.
“That’s fine Winnie.” He assured her, kissing her cheek. “Can I ask why you changed your mind?”
“Our family?” Wanda inquired.
Suddenly, a flash of light filled the room and Thor and Loki appeared before them. Tony groaned as Thor had successfully ruined his floors with that entrance. Torunn rose from her seat first but Tony spoke up first. She noticed her father’s facial expression wasn’t particularly a happy one.
“Don’t say that.” Tony groaned. “I don’t want to ever think that.” Stephen lay back in bed and folded his arms behind his head, staring at the ceiling. Tony pulled himself up, using his elbow for support and resting his head in his hand.
They weren't but they hoped their marriage lasted and didn't end like the last ones.
'Well, we couldn't have done this, that's for sure,' Steve said, and actually cracked a smile. 'Been in love. Out in the open.'
On the whole, being snowed in was turning out not to be so bad. Although he couldn't get drunk, the mulled wine seemed to have soothed Bucky, shaved off some of the sharp edges from months of busy city life and the long car journey up. He had loosened up and seemed content to sit in the squashy old arm chair, joking and laughing with them, occasionally looking away from his guests and up at the boughs of the Christmas tree Tony had had put in for him. There was nothing on it yet, as Tony had thought Bucky might enjoy doing it himself, but it filled the room with the distinctive smell of pine, of Christmas. The under floor heating was on full blast and Steve had proven himself a true boy scout when he had started a fire in the old grate at one end. They were warm and cosy, the mulled wine was tasty, and Steve was sitting next to Tony on the small couch, only a few inches of room between them. No, it wasn't a bad situation to be in, all things considered; especially if it seemed like they'd be able to get away in the morning.
Humiliating as it was, Steve didn't dare protest and opened his mouth obediently as Tony fed him another spoon full of lukewarm soup.
Steve barely noticed when Thor clapped his shoulder and went off to find something to eat. He stood there, alone, wanting to look anywhere but at the dancers yet unable to look away.
Steve had never liked the idea of a soulmate. He hadn't liked the idea of fate or the universe or whoever forcing him to love someone. But it didn't feel like that any more. He could have fallen on his knees and thanked the powers that they had found each other. He could have run out into the night, asthma be dammed, joints be dammed, and straight back to Barnaby. He could have called him right there and then, despite the time, and told him everything.
'No, it's just...' Natasha said, giggling again as she thought of it. 'It feels like we're in the field. Hawkeye, get up top. Widow, see if you can find another way out. Iron Woman, stop crying...'
If Steve wanted him to. Maybe he didn't. Maybe that was why he was moving on. Why wasn't he
Tony had never heard Pepper speak with so much emphasis, but that wasn't the real reason he was looking at her in shock. He turned to look at Steve, who was slightly red in the face, but held his gaze.
Apparently she was also immune to cold. Steve was sitting directly below the air conditioning vent, which he was almost sure she had deliberately turned up higher than any sane person would reasonably inflict on another. It was also making the air very dry. He used his inhaler, noisily. She kept glaring at him, no longer even pretending to work. Steve met her gaze, and took another puff.
century but disused in his childhood and eventually demolished in the early 30s. It was also, unfortunately, full of lawyers. Between the contemporary New Yorkers fleeing and the confused time travellers panicking, the place was in so much chaos they had called in the other Avengers to help try and keep things under control whilst they tried to work out what was going on.
'I'm just really happy you're okay, Peter.'
The process of Charity Marriage is a formal one, following several set steps, and is almost always initiated by the parents.
about what the different flowers symbolise.’ The laughter would start up again, and Steve would hide his face, embarrassed, and Tony would be giggling and trying to pry his hands away just as Pepper would call out ‘To be fair, James, he did ask for flowers to symbolise
Venom swallowed the last of it's drink, and the big tongue rolled out again, slathering around to collect the drops off his jaw.
Except the empty cupboard wasn't actually empty. When he opened it, Tony spotted a small, scrunched up piece of what looked like fabric. Frowning, he set the vase down carefully and pulled the bundle out.
His colour was back now. More than back, Steve was flushing redder than the knickers. Tony started to think he was missing something. He held on. Steve pulled on the underwear, stretching them out between them, the delicate lace straining.
'Get up,' he said. 'Show me your powers. How did he get it to work on you? How? I've been trying for years and none of my subjects ever survived!'
Steve frowned. 'This can wait, Stark, you aren't well.'
He crawled easily down and got onto the road on the other side before setting off at a run towards where, in the distance, he could just see Mr Stark's tower dominating the skyline.
'Peggy called me,' Bucky explained. 'Said you were coming. Said you were upset. Who's Tony, Steve?'
He sat up so quickly he nearly knocked the water over, wondering how he had missed something so obvious. If he couldn't leave the bed, and there was nothing fun in the bed, he would just have to
They spent a happy morning playing together with the toys and then, when that got too much, curled up on the bed watching
'For digging?'
'Wouldn't the next biggest be Jupiter?'
'Then sure.'
Despite his best efforts, Steve ground to a halt, panting. He was fast, but this creature was faster, and he just couldn't keep up.
'Definitely not Bucky, who wouldn't let anyone sit in your seat at lunch,' Sam said, smiling. 'For real though, I'm glad to see you back. You doing okay?'
She jumped, suddenly throwing the cushion guiltily away from her, sitting up. The movement was a mistake. She needed to pee,
. Stark saw his face and laughed.
'So I gathered, given that he told me you tackled him and tied him to a chair!' She shook her head. 'I really thought you had more sense than this, Captain.'
With a little assistance from the driver, Steve pulled the carriage over and hopped down.
Steve couldn't meet his eyes. 'I know we said I shouldn't read the interviews-'
Steve groaned. He was already a year older than his peers, from way back in Elementary school where he'd missed most of second grade the first time round because of one illness after another. At least back then he'd had the silver lining that repeating the year put him in the same class as Bucky, already his best friend from playing together in the apartment building, but if it happened again it would put him behind them. Next year they would be seniors, they would graduate and go off to college without him while he was still stuck in high school with kids two years younger than him. It didn't bear thinking about.
and I passed. I'm not wasting that by quitting now. If Tony doesn't want me he can say so.'
There was a loud, sizeable crowd of very young, very drunk, very scantily clad beautiful women in the back corner of the room. It seemed like his tip off may actually pay off. Suddenly wondering what he was going to say, Steve worked his way over to them between the tightly-packed tables. His passage didn't escape their notice, as the women turned to look at him. He began to feel a bit self-concious.
Tony reached into his pocket. And then into his other pocket. And if his sweatpants had had back pockets, he would have reached into those too, but it would have just been for show. Tony Stark had not carried cash since 1992. But Tony Stark, apparently, also did not carry his bank card as a matter of habit. If it was work stuff, Pepper always sorted it out. He ordered 90% of his personal goods online, or Happy handled the actual paying part. At least, he assumed they did. Walking around as Tony Stark, or even as Iron Man, tended to bring a lot of free stuff his way. Cap called it 'paying with your face'. Cap rarely accepted freebies.
She wasn't the sort of person Tony had imagined to be a teacher. Until coming here he had been home schooled by a string of increasingly exasperated private tutors, so his only idea of teachers had been from TV. Even though Jarvis had tried to console him, tried to explain to him that teachers
Steve shrugged. 'You lied to me, too.'

it when people are dishonest, don’t you?’ He smirked. Steve looked more irritated than ever, but still didn’t say anything. ‘Come on, he ought to know.’
'-knew you would, well, I didn't know you were trying-' Peter was babbling, as Stark dropped him onto his feet, awkwardly patting his shoulder. 'But once Steve said
So no, there were certain people at school Steve would
'You are intruding in the vents,' was all Jarvis said, once more. Peter ducked in and started to scramble through. It was dark in there, but he could see a strange light ahead, gold and blue in turn. He went towards it.
A traditional charity marriage follows five set steps, sometimes called 'The Five Meetings'. Each stage must be passed to the mutual satisfaction of both parties before the marriage will take place. The steps are:
'It was a beautiful day in the garden. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, when suddenly...'
'You got your answer. Tell me what that thing is.'
. Planned in full – and in secret – by Steve. It was big and lavish and excessive and everything Tony loved in a party and Steve didn't, the absolute bastard.
He had resisted sleep as long as he could, lying there in his wife's arms, feeling her stroke his hair and hold him close, listening to her reminisce about their honeymoon, the happiest three weeks of his life; but as that Steve drifted off he was awakening to, as, in, another.
Tony had to admit he didn't really get it. They'd gone to an art show way back in February, to a tiny gallery in the middle of nowhere, because Steve had seen some artist on pinterest that was going to be displaying. Tony hadn't been in the best of moods as they'd fought their way through the snow and slush to get there, but all that had changed as soon as they'd gotten inside. Steve had looked around at the paintings and sculptures, his face lit up with delight and awe. The only other thing Tony had seen him pull that face for was, well, him. So he'd gone back later and spoken to artist, asked for a commission. For months they had been trading emails, sketches, designs, and now the finished product was in Tony's hands; a vase, but not the sort you'd actually put flowers in. It had a shape that looked like water flowing, caught in a moment between moments. The colour changed depending on what angle the light caught it at, but all of its shades were peaceful, like hope, like yearning. It was beautiful, and Steve would love it. It was also the perfect size to fit into the empty cupboard.
'Mr Rogers,' he said, evenly. 'You lied to me.'
It would have been a different story if he had been there alone, Tony knew. With Steve and Peter there, there was no chance to feel the solitude. It was almost like his fantasy, waking up with a family there every day, except that Steve was in the spare room, in a separate bed, and motivated by orders rather than any feelings.
'I think the better question is, am I
Peter pointed up at the sky. 'Look,' he said. Tony and Steve looked. He was pointing at a bird, flying across the street a little way up from them.
'Why is your neck so hot?' Tony asked, lifting his chin from where it had been resting on Steve's hair and moving his hand away. 'It's like it's – oh.
He reached the top level of windows, but he couldn't see Steve or Mr Stark, just the dark inside of a bedroom. Worried, he turned slowly and followed the wall sideways until he saw the monster standing in Mr Stark's living room, like he didn't have a care in the world. Peter hit the glass angrily, but even the sound of it was carried away by the wind.
He never thought, not for a second, that the baby would survive. It never even occurred to him that it would be possible this early on. In the car he had been hoping the hospital would somehow be able to stop it coming, but when he found out they couldn't he had thought he knew what came next. He had just been praying that Mary would survive, that she and Richard would, somehow, find some comfort in their grief. But, just over an hour later, Richard came to find him, collapsing into the chair next to Steve as if he had been gone for a life time.
'Clint, no, I can't-' Tony protested, weakly, but his arms seemed to open of their own accord as Clint plopped Peter into them.
Peter was definitely getting too big for the pushchair, but it was the only way Steve was going to be able to get him out. Stark had been right about one thing; they had been cooped up in the house too long, and two days after his visit, when Peter seemed to be having a good day, Steve decided they ought to get out for some air. He loaded the tank into the bottom just in case, strapped Peter in and noticed how his knees were practically under his chin. Peter couldn't walk more than a few hundred yards without getting breathless. Steve wasn't sure how they were going to manage when he couldn't fit in the buggy any more. The hospital were unlikely to provide a wheelchair. He would just have to think of something else-
The cashier laughed and reached to the pharmacy shelf behind her, adding some boxes of painkillers to his purchases. 'You got a hot water bottle at home, sweetheart?'
'Stark? Everything okay? We need to move on.'
'The whole building must have been rigged,' Natasha was saying, unaware of the grappling that was going on at their end. 'They blew the whole thing. Ten square miles of labs and tunnels under the desert and they just blew it up like it was nothing.'
‘Yeah. Maybe a little socially awkward.’
Steve had never been a good dancer, but just then he didn't care. He would have said yes if Barnaby had invited him to go out to the nearest dumpster and lie down in it. Something about this man just drew him in completely. He downed the rest of his beer, almost spilling some in his enthusiasm, and followed Barnaby out to the dance floor.
dollars. And he wants to meet me.'
The commotion had woken up Peter, who was looking around in confusion, straining to see over the shield even as Steve tried to keep him behind it. The agents opened fire on the creature again as Steve tried to be heard over the noise.
'This is the best garden I've ever seen. I could kiss them.'
The longest he had gone without sleep was nine days, the same week he had been on the mission that had left him without food. He'd been fed when he finally arrived back at base, but had been forced to go through several long debriefs after that, and then Dugan had been injured and he had sat up waiting for news. He'd slept for a full 24 hours afterwards, and had felt refreshed. In the back of his mind, he wondered whether lack of sleep would ever kill him, even if he tried to stay awake for the rest of his life.
When they broke apart, breathless, a long moment later, Tony's hand was on the back of Steve's neck; the warm blemish burning up again at his touch.
'Thanks, Meredith,' he said, and it came out quiet and shaky, as if his voice had gone somewhere far away behind the sudden lump in his throat. She cocked an eyebrow at him.
'I thought I told you to study, Harry!'
he told himself, and he pushed through inside.
'Thanks,' Steve said, in his ordinary voice, and moved away to the fridge to finish getting the juice like nothing had happened.
'So we put the profile up,' Bucky said. 'And your mom's already had someone interested.'
Steve shrugged. That wasn't exactly news. Still, though, he didn't think it was
'Breathe, madam,' Jarvis interrupted his count. 'Your heart rate is accelerating.'
‘I bet he is,’ Steve said, sinking into a chair. He suddenly felt exhausted. ‘Look, it was nothing. Peter… Peter wanted to meet Iron Man. Stark agreed to come on the condition I had dinner with him. That was all there was to it. We haven’t had any contact with him since.’
Conversation had come easily after that. They talked and joked, and ate waffles with cream (Steve's stomach and his sugar levels did
'What, 'beautiful'? Because honestly, look at you. I don't know how I can call you anything else. Or did you mean 'sweetheart'? Or 'blue-eyes'? Because, again-'
? Can they manage that?’
'I don't know what I was thinking,' Steve said. 'It was a stupid idea.'
'I ate better hiding in a cave from the gestapo.'
That was the final straw. He didn't want to see that face. Tony wasn't going to let this happen. He got to his feet.
Tony sighed. He'd already had to have one conversation with the man at the start of December when the Steve had said that he was going to start saving his newspapers to make paper chains. Paper chains. Made out of newspaper. Like some sort of depression-era Womble. 'Where is he?' Tony asked.
to some researcher or lawyer or administrator Tony was unlikely to ever talk to. This man worked in his house, it was personal, intimate – he saw his trash, for goodness' sake, and after a similar stint in the lab Tony had once eaten 12 Krispy Kremes in a single afternoon. Tony ought to have at least known he existed.
And Steve did. Slowly, his grip loosened, and Tony slid to the floor. His gasps of air, however, were lost. Peter was crying, and the sound was loud enough to fill the room, drowning out all other noise in the wail that could only come from some very full, very healthy lungs.
Century invented it just because it named it?'
Tony’s small smile against his skin, could almost feel his breath on his cheek. Which was more than could be said for Steve’s own breath, which seemed to have stopped completely. Judging by the burning in his cheeks, nowhere else was getting a blood supply. He might suffocate because of that smile. He might faint. And if what Steve thought
'Probably joined you under the table,' he admitted.
'Is Widow here?' she asked, hopefully.
'Captain Rogers, you are incorrigible.'
'Nothing. Just finished in the lab.'
'You are so like your father,' Steve remarked, which killed Tony's libido in a single stroke. Even his flight suit seemed to tense in disgust.
Yinsen died in the doorway to their cell, buying him a few extra seconds to get the suit online and operational. Tony got all the way out into that scorching desert sun, and he flew up and away and the hell out of there.
He had been planning to save that little reveal for later, but it was worth it just to see how quickly Steve turned to face him, looking shocked. Tony waited for him to open his mouth to speak, then jumped in first.
. Her breath caught, she exhaled too loudly.
There was no reply for a minute, and then, 'I don't want to answer that question, Cap.'
future! He is dying! Haven't you caused enough suffering in your miserable little life?! When was the last time anyone else genuinely wanted to spend time with you?! Would one good deed, making one dying little boy happy for ten minutes, cost you so much?! What the hell is wrong with you?!'
. He could have ignored it, carried on waiting for Stark to show, rejected the deal, gone through with the marriage and helped a lot of people, but he didn't. He answered the phone. How could he not answer? Apparently even monsters were capable of love at first sight.
'Um, yeah, but...' Tony pointed awkwardly at the roses on the counter. ‘Those are white.’
He couldn't help wondering, in the back of his mind, exactly what the recording contained. He knew about Steve and Peggy, of course. The one kiss. The date that never was. Back when he had first met Steve, Steve had still been getting over it; the relationship that had never had the chance to get started. Peggy was Steve's road not taken, and Tony had learnt to be okay with that, but still. Still. It was horrible of him, but he desperately wanted to know what the recording contained, what Steve had said. Had he told Peggy he loved her? At the same time, no, he definitely didn't want to hear it. He wavered in indecision.
'You'll like it here, trust me, it's great, bubble tea is great, know what I recommend? Strawberry and peach, Steve!' It was getting hard to breathe again. He needed to trick Steve into taking him home. But bubble tea first.
He'd told them no music. No music, and no photographs. He'd been very clear.
Agent Meason nodded slowly. 'Okay. Peter, everyone else has gone to help your dad so I'm going to need to go check on that. I'm going to ask you to hide, okay? Just for a little bit while we make sure the house is safe, and then you can come out.' He cast around them, looking for somewhere for Peter to hide, and then gently nudged him into what Steve would call a broom cupboard but everyone else would probably just call a closet. 'I'll be right back,' he promised, and shut the door.
'Sit down,' he said.
'No!' Tony whipped his head round to glare at him, was on his feet before he knew it. 'No way are they taking him back! No way in
once the holidays were over. Tony's ribbon now secured, Steve stood up, looking levelly at Clint.
'That's not what I meant!' Steve huffed in frustration. 'Why do you always do this? You have to twist everything and make it all about you - '
, it should have been me when we were at school, it should have been
Tony stared and stared. He was trying to convince himself that it must just be a relic of the olden days, but he knew it wasn't true. He'd only acquired the empty cupboard a year or so before meeting Steve, when he'd already calmed down on the playboy thing. And anyway, this was the spare room. They barely came in here. They certainly never used the bed.
'Maybe.' Stark shrugged. 'Know who isn't, any more? Peter.'
. He was home. He was back. And he felt like crap.
'I know, I shouldn't, I wish I hadn't, but it was just this one girl... she was on the cover of the magazine. She was really pretty.'
'Weird, but flattering,' Tony agreed, flipping through the ledger to look at the other weddings. 'And when he's put this much work in, it would be rude not to.'
'Do we have an issue here?' Steve asked, pulling himself up to his full height. He had no patience for people who were pointlessly antagonistic.
'I thought you did.'
It occurred to him that he ought to get Thor to come with him, but when he turned to look Thor had swept his sister back onto the dance floor and she was bearing with it and smiling in such a self-satisfied way that Steve turned away, feeling sick. He'd handle this himself. It seemed like his retirement plan had just fallen through anyway.
Next to Peter's elbow, a section of the glass suddenly popped open, revealing an air duct. Cautiously, Peter put his head in and looked inside.
But that was before Afghanistan. Before she was kidnapped and held hostage. And here's the thing about kidnappers - they aren't particularly concerned with their hostage's sanitary hygiene or providing her with tampons, towels, or access to contraception. Really, Natasha supposed she ought to just be grateful that she hadn't been raped; but frankly she wasn't surprised they weren't tempted.
Bucky snorted. 'You think?'
Tony was kneeling in front of him, tying first one shoe and then the other. His hair curled slightly at the ends. Not many people noticed that, but Steve did. He always did. And, just then, it would have been the most natural thing in the world to just lean down and plant a kiss into that hair. A small intimacy, a little touch, a reminder that he was here, that when Tony was in front of him he would always have his full attention.
traumatised him.)
he thought.
'A Christingle.'
'Howard Stark's rays, I know. I... I might be able to get those. I mean, Stark might know. We could ask him. And the serum, what if I could get you...' he hesitated, just for a second. He had never revealed his true past to anyone except Richard and Mary. It just seemed simpler that way. The hesitation was the only sign Dr Moore needed to continue.
'It's no trouble. I'll call in tomorrow, see if he's ready to get his lazy butt back to work.'
'So?'
'Not on any cards. Look, Stark, thank you for everything you've done. Really,
Steve went into Peter’s room, shutting the door firmly behind him. Peter was half-collapsed on the bed, wearing only a t-shirt, panting with effort. Steve hurried over, getting him sitting upright again, reaching for the mask attached to the tank. They were using it more and more often lately, and Peter didn’t even protest any more.
Realising his mistake in an instant, Tony moved to snatch up his notes but it was too late. Osborn had already picked them up and begun to rifle through them. His eyes narrowed even more than Tony's had.
'8... 7...'
'Of what?' Tony asked. 'You know I hate metaphors.'
'Woah,' Clint said, walking into the kitchen. 'Hey there, Patrick Swayze.'
The rest of his body was freezing, but Steve's throat and his chest were burning, as if all the heat from his body had been sucked to just those two places. It made it painful to breathe. The air felt like lead weight in his lungs.
Only just managing to swallow the scream that he did not want the men outside to hear, Tony pressed his lips tightly together and cautiously turned to face the left hand wall. He shuffled forwards, trying to focus the weak light of the arc reactor enough to know what he was dealing with.
'I'm fine,' he said, sighing, and obviously seeing that wasn't going to fly added, 'Just... reassessing my life choices.'
Steve raised his eyebrows. 'Well someone isn't getting their badge,' he said. 'Look, come here.'
'I'm going to get a drink,' he said, heading into the kitchen. He was angry, and he didn't want it to explode out at them. None of it was their fault. Apart from the
'Captain, if you're about to give me some
‘Peter told me.’
‘Um…’ Peter said, his mouth still full, shuffling guiltily.
etcetera etcetera?’
he asked, 'Hey, Steve, could you give me a minute?'
'Only if you became a millionaire in the last two months,' Steve sighed.
'Flying cars.' Steve agreed, 'And settlements on the moon. And everything was going to be made of chrome and steel.' He was still rubbing Tony's back, but quicker now, with open handed strokes. Tony's jacket was never going to be the same, but he didn't care. He squirmed happily, moving to try and encourage Steve to circle wider, but it didn't seem like Steve was even paying attention to what he was doing. 'But, you know, we never thought about society changing. I mean, we all thought there would be world peace. You had to believe it to keep going, to keep fighting. But you never really saw anything about how America would change. I guess most people thought we had it all perfected.'
'Nope, nothing to fix. Just, just give them back,' Steve said, trying to snatch the knickers out of Tony's hand. 'Just forget about it, okay?'
Steve looked at him, his frown deepening. 'What?'
'It's a Christingle,' Steve repeated, putting the board into the drainer before emptying the sink and turning to dry his hands. 'A Christingle, for Christmas.'
would have been too intimidating, and too tragic, not when all that potential would never be realised.
from next door. Tony leapt away from him with a grimace.
'No you didn't!' Peter protested. 'You brought that big bag!'
Peter whined, still giggling. Steve broke and laughed too.
, before the serum, when every winter the cold would wreak havoc with his asthma, and some breaths were like swallowing knives. Was that what Peter felt like all the time? Damn.
'Hi,' Tony croaked, and, slowly sat up. The movement made his head spin.
As you might have guessed from the number of updates, I am still suffering writer's block with my original work. Anyone have any tips?! Anyway, thank you again to everyone who read, left kudos or commented- it means the world and you keep me coming back to this :) enjoy!
'That'll be $4.50, please.'
Peter was still watching the film. Steve knew his response to this was important, that what he said here really mattered, but he couldn't put himself together enough to form a proper sentence.
'Stark?'
Steve wondered, faintly.
Unfortunately, his face was not currently recognisable, and his bank card was presumably somewhere in Stark Tower.
'How long?'
It slipped out without his meaning it to. He didn't even need to hear Steve's response to know, at least roughly, what it was going to be.
going to sleep with you. That was, and is, just never going to happen. It's never been on the cards.'
Surprising absolutely nobody, money really had made a difference to Steve's life. Getting him healthy enough physically and financially to go back to school and finish his bachelor's, for one thing. Getting his mother somewhere decent to live, for another. Plus the Maria Stark foundation was starting to make a difference in lives across the world, in all sort of ways. None of that, though, had made as much of an impact as Tony himself. Simply the act of loving, and being loved in return, made Steve feel alive in whole new ways. They'd done the whole thing backwards, getting married first and then getting to know each other after, but there wasn't a day in his life that Steve didn't wake up thinking how lucky he was. So he smiled back at Tony, taking off his graduation cap and plopping it onto Tony's head, before pulling him in for a kiss again. In the back of his mind, he was making all sorts of plans about what he was going to do just as soon as he could get Tony into the school and the back of a deserted supply closet. Preferably one where they kept paint.
. It was a way of forcing Loki to attend these family gatherings as he had loathed most of the people in the room but if they were celebrating him, he’d let his hatred temporarily subside. Loki wasn’t stupid though, he figured out that the party wasn’t for him after the first one he attended but Thor didn’t know he knew so he kept up the rouse. Even thinking he had caught on to the Earth holiday and started bringing gifts for everyone.
“Mom. I’m dangerous.”
Tony paused his typing, looked up from the screen and stared at Stephen, who’s back was now facing him. “What do you mean?” Was he really getting angry about him texting Steve when they’d just made love?
“Good except that Nathan avoided me for most of the trip.” Nat provided, staring off at Nathan.
Sharon was only a second away from tears that spurted from anger. A baby wouldn’t keep Steve Rogers in her life, wouldn’t keep him with her romantically, so what would?
“If anyone should be a key suspect.” Anna spoke, letting Tony go and turning to face the rest of her family. “It should be Natasha Romanov.” Anna explained. “Her gun was the murder weapon and she doesn’t have a legit alibi.” Harley wondered how she knew that as well. That wasn’t public information.
Tony raised his brows. "Oh?"
"Baby, I'm sorry."
The interns stood idle in the patient room before following Dr. Danvers and Wilson into the hallway. Natasha tentatively raised her hand.
"Keep an eye on the white cell count," Wilson replied with a huff, "page me immediately if anything changes with your patients. Please try not to kill my post-ops, I'd greatly appreciate it."
"I left the station before I could embarrass myself anymore," Steve explained, "But then she had a meeting to go to."
James sighs. "Tones...what are you doing here?"
A cartload of pet items and two cheeseburgers later, the pair were finally back at the apartment. Cheeseburger eagerly made his way to the kitchen onto the stool, waiting for his dinner. Tony unloaded all the bags from the pet store and sighed.
The intern nearly ran out the door before Tony's voice stopped him again. Steve wanted to shout at his subconscious at this point.
The blond had barely dozed off before his cell phone started ringing. He groaned when he saw that it was an unknown number. He had given his numbers to his friends and some of the other new interns, but he was exhausted and couldn't think of who could be calling. So, Steve let the phone ring as he closed his eyes for the first time since last night.
Suddenly, the last ten years of his life seemed to flash by. The day he met Pepper—bright eyed and beautiful, walking into the hospital and introducing herself as one of the new OB-GYN- residents. The day he finally asked her to dinner, during one of the hospital galas that his father had forced him to go to; for once, he was actually grateful about his mandatory attendance. At least in that moment, he got to see Pepper in that gorgeous blue dress of hers. Tony wasn’t just infatuated—he was falling, and falling fast. The memory of the gala alone was enough to make his heart pound.
“Valkyrie.” Sif addressed her guard. “Take a moment. I am more than capable of caring for myself. I hope you haven’t forgotten that I am a skilled warrior.”
Anna stilled and allowed him to caress her cheek. Tony could feel little thumbtacks of pain piercing his fingertips, but it wasn’t excruciating, thankfully. He could bare it for a few seconds. Anna had closed her eyes and relished in her mother’s touch. When Tony stepped away, Anna could see the pain in his eyes.
“I mean. Like, out-out. With a guy. Like a date?”
“Steve, I have to ask.” Vision stated. “We heard about your past…with Natasha.” Steve nodded as Vision spoke. “Why her? Did you not have feelings for Tony anymore?” Steve stayed quiet. Vision spoke up again. “I hope I haven’t overstepped.”
, he thought.
“How did you hear about that?” Remy figured he’d start asking this question now and stop assuming because if she knew, who many other people did?
Not long after, Steve approached them. The four men then engaged in conversation. Tony’s name was brought up a few times, whether it be just Sam teasing Steve or otherwise. At the mention of his name, Steve spotted Tony by the elevator hugging a man that had to be the infamous Stephen Strange. Tony lead him around the party; a present in his hand. A pang of jealously hit Steve.
Tony walked Stephen out of the room. He tried to apologize for his part in the ruin of the dinner, but Tony didn’t want to hear it. It was just another messy family dinner for the books. Stephen placed a kiss on his cheek, but Tony’s mood didn’t falter as he watched the elevator doors close between them. He was left with Steve.
“It’s business.” He reverberated his answer from before. It was vague but it was the truth. What he and Natasha was doing was almost transactional. She did something for him and he wouldn’t share her secret. He placed a hand on Anna’s inner thigh and shivers ran through her. His other hand found her face, pressing a kiss against her lips and he welcomed the pain that came with having skin-to-skin contact with her.
“You’re not going to forget about me?” It’s barely a whisper, and hearing this is like a knife in Tony’s chest.
"No, no!" Natasha grabbed his arm. "I'm sorry. You just totally did not seem like the type to have drunk one-night stands. You look like the guy who opens car doors, gets flowers, pulls up in shining armor on a white horse. I'm sorry."
"Surely, you miss me," Pepper said softly. "At least a little."
Despite slightly blurred vision, Steve noticed a dark-haired man sitting right in his line of sight. Slightly curled strands of salt and peppered hair and ridiculously gorgeous eyes. He almost looked too pretty to be sitting at the bar alone, so the intern motioned over to Joe.
After a couple hours, Sharon and Dr. Potts-Stark emerged from the OR and informed them of the good news. Alex burst into tears again, this time throwing her arms around Pepper and Sharon and thanking them profusely.
"I was."
The intern smirked as he eased back into the bed. "Oh, absolutely."
The room somehow grew quiet enough to hear a pin drop. Even the music stopped. Blood rushed in Steve's ears. Somewhere behind him, probably Sharon's voice, calling out to him. Saying something how Jake wasn't worth the trouble. At least Steve learned his name now. Still, the anger that was surging through Steve's body took him over, and before he could stop himself, he threw his fist against the intern's jaw. There was a sickening crush of bone meeting bone. The beer bottle shattered on the floor, snapping Steve out of his trance.
"I'm just telling the truth," Steve replied, "even my mom was all heart eyes this morning at the hospital. Everyone over there is falling at your feet, you know that right?"
Steve’s worried too.
He was trying to sleep, but his phone kept ringing. He held the phone to his ear and huffed.
Natasha folded her arms. "No one in the entire world is as perky as you are at six in the morning. We know it's not the coffee, Rogers. It's the sex."
"We have another appointment next week," Pepper said calmly, "I hope I see you there."
The blond leaned down and pressed his lips to Tony's forehead. "I'm sorry, I take it back. I don't need anyone or anything but you. Better?"
"She'll be fine," Nat replied, "Are you okay?"
Nothing.
"I can take care of him," Steve said. He extended the back of his hand to the kitten, who whimpered quietly before offering a introductory lick. "See? He likes me already. I can keep him, Pete."
She was getting a bit nervous now, since Steve noticed Jake and other interns and nurses gathered around him. It was hard to hear, but they knew exactly what he was talking about. Jake made no effort to hide the cut on his face; it was barely stitched up, as if he was begging for some scar to appear later.
He wanted to tell his best friend about Steve, he really did. He missed the thrill of telling his friend about someone new, someone exciting. But he knew Rhodey wouldn't approve just yet, not with everything that was going on in New York. Tony just desperately wanted to forget about it. New York, his life before—he needed a fresh start. And Steve, well...that was just an added perk to his new life here in Chicago.
"Clock's ticking, Rogers. The minute they get this elevator running, that's it. I'll stay a mystery."
Steve placed the paddles on her chest, adjusting as Wilson coached him. He heard his own voice his time, telling the nurse to charge, charge again, charge three times. He felt sicker as the girl's pulse was still nowhere to be found.
Sharon smirked. "You being pathetic is helping, actually."
"I'm going to be fine," Steve insisted. "Alex must be worried sick I'll go update her. Page me when the surgery is over."
"Fuck," Steve muttered. "It's Wilson."
Sharon joined the redhead, looping her arm with Steve's. "Just about every intern in our class is here...and Bucky invited some of the OR nurses, too!"
In a way, it was their first date. First time in months or years that they didn't feel miles apart from each other. First time that Tony kissed Pepper on the cheek, first time that he kissed her on the mouth. He wanted it to feel the same, he wanted to feel the same fire that Pepper gave him the first night he saw her one of the charity dinners at his father's hospital.
“Thanks, Tony. Really."
Steve shrugs. “You can say that. I was just in this building looking for a little inspiration.”
Whatever. He was a neurosurgeon. Steve couldn't be angry about a page that took a few minutes longer than expected. Tony—Dr. Stark— was probably coming out of a surgery or doing another consult. Whatever. Steve did what he was supposed to do. He was trained to save Katie's life, and he did it. Still, the nurses should be thanking
The bartender turned around and snickered. "Quit shouting, bud. Did you finish the water?"
Tony still loved him.
Once they returned to the apartment and put the groceries away, Tony clapped his hands together. "Now it looks like someone actually lives and eats here."
Another plus to the Just Friends act was that Pepper seemed to be giving him a break. Steve still wasn't on Alex and Andy's case, but Pepper allowed the intern to visit the family whenever he liked.
"You've been staring at that chart for ten minutes now."
He wasn't sure if he was ready for a date with his wife after all these months. In fact, he couldn't even remember the last time they were on a date in New York. Sure, there were galas and functions that they needed to attend as a couple for the hospital, but never real dates.
Sharon and Natasha were splayed out on the couch, with the redhead in Sharon's lap. They looked so comfortable, but Steve had to wake them. He ushered them into his room. They immediately started kicking off their shoes and got under the covers. He set down bottles of water for them and their hangovers in the morning.
Silence flooded the elevator once more. Steve fidgeted around slightly, not quite sure how to respond. There was a twinge of bitterness, and his annoyance got the best of him as the words flew out of his mouth.
"Okay, okay, okay." The neurosurgeon took a breath. "I'm kind of seeing someone. Dating someone."
"It's not stupid," she reassured him. "You seemed really happy with him."
Natasha's brow furrowed. "But if he's stable and we're just waiting, are we just—"
"Your son diagnosed my first patient here, actually," Tony said confidently, "he was the first intern to help me on a case."
“I wish you were here.”
“Steve?”
What was it about a mother's voice that could bring someone to tears after having a bad day? Steve hadn't even turned around yet, but he was ready to collapse into his mother's arms and burst into tears.
Steve shook his head vigorously. "No, I didn't."
The next day at the hospital, Steve could not focus on anything other than the note from Eva. The small piece of paper was practically burning a hole in his pocket. He meant to call right after the grocery run, but his anxiety had gotten the best of them. By the time he had worked up the nerve to finally call Eva, it was far too late. He didn't want any insinuation of a booty call—he did not need
"Oh, thank God you remembered me, Rhodey," Tony sighed with relief, "you had such a grown up face on in the conference room, I was beginning to think you really forgot about me."
The fleeting dejected expression was quickly masked by another charming smile. "I totally understand. Don't want to make a bad impression."
The young mother calmed a little bit, taking a seat and catching her breath. The intern didn't leave her side as the surgery continued. Soon, they were a couple of the few people in the lobby; Alex was sound asleep against Steve, who had a secure arm around her.
Usually, the ER was something to look forward to. Some of the best cases came in through the doors, and the interns were finally getting the hang of running a trauma together. While it had only been a couple months at the hospital, the interns were beginning to feel like real doctors. They were a team.
Sharon shook her head and laughed. "Alright, we'll be at your little party. After everyone's shifts, I'm assuming?"
Tony finally turns around, leaning against the lab table and sighing as Steve continues kissing his neck. His hands are in Steve’s hair now, softly running through the golden strands that he adores so much.
Steve never ran so quickly in his life.
Tony was his...acquaintance. No harm in being acquaintances with your ex, right?
She nodded. "It's just a cute nick name. A cute name for a cute guy like you."
"Yes." Tony was sweating now, suddenly wishing that he wasn't doing this in the fucking first place. "It's Christmas, so."
, but Tony didn’t care. It was a
Snow fell gently outside, looking beautiful like something out of a movie. Steve was looking something beautiful too, cheeks red out of frustration and snowflakes dusting his eyelashes. Something in the back of his mind, either Rhodey’s warning or his own conscious, told him to leave the poor man alone. The alcohol in his blood was telling a different story.
because this pretty boy comes out of literally nowhere, actually complimenting him rather than teasing him about his talent.
Pepper was shy, somehow. Barely eating, taking tiny sips of her wine and timidly speaking as the night carried on. Like she was walking on glass, and she didn't want to risk breaking anything by getting ahead of herself. She wasn't usually so shy; the sight reminded Tony of their first date.
Natasha paused. "The bleeding and swelling would be why she's seizing."
"There are no set rules in this hospital against dating your boss. It's frowned upon, but not illegal," Tony reassured him. "It would be different if you were just using me to get in on surgeries and sleep your way to the top. Are you sleeping your way to the top, Rogers? Were all these weeks and months just a ploy to get good surgeries?"
He was drowning, sinking, and there was only one person who could help him out of this.
It was a quiet evening in the NICU nursery; there weren't many babies for Steve to round on. All the vitals seemed to be holding steady and he was thankful for that. He didn't mean to get so attached to the baby and her mother, but his heart nearly stopped any time he thought he saw the vitals changing. Steve cared about all his patients, but when it came to the children and the babies, he felt just a little bit closer to them. There was greater obligation to save them, especially since they were so little.
“One chance?!” Steve echoed. “
"Easy there, tiger."
The young woman turned to him and grinned. "There you are! You are hard to get a hold of, let me tell you."
Tony's heart cracked in half.
Steve returned to Tony and held up the grocery bags. "If you like Filipino food, I have enough to feed an army."
"Y-yeah. Of course." He took the paper and smiled. "Thanks, Eva."
Steve grimaced. "I'm assuming you're talking to me."
By the time Steve returned, the combination of warmth from the fire and warmth from the soup made Tony drowsy. The sleepy grin on his husband's face made Steve's heart swell. He placed the blanket over the both of them and wrapped his arm around Tony. He squeezed just a little, chuckling when Tony smiled again in response. Tony draped his arm over Steve's chest and sighed.
As if on cue, Dr. Wilson entered the gallery, holding stacks of charts and a stern look on his face. Steve immediately stood up and greeted his boss, taking the charts eagerly. Dr. Wilson stared at the intern curiously; the poor intern looked about as red as a tomato.
Tony tried not to let his emotions get the best of him, but he already felt the fire burning in his chest. He barely looked up from his chart. “Seems like it.”
Rhodey scoffed. “I don’t think you’ve ever called me by my actual name since I’ve known you. Not once.”
They walked off arm in arm while Sharon and Steve were at the station, watching Tommy and his mother in their room. The mother was sound asleep next to the little boy.
Tony immediately turned to Steve, who had a shit-eating grin on his face. The blond held the kitten up, making a kissy face to the kitten and cradling him like an infant.
Steve laughed and shook his head. "It was nice to meet you, kid. Get some rest and make sure your teammates catch you so I don't see you in this hospital anymore."
As Steve returned to the apartment, he was surprised to hear muffled music echoing from his place. There were definitely too many people in that apartment. When he entered, the whole room cheered upon his arrival. Everyone definitely had the chance to get the alcohol into their system; people who never would have interacted with each other were laughing and dancing. It was so odd to see so many people in his apartment, especially coworkers he barely knew.
The mother nodded and sat with her daughter, hand laying in the incubator. Pepper led Steve out of the NICU and handed him the charts and information for Alex and her baby.
They’re standing together at the airport the next morning. It’s so goddamn cheesy, Steve makes another joke about how they could star in the next romantic comedy. Their laughter is brief before the reality of it all strikes Tony in the chest.
Tony chuckles. “I’m still not staying in bed.”
"This feels familiar."
"Oh, we need more blankets. Give me one minute."
Steve exhaled, suddenly realizing how lightheaded he had become. He faced Wilson and forced a sheepish smile.
"Aren't you going to talk to him?" Nat asked. "You guys practically live together at your place, maybe he was going to leave her. Maybe he didn't know how to tell you."
"I'm just surprised that you're still so warm," Steve replied, "time for some medicine."
," Tony snarled. "My divorce papers came in the mail today, and the life I had for ten years is going to be torn apart in the worst way fucking possible. And the best part—the absolute best part—is that I'm alone. But yeah, I'm
It’s usually right when Steve ends his shift at the local diner back home; his hair is always a little disheveled, it makes Tony’s heart ache. There were so many things to love about Steve, but the one thing he missed most was running his fingers through his hair. Tony really was a sucker for blonds.
"I should actually go now."
"I'm sorry."
—but he stayed quiet.
Steve frowned. "I'm going to grab a thermometer. If you have a fever, I'm having FRIDAY lock down the tower just so you can finally get some rest."
Tony’s blushing now, and it’s
During surgery, the interns were allowed to scrub in. Nat stood next to Bucky, who only wished to observe. Sharon and Steve were able to get up close, holding suction and retractors for Dr. Danvers.
He faced her, surprised to see her eyes watering. "We talked a lot. After what happened. We didn't really get anywhere. Remember?"
He couldn't help but think about Pepper. How pretty she was. No, she wasn't pretty; she was beautiful. Surreal, in a way. Even when she was soaked in blood after getting cuts from a car accident, she was still beautiful. She looked like a movie star right at eight in the morning, as if she didn't need much sleep to look as flawless as she did. Her eyes were blue like his, but hers were different. They were brighter, like clear water at the beach. She wasn't pretty, she was breathtaking.
Steve smiles. “You’re doing great.”
"I'll make this brief, since I know the interns are nuts." Murmurs of amusement echoed the room. "Dr. Anthony Stark will be our new head of neurosurgery. Dr. Bruce Banner is our general surgeon, Dr. Carol Danvers is our cardio-thoracic surgeon, Dr. James Rhodes our trauma surgeon and Dr. Wilson is our very own chief resident."
"I could never."
The neurosurgeon left the papers on the counter and ran out the door before he could spend anymore time dwelling on the life he walked away from.
Tony shakes his head. “I’m a genius, remember? Geniuses can cram for their physics exams right before class starts. I’ll be fine.”
"Didn't I tell you I was going to take care of you?" Steve winked. "This is Dr. Wilson, he's the best resident there is. And then the rest of us interns, Bucky, Sharon, and Natasha."
And yet, seeing the two of them kissing made his blood boil all over again.
"You thought that too!" Steve laughed. He nudged her back. "Why are you thinkin' of soldier boy?"
"No, no, no, Steve, please listen," Tony urged. "I'm in this too! I promise."
Steve never sat up so quickly in his life. "T-Tony! Er, Dr. Stark. I—"
"...you kissed him."
"Who the hell was that?!"
Tony chuckles softly. “No?”
She may have been a bratty teenager at first, but Steve could tell her words were genuine. He squeezed gently in return and smiled.
The surgery was finally beginning. Bucky held his hand out and took a deep breath.
"Show me what you got, Rogers."
this is stupid and complicated. I know it’s wrong, especially with Eva. That’s why I don’t want to talk about it right now. Okay?”
"I don't want anyone new." Steve felt all his friends' eyes on him. "I mean—not for a while."
Steve laughed as he prepared some vegetables for that night's dinner. "Play nice, sweetheart."
Tony downed the contents of his cup and let the alcohol do the talking.
Steve grins. “I'd like that.”
Despite everything, his newfound friendship—almost friendship—with Steve was the only thing that made him feel better. News of the divorce was the talk the town; he knew that the moment the OR boards were updated the other day. Steve’s kindness despite everything they had gone through together just made everything a little bit easier. It was somehow easier to breathe knowing that he was not completely alone. Tony knew he had Rhodey, he would always have him. Still, Rhodey had created his own life here in Chicago, and Tony was still feeling helplessly alone. Steve had mended that feeling, helped that gnawing feeling become a little more bearable.
"Can we go see her?" Alex asked. She turned to Steve. "I mean, if you can."
The intern sat on the floor and sighed. Tony sat beside him, fidgeting with his stethoscope. Steve wanted to lean on him so badly, but he knew he didn't deserve that anymore. Especially not after he yelled at Tony like a fucking psychopath.
In the waiting room, Steve found the anxious mother holding a cup of tea and pacing. Once she saw the intern, her eyes watered with tears. She set the cup down and immediately threw her arms around the intern, trying to catch her breath as she cried.
Sharon raised her brows. “Memorizing his schedule now, are we?”
run out of coffee.”
Steve couldn't stop the blushing now. Tony pretty much did everything a boyfriend would do and more. If their schedules lined up for free time, he was at the apartment making a meal for the two of them. Tony's apartment was a bit of a walk from the hospital and since Steve's was much closer, he'd spend the night if they were off. It wasn't every night, but once or twice a week, Steve found himself breathing in the smell of Tony's hair.
Those three words made Steve completely forget the entire English language. The intern stuttered for a moment, scrambling to find an answer that wouldn't be completely embarrassing.
Tony looked a little more hopeful. "If we love each other, then we can work it out! Steve, please—"
Bucky blanched as Nick Fury turned to face him. "Congrats, Barnes. Be ready to scrub in later this evening."
Sharon shrugged and walked back to the ICU without waiting up for him. Natasha threw her pen at Steve.
"This is amazing," Steve said quietly, "Now I feel especially bad that I didn't get you a gift."
Dr. Rhodes rolled his eyes before throwing his arms around Tony. The two best friends gripped each other tightly. Best friends during their undergraduate and medical school careers, the two were separated on opposite ends of the country during their fellowships.
"You always make me feel better," Tony said softly, "the soup was just a perk."
"What's happening?" Pepper immediately placed her stethoscope to the baby's chest.
Steve ducks away from Tony’s gaze, but he knows the inevitable blush will dust his cheeks and ears. He knows that Tony loves him, but hearing him say that,
"It's not falling apart. It's already broken, Pep."
"I just didn't want you to worry," Tony sighed, "I know how panicky you get."
"I-I should go. Rhodes might need me back in the pit."
She moved toward him, bringing him into the break room and shutting the door. Her hands were just as delicate and tiny as he remembered; she still wore the ring he gave her years ago. The sight made him nauseous and sad and angry all at once. But she was sad, and even after everything that happened in New York, he didn't have the heart to pull his hands away from hers.
"And again, I'm sorry," Steve groaned, "Please don't make me grovel. I'm bad at it, and it's very, very pathetic."
The soldier wasn't impressed. He pressed a hand to Tony's forehead. "You're burning up."
"I want to know."
Steve never ran so fast in his life. He could barely feel his legs after taking the stairs and continuing his sprint to the pediatric ICU. That girl was not going to die on him today. He was just so goddamn slow, why didn't he take track and field during college?
"Pep doesn't drink much coffee," Tony lied, stepping a bit closer. "Heard you're off saving babies for this rotation."
Tony paled. "I know. I wanted to tell you. I did. There were so many times, it's just...complicated."
After rounding on his patients, updating the families, and updating patient charts, Tony made his way to the cafeteria. One of the downfalls to the night shift was the lack of warm meals; the kitchen staff could only work so late. The cafeteria offered junk food in the vending machines and some subpar coffee—Tony would have to settle for chips and coffee as dinner.
"There you are," Steve said happily, "chicken and rice soup. Best thing on cold day or when you're sick."
"Why are you leaving?" Steve stretched his arms out. "Come back."
But it was more than just cat safety gear that Tony ended up buying. The kitten seemed to meow at everything that looked like a treat or a toy, and soon, Tony had racked up a full cart of cat items they definitely did not need. The teenager at the register couldn't believe that Tony Stark was in the building with a cat in his arms.
"Today we declared a little girl brain dead." Bucky sounded far away, distant. "She was nine."
He also hated the cloudiness in his mind, his inability to answer. He wanted desperately to just be friends, but his heart was doing some weird tossing and turning, he was beginning to think someone in cardio should take a look. There was no reason for him to be feeling this way, but seeing Tony in earnest like this was making his heart contract way more than it should—
“You guys need to try harder.” Harley insisted. “You know that guy’s going to be sleeping with your precious baby boy tonight, if he hasn’t already.” He needed to remind them what was at stake here.
“No. I’m serious Jacob. I am in love with Nertha. I gotta go.” Harley finished, then he was out the door. Jacob stood there in awe and confusion.
They shared another hug and parted ways. Amelia returned to her conversations with her friends and he made himself scarce, aiming for the exit.
“Everyone,” he commanded when all eyes were on him. “Your guest of honor has arrived.” Thor had asked of Tony, years ago to let Loki think this party was for him as his birthday was December 24
“He’s coming down with Harley for my mom’s Christmas party though, right?” Morgan questioned.
“She’s distant. There’s something dark about her.” She stated. “And I was so surprised when I found out she and Jacob broke up.” Amelia had left Jacob devasted when she broke things off with him after being together for almost two and a half years. It was sudden and completely out of nowhere according to Jacob. He could have sworn she was happy with him because he was with her. They were planning a future together and she just showed up one day, claiming they weren’t right for each other and that she never loved him.
Steve looked a little grossed out. “Oh okay. Are you up for breakfast then?”
“Amelia’s acting so odd, lately.” Pepper supplied. They were seated on the rug-covered floor of her living room, their backs against the feet of Pepper’s sofa and an assortment of chocolate displayed between them, with half-drank wine glasses resting on the coffee table.
Steve sighed. “We were just trying to protect her.”
He was sitting on his living room sofa, a book in his hand and a blanket on his lower half. Steve had had dinner with Bucky over an hour ago and so he settled in with one of his baby books, his side table lamp being the only source of light. He noticed Bucky had left his phone. He’d only left 10mins ago and wondered if he’d realize and come back. If not, Steve had already sent a text to Sam to let him know, Bucky had left it at his place.
“Like that ever stopped you before,” he mused and his left leg was hiked up over Steve’s shoulder. He was pulled off the counter a little and Steve sank into him. He was tight; every single time and Steve knew he wasn’t going to last long. Tony moaned louder than he should. Steve grabbed his ass – that was now hanging off the island – with one hand and rested the other on the small of his back, holding him in place. He tried to stifle his own moans in the crook of Tony’s neck. He found himself biting down on the skin and Tony cried out.
.” Harley quipped which left Torunn and Anna giggling.
“Yeah.”  Pepper chuckled. “Can you pack the salad?” She gestured to the salad sitting on the kitchen counter and Amelia got to it. They got the food together and drove over to Tony’s.
“For today? Yes,” he shot back, grinning proudly at her. “Wonderful to see you again dear sister.”
After that they engaged in a conversation about what was going on in Wade’s life since he got Ellie back. Wade shared his initial meeting with Ellie after not interacting with her for 2 years. Wade had even tried learning some Spanish to communicate with her. It wasn’t any good and it had Eleanor cracking up. ‘I speak English, you know,’ the 5-year-old had explained. Wade was left flabbergasted. Carmelita had told him Eleanor only spoke Spanish. Clearly, she had lied. Ellie even knew who he was which was surprising for Wade. A couple hours with her and they had gotten along great. Wade knew if Peter wasn’t enough to make him a better person, Ellie would do just fine.
Sorry for errors. I wrote this on my phone.
“What’s that?” Tony popped up behind him, staring directly at the necklace.
“Alright” He said firmly. “I’ll find someone else to give my virginity to.” And he exited Wade’s kitchen to take a seat on his couch. Wade sighed and ceased his meal prep completely to follow after him.
Peter was dumbfounded, and Morgan almost broke her neck with how fast she spun around. Did she hear that right? She looked around at everyone. Everyone else must have heard it too. Carol, Pepper and Rhodey were the only people that didn’t seem fazed by it. They must have known.
After that, he let Tony get some rest while he tended to their kids. He owed him that. But not before kissing him like his life depended on it. “I love you.” He reminded him.
“I don’t want to be the Queen of Wakanda.” Winter explained. Bucky wasn’t fazed by her confession. He wouldn’t force that on her even though she had agreed to it before. He only wondered what had changed her mind.
“Cause we’re family. And we don’t get to choose our family.” Bucky added, passing a plate to Steve and setting one on either side of him for himself and Sam.
Steve wanted to get up and confront Tony but his limbs were numb. He was getting drossy. He couldn’t make out what was happening anymore.
(See the end of the chapter for
They had married in a small ceremony in December of last year and it broke Tony’s heart. He didn’t think they were ready for marriage - Peter was barely 18 years old - 18 and 4 months to be exact and still in high school.
“A trick? A spell?” she mocked. “What do you think we are?” It was a rhetorical question. Jacob didn't plan on answering anyways. “We’re not witches or wizards. We’re Gods.” She whispered as a green glow emitted from her body outlining her figure.
Tony laughed it off. “I’m kidding sweetie.”
“Nothing.” She lied. Especially not about Remy and the secret between them.
“And you still kinda are.” Michelle put in.
“So me, Betty, Michelle and Calvin are going to the movies on Saturday. Wanna come?” Ned asked from the earpiece in his ear.
“Hey…Steve.” Bucky began slowly. He wasn’t expecting Steve over so soon. He opened his door wider so Steve could get in. “I didn’t know you were
“Neither have I.” Peter added. They were in the same boat and Peter convinced himself he should have already known this. Wade always told him, he was the first and only guy he’d ever been romantically involved with.
Morgan spoke before Harley did. She wished he’d stop beating around the bush. “What’s up Harley?”
Morgan had been avoiding this for a while now. That was her mistake. She had been feeling extremely ill for the past few days. She even mentioned it to Nathan because he would be the first to know. He had suggested they get a few pregnancy tests and then they’d go from there. Amelia had gone with her to get them. Nathan offered to stay with her whenever she took them, but she told him she wanted to do that on her own. And Nathan understood that. So, she bought the tests. Had them hidden away in her room so she wouldn’t have to see them. But that was a couple days ago. She even forgot about them until she felt her dinner rising up her throat the night before during that god-awful family dinner.
If Tony was being honest, he was just busy throwing up and fortunately enough he was desperately in need of a bath after all that puking so it wasn’t really a lie anymore. “I took a warm bath instead.” He explained. “Without you.” He added, apologetically.
“Of course.” He commented. He put a fake smile on and let Tony finish getting ready. Tony grabbed his phone and gave Stephen a peck on the cheek to announce his departure. Stephen pulled him back, picking Tony up, pressing him up against a wall and going in for a proper kiss.
Tony chuckled. “You’re just trying to get into my pants, aren’t you?” Or maybe that's what Tony wanted.
“How are my parents okay with this? How is my father okay with this?” Surely Steve Rogers couldn’t be okay with this. They were just going to let Wade, a 29-year-old man, have his way with their almost 18-year-old son. He wondered if they had found out about Remy and Anna’s relationship yet. It had only been two months. What was happening in this house, really? Why was Wade Wilson suddenly a part of their family?
Peter had brought Wade by a day after the whole debacle. Wade wasn’t the least bit worried about it but Peter was freaking out. They rode the elevator to the 3
“Hi Ellie, I’m Peter.” Peter introduced himself.
Morgan had stopped eating and responded, plainly. “I don’t want to talk about Mom.” Anna had noted that no one wanted to talk about her mother. No one wanted to talk about the Christmas Party. No one wanted to talk about
"Dad. This is the 4th one." Harley lectured. His father sat behind his desk in his office listening to his sons telling him what he can and can't do with his money. "Do we need to remind you of what happened with the 3rd one?" He glance over at Peter as he spoke and Tony was left thinking back to his 3rd marriage.
“You’re not my Queen.” Carol reminded her and Sif was sure she was going in for the kill. She wanted her to try it. But Valkyrie came just in time and interrupted their little cat fight.
Anna:
Yes he did. Watching Tony was one of his favorite hobbies. As perverted as it sounded, it was all truth.
Harley was surprised. He definitely wasn’t expecting to hear that. He straightened up. “I’d never suggest that. You’re a princess after all. My chances with you are non-existent and you happen to be my sister’s best friend. I’d never.”
floor of Tony’s home. Nathan disappeared with Morgan not long after into the home theatre where, Peter, Michelle, Ned, Torunn, Amelia and Calvin already were. Nat and Bruce found Tony on the phone. He motioned for them to sit while he poured them both a drink.
Tony reached for the pained area and was met with the sight of blood on his fingers, soiling his new engagement ring and gushing from a wound when he looked down. His ears began ringing as chaos ensued in the crowd. Tony staggered backwards, getting light-headed but he was caught - by Stephen, he assumed. He put pressure on his wound and Tony groaned.
Tony couldn’t hold back his laugh. He thought that was clever. “Ha-ha funny”.
“Aw.” Anna cooed at their interactions and Harley removed his fingers from between Torunn’s legs. “Congratulations you two.”
“It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to go through but I know I’ll get through this because I have so much love and support from my family and friends.”
And just like that Tony’s family grew exponentially. Even more so when Sam, Wanda, Pietro, T’challa, Vision and everyone else joined the team. That progressed for the next 10 years.  Naturally, there were hiccups, during that period. One of the most infamous ones being that incident in which Tony and Steve almost destroyed an airport hamper from fighting because Tony had caught Steve in a moment with Sharon Carter and the world dubbed it, Civil War. Sharon had come on to him, but he never did anything with her. Tony didn’t believe him of course because once a cheater, always a cheater. Besides such occurrences the team did what they did best.
It shouldn’t be surprising that he and Tony had known Remy was Hammer’s killer. They found out only weeks after the incident which was a gateway to revealing Anna’s connection to Hammer.
“So we’re having a baby?” Bruce added, patting Nathan’s shoulder.
“She has a son. An almost 18-year-old son.” He said, simply.
Morgan had been mum long enough. She wasn’t oblivious to the way both of her parents always babied her little brother. “Dad. Mom. What happened to no judgements?”
“I’ve never done anything with Peter. He’s still a virgin.” Wade confessed, feeling wounded and humiliated. “And he’s 17 now, he can consent to sex…” he trailed off when Steve glared at him. “…if he wants to,” he finished.
Their eyes met and that one look made everything clear. She knew that he knew. They had a kid together.
“Wow,” was all Torunn could say. Morgan was sure Torunn was drooling.
Thank you for reading! If you liked it, what was your favourite part?
Tony watched as their mouths fell open and a chuckle escaped from him. “Are we sure we want another kid?”
I crave feedback 😗
“Maybe, Uncle Tony is happier with Strange.” Torunn provided.
“I see that.” She stated. “Come on, let’s go open some presents,” and then she was dragging him towards the Christmas tree.
“I’m going to hopefully meet Paige today.” Paige’s new name was Anna Marie as appointed by her foster parents. Hammer had explained to Tony that he had taken Paige from the hospital the day she was born, with the help of a doctor and had her set up in foster care. Just another way to hurt Tony but he felt like that was only half of the truth though. He’d let things be for now however, if he got his daughter back in his life.
Tony was exactly 13 weeks along, due early February but hadn’t found out the gender yet. Regardless, their children were all very excited for a new sibling as were his/her parents. This baby would have so much love and attention. They were already so lucky.
“That’s the second time.” Torunn noted, eyeing Lila suspiciously. She could sense the animosity towards her and if she had to guess, there must have been some jealousy at the root of the problem.
Peter spoke up after a moment to apologize for all the allegations tossed at his sister. He felt worse than his older siblings and full of guilt, knowing he distrusted the person he shared a womb with and should have been the closest with – his twin. She was so new to their family; it couldn’t have felt good being verbally and later, physically attacked by them. Peter just had to apologize on his, Morgan and Harley’s behalf and he got up to go meet her across the room. They hugged and Anna had no problem forgiving him. Morgan wondered how she’d react to her apology.
“Only for a time.”
“I am not my cousin Harley Stark Rogers. I will not sleep with you.” She knew the nature of his relationship with Nertha. Nothing was a secret with this extended family.
“No.” Harley informed her, sipping on the soda in his cup as opposed to some type of alcohol he’d be drinking in the previous years. “My mom planned this one.”
“Could be an affair.” Harley pointed out while he folded his arms. That wasn’t concrete enough evidence.
“Tony, he –” Nat got cut off.
He was supposed to play nice. Steve sighed, shaking Wade’s hand. A wide smile grew on Wade’s face as he peeped over at Peter to see if he was seeing this too. Peter nodded again letting out a little chuckle.
Torunn sat up straight. “Still a virgin.” She shrugged. “And I still have to meet suitors.”
“The better question is, ‘who was that?’ because it sounds like he’s totally into you.” Michelle remarked.
“Friday has been override until further notice.” Came Karen’s voice.
“I think you're even more beautiful up close,” he repeated the words Wade had said to him that one-night weeks ago that they almost kissed. Peter could see his lips curl into a smile for the first time and he pressed his lips to Wade's cheek briefly.
“Morgan,” Nat answered honestly. “I’m worrying for her. I can’t imagine how she must be feeling.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?”
“Your highness.” He responded, bowing slightly.
Wade stuck his hand out. “I’m Wade, Mr Rogers.” Steve stared down at his scarred hand. Tony nudged him, reminding him it was his idea to
She could not comprehend why everyone was speaking of a union with Harley so nonchalantly.
“Thanks.” Morgan grinned. “You know you can stay with us if you ever want to.” She went on, grabbing her phone off the coffee table as it rang signalling a notification. It was a message from her mother. It was talk about Anna and Peter’s upcoming party. Tony was requesting her help with some party preparations which she’d gladly do.
The appointment went as planned. The doctor checked the baby’s heart rate, looked at the ultrasound, checked Steve’s weight and gave the duo some general information as Steve was entering his 5
Harley was less susceptible to the idea. That was his little brother seeing an older man.
. In all honesty, however, Tony never wanted to step foot in that house again after he got his mother out of there. There were too many bad memories there. She had stayed with Howard for all those years enduring his abuse, with the hopes of giving Tony a proper and stable family home. In the end though, it did more harm than good but he would never tell her that.
“I’m happy for you Wade.” Really, truly, Peter was but it wasn’t fair of him to do what he did. “Just don’t leave me again.”
Morgan decided to send her a quick text. Maybe she’d be interested in Pietro. Torunn lingered on screen and Amelia went to answer her front door following the ringing of the doorbell. Pepper was expecting a package today; Amelia figured that’s what it was – UPS or FedEx dropping it off. Instead she opened the door and found herself in the presence of a man dressed in a long open coat standing before her. His eyes were red with black sclerae, his hair was dark auburn, and he had a deck of cards in one hand.
“I thought maybe we could have a family dinner tonight. I brought Shawarma,” gesturing to the bags in his hand. It wasn’t unusual for them to still have family dinners from time to time but what was weird was that Steve never came over unannounced. He always called ahead to make sure the kids were there because they were the only reason he ever showed up to Stark Mansion anymore since the divorce.
Anna seemed as though she was about to argue when Tony interrupted. “We can talk about it more at a later time.”
Tony put a stop to their bickering before they started again. “I never thought I’d have to say this but,” Tony paused, addressing Stephen first. “No matter the amount of hatred,” he glanced at Steve briefly “I have for Steve, it doesn't take away from the fact that he is still the father of my children so I'm going to need you to at least respect him.”
“Anna isn’t a killer.” Peter defended her, easily. His twin wasn’t a killer.
.” He emphasised the last word. It made Tony feel small but not for long.
What woke him minutes later, was Steve pressing a sweet kiss to his lips before a damp towel was wiping his lower regions. He finished the task quickly and placed another kiss to Tony’s cheek.
Steve ignored him all together, not moving an inch. “You look really good Tony. I just miss being near you and I never stopped loving you.” He pushed a lock of his dark hair out of his face and looked down at him with his shiny baby blues. But Tony’s been there, done that and he wasn’t going back. He hated when he said shit like that.
“Yeah. Huge.” He humoured her. “I hope you like it sweetie.” He really hoped she did. He hoped it wasn’t too overwhelming. She still wasn’t fully back to her old self yet. He hoped this didn’t stunt her recovery.
Thor joined them, kissing his wife’s cheek and embracing his daughter. “You look lovely, Torunn.” He stated and Torunn thanked her father. “Ready?” He offered his hand to hers. She nodded and took her father’s hand. Thor led her out her dressing room, down the halls and towards the grand doors of the ball room where her future husband and all her family and friends were waiting. Sif went ahead of them.
As some of you may know, I lost a lot of work which is why this chapter took forever to be uploaded. Had to rewrite a couple chapters (in advance) and it was honestly so much harder than writing from scratch.
“Do you think we’ll ever be like that?” Amelia spoke after a beat. Jacob peered down at her and wrapped his arm around her waist.
“Sure thing. I won’t say a word to Uncle Tony.” Torunn promised and Anna knew her word was gold, it came with her good-hearted nature.
“What was that?” He whisper-shouted, still in disbelief. His eyes focused more so on Tony than Anna. He had never seen such a side of Tony before and he could not understand it. Tony wasn’t a killer. He was good. His heart was pure.
Maria’s voice broke her train of thought. “I had countless miscarriages before I had Tony.” She confessed. Morgan didn’t know that.
“Also. I know Sharon’s having a girl, but I want to remind you that I was your first daughter. You had us first.’” Morgan gestured to herself and her siblings. “We were your family
“You can call us by our names, that’s fine.” Tony promised her. She could do whatever she was comfortable with. They could be Tony and Steve or Mom and Dad, whichever she chose would be okay with them. They were just happy to have her there with them.
“Better than da Vinci.” Steve confirmed. You could just hear the irritation in his voice.
"He can't say that to you, baby." Tony promised him. "He wasn't serious. He's just upset. Remember I told you, his other father left - left us."
He held his hand out for a handshake and Stephen took it without hesitation. “I’m Johnathan Doeran.”
Nova begins her line of questions. “Mrs. Stark.”
“And me?” He sat back on his side of the bed. Tony was leaning at the bathroom door. He figured, putting this distance between them might help.
“You think I’m over thinking it?”
“I just don’t know how we’d be able to fix
Steve gets up from the stand with that and walks straight out of the room, out of the building and unto the back steps. He takes a deep breath to calm his nerves. Sam and Bucky join him, but he just wants to be alone. He doesn’t want to know what the judge decides if it isn’t in his favor.
“You need to drop her like a bad habit,” Were Sam’s final thoughts on the matter before they started talking about their kids again and Bucky revealed that he and Sam were trying for another baby. Winter was a miracle after years of trying and failing to conceive so they were hoping to get lucky again.
“I know you would want me to have an abortion –” He started but was interrupted. He saw Steve shake his head as he spoke.
Tony made to exit the stage when Stephen came up. He took one of Tony’s hands in his and Tony soon realized that Stephen had a mic on him when he spoke and his voice filled all the speakers in the room and by extension, got everyone’s attention. Tony could not begin to fathom what was happening.
Also, what do u think Steve and Tony are having (boy or girl)?
“That’s good.”
“Win-win.” Pepper realized. Carol nodded and took another sip of her wine. “What’s going on with the Hammer investigation?”
“So Stephen, what type of doctor are you?”
Torunn made a face of disgust and Morgan faked throwing up before laughing. Amelia snapped out of her trance at the loud laughter. “I have. I’m just reminiscing. Like you guys never had crushes.”
“It just looks really suspicious, Nat.” Bruce explained. “I can’t confirm for sure where you were that night.”
“How stupid can you be?” The boy doesn’t seem the slightest bit offended, so Steve continues. “I don’t want Tony. I just want my son back. I only got 3 days with him.” And Steve wonders why he mentioned the last part when it was clear, the kid was too far gone to sympathize.
"At least get a flipping prenup Dad so this one doesn't leave u high and dry!" Harley shouted, before storming out the room.
Next Chapter: Always Him
“Oh.” Thor paused. “That’s great.” This was good news. Valkyrie had been by herself for years now and Thor knew she wasn’t happy. But then he noticed she wasn’t sharing his smile. “Something the matter?”
“I agree.” Loki added, appearing on the balcony as well out of thin air. “You can’t possibly let him get away with ruining Peter’s innocence.”
Anna chuckled, playing idly with her necklace. “Never. We’d never, Dad.” She promised, glancing back at Remy and urging him to speak up. He owed them.
“Alright Stephen. You’ve definitely caught my attention but we’re going to need more wine if we’re going to be trading secrets.” And Stephen conjured up a portal with the circular motion of his fingers to the restaurant’s kitchen and pulled out two bottles of wine. Tony had already learned from Pepper that he use to dabble in superhero-ing but he didn’t know they would be having show-and-tell featured in their date. He would have brought a suit of armour otherwise.
“And I’m Dr Stephen Strange.” Stephen laughed.
Thoughts? Besides my many errors..
“Papa.” Winter called out as Bucky finished combing her hair. He was finishing the second braid before adding accessories. He was proud of how well he did her hair. When Winter was old enough to have her hair combed, Bucky was at a lost not knowing the first thing about caring for her tight curls. Luckily, Sam’s sister had offered to help, teaching her brother-in-law how to properly groom Winter’s hair type. Bucky welcomed the help and worked hard to learn all the different styles she could wear. Now, getting her hair done was just as enjoyable for Winter as it was for Bucky. It was a breeze.
“You knew exactly what you were doing. You both knew.” Tony’s voice cracked at the last word and his cries soon turned into sobs. Steve tried to pull him into his arms, but Tony pushed him away. What? Did he think a hug would fix this?
“You weren’t working with him?” He asked, following her. “To hurt Steve and Tony?”
Harley didn’t lie to Loki. He told him how he was feeling towards Torunn and Loki did an excellent job at reminding him that he had nothing to worry about. He explained that while he and Torunn were still getting to know each other properly, he shouldn’t be surprised if they grew feelings for one other.
They pulled apart and Tony took her face into his hands. All he could see was his little girl. “No baby. You’re okay.” Tony kissed her forehead again. “We love you so much. We all do,” he motioned to everyone else in the room. “We’re here for both of you.” He looked to Nathan.
The girls accepted that. They knew this was expected of Torunn as future Queen and she was no rule-breaker.
Lila perked up. “Okay. I’ve been talking over the phone with Nathan’s cousin or Aunt Nat’s nephew actually.” Morgan was less than pleased at the mention of Natasha. She’d been meaning to reconcile with her after uncovering the truth about the affair with her father. She just hadn’t gotten around to it yet. “Jaime. He’s visiting for Christmas and I think he really likes me, so we’ll see how that goes.”
“That damn super soldier serum.” Tony scoffed. “It’s modified your DNA since birth. And Harley’s and Morgan’s. Morgan’s more than yours or your brother’s though. I like to make sure you guys are okay. Like everyone else, we check for any possible powers at birth and overtime. Bruce did with Nathan. Nothing there.” Tony mentally thanked the Gods. How would they possibly deal with another Hulk? Another Hulk that would be dating his daughter. “You know Torunn - literally God. Jacob. Even little Winter – she’s stronger than she looks.” He finished.
