, Tony thought vehemently, before he returned Steve’s tentative smile with one of his own. “Okay. Let’s do it. Let’s take down a supervillain.”
Steve pulls his arm from beneath Tony and raises the covers, waiting until Tony has situated himself beneath them to roll over and press himself right against Tony's back. Steve winds his arm around Tony's waist, and nuzzles at the back of Tony's neck. It feels fantastic.
Not having done any research on the address the night before, Steve was forced to put the car's GPS system to use in finding Tony's house. He was a little surprised when the path took him out of the central area of the town, through a sparser residential region, and along the waterfront of a lake. It stood to reason, Steve supposed, that an eccentric billionaire in hiding would have the best house that was reasonable under the circumstances.
Still sensitive from the night before, Steve lasts an almost embarrassingly short time. He draws Tony up from between his legs after, and kisses him again, tasting himself on Tony's lips.
Steve felt suddenly naked even through the multiple layers of clothing he wore; embarrassment warred with purpose as Steve fought not to let his discomfort show.
Steve sat up on the couch - which thankfully had been deep enough to accommodate them both, with some intimate levels of spooning - and only took a moment of looking around before he spotted Tony at work at his massive computer terminal across the way.
Steve thought to ask the obvious: why him? But that was like looking a gift horse in the mouth, given his mission, and rather than intending to ask Steve on a date of some sort, Tony was probably just bored and lonely and looking to while away a few hours with company.
"It's okay," Agent Drew says from behind them. "I called in backup before we left. The cavalry should be here shortly."
“Or,” Steve added, “I can believe that there’s something fishy to what’s going on in this one. An illusion, or ... a shared simulation, or - something. It’s not right. I can feel it, and I know after what you saw, you can, too.”
“You’re all conspiring against me,” Tony complains. “Where’s Jarvis? Or Pepper? Might as well get them in on it, too.”
"I'm going to check on the team while I'm up," Steve says. "Let me know if you make any breakthroughs."
Tony is not typically much for cuddling up in bed after sex, but he happily crawls under the covers this time. Steve rests with his head against Tony's shoulder, fingertips stroking idly around the perimeter of the metal cover over Tony's heart.
"I have very demanding tastes," Tony said. He started the car, while the garage door rolled up behind them; the engine did not make a sound.
. "I didn't die when the plane crashed," he said, trying to keep the explanation as short and neat as possible. "I was just ... frozen. What one of the doctors called suspended animation, I guess."
Tony's entire body felt like one big bruise at this point, after being slammed around in the jungle without any armor. He didn't like admitting to his own shortcomings, but Tony knew that out of the armor, he was outmatched in physical prowess by pretty much all the other members of the team, even the ones who were regular human beings.
She seemed to consider for a moment, then shook her head. “No, come in. Have a seat.” She patted the edge of the bed.
Agent Melinda May stepped through the frame that was all that was left of the broken door. She stepped over to the man she'd undoubtedly sent through that door, and kicked the pistol away from his searching hand. Another well-placed kick sent the man into unconsciousness.
"What's the last thing you remember, before waking up here?" Tony asks, sliding over a tablet so that he can take notes.
"Surrender, Captain!" Madame Hydra demands, raising her pistol to bear. "You may be durable, but we'll see if you can survive a bullet to the head."
Steve laughed, feeling ridiculously exhilarated by the excitement of the crowd and the surprise of the kiss. "Happy New Year," he said.
“Right,” Tony said. He finished fastening his pants and stepped over to the nearest computer terminal. “I’ve been experimenting with a few different options for you to disable the armor, but the most obvious answer - an electromagnetic pulse - isn’t as viable as it would be if he didn’t have my stolen tech on board, which is shielded
"I thought plain old Tony was only supposed to be worried about plain old Steve," Tony pointed out. "Though I
involve some insinuation of offering repayment to his rescuer, because ... Tony might secretly be a supervillain, but he still had
“Yep,” Clint said, patting the armor on the back before he stepped away, toward the ramp out of the quinjet. “I want a shower, and like half a dozen pizzas. You hear that, JARVIS? Half a dozen pizzas!”
Tony shrugs out of the robe, letting it fall to the floor. He steps in close, and runs his hands down the lapels of Steve's suit jacket, before undoing the buttons on the front with sure fingers. Tony pushes the jacket from Steve's shoulders, before dropping his hands to Steve's belt buckle, beginning to unfasten it.
The landing was still hard, even with Thor’s efforts, and the Hulk waiting on the ground to catch them. The nose of the jet crashed into the Hulk’s massive palms and he dug in his feet, slowing their momentum as they skidded toward a cliff. By the time they came to a full stop, the Hulk was dangling precariously over a steep fall.
Steve folds himself into the chair opposite Namor, and places his hands on the tabletop in clear view.
Frustrated, Tony sits up and pulls the covers over his lap, not wanting to be caught in a completely compromising position should one of their teammates be on the other side of the door. But it's just Anthony, and he looks embarrassed as soon as he takes in Steve's shirtless state and glances past him to see Tony in the bed.
Cap glanced around and, satisfied that no further threats were about to arise, nodded. "Alright. Call us if you need anything else. Iron Man?"
The moment was gone, and Steve tried not to take its loss personally. For all that he and Tony were close - that Tony was Steve’s best friend in this brave new world - they still had only a few years of friendship behind them, and it would clearly take more time before they were ready to share everything. Steve was willing to wait. There were plenty of things he hadn’t yet found a way to tell Tony, either, after all. The things that related directly to Tony, to their friendship - and their relationship - came easy, now. But Steve had lived nearly thirty years in an entirely different place in time, had been shaped by a difficult childhood, in a society that had experienced one world war and was in the throes of a second by the time he stepped up and became Captain America. He and Tony were different as people, but Steve believed, with all his heart, that those differences made them work even better together. It just didn’t make the tough conversations, the places where they did clash, go any smoother.
Steve had known, for a while, that his feelings of camaraderie toward Iron Man differed considerably from what he felt toward Bucky, or Jim, or any of the others he trusted with his life on a regular basis. That he believed Iron Man to be, well, a
Steve was kind enough to right Tony's clothes and prop him up against the cabinets before he got up to clean himself off. When Steve was finished, he offered Tony a hand up, and didn't complain when Tony leaned half against Steve, half against the counter.
“Cap,” Iron Man said, voice oddly gruff and hollow through the helmet of the suit, “good luck down there.”
Tony stared down at Steve’s hand, took a breath, and retracted his own gauntlet before reaching out to clasp it. “Partners.”
Clint and Natasha fell quiet while the movie went on in the background. Steve watched with half his attention while he got the tree set up in front of the windows, and began to drape it with multi-colored lights. He'd gone very simple with his choice of ornaments, just the typical ball ornament fare in a variety of colors, though they seemed to be made from a plastic now that claimed to be shatterproof, rather than the glass ones of Steve's youth.
Steve looked thoughtful again, but this time something in his eyes was sharp. “So, taking out the reactor would take out the armor.”
"Sort of." Tony pushed up from the desk and wandered over to the row of computers. "I always had an interest in robotics, since I was a kid. Back before I ended up on my current career path. My interest didn't evaporate fully, obviously."
"Yeah." Steve glances up from the papers, looking Tony in the eye. "I went to art school, before the war broke out."
Tony hummed an acknowledgement and took the glass away, setting it on the nightstand. Then he shifted on the bed, rotating himself toward Steve. “I know. What you said, back there, about being forced to be someone you’re not ... you were right. And realizing that it was actually a day, maybe two, and yet I still have all these
Tony smiles, pleasantly surprised by the offer. "If you think this makes up for abandoning date night ..."
Steve smiles shyly back, and flounders with a hint of embarrassment as he realizes he's still holding Stark's hand. He lets go abruptly and clears his throat. "Sorry, sir."
The conversation stumbles a little on the introductions, but Steve is a fan of the magazine, and before Tony knows it, he’s invited Captain America into his workshop and is showing off the Iron Man. The way that Steve regards the armor with a mixture of reverence and awe, the way his hands look as he traces the dents and dings with his fingertips, convinces Tony that he just might be in trouble where keeping this one at arm’s length is concerned.
Tony grabbed the edge of the counter with one hand, and buried the fingers of his other hand in Steve's hair. Steve moaned agreeably at this handling, the sound vibrating right through Tony's groin and adding to the sensation; it only got more intense as Steve hollowed his cheeks like he was trying to suck Tony's brain out through his dick.
“He has been keeping a low profile, leaving you alone a lot lately,” Steve said, breaking Tony out of his thoughts.
"I'm greedy," Tony adds. "I'd really, really like to watch him fuck you." He flicks a glance up to Anthony, and smiles. "You want to know what it's like, don't you?"
The sound doesn't go unnoticed by the man's companions, and bullets begin to rain through the bedroom door. Steve rolls out of the way, ripping off the towel to avoid getting tangled in it, and comes up on the other side of the doorframe as one of the other Hydra agents comes rushing inside.
Steve cursed under his breath; he barely had time to shout for Iron Man before the ceiling came rushing down.
And yet, even while telling Steve not to blame himself, Tony can't help but wonder if things might have been different if the Iron Man and War Machine were not preoccupied with von Strucker.
Neither knew the other’s name, or even a face behind the helmet or mask, but that sort of thing didn’t matter so much as knowing they had each other’s back, and there was no doubt about that.
They fell silent then, and with neither of them having gotten much rest the night before - Steve's more a state of pain-related unconsciousness and Tony being awake dealing with SHIELD debriefing and everything else - it wasn't long before they drifted off together.
The doors slide open a moment later, admitting Steve into the room. He is still dressed from his mission, cowl hanging down behind his neck; it reminds Tony that he has an idea for a helmet to provide a greater layer of protection to the uniform, but for the time being he basks simply in the wash of relief he feels at seeing Steve in one piece again. Captain America out in the field without Iron Man to watch his back, well ... it just gives Tony an awkward sense of foreboding to think of it.
of Frank Finlay - that part of things was not so surprising - had explained to Steve that Tony Edwards was merely an alias, and that the adventures chronicled in
"Something like that." Steve paused. "I didn't even realize Howard had a son, until Director Fury briefed me for this assignment."
Tony blinked furiously against the sudden welling of tears; all throughout the funeral and other proceedings, he'd managed not to cry, too conscious of all the eyes of the public on him, waiting for a misstep. It was embarrassing but not unexpected that he'd break down now, with Jarvis, who'd always been there for him. Who never tried to be his father, never tried to take Howard or Maria's place, but still managed to feel like a
Steve decides to sweeten the pot, even so. "Jim is making arrangements to transfer out of Paris. You're going to need a Stark Labs facility in Madripoor for him to transfer to."
The mystery surrounding the Captain was enough to keep Tony curious, but after a few more weeks with no real news, it was easy to let thoughts of another masked vigilante fall by the wayside. Tony had enough to worry about in keeping his public reputation as Tony Stark, billionaire tech genius, separate from his private identity as the villainous Iron Man.
“No, it’s ...” Tony rolled onto his back and sighed up at the ceiling. They hadn’t made it to the bed tonight, or even the couch in its entirety. Steve had set Tony up on the back of it and swallowed him down, and when they were done, they’d just collapsed onto the floor behind it in a tangle of limbs, their pants open and shoes kicked off by the door.
"Oh, Anthony." Jarvis stood up and held out his arms, and didn't convey any judgment as Tony fell into the offered embrace and freely accepted the shoulder to cry on.
Steve opens his mouth to argue, takes one look at Tony's expression - maybe remembering what happened when Steve first woke in the Avengers' presence, so many years ago - and simply responds, "I see your point."
Some of Steve's fears about Tony's motivation in inviting him were allayed, as he saw very little of the man himself beyond a brief greeting as Tony darted past with what looked like a rocket and a gaggle of admiring pre-teens (probably the science club, Steve figured).
Anthony shifts, looking down as if he hadn't noticed before. "Huh. We should do something about that."
Steve shifts his weight from one foot to the other, looking admittedly a bit shifty beneath his cowl. "We could still get dinner?" he suggests. It sounds too much like a question for Tony to buy it.
"Oh, yeah," Anthony assures. He actually has a flush on his cheeks, which Tony finds endearing, while simultaneously certain he isn't, himself, capable of anything of the sort.
The firefight goes on for several minutes, until Steve goes to squeeze off a shot and hears only a resounding
Tony basked under the heat lamp like a big lizard rather than trying to maneuver his limbs into operating a towel, and he was half-asleep and mostly dry by the time he finished brushing his teeth. The bed was an appealing heap of softness, and Tony let himself fall face first into the pillows, his body protesting only a little as it collided with the squashy mattress.
Jim's group radios back after a few minutes that their area is clear, the experimental missile shut down and being disassembled by the Allies as they speak.
"So impatient," Tony says, turning his head to kiss Steve's knee, hitched up beside him. "We finally have all the time in the world, and you're in a hurry."
"Nothing like that. I can't get drunk." Steve thinks privately, though, that he would probably not, even if he could.
Steve was, Tony had learned, far from a shy flower; he closed his mouth around Tony and didn't hesitate in taking him right in, his hand closing around the base of Tony's cock and stroking what of his length Steve could not comfortably fit. Which, admittedly, wasn't much; Steve was pretty enthusiastic about giving head, and liked to practice and hone his craft.
"Huh." Tony rolled onto his side and propped himself up on an elbow to look down at Steve. "You know, my old man looked for you."
Tony was too restless to sleep in the hours before they would enact their plan, so Steve held him close and fucked him slowly, until they were both worn out and slipped into an exhausted, sated sleep.
The weight of the rubble is enough to buckle parts of the armor, and by the time Tony comes out of his momentary daze, he can feel one of the leg plates tightened uncomfortably around his thigh, and the joint of an arm stiffened with damage. The onboard system of the armor, which usually controls things like navigation and targeting, has gone out entirely.
“We weren’t always good,” Steve said grimly, thinking back to their many covert operations during the war, committing sabotage and infiltrating bases. “But we were on the side of right.”
"We haven't had much opportunity to talk since the accident," Jarvis said. His tone was as soft and comforting to Tony as it had always been, his accent mild after so many years living in the States, and soothing to the ear.
"You just barged in here and started shooting," Steve says. "Forgive me if I don't take your word for it!"
Then their mouths met in another kiss and Tony pushed up from the wall to climb Steve like Steve was a very well-muscled tree, hands grasping for purchase on the harness that held the curious shield to Steve’s back. Steve took the hint and slid one arm around Tony’s shoulders and the other under Tony’s ass to brace him as he picked Tony up and pivoted around toward the living room.
"Well." Tony shrugged. "You're pretty young, you probably had better things to occupy your time. But when I was a kid, my bu ... uh, my ... babysitter ... used to always put it on around the holidays."
Tony gasped when one of Steve's hands slipped down the back of his jeans and squeezed Tony's ass. "In the kitchen?" he wondered, glancing around.
“It’s okay,” Tony said honestly, reaching out to pat Steve’s arm. “Little hard to go from babysitting your boyfriend to, uh ... yeah.”
Tony is so preoccupied with his work that he doesn't notice Steve returning until the smell of food - the strong aroma of garlic and tang of tomatoes - hits his nostrils. He turns and sees Steve at one of the emptier workbenches, setting out Italian takeout, frankly monstrous pieces of lasagna and a heap of breadsticks. He's even brought a bottle of sparkling water in lieu of wine, the glasses he pours looking adorably out of place with disposable containers and flatware.
Steve made a grumpy noise. He knew he was being childish, but he still couldn't help noting, "I went the entire
Steve pushes open the door and walks inside, scanning the interior of the bar as he goes. Inside, the place is nicer than it appears; some of Madripoor's elite will roam out of Hightown just to come here for one fix or another, and tonight appears to be no exception to that rule. There are still several patrons milling about, the ones who look too deep in their cups to leave, slumped and sleepy-eyed with their elbows glued in sticky spots to the counter.
comfortable for an outside observer to grasp. Anthony spends less of his downtime brooding in the presence of his Steve, and much more being distracted by Steve and Tony in their bed (and, on one memorable occasion, the kitchen ... they just didn't make it as far as the bedroom).
Tony tugs a handkerchief from his pocket and gently wipes Steve's tears away. "Honey, it's not your fault."
"Steve," she says gently. "We know that Howard Stark was Baron Zemo. One of the Baron Zemos, at least."
Steve was already half-hard in his pants, and his cock eagerly responded to Tony’s touch, the way that Tony mouthed at the bulge of Steve’s growing erection through the layers of fabric. In spite of the purposeful way that Tony tugged down Steve’s zipper, it felt like an eternity before Steve was finally freed from the confines of his uniform.
Steve Rogers had his own washing machine - a dryer, too - back at his apartment in DC, up until SHIELD rolled in and stripped the place bare of all of Steve’s personal effects while he was Public Enemy No. 1, leaving the poor guy to start all over … again.
Ah, well - Tony couldn’t say he was surprised by that question, and at least it was one that he didn’t mind answering truthfully. “The same time I was held captive, when I got this -” He tapped at the arc reactor. “- I created the first suit to escape.”
He catches a cab milling about, and it's clear the driver was hoping for a Hightown tourist, given his surprised look when Steve announces, "Lowtown," as his destination.
Tony opened his mouth, gestured silently again, and closed his mouth when it seemed no words were forthcoming.
"It's good," Tony answered, gasping softly. His hand drifted down to cover Steve's, and Tony worked to speed the pace of Steve's strokes over his own cock.
Flushing with embarrassment, Steve hurriedly rolled to his feet and held out a hand to Tony. "Sorry," he apologized quickly, with no idea how he was going to recover from this one.
The double funeral, wake, and memorial services were exhausting media circuses, where Tony found himself being paraded around by Obie like a show dog. All of the old guard were eager to curry favor, as much as they clearly loathed the need to do so. Howard's mortality threw their own precarious positions into sharp relief, and they all feared what would happen when Tony came of age and was able to take over the company.
adage has rarely seemed more true, until Steve finds himself one of the last men standing, with bodies littered all around, and his gun solidly out of ammunition. Agent Drew is lying in a crumpled heap near Madame Hydra's feet, her ruse likely discovered; Steve hopes that she's still breathing, but right now he has bigger problems.
Bucky pushes his goggles into his hair and glances between Steve and Tony in a distinctly pointed fashion, a sly look on his face as if he can tell what they were doing without needing to witness it. "
Tony pushed himself up to sit, and shoved the rest of the way out of his jeans and boxers, kicking them onto the floor. "Your loss, I actually happen to give a fantastic blowjob."
Steve Rogers hated a lot of things about the twenty-first century, but contrary to popular belief, there were quite a few things he loved about it, too. The coffee shops that seemed to dot nearly every corner were one of his favorite things, especially since the weather had turned cold.
Steve wasn't unfamiliar with the concept of an electric car, and he couldn't imagine this one had been inexpensive. For a moment, though, he couldn't help thinking of the future expo he'd attended with Bucky, seventy years ago now, and the way Howard Stark had proudly presented his shiny red, flying car. What would Howard Stark think of this technology? Probably, Steve thought, he'd be incensed that
Edwin Jarvis, the family's trusted butler - and Tony's caretaker, mentor, and confidante - roused Tony from his sleep at three in the morning to take the phone call: a drunk driver had crossed the road and collided head-on with the Starks' vehicle as they headed home from the party. Maria was killed on impact; Howard was taken to the hospital, but the prediction was dire.
They'd not had time, just then, to take advantage of Steve's admitted interest. But when Tony got back from his round of meetings that afternoon, Steve had convinced him to keep on the suit, at least for a little while longer than usual.
“Not that I mind,” Tony added after a beat. “It could be kind of hot, I guess, just - not sure if there’s like a
"Eh, I'm pretty adaptable," Tony said. "Having a ninety-something-year-old, supposed to be dead guy walk into my life isn't the strangest thing that's ever happened to me."
"Well, whatever it was," Tony says, "you've got excellent taste in movies, Captain. Damn downer of an ending, though."
Steve sighed, setting aside his own dishes. “Part of what makes the Avengers so effective as a team is that we can all adapt to the necessary changes.”
Steve still couldn't figure it out. If what this Anthony Stark wanted was to live a quiet, normal life, then who were they to deny him that?
"Well," Tony said. "You were right. But you had one thing going for you." He reached back and picked up a mug from his desk; it was molded in the shape of a very cartoonish version of ... Steve's head. Captain America's head. It was sort of disturbing, actually.
Outside, Buccaneer Bay is indifferent to Steve's mood, thriving with its usual curious mix of high class travelers and lower class citizens. He pulls his coat collar higher and tries to blend in, but it's a futile effort when he stands head and shoulders above many of the people around him. It makes him a conspicuous and therefore unappealing target for thieves, at least, so the pickpockets roaming the area leave him alone as he picks his way through the crowd.
It was a weird arrangement, and yet it worked better than any actual relationship Tony had ever been in.
What would Tony be looking for a cure for? His heart, surely - searching for a way to fix his heart had been the driving force behind Tony's many adventures - but Tony had sounded so bleak on the subject. Reserving hope in case it didn't work?
"No problem." Steve paused, wracked his brain for a topic of conversation; meeting Tony outside of the school was, of course, ideal. Unfortunately, "that's a lot of cupcakes" was the best that he could come up with.
"My organization has been looking for you, Doctor," Steve says. "We've had you reported missing for a few months now."
He said it in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way, and they shared in their amusement for a moment, until Tony's attention gradually wandered to something outside; after a second he gave a low whistle.
Steve sweeps the whole mess onto the floor to be safe, and tries not to feel the remorse as he watches a dead man's work shatter into pieces.
Steve leaned over to kiss Tony, soft and reassuring, before he sat up. “I’m going to go get out of this uniform --”
Over the course of the next few months, Iron Man kept up his reign of corporate terror well outside the radius of Steve’s borough, eventually even expanding outside the Tri-State area. The Captain kept on operating outside the jurisdiction of the law, becoming an infuriating mystery for the 24-hour news cycle. Steve and Tony, in the meantime, progressed from casual sex to a plainclothes Steve occasionally showing up at Tony’s office with takeout for dinner and an offer to walk him home after.
To one corner of the area, though, nearly in the shadows, is a piano. And at the piano, a man is perched on the bench, the curvy silhouette of a dame on his lap, the two of them wreathed in smoke.
These days, Peggy was notably more carefree, and was said to be enjoying a casual romance with fellow former Commando, Gabriel Jones. Gabe left his enlistment behind when the war was over, but remained on with the military as a civilian contractor, now acting as a translator and language teacher.
"I feel amazing," Tony answered without hesitation. "Are you sure giving an amazing massage isn't your secret secondary superpower?"
this specific purpose. Then again, Jim does know Tony rather well ... even though he's discreet and kind enough not to mention it.
, though, not just yet; he just slid his slicked up cock along Tony's cleft, teasing between his thighs, nudging against Tony's balls. Once the moans he was wringing out of Tony started turning to a whine, Steve finally did line himself up and began pressing inside. Tony was still loose from the morning and took him easily, pressing back onto Steve's cock until Steve was all the way inside.
He pressed his hands down harder on the wound, and Steve laughed in spite of himself, wincing when it made the pain even worse.
Anthony pauses for another moment, then he laughs, sounding more like Tony than he has at any instance since his arrival. "If there's one thing I'm pretty sure Tony and I have in common," he says, stepping through the door, "it's that neither of us would pass up the opportunity to sleep with ourselves." He pauses, looking at Steve. "Especially with you in the middle."
“Steve,” Tony panted out, reaching up with both hands to grab at Steve’s hips, then his ass, dragging him down closer.
The lights came up to a dim setting, likely thanks to JARVIS, enough for Steve to make out Tony’s silhouette in bed. He was sprawled across it, rather than under the covers - what was it about Tony and his insistence on not using a blanket? - looking freshly showered with damp hair and his t-shirt riding up his stomach.
The twenty-first century - progression of history, technology, and pop culture references aside - wasn't particularly more daunting than the 1940's had been, and the leisure time was certainly new. He had lunch with Natasha, they watched a few more episodes of a documentary series on the universe, had dinner, and finally it was time for Steve to start getting ready.
Steve couldn’t help but wonder; though they had encountered the Guardians a time or two before, enough to be acquainted with the group as typical friends rather than foes, he hadn’t been aware that Tony and Peter had formed any real bond, but here they were speaking like friends. On the screen, past Tony’s shoulder, Steve could see that Quill was smiling, too.
"It's an artificial intelligence?" Steve asked, perking with interest. He peered at the machine - no, robot - again, tilting his head to the side.
The house was small and tidy, the doors in the hallway - except for one that Tony figured was probably a closet - all open and offering inviting glances into the rooms beyond. The hallway emptied out into the living room, where Tony found Agent Romanoff - Natasha - sitting on the couch, watching television; it looked like a documentary.
Tony kissed Steve again, and gradually they tumbled back onto the bed; at least for a little while longer, they could take comfort in the fact that someone else understood.
"Come out, Commander," the woman says again, her voice more urgent this time. "I've bought us a few minutes, but it won't take long before that wears off."
Someday, Steve wanted to take Tony apart like this, with just the slow and teasing touch of his fingers; he was sure he could make Tony come just from this, given how close Tony was, when Steve hadn't even touched his cock, yet. But Tony had different needs from sex and intimacy, especially after a rough day like today, and Steve knew Tony would appreciate more of a connection, the comfort and closeness of their bodies moving together with Steve inside of him.
"You know ... not much," Steve said, shrugging lightly. "I just moved into town a few days ago, so it's nice to get this opportunity to meet people."
“As long as Iron Man is there to catch me.” Steve smiled, squeezing Tony’s hand. “Come on, let’s get some rest, then we can make a plan.”
Steve shrugged, setting down his bags, careful to angle them so that none of their contents would spill out. "Why not?"
Tony went through everything, from faking his own death to having Iron Man turn over a new leaf, publicly, in his resentment of Tony’s public persona, and none of it produced the desired result, the likelihood of success for any of the more far-flung ideas ranging from one to eight percent.
The three SHIELD agents constituted most of Steve's friends in the twenty-first century, although of them all, he knew Clint the least. Agent Barton always seemed to be off on some assignment or another, and Steve was a bit surprised to see the man there.
Steve didn’t quite look at Tony like he had turned out to be made of glass, but it was a near thing. “Then it’s even more beautiful,” he said at last. “Because it’s keeping you alive.”
Cars were already pouring out of the double driveway and onto the curb in front of the house; Steve had to park two houses down and across the street, and walk the rest of the way. The other houses were oddly quiet, and Steve decided the neighbors must either be away for the holidays already, or maybe attending the party.
Tony glanced down at the art store bag in Steve's hand, before stepping forward and extending a hand. "Tony Carbonell," he said.
Steve raised his eyebrows, unsure what to think. Was he being asked on a date of some sort, or was Tony just bored and lonely and looking to while away a few hours with company?
Tony turned to the nondescript SHIELD sedan. "Well, I guess it's not the worst thing I've ever ridden in."
“Trust exercise,” Tony’s modulated voice said in his ear. “Told you if you fell backwards, I’d catch you.”
“Tony,” Steve said firmly. “You did what you thought was right, what was necessary. I might have been frustrated by it at the time, but if you had been out there worrying about what happened to everyone else, then it would have made you a liability. I know we’ve had a lot of arguments over this in the past, but in this case - it was right. You saved the world.”
Tony shrugs. "You're welcome to stay here as long as you like, but at the end of the day, we both know that you're not staying in Madripoor and I'm not leaving."
Steve reached out to grab Tony's elbow once they were in the hallway, and Tony pulled to a reluctant stop. "Hey," Steve said. "What was that about?"
"Tell me about it," Steve said, laughing softly. He knew Natasha would chide them both for not sticking to their cover right now, but there was no one around to hear, and they swept the place for bugs on a daily basis.
"It's not like we're obligated to do anything," Steve said, as he walked over to sit on the edge of the bed, a companionable distance away.
The moment could have - probably should have - become awkward from there, but Steve was smiling, awash with the afterglow even if they weren't exactly lingering in a place where they could settle in for pillow talk and a cuddle.
"I've got two hands." Steve grins up at him, obviously in a good mood. Those are rarer and rarer these days, with what Steve has been through lately, and Tony is grateful for it, though he isn't certain whether he's the cause, or if a successful mission can take the credit.
," Steve said, even as his hand settled on the curve of Tony's ass. "But I have a hard time saying no to you."
Sternberg doesn't seem to catch the joke, or if he does, then he doesn't find it funny. "Very well. What can I do for you,
Steve moans softly, shifts back into the touch a little, opening up sweetly for Tony as Tony's fingers begin to press inside him. "Is that so?"
"No one cares what we do here," Steve points out. He twists his wrist on the hand wrapped around Tony's cock, and presses a fingertip into the sensitive skin behind his balls.
The movie that began to play seemed to be more holiday themed fare, but nothing Steve had caught in his marathon with Clint and Natasha. Rather, it was much
This is almost certainly where Steve was headed earlier with Tony, before they got interrupted, but Tony isn't jealous; he's wasted a lot of his time being jealous over one lover of Steve's or another through the years, wanting what they had, and it's the benevolence that comes with being confident over his own place in Steve's life that allows Tony to keep such an open mind now. It helps, too, that Tony
"Exactly," Coulson said. "I haven't been able to do much more than keep an eye on him. He evidently isn't the type to warm up to an authority figure, so my hope is that a fellow teacher might do the trick."
"The last few months of the war," she answers. "Without anyone pulling the strings, it's probably taken longer than usual to manifest. SHIELD believes that Tony Stark brought Berthold Sternberg here to help research a cure - and Hydra believes that Sternberg successfully broke down the formula as part of that. The leader of the new regime, Madame Hydra, feels that another Zemo would be a threat to her power - but the Zemo formula is an extremely potent mind control drug, and who knows what she could do with that."
"Over easy, please," Steve said. He glanced down at his palm, remembering the car. "Hey, do you know how I can look up a license plate number?"
"Then perhaps you should take some time for the next few months. Get out of the public eye, do some traveling, and when you're ready, you can return with a clear head," Jarvis suggested.
It seems remarkably unfair, to get Tony back after two years of waiting and wondering, only to have this happen. They survived a war together; will things really end like this?
"Hmm." Tony situated himself to straddle Steve's lap, knees coming to rest on the bench either side of Steve's thighs. "I don't know, I think we could make it work."
Steve didn’t think he much wanted to sleep, but his body was tired, and it took merely closing his eyes before he drifted off. Hours later, he woke to the feeling of Tony’s lips on the back of his neck, and a hand on his hip. Steve murmured soft, sleepy approval for the touch, and the fact that Tony was pressed warmly against his back.
Gradually, Steve picked up his pace and Tony had to brace himself harder against the desk to keep from sliding across it from the force of Steve's thrusts. It was perfect and not enough all at once; he could tell from the shift of Steve's breathing that Steve was getting close. A few seconds more, a particularly rough thrust, and Steve buried himself inside Tony as he came, his head falling to Tony's shoulder, and he actually bit down on the fabric of Tony's jacket to stifle himself.
"Well, come on. Let me buy you a drink, Cap, then I'll show you the Iron Man. I have it on good authority that you're dying to see it."
Steve sighed softly, ruffling the hair on the back of Tony's neck. "I'm going to say we're due a talk with Thor and the Hulk."
"Uh huh." Tony raised an eyebrow. "It knew I went over the spending limit on Secret Santa, so out with it, Cap."
Somehow, they manage to make it out of bed by late morning, where Tony finds several missed calls from Reed. He tries not to look too guilty when he calls back, even if Anthony snickeringly teases from the background that Reed is too dense to notice that Tony
"How long since you got out of the Army?" Tony asked, as he stepped over to a small, utilitarian kitchen area that sat next to the theater space. He grabbed two bottles of beer from the refrigerator, and uncapped them before handing one to Steve.
, that lent the word all the meaning it needed for Steve to understand that Tony was talking about the first time they were involved with each other. Back then, their affair really had been frantic and secret, and it dissolved as easily as the team had, when the Avengers disbanded. The months they spent apart after that had been some of the longest of Steve’s life. He was the one who hadn’t wasted any time rekindling things when they got back together.
a genius,” Tony said, going for levity, but Steve clearly wasn’t buying it. When Steve sat down on the edge of the bed next to him, Tony sighed.
Tony led the way to the elevator, and Steve settled in behind him, studying their reflections in the shiny chrome of the elevator doors. Steve put his arms around Tony's waist and drew him in close, resting his chin on Tony's shoulder.
In the confusion, Steve sees Agent Drew fall into action. She does something with her hands and suddenly the two men next to her inexplicably turn on each other. When Agent Drew drops the handcuff key behind her back, Steve rocks away from the still dazed Madame Hydra in order to catch it. He only manages to get the cuff off one wrist before another Hydra soldier rushes him.
Peggy sighs. "We haven't known the entire time," she says. "We've been tracking him for a few months now, keeping an eye on him."
Steve felt guilty waking him, since Tony needed sleep just as much as he needed food, but as far as Steve was aware, even a body powered by an arc reactor couldn’t create energy without food. Steve set the tray he was carrying on the nightstand and sat on the edge of the bed, reaching out to tug Tony’s shirt back down.
Steve spent part of the day acquainting himself with some of the art supplies he'd picked up in town - the set of beakers he got at Tony's party came in handy as holders for his pens and pencils - and enjoying some time to himself. The peace and quiet was good for reflection; Steve hadn't much liked being alone with his own thoughts, early on after waking from the ice, always finding something to keep himself busy, but now he appreciated the opportunity to sort the jumble.
"I was in the Army," Steve said. "But ... I was lucky enough that my best friend and I were stationed together." There, that was neither a lie nor too much of the truth. Certainly it was a broad enough story that it could apply to practically any service member.
Natasha nodded again, an understanding expression on her face. Steve glanced at her, and shifted uncomfortably in his chair, still unable to put the pieces together.
- having caught up with him at last. He wakes up minutes, or maybe hours, later to the feeling of someone stroking his hair.
It was a solid couple of minutes before Steve could convince himself to move, and then it was more out of consideration for Tony's comfort than his own. He lowered Tony back down to the bed and slipped out of him, offering an apologetic kiss when Tony grunted a protest at all the movement.
Tony looked tired and a little bit wilted, even in his armor; he still had his helmet off, laying on the seat beside him, and his hair drooped across his forehead. He had taken up residence at a computer console, but hardly seemed to be paying attention to the readings, his eyes glazed. He looked nothing, right now, like the glamorous billionaire who often graced magazine covers.
“I didn’t know,” Steve said. “But I strongly suspected.” When Tony didn’t respond immediately, he elaborated, “The Stark tech, the fact you’re the smartest guy I know and you couldn’t seem to figure out who Iron Man was ... there was only one thing that really made sense, after I put all the pieces together.”
"You've been kidnapped," Steve says, in a soft, soothing tone. "Brought from your world to our own. We found you and are working to get you home."
"Just a little run down, is all," Tony says. He tugs off the repulsor gauntlet and begins unbuttoning his shirt.
"There are still a few rogue Hydra agents to be tracked down and cleaned up," Steve says. "And there are rumors of movement in the area by the Soviets."
was enough to have the feds dogging him, though, because Iron Man particularly liked engaging in corporate espionage and sabotage. It was less nefarious than anyone assumed: mostly, Tony just really disliked it when competitors stole his property -- intellectual or physical -- and he made a point of seeing to it that they could make no real use of their ill-gotten gains.
Tony's eyes flicker up to Steve's face, his own face contorting for a moment as if he wants to be angry, but simply doesn't have the energy. He reeks of whiskey; no matter how good the stuff Tony is drinking, he smells like he's bathed in it.
"Hmm." The sound Tony made was non-committal; he drank from his beer, then asked, "So, Steve. I can call you Steve, right? What's your story?"
Steve laughs softly, rubbing his fingertip a bit lower. Tony draws up his knees - a bit precarious - and presses back into it, hips still rolling up into the rhythm of Steve's other hand.
Tony rolled his eyes, but his own exasperated reply was lost when Steve pulled back and thrust forward again, dissolving Tony’s words into an incoherent moan.
Steve could sense Tony was about to follow that up by asking him what was the matter, and Steve was having none of that; he shook his head, sliding his hands down to hook his thumbs in the waistband of Tony's boxer-briefs.
“Yeah,” Steve said softly. “I don’t know what to say to that, Tony. As much as it means to me that Howard cared that much, I don’t like the idea that he never moved on from my disappearance, either.”
Tony pressed back against Steve, deliberately brushing against his hard cock. "Nice to know you didn't get bored during all that," he teased.
Tony is just as handsome as he always was, every inch the dashing playboy, though he has traded out his chinos and boots for a linen suit, and instead of a neat mustache he wears a full vandyke and a few days worth of stubble.
“Yeah, J, I got that,” Tony said. He peeked out of the doorway and watched as a tall, broad silhouette caught the thing -- a shield -- that just recently bounced off Tony’s aching head.
Tony is not himself, that much is clear to Steve, but a lot can happen to change a man in two years. Tony hadn't taken it well when they dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and he'd gone missing shortly thereafter, while Steve was still preoccupied helping the cleanup efforts in Europe.
Tony lifts his faceplate and leans in to give Steve a kiss, once he's sure all prying eyes have moved on or are otherwise suitably distracted. "Go," he says. "I'll mop up here and be on standby if you need me."
Steve wants to ask if Tony missed him, too; if Tony ever thought about this, but Tony is moving over him, making his way down Steve's body, and for a moment all Steve can think about is reaching out and stopping him.
And there were also nights like tonight, where Steve dropped in through the open window and molded himself against Tony’s back, and they ended up making a complete mess sweeping papers and parts off Tony’s workbench so that Steve could bend him over it.
Steve does stop arguing, but he's still quietly weeping, tears running down his cheeks and off the slope of his nose. His eyes are red and swollen.
style adventure was exciting, no matter how much he had grown up since those magazines first came out.
At that, to Tony's surprise, he dismisses the soldiers with a gesture. Tony tests his bonds, but finds the angle a bit awkward with the high back of the chair rising all the way above his head.
It was maybe inevitable, then, that one of Tony’s personalities would someday cross paths with the Captain; he just hadn’t thought that it would happen to be both at once.
"You must still run on military time," Tony announced as he emerged from elsewhere in the house. "Right on time."
Steve set aside the card, peeled off his gloves, and stretched out next to Tony. “I know, Tony. For what it’s worth, I’m sorry you felt that pressure. You’re your own hero.”
Steve cards his fingers in Tony's hair and gradually leans down for a kiss, which Tony happily obliges. When Steve breaks apart, he says softly, a little petulantly, "I wanted to do that for you."
It was almost worth it just to see the surprise on Barton's face, but Coulson didn't doubt his gamble, and it wasn't mere hero worship. Steve Rogers just had a way with people, a genuine quality that was hard to ignore, and regardless of Stark's investment in Captain America, Coulson was sure that a little of the old fashioned approach was just what the situation needed.
pass out half way through the kiss, and slides into an unconscious slump against Steve's shoulder. Steve tries to wake him up, but ultimately is left with little to do but hold him until help arrives.
“Oh, yeah,” Tony said, his expression brightening. “When I kicked on the autopilot and went down on you.”
"Yep." Tony leaned in and kissed Steve, putting a clever bit of tongue to use in proving his point. "Maybe I'll show you later."
"Steve," Tony says carefully. "I never elaborated on it in the magazine, I didn't allow Pepper to write about it, but Baron Zemo? Turned out to be my father. Howard."
Tony departed with a hint of his own awkwardness, and Steve sighed. He got the distinct feeling he had just blown it, even though he couldn't put his finger on exactly what went wrong ... if, in fact, anything actually had.
bad, Rhodey argued - but it was low-key and held enough clothes and personal belongings to tide him over on a long road trip.
Tony rolled his eyes, but he did get motivated enough to wriggle under the sheets once Steve got out of bed and went to the bathroom to wash up.
Steve laughed, turning his head to kiss the inside of Tony's knee. "And where did you hear that?" he wondered.
Later that evening, once Tony and Jim are out of the armor and they've all had dinner, Tony retires to his cabin and settles in with his schematics, fresh graphing paper, and a set of good pencils. He misses his workshop fiercely these days, not finding much time to get back to Manhattan with a war on, but when he has a spare moment, Tony does like to jot down design ideas and improvements for the armors. The earlier idea of figuring out how to streamline the design sticks in Tony's mind in particular.
“I get it, the shield’s your gig,” Tony said. He slid his arm out of the straps and offered it back to Steve. “Stars and stripes aren’t my color, anyway.”
The address leads Steve back to a pleasant, quiet area of Hightown, where businesses bleed off gradually into a residential neighborhood. The houses are more like villas there, perched with a lovely view of the beach in back and beautifully landscaped gardens in front.
"Not in so many words," said Tony. "He knew I didn't trust him ... spook got spooked from the beginning."
Tony doesn't know what to say, can't think of any eloquent way of handling it, so he just offers softly, again, "I'm sorry, Steve."
"Well," Natasha said mildly, when Steve caught up to her again. "It seems like for a bunch of teachers, they know how to throw a party." She looked amused, but on second glance Steve noticed she was wearing her coat.
"I'm not buying what you're selling," Jim says. "But I'm not gonna hold you up here when Steve needs you. When you decide you wanna tell me what's going on, you know where to find me."
The door slams open and a tall, broad man in a black and green uniform steps inside. Obviously unprepared for anyone to be present, he only begins to turn at the first sign of Steve's movement, and by then it's too late - Steve hits the Hydra agent soundly with the butt of the gun and watches him go down like a heap of bricks.
Steve took one of Tony’s hands and folded it gently between both of his own, pretending he did not feel a tremor running through the other man’s fingers. “That’s not so hard to believe,” he said gently.
Tony offered to install a washer and dryer in Steve’s newly occupied apartment in Avengers Tower - even though he’d overlooked that supposed creature comfort in the expectation that everyone
The great thing about being a super soldier was that when Steve got injured, the problem tended to resolve itself rather quickly. The terrible part was that when there was a projectile involved in that injury, leaving behind debris that had to be removed, no one was sure how to numb the pain. Steve's system metabolized most normal doses of drugs with frightening speed, and no doctor yet had been comfortable enough to dose him with something close to the capacity of a horse tranquilizer just to see if it might work.
Steve wanted to move close, to hold Tony, to do something to comfort him and make them both feel better after a very long day, but he held himself in place and asked, “What do you mean?”
Clint sipped his coffee in silence for a moment, before turning back to the stove. "So, don't worry. Coulson's been out here for months and hasn't made as much progress as you have in a few days. I've known him and worked with him for a long time. If he didn't think you could do it, he wouldn't have recommended you."
Their finished product was, well, not the most attractive tree Steve had ever seen - it certainly paled in comparison to the enormous one that had dominated Tony's living room - but it was
"You left without giving me a chance to talk to you." Steve sets his bag down by the door and shrugs out of his coat, announcing his intention to stay until he gets the answers he wants and needs. "What else was I supposed to do?"
Tony was, at the moment, juggling a stack of cupcake boxes tied together in a leaning tower with brightly colored string. Steve moved forward to help right them before the topmost slid any further and unbalanced the whole mess.
The force of it flings Tony back into the wall, and he barely makes out the concerned yells of Steve and the others before everything goes dark.
"So," Tony says. "Mind if I just call you 'Stark'? Kind of weird to think of you as Tony since, well, that's me."
Tony loved everything they did together, but there was something especially striking about the way Steve sucked cock. He always looked so debauched, with his hair a mess (usually from Tony's fingers in it) and his mouth red where it was stretched around Tony's dick.
"Want to finish me off without a fight, then?" Tony wonders. "I don't know why I would have expected any more out of you."
“Looks like they’re on to us, boys!” Jarvis shouted. “Watch yourselves on the descent, and God speed.”
"And I take my work very seriously." Steve's hand drifts a little further south than is strictly necessary for this pretense of helping steady Tony on the ladder. The ladder where Tony happens to be standing all of a foot and a half off the floor.
"There's a pot on in the kitchen," she answered, nodding her head in that direction. "Half-and-half in the fridge, sugar in the cabinet. There are also some donuts on the counter."
also means talking about Tony, and talking about Tony always leads into a conversation Steve knows by rote and dreads well in advance.
"No shit," Tony said flatly. "What kind of genius would I be if I didn't recognize a SHIELD agent when I see one?"
"YOU EXCEEDED THE SPENDING LIMIT," the Krampus answered, in its booming, determined -- and up close, obviously computerized -- voice.
Coulson waited a while, taking care of busy work in his office until the first period bell had rung, then he roamed down through the halls and stopped outside Mr. Carbonell's classroom door. The window set into one side of the wood afforded him a subtle view of the proceedings inside, without anyone noticing he was watching.
Another Hydra base, one of the last, has been taken down. Baron Wilhelm von Strucker, one of the most prominent figures in the organization, is now in Allied custody, on his way to prison to await trial for war crimes.
Steve turns, looking over his shoulder at Tony, eyebrows raised significantly. Tony just gives the tiniest of nods, meeting Steve's eyes with determination. With that, an unspoken agreement passes between them, and Steve turns back to the door.
"Believe me," Steve said, feeling some of the color receding from his face again, "I wouldn't mind trading places."
Steve considers Namor's body language: sitting back in the chair with arms folded across his chest, affected disinterest, and decides that the gamble of the truth is worth it. "Hydra," he says.
Tony laughed, and pushed himself up from the shower door. He grabbed the handle and slid the glass open, then stumbled inside, dragging Steve along with him. Tony began to lose his balance from the momentum, so Steve took the opportunity to push him up against the tiled wall (strictly to steady him, of course).
Steve watches the smoke begin to rise in the glow of the match before Namor snuffs out the flame. He gives the captain a few moments to enjoy his tobacco in silence before asking, "What can you tell me? About Tony."
Steve took that as a good sign, and closed the rest of the distance between them, to wrap his arms around Tony’s waist. Tony relaxed as he leaned into the embrace and Steve relaxed with him, relieved that some of the tension between them had finally ebbed.
Steve laughed, the sound low and warm. "Pretty sure that wasn't one of the side effects of the serum," he said, sliding his hands down Tony's back again.
“Earlier, today - yesterday, now - I thought I might never see you again, either. And I was thinking about what you said, about the danger in the things we do, and ...” Tony paused, tongue darting out to lick his lips; he was nervous. “I wouldn’t want to die without telling you that ... you’re the best thing to ever happen to me.”
"I've got Dr. Sternberg's notes," Banner says. "As far as I can tell, he'd managed to work out the formula, but -"
eight, and ... it was a lot. “I’m sorry about what I said earlier,” he said. “About my dad wanting me to be like you. I, uh ... it was weird, you know? Adult brain, childish feelings.”
After a moment of indecision, Tony sat down on the other end of the couch and began to eat his donut in silence, while the television documentary droned on about the sorts of creatures that lived in the darkest depths of the ocean. It was a little more entertaining than the videos often foisted onto science class by the educational system, but only just.
After dinner, they sat around and drank more, and exchanged some stories of past Christmases. Steve told them of holidays during the Depression, and how Bucky had once saved up money from odd jobs to get Steve - who'd been sick in bed nearly the entirety of winter - some art supplies. Clint had a story about a holiday spent on an op in the middle of nowhere, and how tonight's dinner definitely beat canned beans. Natasha told them about the SHIELD Christmas party Clint missed that year while on his op, where Fury and Hill had gotten rip-roaringly drunk and sung a duet of "Baby, It's Cold Outside" (and refused to acknowledge it the next day, to the point of banning everyone else from mentioning it).
"Sap," Tony says, but his tone is fond. He tugs his hand back and pushes himself up on an elbow. "But really, what time
"You have me," Tony says firmly. "Me, and the rest of my little group. We're your family now, too. We might be a ragtag group of treasure hunters, but we're yours."
Tony made a grouchy noise, but it was pretty half-hearted. "Fine," he conceded. "What about a gentle, non-bruise-aggravating cuddle?"
"... and handsome," Tony finishes, smiling cheekily. "What? It's not my fault they gave you your own theme song."
A few different things become clear to Tony over the next few hours that he spends with his alternate. Anthony shares some of the same major life events with Tony, like the circumstances that led to the creation of the Iron Man, the founding of the Avengers, the struggle with alcoholism, the constant fighting to keep control of his own company.
That left Iron Man and Captain America alone to man the fort; the fort being, of course, the lavish Avengers Mansion, where under the care of Edwin Jarvis they would want for nothing. The place was decked out in all its festive glory, with a massive Christmas tree and garland strung all about and mistletoe hung in tasteful places. Platters of sugar and shortbread cookies sat all about, along with enough gingerbread houses and people to constitute a cookie village.
“My armor isn’t yellow,” Tony says, unable to quite look past his offense to offer any valuable critique.
Iron Man looked up, surprised, like she had forgotten Steve was there. Or, more likely, maybe she wasn’t expecting him to make conversation. Iron Man shivered, obviously cold in her inadequate clothing, and Steve moved even closer under the pretense of getting a better look at the crate, to help shield her from the cold. He would have done it for anyone, really, but he got an idea that Iron Man would not enjoy the thought of being treated any differently now that her secret was known.
“Well,” Tony said. “Lucky for me you’re not in the Squadron, or else you’d have to throw me in jail right now.”
"You bet you would," Tony answered, grinning back. He swung himself out of the bed, and padded toward the en suite. "I need a shower. You gonna join me?"
"You've got a sprained ankle and a couple of bruised ribs," Jarvis announces as soon as Tony makes a sign of movement. "And you almost ran down your bloody repulsor pump.
"Not yet. You wanna tell me what the hell happened down there, boss? Von Strucker didn't even put up a fight with us - just laughed his head off like a madman."
had problems, even before the serum - when he got dressed, and chugged down the rest of the hot cocoa. He deposited the empty mug in the kitchen sink, poured himself a big bowl of cereal, and headed out into the living room. It was a comfortable space, with a big squashy couch, and the streaming television subscription seemed just the thing to use to wind down at the moment.
Steve leans in and Tony does his best to stoop down in the unwieldy armor - usually, he finds his designs sleek and graceful, but today could see a compelling reason to streamline - but the War Machine (Jim had not gone subtle with his moniker, even rejecting Tony's cheeky suggestion of rebranding as 'Iron Patriot') is on the approach, carrying Steve's partner on his boot.
Steve swept Tony into his arms once they were both undressed, prompting a soft yelp and a laugh from Tony as Steve carried him toward the bed.
Tony waffled for a moment between disdain for the idea of Steve's pity, and desperately wanting the comfort being freely offered. He finally went for the comfort (he was a hedonist, after all) and admitted, "I think my bruises have bruises."
Stark is more at ease now, but he still reaches up and begins to paw at the oxygen mask. Tony checks a few readings, then moves to help him with it. Seeing Tony just confuses Stark again, though, and the man spends a long moment glancing between Tony and Steve.
"If we're going to do this, we're going to do it right." Natasha squared her shoulders and turned to look at Clint. "Come on, we're going shopping."
Tony tilted his head back and Steve leaned forward, and they were kissing right in the middle of … well, an empty laundromat, so Tony wasn’t inclined to care. He did give a little yelp when Steve lifted him up and set him on top of the washing machine, and wasn’t
intimate for Tony, seeing the expression on Anthony's face and knowing he often wears something that raw and open on his own.
"I did a little poking around Madripoor after you left," Tony admits. "Found a warehouse, where Vennema had all kinds of tech stored. Ingoing and outgoing. She had a lot in there: A.I.M. gear, Hydra stuff, even a few pieces built on old Stark International patents. You should be relieved we took her down before she got a chance to move it all."
"Take your blackmail photos now," Tony said. "They'll be useful during the rest of the school year. Too bad Principal Coulson didn't make it. I had a pair of reindeer antlers I was saving just for him."
"I don't know." Peggy gets down a teapot and cups from the cabinet. "It's ... suspicious. I can't say Tony Stark isn't a person of interest to us right now."
Tony brings up both gauntlets on the suit when the miniaturized rocket launches at him, but it sails overhead and crashes into the stonework instead. Dust and pebbles shower down, before the entire covered walkway bucks ominously under the force of the explosion, rock collapsing atop him at a steady rate.
Peggy walks over to the table and rests her hand on Steve's shoulder. "We haven't ruled out the possibility that he may be working
Steve laughed softly, a little unused to having this conversation with people who, well, didn't already
Steve nods without finding words, mouth slightly agape and eyes wide as he looks up at them. Tony has a large enough ego to know that he and Anthony have to present
“Well, ahh, if you’re alright, then ...” the Captain began, as he led the way from the office, back to the hallway, his hand settling on the small of Tony’s back.
"But you're more likely to find him in Lowtown, at the Princess Bar." Namor pauses, snorting at Steve's questioning look. "If Stark has spent a day sober since setting foot in Madripoor, I'd be surprised. You should be prepared to drag him out of some gutter, Rogers."
Of all the things Steve had been through in his life, from sleeping for the better part of the century in ice to being mind-swapped into the body of the man he loved, snapping back to reality from an existence where he was supposed to be a supervillain had to take the cake. He did not linger in Tony’s lab once the reality stone was put away, just headed back to his room, setting his mind to the comfort of routine.
His hand came down on the glass but, rather than trying to break it, he just left behind a blinking device.
"Okay," Tony says, and it's ... well, almost suspicious, how easily he lets the subject drop. "Let's get some rest?"
General Nicholas Fury, head of the Army's Strategic Scientific Reserve, assured the press in an official statement today that "Cap will be at the ready to return for any threat looming on the horizon. In the meantime, we people of the United States owe him our gratitude for his service, and the dignity of a quiet retirement."
"Good," said Natasha. "It's still a little wooden, but you've got that awkward charm so I think you can sell it without raising any suspicions."
At the stop sign at the end of the street, Steve squinted in the wing mirror and found his pen from earlier, quickly scribbling the other car's license plate number on the palm of his hand. It was probably nothing - Natasha would laugh at him for being paranoid, later, Steve was sure - but Steve knew he'd have more peace of mind if he just ... checked. A strange car sitting in a residential neighborhood at almost four in the morning wasn't
Tony's posture sagged in relief, and he reached out to return the favor, eager hands pushing down Steve's briefs. Unfortunately, a genius I.Q. didn't really guarantee that Tony had a lengthy attention span to go along with it, and Tony didn't get much further than pushing the underpants down around Steve's thighs before he got distracted in wrapping his hand around Steve's cock.
Anthony makes a face, thinking. "Not a lot, to be honest. My last clear memory is the Avengers being called out."
Tony sits up, grabbing his cigarette case and lighter from the nightstand. "I would have imagined you and Agent Carter might finally act on that latent attraction."
As they pulled out of the driveway, Steve was jostled from his thoughts, and he turned his attention to the street. As he had grown accustomed to, it was quiet and mostly empty. But there, on the opposite side of Tony's house from last time, was that same dark sedan. This time the engine didn't seem to be running, and Steve couldn't see anyone inside, but he knew it was the same car.
Tony eases himself closer to the edge of the bed, and he reaches out, stroking his hands down Anthony's sides, rumpling his borrowed clothes. Steve takes a step forward and Anthony a step back, and finally they're close enough for Tony to press himself against Anthony's back. He tips his head down and kisses Anthony's neck, his hands roaming further down to hook in the waistband of his pajama bottoms. They're easy enough to slide down, and Tony is pleased to find that, much like himself, his alternate doesn't wear anything
Peggy raises her eyebrows. "We have tracked some disappearances in the last six months. One of the scientists who worked with Dr. Erskine in Germany has gone missing, and a Dr. Sternberg from France. There may be others, but they were both working on projects SHIELD has been keeping an eye on."
Tony shrugged. "He's in the Air Force. Sometimes that trumps hanging out with your friends at Christmas, believe it or not."
Steve shrugged. "I don't know. I'm ... I don't mean to sound arrogant when I say that I'm not lacking in offers, I just haven't had a lot of interest in anyone."
Steve makes use of the shower - which spits out alternatingly freezing cold and lukewarm water - eager to at least wash off the dirt of travel and evidence of the night before. He considers his reflection and decides not to shave, in a half-hearted attempt at a disguise. After getting dressed, Steve shoves his things back into his duffel bag and leaves the apartment.
Fury gave Tony the standard rundown, a lecture about Stane that involved mostly things of which Tony was already aware, and he concluded by noting arrangements would be made for their transport as soon as the weather broke. SHIELD would secure accommodations for Tony in the city, and alert those of their operatives who had been working inside Stark Industries as an insurance policy.
Steve’s face was intent with concentration, almost innocent as they jacked each other, hips rocking together to help them better chase their mutual pleasure. He wasn’t noisy about it, either; when he came just a few minutes later, the only noise he made was a soft moan that was mostly muffled by the way he pressed his face into Tony’s shoulder.
Natasha turned to look at him again, and while her body language was open, there was something guarded in her expression. "It's fine," she said. "But I promise you it isn't nearly as interesting as getting to know Steve as a person."
, a word she often repeats to him in a mock stern tone. "Fine, but I still need to get some ideas from you for the next few issues of
Tony spends a long moment examining himself in the mirror while he's shaving, trying to perceive if there are any visible changes. He can't remember the last time he laughed, and when he tries for a smile, it looks more like a grimace on his face.
Tony was the one who ran from the responsibility of the Avengers last time, ultimately dissolving the team. When the Avengers went away, so had the casual, friends with benefits, relationship Tony and Steve had indulged in while sharing close quarters in the mansion. Apparently Tony's promise to lead the team again was enough for Steve, though; he had moved right in to the tower with enthusiasm, and picked up a routine in the last few days that was remarkably similar to how life had been in the mansion.
After Coulson had been seen out and the dishes washed, Tony followed Steve to bed, hoping he hadn't misinterpreted the situation in assuming he was welcome to do so. Steve had been stiff and strange since earlier, his disapproval - or at least apprehension - for their plan clear in the lines of his face. He really was, well and truly, bad at keeping his feelings hidden.
Steve didn’t seem to be doing much better, at least, and he had to be suffocating inside that suit, so really, there was hardly any need to drag this out, was there? Tony reached his free hand around and grabbed a handful of Steve’s ass - and that was nice, too - to haul him in closer.
Steve slips the bartender a small roll of bills - an hour off the boat and Steve has already spent more than a working class man makes here in a month - and gets pointed toward the back for his trouble, with an assurance that he will be left alone for the duration of his 'meeting.'
Steve rapped lightly on the doorframe before he walked inside, but he stood silently for a moment just across the threshold, hands in his pockets.
Steve laughed softly at Tony’s dubious look. “I looked into the Hulk, as well. For someone of his size and power, he seems to be oddly careful about not hurting anyone.”
Tony stirred after a moment spent catching his breath, and he nudged Steve in the back with his heel. "Keep going," he urged.
Tony watches Steve go - always a view not to be missed - then turns his attention back to the tank. Within half an hour, he has the other Tony in the process of coming out of stasis, settled onto a lab table, mostly cleaned of the weird gel and wired up to machines to monitor his vital signs, a mask over his face to provide oxygen since he seems to be breathing well enough on his own.
just made Steve shift in discomfort as his uniform trousers tightened even further against the strain of his growing erection. Then Tony was standing in front of him again, expertly stripping the gauntlet from Steve's arm.
"Nine." Natasha split away so that they could sidestep a pair of slow-moving tourists. When she moved close again, she added, "Coulson's back in town."
"Mm." Tony sags in Steve's arms, looking as if he wants nothing more than just to go to sleep. "Can we talk about this later?"
Another day, another encounter with Justin Hammer, and Tony hated to say it, but Hammer was starting to step up his game in his efforts to join the Cabal. That childish desire was making Hammer dangerous, rather than just laughable; eventually, the Avengers would need to do something to make sure he was shut down for good, but it was a difficult matter, when the rest of the villains from whom the Cabal was comprised were such a distraction.
Tony sighed to himself. He had been hoping to avoid a lecture from Steve, especially on the heels of the bet he practically lost, but really, Tony knew it was unfair to blame Steve for that.
Tony shudders lightly when Steve's hands stroke lower, when one circles fingers around his cock and the other moves to cup his balls.
"See my point?" Steve wondered, laughing. He released Tony's hands and slipped his hands down to Tony's hips. "Even if I
Tony was apprehensive - he didn’t like for anyone to touch the device that sat in his chest keeping him
Steve signed and folded the note when he was done, and offered it to Dum-E. "Can you make sure he gets this?"
To Steve's surprise, Tony kisses back, and there's a certain eagerness in the way that he slides his arms around Steve's waist, under the coat. Tony tastes like bourbon and cigarettes and smells like the same, along with a faint hint of his preferred aftershave, something uniquely Tony.
"C'mon," Tony said. "You've got super strength and enhanced stamina and superior balance, and - wait. Why
Steve woke up from his nap feeling disoriented and a little sluggish. The television had droned on with several more episodes of the show he was watching while he slept, and Steve fumbled for a confused moment before managing to switch off the entertainment system. He rubbed his hands over his face after he sat up, and checked his phone; he had a text from Natasha, reminding him that she would meet him at the party. No getting out of it, then, he decided.
Inside the castle gates, the group splits up, with Jim, Dernier, and Dugan leading a group to find the rocket that von Strucker is rumored to have in one of the towers, and Tony going off with Falworth and the remaining soldiers in search of the baron himself.
It was sweet. It was dangerous. There would be questions. Steve was offering him an out, and Tony knew, he
Steve wasn't exactly happy about the idea of being a librarian - couldn't there have been an opening for an art teacher? - any more than he was about the idea of going in deep cover, but he listened to the details, nodding in all the appropriate places, and fled as soon as the meeting was dismissed.
Steve did well not to let his surprise show on his face (at least, he hoped it didn't show). "My undercover assignment is officially over," he said. "Technically, I'm on medical leave."
“As far as I know,” Tony said, “Black Widow steals from rich people, fences the goods, and donates the dirty money to charity. Hawkeye steals for himself, Falcon hacks into government systems and exposes corruption, and Thor, uh ... avenges crimes against the environment?”
give into the urge to put his head in his hands. "Tony is dying," he says, as evenly as he can manage.
With the two looking suitably distracted with soaking up the chanting cheer of "Hail Hydra!" that goes up around them, Steve glances sidelong at Agent Drew. She looks troubled, but nods subtly, and Steve gathers up his strength before launching to his feet and straight at Madame Hydra.
Tony sat up straight and, before he quite realized what was happening, found himself tugged onto Steve’s lap. Steve cupped his hand at the back of Tony’s neck and pulled him in close for a kiss, and ... well, that was definitely a surefire way for Steve to take Tony’s mind off things. He had difficulty thinking about very much at any length when he had Steve’s tongue in his mouth, and really, even while Tony had come down here more for simple company than anything else, he could not deny that he found physical intimacy with Steve a great means of winding down after a stressful day.
"You look good," Natasha said. She patted his arm reassuringly. "Don't be nervous. Eccentric billionaires can smell fear."
Jim doesn't look ready to give up that easily, though. "You were having a fit when I blasted in there. What did he do to you, Tony?"
"Then we'll get a place together," Tony says. "Or I'll build you a house. I'll build you ten houses. You said yourself - no one cares what we do here."
“I had a lot of respect and admiration for your father, Tony,” he said after a moment. “Howard Stark was a brilliant man. I owe a lot to him, from the creation of my shield, to being the only pilot crazy enough to take me behind enemy lines to rescue my best friend.”
Steve pulled a face, unsure whether he should take that strictly as a compliment, but he decided to see it as a positive thing; it wasn't as if he
With the matter of her identity relatively unaddressed, Iron Man sat forward, gently tugging Steve’s hand down from his head to have a look of her own at his scalp.
"Thanks." Steve padded off toward the kitchen, the tinny sound of the game on his phone starting up again once he was out of sight. When he came back a few moments later - coffee and phone clutched awkwardly together in one hand, donut in the other - he commented, "The weather looks pretty bad. I don't think we're going anywhere fast."
"Hi," Tony answers, returning the smile with one of his own. He steps aside and gestures Steve to enter. "Come in."
Steve decides, whatever his unpleasant feelings at the moment, he likes Dr. Banner. The man seems to have a good sense of humor, at any rate.
"I've been working on it," Tony answers. "I've got Reed on board, he can help them make the jump, but we need to know
Steve is dressed down, in just his olive drab Army uniform trousers and a white cotton undershirt bearing the logo of the Strategic Scientific Reserve, when Tony answers the door. He gives a shy smile, eyes darting around to see whether they are alone before he says, "Hi."
"We have intelligence that suggests a leftover faction of Hydra agents is gaining a foothold in Madripoor," Steve says. "Maybe planning to use it as a base of operations in the area. I'm going in to investigate, and to take them down."
"We didn't want to get started without you," Tony says, pitching his voice low as he slips his hand down to tease slicked fingers along Steve's cleft.
They make Tony get out of the armor, of course, and there isn't much argument he can make at gunpoint. The soldiers load up the armor, divvying up pieces of Tony's beloved, if broken, Iron Man to carry as they march him inside. Tony's ankle protests the walk, and he's freezing outside of the armor, but he refuses to allow his discomfort to show.
Only a week after Iron Man first hits the news reels, seen providing aerial support to the Howling Commandos, Tony gets a telegram from J. Jonah Jameson, announcing his desire to ‘GET CAPTAIN AMERICA FOR MARVELS. STOP.’
"You are such a spoilsport," Tony said, rolling his eyes. "We even had these dry cleaned before we put them on."
startle Steve right into wondering when he’d earned a reputation as such a hardass among his teammates), so Steve placed a hand on his shoulder in reassurance and offered a grateful smile. “Thank you, Clint.”
“A lot of people don’t,” Steve said. “It had to be harder on your father than it was on the rest of the Howling Commandos, since he was a civilian.”
Now Steve did gasp in surprise, before he could quite help himself. Howard Stark had been one of Steve's closest friends during the war, one of the men responsible for the project that successfully created Captain America. By the time Steve got through the files of so many others - Bucky, Peggy, the Howling Commandos - to learn about Howard, he had been too grief stricken and overwhelmed to inquire after any surviving kin.
But Natasha had been cool toward him once they got back on board the dirigible, retreating immediately to her cabin with the excuse of needing to recharge her batteries. She took the crate with her, and had not emerged since. Apprehension had rolled off her in waves; Steve knew, deep down, Natasha was probably worried that he would treat her differently now that he knew her secret.
Steve’s heart dropped into his stomach as he watched the flash of the explosion in the dark clouds overhead. He wanted to shout, or scream, but there was only one course of action ahead that might fix this, that might bring Tony back, and Steve had to see it through. Even if Tony didn’t come back on the other side, Steve knew that the sacrifice had not been given lightly.
"I should be thanking you for giving me the exclusive," Pepper says with a laugh. "I'm the first woman to get a front page feature in the
Steve used one of his hands to grip Tony's hip, and slid the other down between his own legs, and it was all Tony could do not to let his knees give out as he watched Steve reach inside his sweatpants and stroke himself. That urge only grew worse as Steve tugged at Tony's hip, urging him forward.
Besides, Steve knew Clint meant well enough, and in many ways Clint could sympathize with Tony as Steve could not. They were both men with questionable pasts, physically normal human beings on a team full of superpowered humans and a god, making an example for a younger generation of heroes like Sam Wilson to follow. It was no wonder to Steve that Clint had actually tried to get through to Tony back on the planet, to speak to the man inside the power cosmic.
Steve raises his eyebrows, clear disapproval in his expression. They both know the war would hardly end just because Hitler said so; the machinations of Hydra behind the scenes would simply take the center stage.
Natasha nodded, satisfied. "Just remember that the best lies have a grain of truth in them. If you can answer a question honestly, do it. Don't get too elaborate, make sure you tell the same stories to everyone so you don't slip up. So, Steve," she went on, dropping into a conversational tone, "tell me about yourself."
"Bye," Steve said. He stood and watched the man's retreating back before heading off to his own SHIELD issue car.
“What’s this?” Tony steps closer, to see that the top of the box is stamped with the symbol of Hydra. Warnings stenciled onto the sides of the box warn in German against tampering, and suggest caution.
The first time Tony Stark goes out on maneuvers with Steve Rogers, he knows that it is truly a match made in heaven. He isn't given to much romantic fancy these days, not with a war on - though he certainly has been guilty of
Steve sits down at the tiny kitchen table, and watches while Peggy fills a kettle with water and puts it on to heat. "He knows about the Hydra presence in Madripoor ... he said they're collecting scientists."
"Quickly, quickly," he urges, closing the door as soon as Steve is over the threshold. Sternberg clicks two deadbolts and a chain into place before shuffling past, the gun still clenched loosely in one hand. "What can I do for you, Captain?"
“It’s alright,” Tony said, stepping aside to let Steve have a look at the screens. “The hardest part isn’t just getting them to trust what I’ve got to say, it’s getting them all together in the first place. I think Falcon will be the best starting point, he’s a dropout from SHIELD Academy, a promising cadet name of Sam Wilson, but SHIELD hasn’t put two and two together yet, so he still maintains his civilian identity.”
“Not exactly,” Tony said. “There’s an electromagnet under there. When my convoy got attacked, one of my own bombs went off right across from me. Blew shrapnel into my chest, right through my bulletproof vest. It couldn’t be removed, so ... magnet. Keeps it from migrating into my heart.”
Steve let himself in, and nearly backed out again when he saw Natasha was abed. She had cleaned up as well, but lounged on her bunk in a set of what looked like silk pajamas and a robe. Strangest of all, though, the thing that made Steve reconsider, was that she had two cords running out of her pajama shirt, to what looked like a small generator.
Hawkeye may have been combative and stubborn, but he caught on quick. “Wait, you think we’re the good guys? And we’re called ‘The Avengers’?”
That, Steve thought, felt even worse, taking the time to build an acquaintanceship, even a friendship, with someone, while knowing you were doing so under false pretenses. Thinking he would never see the other person again did not ease his conscience in the doing.
As part of his ongoing effort to be his own alibi, Tony was doing a little casual terrorizing of the research and development department in a Stark Industries satellite office, when something metal ricocheted off the laboratory walls and clanged directly into his helmet.
Steve intended the searching greeting for Tony, but the mechanical arm reacted instead, its claw opening and closing in a clacking noise. On closer inspection, it seemed to be wearing a pair of felt reindeer antlers, which added a strangely anthropomorphic touch.
By the time Steve's phone finally beeped with the critically low battery warning, it was almost lunch time and he'd blown through a few episodes of the show he was (not really) watching. He debated for a moment between getting his charger to keep playing, and putting the game away - he was up to level 19! - before reluctantly saving and exiting the program.
Natasha rolled her eyes at him; Steve wondered if she and May had the same teacher. Maybe it was just a thing SHIELD agents learned.
” J. Jonah Jameson reported from the television screen, his deep voice booming across the workshop. “
Steve Rogers is amazing. Seeing him in action as Captain America is a wonder, and the man beneath the flag is every bit as good and noble as the cause he supports. But Steve is also funny, sarcastic, stubborn, and not afraid to stand up to Tony, which is not something Tony has experienced very much in his life. In fact, Tony has something of a tendency to surround himself with those few people who won't deal with his bullshit; Jim, Pepper, Jarvis, and now Steve, they're all willing to take Tony down a notch or two when required.
Items of an unusual nature were exactly the sort of thing Tony Edwards specialized in, which was presumably just why General Fury had tapped the man inside the Iron Man for this particular mission. Captain America was along as backup for Iron Man, while the rest of the Invaders were deployed with Fury’s Howling Commandos unit for a separate assignment.
Steve thinks he must linger a little too long; he glances back at Tony and catches the other man watching him, as if Steve has done something worthy of scrutiny.
"No, it's ... done, now," Tony says. "Don't worry. I'm undoubtedly safer with you around than without you. What Hydra member would mess with Captain America?"
Behind him, Tony pressed soft kisses along Steve’s neck, his shoulder, his jaw, as Tony kept up his lazy rhythm. His only outward sign of impatience, of desperation, was the way that his hand shifted to Steve’s hip and tightened, in that moment spent teetering on the brink, right before Tony came, chanting Steve’s name in a murmur.
Tony carefully looked away, wincing. “There’s an entire team of superheroes who have been trying to bring him in for years,” he pointed out.
Steve reached up, cupping Tony's cheek in his hand. "Like I said, I know a little something about what it's like to leave the life you've known and try to fit in a new one. And ... I'm sorry."
After a little while, the door quietly creaked open behind Tony and Jarvis walked in. He always seemed to know just when Tony had had enough of his own company, when to show up and say or do exactly the right thing.
Tony concedes the point to her, but lack of conversation means entertaining the thoughts inside his head, most of which center not on the mission where they belong, but on Steve's assignment.
"I wouldn't put it outside the realm of possibility," said Natasha. "Agent May is looking into it. Until then, we're to keep doing our jobs, but whatever you have going on with Stark, you might want to push it. See if you can accelerate the timeline."
"I really hope you don't mind me sticking close," Steve said, once they were inside. "I'm a little worried if I lose you, I won't find you again before midnight."
Resting in a padded lining within the box is a small metal sphere. A seam runs along its circumference, a clear line of separation between what Tony presumes is top and bottom. There are markings near the seam, along with notches, but he can’t decipher them as any letters or numbers in any alphabet with which he’s familiar.
Steve smiled gently, relaxing into the touch. “One thing the Squadron couldn’t ever get right was keeping us from finding each other.”
Just a few hours ago, the city had been in peril — again. Just a few hours ago, Steve thought he might have lost Tony. He had had the thoughts and memories at the time of a reality that turned out not to exist, and yet that was still one of the most difficult, impactful things about it. Steve’s integrity was not something that even the Squadron Supreme wielding the power of an Infinity Stone could take away. But Tony ...
Natasha looked like she couldn't come up with any compelling reason why not, so she shrugged in return. "Okay, then. You're awfully cheerful today."
Steve thanked the barista and hitched the cardboard sleeve a little bit further up the cup before he turned to the coffee shop's door. There waited his co-worker (and friend) Natasha Romanoff - also known as codename: Black Widow - with her gloved hands wrapped around a large cup of tea. She quirked a smile at Steve and let him hold the door open for her on the way out; a concession, maybe, since she wouldn't allow him to buy her drink.
Steve dropped his head back down onto Tony's thigh and closed his eyes; it was getting hard to concentrate, with the snow leeching the rest of the warmth from his limbs. They had stupidly run outside without any coats on, and it was beginning to feel uncomfortably like being frozen all over again.
Natasha leaned in under the pretense of giving Steve a one-armed hug, but before she pulled away she whispered, a bit wickedly, "There's mistletoe in the kitchen doorway, and another sprig by the stairs."
Maybe, Steve has to admit, Peggy's fears are well-founded. Steve has difficulty remaining objective where Tony is concerned, especially after the way things ended between them ... with Tony simply leaving. In all that time, there had been no letters, no phone calls. Steve hadn't harbored a great deal of illusions about what life after the war would hold for them, he'd found it too hard to think about the future beyond the desire to live to see it, but he never imagined it would end without a word.
Steve couldn't help gawking a little at the workbenches and computers, the bits and pieces of projects. As he stepped further inside, a tall piece of machinery that stood about the height of a man and looked like a swiveling arm on a rolling base, swung around and pointed a claw at him.
"Well, five dollars is a lot to you, I'm sure," Tony teased around a yawn. "You're not accounting for inflation."
When Steve closes his mouth over the head of Tony's cock, tilts his head to take Tony into his mouth, Tony makes a sound that banishes all of Steve's doubts. Tony cards his fingers through Steve's hair, and Steve goes at it with relish, licking and sucking until Tony tugs at his hair in warning to stop.
“Steve.” Tony stepped closer and rested his hands on the front of Steve’s uniform, the thumb and index finger of each of Tony’s hands framing the star on Steve’s chest. “It has recently come to my attention that, of all the times we’ve
Tony closes his eyes, looking weary. "You're wasting your time, Steve," he says softly. "I risked life and limb for America, I gave her my
The castle was little more than a ruin, actually, and Steve figured that explained the logic for keeping something valuable inside: who would believe an important artifact would be specially stashed inside some ruins?
Tony made another helpless gesture; it didn't go a very long way toward clarifying the issue. "I just," he started, making a frustrated noise. "We do this and it's fun, it's really fun, but then you say something like that and I don't know what to think."
"I'd like that," Steve said, smiling as he wrapped his towel around his waist. "I should get back to my room for clothes, though ..."
"And my front, and the rest of me, I hope," Tony joked, as he draped himself over Steve and settled in, stretching out beneath the covers.
Tony glances down, letting his eyes roam from the scuffed red toes of Steve's boots, up to the star on his chest. "I'm sorry I'll have to miss that."
The elevator doors opened - Steve silently cursed the elevator for being so efficient - and Tony broke free of Steve's grasp to rush out. Tony hurried through the common area (Hulk and Thor were too distracted debating over what must have been fifty take-out menus spread on the counter in front of them to notice) and Steve jogged after Tony, confused and more than slightly hurt by the aversion.
Steve looked at Tony for a long moment, then shook his head. “No, it’s okay. You’re here now. Did you really get cold without me?”
That night, Tony has a lot of questions and things that he wants to discuss privately with Steve, none of which seem as important once their clothes begin to come off. Steve presses Tony down to the bed and kisses him, hands roaming over Tony's body in gentle but confident touches. Steve's lips are soft as he kisses around the edge of the chest RT, his face bathed in the pale light of its glow.
. Don't you think I've been asking myself the same things? But we had to know this was a possibility. It was a massive organization, and there's no telling how many minor players were waiting to seize power."
Steve shrugs. "This place is centrally located, and it's a hotbed of terrorist activity. I'm surprised you managed to keep yourself out of trouble as long as you did."
nervous, but he did feel strangely light, a mixture of what was probably anticipation and the thrill of the events of the night prior catching up to him. Delayed adrenaline rush, if there was such a thing; Steve wasn't intent on dwelling, either. He kissed Tony again, and was heartened to feel Tony beginning to touch him again. Tony ran his hands over Steve's chest, down his abdomen, and stopped at the waistband of his jeans only briefly before Tony thumbed open the fly and pulled down the zipper.
"And you've - seen him since then?" Steve asks. He hates the thread of desperation in his voice, but after nothing, to suddenly hear word ...
Iron Man flew in closer, and Cap swung himself gracefully from Iron Man's boot, in through the open window. He rolled and landed in a crouch, shield up and at the ready by the time he was upright again.
“It did, and we’re living in it,” Tony said. “This crack is the truth.” He gave a pause to build anticipation, before putting out the bait, the suggestion that was gentle enough for the rest of them to begin to grasp: “What if we were once a team of villains so strong, the Squadron tried to wipe us from reality?”
"I must look out for Mr. Stark's interests as well, Commander," Dr. Sternberg says. "I cannot tell you anything about my project."
"Yes," she answers. "I've been here watching Tony Stark, trying to get close to him. On orders from both SHIELD
"It's alright, Steve," Peggy says. She steps aside to allow him to enter. "Is something the matter?"
"Hmm." Steve still looks skeptical, but that doesn't stop him from kissing Tony again. "Okay, be careful. Try not to wake him up until I get back?"
There was something so damned earnest about him that Tony could not even guess it was an alias; somehow, he just believed it, right off.
Steve hooked his fingers in the waist of Tony’s sweatpants, then made a surprised and pleased little noise when he found they were
"You're too ..." Tony flapped his hand, and let his arm flop onto the pillows over his head. "Fastidious."
Natasha nodded. "But Stark named his application JARVIS, so that clearly suggests he knows who he is."
It has been days since they were last able to find time for this kind of intimacy, and Tony very much
"You can do whatever you wish, and I'll support your decision," Jarvis said. He paused, then added, "Unless it's illegal, then I'm afraid I'll have to object."
“I trust I’m in very good hands with you, Steve,” Tony answered. “And you can update my file on that.”
For all the times they had done this sort of thing - often enough to be called several, few enough to fall short of a
Fortunately, Steve didn’t hold it against him. They were grown men who knew they came from different worlds, and Tony had long since come to realize that Steve would always consider what Tony thought of as normal to be excess, and Tony would think of Steve as frugal, practical, overly cautious, if he was being generous.
. He had been looking forward to his date with Peggy Carter, but since waking up in the twenty-first century to find that Peggy was an old woman who had lived her own life while Steve slept under the ice, Steve hadn't felt much motivation to date. Natasha had tried a few times to encourage him, and even Agent Barton had made the occasional remark about some girl - or guy - in one department or another shooting Steve
"Huh?" Steve blinked, looking back at him. "No, I just - realized I forgot to tell Natalie where I was going tonight."
he should take it, but before his brain properly caught up with his body, he was sitting up and peeling off his t-shirt. There was an undershirt beneath, woven with a special, extra-thick fabric of Tony’s own design over the chest. He hesitated long enough to brace himself, but not long enough to question his decision, then peeled that up and off, too.
Of course, among other things about Tony, he was a genius, and he caught on after a few seconds that Steve's mind had wandered ... again.
Tony stepped close, ever so slightly shorter than Steve now that he was out of the armor, and reached up to release the helmet's catches. He tugged it gently off Steve's head, and tucked the helmet in the crook of his elbow.
By the time they reach the Lowtown district Steve seeks, the streets are crowded with everything from food carts to drunken revelers, and the car's progress has slowed to a crawl.
Steve was a little startled by the invitation, but took it as a good sign. Tony seemed friendly, and Steve had just presented himself as a future co-worker.
Steve just sighed quietly and dropped a kiss to Tony's hair. They could worry about having that conversation later, but Steve did still murmur to himself and the four walls, before joining Tony in sleep: "Yes, I do."
Steve smiles, in that soft and reassuring way he has, and places a hand on Anthony's shoulder. "It's just an offer. No pressure, no strings attached, if you're interested."
"Thanks." Steve hesitated, before quickly moving forward to sweep Natasha into a hug. "For everything, really."
At first, Steve had been uncertain that working with Iron Man would be a good idea. Captain America’s identity was secret as well, and while Iron Man and Ms. Potts knew his face beneath the cowl, along with Edwin Jarvis and Jim Rhodes, none of their crew knew his name, merely referring to him as ‘Cap’ when the need for a name arose.
Tony recalls the nearly drained armor once Steve is gone, and ignores the sick twist in his stomach as it sinks back into his bones. Back down to his regular civilian appearance, Tony has an easy enough time blending in with the flow of people out of the building. He has a lead of his own that he wants to follow, and with the failure of all tech in the area thanks to the virus Vennema unleashed, it seems like a good time.
“So,” Tony said, when Steve was finished drying his hands and had turned away from the counter. “The kids are all asleep ...”
Steve excused himself from the conversation and headed back out to the car to grab the tree, which was a packaged, artificial affair. He'd wanted to spring for a real one, but it seemed a bit senseless with Christmas being the next day, and all the live trees left at the place he'd checked out were kind of sad looking, anyway.
"After Fury came calling, what ... five years ago now? Something like that," Tony said. "I went to Obie - to Obadiah. Part of me was still a dumb kid looking for guidance, I guess."
"Morning, Cap," Tony greeted. He got a mug down from the cabinet and tried to play it casual as he went to stand across from Steve, putting the coffee maker between them.
"Forgive me, Doctor, but why call you in for Tony's case?" Steve asks, glancing between Banner and Peggy.
"No problem." Tony gestured around the rest of the room; currently, half a dozen people had converted an empty space into an impromptu dance floor. "It gets a little crazy in here, the later it gets."
Banner reaches out and takes the vial from Steve's hands. "Well," he says with a good natured quirk of his lips. "Let's see what we can do."
, but he's got curiosity of his own that he wants to satisfy. Anthony is a good kisser, but - and there is ego talking here - Tony wouldn't have assumed otherwise. When Anthony moans into the kiss and arches back against Tony, Tony breaks away gradually to glance down at Steve, whose blond head bobs steadily, rhythmically, between Anthony's thighs. Tony guides Anthony's hands to Steve's hair, watches while his alternate's fingers card through the thick, bright strands and set the perfection of Steve's usual hairstyle all awry.
“Romantic,” Steve countered, and he closed the short distance for a kiss. He relinquished his grip on the counter and worked his hand between them instead, thumbing open Tony’s jeans with relative ease.
"Coulson's gonna be sorry he missed this," Clint said. He reached up into the bowl of popcorn, ignoring Natasha's swat at his hand. "Cap, decking the halls? That's like some kind of wet dream for him."
"I don't think so," Steve says, glancing around for anything else he might be able to use to his advantage. His holster is hanging on the bedpost, but there's no way he'll reach it and the ammunition in it without exposing himself long enough for them to get a bead on him.
Tony's hand was warm and slightly rough, not dry but callused, probably from years of his work as an inventor. Steve went a step further and laced their fingers together, even though he felt a small twinge of guilt for the intimacy of the move. It felt
Steve felt his face heating up, but could not decide whether it was from anger or embarrassment. It had become obvious to him some time ago that Clint knew about his relationship with Tony, but Steve wasn’t sure exactly when and how they had crossed the line from silent acknowledgment to Clint doling out advice.
Steve raised his head and smiled. “I should be the one thanking you, Tony. You gave me a home, a place to belong, and a new family. It means the world to me.”
"I'm pretty sure I'm willing to take bullets for more people than I'm willing to sleep with," Steve said, smiling wryly. He pushed up the hem of Tony's shirt, and pulled it off when Tony sat up to allow him to remove it.
"I'm not," Natasha said. "I'm being friendly." She paused, pulling a book from a shelf; she remembered Steve adding it to his list of things he needed to check out in the twenty-first century, so she added it to her shopping basket.
Tony is feeling boneless even with an orgasm he gave himself a hand in achieving, and he slouches against Steve. "Maybe later," he says. "I got carried away. See, Captain? You're rubbing off on me."
Tony pushed away the remnants of his lunch and stood up. Steve didn't even ask for further encouragement before surging forward and grabbing Tony by the lapels of his jacket. He was careful not to ruin the fabric in his grip, and instead spent a moment running his thumb over the stitching, appreciating the way the fine Italian wool hugged Tony's body.
before ever meeting Tony. Unlike Steve, Tony is fairly certain Bucky has become less of a fan since.
Across the way, things were starting to get a little rowdy, as the teachers all started to get a bit
"Tony," Steve says. "You wanted to see me?" He stops short as his gaze slides to the left and comes to rest on the group of pods, which have been arranged in a neat row. "Ah. I think I see why."
Steve laughs softly, leaning over to kiss Tony, but he pauses when he notices a trickle of red in Tony's mustache. "Tony - you're bleeding."
"I thought it for the best," Peggy admits. "We've made contact with him, Steve ... he wasn't interested in talking to us, much less in coming back into the country."
The reaction must show on Steve's face, because Stark's expression falters, and his previously friendly smile takes on a cynical twist.
Steve worried, a little, at the duration of the mission suggested by the number of clothes he was told to pack and the extensive backstory he had to put together. Coulson had spent the better part of the last six months in deep cover there, and while they had been told that he and Natasha were considered a last resort - that perhaps fellow teachers would have an easier time befriending Tony than his boss - there was really no telling how long it might take either of them to succeed in their mission.
The program shut down, the lights of the training room coming back up to normal, and Steve stepped away from the wall, toward the center of the mat to give Tony a hand up. “Good work, soldier.”
Steve's pause was a heavy one, though, and he broke the silence a moment later with, "You saved my life back there, with Hammer."
Tony fumbles kisses at Steve's neck and jaw, and when they come just moments apart, shuddering together, Steve slides his hand down to cover the skin-warmed metal of the bubble over Tony's heart.
, fellas," Tony tries, raising his one good hand in a show of surrender. "Forgive me if I don't salute."
"Then if awkward sexual tension isn't the case," Natasha said, turning to look at him fully, "maybe you should consider being a little nicer to him. Steve isn't a bad guy."
Steve gripped the edge of the counter, watching as Tony stroked him, as Tony’s mouth closed around the head of Steve’s cock. Watching was almost too much, and Steve moaned as Tony took him deeper, too affected to avoid making noise at the sight and feel of it. He would just have to hope that everyone else had gone to bed, or would be too tired to investigate; there were probably worse ways their teammates could find out, but Steve was having a hard time thinking of any. (He was probably deluding himself, imagining that any of them didn’t know, in the first place. He could readily think of at least one who most certainly did.)
Tony walked off, a hurried edge to his stride that suggested he might have been rushing off from the conversation, but Coulson wasn't so sure.
"Fastidious," Steve said, and since Tony was awake after all, he nudged him to sit up so that Steve could peel back the covers.
He glances down at himself; the new uniform is a darker and more stylized interpretation of the getup he'd worn during the war, in a shade of deep blue with brushed silver accents on the armor, and brown boots and fingerless gloves. At least he doesn't look like a walking flag, and there's no winged cowl to go along with it; Steve supposes it's better suited to his new position.
Steve winced as Tony dropped the placard into the wastebasket without ceremony. It landed with a dull thud. "That's it, then?"
“Don’t worry about it, gorgeous,” Tony said, and he meant it. A pair of ruined trousers was a very small price to pay for what he found inside Steve’s. Tony wrapped his hand around the man’s dick, and even half-hard it was impressive, eagerly swelling under Tony’s attentions.
"Anthony?" Tony asks. "I don't think we have anything to worry about from him by way of trouble, if that's what you mean."
Steve finds his mind wandering to thoughts of Tony putting himself at risk, being out in public with whatever business he's on. If Tony isn't back soon, Steve will need to go out looking for him.
"Oh, you know. Life of an Army brat. My dad was in the service and we moved around a lot. Once I was ready to put down roots, I decided to go back. I talked my friend Natalie into joining me, since she was having some trouble finding a job in her field back east, and there was an open position for a guidance counselor at the school, too."
"It has a way of growing on you," Tony agreed. "I'm pretty sure it's never really the place, just the way you feel when you're there, the people you have with you."
Tony watches raptly as Steve picks up a slow rhythm, rocking into Anthony, fucking him slowly. "This feels ... weirdly narcissistic," he admits. "How turned on I am."
"You're right. This time we were actually prepared." Tony folds one arm under his head, and strokes his free hand over Steve's shoulder.
In Steve's peripheral vision, Agent Drew gives the slightest twitch; she's surprised. Good, that means she must be the real deal, or a very talented actress. Steve hopes like hell that it's the former.
"The scans look good," Tony says after a moment. "So, first order of business, if you feel up to it, I'd like to ask you a few questions."
The trinket was gold gilded, with embellishments in enameled white and blue. The lid was painted with a surprisingly complex scene for such a small surface, and while the extravagance of the style was not Steve’s preference, he had to artistically appreciate the skill that must have gone into painting such a thing.
There really wasn't much to see in Steve's bedroom; it looked like the living space of a person who had only just moved in, which it was. Only a few personal belongings, like books and art supplies, littered any of the spaces, along with the few pictures that Steve was honestly now a bit embarrassed to have, given they were obviously fake. Tony did a slow turn around the room, then he reached past Steve to push the door shut.
Steve looked at his reflection in the mirror again, took a deep breath, and let it out in a sigh. "As I'll ever be."
Steve exited the program - which mostly seemed like a more entertaining way to keep organized than the default utilities that came on his phone - after a few minutes, and went back to the online store for Tony's other app. Unlike JARVIS, Tiny Robots was free by default, though it seemed to have the option to purchase an advertising-free 'deluxe' version. It too was highly rated, and had an even higher number of total downloads than JARVIS.
He didn't get any further than that, as Tony closed the space between them, surging forward for a kiss. Steve caught Tony up in his arms and drew him in close, kissing like his life depended on it. His heart was pounding, like it might leap right out of his chest, and yet Steve felt like a huge weight had been lifted, one he didn't even know was there. He knew it couldn't be so easy, that there were still things they had to discuss, to work through, to make this work, but Steve also knew it would be worth it, now that he knew Tony wanted it, too.
Tony shares a look with Steve, but Steve doesn't seem to want to press the issue any more than Tony does, and there's a sort of finality to Anthony's tone that defies argument.
Steve glanced up in silent approval and held Tony's gaze for a moment before he pulled down the waistband of his pants. He settled back on his haunches, letting Tony get a good look as Steve worked to bring himself off.
Steve felt like he had just come in mid-conversation and missed part of what was going on. "You built this when you were a teenager?"
“The Captain? Ha!” Falcon said. “Good luck with that. No one’s ever seen him. I bet he doesn’t even exist.”
It was a terribly cheesy thing to say, but somehow Quill pulled it off. Steve had to admit to himself that, for a guy who went around calling himself something as pretentious as ‘Star Lord,’ Quill was in fact pretty charming. The thought did not set well with Steve.
Steve leaned in and kissed Tony, bearing him back down to the pillows. "Why do you think that?" he said. "For all you know, I could be the one who's nervous, talking to distract myself."
Tony, feeling like everything around him was sliding a little to the left, sagged down until he was sliding to the floor, his legs finally giving up the fight. Steve caught him with a laugh, and proceeded to kiss Tony stupid (even stupider?), letting Tony taste the hints of himself on Steve's tongue.
"I will," Steve promised, but he let Tony's legs down to the bed and got his arms under Tony's back instead. Steve dragged Tony into his lap as he took up an intensely slow, easy pace, sliding in and lingering there, letting Tony's weight take him deep inside.
Steve rolls up the papers and stashes them in his bag for later. A part of him feels guilty, but Tony is the one who left Steve here, unsupervised. Resentment at having been left without a word - again - is enough to allow Steve to tamp down on that guilt and continue going through the apartment. It seems sloppy of Tony, in fact, to lead Steve to a place where Steve might find sensitive information. Tony is too smart for that, so Steve doesn't expect to find much.
"No travel, then?" Coulson was not normally given to asking intrusive questions in casual conversation; in fact, he quite disliked it, but in this case it happened to fall under necessary information for his job. He watched Tony's reaction carefully, but there was nothing suspicious about it.
"So," Tony goes on after a moment. "While Zemo was still in the process of taking over, Howard got paranoid. He knew there was something after him, he just couldn't figure out what it was. Couldn't get his mind clear enough to understand it, to articulate it to anyone else. So he got paranoid, decided the Iron Man - which he meant to be a robot - was the solution."
It wasn't just the war, of course, that fueled them years ago, but the idea that they might be dead tomorrow certainly made a compelling argument for giving in to their desires. Steve wishes the similarity didn't lend a fatalistic overtone to the here and now, because for their years of separation, however much he might have lied to himself, he has never stopped wanting Tony.
The med evac team, true to May's word, arrived within seconds, and one of them urged Tony away so that the professionals could take over Steve's care. They got Steve loaded up onto a stretcher, and pressed an unnecessary (he thought) oxygen mask over his face.
Tony shifts and stretches, and his warm hand begins to creep up Steve's thigh. "Morning," he mumbles into his pillow.
Steve looked down, the blush deepening as he rubbed at the back of his neck. “You were just eight years old a few hours ago,” he pointed out.
Steve shakes his head. He sits up so that he can press a kiss to the side of Tony's neck. "You don't have to say anything."
"He's being interrogated right now," she answered. "But just from running his prints, it looks like he's an employee of Geffen-Meyer, which is a security company ... remember that shell corporation of Stark Industries I was telling you about? He was probably hired by Stane to watch Stark - and eliminate him once they detected SHIELD sniffing around."
Agent Drew murmurs an encouraging word to Steve right before she kicks him to his knees on the hard concrete floor. He grunts when he lands, but otherwise remains silent, staring stubbornly up at the woman who approaches.
For Tony, who spent the last twenty-five years doing what made him happy - doing what avoided the responsibility that had fallen on his shoulders - it was a lot to consider.
Steve started, which ruined his concentration on the game; the app beeped with the sounds of a distressed (losing) tone while he looked up at the person who'd interrupted him.
“I know,” Steve admitted. “I think I should be better at it - with the nature of what we do, I should be better at accepting the reality of ... of what’s possible. But it’s hard to be objective when you ... when you care for someone.”
With the doctor's all clear, Steve was released from the hospital with little further ado. Per Agent Coulson's orders, he was remanded into Natasha's care; after a brief absence, she appeared outside his hospital room door with a change of clothes and a bag of prescription painkillers and antibiotics that they all knew Steve didn't really need. Steve wasn't sure what Agent Coulson had said to the doctors to keep them from questioning his speedy recovery, but if anyone could deal with that kind of paperwork, Steve knew it was Coulson.
it turns out that there are dozens of her scattered across universes), that Tony finds out the truth.
“Of course.” The Captain released Tony’s arm and offered him a small smile, but it was hard to make out much else under the cowl he wore. His skin was fair, bordering on pale; his eyes were light, too. Up close, he smelled like leather and something metallic, with a hint of gasoline fumes.
that it's Tony, but the evidence strongly suggests it. What we do know is that Tony Stark disappeared just a few months after Wilhelm von Strucker was brought in."
the idea was that Steve Rogers had been carrying around lube, with the intention of coming here just to have an afternoon fuck.
“I don’t know,” Tony said. He set the empty plate aside and wiped his mouth with a napkin before tossing that onto the tray as well. “Just kind of waiting for the other shoe to drop, I guess.”
Steve got up and stripped out of his pajama pants and his briefs, and left his clothes draped neatly on the chair by the bed. Tony stretched out on his side and watched, enjoying the view even in his tired state.
The Infinity Formula did far more than banish Zemo from Tony's mind; it healed his entire body, with the exception of the metal and glass that covers Tony's heart, where the flesh and bone have long since been stripped away.
Steve pulled off Tony's softening cock with a smile, and maneuvered his way up the bed to give Tony a kiss. Tony tilted his head up to meet Steve, catching the taste of himself lingering on Steve's tongue. When they broke apart for a breath, Tony laughed in a quiet, sated way.
Tony leans in and kisses Steve again, briefly this time, then offers a kiss to Anthony before shifting away to find the bottle of lube that has been nearly lost in the rumpled covers.
Steve catches it deftly, and smiles at Tony before turning his attention back to Anthony. "Is this okay?" he asks.
Tony was blissfully unaware, though; he just slid his arms around Steve, pressing their bodies close together as they kissed.
It made Tony feel a little better that at least Steve seemed similarly affected, and that it wasn’t long before they were both at their limit. Tony came first - Steve was considerate like that - and Steve thoughtfully drew back to sit at the workbench afterward, tugging Tony down to sit on his lap, all without pulling out. Tony would have been impressed if he wasn’t still riding the high of orgasm, vaguely aware of Steve still fucking into him for a few more moments before Steve joined him in climax, crying out and holding Tony close with a fierceness that belied their actual, surface attachment level.
"Please," Tony says. "Call me Tony. I'm not part of your military machine, even if Fury might wish it so."
"I think that can be arranged." Steve was obviously trying to sound stern, but it was ruined by the fact he was smiling. He stood up, and his feet left Tony's field of vision, but Tony was still a little surprised when the foot of the bed, rather than the other side, dipped under Steve's weight.
Through their multiversal adventures, the other iterations of Steve Rogers and Tony Stark they have seen or heard about have not always been on good terms with each other. Then again, in their
"I've always liked being on the cutting edge of technology," Tony said, laughing. "App development was a good way to make money, when smartphones took off. No one really thinks much of you building a new house and buying a nice car when you're a self-made millionaire."
Barton snorted. "This guy's supposed to be a genius. You think he's gonna lay eyes on Star Spangled Man over there and not put two and two together?"
They're down in the workshop, Tony tinkering on a project and Steve cleaning and repairing his gear, when they receive a message of the cross-universal variety. It turns out to be something as mundane as an email, from one
Tony eases Steve through his climax and down from it, then he grinds into him in a few more long, deep thrusts. Tony only gasps softly with his orgasm, as if allowing it to wash quietly over him, and he shivers lightly against Steve's back for just a few moments after before pulling out and rolling away.
In the app store on his phone, Steve searched for the JARVIS application, purchased, and downloaded it. He didn't think he had much use for something like it, but the app was highly rated and had a high number of downloads; at about two dollars, it was rather affordable, but Steve supposed a few million purchases started to add up. He opened the application briefly after it was installed, and was entertained by the pleasant, English-accented voice that greeted him.
"Yeah," Iron Man said, waving off the concern. "The armor's fine. It's just the operator who's a little banged up."
. In the time I spent speculating on what you've been doing for the last two years, that wasn't part of it."
Steve’s face was hot with his rising anger, but he worked to keep his temper in check and his voice level as he answered, “We thought you were
on Steve's hair. Steve responds to the rougher handling with a moan, and picks up the pace, drawing a surprised sound out of Anthony. Only when the noises Anthony is making get higher pitched, more desperate, does Steve pull off, experience with Tony telling him - correctly - that his efforts are bringing things a little
Behind Tony, the typically reserved Falworth shouts. Tony turns in time to see that the rest of his team has lagged behind; a good fifteen to twenty yards separate him from the others.
The art festival was being sponsored by a local art supply shop whose address was listed on the flyer. Steve hadn't had much time for art since waking from the ice, so he decided to drop by the place and pick up a few things. It seemed, at any rate, a good excuse for getting out and seeing the town. He hadn't seen Natasha all day since they finished settling into 'their' new place, though she promised to be back in time for dinner.
Natasha gave a soft, oddly delicate, snort of a laugh. "If it makes you feel any better, statistically speaking, you were probably due for it."
Steve rolls onto his side and curls in toward Tony. This time, Tony is still wide awake, flushed and breathing hard, staring at the canopy.
Tony moaned and whimpered from oversensitivity, and clamped around Steve like a vise as Steve moved inside of him. Steve knew he wouldn't last long that way, and within a few moments his own climax came like a relief, nearly wrung out of Steve in a slow, sweeping unwind. Steve stifled a noise of his own in response and buried his face in the crook of Tony's neck, while Tony sagged against him, tired and utterly spent.
Choosing not to be offended by way of ignoring that remark, Tony slides beneath the covers again and shifts close to kiss Steve. He keeps it light at first, but Steve slowly wakes from the attention, returning the kiss in a much lazier way than he typically does anything. Tony loves waking Steve up like this for that very reason, though this morning he resists Steve's typical attempts to roll him back into the pillows.
exactly seeing where you're doing it wrong," Tony said, pointedly glancing down at his own erection, trapped between their bodies.
He rolls over, and tries to fight back disappointment when he finds the other side of the bed empty.
, because he had no reason to believe otherwise. It was faith, and trust, even if they didn’t actually know each other well enough for Tony to know Steve’s last name.
“Clint Barton, used to be part of a goofy gang called the Circus of Crime.” Tony gestured to an image of Hawkeye in a very different, garishly colored, costume. “SHIELD took him in but he escaped custody. Pretty sure the lure of scrubbing his DNA and records from the SHIELD databases would be enough to attract him to a place where we can pick him up.”
Steve can't resist pushing back, once the head of Tony's cock is inside him, and he doesn't stop until his ass is flush against Tony's hips.
create certain clauses in his will, to protect your right to the company," Natasha pointed out, surprising him.
Dum-E took the note in its claw and moved in what looked eerily like a nod. Steve patted it on the head, only a little awkwardly, and waited until it had wheeled back into the workshop area to get back into his car.
. “I need about ten hot showers before I’ll feel human again, Tony - and ten more before I’ll feel up to fooling around.”
Steve recognizes a French accent in the impatient voice, and a puzzle piece slots right into place in his head. "Dr. Sternberg?"
Tony, on the other hand, was pretty noisy when he didn’t put his mind to being quiet - and why was there any reason to be quiet in his own home? - and he did shout Steve’s name when he came, spilling out messily between their bodies.
"I know, he's got the best expressions," Tony says. "And makes the best sounds, when you can get him to stop being stoic."
"Why are you disappointed, then?" Tony moves in closer. "Did you think you were going to sweep in here like the dashing hero and rescue me?"
This one is a woman, but Steve doesn't hesitate for that fact, quickly swinging his leg out in a kick at the backs of her knees. She goes down, but twists with the momentum to land on her back, bringing her pistol up to bear.
"That's fair," Steve conceded. "I can't say I don't do the same thing, to some extent. Will you promise me, though, that you'll try to be more careful?"
Steve closes his eyes. "I have responsibilities," he says softly. "I can't just run away from them."
“Thanks to you,” Quill said, “I don’t think we’re going to be worrying about Galactus for a while, anyway.”
“I’m counting on her desire to take down Hyperion outweighing her need to avoid other villains,” Tony said. “And that she’ll be worried about Thor and Hulk botching the job, so she’ll try to steal it first.”
“Fuck,” Tony gasped, tipping his head back against the decorative throw pillows. It had been all of ten minutes since they got through the front door, and here he was feeling dangerously close to getting off with all the finesse of a horny teenager.
“Some things do, some things don’t,” Natasha said. “In this case, we err on the side of caution and say, if there
Steve shook his head, tossing Tony down on top of the covers. "I don't think they're a thing," he said. "And if they
Tony sets a battery of scans to run, and reluctantly opens a secure channel to Steve's comms. "Cap? No rush, but as soon as you get back, I think you're going to want to see this."
Shots ring out, and bullets ping against the backplate of the armor while Tony is turned. He whirls back around and comes face to face with a group of Hydra soldiers; half a dozen of them, most armed with rifles, with the exception of one, who has something on his shoulder that looks rather worryingly like a bazooka, which could be a problem for Tony, even in the armor.
“Ludwig was fascinated by operas, fairy tales, by flights of fancy. Before he died about sixty years ago, everyone thought he was mad. He had gotten reclusive, obsessed with building extravagant castles. The ruins we were at were only a short distance from Neuschwanstein. I went inside once ... they opened it to the public after he died. There’s a giant painting of St. George and the Dragon,” Natasha said. “And that’s where things get interesting.”
"No one was able to get close to him, Steve," Peggy says. "Agent Drew failed, and she's one of our most capable. We knew he'd let you in."
Beneath him, Tony began to shake; Steve pulled back and realized, after a moment, Tony was shaking not with fear or cold, but with
It was Steve’s idea, and a pretty brilliant one under the circumstances of Tony’s villainous alter-ego: a seed planted in the Stark R&D database, some hypothetical tech that didn’t really exist, but which would be impossible for someone with Iron Man’s agenda to pass up. Tony knew it wasn’t going to work, of course, and that there was only so much longer he could put off Steve, but ... he was being selfish, and risky, all because he didn’t want this to end.
Steve, shivering from the cold - and probably the blood loss - let out a short laugh. "This probably isn't the best time to tell you: I'm not exactly who I said I am."
Steve rocked forward in his seat, while behind him the others scattered and stumbled. Through the windscreen, he could see Nighthawk’s jet fly over and past them.
to collapse his weight onto Tony, rolling to the side before they both went boneless against the mattress, panting with exertion and excitement that made them both breathe hard.
“Is it too sappy for me to say I think we’ll always find each other, no matter what life throws at us?” Tony asked.
Coulson sighed, telling himself for a solid ten seconds that he was not going to rise to the bait. Then he set down his mug and promptly responded, "Fine. I'll take that wager."
living there would just use the laundry service like a normal person - after Steve inquired about the absence, but Steve politely declined, leaving Tony to wonder how in the hell the guy was going to get clean laundry.
"I'm going into town," Natasha said. She was already done up for the day, and looked quite pretty in a long tunic sweater and a pair of leggings, with a pair of tall boots. Well put together, but casual enough to be approachable.
"I know that," Steve said, a little embarrassed, once he finally managed to clear his throat. "Anyway, he invited me to a Christmas party he's having tomorrow."
Iron Man had a box on her lap, the box from the castle. It was good to know they had completed their objective, even though there was absolutely no doubt left in their wake that they had been there.
Tony gripped Steve’s shoulders, and put his genius to work in the way he shifted against Steve until they could move together in a better rhythm, Tony’s cock a hot and hard length against Steve’s own.
Steve went at it with enthusiasm now, bobbing up and down, sucking with intent; Tony just slumped bonelessly in the chair and put his hands on Steve's head, playing with his hair, letting his lover go for it. When Steve slipped his hand up between Tony's slick thighs and pushed two fingers into his hole, Tony tensed; the press of Steve's fingertips against his prostate was enough to send him right over. Tony came with a shout that he didn't bother trying to muffle, his hips jerking up reflexively until he was buried even deeper in Steve's mouth.
Tonight, they arrange to conveniently disappear from a benefit dance for the soldiers. The Howling Commandos are planning to go on a pub crawl when the dance winds down; Falworth and Carter claim to know some of the best drinking establishments in the area. Ordinarily, it would be the sort of thing that Tony would be interested in, but tonight he's interested only in being alone with Steve. Tony's work makes a good excuse for him, and as for Steve, there isn't much point in a man who can't get drunk going out drinking.
Tony is silent for a moment. "You don't have to leave," he says at last. "I meant what I said last night: you're welcome to stay as long as you like."
Tony looks rather the worse for wear, his skin pale against the brightly colored silk of the robe he is wearing. A crystal tumbler dangles from his hand, with a bit of liquor still inside. Tony's expression goes pinched for a moment, before he opens the door wider and stands aside for Steve to enter.
"I think it's a valid question." Natasha moved over to a display of sketchbooks and journals, tugging Clint along with her.
Tony stepped further inside and closed the door, then went to join Steve on the couch. “Are you really reading files for fun?”
Tony meets with his lawyer, making some final arrangements - in secret - for the sake of the company. He makes the final revisions to his will, and as a last gesture, turns over a letter to his lawyer, to be delivered on the occasion of his death. Inside, he explains the whole truth to those he has left behind, the reasons for his leaving, his wishes not to drag them into his downward spiral.
Steve caught on that she was joking, but it was too late to stop himself from reflexively choking on a bite of pizza crust. Natasha leaned over and patted him on the back a bit more firmly than was strictly necessary.
Tony shook with a barely audible laugh. "Nope, but call me curious to see what you can do in a bed."
Steve is flushed and breathing hard with the excitement and adrenaline still pumping through his veins. Tony knows the feeling well; he still experiences it each and every time the Iron Man's jet boots take him off the ground, and he's been doing this for years.
Tony pauses, wanting to wait and hear what Anthony has to say about it, independent of any urging, but as the pause lingers, he wonders quietly, "Having second thoughts?"
Tony sits up straighter and presses his thumb and forefinger into the bridge of his nose. "I'm fine," he says, getting to his feet.
When Steve emerged into the living room, Clint and Natasha were passed out on the sofa, leaning against each other, bathed in the flickering glow of the television set where the movie queue was inexplicably still going. Steve glanced at the TV - the current feature seemed to involve a family having a really disastrous holiday - then draped a blanket over the two of them.
There was no teasing or pretense in the way Steve went about things. He stroked his hand over Tony's length a few times, then took Tony right into his mouth. Tony was no blushing virgin by any means, but Steve's mouth was hot and wet and his tongue was very clever, and watching Captain America give him head was something Tony didn't think he would ever quite get used to.
As he sketches out the faceplate of the Iron Man on his paper, Tony finds his mind drifting back to the kiss he and Steve shared earlier. He knows better than to think too heavily on it; they are in the middle of a war, and wartime romances hardly stand the potential to last. Not to mention that, well ... circumstances being what they are, Tony hardly wants to have a scandal on his hands. He could afford it, but rather doubts that Steve's military career could say the same.
"Yeah," Tony answered once Steve's hand left his mouth, though there was still something puzzled in his expression.
Steve checks Sternberg's pulse to make certain he is gone, then he looks down at the vial in his hand. It has no markings, other than a single cryptic symbol. When Steve gets to his feet and checks the counter, none of the emptied vials appear to have the same symbol on them, though a few are labeled with 'STARK, A.' and varying dates.
Tony spent just long enough staring up at him that Steve was beginning to squirm, before Tony finally said, "I'm sorry, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact I'm in Captain America's bed. With Captain America."
"This is such a beautiful beginning to our new regime!" Madame Hydra cries, her voice ringing out through the warehouse.
Maybe by the time Steve woke up, his phone would be fully charged and he could play another level or two of Tiny Robots before heading out.
." Steve bristled defensively, even though he knew that Tony had no way of knowing that Steve had very legitimate reasons for being out of touch with popular culture. It was all the more irksome that the film currently rolling looked like it came from Steve's era; he must have only just missed it, maybe during the war or just after going into the ice.
Steve offers Tony an unimpressed look and opens his mouth, undoubtedly to say something stubborn in response, but only a gasp comes out as Anthony positions himself and sinks down onto Steve's cock. It's excellent timing, really, Tony has to give his alternate that much; it's a tactic that Tony himself should probably put to use more often.
Tony raised his eyebrows. "It's a Tesla," he said. "Only decent looking electric car on the market right now, not that this one is technically
Steve closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and counts to ten. When he opens his eyes again, Tony has gotten back to his feet, the hood back in place.
suspended in unconsciousness, and Tony would be worried about having a kidnapping incident on their hands, except that he can verify that all four of the people represented are, in fact, accounted for.
about, going into this mission: getting close to his mark. It wasn't as hard as Steve imagined it must be for Clint and Natasha, sometimes - in that Steve wasn't going to have to
Anthony settles in, knees either side of Steve's hips, taking a moment to adjust before he gives a slow, experimental roll of his hips, and Tony has to pause again in distraction, just looking at the sight they present - just thinking about how he and Steve look like this every time they make love, and it's almost
"Steve," Tony says, with the tired air of a man making an old argument. "Regardless of my reasons for leaving, did you really think it could last? You'd be amazed to know what people are willing to overlook when a war is on ... and what they're not, once it's over."
"Couple years," Steve answered. "I got out, went to school, ended up here. Not much more to it, really."
wheel over to the counter and pull open a drawer. After a moment of rummaging around in the drawer's contents, Dum-E wheeled over to Steve with something clutched in its claw.
With their late start to the day - schedules skewed by the drama of the night before - it was evening by the time they finished discussing their plans. Natasha and Steve had thrown together dinner from the contents of their fridge, a strange amalgamation of things with regard to the fact they would be leaving the next day, and Steve hated the idea of wasting food.
"Just get me my usual," Tony says. He slings back the rest of his coffee, then gets up to refill his mug.
“Mm, looks like you’re just big all over,” Tony said, glancing up to see Steve’s fair cheeks coloring with a flush; desire or embarrassment, Tony wasn’t sure.
showers, they headed up to Tony's shower, a generous tiled space with two massive showerheads that made the seemingly endless supply of hot water into a truly luxurious experience. Tony stooped to turn on the tap, not that the water in Avengers Tower ever seemed to
Steve heads into the 'kitchen,' which is a tiny area shoved into the corner like an afterthought, sporting only a short length of counter, a sink, and a hotplate. He knows better than to drink the water, even as thirsty as he is, so he turns to the table instead.
Steve shifted, nervous but eager. “Yeah, I guess I am. What do you say? We can do it, together - and then you won’t have to worry anymore.”
Tony settles back against the headboard, newly lit cigarette held between his fingers. "Much like Pepper and myself, and equally kind enough not to contradict the rumors, apparently."
Steve bites down on his reflexive reaction to Namor's derision of Pepper; the two of them locked horns repeatedly during their service together in the war over the very subject. Namor was an old sailor, who thought women had no place on a ship, much less carrying on with the sort of adventures that Pepper embarked on as part of the
"You love me anyway," Tony said, and he burrowed his face into Steve's shoulder, wrapping himself around Steve like he had far more than just the four limbs. He was fast asleep in an instant, finally worn out after an already tiring day, and seemed unaware of what he'd just said.
"Nah." Tony shook his head. "I'm going to someone else's this time. Didn't know if you might like to be my plus one. The person having it tries to set me up with her niece every time I show up without a date, and I thought maybe, since you walked out on me the other night, you might like to make it up to me ..."
, or something - squints in confusion up at Tony, but as soon as he turns his head and sees Steve, his heart rate calms and he relaxes back against the table.
"I think ..." Steve hesitated. It wasn't the meaning of his statement he was having trouble with, just the matter of phrasing it in a modern way. "I think he was checking me out."
In what he felt was a strange twist, Tony woke up first. He would have thought Steve might wake easily, but Steve remained soundly asleep as Tony slipped out of bed - or he was just really good at pretending. Tony peeked through a few of Steve's dresser drawers - as Steve didn't seem like the type of guy who would mind, and they had already gotten pretty up close and personal - and helped himself to a pair of drawstring pajama bottoms that were a bit too long, but fit well enough otherwise, and a t-shirt that wasn't as oversized as it logically should have been, lending Tony thoughts of Steve's well-muscled torso stretching the seams.
At the appearance of the needle, Tony stiffens in apprehension. "Even you can't be that crazy," he says desperately.
"We depart at 0500," Namor announces, his tone dismissive. "Don't be late, or I'll leave without you."
kissing, to a bit of canoodling and some heavy petting, Tony remains conscientious of Steve's professed lack of experience. Steve has recently seemed eager to find enough privacy for more extensive exploration, which led them here tonight, but it's still a surprise when Steve is the one to say, "Come on, let's go to bed."
"Shh!" Steve interrupts in a harsh whisper. "Doctor, please try to remain calm, but there's someone else in the house."
Tony peeled out of his torn clothes and left them in a heap on the bathroom floor, and dozed his way through a shower, spent mostly leaning against the tile with his eyes closed. He half-heartedly scrubbed at his skin, but for the most part let the pounding spray of the shower blast off any dirt and ease his aching muscles.
Once he got the game installed and booted up, Steve wasn't expecting to spend much time playing it, but it was ... well, actually pretty addictive.
"Steve," Tony says. "As glad as I am to see you, I'm having trouble figuring out what you want from me."
When Tony presented his idea to the other two people in his life he felt needed to know, Obie was supportive and even Rhodey - typically the skeptical one - agreed it wasn't a bad idea. Obadiah agreed to take care of the company in Tony's absence, and to make sure he had financial channels open to him when needed.
"That, and curious about your impression of him," Steve says. "It's strange, being in the room with two of you."
But the knowledge itched at Steve, nagged at him, and once they were on board the dirigible, once he had cleaned up and changed into some dry civilian clothes that Mr. Jarvis provided, he found himself restlessly pacing his cabin. His head was much better, the gash on his scalp already scabbed over and closing, but now he had something entirely different wrong with his head.
Gradually, Tony moves closer and presses himself against Steve's front, wraps his lube-slick hand around their cocks and rocks his hips gently with the motion of Steve and Anthony moving together, stroking in counter-rhythm. Steve comes first, quietly undone between them, burying his face in the crook of Tony's neck, and Tony gently works Steve down from it before concentrating on himself.
Steve rolls up to his feet and hauls Sternberg up as well, keeping a hand on the man's shoulder to hold him in a crouching position. At their movement, a hail of shots rings out, embedding bullets all along the wall above them.
Sternberg adjusts his glasses and gives Steve a once over. Of course, someone in the scientific community, working closely with Tony Stark, would recognize Steve Rogers as the true identity of the former Captain America.
- was still watching him warily, as if he expected Tony to run away screaming in the face of chiseled perfection.
Tony tugs his hands back, sighing his exasperation. “Would you like me to put on the Iron Man to open it?”
"Former military," Tony went on. "Suspiciously uninformed on pop culture knowledge. I had you pegged for SHIELD from about the second time I saw you, but -
, had not made much of a difference in Steve’s feelings, only the manner in which he was willing to act on them. Not that there seemed too much sense in confessing an attraction to someone he’d never seen outside a suit of armor. He might as well be fancying a robot.
Tony still looked doubtful, as pale as if he had been the one bleeding out on the ground. "I'm holding you to that," he said unevenly.
"Agent Drew," Steve says, trying to draw his most professional air around him. "What are you doing here? I was told we wouldn't make contact."
Tony pushes the covers back from his face with his free hand, and squints into the darkened room. "What time is it?"
By the time they made it home to Avengers Tower, Tony had fallen soundly asleep, chin tilted down to rest against the lip of his armor. Steve sighed softly and went to rouse him, but Clint beat him to it, jarring the shoulder of the suit with a punch.
"Do I need to have my clothes off to cuddle?" Steve asked, raising his eyebrows. He looked like he was trying hard not to smile.
Tony sighs gustily and turns to toss back the rest of his drink. He stubs out his cigarette and, without another word, turns for the door, leaving Steve scrambling to follow.
“Okay,” Steve said. Clint was looking increasingly like he expected to get punched for putting in his two cents’ worth (and didn’t
; he leaned in and kissed Tony, and just as soon as Tony snapped out of his shocked state and began to kiss back, Steve lost all shyness about the matter. Steve's hands were warm and eager as he pushed up the hem of Tony's shirt and placed his palms on bare skin, only the skittish way his fingers ran up and down Tony's sides giving away any hint of nerves.
There are footsteps behind the door, slow and suspicious, before the door opens a hair and a face peers out. "Yes? What do you want?"
Tony blinks down at the comic book he's now holding, a bright new copy of CAPTAIN AMERICA #8, so fresh off the press that it still smells heavily of ink. On the cover (which probably has very little to do with the contents of the interior, a thread Tony has found rather common in comic books), Captain America has clearly been caught mid-jump away from an explosion, held under his arms by the gauntlets of the Iron Man armor.
His thoughts must have shown in his face, because Fury went on, "We also have evidence that under Obadiah Stane's guidance, Stark Industries has been dealing under the table in supplying weapons to terrorists." He paused. "Stane is one of the most powerful men on the planet. Stark Industries is the holder of a lot of United States government contracts. Neither the company nor the government can afford the bad press in this economy. But Howard Stark was able to name his own successor, and he always meant that to be his son. If we can get through to Anthony and convince him to return, then he can take back his father's company and put a stop to what Stane is doing."
Tony laughed, an awful grating sound that he couldn't believe came from his own throat. "You're the best, Jarvis."
"Yup." Steve took his time hanging up his coat and scarf on the hooks by the door. "Can I get you anything?"
“Only if this is reality, which it’s not,” Tony said, and the faceplate slid up again as he looked into Steve’s eyes. “Right?”
"I'm aware of the Hydra problem in Madripoor, Rogers," Namor goes on. "Little happens there that I don't find out about. They're led by a woman who calls herself
Steve reached his free hand up to cover the one that Tony had braced against the tile, and he rocked his hips harder into the tight channel of Tony's thighs. He could tell from past experience that Tony was getting close, the combined efforts of their hands pushing him closer, signified by the breathless noises Tony was starting to make.
"The last anyone saw of you in public," Steve said, trying not to laugh, "was in the background of a tourist's photo at an airport in Florida. You were still wearing Mickey Mouse ears."
Steve is quiet for a beat, his hand roaming down Tony's stomach. "Well," he says at last. "I didn't say
Tony sees Steve tucked into bed, and sits back with Steve's head in his lap, stroking his lover's hair as he drifts off into sleep.
"Coulson probably should have told you," was what Natasha finally said, her lips pressed in a disapproving line. "Instead of feeding you to the wolves."
It isn't until a few weeks later, while Steve is taking some downtime after yet another encounter with another Kashmir Vennema (and of
The papers littering the table are mostly sketches and designs, but a few sheets are covered in cramped handwriting, what looks like equations written in some kind of code.
Tony got out of the armor while the rest of the team stashed their gear, and broke off from the group as they all began to go their separate ways. Steve began to follow Tony, but stopped short at a sharp look from Clint; Steve raised his eyebrows in question, and from the corner of his eye, saw Tony disappear behind the closing elevator doors.
Of all the times Steve had ever imagined what Iron Man would look like under the helmet - and certainly he had imagined it often enough over the course of four years fighting alongside each other - he had never quite pictured ... this.
"In a proper bed, I mean," Steve corrected, leaning in for another kiss. "Maybe with the involvement of lube."
"As plans go," Natasha said, "it's a little rough. But it's not a complete wreck." She pursed her lips, considering. "Now that we know you're on board, I'll call Coulson. He'll want to have a meeting, bring in Director Fury before we decide our next move."
"I'm sorry. I think we've had a misunderstanding," Steve said. He didn't mean it to sound like a question, but he couldn't keep his confusion from showing. He stepped closer to Tony, and tentatively placed his hands on Tony's shoulders. "The point I was trying to make in the elevator is that I know you're Iron Man, just like I'm Captain America ... but when we're together, like this, we can just be Steve and Tony.
The rules are strict, but not difficult to adhere to: no mention of classified operations or operatives that would compromise their integrity. No likenesses of Captain America without the cowl. No identifying information that clues anyone in to the fact that Steve Rogers is the man behind the flag. The Commandos are all given fictional aliases so that no two members of the unit can be connected by parallels.
Going on an op with Steve Rogers is one way for Tony to keep life interesting, at least. He's there to watch Steve's back, and helps to take Steve's mark, Kashmir Vennema, into custody, along with Batroc the Leaper and his gang. The part where the Bleeding Edge nearly melted permanently out of his pores thanks to a high-tech virus was a little less fun, but Tony still gives the evening at least an eight out of ten on the fun scale.
Kissing Tony was much better here in the warm comfort of this bedroom than it had been at the crowded party, and Tony seemed to think so too, if the way he eagerly wound his arms around Steve was any indication. The tickling of a beard against his face was something new for Steve to take time out and enjoy now in a way he hadn't been able to before.
Peggy urges Steve back to his chair with a gentle but firm hand on his shoulder. "Howard Stark's closest friends and family didn't know what was the matter when he started to change."
“Hey, Tony,” Peter Quill - the man otherwise known as Star Lord, leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy - answered. There was a deep familiarity in his tone that belied his team’s earlier attempts to stop Iron Man in his tracks.
“Okay,” Clint said after a beat. “I’ve got half a dozen pizzas coming with my name on them, so I’d better head upstairs before Thor and the Hulk eat all of ’em.”
Together, they hovered outside a window looking into the Baxter Building; the window was broken, security for the building reporting that the thing had entered through it. The 'thing' in question was taller than a man but shaped roughly like one, except for the shaggy brown fur and the huge horns that grew out of its head. That last part reminded Iron Man uncomfortably of Thor's brother, Loki.
to recover, it was preferable to wallow, and for what reason would one not be able to casually nurse their hangover on Christmas morning?
"Hey," Tony says gently. He kneels down on the deck in front of Steve, ignoring the protests of his ankle and his bruised ribs.
Tony scooted forward and Steve eagerly moved to return the favor, then Tony’s erection was free before he really knew what was happening, and they were rocking against each other, the vibration from the washing machine actually making things all that much more intense, and Tony swore he was never going to admit that thought to
it’s because I made the right call. Just because my decisions look rash, it doesn’t mean that I haven’t thought them out, and considered all the possibilities in advance. I run all those calculations because I can’t second guess myself once I’m out there.”
Natasha seemed to debate it for a moment, then she laughed. “What the hell,” she said. “But I’ve got conditions.”
Maybe, Steve thinks, if he can keep Tony sober today, he'll stand a better chance at getting clarification.
Steve leaned in and cut off Tony’s words with a kiss. “It’s okay,” he said quietly. “I love you, too.”
"What we can't determine," said Fury, "is whether he's hiding for a reason or if there's something the matter with his memory. I sought out Stark a few years ago on business with SHIELD, and he denied being Anthony Stark, or even knowing who Howard Stark was."
Tony's climax rolled over him in a slow sweep rather than the usual punch, and he made a soft, satisfied noise as pleasurable warmth infused his tired limbs. His hands dropped from Steve's hair as Tony went boneless against the bed, and he had to concentrate hard on keeping his eyes open just to watch as Steve swallowed and licked him clean.
"You're not helpful." Steve pushed himself up to sit, and looked around for something to drink. Natasha pushed an uncapped bottle of water at him, and Steve gratefully accepted. He chugged down half the bottle before stopping for a breath. "What about Tony?"
Tony reached back, awkwardly fumbling for Steve's hip, to press him forward, and found that Steve had apparently not wasted any time in getting
"I got you a number sixteen," Steve says, setting the paper-wrapped sandwich in front of Tony. He seems amused as he turns around and hands another to Anthony. "And
"You would care." Tony rocks his hips, pressing up into the circle of Steve's hand. "They'd have you court martialed."
Iron Man groaned and sat up, swatting the bots aside with the wave of a hand. "Ugh. This is the last time I babysit New York while Reed Richards gets to do something fun like go to space," he complained, creaking to his feet.
Steve settled between Tony’s parted knees, his hands coming to rest on Tony’s thighs, and, well, they just happened to be of a height this way. Tony reached right past the waistband of Steve’s sweats, because he’d be damned if he was going to be the only one with a somewhat inappropriate erection right now, only to find that, actually, Steve was on the same page and probably had been for a few moments now.
"This is one of those times," Steve says thickly, as if every word is a colossal effort, "that flying sure would have come in handy."
Steve inevitably found himself roaming around the house and debating leaving. He had hoped to catch up to Tony at least once more before he left, but that seemed unlikely. He hadn't even seen Tony in the last half an hour, and then he had been nearly obscured by a crowd of people he was conversing with.
“He’s dangerous, Steve,” Tony said, his heart caught in his throat. He wasn’t sure whether to be touched that Steve was trying to look out for him, or if he wanted to throw up because he had just inadvertently given Steve the knowledge he needed to stop Tony dead in his tracks. The armor had its own separate reactor, but
Pretending to be someone else was exhausting in a particular sort of way when interacting with so many people, and Steve was grateful when Ms. Knauss finally left him alone in the library while she went to see to something else. He wasn't alone for long, though, before an increasingly more familiar voice said, "You have the look of a man who's reconsidering his life choices."
After Bucky fell from that train, Tony had been the one to hold Steve while he cried. Who was there for Tony? Pepper and Tony's other friends might have been the best support structure anyone could ask for, but they were only as good as Tony's willingness to rely on them, and apparently he hadn't been interested in confiding in anyone.
Tony stares back at Steve, and for a moment Steve thinks Tony might close the distance between them, but the spell lasts only seconds before Tony's expression goes dark, shuttered.
They slide beneath the covers and Tony goes out like a light, but it's a long time before Steve can quiet the swirl of thoughts in his head enough to follow into sleep.
Tony threw the gauntlet in one of the sinks, of all things, and dragged Steve in for a kiss. Steve tipped his head down to return it, his hands sliding down to Tony's waist to drag up the hem of the flimsy t-shirt Tony was wearing. (Tony had recently taken to not wearing his skintight black suit of underarmor any longer; Steve sometimes missed it, though he didn't miss how difficult it was to get
Baron von Strucker laughs, as an explosion goes off somewhere in the distance. The Commandos getting closer, then; Jim may be using the War Machine to blast his way through the entire castle.
It was late when Steve finally got ready to leave Tony's house. Tony was sprawled out asleep on the couch, having dozed off somewhere during
Tony, his curiosity piqued, got out of bed and followed him … at a distance. If Steve knew he was being stalked, he didn’t let on, as he took a service elevator out of Avengers Tower, emerged onto the street, and proceeded to walk several blocks.
By the time Steve fished around for something relevant to say in response, too many seconds had passed, turning a pause in the conversation into a lapse. Tony was paying attention to the movie - and his food - again by that point, anyway, so Steve just tucked back into his lunch and tried not to think about it. He just hoped that, when it came down to it, he wouldn't be the one expected to confront Tony about his identity.
Tony is a bit arrogant about it, ultimately; Hydra's disregard of the honorable rules of war aside, he's too valuable for them to kill, and there is absolutely no way they don't know who he is. Tony just hates the thought of riding out the remainder of the war in a POW camp - he definitely isn't giving up
"Huh?" Steve was surprised by the abrupt subject change, and he leaned forward to peer out the window.
people, including many female (and a few male) SHIELD personnel, thought that Captain America was just an oblivious relic from the 1940's, but it wasn't like people hadn't been having sex seventy years ago. If anything, war was an even greater motivator; some men didn't want to die virgins and 'I might die tomorrow' proved to be a pretty good excuse to get a girl to go upstairs with you.
"You are evil," Tony accused. He glanced down at himself, and was dismayed to find he hardly even looked
Tony can tell from the way Steve is vibrating with anticipation just outside his field of vision, that Steve expects him to be excited. But he can’t quite tear his eyes away from the glaring error, and he quickly flips the book open to page through it, checking to see if the error has carried over to the rest of the panels.
Their new arrival is a mild-mannered looking man, average height and build, with little round glasses. His hair looks like it's prematurely turning gray, and his brown eyes are kind. The specialist, Steve guesses.
Tony wriggled against Steve, clearly impatient. "Right," he said, with the sort of tone that suggested he didn't quite
Natasha glanced up at the sky, raising a hand to shield her eyes. “There’s our ride, Cap. Jarvis knows, of course, and Pep, but - I trust we’ll keep this between us?”
Tony suspected his answering shrug wasn't as nonchalant as he hoped. "Today is move-in day for Sam," he said. "I wanted to help him get settled in."
The Captain seemed to place his focus on foiling petty crime on the street level, and he had never, to date, been spotted outside of Brooklyn. An unsanctioned, homegrown hero, then - one interested in protecting his own neighborhood and keeping his head down, which explained why so far the Squadron had chosen to leave him alone. Maybe they knew who he was, and he had simply declined the invitation to join up.
Tony turns away, reaching for his drink. "I've been visited by SHIELD before, you know. They think I'm working for the enemy."
Natasha didn't comment, but her gaze was a little sharper as she looked back at Tony, thoughtfully tilting her head to one side.
For reasons Natasha hadn't yet been able to fully determine, Clint had never quite warmed up to Steve the way that everyone else had. She didn't like not having a full handle on a situation, but contenders for the prize were jealousy that Coulson's idol was constantly around, or that Clint was simply being obstinate and refusing to like Steve because everyone else
Howard Stark chomped on the end of his cigar, laughed sharply, and said, “Well, how do you like that.”
"Yeah? I would've said gym teacher, if I didn't know we had one already." Tony's gaze lingered, and it was hard to mistake it for anything but appreciative.
Tony took the photo and stared at the figures in it: Steve, in a more utilitarian, old fashioned version of his dark uniform, stood next to a dark-haired man in a domino mask, carrying a sniper rifle; another was pointy-eared and wore a haughty expression despite the fact he was nearly naked, and the fourth rounding out the group was holding a ball of fire in his outstretched hand.
Steve felt bad waking Tony, but he also needed to get his car out of the garage, and leaving the door open wasn't an option. He cleaned up their mess of takeout cartons, beer bottles, and the demolished plate of gingerbread cookies while the credits rolled and he considered what to do. By the time Steve was forced to switch off the movie, Tony was still sound asleep. Steve pulled a blanket from the back of the couch and draped it over Tony, then stepped out into the workshop area.
By the time Steve broke the kiss to reach for the nightstand drawer, Tony was breathless and eager; Steve felt a little bad about that, considering he wasn't exactly planning on rushing things along. Tony watched intently as Steve got out the bottle of lube, just unfamiliar enough with staying in Steve's room that he was clearly a little thrown off predicting how things might go. Steve liked it that way; Tony was always far too preoccupied with numbers and percentages, and Steve enjoyed getting Tony's mind off things.
