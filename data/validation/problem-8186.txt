“Please. First of all, you’re also a millennial. Secondly, if you’ve never had avocado toast before, you’ll be eating your words very shortly.” Steve retorted.
As if on cue, Steve heard his phone chirp, indicating a new text message. He slowly moved to reach for the device on his nightstand, and felt a shudder run through him when he saw that the message was from Tony.
Steve quirked an eyebrow. “You know how to be quiet?”
name is Steve.”
“Have you talked to Tony about this?” the redhead asked, softly.
yelling at his daughter.
“Don’t worry, you’re not in trouble,” Coulson offered, seemingly reading Tony’s mind, “but I’ve seen the work you’ve done and spoken with some of your clients. Your turnaround time is extremely impressive, especially for a one man team who has a full time job. I really think you’d be able to change the game for our web team, and help this company offer something extraordinary to our clients.”
more kissing before the new year) and Cora giggled and tore the confetti to shreds.
Natasha gave a sympathetic smile, placing her hand on Steve’s shoulder for reassurance.
Tony sat there across from Steve, watching the omega struggle to choose exactly what he wanted to eat. Once they had decided to go out for food, Steve almost immediately suggested going for breakfast food. Tony was more than happy to oblige thinking the blond knew exactly what he wanted. However, 20 minutes into their stay at IHOP, and after the fifth time of Steve looking through the menu front to back, Tony just smiled to himself.
“Well, it’ll be at least another hour until Sam brings Cora back home, so maybe you could come up for a bit. Only if you want, though! We don’t have to do anything other than talk, but I just… don’t really want to say bye just yet.”
The second the words left his mouth, he slouched down in his chair. Carol looked at him, desperately trying to understand the current problem.
With that, Tony was launched into another fit of laughter. It had been six hours since he’d first run into the shorter man at the museum. In that time, they walked around the city to find lunch, ate food, then continued to walk around the city, eventually ending up at Steve’s apartment. There, they had a few beers and learned a little more about one another. As they sat there laughing uncontrollably, Tony thought that asking Steve to hang out outside of the bar was a genius idea, though he’d never actually say as much to Rhodey.
get pregnant your first time.”
Steve said his goodbyes before heading towards Tony’s classroom clutching his notebook and the rest of his food. As exhausting as it could be dealing with his friends, Steve found himself feeling like a huge weight had just been lifted off his shoulders. He’d been considering asking Tony out on a date but wanted a sign from anyone that it wasn't a horrible mistake. If three of his closest friends thought it was a good idea then that had to count for something.
“Alrighty, well, if that was it, I’m ready for food!” Bucky said, moving to stand.
“Love you, too.”
“Like what?” Steve asked, nervously. It only took a moment for Steve to realize that they were completely alone. “Where is everyone?” he asked, looking around. When his eyes landed on Tony, he was met with a large smile.
“Are you kidding me?!” Tony threw his hands up in exasperation. “I literally paid a premium to move to a desk within your direct line of sight a month after I started working there, in the hope that you’d eventually break down and ask me out!”
Steve was only able to focus on the pride he felt at knowing Tony wanted to reward him, before he felt a wide, wet surface on his hole. “Oh
Thinking back on that moment now, Tony realized he’d probably need to dissect the fact that he wanted to kiss Steve, at some point. But for now he was perfectly happy just sitting with the omega, watching his endless struggle to determine what to order.
“Please Tony, do tell me, when exactly is the right time to just say ‘hey by the way my dad’s--and my--name is on the side of a building and I’m loaded. Hurr hurr hurr’?”
Natasha considered this for a moment. “You’ve never seen him before?” she asked, narrowing her eyes. Tony shook his head in response.
Tony liked to pretend that he was a lone-alpha, and that he was fine without anyone. But he sometimes wondered what it would be like to love someone so fully that he could feel it in his bones. Almost as soon as that thought would pop into Tony's head, he'd immediately shake it off. He knew that there were some people in life who weren't meant to find their bond mate and he was almost certain he was one of them.
It took a moment for everything to click in his mind, but once it did, Ty’s eyes went wide.
Steve's way of 'figuring it out' was to just ignore Tony completely, but it only took half a day to realize that that definitely wasn't going to work. It was after that, that Steve settled on the 'kill him with kindness' approach. Being overly nice to Tony seemed to work well enough, so it stuck. Though being as nice as possible seemingly made work easier, it pained Steve to bite his tongue at some of the brunet's comments. So he found himself here, where he started work every day, trying to breathe evenly while reminding himself that he wasn't allowed to murder Tony, no matter how desperately he wanted to.
Tony handed Bruce his car keys, before turning to face the blond.
through. Yeah, he was horny and naked and his boyfriend was too, but he wasn’t sure how keen he was on laying said naked bodies on the sticky aquarium floor.
“Alright, well, get home safely,” Steve spoke, giving a smile.
are the boots Cora wanted:
“I’ve been pretty sick for the past few days, probably just food poisoning or something,” Steve answered, quietly.
Steve sat there, nervous again, as Fury looked at him, trying to place his face. Almost immediately, he snapped his fingers, and smiled wide.
When he looked up at his friends, they were all smiling at him. For the first time in days, Steve felt like he was able to forget about whatever had him feeling ill and just enjoy being in the moment. He truly wanted to savor this day and this time with his best friends, so he stood slowly, and clapped his hands together.
“Eloquent, babe,” Steve said around a smile. He kissed Tony’s nose. “Which do you prefer?”
“Hey Bruce, Hey Tony,” Steve greeted, taking away the two extra place settings on the table.
“Oh, yeah that'd be lovely. Thanks, Tony.” Steve noticed the slight glint in Tony’s eyes at the sound of his name and he made a mental note to start saying it more from that point on.
“What if I want to make out with you again? What if I want to feel you sitting on my lap again? What if I want to hear all those moaning sounds you made again? Tony, I’m not sorry about what happened last night, and I doubt you are either.”
“Ok...how do you plan to do that?” Steve questioned, suspicious.
“Well, we have to at least make sure to choose horses that move, otherwise, this is just a waste of a carousel ride,” Steve said. “Here, how about these two,” he said, pointing to a tan horse with a blond mane and a light brown horse with a dark brown mane.
“You know...you could just apologize for being an ass, and maybe try being nicer to people. I’m sure that’d be a lot cheaper and easier than running this whole thing on your own.”
In the next moment, Tony slowly moved forward, breaching Steve’s rim and taking care to be as gentle as possible. He bottomed out in no time, and looked down to check in with his partner. Steve had the most beautiful expression on his face, the moment all discomfort from the intrusion gave way to sheer bliss. While giving Steve’s body a chance to adjust, Tony closed his eyes to take in everything he was feeling. The tight, slick warmth of Steve’s hole felt absolutely magnificent. Tony wanted nothing more than to stay here, like this, until the end of time. However, the deep, shuddering breath that Steve let out brought him back to the current moment. He opened his eyes to look down at his lover, to see Steve already panting.
“I didn’t back out and I’m not now. Please, Steve you have to know that I wouldn’t do that to you...either of you.”
Tony sat outside of his favorite bistro waiting for his friends to arrive for breakfast. As he waited, he sat on his phone, texting Steve, a much more regular occurrence as of late. Since running into each other at the museum, Tony and Steve have become somewhat inseparable. At least as inseparable as their schedules would allow. If they weren’t spending time together, they were texting or talking on the phone. At this point their friends knew if they had their phone in hand, they were talking to one another.
“So...what?” Steve replied, confused.
The blond quickly locked the screen and pulled the phone into his chest. “Nothing. Quit being such a nosy Nancy,” Steve joked, moving to pick up an axe to take his turn.
Tony pulled Steve’s shirt up and off, revealing a small tattoo along his clavicle.
“Tony, this is ridiculous, I’m sitting on top of you, offering up all of this…”
“This is amazing, Tony. Thank you.” Steve whispered, turning the stuffed animals over in his hands.
As the day went on, Steve’s daydreams got dirtier and dirtier, getting him far more worked up than he needed to be in his state. He tried desperately to get himself through this, but with each orgasm, he had Tony’s name on his lips, and the alpha’s knot on his mind. Steve had one hand, wrist deep inside himself, with the other holding onto his dick and pumping for dear life when his phone chirped again. He wanted to ignore it, but he could see that it was from Tony. Sighing, he removed his hands from their current position and took hold of his phone.
“Is everything alright?” Sarah asked, voice laced with concern.
The brunet asked, realizing that he hadn't asked his friend over.
“You wanna know more about me? Fine. Ask me anything you want to know,” Tony spoke, nothing but confidence and bravado in his voice.
Once he was finally out of surgery, and taken to his recovery room, Steve renewed his efforts to give some kind of indication that he was here with the brunet, who had taken up post now sitting on the right side of the bed. The room was silent, save for the beeping of the machines monitoring Steve’s condition. There was a soft knock on the door, to which Tony instructed the visitor to come in.
“Mm, what’r you doin’?” Steve asked, slowly waking from his sleep, and causing the brunet to freeze right in his tracks.
The blond had this way of getting all shy and soft spoken when he thinks he’s being a little too forward, and Tony found it absolutely endearing.
“Wow...well, uhm...okay, thanks,“ Tony spoke, clearly still a little shocked.
Steve continued to laugh, feeling the sides of his stomach begin to ache. It had been years since he and Natasha danced around, singing along to their favorite boy bands. But Natasha randomly invited him for a sleepover, so it only made sense this would happen.
Tony sat in the back of his car, looking out the window as Happy drove, drumming on the steering wheel to the song on the radio. Outside, buildings flew by, but as they got farther away from the city, sky scrapers gave way to snow capped trees and sparse greenery. A sigh escaped Tony’s lips as he sat back and tried to enjoy the view, but the anticipation had him feeling antsy.
"Well, you sweetened this with honey for me, so now I know you're really desperate for me to agree to whatever you have to say. What do you want?"
Without a word, Tony stood up and left. He’d never seen Coulson that upset, and though he’d gotten under the man’s skin more than a handful of times in the past, he’d never had the alpha talk to him like that. He figured that if this whole mess was somehow his fault, he’d have to do something to fix it. Quickly walking to his desk, Tony collected his things to leave.
Tony stood there and looked from Pepper to Rhodey, silently asking his friend for confirmation on the accusation. Rhodey just gave a slightly apologetic smile and shrugged his shoulders. At that, Tony slumped down into a chair at his kitchen table.
“No! I had no idea what was happening until it was too late. You were all gone to visit your families and I couldn’t ask you to come back for that. So I figured I’d just tough it out and everything would be ok. But Tony came by after I missed his holiday get together and once he saw me he knew.”
Tony searched Steve’s eyes for sincerity, and sighed once he’d found it.
Bucky elbowed Clint in the rib, hard, then turned to look at his friend.
They managed to pass the time, though, moving all of Steve's belongings into Tony's house. The day the omega was released from the hospital, Tony took him to his apartment, told him to pack his essentials, then promised they would come back to move the rest of his belongings. Steve just laughed at Tony's proposal but obliged. They had spent every single day together since.
By the time, Tony’s knot had gone down, he had managed to doze off. Steve felt the draw of sleep pulling him further as he snuggled closely to the man beneath him. He knew that at some point they’d need to talk this all over, but Steve couldn’t hold back a smile as he looked up at Tony, at
Tony wasn't exactly sure of the time when he left work, but it looked like it had just become dark out so it wasn't too late. He walked down the street a ways from SI to find a sultry looking bar. The building was black, with a red logo in the center of a seductive looking name. Tony figured this bar would be as good as any, and walked inside. Thankfully, it wasn’t very busy, so he took a seat at the counter. He quickly placed his head in his hands, and closed his eyes as he tried to gather his thoughts.
“Unfortunately, Lady Liberty isn’t returning my calls, so I’ve got nothing but time today.”
Tony paced back and forth waiting for a reply. When his phone finally chipped, he jumped.
“Cut the bullshit, Tiberius. You and I both know why you’re here, so let’s just get to it.”
"Oh...okay," Steve replied, still seeming unsure.
“What did he look like?”
“Steve, how did this happen?” Natasha asked, rubbing her hand up and down the blond’s back, soothingly.
Tony made his way down until he was at the top of Steve’s jeans. They hadn’t done anything besides kissing since their adventure during
“How is it,” Tony began, laying down his fork in an attempt to get the omega’s attention, “that you are this cute all the time? Is this new or was I just completely blind for the first three years we worked together?”
Steve whispered with a slight blush, trying out the name.
“Of course Miss Potts, he’s all yours.”
Steve deflated. “I don’t want to,” he admitted. “It’s just that… I trusted you. I bared my soul, so to speak. We were… I told you everything and now I don’t know how much of what you’ve told me is a lie and--”
“He said that… Steve,” it was as if the word physically hurt him to say. “He said that Steve would rob me of everything I have. He was talking about money, which Steve obviously wanted nothing to do with, but I still ended up losing everything.”
There was a silence that fell over the room at that. Steve stood there, secretly hoping that he could disappear into thin air at any minute. He surveyed the looks of each friend, noting the sudden look of anger on Bucky’s face.
“How could you think for a fucking second that you are a bank account to me? All I’ve ever done is love you and--”
“Oh, really? What part?” Natasha asked with a knowing smile on her face.
“Because no one wants to taste their own jizz?”
Now that he was more awake, Steve felt better prepared to address the message from Tony.
Tony ran a hand over his face as he let Pepper’s words settle on him. He remembered back to the day that he overheard Natasha inviting Steve to the party. Steve didn’t want to come, mainly because he didn’t like Tony, and yeah...it hurt like hell to actually hear the blond say it. He had wanted to right things with Steve for quite some time but had never figured out the right way to do it. Tony figured if he could find a way to get Steve to come to his party, maybe he could fix things between them. Not actually expecting that plan to work, Tony went into overdrive trying to make sure nothing screwed up his chances of getting in Steve’s good graces.
“Get this thing away from me,” he spoke through clenched teeth, shoving at Coraline.
Steve looked around the room to see all of his friends exchanging looks amongst each other. He couldn’t help but wish he could read their minds as it seemed that they were all somehow silently communicating. After a long moment, Bucky finally turned toward Steve and smiled.
“As much as I hate you both, thanks for meeting Steve and his friends tonight.”
She looked up at him and gave him a smile that reminded him a lot of the face Pepper would make when she was being polite but clearly meant business.
“As you wish,” Tony promised, moving his hips to thrust into Steve’s tight wet heat.
“I’m implying that maybe this guy has some motives other than just being your friend. I just want to make sure that you’re not getting yourself into something you don’t really want to be a part of.”
Pepper looked up at him with a sad smile, but nodded anyway. He knew she was just trying to help, and quite honestly he was grateful for it. Tony had been running from a lot of things for a long time, but she was always there to make him face things head on. This, though, this was something Tony wasn’t even sure he could take on.
“Why not?” Tony asked, standing his ground. He’d gotten this far. “I’ve been flirting with you for weeks! You clearly want to flirt back, but you just don’t. It’s infuriating. Do I smell or something? No, I know the answer to that because I wear very expensive cologne, so it’s obviously not that. But, I do have to admit, your restraint and self control alone are pretty admirable and deserve a reward.”
“Oh, I uh…” Tony began, “I’m not doing too much of anything really. My family is kind of...all over the place so we’re not really able to get together during holidays.”
“It sounds as if you think there’s an issue here,” Steve prompted, hoping to help Bucky get to his real point.
Steve narrowed his eyes at his friend as she stood in front of him, still holding that same nervous smile. After a moment, the blond finally gave up.
“No, we’re definitely talking about you, and how you’re an absolute idiot who’s made a colossal mistake.”
“But I don’t
She motioned up and down her body for emphasis on what exactly she was offering.
. “You don't seriously think I'm going to let you sleep on this, do you?”
“Hey, nugget. Would you mind talking to me one on one for a minute? Would you mind if I kicked daddy out of the room for a bit?”
“Aww Rhodey, come on,” Tony whined, clearly not wanting to do this. He knew how bad it looked, letting the cute new guy help out for no other reason than because he’s cute. The last thing Tony wanted or needed was to be chastised for something he was already beating himself up for.
There wasn't a single person who knew Tony that wasn't aware of how much he hated Christmas. Most thought Tony was a Scrooge just for the sake of it, but those close to him knew how awful the day was for him growing up. More often than not, Christmas was spent opening presents in a room alone while his parents and their house staff fussed over getting the manor ready for the annual Stark Christmas party. When that wasn't the case, Tony spent the day being looked after by Jarvis as his parents traveled the world, attending to everyone under the sun except for their only child.
Steve knew bits and pieces of news stories about the death of the Starks, but from what he remembered, it seemed absolutely awful. The last thing he wanted was to sour their afternoon by talking about such sad things.
“It’s ok,” Steve offered with a small smile, “but I really should get back to work now, so…”
“What did I do? I haven’t seen you in, like, two days, I couldn’t have fucked up badly enough to warrant that greeting!” Tony whined, flopping onto Pepper’s bed.
Steve just smiled and rolled his eyes. He couldn’t help but feel thankful that he had such amazing people in his life that wanted him to be happy. He was nervous for his friends to meet Tony, but he had no doubt that it wouldn’t take long for him to win them over.
“Let’s make a cake!”
“You...wait, what?” Tony stammered, surprised.
“Wait what?” Tony asked, taken by surprise.
“Absolutely,” Steve answered, honestly. “Plus, I wasn’t sure how far you were going to go to not have to share a room with me, and I wasn’t in the mood to have my feelings hurt,” Steve added, looking down but smirking up at Tony through his lashes.
Steve gave a slow nod and pressed play. The beginning strings of a cover of
Steve cleared his throat after a moment, and Tony fell backward, in an attempt to give the blond space.
“What happened?” Rhodey asked, placing his fork on his plate, giving the alpha his full attention.
Tony worried his lip. “I didn’t want to be a bank account to you.”
“No!”
Steve wanted to feel mortified watching Nat pull out her phone to take pictures of his work as she looked over Bruce’s shoulder. But if he was being honest, it was nice sharing this kind of stuff with his friends, even if they did give him shit about it from time to time.
Tony groaned and got to the couch, dropping down next to Steve. “You have to promise not to punch me in the face.”
“I don’ like Pull-ups,” she whispered.
“Oh?” Steve asked, turning to give the brunet a hopeful smirk.
“Home,” Tony answered around a yawn.
“See you then,” Carol replied before hanging up.
The conversation he’d had with Rhodey, while somewhat annoying, really made Tony think. He wanted to give Steve a chance to prove himself, but he also wanted to give his team the best chance possible at having a successful season. The only way that was going to happen was if Tony did the work to make sure that Steve was at least somewhat familiar with robotics.
“Ah, I have a friend just like you! Her name is Pepper and I’m certain she’d say the same thing about me,” Tony replied, instantly understanding why this man was one of Steve’s best friends.
Tony stood there, dumbfounded for a moment, before scrambling to find something to say.
“I uh...well that’s actually a bit of a long story, but I had no idea that you were working in New York. When did that happen?”
Pepper said hesitantly. She hadn’t been very sure of herself since she set foot in the kitchen, but she knew she needed to do this.
Tony just rolled his eyes, and lunged forward, seizing Steve’s lips in a kiss that was over far too soon. “I like you,” Tony confessed, resting his forehead on Steve’s, “I’d like to keep kissing you if that’s alright?”
“I probably wouldn’t, on the sole count that you just said ‘wicked awesome’, but we’ll see,” Steve answered with a shrug.
“That's all I ask.”
—” Tony gasped as he came, hard, buried deep inside of Steve.
“Ah, well we don’t...yet. Not officially anyway. I just work pretty closely with a non-profit that supplies prosthetics to those who qualify and Barnes was the first person to receive the new model of arms we’re producing, so I’m always bugging him about it.” He didn’t know why, but the conversation at hand had Tony feeling somewhat self-conscious. Rather than reflect on why that might be, he chose to do what he always did: deflect.
The sweetness of Steve’s words sent a warm feeling straight to Tony’s core. “Give me one second,” Tony said as he stood up, looking around the room for things to gather. He laid out a blanket on the floor closer to the fire place, then brought a few pillows over. He looked around for one last item, eyes landing on Steve as he cleared his throat and held up a small bottle of lube.
Walking over to the rest of the team, Steve noticed that Tony was standing with Peter and Rhodey, laughing. The way his nose scrunched up and his eyes crinkled at the edges as he held his stomach, barely able to control his laughter, took Steve’s breath away. He looked on, feeling something new and beautiful and terrifying bloom within his chest as his inner voice confirmed what Steve had suspected for some time now.
“I’m here now, for you and Mason, and I’m never going to leave again. I promise I will keep you both safe for the rest of our lives.”
“Things are definitely going! We’ve partnered with several different shelters and organizations in order to create a structured program for kids from kindergarten through high school seniors. We’re doing a lot of outreach now to find art teachers, retired or currently working, who can take on classes after school or on the weekends. We're also trying to work out some kind of program with the Smithsonian, but we’ve just got to take everything one step at a time.” Steve looked up to see Tony staring at him, giving a smile as they walked. “Sorry, I just...I get carried away talking about the company sometimes.”
“But I thought we had this unspoken understanding that as long as I show up to the meetings you schedule, I won’t have to talk about my feelings.”
Tony tossed that question around his head. After his little conversation with Cora, Tony knew that he wanted these people in his life. Though Tony had no idea what he was getting into, dating a teenager with a daughter, he knew he was making the right choice.
“Not having billions isn’t
“Wait, what?” Tony croaked, suddenly feeling extremely self conscious.
In the beginning, Tony just assumed that the affinity Steve had for turtles was because they were his favorite animal. Upon asking, though, Steve assured that his favorite animal was in fact the Tyto Owl. Tony couldn't help but wrack his brain over the fact that their home was slowly becoming a sanctuary for the most random, kitschy turtle decor.
In that moment, Steve felt as if everything in life was coming together to tell him just how special Tony was. He’d tried and failed to find someone he wanted to share this space with, and yet Tony managed to bring out a feeling of happiness that only seemed to exist when Steve’s mother was around. Steve was already in deep yet falling faster for Tony and as far as he was concerned, that was perfectly fine.
“It is,” Steve said.
(See the end of the chapter for
As the night went on, Steve found himself putting on a show for his lover. Every chance he got, he would saunter around within Tony’s line of sight, swinging his hips smoothly. He’d stand a little closer than strictly necessary, whisper in Tony’s ear with a sultry voice, and slowly grind his ass over the alpha’s crotch whenever they danced. Steve was pulling out all the stops, trying to send a message and he knew his efforts would lead to a satisfying reward by the end of the night. His heat was a week or so off and Steve always felt a little friskier than usual leading up to it. He knew his scent must have conveyed just how badly he wanted Tony as they danced, because the alpha tightened his grip on Steve’s hips.
Tony felt a sense of panic creep in at Ty’s words. He tried his best to school his expression to not give too much of himself away, but it seemed to be too late.
“Honey, me and Uncle Bucky are going to go out for a little bit, but I’ll be back soon.” Steve’s heart broke instantly as Cora buried her face in Natasha’s neck, holding on tighter in an effort to get farther away from him. Natasha just gave him a sad smile as he walked out with Bucky.
There were far too many layers between them. They were separated by winter coats, sweaters, and t-shirts and all Steve wanted was to feel Tony’s skin against his. He fumbled to unzip Tony’s jacket, but the zipper got stuck halfway down.
“Hi,” she said, then began to giggle uncontrollably. Tony couldn’t take his eyes off of the little girl. When he finally looked away, he noticed that Steve was standing behind the couch, holding a plate of apple slices, smiling down at them.
Nat just laughed and gave him a pat on the back. “I told you this was going to be fun.”
And the line was dead.
Steve laughed, hard, at that. In the months since telling their friends about their baby, both groups seemed to find a way to move past their personal feelings to get along. As much as Tony pretended to hate Clint, they had actually become pretty good friends. It felt like every aspect of life was coming together, and now that their baby finally had a name, Steve felt as though they were slowly becoming a family. That thought, of not only adding new friends, but a new life to those he called his family was enough to fill Steve’s heart to bursting.
“All for you,” Steve breathed, letting out a sigh as he felt fingers breach his entrance.
for the first time in his life.
“You know that feeling where you just… you feel so low you can’t feel anything at all?”
“Listen, Stevie, it doesn’t matter who you like or date or whatever, as long as they’re a good person. As long as they treat you with the kindness, love and respect that you deserve, then it doesn’t matter.”
“Steve,” Tony interrupted. “I get it, you don’t have to try to explain what you were trying to say with this. Thank you and I love you.” Steve sighed in relief before giving a small smile and leaning into Tony’s touch. They sat there like that for a moment before Cora clapped her hands together.
with nondescript signage or window displays to indicate what type of store it was. The moment they walked inside, however, it became immediately obvious that they were in a sex shop.
“Cora’s Potty Chart,” Tony read. “Now, when you go potty in the potty like a big girl, you get to put a sticker up here,” Tony explained, pointing to the spot that said ‘Pee or Poop in Potty’. “And if you have an accident, we put a little sad face sticker down here.” ‘Accidents’. “We’ll make a new chart each week.”
“What are you implying?” Steve asked, narrowing his eyes.
“Do you think he’s cute?” Pepper asked.
Tony waited for Rhodey to pull out of his spot before he drove away. Clutching the steering wheel once again hard enough to turn his knuckles white, Tony thought back on the meet that evening.
“Exactly. What kind of moron fails kindergarten? St-
Tony knew what that meant, that the shorter man just needed space to think, which he was happy to provide. He gave Steve a kiss on the forehead before taking a step back to look at the man. He knew what he wanted to say, wanted to try to convince Steve that this was right, they were right. But he put his feelings aside to give the the blond what he had asked for.
“Thanks...Jarvis?” Steve asked more than stated as he stepped out into the workshop. Initially, all he saw were tables cluttered with tools and parts, but after a moment, Steve’s eyes locked in on a sight that made his mouth go dry instantly.
Tony sipped his coffee stoically, as he considered what to say. “Well, Mr. Hot Gym Teacher’s name is Steve,” he began. Pepper settled into the couch fully ready for the gossip she’d missed out on. “He’s a new TA and we’re just
“You’re lying,” Steve said, shifting to sit up, “your voice always does this high pitched thing when you lie.”
Steve watched, with a sad smile, as his mom brought out her wheelchair. He tried not to dwell on the fact that there was a time when she was healthy and could walk for miles on end, and focused on the fact that he was just lucky to have her around at all. She didn’t let her condition get the better of her, so he refused to let himself be consumed by pity for her.
Before he knew what he was doing, Tony sprang forward and pressed his lips to Steve’s. It was chaste, and didn’t last nearly as long as Tony would have liked, but it was more than he ever could have hoped for. When he opened his eyes, Steve sat in front of him, face redder than Captain American’s boots.
Once Tony made his way down the hall, Steve shut the door, giving a somewhat defeated sigh. He knew he had a lot of thinking to do, but at the moment, all the blond wanted to do was sleep. He walked into his room, and noticed a box with red wrapping paper and a note attached to it. Steve gingerly unwrapped the box, unveiling a bottle of shampoo. Reaching for the note, Steve couldn’t help but smile at what it said:
That stopped Tony dead in his tracks. He gave Steve a skeptical look “You wanna help me coach the
“What gave you that impression?” Steve asked, sarcastically.
She blushed and hid behind her hands.
Steve was horizontal on the couch, Cora asleep on his chest, his head resting in Tony’s lap. Tony was idly playing with his hair. The boys were dozing, slipping in and out of consciousness. Tony’s pocket vibrated, startling both he and Steve. He fished it out and saw…
“Sorry about being short with you. It’s just that I don’t know what to do, or how to feel about this. I get that your family is a sore subject for you, but I want you to be able to talk to me about the things that make you unhappy. I want you to be able to come to me and let me know when you’ve had a bad day because of something your dad said, or confide in me what is is that’s causing a strain on your relationship with your family. I want to be able to help you through those things, but I can’t if you don’t give me a chance.”
“I’m going to blindfold you so that the rest of this trip is truly a surprise.”
“I’m doing this because I promised someone that I would look after you.”
“They sound like really great friends to have,” Steve said, warmly.
Tony would be lying if he said he didn't want to take his time with this. He wanted tonight to be as perfect as possible, which meant doing a thorough job opening Steve up. It also didn't hurt that Tony loved watching the other man writhing with pleasure just off of being finger fucked.
“I'm not...trying to date anybody. I’ve legitimately become friends with a bartender there.
“No! I mean...yes, but not solely. I think I’d like to date him too?” Tony asked, as if Pepper would have the answer for him.
She moved to give Tony a soft kiss on the cheek before leaving the house for good. He stood there, stumbling to find words. His brain was screaming for him to say something but his mouth just wouldn't work the way he wanted. He stood there, practically paralyzed, as the only woman he thought would ever love him walked away.
began to play, Tony moved his arm to put it around  Steve’s shoulders to make him more comfortable. He felt his eyes become heavier as the show went on. He tried as hard as he could to keep his eyes open, but as he began to drift, his head lightly fell to the rest on top of Steve’s. Tony knew this was a bad idea, but he figured that was for tomorrow-Tony to deal with.
“Me?! What the hell did I do? I didn’t
“Well it seems that Bug would agree with you and ma. Here, give me your hand,” Steve spoke, taking one of Bucky’s hands to place where he’d felt the first kick.
Steve sat there, feeling his face grow warmer at Peter’s words. “Peter I…” he stammered trying to think of what to say.
“Steve. Quit,” Natasha enunciated, “all thanks to you.”
Tony froze. “Was?” he croaked.
“That’s what Luke’s saying. It seems like everyone just took on their parts separately and tomorrow’s when we’ll meet to make everything more cohesive.” Steve answered, silently cursing himself for letting this assignment slip his mind.
“Well, Tiberius, you see, this was what I called you here to talk about. The AI code that you had my employee steal for you, just so happened to have a failsafe built into it. Basically anything that runs this code automatically has JARVIS on it. Once he’s got enough time to connect to those systems, JARVIS is able to run everything that implements that code...meaning
Tony stood in the kitchen, mouth agape as Steve walked away. All he wanted was coffee and maybe even some toast. How the hell did his simple plan to obtain sustenance turn into this?
A wave came over Steve as he imagined what Tony must look like at that moment, texting him, possibly from his bed as turned on as he was. Fresh slick came flowing out of the omega almost immediately at that thought. He moaned, not only out of desperation for the alpha in his day dream, but out of frustration as well. Since fully realizing that he did infact have a thing for his new friend, Steve had been looking forward to nothing but this get together. He wanted to see the alpha’s face when he opened his Christmas gift, sit close as they watched his favorite holiday movie and couldn’t help but hope they ended up under some mistletoe. But now none of that would be happening tonight, or possibly ever. What could he say that would make this alright and not ruin his friendship with Tony?
Since taking on the new position as head of the web development team, Tony had been nothing but swamped. He welcomed the busyness, as he was beyond excited to be given the chance to do this for a living, but with all of the craziness of the new position came a whole new world of stress. It often felt like there were too many tasks and not enough hours in the day to complete them. On top of that, he now wanted to make more of an effort to spend time with Steve. So, day in and day out, Tony slept less so he could do more.
“Don’t worry about ordering anything, by the way, I got a red-eye for you,” Natasha spoke evenly.
“I’m waiting on you, Adonis.”
“I what, Howard? I’m supposed to become a carbon copy of you? Treat my entire family like absolute shit because I’m richer than God? What if I just… didn’t do any of what you wanted, hmm? What if I just decided that owning a weapons manufacturing company isn’t my thing, so i just sell it?”
Steve wanted to hide the moment he saw the look on Bucky’s face. He desperately wanted to remove himself from the conversation, and just run, but he knew that he owed it to his baby to stay strong. The omega squared his shoulders and lifted his chin in an attempt to show that he wasn’t going to back down. His actions didn’t go unnoticed.
“All this fruit. I bought all this fruit because of how intensely I was craving them, and after two bites...the craving is gone. I have no desire to even finish this!”
“It’s been a long time and… I’m just really glad that we did this.” Steve spoke quietly.
"Look, the whole team is going to Tony's Halloween party and we want you to come too."
“Oh, is that it?” Pepper asked, clearly disappointed.
"Alright everyone, this is Tony. Tony, this is Sam, Natasha and Bucky." Steve said, pointing at each friend, respectively. Tony moved to shake everyone's hand, but Bucky just gave a nod and crammed his hands in his pockets. Tony just brushed it off with a smile before sitting next to Steve.
“It’s a beautiful night, isn’t it,” Tony said, taking a few steps closer. Steve stood there, silently as the brunet came to overlook the party beside him.
“I have one of those tattoo thingies,” Tony said, hiking up his shirt in the front to reveal his hip. There was a small dandelion puff, blowing away, seed trailing across his left hip. “Got it when I was sixteen.”
video he found on YouTube, he heard a set of keys rustling before the front door opened. Natasha and Bucky stood there looking down at Tony as he tried to figure out where to actually start with the unholiness that was Cora’s diaper.
“Cap, you can insult me all you want but you do not get to insult Bon Scott, Brian Johnson and the melodic sounds of ACDC.”
“Grab onto that,” Steve said. Tony looked up and saw a railing he assumed was some sort of reinforcement for the tanks, and grabbed onto it. Just as Steve was about to push inside of Tony, Tony barked out a laugh.
“Oh, Tony,” she said, moving to stand in front of the brunet, “is that what you really think? That I just threw you away because I didn’t want to
“That’s bullshit and you know it. Everyone here hopes to have you in their section, because they’ve seen how you tip me, and you don’t do the same with everyone else. You’re generous, yeah, but you’re not throwing thousand dollar tips at anyone else but me. I don’t know what you think you’re doing here, but it needs to stop, now.”
“Oh… alright. And I thought we’d been through this before, hon. You don’t need to pay me for watching Coraline.”
“I said I wasn’t sure if you’d skipped lunch because you were eating in here or if you were busy and just forgot so I brought you something to eat,” Steve said, before sheepishly presenting a plate with what looked to be a ham sandwich. “You’d mentioned yesterday how sometimes you just get so in the zone that you forget to come up for fuel, so I figured maybe that was the case today.”
Tony couldn’t do anything but stare as Steve and Cora disappeared down the hallway. After the craziness that he’d been through dealing with dirty diapers and Steve’s friends, the only thought running through Tony’s mind was that he’d never been so excited for anyone to back him back for anything in his life.
“Oh, this place is called Elephant Jumps. I saw something about it on the Cooking Channel and everything sounded great so I figured you’d like to try it too.”
Tony carried the two glasses into the living room—their living room—and looked around. This was their house. Garish floor to ceiling windows and overpriced furniture littered the place, along with all of the new toys Cora had gotten for Christmas. There were still a few unpacked boxes from when Steve had moved in the week before, but that didn’t matter. Tony had never felt more at home anywhere in his entire life.
“Yeah?”
Despite the day ending on a positive note, Steve had a sour feeling in his stomach about it all. He wanted so badly to forget about what his friends had said, but their words kept floating through his head. He was falling too fast, for someone he wasn’t even sure was into him in the first place. As he walked to the subway, Steve felt his phone vibrate. His stomach twisted in knots once he saw it was a text from Tony.
“I fight for a lot of things I want. You were there the night I fought Clint for the last slice of meat lover’s pizza!”
“No! Want da boots!”
“I genuinely forget that you are
Steve said, hesitantly grasping the IPod.
?” Natasha asked, jumping to her feet at the thought of someone hurt.
“I’m glad to hear that Steve,” Pepper said, giving a small smile. “But I want you to know that this can’t happen again. Tony wouldn’t be able to stand having you break his heart like this twice. So if you say you love Tony and that you want to make all of this right, you have to mean it. Because I will not let you destroy my best friend the way you did, ever again. Are we clear?”
This oddly felt like deja vu, with the exception that Tony was actually excited to see Ty this time. “Let him in, J,” Tony said, settling into his office chair.
“Hello Steve, I’m uh…I’m alright.”
“So, explain to me again why I had to sit here alone, waiting for you to show up 20 minutes late?”
The two of them sat in Tony’s workshop like that; joking with each other and genuinely having a good time, when the sound of heels clicking on the concrete floor interrupted them. Tony didn’t even have to look up to know who it was.
“I never said it was a good decision. It was a piss poor decision. But it was five years ago and I’m past it.”
She nodded.
“I…” Steve started, only stopping for the shudder that ran through him, “I thought if I...bit into my arm, it’d keep me quiet...so the neighbors wouldn’t hear me…”
“Well, I thought we could take it easy today. Watch some holiday movies, stuff like
“Look, I’m really good at fucking things up,”
“I know you don’t.”
Tony tried his hardest to move like Natasha (she was far stealthier than any ninja could ever hope to be). He was able to make his way to the kitchen without being spotted. He gave a sigh of relief right as he reached the coffee machine, and he became totally oblivious to the world while he smelled the intoxicating aroma of the ground coffee. As if on cue, the second he turned around, Steve came sauntering in. They both stood shocked, like a pair of deer in headlights.
In all of Tony’s years on this earth, he’d never experienced this before. He had never had someone in his life, who was even remotely interested in him romantically, who wasn’t also very interested in his name and his money. He had gotten so used to the idea that he wouldn’t ever find someone that didn’t see him as a bank account, that now it seemed almost impossible. But as unbelievable as it seemed, here was Steve, perfect as always, letting Tony know that he could care less who his father was or how many buildings his name was on. All that matter to him was the alpha himself, and what do you know? Wasn’t that just the most heartwarming realization.
Thanksgiving at the Carters’ was nice. Tony had never really been one for turkey, but he ate it because he was a guest and Nana had made it taste somewhat decent. Never had Tony done the ‘I’m Thankful For’ thing at the beginning of Thanksgiving meal, so when Nana started, he panicked.
Steve gave a deep sigh before ushering his friends towards the living room. Once there, he went over everything with the advanced AI, losing to DeWitt, and finally, Tony blowing up at him.
where I am all the time without you stalking me,” Tony said, leaning back against his desk.
“Well, I was wary initially,  but you've managed to find a good one.”
The words stung like a slap to the face, but Tony knew that he had to take it.
“Wanna add a please to that?”
“Would you like some coffee? Why are you all wet?” Steve asked, moving around, nervously, trying to gather what he needed to prepare coffee.
“You’ve gotta speak up, baby. Tell me what you want,” Tony gently prompted.
“I bet it was a text from Stevie’s new crush,” Bucky whispered loudly to Sam, making sure Steve heard him.
“Christ, Steve, your dick is perfect.”
“The second you’re feeling better, you need to put this date on the calendar. I will help you plan every last detail of this.”
“I...huh?” Steve was having a hard time processing everything.
“I’m really sorry about the way things turned out today,” Steve said for what felt like the billionth time.
“Well,” Bucky began, looking directly at his best friend, “I think we’ve got the perfect person in mind.”
Steve barely had the time to register the sheer beauty and opulence of the lobby as they quickly moved to the elevator. Once there, Tony stood with an expectant look to which Steve internally berated himself realizing Tony had asked him a question. “Sorry, what did you say again?”
“Tony,” Steve started, concern evident in his voice. It took him a moment to regain his composure and fall right back into the role of a waiter. “Sorry, um I didn’t catch your drink order the first time, could you repeat it?”
“Taylor Swift has this acoustic version of her song
“You are doing amazing things for my ego” Tony said around a smile.
“I hate the both of you. So. Much,” Tony said, from behind his hand.
“As long as this isn’t a hand out, and as long as you don’t take it easier on me than you would any other bartender, then I’m in.”
The office door opened to reveal Tiberius, standing there with his hands in his pockets and a smirk on his face.
“What?”
“I know that I’m asking a lot but I wouldn’t be doing this if it weren’t for the best.”
Tony sat at his desk, typing away, with a small smile on his face. He sat patiently, waiting for the one regular daily occurrence that he’d come to look forward to. Like clockwork, at 10:30 am Steve popped up, seemingly out of nowhere, with a sheepish grin on his face.
“I love you, too.”
“Is that not what you said about the others that you were ‘so in love with’?” Howard asked, moving to examine the items on Tony’s desk with feigned interest.
“Is this how you see me?” Tony asked, mesmerized by the drawing in his hands.
“What the hell, man,” Bucky choked out, grasping at his throat.
“No, you asshole, I mean he
“Just kiss!” Clint squealed.
“Miss Potts, Sir.”
With that, Tony slowly slid the waistband of Steve’s boxer-briefs down until his cock was uncovered, pressed against his belly, flushed red.
“And yet, there is?” Carol asked, before taking a sip of her wine.
Tony laid a kiss at the top of Steve’s head at that.
“It’s great,” Tony hurried to say, with a goofy smile plastered on his face, “it’s great, Steve. Thank you.”
Pepper flinched at that. It was so subtle that Tony almost missed it.
“Well don’t just sit here, go after him!” Natasha said as she thrusted an umbrella at him.
Pepper wrapped her arms around Steve, causing him to freeze. She may have thought of him as a friend, but he couldn’t bring himself to hug her back. She took a step back to give Steve one last smile before she left the house. He stood there conflicted: he didn’t know whether to go comfort Tony immediately or give him space. He decided to let Tony be until the next day. Then he would try to follow through on the promise that he’d made to Pepper.
“Listen,” Pepper began, taking the drink out of his hand and placing it on the bar, “we grew apart, that’s it. You deserve to be with someone who can give you every bit of themselves, and I just couldn’t. I couldn’t be everything to you. Your CEO, your girlfriend, your best friend. All of those are different hats, and there was no way I could wear all of them while actually do a good job of it. I had to make a decision and I know that it might not seem like it, but I honestly did what I thought was best for you. But all that aside, I still love you, you’re still my best friend and I still want you to be nothing but happy.”
“There’s a suspiciously large amount of Vermont license plates here for us to not be in Vermont…” Tony saw the smug look on Steve’s face and decided there was only one way to wipe it off his face. He took a running start before tackling Steve into the snow bank at the edge of the parking lot.
“Ah, I see. That’s kind of how my friend group met as well. I mean, Rhodey and I met and through me, Rhodey and Pepper became best friends. Really, what bonded them was just trying to keep my dumb ass out of trouble,” Tony said around a laugh.
baby growing. That fact was enough to put a smile on his face for the rest of the afternoon.
“That’s what I’m here for buddy!”
“I love you. A lot, okay?” Tony breathed.
I can't believe the sheer number of thoughtful comments we got on the previous chapter. It means so much that y'all want to communicate with us while we write this. Continue to leave those comments and kudos. They really do make our day.
“Look, you’re like my brother, and I only ever want what’s best for you…”
“I think you’re the only man I know who could come out of this not absolutely hating Bucky,” Steve spoke, slightly in awe.
“I figured we could check out the penguins. I know sometimes they, like, do a show with them. Maybe it’d be nice to see while we have everything to ourselves.”
Steve blushed slightly as he handed over the tray.
“So, Stark, how’s the school year going? Any cute teachers you’ve got your eye on?” Bucky asked, steering the conversation in a whole new direction.
Steve got in the car and headed back towards his apartment, looking in the rearview mirror to check on Cora every so often. He knew that they’d be alright while Tony was gone, but he couldn’t help but hope that these would be the fastest two weeks of his life.
We originally said that we would be posting every Saturday, but to give ourselves a little more time to hold onto our sanity, we're going to be posting every OTHER Saturday.
Suddenly, the sound of a throat clearing came from the back of the classroom. Both men turned towards the sound, and Tony quickly removed his hand.
“Yeah..it’s...yeah,” Steve spoke, turning to look at his friend with a sad smile.
Steve said, snatching Tony’s glass and pouring himself some whiskey.
“Let me stop you right there,” Sarah interjected, “I know you’re talking about Tony.”
“Yeah, I had a great time too,” Steve replied softly.
“I’m dreading this conversation, alright?” Tony whined
“I’ve  honestly come to miss the straightforwardness that you have. It’s a quality that not enough people exhibit today.”
Tony continued eating, taking a few more bites of his food before addressing his friend’s statement.
“We need to talk.”
Tony didn’t even realize he had began to cry until he felt a tear drop onto his hand. He quickly moved to wipe at his face, turning to see the Steve practically beaming.
“Regardless, I didn’t just spend three weeks of my life hanging out with you because I made Pepper a promise. I did it because I care about you and I know what it’s like losing someone important to you. I just didn’t want you to have to go through this alone.”
“Ok, well do you want me to wait out here with you?”
“Oh no sir, nuh uh. I only found out about this place two days ago. You were the one who suggested we come here, so what would
Tony Stark. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he knew that wasn’t it, but he pushed it aside as he began to focus on the drive again.
“Are you… that’s okay with you?” Pepper asked, still in shock.
Steve had just barely finished setting up the table before he heard a knock at the door. He quickly moved to open it and felt the air knocked out of his lungs as he took in the sight of Tony. The brunet was wearing a red button down shirt, sleeves rolled up, with a yellow skinny tie and dark fitted jeans. It took a moment of just shamelessly gaping at the man before Steve was able to actually speak.
, Tony found himself able to focus on something other than how much he was hurting. It felt like he was finally able to breath, and Tony didn't care what it took, he was determined to hold on to that feeling for as long as humanly possible.
Before he made it to the entrance of the apartment building, he called Happy for a ride. When his driver showed up, he quickly stepped into the back of the car.
They made quick work of their meal, and though he had to practically rip Steve away from the sink and the dirty dishes he was intent on washing, Tony was finally able to get them both settled on the couch.
"Why don't you get a bacon temptation omelette and then a side of pancakes?"
They stood there for a moment, a strange feeling coming over the shorter man that he had to fight to suppress. After a moment Steve took a breath then smiled.
After Natasha had left him in Bucky’s hands, they called Sam over and the trio got to work on getting absolutely wasted. They played drinking games throughout a good portion of the night before that gave way to drunkenly binging episodes of
home.”
“No! I DON’ WANNA!”
“I’ve never heard so much silence coming from any of you in my life, so either something big happened or you’ve all just died standing up,” Natasha spoke, as she came into the front of the bar. Upon taking in the faces of all three men, her demeanor became more serious.
He hadn’t had his foot on solid ground for more than a minute, before he heard his father’s voice.
Tony ran a hand over his face and sighed.
Steve turned to busy himself with cleaning the dishes, trying hard not to think about how badly he wanted Tony to stay. When he heard the alpha come back, he dried his hands and turned around to somewhat of a surprise. Tony was holding a gift box with his own name on it.
“Please, what?”
Steve walked into work feeling worse than he had ever felt in his life. He had been feeling nauseous for a whole week, generally becoming physically ill at least once a day for about as long. Initially he couldn’t figure out what could be causing it, but he just chalked it up to food poisoning, and tried to go about his life.
“I cannot believe how irresponsibly foolish you’ve been,” Bucky started, looking his friend in the eyes, “you think that because you’re carrying Stark’s baby, he’s suddenly going to want a relationship with you? Is that what this is about? Did you just lie to all of us, and set all of this up so you could get your crush to bed you?”
The look of shock and anger on Howard’s face was enough to send fear through every part of Tony’s being.
The genuine look of sorrow on Steve’s face was enough to choke Pepper up. When he noticed how hard she was trying to fight back tears, he pulled out a seat for her. Before taking a seat himself he offered her his sandwich. After she politely declined, he took a seat and began to speak.
Sometimes, Tony liked to wear oversized sweaters; it had been a thing since he was a kid, for reasons he rarely liked to dwell on. These sweaters usually made an appearance when Tony was grasping for a sense of stability and grounding. Most importantly though, these sweaters only made an appearance when Tony was alone. He may have been the king of giving zero fucks what others thought of him, but he was also self aware enough to know that a grown ass man sporting a somewhat massively oversized sweater wasn't a good look. It's because of this that Tony had banished one of his favorite sweaters to his favorite winter home where no one would find it.
“Uh, hey Mr. Rogers, are you busy?”
“Welp, you sure showed me!” Steve stated, rolling his eyes, “Anyway, what are you up to while we’re off for Christmas?”
“Look, I’ve seen the way you guys act around each other,” Natasha started, “you gave him a goodbye kiss when you thought no one was looking that night we had the movie marathon at your place.”
Steve’s small grin faded as it dawned on him that Tony might be serious.
It took him about a week and a half to actually tell Steve that he’d have to cancel on all of the plans they had made, thanks to his family. Steve tried to be understanding, but Tony could tell that this was wearing him thin.
“What happened in there? Steve, what happened?” Natasha asked, now starting to get scared.
“No, it’s fine, really,” Tony declined. “Enough about me and my weekend. How’ve your trips been? Anything happening with the company that I should be aware of?”
As the pair of them walked, the omega began to feel his heart race, trying to determine what they could possibly have to discuss. The second they got to his office and shut the door, Pepper took a seat, waiting patiently for Steve to sit as well, before she began.
Steve thought on Tony’s words, not entirely sure of where to start.
Steve suddenly grew impossibly more frantic at that last statement. They were talking about taking his baby, they were talking about taking Mason. Steve was six and a half months pregnant, barely just 27 weeks along. He wasn’t ready...she wasn’t ready. He began to wonder if something had happened to Mason during the accident. He wanted to move, to place his hand over his belly in an attempt to make sure she was ok, quickly being reminded that he didn’t actually have any control over his body at the moment. Steve felt his heart begin to break, then. All that mattered to him in the world was his daughter, and the thought that he hadn’t been able to keep her safe, the one thing he had been tasked with doing, was too much.
“Pleasure’s mine, Corporal. Where were you stationed during your time in the Army?”
“Alright,” the man said, giving a slightly suspicious look. “Well, I guess I’ll see you around.”
Steve gave a small nervous smile before nodding and taking the tool offered to him. Tony stood back, giving instruction but making sure to let Steve do all the work as he removed a panel and triggered the ‘on’ setting. He beamed at completing such a small task, and before Tony could think better of it, he placed his hand at the top of Steve’s shoulder, squeezing lightly as a form of praise. For a second, it seemed as though Steve had to stop himself from preening at the gesture.
“Hold on, let me help,” Tony offered, holding just above and below the place where it was stuck, allowing Steve to yank it free.
“So…back to the IPod. You may be thinking ‘Oh Tony, don’t you have some kind of Stark Industries portable music playing device?’…”
“Yeah, it was...it was something,” Steve answered, looking down at his plate, seemingly sad.
“I just haven’t had the opportunity to give it back yet,” Tony answered, finally.
With that, Pepper and Rhodey erupted into laughter, leaving the subject of Steve behind. Tony didn’t know what it was but the thought of his friends not approving of Steve terrified him. He didn’t understand his feelings on the matter, but that was just something he’d have to sort out later.
The blond took in the faces of all of his friends, wondering what he’d be able to say to explain this to them.
Over time, things got better and better between Tony and Steve. Apologies were exchanged (Steve apologized, Tony shrugged and told him he wasn’t as terrible as he could have been), and somehow a friendship formed. At first it made no sense why the pair spent so much time together. Tony was a man of the future while Steve was literally a man of the past. As annoying as it was that he always shad to repeat himself at least four times when explaining things, Tony loved seeing Steve’s face light up at every new piece of technology that he came across. Obviously, Tony would poke fun at Steve every chance he got, but Steve came to appreciate the teasing. He couldn’t give as good as he got, but Steve was learning how sarcasm worked in the 21st century.
“Yeah well it comes with the best friend territory,” Pepper spoke around a small laugh, “now if you don’t mind, I have to get back to work so, please go away.”
“No worries, it’s not important,” Tony assured, “so what were you saying about the coding that the woman in purple had used?”
All Tony could do was shake his head no. Pepper stood and pulled the brunet into a hug.
“I’m slightly judging you for the fact that spring rolls are your favorite.”
“Tony, wait.”
“Yes, you do. And I love you very much Coraline, but that does not excuse you from throwing food at your daddy. Now, you and I are going to wait in the car while daddy pays the bill and gets the leftovers wrapped up, okay?”
“You what?” Tony asked, genuinely startled.
Bucky let go of Steve, suddenly, turning to continue on back to the apartment. They walked in silence, not saying a single word until they walked back into the apartment to see Natasha and Coraline playing on the floor.
Tony wanted to believe that Steve wasn’t that kind of guy, but he’d thought the same about so many other, that at this point he wasn’t sure what to think. The only people he had ever trusted in life were Rhodey and Pepper and Bruce, but he was new. They truly saw him for who he was, but every attempt to let someone else in always blew up in Tony’s face. As these thoughts ran through his head, hot tears started to roll down his face.
“Here we are boss. Need anything else from me?” Happy asked, unloading the trunk.
He answered the door with a fake smile plastered on.
Steve cleared his throat, causing both of the brunets to look at him.
“I love you,” Steve whispered, grabbing Tony’s hand and kissing his knuckles.
The alpha quickly made his way to the door and took a deep breath, steadying himself before opening it to reveal Steve, wearing a dark blue pullover that seemingly hugged every curve of his body and grey khakis that did the same. He let out a breath, feeling like the wind had just been knocked out of him. Steve gave him a small smirk at that.
“What is it man? Spit it out!” Clint said, coming over to see what all the fuss was now about.
By the time he got to Carol and Rhodey’s doorstep, Tony was already keyed up and ready to spill all of his thoughts in exchange for advice. He knocked twice before the door swung open to reveal Carol, wearing a sweatshirt and workout shorts.
Tony woke up with a start as the jet began it’s descent. He took a few deep breaths, trying to brace himself, not for landing, but for the shit sow that his greeting with Howard was sure to be. He had gone out of his way to stay under the radar and just evade Howard at every turn while he was living in New York, so the fact that he was being called to stay in California, to pretend as if he had any hand to play in Stark Industries at all, made him a little more than pissed off. Once the plane came to a stop on the tarmac, Tony gave a sigh, pinching the bridge of his nose, and eventually mustering up enough willpower to get off the plane.
“And Batroc. Rachel, and Bernie, and Betty, and Peggy” Bucky listed, ticking off each name on his finger.
“Tony,” Steve murmured.
“I’ve been your best friend for twelve years, Steve. At this point it’s not that hard for me to decipher what you’re saying when you mumble into a pillow.”
Steve ran the pad of his thumb across it, causing a shiver to run down Tony’s spine. “Is there a significance?”
. If you suck, I will let you know and I will whip your ass into shape faster than you can bat an eye, trust me on that,” Natasha promised, giving a small smirk.
"No, babe, I'm gonna bring this up. Steve seems to think the sun shines out of this kid’s ass and that he's absolutely perfect, but that's not the case at all. Don't you guys think it's a problem that I googled our good friend Tony and couldn't find a single thing about him?"
“Hey yourself,” Tony said, echoing the same smile down at the man.
Tony left the gym, racking his brain to figure out where the blond would be, when it hit him. He ran out to the parking lot, looking around until he found Steve’s car. Tony took a moment, seeing Steve sitting with his eyes closed, just like on his first day. He smiled as he gently knocked at the window, startling the blond.
“Steve, I want to thank you for being such a good friend to Tony. Though my decision to leave him honestly has nothing to do with anything he has done, I can’t change my mind.”
“Hello, you must be Steve,” the woman said, looking down towards the blond.
“Gee, you sure do know how to make a guy feel like more than just your sugar daddy.”
“How did you know to find me here?” Steve asked, keeping his eyes on the steering wheel.
Steve rolled his eyes but smiled as they left the market. They walked towards the water and after a moment, Tony let out a gasp. Steve stopped in his tracks, turning with great concern, only to see a look of excitement on the brunet’s face. “There’s a carousel over there,” Tony spoke pointing to the glass pavilion housing the ride. “I haven’t been on one since I was a little kid...wanna go?”
aware who you are! I’m Sam Wilson. I basically keep these idiots from getting into too much trouble,” he said pointing between Steve and Bucky.
“No, I just...ugh, okay let me start over. I’ve been working more and sleeping less lately. With the new position and the news about the baby, I’m just trying to make sure that I’m doing my best for the team and trying to prepare for what’s ahead of us. I’m overworked and exhausted, but I know that these things need to be done so the only sacrifice I can make is in my sleep. I got word from Coulson yesterday that one of my deadlines got pushed forward, and in an effort to minimize the amount of time I would have to spend on this later, I worked until 5 am this morning. I was only supposed to sleep for two hours and somehow I didn’t wake up until 10. I am so sorry that I missed your appointment, it was a total accident, you have to believe that.”
“Yep, that's him and the whole gang,” Tony replied pouring himself a glass of water.
“I refuse to give this a shot because I can tell you exactly how it will end. We become attached, I do or say something that hurts you, we call the whole thing off and end up ruining our friendship and the team.”
“I’ve had a name floating around my head for a while, but I didn’t really know what you’d think of it,” Steve answered.
“You know you didn’t have to move all the way to London to give me primary custody. You could have stayed here and we would have worked something out,” Steve offered, as sweetly as he could.
“He got through the surgery alright, but he’s been unconscious since he arrived. They say his vitals are promising, so there’s nothing to worry about, I just...wish I could tell him that I’m here and that everything is going to be alright.”
“Ok, yeah, I’ll be there,” Steve said, trying his best to calm his now queasy stomach.
giving him butterflies. Before he had the chance to think much more on it, he saw students start to trickle into the halls. Steve went on his way towards the gym to get ready for his first day of school.
to get inside to find the source of that heavenly smell. Tony suddenly found himself wanting to do nothing but devour whatever was producing that scent, and with that thought he delivered a knock that dented the metal door. With that, he heard some movement within the apartment and suddenly the door opened.
“Steve, I love you, I always have and I always will. You are one of my best friends, you’re the father of my child, and I couldn’t imagine my life without you in it. With all that being said, you might be the most aggravating, stubborn ass I’ve ever met.”
Thanks sooooooo much to everybody for all of your kind words and kudos!!!! I'm super excited to finally be posting the first chapter so I hope you guys enjoy this labor of love and awesomeness!!!
He wasn’t sure if Clint bought his excuse, but it wiped the suspicious look off his face.
“Ugh, I’m still feeling sick. I honestly don’t know what’s going on,” Steve answered, carefully sipping the hot drink.
“But ma taught me better than that, so I bought him a scarf,” Steve finished.
of us in the span of five minutes?! I think he did! I feel like I should feel threatened but I’m just impressed.”
“I hear a ‘but’ coming.”
, so you do not get to sit here and defend Captain Asshole!”
“Why are you doing this? Why now are you asking me to spend time with you guys?”
“I--I don’t know,” Steve choked out. “Peggy thought they were gross.”
“It’s definitely alright. It’s so much more than alright,” Steve breathed, gently cupping his hand around Tony’s jaw to draw him back in for another kiss.
“Am I a...hot mess?” Steve asked, looking up through his lashes.
Carol didn’t waste any time digging into the food in front of her. After one bite of her steak, she gave a satisfied moan. Tony gave her a confused look, to which Carol used her fork to gesture that he should go ahead with whatever it was he had to say.
“So it’s that easy, huh?”
“I was just being a good friend.”
“Everything looks good, honestly,” Tony answered, continuing to look over his options.
“You were talking to Bug, weren’t you?” Steve asked, a knowing smile growing on his face.
That last statement hurt a bit to hear, but Steve could see how pained Tony was just having to say it. So he out on a brave face and shrugged.
Tony threw the idea around for a bit, wondering if Steve would even be interested in hanging out with him outside of work.
“You don't have to give me your lunch, Steve.” Tony said.
“I do.”
As confusing as they were, Tony assumed at some point, Steve would either feel content with the amount of turtle decor they had, or move on to collecting something else. However, 3 years into living together and Steve was still managing to surprise him with more and more random turtles.
Tony internally slapped himself for his choice of words.
Steve made a squeaking sound and nodded, and Tony took that as his invitation to unbutton, unzip, and pull down Steve’s jeans. Steve lifted his hips off of the bed to make it easier for Tony to get his pants off.
“Jesus Christ Steve, you scared the shit out of me!,” Tony exclaimed, clutching his chest.
“FREE!”
“What are you thinking about?” Natasha asked, sitting up on her elbow to look down at the omega.
began to play. “I had been looking for the original when I accidentally added this version. I liked it and it fit well with the other songs so I just kept it.” Steve hurried to explain. They sat there silently taking in the music, and by the end, Tony just hummed seemingly to himself.
with you anymore?”
He wanted to say something, wanted to somehow express the intense emotions he was feeling right now, but only one thing escaped his lips.
Tony just gave a small nod, as he made his way to the door. “I’ll text you later tonight, okay? I love you.”
Steve sat in bed, panting while looking up at the ceiling. He knew it now, without a doubt, that this was going to be a problem.
Tony wanted so desperately to think of anything other than how unreasonably adorable it was that Steve was treating his bot like it was a puppy. He took another bite of his sandwich to avoid giving in to the urge to audibly coo at the sight in front of him.
Tony clasped his hands in his lap, and took a shaky breath. “I lost my parents pretty young too, so I know how much that sucks.”
Tony playfully rolled his eyes at that.
The face he received from the redhead let him know she didn’t believe a word he said.
“Please stop before you have people out here thinking we’re getting married,” Rhodey said, pinching the bridge of his nose in annoyance.
The possible answers may have scared the shit out of Tony, but he'd be damned if he wasn't going to dig them up anyway.
"Damn."
That answer seemed to please her, as she rolled over, popped her thumb in her mouth, and fell asleep.
, but I am capable of being a responsible adult all on my own,” Tony said, affronted.
Steve nearly jumped out of his seat at her question.
Ty was frantically going through everything on the tablet, desperately looking for a way to get back on top of all of this, when he stopped. “What is this? Why do you have one of my bank statements?”
“I’ll be right back,” Steve mouthed. As he moved to put Cora to sleep, Tony couldn’t help but swoon over the sight in front of him.
“Hmm,” Tony responded, looking as though he was deep in thought.
“I’m sure there’s something out there for ya, Stevie,” Bucky encouraged.
“I’m well aware of the fact that you’ve been doing freelance work, pro bono, for nonprofits in the area in your spare time,”
As Tony continued his laughing fit, his words hit the omega, causing him to blush a little.
It pained Steve to know that he couldn’t see his daughter, he wasn’t even sure of when he would get to meet her. But hearing Tony talk about her, talk about Mason was an amazing feeling. As the doctors began their efforts to stitch him back up, Steve willed himself to wake up, to no avail. He wanted to let Tony know that he was awake, and that he was ok, but he just couldn’t get his body to move.
When he didn’t get a response, Steve looked up to see the heartbroken look on the brunet’s face.
While he went through his third outfit change, Steve heard a knock at the door. His heart skipped a beat at the thought that Tony had just showed up super early. He quickly made his way to the door, surprised to see Pepper on the other end.
“Why’s that?”
Outside of his group of friends, anyone that he told seemed to be dumbstruck by the news that the two people who a year ago could barely communicate without yelling at each other were going to have a baby. There was some part of Steve that thought he should feel embarrassed or ashamed that he accidentally got knocked up by a guy he previously couldn’t stand. But he knew that this baby deserved not to be hidden or made to feel like a mistake, even if it was unplanned. So, he would walk into any conversation with his head held high, and proudly tell those around him that yes, he was having a baby and yes, Tony Stark was the father. More often than not he was met with a ‘congratulations’ that sounded more like a question than a statement but he always accepted it all the same.
They pulled up to the front, stepping out of the car to grab their bags. Tony handed his keys and a bill that’s worth Steve wasn’t able to determine, as they walked into the lobby to check in. Once at the front counter, Tony placed his hand on the chest high countertop, smiling wide once the young attendant met eyes with him.
Steve shook his head. “It's not
“Are you ok? You don’t look so good,” Coulson observed.
“But I was just getting into which aircrafts I enjoyed flying,” Rhodey whined.
“This is literally the most romantic thing ever. I get to teach you how to ice skate in New York City, right next to this huge gorgeous Christmas tree, and… just give me your hand,” Steve laced their fingers before pulling Tony on the ice with him.
“I’m sorry,” Steve repeated. “I’m so sorry for everything that I have done to you over the past few months.”
“Does that mean you’re gonna keep it?” Tony asked, hopeful. Steve smiled, more genuine before answering.
Steve just gave a small nod. She searched his eyes for a moment, and upon seeing his resolve, pulled him into a quick hug before turning to go back into the apartment.
“Fine, I’ll leave you alone. Just...uninstall JARVIS and don’t leak any of this information.”
“Who’s saying something about Tony?” Clint asked, as he entered the teacher’s lounge.
“Duh. It’s Ony’s burfday,” Cora rolled her eyes. “But he can open the present I got him!” she attempted to whisper.
Steve moved quickly, then, crashing his lips with Tony’s. They navigated their way through the penthouse, stumbling every now and then but refusing to part. By the time they’d made it to the bedroom, their kiss had turned into something more hungry and urgent. Steve took Tony’s bottom lip between his teeth, surprising the alpha. He used that chance to push Tony backwards onto the bed. Tony looked up at him, somewhat shocked, but Steve just smiled.
“Yeah.” He still hadn’t looked at her.
“How did we let this happen?!” Steve asked, quickly moving to check on Cora as she slept in her playpen.
Steve muttered some curse words under his breath before snatching the bag from her hand.
“So now that we’ve all got our caffeine, why’d you call me here?” Natasha asked, getting straight to the point.
“So kind of you to finally show up,” Bucky teased as he pulled Steve into a hug.
“Yeah, you won, but you could have done it in an easier, quicker way that would have likely put less strain on your bots, ultimately prolonging the longevity of the machines the team uses.” Steve said, matter of fact.
“Steve.”
Not long after that, Steve and Tony got ready for the day and signed in for the meet up. There was a lot of back and forth beforehand on Tony’s part, assuring the organizers that he wasn't attending for any SI business, he was just there as a physics teacher who coached the robotics team. Still, he knew there would be people who wanted to pitch ideas to him or talk business. Any other time, he'd charm his way out of such interactions, but as soon as the first potential sales pitch walked up, Steve intercepted.
“Your daddy told me not to tell you.”
“Yeah, sweetie?”
Tony sent out a text on Wednesday night before heading to bed.
Steve was standing at the corner in front of his apartment building, waiting. He’d received a text from Natasha not long ago telling him to meet her outside. He asked why, but wasn’t given any kind of explanation. When he finally spotted the redhead coming towards him, he waved.
“Growing up, my mom always refused to give me chicken noodle soup when I was sick. She said being sick is punishment enough, so you might as well get to eat something fun in the process. As you can see, I tend to agree with her,” Tony offered, as Steve opened the bag and took out the cup of soup.
“Excuse you,
Tony’s smile faltered, slightly, but he gave a small nod.
“Yeah,” Tony finally answered, smiling up at the blond in front of him, “I’d love to try something new. Same time as usual?”
“Nope. No crocodile tears, missy. You do not throw food and you
team at that!” Bucky interjected.
“Yeah, I’m fine, thanks,” Steve spoke, wiping at his eyes, and giving a smile to signify that his response was sincere.
“Reservation under ‘Stark’,” Tony said when they got to the front desk at the bed and breakfast. It had taken four hours to get from Rockefeller Center to the Arlington West Mountain Inn thanks to a fucking snowstorm and truck that tipped off the side of the road. Why had he thought Vermont would be so romantic?
“Yes, that’s me. May I ask who you are?”
“Oh please,” Rhodey interjected as he rolled his eyes,“I saw you run crying and screaming because there was a spider in our bathroom just yesterday.”
“Was there anything in particular you wanted to talk about?” Tony asked, turning to face Pepper, with a glass in hand.
“Well I mean…no one else has spent time with him outside the bar,” Steve said, trying to recover.
“It is so painfully obvious that you’ve got it bad for Tony,” Clint said, mirroring the look on Bruce's face. “You’ve gotta do something about this before the rest of us are forced to intervene.”
“I get that,” Pepper began, looking down as she smoothed out the skirt of her dress, “but I have heard that before from people who ended up doing just that. So you’ll have to forgive me for being a little weary.”
Clint simply nodded his head, pleased that the shorter man finally understood. Steve staggered back a bit and took a seat. He thought the man he was speaking with looked familiar but he couldn't quite place it. He’d been talking with
“Yeah,” Tony sighed, content.
They sat in silence for a moment, before Steve gingerly lifted Tony’s chin to look at him. Steve searched his eyes for what felt like ages, before leaning in to press his lips to the brunet’s. Once he pulled away, Steve let out a small laugh.
“Thanks man,” Steve said, reaching for a napkin. “I think maybe we should head back, I don’t want to impose on you and Natasha, plus I feel like I should probably try to fix things with Cora.”
“I don’t really know,” Tony answered truthfully, clearly irked by that fact. “From the interaction that we had with that bot during the last meet, it’s clear that it’s a very intricate AI, but it feels like it’s just here for someone to notice the programming more than for it to be used to cheat.”
Steve stood up immediately, rubbing his hands down the sides of his legs just for the sake of having something to do with them.
speak about Coraline that way,” Tony seethed, now jumping out of his chair to stand right in front of his father. “You can say whatever you want about me, but you do not get to talk about Steve or Cora like that.”
Steve startled at the feeling of Tony’s hand running up under his shirt. “Is more okay?” Tony questioned, between kisses. Steve wordlessly shucked his shirt in response. “More seems
"Well you did practically just drop her off at my doorstep with no real explanation, so yeah, kinda," Steve answered, fully aware of how immature his attitude made him seem. Peggy just gave a tired laugh and shook her head.
“Does he know?” Bucky asked, through clenched teeth.
“Guys, listen, I don’t want or need any of you to stay here to take care of me. Contrary to popular belief, I’m a big boy who can take care of himself,” Steve responded, suddenly feeling the need to sit down.
Steve knew he wasn’t fooling anyone with that simplification of his relationship but he just didn’t know how to explain his situation. Luckily, the doctor didn’t press the situation any further as he continued on with the examination. Steve sat through everything, mindlessly answering any and all questions, just wanting to be home and so he could sleep the day away, until he heard the sound. There was a somewhat rhythmic thumping that permeated the air around him
Tony surged forward, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck in a hug. “I love it,” he breathed before pulling away and taking Steve’s face in his hands. “And I love you.”
Tony reached down to take Steve's face in his hands before practically growling his response, “I need you…
“Alright then say goodnight to Tony,” Steve said, raising Cora’s hand to help her wave.
“Oh no, absolutely not,” Tony interrupted. “You said you needed to get your hands on one of these bots to understand them. What better way to do that then to build one?”
Tony set a somewhat brutal pace, chasing after something he wasn’t exactly sure of, with each thrust. He tried to focus on every little thing about Steve in this moment. The blond had a stream of praises falling out of his mouth, and though Tony couldn’t pick up on any one in particular, he always heard his name, crystal clear. The sound of Steve moaning his name brought him close to the edge faster than he’d expected. He was prepared to pull out before he was able to knot, but Steve threw his head back and began begging in earnest.
Steve spent the rest of the day, astonished by how polite, easygoing, and cooperative Tony was all of a sudden. He assumed that this behavior was a direct result of his agreeing to go to the Halloween party, but Steve honestly didn't know if he should feel grateful for the change or terrified.
“You’re going to have to teach me how to swim, first,” Steve admitted.
“News flash, Howie, I already fucked a guy and got him pregnant. We’re keeping the baby, regardless of what you think. Plus, I’m 27 years old. We’re past the point of you running my life.”
“Well...first of all, I am
Steve wanted to give Bucky the finger, but there was no use in the gesture. He knew that there was no getting out of this party so he had no choice but to just grin and bear it.
“Doing it the way you like is the way I want to do it.”
“Oh, Pepper… hey,” Steve said, obviously confused. “I’ve got to say, I wasn’t expecting you, but it’s a nice surprise nonetheless.”
“M’here,” he offered. He stood there for a moment, before he heard the buzz that opened the door. Once he got to the elevator, he leaned his head back against the wall, closing his eyes for just a second. Really, all he needed was five minutes and he’d be alright.
The brunet smiled down at Steve as he sat on the exam table, nervous as ever.
Steve just gave a bashful smile, turning away to hide the obvious tint in his fair skin. “Thanks Peter, I’m glad to be here. And I, uh, I think Tony and I will make a great match too.”
“I’ll miss you guys. Stay out of trouble while I’m gone.” Tony offered. Steve couldn’t help but laugh at that. He stood on the sidewalk as Tony collected his things and walked away, only turning once to wave one final goodbye.
“Thank you for helping me with this,” the brunet said.
“Steve I was trying to keep from saying anything about all this before I’d found out what Natasha had in mind. I had asked her to help me figure out how you felt and if I even had a chance. When she told me she’d help, I just figured I should back off until she told me the best course of action. It probably sounds a little childish but...I just didn’t want to overstep my boundaries. If you weren’t interested in a relationship, I at least wanted to keep you as a friend.”
“It’s a hunch,” all three of them said, Bruce a little slower than the others.
“Are you going to lie to me again?”
Steve tried not to stare, but he continuously found that he couldn’t take his eyes off of Tony. Even while eating, his movements seemed so fluid and graceful. Steve couldn’t help but wonder what it would be like to draw this man in motion.
“When you’re so much smaller than everyone else, it’s kind of a turnoff for most women.”
“PRESENTS!” Cora screamed, taking a running leap onto Tony’s lap. “I’m gonna help you open them, mista. You gotta do it careful so dat ya don’t hurt da presents, kay?”
“Thank you for your concern Steve, but I’m sorry to say that Tony and I are no longer in a relationship.”
Once Steve noticed Tony’s reaction, he turned to pull the brunet towards him. “Tony I… it was a joke, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything by what I said.”
Sam and Bucky exchanged knowing smiles before heading towards the front door. Steve did one more quick cursory check to make sure he had everything, then picked up his overnight bag and followed his friends out. Once outside, Sam and Bucky fell back, to follow Steve to Tony’s car. They found the brunet standing on the sidewalk, leaning against the passenger side door of a black Audi, scrolling through his phone. As they approached, Tony looked up, greeting them with a blinding smile.
“Do you want to tell him or do you want me to?” Tony asked, looking at the little girl in his arms.
“What’s that he’s working on?” Steve asked, moving to stand behind Natasha.
Steve worried his lip between his teeth. “Two. But then I’m putting it away. Two glasses of wine is enough to get me kind of buzzed and I’ve never had drunk sex before.”
At first glance, Steve just assumed that he’d misread what was written on the receipt. But after triple checking, he saw that Tony had indeed left him a $1,000 tip.
“Well,” Clint started, “on top of Nat telling us that you’re sick, she also mentioned that you’re going to Stark’s holiday party...thing. Care to explain how you failed to mention this in the last week since you got invited?”
“Night ‘ony,” Cora said in a small voice. Tony stood to give her a kiss on her forehead.
“I can...uh...I can get out of your hair if you’d like,” Steve offered, beginning to sit up.
“Do you...are you sure the baby is yours?” Rhodey asked, gingerly.
“So I guess that’s it then,” Tony said, pushing away any fears that he had about what the future held for them, “ we’re going to be parents.”
“Wow… if that’s the number of zeros you get around here for serving your ex, then sign me up,” Clint said, looking at Tony’s receipt in amazement. Steve felt his cheeks heat immediately, as he moved to enter in Tony’s payment information.
It didn’t take long after his friends left for Tony to start hitting the booze. He’d be lying if he said he didn’t end up having a good time with everyone, but it was in spite of himself. He was bitter, he was angry, but mostly he was hurt that Steve didn’t show up, didn’t even send so much as a ‘fuck off’ text. Every so often he’d wonder if the omega had planned to do this, as a form of payback for the past few years. Almost as soon as he’d think it, though, he’d remind himself that no matter what, Steve wasn’t that kind of guy.
good, I wish I could fuck you like this forever.”
Thankfully, he was able to stroll into his house around 5 am. He set five or six different alarms to make sure he was up and ready for Steve’s appointment. Tony went to sleep with more nervous excitement than he thought possible, but woke with a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. He read through each text message and listened to each voicemail that Steve left, noting the increasing sense of sorrow in his words, written and spoken. He knew that the omega must have been hurt by his absence, and he needed to make this right.
And… that should not have sounded as sexy as it did, but he was happy to oblige. Steve sucked in a rushed breath through his teeth when Tony added the third and final finger. Steve started to thrust down onto Tony’s fingers and, okay, Tony was losing his resolve. He had been determined to make this all about Steve, but he had needs, too. He used his free hand to gently stroke his own cock.
“Jarvis?”
“I’m sorry.”
“You should really share this with him, Steve,” Bruce suggested, sincerely. “This is the sweetest thing I’ve read in a long time, and I’m sure it’s the sweetest thing anyone’s ever had to say about Tony—”
“Alright. How much are you asking for a month? Will ten thousand a month be enough?”
“Ah. Forgot your best friend was an idiot.”
“Sir, Mr. Hogan is requesting access to your room,” Jarvis spoke softly.
“But what's the benefit in that?” Steve asked. Tony shrugged, just as confused as the blond.
even though I knew they weren’t.” Tony ran his hands over his face. “There’s a pool? Like, a private pool for us.” Tony groaned, making to get off of Steve’s lap, but Steve just put his hands on Tony’s hips.
“I am,” Steve said smiling up at her, “and you must be Pepper. It’s nice to finally meet you!”
"A Rembrandt paint set..."
“Oh, this is gonna be fun,” Natasha breathed.
“So, why’d you call me out here this morning?”, Carol asked, as a server brought over her drink. “Must be serious for you to be up before noon on a Saturday.”
Tony rubbed a hand up and down her back. “It’s not me that you have to apologize to. Your daddy is trying very hard and you have to be nice to him, okay?”
"I'm not using him, and the last thing I want to do is hurt him," Steve interjected.
Steve collapsed to Tony’s side, kissing his cheek. “Love you.”
“So, let me get this straight, you’ve done nothing but bicker with this guy for three solid years, and now you’ve invited him to your Halloween party? Why?” Rhodey asked, not bothering to look away from his work.
that he’d played on their way to New Haven. Right as the song ended, Steve made his way into the room and was greeted by Tony’s bright smile. At this point Steve realized, asking Tony on a date wouldn't be so hard, but having to wait to ask Tony just might kill him.
“Thank you. I always loved pot roast growing up so once I moved out on my own and started learning how to cook for myself I spent a good deal of time trying to find a pot roast recipe that I could call my own. This one right here, this is all me,” Tony boasted, taking a bite of his meal.
As Steve moved to meet the other men at the table, Tony stood next to Natasha with his jaw on the floor. “Your fiance’s
“Okay...well, I’ve been unbelievably busy lately. I know you know this because we’ve talked about it --”
“Don’t worry, I’ll keep the compliments to a minimum so your ego won’t get too out of hand.”
As he left the restaurant, Steve couldn’t help but smile to himself. For the first time in weeks he felt like he could breathe.
As he stepped into the cab, he pulled out his phone to text the group to let them know that he was on his way.
From that point on, the rest of the night went without incident. Steve and Tony talked and laughed their way through dinner and when the check came, they decided to split it. All in all, it was an absolutely perfect date.
Steve had been running around like a chicken with its head cut off all afternoon, as he tried to get the apartment ready. On top of having his first real date night with Tony, Peggy had called to tell Steve that he'd need to take Cora again for the weekend.
“Tony came over last night to watch a few movies. We were supposed to go to the museum and a late lunch but since we were both busy earlier in the day we figured a movie night would be a good idea. So he came over, we watched some of my favorite horror movies, and...I ended up falling asleep on his shoulder. Somehow he fell asleep too and we didn’t wake up until this morning…”
“Tony, you didn’t know,” Pepper said, trying to reassure him.
Before Tony had a chance to express the same sentiment, Steve’s phone rang. Tony tried not to eavesdrop, but the second he took a look at Steve’s face, he knew something was wrong.
“So, what brings you in here tonight,” the blond asked wiping down some portion of the bar.
“Soup and spring rolls?” Tony asked, around a small laugh.
is what I meant when I said you were exhausting,” Rhodey quipped. “Anyway, Steve seems like a well rounded guy with his head on straight. More than that, though, he seems interested in who you are, not what you have. Also, I’m not sure if you’ve realized this but I’m fairly certain today was the first day he’s really noticed the arc reactor...and I think that was only because I drew attention to it.”
Tony smiled to himself, momentarily, at the bartender’s words.
It all started with that argument on the helicarrier: Cap throwing his hateful words at Tony and Tony spitting his words out with the same amount of venom. Tony didn’t know it at the time; he couldn’t see it. But that first encounter he had with his childhood hero, where the Captain didn’t quite live up to the legend, was the beginning of something amazing.
“Well daddy tol’
“I came as soon as I could, I need to apologize and explain myself,” Tony offered, sparing no time to take a breath until he got his message across.
“Oh, ok. Well, if it’s ok, do you mind if I go first? Because there’s something I’ve been wanting to talk about for a bit now that I feel like I should probably put out there now.”
“So am I Pepper! There’s never been a conversation involving me and my feelings that’s ended well.”
“Great! Good luck and have fun dealing with the gremlins!” Tony said, bouncing on his toes as he turned to walk towards his classroom.
“I’d planned to be captain again my senior year, but my mom got sick, so I ended up quitting the team in order to find a part time job at a local bookstore to help with stuff around the house.” Steve found himself fighting to keep his composure. It’d been a while since he’d shared this part of his life with anyone. “So, uh, towards the end of senior year, my mom passed away. I didn’t really know what to do after high school, with no means of paying for college, so I just went into the Army and Bucky followed me in a year later after he graduated as well. I spent four years trying to work up to becoming a strategist, but ended up being discharged after breaking my femur in a longboarding accident, of all things,” Steve said, giving a humorless laugh. “After being discharged, I went to college, worked at a gym, then found this TA job through Nat and here we are.”
Tony picked up the pace then, snapping his hips forward and hitting Steve’s prostate dead on. Steve felt so many sensations at once: his abdomen being driven into the counter harder and harder, the apron rubbing against his cock, Tony’s nails dragging across his scalp as he gripped tighter on the hair in his hand. It was all too much and before he fully registered his orgasm hitting him, Steve was coming. The second his cock was spent, Steve felt his knees go weak. The only thing holding him up was Tony, fucking into him with reckless abandon.
“Happy birthday,” Steve whispered, wrapping an arm around the brunet’s waist. Cora tugged on Tony’s pant leg, gesturing that she wanted to be picked up. Once he obliged, she gave him a kiss on the cheek and smiled.
The smile on Natasha’s face somehow grew impossibly wider. “I don’t know, just a hunch.”
“Well, if we both follow that advice I think we’ll be just fine,” Peter said with a smug grin as he slid back into his seat.
“What?!” Steve asked, seemingly bewildered.
“If you’d stop interrupting me, you’d find out!” Steve snapped.
“Alright guys,” Bruce began, “here’s the baby. Everything is looking great so far. Her heartbeat is strong, and she seems to be healthy and growing normally.”
“What about you, do you have any names in mind?” He asked, now exhibiting the same curiosity and excitement that he’d witnessed from the alpha just moments before.
Tony jumped up and fixed
Tony just leaned up and gave Steve a small kiss. “Yeah… we can do that.”
Tony rolled his eyes but laughed anyway.
“What happened to you?” Clint asked when he came to the servers’ station after bringing waters to his first table.
“What’s that goofy grin for?” Tony asked, taking a sip of his soda. His cup was almost empty and he played up the obnoxious slurping sound.
“I feel like, at this point, you’re purposefully ignoring me when I tell you not to just jump out at me when I’m working,” Steve responded, making sure to sound every bit as annoyed as he was.
“Yes, really. I want today to be perfect for you, so that means you can’t know where I’m taking you right now. Got it, mister?” Tony answered, pretending to be stern as he guided Steve into the car.
“What do I know about love? I don’t know,
“Look, I’m glad that the two of you are back together, but there are some things I need you to know this time around.”
Tony’s eyes darkened almost instantly at the invitation. He reached up to undo the bow around Steve’s neck before gently sliding the smooth fabric up and over the omega’s head. They both stood completely naked, cocks standing at attention in anticipation for what was to come. Tony pulled Steve towards him and the fell back onto the bed, sharing a languid kiss. The alpha’s hands began to roam, circling his hole and almost as if on cue, Steve felt a rush of slick between his legs.
“So…” Steve began, nervous.
“He broke up with me on my birthday.”
It took a few moments before Steve was able to form a coherent sentence, but when he did it almost had Tony seeing stars.
Steve gave a small, sincere smile at the offer.
On his walk to his new job, he internally ran through all the things he’d learned while training for his bartending certification. All the drinks he could remember with their exact recipes popped up in his mind, one by one. Before he knew it, he was standing in front of the bar. He took a deep breath as he looked up to see the
“While I admit, it’s not something I would do, something made you quit your job and according to Natasha it’s my fault so unless there’s something else I don’t know that I’ve done…”
Tony took a deep breath.
. There was a person growing inside of him and if nothing else, he owed it to this little baby to pull through.
At that, Steve couldn’t help but burst out in laughter. All three of his friends turned to look at him, confused, which made the blond laugh even harder. It took a few moments for him to be able to calm down enough to speak, but when he did, he had to wipe the tears from his eyes first.
“He’s doing this on purpose. Howard sees you happy and puts these ideas in your head to sabotage that.”
“I can make us some lunch, if you’d like,” Steve offered. Tony nodded, not saying a word. He took his jacket off and hung it on the hook by the door.
“Hey, so I had really hoped for a better outcome today,” Steve started, nervously, “but I think despite coming in second, we had a great season. Getting to know you has been great too and I was wondering if maybe you’d want to go on a date sometime soon.”
“Please, call me Maria,” she said, standing to offer her hand. “Nice to meet you, Steve. If you could, just follow me to the principal's office.”
“No I mean, really, let’s just wipe the slate clean. Now that everything is out in the open, I feel like we need a fresh start, you know?”
“Well, Steve, looks like hiring you is about to pay off in a big way!”
“Uh...thanks?” Steve replied, still thoroughly confused as to who he was talking to. He rode down in silence, heart beating quickly in his chest.
“Is there… is that…”
“Hello Miss Potts. How are you doing today?”
“I’m sure it’s no news to you that after you left I took it pretty hard…” Tony began, trying to gloss over how bad those three weeks actually were, “so when I got back to work, by the end of the day I was just tired. Tired of faking like everything was fine, and I just wanted to have a drink and not think about anything, so I walked into
“Tony, I didn’t need you to fix my problems. I’ve been perfectly capable of doing that on my own all this time without you, so I’ll continue to do just fine on my own,” Steve said, crossing his arms over his chest.
Steve’s eyes seemed to bulge out of his head, at that statement. “Wait a second,” he began, turning towards Tony, “
“You don’t have to forgive me right now. I wasn’t expecting you to. But please… please don’t let this be goodbye.” It was instinct that had him crashing his lips against Steve’s, only pulling away to whisper ‘please’ every few moments.
“Tony…”
“The only thing I’m better at than cooking is apologizing, so trust me, you’re in for a treat.”
“Sowwie, daddy,” she mumbled into Tony’s shoulder.
“I said I’m sure. I only...it only happened once, but past that, we spent two full days together. He didn’t plan for me to come over at two in the morning, and despite what you might be thinking, I was fully capable of preventing this from happening. You’re seeming to focus too much on Steve and not enough of the fact that I’m the fuck up here.”
The day that Tony had spoken to Natasha, he received a text from her by night’s end saying she’d help him with Steve. Since then, the brunet had been unbelievably nervous about what her plan would entail, but he trusted that whatever it was, it’d be successful. Tony had a stretch of business trips and out of town meetings for the following two weeks, but he figured that would give Natasha enough time to set something up.
Tony was a natural around Cora. Of course he was always nervous that he’d fuck everything up somehow, but really all he had to do was the complete opposite of everything his father did and he’d be fine.
it was expensive, but it didn’t matter to him. He’d spend every penny he had to make Steve happy. It was with that thought that Tony realized just why this seemed like such a big deal to Steve.
Steve stared at the computer screen in confusion. Peggy had always been the one person in his life who wasn’t afraid to tell him when he’d made the wrong decision. He figured she’d be disappointed, but he never expected her to be this upset over his breakup with Tony.
Steve stood in front of the building, not able to tamp down the fear that he’d gotten the address wrong. But upon looking up and seeing the massive ‘STARK’ atop the building, he knew he was in the absolute right place. Stark Tower. Tony had asked him to come visit his workshop inside of
Steve sat in the teacher’s lounge, relaxing as much as he could in the old arm chair by the window. He munched on a few carrot sticks as he looked down at the notebook on his lap.
“I may not have been the best at expressing it, but I loved you with everything I had. I get that you don’t want someone throwing money and gifts at you, but honestly I don’t give a shit. I tried, the only way that I knew how, to love you the best that I could and you constantly keep punishing me for it.”
Steve tilted his head toward the passenger seat and unlocked the door in lieu of a reply. Tony accepted the invitation, and walked over to take his seat. Once in the car, Steve sighed.
Tony’s words seemed to end the battle going on in Steve’s mind. He let out a long sigh before he spoke.
Everything seemed to happen in the blink of an eye. As the match progressed, Tony stood by feeling like he was bracing for everything to come crashing down. Within what felt like the span of seconds, he watched as Midtown lost the game, then he felt a text message come through.
“Good lord, Nat told us you weren’t feeling well but she didn’t tell us you were gunna look
Steve moved to take hold of the hand resting on his face and sighed softly.
“Hey, Phil, what’d you want to talk about?”
Heidi looked up, first at Steve then Tony, close to tears, “We’ve got a huge conference in town, along with a wedding. We’re fully booked…”
Tony stood at the door, watching as Steve and his friends drove away. Once he finally turned to go back to his friends, he saw them standing not far behind him.
Tony was thrown off by the look of contemplation on Pepper’s face.
“Coraline, March 1st,” Tony read, running his fingers across the words, stopping at the baby feet below them.
“Yep!” Sarah responded cheerily.
Steve raked his nails over the countertop as Tony continued licking into him. “More, Tony,” Steve shuddered, “I need more.”
It was then that they saw Coraline answer Steve’s phone that had been on the table. “Hi mommy,” she exclaimed. “It’s Ony’s burfday and we’re openin’ presents!” Her face twisted into one of confusion and she toddled over to Steve and Tony. “Mommy wants ta talk to yew.”
“Hey you,” Tony said, smile softening as he greeted Steve. He looked around the blond to give a nod to the men behind him. “Sam, Barnes. Nice to see you guys.”
“Great! JARVIS will bring you down to the workshop. See you in a bit.”
Steve tossed the idea around in his head.
“Well, are you just going to stand there, or are you going to invite your father in?”
“What just happened?” Natasha asked, seemingly coming out of nowhere.
Steve let out a small laugh through the tears of joy that he was crying in earnest.
concerned with how he looked, but it was important that he managed to look as close to perfect without looking like he tried too hard. He was on his way to Nat and Bucky’s for a little engagement celebration on the rooftop terrace at their apartment. Any other time, this would barely be cause for concern, but tonight Tony would be there and they’d agreed to go
“A-and they’re okay with it?” Steve asked, all resolve slipping away at the fault of Tony’s hands.
“I just want to give him his space, and maybe in time he’ll change his mind about everything,” Tony replied, sadness in his voice.
Cora’s face lit up instantly at that. Steve let out a sigh of relief as she went back to playing happily, as if she wasn’t just on the verge of tears a second ago. Steve worked tirelessly on his painting, only stopping to feed Cora and put her down for her afternoon nap. Once he was finished, he looked at the final product and smiled; he knew Tony would love it.
Tony barked out a laugh at that, finally sitting up and pulling Steve’s head into his lap. He ran his hand through blond locks as Steve looked up at him waiting for an answer. “Yes, that's it, exactly,” Tony said, smiling wistfully.
Pepper took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever horrors lay behind the door. If everything Rhodey was saying was true, she was about to walk in and see a human disaster.
Steve looked at him, slightly suspicious, but ultimately just shrugged it off. “Alright, I’ll walk a little faster, but don’t come crying to me if you’re lovely little legs get tired and aren’t able to keep up.”
“We’re here to see you off, or to help you pack or something, I don’t know,” Bucky said, opening up a bag of chips that definitely didn’t belong to him. “Either way, we’re here and we’re reminding you to take some rubbers.”
“Alright well, I’ve taken a second job…”
“Asshole,” Natasha said, shoving him away.
As if he heard Tony’s thoughts and sought to offer up a challenge, Steve took a bite of his dragon roll, getting a bit of spicy mayo on the side of his mouth. Tony felt like his heart was about to burst, he couldn’t take much more of this. He reached out a hand and gently swiped his thumb over the sauce, only realizing what he was doing after Steve’s breath hitched.
Tony sat in stunned silence as Pepper’s words sank in. He could have smacked himself for never thinking to do so before, but Tony resolved to ask Steve out the very next time he saw him.
“I’m not punishing you for anything,” Steve interrupted.
...any answer but that one.
Christmas was three days away, and it had been two days since the brunet showed up to find Steve almost out of his mind. During that time they hadn’t spent more than ten minutes apart, and it was absolutely amazing. Steve thought back to his heat, and fluttered his eyes shut at some of the more vivid memories. Even with his mind roaming to all the ways Tony took care of him, he kept going back to that first kiss. He’d be lying if he said he hadn’t thought about what it would be like to kiss the brunet, but it was even better than he ever could have imagined. Steve wanted nothing more than to kiss Tony senseless, but he knew that he was asking for more than he really deserved. With that thought, the omega gave a sigh, and slowly moved out of bed to make breakfast.
Steve tried his best to invite his friend in, but all that came out was a grunt. Thankfully, Sam understood that for the invitation that it was, as he walked in carrying a large bottle of Gatorade and a plate of toast and bacon.
“You know we’re going to need help with this, right?” Tony asked as they walked to the car.
Steve laughed as he gently punched Tony’s shoulder, and both men froze at the contact. It wasn’t the first time they had touched; it was just the first time they had done so in a friendly situation. A blush began to creep its way onto Steve’s face, and for some reason it made Tony smile. Thankfully, he realized that he was grinning like an idiot before Steve’s eyes rested on him again. In the interest of making the current silence a little less awkward, Tony raised the IPod in between them.
“Yeah..I think so,” Steve responded, placing a gentle hand on his belly, “I’m just really excited to see Bug again.”
“Yeah Tony, sounds really good.”
“Even though I think you’re right, Peter, I’ve gotta say it’s a little disconcerting that you’re
“Relax, Rogers. I’m not asking for you to prove yourself here, after all you’ve already got the job,” Fury interrupted. Steve snapped his mouth shut and listened. “I just want to reiterate that we’re entrusting you with a lot here and if this doesn’t work out, it’s not just your career that could be impacted. So, as long as you do your best and work hard, we shouldn’t have any problems.”
“Ahh, well if you’re up for it, every year I have a get together with Rhodey, Pepper and their mates a few days before Christmas. I insist that we not do the whole gifting thing, but I get them something anyway, and then we each pick a holiday movie and watch all of them. You’re more than welcome to come if you’d like.”
Tony stayed for a few hours after initially finding out that Steve was going to have a baby. They talked about several things: how Steve had been feeling for the past month or so, what happened when he found out, and who knows about the baby. They also discussed Steve quitting his job.
Steve moved with lightning speed, feeling his face warm as he folded his arms on the counter and rested his head atop of them. Rimming was a relatively new addition to their sex life. Steve had made mention of the fact that it had always intrigued him, but he never felt comfortable broaching the topic with partners before or during the war. Tony had been so kind and caring the first time they tried it and Steve had such a wonderful time. Now, Tony would offer to eat Steve out any time he wanted to really show his appreciation for his boyfriend.
why.”
“Ok, listen, Pep is right...I fucked up. And when I say I fucked up I mean like I never have before. This is...this is huge.”
They both leaned in for a kiss, neither of them wanting to be the one to end it. After a moment, though, Steve pulled back to rest his forehead on Tony’s.
“Everyone in our group is helping with this, Steve. Plus I know you’re not busy.” Natasha replied, giving a small smile and a quirk of her brow.
“Tony?” Steve asked, barely above a whisper.
Tony smiled.
“And what about all the money and fame that comes along with him? Are you just chasing after that?”
In that moment, Steve felt a strong kick on the left side of his belly that was enough to make him jump.
“Anything.”
“Did you see that?” Steve asked, trying to stay as still as possible, so as to not disturb Mason.
“That is actually what her feet looked like the day she was born. Size and everything. I brought the certificate with me when I went to get it done.”
“Fuck you, man. Tuesdays are the only day I get to come home and be a gross lazy slob. Don’t ruin that for me,” Carol spoke, plopping back down on the couch, and snuggling up under her blanket.
“Your feet would literally hang off the end unless you curled up in the world’s tightest fetal position” Tony observed.
“Well, I think you should let me handle Kyle. I know we want to help with his niece any way we can and to just let him know that he isn’t in trouble and we understand why he did what he did.” Pepper offered. “I’ll let you deal with nipping Ty in the bud. Make sure to let him know I say hi and that he can kindly fuck off.”
“Alright so I got a promotion at work today, and effective the first of next month, I’ll be the web dev manager.”
know is how much Ty had to pay you for this.”
“I’m no relationship expert, but I get the feeling that completely avoiding Steve isn’t the way to get him to take you back,” Bruce offered.
“Oh?”
“Firstly, you calling me Phil. I’m Coulson to you,” the older man answered.
“No, I’m messing this up.”
“Well we’d know that about him by now if you’d ever let us meet him,” Pepper chimed in.
He looked at the item for a moment before registering the redhead’s words. He moved to go after Steve, not really sure where he had gone or how to track him down. Thankfully, after twenty minutes of walking, Tony found Steve standing on an overpass. He walked over, covering the man with his umbrella. They stood there in silence, looking out at the city around them.
The ride to the party mostly consisted of Steve geeking out over the custom dark green ‘67 Camaro that Tony had driven. He wanted to impress the blond and the best way he could think to do that was with a flashy car, so sue him. He’d hoped that Steve would enjoy the ride, and as the man excitedly changed subjects from cars to motorcycles, Tony tried to internally process the afternoon they’d just had.
“Well, I told my friends about the baby, and may or may not have induced a panic attack in the process…”
“Okay, alright, here we go. Now, there’s four more to the first landing. Then make a left. Then there are seven steps and we’re gonna turn to the left again. One. Two.”
“Hey!” Steve greeted when he swung the door open. That was not the face of someone trying to call something off.
“Relax for me, baby,” Tony whispered; it was evident that every muscle in Steve’s body was tensed.
Steve smiled down at Tony, wracking his hands through his hair. “Is Naked Christmas the only way it’ll take to make you start loving this holiday?”
“Nothing, if you’re going there for the food as opposed to going there just to see your ex-boyfriend.”
far more than any grown man should ever admit, so don’t worry, we’ll be going back to standard operating procedures after this.”
Tony wanted to remember it all.
“Ow,” Steve hissed when he caught his finger. He put it in his mouth to ease the pain.
“I at least
Clint gave an indignant huff, before throwing an arm around Steve’s shoulder. “Don’t worry about him, he pretends to be a meany, but he’s really a big ol’ softy. Anyway, c’mon, let me show you our office!”
Steve couldn’t help but break out into a smile at the brunet’s response.
“--but we needed someone to go as Captain Planet, and I won’t sit here and pretend that I’m not excited to see what he looks like all dressed up. He’s hot, he’s just aggravating as all hell.”
“Oh really? What do they think?”
“I can probably help, what team is it?” Steve offered, praying he didn’t sound too overly eager.
The whole thing seemed so far fetched at the time. Steve sent over his resume, fully expecting for this to be a fruitless effort. To his surprise, though, he’d received a call for an interview not even a full two weeks later. Though he didn’t have much experience, they were able to offer him a teaching assistant position that would eventually lead to a teaching position. The hiring process had been such a whirlwind, he never really had the time to stop and think about how nervous he truly was to be
“Oh, haha, you’re a real comedian Steve,” Tony laughed, bumping shoulders with the blond.
“No, not really” Steve replied, neglecting to mention that he hadn’t made any plans thus far because he had intended to make plans later with Tony.
With that, Tony put his phone down and got to preparing the rest of dinner. He didn’t do it often, but the alpha absolutely loved making dinner for others. Something about it gave him a sense of happiness that he was never quite able to explain. Very few people were even aware of the fact that Tony knew his way around the kitchen, but those who did never passed up the chance to have some of his cooking.
“I’m sure Steve thinks as much, but is that all you want to be?” Pepper asked, concern lacing her face.
Tony was past the point of playing this game, especially with Steve. “Cut the bullshit,” he growled. “You show up out of nowhere, Mr. tall, blond and handsome, and practically charm your way into every part of my life. You become my assistant coach and all of a sudden this super advanced bot shows up. We lose to said super advanced bot and I get a text from Ty that he stole my tech. You're a common factor here, Steve. It doesn't take a genius to figure this out.”
“Merry Christmas to you too Steve.”
That was all the convincing Tony needed before he lunged forward to seize Steve in a searing  kiss. “I'm gunna make this so good for you,” Tony whispered between kisses.
“Sure did! I was always responsible for setting the table during holidays at home, so I’ve learned a thing or two about presentation. Anyway, take a seat, and I’ll get the food out.”
“Sounds like a plan. After you!”
“Do you think Tony’s cute too? Is that what this is about?”
“Really? I spend almost every day for the last two months going to lunch with you and you’ve decided to revert back to talking about the
“What if I make you dinner and give you wine,” Tony finally offered, knowing that would get him the answer he wanted.
“Oh honey, is this all for me?” Tony asked, running his hands through the slick.
Both Steve and Tony laughed as Cora continued, in great detail, to describe their family trip to the local farm and petting zoo. After ten solid minutes of her bantering, Steve finally had to interrupt.
“Then apologize!”
Steve turned to walk away and Tony was stunned. He figured he could just brush off the couch incident and that would be that. He had no idea Steve would fight so hard and fight for him, no less.
“Ok, good. I’m glad you understand where I’m coming from with this, because I contrary to how it may seem, I do like you. We’re going to be seeing a lot of each other from now on, so it’s best to get these kinds of things out of the way sooner rather than later. Anyway, now that that’s settled, I’ll get out of your hair.”
“Shitty, how about you?” Tony answered, making it clear that he wasn’t going to put any effort into faking happiness.
“Told ‘em this would probably happen,” he mumbled, attacking the skin behind Steve’s ear.
“I figured maybe we might need it at some point this evening.”
“Well...yeah. I didn’t want to tell you this way, but Coulson promoted me to manager of the graphic design team. I didn’t think it would be a good idea to be the boss of the father of my child, so I figured I’d quit.”
Ignoring the omega’s pleas, he bent over to get closer to Steve’s entrance, spreading him to get a good look before attempting to suck him dry. The gasp that fell from Steve’s lips was magnificent, and Tony wanted to hear nothing more but that amazing sound for the rest of the night. He used his tongue to dart in and out of the omega, making him squirm and cry out for release. Once he’d had his fill, Tony pulled off of Steve’s entrance with one final flick of his tongue, then ran a hand lightly up and down the blond’s back.
“You always tried so hard to figure out what you were feeling. Please just do us both a favor and be honest with me.”
“Don’t start rumors Clint.”
“Steve you’re the best man for this job. I know you two didn’t quite get along in the beginning, but you’re friends now. I know how much you care about him and you’re the only one who won’t run when he tries to push you away.”
Once he put Cora to sleep, Steve planned to just lay on the couch and watch some of his favorite shows. Halfway into an episode of
“I uh…” Bruce started, “it’s been kind of hectic getting my bearings at this new hospital. I’ve been on call a lot lately and helping with a lot of deliveries so I haven’t had much free time.”
“He wasn’t actually dead, relax,” Tony huffed, “he was just sitting there with his eyes closed and not moving. So I knocked on the window to ask if he was okay and he said he was just collecting himself before getting the day started. Do you know what that means?!”
"Well hello Mr. Tall, blond and sexy! How was your weekend?"
The brunet awoke to realize he had been humping the bed and whispering Steve’s name while he had been dreaming. He felt a cool pool of cum inside his boxers, once he brought his hips to a stop. Tony cursed himself, embarrassed that he’d had a wet dream like he was a god damned fourteen year old. He couldn’t even look himself in the bathroom mirror as he wet a towel to clean himself off.
“You think you can distance yourself from me, from my name, from my legacy? You think you could do so much better without me? Let me tell you, Anthony, you’ve never been more wrong in your life,” Howard spoke, in an angry whisper, “You’re a failure as a son, and you’ll be an even bigger failure as a father. You’ll never be worth anything to your baby or the whore of an omega you’ve knocked up. I can promise you that just like you’ve done in every other relationship you’ve ever had, all you’ll do is bring them disappointment. That’s the only thing you excel at.”
Sarah rolled her eyes, but smiled at  her son anyway.
“Well, tell me a little bit more about your feelings for Steve. I need to fully understand the situation we’re dealing with here.”
“So, what are you doing up here all alone, Cap?” Tony asked, turning to lean on the deck railing, resting his elbows atop the wooden surface.
Steve silently followed as Fury took him around the school, pointing out areas like the cafeteria and the auditorium, making a stop at the teacher’s lounge. “This is where our laziest employees hide to avoid doing any real work,” Fury said, standing in the open doorway.
Steve all but whispered.
"So Tony, tell us a little bit about yourself," Sam said, pulling up a chair.
“Nice to see you again, Stark,” Bucky greeted, taking Steve’s spot and extending his metal hand to shake.
“I can’t believe that geriatric unitard wearing capsicle had the nerve to say that to me!”
. Well, it’s called the piano version. It’s on the 2009 Platinum version of her Fearless album.”
“I let you go out there to work at that measly creative firm, walking around as if you aren’t the son of one of the most important men in America. I gave you the chance to get all of this foolishness out of your system before having to take over my company. I let you make an absolute ass of yourself time and time again, and this...this is how you repay me? It is one thing for you to knock up some omega, but it’s another thing entirely for you to be with a man. There is absolutely no way that any son of mine will be gay.”
“What?” he asked, confused.
Some part of Tony wanted to fight her on this. He wasn’t sure why, but he didn’t like the thought of his friend not supporting the relationship he most definitely wasn’t aiming for with Steve. However, he knew that Pepper was only looking out for his best interest and he couldn’t fault her for that.
Tony gave a sheepish nod before looking down at his hands clasped in his lap.
“Huh?”
They looked through the selection of vibrators, and Steve felt that he was in some perverted version of Goldie Locks. They weren’t looking for anything too big or too small, but something just right. That thought made the man’s face burn even more as they continued looking. It only took a bit longer for them to come upon a red and gold vibrator that looked to be the most favorable. After placing it in their basket, Natasha selected a handful of lubes and threw them in as well. Steve followed her to the register, practically hiding behind her during the entire transaction. Once they made their way to the car, he felt like he could finally breath.
The second Steve sat inside his car, a laugh ripped it’s way out of him. He sat in the garage, laughing for close to five solid minutes before turning the car on to head home. He felt light enough to float at this point. A huge weight had been lifted off his shoulders and his mother’s words were enough to erase any doubt that he had. He knew now what he needed to do.
not as a Stark and…”
“We’ve got two more meets before our final meet for the season. I’ll ask him on a date then, okay?” Steve stated. He watched as his friends exchanged glances, finally agreeing that they were pleased with his plan.
“Yes, I’m sure! I’m not some dainty little thing that needs to be constantly fussed over. I am perfectly capable of managing without you guys,” Steve snapped.
“A date with me.” Tony winked and flashed his best smile as Steve looked him over. All Steve could do was let out a small laugh before shaking his head.
“Wouldn’t want you to forget this. Try it out and let me know how it goes,” Natasha said with a smile.
“Steve’s gonna have fun with that one,” Sam added, just before Steve and Tony were out of earshot.
“Yeah, kid. I’m Tony.”
The way Steve looked when Tony mentioned that he wanted to ride him.
“Really? I was going to say it hasn’t been long enough,” Tony quipped.
Steve was an absolute mess. He knew it, but he hoped no one else had picked up on his embarrassing school boy crush. He tried, he really really did, to rein it in whenever they were with friends. The looks of adoration and wonder he’d cast, just listening to the brunet talk, were sure to get him in some kind of trouble if he didn’t cool it. He tried to keep the daydreams to a minimum while working on the seemingly endless amounts of paperwork from Clint. He thought he’d been doing a fine enough job until Bucky brought it up.
“Gotcha.” Steve took a deep breath. “Come. Sit. Talk.”
“Tony, no. I’m extremely busy right now. This will have to wait,” Pepper replied, not once taking her eyes off her work.
“This isn’t exactly what I had in mind when I asked you to come out with the team.”
"Jesus, Stark, are you high?" Bucky asked, taken aback by Tony's behavior. Tony just raised an eyebrow and crossed his heart in a huff. "No, Barnes, it's just the first time I've ever actually been happy to see you. Now help me!"
“Were you watching me sleep?” Steve questioned, voice thick with early morning drowsiness.
“You and Natasha,” Steve began, shaking his head,”what I just told you was what I was worried about telling you!”
Tony couldn’t help the ear to ear grin that spread on his face at that. “Well,” he spoke, taking Steve’s hand in his own, “who could say no to an invitation like that?”
“Listen man, you’ve got this! We all care about you and want nothing but the best for you. If Tony is anything like how you’ve described, then I know he’ll do fine tonight, ok? So just relax a little, because you’re so tense right now that your shoulders are practically up to your ears, and that’s not a cute look.”
“Well how about you give it back now, since that's clearly where you've decided we're going…” Bruce suggested, none too pleased to be sitting in the Olive Garden parking lot. Tony just looked at him, exasperated.
“Not to be rude Jarvis, but I know I need to give him a reason to leave the workshop. I just don’t know what that reason should be.”
“Yeah, that means I’m gonna keep it!”
“That’s enough!” Natasha screamed, “You’re both being absolutely ridiculous.”
“Are you
“Welcome to Olive Garden, can I start off by getting you anything to drink?” Steve asked in his cheeriest voice. The patron mumbled his answer without so much as lifting his head. Steve just rolled his eyes and tried again.
"Nope, nuh-uh. It is not
Steve let out a breath he hadn’t known he was holding but gave a small smile at that.
Tony was laughing so hard that his sides hurt. He had tears coming out of his eyes, and he was gasping for breath. He wanted to stop laughing, he really truly did, but every time he thought he had himself under control, he’d catch a glimpse of Steve and lose it all over again. This went on for a good ten minutes before the brunet was truly able to compose himself. When he did, he took a deep breath, with a smile on his face.
died on his tongue when Steve got a text and quickly excused himself, apologizing over and over.
Once they pulled away, Sarah tilted her head towards the door.
Tony let out a humorless laugh. “I didn’t. I just looked up some stuff online. When I started dating you I wanted to get clean and it was hard at first, but we weren’t serious enough for me to put that on you, so I didn’t.”
Over the past few days, Tony had put out feelers to see if there was even a point in trying to win Steve back. He began stopping in the teacher’s lounge for a few minutes at a time when he knew the blond was likely to be there. On the first day, Steve had greeted him and asked how his day had gone. The following day, Steve mentioned a documentary on black holes he’d seen that he thought Tony might like. On day three, Steve asked a question about his ‘67 Camaro while chatting with Clint and Thor, which led to all four of them laughing and joking about their first cars. It felt like old times again, but more than that, it felt like Steve was letting him in again, little by little. It was that knowledge that gave him the courage to go through with Operation Robot Hearts.
Tony waited patiently until Steve finished his rant. “You done now?”
“Why such harsh words, Tony? We parted on such good terms the last time we spoke.”
Tony tossed the idea around in his head. He knew that Steve would also be chaperoning the dance, and figured that this would be a last ditch effort. If this didn’t work, he’d leave Steve alone, for good.
“Well I figure I’ll stick to the lighter stuff until I actually have to start spending time around any kids,” the man replied.
“Is it the Avengers? Iron Man? I mean, what do I need to do to fix whatever it is that I’ve broken?”
“It’s that bad, huh?” Tony asked, not entirely sure he actually wanted the answer.
“Come in,” he said without looking up.
“Glad we got to meet your favorite guy.”
“Well, I got to thinking about what we talked about earlier, about you and Tony. I want to help you figure out whether or not this is something you truly want.”
“Maybe a widdle.”
“You cold?” Tony asked, giving the blond a once over.
“Dis one’s mine!” She’d ripped the wrapping paper off before Tony could even touch it. “It’s us, see! Dere’s daddy an’ you an’ me,” she pointed to each of the blobs in turn. “I’m in da middle because I wan’ed to hold yer hand but I wan’ed ta hold daddy’s hand, too,” she explained.
“Coraline here yet?” Tony asked. When Steve said no, he had to fight the urge to say
Tony waved his hand to stop the impending congratulations he knew was coming from his friend after that.
“There was a scheduling mix up at the library so I have to go into work. Peggy’s working at the hospital until seven tonight, so she can’t get Cora early. Is there any way you can come watch her for me?”
“Nothing.”
Tony was angry, that much was clear. He was breathing heavily, and his grip had tightened around Steve’s arms. It was all too much and yet not enough. Steve wanted more, he
Steve watched as the man walked away, letting out a breath he hadn’t known he had been holding once he was alone again.
Tony seemed to consider Steve’s suggestions before giving a small smile. “Let’s play it by ear once we get there and see where the afternoon takes us.”
Steve sat on the school bus with the rest of the team, heart racing as they got closer to their destination.
At this point, Tony felt like he was going to burn a hole in the spot on the table he had taken to staring at. There was no way he could continue his story and look his friends in the eye.
“Alright, is everyone done with what they’ve been working on?” Steve asked, a couples hours after getting started. He looked up to notice that all three of them were nodding. “Well then, when Cora gets here, we’ll all try on our costumes!”
“Correction,” Tony began, with his pointer finger up, “the first time we met, I thought you were dead in your car. But we did formally meet at a happy hour. I always attend them because I like the company.”
be having this talk while you try not to die,” Sam muttered, miraculously pulling out another plate of food and Gatorade for the brunet. “Anyway, we wanted to talk to you, Steve—”
The brunet turned to see Steve standing behind him, looking puzzled, with Coraline at his feet.
“Dada m’hungy,” Coraline chirped, throwing her hands up. Steve just smiled down at her before putting her back on the floor and standing to make her a snack.
He resumed his position on the floor, kneeling on a couch pillow. Steve’s eyes were growing darker as he watched Tony slowly undo the zipper in front of him. They worked together to remove Steve’s pants and boxers. Once his cock was free, Steve let out a sigh of relief that gave way to a choked off groan as Tony swallowed him whole. He gave the blond less than a second to adjust to the feeling around him before beginning to move. Steve’s hand scrambled for purchase, landing at the back of Tony’s head. He tangled his fingers in the hair beneath them, and let out a moan that went straight to Tony's dick.
Tony wrote as he seasoned the steaks. It was a few minutes before his phone chirped in response.
“I mean, you’d definitely bring in business standing out there, but I figure you’d enjoy yourself more on the inside of the building,” Tony teased. “I could be wrong though, I have heard people say they’d rather stare at a brick wall than spend time with me so—”
“Yeah, but then I also consider how crazy my boyfriend is, and then I realize that I don’t really mind so much.”
“Do you not understand that literally no one other than you, me, Rhodey, Pepper and Happy have ever attended this? It’s a very exclusive event, not just anyone gets invited.”
“This is tooth rottingly sweet, Steve. I don’t know if I’m about to shed a tear because it’s so adorable or puke from the stomach ache this much sugary sweetness would inevitably cause,” Clint said, seemingly about to flip a page, but thinking better of it and closing the notebook altogether. “Either way, you should probably tell him how you feel and stop being such a fraidy cat.”
Steve tried to nod, but felt the resistance as Tony’s hand pulled his hair, just enough to barely hurt. “Yes, fuck Tony, yes!”
“Alright well mama’s gotta go, noodle, but be good for your daddy okay? I love you,” Peggy said, blowing a kiss at the screen. Cora tried mimicking the gesture, before waving.
“I...no,” Tony answered, unconvincingly. “Though I can see how one might think that. I really was spending that entire time dealing with Ty. Thanks again for your help with that.” Tony picked up a few papers from his desk just to have something to shuffle through, hoping that he could delay this conversation.
“Where’s the event that I should enact this grand gesture?” Tony asked, annoyed with himself for even entertaining this.
“I can’t believe you did all of this just for me,” Tony marveled, taking a seat at the table. His mouth was watering at the smell of the food in front of him.
Steve nervously chuckled and let go of Tony’s face. “Yeah, thanks for the headsup.”
“Sowwie, Ony.”
“Yep,” Steve uttered around a mouthful of lo mein noodles.
“For god’s sake Tony, you didn’t do anything! It’s just…there’s someone else.”
“You don’t make time for her?”
“Oh it was...it went well, nothing big. What’s in the bag?” Steve asked, trying to change the subject.
Bucky just rolled his eyes and smiled. “I feel like you’re looking for an excuse to tweak it even more, but I promise you guys built one hell of a prosthetic.”
“So, that was Steve, huh?” Pepper asked, with a smile.
Tony just took Steve’s face in his hands and pulled him in for a deep kiss.
The two of them sat there in silence for quite a while. It took a bit for the words to sink in but the second Tony understood what Pepper was saying, he began to panic.
Tony wanted to say he didn't mind them, he actually enjoyed a lot of the little glass figurines, but once the towels, mugs, and stuffed animals made an appearance, he felt a small bout of annoyance followed by guilt. Here he was, thinking of how he didn't want such questionable turtle decor clogging up their home, when all Steve was doing was honoring Tony’s wish and bringing things that made him happy into their space. Tony resigned himself to the idea that he was more than willing to spend the rest of his life learning to love all the insane turtles that crossed the threshold of their home, because that’s what made Steve happy.
you babe, I would never laugh at you after saying such beautiful words,” Steve assured, slipping the ring onto his ring finger. “I'm laughing because...the turtles are me being a little shit. They have been this whole time.”
“Steve? What are you doing here, it’s not Sunday,” Sarah stated, moving out of the way to let her son in.
“Let me help you,” Steve said, getting on the floor across from Tony. “I’m gonna put my foot in your lap and you’re gonna pull from the bottom, alright?” Steve instructed, situating himself.
“You’re going to Bucky and Nat’s party?” Steve asked, hopeful that this wasn’t some kind of coincidence.
Sure enough, no more than ten minutes later, Tony was practically moaning as he took bite after bite of a hearty slice of avocado toast with mozzarella, tomato, basil and balsamic on it.
The pair of them stood there, in silence, letting the weight of Steve’s words settle on them.
, is you. I don't give a fuck what the google does or doesn't say and I don't care what people on this campus think. I love Tony. Cora loves Tony... hell even Peggy loves Tony! That's all that matters."
Steve turned to look at Bucky, confused, and the brunet shrugged. “I figured I could keep you company this weekend,” he offered. As soon as Steve opened his mouth to object, Bucky put up a hand to stop him. “I’m not asking if I can, I’m
“Yeah you’re right, it doesn’t matter anyway because nothing is going to happen between us.”
“You’re trying to combine a date with an apology?” Steve asked, with a smirk and raised eyebrow.
,” Steve moaned, lifting his free hand to brace it on the blanket above his head. The move gave him the leverage to take Tony deeper. At this angle, Tony realized he was able to hit Steve’s prostate dead on. Though he was close, he knew it wouldn't take long for Steve to come like this as long as he kept up the dirty talk. So Tony did just that.
Tony raised a hand to give a thumbs up, before grunting his approval to let Happy in.
The second he heard them pull into the drive through, Steve moved as quickly as he could, stopping to give Tony a kiss at the top of his head before leaving the house. As he walked to the car, excitement and happiness bubbling inside of him, Steve thought to himself that he knows now, for sure, that Tony is it. The alpha feels like home to him, and he never wanted to let that feeling go.
Tony stood beside his friend Bruce as he paid for his lunch. Once they finally found a table at the on campus deli, Tony responded to the question with a shrug.
"What?" Tony asked, confused.
Tony felt a rage bubbling inside him at that point.
“Ok, well I just wanted to know if you were free to get lunch today. There’s a new Thai place close by and I figured maybe you’d like to try it with me.”
“Fuck you, that’s who,” Steve answered with a smile.
“Well, I still find your daughter adorable.”
After a few moments of silence, Steve became a little worried.
The blond snapped out of it the second he felt his phone buzz again.
“No, I will be staying at my boyfriend’s apartment.”
Tony saw the way Steve’s eyes softened at the invitation. “Yeah I...I think I’d like that,” the blond replied, softly. The three of them left the classroom, heading for the parking lot.
“Thanks for sharing that with me,” Tony said, leaning back into his arm chair, and finally allowing himself to relax.
“Honey, I absolutely
Cora trailed Tony out into the hallway where he gathered up the craft items he’d brought up.
He couldn’t believe that after all of his hard work, Vision had decided that he was worthy of a promotion. And while he was endlessly grateful for this opportunity, he couldn’t help feeling bad about what this meant for Tony. Realizing that it would be best not to ask, Steve stood, thanked Coulson once more, and left. Seconds after getting to his desk, Tony peaked his head around the walls of Steve’s cube.
Tony managed to sit there for the rest of the night, not even realizing that he’d sat there and talked to Steve until midnight.
“Is that...Steve is that all? That’s really nothing for you to be worried about,” Natasha offered, hoping to calm the blond.
“Ugh, you guys are the fucking worst,” Tony said, walking away from the table to order a drink at the bar. As he stood there waiting for his soda water with lime, Tony saw someone come up beside him out of the corner of his eye.
Tony looked at his phone, finally, to notice that not only did he not have any new messages but it was already 8 pm. Standing there with all of his friends watching him closely, looking down at that gift box that held a brand new bottle of his shampoo for Steve, Tony gave a slightly defeated sigh then smiled weakly.
“So, how’s everything been since I was last here?” Steve asked.
“Yeah. Even after.”
“Where were they coming from, then?”
“God, she’s going to grow up to be an absolute badass with them around. With all of our friends around.”
“You...you bring an entire lunch with you for Tony every day
"Just make sure you bring us back an awesome souvenir and we'll be fine!" Steve responded, giving a content hum at the feel of the alpha's lips.
“Hold on a minute, that’s not what happened. Just let me come in and explain--”
Tony cracked his knuckles, looking at his hands as he did so. “So, uh, I haven’t been one hundred percent honest about who I am. I mean, I haven’t really lied at all, but I haven’t told the whole truth. So, uh, how much do you know about weapons manufacturing?”
“Truthfully, Tony, I just wanted the code to work off of so Viastone could sell AI as a service to the military. But I couldn’t pass up an opportunity to fuck with you a little, so here we are!”
It was all over almost as quickly as it began. Once the last few notes of the song sounded, Steve slowly took back his hand and took a step back. “I need some air,” he stammered, before quickly leaving the gym.
He’d been working at Slice Magazine for a few years now, happily creating illustrations that helped give the lifestyle magazine some excitement and personality. Steve was beyond grateful to have a job where he not only got to do what he loved, but also got to work alongside his best friend, Bucky. He was more than happy with what he did for a living, but somewhere along the way, as his mother’s health began to decline, the bills started piling up. He thought that taking a few freelance jobs here and there would be enough, but Steve quickly learned that wasn’t the case.
“I’m just thinking about how badly I wish you’d say your legs were tired, so you could take me up on that whole riding me offer,” Steve said, not once taking his eyes off the animals floating around before him. Tony swallowed, hard, as an idea popped into his head.
Tony’s face twisted at that. The last thing he wanted was company.
He wondered, suddenly realizing that they would have knocked before trying to come in. Before he could make a move, the door flung open.
“Ok, sorry man. We didn’t mean anything by it. Just wanted to make sure you’re alright,” Sam said, taking a seat next to Steve.
As he sat in front of one of his favorite piece from the new Degas exhibit, he heard someone walk up behind him.
“I just...the only thing I can think of that I did was saying our dinner could be a date, and I figured maybe that made you uncomfortable and I’m sorry. We can stay friends if that’s what you want if it means you’ll come back to Vision.”
“Thank you Jarvis…For everything.”
“You fainted. I told you I’m pregnant, and you fainted.”
Tony knew this was only going to work if he got Cora’s approval, and he wanted nothing more than to get it. Not just because he wanted to date Steve, but because he… there weren’t really words for what he felt for Cora. He’d only met her twice--that first day and their brief conversation earlier--but he wanted to do good by her and her father. Though he barely knew her, he wanted her in his life. He knew he could work his way into Steve’s heart easily, the fact that he’d even gotten a date out of the man was proof enough of that. But to get an almost two-year-old to like him was another challenge entirely.
“Definitely,” Steve answered, giving a chuckle that was more nervous than anything else. Thankfully, Tony didn’t seem to notice.
The blond just laughed, but tried to stay as still as possible to give Bucky the best chance of feeling the baby. It was in moments like this, where it felt like nothing in life could get any better, that Steve felt thankful for everything that led him here. More specifically, he felt thankful for everything that led him to the man he knew was meant to be his bond mate.
Tony made his way into work feeling confused and slightly saddened. He thought things had ended well after he’d texted Steve about their dinner date, but he hadn’t heard from the omega since. He wanted to think that everything was fine, but when his texts the night before went unanswered, Tony began to doubt himself. Maybe Steve had second thoughts about wanting to have him over for dinner. Maybe he realized that even a friendship with Tony was a mistake. Thought after horrible thought popped into the alpha’s mind, making him wonder where exactly he went wrong.
“So I guess I’ll just drop you back off at your place then, huh?” Tony asked, once they got to the car. Steve just looked at him nervously.
Tony tried to sit there as silently as possible while the families answered obscure questions, but it was only a matter of minutes before he was yelling at the TV.
“So?” Clint asked almost as soon as the last customer had walked out.
“And I heard that you stopped using your potty.”
“What the actual fuck Stark?” Rhodey asked around a laugh.
Tony looked at Steve, standing there expectant and hopeful. It made Tony’s blood boil.
“You broke Tony in a way I’ve never seen before. He was completely and utterly miserable when you weren’t together. He went through days where he wouldn’t even get out of bed, he was so crippled by the fear that he had lost you and Cora forever. It might not have seemed like much, but he poured everything he had into his relationship with you, and you just tossed it all away.”
There was an immediate look of horror plastered on Steve’s face.
************
“So you left the bar just to check on lil ol’ me?”
what she looks like, in case you were wondering
“What’s that look for?” Steve asked cutting into his omelette.
It sounded as though Tony was talking through tears, but there was no way to tell.
Steve stood and smiled wide at the women in front of him.
“Honestly, Cap, it’s perfectly fine,” he offered before turning on his heels and walking off in their original direction.
“Yeah, ok, whatever. Bye,” Steve said, shutting the door in her face.
“Not ta,” she mumbled.
“Alright, well I guess I should be heading out now then. Get some rest you two, and I’ll see you both tomorrow.”
Without hesitation, almost everyone turned to punch him in either one of his arms.
“Steve, shh, it’s okay. I love you, too.”
“I can definitely keep what I’ve found under wraps but you can’t really just uninstall JARVIS. We have no real reason to go through any of Viastone’s servers from here on out but just remember that all the company’s sensitive information lives in my AI’s brain now so...that’d be another great reason not to piss me off, lest I tell your board about that huge fuck up on your part, as well.”
“Yours.”
Tony just smiled as he lifted his coffee cup to take a sip. “You guys seem to have a lot of hunches lately. You better hope they’re right.”
Steve shook his head. “That always get’s really loud and Cora’s already down for the night.”
“Not a problem, Steve my dearest.” Tony kissed Steve on his cheek.
Every moment that passed felt like an eternity as Steve tried to keep the tears away. He kept reminding himself that they weren’t too far and once they got to his apartment, he could let everything all out. Holding on for that long felt almost impossible but the second they got to his building, up the elevator and inside his apartment, he fell to the floor, finally able to let go.
“Alrighty, here we are,” Steve said, pulling up to the drop-off area at the airport. When he found out how early Tony’s flight was, he’d offered to give him a ride. This was the first time since they’d started dating that they’d be spending such a long amount of time apart. Steve would be lying if he said not having Tony with him for Christmas didn't hurt, but he held on to the hope that they’d get to spend New Years Eve together just as they’d planned.
Tony gave Steve the address for the burger joint that had become his and Peter’s regular spot on days like this. As they made their way, with Steve following behind in his car, Tony smiled to himself, thinking that maybe Peter was right. Perhaps Tony and Steve would make a great pair.
“Oh...yeah. So, I was minding my business in the parking lot, when I saw this gorgeous hunk of sexiness dead in his car.”
The man that sat across from him was an older, dark skinned man with an eyepatch covering his right eye. Steve had been around his fair share of intimidating men while in the Army, but somehow none of them came close to being as terrifying as this man before him.
“Then why did you throw that cake at your daddy?”
“Alright, as long as you promise that everything is alright, I guess I’ll back off.”
“Look, I just left Steve’s and I wanted to see if you were busy.”
“Sorry, one second,” he said, turning away to answer the phone.
With that thought on his mind, Steve turned his head to the side. “I want...I want you to fuck me. I need your cock inside me, Tony,” Steve uttered, breathlessly. He felt Tony withdraw his fingers, and muffled a disappointed sound.
“I’m tired of playing house with you. Day in and day out, I’ve been pretending like this was all a life that was ever meant for me and it wasn’t! I wasn’t lying when I told you that you wouldn’t have to raise this baby alone, but the rest of it, all this domestic shit, pretending as though we’re some kind of old married couple who’d planned for all of this...I can’t. You deserve to bond with someone who can love you, and take care of you far better than I ever could.”
“Workshop?” Steve asked, confused.
“Steve, just the man we were looking for,” Clint said, practically skipping into the room.
At that statement, Steve’s eyes grew wide with realization.
“And you went potty like a big girl?”
Tony had a phenomenal job as the CEO of a company on the cutting edge of groundbreaking technology and he was
As he rounded the couch, Steve noticed that Pepper had tucked her legs up onto the couch. The fact that she took his invitation to make herself at home to heart put a smile on his face. “Here ya go,” he said offering up the water. “I hope bottled water is fine.”
Tony nodded his head furiously, waiting for her to see what he was getting at. When she didn’t, he just threw his hands up in defeat.
Carol rolled her eyes before taking a bite of one of the small potatoes on her plate.
It had been a full month since Steve had taken the job at the Olive Garden. He struggled a bit in the beginning, but quickly made friends with a few other waiters who were more than willing to help him out.
“Alright, hold on tight, Cora!”
Happy cleared his throat before responding.
“Yeah, you’re right, I’m gunna kick ass and take names tonight!”
“Yeah, you mean the biggest government contracting manufacturer in the country? What about them?” Steve asked, making sure to give Tony his absolute full attention.
“Nice to meet you, Rogers, is it?” the man asked, opening a folder that looked to contain Steve’s information. “My name is Nicholas Fury, but you can just call me Principal or Fury; either will do. So, our Russian teacher Natasha highly recommended you for this position, despite your lack of experience,” Fury stated.
“What is this?! It’s amazing!” Tony exclaimed, finally looking up to see the man who made his drink.
“Hm, okay. Well, as your assistant coach, I look forward to getting a chance to meet them,” Steve said teasingly, turning back to face forward, still wearing that smirk.
“Uh, okay then,” Sam cleared his throat.
“What do we do now?” Tony asked, once they’d finished going through everything.
Tony smiled down at his hand before taking it. “Oh, I know,” was all he said before turning to lead the way. Steve followed him into the elevator and stood quietly as Tony reached for the garage button.
“Honestly, I have no fucking clue. Tony just went nuts, started yelling about this Tiberius guy and accusing me of being paid to try to get in his pants.”
“Yeah, sure.”
Tony couldn’t believe that someone so young could be such an amazing father. Just looking at Steve and Coraline together, he could see the absolute love and adoration the two of them had for one another.
And with that, Tony resolved to make his way to Steve’s house...once he figured out where exactly that was. He did some digging online, losing some of his buzz in the process. Though he was able to think a little clearer, he was still just as intent on making this trip.
“Okay!” she screeched, vaulting off of Steve’s lap towards the door. “Whosit?”
“Oh, I wanted to see if you wanted to get lunch. I figured if you had all this money to throw away at a bar then you’d have no problem taking me out for a nice meal!”
“It’s beautiful,” Tony whispered, still in awe. “It’s… I don’t even know what this is.”
“Pudding cup?”
After a night out at Bucky and Natasha’s apartment, while telling his oldest friends about his troubles, Natasha offered to help.
The following Saturday, Tony picked Steve up for an afternoon spent at the local natural history museum followed by a late lunch. As they sat down to eat together, Steve couldn’t stop smiling from ear to ear.
When he looked at the screen, all he saw was a picture of handwriting.
“No problem,” Tony moved to pat the spot on the floor beside him. “It’s what any upstanding citizen would do.”
“I promise that I will stay here with you and daddy as long as you will both let me.”
“I have to take this, honey,” Tony said, gently easing himself out from under Steve.
After finding out about the AI being used, Tony started doing some digging. It wasn’t as easy as he’d have liked to get his hands on video footage of their meets without raising any alarms that something was wrong. Once they’d made it to the second to last meet and ended up doing well enough to place as one of four teams competing at finals, though, Tony was able to mask his request for the footage. As soon as he said they needed it to study and assess their previous meets to strategize for finals, the robotics league was more than happy to turn over what they had. By the time finals had arrived, Tony had been able to parse through enough footage to realize that the DeWitt Clinton High School team had been using general intelligence, but had only implemented it in a single bot. Moreover, they would only ever use that bot sparingly; never as a primary player on the field, just kind of...there almost as if for show only. None of it made sense, but luckily Tony was able to get a closer look because the DeWitt team had made it to finals as well.
“How’s Mason doing?”
“Tony, I...that is so kind of you to invite me, but really you don’t have--”
Tony sprang forward to wrap his arms around the man in front of him in a hug. The positioning was awkward, given the fact that Steve was sitting, but Tony didn’t care.
Steve took another look at the couch, deflating a bit at the realization. Tony gave a soft chuckle at that and smiled. “Just share the bed with me, Steve, it’s fine.”
Steve  suddenly heard a ping coming from his phone. He ignored it, as not to be rude.
“What do I do, Nat? How do I come back from this?” Tony asked, truly realizing how horrible this situation was.
Later that night, once everyone made Bucky apologize at least five times, Steve and Tony found themselves laying on the couch, finally alone.
“Look at you, staying here in my house, making my favorite food, wearing my favorite sweater. You’re desperate for the world to know who you belong to. When I'm done fucking you so hard that you can't walk straight, people are going to know that this ass,” Tony said grabbing Steve’s cheek for emphasis, “belongs to me, and it's
It only took a few more minutes of walking for them to reach the restaurant. Tony opened the door for Steve, and gestured for him to go ahead. The blond gave a nod of thanks before walking in. Once they were seated, the pair of them sat quietly looking over the menu.
for trying to help--”
“Sorry I...sorry,” Steve stammared, “I just wanted to make sure I got here before you left so I could apologize for missing lunch today.”
“Jesus fucking
“Cheating on you?”
Tony shook his head, smiling as he leaned in to kiss the man who'd given him
. I’m not going to leave you here by yourself. Now shut up, buckle up, and let me help you.”
“In very small doses, yes,” Rhodey agreed before turning his attention to Steve. “Nice to meet you…” he paused, waiting for Steve’s official ranking, as he extended his hand for a shake.
“Please don’t do this.”
and you’re bringing me back to my
“What?” He asked, not actually certain he had heard correctly.
They sat there, quietly for a moment, both contemplating Steve’s question.
Bucky nodded. “Good, good. Knows the value of information,” he muttered, half to himself, half to prove that he ‘knew what he was doing’ to the rest of the group. “How old were you when you lost your virginity and to who?”
“Out.
“I don’t know how many times I have to keep telling you, Brucie, but I’m going to need your help finding my mystery man,” Tony said, exasperated.
“Do you ever just sit and think how crazy your daughter is?” Tony asked, around a laugh.
, about getting your hands on my AI code, you asshole. Don’t pretend that you have no clue what we’re here for.”
like you are!” Steve answered, finally losing his patience. Once he saw the hurt look on Tony’s face, he pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Are ya gonna leave ‘gain.”
Peter looked at Tony suspiciously, narrowing his eyes. He then turned to make sure no one was at the door before speaking again. “Mr. Stark, with all due respect, I’ve seen you try to charm Aunt May —”
“Tony,” he said as he took the hand and shook, “come on over to the table and I’ll introduce you to the rest of the group.”
“So all I have to say is ‘I’m sorry for the way I’ve treated you’?”
The genuine look of confusion on Ty’s face gave way to one of understanding after a moment. “Is Steve that buff blond you've been hanging around? You think I hired him to…” Ty suddenly burst into laughter before he could finish his thought.
“Listen, you’re going to be here for a whole two weeks. I would much rather you hold off on being an insufferable brat at least until closer to the end of your trip.”
He wanted to tell Steve that he was wrong, that he’d never hurt Mason like this, but truth be told he didn’t even believe that right now. The second he stepped out of the apartment, the door slammed behind him. He held his head high as he walked to the elevator, waited in the lobby, and rode home in a cab. The second he locked the door to his house, though, he crumpled to the floor and let out a sob as he cried in earnest, reminding himself over and over again that no matter how much this hurt, he did the right thing.
Tony ran through what the woman had said, as she gingerly handed the sleeping girl off to Steve. The child, more of a baby really, had the same dark brown curls as her mother.
“Let me guess, you’re talking to Steve.” Rhodey said as he sat across from the man.
“I always love throwing these types of parties, mainly because it’s so nice having the house full of people, but it’s a lot to deal with.”
“Master has been very sorrowful for the past few weeks, yet he hasn’t truly dealt with those feelings. Perhaps you should give him the chance to drown his sorrows in a place where he will still be safe.”
“What can I do for you today, Hap?”
“Well...this isn’t what I was expecting,” Tony began, giving a nervous laugh as he rubbed the back of his neck.
“Not necessarily. You see after he kissed me, I kissed him back…”
“Jarvis can start a fire? I’ve been building them myself since I got here,” Steve said around a disbelieving laugh. Tony just shook his head and chuckled as he laid the pillow down and dropped to his knees.
It took everything he had not to throw up the second he took the soiled diaper in hand. Once he finally made it to the trashcan, Tony silently gave himself a pat on the back for a job well done.
“I want… I want to try bottoming.”
“Listen, Peter, I’m sorry you all saw that,” Steve began. “Mr. Stark and I definitely were not arguing because of the meet. You all did your absolute best; we know that and we are so proud of each and every one of you. Mr. Stark and I will sort things out, so you and the rest of the team don’t have anything to worry about.”
Tony walked out of the office, leaving Steve all alone. He chewed his bottom lip wondering if he’d done the right thing, but Steve knew if he had any hope of getting over this, he needed to let Tony go. He looked down at Sprocket, now having another item to add to the list of things that evoked that feeling of sad happiness. He placed the bot on his desk and sighed, walking out of the office to get the gym ready for the day.
Natasha pulled Tony out of his seat, linking arms with him. “How’d you know he’s tall,” Tony asked.
"Okay, so I like to have fun, so what? I'm a freshman in college, of course I'm gonna go all out the first few times I go out. But I'd like it to be noted that I haven't been to a single party since I started dating Steve," Tony answered, proud of himself for keeping his composure.
?” Steve asked, barely above a whisper.
“I just can't believe how well you and Steve got along, I mean I can since I'm a man of discerning taste and I wouldn't befriend or try to date just anyone. But also did you see how much of a smoke show that man is?! He almost exclusively wears shirts that aren't even sort of in the realm of an acceptable size. But how does one even attempt to produce a garment capable of containing those muscles? And you saw how wonderfully he did as the assistant coach; helping the kids sort out the best course of action during each round. He’s great with the team and Peter thinks the world of him and I’m just happy that my favorite people all get along,” Tony blurted out in one breath.
Tony sat there, a cross between dumbfounded and a little insulted. “What do you mean? We won a significant amount of matches last year.”
