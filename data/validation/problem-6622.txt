Peter had been back for 15 minutes now. He hadn’t said a word, just lay curled up in the corner of his cell. The kid had his palms clasped over his ears, brandishing his nailless fingers (they had all winced and Sam even gagged). Blood stained the sides of his face, his nose down to his chin and all over his neck. His breathing was ragged and strained.
Rhodes was constantly away on military business. Natasha was around but it wasn't the same after her actions at the airport that Tony still hasn't properly forgiven her for. He should, but at the time he had felt so betrayed. He missed Steve the most. Tony was sure something had been blossoming between them and then the accords had come along and everything was ruined.
“Hey, Stark, c’mere. I need to talk to you.” Natasha beckoned Tony over. Tony eyed her suspiciously but followed her over to the kitchen area. “Look, I know what you’re going to say but just listen, okay? Ross is going to pass his trial. The defence are twisting all the evidence. Peter needs to make a statement in court. You need to talk to him about it and there’s the issue with the court’s bias against enhanced people but, it’s the only way that Ross is going to pay for what he has done. Also, you need to talk to everyone about the UN’s terms.”
“Are you sure? I know that he needs someone but having a kid, let alone a super-powered one, is a big responsibility-“
Ross stalked towards Peter, who tried to put on a mask of courage, and said in a voice one would use when speaking to a small child, "Welcome to your new home." Peter's straight face faltered but he managed to maintain his pretence of indifference. Only the highly-trained spy in the room caught it.
A low, animalistic roar erupted from Ross. He picked up a knife and launched himself at Peter. The Secretary of State held the knife to Peter’s neck, pressing it just enough to draw blood. Peter steeled himself and spat in Ross’ red face. Ross roared again and stabbed the knife into Peter’s shoulder.
They had stayed in the same position, hugging each other tight, for longer than they could keep track of. Neither wanted to lose each other again, but they had work to do.
“Hey, Wands, Clint, do you think this has something bad in it?” He poked the cake only for it to tear, revealing glass and boiling acid which burnt this fingertip and sprayed broken glass all over the floor. He jumped onto his bed to get away from it, but some glass found its way into his knees causing a searing pain.
“Sh-she’s gone, Clint. She’s... sh-she’s...dead.” Peter choked out the last word, his breathing slowing down. The older hero tried to guide his breathing back to a normal pace. Peter’s eyes went from frantic to glazed over and emotionless. And then Peter’s breathing stopped.
"You okay, kid?" Peter looked up to see the face of Clint Barton, peering through the glass from the cell next to him. The young mutant scrambled away from the window, not comprehending that the archer was probably only trying to help. He looked kind and fatherly even when he was visibly shivering from the cold.
It was chaotic, to put it simply. The room was divided into three parts. On Peter’s right, there was a pristine kitchen. It had a big island in the middle with surrounded by tall stools. The cabinets were black with grey accents and it had low-hanging, warm lights. In the centre of the room there was a long and dark, wooden table with candles all down the middle. The remaining third of the room had a large television screen surrounded by bean bags, comfy-looking sofas and cabinets with glass doors filled with all sorts of snacks and drinks. Most of the avengers were sat around the table. Clint was standing on the kitchen island, running away from Natasha Romanoff. Tony was leaning on the back of one of the couches, drinking his coffee whilst Colonel Rhodes was trying to tell him why he shouldn’t be drinking so much coffee. Vision and Wanda had moved their chairs very close to each other at the table. Scott and Sam were unloading the pizzas onto the table.
“Could Tony Stark please stand and walk to the centre of the room please?” King T’Challa of Wakanda spoke up. Rhodes nodded at his childhood friend and pushed him gently off is chair and towards  the place the fate of his friends and family would be decided. Tony walked on wobbly legs. He’d never been nervous in front of a crowd before but this was different. If this went wrong, his kid would be stuck on the raft for as long as he lived or he’d be broken out and him and Steve would have to live on the run and that was no way spend your life.
What were they planning? Then he knew. The lights started to brighten, and an increasingly loud hum played from the speakers. A tile on the wall opened to reveal the nozzle of a bottle. A sweet but pungent smell filled the room through it.  Peter, already exhausted and struggling to breathe properly, instantly felt overwhelmed as his senses were attacked.
“I will guide you using the floor lights.” F.R.I.D.A.Y said as two white strips on the floor close to the walls lit up. Peter followed the lights until he heard loud voices coming from a room close by.
“Remember what Helen said, don’t eat to much or you’ll make yourself sick.” Tony reminded the teen. Peter nodded.
“I’m afraid Boss has not given you permission to change what I call you by.” F.R.I.D.A.Y stated matter-of-factly. Clint groaned.
“Ross. He took the kid. We have to save him.” Tony mumbled. Steve looked confused, he turned his head towards Natasha.
Ross smiled, “I want to recreate them, of course. I can only learn so much from the tests we ran on you when you first arrived.”
After a few moments of content silence, Tony blurted out, “I’m going to adopt Peter.” Steve turned so he was facing him completely.
“Tones, are you okay?!” Steve called, trying to catch up but give Tony the space he obviously needed. Tony ran into the bathroom and locked the door behind him. The super soldier sighed. Soon the sound of crying could be heard from behind the door.
“Anything for you.” Steve smiled down at Tony. And suddenly they were kissing. Tony pulled away, “Later, when we have something to celebrate.”
Tony looked out at the group in front of him. Most of his dysfunctional family was back. S.H.I.E.L.D was still working on finding Bruce and Thor- well, no one ever even knows what planet Thor is on but he’d be back soon enough most likely- but, even though a few were missing, Tony felt happier than he had in a very long time.
"Hey, calm down, we're not gonna hurt you." Came a female voice from behind him. He turned to see Wanda Maximoff smiling softly at him.  Her long, red hair was tangled and her neck had a thick, metal collar around it. She along with Peter and Clint were wearing white and blue jumpsuits but, unlike the rest, she was wearing a straightjacket. Peter cringed at the discomfort it must be causing her.
They arrived at the UNs headquarters on the other side of Manhattan in record time. Tony took a deep breath and walked through the establishment to the large meeting room that reminded Tony of a modernised Greek theatre. There was a large screen projecting what was on a laptop. The group of 4 took their designated seats. Natasha saw Thaddeus Ross across the room and had to suppress the urge to wring his neck there and then. Vision put a hand on her shoulder, sensing her unease.
“First of all, we want to know why now? Why tell us you want to change the Sokovia accords now?” President Matthew Ellis questioned. Tony pondered his response.
He didn't manage to finish his exclamation before 8 people had their guns pointed at him. He yelped in fear and had to refrain from leaping to the ceiling on instinct.
“Yeah, buddy, it’s me.” Clint turned to corner and finally saw Peter. There was blood on his torso and some trickling from his arm. There was vomit on the floor around him. He looked like a ghost, pale cheeks and watery eyes. His lips and fingers were tinged blue. Clint was instantly concerned the kid had pneumonia.
“You tell me in the next five fucking minutes exactly what I want to know, or I swear to god, I’ll kill you. Right here. Right now. You’re on a timer.”
“Of course. I’ll just go get the wheelchair and take you to the bathroom.” Steve left and returned with a basic black wheelchair. He lifted Peter’s small frame into it and wheeled him to the bathroom.
“Okay, well, you can tell me what you know, I’ll fill in the gaps, and then we can start painting something. Sound good?” Peter nodded. “Great, let’s get aprons ‘cause I don’t fancy spending ages getting paint out of our clothes after this.”
“Well, Mr Parker, got any witty remarks left?” Peter’s lips trembled too much for him to form a sentence. Ross rolled his eyes and motioned his men forward. They undid Peter’s restraints and one of them put the inmate over his shoulder, aggressively, unwary of the youths injuries. Peter didn’t even have the strength to fight back.
Wanda's face was a canvas of rage, "What the fuck does Ross think he's doing putting a 14 year old child in here?!" Scott looked emotionally distressed, he saw his Cassie in the innocent characteristics of the super teen. Clint thought of Lila, Cooper and baby Nate back home on the farm, and his heart ached for the imprisoned child in front of him. Sam felt sick to the stomach as he thought about what must be going through Peter's head.
“Bet you’re hungry, aren’t you?” Tony asked. Peter nodded. “It’s Friday, so we gonna have our weekly big avengers dinner and then we’re all gonna settle down and watch a film. Do you want to join us? We’ll let you pick the food and the movie.”
When his face was mere inches from the floor, he shot out a web and pulled himself upwards. For the first time in months, Peter felt completely free. Shooting through the crisp, early evening air, he had no fear. He launched himself forward, towards sounds of violence.
Natasha nodded. “Short answer is yes and soon. Long answer is, the government are trying to cover all this up. For pretty obvious reasons, they don’t want people knowing they put a child in prison. We’ll tell the school, you were on a stark industries retreat and they have been told about your aunt so they’ll figure that’s why you have been gone so long. The UN haven’t released your identity to the public for the same reasons but have said that if the media finds out there’s nothing they can do.”
At least Tony was either too nervous about his new position or not willing to call him on the bullshit, because he looked between them before licking his lips. “Well. When is the rest of the team going to be here?”
Steve opened the back door and got in, careful of his height and smiling a little when Tony immediately hopped off of Steve’s shoulders to pad over to the pile of clothes neatly folded on the seat behind Natasha.
Barton’s eyes narrowed, and he looked back and forth between the two before something sparked in his eyes and he flicked the safety back on. “I thought you were team leader, Natasha. Never
“They’re not very accepting, or open. I’ve spent a long time with them, so let me do the talking first.”
Tony rubbed the back of his neck. “Yeah, if you… well, part of the reason I leave so fast is that I’m still working out the kinks with the armor. There’re some problems with it. I don’t exactly have a lot of resources, and I can’t exactly improve things. But I’m trying to make it better. I haven’t flown into a building again.”
he had to pull out some level of supplies to actually package and sell all the food, because Mrs. Qasim may have been their last customer, but she clearly was crowing about her haul to anyone she passed in the street because
But Tony was nothing but a sucker for a challenge. He was petty, he loved proving people wrong, and he had no filter when he was this sleep-deprived. “Sure,” he said, taking another deep sip and then pushing himself to his feet. “You got stuff to cook with in that kitchen?”
“Do you have anything to say for yourself, Ste-Virn?” N’t’lly asked, interrupting what Byu-Kyonn was going to say next.
There was no answer, and Tony slit his eyes open, and there was a fire in them that Steve was shocked by. “Brock Rumlow, are you going to ignore my question?”
do something they find strange or weird. Besides, Clint should be pulling his fair amount of weight.”
“My master had been very strict, but also spoke to me on my level, not as if I was a child. He explained what attachments meant to a Jedi, and why they were frowned upon—but also that attachments were a part of life. He helped me navigate through the executor’s desires, my wider family’s desires, even the company officials’ desires. I decided to divest from war technology and focus on medical and agricultural technology, as there was higher demand and the less evil I could put out in the world, the better.”
Saark’s eyes promised words later, but he bobbed his head, clearly playing up his Ailish morphology. “A small access hatch or even a storage room would be good enough. I could even share Ste-Virn’s quarters, of course. I am aware that my appearance is unexpected and willing to deal with what you have available.”
Finally, Kulsi sighed, and placed a hand on Ste-Virn’s upper back. “You did well. I know it doesn’t seem like I’m saying it, but I believe you have. I just worry about what this will do in the long run, because without that evidence, we can do nothing except let this continue. I am glad that by pairing you two together, you have managed to resolve your differences and work together. After all, that seemed like an impossibility when I was your master. But Anotoni must have been willing to cross the white bridge.”
Steve narrowed his eyes at the director. There was some game being played here—he could scent it. He may not be the best at manipulation, not in the way that Romanoff was, but he could hold his own in a chess game against her. “That doesn’t explain what we do during our downtime. Sir.”
There was silence, and for a brief moment Steve panicked that the omega was unable to speak—old conservatives when
“I know,” Byu-Kyonn laughed. “You triedta hide it. You couldn’t ever hide anythin’ from me, an’ ya know it. But I don’t think anyone else woulda noticed.”
All Steve had known had come from what he had seen about the tower—built big and brash with the man’s name literally stamped on the side—and the few snippets he heard from junior agents around SHIELD. Then he had met the man, the only one of the team hastily thrown together before the Battle of New York whose civilian identity was widely known, and so the only one with his mask off when they had their debriefing with Colonel Fury, and he had not improved his opinion of the man in any way.
It was… a good apology, and a sincere one. Ste-Virn was good at picking up falsehoods through the Force, and Saark was sincere.
Behind the den and across from the living room and kitchen was an enclosed room—opening the door revealed that it was a security room, with access to what was probably sublevel basements.
Steve jerked, and nearly threw the plate in his hand at the voice—but it was just Natasha. Natasha, who was here in this pseudo-job, this fake stage where they all playacted like they were all fine after the aliens
Saark bowed formally, Ste-Virn a beat behind him, and then the two of them exited the Council Chambers.
“I know that I’m expected to be at your service, and be of service to anyone else on the team. I know that this team is entirely made up of alphas. I know that Steve Rogers is head alpha. I know that there will be a lot of downtime for this team, and many alphas in a small building, so I am to be available for all alphas, to minimize conflicts.”
, but definitely more accepting, of homosexual relationships. That no one needed to be a ‘friend of Dorothea’ any more. That even if people said something about it, all they were allowed to do was use words, not back that up with violence.
“You don’t like me, Rogers. I got it. I know it. It’s clear in everything you do, in how you don’t let me be alone with Tony, in how you treated me when we were out in the field. You let some random-ass
It didn’t smell bad, but it tasted strange. It was odd enough to pull Tony more out of his thoughts, grounded him more in his body and the here and now as he sipped lightly at it and debated whether he liked it or not. He’s pretty sure he tasted something like this before, and he didn’t mind it, but something was off about it. What was it? For sure not mint. Chamomile? No, not the right…
Most people were very visibly disappointed, but accepting. The café wasn’t that big a name—well, it was getting there now, apparently, because of the food, but it wasn’t there
Ste-Virn did his best to calm his emotions. He was a Jedi Knight—young, perhaps, and only just, but still. Jedi Knight. He didn’t lash out in anger; he processed it and boiled it down to the worry and fear that would be the root of his anger.
(Clint was coming to learn that Tony did nothing without throwing himself one-hundred-and-fifty-percent into it, going way beyond what normal people did, because Tony himself had only two settings—twenty percent, or two-hundred percent, nothing in between.)
After a few minutes, Steve pointed at one of the corner seats in the window, a squishy armchair next to a wobbly, tiny table that was barely big enough for two coffee cups. “Sit down. I think I can make you something to drink, at least, for right now.”
Tony stormed back up the street, into the lobby of his building. When he turned around, Steve wasn’t there anymore—and that was wrong, because Steve was supposed to be there so he could yell at him, so he stomped back out, and the sunlight was so glaring, that’s why his eyes were watering, and belted out, “Get your ass over here, Steve Rogers!”
“By now, anyone in that whole quadrant who has any level of money is trying to hire mercenaries to protect their children.” Saark’s eyes were bleak as he looked over the datasheets and datapads that were strewn across the counter as Ste-Virn took notes and shared information with Saark. “No more in-person schools for many of them; the spike in VR-schooling permits is staggering. It’s affecting the overall economy and though the kidnappers have spaced their taking apart erratically enough that there’s no pattern, families are living in constant fear.”
“Well, it’s not like you guys did anything to prove otherwise,” Clint grumbled, but he bumped his shoulder with Natasha. He knew making connections for her was hard—which was why he wasn’t prying too hard into her sorta-not-really-girlfriend.
“No one knows who or what it is, though, right? I asked Fury,” Steve asked, putting the other cupcakes on a plate and covering it with a mixing bowl to keep the frosting from drying out. “It appeared in Afghanistan, disappeared, and then reappeared around the world randomly. I think the alien thing was the first time Iron Man actively worked and appeared on American soil, right?”
as possible—yesterday had been a nightmare. He almost didn’t come, but he knew they worried about him, and he wasn’t as badly beat up as that warehouse shit that was a few weeks back.
Stark was… a whole other ballgame. He was someone that had been sarcastic at turns, cutting, and downright an asshole.
Ste-Virn had to admit, if his suspects were managing to pull of kidnappings and get ransoms regularly, they had to have a lot more financial stability than he had assumed, and certainly had more backing and resources and protection than he had believed them to have.
Stane’s face darkened. “See what I mean? Cheeky bastard. I’m telling you, Captain; you’re young, so you’re bound to make some mistakes, but these omegas need a firm hand and direction in order to keep them on the straight and narrow—”
Steve frowned, going over his past interactions with the team. Then he thought back to the shit the Howling Commandos got up to.
He swallowed, and closed his eyes. “And I was wrong. You had every opportunity to contact your guardian previous. You are of age. I shouldn’t have tried to be… overbearing, or controlling. I know and you know that you don’t need that.”
A mug of lavender and rose tea—the scent was light, floral, wafting up with the curls of steam—appeared, and Natasha curled Tony’s hands around it. “Drink, Stark,” she said quietly. “No one expects you to deal with it yourself.”
When he’d been forced to confront his own feelings, and how those feelings were affecting his ability to be objective with Saark, when he’d been able to work before with many different types of people from all walks of life.
Steve walked as briskly as he could without actually running, especially with all the tourists and walkers that were taking ‘covert’ pictures of Steve and Natasha. In the distance, he could see the wagging tail of a golden retriever, and he made his way towards it.
Because, as Steve and Natasha were finding out since they turned around, Tony was sitting there, naked. Only this time, for some reason, there was a glowing circle in the center of Tony’s chest, in the place where a normal person would have a sternum.
Ste-Virn staggered from the mental weight, and nearly fell to his knees—but there, a long winding tunnel, and the soft sound of water lapping against stone. There must be a boat there somewhere—and, if Ste-Virn remembered correctly, the canal fed into the larger lake that bordered the planet’s royal city.
And it was shellshock, Steve wasn’t an idiot. He’d seen old Mr. Hayes on their street, after the First War, and he’d seen what it was like to live with shellshock. He’d helped out around the man’s apartment and did his best to make things easier for him and Mr. Hayes friend, and he never begrudged the man that kindness and acceptance.
Good Jedi didn’t get angry. They certainly didn’t whip around to tower over their partner, eyes flashing as they hissed, “You know, but you thought you knew better, and you didn’t value my input at all! I’ve been working this case for a long time, but you think you can walk in and solve it without listening to the intel I’ve build up over time? How is that in any way a smart way to run this investigation? Did the Council somehow indicate that I had nothing and needed your help? Did Master Windu decide to intervene so that you could do something other than escort politicians around?”
(Yes, she was also seeing a therapist now. Tony had found counselors for all of them, and then another counselor, and then another, and then another, until Steve had felt comfortable enough to talk to someone. Clint had been a different issue—he was almost a bit more well-adjusted than either her or Coulson, and had been willing to talk, he just didn’t feel like he, as someone who had led to so many SHIELD agents deaths, could actually talk to a counselor from SHIELD.
“You requested to go there,” Fury said, and somehow the phone managed to convey both his smug smile and his amusement.
their thing. They put their hand out, or tilt their neck, and the scent of them or the hormonal triggers or
because there was no way he dropped into ice and came back to something like this. It made no sense.
It took Steve perhaps too long to realize exactly what that look was, but after he had done just a cursory check, he glanced at Tony a second time and realized what it meant. “Oh, do you have any experience with computers?”
Grinning, Tony sunk deeper into the chair. “Told you,” he said smugly. “I ought to come and cook for you every morning or something. Baking is just science.”
Tony blinked, and paused, some of the fear disappearing as he tried to parse out what Steve was saying. “Your… back? Is cold?”
“What? No, you don’t have to. They just like to get used to an area, that’s all, and since that wasn’t going to be
Steve couldn’t help smiling in return. He was terrified, but it was just… it was just Tony. Two months ago, he would have been skeptical of a Stark, but Tony… Tony had changed his mind. Tony had brought him food, and made him look up lobbying laws, and increased his pop culture knowledge, and had given him someone to rail at when stupid people still wanted to deny the importance of vaccines. Tony was… not as bad as he had initially thought.
Natasha treated Tony almost… in fear. She seemed both intrigued by him and wary, and either was way too close to him or the furthest away. He asked, one time, the two of them sitting on the porch of the safehouse, bored out of their fucking skulls, watching warily as Rumlow was trying to challenge Thor to a cannonball diving contest of all things, while Clint and Sharon egged them on and Tony, all dark skin bared to the sun, wearing nothing but swimming trunks and sunglasses, lounged on the side of the pool.
There was a burst of laughter, and then Byu-Kyonn’s voice crackled as he replied, “You wouldn’ta called me inna middle of th’ kirffin’ night ta gnaw the fat. What’s th’ problem?”
“I know!” Steve replied, voice low. “I don’t know how to undo that. I just need to show him that I don’t want him—I dunno, kneeling on the floor instead of sitting at the table!”
Master W’Lsinn hummed a little to himself. “Very well. I know you’re hiding something, but you are also old enough to know the consequences of your actions and accept them. You are also old enough to know when to call in for help and when not to. A lecture won’t do me any good now.”
“My parents had been killed only months before. I knew that, in a distant way, primarily because the executor of their estate had stopped by to tell me I had controlling interest in a company I knew almost nothing about. I was twelve.”
Snapped out of his own (quiet) meditation to try and ignore the whirlwind of disruption that was Saark, Ste-Virn nodded and pulled out his holoprojector and threw up the faces of his suspects. “Yes, of course, Master Windu. I’ve been working with my contacts on trying to identify a new trafficking ring that is operating primarily in the Gaulus sector of the Outer Rim territories. Trafficking and slavery has always been a concern in spice mines and their usage, but these specific mines are underneath a company called ‘Indenaturing Mining’ and all workers for this company are labeled as ‘contract-workers only.’ This has caused the company to have been accepted in many non-slave-holding planetary systems to set up mines, because of their supposed usage of workers who voluntarily accepted high pay for the risk of working in spice mines. Yet multiple missing persons cases can be traced back to this company and these always seem to be ‘simple clerical errors’ and the company itself claims no knowledge of it. I’ve been tracking these three beings in particular, because it seems like all my missing persons’ cases can be traced back to one of these three. They are listed as ‘consultants’ and receive erratic paychecks from the company, but so far their presence has been waived as mercenaries protecting shipments. I’ve been trying to find one of these shipments, ascertain what the shipments are exactly—as I suspect they’re shipping beings into slavery—and record proof that high enough officials in this company have in fact been aware of exactly what services and shipments these beings have been providing the company.”
So, let them meet. Make sure that Tony received whatever message Stane had been trying to send. Give Tony options other than working for a difficult alpha who couldn’t be a
The restaurant was a bit fancier than Natasha was really comfortable with, but it was also a very nice place and Natasha’s therapist had made it clear that she needed to try to do nice things for herself. She had made Steve fix the bathtub so she could have long soaks, and she had forced Clint (not that he had needed much forcing) to paint her nails bright colors. Even Tony had gotten into it, buying her delicate glass figurines that she displayed in her room.
No one came out, and Clint watched the car out of the corner of his eye, muscles tense even as he tried to smile at old Mrs. Qasim as she paid for her iced chai latte (
“Yeah,” Tony sighed. “That’s what I thought this was about. I thought Fury either figured it out, or had it figured out and was telling you guys. I didn’t know—it wasn’t like we walked into Stark Industries from the front door. We came in from the side. And SI’s building houses a lot of other companies, and worked closely with SHIELD. I just… anyway. I didn’t expect it. I didn’t think Obadiah would go through SHIELD to get to me. I honestly didn’t think he’d care, when it comes to it. He got the company, which is what he wanted.”
Ste-Virn remembered. Saark was a delicate man, build wiry and lean, but short. As a sixteen-year-old Padawan sharing close quarters with someone who was twelve and who could outperform him any day, Ste-Virn had been unable to find the compassion a good Jedi would have towards others in Saark’s position.
Even as he made his way towards the dog, he realized that the scent of motor oil was getting stronger, and then fainter. Steve stopped, and paused. He hadn’t seen Tony in the tree, hadn’t seen him on the ground… but he
His master, S’m W’Lsinn, had told him that the biggest stumbling block was his stubbornness. That he had difficulty changing and being flexible, in the way a Jedi needed to be.
Saark trailed off, and Ste-Virn waited, feeling his heartbeat in his ears, wondering. What brought this on? What in the Force prompted Saark to reveal something so… so traumatic, so devastating?
And he did, all that night and the next day, and the next. He worried at the idea like a dog at a bone, turning it over and over, because he might not be comfortable with the thought of interacting with people, but the whole purpose of this set-up was to get him comfortable with the modern world, to improve his ability to deal with the real world, to get him ready to leave and actually have his own place, not live in a tiny shoebox of a room above the café because he couldn’t handle ordering takeout, creating a bank account, using the subway, or any of the other myriad ways one had to function around society without freaking out or getting overwhelmed.
“The hold, master. The hold of the ship shows years of wear and tear on the manacles, and the stench of the unwashed. The room shows constant usage and chains. Security cameras would reveal more of what happened in that room—”
Here on Rodia, the people were starving and beleaguered by pirates and smugglers stealing the shipments of food and supplies that were en route to the planet. Rodia did not have a large army, and was a product of multiple colonization attempts, so the infrastructure in place to mine the rich minerals, water, and wildlife were almost exclusively in the hands of off-planet companies. It meant little money poured back into the economy, so little ability to gain recognition in the Senate to its problems and plights.
When Clint finally got time to breathe and do something other than triage the massive flood of food, he noticed Tony Stark slumped in his ‘customary’ chair, huge sunglasses perched on his face, a split lip and a bruise on his cheekbone.
“You’re muttering to yourself again,” Natasha murmured as she stepped by. She had gloves on, washing the dishes and keeping the kitchen tidy, and he paused and sighed.
interests—all of that helps. And I know… I know it’s not a substitute for talking with an actual therapist. So—if you were to go to a therapist. I dunno. Maybe I would too.”
Steve couldn’t help himself; he snorted, fighting not to laugh. At that response, Tony slowly unfroze, his face twitching into a small smile.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck. “I can only say that it was a mistake. A poor one, and one that backfired, no matter how much I thought it would be a good idea at the time. I can think up a million excuses, but it doesn’t change the fact that I assumed I knew what was best, and I tried to do it for you. If there’s one thing I learned, watching you open up and watching you interact with the team, it’s that you can do things for yourself, and you prefer doing things for yourself. My fears and worries shouldn’t have interfered with that.”
himself for misjudging the situation so badly, and he was leaning heavily on his senses in order to track Natasha and Clint’s scents—for some reason, he couldn’t find Tony’s, in the midst of all the foliage, but Clint’s scent was
to go down and meet the other members, and he hesitated, not sure whether he should instead decide to have the omega stay in the room, and then go consult with Natasha on how to handle team omegas in today’s world. He knew, overall, what to do, and if he was going to confide and look for help from anyone, it would be Natasha, who he had worked with before.
He made his way upstairs and paused on the second floor. The door to one room was half-open, the light low. He glanced inside to see bunkbed occupied, Natasha stretched out on the lower bunk and Clint nowhere to be found.
Without thinking, Ste-Virn shifted, putting his hands over Anotoni’s, gently holding them still. “Saark.
Flapping a hand at the door, Director Fury dismissed Steve by saying, “Romanoff’s already prepped and ready. Pack up and head out with her—Banner will be joining you shortly. Rumlow is out on assignment, and Carter’s in New Mexico with our envoy. Barton will be waiting for you at the base. You may not like the assignment, Captain, but I expect you’ll be ready for anything anyway.”
He kept the light on, to give Tony light to see by when Tony came out, because while they were both cat shifters and therefore, most likely, could see fine in the dark, he didn’t want to assume and why make it harder than it needed to be, after all? So he stared up at the ceiling, waiting for Tony to come out, and wondering how awkward this was going to be. Steve was handsy in his sleep, he knew this—woke up curled around Bucky more than once, driving Bucky nuts because Bucky was a bear shifter and absolutely hated how Steve’s cat would wrap around him like an overwarm blanket—and he hoped Tony wouldn’t take offense.
The tension drained from Ste-Virn’s body, and he sat down on his bunk, relaxing for the first time in what seemed like weeks even though he’d only been four days on this mission with Saark. “Hey, Byu-Kyonn. B-Ky. What’re you up to?”
They sat in silence, Ste-Virn looking down, Kulsi’s face turned to him. Around them, in the royal militia’s headquarters, beings were rushing back and forth, filling out paperwork and processing the many guards, trying to offer sobering-up pills and treatments to the ones still too far out of it. The noise pressed around them, around Ste-Virn, and he didn’t know what to say.
The two turned to look at him, big eyes focused unblinkingly on him. “Veer,” the shorter one said, voice a rough croak. “You’ve got a friend, now.”
well with Saark. Saark had had a rich parent, had care packages from home, had a bunch of friends. Very sociable and bright, picking up languages like many of his species. Saark was an Ailish, a cousin species to the Fosh, without the overly avian features like true feathers, didactyl feet, and a beaked face. They were highly political and secretive, and Saark’s nest group controlled a huge intergalactic company that created, shipped, and designed weaponry, ships, and technology for almost every major nation. Their goods were so well-known they were practically household conversation, and Saark himself was equally in the spotlight all the time even though he was a Jedi. The Jedi masters had nearly despaired of Saark’s pleasure-seeking ways and three times had almost expelled him from the program.
when we come back. He doesn’t like Brock, he has difficulty with Thor, and he still…” Steve trailed off, thinking of Tony’s tiny, curled up form on the very edge of the bed, flinching away from every movement Steve made. “He still doesn’t trust any of us not to take advantage. I don’t think he’s ever felt safe enough around us to nest, let alone heat, and that’s not safe for an omega. His guardian can fix that.”
It was a relatively small room. The walls were covered in cabinets full of art supplies. A high table with backless bar stools was in the centre of the room. There were many sketches around the room of some of the avengers and paintings of NYC amongst other things. They all had one thing in common, they were amazingly detailed.
"Anyway, it doesn't matter, nothing you can do about it," the sinister man said, "I'll be back." He slipped back into the elevator and disappeared.
FRIDAY's voice filled the lab for the fifteenth time that evening, sounding almost human in her annoyed tone of voice.
“Well, Peter? Are you going to give me an answer? Or am I going to have to...resort to less friendly methods?” He gestured at the men, who had came in rolling a metal table with multiple random objects lying on top of it. The teens eyes darted from item to item. He trained them back on the authoritative man in front of him. His face hardened.
“Pete, you’re bleeding right now, because of this asshole. After all he did to you, you’re defending him?” Tony asked, clearly confused.
“Oh, Pete, come here.” Wanda opened up her arms and Peter tumbled into her embrace, sobbing hard. The young woman rubbed circles into the spider-themed teen’s back.
Please comment, it really makes my day and gives me the energy to write the next chapter <3 as always point out mistakes <3
Steve, Wanda and Clint would not be able to come to the trial, but Sam was permitted so he could make a statement.
All the heroes got ready for the trying day ahead of them. The time came for them to leave. They all boarded the quinjet with stoic faces. Steve mouthed ‘it will all be okay’ to Tony as the doors slid shut.
Natasha had only met Parker three times but everything from his Bambi eyes to his adorable, youthful smile, meant she had instantly felt the urge to protect him from all of the world's evil. He didn't deserve to be locked away for helping people. The spy would do anything she could to help the spider-kid.
First, Clint was asked to talk to the teenager. Barton had become very protective over the Spider-Child since having to give him CPR.
“...Yeah... turn around...” What Ross didn’t know was that Peter’s increased hearing abilities meant he had heard a familiar voice shout ‘Fuck!’ and then began running closer and closer to the door.
know that. What else didn’t he know, that he should? How badly would he upset or offend this omega before they even properly became a team? “So… I should leave him alone?”
Natasha refused to even dignify that with a response. She walked into her room and began putting away her clothes into the dresser.
Brown robes wrapped around his muscular, humanoid body, Steve folded his arms respectfully and inclined his head. “Master Windu. You summoned me?”
“We have complimentary skillsets,” Natasha said dryly. “Even if not necessarily complimentary personalities.”
Steve jumped, hitting his head on the bottom of the sink and then the edge of the cupboard. Hissing out curses between his teeth, he looked up to see Sharon leaning against the doorway.
Tony stood there, eyes downcast, hands at his sides, and Steve reached desperately for something to say. “Do you… not want to sleep in the bed?”
Dazedly, Anotoni looked down at his hands. “I thought the spice wore off. Clearly, I’m still hallucinating.”
Somehow, it was worse asking twice. “You need any help in the front?” Steve said, forcing his voice not to shake, shift, or do anything except be straightforward. He had faced down literal tanks. He could do this.
Up to the third floor revealed a room full of machinery he knew nothing about, slanted ceilings—clearly, up by the roof, in a converted attic—and two fairly large rooms. The largest he left alone; the second largest, he opened.
and I couldn’t stop them. I’m just—our world doesn’t have any defense against that, we’re so far behind and we’re not in any way capable of dealing with that—”
Steve made it to Central Park, trying very hard to hold on to his lion. It hadn’t been happy, meeting with Obadiah Stane and waiting in that room as Stane had spoken so…
“Something hurt him, earlier. Before. He’s expecting to be hit for having opinions, or for speaking.”
He turned to face her, feeling his lip begin to curl into a snarl, and then he saw her eyes dancing and sparking. Playing. Teasing.
“Easy, big guy, I’m a lot to look at, aren’t I? Poor Brock’s been champing at the bit for a taste of omega, it’s been almost six months, and everyone’s waiting for the big bad alpha’s say-so that the omega can finally be with someone else. I’m always in your room, alpha, always by your side. You don’t let me out of your sight. Stands to reason that people are getting… antsy.”
He needed to figure out how to have Tony safely and normally interact with the team, especially since at least four out of the seven of them were enhanced in some way. He also wanted to figure out what drove Tony to join the military in the first place, particularly because people didn’t just
It should be safe for Ste-Virn to dock. He could touch down, see if he could get close… But what if the ship took off again? It had done this previously, stopping long enough for Ste-Virn to think that they were docking, only to scramble to catch up on their ion trail as they hopped away…
“Ah, Clint came in. Or, well, he knocked, and started to open the door, and I said you’d come down later that you were busy.”
It was a statement, a lame one at that, but Tony was operating on maybe five hours of sleep strung out between the same number of days, too much caffeine and not enough food, hands shaking, mind going too fast for him to really process anything that whirled through it, and so it was the first words that tumbled out of his mouth, spilled onto the air between the two of them.
“You mean he’s been there all that time and you didn’t bother to ask his name?” Fury said, voice dry.
There was a long moment of silence, and then Byu-Kyonn grunted. “Is that all ya needed ta talk ta me about? Yer both gonna haveta get along. Yer both adults. You can figure this out.”
He turned and walked away, and it took a moment for Tony to really understand that Steve meant it—and that Steve wasn’t waiting—before he tripped to his feet, clutched onto the lamppost in order to keep from falling (ew, sticky, what the hell, he knew better than to really
Finally, he approached Clint one day as Clint was putting on the apron and humming to himself. “You need… any help in the front?”
“Of course. I would like to hear more about which two of my suspects you recognized, and the nature of the kidnappings and ransom requests,” Ste-Virn said easily, entering the quarters and moving towards the kitchen. “Water?”
Steve sat up, heaving, gasping for air. It felt too cold, and he was shivering. He stood up, moving into the bathroom and scrabbling madly for the light switch. The bathroom was white tile, light blue on the floor, and it was
The bed dipped, dropped, and something warm and heavy settled on top of Steve—and then something more, and something more. Steve needed to argue this, couldn’t let Tony just
Clint frowned as he took the tray. He knew Natasha didn’t have a high opinion of Tony Stark—for good reason—but Stark looked… like he needed help.
He never let anything bother him, and Ste-Virn supposed he should be grateful that Saark hadn’t picked up on his rudeness – or, at least, was willing to work past that and focus on the case.
“Is this because of the fight you two had last week?” she responded quietly. “I want you to be making this decision not because you’re running scared, but because you think it’s the best choice for Tony.”
Natasha stared at him a moment, and then smiled softly. “We are both new at being on a team, and we’re going to make mistakes, for sure. In any case—”
Clint wandered into the kitchen a few minutes after Rumlow had wandered out, a frown also on his face. “Did you know Rumlow was assigned to this team?”
Waves. Near the canal. Ste-Virn stood up, firmly ignoring Anotoni’s pleading whine, and made his way to where he knew the canal was located. It looked like it was solid rock—until he managed to get right up against it, and hear the hum of electricity and machinery behind one section.
Ste-Virn wouldn’t even be so upset if Saark ever acknowledged that he knew what he was doing when he said those words, or behaved in that way. But Saark always acted oblivious, as if shocked that Ste-Virn would take offense at his behavior and words. And Ste-Virn was tired of always trying to be the mature one and walk away from what Saark had said or done this day.
They stood there a moment, staring, and then Steve decided Tony was waiting for Steve to change his mind. So Steve laid back down and got back under the thin sheet, staring up at the ceiling.
times you were unsafe,” Natasha said, but the corner of her mouth was lifted, even as Clint stared in shock at Tony.
Even Master Kulsi seemed to realize that that was both the best he could expect from Anotoni, and that Anotoni was about to fall over. “Sit down,” he said tiredly. “Make sure you rest. He needs his detox pills; be sure he gets them, Ste-Virn.”
Soft noises in the room came, and Steve did his best to fall asleep while hearing the soft breathing in the corner of the room.
“So sorry I’m late,” Saark said breezily, voice lightly accented with his trilling native dialect. “I got sidetracked, and I did not mean to. There is no excuse for not being on time.”
here—came just ten or fifteen minutes ago, actually. I directed him to the largest bedroom, and carried his trunk in there for him before letting him settle in. You know omegas like to nest a bit around their new quarters.”
He seemed to be drunk, or at the very least… not in his correct state of mind. Clint looked at him out of the side of his eye as he picked up the bills. It was a
In fact, the only reason they hadn’t done so was because of Jedi Knight Filliph Kulsi—who was, for almost a year of Ste-Virn’s life, Ste-Virn’s own Jedi Knight Master.
“Ste-Virn, the smuggler’s end, yeah?” Saark’s voice was slightly breathless—shorter than Ste-Virn, he almost had to hop to keep up with Ste-Virn’s long strides.
“I was wrong. I talked a big game, I thought I was treating you like I would treat anyone else under my protection. I believed that I was doing nothing but what I should.”
It was probably too early, he told himself as he staggered to his feet and dragged on a pair of sweats and a jacket over his tank top. It was probably too early—he repeated it, over and over, as he took the elevator that went straight down to street level and deposited him out on the just-barely healed New York City streets, the streets that he had helped tear up two months ago and had put more money than his investors were happy with into repairing.
“I’ve known they needed to change for a while but recently they affected someone...close to me...They were put in the raft and it’s because certain things weren’t taken into account when the accords were written. Like... hm, I don’t know... teenage superheroes.” There was a ripple of unease amongst the world leaders. “In fact, President Ellis, I have a question for you. Would you care to explain why on Earth there is currently a newly-turned 15 year old, who has never hurt a soul, in your prison?!” Tony heard his voice raise and regretted it but he couldn’t stop the emotion filtering into his voice. Noises of outrage and small conversations filled the room.
“May...I’m...I’m so...sorry...” Peter mumbled. His arms flailed around. Beads of sweat covered his forehead.
“Don’t bother. It’s vibranium.” Ross’ tone was dismissive, “I just want one answer for now, Spider-Man. Where did you get your powers?”
Tony wrapped his arms around Peter’s shaking form. “It is not your fault, okay? Repeat it. ‘It’s not my fault. Your turn, go.”
The test results came in and Helen was pleased to see it was just a more severe case of Pulmonary Edema and a fractured sternum, not something she hadn’t dealt with before. Peter’s body was getting some of the nutrients it so desperately needed and as soon as his healing factor kicked back in, he would probably not need the oxygen support anymore and his sternum would heal itself.
Apparently Thaddeus Ross didn’t have the decency to leave Peter alone on his birthday. Once again Peter had found himself in Room 86.
“She will sort him out, Tony. She’s the best in the business. The healing superhero business, that is.” Clint was reassuring himself as much as Tony.
“We need to get his blood sugars up. I think the lack of food has inhibited his healing factor. A quick chest radiograph will tell us if he has fluid in his lungs and the extent, but it does seem to be the case.”
And now this, Peter being locked away at the raft, it was too much. Tony should have been paying more attention to the kid, to Ross' movements. The billionaire would get the spider-themed hero out of there if it was the last thing he did. Next on his list was creating a revised version of the accords. They weren't working and, once the Stark showed the UN that Ross was putting teenagers in prison in the name of the accords, he just hoped the world leaders would agree.
“Tony it’s okay, he’s safe. You can rest now.” Steve gave him a reassuring smile and sat down on the couch next to him. The scientist cuddled close into Steve’s torso, relishing in his comforting warmth.
“You really think anyone is going to willingly follow any order you give them?” Peter questioned, disbelieving.
Peter’s birthday arrived. He hadn’t properly celebrated it since Ben had died. Celebrations like birthdays had become bittersweet. They weren’t the same without his uncle and this year it was even worse. He didn’t have his aunt, or anyone, to cuddle and, well, cry with. He wanted May so bad he could hardly breathe. Which was becoming a normal occurrence for him. May Parker was his pillar of strength and stability. Being away from her for so long made him feel like his world was falling apart.
The former Lieutenant General of the United States Army, now Secretary of State, looked unhinged as he strode into the room. There was a hungry look in his eyes. He had greying hair and wore a porpoise coloured suit.
“We can do this the easy way. You tell me what I need to know. You go back to your cell. No one gets hurt. Or we can do this the hard way.” Ross decided not to elaborate. He didn’t need to. Peter knew exactly what he meant.
“That’s okay, kid, we’ll help you. Y’know Wilson? He helps soldiers who have come back from war talk about
Peter curled in slightly on himself, “I just feel like... I could have done more to save her. I know... I know that I was being arrested but... but I have super strength. I could have taken them all but I didn’t because I wasn’t thinking;” Peters breath hitched and his voice broke. “She... she could be alive right now if I had done more.”
“What’s going on? Where’s Peter?” Clint asked, eyes darting around the room and landing on the empty bed.
"Incoming video call from Thaddeus Ross." FRIDAY reported. Tony slammed his foot into his work bench in his fury.
Tony stood up, “We’ll explain later. Just go get him! I would do it but you’re the one who knows your way around the vents.”
Steve placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder, “Don’t worry, Tony, it will all be okay once he’s got over the initial shock... right now, we just need to find him.”
Clint looked over and caught Peter’s wandering eyes, “What’s going on in that big brain of yours, kid?” Peter just shrugged. The brown-haired boy rested his head on Clint’s shoulder, his eyelids drooping. “Oh, kiddo, you gotta talk to us, y’know. You can’t keep all this shit bottled up. We’re all here for you.”
"It'll work out, Tones." She gave a pained smile as she pulled her hand away to go greet the arrivals. Tony followed a few steps behind.
“Are you okay, kiddo?” Tony retook Peter’s hand. Peter nodded and inched a little closer to the older hero. Steve positioned himself in the doorway.
Downstairs, Steve and Tony sat by Peter’s bed, waiting for him to open his eyes and see he was free. The poor kid was covered head to toe in injuries. His cheeks were gaunt and his stomach concave. A nasal cannula was keeping his oxygen levels steady and his breathing was being monitored very closely. There was a tube coming out of his chest that was draining fluid from his lungs.
“After what we found last night I just want this done as soon as possible. We need to deal with the accords first.” Tony began, “I don’t want you guys and myself in more trouble than necessary. I’ve been working on it for a while but we need to produce a revised version of them. Steve, you and our friends in the raft will probably be put on house arrest, but after that you’ll be free.”
Steve turned to Tony, “Do you want to do it?” Tony nodded and stalked towards the bloodied Ross. Steve tried to guide Peter out of the room but the young genius clocked what Steve had meant.
He had spent the night thinking about everything that could go wrong. Now it was time to get ready and the teens heart was racing. Tony had hung up a smart grey suit the night before. Peter was fumbling with the tie when Steve knocked at the door.
Ross poured water over the spider-themed teen’s face. Peter, who hadn’t been expecting it, inhaled resulting in the fluid entering his lungs. He coughed and spluttered, desperately trying to get oxygen to his systems. When his vision started to tunnel, Ross removed the cloth and Peter gasped for breath only for the fabric to be replaced and more water to be poured over his face.
“Yep, exactly. I’m pretty sure I have you’re old phone someone but you’ll probably want an upgrade. That things like, historic.” Stark said as he passed Peter the latest Starkphone.
"You are being arrested for vigilantism and failure to sign the accords." Someone said calmly, driving their knee into the small of his back.
“I can assure you, a full investigation will take place and if we find any evidence of the mistreatment of inmates, the person responsible will be persecuted.” President Ellis assured the room.
“Steve, I just know it, okay?! I know, if we go now, we’ll get away with it scot-free. You’ll only be put under house arrest for at most 3 years but it’ll be less than that because as Natasha said ‘the world needs The Avengers.’”Tony pleaded.
"PUT YOUR HANDS WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM!" One of the Kevlar-Clad men, shouted at him. Peter did as he was told, not wanting to make the situation worse. He could see blood staining the carpet around May's head.
“I like you too. A lot.” Steve was sincere and he did really want to help Tony and Peter in every way he could. The war veteran gave in to what his heart was begging him to do. He leaned in close to Tony and their lips connected.
Peter grimaced, "They're dead," There was a collective intake of breath, "My uncle too. It's just me and my Aunt May." The Spider-Teen thought about the state May had been in before he'd been taken to this damned place. "I hope she's okay." None of the team knew what to say.
“Hey!” Peter laughed and pulled his new webshooters out of his pocket and fired them at Wanda, sticking her right hand to her bed’s headboard. The teen ran from the room. Wanda ripped the webs away with her other hand and chased him. They ran all over the floor before they collapsed, giggling, on the couch. Sam shook his head at the pair, but a smile graced his features. Peter’s eyes were still red and puffy, but they didn’t hold the pained expression that they had just 20 minutes earlier. Wanda put her arm round his shoulders, and he beamed up at her.
At that moment, Bean strolled in the room, searching for Peter. When the kitten spotted the familiar face he ran up and rubbed his body against Peter’s legs. The young mutant scooped up his bundle of joy and kissed his head. A look of realisation dawned on his face.
He was so stressed, he'd had a sleepless night that he was overwhelmingly worried throughout. Tony sat at the breakfast bar with his head in his hands, trying to think.
“It’s quite simple, Peter. You see, the Avengers aren’t good enough anymore. They’re uncontrollable. Even with the accords. So I’m gonna make a new super group. Completely under the government’s...well, my control.” He paced the room and told his plans enthusiastically.
“Oh, nothing, really. It’s not like he needs fingernails, anyway.” Tony stiffened. Ross continued, “I think he enjoyed his birthday gift.” The grin that spread across the mans face made Tony unsure of whether he wanted to inquire further or not.
Tony groaned jokingly, “Steve wanted to know if you wanted to do some art with him and Natasha tomorrow.”
Noise clanged in his skull, rebounding against the bone, piercing his thoughts. The super-teen pulled his hands away from his ears and looked down at his discoloured skin. He wondered if his nail would grow back or not. He had read somewhere that if the whole nail came of it could not grow back, so he could only hope they would. Every breath he took made his lungs stutter and shake within his chest. The cell was freezing causing the mutant, who couldn’t thermoregulate, to shudder, grab the thin blanket from the bed and move closer to the glass wall. Wanda’s body heat from the other side was heating him up and comforting. He craved human touch that was not malevolent.
He walked towards her voice. They had "enjoyed" their dinner and settled down in front of the TV to watch a movie before they were interrupted by an aggressive knocking at the door.
“Wake up, kid. It’s just a dream.” The ex-playboy used a calm voice whilst lightly shaking the sobbing child.
“Я спробую бути.” Peter said, but there were tears in his eyes. “I just wish you could be there with me.”
It turned out Natasha had not looked far for her inspiration. She had drawn what was right in front of her. Her drawing depicted Steve guiding Peter’s hand with his on the canvas in front of them. The Peter in the artwork had his tongue peeking out of mouth as he focused on the canvas and the Steve was smiling at his concentration.
Peter didn’t even seem to hear him. Tears were streaming down his face and he was staring at the ceiling. His mind was blank. This was all he could take. He had thought his pain was over for a brief second when he woke up in the medbay and not a cell. But that relief he had felt was gone. Replaced with grief and an extreme sadness. He had lost the one person he had left to call his family. Now he was alone in the world. Completely and devastatingly alone.
Steve felt Peter go limp against his shoulder. He scooped him up gently, being wary of the child’s various injuries.
The guard had come forward, undid the bonds and grabbed the blubbering child by his shirt. Peter was thrown into Scott’s cell, followed by a first aid kit. Scott looked confused, and then horrified by the gruesome mess of Peter’s thigh.
“These bandages have been specially developed to be worn in showers without complications. Shower as you would normally.”
He returned, decked in his red and blue spandex, he radiated with pure joy at the prospect of swinging through the bustling streets of New York.
“Well, Mr Stark, you’re not exactly young.” Peter said, truthfully. Natasha snorted and Mr Stark mocked being upset.
“I just want him to know I’m trying to save him and... and that I care about him. Because I do. I really do.” The genius’ voice broke as he confessed his feelings.
“Peter, are you alright?” He spoke at a normal level but the mutant groaned and seemed to draw in on himself further, digging the inner surface of his hand further into his sensitive ears.
“It appears he may hurt himself if you do not. Wake him up gently.” F.R.I.D.A.Y instructed. Tony moved forward, taking the boys hand, and put a hand on Peter’s shoulder.
"Boss, Quinjet 23 is approaching the roof now. Mr Rogers is requesting permission to land." FRIDAY’s voice pulled them from their thoughts.
This chapter is the longest yet, its like 2.5k words whoops. I'm very happy with it though so i hope you all enjoy, especially you Damoo xxxx
“Take him up to the quinjet, Steve, I’ll get the others and make sure Ross is in handcuffs in the next 5 minutes.” Tony said, taking charge. Steve nodded and carried the spiderling out of the room.
Hi!! This is just a filler chapter to check in with Tony and the gang. This ones super short so chapter 7 should be up in the next 24 hours
Over the next few weeks, Peter had the rest of his bandages removed and was back to eating a normal amount of food. He had spent time in the lab with Tony and remade his webshooters. Bean had settled in nicely and was hardly ever more than 10 feet from Peter. He didn’t even mind resting on Peter’s stomach when the young hero made a hammock out of webs high up in his room. Peter was struggling with nightmares, but Tony and Steve were always there to comfort him. Scott had decided to house arrest at his house so he would be closer to his daughter. Clint had stayed and had arranged for his wife and kids to come see him every two weeks. He, unlike Scott, was used to being away from his family and wanted to stay while the avengers reconciled. Before Scott had been transported home and Rhodes had to leave on military business, the avengers plus Peter had all sat down and talked everything through. Some had left after to have more intimate conversations that didn’t need to be heard by everyone. Afterwards, everyone felt lighter- like a burden had been lifted off their shoulders.
Peter didn’t have to think about it at all. His life wasn’t more important than stopping what Ross was planning on doing.
“You met Spider-Man?” Steve nodded, “Ross arrested him. He’s just 14. As you can probably tell, Tony here isn’t dealing well.”
“And is May okay? When I got arrested, they hurt her. She got to a hospital, right?”  Peter saw the way Tony and Steve’s faces fell, “Right?” Tears were suddenly welling up in the kids eyes.
"Decline it, Fri." Tony responded, shortly. He knew he was annoying Ross, but he didn't have the energy to listen to his rant about the importance of control and making sure the remaining rogue avengers were locked up.
A few FBI officials came in, saw the table full of bloodied weapons and knew what Tony had said at the meeting yesterday was true. They rushed forward and handcuffed Ross before dragging his unconscious body out of the room. Tony glared as he left. That man had caused his child so much pain and there was no way he was going to get away with it.
Ross repeated this multiple times until the boy fainted from the lack of oxygen. When he reawakened after a few minutes, his head felt fuzzy and he had to take several deep breaths to steady himself.
“Of course.” Steve opened the door and ties the fabric before pulling the boy into a tight hug. “Everything’s going to work out just fine. That bastard’s going to jail.”
The teen had been poked, prodded, injected, burned and tested on. The Secretary of State had attempted to get answers out of Peter again and again and yet the young genius refused to give in. He was determined never to, even if he spent the rest of his life rotting in the raft. That was something he didn’t want to think about.
Half a month since the airport battle, 17 days that had felt like a year. The loneliest 17 days of his life. 15 days since Steve left him, dying, in Siberia. It would be hard, getting back to how the two of them had been. Tony was willing to forgive Steve if the super soldier helped him save Peter.
“I’ll go order the pizza and let everyone know that we’re gonna start dinner in 20 minutes. There’s clothes of yours in that draw. Steve will help you, alright, bambino?” Tony asked, getting up and walking towards the door.
He looked around to yet another new environment. He was in a roughly 4 by 4 meter room. The walls were glass with metal bars across. Their was a steel bed sticking out of the wall, with space underneath it. A thin blanket was folded on top of it. The room was one of 8 in a circle, all grey and white with blue accents. An elevator was across from the room Peter was occupying. In most of them, there was a person.
hello, readers! i hope you are all staying home and staying healthy. This chapter is dedicated to Damien, HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYY <3333
“Sure, kid. Take a picture of him and we’ll use that. I doubt he’ll stay in one pose for long enough to paint him.” Steve chuckled, reaching over to stroke the kitten’s thick fur.
Clint thought for a moment and then spoke up, “You know what my dad used to say to me when I told him I was fine when I very clearly wasn’t? That fine stands for fucked up, insecure, nervous and emotional.”
“Sure, kid.” Clint said and sat down next to Peter. They sat in silence for a bit, staring out at the sunset, watching the hustle and bustle of the city below.
The towers medical staff burst in and lifted Peter gently into a stretcher. They rushed the boy back to the med bay, Clint running alongside them, not letting the teenager put of his sight.
“Your cases intersect, and so you will be working together to solve these cases,” Master Windu said. “You have an increased budget to research and travel—the details will be forwarded to your personal datapads. We wish you the best in this assignment. Update us as new information comes in.”
Tony looked up from the bench, eyes squinting in the predawn light and the streetlight that suddenly blinded him because he had forgotten he’d sat underneath one.
“The systems are pretty far away, if the kidnappers are running people to those planets and then hopping back to that quadrant. But… perhaps.”
Ste-Virn swallowed, hard, and then looked down at his feet. “I think I… jeopardized the mission, before we even reached Ryloth. I think I tipped our pilots off to the fact that there was something fishy about me, or Anotoni, or both of us. I don’t know. But we landed and we searched, long and hard, for any missing persons reports, any missing child of any missing family. We could not find anyone. None of the slavers who were supposed to be there were actually there. Then, Anotoni had… a vision, through the Force. Or a feeling. He asked me to trust him, and I did, and this was his plan.”
Needless to say, Ste-Virn didn’t know why the Council had summoned him beyond a report on his findings—something he’d been doing regularly anyway—and while… he wasn’t
Steve paused. Normally, he would trust in Fury. Then again, Fury was the head of a literal spy organization that was funded through dark money and wasn’t well known to the average American citizen. Hell, wasn’t well known internationally, either, except by countries who hated America and hated American influence.
“He’s an asshole, but he’s an observant asshole, and if he recognizes this as a SHIELD safe house it will no longer
Clint gestured expansively at himself, and then the shabby shop with two other occupants. “Does it look like we have a social media presence or anything else? It’s just us. It’s just me, a guy who has to make a living, and you, the guy that made it possible for me to keep working and pay rent int his city. So sue me if I want you to come back and chat with you again. It’s not like I clearly have the ability to market this place or try and capitalize on anything.”
“Look… Tony’s had it rough in the military. You know that, I know that, Clint pointed it out at the very beginning. He worries about us when we go out, and he has to deal with… with all of us when we come back. He has to deal with
The omega said nothing at all, following almost perfectly with Steve’s movements and steps, and Steve consciously chose to shorten his normal stride. When no words were forthcoming, Steve moved to the stairs—thanking all the stars in heaven that it was wide enough for the both of them to walk down at the same time, if only just—and continued, “In any case, this team is not going to be called on very often. Most people here are… ah. Not normal, I guess. I am not sure how else to put it. We are supposed to deal with otherworldly threats, like the aliens that descended upon New York City those two weeks ago? Anyone on SHIELD’s payroll that could possibly do so—and even a few
“Yeah, that’s a… nice way of saying it,” Tony said softly. “ ‘Rescued.’ My dad died in that cave, and I got… I got this in my chest. We were attacked with Stark weapons, weapons that made their way into the hands of people who shouldn’t have had them. My dad might not have been the best of people, but he wouldn’t have sold weapons to
Ste-Virn strode down the narrow hallway, ignoring the fact that Saark was speed-walking to keep up with him.
It felt like forever, but probably only a few seconds before he turned to face Saark. Saark was still dirtied a bit, a smudge of grease on his cheekbone.
This was not the time or place for this, and Ste-Virn looked around with sharp eyes, trying to pinpoint exactly how—
The door opened, and Clint walked and stopped, dead. Behind him, Tony stepped into the room and froze.
“You’re just going to let her get away with that?” Rumlow grunted from the floor where he was kneeling, teeth clenched.
The omega blinked silently at the arm for almost a full minute, then he tentatively moved to stand by Steve’s side, only very lightly curling his fingers around Steve’s proffered arm, barely any weight at all—clearly ready to pull away.
Natasha put out her hand, grip surprisingly strong as she held his jacket at his elbow. “Listen here, Steve. If for one minute I think you’re going to treat her like nothing more than a warm body, instead of a mediating force, I’ll fight you for team position, I swear it. Omegas in the army have it rough enough without a bad leader discounting their emotions and their needs.”
There was a soft woof, and Steve turned to see a golden retriever sitting patiently under a tree. It took a moment to realize that canine scent that was steady under Clint’s normal scent was more pronounced.
Saark’s eyes suddenly refocused, latching onto Ste-Virn’s gaze. “Then, two months later, when on a routine job to escort a diplomat from their planet to the Senate, the ship was sabotaged. No reason why. We thought perhaps it was an attack on the diplomat’s life, especially since all escape pods were malfunctioning and there was only one life support bay. It was not a very large bay, and the diplomat took priority. There was not much space left.” A hard swallow, but Saark’s eyes were cold and hard and very, very world-weary. “I suggested to my master that I could fit in with the diplomat. That I could fit in the narrow bay with the diplomat, and keep the diplomat safe.”
Steve smiled into his pillow. Maybe it wasn’t exactly how he’d prefer to get Tony to stop sleeping on the floor, but if this put Tony’s mind at ease, he was all for it. And he wouldn’t be so cold at night, which was also a blessing in disguise.
Suspicion lingered in Stark’s eyes as he said slowly, “You just want me around to capitalize on my fame.”
“Okay, hold up, hold up—for the slow people in the bunch, can you—repeat this? Make it make sense?” Clint asked.
. That he had access to the internet. That Steve had in fact given Tony full access to all electronics in the house, and Tony had upgraded their communications, had gone
Steve smiled at Tony. Tony was curled up on the bench, asleep, and it was only five in the morning on the weekend but for the past… shit, almost three months now, Tony was a regular. He waited for Steve to finish his run, walked in with Steve to the café, and teased and joked and argued about politics and shit until he was blue in the face with Steve.
On Anotoni were restraints—far more heavy-duty than any other restraints—and he, too, was wearing the blissed out expression of a spice user. He also had, around the shell of one of his pointed ears, a complicated metal contraption, almost like a sheathe for the outer ear.
!” Steve roared back, shoulders squared as he stared down Rumlow, feeling his lion curl under his skin, itch at the back of his hands as his arms grew shaggier, canine teeth elongating in his mouth and making his words distorted.
“Nope,” Clint said, pulling on his good cheer obnoxiously and smiling wide. “Just figured I’d like to talk to you. Not every day Iron Man walks into the shop, after all. You saved this city, after all, right?”
With a low, long, agonized moan, the huge section of the wall was shoved to the side, crushed like a crumpled durasheet.
, who Ste-Virn had some very nasty suspicions about—all he had seen was those two staring at Saark’s ass. He’d heard Saark discussing the different types of fixes they could be doing to prevent the extra wear and tear that was happening on their engine. He’d heard them grunt about it being serviceable enough to get them where they needed to go, and their inability to pay for costly repairs—and then Saark blithely explain that they could go much farther and do much more for a few credits worth of prevention.
Rumlow tapped his fingers against his thigh, rubbed his thumb over Tony’s shoulder. Then he looked up, eyes dark and serious. “That’s not what the army puts omegas in for.”
The first time he'd awoken, he'd been instantly blinded by harsh lights and surrounded by unfamiliar faces. He had quickly fallen back asleep when someone put what appeared to be an oxygen mask over his face. The second time he gained consciousness, he was in what he recognised to be a CT scanner. His eyes had shut almost as quickly as they'd opened.
“Cmon, let’s get out of here.” The genius tapped a button on his watch and all the barriers lifted so that the rogues could get out. “The quinjets on the roof.”
Ross looked downright crazed. His eyes were wide and he was holding a semi-automatic pistol. And he looked ready to fire it.
Hi so sorry for the wait on this chapter, I had exams and got kittens (Natasha and Dio) but here it is!
"Sorry for webbing you to the floor." Peter responded, a small smile caressing his features. Clint laughed heartily.
Tony glared. “Peter is only just 15. He’s too young to sign a document that gives away most of his freedom. That’s why in the revised version of the Sokovia Accords I sent you, I specifically added about minors being exempt. I want to also bring attention to the treatment of prisoners in the raft. I have evidence to suggest use of torture on inmates.” Once again sounds of objection rang out amongst the room.
‘PROPERTY OF THE RAFT’, branded on his skin, permanently. Then Ross had replaced the boys shirt and spelled out, letter by letter, the word ‘FREAK’ huge on the the outside of his left wrist.
"Ah, he's woken up. Good." Ross gave a shark-like smile. Barton audibly growled whilst Wanda's eyes flickered red before her collar made a hissing sound and her eyes went back to normal.
“I’m sorry, Pete, I’m so sorry.” Scott had repeated, over and over, knowing he was doing what had to be done but hating the fact he was hurting the young boy.
The roof terrace is beautiful. Most of the roof is empty but there is a designated smoking area for SI employees. On the other side of the roof, closed off by a tall bamboo fence, there is a space filled with luscious plants and a bench overlooking Manhattan. Vintage filament bulbs hang around spreading a warm glow over the space. On the bench is where Clint finds Peter. A tear is running down his cheek.
"Oh, hey, Nat." Tony said, glancing at her. She looked tired and her shoulder length red hair was matted.
Sometimes, Peter would still shut himself away in his room. Tony would sit outside the room with Steve and listen to him cry. They would try to go in the room but Peter would lock the door so they knew they weren’t welcome. When he would eventually open the door, he would act like he was fine. He would wash his face before coming out to mask his pain but his smile would never meet his eyes. He missed his Aunt May and Tony was trying to help but there was only so much he could do. So Tony called on his fellow avengers to help him get Peter to share some of his emotions.
“Oh, Peter, I forgot to mention it earlier but Helen said you’re allowed to start working out in the avengers gym now. Natasha wants to spar with you and work with you on your combat skills.” Steve remembered.
The next day, Peter had new-found motivation to work on his super-suit, so he and Tony went into the lab with Steve coming to keep them company.
The movie had finished and everyone was either already asleep or stumbling sleepily to their rooms. When Wanda had gotten up, she had gently laid Peter’s head on a pillow.  Tony’s phone vibrated in his pocket. It was a text from Helen.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Well I’ve got to be off now, Stark, I still need answers from ‘your kid’ and, well, that boy sure is stubborn.” He waved and the video call ended.
"What the fuck!? He is 14 years old! You can't put him in prison, you sicko!" He felt his blood boil and the urge to punch the screen. Tony was overwhelmed with rage and worry for the spider-kid.
“Let’s go get the others, get you some medical attention and get you all home, okay?” Steve guided Peter towards the door.
Scott held Peter close to him. It had felt good to be able to hug someone, feel their warmth and be comforted by it.
“Yeah. Um, so we’re all back together again and I just want to discuss on what terms that is being allowed to happen. So, Sam and Wanda, since you live here already, the UN wants you to be on house arrest here for two years. Steve, you’re here for 3 years. Clint and Scott, you can either stay here or at your homes for 2 years. If or when Barnes comes back, he will have a fair trial. I thinks that’s all you need to know. If you have questions ask me, Nat or F.R.I.D.A.Y later.” Tony eyed the Black Widow. “Anything you’d like to add?” Natasha shook her head. “Okay then. Play the movie, Fri.”
On my update chapter i deleted, i answered a question but its been deleted so just in case you missed my reply, Emmmmie: "Hey! So fingernails are funny things and take like a stupidly long time to grow, so they are growing back but they’re not fully back yet"
“Fucking psycho...” Clint muttered. Wanda had cried quietly in the corner of her cell. Sam had started punching the wall of his cell until his knuckles sliced open and bled.
“He’s Spider-Man. He has an increased healing factor but it doesn’t seem to be working. Been at the raft for ‘bout a month. Crazy fast metabolism.” Tony tried to explain as quickly as he could. Cho nodded and busied herself taking a blood sample from Peter.
Mostly fluff today! I think we all need a bit of fluff at the moment. I don’t hate this one so that’s good!
“What!? I don’t know how to do that!” Scott called after the man but it was no use. He opened up the first aid kit and, under Clint and Sam’s instruction, stitched up Peter’s wound. Peter had squirmed and sobbed through the ordeal until he’d, thankfully, passed out.
The two men, who had been put in the cells on both sides of the elevator across from Peter, stirred. Wanda called out to them, "Are you guys okay?" They sat up and Peter recognised one of them as Sam Wilson. The other had short brown hair, greying at the ends slightly. He had kind yet tired chocolate eyes. They locked on to Peter's.
“No, you’re fine, don’t worry about it.” The supersoldier took the push handles of Peter’s wheelchair and wheeled him the rest of the way into the avengers common room.
“I normally eat like two pizzas to myself, but I’m already pretty full so I’ll just eat a few more slices.” Peter said under his breath to Tony and Steve. He didn’t want the team to be worrying about him too much. They all knew that he was injured but he didn’t want to be seen as weak.
Tony walked over to the laptop and, brandishing a USB, pulled up the recorded  video call from the day before.
The 5 heroes reread every regulation and making changes where they saw fit, coffee and energy drinks flowing through their veins.
“Alright, kiddo, stay safe, okay?” Steve said. Peter nodded and gave Mr Stark a quick hug before promptly flipping out of the open window.
Without fail, everyday, he thought about whether or not Mr Stark was trying to save him. Every passing moment, he thought it less likely, but he likes to imagine him busting down the elevator doors in his Iron Man suit and flying Peter back home to May.
After 20 minutes of painful and loud silence, Peter had started to whimper in his sleep, clearly having a nightmare.
Clint came and pulled away a chair at the table and Steve pushed Peter’s wheelchair into the vacant space.
Peter had spoken up, “I don’t mind what we have, Mr Stark. Ms Romanoff?” Natasha looked up at him, “Can I see what you were working on?”
“C’mon, man, it’s my birthday. Just one day of peace would be a sufficient present. Please?” Ross had laughed, “ебатьвас, значить.”
“It’s not my fault.” Peter mumbled . “I just love- loved her so much, y’know. She was there for me when my parents died and then when my uncle Ben got shot. And now what?! I have no family left and...” Peter’s breath became irratic, “I... I can’t go into foster care b-but I have no family left and god...I’m so scared Mr Stark. What’s gonna happen to me?” Peter looked at Tony with all the trust in the world in his eyes.
