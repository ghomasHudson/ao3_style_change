Sighing, unable to be of use and knowing full well that neither of them were going to be able to get back to sleep Tony got up with the intention of going down to his lab to get some work done. The nano-bots were just about ready for a test run, but Helen and Bruce were insisting that Tony bring a doctor in and get a medical professional's input before he injected his body with an alien organism.
"My friends. We thank you for graciously inviting us into your home, and for participating in our sacred traditions today. There is one yet, which we will now partake. Age after age our people have partaken of the 'benubro ' a broth made from the bones of the Benu bird of our home world. To drink from these bones is to invite visions.
"I'm sorry, did you mean to dial Steve?" Tony began, gaining confidence as he went, swatting his tail against the tom's side.
Of course, since coming to stay in Stark Tower, solitude was harder to come by.
The Holiday season seemed to bring out the worst in people, including the local population of crazies. Tony wished the worst thing he had to deal with was a crazed Manhattanite at a door buster sale, but with A.I.M. fallen and SHIELD tearing their ranks apart, it's been nothing but midnight facility raids and daytime retaliatory style hiss-fits for the last week and a half.
Impressively Princess ignored the only human in the room as well as the intimidating lump of muscle staring hungrily at her in favor of greeting Tony with cool unflappable professionalism that would have brought tears of pride to Pepper’s eyes. Tony relaxed a little bit, but kept a close watch on Andre out of the corner of his eye.
“The flexibility of the coccyx bones combined with the smaller shape of the skull and the wider spread of the pelvic bones are positive indicators that we’re dealing with an adolescent female.” Helen pointed out, as JARVIS replayed the clip at a slower speed. “Her companion is likely a male, a few years further along in development, but both of them are displaying motor movement typical of those with superior muscle and bone elasticity and a lower pain threshold.”
Tony doesn't like this man, because he makes Mama bite her lip and look like she's going to cry.
"He doesn't want a Queen, he wants a puppet because they're not building us a Pride. They're trying to build themselves an army. Maybe you can't see the difference, or maybe it's just not personal enough for it to matter to you, but it matters to me. It matters to them!" Tony gestured to Bruce, Clint and Natasha who were sitting silently, watching the confrontation intently with no small amount of tension.
Tony unhooked his sunglasses from where they hung on his shirt collar and placed them back on as he prepared to make his exit, because this was all he had to say and he wasn't sticking around for more when he was finished.
"Don't you ever accept defeat Tony. A man is better off dead then down in the dirt with the dogs expecting handouts. If you want better, then you go out and you build better. If they try and stop you, then you show them that you're a Stark man."
“Hey Tony,” Steve greeted back, all soft and fond, and whatever appetite Tony had previously held for actual food slipped away as he took in the sight of him.
"And your enemies closer." Tony added with a toothy smile. The flash of teeth was a symbolism all its own and he doubted it would get lost any more than his blatant use of fel appeasement wiles.
"They're a developing thing. Like so many other awesome things.” Tony murmured in reply, smiling up at him.
He flushed, embarrassed to be getting a scolding in public but shook his head adamantly in answer. His uncle T’Baru was a brave and mighty hunter and more than that, a very kind and wise man. He thinks the world of his uncle.
' a dark voice in his consciousness growled along with a stab of irritation at his own meekness.
The Avengers chose Bruce, as his skillset wasn’t exactly the most useful in a battle game like this and no one wanted a surprise appearance from Hulk, but from the castle mount it was easy for him to shoot a basic issue stun gun and practice keeping a cool head under potentially high stress situations. Clint seemed surprised when Team Wakanda chose not to utilize Thor as a heavy hitter and chose him as flagbearer but Tony wasn’t.
“Shh. Prosti kotyonok. Derzhis'”
Another voice. A flush of new strength and the bedroom disappears, replaced by a wild forest and the sound of pounding hooves. He’s riding on the back of the volstagg Loki has gifted him, his hair whipping wilding behind him as the wind pushes at his face and he hollers into it with exhilaration.
Good Tony thought. JARVIS had to be combing every net available for a sign of him, eventually he’d come across the frequency with E.T.’s pulses so it was only a matter of when really. But there was no telling how quickly AIM would be after them. Tony needed a way to contact the team and send them their exact location. It needed to happen fast but Tony was good with working under pressure. With the right materials, he could get a message out to JARVIS.
“You’re not hearing me Rogers." Natasha said very slowly. "When he trusts you, Tony will give you everything he thinks he can, but he will never give it all. Because he believes he is supposed to be the thing standing between you and the bitter end. You throw your shield to stop the bad guys. Tony will always throw himself."
“One, I’m not stupid. I can put two and two together as well as the next guy. Two, he’s honest with me about it. He tells me when he’s missing him, and when… when my hopes and dreams don’t necessarily align with reality, but that’s okay because he cares about me. The past is the past, but right here and now, Steve and I care about each other and we aren’t hiding from the hard shit or holding back. So I call bullshit, on the Steve can’t love Tony because he loved Barnes first train of nonsense.”
Luke, whose attention hadn’t already been on Thor for some reason, whipped his head around, his arm falling nosily to the table as he stared at the blond Asgardian with a surprised expression edging toward disbelief.
Once he’d actually met Tony his confidence in the whole thing had wavered because it had looked like his worst fears had come true, Stark was all the worst parts of his father and none of the good.
“You insult me, and here I’ve come ready to offer you a gift that might solve all of your problems.”
Killian managed to knock Catman loose by literally punching him into the floor, the cement cracking beneath their feet. He raised himself up with a triumphant smile, muscles bulging and veins glowing with every movement.
It was almost too much for him to even fathom. Steve and him so happy... children. A son.
“Your dirty feet are on my console again. If your papa were here he’d tell you to sit like a lady.” JOCASTA scolded and Nyota felt the first stirrings of amusement she’d felt in hours. It still hurt to think of Papa, but Jo was totally right. He would have insisted that was no way for a princess to sit and that she was getting more and more like dad. She could almost hear him now, as if he were still right beside her.
The humming inside the little disc died out and it was still once more, going cool in his hand. Tony shoved his curiosity over the shields strange behavior to the back of his mind, in favor of soothing the panicked young fel he’d scared half to death.
Here's the last thing you need to know: among fels there is a second classification, a higher tier if you'll allow. They call them Queen Felinus, or just Queens for short. They're the pride matriarchs, the ones that bonded everybody else together and held absolute authority over pride affairs.
Tony didn’t consciously decide to test it. It was just who he was. Almost before the tom was finished speaking Tony had narrowed his focus on T’Challa, attempting to pry open his thoughts.
“Well I’m here, heading to bed like a good boy, but unless you were planning on knocking me over the head with a two-by-four I can’t guarantee you any actual sleeping will be done.” Tony grumbled as he walked past T’Challa and JARVIS opened the penthouse doors with a swish. “I don’t sleep well alone.”
"She does. How come I don't have that?" Tony pouted and Bruce's hand halted in his hair.
The exception is of course when a parent gets frisky with their kitty (happens all the time but getting stuck with progeny is the taboo part) and the kit gets stuck with the wrong set of active genes?
"Tell him that. I'll let him point out the hypocrisy." She stripped away the last of the bandages with a firm pat on his side and smiled at his flinch. Served him right.
“Morning.” Tony greeted everyone (which included Clint, Bruce and Thor) amiably, saying nothing of either his worry or his relief as he crossed the room toward Natasha. Because he rather embarrassingly needed the contact and because her tail twined with Bruce’s told him she’d let him, Tony inserted himself on her unoccupied side and smacked a kiss against her cheek.
“Did you get a chance to look at Helen’s specs?” he asked.
So far, the infiltration into AIM hadn’t dug up anything noteworthy and to all appearances, things were quiet for his teammates. Natasha was a worrying blip in the back of Tony’s mind because she’d been dark for twenty-four hours and had yet to check in, but he reminded himself that technical interference was always a possibility and if she were in any sort of real trouble she would have activated her E.T.
Yes, he and Tony are in a happy committed relationship, and no, neither of them felt they’d been unfairly pushed together. He likes Tony’s smile the best and that Tony gets his sense of humor. He has all the confidence in the world that he and Tony can lead the Avengers and expand their ranks with carefully vetted individuals, and the Avengers will always gladly put themselves between the public and those who threaten it.
(See the end of the chapter for
T’Challa inclined his head in a deferring fashion but chose not to reply. Tony had kind of figured he wouldn’t. The prince was a man of few words and seemed to have little need or patience for the kind of swaggering and showboating Tony had come to expect from his peers and had learned to master. A (very) small part of Tony kind of admired that and was envious. What must it be like to truly just not give much of a damn?
Clint rolled his eyes. Did no one read the report he did on Tony when Fury’d sent him in on that whacked out undercover gig? Do not give direct orders unless your last name is Potts or Rhodes and even then, proceed with care. He hadn’t even written that part in marker.
Because Fury just sighed and nodded, not putting up any of the fight that Tony had expected, already reaching for the button to the intercom as he said, “Have it your way Stark. Hill!”
“That seems best. I’m the worst with the details. Without Pepper I’d forget to show up. You know? Speaking of which there’s this thing I’ve gotta get done if I’m going to be on time.” Tony jerked his thumb towards the door as he backed toward it. Pepper narrowed her eyes at him suspiciously.  “Should probably throw on a clean shirt while I’m at it, hit the suds real hard, so great practice guys! Lets do this again, really. Real soon.”
"… and don't you think it's strange how it's so cold there? It's not very green at all so why is it called Greenland?"
Tony paused, looking at him expectantly. Peter’s head was spinning. Did he like it? Peter couldn’t tell. Tony moved and talked even faster in person than he did on the TV.
“Old Marley was losing his memory when we were kids Tony, he’s almost completely senile now.” Clint remarked with something of an evil grin. But he was kind enough to push open the door of his truck and Tony stepped back. “He’s got his grandson helping out on weekends now. But this is definitely not a weekend.”
The warnings are all the same as are the potential pairings.  Please see the end for additional notes.
For an anxious moment that lingering guilt held him in thrall, but then Steve's eyes found his, looked right through him like he'd replaced his eyes with blue x-ray machines and the moment and the spell broke.
For a moment he was terribly torn, and of all the things that could have come to mind he suddenly thought of that moment in his lab with Luke when he'd felt... good. So good. So sure of himself.
Natasha didn’t so much as blink, but to her credit she didn’t let the question hang in the air long.
Demon Bucky looked toward him and asked, “Howard?”
He was a good man, their Tony.
She didn’t have a crush on Barnes, of all toms. That was just ew. And no. Jaime was… well Jaime. He’d always been her best friend. Hers, not Anna Jones or anyone elses, and she just didn’t like the thought of him getting all dopey about some fel someday and forgetting all about her. Was that so hard to understand?
’. And hadn’t these people learned by now, that Tony would never heel.
Natasha’s stare bore into him with warning, and more disturbingly, pity.
Steve glanced over to the other side of the gym where Tony had migrated toward the observation booth in order to entertain their guests while the rest of the team got dressed and stretched. He was already suited up in the armor, and was currently hovering a foot or so off the ground in order to converse with those in the booth.
The tom's face fell, disappointment etched clear on his face as he considered what to say next.
“I’d like to.” Steve acknowledged. “But… I don’t know. I wanted to take him on a proper date and ask him there, but I can’t decide what he’d like. Everything just seems so… I mean he’s probably done a lot.”
He handed it carefully over to Tony, nerves jumping in his stomach and watched as the engineer gave it maybe a second or two of a look before passing it back.
“I was losing him before he fell. I could see it but I didn’t understand it and I think that’s why I couldn’t save him…" Steve confessed on a choked breath. "When he picked up my shield, he picked it up like he wanted to take on the whole world, not just the Nazis but every last one of us, and I knew why. We weren’t better than them Tony. We told ourselves we were. We called ourselves heroes and then we went home to our slaves."
for his good work.
“Indefinitely?” Jena’s voice lilted upward toward shocked. “I thought it was just till the house was renovated?”
“They were curious. Plus, Patches here reminded me that with the big scary men and having to move they didn’t get their story this year.”
Steve stepped back with a shuddered breath, the vison fading away but Tony swore he could still smell sand and beach and feel the warmth of the sun pressing down on his skin for a few lingering seconds.
So close now.
"I'm not saying it for Fury, Stark." Natasha rebuked, her gaze going a bit colder. Tony could feel the distance yawning between them though the younger fel hadn't moved. "I'm saying it for Clint."
“Because you’re possessive or because you don’t think T’Challa has our best interest in mind?”
The smile faded somewhat as the group in the booth laughed at something he’d said. Only it was more like Prince T’Challa laughed. His intimidating bodyguards didn’t look much like the laughing type. T’Challa on the other hand… the guy was looking at Tony like he was the brightest thing in the room, which wasn’t an unfair reaction to someone like Tony granted. But Steve didn’t trust the guy. He’d lied to everyone once and it was clear to anyone with ears that when it came down to it he was always going to be Wakanda’s prince first and a friend second.
Christmas finally arrives at the tower as Tony and Steve get closer. A new year is just around the horizon, and with it comes the first winds of change.
Peter swung onto the rooftop a moment later and thirty seconds after that the door to the stairwell was kicked out and Steve appeared shield raised and at the ready. He lowered it slightly when he took in Peter and Tony standing alone.
"I think flying it in from a farm in Switzerland is what makes it excessive Tony." Bruce grinned down at him and Tony's whisker's twitched his expression remaining haughty as his nails pricked Bruce's wrist again in chastisement.
"Actually I have no idea who I'm speaking to right now. Just a guy in a costume with some fancy gadgets who likes to show up late. Thank you for your help, but stay out of this."
"We need to get evidence that Killian is our guy and put him behind bars before he can kill more innocent people. You're right. I like to handle things on my own, and every time I look at the news, or the footage from the attack, I want to find this guy so bad my teeth hurt. But I can't do that this time. I'm trusting you all to do that for me, and that's hard for me to do. I need you... okay? Pepper and I are a distraction while you guys get the pay dirt, nothing more."
“My distinguished friend with the jam mustache is right,” she teased gently, pushing her own napkin toward him. “You guys heard what the Builders said. Incursions happen when two universes collide. Earth is the collision point, so if you destroy one earth you save both universes. That’s why they detonated earth 1204.”
“Alright. Lets catch ourselves a turkey.”
Tony really
"Will you have a shiny new trade deal for me?"
"Come again?" Tony questioned and Thor watched as RaTu came around the table to demonstrate, the engineers eyes going wide as the dark shining metal that covered RaTu's arms slowly peeled away, absorbed back into her skin to reveal her fur covered flesh.
“The separationist? You do surprise me Tony. I’d have thought you’d be all for Together and Equal.” Sonia mused.
While Steve would have had to be something less than human not to crave more of the peace he felt when he was with Tony, there was nothing to do about it but wait. They had to tackle one thing at a time. He couldn’t resent Tony taking care of Bruce, and there was his surgery to get through before they could talk about expanding the Pride any further.
She turned to Steve and Tony watched him tense in surprise, his face cycling through bafflement and apprehension as he took in the agonized twist to her mouth and the pleading in her eyes.
'Nothing a little love can't fix'.
It really did come down to trust in the end. Trust that their relationship was strong enough to weather the grief Steve would undoubtedly feel and the responsibility to go looking, and trust that whatever he’d had in the past, that he wasn’t just going to forsake what he and Tony were building right now.
The strange man who had appeared in the room only moments ago is gone. There’s no body. No splattered brains on the wall. The soldier is still sitting in his chair, rifle in his lap untouched. He hadn’t stood up and shot the intruder.
In which there is a small storm involving Rubber Guys, Glowy Guys, and a whole lot of negative press. Some people actually explode, but Tony would like the record to show that the exploding people are not actually his fault.
Well, Darren wasn’t wrong. Was he really going to do this? If he was, then he’d need Darren’s help and he’d have to be candid about it.
Tony wants to make real things. Big powerful engines to put in the boats his father makes, along with canons and guns that make the biggest booms (because the boom is half the fun).
Steve gripped her wrist and pulled her hand away, and Natasha thought on all the strength in those hands. How easily they could be turned against flesh to crack and bruise, and yet they could touch now with such deceptive gentleness.
Hi there, so after further developing the "trip to Asgard" portion of the plot I need to split this portion into two chapters. Which just means more story for you in the long run. I'm so sorry I haven't responded to comments yet. Work life is picking up and I'm using my spare moments to keep up with writing. Thank you for leaving them. They're great fuel for a hectic week. next week is shaping up to be just as busy but once more into the breech!
Next up: Fury is pissed but has news from Wakanda, Thor takes the Avengers on a trip, and Tony and Steve finally have that talk.
It wasn’t exactly a great feeling, but he respected her enough to give the idea proper consideration. She was right about one thing, he'd gone into this knowing how a Pride worked. He couldn't very well kick up a fuss because he didn't like it now.
Which totally wasn’t fair because Tony hadn’t actually drunk that much liquor. Not tonight anyway. But even he could admit it must have been going to his head because said head felt foggy and thick, and his tongue kept acting like it was covered in tacky glue.
From the jet, the island had looked small. Like a drop of cream in somebody's morning coffee, hardly worth the fuss that was being made over it. Steve had spotted four news choppers already circling the island, their harsh spotlights sweeping over the white tents that had been set up on the beach, a virtual city of them lit up by lanterns and fairy lights. With the long grass and the trees behind them it almost looked like some sort of fairy village, beautiful in its own strange way, but Steve found it hard to appreciate given the anxious twist of nerves that had taken up permanent residence in his belly before they’d even landed the jet.
Peter understandably looked ready to wet himself.
Steve really decided for himself that he wanted to step out with Tony (and all that it would mean to do it) Christmas eve when they’d been sitting on the couch, the remnants of the party all around them. Most of the guests had either gone to find their beds but a few had simply dropped wherever it was comfortable in the living room, on couches or in Harley’s case curled up on the floor next to DUMMY one arm hugging the powered down bot as if to keep him from rolling away.
“I’m digging under the ground while Steve distracts above,” Natasha assured him, and though she didn’t move at all Tony felt the memory of the way she liked to sink her hands in his hair and scratch his scalp like the touch of a ghost and smiled.
Enough jangling to announce Saint Nick's arrival in a reindeer led sleigh, announced DUMMY's presence as he zoomed across the room to collect the tom’s winter gear. He and YOU had been brought up to help with the party and were taking their hosting duties very seriously. Harley had strapped bells to DUMMY's sides so that he jingled with every movement and YOU, who was dropping food onto plates over at the food station, was sporting a big bright red Christmas bow.
He's tall and thin with a very tan complexion, thick glasses perched on a slightly beaky nose. He wears a funny little cap on his head that he explains is a kippah.
Tony jerks away, and his chest explodes with pain. The room dims, once more swallowed by fog and he’s falling again, the knives slicing at him and fists beating at his body. He lets it happen. Pulls further away.
It wasn’t a full bond yet for the obvious reason that Tony had to consciously open a full bond and neither she nor he was ready for that level of commitment, but whereas it had taken Tony months to begin feeling the thoughts and emotions of his teammates and the urge to open up their minds and bond with them fully – it seemed that within days of the interns moving into the tower he could feel Princess wherever she was and found himself gravitating naturally towards her thoughts.
They come to him in turns, and he follows them, draws strength in the middle of their happiest memories until they tire and another has to take their place.
“But I’m happy we can expect to see Donny again. Doing business with your son is always a pleasure.”
“Maybe one day you find a mate. Hell, maybe this dance you and Steve are doing leads to something deeper and we’re one big happy poly family. Maybe we have some kits and if you’re lucky you’ll be as tightly bonded with four or five other people as you are to me. But me, I’ll be bonded to fifty other people if we just start with the shelter kats. Do you ever stop and ask yourself what that means?
Okay we should probably get a few things straight before we go on because terminology is important, and even if Tony hates the derogatory shit that is mainstream today, it is what is and you should probably get familiar. So here we go.
"Couldn't sleep either?" Steve murmured, food cartons rustling as he presumably went back to eating.
To Tony he is always just Rhodey. Rhodey who stepped in when he didn't have to. Who always does. Rhodey who follows Tony even though he thinks he's crazy because somebody has to keep him out of trouble. Rhodey who cares.
Tony looked over to the man lying in the bed. Someone they both loved.
But Stark was well Stark and getting him under SHIELD control was a no brainer as far as gains went. Clint was being sent in to assess not only compatibility but do whatever it took to acquire a major asset for the team (for SHIELD).
Bruce finally did make it to bed. Once there he was usually guaranteed a full nights sleep. Likely interruptions were minimal once ensconced in his private rooms.
“Is he better now?” Tony asked, thinking forlornly of their search for another wounded man whose mind and body had been put at the mercy of the worst humans had to offer.
There were other words he found dancing on the tip of his tongue. For one reason or another he wanted to remind her of all the ways she was very much not a monster, how being violated in this way hadn’t changed any of the things that mattered most about the amazing individual she was. But he was sure he’d just make an idiot of himself (Clint would laugh for days if he heard about it) and in any case he kinda figured it wasn’t really the point. The point was she had been changed. Forced to. It was hard to heal from that sort of thing. Still, he hoped she listened. She did consider his words for a long moment, her eyes softening as she leaned toward him.
And of course, Steve had to be the one to lead them, never mind whatever condition his body was in. Sometimes his noble streak was insufferable, but lucky for him mostly it was charming. Crunching on her apple Natasha sauntered toward him and he stilled, watching somewhat warily as she took a hold of his bared arm.
“It’s Harley.”
Five minutes out he heard Cap’s voice come online for the first time, but when Steve ordered him to hold back he couldn’t do it, because Tony could see the facility now, the alarms blaring, the gas heavy in the air as it fogs windows and those guys in their stupid yellow suits crawling through it like insects, rounding up frightened residents and staff members alike.
Protect the child.
Then, pain splintered the wonderful dream, the soft hazy summer sun was swept away by darkness and cold artificial lights flickering dimly in the wet and dark of a small cramped space and there was unbearable pain storming through his head.
“He is the one they’d send after us,” Wanda reminded him. “This morning, I would have said I did not know if he could resist their call.”
“How long do you think, before you become my personal Fourth of July miracle?”
“Interesting.” Madame says. “Very well. We shall see if the girl is as valuable as you say.”
“That’s actually what I wanted to talk to you about Tony,” Pepper interjected pleasantly. Too pleasantly. Which meant she was about to say something Tony really wasn’t going to like, like he had to attend four days of board meetings in Tokyo or something.
"-said you weren't going to hurt him."
Still, Peter wanted to say
“Tony, I told you. I loved Bucky, and he’ll always be important but that doesn’t make what you and I have less important to me.”
Steve lay in his cooling sweat, shivering in the dark as he calmed his breathing. Tony's face floated to the forefront of his mind and his chest pulled tight with longing.
“Well it's the best I can do on such short notice Thor. You did not tell me you would be bringing your halflings with you.” RaTu (the sister Thor's mother had raised along with MiKall) tsked, the toms tail flicking as she looked over her handiwork.
“I liked the part about the elves in the chopper.” Stripes rebutted. “It makes sense that Santa would need a strike team.”
He couldn’t see the man’s eyes through the dark lenses in the mask of his costume but the guy had to be looking at him, pressed as close as they were and… staring right at him and all.
“No, of course not. Not what I meant.” Tony replied through gritted teeth. “I meant I don’t want to go back with Bruce.”
Tony was going to tell her she didn't have the slightest clue what she was talking about, but for some reason Catman flashed through his thoughts. He was the only tom besides Steve that Tony found even remotely interesting (now that Clint had taken himself off the table).
"No. It's a Greek myth. A Midgardian-" Tony began to explain, only to give up partway through with a deep sigh of aggravation. "You know what. Just forget it. The Greeks ruined everything."
“Why are they called beloved ones?” he asked.
“Tony could you really be…?” he trailed off, eyes flicking down to Tony’s stomach anxiously as if he might have grown inches there in the last couple of seconds. He still looked slightly panicked, but there was an edge of wonderment there now that made Tony’s heart thump hard.
“Meaning what, it only unlocks for the right set of prints?” Steve asked.
He wasn't scared of Debar exactly, and the scent rolling off him coupled with the body language was openly playful rather than threatening, but Tony wasn't used to people trying to touch him without trying to get something from him.
“This isn’t going to be easy, but I know who you are Stark. You’re too stubborn to give up that easily.”
As you may already have guessed the end of the Thor flavored chapters will carry us into Steve's playground which brings us to Stonyland!
Later he learns it's because Stark men always pay their debts. Tony was dumb enough to get robbed and his journal could have fallen into anybody's hands. And where does Tony think half his ideas come from? When Tony takes notes on his father's work and dreams up his little toys does he even realize what a risk he's taking? The competition would kill to get their hands on Hughard's designs.
“The Avengers will need space to grow. I’ve started with a training facility and a barracks but there should be space for other additions as they become necessary. Surrounded by water we’ll need a port for fishing and trading, as well as some sort of naval force. All of that means production Darren, which means we’ll need room for another major project. I’m calling it Stark Resilient. It’ll be an independent subsidy of SI. It will provide thousands of jobs for those who live in Resilience as well as generate revenue. What we produce on the island won’t be produced anywhere else in the world and we’ll only accept contracts from organizations and governments who prove their interest in protecting ours. So the people across the water are just going to have to play nice if they want a piece of the pie.”
“Good thing she’s not here then,” Tony quipped, but there was no malice in it. It was kind of impossible to feel anything bad with that slow lazy warmth tickling down his throat and flushing through the rest of his body. Sunshine was the perfect name for it he thought with a contended sigh. “But hey, are you saying I’m a bad influence on you?”
"Un-fucking-believable." Tony growled.
“Yes,” the soldier replies in perfect obedience. Zola smiles.
"The roof" Tony exclaimed, realization sinking in. "Cap they’ve got an aircraft!"
"Putting you through Sir."
Tony never wondered very long why he liked her as intensely as he did.
"Queen Bastet," Thor called out, beseeching the woman's back. "My friends have indeed traveled very far to seek your wisdom. Surely on this merry occasion an exception can be made?"
T’Challa blinked in surprise and Tony sighed.
“You know, I’d always hoped you and Andre would take a liking to each other. With his build and your beautiful coloring Tony, you’d have made such beautiful kits.” Sonia murmured thoughtfully, as if she’d read the track of his thoughts. There was a hint of dry amusement around her tone as she finished, “But you’d have made a terrible mother. You’re too possessive. I’d sooner try and snatch a pair of cubs from a mother bear than try and separate you from your kits.”
“Hughard! For God’s sake, what are you doing?!” mama is shouting as she comes running into the room. She's followed by Jarvis who has another bucket of water which he quickly throws on the smoking pile of metal and gears in the center of the workshop that had once been a mock up engine.
JARVIS replaced the blinking screen with a detailed map showing the guys movements over the last forty-eight hours and Tony didn't know whether he wanted to curse or laugh.
He kept sinking, the pain piercing deeper and deeper as he sunk lower into the fog. He wasn’t alone in it. There were people there, men and women in strange garb circling around him, their silhouettes just barely visible through the swirling mist. Some of them were covered head to toe in fur, others like him were more humanoid. Some sang and some chanted, the tongues as varied as their appearance.
"You are the sixth Avenger, Tony." Thor grumbled as he opened the tower room and Tony breathed a sigh of relief.
“Oh you bet I’ll be calling the police, you vile creature. How dare you come into my house! Put down my purse this minute- oof!” Her tirade fell off when Tony, having located her cellphone shoved the purse into her chest as requested and Harley came running back into the room, brandishing an eyeglass repair kit.
Back in the twenties, the government became obsessed with the idea of creating (or recreating as it were) the perfect warriors, and it was the legends of the Alurio (or cat-people if you don’t hold as many PHDs as he does) that sparked that particular line of thinking.
Jaime points toward Nyota who has abandoned sleep and is sitting up on the rug, her sleep matted hair softening the frankly murderous expression clouding her little face. She’s not an easy riser.
Tony's voice sounded cool and unbothered even to his own ears but he could feel the hair on his tail standing on end.
The medic had been assigned officially by Coulson to monitor all their new injuries, (as well as old ones in Clint’s case) but with Natasha and Tony both back on their feet now he pretty much just came to hang out with Clint and laugh at the other tom while he kicked his ass at Mario. For a super spy, Clint hadn’t seemed to catch on yet that Luke was full of shit and he was no more from an (increasingly) underdeveloped “village” than Tony was.
His harsh tone makes tears well up in their eyes and (she) feels disgust for the pathetic thing they used to be. So fragile.
never forget to check the rental for a spare tire.
"You didn't even know him." Came Steve's muffled response, his body continuing to shudder against Tony's.
It was the pride effect.
He’d known that he had better not argue and he had better not fail any of Master Starks tests.
“But he knew things about her he couldn’t have known Tony. How else did he get that information if not from me?”
What makes people wake up and pay attention (besides the obvious) is the fact that they’re stronger and faster than humans could ever hope to be, and once you throw in heightened senses you either get earths mightiest hunters or in Steve's case super soldiers.
“I might actually be able to help with that.” Tony admitted and when Steve gave him a surprised look he just shrugged. “I’ll explain later. Let’s just say I keep my finger on the superhero pulse.”
“Then we’re in agreement. You know we are. But there’s a system of checks and balances. There has to be. You can’t expect to just go out there and do what you do without answering to somebody.” Rhodes insisted, leaning forward to make sure that he had Stark’s complete attention. He had Natasha’s.
The soldier is a kat, and as such he has biological instincts that can’t be completely suppressed. They know this by trial and error. Before they realized that a sex change came with unwanted complications that threatened the mental stability of their subjects, they thought his being a fel, the female of his species, was a weakness that needed to be eradicated.
“I mean it happened how it happened. Is he really gonna hold that over my head?”
Steve’s worry washes through them as he looks to Tony who offers silent comfort. They can feel other minds doing the same, so that it pulses across the bond they all share. There are more than just six Avengers now.
Peter frowned. Master Osborne had never specifically asked Peter to keep a watch over OSCORP but Peter knew how important the serum Master Osborne was working on was. He said it could change the world. Cure illnesses. Fix it so that Kats weren’t broken anymore. Just like the bite from the test spider had fixed Peter.
They would. They focus on the spread of brightly colored blocks and the chains that link them.
His eyes were blank and dull with undisguised pain, staring into a great nothing. Thor took a step toward him, mouth opening instinctively to reach or to call out, but then he hesitated.
"That's a lifetime commitment Mr. Rogers. Make sure you're up for it." She nodded gently toward the crowded living room stuffed full of kats of all ages, colors shapes and sizes and finished gravely. "You can't split the kids in the divorce and in case you haven't already noticed, the people who break his heart don't live long."
“Miss Stark that designation no longer exists,” the ships A.I. reminded her, but the lights on the device flicker on and the console hums beneath her hands as data begins to stream down the screen in front of her. She grinned with elation.
. It falls to the Tova to see to Pride rule when the Queen is away or indisposed. Should the Queen die or otherwise become incapable of leading, either without an heir or before that heir is old enough to rule, then the Tova will ascend the throne.” T’Challa explained.
Pepper gripped his arm in a staying fashion, but a rumbling noise drew everyone's attention to Thor who was crossing his arms and looking very displeased.
*~*~*~
"It was nice, him wanting to rub everything and lay on my stomach..." Steve went on hesitantly, forking at the food in the carton in front of him but making no real attempt to lift anything to his mouth. "But after the serum it was different. I suddenly knew how much he needed me. It was intense but it was more than just physical... When he'd surround me like that I knew he trusted me... wanted me. I couldn't think of anything nicer than wearing his scent and being close to him, you know?"
Tony whirled around, repulsors raised in the direction of the voice. A breeze had kicked up, clearing some of the mist, enough to reveal the slender man lounging ever so causally upon a low hanging tree branch. Even unkempt in a plain tunic and trousers and partly shrouded in mist Tony recognized Loki and the haughty way in which he spoke.
“Stark’s here. You should know that. I told him to fuck off but Ma… well you know how she is.”
"I'm interested in knowing how Mr. Stone knows Tony's going into heat. That's not public knowledge."
The pride was just another example of that. A small hope. Terrifying in execution but worth the potential reward. Just as Steve had been affecting Tony's life long before Tony had ever actually come into it and vice versa, they'd changed Bruce's in some very defining ways. There was a web of connections running between them all that frankly had an element of divine design to it.
That was the crux of the problem. It sucked admitting when you were in over your head, when you were out of all other options but one. But Papa had taught her never to back down, and not to be afraid. Even when you saw the end. Especially when you saw the end.
[Interrupts] it’s Dr. Stark. I think if he has earned the title a couple times over, the least you could do is use it.
Yeah not good.
Sighing Tony stopped what he was doing on the counter, setting down the pot and the cup of coffee he’d been pouring with a thunk.
Swallowing back the ball of nerves lodged in his throat he squeezed Steve's hand affirmatively.
Ivan emptied the clip in the gun and reloaded with the special ones coated in adamantium – the ones his handlers said would be strong enough to pierce through Stark’s armor. He can’t waste a single shot. He’s only got two. Ivan aims and fires.
Now, four years later waiting nervously in a non-descript but comfortable meeting room on the 103
"I know you did," Tony acknowledged crossing the room to stand next to Banner who somehow managed to look the saddest Tony had ever seen him look and yet painfully hopeful. Sighing, Tony gave in to the need to be close and leaned down to wrap his arms around the brunette, resting his chin between Bruce's furry ears and letting his comforting scent surround him.
They aren’t worth shit. They know that. They never should have forgot.
Cautiously Tony began poking at it, decoding the encryption to find the messages origins. He relaxed when the puzzle unraveled without much resistance, leading back to a very familiar ship and her interface.
Rather than answer his question directly Tony looked to Natasha, pinning her with a serious stare.
“Around the time those things started to hurt.” Tony quipped, accepting the flash drive that Natasha extended in his direction with a winsome smile at their visitors. “Thank you both so much for dropping by. Come again. JARVIS, show them the door please?”
Then suddenly she flicked the object in her hand, revealing the object as some sort of switch knife, a ferocious flame burning in her eyes. Tony flinched away until he realized she wasn't looking at him but just past him, where he couldn't see no matter how he turned his head.
And then
“Honestly Darren I know it’s crazy. A free state ruled by Gata yeah right?” he swallowed through the tightness in his throat and clenched his fists under the table.
“Thor’s real.” Harley answered with a shrug. “I’ve already made like a dozen wishes. You need to hang up one or it won’t know what to leave you.”
Steve sat by the tree and let his mind wander back to the past, reveling in the fact that he could even do that now without feeling hopelessly lost or depressed.
Rhodey who is smart and knows when to hold his tongue but doesn't mince his words where it matters and is the first person brave enough to see how stupid Tony really can be sometimes (how flawed) and loves him anyway.
"Yes." Natasha replied simply without guilt or shame and Tony could have kissed her.
He damn well is.
Wanda was leaning up against the wall of the alley, her hood not hiding the nervous way she bit at her nails. Ivan made his approach noticeable. Pietro was the first to look up and spot him, tugging on his sister’s sleeve and gesturing toward Ivan with a flick of his tail.
“Get off the bridge Cap. Head for Bruce.” Tony instructed Steve over the com, as he flew under the bridge in search of just the right bolts. Finding the ones he wanted he ordered JARVIS to take the safety off on his most powerful laser and began to melt away the fastenings on the floor.
Steve tugged Tony closer, his thumb running over the inside of Tony's palm as he entreated, "That's not what this is about. The thing is, in my day the only place a guy like me in love with a guy like you could feel safe to show it was a place like this. But if they raided the place and caught you there it was a one way ticket to getting stamped and Bucky never wanted to take that risk. When he died, I regretted it. I regretted never taking the chance."
“I get it. Mommy gave you a job and you were just doing it. Really I do. Like I said, not my first rodeo with this sort of thing.” Tony waved a hand, eying a server with a tray of cocktails, desperately in need of a drink to cool off. Something to do with himself so he wouldn’t have to look at the tom and wouldn’t blurt out exactly what he heard himself blurting out a moment later.
Her groom of course wore the traditional dress of the Kǫtrdýr, sporting a kilt made of rich colorful fabrics and draped in the ornaments of his house and station, including a bejeweled collar. A more simple design than the one Queen Bastet wore of course, but it was a beautiful bright gleaming silver and looked dashing sat across his puffed breast and wide shoulders.
Steve’s cheeks pinked again but Tony didn’t miss the familiar flash of grief in his eyes that answered his question before Steve even opened his mouth.
"The people rejoiced and Namer fell to his feet before her, and asked her to become his queen. This made his first wife very jealous but Namer loved no one so much as he loved Niethotep and the children she bore him.She was queen in his heart. For herself, Niethotep was no longer thought to be a demon but was called Alurio, a child of the gods, and it was believed by the kings of Egypt who followed her husband as well as those of the surrounding lands, that so long as the Alurio were welcomed into their houses then their kingdoms would never fall to any enemy. Even one so mighty as the Benu.
The one asking the question had hair almost as orange as his fur on his tail and ears with the signature tabby stripes, so Tony was just going to call him Stripes and be done with it.
“It matters because you are a prince of Wakanda.”
Steve’s Ma had always had this old saying, about not borrowing worry from tomorrow. Which he guessed was supposed to mean not to bring on more trouble than you needed to by stressing over things that hadn't happened yet.
Robert's smile got a little more tight to match Tony's as he hummed in a thoughtfully disagreeing manner and said, like an adult explaining something to a small child, "As I said, everybody's awful grateful for what you kits are doing, but Howard should never have broken the law Tony. It wasn't fair to raise you up like one of his experiments, and the pressure they're putting on you now with this whole pride thing... Well we're all worried for you back home my boy, and we wanted to be sure and tell you that if you ever need anything you know who to call."
“Goody.” Tony replied. “In the meanwhile, we need to figure out what the hell they wanted at Oscorp so badly they were willing to break in. We need to try and anticipate their next move, before the situation gets any messier.”
“There’s a big difference between one of Tony’s practice simulations and the real thing Billy, and your mother’s still a Hydra agent. Could you really hurt her if it came down to it?” Jaime reminded him harshly and Nyota felt the words land in Billy’s chest like a blow but the younger teen just glared back stubbornly.
The neckline of his shirt was designed to plunge to just above where the scars from the arc reactor began. He was proud of the dramatic display of bare skin at his neck and unapologetic of the statement it made.
"At the time he was a mark, and for most people sex is the quickest way toward intimacy. By the time I was trying to convince him I actually gave a shit the damage had been done." Clint looked directly at Steve again and thrust a controller in his direction like a teacher might a chalk stick. " Trust me man, Stark's already told himself that all you want is his money, or his brain, or his body, or some other damn thing. He's just waiting for you to prove it. Everyone else has."
“Ivan, is something wrong?” one of his partners repeats. It’s the boy. They’re both fels. Twins. Special just as he is special. Soldiers of the new empire. But they are young and soft. It is his job to train that softness out of them.
“It’s not that easy guys. Believe it or not, ripping holes through space and time is not exactly an exact science.” Riri answered. “Even with those Avengers helping there was only an estimated fifty percent chance the machine was going to work right, but we ran out of time to improve it. It’s possible that we’re back home, but there’s no telling when exactly we arrived. We could be days before the point of incursion or centuries before we were ever born.”
Natasha thought to herself, lips moving around the memory of the old story.
“And what’s that bird called Anthony?” Mama asks, eyes twinkling fondly down at him. He smiles up at her.
“Thor, what the hell is going on?”
The blow was sharp and painful, the tom-kats claws digging through Steve’s uniform to scratch the vulnerable skin and Steve staggered back. He hadn’t broken skin though so the match was still on.
"No, Tony not for that... I don't think I've been a good friend to you." Bruce pushed a hand through his hair and sighed, looking tired but soldiering himself up despite it. "I know you don't like hearing thank you, but I don't know if you understand what it meant to me, everything you've done. Giving me a place of my own and a lab in your tower..."
He nodded toward the other side of the room and Rhodey obediently followed his gaze to where Pepper was on her phone, motioning for one (or both of them) to come to her with an altogether too professional air. Something must be wrong, but she didn’t want people to know it was wrong.
Tony had been able to create the worlds first true artificial Intelligence because he'd never been afraid of the code, of finding out that there was nothing at the bottom of the well but numbers and more numbers. Why fear it? It wasn't like boiling things down to the math made them less powerful, strange or beautiful.It's not like it stripped them of mystery, because god knew compared to even the most advanced computer system human bodies were still a universe barely tapped into.
“That’s sweet. Impractical but sweet. Helen and the doc would probably prefer not having to climb over a snarly overprotective tom-hybrid.” Tony wrinkled his nose, whiskers twitching with distaste. “We’ve got to come up with a better classification for you Cap. That makes you sound like a science experiment.”
There everyone had been, expecting Howard to finally concede to death and do the only sane thing available to him which was to make Obadiah Stane CEO. Tony had been torn between the unexpected devastation of Howards loss (Howard had never been a good father but it didn't seem to matter any where his heart was concerned) and the much more expected and appreciated rage at the old man; for thwarting Tony's chances at independence at every turn and then having the audacity to get himself killed and take Tony's mother with him.
Though some of the kats were waiting to be hand fed, Rumiko was being allowed to eat from a delicate looking china dish with silver lining. Her nails clinked every so often against the sides as she reached to tear another bite of her fish. She was well practiced at eating with her hands without somehow making a complete mess of herself, making the whole thing look elegant. Her almond eyes caught Natasha’s and the two women shared a private look as her owner simpered on.
Wordlessly one of the she-toms stepped forward with palms open. Resting in her hands was a little golden chest with intricate designs carved over its gleaming body. Smoothly she flipped the latch, and opened the lid on silent hinges and Tony’s whiskers twitched, feeling the pressure of the crowd as they pressed ever closer to see what the chest contained. For a moment he worried the reporters were going to break the guard ropes but his thoughts were quickly occupied by wonder at the gift itself.
Wanda released a small aggravated sigh, but there is a gleam of fondness in her eyes as chastising nails dig into his jacket where her arm is still wrapped around his waist.
"Is that Japanese?" Steve asked, nodding towards Bruce's book, doing his best to ignore the smug smile on Banner's face.
“Are you the mother of this child?”
“I’ve read the file Rogers. There was nothing you could have done for Barnes. Blaming yourself for something not your fault is not only ridiculously self-important, it’s self destructive. It’s like taking the knife out of your enemy’s hands and stabbing yourself with it. Stupid.”
The old woman tells him the price for the plums in English, and then mutters in Spanish that he is a scary looking brute who shouldn’t sneak up on an old woman.
“There are two exits to the building. If the police can hold them till we get there, we can block those exits and reel them in.” Tony informed the team over his comm link. He’d pulled up a building map for ViXon Technologies mega storehouse, and technically one shouldn’t fly and battle strategize at the same time but since Tony had JARVIS to steer the suit and prevent him from crashing into the side of a building or getting sucked into the jet engine he figured he was safe enough multi-tasking.
Firstly, something must be done about this virus. Secondly, something must be done to balance the team. The Pride would fail if its two key components remained at such volatile odds.
It’s trickier to sink below the surface this time. There are three of them, and his bond with Natasha is so much stronger. Clear like a well beaten path. When the lab fades into darkness all around them and slowly but surely the dark recedes to reveal a thick forest it feels natural. They are Natasha and they are small again, a child still.
“What? Tony what are you doing?” Steve asked. Tony didn’t have a visual but he could tell just by the sound of his familiar tread on the planks above that Steve had already turned with the thought of helping Natasha.
“But the broth-“ Steve began to refute but Thor shook his head.
“There’s something I want to, er− I mean, there’s something I’ve always wanted to..” he tried, but, in that moment, words seemed something too far away to actually be reached, so Steve breathed once more, loudly, and then leaned closer to Tony, leaving no distance between their bodies, and finally, fucking finally
“It doesn’t matter if he likes you back” simply replied Natasha, eating another one of Bucky’s fries with some mayonnaise from Thor’s plate, “you have to let him know before you two part for college” she continued, and really, whenever Natasha said anything it always sounded like the smartest thing ever, and Steve hated her for that so much, but also loved being able to always ask for good advices from one of his best friends.
“Why would I ruin our friendship like that?” he tried again, getting a sip of his water and trying not to look in Tony’s direction once again, because really, there wasn’t any point in hurting himself like that.
Tony broke from the kiss first, looking down and passing his tongue quickly on his now red lips, and Steve still couldn’t believe he had just kissed him, he couldn’t believe he had finally got to taste Tony’s lips. And he knew he was ready to do it again, and again, and fucking again, until Tony would let him, until he had air in his lungs, until he knew Tony’s lips by heart, until his lips tasted like Tony’s.
“Strange asked me out, you know” and really, did Tony have to punch Steve in the face just like that? Because it took all the strength in the world for Steve not to simply let his smile drop right after Tony’s words, and trying instead to pretend like he didn’t really care about that new information.
“Thank you, Thor!” exclaimed Carol, speaking like she was on stage, acting, and not eating lunch in the school’s canteen, “The voice of reason has spoken, my friends!” she added, making the rest of the table chuckle a little, except for Steve, of course, who was now too busy trying to steal glances at Tony’s table to actually focus on the conversations going on at his own.
“So you’re going out with him too?” Steve asked, trying to sound casual, while looking at his schedule to see what books he was supposed to bring to his next class.
“Why? What do you mean?” he quickly asked, trying to take a step in his direction, but seeing how Tony almost flinched back, “Tony, are you okay?” he kept looking into the other boy’s eyes, trying to find in them the answers to his questions.
, Tony actually felt something for him too, and that, had he not been such a coward, there was a chance they could have actually been together. Not that it actually still mattered, Steve knew that, because Tony was leaving in two fucking days, and there was nothing he could say to make him stay a little longer, so maybe it was better to say nothing at all, because having a little was better than having nothing. And so the party continued, more people came by to say goodbye to Tony, and, when the party eventually died out, and the only people left were their closest friends, Steve was still by Tony’s side, trying to figure out a way to freeze time and never have to actually say goodbye to the guy he had been in love with for four fucking years. Carol and Janet were the first ones to leave, promising Clint they’d come back the day after to help him clean up the place, and they both hugged Tony, making him promise to reply to their texts every once in a while, and, after the boy agreed to it, they left, clearly holding back the tears. Then it was Bucky and Natasha’s turn, and the two of them hugged Tony together, making him cry out for help, claiming he couldn’t breathe, and then, while the three of them all laughed about it, Steve heard Tony whisper a quick “I love you, guys” to them, softly, just before they hugged him again, probably telling him they loved him too. When Thor hugged Tony, Steve could see he was holding back the tears, and he couldn’t help but smile, thinking back to all the times he had been jealous of the way Thor acted around Tony, while the truth was that everyone showed affection in different ways, so it wasn’t Thor’s fault if Steve wasn’t used to people acting that way towards Tony. In the end, after Tony had also been hugged and kissed loudly on the cheek by Clint, who, instead of tearing up, had made a joke about how thanks to Tony he had to spend all night cleaning his backyard, Tony had finally turned to Steve, who was waiting for him in a corner of Clint’s backyard.
“And what about it?” he snapped, now standing right in front of Steve, and he could hear just how angry Tony was by the tone of his voice, “Am I supposed to never date again and just marry Victor only because I’ve slept with him for less than a month?” he pointed a finger at Steve, making him take a small step back against the lockers.
“So you’re okay with it?” Natasha had asked him a couple of weeks later, when it was clear Tony was now dating Strange, since they spent almost every minute together.
“Not in the slightest” he quickly replied, trying so hard not to smile, but failing, ending up laughing like an idiot, with Tony following him right after. And that was it, that was the reason why he liked Tony so much, because it didn’t matter how bad things were, he could always count on him to make him smile. Tony had that something in his eyes that made it impossible to look away from them, and his laugh was so contagious that it was impossible to not laugh along, and his smile was so soft, his voice so caring, his touch so kind, that it was impossible to not fall in love with him. And that was the reason why Steve could never really get jealous whenever he saw someone flirting with Tony, or asking him out, or showing interest in him, because he understood it, and he knew way too well that it was impossible to look away when Tony was in front of you, because Tony simply stole everyone’s attention once he entered a room, he was charming like that, and Steve had learned to love that aspect of Tony too.
“What?” was the only thing Steve managed to say, but Natasha’s unimpressed look made him continue, “I mean, no, I can’t, he doesn’t like me like that” and how sad was it to finally admit it out loud? That definitely destroyed all the hope Steve still had in him, but maybe it was for the better, he couldn’t just keep on falling for every smile Tony directed at him and actually believe one day he’d get to kiss that smile.
“He would be even more happy with Steve, I just know it” stated Carol then, and Steve looked up to meet her eyes, now smiling a bit, for the first time since the beginning of the lunch break. Carol smiled back at him, because they had been friends for years, and he knew that she had been rooting for them since day one, even if nothing was ever going to actually happen between the two of them.
“He deserves to know” agreed Bucky, nodding along with his words and trying to prevent Natasha from taking another one of his fries, but giving up after she managed to get a handful while distracting him with a peck on the lips. Steve loved to see them being a cute couple, and he really thought they were one of the best couples he had ever seen. They would not just complete each other’s sentences, which really meant they always agreed on every important topic, but they would also steal glances every time they were in a room together, and they looked at each other like there was no one else around them. But, at the same time, and that was the part of their relationship Steve liked the most, they were not the kind of couple that makes you wanna throw up because of how sweet they are, on the contrary, Bucky and Natasha were the kind of couple that was together in the little things, that valued the little gestures more than the big public displays of affection. And maybe that was the reason why not everyone knew they were together in the first place, because you actually had to know Bucky before you could understand that he wouldn’t just let anyone steal his food and get away with it, or that Natasha got really annoyed when people tried to express her thoughts for her, but that she always smiled when she heard Bucky saying out loud exactly what she had been thinking. Steve loved them both, and was really happy for them, sure, but, at times, he couldn’t help but feel a little sad looking at them, because what they had, he wanted, but couldn’t really have, at least not with Tony. And wasn’t Tony all Steve could ever dream about?
“Yeah, me too” Tony told him, and with that he turned around and started walking towards his house, that was now pretty close, since Steve had conveniently chose to stop right around the corner. He was tempted to stop him, but he was more afraid of Tony’s reaction if he had only tried to touch him again, and he wasn’t sure he’d be able to face another look at Tony’s hurt eyes without breaking. So Steve sighed, hating himself like he had never done before, and, when he felt the first tear fall down his cheek, he let all the others come down, sobbing loudly in the middle of the road, with the moon as his only companion.
The celebrations for the Fourth of July and Steve’s birthday had been fun, Steve couldn’t really deny that, and the fact that Tony had spent all night with them, drinking and chatting, laughing at Steve’s jokes and telling everyone about his break-up with Strange, well, that had been amazing. Steve had missed having Tony around, and, of course, he knew that everyone else had missed him too, but Steve thought, deep down, that feeling what he felt for Tony meant also missing him the most when he wasn’t with him. “I wish I’d dumped Strange sooner” Tony had confessed to him at some point of the night, when it was only the two of them still sitting at the table, now feeling a little tipsy after dinner, “and I’m sorry I didn’t hang out with you guys as much as we used to do” he had continued, and Steve could see that he was truly sorry for it. “It’s okay, Tony” he had reassured him, putting a hand on his shoulder and squeezing it lightly, “I know you’re busy” he added then, hearing the pain in his own words, because it didn’t matter how much Steve wanted to believe it was okay, the truth was that it wasn’t, that Steve wasn’t okay, and that it was Tony’s fault. “It’s just that I had never had a relationship that long” Tony had said after being quiet for a couple of minutes, and he was looking at the beer in his hand like he couldn’t really see it, “and Stephen is really smart, so it was easy being around him” and sure, Steve knew he wasn’t the brightest of Tony’s friends, but still, hearing that Tony had dated Strange for that long simply because everyone else was too dumb had been like a bucket of cold water right in the face. “Cool” Steve had simply replied, not feeling like adding anything else, mostly because he was afraid he’d sound too hurt or, even worse, too jealous. “Sorry, I know you don’t really care about this stuff” Tony had joked, turning his head up to look into Steve’s eyes, and it seemed like he was looking for something, maybe expecting Steve to say something on the matter, but Steve didn’t, so Tony smiled at him, a little too sadly to actually pass as a real smile, and got up to go talk with the others, leaving Steve alone at the table, with a lonely tear running down his cheek.
“And what about you?” he asked, looking right into Steve’s eyes, and Steve felt a little like everything else around them had disappeared all of a sudden, leaving the two of them alone in the world, “Aren’t you a little bummed about it?” but he put so much emphasis on that words that Steve could feel he was just making fun of him.
“Hi, Tony” he greeted him, still wearing his big dumb smile, and he could hear his own heart beating embarrassingly faster in his chest with every step Tony took in his direction.
“You don’t have to apologize” he sighed, passing a hand through his hair, and Steve noticed just how tired Tony looked, “and, by the way, what do you even care if I go out with Stephen, do you like him or something?” he added, now eyeing him suspiciously, because, of course, Tony would have never gone out with someone if he knew Steve liked them. It was ironic, really, that the only person Steve really wanted to go out with was the only one he would never actually have.
“Alright then, if you say so” he shrugged, not really looking too convinced, “gotta go, Stephen and I are skipping next period” he added then, grinning widely at Steve, who didn’t even have the time to realise what they other boy had said, before he added “see you around, big guy!”, and started running towards the main entrance of the school.
“What do you mean ‘too’?” Tony’s question shocked Steve a little, because he really hadn’t thought about the implications hidden in that little word he had so stupidly added at the end of his sentence.
“I know, but..” he started, not really sure of what he was going to say, “I’ve liked you since we first met, I couldn’t say goodbye before telling you how I felt” he tried to explain, his hands now itching to move forward and touch Tony again, hug him tight and tell him everything was going to be alright, that they had nothing to worry about.
“You’re cute when you try to deny it, Rogers” he commented playfully, stopping right outside of Steve’s classroom, “See you at lunch?” he asked then, making it sound like the most obvious question, even if the truth was that Tony had been avoiding their table at lunch for more than a month, and school was ending in less than two weeks.
“Is everything alright?” Tony asked, getting a little closer to Steve, and Steve finally stopped looking at the ground and brought his head up, facing Tony. His heart was beating faster than ever, his palms were sweating a little, and his breathing was still a bit heavy, even if he had tried to keep it under control for the past minute or so.
“Tony, I only− I’m really sorry” was all he could say, because now it was him who was fighting for his tears not to fall, because it was dumb of him to cry right now. He had been pining over Tony for four fucking years, and being rejected had always been the obvious conclusion, but actually hearing Tony say those words, well, that was fucking worse.
“Bye, Tony” he whispered to himself, still staring at the point where Tony had disappeared, trying not to think about Tony and Strange skipping class together, going who-knows-where to do who-knows-what. School was ending, and instead of trying to spend more time with Tony, Steve was only witnessing his best friend having the time of his life with anyone but him. And really, Steve knew it wasn’t Tony’s fault, he just wished they were still as close as they had been for the previous three years and a half, because he missed always having Tony around and being able to spend all his days hearing about his crazy stories and his latest projects. But maybe that was for the best, maybe Tony was doing it on purpose, because he knew just how hard it was going to be to part from all his friends once summer ended. Yeah, that was probably it, the boy was smart, smarter than anyone Steve knew, so it made sense that he was already thinking about the future, and who knew, maybe he was even doing it for Steve too, because he had found out about his little crush and didn’t want Steve to make things awkward between them. But, well, knowing, or at least thinking of knowing why Tony was doing that didn’t really change a thing, and Steve still missed him dearly, even though he was seeing him everyday right before school and, occasionally, during lunch break.
“I wanted to let you know that Tony texted me” she repeated, and, at the mention of the other boy, Steve really started to pay attention to her, “and he said, and I quote, that he ‘could never miss Steve’s party’, and added that he already bought your gift” she told him, and Steve’s heart almost skipped a beat, because Tony was really going to be at his birthday party. And sure, if anyone had told him, just a couple of months before, that he was going to doubt that Tony would make it to his birthday party, Steve would have told them that they were crazy, that Tony was his best friend and that celebrating both the Fourth of July and his birthday was a tradition, and something none of his friends would ever miss. But, having seen how easily traditions could be broken, Steve had spent the last week of June convincing himself that Tony would eventually come up with an excuse to not attend Steve’s party, and, even if that mere thought had pained him like nothing else had ever done in his life, Steve believed he’d be able to fake a smile and tell his best friend that it was okay, and that he knew how busy he was, because it was the truth, Tony was always busy, just never too busy for Steve, at least not before.
When Steve noticed that they were about to arrive at Tony’s house, he impulsively stopped walking, breathing heavily while staring at the ground, and the only thing he could think about was Tony, and how wonderful of a person he was, and just how much he meant to him, and how he could not let him leave before he told him how he truly felt. So he stopped walking, yes, and, a few moments later, Tony also stopped, turning back to look at Steve with a curious glare, because he was probably wondering why Steve had stopped there, since he knew very well where Tony lived.
“He said we think you should talk to Tony before school ends” explained Natasha, stealing one of Bucky’s fries and eating it a little absentmindedly.
“You don’t think I would know if Tony liked me back?” he asked, now a little frustrated with his friends not understanding just how painful it was to be able to see Tony smile at someone else across the room, “I’ve been crushing on him for the past four years and he never,
“No, sorry” he admitted, shaking his head a little and turning to face her, “what were you saying?” he asked her, even if he was still thinking of Tony, something that had started happening a lot more after the end of the school year.
making their lips meet. It wasn’t a perfect kiss, Steve knew it, and it probably wasn’t even the perfect way to make Tony understand how he felt, but in that moment, while his lips were on Tony’s, and the other boy was starting to kiss him back, leaving the surprise behind, Steve thought there was no other way he would have wanted their first kiss to be. His hands quickly found Tony’s hips, and he could feel Tony relaxing into his touch, leaning even closer to Steve as they shared their first, messy kiss. When Tony let out a soft moan, his lips parted slightly against Steve’s own, and Steve’s tongue finally met Tony’s, tasting what the other boy felt like for the first time, and for a moment, Steve hated himself, he hated himself so much because he couldn’t help but wonder what it could have been, had he only found the courage to do that sooner. He wondered if he and Tony could have actually dated, just like he had dreamt about so many times, and he asked himself if, maybe, Tony’s longest relationship would have been with him, and not with some random guy from his Science club. After a couple more seconds, Steve felt he was quickly running out of breath, but couldn’t imagine ever letting go of Tony, not after wanting him for so long, not after getting that kiss he had dreamed about so much. Because kissing Tony was like finding a genie inside a lamp and asking it for happiness as the first wish, and there was nothing Steve had ever experienced in his life that had made him feel that way. In that moment, with his eyes closed and his lips on Tony’s, Steve thought he was invincible, he thought every time he had been hurt in the past, every little thing that had caused him pain, he thought they had all been leading to that moment, that exact moment, when past and present were colliding, when the future didn’t seem so scary and Steve was actually, without a doubt, complete.
, showed any sign of liking me back” he added, looking at each of his friends, daring them to say he was wrong, to say that there was a possibility that Tony might actually like Steve, even if he had never shown it and was currently probably seeing someone else.
“Sure, he’s the one bummed about it, uh?” Tony chuckled, following Steve when he started walking towards his class, and grinning like he knew exactly what was going on inside Steve’s mind.
“Steve..” whispered Tony, and he took a step back, so that Steve’s hands couldn’t reach him anymore, “why?” he simply asked, and when he turned his head up to face Steve, his eyes were full of tears, and it looked like it was costing him all he had not to just break there right in front of Steve.
"Excuse me?" Tony blinked up at Barton who had perched himself on the arm of the ratty couch Tony usually collapses on after long binges when he's too tired to make it to the penthouse.
And that is how James Rhodes comes to be employed at the summer Villa, though he is only ever James to Tony's parents and those who visit the staff.
"Steve..." Tony squeezed reached for his other hand, at a loss for words and Steve shook off the cloud of grief.
Tony tapped the side of his neck where a collar might go with a rueful smile and Clint looked away, silently clenching the rubber ball in his hands.
Their archer was not in a good mood, but Thor hoped that in time, surrounded by the beauty of Valhalla and with the excitement of the Hunt that he would forget his worries.
The way the tom was looking at him felt like a challenge. There was judgment there, as if the tom knew something Steve didn’t and was holding it over his head. And Steve's nose was good. Better than most kat's even, and there was something caught in it that kept buzzing at his nerves, like he'd stuck his nose in a spoonful of pepper.
She blinked and turned back to Steve, this time speaking for all to hear.
The modern obsession with metal made keeping silent more difficult. Her claws when fully extended were sharp enough to dig through some of the softer types but metal had a tendency to tell tales when struck. It meant having to move through the rafters mostly claw free, which was challenging, dangerous, and all the more thrilling for it.
“Yes Miss Stark.”
Thor did not waste time, pushing past the two muscled tom's who glared after him in order to approach the Queen who remained with her back to them but had her head turned toward her shoulder now.
But, according to Tony a victory of the magnitude that Stark Industries had achieved in the launching of the first Gata Reserve could not go uncelebrated. On the contrary, Pepper insisted that every spare second of their time be regulated to a slew of interviews, public appearances, and whatever else she deemed necessary to control the press surrounding the historic event. Steve found it all very exhausting but thankfully he wasn’t called to do much besides staunchly repeat what should have been obvious.
“But we can’t work like that!" Steve hissed under his breath. One of the staff nurses glanced nervously over his shoulder at them. Steve did his best to level his tone as he continued to whisper. "Tony has to trust us, and we have to feel like we can trust him or this is all going to fall apart. None of us are the blind sheep kind, Natasha. That's just how we opperate.”
Tony agrees, though he has no idea what relevance that has to anything, or why it's a good thing.
“This is harder than it looks Cap!” Tony replied. “You try doing delicate demolition work with a thunder god throwing shit at you. Just keep him occupied for five more minutes!”
“I can see that.” Tony sighed, glancing around at the area of the hall that they’d finished which was dripping in evergreen and sparkling tinsel, but Tony’s eyes were narrowed on the ornaments hanging heavily from the bows, their polished surfaces gleaming under the lights. “Mind explaining why the hell there are goats all over my tower?"
"Did you know that that what I saw in my vison isn't real? Steve thinks I saw some future where Barnes somehow survived that fall off the train. In other words, some sort of what could have been."
"That's because  an unconscious baboon could build better." Tony couldn't help but sneer, even if it only helped prove Fury's point. Hammer Tech sucked. "You could build a time machine and abduct my five-year-old self and he'd be able to out class Hammer Tech."
But you’d both agree, Captain Rogers, that that’s exactly what the government designed your team to be?
“You are referring to Captain Rogers courtship.” T’Challa’s low voice drew him back to find dark eyes flecked with amber and gold staring intently at him. The tom’s scent had deepened, bringing a hint of pepper to Tony’s nose.
“You wanted the biggest construction firm in the city and Dyson is it.” Pepper reminded him as Steve’s thoughts returned over the bond, irritated and insistent.
He dives, arms stretched and fingers curled like claws and falls right into his father’s arms.
"No. I am certain it will. You are a man of many marvels Tony..."
Laura was a nice kitten (what people call a domesticated female, because it's not completely derogatory or anything) and Clint was a nice tom but she still needed her parents approval to have a relationship.
“Doctor Banner. I want to request you sit this one out.”
Tony opened his mouth instinctively to snap back but no words came out. What was there to say? He was right. It was easy in a simulation to do the math and make the necessary call, but in reality… in reality it would never have been Natasha that Tony sacrificed. She knew that and somehow a man he’d known the shortest amount of time out of anyone knew that. So why didn’t Steve? Did he really think Tony was so callous when it came to ending others lives? Well why not. Tony was the Merchant of Death after all. Steve’s seen the tapes. He’d said so himself.
“Look, can we get something clear between us?” Tony prompted, pulling the tom’s focus back from the never-ending mysteries of the Super Soldier Serum and T’Challa nodded slowly. “I’m with Steve. I don’t know how this whole courting thing is done in Wakanda but it really doesn’t matter. Steve and I, we’ve chosen to be in a relationship, exclusively with each other, so for the sake of starting fresh and building trust between all of us, I’d appreciate it if you’d respect what I’m telling you and cancel this little competition you’ve got going with him.”
It was followed by a strange low burn, like someone was breathing hotly just behind him. He knew nobody was there, knew that strange sensation was just in his head because he could see the others tensing on either side of him, their eyes darting between each other in confusion and then as if drawn there, flying back to the window and looking into the operation room.
T’Challa had finally figured out a foreign system was communicating with his ship. Truthfully Tony was impressed. His mind might function like a computer but it didn’t leave the same trail behind it – at least if Tony was being careful it didn’t. The fact that he’d noticed at all and had been able to trace it back to him was rather astounding.
“Ivan! Ivan what do we do?!” Someone close to him hisses, the edge of panic making his voice shrill. They’ve been separated from Wanda, forced back into a corner by an unknown threat in a strange silver battle suit, and Pietro never took it well when he couldn’t watch his sisters back.
They'd had to leave the city in order to find a place to land their ship where they wouldn't be noticed, and Jaime had come up with the idea of going to the cabin. It was a good idea. It was all Stark land up in those woods, and Nyota remembered it well from her visits there as a child, before the incursions and the President of the United States had fallen out with her dad because Tony had been unwilling to sell him a weapon. The ultimate weapon: the planet destroyer.
Tony looked at T’Challa, surprised to find that the other tom was smiling easily at them both. Given how snarly he and Steve tended to get around each other Tony hadn’t expected him to take watching Tony mack on another tom so well.
Okay fuck this.
She huffed with amusement, mouth tilting slightly upward despite herself once more.
You have got to be kidding me, Tony thought, gritting his teeth as Pepper beamed into the camera at him. At least somebody was still having a good morning.
"Tonight. Hemdel should be opening the Bifröst shortly." came Thor's cheerful reply and Tony nearly fell over, turning so fast.
"Your principles Hughard are going to be the death of you. I think I'll bring you boys lunch today, and give poor Ana a break." He hears Mama say and it's only then that Tony realizes Hughard must be talking about him. It's him he's bringing to the yard. Tony's heart leaps in his chest.
But all Hughard says is, “Go on. You’d better go find your mother.”
Stark men are tough. They don't second guess themselves as often as Tony does and they don't mess up the way he can't seem to stop doing.
. Steve Rogers had more teeth, and Cap wasn’t even Gata.
“Well don’t keep me in suspense.” Tony urged leaning forward, his tail twitching in anticipation. “It’s rude.”
“I know.”
Who cared if he was the best looking tom this side of the milky way (visiting alien princes not included).
The old woman who sells from the produce cart outside the one stop mart turns her head toward him, her brown face wrinkling in wary suspicion at the sight of him – a strong looking man in worn clothing that covers him from head to toe. His metal arm is hidden beneath his tightly zipped jacket, his tail strapped unforgivingly tight to his side isn’t noticeable beneath the thick fabric of his trousers and the hat he wears hides his clipped ears.
The ache in his chest is deep.
“It is not your cologne. Rather what your cologne can not hide. Captain Rogers feels possessive towards you. He’s left his mark on you rather potently.”
That was Tony down there. She knew it with every fiber of her being.
"I think this a chance for all of us to take a step back and reevaluate just what it is we're doing. An outbreak like this had to be expected. I've been told Anthony was in a very fragile condition -" Robert Stone, the self-proclaimed 'close family friend' who'd come out to speak to the media in Tony's defense was rudely interrupted by Christine Everhart, who yanked the microphone away to sneer.
To Steve he resembled one of the pirates of the stories he’d read in his youth, sexy and dangerous and enviously uninhibited. He was mesmerizing. It was hard to look anywhere else.
“It’s a lot of land but we can make the compound itself defensible.” Agent Coulson moved in the square just on the edge of Tony’s peripheral vision.
Thor very much doubted Tony had. He did not think the Benu had ever journeyed to Midgard but all things were possible.
“It’s quite alright Mr. Parker.” JARVIS answered, and Peter thought he sounded a shade warmer.
"Oh" the man raised dark eyebrows in an expression of surprise, eyes flicking to Phil. "But I thought you were collared."
“Perhaps if you are very good, I'll consider it.”
A knock tried to intrude upon his thoughts and Tony grimaced, flicking his hand to tell whatever intern (and there were dozens of them crawling all over the tower now) had gotten the wrong idea that now was a good time to bother him, to go away. Sure, he might look like he was doing nothing standing at the windows in the kitchen, but in actuality he was concentrating very fiercely on the little device in his hand.
“The company is refusing to resume labor unless we can guarantee that the project isn’t going to be shut down.”
Tony didn’t want Bruce to go, shuddered violently at the thought of letting any of these people touch him, but he bit back his protest and nodded numbly because he had no right.
"No. Just of becoming me." The Asgardian smirked. "Nobody likes a God who plays tricks, anymore than they like one who courts death. We are of a similar shade you and I... That is why I have come."
“But Tony Stark is Queen of nothing. He nurses a rabble of confused children. Broken misfits who don’t know their hearts well enough to give it, and today he will die. The Queen who barely was.”
“You should apologize to Mika by the way. She sniffled all night, cause she thinks you’re going to give her back to her old masters.”
It was refreshing that T’Challa didn’t presume Tony needed to ask his permission, or that Tony’s judgment on whether or not he was ready to attempt another bond wasn’t the best; and startling in a way he was not at all used to, having someone slice so cleanly through all of his layers of distraction to get right to the center of what was really bothering him. The man behind the curtain one could say.
"She's fine Tony. You made this room to block telepathy remember?" Bruce tried to soothe him, but Tony found it only marginally easier to breathe.
“So, the unsub was trying to help.” Bruce marveled aloud. Steve was already pinging Coulson on his comm unit, trying to get word to the policemen down below that an abduction was under way and that the gata mercenaries were not hostile, but Tony doubted he’d have much luck getting through. They had been in the middle of a ridiculously showy robbery before they decided to try and play hero.
. It was about protecting yourself."
Tony had always known that he had to share Steve with Bucky Barnes. He hadn’t kept Steve at arm's length just for his health. Or maybe that was exactly the reason why he had.  Because alright, he knows that any relationship therapist would say that you can’t own other people and real love isn’t about possessing someone else, blah blah blah. But pretty or not, Tony’s not human, and bonding is as close to owning another person as it gets. The fact remains that choosing to love Steve was choosing to share Steve.
Almost a year later, and he had come to realize that Tony wasn't anybody but himself, which probably made him the best and the worst of both his parents and more besides.
They steal their triumphs, wresting them right from the hands of their captors.
Then, she crawled onto the couch and entangled their bodies together, holding his thrashing arms and legs to prevent him from injuring himself and crooning into his neck.

"My suit absorbs energy. I could feel the vibrations when you placed it. That and you seemed more willing than usual to let me hold you."
~*~*~*~
-Hughard-
He knew it wasn't a promise he could make but he would certainly do everything within his power to help it along. Bruce refused to give any details about who he'd seen himself with because he was no fun and possibly embarrassed, but Tony had enough to work with to do his own sleuthing.
“I didn’t ask you here to accuse you. There are a lot of unanswered questions, and we’re going to need to work together to find their answers.”
"Why do you ask?"
Tony had hated them almost as much as the old man had, but kat shows were a popular past-time in the elite and good venues to rub elbows with other big-wigs, so Howard had entered Tony almost as a matter of course.
At first he didn't recognize where he was, until he took in the silver gleam of the floor and the thick glass walls (that weren't actually made of glass).  He was in what he’d nicknamed the "time out room", otherwise known as the panic room they'd built under the tower that was their best shot at keeping Hulk contained.  A bunch of medical equipment had been set up in the corner and around the bed that Tony lay in.  He wasn't surprised to find Bruce in the room with him, eyes fixed firmly upon a monitor as he kept a close eye on Tony's vitals, for it was his thoughts that had pulled him from sleep in the first place.  His and the other guy's.
“Sure thing." Sam agreed amiably, his mouth forming into a sly smirk. Steve couldn't help the slight thrill he felt at the warm weight of Tony’s arm in his, but he was perplexed by it. Thus far Tony had kept their PDA at these formal functions to a minimal.
"Serums' done most the work already." Steve said, finished with his arms and bending awkwardly to start on his torso. "Once we figure out who was behind the attack we'll need to be ready to move. We should get as much team practice in as possible while we have the chance."
Everybody should- wait where was everybody?
When Tony was a kit his parent (and bio daddy) used to tell him stories about Captain America; how despite all his disadvantages he was brave and honest and true.
Grinning, Tony directed the robotic arm to snatch up his vulnerable pieces and whistled innocently. But he was counting on Steve being too observant and too good a tactician not to notice right away what he had done. Just in case, he’d kept his touch inside Steve’s mind light but not so light that he couldn’t sense him moving things around up there.
In the past, Tony might have run with that feeling. He might have hidden behind walls and come up with a thousand and one ways to stay a step ahead and guard his heart while he was at it, but this was not the past. He’d committed himself to one very particular dream of the future, and it wasn’t going to be easy to get by any means but it meant giving as good as he got. Bare neck. Bare wrist. Bare heart. And not just symbolism this time.
Though the floor Tony had given Bruce came outfitted with all the essential living spaces he rarely did more than sleep there.
"I really have missed you Tony. It wasn't all bad was it?" The tom tried again, injecting an old sort of familiarity in his voice that harkened back to their days sitting in dressing rooms, laughing and poking fun at how stupid it all was.
“Really, all of my problems? Cause I’ve got a lot of them.”
"You've never been to my neck of the woods, but I'd like to take show you.."
Clint had admitted he wanted it and before he could blink Fury was all like “Barton, you’re going under cover” and the giant shit storm that was the Stark Job had begun.
Peter’s eyes widened. Oh wow. He’d expected that as an intern he’d be working on the bottom floor somewhere under some over worked PHD in Research and Design.
The second important point to remember here was that however unpleasant coming to grips with ones own prejudices could be, realistically it was bound to happen on both their ends, so it wouldn't be helpful in the long run to hold a grudge.
Loyalty. It wasn’t like Tony couldn’t understand loyalty, and he was still learning about the Alurio but he knew enough to know that loyalty to Queen and Pride was pretty damn not optional, but even so… T’Challa had already said it.  None of it changed the fact that Tony had trusted someone who turned out to be lying to him, and even a good reason for it didn’t reassure him that T’Challa was someone who could be trusted in the future. If anything his reasons pointed out all the reasons why he couldn’t be.
So in all those little stories Thor had told them about the Kǫtrdýr, he had totally neglected to mention how short they were. Every time he’d shared anything about them he’d thrown the word mighty around enough to give Tony the impression that they must be similarly built to Asgardians, perhaps with more fur, but generally all around huge and intimidating.
Right, that story
Tony already knew who would be there, by the scent, but pretended surprise anyway when he turned to face the Prince of Wakanda.
“Why, because you are?” he laughed, teeth flashing and T’Challa’s mouth hardened as he spoke firmly and lowly for Tony’s ears only.
Commitment anxieties completely forgotten Tony's heart leapt with excitement.
They don’t cry. Instead they bow their head and hug their knees, offering their neck. They don’t want to see Ivan hurt like that again, and they know already that the Madame is cruel.
It's not long after that when Mama wakes him up after Papa has left for the yard. As she dresses him she asks him if he can keep a secret. Tony might only be two but he's exceptionally smart for his age. He can already read on his own without Mama's help. He nods his head eagerly and Mama smiles, though Tony thinks it does not reach her eyes like it should.
Rhodey opened his mouth, about to say something when an enticingly rich scent filled Tony’s nose, his whiskers twitched from the slight air pressure of an incoming presence and his ears twitched toward the sound of someone clearing their throat just behind him.
She’s right, he realizes slowly. Tony had been unprepared for the furnace. Even just that small glimpse of the soldier’s birth had been a shock to him.  Which meant that someone else must have brought them to that place. That memory.
"Steve's an old man at heart." Tony answered with a wink and the girl laughed gaily, clearly a bit tipsy. He wondered with mild alarm how old she was. She didn't look old enough to be drinking in a night club but he wasn't going to begrudge her a night out with her beau when there was no telling what her home life was like. She Looked well cared for and her collar was well made but he wasn't rude enough to try and read her tags even though she'd left them on.
"How long have you been state side?" Tony asked the tom, smoothly filling the uncomfortable silence.
Tony all but sobbed in relief, shivering as he clutched the blanket tighter in his hands, twisting the fabric.
“In one jump?” Riri asked. She whistled low when Amory nodded.
Neither did he, Tony realized. Now that it was done there was only forward (the truth of Tony’s whole existence) and he had to make sure that things changed, that the future was better for all their sakes as well as those coming behind them. It was who he was, but he couldn’t do it alone and while he never would have predicted someone like Natasha at his side, now that he knew her he’d never change it. They’d been meant to walk the road together.
“You’re Tony Stark, aren’t you?”
Even in his distress Tony had to marvel at the technology. The energy field was circular, about two and a half feet in diameter. The red and blue bands were actually constructed of multiple lasers that were projecting out of small spokes in the hub, that when spun at a high enough velocity created an impenetrable surface. For a moment Tony was reminded of Steve’s shield and he had the wild thought that whoever had designed the thing must have been a fan. Not to mention a genius. It was basically a lightsaber on crack. A lightsheild?
But as Luke kept so helpfully pointing out. Tony was building a Pride, and that meant no more slinking off to a dark corner to (possibly) die in privacy. His team (his family) deserved to know the details, especially because of the high risk.
“Louder JO.” Nyota commanded the AI and a moment later  JOCASTA had the halls of the ARK thrumming with the sounds of electric pop, base, and the melodic crooning of Sia circa 2013. Was it weird being in a decade when one of her favorite artists had yet to burst onto the scene as the out and proud bad ass Nyota knew her to be, still hiding her features behind an oversized wig and the costume d’jour? Abso-fucking-lutely, but no weirder than anything else about finding herself in a decade before she was even born, and having to infiltrate her father’s life in order to save it.
Bastet blinked at him slowly and Tony got the feeling she was confused as all get out but unwilling to show it. He grinned.
“Of course we will. We have to. The incursions are going to keep happening either way, and it’s still our best option for escaping them.”
"What do your people say about them Debar? I'm sure there is a lot you can't learn in a history book." Natasha pressed and Tony didn't know what beef she had with the tom but there was definitely beef there.
“What because he’s a fel?” Nyota growled, bristling at the implication that Amory, even though he was naturally shy and quiet, wasn’t just as capable as any of the others. “He did awesome helping us with the portal device and before you forget, it was him who got the machine running when I wigged out and Riri had to keep me from clobbering you.”
There’s General Ross who sees what his daughter sees and wants to own it. He buys them from the college and it feels like a dream come true. Instead of mopping the floors, now they sit in a back row earning a certificate.
And what Hughard Stark never seemed to appreciate is this: Iron, is a relatively soft metal.
"I think what Tony doesn't like is feeling cornered." Bruce replied, raising his eyes to meet Steve's tentatively. "I think we all know what seems to make the most sense... but people aren't game pieces. Neither of you are ready for a mate."
He looked at her with glazed eyes and Natasha didn’t think he could see her through the haze of pain, but something in him must have known she was there because she felt his mind reaching for hers.
“I m-mean I don’t think he did. He S-shows me and Harry a lot of his stuff and I’ve never seen…” Peter fumbled to explain but he trailed off meekly when Tony tapped his phone and another clip started to play, this one showing Peter swinging onto the roof of his house and crawling into his bedroom window.
Fury snapped the screen closed with the jab of a button, mouth set in a  piqued scowl as he stared down the long table at those members of the team who weren't currently holed up in hospital beds, which included Thor, who had showed up that morning, angry to have missed the crisis.
“Bye kiddos, it’s been real. Sorry I was an ass about the stew, Luke. I don’t want to say it was better than tuna, but the body is weak. I may have to hire you on as my personal chief. Pepper has the paperwork.” Lifting his stack of files in salute Tony departed, only glancing back when Natasha’s thoughts followed him.
Tony peaked up at him as he crossed the room, eyeing the water bottle warily when Steve started to open it, “I’m not thirsty…”
“Oh, he’s something to marvel at, alright,” There was a tinge of hilarity in Pepper’s tone as she spoke, but Steve could tell she meant it, too. It was clear she loved him – just by the little things, like the way she spoke about him – and Steve was more than happy to see it. Tony deserved it.
“Mhm,” Tony hummed his assent, smile not faltering at all as he sent a quick glance up the man in question, “He’s takin’ care of me.”
By then, he’d been forced to work with Steve on an almost daily basis for nearly a month, and avoiding him was only getting harder with time. Tony could already sense his strong presence when he stepped onto the balcony, but the sound of his
And God, did he want to stall. Or just run. There was a window, after all, and he could have Jarvis send something to catch him.  But eventually, he’d have to come back. Back to square one, except this time, square one would be on fire. There had been plenty of moments where Tony was far gone enough to take off, anyway, but this wasn’t one of them.
“Yes, you did, and you knew better,” Pepper accompanied her words with a few firm pats to his bare behind before going still again, “How’d you even
“I don’t want you staying by yourself tonight,” Pepper tentatively explained, walking on eggshells in a way Tony had long become accustomed to when she was about to tell him something she thought he would oppose. Luckily for both of them, this time she thought wrong.
“I miss you a lot, sweet boy," Pepper quickly changed the subject, obviously noting Tony's subtle change in demeanor. They'd been through this a thousand times. Even once he'd started to cheer up, it only took the slightest little thing to send him tumbling back down. His brain ran at a million miles a minute and it was always looking for something to find wrong. That was a big part of his problem in the first place.
what he didn’t want in the first fucking place.
" he complained in another whine, shifting from one bare foot to another as he did so, "And I'm
"Yes'm," he answered politely, pushing the covers off of him and beginning to stand from the bed. He wanted a bath before he started his day, and he was hoping Pepper would give it to him. Before he could open his mouth to ask for that, though, Pepper was pushing down on his shoulder so he'd stay seated.
was not about to wake him up. The poor thing needed as much as rest as he could get; he'd leave it up to Pepper to wake him when she was ready. With that in mind, he moved very slowly and deliberately as he stood up, keeping a close eye on Tony to assure he stayed asleep.
stay curled up against Steve in silence and watched the movie for over another hour with no complaint, silent aside from his soft breathing; he just wouldn’t go to sleep. When the first movie ended, Jarvis played another on his own and Steve didn’t immediately have the heart to make him stop watching. It was peaceful and despite it not being progressive, they were both enjoying it.
Still, he didn't miss the way Tony's eyes lit up at the praise, nor did he miss how he seemed much more eager to obey Pepper afterward. He nearly skipped down the hallway towards what Steve could only guess was his bedroom. He was still quite teary, but he was eager to please. Steve figured with some encouragement and some time, that could become a common trait of his.
Pepper mirrored his grin, stopping what she was doing to turn around and fully face him, "Nothing but
' Tony felt his heartbeat beginning to speed up and everything started to come down on him like a train. What was he
“I told Steve I was really sorry!” he quickly tried to defend his actions, borderline panicking. Pepper wasn’t going to take hitting a Dominant lightly in any sense, no matter how far down he was. No matter what, he knew better, “And that I would never, ever do it again!”
Pepper laughed, "Sometimes, there's no such thing with him."
Tony didn't love surprises. He liked to be in the know or it usually threw him for a loop that affected his mood. This one, however, wasn't too bad.
Tony chose to be helpful over petulant, thankfully, and he lifted his head up enough to point and mumble, “There’s a fridge.”
Tony let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding, relieved. There was no room to complain about that, "Yes, ma'am."
Tony did relax for a moment but just tensed more and more the longer the phone rang. When it finally stopped ringing and the call ended, Steve bit back a groan. He didn't have to know Tony as well as Pepper did to know that this wasn't good. She was the only person who could actually
Stark for a father, that’s why,” she practically growled, bitterness and anger dripping from her words. Sometimes, Tony thought she hated those people more than him.
There were the ones who needed more attention and tough love than others, but he didn't believe there should be
The submissive frowned, squirming uncomfortably against Steve's thighs at the topic of conversation. He didn’t like talking about his past. And he definitely didn’t want Steve to know about everything that had happened to him. If he ever did manage to make it over Tony’s 30-foot-high emotional brick wall, his past trauma would send him running for the hills. He didn't want that. For the moment, at least, he wanted Steve to stay.
“Is he gonna be okay?” Steve still couldn’t help but quietly ask after he was sure Tony was out of earshot, turning his attention to the ginger woman on the screen. He didn't like the idea of leaving such an obviously heartbroken sub to his own devices for too long, but he figured Pepper knew what she was doing with Tony far better than he did. Still, Steve had to force himself to stay seated on the couch instead of following behind him.
"No? What exactly should I be worried about then?" The Dom asked, curiously amused by the fact that Tony's warning label was only getting longer.
"Of course he was," Pepper teasingly agreed, shaking her head in amusement, "Now, I need you to be serious for a minute, Tony. Everything
'A moment' lasted forever in Tony’s mind and he was just beginning to wonder if Steve left him when he heard voices in the hallway. After a moment, the sound became clearer and Tony made out Pepper giving him directions to his room. Personally, he didn't think the layout was too confusing, but he'd also lived there for a while. Another beat passed and Steve poked his head through the doorway of Tony's room. It didn't take long before his blue eyes landed on Tony's red-rimmed brown ones and he was shooting the sub an amused smile.
Pepper to fix it, even though it hurt.
Steve bit back a laugh at that himself, his guilt easing up some. A long night cuddling with the adorable submissive didn't sound half bad, even if he was periodically being a little brat, "I'm pretty sure we'll manage."
your bed."
Tony had been without a legal dominant since Pepper and her submissive/wife bonded almost three years ago. Although, Pepper still spent a lot of her time treating Tony as if he was still all hers. He didn't mind, he loved Pepper more than anything in the whole world. Their relationship was never romantic or sexual, however, and though Tony acted like he didn’t need anyone on that level, he did. He definitely did, and that’s why he acted out so badly.
Tony goes to sleep, then gets his Pepper back, then gets a spanking.
"Oh, I'm sure," she agreed lightly before continuing, "My point is, he's a huge sweetheart, and he's the best boy in the world when he wants to be. He's worth every single headache he'll undoubtedly cause you. I can assure you of that. I just... don't want whatever he does tonight to spook you."
"Uh oh," Steve muttered quietly, looking in the direction of the bathroom, "I believe our reprieve is just about up."
The words and the fearful look in his eyes had the anger bleeding out of Steve almost instantly. He couldn’t help it; Anthony was wrong and he deserved to be checked for his behavior, but that didn’t make staying angry with him any easier. He was just too adorable to stay mad. The poor thing just had a lapse in judgment was all, but unfortunately, it was enough for Steve to have to make a tough choice. This was a lesson he rather Tony learned quickly; he wasn’t going to put up with a submissive hitting him in the long run, no matter how cute he was.
he did great with him and that was part of the reason this felt so right. Being able to have Tony almost completely calmed down from his previous fit before even getting Pepper on the phone was a feat, and Steve didn't care if it made him sound cocky to acknowledge that.
"He does
more.
Overall, that was good news for Steve. He much preferred a bratty but comfortable submissive over a guilt-ridden one who was walking on eggshells trying to ensure he wasn't in any trouble. That in mind, he intended to nip the sub's current distress in the bud as soon as possible. The longer he allowed Tony's thoughts to run free, the more worked up he'd get himself. None of them wanted that.
"You need to be sleeping instead of watching movies, y'know," Steve offered nonchalantly, pressing his fingers firmly against the submissive's scalp and he pulled him against his chest. Tony’s eyes fluttered shut as he leaned into the touch, but he just made a
Tony tried to remind himself that Steve wouldn’t do that, though...At least he didn’t think he would. He may try to force his way through Tony’s guard (and apparently succeed) but he never made it seem like

Instinctually, Steve grabbed Tony before he could make another destructive move towards himself or any other property. His grip on him wasn’t too gentle as he pulled Tony further up into his lap, but a gentle touch wasn’t going to get the flailing grown man into his arm. He knew Tony wouldn’t like it, but he figured that his safety took precedence over everything else.
"You're exhausted. You have to get some sleep, Anthony, or you're not going to feel any better," she reasoned when Tony didn't offer anything else, "Do you want Steve to stay with you or do you want me to call Rhodes?"
“Everyone leaves me,” Tony responded in what was practically a whispering tone, sounding utterly miserable. Steve didn't know how to describe his demeanor besides that of an abandoned, scared little boy. He couldn’t help but hug him tighter while he continued. He wasn't sure who the

act that Tony kept up wasn't very convincing, but it clearly had been working on everybody else up until that point, which is probably why he kept it up. It was just that, though: an act. And it definitely didn't take Steve long to figure that out. But, like he'd told Tony, he wasn't afraid of him. He was prepared to break Tony's walls down brick by brick if he had to. The results would be well worth it.
Steve maybe wasn't all the way safe, but Tony didn't think he'd hurt him like that. Or at least he really hoped he wouldn't.
Much sooner than later, it was starting to hurt more than just his feelings. Tony was very sensitive, so it never took much with him; just Pepper's hands could reduce him to tears pretty quickly. It was one of many things he hated about himself, but he couldn't help it. Growing up, he got
Steve let out a genuine laugh at that, glad to hear Pepper sounding less miserable and willing to joke around with him. It wasn’t the first time he'd got to really do anything Dom-like since he came out of the ice a little over a year ago, but it was definitely first the time he got a lapful of cuddly submissive. However, he didn't voice that; he just laughed and agreed with her.
“Oh, just stargazing,” Tony’s aim was to sound nonchalant, but it definitely didn’t come out the way. He grimaced when he heard his voice squeak, and blushed profusely when Steve chuckled in response.
For the first time since he broke down, Tony peeked up enough to look at Steve. It was just so he could look at him like he was crazy, but it was better than nothing.
"Someone with a crush, it sounds like," Pepper responded, a smile evident in her voice as she teased Tony, "I doubt he meant anything by it."
to do.
"From what I'm seeing, you're doing your best," he assured her, "But you can only do so much, especially from across the country. And he's not making it easy."
“Pepper!” he exclaimed excitedly before Jarvis even finished speaking, trying to wiggle his way off of Steve’s lap. He paused for a moment when he realized he didn’t know where he was going, “Your phone? Where’s your phone?”
Tony's insides squirmed at the praise. Pepper called him a good boy all the time, but this was somehow different. This time he nearly believed it, and he wanted to hear it again. He didn't know how or why, but he

, that deep, rough voice that managed to be gentle and calm all at the same time. Even when he was upset, he was calm and collected. It was part of what Tony liked so much about him.
"That's the only time I get hungry," he defended, picking with the buttons of Steve's shirt, "It's not my fault."
“Then we’ll begin,” Pepper announced in an almost professional manner, perfecting her posture and patting his ass a few more times. Before he had time to come up with a futile protest, the pats turned into swats and he knew it was officially
And enjoy it he definitely did. Just like subs need to be taken care of, Doms need someone
Steve paused at the door to make sure Tony hadn’t followed him, but once he was sure he stayed in the bed he began to looking around. Before he could ask Jarvis for further directions, though, a tall cabinet in a corner began to glow (yes, literally
"I'm at a dinner party that I've been ready to get away from for ages," she said, smile widening again, "That's why I didn't see your first call, but no, I'm not busy."
That must have appeased him because he nodded without a second thought, eyes falling back to the phone, "I know, mama. I'm okay. Hurry up, please?"
to hear it again. Over and over and over again.
That sounded heavenly, but Tony didn't think he had the energy to do that. The spanking wore him out - they always did - and he was already running on very little sleep. Instead, he just squeezed his pillow a little tighter and whined, hoping Pepper would get the message and offer some encouragement. She knew him like the back of her hand, so of course, she knew what he wanted.
Steve had only heard about some of Tony and Pepper's background from Rhodes or others who knew the two of them closely. Their relationship was never romantic or anything close, but they were very close and she was his acting dominant for years. A few years prior, she had bonded with her new Submissive, a Dr. Helen Cho, and they got engaged not too long after that. They had to adjust their legal status, but from what he knew that was about all that changed. Pepper and her Submissive had their own floor in the tower and she still managed to spend a pretty decent amount of time with him.
“Am not!” Tony choked out shaking his head, “Bad. That’s why...'m just
"Of course, sweet boy. I always keep my promises," she assured him with a smile. Steve was glad Tony didn't pick up on it, but her eyes were definitely wet with tears. He couldn't blame her. If Tony said something as sweet and absolutely
“Hey, it's okay,” Steve comforted, running a hand up and down the trembling back before him, “Easy, buddy. I’m sure Pepper will call right back. There’s no reason to get all worked up.”
“I did something...” Tony mumbled out what he could come up with, peaking up at Pepper’s face through his wet lashes to gauge her reactions. He hated when she was mad at him and if it wasn’t for that, he probably would have kept up with the lie for even longer than he did.
"You're more than welcome to put something on the TV and watch it," she informed him with a smile, clearly used to this line of questioning, "Just as long as your butt stays in that bed. And why is it the only time you want to eat is when you're supposed to be
seriously, so Tony knew better than to be petulant. Steve
Tony felt his lips part, but he couldn’t come up with anything to say. His face was burning and his mouth was dry and the submissive in him was screaming. Nobody besides Pepper had ever checked him like this before and he was having a hard time pulling together a defense. How did he
when he's down. All he wants is to be comforted - he just doesn't know how to ask, so sometimes he acts out."
"It's okay," Steve cut her off, not really wanting to hear another word about anyone hurting Tony, "I understand. But just so you know, I would never hurt him."
So when Steve told Tony that he wasn't bad, he meant that. Anyone with eyes and a brain could see that he had been through hell. His attitude could use some work, yeah, and maybe he really needed to learn that he wasn't always in charge. A little (or a lot) more one on one attention and a sore bottom definitely couldn't hurt him, but there was still a good boy under there somewhere.
"Which movie would you prefer, Sir?" Jarvis questioned as the humungous flat screen mounted to the wall in front of them turned on. Steve nearly jumped, not expecting the bright light in the otherwise dim room any more than he was expecting the booming voice. This reaction got another giggle out of Tony, but he didn't comment on it otherwise.
Tony reminded himself, because he
favorite emotions, and being doomed to a trip over Pepper’s lap made him feel just that. He could cry and tantrum, but that would just make it worse. He could try to run; he’d probably get away, too, but only for so long. Whenever he came crawling back to his Domme’s feet, it would be
From there on out, it was like Steve was on a mission. He wanted Tony to open up, and Tony was most definitely not willing to. He wasn't necessarily happy living the way he was living, but he was safe. And that's what mattered the most to him.
"Yes, I've been starting to notice that part, too," Steve chuckled, noting how far Tony had regressed just since he started slipping down at the party.
“Do you need to use the restroom?” Pepper was asking him before he could argue. She started tidying up the couch area as she spoke, fixing whatever he and Steve had messed up, “Go ahead and do that.”
was, but unfortunately for him, it tended to be painfully easy.
in a way - Tony had pretty much associated the feeling with the end of his punishment; absolution, "We're all done, now. You can get up whenever you're ready and we'll lay up on the bed."
The frown Tony wore only deepened when Steve laughed at him, and it got even worse when Pepper denied his request, "I know you can, but I'd like to speak with Steve for a minute. Did he keep the phone from you before, or did he give it back?"
“You don’t have to come,” Tony finally forced himself to say, his own stomach turning. The submissive part of him had tears streaming down his face yet again, but his logic and his constant need to not be a bother forced him to continue to lie, “I-I’m fine, Pep, honest. If Helen needs you then I’ll-“
And just like that, it was all starting to fall back apart. Everything was okay until there was a moment like this - a moment where he was made painfully aware that his Domme wasn't really
flew in for him. He wanted to feel bad - he had like, one rough night (or fifty) and she hopped on a plane - but he wasn't about to complain. Both that guilt and his anger at Steve could wait.
“That’s my good boy,” she praised in a much softer tone then she was just previously using. Despite the fact that he wasn't happy with what she'd told him to do and how she told him to do it, those words were nice to hear. No matter how hard he tried not to, he still always wanted to be a good boy and it was always nice to hear it. Even if he didn't think it was all that true.
Tony bit his lip as he nodded, eyes rising from the phone's screen up to meet Steve's. He was still skeptical, Steve could see the slightest hint of it, but besides that, his eyes almost seemed...trusting. Steve didn't take that lightly.
Things were sweet last night – Steve knew that Tony clearly liked him more than he claimed to – but he knew once Anthony was awake, that would go out of the window. As much as he enjoyed being around the brat, he didn’t want to stress Tony out by overwhelming him with his presence. He figured it was in everyone’s best interest if he went ahead and left before the submissive had a chance to see him.
"Yes, I know, honey," Pepper jokingly sympathized, "I can see how 'not-tired' you are all the way from here. Unfortunately, it's time to rest now."
"Hi, sweet boy," Pepper greeted just as she had earlier, returning his smile. The nickname didn’t seem to throw her for a loop at all, "You feel a little better, now? All ready for bed?"
“Uh…” he couldn’t stop himself from stammering again, pulling his duvet back up some to cover his exposed legs, “…What other thing?”
a little bothered that Steve just left without even saying goodbye. Tony swore that he didn’t want to see him, anyway, and not for a while, at that. But he just expected the usually annoying Dominant to want to come bother him before he headed out. No matter how much he desperately wanted to not care, he couldn’t help but wonder

He figured wrong.
, nor had ever been, easily spooked. "I'm not scared of him. I know all you want is to protect him, and I'm so glad he has someone like you taking care of him. But I'd really like you to understand that you don't need to protect him from me. Besides, I'm honestly not even
"Where is he?" Tony snarled as well as he could, opening his eyes to look at Pepper. He didn't want to be rude in her presence, but he wanted her to know that the previous night was just a fluke and he did
It was just a statement of fact, a confirmation to Tony's self that Pepper had done exactly what she said she would - just like always. She was good for that; both keeping her word and consistency, along with hoards of other things. And from the comfort of her arms, he'd say she definitely gave a damn good hug.
“That usually works for you, huh?” Steve asked as he turned to face Tony with a smile, seemingly amused, “You just throw out a little disrespect and run your smart ass mouth and that runs off every Dom who approaches you, right? That’s what this little act is?”
Tony didn’t seem to like the easy way, nor did he seem to like the vague scolding he received. He whined louder, squirming in his hold and pushing at the Dom’s chest, “
After several minutes of even breathing and no movement, Steve began to shift Tony out of his arms and into the bed so he could tuck him in. It wasn’t too hard; since the submissive’s lower half was mostly already under his blankets, albeit messily. Still, Steve moved slowly and kept Tony’s head pressed to his chest until it hit the pillow. He stayed that way for a few minutes, awkwardly leaning over the sub before finally, very slowly, sitting back up. Tony briefly stirred, but once he found what must have been a comfortable position, he was out like a light.
. Did he already scare him off? Did Pepper say something to him?
things, I'm sure?"
Not wanting to end up alone was a lousy reason to find a Dominant according to Pepper, though. She repeatedly assured him that she wasn't going anywhere anytime soon. For the most part, Tony didn't doubt that (he did doubt that she could predict the future, though). Her argument was that he needed to find a Dom for
Hell, he had known that Steve was sad all the time. He saw it every day. He saw Steve suffering, he knew all that.
Tony didn’t know if it was his own voice, it sounded too far away for it to be. He choked on another breath, trying to find something in his vision that wasn’t blurred around the edges but came up empty.
“Tony,” he answered unnecessarily before raising his eyebrows in question.
Tony looked at Steve with his mouth gaping open. He had never felt so strongly positive because another human’s words. It was nearly as if he could feel
But maybe he might soon? Not lift a car off of him, but maybe actually
Steve ruffled through his hair before he turned to face Tony. ”I don’t think you two ever finished it. Peter complained about it. You tried to make a little robot spider. It should have been able to climb walls, I think, but you never even finished the whole schematics.”
They became fast best friends, something Tony didn’t think was possible. Well, depending that he still would leave Rhodey behind in a burning house because he meant about as much as his laptop to Tony, but he didn’t mind. He laughed with Tony, took time to explain things to him and didn’t get frustrated with him.
“Black is fine, thank you,” he took the mug with a smile, setting it in front of him to cool for a moment before he returned to the subject at hand, “I’m guessing he’s not so bad when you’re here, then?”
Steve, who’d still been lingering a few feet back, closed the distance between them. Tony was expecting questions. He was expecting Steve to demand an explanation as to why he behaved that way, but instead, he just reached up and began to run his fingers through Tony’s thick, brown hair.
“Pepper!” he breathed out, breaking out in a grin when he saw her face. His anxiety was bad on a good day, so it was unbearable when he dropped. Due to that, he'd pretty much managed to convince himself that Pepper had forgotten all about him and he never would hear from his favorite Domme again. That not being the case was a very pleasant surprise for his anxiety-ridden brain.
?" Pepper inquired, disbelief lacing her words. Steve barely stopped himself from chuckling at that; He was originally just as surprised as her. Expressing what he actually wanted was very clearly not in Tony’s nature, “Is he drunk?”
Steve wanted to skip that part. Any Dom who'd dealt with a submissive who'd been damaged like this one wanted to skip that part. It just didn't work like that. But Steve didn't care.
Much to Tony’s dismay, Pepper shook her head sadly, “Sorry, honey. She can’t get away this time. She misses you, too, though. We'll both be back for good in a few more weeks; you can show her everything then.”
“You say it’s not my fault,” Tony muttered out the answer he knew so well, sending Pepper a pleading look before he quickly added, “I don’t wanna talk about this right now. Please? Not right now.”
knew. Even when Tony was having one of his bad days and insisting that he didn't need her to stick around if she didn't want to - that he wasn't a charity case - she knew. Even though he knew better, he still couldn't help but wonder if she was only there for him because she knew nobody else would be. That irrational thought made him cry harder.
taking care of himself, Pepper wouldn’t have to go to lengths she did to make sure he was doing so. He understood that, but it was still never that easy when eating and sleeping just took up so much
“Okay,” Steve breathed out after reveling in the moment for a little longer, figuring he should get the show on the road before the sun came up, “Do you think you’re ready to get changed?”
"Okay, honey," Pepper was using both of her hands to comfort him before he even noticed she'd set the brush down, using one hand to rub the sting out of his behind while the other gently rubbed his back. He could feel a cold sweat on his skin; it made him feel gross but
you say it. So, you're probably in for a long night.”
Tony shrugged sheepishly, not wanting to explain that he was too out of it to get himself undressed. That seemed embarrassing, “Couldn't do it.”
The quicker he got all of the bad thoughts out of his head, the better. Steve knew that he wouldn't be feeling too giddy no matter what, but he still wanted to lighten the load as much as he could.
To that, Steve nodded. He would be lying if he said he didn’t underestimate her warnings, even if just by a little bit, “He’s definitely stubborn, that’s for sure.”
Tony obviously agreed, instantly whining and curling into Steve in reaction to the loud noise, "Too loud, Jarvis!"
Tony."
“Yeah, that’s what I thought,” Steve chuckled, taking a step closer to Tony, “I’m not about to dignify your bitchy behavior, boy. I don’t think it’s all your fault; I think you’ve been given up on too much, but I also think you running any and everybody off isn’t helping, Anthony.”
, this is part of why he couldn’t do this. Neither his body nor his mind was accustomed to any sort of affection, so whenever he got it he tended to go down too fast. He knew better, and he was stupid enough to allow it anyway. God, he hated himself.
"Jarvis, will you dim the lights?" Pepper asked the A.I., reaching down with one hand to get ahold of the blankets and pull the atop the both of them. The lighting was automatic; it would adjust according to whatever activity was being done along with the time of day. When Pepper spanked him, the lights came on. Now, though, since they'd be napping, the light that was coming from the random movie playing on the screen would do just fine.
”Stevie,” the man’s voice was husky, but had a warm edge to it. ”Pete wants to see his Daddy and go home.”
He had been confused when he had come back. Confused and mean, but loving Peter? It was easy. He was his child.
The funny things about emotions are, they are literally just little information drops, that get sent through the meat ball in your head when you experience things. Many people don’t even realize all of them anymore, forgetting the fact that they don’t have time in which they don’t feel anything. And he wanted that. He wanted this information slime in his brain, too. He wanted to build something and be proud of it. He wanted to look at Hammar and

“Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I’ll just stick to the cards this time.”
”Yeah,” Tony agreed nonetheless. He didn’t know what he was even saying yes to, but Steve looked so happy for a second that he was ready to make everything happen to keep it that way.
Steve sat down next to him, laying a hand on his arm. ”Hey? Can you hear me?”
Tony called bullshit, but since he couldn’t really do anything, he just went to keep staring at the doctor and didn’t turn to SR again. Life didn’t go that way, especially not Tony’s and even if it did, he wouldn’t let it.
Tony clenched his eyes suspiciously. ”And I wanted that?”
- Nick <3
”And? Have you annoyed your Papa while he was bathing you?” Bucky smiled at the boy and settled him on his hip. The boy giggled again and then looked at his father with dark but sparkling eyes.
He also had no idea what the hell was he was supposed to say to that.
Tony would love to see what Bucky would do if he ignored that warning. Would love to see if the man would lose his temper that easily. He raised in eyebrow at him before continuing. ”Those rules don’t apply to me anymore. I’m a grown up, I can stand up from the table whenever I please.”
The whole deal with Natasha was so distant, since he couldn’t really tell on what terms they were at the moment, since she did help him but then didn’t and —. It was really complicated and messy and they never really talked about it, so they just haven’t really talked ever since. And he surely won’t be the one to make the first step so that’s that.
He looked at Peter a bit closely. It was so weird, because now that he actually looked, he could see his own features there, too. Peter had definitely his nose, a lot smaller and softer, but undoubtedly his.  He had light brown curls of hair on top of his head, and his shirt had a little stain of tomato sauce, on the rim and it was also a little bit on his cheek.
”Daddy said a bad lang- language word when he woke up!”
So no, he hadn’t expect an answer from Steve, he just needed to get at least a little bit of the overwhelming weight off of his chest before it broke another hole in his sternum.
Tony was so sick of being the only person who could see that he shouldn’t be around this kid.
Steve looked down at the chair he stood in front of in question, to which Tony just nodded to give him the permission to sit.
Who the
All Rogers ever did was look sad and miserable, who the hell was he to tell Tony his behaviour was wrong?

to tell him he didn’t care about him, to make him break.
His hair was damp and there was a bit of toothpaste on his right cheek. Rogers came walking up behind him with a wet shirt, looking a bit out of breath. Yeah, Tony totally didn’t want to ever give bath to a kid, it seemed like a lot of work.
“Right this way,” he said, as not impolite as possible, which was hard, but he got better at managing it.
Tony screwed up his nose and looked Rogers up one more time. ”Wait, our bedroom was right next to our son’s? Man, our sex life must have been dead.”
Rhodey raised his eyebrows and looked at Tony with a mischievous but also very honest grin. Tony was suddenly really happy that he had kept Rhodey around all those years ago even though it was out of pure practicality.
, Wilson, I beg for nothing.”
Tony looked away from Steve, raising an eyebrow at Peter. ”After doing the dishes, Pete.”
I am also sorry that it took me so long to realize that you deserved better than me. If I wasn’t enough for you, you should have said
”I’m finished!” Peter whined, pointing at the dishwasher and then ran back to Tony pulling his sleeve again. ”Come on, Daddy, hurry.”
Not Clint, who grinned at him just as teasing as Sam. Not Natasha, who didn’t keep her head down really, just avoided his eyes as if they were powerful lasers. Not Bucky, who had quite an impressive bed head, but awake and attentive eyes, scanning his surroundings purposefully, like the trained soldier he was; even though there was a little upturn playing around the corners of his lips, as if he was excited and pleased by Clint, Sam and Tony making fun of each other constantly. And of course, who especially mustn’t know through just how much pain Tony really went in his life. Especially not the only one who knew a hell of a lot of it —Steve, sitting to Bucky’s left, gaze burning through Tony’s skin.
That’s also when it hit him like the biggest truck there was.

That was the last thing Tony heard from him for that night and yeah, it was about all he could take anyway.
A drunk asshole.
“Sounds like it sucks.”
In his defense he had called it. He’d dropped the ball. It was what he had said. That he’d do it that spectacularly, though, was something he hadn’t quite foreseen. He should have, though.
”It is not
And then Tony felt, from one second to the next, worse than he ever had before. He was
He made a decision and I cannot talk him out of it, why even try? It is in vain. So, the door is on your right, I have to drink my emotions away, because that actually works.”
“It’s nothing, Cap. I was busy.” Tony had aimed for a casual tone but missed by a mile. He hoped that Steve would pretend that he hadn’t.
“So there is something to worry about?” Steve hesitated but then sat down on the edge of Tony’s bed. “Do I need to call Banner?”
But hold on.
“That would literally be equally as break through-ish as absolutely terrifying.”
had crossed his mind more than once, but he knew it wasn’t that simple.
”I’m fine, I just —” Tony rubbed his head and then looked back up at Steve. ”Cheese ball.”
He was never encountered with so many people before and then he saw boys getting into fights over basketball and girls crying over said boys and for one tiny second he thought that he could hate that. It was the closest he has ever been to feeling something. He was still drunk when he walked into class the next morning.
He turned and faced Steve fully, banning every emotion that wasn't casual out of his expression and went for a pressed smile instead. His best defense was after all still attack.
Tony didn’t know if that made him like himself more, but who knew? Maybe he could get there. Someday. Right now, though, he had more important things to think about.
“How do you know?” Tony bit out, trying to suppress everything he felt and do what he could do best. Attack. He had yelled at his father, when he had hit him. It hadn’t helped but this had always given him something. He didn’t want to make shouting match out of this, though, he just wanted to be
Tony held the plate in Bucky’s direction and grinned hopefully, thanking Rhodey again for giving that to him.
sounded weird. It was not his name.
Tony cringed at the thought.
His escape plans faded into nothing, though, when Peter looked up from his cars, eyes beginning to sparkle in delight, a little excited noise escaping him.
one more time. ”I’ll get over it.”
He was not his Daddy. He had no idea how to be one.
Tony let them all stay in his home. Tony built their amor and weapons. Tony was polite and tried his best to rebuild a friendly relationship with all of them; but Tony couldn’t -mentally as well as physically- listen to Steve Grant Rogers. Because he knew what the blonde would say, it wasn’t a hard thing to guess.
Tony sighed and laid his head back, he couldn’t believe this was his life now.
He just wanted to be left alone, tinkering in his workshop, forgetting about everything. But they were so
Instead, though, he just stared at the kid. He saw the fire forming, one that Steve would normally already have put out by now but Tony had no idea how to.
“Well, obviously you’re not.”
What if he never remembered more and just stayed this weird shadow of himself?
Before he could think about it harder, though, he found a folder named
”I hadn’t even planned on leaving,” Tony yelled out then, weirdly feeling as if he had lost the game only he had been a part of.
So when he blacked out because he didn’t eat nor really drink anything and not because he didn’t sleep he decided that he needed to do anything. He didn’t really care before that; he didn’t eat as much anymore, no big deal? This way he could spend more time on updates for Bucky’s new arm and Steve’s shield.
Tony coughed a few times, trying to find an explanation. Trying to remember if he had seen a ring on the girl’s hand, he went home with or if he had seen anything that had pointed at her having a child.
, he had no other explanation for the way he felt around Steve but this one. It had to be love.
And it wasn’t that Tony didn’t want to think about what it meant, because of what he might find out.
till the angst hits 😈😋
What if he woke Peter? The kid needed his sleep. And frankly, Tony really didn’t want to deal with him right now. Tomorrow, yeah, maybe. But tonight he just needed Tony time.
“Thanks for asking, though, but really. I am all okay. Now look at the time, I really need to be —,” the elevator doors closed before he had to think of yet another lie. He didn’t need to be anywhere, in fact, his workshop had been
Steve looked like he was in-between spilling all the beans in existence or staying silent forever, until he took a breath so deep, Tony couldn’t help but to wonder how deep this man’s lungs were. He hoped that when his furniture wouldn’t fly around when Cap exhaled.
It went on like that. For days, till she whispered to his parents that
”Is this what you dream of? Me mourning after you?”
Tony clenched his eyes together, staring at the door as if Steve was about to walk through it and answer his question. He didn’t. Tony didn’t know if he was glad about that.
Bucky huffed and took another piece of bread and began to put butter onto it. ”There’s a kid in the house, remember?”
Rhodey hadn’t seemed to mind his behaviour when he had actually been 27, but now he just looked at Tony like he was missing something magnificent and when he had asked him about it, all he did was shake his head and pat his back as if this would make anything easier.
“I don’t like being handed things,” he said strained, trying to ignore the images of his father giving him way too hot metal, because
child.
Tony wanted to yell at Steve that he had no idea what he was, but he fell silent realizing that maybe yeah, Steve knew. He seemed to know an awful lot about him. Maybe everything.
Tony’s sight got even more blurred when he sat down in one rushed motion; it was more of his knees giving out, really.
Hanging halfway of the couch, the empty bottle in his iron grip, as if it was the only thing that could give him the hold that he needed, as if it could save him from the free fall he’s been in since he was a child.
, though. His brain only granted him a few moments of peace before it forcefully reminded him of what there was to be afraid of. Steve seemed different, but that didn't mean he was. That didn't mean he didn't still want to curl up and fall asleep against his chest, because he most definitely did. He just wished he didn't.
too long - and he'd been craving her for every day she'd been gone. He kept himself distracted to keep his mind off of it, but he was losing his mind without Pepper.
That was all the encouragement Tony needed before he was turning in her arms. He winced when his ass hit the bed, but she had him tucked away against her chest before he could complain. His ass still hurt something fierce, but it wasn't his first concern anymore. For the time being, he hugged her tightly and entangled his legs between hers as well as he could. It was a familiar position - he was usually too large for her lap - so cuddling with her on the bed was his favorite way to cry out his sorrow into her chest.
Tony was so wrapped up in his thoughts that he almost didn’t notice Steve walking away. He didn’t know much at the time, but he knew he was feeling vulnerable as hell. So when he saw Steve about to open the sliding doors to rejoin the party, he couldn’t stop himself...
Of course, he was being sarcastic. That was probably the last thing she was hearing. Nonetheless, he couldn't help but be glad that Tony had brought him up to her at all. No matter what Tony was telling her, that had to count for something.
“I know you don’t, Tone,” she comforted softly, even as she tugged his briefs down to his knees with his pants, “I don’t either, but unfortunately we have to because of some decisions you made while I was gone.”
didn’t like it when she was angry with him, “I understand this is hard for you, but you didn’t seem to have a problem going behind my back and doing it, so you shouldn’t have a problem admitting it to me.”
gonna end up cuddling him again. Steve figured he could just treat this as a timeout of sorts, but he already knew better than to think Tony would be crying himself to sleep alone in his bed.
Helplessness was by far one of Tony’s
Tony knew her well enough to see her fight a smile, but it was quickly replaced with a displeased scowl. She didn't seem as amused now, “I think you know what
with him. It was so easy to be a dick towards everybody else because almost everybody else was always a dick to him. Steve, on the other hand, was different. That's why he tried his best to avoid him, so he didn't fall into a situation like the one he was currently in.
“Ms. Potts tried to get through on Mr. Stark’s phone, but it seems he’s smashed it. I explained the situation to her and she’d like to call your phone so she can speak with Mr. Stark immediately. Is that okay?” Jarvis asked, causing Tony to beam.
"Pepper!" was all Tony breathed out, reaching his arms out for her and engulfing her in a hug as well as he could from his bed, "You're here."
"You're gonna talk about me," Tony grumbled, some of his usual attitude starting to return to him even as he forced himself to sit up. He was still pretty far down, but he was coming up a little bit, or maybe he was just more comfortable with his surroundings (or just Steve, really). As that was happening, a little bit more of him was shining through. He was a much sweeter boy than what he usually pretended to be, and he had a great heart, but he was still kind of a brat.
. He didn’t care about stupid fucking Steve. He was still just kind of emotional, was all. It would pass with time.
"Mama, no!" Tony howled, quivering at the thought. His Pepper didn't paddle him very often - only for big stuff, but he figured this
was what he wanted from him. He didn't show any of the warning signs Tony wished to God he would have saw in the other guys in the past. No, Steve was a good guy. He wouldn't do that.
Steve’s eyes weren’t angry or annoyed as they bored into Tony’s, but they held a certain air of... determination. That scared Tony, but it made him want to submit even fucking more. Nobody had ever even made it this far past Tony's defense. No one had ever bothered to try.
Tony made a face at that but forced himself to nod. He knew that would be coming soon. As much as he wanted to just stay on the phone with her for the entire six-hour flight, he knew that wasn't realistic and he was about to have to say goodbye. Even if it was only until morning, he still wasn't thrilled.
, he wasn’t going to hit him for anything. He still knew that was a high hope, but he could dream.
With the way he’d seen Tony behave prior to their moment on the balcony, it shouldn’t have been such a hard pill for him to swallow, but it was near impossible to believe that the sweetheart who’d just been curled up in his lap could possibly be such a brat that offering a simple apology was so far out of his character. Steve supposed there was even more of Tony to learn than he originally thought. Still, deep down, Steve felt good and proud of his ability to get a scared and untrusting submissive to want to connect when he was hardly even trying.
him if he was alone, so he accepted it. Well, until he met Steve. Steve was a different story.
“Right,” the man laughed, stepping forward so he could lean against the railing next to Tony, “Seems like you're avoiding your own party to me.”
He shrugged, nonchalant with his words, "I do it all the time."
Steve looked smug when he turned back around, almost like he was expecting it, and that made the brat in Tony almost flare up again. He wanted to turn around and say never mind, to snap at him and tell him to just go away. And he fully intended to, too, but then Steve spoke.
“Thanks,” Tony breathed out softly, his previous ‘
good," Pepper reminded him, patting his butt with the hairbrush a few times in a way that made Tony squirm, but also pay attention, "You need your reminders sometimes, but you're the best boy. We're gonna finish this lesson up, now, so we can put this behind this and I can cuddle my baby boy. I know you've been listening and you'll work harder to do better in the future, right? You've learned your lesson."
she was being told. It seemed like the perfect plan and since so long had passed since Tony executed it, he was sure it
Tony, who was still very much curled up in Steve's lap, visibly deflated after the phone call ended. He continued to stare at the screen of Steve's phone for several quiet moments, looking utterly forlorn, but he didn't make a move to throw a tantrum. There was yet another beat of silence before he let out a shaky sigh and finally handed Steve back his phone. His eyes were wet with fresh tears when he looked up at him and politely asked, "Can I watch TV, please?"
“You can have a few more moments of
His tone became much more sullen as he addressed her inevitable departure, squirming a little against Steve's thighs. He'd been dealing pretty well, but the reality was likely setting in and he obviously still wasn't too comfortable with it. Steve didn't expect him to be, and since he knew the inevitable was approaching, he began to prepare himself for whatever the fall back would be. Hopefully, not too catastrophic. He was coping well so far, so Steve hoped that would continue until he got him to sleep.
Pepper was more than used to that type of change in demeanor from him and she adjusted accordingly, "I miss you, too, honey. Just a few more weeks and we'll be back."
silly boy?"
The helplessness that came with this is what he hated the most. As long as he’d been alive, he never managed to get over that. Even though he trusted Pepper with his life and then some, handing over complete control and submitting to something so painful was still
Tony’s breath hitched at the sound of Steve’s voice.
