“Well?” She asked, Tony full well knowing what she was asking. Tony just shrugged and looked out the window. It was dusk and quickly turning into night. He quietly slipped his wedding ring off his finger and dropped it into his pocket.
The omegas face was pink, his lips wet and his eyes a deep brown color. Darker than Strange had ever seen them. Strange quickly shoved all his feelings down, this wasn’t the time or place. He wouldn’t be like everyone else here, he wouldn’t take advantage.
. Carol was the first to break through Stephen’s hard-shell exterior. Jan had run to Tony in absolute glee that she saw Stephen crack a smile during a meeting at SHIELD. Carol was making light but petty comments under her breath as Steve was going on a monologue about trust between the teams. The irony escaped
Tony still kept radio silence with his old pack, not telling them where he was or about Little Peanut. Who was making his presence known. It had been only four months and Tony was starting to show if he lifted his shirt. The morning sickness came but it wasn’t terrible. The omega usually just ate some crackers before attempting to get out of bed and that seemed to do the trick so far.
Tony was also a sucker for his salt and pepper hair. Stephen was handsome. Tony had thought so since the first moment he had seen him on campus. His eyes never left the books in front of him. Even if Tony did attempt to catch the alpha’s eye once or twice before giving up. And Stephen now,
He reluctantly reached into his leather coat pocket and pulled out a small silver piece of metal, it was round and very compact, almost like a very advanced Bluetooth set. She took it, her snug smile never leaving her face.
no promises on regular updates cuz ya know I work to pay off my student debt osdjfldjfjslj so but I AM BACK!!!!!!!!!! tell me what you think I feel so rusty aaaahhhh.
“Shit! They hit one of my-” Tony yelled as he jerked in the air, one of his boots letting off black smoke. Jan’s heart started to jump out of her chest, her fear skyrocketing. Jan could finally see what these pests were doing. Divide, distract,
“Tony.” Natasha said softly, her eyes also wet when Tony’s own met hers. Tony looked at her and the sadness in her eyes made Tony
Strange was surprised to see Stark walk into his math class. It was a senior level class. Mostly everybody here was 21 and they were sending this kid in? Tony didn’t have a problem with the math, no, he was even correcting and helping their professor once in a while. It was his so-called peers. They belittled the omega every chance they got. Talking to him like a child, and Strange could see how angry it made Stark.
“You look so good on my cock, sweetheart. You feel so fucking good.” Steve moaned, his hands urging Tony’s hips to move faster. Tony could feel the sweat on his own skin and Steve’s as he kept working his hips. Watching Steve’s lips move with pleasure, let out deep moans and talking so sweet that Steve’s mere whispers caused Tony to tremble.
The streets were in a panic, people running inside or pointing up at the obvious alien invasion. Tony was cursing himself for not bringing his suit or his under suit with his nano armor. Tony growls at himself for leaving it home because he didn’t want to shoot Steve or Bucky in the face on sight at his
She was shaking him and shouting something. Every time she spoke the ringing in his ears kept getting louder. Now Bucky was by his side, shaking him more gently but trying to get his attention as well.
, not sad. Not something to be pitied. Jan threw herself on Tony again and hugged him so tightly Tony wouldn’t breathe.
to Tony. Tony would never admit it to anyone, not even himself; but the omega needed an alpha’s support as he tried to recover from Steve. Tony could feel himself develop feelings for the alpha. Tony was also doing everything he could to smother those feelings. It wasn’t the time, and fair to neither alpha nor omega.
with Bucky. They never separated, the alpha and omega didn’t consent to being separated. It had just been a sick fucked up series of events. Steve spending years in the bottom of some ocean, and Bucky being constantly brainwashed against his will only to be stored away like some sort of seasonal jacket by a
“I’ll pay for it along with my coffees.” The deep voice said, Tony looked up in surprise at the person. They were taller than Tony, with black curls and facial hair that looked
Rhodey nodded and started tapping on his phone. Pepper squeezed Tony’s arm through the blanket and gave him a smile.
divorced and was pregnant. If Stephen knew that the alpha would turn him away, Tony was sure of it. Everything Stephen had done were things Steve should have been doing, Tony should have never gone into distress in the first place. But here Tony was, sitting on Stephen’s ridiculously comfortable bed and it made Tony
He vaguely heard Pepper tell him she called Rhodey when she came back from her battle station and Tony
Tony watched as Carol stopped in front of the swarm of ships. Almost stopping his flying when he saw one of the ship’s weapons hit Carol. Carol seemed to be perfectly okay but that means these ships weren’t 100% friendly. Which just made things harder.
“Yeah, Strange.” Jan said more solidly. Allowing Tony to play his words game to avoid the conversation. They both knew she would wiggle it out of him sooner or later. “He’s really stepped up as an alpha, don’t you think?” Jan said sweetly as she got into the cupboards and drawers for a cutting board and knives.
Entering Bucky was like coming home to that Brooklyn apartment. A more simple time of Steve’s long, cold life. Bucky was always warm and wet, Steve couldn’t help but slip his cock in and out slowly, gently. Bucky’s moans were always
He first went to the bedroom’s restroom and peed. Once he was out he saw Jan out of bed. She wasn’t wearing the yellow dress she came in but some sweats and a shirt that looked like Pepper’s. Tony know’s it’s Pepper’s because he had gotten her the shirt as the world’s worst joke. It was a gray shirt with a large realistic pepper shaker on it. That was it, Pepper groaned for an hour when she opened the gift.
“If Fury knows anything, he didn’t tell me.” She reported, Steve’s shoulders sagged even more. Natasha wanted to scream, she didn’t like this. She needed momentum, but Steve was simply dead in his tracks without Tony. Steve’s world had come to a complete stop and nothing else mattered but getting the chance to see Tony again. Those odds were slim to none so why did Steve insist on being so damn
“We really should be discussing Thanos.” Carol said from the back of the group. Strange nodded in agreement.
Natasha’s eyes softened a bit. She could relate, as an alpha. Losing an omega was something alpha’s rarely survive. Natasha remembered losing her omega, and she wouldn’t hesitate following them if they came back from the dead. But she had another omega, Tony. Their light. Their omega. She had been searching for this her whole life, this pack, an omega to serve. She couldn’t lose this now. Not because Steve is an idiot who can’t keep it in his pants. Natasha looked at Bucky who wouldn’t meet her eyes. A different man than the one that shaped her in the Red Room.
Steve sat closest to the door, next to him was Natasha, then, Clint, Sam and then Bucky. Tony took his seat directly across from Steve, Pepper and Rhodey following him.
rare occurrence. He had told her he liked being an OBGYN more than a brain surgeon. He hadn’t realized it during his medical practice years and during his practicing years he had loathed every OBGYN case. But now, he realized how much more joy and life there was in the practice. Jan could see the guilt on the alpha’s face for not appreciating seeing
“We can discuss it later.” Jan said, her mind racing with a million thoughts. “We need to debrief the government and-”
“And it’ll feel so good.” Steve said, imagining Tony coming on his cock. Tony tugged at Steve’s cock one last time before moving to align himself with Steve. Tony slowly sank down, his moans getting louder the more Steve’s cock entered him. Until Tony was fully seated on Steve’s lap, shaking with pleasure. His back was arched, his hands grabbing his own shoulders. Steve couldn’t have painted a prettier image. Steve moved his hands so they grabbed Tony’s waist, just keeping him sat on his cock. Tony’s eyes were closed, trying to cut off all other senses because he was so overstimulated already that anymore and he just might
“Sometimes. I was just as stubborn.” Tony said with a sip of his tea. It was a blend Thor’s mother had sent along with her son. It had eliminated his morning sickness and helped with sleeping.
” Carol howled in laughter, not waiting for an answer. She knew she wouldn’t get one. “You gotta let me read it!”
“Yeah, Strange used his voodoo space rock to look into the future.” Jan said, pointing her thumb to the wizard.
Tony felt like he was going to jump out of his skin. He felt hot, suffocated, like everything was too much. Everything sounded muffled, it sounded like someone was talking to someone else but Tony couldn’t make out what they were saying. The New York streets were busy, everyone on the street just going on with their day. Just weaving their way through the crowd. Tony looked at the crowd longingly. He felt like it was too small in here, he just wanted to be free. He wanted to be lost in a crowd of millions and forget what was happening. To just slow down, even for a minute.
Steve. It was something they never addressed. It was Bucky that snuck the kisses, touched the skin under Steve’s shirt. If that bothered Bucky he never made a single sign of it.
for Tony. Making the omega food and drinks that greatly benefited a pregnant body. Not that Tony didn’t like it.
“We’ll have to go back to New York to get them to sign it.” Rhodey said, making sure everyone knew what was to be entailed.
“You gonna tell them?” Jan asked. The omega continued to telepathic conversation. Jan shook her head. “You’re too nice to them, Tones.”
“Stephen fucking Strange is a wizard?” Jan asked Tony as they both hurried down the halls of the Avengers compound. Tony back in his Armani suit and Jan still in her Wasp uniform.
leeway with Fury, even though he did babysit them when they were younger the man had no problem saying no to the omegas. Still, it was more sway over Fury than anyone else had.
The portal closed and Jan through her luxury briefcase on the island and let out a groan. Tony raised an eyebrow at Stephen who just closed his eyes and rubbed at his temples.
, Jan was never this panicked on the field. “They want to take him! Tony!” She yelled as she watched the swarm of ships surround Tony, she could hardly see him. “Damn it, someone get to him!”
Carol rolled her eyes up and stared at the ceiling before she squeezed her eyes shut. Her forward wrinkled in deep thought. After a minute of silence she let out a sigh and leaned forward again.
Tony thought about the alpha, they would have to meet up soon. They needed answers. About the stones and the aliens. It was all business, absolutely no other reason for Tony wanting to see the alpha. Even if there was, which there isn’t, Tony had a child to think about. Most alphas didn’t want an omega with a child that wasn’t theirs. Tony couldn’t hope. He was on his own.
“Yeah.” He admitted, watching as Tony’s expression went from curious to… something that made him involuntarily shiver.
“What can I say?” He heard Tony say, and by the tone of his voice, he knew that the man was doing his not-smile. “Not a team player, right? Maybe wanted to try to change things up a little. You don’t know.”
Steve winked at him and began unbuttoning his coat. “I may not be experienced, Tony, but I know a thing or two.”
“We’ll find a way.” Tony whispered, but it was a loud declaration in the quiet room. “Just like how we found ourselves together.”
In hindsight, she might’ve been worried for his safety, because he literally stared down potential enemies and threatened them in the party. Sure, it was under sharp eyes and tight smiles, but it wasn’t good. It was never good to goad your enemies.
Tony reached up to card his fingers through Steve’s hair, and the blond relaxed to his hold. “She did? I mean. Okay. That’s horrifying that we had the Black Widow after us on the date.” He huffed. “Also, I would like to repeat, I’m not jealous. I’m just—making sure.” He paused. “It’s. It’s been two weeks, after all. I’ve got to make sure you’ll remember me.”
The blond snorted, a smile on his face again. He looked to side as he fished out his own wallet from the back pocket of his jogging pants. “Wow, I didn’t know I was being toured by one of the richest men alive. I’m flattered.”
Steve bristle. “Excuse me?” He demanded, blue eyes flashing icily. He placed the bags on the floor and crossed his arms.
“Against all odds?” Tony asked, and he had that beautiful smile now, the real one, the one that he loved.
type.” He wrapped his arm around the other man’s thin waist, and his other hand settled on Steve’s arm. “And you’re talking to the genius here. I’ve got to communicate with you through another way, you know.”
The other woman, if she noticed the subtle way Natasha had maneuvered the situation, didn’t say anything about it and just gave them a nod before leaving the room.
“But I don’t want you to remember me like other people do.” Tony whined, twisting around his grip and looking him straight in the eyes. “I want you to remember me, unlike the world has seen.”
Silently, he opened his own door and slumped on the seat. At his silence, Happy turned around in worry.
“Okay, that’s it,” Steve griped, standing up. “Look—this has been a fine time and thanks I guess for teaching me what Grand Central Terminal is and Chrysler Building and Metlife Building is, but I have to go.”
“How can you say innuendos without flinching, Tony?” Steve said back, grinning, swaying back and forth. He looked like he was enjoying it, and in turn, Tony enjoyed it too. “Par for the course, sir. You’ve got to deliver.”
“Hopefully, I learned a thing or two. I wasn’t able to continue schooling because—well because I was poor. Sickly. Mom couldn’t,” and his breath hitched, as his memories resurfaced. “—was strong.”
“I’d like to meet him someday.” Steve mumbled, blushing. But he knew that wasn’t the case. They were different people, too different.
New York really was something at night, despite the hustle and bustle it achieved. In the past cars were a thing already, so he wasn’t surprised at the vehicles—however, the sheer amount of them being just
His newfound companion had basically said that he didn’t care about the money, that he didn’t really abide his flirty personality but will accept it if needed. He didn’t care about him blabbing about a lot, and only regarded him with something that he’s shown to love: chocolate.
His world spun for a moment, and that was the only time he put down his hammer. He brought his hand to his temples and massaged them, muttering incomprehensible words, even to himself.
“I wish I could leave you something, Steve.” Tony murmured, perfectly content sitting on Steve’s legs. He was kissing his jaw now, and Steve was stroking the man’s side and circling the arc reactor. “Something to remember me by.”
I'm deciding to post all chapters, because honestly I really want to share it with all. So, I hope you would all like it :D
“No, indeed.” Maria allowed herself to smile, which, that was actually relieving, because Steve hasn’t seen her smile for the four-or-so weeks he’d been there in SHIELD. She wasn’t a robot (he had thoughts like those, sue him) and that was reassuring. “But to those who have studied you for so long? SHIELD is best at protecting, more than keeping secrets, I should know. We try hard but it’s impossible.”
Tony, the Tony that wasn’t supposed to know him, nor the Tony that looked dashing in a three-piece suit. Natasha kept rolling her eyes, because she had dropped her openings left and right, but Steve felt like his mouth had clammed up already.
They talked about diverse things, ranging from Tony’s robots and his AI, to Steve’s experience in the army. About maybe they could meet in coffee shops and coffee runs, or maybe when Steve would exercise again and Tony would disguise himself like a hobo again. Maybe, when Tony was going for a gym and find Steve doing squats—(
She also somehow knew about his (from what he assumed was her perception) admiration and infatuation with Tony Stark. She hadn’t told Fury about anything though, so that was alright.
He obviously meant it as a joke, but there was a split-second strike of fear that had Tony’s heart start hammering in panic. He didn’t want to be known, and he thought he knew he wasn’t being recognized. That meant two options: Steve had somehow skipped through his whole life (impossible, he’d be born in the height of his initial fame, honestly) or he was a master of keeping his surprise hidden.
He felt worried for some reason, because the guy was just staring at nothing, at the ticket booth, or the center, the clocks; basically, he wasn’t doing anything threatening or worrying, but… he was just standing there. Confused.
“You know,” Tony whispered, just like they were sharing secrets, as if they’ve known each other for a long time. “—I don’t think I want to sleep, which isn’t a first, if you want to know something about me.”
“Not so, we need brains as well,” he honestly answered. He felt accomplished when the man stood taller with pride. “Steve Rogers. Nice to meet you.”)
Steve closed his eyes, intertwining their fingers together. “I love you, okay? Don’t forget that. It even feels like love at first sight. It’s impossible to not love you.”
thinking of something else than getting into his pants, which, not good, he’s got to keep the vibe ongoing or they’ll suddenly laugh at one another and they’d smile, and they’d have a fun time—
Tony and Steve get acquaint themselves with one another. Tony thinks that Steve must've lived in a cave his whole life, and Steve thinks Tony is talented. And eats a lot of chocolate.
“Even you?” Tony raised an eyebrow, looking at him. Steve met his gaze for a moment, and for a second they stopped swaying, as Steve pondered to say what he could say. When he could, his voice was soft as the breeze, and Tony tried to listen harder, afraid that New York ‘magic’ would be swept off by the wind.
He stroked his hand on the other man’s back, and he started to massage him lightly, feeling the tension. “I wanted to call you, I really did. I know I should’ve checked on you and found a way to contact you,” he whispered, planting soft kisses on the man’s face, wiping the few tears that had escaped from Tony’s eyes. “Baby, I’m sorry, please, forgive me.” He lifted him up, and he nudged Tony’s lips with his own, for him to open, and it made him feel relieved that Tony did, pliant in his grasp.
“Ah,” the man looked like he wanted to say something but clamped his mouth shut. “Al- Alright. Sorry again. Um,” he scratched the back of his neck, “Hope you don’t get… bulldozed, again,” he smiled uneasily.
And the last few hours trickle on by, as the inevitable end to their night comes in with the sun rising.
He had his “repulsor” up and everything, as if to attack, but he quickly saved face by putting his hand on his face and high-tailing out of there.
Natasha Romanoff was a curious one; she was really agile, and tactical. He’s sparred with her for a few times, and he
(Well, a part of his life. It seemed like Stark Industries was doing quite well, if by going by his update!)
this man was, inside and out. “I want to tell you about me too.” He murmured as if he was reading his mind.
“It’s see you later, Tony,” he weakly corrected, as he felt the beginnings of tears gather up in the corners of his eyes once again. “We’re going to see each other again.”
He grew up waking up at sunrise, but he hated it, because his family was always gone. It meant going to school, and being held back. It meant new things to do, things he hated, and sometimes loved, but generally hated because night time was his ‘prime’ time. It meant classes, it meant meetings, it meant proceedings; it meant being with people who are hungry to pull him down.
“I’m not condescending.” The blond looked genuinely alarmed; he almost felt bad, except the corner of his mouth lifted up, and yeah, no.
“Hey,” the genius whispered. “When you get to know me, promise me that you’ll still love me?” His hands shook, and Steve took them in his hand to calm him down. “Tony Stark is a big fuck-up, after all. People leave all the time, you know?”
Tony snorted, and released his hold on the jacket, patting him. “You are a giant, you jerk, come down.”
Tony turned around and looked at him with an incredulous look on his face. “What? No! I’m a green energy and technology specialist. What made you think I was even close to chocolate manufacturing?”
He was in his SHIELD-assigned room, alone. He wasn't in a hotel, accidentally dozing off. He was-- alone.
they totally knew what they were going to do. Hence, Steve being panicky in the elevator. If he wasn’t the one who made the first move—stealing his
The effect was heavenly, something that Tony never fully had time to appreciate ever before. It felt like the world was waking up, the sky becoming a mix between a pale yellow and blue mix. Clouds were gaining shape, and jet-streams were prominent in the cool air.
“I’m part of a Space wide known alliance. I’ve dealt with a lot of alien diplomacy, let me see if I can talk with these guys.” Carol said, slowing her approach as she got closer to the cluster of flying spacecrafts.
“You’re space famous, baby!” Carol said, still smiling but her eyes remained serious. “And that Chitauri fleet was spent by someone.”
They both knew that wasn’t how the world worked, you just can’t have it all. Cause and effect, for every action there is a reaction, life and death, yin and yang, give and take. This was the one law of the universe. And Steve was arrogant enough to think he could be the exception. As most humans did.
But he had his Bucky back, Bucky who was with him even before he was Captain America, when he was just some scrawny guy from Brooklyn. When they first defrosted Bucky and examined by SHIELD doctors he was terrified. Bucky looked so scared and clung to Steve the first week of being out from the ice.
Tony inhaled the scents around him. His eyes did not want to open just yet. It was a deep smokey smell, almost like old books but more pleasant. It brought comfort he hadn’t felt since that day at boarding school. It was so different from Steve’s scent. This scent was smokey, and so deeply ingrained in the omega’s memory. He also caught another scent, one of honey. Tony buried his face deeper into whatever plush thing he was laying on. He hadn’t felt this relaxed in a long time.
Natasha slammed her heel down on Bucky’s toes and tossed her head back, a loud cracking sound formed as Natasha’s head made contact with Bucky’s nose. The omega dropped the alpha and clutched a hand over his bleeding nose.
couldn’t hide her surprise. On any other day Tony would have taken that as a victory, but today it's just
“Want to give us a rundown of what an infinity stone is?” Rhodey asked Carol as he picked up another dumpling and dropped it on Tony’s plate next to him. The omega happily obliged to eat it.
, let’s just talk.” Steve pleaded, knowing he was losing this fight. Steve was letting his beard come in, that was new, Tony noted.
“Moving Stark Industries main office to or near Silicon Valley would make sense, technology capital of the world.” Pepper added as she hung up her phone.
By Natasha’s signed name was a kiss mark in a deep red. Jan looked the paper over again and then the back. A set of coordinates with a request to burn the letter once Tony has read it. Jan quickly folded the letter back up and stuffed it into the envelope.
“I just don’t know what to do next. Do I tell Steve about Peanut? Do I get him on the weekdays and Steve gets weekends? I don’t want to even look at Steve but-” Tony could feel his voice shake and tears in the corner of his eyes.
, she would tease him and they had inside jokes. Jan was the second most stubborn person he had ever met and they would often butt heads. It has always been fun. Captain America and The Wasp worked well together on the field, even if she was making too many quips with Natasha during a mission.  And now he was
Jan was in her penthouse in New York. She had been in the middle of sewing a new dress when Natasha had called her an hour ago. Natasha asked her if she knew where Tony was. That kick started Jan’s absolute terror because how could his pack not know where her best friend was? When Jan told Natasha she didn’t know where he was Natasha simply cursed in Russian and hung up.
Tony let his head fall back against the tub and closed his eyes, his mind slowing down. He could hear a muffled version of Pepper and Rhodey’s conversation, discussing what they should eat and how Pepper was going to get the place furnished in the next couple of days. Tony didn’t know how long they had been in the tub, the next thing he knew he was in new clothes and in a bed sandwich between Pepper and Rhodey.
The noise spooked Tony back to reality. Jan had thrown her knife into the wood of the cutting board, it stuck up straight next to a half chopped tomato. She had an arm stretched across the island and a finger pointing at Tony.
“Well sorry we don’t know all the secrets of the universe.” Jan almost growled, she had forgotten how arrogant the alpha could come across.
“For who?” The Wasp asked, turning fully toward Strange. Her face unreadable under the sleek black helmet. “Maybe Captain Marvel? The timeline matches up. Plus you’re the only one with a galactic reputation. Carol’s eyes flicked toward Iron Man. That statement was not entirely true.
“It’s a beautiful home.” Stephen’s deep voice rumbled from behind him. Tony spun on his heels to see the wizard and a disappearing portal. Tony smiled at him.
“The ships.” Rhodey finished, setting his own meal aside in disgust. Carol nodded in confirmation. The air in the room was tense, thick with fear of the unknown and a tyrant's fascination in their omega.
“Guys!” Tony barked, slowing them down. The three looked at Tony with caution but also amusement. Tony looked down at the kitchen island’s marble pattern.
Natasha packed the last of her shirts into her only duffle bag. If HYDRA and being a spy had taught her anything it was how to pack light. She looked around the room that once felt like a home. That feeling left with Tony. Natasha shook her sadness as she zipped her bag. The tower was nothing but a haunted house to her.
As Tony told the story again, the once peaceful sky went more dark and grey as Tony continued to fill in Thor on what he missed. Thunder roared outside as the wind picked up to alarming speeds. Thor stood up, lightning hitting the ground somewhere, shaking the house.
so far he had seen the Central Park and spent his running there most of the time, then headed east; he’s seen lots of skyscrapers too, then south, to Rockefeller Center. He had rounded up somewhere again, seeing this museum called
“Yes?” The doctor had perked up when his name was said, and in the loud sounds emanating from the vehicle, his response was drowned out. “Oh, wow, Captain America! I don’t know if you know who I am but—“
because suddenly between seducing me you delivered the worst joke in the world!” Tony exclaimed, grinning. “What did you say? Be my
Buildings lit up into small lights, forming this little harmony, like they were living under the lights of the stars, and it reflected onto the lights below.
“I’m planning dinner, remember?” Steve said. “Besides, of course I’m yours. We’ve made that promise. Why are—“, he blinked, suddenly realizing something. “You’re jealous!”
“Whoa big guy,” Tony patted his arm, bringing him out of his thoughts. “You alright? You went through some kind of tunnel of existential crisis right there. It’s just a ball of chocolate.” He brought another one out of his bag. “Come on, you look like Ferrero Rocher killed your dad.”
He admonished, still not over the fact that Tony found him attractive. “Come on. The building is closing.”
It’s been more than anything he has, in his life. He reminded him of Peggy. That was… strangely alright.
Tony didn’t know how to answer, but the feeling that was building up in his chest was too much all of a sudden, and he smashed his lips against Steve’s, as he tried to convey everything, the
Hello! I'm back with another chapter. I want to thank those people who gave kudos, commented, and read my story! Thank you so much!
“I’ve got to be crazy.” That startled a laugh out of him. “Nice to meet you too, Tony. I’ll try to keep up, yeah.” He shook his hand, and felt a smile on his face.
“I’m… not really hungry, Tony,” Steve mumbled, but that was a lie because he was in a constant state of hunger for the past week. “-also, I had eaten in the Grand Central Terminal? What was that, a café?”
After he trudged up the stairs, his first actions were to get a bottle of scotch and lay down on his couch. Maybe catch some sleep because while he was made of iron will, his body was most likely protesting for sleep. By the way how his back ached on the soft couch, it really did seem so.
, itinerary. I’m thinking of a good loop. We’ve got a whole night to ourselves, and it’s what, 11 pm? Early. It’s like, prime time.”
“Appropriate?” Tony eased into a grin, and Steve was then reminded again of how they somehow always found a way to right themselves despite the situation at hand. How they could talk, or not, but still enjoy each other’s time. He took Steve into another kiss again, and released. “Sweetheart, I’ve already got your room furnished, and I’m not taking no for an answer.”
Tony raised his hand. His head hurt suddenly. It always did when it was about feelings, especially ever since his heart decided to fail him regularly and had to be powered by the arc reactor. “Shut it. Not a word.”
The brown-eyed man huffed. “Darling, I believe in science, but also, that’s way too much of a coincidence.” Then, his eyes widened. “Shoot! That means we have to get him! He’s going to take over the chocolate industry!”
“No fair, what?” Tony prodded. “Come on now, I can’t give a guy a compliment? Don’t tell me you’re not the compliment type of guy, buddy, because those arms are to die for. The shirt as well is
He pulled out his (SHIELD-issued) phone and idly tapped a seemingly random number—for any outsider, it would’ve been. If they knew the backstory of his phone, well, they’d be able to open his phone and then see that he’s had a sketch of the arc reactor as his background. It was taken by Natasha, because she was apparently great at editing stuff. So, that was a win; the sketch looked really great.
He feared that this was one of those products that will out him once again that he wasn’t from this century, and somehow he’ll just spill the secret that he hasn’t been alive for seventy years just by a golden ball.
“You’ve got balls showing up here, I’ll say that much.” The CEO growled as soon as Steve had entered her office. “I’ll give you one warning,
Tony turned around to see Steve in nothing but low hanging grey sweat pants, showing off Steve’s V. His hair and skin werevwet and steam rolled out from the door behind him. God, his pecs looked so much better than Tony imagined. Tony could feel blood rush all over his body, mostly to his cheeks. Steve was looking at him with the biggest, stupid smile that made Tony’s knees weak.
Bucky melted into the kiss and grabbed Steve’s hands that were on his face. There were tears between the two but they didn’t stop. It was until Steve was out of breath that he stopped and pulled away from Bucky. They looked at each other, shame forming on both of their faces.
“At least you're loyal to one of us.” Tony twisted even more the said metaphorical knife. Before Steve could say anything, Tony slipped to his side and made his way to the waiting black car. Jan stayed as her friends made their way into the car. She held out the binder to Steve who scrunched his eyebrows in confusion.
This was it. No more Christmas where Tony and Jan get horribly drunk on eggnog. Where they’d make Steve let them sit on his biceps, where they’d sing Christmas carols horribly off key. Making Steve pose like those cheesy 40’s muscle show posters, where an alpha had two girls sitting on his arms as he posed with his arms up to show off his strength. Steve’s super soldier strength was always fun, being able to carry the omegas around with it feeling like he was holding a couple of grapes.
Tony pushed his sadness aside as he worked on an upgrade for Jan’s stingers. He was sitting outside on the back porch of the cottage. The warm air felt nice on his skin, it was nice to get outside and feel. Feel like a person again. Tony swiped his current project to the side for another to slide in its place. It was a new house design for his Malibu home. He had been particularly motivated to draw up schematics for a nursery room, taking lots of Jan’s advice.
So Tony simply turned around and headed down the stairs, to see most of his pack. They all turned to him and all their eyes widened. Even
Not mentioning how his heart raced when he saw the alpha, also not mentioning how he instantly adored the grey hairs and how Tony thought it really suited the alpha and he definitely didn’t mention how much he hated the fact that his coffee date was cut short and didn’t think he could ask for another. Jan looked at him with a gleam in her eyes, he knew that look, that’s her look when she was planning something.
Carol was still fighting the majority of the ships closest to the portal, Tony was trying his hardest to fly fast and avoid the swarm of ships chasing him. Rhodey was helping keep Stephen safe, but it wasn’t enough and the other alpha had to divide his attention to closing the portal and playing defense.
“They’re all bastards.” Jan said, anger in her body language. Stephen nodded and picked up Tony in his arms. The omega was in a distressed haze and wrapped his legs around Stephen’s waste and clung on tight.
as pack alpha to make sure bullshit like this doesn’t happen. What would you have done?” Natasha yelled. All ploys to keep cool gone, unchecked rage flowed out of her. Bucky could
Steve wasted no time, wrapping an arm around Tony’s waist as he swiftly put Tony on his back. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck as Steve started to
good. Tony could see Steve smiling as he bobbed his head, his arms keeping Tony’s hips flat on the bed. No matter how hard Tony tried to move them. Even as Tony could felt the back of Steve’s throat, Steve kept him grounded.
It had only been 10 seconds and Strange felt angry. Like someone had stolen something precious from him. He
They sat in the kitchen, the early orange sun coming through the large windows. Tony had told them again exactly what happened and Pepper took detailed notes and typed like lighting speed on her laptop
ringed throughout the whole office. “We have some good leads and the name of Thanos’s daughters. Thor is already out looking and Danvers is setting up for another scouting mission. She should be off planet soon.”
than happy to help. Steve wrapped an arm around Tony’s shoulder to give him a side hug, and Tony melted against Steve’s side when he kissed his hair.
“I also took the liberty of securing the lab as soon as we left, Sir.” JARVIS said as calm as ever. Tony smiled up at the ceiling.
She pulled out four bottles of the most expensive wine she owned and held them up. She wiggled them in her hands.
.” Tony whimpered, his breath leaving him and ecstasy filling in it’s place. “Fuck me, Steve, please.” Tony begged. Desperate
“I don’t have one.” Fury deadpanned. Carol put the communication device in her ear and then her body suddenly lit up like the Fourth of July. Bright, cosmic colors. She looked at Nick and gave him a wink before shooting up into the sky, flying straight toward the wormhole.
Every word was breaking Steve all over again, she could see it. But it felt good to say, to face reality. Even if it gutted Steve, she needed to say it. Steve needed to hear it. It was the first step to everything.
It seemed as if Tony was an autopilot, just doing what Rhodey and Pepper said. Rhodey went inside the bathroom and Tony heard the turn of a faucet and the roar of a bathtub filling up. Pepper gently sat Tony on the bed and ran her hands gently down his face.
Steve, stubborn as an ox. He wanted to talk, not only about the attack but about them. Tony just couldn’t do that. They signed the papers, they were over. All Tony needed was to get through his pregnancy and a heat then he’d be free forever. Tony couldn’t do more arguing and crying, it was too much. There were aliens and something called an infinity stone, Stephen Strange showing up and being a
“‘We were on our way’ he says!” Jan laughed. “Where the hell did you run into Strange?” Jan asked, her steps in sync with her friends as they rushed down the white halls of the compound.
So just so no one gives their hopes up this alien invasion is going to be a lot smaller part of the story, like super duper small. I feel like I'm straying off the original story I wanted to tell but also super love where this fic is going, it's all very organic. I'm more of a slice of life girl, if you will. Fights and space wars are cool but I live for the drama! I had a blast writing this chapter! I might patch it later for more details but I love it!!!!! Let me know your thoughts!!!!!!!! I keep thinking I write long chapters and then I like post them and they seem so short. So I'll probably start making them longer!!!
“I have to-” Before the genius could finish he knelt over and vomited on the old, red, expensive looking rug. Jan was by his side, whispering comforting things into his ears but the words barely registered. His vision blurred, his ears were filled with a ringing nose. This was too easy, nothing in Tony Stark's life was this easy, nothing. Tony refused to get comfortable with the idea that it would be as easy as the alpha was saying. Tony’s stomach curled violently in itself again and he threw up the rest of his breakfast.
“And the one Strange had?” Rhodey asked, gathering more rice on his fork. Carol looked at him and shrugged.
It smelt of Jan, sweet cinnamon and honey. The omega's scent was comforting to Tony, he’s known it since he was a babe. Jan jumped into bed with him, still talking everyone’s ear off. There was only one person who could keep up with Tony fast paced brain and mouth; and sometimes out talk Tony. Jan and Tony weren’t sure who picked up the trait from who.
scared him a little. It wasn’t hostile, Strange was sure enough of that. So he let it go, wanting to be civil with a potential ally. Strange walked with his hands in his pant pockets, planning his day out in his head.
“Do they even know about this?” Nick asked, leaning back in his seat. His hands referring to the binder, his one eye almost had amusement in it.
Steve, knowing what Tony was going to do, smirked. He put both hands behind his head, as if he was sunbathing on a beach of white, warm sand and crystal blue waters. Tony rubbed the lube in his hands, warming it. Some ran down Tony’s arms but Tony didn’t care. His eyes were still on Steve’s cock. Tony slowly wrapped both hands around Steve, slowly moving his hands up and down. Steve let out a moan, just soaking up the pleasure. Tony pumped up and down with a smile on his face.
“Motherfucker!” Carol yelled, annoyed, as she barreled back, mostly in surprise of what happened, completely unaffected by the blast.
.” Was all he said, then all chaos erupted from his pack mates, worry and sadness in their voices and eyes. They fled to him as if afraid he would disappear, as if they could touch the sun. As if to throw themselves down to the omegas feet and beg their savior for forgiveness. Tony held up his hands and no one dared to move closer, to say a word. Tony could tell by the sounds of upstairs that Steve was clueless as ever.
“And one of our oracles had urged us to return to Midgard, so we are back.” Thor said, directing his voice mostly at Tony who was making his way over to them. Thor smiled cheerfully at the omega. “Congratulations on being with child, Omega Tony! I hope the Gods bless you and our pack.”
Natasha ignored Steve’s questions about what they were talking about and left the two. She had red to erase for her ledger.
Tony looked at him in shock, almost disbelief. It was brief but there before it was quickly replaced with amusement. Tony’s tense shoulders dropped and the omega
Jan yelled with a smirk. Tony felt his face heat up as the blood rushed to his cheeks. Damn it, Jan always knew how to lull him into a false sense of security.
Stephen had even taken to chatting with Thor, both very interested in what the other knew of magic and infinity stones.
“You’re a selfish man, Steve Rogers.” Natasha snarled. “Both of you, under his roof. He welcomed you, James.” Natasha spoke to Bucky directly.
Tony was always in perfect physical condition, everything toned and trimmed and tailored. Perfect, always. And Tony loved it because they adored him for it. They whispered soft, nice things in his ear and ran their hands through his hair like he loved. It was perfect, it was beautiful.
” The omega snapped, his spine snapping straight and his shoulders filled with anger before deflating and throwing Carol an apologizing look. Carol smiled at him, showing the omega she understood him.
“We’ve missed you, you big lug! Where have you been?” Jan asked breathlessly as Thor put her down on the ground. Jan looked over at Bruce and opened her arms. Bruce smiled at her and took up her offer of a hug.
“I came back because I peed on a stupid stick it was positive. And I came back to find my stupid alpha fucking his long lost stupid love and my stupid pack completely complicit in it as well.” Tony said evenly but he looked down at his hands, Pepper was right, he was shaking. Pepper looked at him, with an almost blank look on her face, as if waiting for a
“I am the God of Fertility as well, little omega! I can sense the life within you. You and the Captain must be very proud.”
. A lot calmer than when I last left.” She said with a shrug, she leaned against the porch and sat herself on the ledge. “Basically, the Nova Cora has got a handle on things. No need for the big guns.” She said and winked at Nick smiling knowing she was the '
Stephen quickly stepped forward to reassure the omega. “No, no everything is going as well as I could have hoped for.” He said before looking at the omega then looking away. “I didn’t want to be too forward.” Stephen said slowly.
Stephen waved his hand and cup of tea materialized out of nowhere. It was steaming hot and on a saucer. The alpha held it out for Tony to take.
“I wanted to ask if you would allow me to cast protective shields onto your property and home.” The alpha said, his head held high. Something in Tony deflated with disappointment that
Strange didn’t see Tony for a week. Which was not surprising at all, Strange knew how heats worked. He was in premed, damn it. Still, Strange worried from time to time. Strange
don’t even like Steph-” Tony tried to save any face but the look on Carol’s face told him he had lost this round. Tony deflated. “Did Jan tell you?”
She was a very relaxed alpha, so relaxed that Tony forgot she was an alpha. She screamed more beta than anything. She was just as quick witted as Tony and Tony was elated with finding someone he could verbally spar with. He and Jan just knew each other too well to spar like he spars with Carol.
“Hello? This is a private line? Please identify yourself.” Jan said, sounding just as perplexed as Tony felt. “Jarv? Are we compromised?” Jan asked the AI quickly.
Stephen tapped his chest and suddenly a green light lit up from under his dress shirt. It was intense, just being near whatever Stephen was doing. Jan felt it, the power it was radiating. It chilled her to the bone, so much so she stopped her fighting and just
JARVIS let her into the house as she dragged her suitcase behind her. She closed the door behind her and stepped further into the house. Footsteps came out of a room and down the hall, Jan stared up the stairs still she saw Tony first, Pepper and Rhodey close behind him.
Jan hugged the omega tighter. “You were never capable of cruelty.” Jan said, knowing why Tony was so torn. “I don’t know the answers. But I’m here, you’re not alone.” Jan whispered. Tony just buried his head into her shoulder and held her. He didn’t realize how much he needed to hear that. “Plus, I’m fully capable of cruelty. Especially if it’s petty.”
The behavior of the ships changed, they seemed to move as one. As soon as Jan was down, the ships swarmed together and headed straight for Tony.
humans. Attacking Earth would be waging war on the Nova Core and its allies. It’s not worth the risk, it doesn’t make sense. Why Earth?” Carol asked, trying to piece everything together.
“What we are offering his fair.” Pepper cut in, unsympathetically. “Tony will grace you with 1 million to do what you want with and six months to leave the property. After that you will have no legal ties to Mr. Stark again, under
She made her way to the table they were sitting at, looking between the two. She mostly looked at Bucky who was looking at Steve with sad eyes. Natasha didn’t understand Steve and Bucky. They were star crossed lovers who were reunited and had an affair because they couldn’t contain themselves and now they were acting like anything but a couple. Isn’t this what they wanted? The chance to be together?
-” Jan stopped as Tony stormed his way in with Rhodey and Pepper at his heels. Tony’s face was red and shaking with anger. Jan looked behind the three to see Steve striding his way to the elevator.
.” Rhodey said as stern as he could. Tony nodded. “Happy, pull over.” Rhodey called to the front seat. The car started veering toward the right, barely stopping before Tony jumped out and threw himself into the moving crowd.
Bucky wasn’t surprised, it made sense. Natasha and Steve had entered a screaming match of who’s fault it was and what to do. It wasn’t helpful, it was just how the alpha’s were dealing with their own internal feelings of causing Tony to flee from them. Bucky had stayed quiet, he knew he had no right to have an opinion. He was there for Steve and Natasha to lean on. He had quietly slipped into the role of pack omega.
Jan knew Steve, they didn’t go on life threatening missions together and not learn a thing or two about the other. Jan saw the flicker of
Steve cried as Bucky sank his hot, wet heat on his cock but he still didn’t stop Bucky. Steve wondered if Bucky thought the tears were for him. Steve cried because he knew his days were limited. His pack, his Tony, the moment he kissed Bucky he knew he’d lose it. A part of him hopes they can all get through this but Steve knew better.
“Come with me.” He said before turning and floating down the street. Tony and Jan quickly followed, throwing the other a look of amusement and suspicion.
Part of Tony wondered if he should even be here. If he should head back to the Avengers Tower. A new anxiety formed within the omega. He had a little peanut inside him, he wanted nothing more than to keep it safe. On the other hand, there had to be an Earth. And these aliens were threatening that. It also wasn’t in Tony’s nature to just sit back and do nothing when he could. He wouldn’t be able to live with himself.
“You’re okay, Tony.” Strange said, he knows it’s the first time he’s called Tony by his first name. Strange willed himself to ignore the shiver that ran through the omega. “It’s preheat. It’s perfectly normal for omegas at your age. I’m going to make sure you get to your room and then let the faculty know.” Strange said into the omega’s ear calmly, trying to keep Tony calm.
. Like his eyes never left her alone. Fury had always put himself between her and the CFO whenever he was around. Jan had always been grateful, it was a subtle gesture from Fury. They never talked or acknowledged Fury's gesture.
I just need to know he’s safe.” Steve pleaded with every ounce of sincerity he had. Jan’s hand lowered slightly but not fully, they were friends. Jan always liked Steve. Jan raised her hand again, her face scrunching up in anger.
Tony turned at her shock and tried to rebuttal any of what Carol had just said but instead he ended up gaping his mouth open and closed like a fish out of water. The omega felt his face warm, he could picture the red appearing on his cheeks.
“You, naked and tied up on our bed.” Bucky said in a deep voice. Bucky could hear something fall over on Tony’s side. Bucky threw his head back and laughed. “He’s got a cold so some soup and bread will do, he likes just about anything.”
“Of course not.” Was all he left the group with before crossing his portal and disappearing along with the portal. Leaving them with the clean up.
Tony heard the opening of one of Stephen’s portals. Out of the omega’s peripheral he could see the gold spark take hook on this side of the portal. Soon enough the circle connected and stepped through Jan and Stephen.
“Thank you, Stephen.” He said before turning around and following the sound of Jan’s laughter coming from somewhere in the sanatorium.
He was no longer the young 15 year old he had been when Strange first met him. Tony Stark had created a buzz before he even got to the school. Strange had heard chatter
“An Infinity Stone!” Thor shouted, cutting off Stephen. He looked at Stephen with wide, surprised eyes. “You possess one?”
“Anthony.” A deep voice gently coaxed his way into his ear. Tony barely opened his eyes. It was dark, he could barely see the outline of anything. Tony felt whatever he was laying on dip, the source of the scent was coming closer. “Anthony?” The voice asked again.
“The mystic arts, yeah, yeah.” Jan grumbled, crossing her arms across her chest with a pout on her face.
“-I was thinking about just...seeing...what...happens?” Tony said slowly. Carol looked utterly unconvinced.
, and we all know there is no going back. So let’s make this easy for everyone and sign the papers.” Tony said coldly and crisp, absolutely tired and just wanted to sleep.
Most of the preparations for attacking Thanos were coming along nicely and smoothly. The West Coast Avengers were a well oiled machine. With Tony staying in the California country house as their main hub. The rest of the newly forming pack would go out into the world and get whatever leg work that needed to be done, done.
Jan’s eyes snapped to her front door and she instinctively wrapped one of her hands around the simple yellow bracelet around her wrist. She had one on each wrist, they were a gift from Tony. They were nanobots that transformed from bracelets to Wasp Widgets. When she activated them they wrapped around her hands like black yellow gloves that went to her elbows, with her Wasp Stings armed in the palm of her hands. They completed her Wasp armor when she had it on.
“Wong is a hoot, Stephen! I don’t know how you keep that pensive look on your face all the time with a comedian like this!” Jan practically howled as she pointed with her thumb to the man next to her. Who was simply smiling at them. Stephen raised his eyebrow in complete disbelief.
The universe whispered of a great warrior that defeated a flank of Thanos by himself. Rumors travel fast in space or someone that powerful. Carol never had the time to look into it but it always intrigued her. This was him? He seemed very...
? Are you fucking-” Natasha contained to yell as she still struggled in Bucky’s hold. “Get off me you, Barnes! I’ll fucking kill you both, under Tony’s roof!
“I’m counting on it, big guy.” Tony teased back, moving a knee up so it  brushed Steve’s erection. Steve moaned, closing his eyes and let out a laugh. He dreamed of this.
“Names Carol Danvers.” Carol said, sounding a rough due to the speed she was flying at. “Nick tells me I officially do not exist. They call me Captain Marvel.”
“I don’t want Steve as my alpha.” Jan explained quietly. She wouldn’t tell him how she didn’t trust his pack mate much either, Natasha’s report to Fury had started a burning anger inside Jan. Even when Natasha apologized and retracted the statement, Jan never forgot.
Carol would hear what she assumed was Iron Man, Strange flying along with him not too far behind. She turned to greet them. Strange was dressed more casually than Carol thought would ever be allowed on the Avengers. She shrugged it off, he was flying with a red cape on. There was a lot more here going on and Carol knew that. Iron Man was exactly what Carol expected. His suit was smooth and sleek, it impressed Carol. She had seen many types and stages of technology, it was hard to impress her anymore.
“Make sure the civilians are out of the area, these things are dropping like flies.” Jan said to the alpha, wasting no time. She took off her helmet and shook her head, still trying to recover from her fall.
sound, as if he’d seen a delicious piece of chocolate cake on the Food Network as he watched Tony’s ass bounce. Tony was on the verge of losing his mind. He was spitting out nonsense and pulling at the sheets. Steve watched Tony unravel, a feeling deep in stomach both satisfied and roared with hunger, wanting more.
Tony took it as an insult to himself, asking Jan if she even trusted him. There was arguing and crying, and a month of the Avengers playing messenger back and forth between the two. Eventually Tony had apologized to Jan, he said Steve talked some sense into Tony.
The trip to the private hanger wasn’t too long, Before Tony knew it he was on a plane to California and Tony finally felt like he could breathe. Pepper had pulled out a stack of a contact that was basically a glorified divorce filing.
Tony grumbled at Steve’s logic. Sure, Steve was right in a free will thinking way. “I guess, I just thought since I love you so much that Jan would too.”
“I guess.” She said with a hand in the air, signaling with the hand her drink was in that it was vague but close enough of what she was doing back on Earth. Nick looked at her, a glint of amusement in his eye. Carol picked up on it right away and raised an eyebrow at him.
“I remember you during my heats.” Bucky said softly, his eyes not meeting Steve’s. Steve felt his face get a little red, his heart beating a little faster. “I remember how safe I felt with you. Miss feeling that safe.” Bucky grumbled.
Steve could never not love Tony with all his being. Tony completed him, they were so in sync and so in love that Steve cried the entire time Bucky slid on his cock for the first time in 90 years. This was never planned, Steve never wanted this.
So Tony fell into the chest against his cheek and hoped they wouldn’t hurt him too but he was too tired to do anything anymore.
getting your dick wet with Barnes, Rogers. You have 10 seconds to get out of my sight.” Jan said with even more snarl than before. Jan could see Steve faltering but Steve Rogers was a stubborn bastard.
“That was fucking hot, Rogers.” Tony said, settling in against Steve. Steve pulled the blue covers up and kissed Tony’s temple.
Tony found that it was a bakery down the street, the sweet scent of fresh bread seduced Tony’s nose, causing him to basically float down the street to the small building made of brick. Tony pushed into the bakery, bells clanging as he did. It was a small stone and wooden bakery, with red metal tables near the windows for people to sit at.
“What’s your problem?” Bucky asked Clint, Bucky putting his arm on the desk top and resting his chin on his hand. Clint didn’t bother raising his head.
breaking up his pack.” Fury said, his eyebrow raised at Jan. Jan scoffed and crossed her arms against her chest. As if any of this was Tony’s fault. But Fury didn’t know that so Jan spared Fury her wrath.
Fury didn’t respond, he left an unasked question in the air. Jan narrowed her eyes at him. Fury looked at her again, as if he was irritated with the lack of an answer to a question he didn’t ask. Jan rolled her eyes.
Jan and Tony walked down the street Tony had found the little coffee shop. It was a bright sunny day, the birds were chirping and a light breeze swayed in and out every so often. Tony was dressed in one of his suits, Jan also in a three piece suit tailored within an inch of its life. Her yellow tinted shades sat on her nose as she looked around the street.
Pepper or Rhodey will call. Or JARVIS, because he gets antsy when he doesn’t return or inform him of any place.
“Not a lot knew that,” Steve admitted, as she urged him to go with her for breakfast. “But Steve Rogers totally was.”
A hand steadied the swaying punching bag in front of him—or, what was left of it. Steve hissed in seeing it fall from its harness; that was another thing that SHIELD would gripe about when someone sees again.
“I think I have,” Steve confessed, bowing his head. “I think I have seen the side of a man that wants to stay strong for the world and change it for the better, that other people haven’t seen before.”
He was good at leading. Hopefully. Being at war with people who were clearly in the wrong compared to being at war with gods and potential aliens seemed like a different bar fight altogether. Maybe this was a normal thing that people nowadays experience? He was pretty sure in his time, UFOs weren’t as fanatical as it seemed.
That was okay. After all of this, Tony would do his best to find him again. He was a billionaire and a genius. Combine them together and he’ll rock the world. He’ll find Steve, and he’ll—
And Steve was strangely quiet, but he had held on to his hand to whole time, after his request earlier.
to him. These types of things happened in fairy tales. Love at first sight didn’t happen to his mom and his dad, nor Bucky and his numerous girlfriends, or his neighbors at home. You formed bonds with those people that are similar with you, with shared experiences, hence why his parents got together, and everyone else: war, hunger, and poverty.
A sob crawled out of his throat—and an instant, Tony stopped from talking, and looked at him with worried eyes.
“You know that I’m never letting you go now, right? It’s not just one night anymore, you’re going to be stuck with me now.” Tony joked, features lighting up. “Avengers and everything.”
“--you’ve got a storm coming.” Tony was saying. “I’ve got a lot of jokes, right here and right now, and,” at that moment, he squeezed his arm, “—it’s making me feel like I’m staking a claim here.”
He raised his hand and got inquisitive gazes from a group of friends, who were just talking with each other on the apartment steps. He could’ve died then and there, but he soldiered on.
“I’m sorry, Tony,” Steve murmured, and he gently looped his arm around the other man, careful not to mess his suit. “I didn’t think I…” he shook his head. “No, I would’ve definitely gone, if I could, but after the incident, they hadn’t let me out for these past two weeks, especially with the threat. I’ve been in the helicarrier for two weeks, Tony, you have to believe me.”
“You got me on first kiss and you actually tried to do-the-do,” Tony countered, and Steve’s lips were twitching into a grin now. “But I
Steve propped the punching bag to the wall, and peered to the window. Clouds peppered the sky, but there was a lot of buildings too, and wasn’t that a big surprise, to see sky-high buildings in lieu of small towns that he had grown up in.
Steve kissed him again. “I told you, I’d never forget you.” He breathed in deeply, becoming fully aware of Tony once again. He could just be in this position all the time, and he’d be happy. “God, Tony, I missed you.”
He noticed how Tony stopped for a moment, before glaring at him. “Now, you, Boy Scout, you can’t say those
Steve thought that sounded familiar, like someone in Italy that he had known in the past. Chocolate and hazelnut seemed like an echo of his past.
Tony heaved as he broke off. Steve was flushed, but he didn’t know why the man felt so angry. “You—“, he attacked him with another kiss, “—little,” then another, “—shit.”
you with my presence, you jerk.” He sat down beside the other man, who just slumped down beside him and basically hung over him like a limpet. “Hey! I want to enjoy my food too!”
A laugh crossed his lips. Those—were great looks, on that handsome man he spent a night with. His laugh rang through his mind, and that twinkle in his brown eyes; it held so much joy.
“But you totally look hot in it, honey.” Tony countered, but continued. “Something better. Something personal. Special. I just want for you to remember me.”
Tony hummed, kissing his ear. He intertwined their fingers. “I won’t blame them; after this, I’m whisking you to my tower. You won’t leave for three weeks, or more, tops.”
Then he suddenly reached out to touch Steve’s arm with a joking leer, but then he started because---
He groaned as he pushed himself to sit down; his body didn’t ache anymore, unlike last night when he decided that trying to learn kick-box was suddenly needed in his life. He understood why he needed to learn those—Youtube was something that he has learned to appreciate, while he was basically under tight surveillance by SHIELD—because he quickly found out that you can learn a
(The dinner was great. And Tony just made the simple event brighter, with his bright eyes and wisdom.
“I’d say be my guest, but you’re not exactly giving off Belle vibes here; you’re a bookworm, aren’t you?”
He ordered a taxi so he could round the city for a while, before setting on foot; if people saw him stalk out of his tower like a creep, people would inadvertently try to catch him, and then his identity would be outed. He was never good at stealth, anyway, since he couldn’t even change the tone of his voice if he needed too.
“I can’t believe it. That was possibly the most romantic kiss I’ve ever had in my life. Do you know that’s a thing because of static electricity? Sparks. Oh my god.” He poked his chest. “You totally planned this!”
It was like—sharing who you are before who you could become in a few steps. He was Steven Grant Rogers, soldier of World War Two. Part of the Howling Commandos.
“I waited for you, to… to come to me.” He murmured. “I know you knew me already. I know you’ve seen me. I didn’t think you won’t go, at all.” He sniffed, and then Steve realized, his eyes are becoming wet with tears.
“Nice to meet you, Steve!” Tony smiled even wider. “I’m going to be your tour guide for today. Hope you can keep up, though that would probably be unneeded as how you were running earlier.” He brought out his hand.
As he prepared to have his morning routine (which consisted of take a shower, put on clean clothes, take the most unobtrusive run around the helicarrier, and eat breakfast in the private lunch area he was assigned to) his thoughts drifted to the man in his dreams. Tony was still emblazoned into his memory even after two weeks. His smile, his laugh, his eyes, his weird beard, the extremely large coat, his hands, his lips—they were all embedded into his brain.
Despite the modern lingo, he understood what that meant, which just meant him look towards the numbers of the elevator as it slowly dinged down to ground level. “I am
Tony stopped, just at one of the many exits of Grand Central Terminal. “That was oddly artistic of you, Steve, and very old of you to say. Poetic for something like us just hanging out for no reason.”
To her credit, Maria Hill gave him a small smile in apology. “There are a lot of threats, Captain, it’s not just Nazis and such on the ground or in the sky that you have to look out. Your status as a hero has been elevated for so long; they could recognize you. Your serum is a… hotspot, of sorts. People still want to recreate that.”
“You got me there, Bulldozer.” He complimented as he took a newspaper from a stand. “You’re a quick one, for someone who stared at the clock for five minutes.”
“I… haven’t been sleeping well, too.” He said, and he could feel his heart speeding up. “I go to sleep accepting this… life, that I’m in, and I dream of people that I love. I dream about those times, in the… past.” He swallowed, voice cracking. “And I wake up, and—and everything is so different now.”
“Oh, that. I’m really great at it; it’s a skill that you have to wield correctly. Like right now,” Tony shrugged. “You won’t
he thought, hands shaking a bit. He tried to not think about the people staring at him (but they were New Yorkers, they were probably just curious on why he was just standing there but the next moment would care) and willed himself to try to be spatially aware for the moment.
Steve, wonderful Steve, apparently knew combat (yes he was from the army but did they teach the army to counter those strikes?). Which wasn’t supposed to be a huge turn-on, but he definitely loved someone who could pin him down—
Steve leaned down and placed one hand on his chest, just where his heart was, where his arc reactor was. The man didn’t flinch or look curious; no, he just looked even more…
blaring at his face.) He also heard someone walking with a loud music player, like some kind of radio but bigger than anyone’s head, propped on their shoulder. It was playing some kind of music with the singer saying things that were nothing but gunfire-sounding to him.
The blond nodded. “That you did, that you did. I think I know certain locations now, just by squinting at the sky. Manhattan’s got a lot of skyscrapers.” He was full out grinning now, and his eyes were shining in realization. “You’re such a jerk, Tony. You know how to make me laugh.”
Steve nodded, recognizing the part where Fury would talk about his potential teammates (Clint Barton). His mind flitted by, and he wondered if he could get a pen and paper from another employee, because he wanted to sketch the area.
This whole night, this whole thing that he cooked up just to entertain him from being bored out of his mind from Grand Central Terminal—it wasn’t supposed to end like this. It wasn’t even supposed to start so
“Exercise relaxes you?” Tony raised his eyebrows, though anticipating it. “No wonder you’re so buff.”
“Tony, I’m being serious here.” He muttered, but that was just as far as he reprimanded the other man.
The admission felt like he ripped out his arc reactor, tossed it into a sky and played hot potato with it before putting it in his chest again.
“Don’t, please.” He pleaded. “Just close you eyes for me, baby. Please.” He murmured. “Close your eyes when I leave. I can’t—I can’t walk away from you if I know you’re there waiting for me.”
“Different lives.” Steve felt his eyes burn again, and for a split second, a tear escaped from his left eye. He quickly wiped it off so Tony wouldn’t see, but from the man’s glossy gaze, he saw it too. “Hah! That’s. That’s a good thing to stall the time machine, huh?”
He sniffed. “Not all of us are blessed with the body of Adonis, Steve.” He crossed his arms and raised his shades to glare at him. “Also, Steve, that was totally a joke that you didn’t jive with me. ”
“Well, you’re going to fit right in here in Manhattan! Because that’s a lot of buildings and it doesn’t get more citier than New York City.”
The blond had a straight face, innocent and angel-like. “What do you mean? You’re the talkative one, like you said.”
He felt his arc reactor hum louder, and he tried to calm his excitable heart. “I won’t hit them, those are practically my children. No, I’m talking about legit—legitimate machines, like car engines.”
“I was doing a superhero pose,” Tony admitted, watching the other man’s visage go from embarrassed to interest. “I thought it was funny at the moment, and then—“, he chuckled again, earning a pout from the other man, “—you just high-fived me! Admit it, it’s funny!”
Steve couldn’t help kissing him again, remembering his previous, sleepless night. He felt that was changing this time around.
“I believe eleven in the evening is hardly prime time, or early for any matter, Tony.” Steve simply stated, shrugging. “But we’re both wide awake, so honestly, you’re right.”
he was revealing so much more than anyone else. A laugh escaped out of his lips. “I don’t even know why I’m saying this to you, Steve. I don’t know why. Normally I just go down to my laboratory and hit my machines till kingdom come.”
“I know who you probably are, Steve!” Tony revealed, and Steve suddenly understood. “And I don’t know if I can take it.  I don’t know,” he shook his head.
“Oh definitely, I love hugging you like that. As resident Chocolate Connoisseur—“, Tony gestured to his body, indicating Steve’s. “—definitely was a plus. Oh, I also decree that I think you’d go well with vanilla.”
It was honestly frightening, but between the small voice of inebriation and the louder voice of curiosity over Steve, it was already a sure thing who would win. Besides, they were just walking around Grand Central Terminal for a while, with Tony pointing at subway maps.
She walked over them, siding next to Steve nonchalantly, handing him a chocolate bar out of nowhere, which Steve greatly appreciated. He felt famished, not eating breakfast yet. To Agent Hill however, she said, “Maria, I’m taking over. Fury needs your help.”
“That’s just your goody-two shoes talking now, Steve.” Tony murmured, but he didn’t let go. “Too good.”
, because no one wouldn’t know Iron Man’s repulsor blast pose. He’s had action figures modeled after him, for science’s sake!
Tony opened his eyes after a minute had passed, and he touched his lips, just to have that feeling of Steve’s lips on his one last time.
“So it’s goodbye, huh?” He murmured knowingly, and Steve’s heart tore itself into many pieces at the reminder of the time.
“You totally did!” Tony all-but-yelled. “How dare you! I was reprimanding you about being a meeting-lover and then you steered the conversation away into… reincarnation!”
Steve broke the embrace to look at Tony. “You look fantastic, baby. Really, really good. The coat didn’t give you justice. Is this what geniuses wear for casual clothing?”
“Yeah, nitrogen fixation, ammonia, et cetera.” Tony waved his hand. “It’s when dinitrogen gets converted into ammonia, and it happens because there’s nitrogen gas in the atmosphere. You know that air is comprised of different percentages of elements and substances right?”
“You can.” Steve urged, as he pulled the man into a tight embrace. “You can, baby, come on. You’re a good man, Tony, don’t think less of yourself.”
He thought about how many times he was turned down, and after two weeks, he felt like giving up and just let have SHIELD their way. But no—he promised, he promised to find him, to get to him too.
go down. You are being integrated to the twenty-first century, and we at SHIELD can protect you the most.”
In an impulse, he threw the scotch bottle, devoid of its contents, scattering into bits and pieces of glass. He watched as they covered the floor, as if to represent his life going into shambles.
Steve pursed his lips, and Tony wondered if he went over the line of teasing, until his lips quirked into a smile. “Glad I’m of some use, a paparazzi cover. What has my life become? All I wanted to have today was time for myself, yet here I am, a pseudo-guard for a millionaire.”
Maybe it was for the good, because he had time to readjust, somehow? It wasn’t in Dr. Erksine’s reminder—“Not the perfect soldier, but a good man”—that somehow supersoldiers would be launched into more than half a century in the future.
Tony thumped a fist to his chest playfully. “You sap.” He poked the star on Steve’s chest. “You’re still going to change that suit, though.” Tony said with a deadpan. “I did that for a few nights or so. Appreciate my hard work.”
When he looked at Tony, it seemed like he had the same idea. “I’d glad for that to happen,” Tony confessed, “—but—“
Steve Rogers was not a weak man, by any margin; he’s faced down so many enemies in war it would take more than being transported into the future to break his will. He was
“Maria.” A new voice came in, disrupting their small conversation. It belonged to a redhead, donned in an all-black suit; she had an almost-neutral, but also a teasing glint in her eyes. “Stop interrogating the Captain.”
Because Tony deserved to know him, too. Even if there was a chance that somehow, SHIELD was listening in.
“Tony!” He choked in surprise. He could detect the hint of a promise, between the lines. “That’s not—“
“But with secrets?” He asked, laughing wetly. The moment felt so intimate. “I’m pretty sure they’ve got The Langham bugged around here. The army might send rockets up your ass, Steve.”
“Yeah!” Tony nodded, and while Steve has enhanced thinking, he wasn’t catching up on what Tony wanted to do. “Alright, something to write with, a pen, pen, pen---“
“She—filmed our fight. I. I don’t--- I’m not really well-versed with technology, Tony, but you’ve said that you don’t like being hunted by cameras and people, and you wanted to stay down, and well, I just had to, keep you private, so—erm,” he stuttered nervously.
Steve regarded him a look for a moment, before raising the ice cream at his hand. “I think I’m going to get a disease from all these sweets.” He also gestured to the bags he held, courtesy of Tony impulsively buying different things a ‘tourist should buy’. Not that he was going to get that sick anymore, because of the serum, but he felt like it.
to not blush here, Tony, just because I do easily and you don’t doesn’t mean you get to tease me all about it.” He had to keep his dignity intact here,
Tony was staring at him, beautiful brown eyes wide in awe, and Steve felt alive. He moved to look at Tony, and he could feel his tears gathering in his eyes, but he trudged on.
The other man rolled his eyes, then directed an undecipherable look towards him. “Right.” He patted his face. “Tourist, huh?”
“Steve, why were you staring at the clock so long?” he whispered tentatively. “…Steve? You can. You can talk to me.”
“Well, okay, okay, me barging in from your cloud of… thinking?” The brown-haired man waved his hand nonchalantly.  Steve noticed the bag of chocolates on his other hand and the bottle of alcohol he clutched. “In your cloud must’ve disrupted you. So, yeah. You alright? Are you in shock or something?”
He wants Tony by his side. He wants to know him more. He wants to be happy, and be grounded, and love the future, to find a home in this alien world.
“Not at all,” the brown-haired man admitted with a grin, “—I like that side of you. I can do a lot with this.” He wiggled his eyebrows appreciatively at Steve’s half-naked body.
“Yes,” he murmured. “Technology is your first and friend and enemy in this century. Wield it and you might start a war for the media.”
(one day he’ll check it out) and then turned again where he somehow ended up in Times Square (where the bright televisions were).
He settled for pens for the moment, and reusable papers, because this organization that found him apparently took things for granted and took a mistype of a word to be the death of theirs. He’s seen the discarded papers in one of their rooms; no one has reprimanded him for taking a box of papers, so he thinks he’s in the good side of SHIELD for a while.
He left them for a moment, and then Steve suddenly felt nervous, because he hasn’t heard Tony call him, or even try to talk to him. No, he was just standing somewhere behind him, talking to another SHIELD employee, and that hurt more than he would like to admit.
“Yes,” she nodded, and she hasn’t removed her gaze from him. He felt uneasy, but stood his ground. “What’s your opinion on him?”
“What did—are you honestly--?” He gasped, and it hurt Steve, god it hurt, that he didn’t know what was hurting Tony. “You—I didn’t expect—“
If you want to yell at me, I'm active in Tumblr at https://authorintheskies.tumblr.com! I also draw art too.
Tony swept his eyes up and down, whistling. It made Steve’s cheeks heat because the man wasn’t subtle, really. “Can’t notice, darling.”
Tony hummed, then, “Shit, I’ve got the same sentiments.” He fiddled with his bags that Steve had placed in front of him and brought out a water bottle. “Everything’s been too much, huh? I’ve been wanting to turn back time, too. Not always, but there’s always that thought nagging me at the back of my mind.”
As he waited, he sifted through the contents of the bags, and noticed something new—a piece of paper, and an apple.
“Not like I’ve done this with any other person, so the teasing is kind of full-blown here.” Steve muttered.
“Sir,” JARVIS’s British tones implored as he lost grip on his hammer, “—I think it’s best if you would take rest. You have nothing planned for today, I’ve cleared your schedules…” A pause. “Miss Potts would like to remind you that on the twenty-seventh, you will have a meeting—“
He sat on the steps of the Grand Central Terminal, idly watching people around him, not giving a second glance at him. That was the beauty of New York; you’re not the most bizarre thing they would ever see.
His original plan was to tour Steve around, and just goad the man into seeing different things. Maybe drink a little, or a lot, it depends. That kiss just settled in his mind, just now.
Maybe it was the cool, quiet, New York air, or the magic that he mentioned earlier. But gazing at Tony—Tony, who looked majestic (but he already did, even with the big coat and shades)—made his heart swell, heart full, like the time when he was little and his mother would tell her that she loved him.
Steve went out first, breaking their hold. He picked up the bags they’ve had for the night and headed towards the pier.
In one night, he learned to love; more than his friendship with Bucky, than his brotherhood with the Howling Commandos, that his affection towards Peggy, than his familial bond with his mother. This love, made him whole, in something that he might’ve lost, if he didn’t do something right.
“I tried searching for you, you know,” Tony clenched his teeth, hands shaking. “F-Fucking, Steven Rogers, and all the results that came in where old records. I told myself that you were real, that night, and not some fucked-up dream that I had after drinking vodka. But apparently SHIELD had you in top security, that they didn’t even upload your god damn files in their database.”
nice to talk to. A bit timid, but he was smart as well, from what his files said; there was also something about being a
. (Except apparently he can’t flirt with him, so that’s was a downside, but he could adjust. He could adjust.) Also, he was—
The feeling of being in-the-moment, of being fully aware of where you are, and what you’re doing. The feeling of knowing who’s with you.
Steve looked around, thinking that someone was going to target him, or that SHIELD was going to get him, but as he peered curiously, it just seemed like the tower was just closing.
and playfully pushed and pulled him. “—how can you deliver those lines with the most angelic face in the world?”
The gesture made Steve feel a little funny, because from the few hours that he had been learning about Tony, the man wasn’t tentative nor careful. He didn’t whisper (until it was some kind of innuendo, which, when he got angry with him earlier, were more jokingly placed) and it made him smile, sadly.
again burst in Steve’s heart, and he hugged the man closer to him, making him laugh. “Yeah. I just. Thought that. I don’t know if I get to see you again, baby, and it hurts, because all the time we’ve been here, and the time we’ve spend together—“
kind. One that gets a lot of money flailing for a little bite. Understand that, buddy?” He poked him in the face.
Steve looked up from his chicken, surprised, like he didn’t expect anyone to respond to a gesture like that. Maybe it really
Tony’s heart plummeted in ways he didn’t know, like his arc reactor suddenly tried to dive-bomb down to the depths of the Marianas Trench. His hands suddenly burned and he had the urge to whip out his alcohol again, but he was better than that. He was having fun with Steve.
“And I think I’ve seen the side of a person who wants to believe again,” he spoke softly, “—someone who lost so much, and wants to find the world again.”
“That’s—that’s actually reassuring.” Tony gave a smile. “I’ve been paranoid for half a day. I can’t buy something without someone yelling my name. I’m glad you were someone raised in some cave, because wow, you are the
Steve couldn’t help but laugh, and he swallowed hard. “You—you do that, my genius.” He started to stand up, but his legs felt weak, like they were lead. “I’ll. I’ll go, Tony, see you—see you later.” He tried to move, but Tony wouldn’t let go.
“You wanted to turn back time.” Tony finished, connecting the dots to their earlier conversation. It felt silly, earlier.
“My name. Is Steve Rogers.” He breathed in deeply. “And you, Tony Stark, makes me want to face another day, and another, and another, every day.”
Tony rounded him, closing the elevators and bringing it to ground floor. He closed in towards him, and Steve could feel his breath hitch as the man basically trapped him into the corner, as if he was the smaller one. His blush went haywire as Tony tiptoed, leaned in to his neck, and kissed him there; his hand snaked down to his shirt, and his hand was on his stomach-
“Can I have another kiss again?” Steve asked, tilting his head upwards. Tony squashed down the urge to giggle, because Tony Stark doesn’t giggle, even if Steve didn’t know.
“I’ve got an idea.” The genius said, scrambling off of him. Steve frowned at the loss of contact, but he sat up to watch the other man tug on a bathrobe. “But we’ve got to plan this correctly.”
Tony stopped, before slumping his shoulders. He laid the paper to the side. “Honestly, I don’t have the heart to search you up, Steve. I—I want to know you when we can be. Together. I want to learn your name when it’s alright and we’re okay.”
She was also really clever, often finding ways to update him about the outside world, like inane news such as
He felt queasy. It’s only been two weeks, since he’s gotten in the future. Peggy, he loved him, she really did, but…
Tony Stark is a brilliant man, but he was also impulsive, so he didn’t really anticipate his mouth running off to be a
He couldn’t help it, but his cheeks reddened, and idly, he suddenly heard Tony’s voice go sharp, the conversation amongst the SHIELD scientists and Bruce cut short. Then Bruce said something again, and it went on.
Steve knew giving his name wasn’t supposed to be hard. He was going public in a few weeks, or so, maybe, if ever the “Avengers Initiative” meant for Nick Fury and SHIELD.
She seemed to get the message and walked by his side. “You know,” she murmured as she sat down, “—you could totally confront him, like you confronted me that time.”
he was so gone on this man. “But that’s not what I’m going to do first. I’ve got to take care of my fella. Kiss me, Tony.”
feeling again in his chest, something that he associated with Steve now. “We’re going to a building with a great skyline,” Tony smiled wickedly.
and Tony licked his lips. (He shuddered involuntarily at the touch, because that wasn’t supposed to be sexy, but that somehow was, or was it because it was Steve?)
He was scared of love, god he was so scared, but when he looks at Steve—Steve, asthmatic kid from Brooklyn, Steve, who, looked at buildings with a certain awe that only artists can only achieve, Steve, who said meeting him was worth it, Steve, who was making him believe in love again (if that was a true concept).
Steve’s laugh was a rumble, and he felt a kiss on his head. “Well, I kind of was… inspired, by someone.” He tugged him even closer, if that was possible, and Tony welcomed the tighter hug. He just felt relaxed, and loose. Happy. “I thought, I should give something to the man that made my life a whole lot brighter.”
He felt twitchy all of a sudden. “Fuck, Steve. How would you hurt me? You’ve bulldozed over me earlier. This is—you slamming onto me is nothing.” He marched into The Langham and presented his card to the clerk, who looked at him with raised eyebrows.
“The breeze here is nice, though.” His companion observed, oblivious to his inner turmoil. “I’d like to just sleep to this. It feels amazing.”
Fury nodded, and turned to leave, apparently to ‘check with the WSC’, which Steve had later learned to coin as
He had Tony’s lips on him slam on him so suddenly, it jolted him from his place. It was—it was different from that night, because that night was just chaste kisses and a little bit of touching, and this—this.
“I’ll remember you forever, Tony.” He opted to say as he kissed his ear. “No one could ever forget you.”
“If it could be washed, or cleaned, I’d clean it.” Steve huffed. He didn’t know what a dishwasher was, but he knew context clues.
“Oh don’t you call me with that tone.” The genius muttered, and he was fidgeting with the costume’s zippers. “Besides, I’ve got a better version of your suit with me. Nothing that tacky. Shows off your assets.” He wiggled his eyebrows.
When they were the only ones left (and three of the SHIELD agents on the platform, but they were busy doing something, like a game) Tony had the

know me? I’m apparently loaded, I look like—like this,” he pointed to his general direction, “—and you’re just pretending that you don’t know me? I have to say, they don’t make it like you nowadays.”
“If this is your attempt at making me spill government secrets, I’m not uttering any words.” The blue-eyed man commented, crossing his arms. Which were impressive, because
“You don’t have to tell me.” Tony reminded. “I’m just asking… I mean, I’m not good with feelings, but if I can… help, in any way I can…?”
He sat down and reached for his scotch bottle, popping off the cover without a care for the world. He turned on the news while downing the bottle; mood going sourer when it was about politics that he most certainly didn’t care for or news about him that he
“Tony!” He scolded, “—I was just thinking how fast you’re talking. It’s like a talent. Can’t—not a good talker myself.”
Agent Hill’s stance changed as she regarded her with a searching gaze. “Have you read… about Tony Stark?”
“I think I am.” He managed to say in contrast to his thoughts. He resumed walking so the other man wouldn’t notice. “What was that you’re saying? The Empire State Building is a lightning rod? How so?”
“Don’t do that to me, you’re such a prick.” Tony muttered as he tried to calm his pulse. Steve directed his gaze at him and stuck his tongue out, making him laugh.

twitch my eyebrows.” Maybe he did, but it was very subtle and you had to have some kind of special ability to see it. He gave him the stink eye and looked at the rod of the Empire State Building. “My face is a glass sheet. Smooth. Nothing sways me. I am the definition of a master emotion-cutter, I wield a deadly and quite
Tony choked, going forwards to Steve and kissing him on the nose. “You know, I had that image of you being an all-American Boy Scout, but apparently that’s a fantasy I can reject.”
The woman was nodding, and other customers (thankfully two are late-night eaters, and just three staff-- apparently not a lot dined in a café at this morning or at this late) were smiling or approving of whatever Steve was doing. Then the woman dipped her head, and Steve held her phone, furrowing his eyebrows (what was he seeing?) and nodding.
Both he and Steve went silent when the waiter delivered their dinner, a weird sense of silence descending between them. It seemed like no one of the two knew how to respond to the earlier incident; was Tony supposed to say thank you? He really should.
“You are such a little shit, you know that,” Tony said, exasperated. He took the leather jacket that was perched on his broad shoulders—which,
“I have so much, and I want to have this, to have you, god, I love you, you don’t understand.” He breathed in deeply. He didn’t understand what prompted this but he wanted to. “But I’m. I’m a man, with a lot of enemies, Steve, you deserve better. I’m—I’m fucked up, Steve,” he felt something wet on his cheeks.
He waited for Steve’s response, ready for the rejection and the eventual worse night that was going to happen when Steve left him alone in this café. He watched as the man’s face blanked out for a second, and then he seemed to go through a moment of inspection of whatever Tony had sprouted from his mouth, and Tony just watched him anxiously.
“I tried not to say anything, but I hope you,” they twirled around a finger at their general direction, “—do something about that.”
“Relax, Steve,” Tony murmured. “We’re still on floor fifty. Don’t tell me you want me that bad already. I might not be able to stop myself.”
If SHIELD couldn’t find him anywhere, he knew that they’d comb the whole city to find him, and interrogate every person he’s encountered. Then Tony would be involved, and they’d separate them, because Tony wasn’t supposed to interact with Captain America.
But he was the one who proposed; he wasn’t that much of an asshole to just ditch someone he invited.
“I’m just saying, if you could assemble a circuit board at four, you probably could wire a time machine, or something, at age…”
He received a kiss on the lips, shutting him up. He backed to see Tony’s delighted (and he could read those eyes, and he shivered at what that implied). “I got you, Steve.” He raised his wallet “You’re tense.”
“Just wanted to see that gorgeous face again.” He raised his hand and laid it onto Tony’s cheek. “God, you don’t know how beautiful you are.”
Steve let the conversation flow, adding his own cents when needed; however, his attention was mostly on Tony, who had yet to speak to him. Steve had tried to make eye contact with him (six times) but he didn’t know how to talk to
Steve stood up and went over the desk in their room, and fished out the hotel ballpen. Tony made an appreciative whistle. “Oh wow, damn. Look at those back muscles. You’re getting me hard again.”
“Quite easy to do, Steven.” Natasha tutted, a laugh forming on her lips despite it staying as a smirk. “Swell guy, Rogers? Arc reactor, green technology. You’re quite knowledgeable for a man that isn’t supposed to know much till the extent of—where’s your lessons at? Cold War? I know a lot of that.”
“That—“, Tony wheezed, swaying to the grass to calm himself, “—was the most adorable and the funniest thing I’ve ever experienced in my whole life, god, Steve, why do you do this to me?”
how that moment happened, and how he tried to be sexy (never doing that again) and Tony burst into laughter. The man had pulled him down and laughed against his bare chest. He didn’t know what to do so he just stopped trying altogether and just held the other man tight as he laughed like a lunatic. “I thought it’d sounded good to say at the time.”
Tony stared at him before walking behind him. “Well, yeah,” he said, and Steve fell for him even more because he didn’t disapprove for the topic change (and he’s been doing that all night long, this man was the most generous person he’s ever met in his whole life, second to his mother), “—it’s because charges from the storm want to ground themselves. Positive, negative atoms go and get angry in the sky, and then they separate, and a lightning flashes, and it wants to find something stable.”
“And I know, that I don’t have much time. I have,” he swallowed hard, “—I have to get back, but I had to see the sun rise with you, baby, I want to see you shine with the sun, because I saw how you glittered in the moon.”
His head hurt. He thought technology being very advanced was already a headache on its own, but apparently from what he had read, Yggdrasil was going to be a thing, if Loki the Norse god was real.
“Get up. I’m bored, and frankly I still want to do other stuff, so I’m going to show you Manhattan.”
Tony breathed in deeply and smiled wobbled a little bit, but at least Steve didn’t see. Maybe this guy really was an angel? He really could be. No one has ever been kind to him, except Pepper, Rhodey, and sometimes Happy.
Steve stared upwards, seeing the rectangular glass-covered building as high as the sky. Idly, he thought that it might not be the tallest building in this New York. “Hello.” He promptly greeted, then a second later he was berating himself because that was
“Tell me, sweetheart, who gave you this idea to kiss me here?” Tony squinted his eyes to look at him. Man, he just realized how much taller Steve was, and for all the times he felt little, this was one of those times he relished in it. “I need answers. I don’t believe you if you tell me it was
Tony narrowed his eyes. “Point. But I have a fancy cheeseburger and prosciutto and you got a full rotisserie chicken! Will I call you chicken?”
Tony opened his mouth before settling onto a smirk. Not a lot of people were able to amuse him a lot, and they’ve been together for a short time and he instantly felt alright with Steve.
“Steve.” He called, going to his side. “We’re here.” He rocked on his heels, putting their belongings on the bench next to them. “We didn’t walk, huh?”
“I know.” Tony smiled, a sincere apology on his lips. “Had to lighten up the mood. Not good with feelings, right?”
Maybe because he was hungry, and he needs to be satiated. Besides, chocolate and vodka sometimes tasted good together, if you knew what to pair them together.
That brought out a choked laugh from Tony, making him separate from him for a moment. “Oh my god! That was dirty! I’m becoming a bad influence on you!”

The property his mother had picked out for his Get Away House was spectacular, Tony was not surprised. It was out in the middle of nowhere California, nestled in the mountains with beautiful fields surrounding the gated house. It was modest for Maria, which wasn’t modest at all. It was an old stone building that seemed to be a cottage, it was two stories and well maintained over the years. Rhodey pulled the car up to the driveway as the gate opened up for them. Tony had JARVIS installed long ago simply to monitor the house for things like fires, or flooding.

Tony stared at him with wide eyes, wondering how Thor could possibly know he was pregnant. He hasn’t been on Earth for more than 5 minutes. Tony assumed his surprise was written all over his face because Thor threw his head back and laughed.
“And yet somehow are multiplying like fucking rabbits.” Tony joked into the coms as he put more power into his repulser's in his boots, speeding away from the ships faster.
The two sat in silence in the dark, neither knew how long but eventually they both sat up and wandered out of the alpha’s room; with Jan’s jacket in Tony’s arms and the cloak back at it’s place on Stephen’s shoulders. When Stephen closed the door behind them Tony turned on his toes to face the alpha. He looked up, seeing as the alpha was ridiculously tall. Tony blinked his thick eyelashes at him and smiled. He stood on his toes and kissed Stephen’s cheek.

The muffling was getting louder, it wasn’t under a hand harshly shook his shoulder with their nails digging into his skin. Hard enough that it broke his skin.

Tony sprinted after Stephen who had run out of the coffee shop without a word. Before Tony could yell at him, Stephen’s tie undid
“You caught us and said nothing to Stark.” The omega growled back, only succeeding and angering the Black Widow more. “You had the option-”

“Loads.” Steve said casually, following Bucky. Bucky stopped at the doorway. Tony was asleep on their bed, in one of Bucky’s shirts that barely covered his ass. Bucky turned to Steve and smirked.
Natasha told Clint and Sam, the only other pack members currently in the house. All having the same reaction Natasha did but also caving into the same selfishness of wanting to be loved by Tony Stark. They could keep him happy, they would go above and beyond for their omega. He would never be lonely when his alpha went to fuck another omega. He would never want for anything as his alpha gave to another. The pack would devote themselves to Tony.
Tony’s knee jerk reaction to seeing Bucky getting railed from behind by his husband and alpha was to
“Wong was telling me all about the infinity stones, even offered us a book or two to take back to the gang with us.” Jan informed him, her hands never leaving the other omega.

It certainly was a 180 from his life as a successful surgeon. “Yeah.” Strange agreed, he took a sip from his own coffee cup. “I’m seeing what else is out there. My life, it didn’t turn out like I thought it was going.” Strange thought about his schoolboy days, how naive he was back then.
“He’s even won me over.” Jan continued as she washed the last of the tomatoes. “What can I say, I’m a sucker for those white stripes in his hair.” Jan said dreamily.
“Yeah, maybe I should sleep more.” Tony joked. He looked at Wong then at Stephen. “Sorry I vomited on your rug. I can pay for it to be cleaned.”
Today was a good day, Tony had a cup of coffee, decaffeinated, and the California sun. His wooden seat on the porch overlooked tall, green lush grass that swayed with the wind. The sound of the grass as it blew filled the silence of the valley. The warm and dry air smelled familiar. Tony could see why Maria chose this place.
“Mostly against ill intended people and magic.” The alpha stated. “You’re very isolated out here, it would bring me some peace and mind knowing you’re as safe as I can make it.”

“I’ve got it!” The alpha yelled, his gloved hands shaking at the amount of power needed to close this blasted portal. The ships seemed to have sensed this and turned their attention to Stephen.

Steve took Tony’s hands into his and raised them to his lips to kiss Tony’s fingers. It was like a shot of euphoria for Steve. Feeling Tony’s skin under his lips again, his scent in his nose. It had been so long, Steve didn’t know how long he could go without it.
“If I asked you to never see Barnes again, would you do it?” Tony asked, voice low and cold. It surprised Steve, how mean Tony could get. Tony was always so sweet he forgot Tony spent his whole life with disgusting billionaires who wouldn’t hesitate killing their own friends to come out on top. That Tony was raised by Howard Stark, a man who started with nothing and clawed his way to success.
“I’ll take him home.” Was all Jan said stepping forward to gather Tony in her arms but Stephen took a step back.
The West Coast Avengers weren’t his pack, but his omega brain was crying to take care of them like they were. He had missed being able to care for people so blatantly, he missed being cared for in return. He was also scared of opening himself up to that kind of vulnerability again. Tony never had any doubts of his old pack until the moment he had caught Steve.
The three were making circles around the warlock, shooting down the space crafts, keeping him in a protective bubble.
