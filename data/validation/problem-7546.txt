had recommended him to the team. The nerve of him! Tony squashed down the little bundle of joy that threatened to spread around his chest and huffed into the mouthpiece. Squashed even further down was a seed of hope that threatened to take root, hope that there was chance of reconciliation between Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. (Not as lovers, though. It’d be phenomenal if they managed a conversation.)

The room brightens further as the data Steve brought with him overlaps with Tony’s existing data. He’s spent nearly a month alone just filtering out data that was gathered after Tony’s disappearance, creating a new folder and carrying over common knowledge and speculations and
Then Rhodes appeared, flinging himself out of a cab, still in his pajamas and mismatched sandals. Pepper arrived not long after, Happy frowning in disapproval at Tony as he helped her out of the backseat.
Her face changes. Softens. Steve may have seen her eyes gloss over, or maybe that’s just his own? But the agent nods, and in that split second her eyes clear, expression back to one of true neutrality. “Of course. Please follow me.”

"Just had a feeling you needed it," she gave a quirk of the lip before settling into the chair in front of his. Next to her sat Captain America, and in front of him, Black Widow. Tony had the strangest feeling the seat his ass sat on was Thor’s, that the Avengers were already a rather solid

Unsurprisingly, the press was waiting, crowding around his car, and as soon as he was within sights, him. Security guards from the entrance rushed to his aid, but it did nothing to stop the cameras flashing and questions flying. Tony ignored them all, except.
Steve realises then, that

) motorcycle at the entrance. At least, he thinks it’s the entrance. It looks more like a main gate into a mall more than anything. He steps before what he believes is a door, but there is no handle to push or pull. It’s not an automatic sliding door either. There is, however, a card reader. Clearly, nothing is happening until he magically has clearance into billionaire Tony Stark’s mansion.
“No.” Tony doesn’t even turn as he says that with certainty. Then, less confidently, “There was a, uh, cellist. I think.”
“Steve, for gosh sake,” Peggy would chastise him whenever he breaks a plate, or a cup, or whatever object is closest to him. He’ll give a sheepish smile, apologise, and she’ll shake her head, and go back to what she’s doing.
"Our meeting was planned from the start."
. His vision is blurry, hazy. Steve closes his eyes.
A blurry image of the back of a posh looking car appears on screen. Beneath it is a message attached: Killian’s car’s license plate number, boss. Snapped a shot as they left the company. Tony’s eyes sparkled as his lips finally splits into a grin.
he’d wear. Steve’s own cufflinks are relatively PG; it’s a palette, because art has been the one consistency in his life. And even now, his heart warms that Tony understands.
Then Rogers accepted the bouquet with a soft “Thank you”, and Tony fell in love. Well, okay, not quite there yet, but he was definitely crushing on the man now. “I forgive you, St- Um, Mr. Stark.”
And without turning, he’d answered, words admittedly a tad too bitter,
Tony had been an Avenger for less than 24 hours, and he already wished that he was back in his penthouse when he’d found the Skrull-Fury, told him to fuck off, and enjoy his damned drink. Instead, here he was with his ex-husband who didn’t know Iron Man was Tony, and a group of people who were part of a government agency that sent Steve to him in the first place. And now he was part of said group on a mission to save said agency (and the world) from aliens. Karma, it was definitely karma for the years he’d actively participated in the development of deadly weapons.
Tony wasn’t feeling up to argue. He did feel dead exhausted. Coffee these days didn’t do much for him anyway. Probably three glasses of his juice, and a new arc reactor while he was at it. He agreed, letting her walk him to the car JARVIS already drove over.

after Siberia, is it? Steve has to give himself some leeway, or his mind will explode.
It takes Steve two days to work up the courage. Because two days was the maximum possible given time to grief before the Infinity Stones need to be restored to their rightful places. “One second too late, and it’d cause wordly chaos,” Bruce had simplified the complications, with Doctor Strange nodding his approval.
he realised. No one ever asked him that, because A) he never entertained the press anymore, and B) no one knew he was Iron Man. But when asked so directly, when he was weak, Tony gave in. He stared right into the camera lens, spewed out some choice words, and dared the Mandarin to attack him at his own home in Malibu. Next to him, Pepper gasped, and he heard her asking them not to air his home address, but it was
The eye contact is broken, and Steve feels himself sigh in relief. “Alright, J. Show me what you got.”
The team, supportive in a way only they can be, congratulate the couple. They have a party, one lasting two days and three nights, however impossible it may sound. There are no tears as Steve and Tony finally retire from the Avengers team, only smiles and laughter and warmth and love.
“It’s not safe.” He’s seen the destruction the Chitauri caused. He doesn’t need to relive that knowing there’s one more acquaintance of his there.
“Do you understand, Agent?” He says in his best Captain voice. She nods stiffly. Thank God.
“That was a very mature decision on your end, sir. I am proud of you,” JARVIS says dryly.
Steve glances around his surroundings - he instantly recognises the SHIELD Helicarrier he’d spent much of his time on after he was recovered from the ice. The walls, the smell, the logo on the boxes he’s surrounded with. He feels the beginning of a panic attack when he thinks he’ll be found at any given second because
As they sit, sharing a surprisingly casual breakfast (Tony simply scrunches up his face with every bite, it’s nothing Steve hasn’t seen before), Steve’s phone vibrates on the couch with a message from Sharon:
Pepper gives Steve a warm smile. “Of course. It’s the least we can do.”
He’d returned to Malibu after four whole days away on a personal matter to take care of, hours before his ETA, because he was Tony Stark and he was a genius and he could do better than a private jet, and he’d bought Steve a
For a moment, there’s no answer. “
Well, that’s just great, wasn’t it? A wormhole in the sky,
He heard a voice in his head, sounding suspiciously like Pepper, telling him to breathe. So he did.
“How’s the coffee?”
“Tony,” Steve says again.
. Well, fuck. They were Steve's colleagues. At the wedding, Romanoff had been in a blood red dress, and Barton in a suit with a bowtie, all polite smiles. They'd even shared a few jokes. Clearly it was an occupational thing.
after Tony was forced to kill Obi and found out he was slowly being poisoned to death from the only thing keeping him alive. This was his life now. Probably a small part of a plan that karma had for him after all the years Stark Industries had been producing destructive weapons.
“Right,” he nods with mock enthusiasm, passing Steve. “How did that work out for him?”
"Mm. You look so young like this, y’know. Thought you were a college student when we first met. Maybe if you had a beard…" He waggled his eyebrows suggestively.
“You’re the boss of me for this moment anyway, so whatever you say, boss.”

At that Tony snorted. "Won’t be the first to try, and definitely not the last. Emphasis on
Sharon shakes her head. “You need to give me a better explanation than that.”
“Of course, Sir,” the ever attentive AI answers, tone one of amusement.
The temporary truce five years later.
“You are most welcome, Steve.”
There are rooms for everyone in case they ever need a place to stay, even him. Even Bucky. He tries not to think about Natasha’s room. Or Tony’s, for that matter.
Naturally,
"Well, welcome aboard," Barton gave a mock salute, "Just missing one more guy now. He should be here soon." And it hit him.
“Anytime, pal.”
Steve feels the vibrations as Tony hum thoughtfully. “Well, the world wouldn’t be the way it is if I wasn’t who I was. Who I am. I’d say I’m pretty okay with how this universe turned out.”
(It was the words, “And yet money can’t buy back the lives we’d lost can it!” that struck Tony to his core, made him hurt even now, because he of all people knew that . And he’d clamped his mouth shut, and turned to leave, leaving the money on the counter, because it was a fucking tip the barista deserved.)
The ride in the jet is mostly silent, and just a little awkward. Sharon doesn’t ask where he’s from, how he knows Peggy, what is that large thing he’s carrying on his back, why he isn’t communicating with SHIELD like agents should, what’s his last name.
"Don’t be," Widow said, her denemor a deadly calm. "A soldier lives on even in death when those left behind carry on the tales of his heroics."
Steve nods, confident. Only it’s not to
And Tony, being who he was, chose the easier path already paved nicely for him.
Data is pulled up on the screens as Steve lets himself enjoy the banter between Tony and his AI. While Vision had definitely grown to become one of Steve’s close comrade and friend he’d trust to watch his six, he and JARVIS simply shared similar knowledge and the same voice. Vision never interacted with Tony like this (neither did he and Tony, but Steve tries not to think about that).
“Mine?” The word comes out before he can help it, incredulous. Peggy has a gift for him? What? His heart speeds into an unhealthy range as she prompts him to look inside. Carefully, as though the box is so fragile it may turn to dust at the slightest touch, Steve lifts the cover… He gasps, soundless.
From a distance away, “Tony, we can always reschedule date night. This sounds important.” Then she reappears on screen, brushing back his hair and kissing his cheek. “I’ll be here if you need me, okay?”
What he saw was… A man? He had long, messy locks of dirty blonde, a ridiculous looking costume (he was wearing a
“So, you sure Fury’s gonna get all this? In private?”
The man shrugged, seemingly unfazed by the situation. Tony knew and understood the coping mechanism, but to be seeing it on someone else hurt. He had to apologise to his friends later, how did they cope with him on a daily basis?
"Who the hell

Truth is, Steve would rather take this upon himself. To find and destroy Aldrich Killian by himself. Ignoring the fact that Steve has no idea where Killian currently

, but he couldn’t quite place the feeling. Instead, he watched as Romanoff, who sat next to Barton, gave him a curt nod.
The man had perked up half-way, and Tony didn’t know why until he blurted, "You know the Avengers?"
, in his haste he’d forgotten that his arc reactor was on full display.
“I love you too.” There’s tears in her eyes as she answers, and Steve almost chooses to stay. But he can’t. He won’t. He’s already made his choice. He has to do it - who else will?
He set the three civilians in a relatively far distance from the rubble and told them to get the hell away from the hole in the sky, ignoring the stares and the beginning of what was surely a '
In a choked voice, “I swear.”
“Takeaway. Hot coffee. Black.” He says simply. Steve doesn’t recognise him. Of course; that’s part of the reason for the disguise. To

Steve nods. “The information has to be sent to Fury anonymously, so no one will know you were involved, or they’d think the Avengers are onto something. He’ll handle it from there.” When Tony doesn’t relax, he adds, “They’ll let us know if they need help, Stark. I promise.”
He gives himself five seconds to decide whether he wants the star in his pocket, poking at him with every step he takes, or-
Why is everyone in his life so good at arguments? Or maybe Steve’s just bad at it.

Tony’s last words aren’t flashy. They never are. His eyes close, and they never open again. Steve kisses the still-warm forehead, like Pepper had done oh-so-long ago.
Only then did Tony take in the sight of his fellow prisoner fully. His hair had grown past shoulder length, tangled and uncared for. The upper half of his body was bare, revealing scarred skin and bruises that looked fresh. And when he turned, just at the right angle, Tony could see metal where flesh was supposed to be his left arm. "Jesus Christ. What the hell happened to you?"
“Hello there.” It seems he isn’t given a choice in this matter.

, Cap nodded. “Not even Agent Hill, who is a Level 9, knows what Project Insight is. Right now, we’re trying to figure out if the real Nick Fury is alive, and configure a plan to take down the Skrulls and HYDRA.”
Steve should’ve expected that, honestly. There are certainly photos of the mansion you can find online, and Steve has most certainly been on the receiving end of Tony’s generosity that came in the form of access to a whole
Something hot presses against his cheek, and Steve jumps. There’s a chuckle, and oh, it’s just Tony offering him a cup of coffee. “Morning, Rogers. It’s annoying how you look perfect even when sleeping, so you get black coffee.”
Steve waits for Sharon to make a trip back to greet her aunt before taking any action. He knows she will; she had moved in as his neighbor weeks after he’d gotten his own apartment, and he’s seen her belongings here. He spends his spare time cleaning up the house (it’s the least he can do), keeping the fridge stocked, chatting with Peggy (he may finally be beginning to move on the more they talk; he’s come to terms that they’d missed each other this lifetime).
"Jesus, is he still alive?"
deserving of that new toy after all. His life would probably be written with the same ink that first spelt Murphy’s Law.
“Sir,” JARVIS’ voice is like the calm before the storm, “There is an incoming MMS from Mr. Hogan. Would you like to view it now?”
Tony was quite done with dying. Or having near-death experiences. Or whatever people called it. He knew, when he brought it upon himself to enter the wormhole with a missile on his back, that it would become another thing that haunted his dreams. First Howard, then the car accident, then Afghanistan, then
"How is he?" His voice, too, came out wobbly. The Mandarin. The same organisation Romanoff had warned him about, but he’d forgotten afterward, the slip of paper still sitting somewhere in his pocket. If only he’d looked into the Mandarin immediately.
wormed their way to his head, just for them to be squashed.
“Just in case,” Tony had said. Over those last five years, he’d become a rather ’just in case’ kind of man. And just earlier FRIDAY had kindly noted and stored key information she’d picked up from Tony’s message for Steve’s ’potential reference needs’, as she had stated. Bits and pieces of Tony’s message replays in his head.
Tony wanted to ask her.

, but the Avengers have also made some connections with powerful news stations, who convey their blessings and swear to keep reporters off their backs. Steve thinks that’s largely thanks to Pepper, and he thinks Tony knows that too, but that’s just one of the many things they’re content with keeping to themselves.
“Wait!” Tony’s voice cuts in. “I got a nuke coming in. It’s gonna blow in less than a minute. And I know just. where. to. put. it.”
Well, he doesn’t really need to think about it. Preparing himself for whatever it may mean, Steve reaches under his shirt and slaps the star against the center of his chest, and there’s only a light zap before it does whatever it’s meant to do in order to stay where Steve placed it, like hot glue. Looking at Tony, Steve’s always thought the arc reactor would be painful, uncomfortable, foreign. But he supposes… It’s alright?
Sharon has to leave today. Right now. She’s only been back a day and a half.
It’s easy to break out of the jet with his super strength, and he helps Sharon out, giving orders before she can ask anything. “Go help evacuate the citizens. If you see any of the aliens, do
Peggy smiles, this time the brightest she’s shown him, and even missing all her teeth, it’s one of the most beautiful smiles Steve has seen. “It’s yours.”
"Well, then you better make damn sure the planet has more people like you."
and through Sharon, they won’t be able to trace back to Tony, and hence will not trace back to him. No one will ever know Steve’s behind everything. God, he suddenly feels exhausted.
A face appears on screen. Aldrich Killian. All known info about the man spreads out across the screen. “Analysis results suggest that there is a 98% chance that Aldrich Killian is behind the face we know as the Mandarin.”
“What?” That’s just ridiculous, and Steve pulls Tony into a super hug. He’s gotten better at those, hugs that make them both feel warm and content that don’t actually hurt anyone. “No! I mean, yes! I mean-- I
“Thor, man, seriously?” Moments after he says that, Steve can see - sense - 2012 him begin to stir faintly from the corner of his eyes, even as Tony manages to sit himself up with a very Tony look on his face.
hold a press conference, and it was only a matter of time before they found out the relationship between them. Better sooner than later, Tony had decided after the Avengers were finished reintroducing themselves.
But Steve was humming along, his entire body vibrating as he did, making Tony shiver and tilting his head up. His goatee brushed against Steve’s cheek as he mumbled, sleepily, "Steveeeee."
) fall to his death, to never regret another damned decision he’d ever make in the remains of his life. So he popped aspirin conveniently left on the dresser into his mouth, waited for it to take effect, and donned the suit, instantly feeling more like himself.
Steve didn’t speak, but neither did he ride away. Tony wanted to stop himself, to say it was nothing, to just turn away, or maybe give his soon-to-be ex a good beating.
. Can’t forget the hurtful words exchanged, even when (because) the Earth is already damned and there’s nothing left to lose.
The topic of marriage comes unexpectedly, just two weeks after the battle, as the world is still recovering from its loss. The Avengers (all six of the original team, because they sent the rest on

Steve steps forward to meet Tony halfway.
The AI doesn’t answer, but the flat screen TV turns itself on to the local news channel, where the reporter with overly thick makeup and a look of false interest is standing next to none other than Aldrich Killian himself. The man has his cuffed hands held high, head held low as the reporter bombards him with question about the Mandarin, Project Extremis and his conspiracy with the Vice President.
Romanoff’d shrugged. “Haven’t met enough to be sure. Thor eats, though.”
Then his smile falters as he recalls his primary objective -- Sure, the Mandarin is surely a cause for concern, but the whole reason he’s back here? It’s to make sure Pepper’s happy with Happy, and Tony will be okay with that. Whatever it takes, even if it’s Tony directing all the anger at Steve (he can understand, really; seeing Peggy and the legacy she left behind is amazing, but knowing he was not by her side all that time kills him).
They had been so wrong about each other, and so what if took a war, a snap, sacrifices,
And somehow, regardless of how fucked up his life had been looking, Tony was still crept out when he returned to his penthouse one night, weeks after the alien crap, to see that someone had broken in, past JARVIS' security. The bastard was enjoying one of the most expensive views of the city.
And the way Rhodey’s eyes had softened, the loose smile that came to him because he was tipsy while Tony was close to toppling, made him realise
“Tony.”
Voices overlap in his ear, all about looking for the Tesseract (Loki is an afterthought, only because he’s the one who possesses the cube now) but never one about how. Steve has to bite on his inner lip to keep from barking orders, to provide information from the future that may help (but in return, what will he lose next?). If he interferes further, what else will change?
And in the dead of the night, when Peggy’s asleep in her room, Steve will rock on the rocker, looking through folders in Tony’s storage device. Rewinding memories. It’s funny how memories seem to be the only thing Steve ever has, no matter
Steve supposes he technically hasn’t worked up the courage.
And because Sharon is smart, she holds on tight. The moment they pass the first high rise building, the jet is under attack. Steve fires back, of course; but one jet v.s. an army of aliens from all directions? No matter how prepared he may be, there’s no victory in sight here. A wing is broken, and the jet goes crashing down just like it did when he was with Natasha and Clint. But Steve’s a man who learns. He’s been flying low this whole time in an area he recalls to have little to no people, and the crash is more of a bumpy landing at best. Or worst, depending on who you ask.
“See that? JARVIS was right, meaning
Black coffee. Steve accepts it with thanks, holding the warm cup in his hands. Yes, he does briefly recalled being served black coffee for weeks when he first moved into the tower. Was that all Tony? Steve doesn’t actually mind the bitter taste; he’s a man from the 40s, after all. Bitter’s something he can take.
Still, despite everything, Tony liked to think he was an optimist. How could he not be, when he was an inventor? If that meant Tony sometimes forget that happiness was not meant to be his, it couldn’t exactly be his fault, could it? It was such a human thing to do.
. Help a man out, I just fell out of a wormhole to save mankind, and I really need some air here, okay?”
“I’m here, Steve,” the answer comes within a heartbeat.
It was his eyes that Tony noticed first (always, it was always his eyes) and had him doubting the man’s identity. Even behind the cowl that looked suffocating at best, he could see how distant and misty Steve-not-Steve’s eyes were. Tony recognised the look, one he’d seen plenty as Iron Man; the look of someone who had lost too much. He was more than tense; shoulders hunched, jaw clenched so tight Tony could see the whites of his jawbone, and sprouting a

"Take my word as it is when I say I have no intentions of broadcasting
Judging by the way the entire room (including Tony, though his eyes are bright) groans in unison, Steve thinks himself successful.
"Yes." Tony waved his empty glass in the air, "To your super secret boy band."
Tony, who has been looking back and forth between them, deepens his frown. “Okay, I’m gonna have to stop you right there. Pep, honey, please hold on a moment while I try and have a conversation with the walking fossil, okay?”
one of SHIELD’s founder.” And Steve smiles at that, because it’s true. She is. “Now, come on in, Steve.”
Tony hums, plucking at a loose string of the bandage around his arm. Steve swats his hand away with a disapproving frown. “About what?”
Rhodes’ own eyes are misty when he passes Tony to Steve with two hard pats to their joined hands. “Take care of my best friend.”
Then, even without his super hearing, Steve hears Tony suck in a loud, hitched breath. “Pep?
“From Happy? Shit, yes, bring it up, right now J.”
When Steve feels his feet on the ground again, he no longer feels the nauseousness that usually accompanies the time-heist. Then again, he’s seen and experienced the weirdest of things. Not to mention he’s a super soldier with a purpose. And that, he’s learnt from Bucky, “makes him an even stronger soldier than he already is”.
Tony threw his hands in the air. "Guys, come on! Stop being such drama queens. It’s no big deal."
so i am not actually sure whether to continue this, hope for some feedback and i'll see how it goes!! (:
Tony had no choice but to excuse himself. His silent alarm went off within his suit, dying his vision in an emergency red. He had to drink his damned chlorophyll detox smoothie, and replace the current arc reactor with a new one. They’d expressed their concerns at his abrupt need to go, but once he said he had to do something for

“Gosh, I wish I’m up this early for a date, but no.” Tony’s lips pull down in a pout. “I have a meeting with a mean one-eyed Jack later. Set up by my date.”
Tony thought to himself,
It’s words he’s dreamt countless times of hearing, and he’s hearing them now. Steve finds himself tiring of feeling something heavy in his chest that’s making it so hard to breathe. He turns into Peggy’s palm, mumbling into it.
The man’s eyes widened by a fraction, posturing stiffening. “The hec’? You know about the aliens? You one of them pretending to be Stark?”

After what seems like an eternity, softly, “Oh Gods, FRIDAY. What do I do?”
“Well… If you’re seeing this, then I suppose my hunch was right in the end. I died, and the world is at peace, yeah? I mean, it better be at peace. There’s nothing else me and Nat would willingly die for, you know? What am I saying,
It’s strange, how you can watch someone die twice, and feel two completely different emotions each time.
The Hulk turned out to be Dr. Bruce Banner, a scientist who Tony held in high regard but failed to recognise before that moment. He did look rather different from the mandatory photos on his research papers. Gamma radiation did things to people, and not good things, Banner had explained. Tony had reached for his arc reactor unconsciously, knowing exactly what he meant. At least he didn’t turn big and green, something Tony’d like to run tests on with Banner, if he had the time.
), “I have sent the compiled information to Nick Fury’s personal email address. Here is a copy of the attached information.”
Tony tried not to focus too much on the fact that he was learning things about Steve he never knew before right now. Yeah, that’s right - looking back now, he didn’t know much about the man; their conversations rarely revolved around Steve. A classic whirlwind romance gone wrong… except Steve had never said he loved Tony (he had thought
Swallowing, Steve parks the (
It had been hate on first sight. Or, more accurately, the worst first impression. Tony was on his (self assigned) lunch break and had been in a special mood to grab his own coffee when he’d met Steve Rogers in his favorite coffee shop just five streets down Stark Tower. Which, yes, he was the CEO of, had been for years.
Tony had shot back, then.
It’s a little past two in the dead of the night, but neither Steve nor Tony dare to shut their eyes and go to sleep, still somewhat in disbelief that after everything, they still have each other. They lay together on Tony’s bed, loosely wrapped in each other to avoid applying pressure to the areas where they’re injured, but close enough to feel their partner’s warmth. In a rare moment of peace, Steve recalls a conversation from (not that) long ago.
went wrong for Tony Stark. What did the Mandarin got up against Iron Man? Two stealth jets with military-class ammo, that’s what. The two aircrafts were identified too late, a series of missiles reducing his mansion to rubble. Tony was only saved by JARVIS and his suit on auto-pilot, sending the hostiles a taste of their own medicine, before the cliff gave way and he fell into icy waters.
So Tony’s hand found Pepper’s, squeezing in thanks and support, and the two of them hurried to their friend’s side. Happy had to be okay.
, doing nothing when he knows somewhere out there in space, Thanos is looking for the Infinity Stones. He just wishes he’d given it more thought before sending himself back here. So much for being a master tactician.
Sharon blinks in what appears to be disbelief. “Pardon?”
It was only when Barton announced they’d touch ground soon did Tony remember the cup still in his hand; it’d gone cold, but coffee was coffee, so he lowered his lip guard just enough for the cup to touch his lips, and downed the liquid in one mouthful.
“And I’m recording this under the assumption that you are about to return the Infinity Stones. Like, right after seeing this. And you’re going alone, of course. If you’ve already done it, feel free to stop me now before I make a fool of myself. In fact, FRIDAY? I give you full permission to rip this message apart if that’s so. Just do it in a way that no one would be able to piece it together, okay hon?”
with SHIELD. On a break now, but still. I haven’t heard about you.”
something tangible that will remain, even when he’s gone.
Tony hums as he looks across screen to screen, article to article, picture to picture. His brows pinch together, deep in thought. Steve really hopes what he’s given is good enough. Another part of him, the part that admires the genius, thinks he may have given too much.
His chest tingled, a light tickle. The beginnings of an arc reactor meltdown. He ignored it. If he couldn’t find a way out of here, he was as good as dead anyway.
Then Tony smiled, tried to come up with a smartass remark, failed, before finally allowing himself to let out an ugly, painful sob.
There’s so much stuff on Tony compared to the rest (it
And then he was enveloped from all sides again, this time with a few soft whacks. "Oh, Tones, shut up. We’ve been your emergency contacts for years now, haven’t we? If that isn’t commitment, I don’t know what is."
And the rest, as they say, was history.
"You do, Sir," the JARVIS that was installed in his watch had chipped in, a pleasant hum to his voice.
Steve hears rather than sees Peggy and Howard Stark share an embrace. Strangely enough, he doesn’t feel jealousy. Maybe because he knows they aren’t - and won’t ever be - in a relationship? Isn’t that why he’s come back? To fix things with Peggy? Steve’s tuned out the conversation happening just a few feet away, but the following words from Howard jolts him from his thoughts.
There is a knock on the front door, and Steve stumbles back, gasping for breath. Peggy shuts the radio, and ushers Steve into hiding, but Steve… His head is haunted by the images of Tony. Tony’s death, Tony’s hologram message to his daughter, Tony’s accusing words they never did hold a conversation about to the end, Tony speaking in his own weird tech language, Tony, Tony, Tony. Steve has a door shut in his face, and he is briefly aware that he was shoved into a rather small, packed closet. Yeah. Peggy sure felt small in his arms earlier.
She doesn’t ask him to stay. Instead, Morgan beams at him, looking so much like Tony it both hurt and warm Steve at once. “Have a safe trip, Dad.”
"From the start…?" It was amazing how Tony could still find his voice, weak as it was. Steve knew about Afghanistan. The kidnapping. Did he knew about the arc reactor as well, then? Knew Tony needed it to stay alive?
Steve scoffs. He hasn’t known what he’s been doing for years. But Sharon shouldn’t know that. No one should.
Steve’s grin almost made Tony want to turn his damned suit off so he couldn’t see. “But you already are a part of this. You’re an Avenger, Iron Man.”
On a whim that was not quite a whim, yet a kind of feeling he couldn’t describe, Tony ordered JARVIS to destroy all the file on the Avengers members, preserving only those that were critical to, what was it Avengers did,
"I don’t know what Fury told you, but you can’t trust him."
Words of trust, from Tony. Things hasn’t exactly worked out the way Steve (and probably Tony) wanted it to so far, but hey. One of the ways humans improve is by improvising, right?
Steve charges at the first creature he sees once Sharon is out of sight, whipping his shield from his back and slamming it into the shrieking face. The cloth rips from the impact and Steve is fine with that. Slapping the star on his chest, he flings his shield like a frisbee, slicing all in its path like butter. By the time its back in his hands, Steve looks just like his 2012 counterpart.
go. A place that is both accessible and secure. Preferably somewhere he can stay too. He pulls out the storage device again, because Tony’s live GPS tracker slash map is much better than what they have on the jet. He looks out for places for interest.
Steve starts to perform CPR, but remembers Tony’s in a
with his
The question had occurred to him one night, Steve and him lying and relaxing together. No, they hadn’t
“I love you.” Not thank you, or I’m sorry, because they’re way past that.
Videos - footages - pinged around him. People running, screaming. The largest screen, though, of a news station going Live, was a footage of New York skies, a large wormhole overseeing the city. And
He stops thinking, shrugs, and stands, biting down on his own smile. “Alright, then. Just don’t regret it later!”
There was a split second where he thought the voices sounded familiar, and oh fuck, the realisation that he was alive, and
And so, you see, Tony had come to the obvious conclusion that every time he had something good within his reach, it would be ripped away from him, like a child whose parents decided he was in fact
But he didn’t. What good was a genius if he didn’t use his brain before he spoke? There was a voice in his head telling him
In which Steve tries too hard to keep things canon compliant and screws up. Potential domino and-or butterfly effect? Totally.
“Yeah… Yeah, kind of. Where’s Thor?”
And then, afterwards, when they were sure the SHIELD side was clear, they’d gone for a meal together. The team, that was. In their uniforms, no less, Tony slurping his noodles in a way that would have the chef tossing him out if not for the group of people he was with.
When Steve pauses, so does the agent, who looks at him expectantly. He clears his throat once when he feels it closing up. He doesn’t think he’s ready to say his friend’s name so casually, so he straightens himself and settles for a stiff, “I want to see what’s left.”
Tony gagged, stomach lurching as the memory of their meeting was splattered in black.
Tony wanted to shout.
“That’s me. Look, if you want to kidnap me, can you try again tomorrow? I’ve kind of hit my quota of people for the day. Or week, I suppose. It
He’s in a suit of Tony’s colors - gold, and red. And Tony, vice versa. At least, he
Resigning to his fate, Steve turns - there’s Sharon Carter, staring at him with justified suspicions, and Peggy, on the wheelchair. She’s 88 this year, but she still looks so healthy, and she breaks into a bright, breathtaking smile when she sees him.
With coffee pumping through his veins, Tony had a lot more brain to spare. He folded his arms, pushing out his chest. "Try me."
The nightmares never truly stop. Even now, albeit rarely, Tony dreams of the Chitauri, of the world’s end, of stepping into a battle 87.4% sure that it will be his end. But Steve is always there when Tony wakes, drenched in sweat and gasping for breath. He will hold Tony close, remind Tony who he is, that he’s safe, they’re here and only this is real.
“And Cap. Seriously, okay? Go get a life.”
Steve walks up on the next platform, because he doesn’t trust himself too close to Tony. He tries to at least get himself comfortable, but it’s hard. He can go through this infinite times and still not know what’s a good conversation starter to someone who just lost a friend.
Yinsen. God, Yinsen, who was so kind, so knowing. So
“Hey,” Steve greets from the kitchen where he’s washing the vegetables. He thought he should cook once in a while, instead of Peggy always (it’s also because he isn’t fond of peas, but Captain America can’t possibly say that). He turns the tap off, dries his hands, and turn to face her.
“But, Sir, the arc reactor-”
“Stark,” Steve nods, pulling off his cap because what is the point of wearing it in Tony’s workshop (it’s not a trick question; there’s none at all)? But then Tony’s looking at him funny. A beat. Then two. Steve stares back. “What?”
“Steve! You’d never guess what I found!” And Tony had taken him by the hand, fingers entangled, and he was led to a clearing with the most breathtaking sight of the stars he’d ever seen since he was a boy.
Tony’s invention, after all, he should know himself well enough for a thousand page essay) Steve hasn’t gone through a quarter of it by the day Sharon returns, a week and two days after the invasion.
His first reaction was to moan, a soft, content sound. Then he swallowed it before it could be heard by Steve, because there was no doubt the coffee was a Steve Rogers brew. Tony had flown so many places, drank so much coffee, but no one made coffee like the way Steve did. It was honestly ruining the one good thing Tony had going in his life. He had the strangest urge to crawl into a corner and cry; something to do with nostalgia, perhaps. Or pain.
And because Tony still couldn’t understand what was going on, “Uhhh, I’m usually all for breaking the rules, but I don’t really know what’s going on and -”
If nothing else, the words
Mainly because he realises he doesn’t exactly have a plan, Steve decides to unlock the briefcase. Opening it, he sees the cushioning specially designed to contain the six Infinity Stones. They’re empty now, the Stones restored to their rightful time and place. Steve removes the cushioning to reveal a second layer - there are a few sets of clothing he’s packed for travelling where he’d needed to keep a low profile, including his old suits, which takes up nearly no space thanks to nanotech. They’re reduced to the star on his chest, similar to Tony’s arc reactor.
They approached a Quinjet that was darker color than the rest. The Avengers Quinjet, Hill had explained when he’d glanced at her. Barton, or Hawkeye, Tony supposed he should get used to calling, took the pilot seat. Everyone seemed to have their own assigned seats, so Tony just sat where it was empty, next to the Hulk. A steaming cup of coffee was pressed into his hands, and he tried to convey his gratitude to Hill through the helmet.
When her breathing is even, Steve folds the wheelchair and sets it against Peggy’s bed before stepping out to the living area, where Sharon stands with her arms crossed.
, JARVIS always meant
Fury, who was standing in the shadows with his arms crossed, shrugged. Something in that moment struck Tony as
Steve shouldn’t blush because that’s
Of all the things, Steve didn’t expect problems security-wise. He’s Captain America. An Avenger. Tony Stark’s colleague. Why won’t he be granted access? Because he’s from 2023 and doesn’t have the resources he’s supposed to (duh!, an image of Tony mocks him). Again, shit. Truly, he’s feeling like he’s on the top of the world. Master Tactician and Strategist, they call him. He’ll snort at it some other time.
Steve looks up at Thor. He looks… apologetic. A little sad, maybe. But nothing close to how Thor grieved over Natasha and Tony back in 2023. That’s when Hulk roars, and Tony-- the bastard’s eyes shoot open, wide and confused as they dart around.
“Dammit, sneaky spies,” Tony mutters but otherwise, he doesn’t seem to mind. So Steve clears his throat, demanding his attention again. He’s an authority, he reminds himself. He’s supposed to sound like he’s here on business.
“Thank you, Peggy,” he manages to choke out, stroking the embossment of his name on the tag. It’s cool to the touch, yet searing upon his skin. “Thank you.”
ages with each year, as though that isn’t the norm, and isn’t that what he’s been looking for?
“Shh… You don’t have to say anything, soldier. This is who you are. I wouldn’t have fallen in love with you otherwise.”
He kisses her cheek, and Pepper does the same before disappearing from the frame. Tony’s full attention is on him now, arms folded. The genius inventor looks like he hasn’t slept in three days (and he probably hasn’t). “So, to what do I owe the displeasure of an unannounced visit from Captain America himself this very fine night? And do I even want to know how you have my personal address?”
Steve just hopes he makes it in time. According to the files, it’s one week away from the day of the attack. He has actually never been to Tony’s mansion.
for them to come to this point? They have so many flaws, but so God help him, Steve will do it all again in a heartbeat.
(it was true, he had something to work on; he just couldn’t remember what), they’d quieted and let him go.
He’s ready to leave, to find a way back to Peggy’s house because the Quinjet is in pieces and he-- well, he doesn’t have cash on him. If he can at least find a bike amidst the mess…
“He was doing his job.”
the plot thickens TM
living way off the grid, but it’s not like nobody knows where they are. Steve decides to never step into a city again after year 2023, after the day he had fought Thanos in his own timeline. It’s one thing to return to the past, and another completely to see a future he has no rights to. What it’s like in the future isn’t knowledge he wants to bring back to his time. After all, the only reason he’s returned (and now decided to
“Don’t worry, Steve. It’s just you and Tony, and
Steve keeps his smile on his face. “Nothing out of the ordinary. Just some otherworldly force at work, and trying to kill humanity.”
Steve had started being actively fed current news a while before the whole Mandarin attacks thing blew up. But back then, he hadn’t known Tony would’ve gotten involved. Nobody did. Steve couldn’t do anything, because by the time news of Tony Stark having gone missing hit the papers after an attack on his mansion, he was already presumed dead. And Steve? A part of him grieved, a part of him was in disbelief, but he had gone on with his missions, because there were still things he had to do.
“Uh, hello? You okay there…” Tony glances at his name tag, frowns a little. “...Rogers?”

tempted to lift his faceplate to get them to shut up, but no one could know he was Iron Man,
“Don’t hold it against me,” he apologises and moves on before he starts feeling bad for them. It surprises him when he faces even more agents - what are they doing all the way back here? There’s nothing here, unless there actually

The agent nods. “Of course, sir. I’ll let patrols know not to disturb you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
He kneels by the rocker, taking her hands in his. “Where’s Sharon?”
But Tony looks at him expectantly, a mischievous glint in his eyes, as though he has an idea of what Howard meant by
“Also Steve Rogers.” He keeps his eyes on hers. This way she’ll know he tells the truth.
If he could just throw the damn thing back in the wormhole with a missile or two…
Black Widow’s full name was Natasha Romanoff, or, if you’re brave slash crazy (mainly that) enough like Hawkeye aka Clint Barton, you called her Nat. She was a Russian spy who got on SHIELD’s radar, and was now a valuable ally to have. She didn’t elaborate further about her life before SHIELD, and Tony was tactful enough to keep his mouth shut. He’d have their files soon enough.
chance
Unsurprisingly, challenging Murphy’s Law never boded well. Whatever could go wrong,
Tony almost laughed in his face. He’d been in grave danger since it was decided he was to be born to one Howard Stark. He was in grave danger right now, just to himself, because he was dying, because he was accelerating his death by standing here in this moment as Iron Man. It was some form of miracle that Tony remained silent, simply inclined his head, waiting for Steve to elaborate.
Rhodes swore, a creative string of words Tony hadn’t heard since he returned from his presumed death. Pepper released a sharp breath, eyes three shades darker than he was used to.
he realises.
“DUM-E, can you be a good boy and grab me a cup of black coffee?”
Steve always tries to come up with something to say. Now, there are no words. A dog tag to a soldier means many things. Identity. Status. Comfort. To Steve, it used to be a proud, physical proof that he’s achieved all he’s ever wanted.
“DateNight protocol?” Steve can’t help but inquire.
“Sometimes, it’s the only thing that keeps us going.”
Steve’s by his side in a second, helping him down on a stool. Tony’s pale as a sheet. “Tony? Tony, breathe.”
“I suggest staying indoors for the rest of the day.”
. Steve thinks he might have.
Where was he? Ah, right. He’d shown up in his best
, and Tony loved him a little more. He parted his feet and spread his arms as JARVIS assembled his armor, and he felt a little better once the face plate closed down, shielding him from the world. Then he saw the floating ship that was coming straight for him, watched as his sensors picked up dozens of the alien bastards it carried and muttered, "Fuck" before rushing right at it.
He smiles back, teeth and all. Pepper has the ability to make you want to smile at her like that (and that’s probably why she is a perfect match for Tony). “Thank you, Ms. Potts.”
Steve looked momentarily taken aback, blinking those wide, baby blues before continuing. “No- But also yes. SHIELD is compromised, and we - those of us here - are undercover now, trying to distinguish who we can trust, and who we can’t.”
hungry now. Can we just wait for the God and Cap there?”
And, well, where first mistakes are made, the second soon follows.
For what Steve thinks may be the first time ever, JARVIS doesn’t answer Tony immediately. But because he’s Tony’s creation, the creator doesn’t have to repeat himself before the AI catches on. “Of course. Just one moment, Sir.”
The world tilts. Steve loses balance and slams against the wall with a grunt. Boxes come tumbling at him, and he blocks his face with his arms, but thankfully the boxes are empty and do no damage. There’s the blaring sound of an alarm as his vision flashes red. It’s light from a beacon in the corner of the storage room.
Steve swallows, lowers his head, and punches in Tony’s order. “Sorry, sir. Hot coffee, black, takeaway, yes?”
It’s happening. It was happening, karma had once again caught up to him. Tony’s sins ran so deep karma was targeting the people closest to him. He couldn’t be bothered to pull something over his tank top, just tossed himself off the bed while JARVIS started up one of his cars. Fuck, fuck,
Hologram Tony had looked to be deep in thought for a moment, then cleared his throat.
told me not to get involved. Well, whatevers. J, could you pull up info on the Mandarin I was looking over earlier?”
In a voice Steve thinks is filled with awe and pride, Fury announces, “I now pronounce you husband and husband.”
and she’d kissed his cheeks.
He looked down at his hands, only realising then that he was fiddling with his wedding band. Suddenly exasperated, Tony wiped a hand down his face. It came off greasy, because he hadn’t showered for over twenty four hours. "Really, it’s fine. It’s my fault for seeing something was wrong, y’know? Tony Stark and commitment should never be in the same sentence…"
And when something flickered in Steve’s eyes, for that blink and you miss it moment, Tony added his time serving the nation to the list of things to look into later. He might’ve felt bad if they didn’t look into him first, the sneaky little bastards.
"The ones who brought ya here. Think me crazy if ya want, but I ain’t lying when I say they’re aliens looking to take over the world."
“Okay. If you’re fine with it, I’d love to spend the night over.”
Steve finally manages a shaky breath after she is gone. He just doesn’t want anyone to see him like this. Not yet, when the world still needs him to be strong. Closing his eyes and gathering whatever courage he can get, Steve turns the knob, and enters the room.
“We’re not the vows yet!” Someone shouts, and there’s laughter that resounds within the small hall.
(i really am sorry.) hope to see you back here when the fic gets going again!
The second half of their lives, as one may expect, isn’t all sunshine and rainbows. They stick with the team, reasoning it with ‘They need time to adjust. Just a little longer’ when all it’s really about is that they aren’t ready to part with all
“Then who is that Director Fury asked me to keep watch over?”
Morgan arrives then, alone, looking so much like the little girl from when she first joined the family, Steve can’t believe he thought he’d be able to leave without seeing her one last time. They embrace, Morgan sobbing, Steve holding her.
sat alone in his workshop, drank his smoothie, swapped out his arc reactor, and sat his ass down on his favorite stool, asking JARVIS to pull out all the data he’d collected the past few hours. They were categorised in order of their timestamp, Tony skimming through subjects of interests. And he’d paused just short of tapping into the files which contained classified information of the Avengers. Things he (anyone) would want to know, even when he’d gone head first into the mess.
Peggy’s smile widens into a child-like grin. “Just like old days.”

Now, standing outside the room of Tony Stark, who will never have the chance to step foot inside, Steve feels somewhat sick. The agent seems to empathise. “Will you be alright, sir?”
He still hasn’t really registered Tony’s words when he hears, “And yeah, that’s about all I wanted to say. It’s your choice, Cap. No pressure. No sarcasm, by the way, just in case you were wondering.”
“You are--”
It works like a charm. Rogers’ hand is gone, and his boots crunch on the debris surrounding them. “Loki! Right, I have to get to Loki. Really, I’m very thankful for your help. Please call out to me if you ever see me on the streets, it’d be my honor to share a meal with you.”

"Where’s this Loki guy? If we get him, the army will surrender, right?" Tony blasted at an alien that was charging toward him, and heard its cry as it hopefully fell to its demise.

now even. And that’s the one thing that truly haunts him. Steve’s never forgotten who he really is. He never lets himself forget that he comes from a different timeline, messed this one up (too, the darkness in his mind adds) with his good intentions, and found his way to Tony (but at what cost?). That the time he has now is stolen, that one day this will all catch up to him.
Changing into the outfit and packing his basic necessities into a backpack, Steve shoots a long text to Sharon, so long it’s split into two parts, because that’s what old phones do. The first half, he asks for a favor, and to quote exactly:
she laughs. It’s still a little tense between them, but she’s taking it much better than Steve ever would’ve. Then again, he’s only known a world of war. It should be obvious by now that things are vastly different in this modern world.
Steve waits for his tears to dry before he stands, returning indoors. He turns to the wall clock, next to their wedding photo. He still has time, but maybe he’s had more than he should. It’s time to go. He slides their dresser drawer open. It’s where he keeps his favorite drawing of Tony, the first one he’s drawn ever since he’s arrived. He folds it neatly, keeping it in his shirt pocket.
Brown eyes seek out the blue of his own, and Tony is all but whispering, “She told me she loved me 3000 times. My calculations -never wrong, by the way- tells me she loves you maybe 900 times, max? Wow.”
. So Tony waved a finger. "Hit me with it."
This is in no way an ending; the second half of their lives has barely begun.
"I’ve already signed the divorce papers. All the money you’ve spent on me the past few months will be transferred back to your account once we receive confirmation on the divorce."
"Tony, I told you, don’t do that," Steve scolded without heat, and who could resist those perfectly kissable lips? So Tony tugged him by his hand, bringing his face down for a ticklish kissing session that had Steve pulling away laughing. "
Tony would scoff if he didn’t know it’d make his head explode in pain. Was this considered kidnapping? Well, he
“Project Extremis. Right. That sounds familiar. J, keep a note on that, will you? Send that along with the rest.”

Only two days since Tony’s death. One since the simple funeral they held for him.
Steve breaks into a relieved grin and feels the strength leave him. “We won.”
One thing was for sure; there was no Thai food in sight. There wasn’t any building in sight; they were in an open field, in the distance trees, trees, and more trees. It was a little disappointing for Tony, who was starting to feel the effects of not having any proper meals in the last sixty hours or so. Cicadas croaked around them, to Tony’s ears sounding like a futile plea for help from those who were left behind before the seasons changed.
"Which time?" He’d snarked before remembering,
Steve accepts the note. “A date?”
2012 Rogers is trying to kick the door open. Steve rolls his eyes and pulls it open, because the door is perfectly functioning and was not locked. Trying to look anywhere but himself, Steve extends a hand and he grips himself tightly, pulling him out of the car. The moment 2012 Rogers is on his feet, Steve turns his back on him, trying to look smaller and anything but Captain America.
"Tony!"
It’s a holographic storage device of Tony’s - just one of his many inventions he’s never had the chance to perfect before he… you know. To be fair, he’s built it in one night. Adding on the figuring of the while time travel stuff, it’s pretty amazing. It has the capacity to store all the information of the things the Avengers have done, as a team or on their own. Their profiles. Places of interests… Etc cetera. Kind of like their own Wikipedia, Natasha had remarked with a smile.
They share a brief moment of comfortable silence. Then, “Steve, dear, can you look in the second drawer?”
Tony woke almost peacefully. He was lying face up on cold concrete floor, the ceiling just as bland as the empty cell he was locked in. It was strangely so hospital
“Stark?” For a second Tony thought about how the barista didn’t call him

“Sometimes there isn’t a way out, Tony.” Steve doesn’t manage to stop himself from saying Tony instead of Stark. An honest mistake on his end. Thankfully Tony seems too riled up to have noticed, or to make a remark about that slip up.

Steve had wanted to turn the message off. He had a feeling he knew what Tony was trying to say.
He (thankfully) didn’t get the chance to dwell on it for they’d arrived at their destination, disappointingly still somewhere in the States, if Tony’s tech was anything to go by. (And JARVIS, to his credit, Tony realised, had remained silent since Steve’s appearance on the Helicarrier. If he’d said anything, it would’ve taken one second to put the pieces together. There was no living soul who had JARVIS’ voice. Not a single one.)
Not this time, not if Steve can help it (he doesn’t know what he’ll do if he doesn’t).
“He was way out of his league. He should’ve waited. He should’ve…”
is Steve’s first thought. But thinking back now, his WWII memories are getting further, replaced by newer memories. And oddly enough, he finds himself to be okay with that. “Just like old days.”
He and Tony stare at each other for a moment. Then Tony shrugs and waggles his armored fingers. “Need a lift?”
for the last time, he’s
“Um-”
There was apparently an alien species named the Skrulls that had infiltrated governments world-wide in an attempt to overtake Earth. And somehow they’d found allies in a terrorist group called HYDRA (Tony recalled hearing the name more than once during some of his cleanup missions, and filed it for intensive researching later), who aided them in assassination and impersonation. Oh, yes; Skrulls could change their appearance

“Uh, hi guys,” he managed to force out as he took his first glance of the room - a small meeting room, it was. Around the table sat familiar and unfamiliar faces, paused mid conversation as their attention was on Tony. Panes of glass on the other side of the room gave them the view out at sea. “I’m Iron Man.”
“No.” Steve answers on default.
With Fury, by Pepper. Steve understands the reference. About the Helicarrier, perhaps? His co-worker passes him the coffee, which he passes to Tony. He tries for a bright smile. “I’m sorry to hear that. If it helps, I hope you have a nice day.”
They both take a step backwards, and suddenly, Peggy is out of reach again. But she’s smiling the entire time. When he smiles back, when he turns away, when he loses the smile, he knows she’s still smiling. A single button puts him back in the suit, and he holds in his hand the tiny bottle of Pym Particle. He knows which time he needs to return to. To make things right, even if they’re wrong.
specific circumstances.
Next to him, Thor starts spinning his hammer to gather energy. “He’s not slowing down.”
His husband all but snorts, sinking into Steve’s arms, absent-mindedly stroking the golden retriever’s fur. "Course it isn’t."
Instead, their close friends -namely, the Avengers and those loosely related- drop by once a year for barbeque night and sleepovers. Almost like team bonding, but
“Of course I made the right call. I’m a genius, after all.”
As Steve has an internal debate with himself, he finds himself parking the jet on a high roof, and standing at the entrance of Peggy Carter’s doorstep in Washington, DC with the briefcase in hand. Yeah, he definitely memorised her phone number
He was met with silence as he steadied himself, face burning an even hotter shade of red than his suit of armor. Was that a muffled snort he heard from Hill’s direction? Probably not.
Back then, Steve might’ve frowned. Might’ve thought they shouldn’t be advertised like this. Now, he just sees them as happier times. He wonders how the team felt when they saw this. How they feel
There’s a collection groan throughout the room and a “Christ, Tony, this is a
"SHIELD, like you guys?" Tony deadpanned. He was starting to get annoyed. He signed the damn contract. Yinsen’s voice never left his head;
from the moment we met.”
The Hulk. That sounded familiar. Tony couldn’t quite put it together yet. Why was that again? Oh right; he had a hangover. And he hadn’t had coffee in over twelve hours. Coffee. Something about that made his mind fizzle too. Why was his heart pounding so quickly, his blood a loud rush in his ears?
JARVIS was reading his vitals, his usual calm voice sounding almost panicked. It calmed Tony in an odd way, and he didn’t feel the familiar fear whenever he was submerged underwater. In fact, it was stupid, incredibly so, how the last thought he had before he blacked out was,
“Anything we can do to help?”
Tony’s smile dim, then immediately brightens again, though it doesn’t reach his eyes, doesn’t make them shine. “On a plane to Hawaii for an interview? We talked, last night. Alot. Some shouting I’m amazed you slept through. We, uh, decided we’re taking a break.” Steve’s eyebrows shoot up, and Tony gives a (fake) light-hearted shrug.
He’d promised Pepper, Rhodey and Happy he wouldn’t let his emotions cloud his judgement, and now was a very good time to follow up on that.
His mind and mouth mixed the order up. Deep, frowning eyes turn to look at him. Yup, definitely should’ve gone with Stark. They aren’t close enough yet, not before Rogers meet the Winter Soldier and the Avengers begin raiding HYDRA bases together after the entire SHIELD incident. Steve tries for a polite smile when all he wants is to beam at his friend. “Hi.”
. JARVIS, enhance that image and add it to the list. And tell Happy to watch his back, okay? I want him reporting to work at six tomorrow, no excuses.”
“Was he married?” Way to go, Steve.
Steve winces. He did know, of course. You don’t spend months reading up files and articles and journal entries on someone(s) and
So they walked, shoulder to shoulder, JARVIS scanning everything in sight and beyond, keeping Tony updated in the safety of his suit. SHIELD files and data filled his screen; he asked innocent questions and tried to match Hill’s answers to what he saw. He was on board the Helicarrier - a SHIELD aerial carrier that also acted as a ship, the way it did now. Parts of its engines seemed to be damaged,
“With SHIELD,” Sharon repeats. Steve misses the Sharon he knows. His neighbor, his colleague, his friend. “
first of all, thank you for all the kudos and comments! chapter two has been born, and ive made some edits (cough beta-ed maybe) to chapter one for this to make more sense? tags and summary updated as well (:
He goes by the small alleys, the underground, jumping over rooftops. Avoiding the Avengers and the mass while helping in the shadows. It’s selfish, but every one more person he can save right now, in the past? Steve will. And that? That’s his first, unofficial mistake.
He does. He helps Sharon in supporting Peggy to her room, and they lay her down on bed with some difficulty, out of breath because gosh, simply existing seems like a chore when you’re past a certain age. Sharon’s phone rings and she leaves while Steve stays. He doesn’t say anything this time, just watches Peggy softly. Everytime he thinks he’s ready to say goodbye to his best girl? Well, he’s not.
It wasn’t old news. He liked spectators witnessing his success, but he liked surprising people he loved more. He liked making the people he liked happy. And he
what Tony expects to see, but he fails. “Jesus, Stark,” he mumbles without real heat. Before he can think better, “Where’s Pepper?”
Tony takes one exact minute to stop laughing long enough to answer in a mock serious voice, “Careful there, Sonny, or you won’t be invited to our wedding and end up being known as the prodigal son."
The pilot is the same pilot he, Natasha and Clint took the first jet from. It’s a small world. “Sorry, not taking questions.” Then he knocks the poor guy out with his shield before anyone else arrives. He estimates three hours and ten minutes before the Chitauri army arrives.
"Steve Rogers. I was recruited by Agent Coulson a year ago, after being discharged from the army."
sung praises about, a feat he thought impossible until the very moment. He fell, hard and fast, too gone to see the signs, to see the obvious, because how could anyone love someone like him?
“Steve!” She sounds delighted, none of that shock when he visited her in the retirement home in 2016. This is without a doubt, the same Peggy he’d returned to dance with. Sharon leans down to her great-aunt, “You know him, aunt Peggy?”
And when it’s put that way,
He corrects himself. “JARVIS, how’s his heart rate?”
Tony’s eyes wander and land on something. Coulson’s blood stains, Steve realises. “He made it personal.”
So the next morning, he’d shown up to the coffee shop with fresh flowers in hands, because if there’s one thing his Mom taught him, it’s that the language of flowers were one of the most heart-felt things in the world. And Tony’d be damned if he didn’t listen to his mother, who managed to get
"Boy," of course it’s Barton who spoke up, Tony was beginning to understand what kind of man he was, "That was awwwwwwkward. So, anyone up to try that new Thai place? We can hijack one of the Quinjets."
Time to get back on topic. "So, SHIELD’s head is actually a bad guy? Isn’t the whole organisation screwed then?"
“The very same?”
again.
"Welcome to the team. I’m Black Widow, and this loudmouth -" she pointed a thumb, elegant, at Barton, "- is Hawkeye. We’re also SHIELD agents."

bring up the invasion again without good reason. Tony’s hidden it well for years, but looking back, Steve doesn’t know how he missed all the signs that the invasion had changed Tony.
Short and sweet; now wouldn’t Pepper be so proud of him for biting back his snarky remarks? And then he wondered; what would she think of becoming the new CEO of Stark Industries? But first, he had to get her stamp of approval as an Avenger before the official press release by the government.
“Maybe you’re not that much a Capsicle as I thought. To celebrate my genius,
please let me know what you think in the comments! <3
"You don’t know for sure until you try," Happy insisted.
“I had to leave before I was exposed,” Widow explained. “All I caught was something about Project Insight, which had something to do with the Avengers. I approached Hawkeye and Hill, and we decided it best to include the Avengers. Me, Hawkeye, Cap, the Hulk, and Thor. That was one week ago. Well, Thor’s still attending to Loki’s matters on Asgard, but that’s all of us.”
They reached the end of the hallway, stopping before a closed door that looked about as plain as all the other days. There was muffled sounds of casual conversation from the other side. Hill stepped aside, gesturing Tony forward. "The Avengers are waiting for you inside, Iron Man."
hello! very much sorry that this chapter took way longer than i thought it would. kind of hit a wall when i realised the story isn't headed where i really want it to (rip)
He’s smiling too, whispering back, “I know. Sorry. Just one hell of a day.”
Tony waited for the tears to come. There was none. He tried to search himself for anger. There was none of that too. He was a hollow shell. Then he recognised one thing - resignation. Yeah, he could deal with that. Of course Steve left. Everyone eventually would, wouldn’t they?
He was sure his butler, Jarvis, the human one, had put in a few good words for him in Heaven, if one for humans existed, to have kept him alive thus far. He’d gotten so lucky, to have met Rhodes, who tolerated him and called him out and smiled at him and called him
Muttering more apologies, Steve’s feet carry him down to the basement and
her, because even though she is right here, this isn’t his timeline, this Peggy Carter isn’t his, not really. Now, the real Steve Rogers has gone under ice, where he will remain for several decades to come. His heart starts thudding hard against his chest, the same nervousness he always feels around Peggy, as the song nears its end.
“Hush, J. Don’t make me mute you, buddy. I’m fine. I’m okay. It’s nothing. Just.” He clutches his arc reactor, and
“Captain America?” Her words are strained. Forced.
Steve had raised his brows, gaze dropping to Tony’s goatee. "A beard?"
“Oh.” Tony seems to go complete slack upon hearing that, letting himself go limp in Steve’s arms. “Thank fuck. Thought I was gonna be rejected before I could even get out the ring.”
It was right about when he’d decided to raise the question of why Steve held the title of Captain America that his alarm went off. And thank God for that. Tony wanted to interact with Steve as little as he possibly could; he knew he had tells, big ones, and that something would blow up for sure if they reunited as Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. As amusing as it might sound, boy did he not want to touch that can of worms.
but because of how worried
“Don’t get all smart with me just cause I give you all this leeway, J. What was I thinking?” Tony adds, muttering more to himself, then almost like an afterthought, he turns to Steve, “See you up there,  Cap. Don’t take too long.” And he’s gone. Leaving Steve and his counterpart. Again.
, and Steve because he isn’t sure this is happening, isn’t sure this isn’t an illusion cast by Loki or some other God of Mischief in existence. This is different from New York; there isn’t a life at stake, no urgency in fighting against time to pump air into a lifeless body.
A thick stack of paper landed at his feet with a flop.  He blinked twice at it before raising his brows at the intruder. “What’s this?”

Then she sees the hole in the sky, the
It was then that he saw the suitcase that was in fact the Iron Man armor in the corner of the room, with an ugly, ripped-from-a-notebook note stuck on it with cheap tape. Sucking in a deep breath, Tony stood, waited for his world to right itself, and wobbled his way to tear the offending slip of paper from his suit.
“Alright. I won’t pry.” She straightens herself, hands by her side. Steve’s actually taken aback. Sharon Carter, if not anything else, is persistent. “You won’t?”

, he decided to leave a huge tip for the barista he assumed was in-charge of brewing Earth’s mightiest coffee. And, yes, Tony could admit the barista was well-built, but he was also likely too young, and things went to shit immediately after that anyway, for Steve had frowned at the bills Tony pulled out of his wallet, and strongly rejected the tip. Which then led to a heated argument, and the gathering of a crowd, which meant phones and video recordings and bam, Tony Stark was viral for the first time in a long
Rhodey had mentioned it once, a near decade ago, when they were still young enough to go through party after party and partied till they dropped,

“Jesus Christ, why don’t you have a little faith in me, JARVIS.”
“FRI…”
“Huh.” Tony grunts as he gets himself back on feet. Steve’s still on the ground, strength not fully back. Age may just very well be catching up. “’Aight then, see you up there… Uh, where’s my faceplate? JARVIS? Hello?”
“Ugh, my head. Did you bring me here when I was out cold. Thank you for your help, sir. But you shouldn’t be in the city now. You need to get out of here, right now.”
“Don’t aliens eat?”
There is an outstretched arm and an open palm, silently asking for the flash drive. “Sir?” JARVIS sounds as though he is in awe. Over what, Steve will likely never be able to guess. Instead, he drops the flash drive on Tony’s waiting palm, watches as he wrinkles his nose, praying nothing will give away the fact that this is all just
Tony will try to pretend he doesn’t have feelings by acting tough. Steve will allow it, just this time. He’s missed all of these interactions more than he had been willing to admit. Things have been so hard for too long, he’s forgotten what it’s like to breathe easy. “Sure you are, Tony.”
But then there is a beep, and the door slides open. Seeing that, Tony turns, frown back in place. “Hey, who allowed--

“Phil Coulson was a good man,” It was Agent Hill, her tone inviting no argument. “He lost his life in an effort to subdue Loki.”
"As you wish."
Tony’s red down his neck, and he groans. “Fuck you, Rogers.”
“No,” Tony snaps. From his tone alone, Steve can guess he’s sulking, hand on his hip and staring with a ’I dare you to talk back to me’ look. “Shawarma first. I called ahead, don’t make me cancel on them.”

could know who he was. No one could know Tony Stark was Iron Man. He couldn’t trust anyone, not outside of Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, and his bots. No one could get their hands on the suit and weaponise it and kill more innocents. Everything hurt, but Tony’s panic triumphed the pain and he croaked out,

It takes a little more than a decade before they figure a way to neutralise the effects of the Super Serum. There are risks - there’s always risks in science and experiments - but when they think about the reward and how there’s technically nothing much left to lose, they approach it light-heartedly. And maybe it’s some faraway God who takes pity on them, or maybe Tony’s just that much of a genius (Tony
“What I do best.”
That night, after a long conference call about Iron Man and another video call with Pepper and Rhodey involving a lot of mother hen-ing, was the first night Tony had a dream where no one was dying in a long time. It was terrifying, how quickly he’d let the group of strangers in. Maybe Rhodey and JARVIS were onto something after all.
JARVIS’ voice seems to come from every corner of the workshop, blanketing them. “Reboot complete. All systems back online. Glad to be of service, sir.”
"Hmm, let’s just say I have a thing for looking presentable. Never know when a billionaire might take an interest in you."
"You must be Iron Man. Thor told us about how you’d helped during the Chitauri invasion." Thor. The God of Thunder. Right, that was a more believable outcome. If someone had come into contact with Iron Man the way Thor did, it wasn’t entirely impossible to connect the suit to Tony Stark. (And wasn’t that just another concern for him on this team till his inevitable demise?)
"Uh, yeah? Do
But he did not see it then, no sir. He proposed their second month together, and Steve had accepted, and they’d had a private wedding, attended by their closest confidants. There was no need for the world to know; it would just be another thing they disapproved of, and Steve didn’t deserve that. Steve, who’d been orphaned at the wee age of 10, had invited Romanoff and Barton, the first friends he’d made at the orphanage. And being the fool in love he was, Tony asked nothing beyond what he was told.)
JARVIS, you can stop right there. Jesus, who programmed you?”

call me Tony. I’d like to be friends with you, Rogers.”
Before Romanoff could form her own words, Tony was gone.

Instead, because he must be more masochistic than he’d thought, "...Steve, can I just know one thing?"

Immediately after, there’s a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder which he recognises as Thor going home. There’s a huff from Tony. “The big guy and I can do it too. Anyway, shawarma first? I’m
As it turned out, Skrull-Fury had sent out a team of Agents, most probably HYDRA, on a highly classified mission to this town. Hill caught on that something was off, and while Steve, Banner and herself stayed behind to keep the Agents at bay, Romanoff and Barton, both long term SHIELD Agents, took over the mission. It’s a good thing Skrulls don’t seem to be very smart, Hill had observed.

Tony walks in on his second part time job one morning - a coffee shop, because he gets to wear a uniform (the material is thick, hiding the protruding star on his chest) and cap and get intel - nearly two months after the invasion. He’s in his usual pair shades, matched with a T-shirt and pair of jeans Steve’s seen rather commonly during his stay at the Avengers tower.

They stood in a small circle, for no apparent reason, Hawkeye next to Widow, Captain America (Tony was going to find out the history behind that as soon as the files were back online) to her left, then the Hulk, then Tony, and Hill. Eyes seemed to wander to Steve, somewhat expectantly, but the man had his eyes set on the overgrown grass. What the heck was up with him? Shitty was an understatement for Tony’s life the past few months, and he didn’t look like
"Chitauri? Invasion? When was that? I’ve been out of touch with the outside world. Been stuck here as HYDRA’s guinea pig for ’bout six months now."
He never forgets what really happens after New York. Not Ultron, not finding out what Bucky did and keeping the truth from Tony, not the Accords, not Siberia, not the time he spent as a fugitive in Wakanda.

Steve turns to Thor with an exhausted look. “Thor, man, seriously?”
Pepper chuckles, long since immune to Tony’s baseless threats, pushing Steve gently towards the steps. “Don’t take his words to heart, Steve.”

“You have to go, don’t you?”
He forces his body to stop, and to turn to the agent fully, the respect he was raised to show. “Oh, um. Yes, actually.”
See, the thing about Steve and Tony is that they love each other more than they hate each other, but love doesn’t cancel out hate. Disagreements and fights still happen, and even without the Avengers, seeing eye-to-eye on everything is impossible for any couple, let alone these two.

Two shots, two agents down. Steve doesn’t kill them - they’re just under mind control, and really, he’s not back to kill even more people. He’s aimed for their tendons and hit his mark. Those five years after the snap and before the time heist? Steve hasn’t exactly been moping around and telling people to move on every day. He’s a soldier, with or without his shield, and he’s trained with the best they have (had, really, but let’s not go there right now) in firearm.

meant the same thing, now he knew it didn’t). He scolded himself for going off track again, choosing one thing to focus on. "Coulson?"
At that, Steve smiled, something soft that reminded Tony of date nights, and he had to squeeze his eyes shut to erase the memory. The smile wasn’t directed at him. “Agent Hill was confident that you weren’t one of them. In all the time I’ve known her, her judgement’s never been wrong.”
“And why come to me with all this when they have, like, an army of Agents to do the work?”
. Steve knows here, he’s supposed to order
Steve has to turn away. “I’m sorry.” For not being to do anything (again) and for asking. “He seemed like a good man.”
Seeing no other way out, he pinches Tony’s nose with one hand, and places another beneath his chin, parting his lips and closing his mouth over Tony’s for mouth-to-mouth. He blows all the air he can muster into Tony’s lungs and it better reach him, because no way he’s letting Tony die even earlier than he did in Steve’s timeline. But it’s way past the effective time frame of mouth-to-mouth, Steve knows it. He just doesn’t want to stop. He eventually does, because
"Always, Sir." The thrusters fired up, allowing Tony the advantage he desperately needed. The alien ship creaked and made a sound terrifyingly close to a wail, and he started pushing
Hill patted his shoulder, “Give it up, Iron Man. Once Hawkeye set his eyes on a goal, he’s never going to stop till he gets it.”
Steve nearly drops the cup he’s forgotten he still holds.
Best to get straight to the point, right? Stick to the business, and there’s a smaller chance of him screwing this up. “It’s regarding the Mandarin.”
"Tony Stark. Self proclaimed genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist."

And that will soon become the least of his worries.
It’s untimely, how her stomach grumbles at that exact moment. But then they break into laughter, and from behind the door Peggy shouts, “What’s going on?” and Steve thinks this is something he had wanted as Steve Rogers the man, all those years ago. Maybe some part of him still wants it today. That part, he decides, needs to be locked away.
you know.” Steve watches as the hologram Tony links his hands behind his neck, licking his lips the way he did when he was nervous.
. That was… a lot. But then again, they were chatting while an alien army - the Chitauri, Thor called them - terrorised New York. So what if this alien shared the same name and choice of weapon as a God from human myths? Tony filtered out the useless bits, focusing on what was important. Pepper would be so proud of him. Thor was on his side, his brother was the mastermind, and there was some SHIELD organisation also dealing with the threat. Great, he could use that information.
They adopt two dogs - Steve gets to name one and Tony the other, it’s only fair - and a baby girl. When Tony suggests to name their daughter ‘Morgan’, Steve has to turn away and hold back his tears. Tony doesn’t ask - he
“It’s your dog tag,” Peggy confirms, and he can tell she’s pleased at the reaction she’s gotten from him. And Steve… Steve doesn’t know what to make of this. Why is it with Peggy? Well, he has a pretty good idea why
Thor grinned, and it transformed his face from this broody old man to a bright, innocent child. "You would help me stop my brother? I am eternally in your debt, Man of Iron. Trust me; I would not let anything get in your way."
Tony hurries away, and there’s almost a tear in Steve’s eyes as he stays where he is and laughs, so damn thankful to be able to hear
Steve cups Tony’s cheek, gazing into his eyes, trying to communicate his support. “I know you did what you think is best, Tony. If Pepper was willing to go, she must trust and respect your decision too.”
Tony shrugs. “Yeah, well. Some privacy for us, and JARVIS. No one likes to see their Mom and Dad make out, right?”
- Tony, the Steve who came to return the stones… isn’t here. Or maybe he has returned the Mind Stone, just did not make it to the Tesseract. What are the chances?
"Can’t check with all this metal."
Steve, so of course he’d wanted to make surviving their first month as a married couple the most memorable event to date.
Peggy opens the closet door, and while her eyes are smiling, her voice isn’t as bright as it was before. Her lips are still curled upwards as she offers Steve a hand, pulling him back out to the open. This is how it’d be if he wants to stay in the past, won’t it? Being secretive, making sure he isn’t found out.
Tony had sounded hesitant.
All three of them read through the email that’s already been sent, and Steve briefly wonders what is the point of looking back at something that cannot be undone, before he recalls that’s what he’s been doing for more than half his life.
“Stark?”
“He went back to his home to look for clues about where Loki may be.”

that wasn’t their relationship. Then Barton had choked, not out of shock but in laughter, the real kind,
tony meets the avengers as iron man,
“You don’t know me,” he tries one last time.
. He wished his suit system weren’t down so he could try and dial Steve one last time, even though the number he had was no longer in use, because then at least he’d had died
“Well, it’s an old fashioned notion.”
(i suddenly remembered why canon universe isnt that much fun to write from the start; god all the things to flesh out im just trying to get my babies some hurt/comfort smh)
he didn’t think twice, Tony’s mind didn’t register that the Avengers were not even in the States, and even with the upgrades he’d made to Mark 34, it still took over two hours to reach them, and they
“And, uh,” Steve clears his throat, because what he’s about to say next is a topic he doesn’t see himself getting used to,
"Yes, you do."
The car rattles, breaking Steve from his thoughts.
“Peggy--” She really shouldn’t just invite him in like this. What if he’s not him, and… Just someone else. Like Loki?
“I apologise, but I’m afraid Mr. Stark has kept me in the dark about what this… Oh.” And the way the AI gasps, so humane, has Steve in awe, because Tony was just… so... brilliant. He scowls internally at his lack of vocabulary. The words
Steve slams down on the button, and there he goes. Captain America’s last chance with Iron Man. Steve Roger with Tony Stark. What was it he’d said? Oh, yeah.
appears on the screen. Steve doesn’t allow himself to breathe.
“After an alien invasion and Gods, seeing a doppelganger isn’t as earth-shattering anymore, you know? Plus both Intel and my gut says you’re a friendly. That should mean something.”
He tried a charming grin; it always worked, even when he was a broken mess. “You do make a mean cup of coffee.”
Steve was already on his bike, ready to take off, carrying nothing with him. The bike was his, the clothes he was wearing were his… Tony dared not look to see if Steve was still wearing his ring.
“If you somehow find yourself needing a safe place to hide for a bit, enter these coordinates.” Those were the words of Tony Stark to the team who travelled back to 2012 for the Infinity Stones. And those are the coordinates they entered into the device as a preset, as a failsafe of sorts. Turns out Steve’s returning to 2012 with these coordinates willingly.
“Oh hey, it’s the Metal Guy.”
much was similar.
And he knows what 2012 him will be doing - self reflection on that very chair, as he stares at Coulson’s blood stained trading cards. He also knows where 2012 Tony will be. He knows this is when they need the push in the right direction. So he goes to the Detention section, where Loki had killed Coulson.
"Sir, you heart rate is highly above normal. My diagnosis is that you are experiencing a panic attack from the news regarding Mr. Hogan. If I may recommend the 4-7-8 breathing exercise…"
Once he hits private land, Steve goes even faster, because hey, who’s watching him now? He’s still surprised when he makes record time; it’s only nightfall of the same day he’s left. To be fair, he left early. Around five thirty in the morning, when the neighborhood is still quiet, and no one will see him toss himself into the forest on a motorcycle.
." Then Fury produced a pen, and Tony signed without reading past line one on page one, and slid the contract toward Fury.
. The humble home of the Rogers-Stark (or Stark-Rogers, doesn’t matter) family is by no means big. At least, it’s nothing close to what Steve is sure Tony’s used to, but it’s home. There’s more than enough sleeping bags and hammocks to go around, and everyone usually ends up knocked out on the picnic mat anyway.
Then the sun had set, the owls had awoken, and still, no Tony. Steve had paced around the field, their other retriever - E.L.L.Y (don’t ask) trotting next to him. He had been three seconds away from heading into the woods when Tony stumbled out of it, covered in mud, dried leaves, and shallow cuts. But he had been beaming, grin growing impossibly wider when he saw Steve. Becky and E.L.L.Y had barked at each other in greeting, Becky in a similar plight.
feel so… real.
Steve reaches into his chest pocket for the SHIELD flash drive he’d inputted information on the Mandarin. It’s one of Peggy’s flash drive, actually; she’d be kind enough to help him with the tech… Because let’s face it, all the tech stuff… It was just more Tony. Steve can admit he’s not good with
If fewer people start showing up in the following years, Steve and Tony don’t talk about that too. Instead, they talk about how Morgan’s doing in boarding school, about which corner of the world they should escape to during her next break. And sometimes, when they find the other in a corner tear stricken, they join their husband and mourn together.
Jesus. What had Tony signed up for? He skimmed through the same file he had signed but not yet read, marking details that might be of use in the future, and moved on to the important bit - the other members.
"God, Tony!" Her hands, when she leaned away and closed them around his arm in an icy grip, were trembling. Tony decided then that fear was an absolute mismatch for Pepper. She should always be frowning and looking at him disapprovingly, with the occasional exasperated yet fond smile.
, the space is huge, and it almost reminds him of his workspace back in the Avengers Tower and facility. There’s more touches of Tony here, Steve realises as he passes through the open door (courtesy of Pepper), seeing the paintings, photo frames, tools, cars that loitered every corner. Tony was on his stool, mumbling to himself while staring down what Steve believes is a microscope.
From the basement, a muffled voice shouts, “Cap, I would
“We’re in Washington, DC, genius. Aunt Peggy will be much safer here. SHIELD enhanced protection, courtesy of Director Fury.”
He slammed into the front of the ship - shit, was the ship a
"Tony, we
“Neither am I,” Steve assures. “He’s got the same blood on his hands as Loki does. But right now we’ve got to put that aside and get this done. Now, Loki needs a power source. If we can put together a list…”
,” Tony snorts as he imitates Steve, and did he actually sound a tad desperate like that? He supposes it doesn’t really matter; Tony looks more like himself now. “Fine.
, and Tony liked her a little better. She reminded him of Pepper. Ah, crap. Tony gave JARVIS a silent command to send a message to Pepper and Happy that he couldn’t make it to the company today. “So. Fury left a note saying you were unfortunately given the task of briefing me?”
Most of the other files were uninteresting. It seemed SHIELD was a counter terrorism agency under the government. Hill’s answers generally matched the available data. Even so, there were gaps too wide, too obvious, too empty. While he had not spotted any lies, there was something SHIELD was hiding. Tony could work with that.
“Hey, Cap. Uh, just saying, but you might wanna sit down for this.”
So he officially invited Fury to sit, poured him a drink (or two, or more), listened to the one-eyed Jack talk about threats from outer space, and then said yes.
. So he grabbed them and got the hell out of the building as it begun crumbling.
“Can you not be so loud?” Tony hissed, eyeing the empty hallway. His voice had half its usual venom, and thank his genius mind for the voice changer he’d implemented in the helmet. JARVIS had already run a quick scan of the surroundings; he was on some sort of plane, and the long stretch of hallway that looked too military-like for his tastes was empty, but Tony had lived through enough of ’things are never as they seem’.
It’s a strange thing, watching as everyone ages. As
annnnd here's a little cliffhanger. i didn't expect one scene to take up 6k words; i originally wanted to include a bit more of steve heading back to peggy's for more plot, but this seems like a good place to stop! i hope you like the subtle domesticity i slid in this chapter. pepper only agreed to give tony space because she knows tony's become part of something bigger, and instead of waiting till AoU/CACW periods to take a break, tony decides to talk about it now. all because of what steve has done in the past.
he’s living in. He reads through the in-depth profiles of his teammates, and wow, who knew Clint used to be deaf, and that one of Stark Industries’ failed experiments years back turned out to be the breakthrough needed for one of the first cures mankind had for hearing loss? Steve sure as hell didn’t.
