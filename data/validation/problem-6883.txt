“Need money?” Clint parroted.  He tossed the last of the towels into the laundry basket.  “Wait.  You?  You need money?”  DJ gave a quick nod, his face hopeful.  Clint stared at him.  “You need money,” he said again.
Peter braced his hands on his knees, his shoulders rising and falling with the force of his breathing.  "I'm TRYING," he said, his voice tinged with insult.
"In my defense, it was her idea," Clint said, catching the eggs, one after another, and setting them aside.  He shifted the rashers of bacon on the pan and cracked the first egg into the sizzling grease.
Darcy had procured a blanket from somewhere and was now curled into a comfortable looking fabric burrito.  “Let’s see it, Jane.  What’d you get?”
“Then what the hell are you still doing here?” Tony asked, playing with the soft, spiky hairs at the nape of Steve’s neck.
“With the Agent,” Tony said.  Rhodey groaned, and Tony ignored him.  Instead, he glanced towards Pepper, who was staring at him, her mouth a flat line.  “I know.”
Tony glanced up.  The clouds had parted, here and there, fragments of sunbeams cutting through the dark sky.  "Sorry, Cap, don't think that's going to happen today."  He braced a hand on the railing next to Steve's elbow, leaning into it.  Below them, the city was, if not scrubbed clean, than at least refreshed.  The sunlight caught on glass and metal, reflecting the morning into the darkest corners.  Tony smiled.  Maybe a little rain could make things better.
The idea stuck with me, and this came  out of the need to trace a bit of his history in that way.  I understand they hadn't been mentioned before, so they may throw some people. To head off the 'where did Tony's tattoos come from?' comments, the answer is this.
“Hey, Gyrich?”  Tony tapped at the screen with a fingertip, freezing the video in place.  He stared down at the image of the robot coming in for its initial landing.  “If I find a single piece of my tech in this thing?”  He looked up, smiling his most bone chilling smile.  “I'm going to sue you back to the stone age.”
“I’ve forgotten the calling cards,” Mrs. Parker said.  “A gross breach of etiquette, to be sure.”  She stepped back, pulling the door open all the way.  Behind her, Peter was hovering in the hall, DJ’s hand clasped firmly in his.  Mrs. Parker gave them both a smile.  “Go on in, but it’s well past bedtime already.  We won’t be staying long.”
"It's different with grass and trees and clean air,” Rogers said.  “But if it's easier for you to handle, then no.” He smiled.  “We don't have sunlight in Manhattan.  So why not experience it now?”
“Dunno, I stopped reading after the title.”  Ellen leaned forward to pick up the printout.  “'A listing of SHIELD personnel which have gotten married in the last six months.'”  She stared at it for a long moment.  “Fury does not give a shit, does he?”
"Better than I expected," she admitted.  She glanced over at the monitors behind the desk, her brows coming down.  "But it would've been harder if Mr. Stark hadn't interceded with management and approved a couple of weeks of leave so I could help get them settled in here in the city."  She looked back at Steve.  "Don't know how he found out.  But it was very kind of him to do it."
Another moment of stillness, and then something crashed down on her bed, almost sending her flying.  Shrieking, Ellen grabbed for the blankets, clutching them to her chest.  Jesse was sitting in the middle of the mattress, clad in battered cargo shorts and an olive drab tank top, her booted feet hanging off the edge of the mattress.  “Bitch, do not insult my art,” she said, her eyes narrowed at Ellen.  Despite what they'd drunk last night and the painfully early hour, she seemed completely awake and healthy, her dark brown skin clear and her eyes bright beneath the fringe of pink curls that crowned her head.
Steve stared at him, then at Jan.  She gave him a 'what are you waiting for?' look, gesturing at Clint.  "All right.  One hand on his hip, the other, take that, and-”
Tony smiled.  “Yes, I scared myself a little bit, too.”  He pulled his hand back, letting it fall to the blankets next to him.  “I’m sorry.  That was cruel of me.”
Sam nodded, a slight dip of his chin.  "Yes," he said.  "Because Steve was out of commission, and you were with him, and that means that per protocol, I-"
Harris glanced at Darcy, who shrugged.  “Hey, let’s take a moment,” she said, coming up next to DJ.  “We’ll figure it out.”
“Not helping,” Tony told him, stomping down on the bubble of laughter that threatened to escape.  “You insubordinate wiseass.”
“Tony!” Sue snapped, and Tony stopped.  “Why...  There's-”  She squeezed her eyes shut.  “Child.  I can't-  There's-”
Sam considered him.  “He needs more than me,” he said at last.  “Even if I was prepared to be his only friend, his only source of support, the only person he could depend on, that's not healthy, not for either of us.”  He leaned forward.  “He's one of my best friends, and I'm one of his best friends, Tony.  But I am quite certain that he was just as relieved, just as happy, to see you walk through the door tonight as he would've been if it had been me.”
Steve tapped the rim of his coffee cup with one finger, grinning at Clint.  “Didn’t stop him, I take it?”
For a minute, Steve thought the kid would balk.  But pride was hard to maintain on an empty stomach, and the lure of a hot meal won out.  Cautiously, carefully, he lowered himself onto a stool, and took the fork that Clint pushed across the counter to him.  Clint picked up another bowl from the stack.  Without asking, he filled it, and handed it to Steve.  “Keep him company,” he said, and Steve nodded, taking a seat at the counter.
“Sam's incoming, but still at least an hour out,” Jan said.  “Tony, you need to clean up before you go in there, you're just going to-”
“That's definitely true,” Carol said, descending with her arms wrapped around Clint's chest.  He hung limply in her grip, a distinct pout on his face.  “Here, Steve, I found your dance partner.  He's mostly undamaged.”
Tony buttoned the jacket, and glanced at himself in the mirror as Jarvis collected the hanger.  "Well?" Tony asked.
“How convenient.” Stark scrubbed a hand over his face.  “This is-”  He stopped, taking a deep breath.  “Right.”  He turned back around.  “Where is my-”
He stopped, and pulled a bottle of beer out of the fridge.  He considered it, rolling the neck of the bottle between his fingers.  “Right.  I make bad choices.”
“For an old man, he’s doing a good job of running me ragged,” Tony complained, his head falling back against Steve’s shoulder.
He was so lost in his thoughts that he almost missed the slim form that was hovering, some distance from the lobby doors.  Steve slowed down, caught somewhere between wariness and curiosity.
Steve nodded.  “Tonight,” he said, the words barely audible.  “Who know he was going to be there?”  Happy was silent, and Steve’s eyes flicked towards him.  “It wasn’t in the papers.  It wasn’t publicized.  Who knew he was going to be there?”
She let out a chuckle.  "Aren't you polite?"  She pointed at the coffee shop door.  "You must be freezing.  Go on in and tell the girls that Cynthia said she'd pay for your breakfast.  They're used to that."
“Tony, you can-” Steve started, just as Tony flopped onto his back, his hips arching up off the bed so he could shove his pants down over his ass and halfway down his thighs.  That was as far as he got before he gave up, lying half naked on top of the blankets, one arm threw above his head.  He was laughing, low and warm, his eyes closed and his mouth opened.
“Because it is,” Steve said, his voice tight.  “Because some things can’t be bought.  You can’t just HIRE people and get-”  He stopped, his jaw locking in place.  “You just can’t.”
“You can’t afford it,” Tony said, without missing a beat, and Steve made a pained noise. Tony grinned.  “It’s fine, Steve.  It’s just fine.”
“You really sassing the man who’s paying your return fare?” he asked, making a shooing motion.  Laughing, jostling, the boys allowed themselves to be herded towards the doors.  Steve looked back towards Tony.  “Stay here.”
Jarvis and May were perched on wicker chairs, a pot of tea on the tiny table between them.  May had put her broad brimmed straw hat on Jarvis halfway through the meal, and to the delight of both DJ and Peter, he'd left it on, the ribbons tied neatly under his chin.  Now, they watched the boys run across the lawn, their bare feet flying across the crisp, green grass as Peter tried to get a kite in the air.  An occasional burst of wind swept over them, hard enough to send the leaves in the tree above them rattling, but not quite enough to keep the kite aloft.
Steve took an enthusiastic bite out of a garlic knot.  The butter did lovely things to his lips.  "Jarvis has organized every video in the database-"
He slowed, something prickling the skin on the back of his neck.  She smiled, just a little, and Tony took one more step, a pillar coming between them and breaking their eye contact.
“No body asked you,” he said, scruffing the younger boy and pulling him away from the window.  “Matt, go let ‘em in.”  He braced a hand on the window frame, leaning out over the street.  “Before they break down the door.”
“Actually,” he said, shifting his legs, “I was just thinking that this was progress.”  Tony's fingers stilled, and Steve went back to stroking his hair.  “Usually, when you're upset, you tend to-”  He stopped, trying to find a diplomatic way of saying it.  “Find something that needs fixing down in the workshop.”
“Don't forget to come back down when you're done,” Clint said.  He tapped his spatula on the rim of the plate.  “Peter!  Come eat, you've got school.”
Warnings for canon appropriate violence and some discussion (with a little foul language) of the sort of street level sexual harassment that tends to be aimed at women and LGBTQ people, while skipping the actual harassment.
“The space ship had your name on the side, so you might consider yourself uninvolved, but that was definitely a minority opinion,” Pepper said, still studying the tablet.  “The liberal press and the LGBTQ community have, to no one's surprise, come out with tentative approval.”
“Sounds like me,” Tony admitted, ignoring the way that Rhodey was laughing, trying to muffle it behind his hand.  Tony slumped back into his chair, wincing as his shoulder objected.  He rubbed at it.  “That explains the bandage.”
“Yeah, probably.”  Billy disappeared back inside, leaving a few of the other boys to take their turns at the window.  Behind Steve, Happy raised a hand to wave, and all of them ducked back inside.
DJ sniffed, and then rubbed one tiny fist against his nose.  “Yes.”  He sounded more sure now.  More confident.  His eyes flicked up to meet Clint's.  “Can-”  He swallowed.  “Hug?”
“Of course you do,” Tony said, shaking his head.  The onions piled up in front of him in neat, precise crescents.  “Stop upstaging me.  This is my Japanese lesson, not yours, go turn on the stove so I can blanche my broccoli.”
“I did not, I just told you there was an emergency, and you dragged yourself out of bed,” Tony pointed out.  “With flattering speed, might I add.”
Happy glanced in his direction, but he didn’t say anything.  Steve felt his mouth twist into something approaching a smile.  “They threw everything they had at him, as fast as they could.  If that failed, they’re going to fall back, wait for us to relax.  Then they’ll try again.”
DJ reached out, his fingers peeling away a chunk of the bread crust.  Shaking his head, Steve went back to his meal.   He ate, not enough to fill the gnawing emptiness in his belly, but he was used to that, too.  He was used to managing just enough to keep himself going, just enough to take the edge off.
DJ considered that, his eyes narrowed.  “A lot of things,” he said at last, and Tony covered his mouth to hide his smile.
“God, I lo-” The words were almost out before he realized it, and he choked on him, his throat closing up before he could completely humiliate himself.  Steve looked up at him, his eyes bright, and Tony reached for his wineglass, trying to ignore the way his fingers were shaking.
“Yes,” Tony said, and it sounded so petulant that Steve nearly burst out laughing.  Instead, he found himself moving towards the bed.  Tony looked up at him.  “That is absolutely-”
“For the retention of my security staff, I’d prefer you didn’t.” Tony gave her a little wave.  “Thanks.  For.  This absolutely horrible conversation.”
Steve fended him off with one hand.  “Off.  I can order a cake, Tony.  Even I’m capable of that.”  He glanced over as they headed out of the room.  “You’re coming, aren’t you?” Tony looked at him, his face puzzled, and Steve cleared his throat. “To the party, I mean?”
Tony smiled back, but it didn't reach his eyes.  "Wasn't sure, you look kind of-"  His head tipped to the side.  "Stunned."
A slight tap on the door behind them, and he and Rhodey turned, just in time to see Natasha slip through the door.  “How’s Peter?” she asked, her voice pitched low as she glanced across the room.  May met her eyes, her face strained, and Natasha shook her head.  Tony watched May’s shoulders slump and wanted to punch something, anything.
Tony glared at him, his eyes narrowed into sharp slits.  "If I'm holding you up from a more pressing appointment, you can feel free to just-"
"It's not-"  Tony's head fell forward.  "It's 'The Pirate Movie,' a bad eighties movie that builds off of 'The Pirates of Penzance,' Steve," he said, resigned to everything.  He slumped very low in his seat, staring at the screen from between his fingers.  “It's...  It's not good.”
“Nothing,” Harris said.  His pass hanging from his hand, he handed Tony his credit card.  “We put it on mine.”  Tony frowned at him, and he made a face.  “We had to.”
“I love you, too, but I know your ‘time for a discussion’ face and it’s my least favorite face you make,” Tony pointed out.  “Can we just-”
“Thank you,” Tony said, holding out a hand.  The boy handed over the cup, his fingers shaking hard enough to make the surface of the water vibrate.  Tony gave him a reassuring smile.  “Can you watch the door for us?”
He couldn't breathe.  He kept trying to suck air in, between tight lips and set teeth, and it stuck in his throat, hot and burning.  He closed his eyes, concentrating on trying to make his lungs work.  Breathe.  Breathe.  Breathe.
“I'm not sure what definition of 'hostile' we're going with here,” Bruce said, a vibration running through the words, “but from here, from, uh, from the distance I've got on it, it seems pretty, you know-  It seems hostile, Phil.”
“You're helping,” Steve said, because he'd always been weak to a hopeful smile.  “Other people, not so much.”
It was harder than it should’ve been.  Out of the corner of his eye, he could still see Tony and Sam, their heads bent together, whispering back and forth as the Muppets tormented Michael Cain.  Occasionally, he saw Tony’s head bob in a nod, or heard the soft sound of Sam’s laughter.
Tony made a face.  “Okay, that's true, that's, that's almost fair, but-” He headed back towards the elevator, his feet eating up the distance with a nervous sort of efficiency.  “Look, I don't want to be involved, but I also don't want to be excluded, I mean, that's only common sense, Jarvis!”
“You've a bit of a cowlick,” she said, and Steve reached up, trying to flatten it down.  She laughed.  “Don't you worry, Officer, it's quite charming on you.”  She looked at Jarvis, the two of them sharing a silent communication.  “Let's get you something to eat.”
“No, wait-” Steve said, right before she slipped around him and threw the door open, stepping through it without even slowing down.  “Damn it, Jan!”  Behind him, Sam started humming, and Steve gave him a look.  “Not funny.”
It was ten to twelve feet tall, big enough to scrape against low, sagging portions of the ceiling, and heavy enough to make everything rattle across the floor in its wake.  Huge feet came up, and crashed down, slow and unstoppable.  First one pushed its way into the lobby, then another, and another.  They moved as one, their limbs swinging in a strange sort of symmetry.  When they stopped, it was as one.  When they spoke, robotic voices crackling from unseen speakers, it was as one.
“Patience,” Steve said, ignoring the scoffing sound Sam made.  Pulling the paper free, he set it aside, and opened the box.  Inside was a Prussian blue sweater, and Steve reached out, running careful fingers over the intricate cording of the wool.  He looked up to find Sam smiling at him over the rim of his coffee cup.
“Are you surrendering?” Steve repeated.  “Because there’s no way you can win, not with what he’s left you.”
“Oh.  No, sir,” Jarvis said, shaking his head.  “The table got jostled, but he did not injure himself unduly.”
She glanced back at him.  “Feel free to stop by anytime, Officer.  You sure do improve the scenery.”
Logan sank down into a seat between Clint and Thor.  “Foreign exchange student,” he drawled.  "Bonjour."
“Good.  Me, too.”  Tony lead the way out of the lounge, matching his steps to DJ’s.  Letting him set the pace.  Outside the door, the usher was still waiting, his face tense, his shoulders tight.  As soon as Tony pushed the door open, he sprang to attention.
"How big of a-" Tony started, as Steve gave the pasta sauce a stir.  In an instant, the air was heavy with the smell of tomatoes and garlic, onion and olive oil, and Tony decided he did not care about the mess.  Or anything other than food.  "Know what?" he asked, reaching for the spoon.  "You're right.  Feed me, and I'll let you do whatever you want."
His voice trailed away, and Steve took a step forward, putting a hand on the edge of Hammer’s desk.  “Justin,” he said, his voice quiet, and Hammer looked up.  “You wouldn’t kill him.”
DJ considered that, the toe of one sneaker flicking against the leg of his chair.  “People say that,” he said, sounding almost apologetic.  “A lot.”
“Good, are we all here?” Tony asked, as everyone settled down.  “Roll call, Cap, do we have the whole team?  Or did you adopt someone else when I was at the office yesterday?”
Natasha emerged from the door next to the pantry, a large, golden brown loaf of bread in one hand and a covered basket in the other, her black skirts rustling around her slim legs.  "Miss Potts thought he might have some insights into our young guest's movements," she said.  Her eyes slipped towards Steve, the green of her irises glinting beneath the sweep of her lashes.  "He's been very useful.  So he is to be fed."  There was a faint accent to the words that Steve couldn't quite identify, not French or German, or anything else he'd encountered in Europe.  But familiar, none the less.
Clint sighed.  “She’s right here, Tony.  She’s-”  A beat of silence, then, “There.  I’m holding her hand.  She’s right here.”
"Because he doesn't work for us," Marcy said. "And thus, I have no power over him, Mr. Stark. I can say, 'do not do the thing, you idiot,' and he then says, 'thank you for the advice, ma'am, but this is something I've gotta do.'"
“Did you consider, you know, giving me a word of warning?” Sam asked, the bouquet raised over his head like a club.
“It has, yes, doesn’t mean it’s a good one.” Tony folded his hands on his stomach.  “Your job is terrible.”
He slammed his way out of their apartment, stalking down the hallway towards the elevator.  “I know I'm probably the dumbest person you have to deal with on a daily basis here, Jarvis, but can you please cut me some slack?”  The doors were open and waiting, and he ducked inside.
“We all know who the good child is,” Tony agreed. He flicked his pen against the table, and tossed it aside. “Are we done?”
He knew what was happening.  He just didn't know what he felt about it.  And that seemed more important.
“I put some oil and vinegar on there,” Shawn said.  Drew made a face.  “Okay, fine, I’ll get an unsweetened iced tea from the vending machine.”
“There’s certainly no rush, sir.  We have enough rooms, I’d planned to put this one aside for you in any case,” Jarvis said, unruffled as always.  He set the tin down on the bedside table and picked up a pair of Steve’s pants, holding them up with a faint frown.  “These need a good pressing.”
“He’s had a long night,” Pepper said.  Tony opened his mouth, and she gave him a look.  ‘And so have the rest of us.”  Her voice was pointed, and Tony subsided without a word.  She gave him an approving nod.  “Why don’t we go down to the library, Obie?  Tony needs to rest, and I need to know what we’re going to do about the press.”
Tony felt Steve nod, his chin brushing against Tony’s head.  “You’re sure.”  Stephen nodded, and Tony’s jaw worked.  “How are you sure?”
Slowly, Obie straightened up.  “If they’re really his parents, you can’t deny them,” he said.  There was a note in his voice that Tony couldn’t quite quantify.  He was surprised to discover that he really didn’t care.  “Tony.  You can’t just-”
The guard nodded.  "They are."  She reached into her shirt pocket, pulling out a slim white envelope with the StarkIndustries logo stamped on it.  She held it out to the boy.  "But you can always use one more."
“Don’t care, long list of things I give no fucks about, and way, way, way on the top is ‘if Steve is actually hungry,’” Tony said, waving a hand through the air.  He turned back to his work, and it was waiting for him, frozen in space and time, missing only his touch to come to life again.  “You can force something down.”
He tried to ignore the feeling that he'd crossed a line at some point, and he didn't even know when it had happened.  But he was pretty sure there was no way back.
“Is he naked?” A female voice in the background.  “Is it a naked picture?  Can I see the naked picture?”
Jarvis gave him a bright smile.  "Arms up, please," he said, and before Steve knew what was happening, the jacket was being settled over his shoulders.  Jarvis took a step back, his mouth pursed.  "Hmmmm.  Too tight across the back."
“You were so sick,” Obie said.  “So…”  He shook his head.  “And with your heart condition, I spent so many sleepless nights, sitting beside your bed.  Waiting.”  He leaned back in his chair, his napkin crumbled in one hand like a handkerchief.  “I’ve never felt so helpless in my entire life.  I hope you never have to go through what I went through, trying to keep you alive.”
"Anyone who's anyone, at least, anyone who's anyone that I can still stand to be in the same room with," Tony called back with an easy smile.  "Which exempts about half of New York society and three-quarters of our elected politicians."
Tony nodded.  “Right.”  The tablet clattered to the workbench, and he rubbed both hands over his face.  “Right.”
In the silence that followed, Tony reached for the shampoo bottle.  “Are you okay?” Rhodey asked at last.
Steve's heart was pounding, so loud in his ears that he was surprised that Sam couldn't hear it.  “No, I-”  He turned the book over between his palms.  “Tony asked me about my favorite book, and I told him-”  He shook his head.  “I told him about one I read, as a kid.  I didn't remember the name, though, I just-”
“Does no one say weird stuff to you?” Clint asked Peter, who was now hanging upside down from the ceiling.
Laughing, Thor set Stark back on his feet.  “There, there, no harm done,” he said, taking a step back.  “And you ought to have contacted me.  Important things, you ought to have told me.”
Tony met his eyes as he popped the lid off of the jar.  “I love watching you try, and fail, to lie.” He tossed what Steve considered an excessive amount of salts into the water.  “It’s honestly quite charming.”
Officer Rogers stared at him, his face unreadable.  "Yes," he said at last.  "You should get used to that."
The side of his face hit the floor, and it was a shock, the cold of the stone and the lingering smell of ashes that filled his mouth, filled his throat.  His fingers scraped against the stone, against the front of his shirt, pulling hard at the fabric there, against the skin over his breastbone.
Clint pretended to throw the food coloring at him.  Giggling, DJ ducked down behind the table.  “True!” he crowed.
Tony tried to summon some faux indignation, but it was a losing battle.  “How dare you,” he said, grinning up at Steve.  “A man like you should know your place.”
Pepper braced a hand on his chest.  “I love you,” she whispered back.  “And I will not let you be killed without a fight.”
Nicholas reached for his mug again.  “Don’t you think it’s odd?” he asked, his tone amused.  “That T’Challa insisted on sending that missive to me?  Don’t you think it’s odd that Wilson was the one to come collect you?  A member of the city guard?  Not one of the King’s Elite, or even a whole battalion of the army?  Just a single man.” He swirled the beer in his cup, watching it roll against the metal.  “Don’t you think it’s odd that you got such a…”  He tapped a finger against his cheek.  “Royal guard, all the way home?”
"How old were you?" Steve asked, and Tony fell silent.  Steve's fingers jerked into fists against the plane of his thighs, and he forced them flat.  "When you had to handle that?"
"Jarvis's mad at you," Steve said, pushing away from the bedroom doorway.  He crossed to the bed, setting the cup of coffee down on the bedside table within Tony's reach.  "Now you're in trouble."
“This might surprise you, Mr. Stark, but space?  It's a pretty wide open expanse,” Abby said, adjusting her glasses.  “And occasionally, things get past us.”  She leaned back against Sam's chest, and he looped his arms around her waist.  “We're working on it.”
“Right,” Steve said, but Sam was already gone.  Shaking his head, he slid his phone into his pocket.  Walking into the kitchen, he instinctively looked at the clock.  Hours.  He had hours until the party started.  It was fine.  He was fine.
“Gorgeous, intelligent, and utterly unimpressed by you,” Rhodey said, his eyes closed, his arms still tight around Pepper.
“I mean, I did, but then I got out of the hole and someone thought I should get medical treatment,” Clint said, staring at Natasha with narrowed eyes.  She smirked down at her pistol.  “Didn't you-”
“Yeah, now he's retired to just heading like, six different charity boards and running one of the biggest soup kitchens in the city, pretty much single handedly,” Eli said, turning the tray without being asked so his grandfather could reach them all without effort.  “Don't make eye contact with him, or you'll end up helping out there, too.”
“Jarvis, I thought we discussed this,” he said, as Steve’s weight shifted off of him.  He let out a hiss of displeasure, and Steve dipped back down, brushing a gentle kiss against Tony’s lips before pulling away completely.  Tony stayed just where he was, flopped against the carpet, staring blankly at the ceiling.  “I thought we were in agreement.”
Billy was already shaking his head.  “He had his hat pulled down real low over his face, and a muffler pulled up over his nose.  Pretty sure he didn’t want to be seen.”
“You fail to-” Clint’s head fell back, and he was still laughing to himself.  “No.  There is zero chance we’re eloping, Phil, so, yeah, that was a lie that you should have immediately recognized as a lie.  Like.  Instantly.”
Tony smiled.  “Bold,” he said, and Steve wondered if that was a compliment or not.  Tony reached out, moving a pawn with a quick flick of his fingers.  “Does he have a hard time sleeping?” he asked.
“I stick with the upvoted ones,” Allison said.  She took a bite of the cookie.  “Works out pretty well, most of the time.  Anyway, the majority of the upvoted comments are offers of free food at just about ever taco truck and noodle shop in the city.”
"I've just met you, and I didn't want you in my house, and you clearly don't like me, and I still enjoy your company more than Hank's," Stark said to him with a sharp, manic smile, and Steve's stomach flipped over.  "You, at least, did not attempt to blow up my house."
“I love that she thinks anything is going to help at this point,” Tony said to Rhodey, who cupped a hand over his mouth, trying to hide a smile.  But Tony knew him too well by this point to fall for it.  He flopped out on the couch, not caring about his shoes on the upholstery, and rubbed the bridge of his nose with stiff fingers.  “Pep.  Nothing other than an extended coma is going to help.”
“Men’s clothes?” Steve asked.  He’d run into it before; New York welcomed all sorts.  He’d never been bothered by it, one way or the other.
"So, I'm guessing gay rights protest?" Tony asked, grinning.  A teenager wearing a mask along with his patched, ragged jeans and well-worn t-shirt darted out of the crowd, grabbing Tony's arm.  He said something, his smile brilliant, and then pressed a kiss to Tony's cheek.  Laughing, he dashed away again, the glitter in his hair gleaming as he disappeared into the crowd.  Tony grinned after him.  "Very amiable protest, but yes."  He was laughing when he looked in Steve's direction.  “Maybe a little bit gay.”
Her mouth pursed.  “When you put it that way…”  She stood, and crossed her arms over her chest, her head dipping in a show of respect.  “Your highness.”
“They'll work just as hard as I did, be just as talented as I am, and they'll never make it, because they don't get the break they need.  Because something, or someone, holds them back.”  Steve's fingers tapped lightly on the polished wood of the counter.  “And I walked away from that, from a thing a lot of people want and will never get.  I rejected that.
"Hmm?"  Hank looked in his direction, but his eyes were unfocused, his mind clearly somewhere else.  "Yes.  Of course."
Tony pressed a hand to his face.  “Why do I need to be presentable?” he asked, because he wasn’t quite willing to let go of his petulance just yet.  “He’s the one who left.  Let him try to win his way back into my good graces.”
Tony pointed a finger in his direction.  “Deal.”  He nudged some boxes out of his way with the side of one foot.  “I’ll also need you to release him in time for dinner.”
"Oh, aren't we just full of opinions today?” Stark said.  He clapped, sharp and quick.  “Parker!  Paper!”
Steve stared down at him, knowing this was going to play a very large part in his very dirtiest dreams for a very long time to come.  At least he was wearing underwear.   He huffed out a sigh.  Getting them back on was going to be impossible without Tony's help, so he just grabbed the jeans by the cuffs, pulling them the rest of the way off in one smooth motion.
“I’d be insulted, but you likely have a point,” Strange said.  “And as an apprentice, a very valuable lesson to learn.”
He marched DJ across the lobby over to the hallway.  He stopped there, one arm wrapped around DJ’s shoulders.  “There is no way this is the right place,” he said, as the door at the end of the hallway opened, revealing a bustling ballroom full of tables and people.  A group of people dressed in what he could only describe as multicolored genie outfits came out, laughing and chatting with each other.  In their midst was a single person who seemed to be wearing a pumpkin.
Steve gave a quick, hard shake of his head.  “It’s stupid.  I know.  I know it’s stupid.” He gave Tony a lopsided smile that died almost before he got it into place.  “I mean…  Why do you think I never told you?”
“Not something I compare often, so I’m going to assume you put more thought into this than I have,” Tony said.  “Dinner’s in forty-five minutes, you think you’ll be done by then?”
Jan leaned over her shoulder, stabbing at the remains of the cupcake with her fork.  Ignoring Carol’s attempts at fending her off, she tucked it in her mouth.  “It’s Key Lime.”
He reached for the bottle, drinking straight from it this time.  “He spent his entire life trying to escape from here, though where he thought he was going to go, I never did know.”
“I think we have more important things to talk about,” Steve said, his voice stern.  Natasha arched an eyebrow at him, but she didn't say anything further.  Steve took a deep breath.  “So that's the situation,” he said.  “I'm not asking anyone in this room to lie for us.”
“Well, then, sir, it appears I’m in very good company.”  Jarvis pulled a snowy white handkerchief from his pocket, offering it to Tony.  “There is now a child in this house who needs reassurance."
He didn't see his bow, it was either still back on the street or buried under the debris, but his quiver was still on his hip.  And judging by the way Nat was still cursing him out in Russian over the comms, she would be willing to dig him out with her bare hands just so she could have the pleasure of killing him.
Alcohol was a seriously bad idea.  He knew that.  Surviving Steve was bad enough now without adding liquor to the mix.  But Tony nodded.  “Give me in fifteen minutes.”
“That's my boy.”  Obie reached out, clapping a hand on Tony's shoulder.  “Remember, this is important.  We need to shake this 'Iron Man' thing.  With the problems we've been having-”
He tossed some butter in the hot skillet, swirling it back and forth as it melted with a hiss.  “We’d been working together for a while.  She found the jobs.  Did the planning.  I was the muscle, not the brains, but I trusted her, so…”  One shoulder rose and fell in a half shrug, and he reached for the cutting board, scraping the chopped onions and garlic into the hot butter.  “When she found a client who wanted a trinket from the Stark Mansion, and was willing to pay handsomely for it?  I was on board.”
Tony collapsed next to him with a groan, burying his face in Steve's stomach.  “Simple human compassion,” he groused, one hand sliding under Steve's shirt, his fingers rough against Steve's skin.
Steve gave him a look, but it was hard to keep a straight face.  “I think what he's trying to ask, Director, is why we didn't know about this until we ran face first into it in the streets of New York.”
“Yeah, well, we know that NOW,” Tony said, pinching the bridge of his nose.  His head was throbbing, despite a cup of coffee that threatened to melt both the cup and his molars, or maybe because of it.  He risked another sip.  He'd prefer to die caffeinated.  “Surprise.”
Sam nodded.  “Work harder.”  He smiled.  “But apology accepted anyway.”  He pushed himself to his feet.  “Now that I am here to relieve you, AFTER having handling all the paperwork, I'd like to point out, you want some help moving him?”
Steve braced himself as Natasha started up the car.  “So if you’re the fixer, and she’s the spy, does that make Hogan the muscle?” he asked.
“Yes, let's just try to look less murderous, okay?”  Tony smiled at him.  “It was supposed to be a surprise, but-”  He leaned in.  “I booked a private table for us.  For dinner.  A very nice restaurant, uptown.  Very quiet, very discreet.”  He leaned over to grab another box.  “What do you say?  Dinner, champagne, me being my usual charming self?”
“It’s fine,” Steve said, checking each of the stones on the hearth.  More than a few were looser than he’d like, and he settled back on his heels with a sigh.  “We can fix it.”
There was a moment of stillness, and then something shifted in the darkness of the room, a shadow that turned towards Peter with a rustle of fabric.  Backlit by the windows, it towered over Peter, a hulking form that should not have been there.
Tony’s eyes were brilliant and beautiful and somehow sad.  “But you do,” he said, the words almost inaudible.
And maybe he was.  Tony looked like something from a different world, almost a different species, his dark, gleaming eyes shadowed beneath the sweep of his lashes.  Something beautiful and terrible and foreign, and Steve ached for him in a way that he didn’t even know he could.
The instant he did, Logan stepped directly into his line of sight, a plate piled high with fried shrimp in one hand and a tumbler of brandy in the other.  He stopped, looking at Steve with narrowed eyes and a scowl.
“The hole punch was probably not the best choice,” Steve agreed.  He leaned his forehead against Tony’s.  “He has almost unlimited resources, Tony, and he used it to help people.”
“Yes.”  The word was out before Tony actually finished asking the question.  Steve took a deep breath.  “Do you?”
Clint rolled to his feet and took the phone out of Tony’s hand in one fluid, easy movement.  “Hi, Pepper,” he said, dancing just out of Tony’s reach.  “Phil’s in Las Vegas on an assignment.  I’m trying to surprise him.”
Tony wasn't sure he'd know.  But he also wasn't sure cared anymore.  “You want to help me?” he asked, and she nodded.  “Good.  Roll down the window so I can toss these.”
“Yeah, but you’re becoming a weird shut in at this point.  Let’s get you out from time to time.” Tony turned back to his holographic designs.  “Lunch tomorrow?”
“They’re not-” Bucky stopped,shoving a hand through his hair.  It immediately fell right back into his face.  He didn’t seem to notice.  “Stevie.  Look at this place.”
“Right, yeah, I meant, how it looks as a-” Rhodey rubbed the back of his neck.  “How it looks as a gesture, Steve.  I think Tony sees is as a very ‘first serious college relationship’ kind of a thing.  You fall head over heels in love and next thing you know, you’ve got someone’s name on your ass, and that’s-  That’s something the other person may not like, or may like a little too much, you know?
“Because it ties the outfit together,” Sitwell said.  “Take him to medical, have them look him over, you’re not going to be able to leave, we’ll be on lockdown until-”
Steve wished he was wearing a pair of sweatpants that didn’t have a rather unfortunate hole right on the ass.  Trying to be subtle, the pulled his shirt down.  “Uh, morning?” His eyes darted from Jan to Tony and back.  “What’s up?”
“I have a bail fund, don't know what the rest of you are going to do,” Tony said.  “When are you coming home, Steve?”
"I was gone for fifteen minutes." Steve glanced back at the apartment door.  “I left for fifteen minutes to get my laundry, and-”
Steve bit his lip to keep from laughing as both of them stumbled towards consciousness.  “You two okay?”
“No, he's right, he abdicated the couch, I win,” Bucky mumbled into the cushions.  He was now flopped out, face down, along the full length of the couch, one leg trailing to the floor, the other propped on the far armrest.  “Want my socks back.”
But Tony was likely already asleep, and even if he wasn’t, there was no chance that Steve was going to go looking for him.  He reached for his doorknob, sparing one last glance over his shoulder.  He wasn’t surprised to find that he was still alone.
Nothing was wrong.  Nothing was goddamn wrong, what was wrong with him?  Why couldn’t he just say that, say ‘nothing’ and actually mean it.  Just once, just this once, he needed to mean it.
"I did not spend half an hour doing my hair so that I could let Mother Nature make a hash of it," she said, her voice tart.  She held up the tablet in her hand.  "Tony, darling, I need to borrow some tableware."
Coulson gave him a polite smile.  “I wasn't briefed on her before the incident,” he said, one hundred percent bureaucrat and proud of it.  “If I had been, I could've-
“Well, if you get turned out, I can call in a favor or two, see if I can’t get you a job sweeping the streets or moving cargo down on the docks,” Steve mused.  “You think-”
“I don’t believe either of them considered that he hadn’t seen it in use previously,” Jarvis said.  “After all, he has been assisting you and Mr. Rhodes with far more complex pieces of machinery, and watched Mr. Hogan work on the autos in the garage.  But something about the sound appears to have disagreed with him, and he…”  Jarvis frowned.  “Reacted badly.”
DJ nodded, his skin warm against Tony's hand.  Tony smiled, and it didn't hurt the way the way he'd expected it to.  “I want you to remember that.  It might not make the nightmares stop, we both know that nightmares are, they're weird things, Deej.  But if you remember, maybe next time you have one, you'll know.
Bucky tried to paste an innocent look on his face, and it was such a failure that Shuri was reduced to giggling into her cupped hands.  “Cry,” Shuri whispered, as if Steve wasn’t right there, as if he couldn’t hear every bit of this.  Steve gave her a look, and she leaned forward, her expression gleeful. “I think its working.”
Steve shifted next to him, and Tony flopped onto his stomach, trying to block out the light.  He heard Steve chuckle, and considered flipping him off.  But raising his arm just seemed like too much work, so he wrapped his arms around his pillow, snuggling down into the depths of his pillow
“Which sounds like good advice, but it's harder to do for some people,” Jan said.  She smiled at Steve.  “I prefer to punch 'em.”  She smacked one little fist into her other hand.  “Or get Jessica to punch 'em for you.”
Tony groaned, his whole body aching.  “It absolutely is not,” he said, and was that really his voice?  He coughed, rubbing a hand over his face.  “When did the party end?  Or start?”
He could swear that he heard Jarvis sigh.  “Chance of precipitation in the next hour is 70%.  Might I suggest a jacket, sir?”
“Yes, as we all know, you are the only one allowed to run naked through the halls before five,” May said, her voice tart, and Tony grinned at her.
“Yes, thank you,” Tony said, climbing in. “If we accidentally ended up on Long Island, I would not be upset, Happy.”
He froze, his heart in his throat.  At the sink, Tony straightened up, water dripping down his face and neck, running down his bare chest.  He blinked, his lips parted, his eyelashes dark against his skin.  “Seen- What?” he asked.  He reached up, pushing a hand through his hair and he was all lean, corded muscle and tawny skin, the too-big shorts sliding low on his hips.
“Just a hypothetical question here,” she said, rocking her chair back on its rear legs.  “Say there was a tray of like, egg rolls in there.  What would you do?”
"No.  Just...  Always achy."  He made a face as he shifted his weight forward and back, trying to find a comfortable place in his own body.  It seemed to ellude him more and more these days.  He sighed.  Being a bot was so much easier.  "Always."
“Yes,” Jan breathed.  “Oh, how marvelous, I’ve always wanted to cause a scene, can we still get a table at the Ritz, Tony?  You’ll have to invite Obie, of course, he’ll suspect something if I bring it up, I should ring over immediately to-”  She clapped her hands in front of her mouth.  “I need a ring.”
Tony stared at him.  “How many options were there?”  He put together the second bowl of ramen with practiced ease.  “What the hell, Parker, were there options we don’t know about?”
“Whose side are you on here?” Steve asked.  He leaned in, his fingers cradling Tony's jaw, tipping his face up.  “I mean, I come home, you're sleeping with my best friend, now you're taking his side?”
Steve scrambled backwards, making a futile grab for the shield, his heartbeat accelerating as adrenaline spiking through his veins.  Bobbi, for her part, didn’t move, her shoulder braced against the still as the stone in the middle of the floor simply dropped down and moved back and out of the way.
“All will be well.”  Thor walked in, Darcy draped over his back.  She was snoring, ever so quietly, her arms dangling over Thor’s shoulders to lay against his chest.  She was dressed in what looked like a fuzzy bunny onesie. Thor grinned at them.  “I have sausage and cheese, and fine bread, straight from my father’s stores.”
Everything clicked.  "He's-  He's physically regressed," Clint said, his stomach sinking.  "You're telling me he's gone back to being, uh, a little kid?"
Steve came around the back of the couch, leaning in so he could see DJ on the tablet screen.  “Do you want to come visit?” he asked, reaching over Tony's shoulder to scratch the cat behind the ear.  It arched up, purring against Steve's palm.
Steve's eyes rolled up towards the dark night sky.  "Really," he said, his voice flat.  "The worst color you've ever seen."
The kiss stretched on until he felt his head spinning from lack of air, and when they broke apart, he didn't go far, his head just falling against Steve's chest, laughing against Steve's shirt, against his throat. Steve's hands were on his waist, on his hip, and he was laughing into Tony's hair.
Steve took a deep breath.  “You’re sure.”  His voice seemed to come from a long way off.  Tony nodded, and Steve looked away.  “Why are you telling me?”
Steve picked up Sam's shoes, tossing them in Sam's general direction.  “I think you've got the better idea.  Run?”
DJ nodded, and without another word, he started up the aisle.  This time, determined not to lose him, Harris fell into step behind him.  He didn’t have to look back to know that Tony and Clint were talking in low tones, their heads bent together.  For some reason, Harris didn’t want to hear what they were saying.  He didn’t want to be adult about this.
Tony groaned, trying to push his head further under his pillow.  “No.”  Behind him, he heard Steve start to laugh, and he aimed an elbow in that general direction.
Steve's fingers fluttered against his arm, his shoulder, his fingertips reverent against Tony's cheek. Tony tipped his head to the side, kissing Steve's fingers, affection bubbling through him. “Otherwise, I'm going to make every single one of your fantasies come true.”
He crossed to the door and opened it.  “So anyone who's not comfortable with asking the injured man to loan you five bucks?  Out.”
Jessica paused in the midst of pulling her hair back in a ponytail.  She considered Steve.  “Fuck no.”
Pepper blinked at him.  “I wouldn't-  I don't know.  Mrs. Parker would know, or maybe Natasha, she probably made it up.  I'll go get her.”
“Why-” Jan pinched the bridge of her nose.  “People.  We’re at a twelve.  I need you all at like, a six.  Max a six.  I’d prefer a four.”
“We are not eating breakfast until the child opens something,” Tony said, his voice dire.  “I wrapped things!  There are-  I bought things without looking at a pre-prepared list, and I wrapped them.  Myself!”
“But...  You don't need it,” Tony pointed out.  He waved a hand behind him.  “There's-  There's a bathroom.  You have your own bathroom.  It's very nice, it's not as nice as mine, but still, there's a shower and everything.”
He stepped into the bathroom and flicked the light on, nudging the door shut with the side of his foot.   It bounced against the jam, but didn’t latch.  Steve left it like that,
She looked at Steve.  “Who would question it, when his parents are me and Reed?  When his mother can turn invisible and his father can stretch like a rubber band?  What's normal in this family, what's-”
“I’m counting on you,” Steve said to Greer with a slight smile,  There was whipped cream on his wrist.  He fumbled for a napkin.
Obie nodded.  “Yes, of course.”  He smiled.  “DJ.  What happens if he thinks that he’ll be in the line of inheritance?  Or, worse, what if his real parents show up?”
The voice was unfamiliar, and there was a beat of silence, a mix of wariness and shock.  “Hi,” Tony said, still right behind the robot.  “This is a secure channel, so if you could politely fuck off, that'd be-”
But the frost was fast approaching, and with it, the winter winds and storms, and the solarium needed to be shuttered until spring.  Steve had been drafted to help Rhodey, Clint and Happy manipulate the massive, heavy doors into place.  He didn’t mind; at this point, physical labor was a welcome distraction.
The sound of camera shutters followed him through the door, going silent only after it closed behind him.  Steve was waiting for him beyond security, his hands braced on his hips.  “You shouldn't encourage them,” he said, giving Tony a dark look from beneath his lowered brows.
“Steve’s had more exposure, but still.   I’m pretty much fucked no matter what,” Tony said.  He held up the jar.  “But I’ve got all the pickled eggs that I can eat, so, that’s a plus.”
“There were threats of violence,” Greer said, her teeth flashing in a feral smile.  “Which will work on everyone other than Natasha, and she doesn’t bother with the shovel talk, she just waits behind you with the shovel.”
Tony’s shoulder flexed under Steve’s lips, and he shifted, making a grumbling noise under his breath.  “Oh, God, you’re a cuddler,” he said, and Steve grinned.
“Not our Tony,” Harris reiterated.  His mouth went tight.  “Oh, God, we have a Tony.  There’s one.  I mean.” He rubbed his forehead.  “There’s more than one, I have personally spoken to two of them, there’s at least two, oh dear God-”
Steve nodded.  “I suppose not.  Then, no.  It doesn't. “ He paused. “When I was a kid, a girl in my building, her parents disowned her.  They just stopped acknowledging her as their daughter, 'cause she married a boy whose parents were the wrong sort of Irish-”
“Yeah, we got a bit of trouble of our own.” Hogan nodded towards the door of Steve's building.  “Best we discuss it off the street.  If you don't mind?”
It was quick, almost chaste, his lips ghosting over Steve's, both of them unnaturally still, as if they knew it wasn't going to last.  It shouldn't last, after all.  It wasn't real.
“Yes, and that’s why I’m paying for your college education, so that you’re beholden to me and you have no choice but to handle things like board meetings, press conferences and Pepper.”
Danvers ran her finger across the tabletop, her nose wrinkling as she flicked the dust away from her hand.  “The Captain’s put in an order for another bed, but you might have to take the floor until-”
Which, he supposed, was no different as to why he’d used it today.  The only difference really was, every other time he’d stepped through a portal, Strange had known he’d been there.
Trip was doing her best to keep her back to him, circling the altar to try to find a path of escape not covered by an agent.  She wasn’t having much luck.  “Sounds like something a dude with memory erasing tech would say to make me let my guard down,” Trip said, and Tony grinned.
"I think he's a charming dinner companion," Pepper said, as Rhodey slid her chair in before taking his own seat.  "He's likely quieter than most of the ones who show up at this table."
He looked back up, catching a fleeting glimpse of an expression that he couldn't quite read on Steve's face.  But it was gone before he had a chance to puzzle over it, Steve's usual smile creasing his cheeks.  “Sure.  Any requests?”
Tony's smile was luminous.  "Liar," he whispered, and it carried no sting.  "But I love that about you."  He leaned back in his chair.  "And you deserve one nice meal, one nice date."  He reached for the water glass.  "So you're going to get one." He held it up, a toast.  "Merry Christmas."
Tony grabbed a screwdriver and waved it in Steve’s direction.  “Bruce can deal with the lunatic over in the Baxter Building.  I’m-”  His mouth worked.  “Not capable of it right now.”  He looked up.  “And once he’s back, and grounded for life, you and I are going to have a very long talk about letting him go to Strange’s Deathtrap.”
“Perhaps you should consider a date, rather than a public relations event,” Pepper said, her voice tart.  “With someone who enjoys your company and won’t attract-”  She waved a hand through the air.  “Bullets.”
Tony's fingers fumbled down at his hips, grateful to find that he was still wearing his shorts.  “Not naked,” he breathed.  “Okay. Minor victory.  Right.”
Jan stalked out onto the balcony.  "I am going to throw this party," she said, placing a finger directly in the center of Tony's chest, right over the arc reactor.  "And you-" She gave him the tiniest little shove.  "Are going to show up." Another poke.  "In your nicest tux." Poke.  "And with your best party attitude."  Poke.  "And dance-" Poke. "Schmooze." Poke.  "And be the life of the damn party, Stark." Poke, poke, poke.
Every night, he dragged the linens and the pillows down to the floor, and slept there, huddled at the end of the bed.  And every morning, he dragged the whole mess back onto the bed.  It wasn’t the best solution, but it was the only one he’d found that worked for him.
He met DJ’s eyes with a smile.  “You don’t have to.  I know this place is…  Big.  And lonely.  The only kid here is Peter, and he’s not much of a kid, he never was.”  He held up a hand, finger and thumb almost touching.  “Tiny adult from the day I met him, so, maybe having you around has helped.  But other than him…”
“Refreshingly honest, actually,” Rhodey said, his arms crossed over his chest.   He could hear Steve talking, but the words were too low for him to make out, and he was honestly glad of that.  Every so often, DJ would shift in place, or scrub the back of his wrist across his nose.
He crossed his arms over his chest.  “He knows about fifty ways out of Hammer’s place, and he doesn’t repeat them often.  He just…” His throat worked as he tried to swallow.  “Anyway.  Yes.  Figured when  you were done with your press releases, and he went back, well, no one would blame him for running away again.
He looked up at Jarvis.  “What am I doing here?” he asked.  A stupid question that had no answer, and he regretted it almost before it was out.  “Sorry.  That’s…  Sorry.”
Steve looked up from his sketchpad.  Pepper was standing just inside the door of the workshop, a letter held in one hand, an exhausted expression on her face.  “This is your fault,” she said.
He managed to pull on his pants and shoes, grabbing his holster from the hook next to the bed.  He didn't bother with his suspenders, leaving them hanging down at his sides, or his shirt.  Anyone who showed up at his door at this hour deserved to see him in his undershirt.  He shrugged his holster into place, and headed for the door.
There was something in the back of his head, something that Tony couldn’t quite remember, something that bothered him, like an itch under the armor at a place he couldn’t quite reach.  He scrubbed a hand over his eyes, trying to concentrate.  “Who would-”
"Mine was a motorcycle mechanic who sold drugs on the side, but yeah."  Carol gave her a wry smile.  "Probably the same guy."
"We'll find one who hates you and loves him and it'll average out to a nice indifference," Marcy told him, her lips twitching, and Tony burst out laughing.  Steve just gritted his teeth against the urge to say something rude.
“I’d like to point out-” Jan started, and Carol slapped the team’s takeout menu file down on the table.
Strange clamped a hand over his mouth, words muffled behind his fingers, words that Steve were pretty sure he wouldn’t have understood even without that barrier.  Finally, Strange let his hand fall.  He took a deep breath.  “You will do exactly as you are told,” he said.  “As long as you are here, a stranger in a strange land, as long as I am responsible for your well-being, then you will do what you are told.”
Sam stopped, confusion slipping across his face.  As soon as it came, it was gone, and he gave Tony a look that Tony couldn't quite read.  “Debriefing," he said.  "Because that's the protocol."  He spread his hands.  "Unless you found someone else dumb enough to be third string quarterback for this crew."
“I have already dealt with this particular call,” Jarvis said.  “As it turns out, it requires your direct intervention.”
As the last song came to an end, the dancers taking a well deserved bow, the boys burst into applause, stomping their feet and cheering.  Someone blew a sharp, enthusiastic whistle, and DJ flinched, his hands coming up to cover his ears.  Tony, clapping politely along, gave him a curious look.
Miss Potts studied him, one fingertip tapping at her cheek.  “I take it you're a proponent of finding a stool,” she said, and there was no mockery to the words, no disdain.  Just something like warm curiosity.
DJ settled onto the chair, his heels braced on the edge of the seat, his knees up against his chest.  "Good enough," Steve said, handing him a cup of tea.  "Thank you."
He looked up, and Rogers was smiling at him, just a little, his mouth kicked up at the corners.  Tony glared at him.  "Are you...  Smirking at me?" he asked, suspicious.  He pointed a wrench at the blasted man, his eyes narrowed.  "That looks like a smirk."
Peter's silverware rattled against the counter.  “It was HALF a pie!” he said, and he sounded so betrayed that Steve couldn't quite hold back a smile.
“Yes, sir.” He resisted the urge to fill in the rest of his ‘to-do’ list.  Obie didn’t like to cede control of the conversation.  “It’ll hold through the lambing season.”
His eyes snapped open.  Steve.  He didn’t know if he said it, or just thought it, but Steve heard him anyway.  The others were there, people, so many people all at once, and all of them talking, but all DJ cared about was Steve.
“Fuck 'em,” Tony said cheerfully, and across the table, Steve choked on a laugh.  Tony glanced at him, and Steve had his hand over his mouth, hiding his smile.  But his eyes were dancing.  Tony grinned at him.
“He’s Dummy,” Steve said, as Clint gave him a nametag that said ‘Military Invasion.’  Steve barely seemed to notice.  “Tony’s helper bot.”
Jan did a spin, her crimson red coat flaring out around her legs, the white puff on her hat bouncing with the movement.  She came to a stop facing the table, and slammed a phone book-sized stack of papers down in front of her.  She leaned forward, smiling in a manner that Steve honestly found to be kind of worrying.
Tony leaned in.  “Go get Sam.  Sam likes exposure,” he said, in a stage whisper.  “And Steve is incapable of saying no to Sam.”
“That better not affect how you draw my six-pack,” Sam said.  He hooked a foot into the strap of Steve's bag.  “Wanna go hit something?”
DJ nodded, and looked at the Stranges.  As one, the reached for the double doors at the back of the chapel.  They pushed the doors open, and there was something on the other side, something and nothing all at once, a swirling mass of color and light and matter, and Tony’s stomach turned over.
“I think we lost her back at the corset booth, and I’m as terrified by that sentence as anyone else on Earth,” Harris said.  He picked up a t-shirt.  He was pretty sure it was bootleg, and he was all right with that.  “Does this count as a ‘souvenir’ situation?  Are we bringing stuff back?”
Steve stared at him, blindsided by the question.  His heart was pounding in his chest, his pulse spiking in an instant.  But there was no threat in the boy's eyes, no rage, no accusation.  Just...  Something like desperation.
Darcy was bouncing in place on one of the plush seats.  “I’m going to play a slot machine and ride the roller coaster and go to a buffet and eat nothing but dessert and take my picture in front of the stupid fountains and-”
Tony fished his pocket watch out of his vest pocket, frowning down at it.  “Never,” he said. “And I think I have a meeting-”
She was a small woman, with a round face and straight black hair.  When the wind kicked up, he caught a glimpse of bright, almost florescent pink, hidden under the more work appropriate jet strands.  Dark eyes met his without flinching, sharp and direct, her high, round cheeks pink.
“Want Rhodey to stay with you?” Tony asked.  “You can teach him to fix the armor so he can do it himself instead of depending on child labor to handle it.”
The bat impacted in the side of Obie’s head with a sickening thud, and he impact spun him around, tumbling him to the ground.
Steve swung his shield up onto his shoulder, letting its slight weight settle against his back.  He exhaled, and felt it shift, and everything was better because it was there.  “I’m not going to jump the wall.”  Bobbi gave him a  look, her eyebrows arching, and he felt his lips twitch.  “Again, I mean.”
“Nowhere fast, I suspect,” Tony shot back.  He turned on his heel and stomped back down the hallway to the registration desk.  The girl in the appalling hat looked up from her phone with a bright smile.  Tony tried to smile back. “Hi-”
“She could, but it would be rather uncouth of you to ask it of her,” Jarvis said.  He paused.  “Especially since there we had little choice about cleaning up the vestibule.”
In the silence that followed, Steve set his coffee cup down, and Tony stepped away from him, just a step away.  "Why?" he asked.  DJ looked up, and Steve smiled at him.  "You aren't violent.  You've never-"
“No,” Phil said, and it came out just a little too fast and a little too sharp, and he snapped his mouth shut, going back to his forms.
“Hank, no insult here, but the only two women I'd even consider marrying are sitting at this table, and Pepper already has too much to handle when it comes to me and my business.”  Tony leaned his chin on one hand, ignoring the way that Obie scowled at him.  “Mind if I borrow yours?”
Steve's hand snapped out, his fingers slipping under Tony's chin, tipping it up.  He saw Tony's eyes go wide, saw his lips part, and then Steve was kissing him.
“Of course, sir,” Natasha said, setting a plate of pancakes in front of DJ.  “Let me get you the jam pot.”
“He’s hugging a broom, Tony,” Pepper said, her voice gentle.  “He’s…  Clinging to a broom like that will keep him afloat as the ship sinks around him.”
Tony considered DJ.  "Depends," he said, his eyes narrowed against the full glare of the late morning light.  "Are you just here to steal my pastries?"
“Tony-” Steve started, but Tony had already slipped past Sam and out the door.  Cursing under his breath, Steve grabbed his cup and made to follow him, but Sam didn’t move out of his way.  “I’m fine.”
Trip grinned at him.  “But honestly, it recognizes and honors the purity and perfection of your friendship, mostly with a lot of junk Latin phrases and really fancy fonts.” She reached for a desk drawer.  “Honestly, most people go for the photos more than the certificates, but feel free to review the goods.”
Before the sentence was even done, Steve was reaching for it.  But for some reason, he stopped short of taking it, his hand hanging in the air a few inches from the other man’s.  His hands were dirty, his fingers rubbed raw, the tips almost black with oil or soot.  The silver case of the watch gleamed against his skin, but it seemed to fit there, in a way Steve couldn’t really define.
Tony waited until it settled into a steady, cool glow, tracing the cracks of the floor, revealing arcane symbols set into the pattern of the stones.  The light pulsed, like a heartbeat, like the tides, and he always hated that.  He resisted the urge to kick his foot across the stone, like a child in a puddle, just to see if the light would splash the same way.
“Yeah, well, why are you on my couch, I have a guest bedroom, I’m, like, 90% sure I have a guest bedroom here,” Tony said.  “Got a bed and everything.”
“I can, yes, there’s a-  A box for delivering packages on the back of my bicycle,” Mickey said.  His thin arms went around it in a hug.  “Thank you, Mr. Barton.  I really-”  His throat worked.  “Thank you.”
“Being gay, yes, you make it okay. For people who are walking a knife edge right now.” She leaned in. “You use 'my husband' in public, on camera, and it's not going to change the world, but it alters the perception of who we are, what we can be. Does it really change things that much? Probably not.”
Sue crossed her arms over her chest.  "As well as can be expected," she said.  Her head canted towards Steve, her face drawn and pale.  "You know.  When the government apparently decides it's a good idea to unleash giant mechanical horrors to patrol the streets looking for people like them."
Tony straightened up, a jolt of pure pleasure going through him.  “Yeah?” he asked, a grin splitting his face.
“Ask the man to dance, dumbass,” Jessica said from behind the punching bag.  She wound up and landed a blow that threatened to send it crashing off its chain.  She grinned, wide and bright.  “Unless you don't need practice with that.”
“Thank you,” Steve popped the back door, switching places with Peter.  “Shouldn't be much, you're in the middle of a seating, but-”
He headed for the door.  “Eat your empanadas and try not to get anything on your tie.  We got thirty minutes before we’re gotta be getting in a cab.”  He waved a hand in the air.  “I’m getting a coffee, and I expect you’ll have figured out how to put on your pants by the time I get back.”
“Right,” Tony said, and he sounded resigned.  Steve bit his lip to keep from laughing.  “Wait.” His eyes slid in Steve’s direction.  “I got into the bath tub in my tux.”
He glanced at DJ.  “But it's not just me.  I'm not the only one who-” He reached out, his fingers ghosting over DJ's hair.  “It's not just you and me anymore.  There's all these other people in our life now, and I'm not sure how that happened, when that happened, but you've got more than me.” and thank God for that.”
Clint was wrapping up a joint of ham, the butcher paper tied neatly into place.  It went into the bag, along with a packet that Steve was pretty sure contained a couple of pounds of dried sausage, and a jar of gleaming red jam.
“I have not,” Strange said.  He didn’t sound convinced.  “So when did I order pizza?  Tomorrow, or yesterday?”
“I'll work on that,” Steve said, stroking his hair.  He could feel Tony's breath against the hollow of his navel, hot through the fabric of his shirt.  “What do you need?”
“Well, that depends on who you ask,” Clint pointed out.  Steve stared at him, and Clint grinned.  “Did you ask Mr. Stark?  Because he seems to think-”
DJ, half hidden behind a massive pile of brightly colored  boxes, groaned.  “No,” he said, his narrowed eyes just barely visible over a huge bow.
Tony winced and pushed himself upright.  “Rhodey, Pepper or Coulson?” he asked, shoving a hand through his hair.
In the bright light of day, it looked almost real, the state seal of Symkaria affixed in the bottom right next to their signatures.  His looked rushed, small, almost embarrassed.  Tony had signed with his usual aplomb, the stroke sweeping across the full length of the line.  Steve's thumb swept over Tony's name, his signature, a faint, unmistakable warmth curling in the pit of his stomach.
“Maybe we both need practice,” Tony said.  “All the legalities.  All the paperwork.  All the possibilities for things going wrong, every Doombot and paparazzi-”
“We’ll end up fighting it in a week if you do,” Carol said.  Jan gaped at her, and Natasha made a silent ‘one’ hashmark in the air.
Clint gave him a wide, bright grin.  “Sexy Iron Hero!” He said, his hand moving slowly to another rack of costumes.  “Short skirt.  Big bow on the butt.  Heart shaped hole where the arc reactor should be.”  He traced a very large heart over the center of his chest.  “Boot covers included.”
DJ gave it a poke with his spoon.  Furbro was sleeping against the side of the warm china, his little paws flicking in the air.  “Potato,” DJ said, his voice leaden, and went back to his parfait.
“You’re not sorry,” Tony said, and then, into the phone, “Pepper, I’m going to have to call you back.”  There was an indignant yelp from the other end of the call, but Tony had already stabbed his finger on the ‘disconnect’ button.
There was a beat of silence.  “I’m somehow very thankful I survived that,” Harris said to no one in particular.  Darcy held up her glass, and he clinked his against hers.  He looked at DJ.  “You okay?”
“Because I attract free thinking, hard drinking, culinary rebels who are ready to throwdown at any time,” Tony said.  “With a wide variety of knives used for a wide variety of purposes.”
"I wouldn't know, sir.  I certainly don't speak French."  With that, Jarvis continued up the stairs.
Greer blew a curl away from her eyes, glaring at Jess. “You-” Her nose wrinkled.  “You’re humoring me.”
“This isn't the Savoy, Mr. Stark, and I'm a bit bigger than your usual partners,” Rogers said.  But his fingers, warm and strong, wrapped around Tony's, pulling him in.
“Sure,” Sam said, as the elevator opened into the lobby.  He gave the security guard a wave as they passed.  “How’s the weather this morning?”
“But you’re still open to the possibility, wonderful.”  Jan bounced back to her feet.  “My mother said that the first marriage never sticks, in any case, I’d consider it a warm up for my marriage to Hank, we can figure out who’s worth inviting, just based on the wedding gifts and what flower arrangements just don’t work down in St. Marks, isn’t that totally worth the effort?”
“Man deserves a nap,”  Tony said, even as his HUD lit up like a fireworks display. “We have movement at the warehouse, looks like they're trying to collect what's left of their tech.  Captain Marvel?”
Nat didn’t even glance over her shoulder at Clint as he approached.  “It’s what I do,” she said, moving to the side to give him space beside her at the banister.  Tucked behind a massive column, her spot afforded her a view of the expansive grand hall, but protected her from view from below.
“And that's just as good.  Just put on the glasses tonight,” Jan said with a smile.  “And see what happens.”
Wordlessly, Jan held the file out to Tony.  He considered it, sensing a trap that he wasn’t sure he could avoid.  “Whoever he is, he’s got quite the file,” he said.  He took it from Jan.  “Shame we won’t get to read it.”
“He’s admitted setting the fire,” Clint said.  “Claims he doesn’t know about any of the rest of it, just that he was given a lot of money to make sure the boat house burned.”
“Did you not get the press release?” Tony glanced back at Marcy, now standing just a few steps behind him.  “Did you not send the press release?”
“We don't have time for this,” Tony pointed out.  He glanced at his watch.  They  100 percent did not have time for these games.  “Seriously.  Pep.  Can I just-”
DJ took a deep breath.  “Would you believe, something important is happening here?” he asked Tony.  He looked at Harris.  “Would you?”
“Right,” Tony said, because this was rapidly becoming his favorite game. “Victor said we could use his office, so-”
Steve closed his eyes, trying to keep himself calm.  “Right,” he said.  He squared his shoulders, bringing his chin up.  “I can do this.”
“I’m not leaving,” Bruce said.  He grabbed a napkin.  “Can we just…” He tapped his pen against the napkin, a nervous little flicker of movement.  “Accept that?  Gracefully?  Or as gracefully as you can manage?”
Tony’s head tipped to the side as he thought that over.  “It’s a very nice suit,” he said with a grin.  And it was.  It was a classic cut, nothing too modern or flashy, but a with nice, clean lines and an elegant weight.  Paired with a crisp silk shirt and a red and gold tie that just brushed up against the edge of garish, it suited Harris in a way that Tony was pretty sure Harris wouldn’t like.
Steve burst out laughing, his head falling to Tony’s shoulder.  Tony grinned at nothing in particular, stroking Steve’s hair with one hand.  “Less laughing, more groping,” he said, his voice light.
Pepper buried her face in her own bouquet, her face flushed as she inhaled. “Well, Jarvis helped,” she said.  “He said Steve asked if you were still in the building.  We took that as a sign that maybe you should be.”
Tony winced.  He took a deep breath, and everything hurt.  He preferred it that way.  He could focus on the ache of his ribs, instead of the chaos in his head.   “Right,” he said.  And, since it seemed inadequate somehow, he repeated it.  “Right.”  He sat up, and this time, they helped him, Pepper piling pillows behind him.  He slumped back, exhausted.  “The car?”
