Steve inhaled deeply, licking his lips and swallowing hard. "Put what?"
Tony grumbled again, but continued the activity. He may be a genius, but he's not a writer. He didn't generate words on a regular basis. He did other, more important things, greater things. He didn't spend his time coming up with words about Captain Spangly Pants on a piece of paper with a pencil. But he did it because arguing with Pepper is a whole lot more fun when she catches him and he's actually doing something she had no idea he was even doing.
Steve should have known better than to suggest this, but the words were out before his brain could stop his mouth. "Maybe you could design me one."
Steve's eyes widened. What was Tony saying? Isn't "yummy" another word for "cute" or "attractive" or... "There aren't a whole lot of adjectives that start with the letter
Tony rolled his eyes. "Jarvis. STEVE. NOW!"
"Yeah, but I-" Tony blinked. "Tony?"
Tony felt Steve’s ass tighten around his cock even more as he pushed harder and harder into him. His balls that were slapping against Steve’s ass began to tighten and he knew he was done. He felt himself release deep into Steve’s ass and held on tight to him. His eyes closed, his head dropping back as he gasped out the vocal manifestation of his release. Jesus, he couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt this good. He knew he should feel bad for fucking a student, but he couldn’t find it in him to feel anything other than...
"He said 'yummy,' Pep! '
Steve smiled, leaning in and kissing Tony's shoulder. "What are you going to do about it?"
Day Thirteen: Deviant. Day Fourteen: Shrewd. Day Fifteen: Talented. He had no idea Steve thought of him that way. He was beginning to see Steve in a whole new light, and he was realizing he liked the Steve he was coming to know in these cards.
"You love me, and you know it."
Gripping at Steve’s hips, Tony pulled himself deeper and deeper into Steve’s tightness. After thrusting in and out of him a few times slowly, he found that Steve’s ass was giving way to him a little more easily and Tony could pump harder into her. Releasing one of his hips, he slid his hand around to grasp Steve’s cock. His hand met the rhythm he was pounding into his ass, drawing him to his release with him.
Tony smirked to himself and nodded. “Yes, Steve. Yes.”
“Sign me up, Mr. Stark.”
Steve shook his head, smiling softly. "You're an idiot."
Steve felt his cock twitch in his pants and even if he could go for another round, he had to get to practice, and coach would kill him if he was late. “Good night, Tony.”
The next week went by uneventful. He agreed with everything Steve had to say about him. Day Eight: Eccentric. Day Nine: Determined. Day Ten: Wise. Day Eleven: Asinine. Tony had to laugh. Day Twelve: Recalcitrant.
Steve gripped at the desk, smiling as he laid his head down. “Yeah, fuck me, Mr. Stark. Fuck my perfect hole! Fuck me!” He felt his ass being lubed up by what he was sure was Mr. Stark’s spit and moaned, pushing his ass back at his hand. “Fuck my ass, Mr. Stark!”
“You’ve gotta fucking be kidding me,” Steve grumbled out loudly, letting his books slam down on his desk before turning back to glare at the teacher in front of the otherwise empty classroom. “This is bullshit, Mr. Stark!”
Respectful. Artful. Noble. Theistic. Reserved. Objective. Genuine. Endearing. This word, three days before the exercise was over, at least on his end, stopped him yet again. Endearing? Tony thought he was endearing? He didn't even think Tony would use those kinds of words. It didn't seem to be a word that was used much in the twenty-first century. He found that this was probably his favorite word, even though he hadn't had the last two yet.
thinking he was perfect.
"Who do you work for?"
Steve's eyes widened. It was the closest they'd come to defining what they were, and he found he liked where this was going. "Well, then if that's how it is, I guess I wouldn't mind being branded with your moniker."
“Call me Steve, Mr. Stark. Please! Call me Steve!”
"No," Tony shook his head. "Definitely not, Steve."
Steve couldn’t help but smile at his teachers suggestion. Usually he’d tell a teacher to fuck off for offering more school work, but he knew that wasn’t the offer for that, and it excited him. He’d love to do this again.
Tony's breath hitched in his throat at Steve's fingers on his flesh. Even though their bodies were pressed together in their soft whisper, he couldn't believe that either of them were as calm as they were, not thinking about sex, well not only sex. What they had, even though it was as new as it was, wasn't just about the physical. It went far deeper than that.
There was a few moments of silence before Jarvis voice came through the house comm system. "
Once Tony could tell he was ready, he pulled his fingers from him and grabbed his cock, guiding it through Steve’s gorgeous ass cheeks before angling the head at Steve’s hole. He added a little more of his natural lube to it before letting it slide into Steve. He was so fucking tight. Jesus, he didn’t know how long he’d be able to hold back. He wanted to feel that tightness around his entire cock, but he knew he couldn’t just pound right into Steve. He didn’t want to hurt him.
“It very well may be bullshit, Mr. Rogers, but rules are rules. You do the deed, you’ll do the time.”
Tony's breath caught in his throat. "Wh- You do?"
“Oh,” Steve smirked, walking around the desk. “So you like to be on top. Got it.” He turned Mr. Stark in his chair to face him, coming down within inches of his face. “Gotta get you good and slicked up first.”
had something to do with all of it. Steve didn't mind. Things had changed, and he was able to easily change along with them. He and Bucky were no longer together, and it wasn't each of them "dying" that had done that either. Sure, it played a part in it, but Steve knew it wasn't just that.
Tony leaned down over Steve’s back, talking at the side of his head by his ear. “You talk too much, Mr. Rogers.”
Pepper reached forward, yanking the broken pieces of the defenseless pencil, thrusting another into his grasp. "Don't break that one. Just finish!"
Tony nodded his head, his lips grazing along the skin at the bottom of his neck above the collar of his shirt at his back, pressing his pelvis against him. "Can't you feel what you've done to me?"
Tony shuddered a bit, curling into the warm body next to him. "You better stop that," the warning came without a hint of foreboding.
Over the next few days, Tony found a note card on the same spot on the counter in the kitchen, in front of his coffee maker. Day One: Audacious. He couldn't argue with that. Day Two: Neurotic.
Tony smiled as Rogers left the classroom. “Night, Steve.”
"Oh, get over it, you big lug."
“You know, I’m sure I can give you a reason to let me go.”
After Bucky had regained his memories, he confessed to Steve that he was in love with Natasha, and if she would have him, he wanted to be with her. Steve gave his best friend his blessing and watched as the two of them fell in love. Steve had felt a little bad for Clint who he knew had feelings for Natasha himself, but it wasn't long before Clint found solace in a certain flyboy who oddly enough bore a striking resemblance to Steve, but no one ever said anything. That was weird enough as it was without people making comments about it.
Steve turned his head slightly, looking back at Tony. His cock was still deep inside his ass and he could still feel him throbbing there. Sweet Jesus, it was heaven. Everything that had just happened had been perfect.
Steve didn't agree with the words, but what was really getting to him was if Tony really thought of him as perfect. He didn't know if Pepper had asked him to find another word or if he'd just done it on his own. Either way, he was still stuck on the world he had chosen. Did Tony really think that he was perfect? Yes, he was made to be the perfect soldier, but there was a difference between that and someone else thinking he was really perfect. There was something different about
didn't cheat, Tony. Why are you saying he did?"
“I think I might get detention more often, Mr. Stark.”
The 21st century was different. Being different was acceptable, more so than it had been in the 1940s. He still wasn't sure when it had happened, but something Tony said about the '70s and
"Would you prefer I continued to call you Stark?" Steve felt as though his world was deflated around him.
Steve needed solace. Not that sitting in Tony's lab with Tony's blaring rock music would be considered solace to anyone else, Steve found a tranquility about the setting. Tony was completely and utterly relaxed in this element, and Steve found that relaxed him the most, never mind the heavy beats. His presence in the lab had been something both of them had gotten used to and it just seemed to be something they did after a while. But one night it morphed from being about quiet comfortability to something far more.
"Pepper, we've got a problem on our hands."
“Detention works, but I think some private tutoring would be a better idea.”
Steve grunted out, thrusting his cock into Tony’s hand and alternatingly pushing his ass back against Tony’s cock. It felt so good. Nothing had ever felt this good in his whole life and he knew it. Screaming out, “Tonnnnny!” he shot out his hot white release, gripping harder and harder onto the table.
Day Sixteen: Antagonistic. No argument there. Day Seventeen: Resurgent. On this day, he knew he had one more day of this activity, but Steve had gotten his final word today. Tony had thought Steve's list for him had been far better than the list Tony had made for him, and he decided he wanted to make up for it.
“Stop! Jesus, stop!”
On the last day though, Tony's last day, Steve ended up getting another card. He stopped after entering the kitchen, his head tilted to one side, not having expected to see another card hanging there. Walking over to it, he pulled the card down from the magnet, reading over the card. Swallowing hard, he leaned back against the counter, taking a deep breath. Out of all the cards he'd gotten, this card was the best.
He and Bucky had known each other for years, and Bucky had loved him even before the serum turned Steve into the super soldier he was now. They had something no one of that age would ever understand. Sure, Steve knew other men of The Howling Commandos who were like that also, but it wasn't something anyone talked about. They wouldn't. In those days, loving another man would get you locked up in an asylum. That wasn't where Steve wanted to live out the rest of his life. Not even that was better than waking up in the 21st century after a 75 year deep-freeze.
"Of course he is." Tony muttered something under his breath about Steve being
Steve shivered slightly. "Is that what you think, Stark? That I'm yours."
. Day Three: Transcendent.
Steve looked up at Mr. Stark, his mouth still wrapped around his thick length. He didn’t want to stop. This was too fucking good, but Steve could see that Mr. Stark didn’t want to start. he wanted more. He wanted him. Pulling back slowly, he left a trail of saliva from the tip of his teacher’s cock to his chin.
Steve gathered up his pencils, charcoal and sketchpad, leaving them there on the couch before walking over to Tony, letting his hand rest on the sleeping man's back. Steve had barely whispered his name when Tony moved only slightly, taking Steve's hand in his and pulling him into his arms. Their lips came together and Steve's eyes widened. He hadn't been expecting that, and honestly neither had Tony, but neither one of them pushed away from the other. They had come together in a way neither of them had expected right there on Tony's workbench. That had been just a few weeks ago.
"Yummy? He put "yummy" on my
e or anything, but the rest of the Avengers had been out.
"I designed it myself," Tony whispered against Steve's ear.
Tony turned swiftly, pinning him down on the bed and staring him down for a moment. Steve licked his lips and Tony couldn't help but stare at his luscious lips. "You're beautiful, you know that, Steve?"
“You’re the only teacher in this whole damned school who even dares to do this. Why do you think you’re so goddamned superior?”
Tony chuckled. "You're ridiculous! Not going to put that on your ass, baby."
Tony's brow arched in a slight smirk. "Always the sketch artist, even in bed?" He smiled, laying his hand flat on Steve's ass. "So, where did you want it? And what do you want it to be of?" He turned his head slightly, a gleam in his eyes. "I know! Property of Tony Stark, right here!" His fingers trailed along his lower back where it met his ass, skimming over his tailbone.
"Steve didn't have the help of an artificial intelligence, why should you?"
What if Steve didn’t want to do this again? What if this was just a one time thing to get him out of detention. It had anyhow. He wasn’t going to make him stay after this. Hell, he could. They could do this all over the classroom, but he knew he should probably let him go clean up or something. Hell, he needed to clean up himself too.
Tony reached up, grabbed the back of Steve's head and pulled Steve down to press his lips to the super soldier's. For a moment, Steve stood there, shocked. He couldn't believe Tony was actually kissing him. But what he couldn't believe even more was that he was enjoying it. He hadn't had much experience with kissing in his life, but out of all the people he has kissed, Tony had definitely topped them with just this single kiss.
Steve's cheeks turned bright red, swallowing hard and licking his lips. "Really?"
, he thought to himself,
"Have you ever fondued, Tony?"
The activity was finally over, and Tony found himself bouncing around, waiting for the moment he knew Steve would be awake. He hadn't slept all night. He'd been too eager to talk Steve.
Tony nodded as he stood, pulling Steve to stand with him and letting his cock pull out of the warmth of his ass. Steve leaned down to pull up his pants and turned to face him. The look in their eyes was more than either of them expected. For two people who hadn’t been able to tolerate each other five minutes ago, neither of them wanted anything more than to stay here with the other.
Tony pulled back, looking into his lover's eyes and smiling a little impishly. "Captain America wants some ink?" He let his hand slide gently over the smooth skin of his ass. "You want to cover up this perfect body?"
now. There had been a brief period of time after things ended between Tony and Pepper that Tony had gone back to his playboy ways, but it hadn't lasted long at all. It wasn't even then that he and Steve slept together for the first time, but it was in the middle of all that that the two of them stopped being at each others throats and started really getting along.
"Just words that remind you of Tony."
Steve had fallen asleep on the couch, something that he wasn't completely unaccustomed to doing, to find Tony passed out on his workbench. Usually it was Tony who came to wake Steve up to suggest he head to bed. Steve always urged him to go to bed at the same time, and they'd head up to the living quarters together. But that night had been different.
Steve smiled, looking up at him. “Yeah, you do want this.”
"Because he's my artificial intelligence." Tony was starting to get agitated, putting a little too much pressure on the writing utensil. It snapped in half and Tony let out an exasperated curse.
Steve let his fingers trail down over Tony's arm. He still couldn't get over how amazing Tony was. It had taken them a little more than a year to get to this point, and he still wasn't even sure where this was. He didn't understand what they had. It wasn't like what he had had with Bucky, but he was sure he felt something for the man laying beside him in the bed.
His fingers brushed over one of the tattoos Steve had discovered earlier on his lover's body. It was a beautiful piece of artwork, a phoenix bursting from the flames in the same vibrant gold and red as Tony's Iron Man suit. Steve had learned quite a bit about Tony in the time since he'd known him. The Internet was a really valuable resource. There wasn't anything you couldn't find on it, and Steve had done a lot of his research on the members of his team with it. There wasn't a whole lot to be found on Clint, Natasha and Thor, but there was quite a bit on Bruce and even more on Tony.
"Well, it won't be now!"
, but continued writing on the paper with the pencil. "Can I not just run through this with Jarvis?" he asked for the umpteenth time.
"Run out of creamer?"
Tony smiled smuggly, pleased of himself. "Definitely, my white knight!"
Steve swallowed. "That is your name, isn't it?"
The phoenix on his hip reminded him of something he had said at the Stark Expo a few years ago, about a year before they had met each other. "
"Do you know how hot you are when you're being domestic, Cap?"
"Yeah, that's all very well, you and I were together for two years. This is Steve we're talking about. He cheated!"
, Tony."
Tony looked up at him, their eyes millimeters from each other. "Fondued?"
Those words didn't hurt like they had a year ago. They had gotten past all that. Tony really hadn't meant to say what he'd said on the helicarrier. And he knew Steve knew it too.
Steve smiled up at him. "Everything beautiful about me came out of a bottle."
Smirking, Steve reached into his pants and pulled out the hardened cock, pulling it out of his boxers and stroking it thoroughly. “I think your cock would say differently.”
The next morning, another card hung on the fridge. He read it. Thoughtful. Again, Steve had a great day. On the third day, he had to think a bit about the word he found. Efficacious.
Tony was about to voice another empty rebuttal until Steve’s lips wrapped around his already throbbing cock. His hand immediately went to the back of his head, pushing him down more on him. Jesus, this was better than he could have imagined. Steve took him in like a pro. Tony lifted his hips more against Steve’s mouth, wanting Steve to take as much as he could take.
Tony opened the cupboard to check, just in case. "No," he shook his head, closing the door and picking up the card again. "Steve cheated."
Steve lunged out into the open again and hurling the disk.  It struck the top of the post Clint was standing on, forcing him to abandon it or risk losing his balance.
“I won’t tell if you won’t but you know Riri,” Jaime was agreeing as he slung an arm over her shoulder. “The toaster will probably have told her. I swear she talks to machines.”
The bottom is in tatters and stained black halfway up the thigh with mud and soot. It had been a pretty hand-me- down once, but now it is a dull grey that reminds them of the fire that took away their home. The smell of smoke still lingers on it, thick in their nose whenever they breathe.
bondmate
The strange kat perched on the counter laughs and the kit jerks, reminded again of his presence. He frowns. The feeling of jarring wrongness tickles at the back of his mind again. Makes the tiny store and everything beyond it seem somehow less real, as if he is staring through a fun house mirror at a reflection of reality but can't get his hands on the real thing.
“I got him!” Spiderman crowed from atop his new perch.
It had not surprised Thor that Clint had put up the heaviest amount of protest when Tony had invited the others to accompany them on their journey.
She shot back, silently reprimanding herself for her slip and refocusing on her work. She was not some sniffling kitten who needed a tom's shoulder to lean on every time she felt a little sad. She had shit to do!
Tony nodded, popping the P on his affirmative yup.
"Director Fury, I'd like that question answered as well" she demanded.
tea. That means sunshine in English.”
Not the boy. He doesn’t want to take from the boy.
But like so much of Sarah Rogers wisdom it was wasted on her youngest child.  Steve had done nothing but borrow worry as he’d sped down the long and lonely stretch of highway between Boston and Richardsville Georgia, a little town about fifty miles outside of Savanah that nobody had ever heard of unless they’d escaped from it.
She winked cheekily at Steve with an amused hum, transferring a juicy portion of the steak from her plate to Rumiko’s dish with fork and knife. At formal functions Gata were always served some variant of fish rather than whatever their masters were eating.
. He berated himself with a groan, rubbing his palm against his eyes in exhaustion.  This wasn’t helping. He’d made the decision to trust T’Challa because they needed him, and that was only getting truer by the second. His instincts told him the tom was being as honest as he could afford to be and as long as Tony wasn’t a complete fool about it and let his attraction make him blind to any red flags or hints of possible threat, then he was doing his best.
It was silver and blue, strung delicately with precious stones. It climbed up her throat and draped almost lovingly over her shoulders in glistening threads. It swept across the top of her bared breasts to flow just between them where a large shimmering stone sat in the center of her chest, appearing to hold the ornate collar and the shimmery fabric of her skirts together.
“Squishy science is not my thing. He backed that bill for tighter regulations against labs using Gata as test subjects, that’s all I cared about at the time. I even helped provide his security.”
“Yes father, I’ve heard you.”
Down below her Killian was standing over an operating table and there was someone strapped to it, though Killian was blocking their upper half.
“That’s my whole point. Dad said he and Aunt Natasha had been working in Washington for six months before the mess with Project Oversight. That’s supposed to happen in June. It’s already February and they’re not in Washington.”
"Worst case and honestly most likely scenario, is total system failure resulting in death before I ever leave the cradle." He admitted, steeling himself against the barrage of emotions at the edges of his mind, demanding focus and connection. Not yet, he thought with gritted teeth. The middle of a crisis was no time to go foraging irreversible bonds that none of them could take back. Well maybe except for one.
I really hope you enjoyed and am excited to hear what predictions you might have. Next chapter Rhodey comes to town and we're going to get to hear from Natasha, who is going to be very busy trying to figure out who is behind the 'exploding people' while Senator Stern and the government goonies try and take the Ironman armor for themselves. Clint's still a terrible patient and Steve's not much better but at least they're back at the tower. She likes her boys where she can keep an eye on them.
Obi was right, their noses are different. Isiah's stands out on his face but he doesn't look bad for it.
Nyota was one of the last to stumble into the canteen four hours later. The sun had risen and the others had already cracked into the ARKS food stores. Those deemed old enough not to set the ship on fire took turns cooking for the others. It had been Kate’s turn this morning and Nyota was glad because besides herself, Kate was one of the better cooks. She could scramble an egg without burning it at the very least unlike some other people Nyota could name (Jaime).
“You weren't surprised by Thor's story. You’ve heard of these things before.” Natasha pointed out with a deceptive casualty to her tone that didn’t hint at any of the suspicion she felt, and Luke nodded in the affirmative.
But JARVIS was already searching the local reports and chimed in with a negative as the car rounded the curve and a long line of familiar trucks came into view.
Things are finally going good for Tony Stark. He's not dying, he's got his island, and thanks to a plucky young intern He's two steps closer to establishing a free country for Gata. While Tony sets the board, Clint waits for the inevitable, Steve struggles to figure out the rules of the game, and it all just feels like the pause before the storm.
“How come you’re not dressed Tony?” Pepper asked and in reply Tony reached up and pressed the button on the side of his custom glasses. A pair of metal wings slid out of the nearly invisible slits in the back of his suit jacket while above his head the holographic image of a halo appeared.
Natasha had always hated that ending.
Of course, that was the moment the Avengers alert system went off.
And since Tony was still uncomfortable with inviting more strangers than he had to into the shelter kats temporary home, it meant having to improvise on some of the traditional entertainment for the kits.
Vonkov is furious and threatens to tell Tony's parents when they return, but Jarvis looks ready to do the man in and it frightens him enough to scuttle when Jarvis offers to show him the door.
Wordlessly she reaches for him and he scoops the girl up into his arms and rises with her, looking between them and Steve.
"Yes, it is. And you must remember darling that it is our secret. Won't you?"
“Honestly the man’s a little unhinged so he could be up to anything, but yeah that’s my fear.” Tony admitted.
Broken. Needs to focus on the mission before the wrong people catch on. He and his charges are on this mission ‘solo’ but that doesn’t mean there aren’t other eyes around. Hydra has eyes everywhere, and if they catch on to the fact that Ivan has a screw loose in his head and his thoughts are spinning out of joint like an over worked machine, then they will take him out of the field. They’ll wipe him, and he’ll lose the man slowly coming together in the mirror. Worse. He’ll lose Wanda and Pietro, just like he lost
The man the soldier was before this was not so willing. A blind fool, unable to see the might of the empire, and so he had to be crushed and stripped of everything.
So the only explanation he can give for why that unexpectedly bold pass makes his cheeks flush and nearly causes him to choke and die on his dinner, is that the ball came out of left field.
Strangely, he was never more glad to have been wrong. Maybe it was the eyes, but at the first sight of her something inside Tony he had never even known was missing clicked into place.
Steve seemed to read his mind and closed the minimal distance between them, touching his arm to draw his gaze back up.
The lights had been dimmed for better TV watching and the glow of the television had been almost pretty as it splashed over sleepy faces. Tony had been soft against Steve’s chest, contentment in every languid line of his body as another Star Trek episode played and Tony tried to explain to him why something called a Gorn is one of the most terrifying creatures in possible existence (it’s really not) and Steve hadn’t really caught most of it, but he’d been looking down at Tony and thinking how sweetly ridiculous Tony was being and how happy it made him.
Tony, T’Challa, Helen, and Bruce. They’d all figured this thing out together. Helen was an expert in bio-engineering but T’Challa was better versed in healthy Gata biology. T’Challa was a good balance, he knew that intellectually, but when Tony stepped into the Cradle tomorrow he’d be completely defenseless, his life in their hands, and Tony wasn’t sure if he could bring himself to invest that level of trust in the tom just yet.
The Widow is there, shouting a warning to Iron Man as Wanda materialized from thin air to throw a fiery red bomb within their midst. Ivan wasn’t surprised at all when Pietro appeared at her side a second later, winking down at Ivan before grabbing her wrist. They’ve practiced speeding together enough for the maneuver to have become instinct. The twins are gone before the Avengers can blink, and Ivan is gone before the smoke can even clear.
“But do you trust us?”  Natasha had kept quiet, but Tony looked at her now trying not to flinch at the hard stare she was giving him. “Because it looks like you don’t. You’re ripe with heat. By the smell of you I give it two, maybe three days if you’re lucky before you can’t function, and you want to go off on your own again.”
"Wait so we're good enough to spawn but not good enough to talk to, is that it?" Clint scoffed loudly in the woman's direction, only Tigger (Tony was calling him that from now on) really didn't like that because his gold eyes bugged out and a hair raising snarl ripped through the air.
Tony shook off his growing hysteria. He couldn’t let the fear that this guy (or girl) whoever they were was smarter get to him. He
The room was suddenly awash with holographic images of a sandy shore, as the sound of waves filled all their ears. Steve was not the only one whose face registered shock and wide eyed amazement as the very realistic looking computer simulation took them from the beach through the streets of what looked like a pristine seaside town out of one of the science fiction magazines that Bucky used to devour.
"Scheduled adjustments have been made Sir. Test samples have produced results with consistent nintey-seven percent accuracy." JARVIS promptly answered and Tony hummed in displeasure.
“I’ll see you up at the lodge?” Tony’s eyes met Pepper’s holographic ones and she nodded.
“Gross, Barton, and remind me never to put you in charge of diplomatic relations.” Tony wrinkled his nose at the blond tom and Steve laughed as Clint nodded sagely in return muttering something about his work there being done.
Sure enough.
By the time he is three he’s torn the toys all apart and made them better anyway, because toys are for babies.
Clint glanced down at the soft sound of her voice but Natasha didn’t look away from the controls of the jet, as if to lead by example, and Clint smiled despite himself.
Focus. He needs to focus.
Only, Ty had been like that too, the first time Tony's spindly teenage body had started pumping out heat pheromones Ty hadn't wanted to let go of him and they'd had so much reckless rebellious sex it's only a wonder that Tony never figured out that he was playing right into everybody's hands.
“They were kats. Black kats.” Peter admitted quietly, shoulders slumping. Feral kats, like Peter. Like Tony. Dangerous.
“Where do you take a billionaire who also happens to be your Queen, when you want him to agree to be your… well yours, I guess.” Steve pushed the words out in a rush as he stepped into the common room and the chatter from the rooms occupants instantly died.
“You wanted to see me Mr. Stark?”
Ivan found the twins later, at the rendezvous spot.
Fuck his directives.
Like how dare Tony think of doing anything without their support! Jesus could this guy get any more self righteous. Had Tony had a team when his old man was trying to turn him into some sort of super tom (into Steve)? Had Tony had a team when Howard was bargaining his unborn kits to his business rival and threatening to make Tony's life hell if he didn't comply? Had Tony had a team when he was in that cave in Afghanistan? No. He'd survived all of that on his own thank you very much why the hell should he cry for help just because his dick of an ex was back in town?!
"Hey! The hell are you doing?" Tony seethed, perplexed that he had somehow or another ended up under the smugly grinning tom, pinned between his body and the machine.
The strange woman grips Mama's face and talks at her in Hebrew before pressing kisses to her wet cheeks.
Rhodey asked once what it was like (because the first thing people want to know when you tell them your mind stores everything is whether you remember being born for some reason). Tony found it difficult to explain, and he doesn’t think he’d do any better now as an adult. How does one explain the very beginning of themselves?
"Hmm?" Tony hummed, caught off guard by the greeting until he came back to the present and smiled.
~*~*~
“We’ll keep an eye on him.” Natasha said, and Bruce looked over at her, meeting her serious gaze and the tom slowly nodded.
"Sure JARVIS." Tony answered and Luke shifted away from the console.
He tried to shake the strange feeling of creeping panic in the back of his mind as he quickly assessed the situation. Six A.C. officers were anxiously approaching an overturned cart in the center of the floor with weapons drawn. The cart’s wheels were still spinning, and the merchandise it had once displayed was scattered far and wide. There were two noticeable bullet holes in the underside, hiking Tony’s anxiety up a notch. One or both could be injured, and either one was bad news. Potential enemies or not, he didn’t want harm to come to these kits, these
In this moment Tony is free and happy and the warmth that fills into his heart is evidence of Hughard's failure.
Luke calmly went about his work, finishing with the pain drip and moving closer to the bed in order to begin unwrapping the bandages from around Clint's neck and shoulders.

Dad wasn’t half the distracted genius that he pretended to be. He’d notice any cracks in her cover, any oddities or stupid missteps like a young woman not up to date on the latest pop trends, or unfamiliar with the fact that unless she was covered up, a fel couldn’t get on stage and sing about anything of substance. People liked their kittens bubble gum bright, covered in body glitter, doing their best imitation of morons stuck in perpetual infancy – with an extra flimsy miniskirt on the side, please and thanks (because dirty mother fuckers).
“Yes. Bruce and I have both seen it,” She finally answered and Steve nodded. Good less to explain. Wordlessly he offered her the sketchbook.
Bruce’s thoughts trickled through their minds as General Ross continued on his way down the carpet.
“I think Cap’s on to something there Nicko. Which is how I know you’re going to give me everything I’m asking for and a pony besides. Am I right, or am I right?”
They might get away with adding new additions for a year or two but sooner or later some asshole in Washington was going to realize what was growing under their noses, but by then Tony will have tied them up in so much red tape they wouldn’t be able to scratch their asses without his permission. The best part was it was going to be their own greed, their own desire for more and more weapons that was going to path the way.
WHILE IT THRILLS ME THAT YOU HAVE NOT LOST YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR, IT WOULD DO BETTER FOR MY HEART IF YOU LISTENED VERY CAREFULY TO WHAT I SAY, AND STAY AWAY FROM THAT MAN. YOU MUST FOCUS ON THE TASK AT HAND. THE SOLDIER MAY BE A TRAP.
“We need to slow down the serum. Reduce the strain on his body.” Bruce’s fingers began to punch in commands but Helen’s hand darted out to still him, the fel shaking her head adamantly.
He'd spent eight months building that cover before it had finally paid off in the form of a prized apprenticeship at Stark Industries. Maria's House prioritized teaching all willing residents a form of trade and finding them job placements with trusted handlers when they were ready to reenter the world.
And Tony wasn’t just anybody either. He could admit that it was a little intimidating trying to think up ways to impress Tony Stark. All of his ideas felt silly when he considered that Tony could buy himself something a hundred times better than any bouquet Steve could afford and that Tony had eaten with the President at the White House so good luck trying to find a restaurant to top that.
It was like they were being drawn together by some invisible rope, or better yet, pulled to the center of gravity and too bad for Tony some biological destiny had labeled him the core.
In which it's spring and Tony is a busy kitten. The world still sucks. The winter soldier is still at large and Tony's soulmate might be a twenty-year-old MIT student who goes by Princess.
"You dare much Anthony of House Stark." She warned him lowly biting delicately from the meat she cradled between her claws. "But thankfully for you, I admire your audacity."
Tony called Steve a worry wart, but asked JARVIS to allow audio between the room and the hall and had talked to Harley through the intercom while the boy had pressed his face up against the (not) glass and drank him in with his eyes.
"I will see you soon, Ayeba." The tom called down to him before soaring away, and Tony tried not to pout that he didn't even get a chance to inspect those gorgeous wings to see what kind of metal they were made out of.
"Well you might be right, we'll certainly see." Robert conceded graciously but Tony knew there was nothing gracious left in Stone.
There! Tony’s eyes lurched back toward the glowing moon. Just a shimmer. But something had passed by it.  He raised a fist and launched two of his smart missiles.  Too small to down a ship mid air but enough to cause nasty damage if they struck or make a lot of sparkle if they encountered something else first.
"If it was for profit they wouldn't have gone after damaged goods." Steve's eyes narrowed in censure and Natasha almost smiled. "Fact of life Rogers."
"It was a joke big guy." He sighed, mustering a sincere if somewhat brief smile. "Congratulations you two. Really. "
"Steve," he began with a slow breath, opening his eyes once more. "I don't regret kissing you. Not one bit, believe that when I say I think we should take this slow. I'm not going anywhere, and I don't care what everyone thinks. We're not mating just because it's the easy answer. We both deserve better. Don't we?"
"Oh don't be an ass!" Turning to Mama Antonia grabs her hand. "You're here and so is he. A cold he tells me, this from the man who worked on our wedding day. Bah! Come now, what are we hanging around on the stoop for? We just finished breakfast but I'm sure there's something I can throw together. I baked the bread just yesterday. You remember Maria, my mother's recipe?"
"People need safe spaces." Steve answered still looking up at the glowing sign. "Belles is a kennel club. I'm not sure if you know-"
Natasha still didn’t speak and when Tony looked up it was to see that she’d stepped back, her blank face gone very pale.
“I am at your service, Ayeba.” The guy answered, dipping into a graceful if shallow bow, which answered nothing by the way, and Tony got the feeling the guy knew it and there was a shit eating grin happening under that mask; but he didn’t get the chance to do anything about it.
“Got it in one.” Tony raised his mug to him in toast and the kit pumped his fist in the air in victory. Steve was wearing a particularly hang dog look that Tony suspected was half bullshit, but he was a sucker so he sighed and said, “A very hot slug. The hottest. Not at all family friendly. Not all that plushy either. You need stuffing. I volunteer as tribute.”
Currently, the probability of a Steve related distraction was at 21%.
~*~Two Days Later~*~
“Our parents are dead.” Tommy snapped back. “And they’re going to be dead much sooner and completely blink us out of existence if we don’t do something.”
The others had flipped when she’d told them. At first they’d been mad that she’d risked their lives the way she had but once the fact that they were all alive had really had a chance to settle, the thought of going home and rescuing their parents was too big for any of them to ignore for long.
“Tony?” Bruce’s soft voice drew Tony out of his dark contemplation and he realized he was squeezing Tink to his chest rather tightly, but the little girl hadn’t made a sound, grey eyes watching him solemnly as they peeked through her white blond bangs.
Just look at JARVIS. He was living, and growing more every day, and Tony was more than aware of how dangerously (tantalizingly) close he'd come to creating something (someone) whose programming mirrored his own, performing functions one would have to call a form of feeling and thinking, begging the question of when does simple mechanics become something more (something sentient).
"It helps you sleep" he'd said, and Tony couldn't sleep because his body had begun preparing for heat, his scent already deepening with an edge of spice that Clint just wanted to close his eyes and roll around in until the end of his days.
It shouldn’t even have been that big of a deal, except when Tony had touched him it had felt like finally taking a breath after nearly drowning.
“Me, Your Sanctimonious?” Tony answered, keeping his voice just as low and smile bright. “I wouldn’t dream of it.”
“Tony?” Steve called his name to alert him to his presence, just in case he hadn’t heard JARVIS or the door. Sketchbook in hand he began to walk toward him.
Gritting his teeth Steve inched backward, closer to Bruce, keeping his shield up for protection.
“Do you accuse my Prince of lying?” Nakia asked with a dangerous sounding hiss and Tony’s fur practically stood on end in warning. In about two seconds they were going to have an all-out brawl on their hands.
Some people did it, they both knew that, but Ma would have had kits if she’d caught them touching each other. It’s wrong, they say, for humans to take advantage of kats in heat. Only deviants do that.
He'd walked that road for years until the night he finally got picked up by SHEILD when one of Marko's jobs went bust. It was the run of the mill black market op. Transport goods across the city and if the feds show up take care of them.
Right. Tony sighed.
Nyota swallowed, gulping down a breath of cool air but it did nothing to relieve the burning in her gut. Riri had a good point. Even so, Nyota hated the idea but since she couldn’t explain to any of them why she hated it without admitting how weak she was, she just shrugged.
“Is that… Tony who…?” Steve didn’t seem able to find the words. He looked pale and strangely horrified as if Tony had shown him something sick and twisted instead of something so beautiful Tony played it over and over again in his mind on loop and welcomed the nights it seeped into his dreams. You know, when he slept. Which if he was pregnant, might have to change. A lot of things would.
Coulson cleared his throat, breaking up the moment.
“I’m staying here.”
“One, how is your lame ass getting knocked out my fault and two aren’t you technically dead? Am I being haunted right now?”
“How did you know I was there?” He questions with a pout and father reaches to tug playfully on his ear.
“They’re getting away! Their suits are capable of some sort of stealth mode.” Steve shouted too loudly back, like somebody hard of hearing and Tony made a mental note to tease him about that later.  For the time being he was busy searching through the security feeds for any sign of them despite how useless he knew it would be.
Well, he was a big boy now. A fully functional Queen. Was there any point in waiting? What better way to get Pride Avengers truly off the ground than by bonding with his mate? Tony’s heart started to pound in anticipation as the thought took root.
“Is this the same Papa who used to tell you not to play with your food?” Tony teased, “he sounds like a drag.”
Tony stop.
“Can we really trust that Tony's going to tell us everything there is to know?”
“I don’t.”
Those are the times when he gets to be Ivan.
He’d not realized how hungry his amino acid ravenous body was getting until just that moment, but the smell of the fish was so divine that his stomach gave a painful twist of need and he groaned at the sight of it.
Tony smiled back.
“I am indeed Mr. Parker.” The A.I. JARVIS answered. “Though I don’t know if it is necessarily accurate to assign me a gender, I have found I prefer the designation of he over it.”
“I’m sorry Sir,” JARVIS said regretfully as the words continued to flash. “It appears we suddenly lost contact with the unit.”
Howard had only ever paid attention to Tony in the beginning when it was to test him.
They were luckier than Steve realized that they had Prince T’Challa as a resource.
Could Tony even find the words to begin explaining what Tiberius Stone had done to him, and why the grisly thought of ripping off heads got decidedly less grisly the longer he contemplated the two together?
Clint shrugged.
He's also being yelled at and yanked about by the police officer who Tony realizes intends to arrest him. The older boy is trying to explain, in a garbled mix of German and Hungarian, but the officer either doesn't speak it or he doesn't care what the negro boy has to say.
“Relax Prince Ali, no need to take yourself so seriously. I’m a big boy. Nothing’s broken. Like I said, it’s all by gones.”
"I believe I am your benevolent creator JARVIS not Agent." Tony grumbled without much heat.
Steve took a deep breath and let it out slowly.
“Yes.” T’Challa answered simply. “There are pros and cons to everything, and one of the cons to our biology is there is little hiding chemistry when it’s there. It’s been known to cause more than a few fights between rival suitors. Captain Rogers must have feel his claim on your affections was under threat.”
The probability that Clint would have made some sort of culinary disaster and would come whining to Bruce for help around dinner time was 11.7% based off of the rotation schedule that Coulson had put together for the kitchen – because feeding them all was a chore, and if shared meals was going to be the norm, Coulson was all about making it efficient.
“I prefer my own knives. That one is yours.”
Tony had always prided himself on being a strong independent kitten who didn’t need no flea-bitten tom, but lately… lately he just wasn’t right unless his teammates were close. His need to know where they were at all times was only surpassed by his need to know that they were well. The smell of them safe and happy, enjoying the comfort of his tower and his gifts just did something for him. Honestly it was better than Nip.
"Look." He began, wiping a tired hand down his face. "Believe it or not I'm on your side here. My goal has always been the pride. If you think I'm about to throw it all away by giving Viastone the kind of leverage that Robert Stone is angling for. Think again.
"Yeah fantastic," Tony grumbled because if he didn't know any better, he'd think that Loki had just told him he was hallucinating him. But if he was why would he trust the word of his hallucination?
She would be watching them closely, Thor warned, hoping that Stark and the captain would heed his words. He could not fix the ills of the past or change the horrors that had already occurred but he could help perhaps, return something vital to his young friend.
“Yes. He was surprised but eager to schedule a sit-down. Do you really think it’s wise, scheduling a meeting with a potential terrorist?”
Tony never breaks. There is iron in him after all.
“American Catastrophe- How interspecies unions threaten the nation.” Clint read over his shoulder with a scoff. “The Star needs to hire new writers. I could come up with ten better headlines in my sleep.”
Tony thought back with a snap as Pepper’s tired voice filled his ear.
"Yes Mom.” Clint said muffled, straightening up with a box full of leftover pizza in hand and a cold slice between his teeth.
He knew a call to arms when he heard it and couldn't shake the feeling that Tony was planning something bigger. He was holding things back, not showing them all of the cards he had in his hand and that meant leaving Steve to operate in the dark.
“You guys are out numbered. You sure you don’t want to call for backup?” Steve, ever the gentlemen, asked and T’Challa smiled back with his teeth.
“Natasha’s there.” Phil replied a bit noncommittally and Clint scowled. Natasha wasn’t exactly a diplomat and he still wasn’t sure how much she put up with Stark for his sake. And she had to be pissed at him for running off like that. Tony was a pill but he was more fragile than people gave him credit for and Natasha wasn't known for pulling her punches.
Ana comes to see why they are late for lunch. He doesn’t turn around to look at her but he hears the shocked inhale of breath she takes at the sight of the livid bruises and welts across the back of his legs. Vonkov tells her that Tony will not be eating until he has finished his punishment.
This dream was stranger than the others. He was nowhere that he recognized and yet there was something achingly familiar about the shimmer of nearly too blue water shimmering under summer sun and the wind tossing the waves.
After twenty years he’d dropped the Mr. and Tony didn’t mind it a single bit when the flamboyantly expressive man called him kitten. Darren called all his girls gata or otherwise kittens.
It was amazing to her how wounded he could manage to sound around those words, and still have the courage to ask them. But perhaps it was easier for him than for a man like the Colonel. He wasn't a company man, despite the uniform. Steve's faith was in people.
Please. Some part of Tony pleaded. Please what, he wasn’t as sure. Please be willing. Please don’t let him be wrong. Please don’t be like Obie and everyone else he’d trusted.
"Jarvis? Am I a Jew?" He asks, and the gentle hands smoothing cream into his skin go still.
“Technically we wouldn’t have to.” Riri theorized, catching on to Nyota’s thoughts. Nyota beamed at her. “If we could open a portal between both earths just before the incursion point, theoretically we could time it so that one of those earths jumped to another designated location, say ahead of the collision point, thereby missing the collision altogether. It would be nearly instantaneous. The people on planet wouldn’t feel a thing.”
One, he just shot energy beams out of his fucking hands, so not bad for a single lifetime.
“The kats at that shelter are under Tony’s protection,” Bruce answered calmly, his voice echoing a tension Clint knew they all felt.
There were fireworks going off in Tony’s brain and not just the sexy kind. The sexy part - the part of him that lost his breath as Steve pushed him back against the roof ledge and practically purred at the hard press of muscle against his – that part almost made it impossible to focus on anything else. Because Steve kissed like he was waging war, like he didn't know how to do anything else, and thrilling as that was Tony wondered what it would be like to make him go slow, to teach him how two bodies could dance without touching the floor.
“And you will be the Panther, just as my brother is. Do you think your uncle is less than I am?” T’Chaka scolded, pausing them right in the middle of the hall with a firm grip on his arm. It was still busy in this section of the palace at this time of day, the holy men trailing up from the temple with the visiting noble men and women from the other tribes.
What it actually means is a little more complicated.
His boy hadn't liked it, and neither had Ma, but the kit had insisted. Ma had let the kit keep the money. Said it was his, like giving it to him would make them all feel less dirty about what had happened.
“Both of you are going to be in my head at the same time. You can talk to him.”
"Some of you have decided to try and find a place in a family that needs you and I respect that. Stark Industries has and will continue to support cross-community rehabilitation by providing stipends to the veterans and low income families who desire true companionship and mutual growth in partnership with the Gata community and have a place in their homes for you.”
The soldier holds their body like they’re going to ascend any moment without him, like they have the divine in them when really, it is he who is so terribly beautiful. He is fallen, but still an angel. They know it even then. Perhaps that’s why they fall as hard as they do. Angels are for redemption.
They are the only surviving test subjects to come out of Castle Black. They have both successfully been crossed with mutant genes, but Wanda has powers of the mind that go beyond anyone’s ability to fathom. Her potential is devastating. The world should be very afraid.
“Then we’ll help him,” Steve murmured, leaning close. He kissed Tony chastely, over and done far too quickly for Tony’s liking. So Tony grabbed him by the collar and pulled him back in, deepening the kiss.
"How what works?" Clint asked warily, not liking the feeling of where this might be leading.
Steve’s hands tightened around his shirt and Tony only had the barest moment to note the sudden change in his scent before Steve’s gaze fixated on his mouth and his intentions became clear.
“It did, and it’s the only reason we’re having this little talk and I didn’t just crack your mind open and go digging for the truth.” He growled back in answer and he felt the tension drawing tight in the room, tighter than a bowstring as silence fell heavily between the three of them.
The probability of being woken by a fel's heat calls were even lower in the tower because the walls were reinforced and the only two fels in residence didn't trust strangers enough to risk enticing any random tom off the street into their sanctuary.
Almost as soon as he said it, the Avengers alert system began to blare.
Tony snorted.
And if you're not American and today is just Thursday lol, Happy Thursday.
Forward, forward, but don't let us fall.
“Yes Captain,” Jarvis answered the lights in the gym dimming momentarily as the floor began to shift and the platforms both teams were standing on began to raise.
“Ivan saved my life against orders and brought me to them for training. He was their best, and he knew they were greedy to make more like him but they’d not succeeded with other Gata. He offered to train me himself, and promised them that where the others had failed I wouldn’t. I knew I was fighting for my life Steve, but in the Red Room that almost seemed normal. I was more afraid they’d take him away or punish him for my failures. So I made it my mission not to fail.”
Everybody look at the failed experiment that got Captain America killed, or some variant of the same. Wasn't he supposed to be their Queen? How could he let something like this happen? Figures.
He could have said that even when other kats couldn’t necessarily tell the difference that he always could, because people tended to carry their parent’s signatures and perhaps it was an aspect of Tony’s biological imprint, but he’d always been adept at unraveling the parts of a scent and understanding the code therein (when he bothered to that is, he is distracted often by bigger things like Stark Industries and saving the world from alien invasion).
For an achingly long moment he waited, wondering if she would offer him the truth or make him tear the choice away from her.
Well, the guy was a literal unknown whose motives were up in the air, with highly advanced tech that screamed that whatever his agenda he was no one to cross.
Clint continued to dig around in the refrigerator, oblivious, shrugging his muscled shoulders loosely and muttering, “His loss. Bill really knows what he's doing. The place looks great Tony."
As a reminder this is a poly fic with multiple combinations of relationships, but a Queen only has one consort. I think it will be very easy to understand and support why Tony chooses the one he chooses, but that doesn't mean his other options are less worthy or loved less. Please don't character bash it hurts my soul lol.
They were changing the game and nobody liked it when you did that.
“How dare you do this?! I could kill you boy!”
"Look, I wouldn't come only... there's word going around that I'm a thief and none of the farmers will give me work. I'm just hungry is all and I'll work for it fair, and seeing how it's that copper tellin everybody I'm no good. Way I see it is you owe me."
“Pepper can’t stop an enhanced enemy and it’s not the point.”
Tony now needed three times the daily nutrition recommended for an adult male of his species, heavy on those amino acids, or else his body was going to break itself down all the quicker (and they'd all seen what that looked like).
Okay. Tony swallowed thickly, trying desperately to reign himself in. So this wasn't rocket science. Tony’s body is dropping him into heat and when he isn’t hot, achy, and getting irritated at every foreign smell that wafts past his nose, he’s pretty much thinking about these fluffy little balls of snot and curiosity that some people call children.
The kit can’t smell him because- well truth is, he doesn’t know why. That’s wrong too. Everything else about the store is right. Mr. Allen’s smiling face, the shelves full of canned goods now that nobody can afford the fresher stuff. He can smell Mr. Allen’s sweat, Mrs. Finnegan’s dog that even her heavy perfume can’t hide from his nose, and even the fresh bread that Marilyn bakes every morning, but he can’t smell the fancy looking kat with the funny beard who waves at him and smirks like he knows something nobody else does.
And it felt a lot like being wounded. Like he’d been stabbed in the chest and instead of getting stitched up he was trying to walk around like nothing had happened, losing blood with every step but nobody but him could see the gaping hole in his chest.
He and Steve, they needed to talk.
He started out as Zero. A nothing. A nobody whose name is as unimportant as his designation, but nevertheless was the foundation of all that made asset number thirty-two - sequence X, a success.
“Because I want to believe in us too, and I saw something that rocked my faith.” Tony frowned and Steve pressed on gently. “That’s just my point. Last night I chose to have a future with you and if that’s going to work, then Sweetheart our faiths gotta be in each other. Not in dreams or anything else. Don’t you think?”
“We’re different.” Tony shook as if Steve had said something to contradict him. “You know that I can’t replace him right? Sure, maybe some things are similar and maybe for a little bit it will seem like enough. I think I’m selfish enough to even let you… but eventually you’re going to get frustrated because I forgot it was your birthday, or I didn’t consult you before I did something I thought was necessary and you’re going to hate that you’re stuck with me. Just me. So what I need…”
As he breathes he imagines himself to be sinking inside their stream. He lets their ebb and flow surround him until Bruce’s thoughts are not just an impression but a steady stream of pictures surrounding them in brilliant display.
They (Bruce) clutch a book tightly between their hands. The spine creaks like it’s going to crack. It’s a book on space.
"If it's not one King breathing down my neck then it's an Emperor Maria. How do you think Wilhelm or Franz Joseph are going to feel if I start selling to Victor Emanuel? I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror if I climbed into bed with Italy.”
He was worried, but she knew he'd get them to the barn. Becuase Tony wasn't going to die alone and gutted in the snow any more than she was. That wasn't who he was.
Good thing too because a moment later the shield erupted out of the adjacent wall like something out of a horror film, not an inch away from where Tony had been a moment before. Tony was already on the attack. He’d noticed the metallic band on the guy’s right wrist, and the small square plate in the center where a silver hub had once rested. It looked eerily similar in design to a wireless charging dock he was in the middle of developing for the latest Stark Phone.
But as far as Tony was concerned Tiberius had made his.
It’s cold out here... but it's beautiful too.
He reached inside the suits controls with barely a thought. With a series of clicks and groans the suit locked into place like a knight standing guard, plates parting like doors to let Tony step through, clad in the skin tight under armor he'd developed for the sentry capable suit.
"I'm sorry Sir, but I could not defragment the audio samples further without compromising their integrity."
"Funny things usually are, we've covered this material
Hello! I needed to split this chapter into two parts so the second part will be posted on Sunday per the usual schedule. Enjoy the madness. Part one owes its title to, and is brought to you almost entirely by, "I Won't Say I'm In Love"
Why would he want to unravel the best and brightest of possible futures to find the fatal flaws? Can’t he just… can’t he just be happy for once? Have something good and keep it?
“Extremis.” Bruce answered with a bit of an awed gleam in his eye. It was always nice when other people understood how awesome this kind of thing was.
When you were a kat everything was mister, sir and mam, and Tony had learned that the quickest way to gain control of a conversation was to establish his own rules. He could practically smell the irritation wafting off of Tiberius at being ignored and that was just a bonus.
But once they’d pulled up outside the red carpet that had been lain along the private air strip in preparation of the ambassador’s arrival silence descended once more. They were hardly alone on the airstrip. Outside the window almost as far as the eye could see there were a crowd of journalists and the like, all of them held back by security and plenty of red tape so that the official men and women who formed the welcoming party could wait where the stairs would end once the Prince’s aircraft landed.
"Hey, I'm just happy when he eats." Rhodey mumbled and Clint rambled something in agreement, but Tony ignored them both.
Steve frowned. More riddles. He really didn’t like the Kat Queen. Goddess or no Goddess, it was pretty clear that she didn’t care about the plight of the Gata, who only existed because of choices she’d made.
“Get Ross on the phone.”  Tony tensed, feeling the echoing wariness in the others pressing against him. That had been far too easy.
“What King Mufasa over here is saying I think,” Clint pondered aloud, jostling the other tom playfully in the ribs. He didn't seem to notice any bad smell. “Is that you gotta be in the moment. You gotta find a way to tell Stark ‘Hey, I’m here and it’s you and me’. You know? Buy a house. Adopt a dog. Something that says you’re looking forward and not back.”
*~*~*
The door of the office swished open right on cue and Princess stepped inside. She was dressed in the same black skirt and jacket she reported for duty in most days, her intern badge a sleek silver bar pinned to her breast. Her hair was the only thing not perfectly polished about her – a wild riot of curls that would have put Merida to shame, that she’d unsuccessfully tried to strangle into a bun.
Harley rolled his eyes but there was an excited grin beginning to stretch his mouth.
Clint will always be 'Hawk' somewhere deep down, and Hawkeye is better than Spot or Fluffy (he's met some kats with some SHITTY names) but having a real name almost made him feel like a real person, and now that he's officially a resident of the United States with tags and a proper owner and everything, he can't just disappear. Not entirely. He existed somewhere and there's a record.
"It's good work Jay, don't be so hard on yourself." Tony admonished with a wink in the tom's direction but Luke was staring up at the holo-screen in deep concentration. "You okay there tom-kat? I'd call a medic, but you are the medic."
“Because they are the ambassadors and protectors of the future and thus beloved by all. Queen-Fels are seventy percent more likely to occur in lines started by other Queen-Fels and as Dora Milaje they are only free to mate where the Queen wills. Aranged marriages may seem antiquated to your western sensibilities, but political unions of this sort are a necessary function of maintaining balance and prosperity among the tribes. Thus when the young toms are selected by the leaders of their tribes, they go to my mother’s court in the Golden City with the understanding that they carry the hopes of the future with them.”
It wasn’t that he couldn’t be fooled because he totally could. He hasn’t got Natasha’s scary instincts, but he’s had to sail through a lot worse set up by much cleverer people than whoever set up tonight’s snatch and grab, and you develop a certain sense for when someone is trying to fuck you over.
Groaning softly Tony closed his eyes and huffed.
Natasha was preparing to depart on her mission when JARVIS asked her to hold take off because Tony was on his way up to the hangar.
"Can you?" he returned skeptically, eyeing the way her knee was turned.
“I’d like your help. Tomorrow. If you’re still willing.”
She’d never wanted to be Queen so early. Never like this. But lucky for them she’d learned from the best.
and began firing into the air, just as a shape, huge and black, came hurtling down from above. Even with the warning Tony didn’t have enough time to get completely out of the way. The man clipped Tony on his side, sending him spinning off balance and crashing into the floor with a painful clang. He was thankful he had the suit to break his fall and absorb most of the impact, but still. Ouch.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Tony?" Steve beseeched, eyes searching Tony's no doubt for some sort of sign  of where their earlier disagreement had left them.
When a tom penetrated a fel there were certain biological factors that had to be in play to result in kits.  When Tony’s father and Robert Stone had decided that fifteen-years-old was old enough for Tony to become a baby factory, it had been necessary to know everything he could about breeding and how to prevent it.
“Aye, volstag are particularly fond of mistletoe berries and chilled evergreen needles.” Thor added, grinning as Tony’s expression got more and more finished (as Jane liked to put it). “Here on Midgard there is no time a year for them like Yule.”
But Steve wasn't a kat, necessarily, and the expression on his face was the same kind of strained Bruce had glimpsed that afternoon and he wondered if the captain wasn't finding living in such close proximity to a group of kats hard to deal with.
He aimed for the female, because she was the one with the guns and because the male had already shown his tick. Sure enough, as soon as Tony opened fire at her, her companion jumped in front to deflect his shots – the surface of his shield crackling and warping as the two forms of energy collided. The shield absorbed energy Tony filed away, though he itched to know how.
They slowed, just as they had with Clint and this time Tony heard it when the female hissed out in her suit’s modulated voice, “Oh god damn it.”
His much-improved relationship with Tony showed itself best on the battlefield, where they couldn’t have been more in sync with one another. Steve would never have expected it, but it was the one place where Tony seemed happy to let somebody else take the reins. He was still Tony, he still teased and ran his mouth whenever the mood struck, but Steve could tell now when Tony was just yanking his chain to yank it and when he was truly trying to undermine his control as team leader. He’d seen plenty of that in the beginning and the contrast to now couldn’t have been plainer.
Time travel. Tony had never really put much thought into it because worm holes and dimensional rifts are not really his vice of choice and they’ve already got one Reed Richards (the galaxy can’t really handle a second) but right now he’s honestly considering giving it some real thought; because he’d like to hop into a time machine right about now and go back.
And it goes like that, from small to big to small again. Running from Brian and running from Howard. Playing in the park with Mama and reading to Becca with pride in the dark as she claps and calls them a regular Einstein.
Tony blinked in surprise and Steve forced himself not to squirm. Not many people knew that about him. Ma had always told Steve his father had died due to an old war injury when she thought he was too young to take the truth; and once he knew, well it wasn’t an easy thing to share with people.
"I understand that Mr. Coulson is your lover and perhaps as such he grants you a certain illusion of equality, but he is still your master. Isn't he?" The aide asked.
Swallowing back the threat of tears Nyota Stark rolled her shoulders and shook off the dark clouds casting a maudlin shadow over her mood. The feel of her curls brushing against her cheeks made her grimace.  With the sudden appearance of the Builders and the threat to that other earth, they’d been working non-stop on the portal device. She hadn’t had a proper wash day in way too long and it was starting to show. Scowling, she reached up to grasp a flyaway coil, tugging on it dispassionately and wrinkling her nose at the dry feel of it between her fingers before she let it spring loose.
Obadiah flashes through Tony’s mind in pictures, glossy and pristine like the pages of a magazine, only in full color. He’s soft eyes and hearty chuckles, tinkling crystal glasses filled with bright amber liquid and the acrid smell of cigar smoke.
“Keep dreaming Honeybunch.” He replied with a grin that looked as giddy as he felt and a faux flutter of his eyelashes.
Tony has been through many tutors but Herr Vonkov in particular is a nightmare. He is always caning Tony's bottom and coming up with humiliating punishments for his smart mouth.
promised, so it just looked like she’d have to drag his sorry ass back from the metaphorical grave and make sure that this time around he stood by his god damn word!
"This is the last time I’m going to ask.” Tony warned, speaking every word again with deliberation. “When did you know Ivan was alive?"
Whatever lame excuse Parker was going to drum up for being there died away in a gurgled yelp of surprise as he let go of the ceiling just a second before the place where he’d been suddenly exploded outward in a shower of plaster and dust.
(No you’re not. Stay with me. We’re in this together.)
Staring poignantly at the Wakandian Prince Ross popped a morsel of steak into his mouth and chewed with a smile, swallowing before finishing.
He’d felt the first wave of Heat not long after they’d returned to the tower. It had come on quick without repeating the usual build up, and had hit hard enough to make Tony fear for his life as his temperature spiked and extremis went into overdrive due to the adrenaline rush. Bruce had kind of freaked out because all their tests indicated that Tony would in fact go KABOOM if he didn’t limit the level of stress on his body, and Heats could be anywhere from a three to seven day event.
He’d agreed to join the initiative because it was the right thing, to help the Gata regain a measure of what had been stolen from them; but more selfishly, it was a way of saying what he’d never get to say to Bucky now. Your people are my people. Your fight is my fight. I’ll follow you to the end of all there is.
JARVIS responded with a touch resigned, “Right away Sir.”
At the shelter he was just Charlie and that was good enough, so long as he didn’t cause trouble. He hadn't even needed to lie that much. If he'd never been arrested he might very well have wandered off the street one day just the same way.
Extremis, recognizing them as foreign bodies, destroyed them almost as fast as they could create them so if this was to be a viable long term solution, the bots would need to be able to self duplicate.
“We don’t mean to snoop, Tony, or to imply that you can’t take care of yourself,” Bruce had insisted, tapping nervously against the handle of his coffee mug.
And that's how the next to godlike heroes of the Egyptians became household slaves. Over time they became popular pets for the wealthy but after some rich idiot got his wangle bitten off by an aggressive kitty, it was agreed that something had to be done to properly domesticate them.
“You never do small Stark.” Darren reached up to remove his trendy glasses, pinching the edge of his nose as if to stave off a headache and puffed out his cheeks like a chipmunk before releasing a slow heavy breath.
Tony could not concentrate. The particulars of the situation in Washington was unfolding in real time on time the haloscreen of the jet. JARVIS was valiantly trying to debrief the team before they dropped down over Diamond Row, the premier shopping complex of the nation’s capital, but Tony kept finding his attention pulled away from the moment by an increasingly loud sense of urgency that had nothing to do with protecting innocents from what sounded like a quickly escalating terrorist attack and everything to do with Bucky Barnes.
Steve had noticed when the others had gathered back at the tower to head out that each of his Gata teammates, by some unspoken agreement, seemed to have dressed that night to make some sort of statement.
“Right. Tony’s bodily organs are healthier than they probably ever have been, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t reason to worry. Extremis isn’t stable and it wasn’t designed with pregnancy in mind.”
Because Tony’s eager nose could smell it was right. Black, two dollops of the good cream and no sugar.
He could have done alright, just coming to terms with that, but then Tony had shared that memory with him, part of the dream he’d had on Asgard, and there was just no way that Steve could handle it and everything else at once. No way to explain to Tony what seeing that little boy had ripped open inside of him.
A quiet feminine giggle reminded Tony of the fact that he had an audience. Helen had raised herself up on her side and Bruce's eyes were open, blinking sleepily at him. Thor too, was just staring at him in amusement and it made Tony feel itchy.
He still remembered his first Christmas with Bucky. Steve's mom couldn't afford a big fancy tree, but the guy down at the lot had taken pity on them and given her one of the duds for a quarter of the price. It had been one of the trees that came off the trucks with twisted trunks and mangled branches.
Tony Stark has never held a lover in dark or light and heard the words ‘I love you’ but he was familiar with the idea that there is more than one way to say those three little words. And that right there… that sounded a lot like love to him. So this time, when the clawing want swelled up inside and stabbed him with need, he let it have him, surging forward to grab Steve by the collar of his shirt to demand his mouth. Steve seemed happy to give. Happy to let the heat take them both.
“Have we met?” he asked, though he already knew they hadn’t. The past week Steve had been introduced to a stream of celebrities, delegates, important military personnel, as well as all their feline companions, but he thought if he’d remember being introduced to this guy if they’d ever met. For one thing, he was military which was pretty rare for Gata. After the failed super soldier program and the accident that had created HULK, the army had pretty much given up on the idea of training Gata for combat.
Tony's heart is still in his hands when the other officer snatches Tony's journal from the hands of the young man who'd intervened before the thief had gotten away.
Tony doesn’t like to admit it (even to himself) but he was young enough once, that his mind didn’t terrify him. Young enough not to know the full extent of its power… or for that matter, it’s brokenness.
Mother? In his day it was mother but he had no idea what was considered correct these days and didn’t feel like opening up an argument with Tony if Mother was considered horribly offensive.
“He’ll think I deserved it. What if he’s angry with you?”
Since plan A wasn’t working out Tony went for plan B which was to blast the place where Barnes was standing the same way he’d blasted Loki.
Steve pulled Tony closer, and swayed with him to the music.
"Yeah..." He heaved a tired sigh. Why were emotions so fucking draining? "I have some things I want to run past you guys but, there's an us. Not like capital US yet, but I figure we needed little us before we could get big US anyway."
Besides, Tony would be terrible at leading a pride (just look at Cap's expression) and does anyone actually think that giving him kits is a good idea?
“I can give pretty good blowjobs to guys without a dick, too, you know?”
“I don´t know that word,” he answered quietly. His face still felt hot but at least he didn´t cry yet.
Tony would have preferred passing out over Steve´s eyes flickering to the collar and then back up to his face. He gagged for a second, trying to collect himself before he embarrassed himself even more. Panic was rising in his chest, he couldn´t breath, couldn´t think, just helplessly stare into Steve´s very blue, very concerned eyes.
The billionaire looked like he wanted to argue but closed his mouth instead to kiss his taller boyfriend.
“I´ll pick you up at your room at seven.” The billionaire looked away, almost shyly. “Please don´t embarrass me and wear something better than your usual cargo pants and t-shirt, Rogers!”
“Fuck you and your language!” He nearly screamed. “I wanted to make you happy! I didn´t want the world to know about...”
“I´m sorry, Tony.”
“I wouldn´t laugh about your feelings.”
Tony swallowed hard and forced himself to smile.
“I´m nervous,” Captain America confessed. “I have never kissed another man in public.”
Tony´s fingers grabbed his thigh, caressing him until they reached what was between his legs. When the fingertips brushed his vulva Steve couldn´t help but moan, his hips bucking up from the mattress.
When Tony knocked on the door Steve nearly tripped over his own feet before he managed to open the door to his room. Since they lived inside the same building Tony picking him up felt a bit weird but Tony looked so stunning Steve forgot about it almost immediately.
“Stop it, big guy. I´m glad I made you happy.”
“Dunno,” the billionaire answered. It was unusual to see him so shy, but Steve liked it. “I have to admit Thor looks pretty good, too- Ouch!”
Wham, there it was. Tony swallowed hard.
Tony´s hands looked so small compared to Steve´s own. He found it cute and couldn´t help but kiss his boyfriend over the table of the diner they found themselves in after a long day of preparation for the surgery in two days.
“Why didn´t you ask earlier?” It bothered Steve that they had taken so long to confess their mutual feelings.
“Thank you, Tony.”
Only one chapter left!
He felt Tony´s lips on his again a second later. Slowly he closed his eyes and allowed the billionaire to enter his mouth. Tony tasted like wine and cigarettes and so much more. His tongue gently played with Steve´s, his touches making the soldier relax. He could hardly stop a moan escaping him.
It still felt weird letting another man see him naked like that. Steve spread his legs, making himself vulnerable in a way he hadn´t experienced before.
“Tony!” Steve repeated. He was too shy to verbalize his need.
“Stay for dinner?” he asked. “Maybe we can have a glass of wine afterwards and watch a movie? There are still plenty on my list.”
“I´m not allowed to see it, yet. I bet it looks awful, not healed and anything.”
“I´m fine,” he texted his boyfriend and got a reply immediately.
“I just pulled an all-nighter. Nothing to worry about.”
And against the flood of questions that filled the room he said, “I, Steven Grant Rogers, am a trans-man. And I wish for every single trans-person in the world that they find a way to be themselves, just like I did.”
“I´d be on the news the second I show up at the clinic.”
Steve absentmindedly stared out of the window.
When he swung his legs out of the bed he noticed a pile of clothing next to the bed. A T-Shirt, work out pants, a hoodie and a towel. It wouldn´t fit him but Tony decided it was better than wearing his old, sweat and cum stained clothes.
Tony pressed the button to call the elevator. His eyes were so big and dark. The way he licked his lips would make Steve go insane for sure.
“Favorite soldier? You talking about me?” Steve mumbled into the dark hair while he was kissing Tony´s scalp.
That didn´t seem to stop Tony´s enthusiastic thoughts about being face-fucked by Captain America, though. He was about to describe in all details what his talented tongue was about to do to the Captain´s new dick when Steve crossed his arms in front of his chest and sighed.
Steve felt his arousal spark again. Heat was pooling in his lower body when he thought about Tony kneeled down in front of him. The billionaire smirked.
“Um...”
This morning, they made love and Steve loved every second of it. He loved their deep, filthy kisses, he loved the feeling of Tony thrusting into him, he loved blowing him later in the shower.
57 minutes later Tony landed in front of the apartment building Captain America was currently living in, a bag of freshly baked bagels in his right hand. He quickly made his way up the stairs. The floor only had to apartments, one without a name tag next to the door. Tony figured this must be it and knocked.
With a sudden spark of inspiration, Tony emptied his glass.
“Tony...!” he moaned. “I need more.”
Steve swallowed hard and tried to calm his racing heart down by some breathing techniques he learned during WW2. It wasn´t helping. Tony reached out for his hand and squeezed gently. He was only smiling for Steve´s sake, the soldier knew that and he was thankful for it.
“What´s on your mind, Cap?”
“Yeah, I know. I´ve read my father´s diary.”
“Tony,” he said, avoiding his gaze, “what is this?”
“Someone who was born female but now identifies as male,” Tony explained carefully.
Yay, I did it! Please let me know if you liked the fanfiction. Have a great day!
“You don´t.” Steve squeezed him lightly, still smiling. “I´m glad you´re here, Tony.”
When the Stark Tower appeared in sight Steve sat up straight again, clearing his throat.
“Thanks,” he said in a carefree tone of voice. Tony didn´t need to be the genius he was to notice Steve faked it. “You want anything with it? Coffee? Eggs? Cheese?”
“Will you be there when I wake up?” Steve asked and his heart skipped a beat when his tiny boyfriend nodded eagerly.
“I´m not a woman!”
“Ready to face the sharks?” the billionaire joked and kissed him on the lips.
“How do you feel, Cap?”
“How long would it take me to get there if we go really fast?”
“When´s the big day?” he asked, dipping a cookie into his mug.
“Eggs would be nice.” Tony carefully followed the Captain to the kitchen. Even though the apartment wasn´t that big it looked empty. Steve, who was a big man by all means, looked small in it, almost as if he was a stranger in his own house.
Well, this had sounded very differently in Tony´s imagination. He suddenly felt dumb, standing in Steve´s small hallway, looking absolutely debauched, wearing no underwear. If it hadn´t made the situation even worse, Tony might have giggled maniacally. He was an idiot. A complete idiot beyond any hope of saving.
The soldier choked on his coffee and started coughing. But he still smiled when he caught his breath again.
“Tony!” Steve could hardly stop himself from pulling his lover into a kiss. He wasn´t feeling confident enough for public affection just yet.
“If they see that I am a trans-man maybe they will find the confidence to be themselves, too. I remember hiding my desire to become a man too well. When Bucky told me it was fine and that he would support me I was incredibly happy. I want that for other people as well.”
He could feel Tony´s dick inside of him pulsing. He pulled the billionaire into a hug and kissed him deeply.
Steve smiled at himself, rested his head back on the pillow and waited until Tony entered the room in a hurry. The soldier laughed at the sight of his boyfriend.
“Oh,” Steve said, confusion showing clearly on his face. Steve had the opposite of a pokerface and if he hadn´t been Captain America Tony would have probably found that endearing. Who was he kidding? He absolutely found it endearing even though Steve was twice as heavy as himself and could punch through a tank.
He found Tony´s clothes in a pile on the ground but getting the billionaire dressed was tedious. It took minutes to get Tony to put on a jeans and a shirt with no underwear. Happy decided that this was good enough, he just wanted to leave and escape the eyes of the horny men gathered around.
Oh crap! He passed out in Steve´s apartment. Logic dictated that this must have been Steve´s bedroom. If there hadn´t been a burnt looking Captain America uniform hanging next to the wardrobe it could have been a random hotel room anywhere in the US. Tony looked around a little longer. There were no personal belongings other than the uniform, a pair of worn out Converse and a phone charger to be found.
“I´m....I´m not... I don´t have...” He stumbled upon the words. He had not had an outing in seventy years. Talking about as if it was something normal was hard.
The soldier nodded, just a slight bow of his head and the nurse was on her feet to help him immediately. When the pain finally subsided he closed his eyes again and tried to fall asleep. But he couldn´t stop smiling.
“You may not.” Tony was already on his way to the workshop. He only recently had developed a new suit that was designed specifically to travel large distances in very short amounts of time. The challenge of arriving in NYC before Steve had finished his morning run itched beneath his skin.
“Running, probably,” his AI offered as an answer. “It is half past six in New York City.”
Bruce blinking in confusion and staring between the two of them asked, "What wedding?"
He needed to win. That was the only way to protect other gata and protect the future he was trying to give them. And if he was going to win against these guys, he needed to be in his lab, creating tools to defeat them, not losing his head and tearing off on a suicide run.
Medical science was definitely not Tony's expertise, and Bruce kept reminding him he wasn't that kid of doctor either, but Tony always kept at least one spoon in the pot. As soon as the idea had taken root he'd called in a favor from an old friend, who'd been happy to share the work she'd been doing and critique theirs in order to fill in the gaps in their knowledge.
"I don't see why I can't make a corner jump if we're gonna allow that stupid rule that your king can jump two spaces just because you reached my side of the board twice, " Steve grumbled good naturedly, and just that was enough to make Tony smile despite the continuous buzzing of a headache in the back of his head.
He doesn’t like the Hamburg house. It isn’t like in Pola where Tony can have the run of the place, swimming in the cove, playing in the vineyards, exploring the ruins, or trekking through the city to his grandparent’s house for the day. There are too many rules in Hamburg, where most of his father’s friends and business associates live. Tony always must be on his best behavior in Hamburg and there are always a million parties at the house which means he has to either get dressed up and shown off, or stay up in his room all night.
“Who the hell is Bucky?” he grouches.
Everybody looked at her. The silence was thick with misery.
They were both there in the tower, but lately with everything they had going on, it was like they only really saw each other when they crashed into bed at night.
Anyway, whatever some alien cat lady got up to back in ancient whatever, had pretty much no bearing on the here and now so Tony liked to leave that little genetic mind trip to the guys like Bruce and just do his best not to hiss every time he sees that collar around Clint's neck.
“Not much of a choice is there.”
“And no pushing yourself to get out of bed and back to your lab before Helen and Bruce think you are ready. Unless there is another alien invasion, you must certainly not fly your armor. Promise me.” T’Challa gave Tony an insufferably knowing look and Tony could feel his hair raising in irritation and just hoped he didn’t look like a fluffball.
“Well that plan sucked. I –” the hit caught her mid rant and even though her suit absorbed a lot of the energy, there was still enough power behind it to send her toppling backward, right into a burst of webbing that tangled around her like fishing net.
Tony could also have said that he was familiar with the subtle differences in scent produced by ‘mixed’ breeds because he’d lived with the knowledge of his difference his whole life and still subconsciously searched for it in others, but that was a direction far heavier than he wanted to go and they still didn’t have the time.
“The reason you’re in here moping while Tony has been locked in his lab all morning. Is it good?” She asked, and Steve tensed at the slight squeeze of her hand.
If not for himself then for everybody else, then. Just because his memories have the potential to eat him alive doesn’t mean everybody else must be as sorry. Does it?
"So you do like getting your ears rubbed." Natasha noted with a smirk. "Noted."
There’s no getting around it.  You’ve gotta know. Okay, look. There was one other good thing about Tony’s childhood in Grandpa Town, and his name is Steve Rogers.
"What else?"
The fit the Board had thrown was the kind of epic that would likely never be seen again. They’d contested the will in a long drawn out legal battle, but Tony had poured every bit of the money he had into hiring a lawyer crazy enough to take on his case and sharp enough to win.
“JARVIS, appropriate theme music!” he called out, waiting in anticipation as the A.I. left him in a moment of judgmental silence. And then the tiny sounds of 90’s pop music began to fill the lab and Tony threw back his head and laughed.
Two years ago Jaime would have had some quick comeback and he probably would have laughed. Today he just got tight lipped, looking way too much like uncle Steve for her comfort as he crossed his arms and stared at her like he could see into her soul.
