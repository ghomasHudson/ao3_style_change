Ned sighs again. It’s obvious he doesn’t agree with Peter not telling any adults, but he doesn’t voice his opinion. He’d be loyal like he always has been.
True to his word, Steve doesn’t bring up the idea of having another baby. Losing their son was too unbearable. Tony can’t help but feel relieved but also even more guilty than he already felt. All Steve wanted was to be happy and have a child. And Tony ruined it. He took everything from Steve.
“What?” Tony pulls back quickly, his tone laced with worry. “I’m sorry. Was that too much?”
“No,” Bruce assures. “It might be a little cold though.”
Unless his dad came around…
“That’s exactly what it is. Just say the word and I’ll drive him somewhere else.”
Tony was the first person on the new list of people Steve felt he could trust. Pepper and Happy...he couldn’t say for sure. The omega seemed harmless and her scent didn’t give off any bad vibes, but Steve was still wary. The beta was another story. He had been against Steve the moment they met. Not that Steve could blame him. They were strangers.
Tony sighs harshly. “I don’t want to fight,” he says softly, taking Steve’s hand and bringing it up to his lips to kiss the soft skin. “I just thought you’d want to actually do this and not wait anymore. Are you afraid?”
“Sam,” Steve says into his comm. “I have the weapons secured.”
“Okay. I’ll take the couch.”
“I won’t hurt you,” Tony says again and he steps toward her, raising both hands up to show her that he wasn’t going to take her life like he had just done to the alphas. “I want my son. Tell me where he is.”
“About an hour,” Natasha replies, adjusting the baby in her arms and smiling when he emits a tiny whimper. “We got in early.”
But now after seeing the baby for the first time, he feels torn. The decision should be obvious. They were too young to be having a baby. They still had school and their whole lives ahead of them. Not to mention that they weren’t even a couple. They weren’t even friends.
“That’s okay.” Tony sits down beside Steve, his eyes immediately landing on their son. “We’ll figure it out.”
He makes it downstairs just as the jet is landing and the team is stepping out. Tony spots Bucky first, carrying a very wounded Cap on his shoulder. Tony rushes toward them, a look of worry crossing his face when he takes in the bloodied and bruised face of his husband.
Steve smiles and brings Tony back with him toward the bed. The back of his legs hit the edge of the bed and Steve lies back. Tony follows, crawling between his legs and connects their lips again. Steve pushes Tony away so that he can scoot up the bed and situate himself on top of the pillows.
The soft sound of snoring reaches Bucky’s ears and he glances up at the bed, finding Steve fast asleep.
The alpha’s hand dips lower, brushing under Steve’s shirt and running along his lower back. The band of his sweats is pulled back and that same hand continues its exploration. Steve’s eyes squeeze shut when rough fingers find his most intimate place, teasing a finger along the spot only Tony was allowed to touch.
Flash’s jaw tightens, along with the grip he has on the keys. He looks around the parking lot before settling his gaze back on Peter.
“You’d be too if you wanted to have sex and-forget it. I’m sorry. I’m just…”
Tony takes a moment to ponder it, and for a second Steve thinks he’ll agree with him. He doesn’t.
“I know. I’m sorry.”
“I know you and Sam are-”
“Did you-”
Steve steps in next to offer support, but Peter pushes him away too. Peter jumps off of the couch and runs out of the room and up the stairs. A door slams.
“Do you like it?” Tony asks into Steve’s ear.
“Already on it, sir,” Jarvis pipes up.
“Tony!” Pepper calls after him when he rushes out of the office and toward the elevators. She follows him. “Tony, what is going on?”
“Yeah. I think it had been too much for a first date if I’m being honest.”
“Get up,” the gruff voice of Rollins fills Steve’s ears. He remains still, unable to bring himself to comply with the command. He gets kicked again, this time a little harder. “Get. Up.”
Also...I’ve decided on who the father is. Any guesses 🤔
Tony clicks his tongue. “Great going, J. You scared the pups.”
“Do you think he listens?”
“How could we?” Tony reaches out to ruffle his son’s hair. “You’re the reason why we’re back together.”
“With Sam. Tony wasn’t the only one who took a few hits. Sam’s okay, though.”
“Of course you did,” Bucky snaps. “Did your dad tell you to do it?”
I’ll update soon! 😊❤️
“You can’t take on that project. You’re forced to rest too.”
“I never said you weren’t. But…” Steve carefully takes the mug from Tony’s hands, ignoring the death glare he receives in response. “Maybe cut back on this. It’s just for a few months.”
Steve gnaws nervously away at his bottom lip. Tony had a point. They were sleeping just down the hall and Jarvis was constantly on high alert. Peter would be safe. There were no more threats.
“Then Sam Junior?”
Then Steve is taking his hand and bringing it back, placing it directly over the bump. Tony’s breath gets caught in his throat at the feeling. His baby was right there.
But the damage was done and Peter had managed to sneak aboard the jet and hide out until he was sure the Avengers had landed. He didn’t even risk revealing himself. His plan was to hide out until the team left the jet, and then he would crawl out of his hiding space and try to help. And if it went well, then he'll reveal himself and everyone would be happy that he was there. And if it failed...well...there was hiding back on the jet and hoping they never noticed him.
The door to the bathroom is opening and Tony glances up, shooting Steve a small smile when he emerges, only for it to falter when he doesn’t receive one in return. He knew Steve was exhausted, but there was more than just a tired look in his eye.
“Submit,” Steve growls and with his free hand, uses it to hold the alpha’s head down. The alpha puts up a struggle and Steve responds by slamming Rollins’ head into the wall. He had only meant to do it once, but something courses through him, a strong energy shooting through his arm and forcing him to keep slamming the alpha’s head into the wall. He doesn’t even realize he’s screaming through it, all he cares about is hurting one of the bullies that’s picked on him.
“I guess we have something in common. I just hate that it’s this.”
He spends a little longer in the shower than he needs to. He’s careful when he scrubs the dirt and dried blood off of his body. He winces when he rubs over one of the larger bruises on his side. They’ll fade, just like they always do, but the pain would be everlasting.
During his first appointment, Steve finds himself alone. He had wanted his friends to tag along with him, but he kept it to himself, wanting to see what it really felt like going to these things alone and if he was capable of doing it. He wasn’t.
Then he picks up on another scent and his head snaps toward his right, finding an incubator and various machines around it. There’s a beta in a white lab coat standing near the machine and typing the readings into a tablet, but it’s not the beta scent that has captured his attention. His son is in the incubator, wires attached to his naked chest, connecting him to the beeping machines.
Bucky scoffs. “Yeah, because climbing on the walls and shooting webs is fine.”
“Damnit.” Tony curses to himself and leans back in his chair, scrubbing a hand over his face. His right leg is shaking, his whole body is buzzing. It didn’t help that he could still smell Steve on him. The omega’s scent was deliciously sweet. He wonders if it has anything to do with the pregnancy or if that was Steve’s natural scent. He tries to rid his mind of that thought when his cock stirs in interest.
“No,” Steve replies with a shake of his head. “She just fell asleep.”
“It’s not about me. It’s about you. It’s when you’re ready for us to do that again.”
He suddenly feels underdressed. The faded jeans and dark t-shirt doesn’t live up to their professional attire. But he was Tony, and that meant he did whatever he wanted.
“He almost tried to claim you,” Alpha says while shaking his head with disapproval. Those same cold fingers purposely linger over Steve’s neck, brushing against the one spot that should never be touched. Alpha grins when the omega flinches. “No one can touch you here. You belong to Hydra. You belong to me.”
“Love him? Sounds serious.”
Steve adds more lube to his cock and leads it to Tony’s prepared entrance. The head pushes through until it’s breaching Tony's hole. Steve groans from the feeling of having Tony wrapped around him, snug and warm. He wouldn’t have minded being the one fucked, but with Tony’s condition, this was how it was going to be for awhile.
He rarely saw Tony anymore. The genius was either down in his lab tweaking his own suits or the rest of the team’s, or he was out in the city taking care of his business. Steve understood that Tony couldn’t be around every second of every day, but when there was a time when they’d cross paths, Tony was distant.
“Steve?”
“Oh. Steve, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean…”
“Morning, gorgeous,” Tony greets.
“I know. I just want to do more. You always said these powers were a gift and I don’t want to waste them. The Avengers mean something to so many people and I guess I just want to be a part of that. I want to do something good,” Peter says.
“You want me to fuck you?” Tony asks, his fingers still deep inside Steve’s ass and thrusting, hitting his prostate with each thrust. Steve cries out and clenches down around Tony’s fingers. It wasn’t enough. He needed more. “You do, huh? Look how needy you are. You want my cock that bad?”
“Maybe James should be the ring bearer. Pete is probably too young. He’d probably run off with it. He tried to take it when I first showed him the ring.” Tony snorts at the memory.
“Hold on.” Steve holds up a hand to silence anymore rambling. “Your Uncle Buck has taken you to train?”
“The right partner.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “I’ve already made up my mind. I’m helping him.”
“Tony?” Steve gasps, eyes wide. He allows himself to go limp in front of the alpha. He submits like he knows how.
“You’re not the good guys.”
Peter only glares at her before rolling over onto his back and shutting his eyes.
“He seems depressed.”
They’re in the nursery now and Tony lays the items down on the changing table with a huff. Steve does the same before answering the question.
Tony smiles. “Works for me.”
“Yet.” Tony chuckles as he takes the car seat away to pack it up until they need it again. “Babies love to pull and chew on things. Dodger will be slobbered on, no doubt about it.”
He blames the serum. Maybe if he wasn’t some kind of experiment he’d be able to have a baby. The serum aided him in a lot of things, but it also had its side effects. This just happened to be one of them.
“Please come back,” Peter whispers. He doesn’t know how many times he murmured those three words. He had done it that night on the jet, and again all the other nights following. He’d probably be saying them for the rest of his life.
Peter nods and holds up a tiny finger to his mouth. “Shh.”
He loses the fight and finds himself drifting off. It’s not until someone is shaking his shoulder does Steve’s eyes shoot open with a gasp. One glance down shows his son on the verge of falling asleep.
Tony scoffs. “I’m worse.”
“Nothing!” Tony tries to defend himself. “We were having a great time. I let him stay over, we talked, watched some old videos and then…”
“I’m afraid that’s not the case.” Pierce waves his guard over and then Tony is forced down to his knees in front of Steve.
“Hey before that mishap I felt I was doing pretty great.”
“Yeah.” Tony winces and tries to stand up, only to collapse back down onto the floor. Steve scoots closer to him, glad to be back with his alpha.
Steve makes a face at that. He can’t imagine trying to care for a child that could turn invisible whenever he wanted. “I think I’d prefer it if he didn’t do that.”
Tony nods and tucks the letter in the front of his suit jacket. He slips his sunglasses back over his eyes and then makes his way up the last few steps and disappears through the front doors.
“Honey, I don’t know. Maybe you need to think it over some more,” Tony says and reaches for Steve’s hand. Steve slips his free.
“Next year? Honey, I already had to wait a year before I could even put that ring on your finger. Why do you want to wait?”
“But Tony-”
“He’s out.”
“That’s good. Morning sickness is different for everyone but if it gets too severe that’s when it becomes a problem.”
It’s her papa who comes home first with a sleepy Harley in his arms. Morgan expects her papa to come check on her after he puts her brother down for a nap, but he never does. He’s probably tired himself. It has to get exhausting being Captain America and a full-time father. He was always taking care of the world and his family; never himself.
“Don’t worry about it. I’ll take care of you and the baby. I promise.”
Tony takes a breath to calm himself.
Tony pulls off Steve’s lips and trails kisses along his jaw, down to his neck and kissing the mark he had put on Steve’s skin. The omega whines softly and bucks his hips, rubbing himself against his mate’s thigh.
“I hated myself. I hated
“Dad?” Morgan says quietly and steps further into the room. He doesn’t even stir. “Daddy?” She tries again and this time gently shakes his shoulder. That does the trick and he lets out a small groan.
Steve nods, unable to form any real words at the moment. He collapses beside his husband, completely spent. “That was amazing.”
“Deal.”
“Uh…” Flash turns to Peter, silently begging him to do something. Peter only shrugs. “I just found out so…I-I don’t know.”
Steve gives him one last look then he turns to leave.
“I know,” Steve turns his head in Tony’s direction, his eyes adjusting quickly to the darkness and making out his mate’s form. “I want us to try.”
“Let me go,” Peter tries to shrug the bully off. Flash’s entourage laugh and mock. Peter stares at Flash with pleading eyes, and to his surprise, Flash lets him go. He shoves him forward, but Peter’s fine with that. It could’ve been worse.
“If I could I’d have him in here, but I don’t think the doctor would be happy.”
Tony rolls his eyes. Here it goes again.
“Isn’t it? Tony, the signs were right there and I let my stubbornness get in the way and now...now I don’t even know how our son is.”
“Maybe I better go. I wasn’t expecting you to understand. I honestly never expected to see you again. I’m better off alone.”
Tony watches a little longer, attention transfixed on the person lying in his bed. The situation he’s found himself in has yet to fully sink in. The last thing he expected was to bump into this omega and learn he was going to be a father. But it’s not just the unexpected news that’s turned Tony’s world upside down. He finds himself yearning to be closer to Steve.
“Sort of.”
“You gonna tell him or should I?”
“I want to create comic books. I’ve always loved them so…”
“Four, three, two-”
“Because you deserve them,” Tony says, “and I’m gonna give you another. I can feed her and you go back to bed.”
“It was,” Steve admits. He reaches out with one hand to gently stroke Morgan’s cheek. “But it was worth it.”
Peter shrugs. “I don’t know. More about him I guess.”
They fall into a silence. Steve returns his gaze back to his son, watching intently as he nurses. He’s gentle when he decides to touch him, treating his son like he’s made of glass. He runs his hand up and down the baby’s back, freezing when his son squirms from the contact.
Tony pulls back when his son whimpers and he gently strokes Peter’s cheek lovingly. “Hi, Petey,” Tony smiles down at his son. “You’re safe now. You’re okay.”
“More!” Peter cries and stretches his arms out for the bag of chocolate. Tears are streaming down his face at this point, and Steve can’t help but feel bad. He wonders if he’s being too rough.
Tony huffs. “Yep. Do you feel better now? Is it out of your system?”
Natasha clicks her tongue. “And miss out on this little guy?”
“Please,” Peter whispers and releases another painful sob. “Please don’t leave me. Please wake up.”
“No, but I was thinking of offering,” Tony replies.
“It’s his kid, though,” Bucky says next. Despite being gone for weeks with SHIELD and before that brainwashed for years under Hydra’s control, he was catching on pretty quickly.
Tony lets out a sigh of defeat and takes the chair he was occupying earlier. Natasha takes the one beside him, and softly speaks to Morgan, smiling at her and whispering that everything was going to be okay. Tony needs to turn his head away, not wanting to show his friends the tears that have gathered in his eyes.
“Look!” The little boy points straight ahead, blue eyes full of excitement. He slips free from Peter’s grasp and takes off running toward the monument Peter knows is just a few feet away.
“Whoa, hang on. Just because I tolerate him doesn’t mean...you’re delusional. Must be from giving birth or something.”
“True. Okay, okay what about crying? I can’t deal with a crying kid. All they do is whine and complain.”
“Am I in trouble?” Peter asks, and his bottom lip juts out.
“I mean if you’re sure.”
Peter gives a small shrug in response. “It’s Friday. I’m just looking forward to the weekend.”
Steve nods his head slowly. “Yeah.”
“Alexander Pierce.”
“She’s mine. I deserve to keep her.”
Bucky continues to sob. “I should’ve done more. He’s gone because of me. Both of them are gone because of me.”
The team of security escort them inside the tower and toward the private elevators. James is the most curious about the new location, but also the most protective. He snarls and bares his tiny teeth to the guards whenever one of them gets too close to his siblings.
“But I felt him.”
“Yes,” Steve doesn’t even hesitate to reply. “I want to try again. I want this to work.”
“Is that why you ran away? Is that why he hurt you?”
“Indeed you do, sir. Though a bit of practice couldn’t hurt. Perhaps Mr. Rogers can mentor you.”
“We all feel like that. I’m sure Tony’s told you all of the times he’s had that same thought. I know I’ve had them.”
Steve sighs and reaches down to place his hand over Tony’s. “I know.”
Tony inhales sharply. “You don’t want to hear it.”
It was a mess. A mess that Steve was never going to get out of.
Harley and Sarah are little rays of sunshine. Well, when they want to be. Harley is rambunctious and curious, constantly getting into things he shouldn’t. Tony admires the pup’s observation. He knew the pups were smart, but there was something about Harley that he related to.
“Well you did say please. That’ll be our little secret too.”
“-it got me thinking. We should do something different. No candy or expensive gifts.”
The fifteen-year-old groans and pulls the blankets further over his head. He mumbles something Steve can’t decipher.
“Our son is getting bigger.”
Peter nods. “I forgave him for all that. I just want my dad.”
Sam rolls his eyes at the boasting, but he smiles at the reveal. Thor shows his excitement with a booming laugh and he rushes to hug Steve, making sure he doesn’t squeeze too hard. Bruce is given uneasy looks when he shows his own version of excitement. He promises he won’t turn green.
“So you’ll be Captain America forever and I guess I’ll be your...sidekick?” Peter asks, a little unsurely.
The rest of the night is restless for them both. Steve is getting up every few hours to vomit and Tony is there to take care of him. Eventually Steve catches a break and it’s a little past three by the time he’s drifting off to sleep.
“A present. What’s it look like?” Sam teases.
She reminds him of someone very special to him. The hair on her head is something she inherited from him, but it’s also a trait that was passed down from his own mother.
He should have known about the baby. The signs were there and yet he chose to ignore every single one of them, writing it off as stress from work or the break-up. It was his fault.
“Why won’t you let me help you? There’s other things you can try that won’t make you leave. Why can’t we try something else first?”
Steve huffs out a laugh. “Try boring. What’s up, sweetie?”
Tony sighs. “I guess this is gonna be harder than I thought.”
Steve is better the next time Tony visits. Morgan isn’t with him because she had a meltdown during the morning hours. She’s spending the day with Natasha, something Tony regrets the moment he tells Steve and catches the hurt expression on his husband’s face.
Tony rests both hands over Steve’s belly. “Maybe it’s him.”
“I know you miss him,” Tony tells his daughter. “I miss him too. But he’ll be back soon okay? I promise.”
“Honey,” Tony says cautiously, coming closer to try and help. Steve refuses to look up at him, instead keeping his head cast down and eyes locked on Morgan. “Steve-”
Steve finds the courage to peek, eyes landing on the two alphas. A third person appears, and much to Steve’s relief, he finds it’s not the head alpha, but another beta from Hydra’s lab. Usually their presence didn’t terrify the omega, but the ones that approached him didn’t usually have a syringe in their hands.
Tony pays attention to the way the omega’s body reacts. Steve’s breathing picks up, he grows tighter around Tony’s cock.
“Yeah and we did it all backwards blah blah.”
“Tony-”
Steve keeps his gaze locked on the screen, absorbing the image of his pup, memorizing the fluttering of its heartbeat. He wants nothing more than to protect this one. He had already made that promise.
He knows that voice. Tony turns his head toward the voice, finding Steve beside him. His mate smiles, tears rushing down his face now that their eyes are locked.
Tony smiles sadly. His husband was strong and overcame a lot in the past. But this time seemed different, this time he gave up the fight. He was broken.
It’s the sound of muffled voices that stirs Steve awake. He’s almost tempted to ignore the noise and go back to sleep. His body is drained from the hard labor and birth. He didn’t want to sleep for another sixty five years, but another hour or two wouldn’t hurt.
The sharp intake of air Steve takes puts Tony on edge.
Steve is making a lot of progress and I'm so happy for him. I still have some plans for these two and I can't wait for their happy ending :)
Steve grips the bottle tighter.
A sound from behind them captures Natasha’s attention and she pulls her gun out and whips around, ready to shoot any approaching threats. She lowers it when Bucky steps forward, his own gun raised. He does the same when he notices them, then he catches sight of the state his best friend is in and he rushes toward them.
I’ll do more fluff I promise!
“I’ve been better,” Steve says and he opens the door the rest of the way. He turns and walks away, leaving the door open, granting permission for Tony to enter and follow. “You were gone for a long time,” Steve states and takes his original spot on the bed. Tony can’t help but notice the array of pillows surrounding the omega. It must be a comfort.
Steve smiles and shakes his head. “Slow down there, Shellhead. You have a whole year.”
He knew he had options. A unplanned pregnancy wasn’t the end of the world. He could put the baby up for adoption, give them a good home with loving parents. He wasn’t fit to be a parent. He could barely take care of himself at times. If it wasn’t for his parents he’d be a mess.
“Before. You were acting so different and-”
Tony lets out a heavy sigh and runs a hand through his damp hair. He had already been at it for a few hours, and the progress he made so far was good, but not enough for him to cross it off the list and mark it as complete.
Steve hears the stool scrap against the floor and little feet make their way toward him. Small arms are wrapping around his waist, and that’s when Steve loses his composure. His whole body wracks with each sob he releases. The tears don’t stop.
“I have that meeting, remember?”
“If you’re training him then I know he will be. It’s a shame you’re leaving. You’re one of the best.”
“What? Steve, what’s wrong?” Tony comes closer, only to stop when Steve cries out and backs away. “Steve-”
With his glass now empty and the urge for another becoming too much to ignore, he steps away from the group and over toward the bar. While he waits, he leans against the counter and sighs. So much for enjoying the party.
“That dog is crazy.” Tony chuckles.
“Good news, sir?” Jarvis asks, the sound of his voice startling Tony.
Steve comes up behind him and wraps his arms around him, chuckling softly when Tony jumps slightly.
Morgan is screaming at the top of her lungs, her face scrunched up and bright pink from her discomfort. Steve is desperately trying to calm her down, failing miserably when Morgan only grows more frustrated.
“I don’t know,” Bucky responds. It’s not good enough. Tony needs a better answer than that. “Too many of them. He tried to hold them off.”
“Dad-”
Then silence.
Natasha nods and wipes the tears from her eyes. She rises to her feet and puts on a smile. It’s not very bright and the pain still clearly shows behind it.
“I knew I’d find you here. Enjoying yourself?” Pepper asks, almost as if she could read his mind. She was good at that.
“But that’s not our son,” Steve argues and adjusts the phone to balance between his chin and shoulder while he works on gathering the trash from the bathrooms.
“Don’t you want him to hang out with Ned?” Sam asks.
“This is still cool. I’ve never been in a penthouse before. I mean the compound was awesome but I never got to see anything else.”
“You feeling better?” Tony asks into the darkness. He feels Steve nod beside him. “Good. Just stay here from now on. I don’t like leaving you alone.”
Steve whimpers when Tony bites and sucks along his neck. He clenches tightly around Tony’s cock, the pressure sending jolts of pleasure through Tony. It’s been too long since they’ve fucked like this. The last time Tony remembers had been before the-
The pressure increases, stealing away his ability to breath. Steve’s head rolls to the side, more pleas spilling from his mouth.
Peter shifts uncomfortably again and forces himself to stare at his uncles. There’s a look of anger and disappointment from one and a confused and worried one from the other. Peter honestly hates both.
All of his time and energy went to his husband, nephew and friends. He’s beginning to wonder if this was how Steve felt. Steve was always setting aside his own feelings and time to care for everyone else. Especially his son. Peter was his whole world.
Steve gasps and his hips buck when Tony’s hand wraps around him, stroking the hard flesh from root to tip. With a groan, Steve throws his head back when an indescribable warmth surrounds his cock.
“I promised!” Steve’s voice raises slightly. He’s quick to realize what he’s done and his head whips in Morgan’s direction when she lets out a small whimper. He doesn’t try to comfort her.
It was wishful thinking.
Pepper glances up, frowning. “If you’re here to explain what all of that was-”
“Yeah.”
“Sounds fun.”
“Hey, kid,” Tony greets when Peter climbs into the car. “Good visit?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Steve wouldn’t have tolerated this,” Bucky grumbles and storms off toward the kitchen to get Alpine her dinner. She was now the spoiled one and getting whatever she wanted. Sam didn’t mind too much. He was just glad Bucky had a distraction.
Back before Tony and waking up in this new world, Steve never thought he’d get a chance to have a family of his own. His health conditions made it impossible to conceive, and even if he had been able to, he and the baby probably would’ve suffered. It was too risky.
Ned gasps and his eyes widen. “Are they mad! What happened?”
“‘M pushing.” Steve bears down again, grunting from the strain.
Alexander’s gaze doesn’t soften, nor does his grip on Steve. “I’m very disappointed in you, Omega. First you run away-again might I add- and now this. You need to know your place. Maybe a refresher will do you some good.”
“I-I don’t look the same. I’m so…”
“Night.” Peter smiles back.
“Me, either. It’s going to be okay. We’re going to get through this. Do you know why?”
“Pepper? Is she okay? Oh my God she probably thought you and I were…” Tony trails off.
Steve isn’t feeling any better by the time he’s on the jet and surrounded by his team. He doesn’t tell them about his fight with Tony, and he definitely doesn’t tell him about the mild cramping in his abdomen. They were only distractions that both himself and his teammates didn’t need.
“You did a lot,” Steve interrupts. “I don’t know what I would’ve done if you hadn’t been there. She’s here safely because of you.”
“Tony. Thank you.”
“They better not bite me,” Happy eyes Harley’s toothy grin anxiously.
It’s a little after 7 by the time the front door opens and her papa returns from his run. Morgan is ready to point out his tardiness, but the words get lost in her throat when she notices he’s not alone. Peter was with him.
“Oh. Sorry.” Steve goes to let go, only for Tony to bring his hand back and connect theirs again.
Tony frowns.
Pepper studies the screen. “Those don’t look like the emails I told you to respond to.”
“I know,” Steve nods. “I’m just...I can’t make you understand what he did.”
The alpha lowers her gun and orders her partner to do the same. Steve eyes the pair cautiously, growling again when the woman comes closer.
“What did it say?” Tony asks. Steve wishes he didn’t have to respond.
Tony works quickly to tuck himself back into his pants, not caring that his expensive suit is now stained and reeking of their mating.
“He’s coming back. I promise you okay? Papa is coming back. He loves you so much.”
Tony sighs and gives his son a kiss on the head. “You know we should talk-”
Maybe that’s how it should be. They were perfectly content where they were at. Why ruin something when it was going great?
It’s embarrassing and unusual for him to be acting like this. He does start to wonder if maybe Natasha was right. It wasn’t just her urging him to take a test or see a doctor. Tony would probably drag him down to medical if he could.
“Indeed I do, Sir. You arrived home at approximately 2:45 am.”
“I hope he can still watch the movie with me.”
“Hey, squirt, it’s okay,” Tony quickly assures, ignoring the wet spot on his pants. All he cares about is comforting the scared pup. “I’m not mad. Shit happens.”
“They’ll find him,” Bruce catches himself saying. He’s not sure if she’ll believe him. He doesn’t even believe himself. Tony was gone and there was no sign of his body or Steve’s or-
Tony sighs and asks Jarvis to bring up the last voicemail he ever received from Steve.
Steve smiles and brings Tony closer. “Dance with me.”
But he doesn’t want anything to go down. Maybe once upon a time he used to be that guy that partied a little too much, but those days were over. He had a son to think about. Even though his son was already nearing adulthood, Tony was still set on being there for him and providing for his every need. He was very late to that party, but better late than never.
Peter hopes this time around is different.
“Yep!” Peter nods his head excitedly. “We are all heroes!”
Two hands are gripping onto him tightly and spinning him around. He’s met again with the face of Brock Rumlow. The fear that was once written on his face is now gone. The smug grin plastered on it makes Steve’s stomach churn.
“I just have a feeling.”
“Milk and cookies.”
“And smile. I swear he smiled at me the other day.”
“No no, Happy, he’s fine. He’s-can you let him up. I asked him to come over.”
“It’s not that bad,” Steve tries to argue, pulling his hand away from Tony’s reach.
“Put that away, Tony,” Steve taps a single finger against the screen of the tablet. “It can wait.”
It hasn’t sunk in yet. Peter tells himself it’s all been a terrible nightmare and to end it he just needs to wake up, but he can’t. No matter how hard he tries, he’s left to suffer through the worst pain of his life. Nothing compared to the loss of his father, his hero.
“Prepared. I know. Tonight, though, I want you to relax. This our first night away from him-” Tony pauses when Steve makes a nervous noise. “-but it will be fine. He gets to stare at a new face and we get to enjoy a few hours of not changing dirty diapers.”
James nods his head and sniffs. Steve cries softly with him. James pulls back slightly and stares into the blue eyes that resemble his own, and with one tiny hand, stretches it out to touch Steve’s cheek.
“Look, Daddy!” Peter cries and runs over to where Tony is sitting. He throws himself on his daddy, giggling when strong arms wrap him in a hug.
“I’m sorry,” Peter whispers, then he swings out of the cemetery, leaving his dad alone in the rain.
“I have?” Peter tries to take the box, but Tony brings the box in and away from sticky fingers.
Tony’s mood immediately shifts the moment he sees how happy Steve is. It’s almost like Steve’s attitude was infectious.
“Okay.”
Toward her left, Bruce and Thor are sitting beside each other, both silent. Clint is hanging off the sofa beside Natasha, his hand on her shoulder. He squeezes it every few minutes. She’s grateful he’s here. She wouldn’t be able to function without him.
It’s difficult now to get him to latch on when Peter is so frustrated. His son’s attitude isn’t helping his own; in fact it’s overwhelming and Steve is wishing Tony was with him right now.
“Anyway, Nick needs me out sometime this week. I’ll let you know when.”
“He’s not coming home,” Bucky grumbles and shoves his phone in his husband’s face. Sam has to pull his head back slightly just to avoid being hit in the nose.
“Wait,” Steve places a hand on Tony’s chest and pushes him back. “I thought you were having the baby?”
Tony’s given up on sleep. The pressure in his belly was one of the most uncomfortable feelings. It prevented him from getting any rest. He can’t lie down anymore and Steve helps him into a sitting position. He leans forward, his hands resting on Steve’s shoulders for support and his head bowed to his chest. He breathes deeply through the intense pressure.
The party was meant to celebrate them winning and saving an innocent man from the torture Hydra put him through.
Natasha scowls, but Steve notices the smile tugging at her lips. “Fine!” She gives in easily. “But only because I love you.”
“Tony...fuck...fuck…”
“It sure seems like it does.”
“I’m fine with that. I always wondered what they were like. I never...well, you know the story. Yeah. Yeah I think we should do that.” Steve smiles and rubs at his belly. “I think he likes the idea too. He’s moving.”
“Petey,” Steve says, the nickname capturing his son’s attention. Peter smiles, showing off the couple of teeth that have come in. It never fails to put a smile on Steve’s face.
Tony groans in annoyance and with Steve’s help, rolls over onto his back. He keeps his eyes on the ceiling, face heating up when gloved fingers investigate his entrance. He’s glad he can’t feel her probing fingers.
“Just take it easy. I’m helping him out. Poor thing ran away from an abusive asshole.”
“Definitely. That’s not me anymore.”
“I love you,” Tony whispers. His eyes are full of tears again and now that he’s alone, he lets them fall freely and roll down his face. He reminds himself that Steve was alive, but seeing him lying motionless in a hospital bed is still difficult to witness. This never should’ve happened. “I’m so sorry. Steve, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
Steve moves through the corridor, sneaking up behind the enemies he stumbles across as quickly and quietly as he can. Discovering the room with the stolen weapons is the easy part, but taking down the guards is a different story. The fights never went as planned.
Steve awakes with a gasp.
“I’m going to call Bruce. Hopefully he gets here before Pete does.”
“J, please?” Tony whispers, “don’t.”
“I know, I know. You don’t need to apologize. If you need space then tell me. I can give you that if that’s what you need.”
“Hey.” Tony is the first to greet. “Morgan missed you. I think she’s waiting for goodnight cuddles.”
“Papa’s home!”
He tells himself to be in a better mood because today was his baby shower, but for the first time in his life he doesn’t find a party appealing. It wasn’t like he was able to drink and fully enjoy himself anyway. Having a baby really did come with a long list of don’ts. But he was doing this for Steve.
The next contraction washes over him, the intensity of it forcing Steve to double over. He holds onto Tony tightly, burying his face into his alpha’s neck and inhaling the familiar scent. He groans against Tony’s neck when the contraction worsens.
Peter takes another few seconds to gather himself, then he’s rushing back to the safety of the jet, excited to see the look on his papa’s face. He wonders if his papa would praise him for his bravery.
“You can sit down.” Tony makes a gesture toward the empty spot beside him. Now that Peter was asleep, it’s tempting to get a little shut eye himself.
“I’m gonna stop you there. We’re getting real close to talking about him being...God I can’t even say it.”
His eyes fall shut, and it’s not long before he’s falling fast asleep.
Peter forces a small smile. “Something like that.”
“I’m not…no no I’m not pregnant. Tony, I swear I’m not -ah!” Steve cries out abruptly, throwing his head back against the couch when the cramps start up again. They’re coming faster now and more intense than the ones before it.
“It’s hurting me too. I get it. I get not knowing what to do. But don’t end up like me. I didn’t cope well when I lost my parents. I did stupid shit, remember? You just have to find a way to move past this.”
Tony growls from the way Steve begs him. He moves faster, shoving the growing knot in and out of the omega’s stretched hole. Steve keens from the pleasure that shoots through him and he clenches down tightly on the knot.
Tony frowns. “Yes, thanks for reminding me. Some best friend.”
Steve’s body stills and his whimpering dies down. Tony keeps his arms around him. He can’t help but trail one hand down until it’s hovering over the small bump Steve keeps hidden under his clothes. He pulls back when he gets too close.
“Steve!”
“Can I...ask something?” Peter asks. Tony nods, though he’s nervous about the question on Peter’s mind. “How...I mean...I sort of know how you two met but I was wondering if...never mind.”
Tony focuses on that one spot, applying just the right amount of pressure until Steve’s cock is responding to his touch. It’s not long before he’s hard again and leaking precome at the tip.
“You’re so beautiful,” Steve whispers while he strokes a finger along Harley’s pink cheek.
“I just really want this to work.”
Steve of course wouldn’t know. He missed that decade.
“Are you gonna-”
It’s not the response Steve was hoping for. He wanted details. He wanted to know how his son was doing, if he was going to be okay.
Steve shakes his head vigorously and he whimpers. He scoots away again until his back hits the wall. He brings his knees up to his chest and wraps his arms around them.
“But I should’ve. I should’ve been able to stop them. To fight.”
“I know.” Tony’s voice is quiet. “Honey, I know.”
Morgan is placed back in Tony’s arms and Happy leaves to notify their friends of the newest arrival. Tony takes his original spot beside Steve, smiling when his husband curls up close.
“Oh my God. He’s-he’s going to find me. He’s going to-”
“Tony,” Steve warns.
“I don’t know but I think you need to be careful. You can’t trust people, Tony. And I know you feel sorry for him but...for all you know he could be a really good manipulator.”
“One more. Come on! Push!” Happy says, his voice full of excitement.
“I have one. Or a lot actually. He was always making sure I was happy. We used to play when I was a kid. I used to take his helmet and pretend to be Captain America. We’d run around the living room until he got tired or I was a brat and crawled up the walls.”
A grin appears over Tony’s face and Steve just knows Tony’s catching on. “You wanna fuck?”
“She has. I guess I just needed two of my friends to yell at me.”
“Yes, sir?”
Sam rolls his eyes again and shakes his head. “I’m not getting into this. I don’t need you to punch me again. The cat’s all yours.”
“I tell him that all the time,” Tony says.
“You were so drunk! Didn’t your parents get mad?”
That was better.
He breathes through the pain until the contraction ends and he’s able to relax again. He stands up straight, one hand finding his belly and rubbing the spot where his daughter was currently positioned.
Steve shakes his head and holds his son closer and away from her grasp. He couldn’t lose another.
“No, Ned,” Peter says harshly. “I’m not. He doesn’t need to know. No one does.”
“I know,” Steve says softly and lays his hand over Tony’s. “You’re not an asshole. Not all the time.”
“All done, little spider?” Natasha smirks.
When the pups wake up, Steve is already in the room to greet them and scent them. Sarah and Harley are calmer around him, whereas James is still hesitant and unsure. The little alpha doesn’t snarl or bare his teeth anymore, but he’s still cautious when it comes to his siblings. Steve assumes it had been James taking care of the younger pups when they were under Hydra’s care. It was a responsibility no pup his age should have. It makes Steve feel even more guilty.
Steve’s jaw tightens and he punches the bag a little harder. So what if he likes to imagine that he's hitting Tony’s stupid face? It helps him feel better.
Steve curls up closer to his alpha, inhaling the comforting scent. He’s lucky he gets to be this close and not have to worry about chains keeping him and Tony bound. The moment wouldn’t be for long and Steve tries to relish every second of it.
Steve smiles tiredly and rests his head back against the pillows, grateful Bucky had gone out to get the one from his apartment. Bucky really was a lifesaver. He was the greatest friend Steve could ever ask for.
“I’ve heard worse I’m sure.”
The SUV eventually pulls up to the entrance of the tower. Tony peers out the window and curses at what he finds.
He doesn’t want his friends to see him like this. They have already been worried about him since he started feeling off. His stomach churns at the thought of having to tell them the news, of having to tell
“Uh no he’s mom.” Tony corrects and points a finger in Steve’s direction. “I just got stuck with this part. No offense, honey.”
Judging by the surprised expression that appears over Bruce’s face Tony assumes Peter hadn’t told anyone what he’s been doing. Makes sense. Tony would be nervous too.
“It’s okay,” Tony assures his husband.
Bruce nods again and disappears from the room. Steve watches as they go, keeping his eyes glued to the door they stepped through. It was like he had been transported back in time. He’s just welcomed another pup into the world, only to have it taken away.
seen you cry before. Not like this.”
Steve always considered himself to have a high pain tolerance. He could take the daily beatings from bullies, and fighting off aliens and Hydra was manageable. But giving birth was a whole other story. The miracle of life was beautiful, but it was the most painful experience he’s ever been through. His pain levels were being put to the test.
“Well I’m pretty chill right now so maybe that helped. I honestly don’t know how I did it.”
Peter rushes out of the penthouse and down to the lab. Jarvis let’s him in as promised and Peter spots his dad hard at work. He stops when a familiar sound stands out amongst the noise his dad was producing. He’d know his papa’s voice anywhere.
Steve chuckles. “I’ll tell you. I’m alright, Buck.”
“It’s not fair.” Steve’s eyes fill with tears and he wipes at them angrily. “I wanted that baby. I wanted that baby so much.”
“You better not hurt him,” Bucky warns.
“I’m not scared, Daddy!” Peter cries and he rushes into the kitchen, throwing himself at Tony and giggling when he’s picked up.
But even with a new baby and her parents' insane jobs, life wasn’t too bad. It wasn’t until Peter turned 15 and his powers needed to be monitored closely did things start to change.
“I didn’t intend for this to happen. It was a mistake.”
Bruce immediately steps in. “How is he?”
Steve pulls away to properly look at the alpha. “It was very convincing.”
“What do you think?” Bucky asks.
“I’m over it. Are you hungry?” Happy gestures to the food.
“I’m scared. I know I’ve done this before but...it was different then. The doctors were cruel and...and Al-” Steve cuts himself off and buries his face back in the crook of Tony’s neck.
But now he was coming around.
“You shouldn’t be up. What happened to taking it easy?”
“Almost there, honey. You’re doing good.”
“No. I made sure-I swear he wasn’t in there. My memory is a little fuzzy.”
“It’s perfect! I don’t sleep.”
There was no denying the fact that they clashed over anything and everything. They shared more arguments and fights than they did kisses and hugs. The physical attraction was there, but everything else that came with a relationship was hard to achieve.
Thank you for reading! ❤️❤️❤️
“Yikes. No thanks. I hated getting up early then and I hate it now. I haven’t slept by the way, which explains why I’m here.”
“The worst. You scared the hell out of me. For a second I thought…”
“Don’t,” Steve warns. He doesn’t mean to lash out, but the anger is taking over. They should be able to have a family. They deserved one after everything they’ve been through. “I just really want this.”
“I guess.”
Peter frowns and plays with the cloth cape on one of his action figures. He makes it fly through the air, adding in his own flying sound effects. His attention is back on his papa again when Steve moves through the room in search of his helmet.
Tony is up bright and early. It’s no surprise considering that he hasn’t gotten much sleep since the whole ordeal with Pierce started. He’s constantly thinking about him and wishing Steve would open up more, fill him in. But Steve is still hesitant.
“What’s today?” Tony frowns in confusion.
“Yeah.” Steve nods and glances down to lock on Tony’s wandering hands. “Don’t try and wake him. For once he’s not pressing on my lungs and I can breathe.”
“We better get going,” Tony says and he grabs his car keys and wallet. “Hon, you ready?”
I’m so sorry! Life has been so crazy lately and then I had to get sick and ugh. It’s been a mess but I found some time to finally update. It’s nothing special and probably just a filler, but it’s better than nothing, right? Thank you guys so much for being patient and being awesome! I love you all! ❤️❤️❤️
“I know. We better talk to him. The last thing I need is that little punk sneaking out.”
“He can be a handful.”
“Don’t look at me,” Sam says. “I’m cool with whatever you want to do. It’ll be lonely now.”
“I miss him.”
The question has Flash spluttering out the water. Steve is out of his seat in seconds to grab a towel and Peter rushes to Flash’s side to help.
They eventually break apart. Steve doesn’t miss how shiny her eyes appear. He sends her a small smile, hoping it’s enough to reassure her.
Steve frowns. “You know everyone is going to give me hell for this, right?”
Steve gasps and his eyes shoot open. He sits up and looks around the dimly lit room, searching for his attacker. The room is empty. It had been another dream.
Both Happy and Peter share a look before Peter shrugs in response.
Tony pulls away, another sigh escaping him. “I want to keep kissing you and maybe a few other things, but this isn’t really how this part is supposed to go. I think you’re the only one I’ve fucked after a breakup.”
“We all did.” Steve hugs her next. “I’m sorry, sweetheart. We love you. Our family wouldn’t be the same without you.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“I’m not caving. I thought he was the good one but-”
Tony nods and lets go of Steve’s hand to reach up and wipe the tears that are still falling down his face.
“Hey, Pete. I didn’t know you were…” Bucky trails off and glances at his husband, searching for an explanation.
Steve only groans again and he hangs his head. The pain is worse, preventing him from forming any words. Happy must understand because he answers for him.
“I know it’s a lot,” Tony starts when he catches Steve’s wandering eyes. “But it’s better than the streets right? Or the place you came from.”
“She’s getting so big,” Steve says during another visit. He reaches out for her, smiling brightly when Tony grants him permission and passes Morgan to him. “Hi, sweetheart,” Steve coos. He gets one in response.
I’m feeling okay today so I got a chapter completed. It’s not very long and apologize. My brain is giving out ugh.
“Tony, relax-”
“Let’s do something simple,” Steve had to remind him again. “We can order in, watch a movie, have sex.”
Happy leans in close for a better look. “It’s nice. Tell me why you dragged me over here instead of gee I don’t know, Pepper?”
“Yeah.”
“You promise? I know how good you are with that shield.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony eventually cuts through the silence. “I know he gave up a lot.”
James eyes the baby and then slowly nods his head.
Those had been the only words Peter finds himself repeating over and over again in his head. He glances over at the bed where his Uncle Sam is lying, hoping and praying that he wakes up. His aunt assured him that he would, but Peter needed to be there to see it for himself. The last person he hoped would get up never did.
“You’re okay. You both are,” Tony assures.
Once the appointment is over and Tony gets his next one set up, they leave hand in hand with bright smiles on their faces. They were having a boy.
“Well...maybe Nat wouldn’t mind if we stayed out a little longer.”
“Do you want Happy to-”
Steve nods and curls up closer to Tony, resting his head on Tony’s chest. Tony keeps one arm wrapped around him, enjoying having him so close.
Tony works quickly at shedding his clothing and then positions himself between Steve’s spread legs. He trails a hand down to his cock and leads it to Steve’s entrance, teasing the pink rim before pressing inside.
“I figured you’ve had that before,” Tony says and Peter peers up at him. “I mean, he probably took you to Brooklyn, right?”
“Tell Happy we’ll be back soon,” Tony says.
I might rush through the wedding stuff because I want a certain kid to enter the picture already 😆
Tony narrows his eyes. “All I wanted was a cheeseburger.”
“Wait…” Ned frowns. Peter can practically see his friend trying to piece together the puzzle. He’s wearing the same expression he wears when trying to solve an equation.
“What the hell happened, Peter!”
“It’s okay,” Pepper assures the little pup, then she glances at Steve. “Unless…”
“-so that I and everyone else a part of this marvelous organization can set out what we want to do: change the world.”
“Bruce-”
“I promise.” Tony cups Steve’s face in his hands and smoothes his thumb over the tear that escapes. “I won’t let him hurt you. You’re safe with me.”
“Seven, six, five-”
Steve chokes back a sob. “T-Tony.”
Silence passes between them. Flash doesn’t even look at him, and instead he keeps his gaze down at the floor.
But that was all in the past now. Steve was in control now.
“Can it wait?” Steve decides to ask, hoping Tony thinks he’s just making an excuse because he’s exhausted. It’s not a complete lie. He just got home from the hospital. There was no way he had the energy to build a nursery right now.
He tries to force Tony out of his mind and focus on helping the omega’s that need him. But then he’s reminded of the little pack waiting for him back home, and their needs. Tony might be the alpha, but it wasn’t just his responsibility to care for their family. Steve had a role to play too, and right now he felt as if he wasn’t taking his job as seriously as he should.
Steve can’t help but miss the alpha. Even though he barely knew him and they weren’t mates, Steve still found a sense of comfort in him. Maybe it was because they were connected through the pup. Maybe it was because it had been Tony that took him in and gave him a place to sleep. Whatever the reason, Steve ached for his presence.
“You sure you’re not Clint’s kid?” Tony jokes, only to grimace at his own joke. “I take that back. Don’t tell Papa I said that okay?”
Tony hums in response and his eyes flutter shut, the exhaustion taking over. “Yeah. Congrats, honey.”
It should be Rogers. Stark shouldn’t even be on the table. Clint had been right about Tony being invisible. Everyone knew that Tony Stark wasn’t going to step up and care for his son, so why the hell should the baby take his last name?
Oof I told you there would be drama 😳 Poor Peter. All he wants is for his family to be whole again and it’s just falling apart. 😞
“Good because do you remember how shocking it was five years ago? I still think about it.”
“No, don't do that to him. He loves being Spider-Man and Harley loves-” Morgan pauses to glance down at her baby brother and ruffles his hair. “-he loves being spoiled.”
“Stop,” Sam tries to defuse his husband’s anger with a calm voice and a squeeze of his hand.
Tony digs the bottle out of the bag and hands it over to Natasha. She doesn’t complain about feeding him. The smile on her face proves she’s more than happy to spend some time with her nephew. She moves to the couch, carefully lowering herself down. Tony takes the spot next to her, letting out a heavy sigh and tipping his head over the back of the couch.
“With your help we believe we can achieve our mission. I’m only asking for a small donation-”
“I think I preferred the tower,” Bruce says as he sets up. He’s already instructed Steve to lie back on the steel table that’s temporarily serving as the exam bed. He’s brought a bag of his own equipment and he rummages through it in search of his gloves.
“I’ll be on the couch.”
“Yes! We weren’t careful.”
Tony works on cleaning up the kitchen and putting away the food. The abundance of food and takeout boxes reminds him of all the dinners he used to have with the team. No one could ever make a decision for dinner, leaving him no choice but to order from every restaurant in the city.
Steve grins and peers up at him again. “It was never an option.”
Steve turns away when he feels eyes on them and his face reddens again when he catches the doctor staring at them. The smile on her face is assuring, but Steve can’t help but feel embarrassed anyway.
Bruce nods in agreement and leans back in his seat, opening one of Steve’s books and skimming through it.
“My offer still stands. I know you need my scent. Here.” Tony begins to take off the sweatshirt and he hands it back to Steve, only to frown when the omega rejects it. “What’s wrong?”
They barely make it up the first couple of stairs before Steve is gasping and one hand flies to his belly. Sam whips around, worry etched on his face.
“Steve. Steve, calm down. What’s wrong?”
And poor Steve just can’t catch a break. How about a little more drama in the next chapter and then he can have a moment to relax? Sound good? Good!
He stops pacing when he hears someone at the door to the lab. He curses to himself when he realizes who it is.
“You can sit, you know.”
“He will. I’m sure he’ll be up soon okay?”
He was getting better now that he was away from his tormentors and in a safe place. There were still days, like the one today, where he questioned himself and his existence. But getting back to his old self was going to take time, and Tony promised he’d be there every step of the way.
The dog wags his tail, panting happily with its slobbery tongue hanging outside of its mouth. Tony grimaces at the mess the dog is making. “Cap, he’s...how do I put this lightly...gross. Yeah, smelly and gross. You gotta take him back.”
Steve is still asleep by the time Tony comes back upstairs. One peek in the room shows the omega passed out with the envelope resting over his belly. Tony smiles softly and steps into the room, careful not to disturb him.
Steve takes Tony’s hand and leads it to the spot where their newest addition was growing. “You ready to be a dad again?”
Steve’s eyes flutter open, a soft smile forming over his face. He wraps his arms around Tony’s neck and brings him closer, kissing and sucking on the sensitive skin.
Tony’s attention falls on the letter again and he snatches it up, ripping into it and taking out the letter inside. He slants back in his chair and begins reading.
They’re instructed to take a seat at the table, and both Steve and Tony gingerly lower themselves down in leather seats. Nick and Maria take the two seats on the opposite side of the table.
“She did!” Bucky tries to defend himself. “I’ve never heard her purr so much.”
“Don’t lie to me.”
Happy huffs and starts to drive again. They share a look through the mirror, a silent question being asked between them: was this a good idea?
“Damn I completely forgot. Sorry, baby. I’ll make it up to you.”
“You deserve a lot more. It’s a shame we couldn’t see eye to eye. Hydra needs someone like you on our side.”
“He’s okay. If he’s anything like you, then he’s going to be okay. Steve, don’t beat yourself up. You didn’t know.”
“Steve?” Tony rasps, hating how hoarse his voice sounds. He tries to sit up, only to wince and slump back down.
“Yeah,” Steve replies, though his answer appears forced. He’s aware of it too and he’s quick to offer assurance. “Just tired. And…” he glances down and gestures at his chest. “I don’t want to...leak again.”
“Can’t.”
Peter smiles down at the compass before closing it and holding it tight in his hand. Tony wraps an arm around him and pulls him close. He ignores the stares he receives.
There's still more to learn about Steve and Tony will remember some stuff. These two have a long road ahead of them.
“I can be home tonight. Work can wait.”
“They didn’t hurt him,” Natasha assures, “he’s safe now.”
“Can you go?” Steve asks, pulling Sam away, his voice low. “Take Nat and Buck.”
“I guess she just wanted you,” Tony says with a small shrug.
“That was close,” Ned says. “Maybe he’s catching on.”
Breakfast is quiet. Peter picks at his food, moving around the eggs with his fork until they’re on the opposite side of the plate. One glance around shows that he wasn’t the only one not hungry this morning. The only thing his uncle Sam had consumed was the coffee; his uncle Bucky hadn’t touched anything.
“I’ll see you I guess.” Tony frowns at his own words. “Sorry, I don’t know what I’m supposed to say here. Usually, the other person is pissed off and throwing things at me.”
The first thing he does after mingling is help himself to the food. He has no shame in loading one of the red paper plates with anything and everything. If anyone were to ask well...fuck them, he’s pregnant. He can eat whatever he wants.
Apparently that day was today. Steve knew the risks when he made the decision for them to go shopping for their son, but it wasn’t enough to keep him from enjoying this moment. They had a series of firsts ahead of them and baby shopping wasn’t being skipped.
The doctor sighs. “Steve,” he says, his voice calm. Nothing at all like the alphas Steve has had address him before. “There’s nothing for you to apologize for. Whatever happened in your past wasn’t your fault. You had no control.”
“Yeah, yeah I am. This place is-” Steve’s eyes wander around the room. “-it’s huge. I’m not used to living like this. The apartment I had in Brooklyn doesn’t compare.”
“Shh, it’s okay. It’s okay,” Tony soothes. He cradles Steve’s head and continues to hold him tightly against him.
“Yeah well this is...let’s start fresh tomorrow. I think we both need to...think things through. And no that’s not me blowing you off. We’re both nervous.”
Natasha grins. “So you’re the tough parent, huh?”
Not much is said while they wait for Bruce to come into the room. The nurse had been sweet and made Peter feel at ease, but the second she was gone and he knew the doctor would be seeing him next, all the uneasiness returned.
With a sigh, Tony loosens his tie and lets it hang around his neck. The first day back had been exhausting and there was still more work waiting for him in the morning. Pepper had done a phenomenal job keeping the company afloat during his spontaneous hiatus. Her hard work only pushed him closer to the idea of signing SI over.
“Off,” Tony mutters. More articles and videos flood the screen. “I said off!” Tony yells. The screens go black, leaving Tony to stare at his own broken reflection.
FRIDAY announces the arrival of the medics a few minutes later, and Steve and the baby are rushed to the nearest hospital. Tony never leaves their side.
His baby was gone. The life he and his husband created out of love was gone, stolen from them in an instant. It wasn’t fair.
He couldn’t keep her safe.
Tony doesn’t buy it, though and he crawls onto the bed and toward Steve. Fuck their break up. He was going to hold him until whatever it was that was bothering him went away.
“I don’t know what to say to him,” Tony says.
“No one’s coming for you,” Steve says. He walks around the alpha, satisfied that he has his abuser tied up and defenseless. “It’s just you and me.”
“What’s going on here?” Pepper demands. “Who the hell are you and why do you need to spy on me?”
“Hey! Watch your mouth,” Sam scolds.
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispers, tears gathering in his eyes. “Daddy’s sorry.”
I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to update! I got stuck because I wasn't sure what to write but after some help I figured it out. Thank you so much for being patient and I hope you all enjoy this update!
“Hmm?”
“But you need to think about yourself, sweetheart. Maybe this is what you need. A break, and I mean a
“And Tony?”
Peter keeps his gaze locked on Tony’s, brows furrowing slightly, almost as if he’s trying to figure out who’s speaking to him. Tony laughs at the expression on his son’s face.
“Sir?” The tone of FRIDAY’S voice is off. It’s alarming, making his stomach twist into uncomfortable knots.
“Just in time,” Tony says and Steve nods.
“Me either. It hurts, da-Mr. Stark. It hurts so bad. I just want someone to...to erase it all you know? I don’t want to feel like this anymore.”
Tony positions himself between Steve’s legs, laying a towel near him for the baby to eventually land on. The amount of blood he sees makes his own run cold. He’s seen Steve bloodied and bruised before, but this was different. This was more terrifying.
“Yeah.” Peter sighs.
It’s difficult for Steve to separate himself from his son when the baby is taken back for the night. All he wants to do is hold his baby and comfort him, but his body demands rest. Only sleep never comes. He's exhausted, but his mind hasn’t gotten the message and continues to plague Steve with various thoughts.
“You didn’t do anything.” Tony takes Steve’s hand, rubbing his knuckles with his thumb. “It’s not your fault.”
Steve goes into labor a couple of weeks later. Peter was earlier than expected. His stubborn attitude proved he was going to take after both of his parents. Tony still liked to joke that their son was more of a Rogers than a Stark. Steve didn’t find it funny. Perhaps because the joke wasn’t funny or because the omega was in labor. Tony figured the latter.
“I know. We’re almost there,” Tony says.
“Flash!” Peter sobs. “Flash Thompson!”
“Not that,” Tony shakes his head angrily. “I will not throw you away in-”
“What’s his middle name?”
Happy helps Steve into the front seat and throws the bag in the back, then he’s rushing to the driver’s side and climbing in. His head whips in Steve’s direction when Steve groans.
Tony rolls his eyes and turns around in his seat when a familiar scent wafts through the air. He’s not surprised to find his mate coming down the stairs; Steve knew the passcode and never hesitated to come down and spend time with Tony if he ever had the urge. Lately, he needed to be around the alpha more than usual.
The alpha continues to struggle, but Steve is stronger and faster, and in a matter of minutes he has Alexander Pierce strapped into the breeding bench.
Steve smiles softly and nods his head. “Okay. Nothing else matters.”
Tony still hates the idea.
“Come on.” Brock takes cautious steps toward the omega. “We won’t hurt you.”
“It’s real shitty for Tony to not want to be in his kid’s life,” Sam retorts.
“T-Tony…”
“Think of the baby.”
crap. Rhodey didn’t deserve this.
Peter continues to voice his displeasure, the sounds he produces rising in volume. The first thing Tony wants to do is panic. He reminds himself that he’s been able to get Peter calm in the past, but there was something about this time that has Tony doubting his abilities.
Steve doesn’t even wait to watch the jet take off. He usually stayed behind until the jet could no longer be seen, but as soon as it’s lifting off the ground, he turns around and takes Peter back inside.
“I think I want to live with you guys…”
The thought doesn’t leave him alone.
Steve rolls his eyes and mutters something that suspiciously sounds like ‘jerk.’ It’s not the worst thing Tony’s been called by his significant other, but the name calling still hurts.
Steve smiles and kisses Tony’s head again. “Get some sleep. You need to rest.”
“Is Nat watching him?” Steve asks.
He remembers the Iron Man and Avenger days vividly. Something bad always happened; there was barely a moment's peace. The look on Peter’s face takes him back to the days when bad things were happening all around him.
It’s the only explanation he can think of. But then he wonders if he’s done something else. He had been careful and made sure not to give himself away. He didn’t talk about the party, or Flash, or complain about any of his morning sickness. Maybe they didn’t know. Maybe-
“It’s a lot, yeah. But I’m happy to do this, and to be honest, a little scared. I don’t know what I’m doing either, but we’ll learn as we go. We’re not going to get this down in one night.”
“To who?” Sam’s eyes travel toward Peter.
“Yeah.” Steve nods, a smile forming over his face. He was still riding the high. He had never felt so at ease before.
The cover is worn out from years of use and the damage it sustained from the latest mission. It was too hard to look at it and all the images inside, so it was Peter’s decision to put it back where it belonged. He changes his mind now and flips through it, smiling at the sketches he finds.
Tony’s head snaps up at the familiar voice, finding Steve lingering in the doorway of the nursery. Steve steps into the room and comes closer. There’s some hesitation in his steps, almost as if he’s unsure of himself, but the sound of his crying baby is what brings him closer and stretching his arms out.
“And that’s why I have to do this. I’m not safe around her. What if I do something worse next time? What if...what if I hurt her, worse than I already have?”
But like Steve had feared, their quiet moment is ripped away from them the second the door unlocks. Steve tenses in response and whimpers against Tony’s neck, feeling the vibrations under the skin when the alpha growls in warning.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony sends her a small smile of reassurance before she turns and leaves. The door closes on her way out.
“I said I’ll go.”
“Okay.” Steve smiles and he gets to work.
“Sorry,” Steve apologizes. “They told me you were in here.”
Steve chuckles. “It’s embarrassing.”
“Yeah?” Tony smirks and Steve nods again.
“Uh-huh. How’s everything else?”
“Ouch. That hurts. Right here.” Tony pats against his chest and Steve chuckles. “Fine, fine. It’s better honestly. I’d hate for this kid to be named after me.”
There shouldn’t be that much doubt when it comes to Tony, but Steve can’t help the way that he feels. Tony had already proved that leaving was easy for him, and there was no telling if he’d do it again. Steve wanted nothing more than for Tony to come back and they picked up where they left off. No restart. They needed a do over.
Peter sighs again and runs a hand through his hair. Telling Flash was going to be difficult. Probably worse than telling his parents and Ned.
Steve glances down at his son’s face, eyes filling with tears when tiny dark ones stare up at him. He does as he’s told, giving the alpha his pup.
Tony shakes his head, refusing to listen to the AI’s words. He reaches for another glass, ready to fill it and chug down the alcohol until the world around him fades. But then a familiar voice fills the space and Tony lifts his head, almost regretting it when he’s met with an image of Steve.
Tony sighs harshly, and scrubs a hand along his face. “Steve-”
Tony isn’t in bed yet and Steve frowns when he finds him sitting on the edge and playing on his Stark pad.
“Try again. Since when are you giving up? I know you guys ended things but maybe one more shot wouldn’t hurt. Especially now that you have this little guy.” Bucky reaches over to mimic Steve and strokes the side of Peter’s face.
Tony rolls his eyes but doesn’t pass up the chance to get a break. God, he feels like an asshole for wanting one when Steve was in dire need of a break. He reminds himself that Steve was currently getting one and that maybe it was his turn for once. He hadn’t had a chance to get any coffee yet and his body was demanding the caffeine.
“No,” Steve says with a shake of his head. The pain was beginning to taper off. “I’m okay. It’s gone now.”
A faint smile forms over Steve’s face again and he squeezes Peter’s hand gently. “I believe in you. Do you remember what I taught you?”
He walks Happy out, and pulls him aside before he can load the jet.
“Tony, I am trying. You don’t think I want that, too? I just...I just don’t know how. How is the world going to look at me? Anyone who does happen to know who I am thinks I’m dead. Sometimes I think it’s just easier if we let them continue to think that.”
Peter peers up at his father, brown eyes full of confusion and curiosity. He glances down, deciding that his toys were more interesting. Peter babbles happily at his building blocks and tries to stick one in his mouth. But Steve is faster and he takes the block away.
“Tony, I’m sorry.”
“About time,” Sam teases. “I was wondering when you’d wake up and show off the kid.”
“I was told this wasn’t possible,” Steve says and he gazes down at the sleeping baby on his chest. “Him. He...he shouldn’t be possible.”
Tony smiles when Peter follows through with his promise and places kisses along his face.
He goes through the pages until he finds what he’s looking for. The picture is of Peter when he was no older than two and playing in the bathtub. A very wet and annoyed Steve is frowning up at the camera.
“Do you feel him now?”
“It’s yours. I’m already having a baby. You can have this one.”
“It’s okay,” Steve yawns and he sits up. “How was your meeting?”
“Don’t interrupt me!” Alpha yells, slamming his fist down on the table. The omega flinches. His facial expression softens. “I’m trying to take care of you,” he says, his voice softer this time. He moves closer to the table until he’s standing beside the omega, and he reaches out to cup Steve’s cheek. “You’re an important part of Hydra’s plan. You understand that, don’t you?”
“Yeah? Because if you ever need…”
“My sonogram pictures were a later stage,” Steve explains. “I was further along when I found out.”
“I-I don’t know what to do. I miss him so much.”
Steve winces. “Sor-” he catches himself. “I’ll work on it.”
“Aye aye, Captain. I’m gonna call you that from now on.”
“Is there anything I can do? I hate seeing you like this.”
“Really?” Peter’s face lights up and his eyes flicker in the direction of the Stark pad laying on the bench. “Can I see?”
“Tony-”
Tony chuckles. “Things have changed, Cap.”
“Hey, I won’t do that again. I swear I won’t abandon you.”
Peter yawns and his eyes fall shut. Tony gives him another kiss before leaving the room and shutting the light off on his way out.
Peter rushes back into the room, this time with Steve’s helmet on his head.
“You’re okay,” Tony assures. “It was just a dream.”
“Red!” Harley says.
Tony sighs harshly and reaches for the bottle of wine. “Way to go, Stark,” he grumbles to himself as he fills the glass. “Maybe next time.”
“The serum.” The words slip out of his mouth before he can even stop them. Bruce's head snaps up, showing off the deep wrinkles beginning to form over his brow.
“Tony, it’s not like that. And even if it was, it's something I need right now. Nothing else is working.”
“I’m sorry. I-I let him hurt you.”
Natasha scoffs but doesn’t reply.
“Just listen. You’re hurting. You told me some things, but I don’t think you’re being completely honest with me. I want you to talk to me, make me understand so I can fix this.”
“Thank you, Nat. He’s going to love it.”
“I’m sorry, Tony. That must’ve been hard.”
Tony listens to the message as he works on one of his suits. He hasn’t been in one for so long, having given up being Iron Man a long time ago. He could barely function outside of the suit. How could he function inside of it?
Everyone had been looking forward to the baby’s arrival. Tony wishes he had been too.
Sam sighs sadly and comes to stand behind his husband, wrapping his arms around his waist. “I know. But he needs his best friend.”
“I’ll be right back, Mr. Stark.” Natalie makes sure to send him another smile before leaving the office.
“Hey.” Tony steps further into the apartment, each step edging closer to Steve and their daughter. “How was the compound?”
Tony reaches out and gently wipes away the tears streaming down Steve’s face. “I...love you.”
When they break apart, they’re both crying. It’s Steve’s turn to wipe the tears from Tony’s eyes. He cups Tony’s face in his hands.
Peter moves faster. His stomach churns and he prays he doesn’t vomit. That would be mortifying and not the best first impression.
“Hey maybe tomorrow if you’re up to it we can go shopping. The kid’s gonna need more stuff,” Tony says.
“Of course,” Jarvis replies.
Steve continues, “Maybe one day you’ll get to see it for yourself. If you choose to. I’m not going to push you into being a father. I think I pushed enough. You left because of me, and I’m sorry. If you choose to stay wherever you are, I won’t hate you for it. I won’t tell our son that you’re a bad father...because you’re not.
“Let me try.” Bucky stretches out his arms and Steve passes Peter to him. Peter is not having any of it and continues to fuss, tears streaming down his cheeks and face turning red. Steve winces when the sounds Peter makes get louder. “Hey, Shh it’s okay,” Bucky soothes. “You’re okay, right? I don’t know what you’re crying for.”
Tony brings Morgan closer, softly shushing her and pressing a kiss to her head. She continues to cry, the sound getting harder and harder to hear.
He stumbles back, needing to put some distance between himself and the omega before he does something stupid. Only, he finds that he can’t move away. He wants to touch and kiss and fuck the omega. His body craves it. His alpha demands it.
A sob rips through his throat and he leans forward, resting his hands against the surface of the desk. He hangs his head between his shoulders and sobs.
“Anyway, so we were talking and they said I could live with you! Isn’t that awesome! I mean I’m sure they’ll want to talk to you since they’re my guardians but they’re willing to let me live with you all the time!”
“What am I going to do with you?”
Their son is tiny, barely fitting in Steve’s arms. Steve holds him close and is gentle when he brushes a finger over their son’s face. Dark wisps of hair cover the baby’s head. Tony hates how much the baby resembles him. It only makes the guilt that much worse.
Tony sighs and glances down at their hands. He smooths his thumb over Steve’s fingers, making sure to go over Steve’s ring finger a few times when a thought crosses his mind. He shouldn’t be thinking about marriage when they just agreed to taking their relationship slow, but he can’t help but picture a ring on Steve’s finger. Maybe they’d move away, settle down somewhere quiet and enjoy their new domestic life.
Hopefully Steve wouldn’t be too upset with him.
Steve emits a small sob at the sound, his own eyes flooding with tears and flowing down his face. He leans forward, stretching out his arms to hold his son. Tony gently passes their baby to Steve and grabs another towel, placing it over their son’s bare form.
“Yeah.” Steve nods, taking the empty spot on the couch. “Thank you for letting me sleep. I feel good today. Really good.”
Steve smiles and looks at his son again. “Worked like a charm.”
Peter grows quiet, his eyes slowly peeling open and connecting with Tony’s glistening ones. Tony brings his son closer, not caring that the baby was still sticky with blood. He was one of the most beautiful things Tony had ever seen.
The giddiness is back in an instant. The special occasion Tony was speaking of could only mean one thing. Steve doesn’t ask, knowing better than to question Tony’s plans.
“Bad, huh?” He asks and Steve nods. “Okay. Has your water broken?”
Rumlow returns back to his leader’s side, the pup held tightly in his arms. Steve glances toward his mate, whining softly, hoping he’d get some kind of response in return. He doesn’t.
“I don’t know,” Steve sighs and accepts the mug. He doesn’t drink from it. “Maybe? I know you wanted to get more stuff.”
“I don’t know. He’s been better.”
It starts off normal enough for Tony. He has a nine o’clock conference call in twenty minutes, followed by a meeting with the new group of interns. Same old same old. Nothing new.
Doctor Patterson nods. “Unfortunately you’ll have to deal with that a little longer. It gets easier. I promise.”
Steve nods and scrubs a hand along his face, doing his best to stifle a yawn that tries to escape, and failing miserably. Natasha chuckles again.
Flash sighs. “Fine. I’ll help, I guess.”
They don’t speak after that. Steve has fallen back asleep, curled up in Tony’s arms and his nose buried in his neck. He’s purring, the sound soft and appeasing to Tony’s alpha side.
“Hold on, Steve,” Bucky is saying, gripping his friends’ hand.
Upon entering the penthouse, Steve is greeted with the sight of red rose petals scattered around the floor and a trail of them leading up the stairs. Steve cocks a brow in confusion and turns to Tony for an explanation, only to get another smirk in response.
Tony prepares a pot of coffee and cleans up around the kitchen while he waits. The whole time his thoughts are swirling. He doesn’t have a clue as to how they’re supposed to tell their son that his sibling was gone. It wasn’t a conversation Tony pictured himself ever needing to have. They were supposed to have that baby and be happy.
“Don’t. Don’t say that. No one said this was gonna be easy, but we’ll stick together and figure it out as we go. It’s gonna be fine.”
“I got that part, Tony, but I meant the last couple of days! Why didn’t you answer me! You’re such an asshole!” She smacks him again, this time a little harder than before and he winces.
Steve’s stomach coils tightly as he and Tony follow the agent to her superior. Tony takes his hand, giving it a tender squeeze to help ease the omega’s nerves. Steve knows he shouldn’t be afraid, but he feels his fear is understandable. He didn’t do well with strangers. He had lost all trust in others.
At least Tony has Rhodey now. I know both Steve and Tony aren’t perfect and they both made some mistakes, but I love them both anyway.
Tony holds onto Steve while he cries. Steve clings to him tightly, fingers digging into the soft fabric of his shirt and staining it with his tears. Tony witnessed Steve cry before, but this time was different. He can finally see the pain and suffering Steve was battling on a daily basis, and it killed him inside. Steve was hurting and deep down Tony didn’t know how to help him.
Steve lowers his shield when the round of bullets stops. With his weapon out of ammo, the man turns quickly to retrieve another. Steve moves forward to disarm him, only to be too late and he’s roughly pushed backwards from the intense blast that's shot in his direction.
He knocks lightly on the door with one hand and the other hovers over the knob. He grips the cool brass, the voice in his head begging him to turn it.
“She’s fine. Nat’s taking her for the night.”
Tony can’t help but frown at his husband’s tone. Steve is still eyeing the clothes he’s laid out, almost as if he’s contemplating other options. He picks up the shirt and studies it for a moment before placing it back down with a sigh.
“I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, Tony. It’s all my fault.”
“Why so many?”
to calm him down. It not only worked on Peter, but Steve as well. Both were out like a light.
“Good. We missed you. Even the damn cat missed you,” Sam says.
“Maybe you should babysit,” Tony suggests, and he takes a sip from the mug, a content sigh leaving his lips from the comforting taste. “You always get her like this.”
That same hand travels lower until it’s resting over the leather collar still secured around the omega’s neck. It only takes a second to have it removed.
The Avengers had grown significantly over the years; their team was stronger now, more so than it’s ever been. It was the perfect time for Iron Man and Captain America to settle down and start a family. Of course there would still be days when the world needed them, but that’s when the support of their teammates came in. Natasha had offered to babysit whenever Steve and Tony needed a break from parenthood.
“Everything’s good,” Tony assures. He doesn't miss the relief expressions that cross over both Happy and Steve’s face.
“So…” Tony decides to be the first to break it. “Jarvis says you’re warming up.”
“Were they in the base?” Tony asks the two agents, his eyes not moving from the little family inside the room. Sarah is crying as the physician looks her over and Steve comforts her, no doubt scenting her like he’d do with Peter.
For the first time in a long time, Tony falls asleep in his bed. It’s warmer now that Steve’s in it.
“I’m not a threat to him either. Maybe it’s time you got that through your head. You’re supposed to be a genius.”
They're such a cute family. I had fun and will probably write more superfamily stuff. Who am I kidding? Of course I will! Thank you guys again!!!!
A small grunt reaches his ears and his head snaps up, eyes landing on the limp form across the room. He rushes toward his mate, and drops down beside him.
Peter sighs sadly. “Okay,” he says. Before he can give his brother back, he gives him another kiss. “I love you.”
A scene like this one has played out before. Peter remembered training with his papa and then finding out that he had to leave for an important mission. It had been his papa’s last mission.
“You didn’t,” Peter spats out angrily, “all you cared about was finishing first and then leaving me there like I meant nothing.”
While she waits, Morgan helps herself to a bowl of cereal and lounges in the living room with cartoons playing on the tv. She felt she was too old to be watching them but she can’t help but giggle from the quirkiness every now and then.
“He didn’t, Pete. He fought so hard. He fought for you.”
Steve forces himself not to think about the man who hurt him. He was gone. Hopefully for good this time.
Jarvis sighs heavily. “Mr. Stark is not going to be thrilled with you, Captain.”
“I’ll get another ice pack.” Tony moves from his spot beside Steve to leave the room.
Peter’s face heats up and he quickly glances down to hide his blush. “He’s not my boyfriend.”
“Yep.”
“There’s nothing to be scared about. Having a baby is supposed to be a good experience. Well, not this part, but it’s worth it at the end.”
Peter shakes his head. “It’s okay.”
Bruce holds up a hand to silence his nephew. “We don’t know yet. Just don’t move from that spot okay? Let the grownups take care of this.”
“Me too. And now we have another on the way. It’s crazy. You ready to do this again?” Tony asks.
“Please, Tony. Do something!” Steve fights with the cuffs again. He doesn’t want to be released, but he wants Tony to stop teasing and just fuck him already.
Both Bucky and Sam are a look. They know there’s more than what Peter is letting on, but they drop it for now. They had already almost lost him once and couldn’t risk it a second time.
Tony winces and mouths to Steve, ‘she is the only girl.’ Steve sighs and hugs his daughter closer.
Steve shakes his head and drinks more of his tea. Tony watches as he swallows the hot liquid. Perfect.
“And he promised he’d come back. He lied. And you lied too. Maybe it should have been you instead!”
Tony nods. “So he was married to his work?”
Yikes Tony lost his temper. Don’t worry he’s not a bad guy in this fic. He’s just upset but he’ll come around. Poor Peter needs all the love and support ❤️
“You almost died, jerk.” Bucky lowers himself down in the chair beside the bed and takes Sam’s hand, his thumb tracing the gold band on his finger. “Don’t ever do that shit again.”
Steve gasps in surprise when Tony’s lips are on his neck and trail kisses down toward his chest, stopping once he reaches Steve’s right nipple and licks around the pink bud. Steve’s back arches off the bed, the frame creaking when he pulls against the cuffs.
“I did yeah but she wants you. This is your time, remember?”
“Shh. Don’t apologize.”
“I just hope he’s okay.”
Steve frowns. “Let me guess, to apologize for being late?”
“You used to be Iron Man.”
Tony smiles, satisfied with Steve’s reaction. Though little words had been said, all of Steve’s appreciation and thanks was written on his face.
Tony takes longer than he needs to when it comes to saying goodbye to his son. Peter is alert, staring up at him with the eyes Tony can’t get enough of. If all goes well-he’s crossing his fingers that it does-he’d be back tomorrow and able to spend more time with Peter.
“You know you told me to listen to you and not that voice, but guess what, Tony? I am listening to you, and you’re starting to sound just like that voice.”
“Sit down,” Sam says again, his voice calmer. This time Bucky does and he takes his original seat. Alpine jumps back into his lap to resume their cuddles. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to snap.”
Peter nods. “My papa would take care of everyone but sometimes I took care of him. I helped the team when I could. I couldn’t fight the bad guys with them but at least I could help patch them back up.”
“But I need your help. You promised you’d be there if I ever needed you...and I need you now. Your weapons have gotten into the wrong hands...there’s a base in Siberia where they’re being traded; I need to shut it down, but I can’t do that without you. Take my place. Please, Tony. I’ll never ask for anything again.”
She gasps and her eyes widen. “Oh my God. Steve is that-”
The chance to properly discuss Steve’s plans for the future never happens. The jet would be landing soon and they needed to be ready. Steve promises they’ll sit down and talk later.
“Forget it. It was a joke.”
Steve tries to bite back the groan that builds in his throat when the alpha rubs him through his pants, only to fail and release the sound. The alpha smirks and continues to rub at the omega’s hardening cock. He ducks his head down to connect their lips again, then he’s pulling away and working Steve’s pants open.
“Yep. I mean, you’re on the run, right? And I can’t exactly be seen with you. It would just cause unwanted attention and I-you don’t need that right now.”
“Don’t fall asleep on me, Stark,” Steve teases.
It’s not just the two alphas that makes Steve comply. His mate is with them.
Peter cranes neck to get a better glimpse of his father, but with the amount of activity going on around him, it’s stolen and he’s left to sit alone, wondering about what’s happening.
Tony winces. “Sorry. I won’t. How’s the coffee by the way?”
Peter pulls away and quickly wipes at his tears. He glances down at the suit again, smiling brightly at the thought of getting to wear it and do what he was destined to do. He knows his papa would be proud.
“I’m pretty much done here,” Tony is already rising to his feet and sticking his phone back into his pocket.
“Okay. Is this why you left?”
“Yeah. I’m interested in meeting with a support group.”
“You finally strung together a few words, huh? Or did you ramble again?” Tony jokes and his son’s face heats up.
“I know what he did was...wrong, but this is Tony we’re talking about here. He did a lot for us.”
Steve brings his son closer and presses his lips to Harley’s head, allowing his lips to linger over the area. “I love you,” he whispers.
Steve grimaces and offers to take his son back. Bucky gives Peter a kiss on his head before handing him back to Steve.
Steve is hesitant when he’s forced to stay in the alpha’s private quarters. He’s only been allowed in the upper level a handful of times. Most of his days are spent locked away in his room until he’s forced to be bred or give birth again.
“Please?” Steve says softly. His eyes are still closed and his breathing has started to even out. Tony knows he’ll be out any minute now.
“That’s good.” Tony stands and makes his way toward the stairs, fingers still gripping the envelope tightly.
Peter heads into the living room and that’s where he finds his uncle Bucky. He’s sitting hunched over on the couch, crying. The sobs he makes are quiet, almost as if he didn’t want anyone to hear them.
Peter ignores the gentle bantering and turns toward the parked car, watching as his Uncle Bruce steps out and begins making his way over. Another car pulls up, and his Uncle Clint, Aunt Laura and his three cousins all get out, walking with Bruce.
“Yes you!”
Before Sam can answer, the door to his room is opening and Bucky is stepping through. He doesn’t look any better than the last time Peter had seen him. He still appears worried, and now angry.
The bump wasn’t very big yet and under clothing it was practically invisible, but Peter knew it was still there. He’s caught himself staring at his reflection longer than usual after showering or getting dressed. Pretty soon he wouldn’t be the only one noticing the bump. It was a terrifying thought.
“Good,” Tony rises to his feet and comes around the sofa to hug his son. Peter grips him tightly, and that’s when Tony feels his body trembling. “Hey, it’s okay, kid. He’s fine. Everything’s fine.”
“At least his reason makes sense,” Sam says. “Buck cried for 30 minutes because he felt Apline had a great day.”
“No problem.”
“I get a do over, right?” Peter asks. He doesn’t miss the way his aunt’s lips curve into a playful smirk. “That’s a no.”
Tony scoffs and stuffs his face with pancakes. Steve only chuckles at his behavior.
The scene that greets him is a completely different one from the one he saw playing out just a few hours ago. Steve is seated in the rocking chair with their daughter in his arms, this time more calm and collected than before. Tony steps further into the room, his presence capturing Steve’s attention and he glances up, offering Tony a tired smile. It’s the first smile he’s worn in days.
“We’re just…studying,” Peter says and Flash quickly nods his head.
They’re asked to step outside and wait. Tony is able to relax now and enjoy his drink without their presence.
Steve is immediately ambushed and greeted with hugs. He laughs and gives them each a kiss on the cheek. Tony makes his way over and picks Peter up so that he too can get a kiss from the omega.
Peter is still on the couch when Tony enters the living room. He turns away from the screen when he hears his daddy come on, dark eyes lighting up and a smile appearing over his face.
“How do you know?” Bucky clings to Sam tightly. His body trembles and Sam knows he’s struggling to keep it together. “Steve’s gone and Pete…”
Tony eases off, allowing Steve to take control. It was Steve who had the insecurities and Tony wanted him to be comfortable when they had sex.
“He’s-” Steve hisses. “-fine. I’m having some pain but-”
When he’s finished, he wipes his mouth with some toilet tissue and tosses it in the toilet and then flushes everything down. His stomach is still churning and the cramps haven’t gone away.
“It’s okay,” Tony assures with a smile. “You can do whatever you want to me.”
“Yeah. I wish I wasn’t. Then I wouldn’t have been forced to endure the things I did.”
“Tony, you’re not him,” Steve says again, keeping his voice calm. Something feels off. The person standing in front of him doesn’t resemble his husband. His Tony.
“Hey!” Tony pipes up with a frown. “What about me? I’m the one who suffered! Remember that?”
“Hey! It wasn’t just me wanting that,” Tony playfully jabs Steve in the chest.
There’s a sense of relief knowing that Steve was pulling through. He was a fighter, always has been and always will be. But that doesn’t change the fact that he had been ready to give up. It was out of character for him to surrender and accept that there wasn’t any other way. Steve had been knocked down in the past but he’s always gotten back up with raised fists. This time, he stayed down and kept his arms to his side.
“Yeah!” Peter nods in agreement.
It wasn’t just the fatigue and physical changes that were getting to him. He should be happy about the son he was given, and though a part of him is overjoyed with the idea of being a father, the other half is terrified and worried.
“Amazing. The last time we mated felt good too but this...I don’t even know how to describe it.”
Tony smiles and gently leans over their sleeping son to kiss the top of Steve’s head. “Okay.”
“Okay.” Steve gives in.
“Is he resting?” Doctor Patterson asks and she steps further into the room. Steve nods and sits up, groaning softly when his back pops. He can’t help but gasp suddenly when his middle twists uncomfortably. Concerned eyes fall on him. “Steve, are you alright?”
Steve huffs out a laugh and moves toward the bed, taking a seat on the edge and letting out a heavy sigh. He glances down in his arms, smiling when Morgan peers up at him to show off her own small smile.
Life didn’t work out that way. He lived the bachelor lifestyle for a while until he met Steve. Steve had changed him almost instantly. Falling in love and settling down never crossed Tony’s mind until he met the person he was supposed to do all of those things with. Steve was his everything.His whole life. He couldn’t imagine living in this world without him.
“Not a bad idea. We’re gonna need to do something while we’re here. Unless you like playing Monopoly.”
“I’ll try my best.” Steve promises.
“Sounds good to me.” Comes a familiar voice and Steve snaps his head up, finding Tony lingering in the doorway. Steve frowns at him.
“Why do you get up this early again?” Peter asks and he yawns.
The room is cold, nothing at all like the warm one he’s normally kept in. It’s smaller too and lacking any windows, the only bit of light he has is coming from the single light bulb hanging above him. It gives off an eerie glow.
Tony carefully removes the tie around Steve’s eyes, smiling now that he can stare into them again. “Hi.”
“Do you want to feel?” Steve asks. Tony is tempted to shake his head, but he forces himself to nod his head and Steve comes over, taking his hand and placing it over the bump. “It’s amazing, huh?”
Morgan nods. “When’s dad getting up?”
Once he’s alone, he can’t stop the sob that escapes him. He wraps his arms around himself for comfort, but it’s not enough. One hand finds its way to his neck, fingers touching the mark there. He wonders if it even means anything.
Tony returns a few minutes later with a beta man with dark, curly hair and glasses. Steve sniffs the air, finding comfort in the beta scent. He instantly relaxes.
“Don’t worry. You can make it up to me.”
Steve sighs again and glances down at his lap. “I don’t know. Some days are good, and then others are...they’re awful. It’s those days when sometimes I wish...sometimes I wish I never came out of the ice or that I died during that crash. It would have saved me from this.”
Tony increases his pace, plowing his fingers through the slick pouring from Steve’s body and filling the room with squelching sounds. Steve releases a small scream when he reaches his first orgasm. Tony watches in awe as Steve gushes around his fingers.
“You would’ve figured that out a hell of a lot sooner if SHIELD had found you first.”
I’m so sorry I’m taking forever to update! Work has been difficult. I hope everyone is doing good during these struggling times! Here is the next chapter 😊
“Relax, kiddo,” Tony assures. “It’ll be fine.”
Hey everyone! I’ve decided to try and finish my WIPs and this one was on the list. I’m trying to get inspiration for all of my work and sometimes it’s difficult for me. Thank you all for being so patient and supportive! I love you all!
This year would be the same. Steve wasn’t even going to acknowledge his birthday. He had to practically beg Tony not to do anything. In fact he suggested they set the baby shower for July 4th. He’d rather celebrate the birth of his son than his own.
“He does look like St-” Thor starts to say, only to be cut off when Bucky elbows him in the ribs.
“Relax. Your secret is safe with me. Everything here is confidential.”
“That is not why I marked you.” Tony can’t help the small snarl that escapes. His own emotions were rising, the anger quickly becoming something he knew he wouldn’t be able to control for long. “I did it because I love you. I wanted you. I wanted us to be together and raise our son.”
“Shit, Steve, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have-”
“He can stay with us…” Sam trails off and he sighs again. “Dammit, I don’t know. I guess we need to ask him who he wants to live with too.”
He works quickly to search the bodies for anything useful. He finds a knife on one and a security badge on another.
No couple was perfect. Tony knew this, but he couldn’t imagine trying again for the sake of their son just for them to fall apart and have Peter stuck in the middle. That wasn’t fair to him.
“He’s-he’s...how?”
“Be safe, Tony,” Steve tells him.
“I don’t know.”
MJ nods but doesn’t say anything. It only gets more awkward.
Steve sits down beside their daughter and leans down to kiss the top of her head. “I love you, sweetheart,” he whispers against her soft hair.
“How does it feel?” Tony’s still trailing his hands along Steve’s back to comfort him.
Peter smiles and turns to leave, only to rush back to his uncles and hug them, making sure to start with Bucky.
“I know.”
Steve is tempted to follow Tony’s lead and get some sleep, but he’s kept awake from the growing pain in his belly. The muscles contract tightly every few minutes it seems, each one getting stronger. Their duration has changed, and they’re no longer spread apart like they had been for most of the day. He wants to continue to shrug it off as nothing, but they’re becoming difficult to ignore.
Two people were missing from the festivities. His absence would always leave a hole. Nothing would be the same without him. All of the major holidays and birthdays would be different. Maybe in a few years the giant hole wouldn’t appear so big anymore. But for now it was huge, ready to swallow Peter up.
Bucky actually smiles. It’s small, barely even a hint of one, but Peter catches it. Sam does too and he reaches for his husband’s hand, giving it a gentle squeeze.
“Papa?” He whispers when his papa’s face appears on the large screen across from him. The video must be around Christmas. The tower is fully decorated in twinkling lights. But it’s the sight of his papa’s smiling face is that brings a smile to his own.
It takes a little longer than five minutes but soon the toys are picked up. Harley gathers the last bit of toys and rushes to his room to put them away. They’re probably scattered around his bedroom floor now but that was a problem for another day.
“I may or may not have thrown up before you got here,” Tony explains.
“Yeah. I wish he could see it,” Peter says, a hint of sadness seeping into his tone.
“For all we know it probably didn’t even work. I feel fi-”
Steve nods. “Yeah.”
Anger flashes across Peter’s face and he storms over to Tony, shoving him back. He follows after him and punches the armor.
“Good afternoon, Peter.”
It brings a smile to his own face.
Peter chuckles. “He won’t kill you.”
“The spare bedroom is open if-”
While Tony finishes dressing Peter, Steve gets a bag packed for him. He stuffs the diaper bag with items he’s sure his son was going to need. A couple hours may not seem like a lot of time, but anything could happen and Steve wanted to be prepared.
Tony watches the last conversation Peter and Steve shared. It’s nothing at all like the one he had with his parents. At least Peter got to say goodbye, and that he loved Steve. Tony regretted not being compassionate enough with his parents.
“No no. I just mean...did we? My mind has been...elsewhere.”
“I know you’re freaking out.”
“Relax,” Tony assures with a grin. “It looks good on you. A little small but...good. I just want you to feel comfortable.”
“Feel like it too,” Steve winces again. “I’m fine,” he quickly adds when he catches Tony’s lingering stare. “If it was bad I’d tell you. How many times have I come home like this?”
“We can’t wait. And you? You’re okay?”
They don’t separate after that. Steve doesn’t let her go, not even after the party has ended and they say goodbye to their friends. Tony wishes the party would have lasted a little longer, but they had the following day to start fresh with their friends by their side.
Steve falls asleep soon after that. Tony gently strokes along Steve’s face, then he leans in to place a kiss to Steve’s forehead.
“Okay give me...wait…”
“I’m not taking Dodger-”
“Just say whatever you want to say!” Tony nearly shouts. The amusement on her face doesn’t even disappear, it only grows until Tony can’t take looking at her anymore. He turns away, glancing at the entryway he had stepped through just moments before. He contemplates leaving, but then he’d be breaking his promise.
“I like it. I think she will, too. It’s one hell of a story we get to tell.”
“Tony, I’m being serious.”
Peter’s brows furrow I’m confusion. “Huh?”
“No, I mean about the-” Tony gestures to the picture. “How do you feel?”
The hard gaze Happy gives him is intimidating, but the omega doesn’t back down and cower. Eventually Happy’s eyes soften.
“I don’t think anything is going to be normal for a while,” Sam says.
“Okay, okay,” Tony chuckles. His gaze falls on his oldest, a sad sigh leaving him. James was so quiet. “James, come here.”
Steve runs a curious hand over the top of the sketch book Tony included with the supplies. It almost reminds him of the one he used to own, though this one was free from damage brought on from overuse and time. Steve was sure this one will one day receive the same treatment as his old book.
Tony had stopped complaining a long time ago, mostly due to the fact because he couldn’t feel any of the contractions anymore. He grumbled occasionally about being bored or wanting new scenery. Of course a change of scenery wasn’t going to happen, not when Tony was numb and unable to stand.
“Write him a letter,” Sam says randomly one morning during breakfast. It was well known that Steve’s method of telling Tony about the baby wasn’t cutting it. His friends probably felt sorry for him or thought he was an idiot. Maybe both. Steve definitely felt stupid for not being able to tell the father of his baby that well...he was going to be a father.
“I take it I did something wrong. You’re ignoring me.”
Tony feels Peter tense beside him. He wishes Clint didn’t have to do this now. Not when his son was present.
The other alpha huffs out a laugh. “You’re a very difficult man to find, Stark.”
“Why didn’t he?”
“Forget it. Next name.”
“T-Tony,” Steve whimpers.
Steve whimpers and turns his head, seeking out his alpha.
“We fight.”
Peter doesn’t go home right away. He swings by the cemetery to talk to his papa, staying longer than he means to. A part of him doesn’t even feel guilty about returning home later than he’s expected. Stopping by his papa’s grave and talking to him has become a routine for Peter. He can’t imagine skipping the best part of his day.
Steve huffs out a small laugh and adjusts himself into a sitting position. “I figured. How long have you been here?”
“How about we do something? Just the two of us?”
“T-Tony…”
“Oh? I’m sorry to hear that. What does that have to do with me?”
“I just want to make sure he’s okay,” Steve says after he gives in and carefully places Peter down in his crib. He remains by the crib, not wanting to walk away in case his son woke up and needed him.
Steve lies back and sets Peter down, watching as his son crawls around and over him, little giggles leaving his lips when Steve starts up a game of peekaboo. Peter makes his way to Steve’s face, sitting himself comfortably on his papa’s chest and reaching out with tiny hands to cover Steve’s eyes.
He’s been instructed to push and though he fights to hold off just until he knows where Steve was and if his husband was okay, he can’t hold back for long and his body goes against him, bearing down on its own.
Tony complies and begins thrusting roughly, punching out pleasured gasps from Steve’s lips. Steve brings Tony closer, wrapping his legs around his waist and burying his nose in the crook of Tony’s neck, inhaling the musky scent.
(See the end of the chapter for
“But the city-we’re already living there and-”
“T-Tony,” Steve whimpers against Tony’s throat. “It hurts. It really hurts.”
The elevator comes to a stop and the doors open. Bruce steps out first and Tony trails behind him, keeping some distance to avoid more questions.
“We’ll find one. Let’s go right now!”
“What?” Steve glances up from his untouched breakfast. The eggs and bacon weren’t appeasing that morning. His morning sickness was beginning to taper off now that he was closing in on his second trimester, but this morning he felt off. He blames another restless night.
Blue eyes are staring back at him. There’s a hint of arousal still in them, but Tony is able to make out something else. Fear.
Being away from each other was only for a few days, and then Tony would be returning and the loneliness he felt would disappear the moment he pulled Steve into his arms.
“Good.”
“Not as perfect as you,” Tony whispers and leans down to connect their lips again. He trails a hand between them, letting it settle just below Steve’s belly button. “I want another pup.”
With her down, he decides to reach out to Natasha, only to find out that she wasn’t available to babysit.
Tony sits behind his workbench, not making a sound or any form of movement. Even his music isn’t playing in the background; there’s only silence.
He needed to make a call.
It’s not until they’re at Peter’s locker does Ned shake his arm gently to get his attention. “It’s not about the ba-you know. Flash is coming.”
“Or a baby. The back room was meant for that, right?” Peter asks.
Tony had assured he’d take care of all the dirty diapers, but Steve wasn’t going to let him do all the work. Peter doesn’t fight him, not like he had during his first diaper change of the day. Tony of course had been there to step in and help when Steve became overwhelmed. Now though, he’s calm and confident that he’d have no more issues with his son.
“What? What’s wrong?” Happy’s tone is full of worry. “Is it the kid? Please tell me you’re not having this baby. Tony specifically said-”
“So what do you want to do?” Peter asks.
“Steve, something’s wrong-”
“Yeah. I think we’re capable of that, right? I know how stubborn you can be.”
“Don’t give up on me. Not now.”
“You don’t like being the center of attention? Dude, you’re Captain America. The spotlight is always going to be on you.”
“She wanted you,” Natasha says with a small smile. She sniffs and wipes at her eyes. “How is he?”
“I had...there was this alpha. We weren’t bonded. He...used me. Three of my pups…” Steve stops himself. He’s not making any sense.
Steve moves slowly toward his mate, planning his next words carefully. He had been where Tony stood, quietly struggling and not knowing how to talk about the issues he was dealing with. Tony had been so good to him then, and now it was Steve’s turn to comfort his mate.
“Uh huh sure. Next time I’ll get the coffee, how's that?”
Poor Peter 😔 Don’t worry Ned and his parents will find out soon. I’m still figuring out who the father is but I’m leaning toward one person 🤔 Anyway, I hope you all are enjoying this one 😊
Steve nods and takes his son’s hands. “Say bye-bye to Sam.”
Peter nods again and then races toward his room. Once he’s gone and out of earshot, Sam and Bucky share a look.
But at this moment he can’t bring himself to care about the smothering. Peter was scared and confused, and not sure what the hell he was supposed to do. He needed his papa.
“I know, bud. I’ll be back soon. You’ll be with Uncle Bucky. That’s good right?”
. Tony was the only alpha he felt safe with, the only one he knew he could trust.
“Don’t interrupt.”
“Yeah,” Tony eventually answers and comes closer, deciding to stay near the edge of the bed to avoid disrupting the little nest Steve has prepared. “Just working. Listen, I want to apologize. I never should’ve let him in.”
“Natasha,” the alpha says. “And if introductions are over then I need to see Steve.”
Tony finds Steve where he always is these days-curled up on the sofa with Peter snuggled up beside him. Tony smiles at the sight.
Oh Tony *sighs* He's trying. Poor thing still doesn't know the whole story, but we're getting there! I will update soon!
Steve takes a deep breath and blows it out. His free hand clenches and unclenches; Tony has never seen him so nervous.
Those three words make Tony’s heart flutter. He’s almost afraid to say them back, but he pushes the fear aside and smiles.
“Overreact in what way?”
“Sir, I’m sorry to interrupt-”
“Did you get the results?” Bruce asks. “I was a little confused when I never heard back.”
“I thought we said simple,” Steve says with a small sigh.
Pepper smiles softly and leans against Tony’s workbench. “I’ve never seen you like this before.”
The comment Peter had made replays in his head. Steve’s death was affecting him too. He didn’t show it to a lot of people, but he was dealing with the same pain and grief. Maybe not the same. Steve hadn’t been his parent. Steve was barely a friend. But Tony loved him. Tony loved him so much it hurt.
“They’ll let us know. Sit down.”
“Goodnight, baby,” Steve smiles softly down at Harley and presses a kiss to the top of his messy curls. Harley smiles and reaches up for Steve, wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck. “I love you.”
But that doesn’t stop Peter from trying to befriend the guy. They were going to be in each other’s lives, and a relationship was bound to form sooner or later. Maybe Peter would move in with his dad and-
Pepper rolls her eyes. “Not even a little. Seriously, Tony you need to stop this. The event was for you to shake a few hands and contribute to their cause. And instead you get drunk and sleep with the first person you find.”
He slips and Bucky quickly catches him. “Come on, pal, let’s get you inside.”
“Can’t exactly do this part,” Steve sniffs, then he’s directing his attention back to Morgan when she continues to cry. “Shh, it’s okay, baby,” he tries to soothe, but the tone is off; there’s nothing comforting about the way he says those words.
“You’ll figure it out. I think you’re doing great so far.”
“Then obviously it was bad. I guess I do have to punch this kid.”
Peter can only watch with amusement. He loved seeing his family like this again.
“It’s better than the couch!” Natasha calls out to them, chuckling when Sam flips her off. “I guess it’s break time,” she says and rises to her feet, stretching and yawning.
“Tony,” Bruce says, the tone of his voice bringing Tony’s attention back to him in an instant. “He’s not eating, and I heard you telling Natasha that he doesn’t care about-.”
“So you’ll come back...tomorrow?” Peter asks hopefully.
Peter grins and tears off the paper. He opens the box and peers inside, a small gasp leaving his lips at what he finds. He takes out a gold compass.
“But she’s so cute,” Peter coos. “I think you should keep her, Uncle Bucky.”
“How does it feel?” Sam asks.
Steve smiles and welcomes his son with open arms. He scoops Harley up and kisses his head. “Hi, sweetheart. Where’s daddy?”
The date goes better than expected. The restaurant was a nice Italian place with dim lighting, white table clothes, and soft music playing in the background. Tony orders their most expensive wine and Steve ignores it. He’s changed his mind and wants to be a little spoiled.
Happy is taken aback by those words, but the smile that appears over his face is proof that he was both interested and flattered to be offered such a role.
Natasha sighs sadly and reaches out a hand to wipe away the tears off her nephew’s face. “I don’t know what Tony did. If you don’t want to tell me then that’s fine. But don’t for a second blame yourself for what he did or anyone else. What’s happened isn’t your fault.”
“What?” Steve glances up when he feels Tony’s stares. “What?”
The alarm is piercing and the corridors are lit with an eerie red light. But Steve ignores it and pushes forward, determined now more than ever to regain his freedom. For years he had been abused, tormented, conditioned to obey every order Pierce gave. But Steve was done following his orders. Enough was enough.
“Mama!” He whines and holds out his hands.
“FRIDAY?” Steve starts to address the A.I. he knows is listening.“Can you-”
“Uh-oh. I think it’s time for you guys to go,” Sam says.
“Oh right.” Sam straightens up and wipes the sweat from his brow. “You did mention that...only a hundred times.”
“I don’t talk about him much,” Tony continues their conversation. “I don’t talk about either of them. They died when I was seventeen.”
That dream of one day working alongside the Avengers all seems like that...just a dream. He no longer has the motivation to have his own suit and his own place on the team. It was a fantasy.
“Sir, Captain Rogers is on his way. He’s having a little trouble with the baby.”
Steve frowns and takes a swig from his beer. “I figured that’s all this was.”
“I love you,” Steve whispers and presses a kiss to Tony’s head.
It’s not until he ventures further in does he pick up the soft sobs. Tony pushes the door of the nursery open, peering inside and finding it empty. He moves on to the master bedroom and that’s where he finds Steve.
Steve panics and pulls back quickly. He moves too fast, causing the water to spill from the glass and straight into Tony’s lap.
He reminds himself to ask FRIDAY to place another order.
The gun digging into Tony’s head is replaced with a sack, enveloping him in darkness. He struggles when strong arms are on him again and pushing him forward. A sharp pain radiates through his head and Tony falls limp.
Happy notices Peter and waves him over. He throws a hand over Flash’s shoulders, provoking an embarrassing squeak out of the teenager.
“I screwed everything up, Auntie Nat,” Peter sobs, clinging to his aunt tighter. He pulls away and sniffs again. “I thought I could be like him and-and keep us all together but I can’t do it. I can’t.”
“Who!” Tony demands, his face growing red. “What kid do I need to track down and pummel!”
“Uh-huh.” Steve closes his book and sets it down on the coffee table, then he curls up beside Tony. “I think I missed you more.”
“Sorry,” Steve apologizes.
“Is it working?”
Seeing the Winter Soldier walking toward him had to be one of the scariest experiences in Tony’s life. He’s faced a variety of bad guys in his lifetime, but never has he crossed the famous assassin. Truth be told he never wanted to. He had hoped he never would. But now he wasn’t so lucky.
“He’s with me.” Happy glances quickly in Steve’s direction, wincing when he notices his face contort in pain. “Just breathe,” he tells him.
He’s relieved when no one follows him and he’s alone. He paces outside of the room, one of his fingers finding their way into his mouth and he chews away at the nail. His son’s crying is easily picked up from his enhanced hearing and it brings another wave of tears. Steve squeezes his eyes shut and backs into the wall, digging the heels of his hands into his eyes.
Those had been Tony’s exact words.
The pain’s getting worse, making it impossible to do anything but stay where he is. He’s panicking, suddenly wishing Tony was with him or at least one of his teammates.
Maybe he could be a dad.
“I’m staying right here.”
“Okay. Do you think he’ll want to see?” Peter asks, raising the picture up.
He can’t hold back the tears anymore, and with a sob, he lets go and allows his emotions to take full control. He places his hand over the bronze shield, his body hunching forward and trembling with each sob.
Steve smiles softly. “It’s okay to be scared. I know I am.”
“Buck’s here? Where?” Steve glances around the space for his friend.
Revenge was finally his.
There’s a moment of hesitation from the AI. “Sir-”
He glances back at the awaiting faces of his team members and his husband. Bruce seems the most at ease, and probably the most thrilled to have Tony around again. It made sense. They instantly connected that day in the hellicarrier.
Bucky smiles and nods. “How is he?” He asks, gesturing with his chin.
But then Peter met Ned and it was the start of a beautiful friendship. Ned had come to Peter’s rescue, just like Bucky had come to Steve’s. Peter had found someone he’d have till the end of the line.
It’s Tony’s turn to chuckle. “I can’t believe you were born on this day.”
“Do you blame me? For how he is?”
“It’s good,” Sam says with a smile.
Peter is lying in the incubator, wires and plugs attached to him and the various machines around him. His little chest rises and falls steadily; the readings on the monitor look good.
But the new person he was to be introduced to was apparently someone Steve could trust. Tony had said so himself, and if he could trust Tony, then he could trust the doctor.
“Not much.” Happy sets his empty plate down on the coffee table and leans back in his seat with a sigh. “Just that you’re scared. And hey, I get it. I’d be too if I was in your situation.”
“You look like...well, you know what you look like. I think you’re better off going home. I can manage, Mr. Stark.”
“Yeah.” Nick agrees, and Steve notices the smile tugging at his lips. Peter was a favorite among nearly everyone he came across. He had won Nick over almost instantly. The Director never admitted how attached he was to the kid, but Steve knew Nick was growing soft.
Tony curses when he takes his eyes off the road and on the large numbers of the car stereo. He hadn’t meant to be late. The meeting ran a little longer than usual, but it was making a stop before home that made him late. It had meant to be a quick stop, but it somehow didn’t turn out that way.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” Peter mumbles and turns his head toward the window to hopefully avoid another painful conversation.
“This is it. I swear after this mission I’m done. Then it’s just you and me.”
“I know. How about we try again tomorrow or this weekend.”
“Me, too.”
Steve moans at the praise and the feeling of being full. Tony’s lips are on his again, kissing him sensually. He trails his lips down to Steve’s neck, kissing and sucking the sensitive flesh as he starts rocking into Steve.
A baby.
The audio starts again and Tony returns to work.
(See the end of the chapter for
They had another try at the simple life.
It takes Tony’s brain a second to catch up and realize Sam was talking about the mate he lost. He blames his delayed thinking on the hours he spent watching
“Nothing,” Steve answers.
“Wait, he dropped Morgan off?" Tony asks over his daughter's screams. "When? Why?”
The concern doesn’t last long in his mind and he quickly pushes it aside when Tony renters his thoughts.
“I think I’m ready for bed,” Steve says and he makes an attempt to get up. Tony rises to his feet to help him.
“Steve, it’s okay to be nervous,” Pepper says, “I can’t imagine how difficult this is for you. That’s why Tony and I working hard to come up with a story-”
He feels better now that he has two people on his side. He wants nothing more than for his dad to not be angry, but he understands if the anger takes a little longer to fizzle out.
“So good,” Tony praises as he places kisses along Steve’s jaw. “You did so good, Steve. You’re so perfect.”
(See the end of the chapter for
When it’s time for Tony and Morgan to go, Steve makes sure to hold their daughter close and make sure she knows how much he loves her.
“I just made up my mind. I want to live here. Please?”
Peter jumps up and down excitedly, and Dodger joins in by barking and chasing the little boy around playfully.
“I don’t love him.” Those were not the right words to say. The table falls silent and all eyes fall on Steve. He shifts uncomfortably under their gaze, and with a clear of his throat, pretends to be interested in his now cold breakfast.
Steve’s face heats up and he hides the blush by kissing Morgan’s head again.
Peter responds by hugging her tightly. “It’s okay. I miss him too. A lot.”
“I gotta go.”
“No.” Natasha shakes her head.
Brock strikes first. Steve is faster, dodging the attack and issuing one of his own. The alpha stumbles back and wipes at his lip, scoffing at the blood he finds on his fingers.
For once everything seemed right, but the project was still Nick’s priority. After two years of trial and tribulation, he was ready to give the world back what they had lost.
“Great.” Tony lets out a small grunt when he struggles with the other shoe. He finally gets it on and adjusted, then he’s rushing out of the room.
“Sorry. Force of habit.”
Peter grows silent again and uses his dad’s wounds as a distraction. Tony hisses when Peter begins cleaning the cut on his cheek.
He huffs at his appearance. Tony wouldn’t care about the little weight left over, he made sure to tell Steve everyday that he was beautiful. It was difficult to believe those words when Steve still battled with himself, but he was getting better.
“What was that for?” Tony asks.
“Not really,” Peter replies honestly. “I don’t feel so good.”
“Of course you will. When do you want me ready, darling?”
And now he had it and Tony was somehow supposed to be happy for him and move on. But he couldn’t. He wanted to call Steve up and beg for forgiveness, but what good would that do? Steve clearly moved on.
Tony takes a moment to think it over. He’s actually been thinking about trying again. Maybe having a baby wouldn’t be the end of the world like he thought. Maybe he wouldn’t be like Howard and instead be a wonderful father like Steve would say.
“I’m fine, Tony. Complete what needs to get done there and then come home.”
“Well not yet but-”
“I did-”
“That’s why you wanted this night to work out so bad, huh?”
She loved her older brother. Peter was only a few years older than her, but they still clashed from time to time. It was normal sibling stuff.
Tony turns away, deciding to get to know the man he decided to invite into his car. He never picked up strangers like this. Usually he was drunk and the stranger he met was someone he crossed paths with at a party and hoped to get lucky with.
“Butt now!” Tony points in the direction of the living room. Peter doesn’t even protest and rushes into the living room.
“Then why are you down here and not at your own party?” Sam asks.
Peter shakes his head. “He wouldn’t. He would want you here.”
Tony huffs out a laugh and takes another drink from the glass in his hand.
Two years later and the pain wasn’t as severe. The world had Captain America back, though not the Captain they remembered. Sam Wilson didn’t hesitate to take up the shield and fight for what was right. The Avengers had a leader and their team was no longer broken. Even Iron Man had decided to take his place among them.
Tony winces. “I guess. I’m sorry. I mean it. I won’t hurt you again. Not ever.”
“A little,” Steve admits. He gets this way before every mission. Leaving his son behind is difficult, and for a moment he contemplates staying back and letting his team handle the job. “I hate leaving him.”
“It’s fine. Can we eat now? Junior here is hungry.”
“Yes!” Steve practically shouts. The feeling of Tony’s fingers was too much. He was going to come again. “Fuck me!”
“Get up,” Steve whispers and pecks him on the lips.
“Tony, can you take Pete?” Steve asks and Tony immediately takes their youngest back into his arms.
Steve has to double check the results to make sure he wasn’t imagining it. But there it is, as clear as day. Pregnant. Tony was pregnant. They were having a baby.
That thought alone is enough to bring a small, hopeful smile to Steve’s face. He glances down at his belly, laying a hand over the small bump.
The video disappears and Tony peers up, relieved that Steve’s smiling face is now gone. But he still aches for it, despite the pain it puts him through. He wishes he could go back to those days when they were friends. He’d even take their worst days over not having Steve at all.
They decided to speak upstairs in Tony’s office.
“Good.” Tony seems pleased with that answer. He directs his attention back on his son. “Now, kiddo, let’s go find your costume.”
A hard kick to his side causes the omega to grunt and wrap his arms around himself to block another attack.
They would need a bigger home. Somewhere private and secluded, safe from any harm. Sure Hydra and Pierce were gone but there were other forms of danger in the world. Tony wanted his family safe.
This wasn’t love. This was far from it.
She picks up on his voice, and she throws the blankets off. She hasn’t missed him yet; he’s still drinking his morning coffee.
“It’s okay,” Steve assures, “she needs cuddles too.”
Steve chuckles. “I didn’t mean to dart out like that.”
“He was right.”
He had failed.
“I mean...no?”
“Do you want to talk about it?” Steve asks, rubbing his hand up and down James’ back.
“You ready for me?” Tony asks, his voice low. Steve whines in response and opens his legs even wider. “You’re so perfect, so beautiful.”
“Bye! Love you!” Peter says before he’s rushing out of the apartment.
“He’s so mad.”
“It’s fine...I think.”
Steve hadn't figured that part out either.
Peter expects Flash to tell him to fuck off, but instead he does the opposite. He nods his head.
“Steve!” Bucky calls out to his son, only to go ignored. He grumbles in annoyance, more so with the fact that he can’t chase after his son like he used to. The gentle kicks from inside his womb remind him of that.
“It’s not bad. Just...you won’t do it again, right? Leave and never come back?”
“I’m sorry,” Steve sobs. “I’m a monster.”
“Speak of the devil,” Tony says and quickly zips up his bag and slings it over his shoulder. “Come on.” He holds out a hand for Steve to take and he hoists the omega up to his feet.
“Look at me,” Tony urges and Steve’s eyes shoot open. He must’ve closed them. “You’re not with him anymore. You’re with me. You can do whatever you want, Steve. I want you to cum first. It’ll feel good. I promise.”
Tony takes the ring and slips it into his pocket.
Tony’s brow raises questionably. “Oh yeah? And what’s that?”
“Do what! Steve, listen to me. Whatever you’re thinking, whatever that voice is telling you to do, don’t listen. Just listen to me. Can you do that? Honey, I need you to say something.”
Tony smiles weakly. “He’s a...strong kid. Got it from his...mother…”
“I got you, sweetheart,” Tony promises and nibbles at the mark he put on Steve’s neck. The mark that symbolized their love for each other.
Seeing Steve again should have Tony excited. They hadn’t seen each other in over a decade. Often Tony imagined seeing Steve again and what their interaction might be like. He wondered if Steve would’ve given him the cold shoulder just like he had done. But Steve wasn’t like that.
“Sorry, Pete.” Steve sniffs and takes a deep breath to calm himself down. “I’m okay.”
“Care to explain to me how this happened?” Nick’s voice is tight and full of irritation.
Yay they made up and Peter has his suit. I have one more chapter planned for this story so I’ll be working on that and getting it up as soon as I can. It’s been a journey!
They gather back into the living room to eat. It’s not surprising when the space is filled with their laughter and playful bantering. It reminds Peter of all the times when they’d gather like this. He misses it.
Tony sighs again and turns toward Pepper. “Can you give us a minute? Maybe ten?”
They’re left panting and pressed together. Tony lays his head down on Steve’s chest, finding comfort in the soft beating of his heart. Steve smiles and buries his fingers in Tony’s damp hair, massaging his scalp. It was something Tony enjoyed after sex.
Peter eventually calms down enough for Tony to resume his other projects. Peter doesn’t offer to help like he normally does, instead he sits quietly beside Tony and watches him work. Tony decided to bring out the designs for his son’s suit in hopes of cheering him up.
That voice tries to taunt him, mocking him when he smiles proudly at the dinner he’s worked hard on. He tunes the voice out. Everything had to be perfect.
“Don’t. Just go away.”
“I’m not a stalker!” Peter tries to defend himself, but goes ignored by the two adults.
“No. It’s something else.”
“I guess...I guess I don’t know how you can love me. Look what I’ve done, Tony. Look at the horrible things I’ve done to you and...and our daughter.” Tears are streaming down Steve’s face now. Tony doesn’t understand how in such a short amount of time Steve went from happy to this.
Damn it.
“Are you?” Steve questions. “It’s a girl.”
Steve smiles shyly. “I guess I did leave an impression.”
“Yeah. Didn’t you hear? Steve and I have a kid. A kid he didn’t tell me about. And yeah maybe I should’ve picked up the fucking phone and called him back. I regret that, I do, but he should’ve done more. I’m done blaming myself for all this shit.”
Steve laughs. “Nothing like that this time. I was thinking pizza.”
“I don’t know if I could ever take your place,” Peter tells the painting, pretending that his father is standing in front of him. “I’m not...you. I want to be, but...no one can ever be you. I’ll be Spider-Man...one day.
Sam clears his throat.
“But I can help! I can-”
All of the hardships and pain that it took to get to this moment had been worth it. His family had been worth the struggle and the fight. He would continue to fight for them.
Tony shakes his head and gladly takes Peter into his arms. Peter hugs the older alpha close, nosing around Tony’s neck in search of his scent gland. The tears dry up once he’s found it and he purrs softly against Tony’s skin.
“I was going to say protective but whatever. I just want you to be safe.”
Tony keeps himself pressed up against the omega, chasing after his release. He forces his knot inside, grunting as he comes undone, spilling his hot seed into the omega’s fertile womb. His alpha side is pleased.
“I love you more,” Steve whispers back.
The alpha yanks Steve to his feet, ignoring the painful whimpers the omega emits. Steve looks around the room, his heart sinking when he realizes Tony wasn’t back yet. He can only pray that Tony was okay.
“Yeah, kid,” Tony nods, “just one.”
His belly tightens, forcing a groan past Steve’s lips. He breathes through the contraction, bearing down when he needs to. It only takes a few pushes to pass the after birth. He ignores the mess between his legs, too engrossed in his daughter’s presence to pay it any mind.
“You’re thinking too hard,” Tony mumbles.
“You okay?” Tony mumbles besides him. His eyes are open and Steve wonders how long he’s been watching him.
“I hate to be the bearer of bad news but...pregnancy isn’t easy.”
“I don’t get it. You wanted to get to know him and-and have a relationship and you didn’t. Why? I know you said you were scared but...that’s not good enough.”
“Uncle Sam.”
“‘M fine. Sorry. I just need to-”
Steve huffs out a small laugh. “I didn’t. The book was helpful to me so maybe it will be helpful for you.”
Steve smiles. “Yes you are.”
“Tony?” Happy quickly answers the call.
“Uh yeah, kiddo. Just give me a minute okay? I have to help papa with something,” Tony replies, hating how broken his voice sounds. It’s obvious Peter has picked up on the saddened tone.
“Tony-”
“I don’t want to talk about this anymore.”
“Only because you’re so damn good at calming them. I’ll take the next one I swear.”
“I’m sorry, Papa. I’m so sorry. I need you.”
“He-it was him.”
“Yeah.” Steve is still in shock. For years he had been trained to never fight and to always comply. “I guess I did.”
“He comes by when he can. We do father son stuff.”
Steve can’t conceal the moan that escapes him when Tony enters him. Tony voices his own pleasure above him and slides in all the way.
A small, weak smile forms on Steve’s face. “You’re better.”
Perhaps too slow. The alpha in him was demanding Tony throw out their plans to wait and mate with the omega, but he fights the urge. He was out of bed before Steve could even wake and he rushed downstairs to hide away. He didn’t trust himself to do something stupid, and he promised he’d never hurt Steve like that again.
“Huh.” Tony can’t help but frown. Natasha wasn’t one to call frequently. Usually her random calls were due to an emergency. “Put her through.”
It’s all a lie. Steve was far from okay. Tony didn’t even know half of the pain his husband was going through. All he wanted was for Steve to open up to him, let him in and express what he was feeling. Tony was doing everything he could to help, but it was impossible to do when he was left in the dark.
Pepper comes closer and Steve can’t help but flinch when she lays a hand over his shoulder. He had expected Tony to come rushing after him but it was nice having another omega around.
They’re surrounded in silence after that, and it’s not until Steve glances down does he realize why. Tony is fast asleep, his mouth slightly open and softly snoring. Steve pulls the blankets up around them, making sure Tony is comfortable.
“Because he was worried about Steve! Maybe we should’ve listened to him!”
“Um...y-yeah. I’ve had it for a while.”
He’s still denied access.
“You’ve been awake all along?” Tony tsks and shakes his head. “You’ll never get to sleep again after this and you wasted it on me.”
“Yeah. Just been sitting for too long I guess.” Steve forces a fake smile.
Tony smiles and lays his head over Steve’s stomach. “I hope so.”
“So I am the favorite?” Morgan smirks.
Tony kisses Steve’s cheek. “I love you, too.”
“This is your fault,” he points his finger angrily at the screen. “It’s not just mine and I’m tired of taking it all. Why didn’t you tell me?”
Steve’s heart flutters at the sound of those words. He hugs his son, fighting back the tears of happiness that threaten to fall. He makes sure both of his pups are comfortable before leaving the room with Tony.
Pretty soon the piles of presents have vanished, leaving behind a new pile of baby products that needed to be put away. Tony can’t help the loud sigh that leaves him at the thought of carrying the items upstairs and putting them in the nursery. It would just be a job for Steve to complete.
Steve tries another number, muttering a quick prayer when the phone rings. The other end is picked up almost instantly.
“It’s not just that. I wanted all of us to be together. I wanted my dad and now he’s...I messed it up so bad. Or...or he did. He’s so selfish.”
“It’s still too soon, but as of right now there are no signs of defects,” The beta answers.
Tony huffs and turns to Steve. “I’m so sorry. I told you I suck at this.”
“That was dangerous,” Tony scolds. “You could’ve been killed, kid.”
This wasn’t making any sense. He didn’t look pregnant, didn’t have any of the symptoms. At least, he didn’t think he did. It finally dawns on him that the unusual changes in his body wasn’t because of stress or any illnesses. He was pregnant. And now he was in labor.
The SUV pulls away and disappears behind the tower, out of sight and away from the swarm of news reporters.
A soft knock on the door cuts through the silence and they both snap their heads up in its direction. The door opens and a nurse enters, wheeling in a standard hospital bassinet. Steve sits up straight, eyes filling with more tears at the sight of his son. The baby is clean and wrapped in a blanket. A light blue hat has been placed over his head.
“It’s so pretty!” Sarah exclaims.
Sam is there beside him, holding his hand and rubbing a thumb over his knuckles to soothe him. Natasha was grateful Bucky had Sam. Bucky would probably crumble completely if not for him.
“That’s okay,” Steve assures. “Are you going to tell him?”
“But what about my training?” Peter asks. “We do it every Saturday.”
“Dammit, Tony,” Steve sighs. He glares at his phone when it refuses to ring. Tony was usually pretty good about picking up. But when he was tied up in a meeting-like he was now-getting him to answer the phone was impossible.
“What the hell are you doing here?” Sam scolds. “You’re supposed to be at home!”
“But you’re the key. I don’t know how it works; they don’t tell me anything. They lock me into a room and trap me to...a breeding bench. That’s why I didn’t fight you off; I couldn’t. You think I wanted this? You think I wanted to wake up into a world I don’t know and be forced to breed? I’d give anything to have my old life back. I didn’t ask for this.”
“You two can be excused,” Steve says, and once Flash has caught his breath, is led quickly out of the room and upstairs where it was safer.
“What if it is? I can’t lose anyone else. And my uncle Sam he...he’s the one leading us right now. Everything will fall apart for good if he’s gone.”
Steve hadn’t shared the news of his pregnancy yet. He purposely waited a few weeks to make sure that he was pregnant. The test he had taken when he started to feel off wasn’t enough of a reassurance. He didn’t blame himself for lacking trust in the drug store tests. They had let him down before.
Peter comes back over to watch his dad work. “What were you listening to? I heard his voice,” he says.
“Eh. I’m fucking exhausted. I’m used to avoiding sleep and even then I barely feel the effects, but this...I’m constantly tired.”
“Guess it’s just you and me, kiddo.” Tony tells his son. He adjusts Peter so that the newborn is laying on his chest, just like Steve had done the moment he was born.
“Surprise us, buddy.”
“That’s it. You
“Hey, Pete,” Tony comes over and places a hand over his son’s back. “Papa and I need to tell you something. Go wait in the living room for us okay?”
“Got it. Thank you, Tony.”
“Okay. I don’t mind coming over if-”
His right leg continues to shake as he glances around the small waiting area. He reads posters that bring awareness to STD’s and what he can do to prevent them. The next poster is similar, though this time it relates more to his situation. Peter quickly turns away and glances down at his lap.
Bruce decided not to get involved. He knew how competitive his teammates could be and the last thing he wanted was to give them more of a reason to argue with each other.
“You just seem-”
But his taste for revenge hasn’t been quenched. For years the alpha in front of him hurt him in unimaginable ways. For years Steve was beaten and raped, forced to believe that he was nothing but Hydra’s toy, their puppet. He was taught that he was nothing. He wasn’t a fighter, he wasn’t strong enough. He was just a worthless omega.
“I know, but you’re going to need that and the balm. Oh and the pillow!” Steve rushes across the room to get the items Tony has refused to put away. Ever since he received them from the shower, they’ve been piled up and left in the corner.
“Good evening, Steve,” Jarvis greets, startling the omega. “My apologies, sir. I didn’t mean to scare you.”
“Hang on. Shoot web? Like a spider?” Tony asks. He doesn’t miss the way his son’s face pinks up.
“Soon,” Tony finally supplies an answer. It’s not one he’s thrilled about giving, wishing he could make soon happen now. It was obvious Steve was hurting.
There’s no sign of his papa and a wave of uneasiness washes over him, but Peter knows his papa is fine. He was Captain America.
Steve keeps one hand on Tony’s lower back, slowly rubbing the area. “You’re okay,” he soothes, though he struggles to believe his own words. Tony eventually pulls back and Steve grabs a wad of toilet tissue.
“Steve, wait,” Natasha stops him and he turns to face her. “They don’t know you.”
“Honey, you okay?” Tony lays a hand over Steve’s thigh, rubbing the area soothing. Steve nods and grabs another gift bag to distract himself, but then Tony is stopping him. “Steve, what’s wrong?”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says first. He lingers in the entryway of the lap, arms crossed over his chest and eyes bright with tears.
“I know you told him first. I told Nat when I found out.”
Only one alpha was around….or at least he usually was. Steve sits up again, eyes immediately drawn to the closed door. He shouldn’t expect Tony to come running every time he had a nightmare, but he’d be lying if he said he didn’t wish the alpha would. It wasn’t just his scent and warmth that comforted Steve...it was all of him.
“You can. I want you to cum first.”
Tony can vividly see Steve smiling. It was a sight he was going to miss. Steve had a great smile. It was bright and always full of confidence.
The room grows silent and for a second Steve wonders if Jarvis had abandoned him. Then before Steve can even ask his question again, the same holographic image of his son is conjured up, displaying the growing pup.
“Did you even listen to it?” Peter asks.
“Please. I love you. Don’t leave me. Please don’t leave me.”
“I’m sure he didn’t mean it,” Steve tells her, hoping she’d understand that her little brother didn’t know how to properly play with her big girl toys. But she only cries harder.
All eyes are on Tony now. Everyone else had asked that same question before Natasha had arrived, but Tony didn’t have the answer then. He doesn’t have it now.
“It’ll be fine,” Steve tells Morgan, but Tony knows those words are meant for himself.
“You-you guys needed help! I heard Papa saying-”
Steve sighs heavily and turns around. Tony’s eyes are immediately drawn to the Captain’s protruding middle.
“You go. I’ll catch up,” Peter says and slings his backpack over his shoulder. “I need a minute.”
“You too. Bye.”
Steve huffs out a small laugh. “That obvious, huh?”
Steve nods and holds her close. “I love you, too.”
Steve frowns. “Tony, you’re not going.”
His eyes are shooting open at the new voice. Instead of those steel blue ones he’s always been forced to meet, brown eyes are staring back at him. He stops struggling when the scent of coffee fills his nose.
Pepper chuckles and shakes her head. “Go home.”
The alpha shakes his head and takes another step back.
Morgan enters her home cautiously and the first person she sees is her brother. He’s on his phone and that’s when she feels the vibration in her back pocket.
“I want that. Steve, I want that so fucking much.” Tony ignores the bitter scent and rushes toward Steve, taking the omega’s hands in his own. “I love you. I do.”
Peter frowns. “Yeah. Why wouldn’t I-”
He wonders if the omega had been brought home with him. That’s how he usually liked to end his nights.
Peter grumbles to himself as he struggles to fasten his fifth pair of jeans. With another failed attempt, Peter quickly discards the article of clothing and adds it to the messy pile on his bedroom floor. He has the same issue with the next pair.
Steve can’t help but smile at the sound of Tony’s voice. “Yeah, I guess so.”
Steve keeps his distance at first, too shy and unsure of what to say. His first meeting with Happy hadn’t gone so well and it never got better from there. The beta was very protective of Tony, that much Steve could tell, and it was painfully clear that he still had trust issues with Steve.
“You can have me,” Tony says before kissing Steve again. He wraps his hands around Steve’s wrists and eases them off. He’s careful when he touches Steve, and even more so when he slides the leather jacket from off his shoulders. “Let me, darling.”
Peter grimaces. “Please spare me the details.”
Steve’s never felt so out of place.
“Barnes? He’s your dad, right?”
Steve quietly goes down stairs, stretching the t-shirt over his growing middle. He makes a mental note to ask Tony for bigger clothes.
“I’m sorry,” Steve whimpers. He’s calm now, all thanks to Tony. The pups have gone back to bed after Tony’s calmed them down enough. Steve, still unable to sleep after his terrifying nightmare, remains wide awake, too afraid to attempt sleep. He whimpers again and pulls his knees up to his chest, closing himself off.
“If you’re not going to take your education seriously then maybe you shouldn’t be training. Maybe you should be studying, right?”
The team didn’t have all the details yet, and Steve wasn’t sure how they were going to react to the news. It had been a surprise for him and he can only imagine it being the same for them.
But he doesn’t have a choice. He was meant to be used for what Hydra needed. He was their puppet. He was theirs to control and use however they pleased.
The room seemed cozy enough. It was just for one night after all. But yet Peter pictures himself staying a little longer. He’d keep the painting because the city was his home, but he’d add other things. He had plenty of posters he could put up and maybe add a shelf to place all of his collectibles. He could almost see himself living here.
“Okay, then I’m going,” Tony says and he slips on his sunglasses. “You’ll be fine, Steve.”
Steve hisses, forcing Tony to stop in his tracks. They’ve at least made it out of the elevator and the rest of the walk was usually short, but with Steve relying on Tony to carry him, the time spent getting to the apartment was taking longer than usual.
“Yeah,” Natasha replies and peers down, smoothing back some of the dark strands. “He needs it.”
“Someone was hungry,” Pepper chuckles.
Tony quickly switches over the call. “Hi, honey. I’m sorry I’m running late but I can assure you I’ll be home in-”
Natasha smiles for a moment before it’s faltering and her face changes again to a more serious expression. “Steve, just know we’re all here for you.”
Peter nods but refuses to make eye contact. He fumbles with the lock again and this time Ned steps in to help. He has it open in seconds.
“That makes one of us,” Steve huffs and glances down at the clothes beside him.
Bucky sighs again. “A lot. I almost lost you, Pete’s been lying to us, and Stark’s back.”
Tony scoffs and turns away when the bartender returns with his drink. He thanks the man with a nod before taking a sip from the glass.
The omega does his best to wash fast, but his body aches and screams for relief. The hot water helps the soreness in his muscles, but it was going to take more than a shower to alleviate the pain.
“You’re fine, Pete,” Bruce assures, making sure to give Peter a pat on the back before exiting the room.
From the beginning, Steve knew she was going to take after Tony. Her stubbornness could very well be something she picked up from him, but Tony was just as stubborn. Their daughter was no different. She did things her way. If she wanted to enter the world ahead of schedule, then she was going to do it.
Tony immediately rushes over to Steve’s side and Bucky lets him go, allowing Tony to hold him instead. “I’m so sorry,” Tony whispers and brings Steve’s head into his chest, letting him sob and stain his expensive suit with tears.
“That was…” Steve trails off.
Tony frowns. “Really old, huh?”
The baby weight was slowly being shed; every chance he got he was working on his physique. It was difficult on some days to hit the gym or go for a run when he was caring for a newborn, but little by little he was getting his body back.
Steve sighs. “Close enough. Can you say Daddy?”
Tony offers a small smile and takes Steve’s hand, no longer caring about his rule of no touching. Steve may be off limits with some things, but he wasn’t going to leave Steve hanging if he was upset. Tony was trying to be a good friend.
“I know, but he’s our son and we love him no matter what.”
“How? Tony, they locked the door and-”
“I’m not used to seeing you dressed so...casually, Mr. Stark,” Alexander says with a grin.
Tony turns away from the road to glance in his son’s direction, confused as to why the teen had stopped talking. At first he figures Peter has gotten distracted by his phone or something outside the car, but then he notices the sad expression on his son’s face.
And now he was paying for it. The pain would always be there. Tormenting him. Haunting him.
“You okay?” Bucky raises a questioning brow. “Usually your spidey sense is on point.”
“He has an alpha!”
“I am happy.” Steve lifts his head to shoot Tony a smile. “You’ve made me happy.”
“Yeah.”
“I’ll tell you later.”
“Why did you skip school?” Sam asks.
“First...I think you need to get out of those wet clothes.”
“Did you and Riley...sorry.”
“Do you still want to help me with this?” Steve asks when he senses Tony’s attitude shift at the mention of the baby. He didn’t understand why Tony was acting different when just a few hours ago he was talking about getting items for the baby.
