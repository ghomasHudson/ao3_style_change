“What about you? The crime is all fun and good so long as your goddamn best friend doesn't end up behind bars?”
“America’s playground,” Tony mumbled, far more interested in pressing feather-light kisses to Steve’s jaw, tender and loving. Maybe, Steve let himself think, let himself hope that he felt it too. Hard and fast and damned foolish.
They kiss, in front of the whole world - it’s not every day that the General of the Army of the United States gets married to a man - and all Potts can think of is him, and how damn lucky he is to have him, forever.
Bruce has seen Tony at his worst, during the winter of ‘91 and the following decade, when he’d put everything and anything in his body without a care of quality or quantity or if he’d wake up the next day. Bruce was there when he got his stomach pumped, both times, he’d seen what the palladium did to him, he’d watched him fall from the sky all those years ago, but none of those times had Bruce really, truly believed that Tony Stark would die.
The next morning, Steve wakes up on Peggy’s couch with the left-over buzz of a well-played heist (if all goes well, they won’t even notice they have a forgery until a private collector wants to buy it - the bourgeoisie, Steve’s found, are awfully paranoid of being sold forgeries) and a text from Tony:
Tony turns the business card over in his hands. There’s no name, just a number. Against, probably, his better judgement, he types the number into his contacts.
It doesn’t take them long to know the casino inside out, by the end of the week, they have recon done, they know the casino probably better than the regular gamblers, they have a direct stream and control of the surveillance feed,  a fully working replica of the vault, and their transport.
“A divorce,” Bucky mutters under his breath. Nat steps in his foot under the table and he attempts to hide his wince, to no avail if Fury’s raised eyebrow suggests anything.
As soon as Steve finishes, Tony stands up, deciding to ignore the wolf whistles from the extended team, and takes Steve by the hand dragging him toward their room.
“You’re a kid. Kids get training wheels,” Steve says firmly, crossing his arms and looking down at Peter.
Amongst the frenzy, it’s easy to slip out unnoticed. It’s still pretty light outside, nearly curbing upon ‘dusk’, daylight savings and the tilt of the earth being what it is, especially with the solstice barely out of the rearview mirror, he couldn’t have expected anything else. The painting is already in the car when Steve gets to it, he’ll drive back to Peggy’s, Buck and Nat will come back separately, and if all goes well, they lie low for a bit, check on Matt, maybe they’ll consider another con, maybe they’ll go home.
Instead of falling into a crisis, Steve asks Bucky a question he already knows the answer to and directs the others to vaguely ‘do better’. It doesn’t make him feel any better in the slightest.
When the dust settles, he flies as fast as he can towards it, ignoring the rest of the team yelling over the comms.
“Tony...” Steve says weakly. Tony’s close enough that he can see the extent of the damage on him, almost none of his suit is properly intact and he can see the shine of tears in his eyes.
Steve looks directly into the lens of the camera, “Steven Grant Rogers.” He wonders if Tony might watch the tapes later.
Tony pushes Steve against the wall as soon as they stumble into his bedroom, taking and taking, heady with it all, already. He’d be more embarrassed at how fast he got here if it weren’t for Steve parallel to him - moaning softly into his mouth and pushing his hips up.
“Call me, if you get bored in that tower of yours,” Steve says, placing a hand on the small of his back and teasing at the hickey that’s just peeking out of Tony’s collar after they get dressed, before he slips out the door with one, final, sweet kiss to the corner of his mouth. It had taken them far too long to put their clothes back on, getting distracted by each other over and over, pretending the rest of the world doesn’t exist.
“—and the thing is, you’re very classically attractive, like Prince Charming, except that would make me a princess which the Planet already think I am, though that might just be your influence, but then again who wouldn’t listen to someone that good looking, even in those glasses and the awful flannel you’re so goddamn pretty and handsome, and have I ever told you, sometimes i wish you forget to take your flannel shirts when you leave so I can wear them because you’re very big and smell nice.”
Steve looks wistful and so damn sad Tony would be willing to fly to the moon on the back of a butterfly if it would make him happy. “Wanna be... wanna be boyfriends, ‘cause you’re nice and pretty 'n smart but I can’t.”
“I do realise why you’re… annoyed. I’ll deal with my marriage after all this. I’m done with secrets,” Steve continues.
Steve and Tony continue eye-fucking whilst carrying out a rather mild conversation about how the blues play with the purples in the painting in front of them and the effect of the impasto on the mood and atmosphere, until, of course, they’re plunged into darkness.
He knows it’s a dangerous game, interacting with him more than usual, licking his lips and tracking his eyes with more intent than the teasing repertoire they’ve gotten into suggests, but if the way Stevens’ eyes flick down on occasion mean anything at all (unless his back pocket is just that incredibly fascinating), its a game safer than snakes and ladders.
Bruce stopped believing in magic a long time ago, so he can’t fathom why he’s disappointed when Dick tugs him away, when the sky has, inexplicably, turned dark and the stars, so much more than you could see in Gotham, shine bright.
“Hey, hey, sweetheart, keep your eyes open for me, please, please, baby, you can’t die,” Tony begs. They’re almost out of the building, just a few feet, then a couple yards to the medics.
Natasha just shrugs. Steve is almost pleased that he could see that she’s enjoying this. Almost, if it weren’t for the fact that Bucky had somehow landed himself here. He’s disappointed and he was in
It takes less than a second for her to spot James at the bar downing a drink and half-heartedly eyeing the go-go dancers in front of him, then another second to find the backroom, distract the guard long enough to slip in, and make herself acquainted with the players patiently awaiting James’ arrival.
Steve, as a test for more his own enjoyment than anything else, decides to signal a passing waitress for a refill. When he turns back to the table the wallet is still there, but the ticket is gone.
He catches a flash of red hair at the blackjack table and makes his way over there - she’s not exactly the friend he came here for, but close enough. He slides into the booth as he greets her, “Evening, Natasha.”
“Technically,” Tony said, fighting a yawn, “I don’t. A subsidiary of Stark Industries owns the bank that owns some of the casinos down there.” His hair was messy, not intentionally, black-and-white photoshoot in a workshop that’s actually very well composed soundstage, but ridiculous bedhead messy. Steve rarely found Tony not gorgeous, but right now, curled in his comforter, light casting long, lazy shadows dancing around the room, Tony seemed so vulnerable and trusting and open and he knew it was way too early for words as strong as these, but he was falling, he’s falling hard and fast and all he could think was
His hand comes up to his face of its own accord, touching his beard. God, Tony’s going to get JARVIS to hack into SHIELD and find out what happened on that mission, because he knows Steve, and he knows it wasn’t him who’d fucked up however badly it had been to make Steve this distracted as to not even notice himself.
Captain Stevens is too perfect, Potts decides one day, after seeing him far too many times to be labelled ‘coincidence’. He’s uptight, every crease on his uniform is perfectly in place and every hair on his head is coated in pomade and flawlessly styled.
“This morning,” Steve answers with an almost self-deprecating grin, but now isn’t the time for melancholy and introspection and regret.
“You must be enjoying this, Stark,” she says, and Tony can see her downing her drink and making her way outside. He just about refrains from giving her the bird as she walks past him to her next position, outside. He’s glad that he’s not going to have to watch Steve and Storm make out.
Tony laughs, “Let’s keep it to special occasions,” he says, patting Steve on his shoulder. He’s, for lack of a better term, utterly hammered, and it’s a good look on him. He’s happy and carefree in a way he so rarely is as their impeccable Captain. Tony’s pretty sure he hasn’t stopped smiling all evening. It makes his traitorous heart skip beats that surely can’t be healthy for a person with a heart condition.
Bucky grunts and doesn’t even question how he knows that Steve got out, instead, he presses a plane ticket and an address into his hand. “You better make it. He’s planning on taking down Loki,” he tells him before he does a significantly better job of blending into the crowds.
Tony watches it happen in slow motion. He’s too far away to do anything significant when it happens, but stay stationary in the air and just watch uselessly. He’s not drawn the morbid magnificence that is a building falling, iron, steel and cement crashing to the ground, but rather the one lone figure in blue at the bottom, making sure the last of the inhabitants are out.
“Maybe prison has reformed you,” Natasha says, smiling slightly. She’s not exactly ecstatic at the prospect of seeing James again, but Steve has a plan, it would be a shame to see it go to shit before they’ve even started because neither of them have any compunctions about beating the ever-loving fuck out of their best friend. She, on the other hand, knows James well enough that although he’s not afraid to hit a girl, he's far too overprotective of his reputation to hit a girl on a Friday night outside Hollywood’s third hottest club. “Stay put,” she says, patting him on his head as she leaves.
“Glad to know your priorities are straight, Romanoff,” Steve says, wincing as she applies antiseptic.
“They tend to do that. Natasha Romanoff would have caused too many red flags,” she says, and it’s explanation enough, though Steve hopes, for her sake, that she hadn’t burned through all her aliases just yet. “You just get out?”
“I can’t be in love with you, ‘cause you’re too pretty and too nice and too smart, and you’re the best person I know ‘n I don’ don’ wanna ruin that with stupid stupid feelings ‘n shit. Stupid.”
Out of his jacket pocket, Steve brings out a plane ticket and places it parallel to the wallet. He keeps his hand over it. “This is a plane ticket, job offer. In or out, right now.”
“If you’re going to steal from Loki Laufeyson you better be prepared for the aftermath. This sort of thing used to be civilised. You’d hit a guy, he’d whack you. Done. Laufeyson… at the end of this, he better not know you're involved, not know your names, or think you're dead. Because he'll kill you, and then he'll go to work on you.”
“Art professor, NYU, doing some research, visiting some friends,” Steve says, his personal life had become shorter and shorter as the evening progressed, and quite frankly, he’s pretty sure that Tony's only interested in his shoulder span than what he does for a living, not that he’s complaining.
“You can’t punch your way out of everything,” Natasha reminds him, cleaning up the cut on his cheek as Sam tosses a bag of frozen peas to Bucky.
Steve nods and replies, “Good morning,” because Sarah Rogers may have raised a criminal, but she raised a (relatively) polite one. And one of his buddies back in the cellblock explicitly reminded him to be on his best behaviour or else he’d have no chance of getting parole.
So he takes his time, wanders about, takes in the art, mentally filing away teaching points, flirts around a little without any real feeling. He’s been warned away from romance far too much to consider anything more than a one night stand, and in the middle of a job really isn't the best time (he’s learnt the easy way through Bucky learning the hard way). Romance, in their profession, is kept entirely for marks. Because you either get with someone you work, and the adage ‘don’t shit where you eat’, rings true even amongst the lawless, or get with an innocent person who eventually either finds out about your side job and leaves, or finds about your side job and gets caught up in it.
Tony takes the stairs to buy himself some time - he didn’t think about what he was going to say, and he definitely didn’t expect to do this with an audience, but he should’ve figured Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum would be here, pecking like mother hens over their precious Cap.
“Right, sure, normal answer.  But I mean, do you brush your teeth on the go, do you brush them at work, do you - ”
- look, those nice hotels have plenty of trees in their lobbies, they can spare one.  And I figured they might - you know - do a favor.  For me.”
“Yeah, whatever, oh wise one.  You ever think about offering this as a paid service, maybe going for a Dr. Phil thing?”
“Yeah, all those high society folks tend to drink a lot of expensive mob-smuggled liquor from what I hear - ”
“Sure,” Tony says, and he’s fine, really.  He thinks about how somewhere out there in the multiverse there’s probably a version of them quietly living out their lives in the cabin Pennsylvania.  It’s not
“Nope,” Tony said.  “Rock bottom was that off the rack suit you wore when you testified in front of Congress in 2012.  It was tragic.  Whole websites went up overnight to protest it.  The Dow lost five hundred points - ”
“I don’t understand why you’re so surprised,” Clint said.  “I’m a complex person.  Much like my wines.”
“It’s fine, you can stay over afterwards,” Tony says, and then hurriedly finishes, “if you want, I mean.”
“And I grew up to be an emotionally stunted adult, be glad we’re keeping you in the general vicinity of grade level.  Hey, question.  Did you happen to leave a toothbrush in my bathroom this weekend when you were here?”
"Okay," Steve says, and the next day they sleep til noon and order in Chinese food and Tony misses his meeting by quite a bit, and neither of them mentions it.
“Glad to hear it,” Tony says, wandering over to his breakfast car and snagging a piece of bacon.  “See you at the Black Widow tonight?”
Now it's Clint's turn to look dangerously empurpled. "Get upstairs, woman," he growls at her, and crowds her heels the whole way there.
“Over my dead body,” Tony says.  “If she tries to be a superhero, you know who her first bad guy is going to be?  Me.  Boys I won’t worry about so much, but suits of armor, that’ll get her grounded.”
“If something’s wrong with Natasha and Thor, I want to be there,” Steve said firmly, and his stubbornness was so endearing and also
“Sorry, Mr. Stark,” Peter says, but Tony’s been going too easy on him lately, clearly, because he’s smirking.
They leave the captured soldiers with what remains of the Sokovian authorities and take off in the jet over a lake glittering incongruously in the early morning sunlight.  Wilson and Bruce talk quietly in the cockpit and Wanda spreads out across a couple of seats to catch a nap.  Tony fiddles with his wedding ring, spins it around his finger over and over and counts down the minutes.
at you.  I’d run my mouth all over you.  I’d take you all the way into my mouth - I’d swallow you so deep, I want to
Stark glances toward the back door, and then his eyes slide over to lock with Natasha’s.  She has a couple different ideas about what he might be thinking, and she’s not sure she likes any of them.  “A compelling point,” he says.  “But I’ve got a counter-proposal for you.”
It rains the entire ride through Oklahoma.  He gives Texas a wide berth and heads north again, and he’s all the way to South Dakota before he realizes his cash is about to run out and he’s no further from what he’s trying to get away from than he was when he left New York, so he checks into a motel and considers his options.
“You’re thinking about it,” Tony said.  His voice was light, like he was enjoying himself.  “You’re thinking about whatever I was doing to you in the dream.”
“I’m not taking out a Times Square billboard or anything but I just assumed, he’s your best friend and all - ”
“Liar,” Tony says, flopping down on the couch.  “What’s up, Capsicle?  Decided to drop by and cast aspersions on my ability to feed my daughter?”
“Well, I would have just texted you an address, but you left your phone behind,” Tony says.  “Here it is, by the way.  And now that you have it, I guess I can get going.”
“Sure,” Steve says, following him down the block.  It’s near quitting time, and after a long day of tracking down a money laundering paper trail that
“I bet I could get you worked up with just my hands.  I have pretty amazing hands, I’ve been told.  Of course, I could do even better with my mouth.”
From behind his desk, Director Pierce leans back in his chair.  “Shut the door, son.  Come sit down.  How’s the Zemo case coming along?”
“Good for him.  Is his friend hot?  I mean, is she smart and interesting and nice?  Because that’s what matters,” Tony says loudly, even though Morgan is definitely not paying attention.
They’re pretty deep into the Bronx, and Steve doesn’t know the neighborhood at all, so he’s happy to let his fellow agent lead the way; Sitwell walks purposefully, his eyes darting from side to side, and Steve wonders if he thinks somebody might’ve followed them after their last stop.
“Because the people I’ve done Thanksgiving with don’t always, you know, stick around, and so I’d rather just skip it sometimes, right?  But, uh - I don’t know, you guys showed up and we saved the world and then you moved in and you’re still here, so I guess that’s something.  So I guess I’d have to say I’m thankful for that.”
“Figures,” Steve said, and that’s when he leaned forward and Tony leaned forward too and they met in the middle in one of the sloppiest and most awesome first kisses Tony had ever had, and for the record he’d had a
"Oh, yeah?" he says, as she steps to him and undoes his tie, loosens his collar. "What do you read in me?"
Steve lowered his newspaper as Tony settled down on the bench at his side.  “Honestly, it kind of takes the sting out of the Cold War when you know how it ends.”
too honest for his liking, so he nips at Steve, captures the other man’s lower lip between his teeth as if to punish him for forcing that from Tony’s mouth.  “Anything, what do you - ”
“They’re saying it might make the Billboard Hot 100 by Christmas Eve,” Steve said, as if he had nothing to do with it at all.
“Me?  Never,” Tony says, pressing a kiss to his jaw, the spot below his ear, his throat.  “I wasn’t that drunk, anyway.  Wouldn’t have been fair, not with you sober as the day you were born.”
“So,” Tony says between kisses, “as much as I would - mm - very much like to defile our conference room, don’t you think the Power Rangers out there will be wondering where we are?”
Stark and Banner beat them back to the Black Widow, and they’re already sitting at the bar helping themselves.  “Is that my good whiskey?” Natasha asks, arching an eyebrow.
“I was actually expecting it to be worse,” Steve says.  “It barely even looks like it was condemned by the city just last week.”
“You wanna put a little something behind it, Rogers?  My granny coulda hit that pitch,” Bucky crowed.  He threw Tony a glance over his shoulder.  “If I were you I’d talk to your pitcher, cause if he throws another one like that I’m gonna swing and I’m gonna hit it right outta the park and you’re gonna lose this game.”  He winked.  “Just a little friendly advice.”
“I’m not freaking out,” Steve said.  “People coming back from the dead isn’t exactly new to me.  How do I get you out of the quantum realm?”
“Good thing I’m not asking you to,” Stark says.  “First of all, the metal’s literally priceless, so you couldn’t pay for it even if you really wanted to, and second of all, you can think of me as the team’s sponsor, all right?  It’s just the cost of doing business.  And we’re doing some pretty good business, if you ask me.”
There’s no one there. Her parlor is as she left it, dark behind thick velvet drapes. She turns on a lamp, picks up her ivory cigarette case, and shakes one loose, frowning at how few are left. She rests it on the exact center of her lip and lights, shaking the match out and dropping it into a jade vase. Taking a deep drag, she begins undressing, expertly slithering out of her gown without disturbing the burning coal at the tip of the cigarette. Leaving a trail of clothing behind her, she wanders down the hall to her bedroom, where she swings her wardrobe door open and begins working on her brassiere closure, the column of ash growing at the tip of her gasper. When the hands pin her arms behind her, she stiffens but does not panic.
“It’s a pleasure,” Steve says, he knows better than to give a name, regardless of how much he wants to hear Tony, in his perfectly tailored suits and perfectly slicked-back hair, scream it.
Steve gives her what he hopes was a withering look that conveyed just the right amount of exasperation - in his defence, he’s slightly rusty at friendly banter. By her returning look, he rightly assumes that it may have been just a touch too far… murderous. Regardless, he gets to the point, “Where is he?”
Tony comes up to the common room from his workshop to find Steve sitting there, still in his uniform, sans cowl, elbows on his knees and head bowed.
Steve makes a noncommittal noise, if his aliases hold up, if Matt does his thing. Tony, of course, doesn’t know that. Either way, he has time; almost two months.
Steve shrugs. “We get someone not as good and you can go back to… petty pickpocketing, Peter Parker.”
Steve's a free man. He goes to the place that feels closest to home, the closest he'll get without Tony, and finds an old friend in the process.
“Stop it,” Tony says, picking his way closer, muting JARVIS when he starts to make louder noises about the structure of the building, “and stay awake while you’re at it.”
A light blush falls over Steve’s cheeks when he sings that, the furthest he’s gotten from shameless all night. He tips his chin down, so he’s looking up through his lashes at Tony.
It takes half a minute for the emergency lighting to turn on and another minute for the full power to come back. The chaos a mere ninety seconds of powerlessness caused in the gallery was something Steve revelled in, the world undone so easily, it would make anyone want to stop to smell the roses.
Steve brushes up against him, without acknowledging him in the slightest and forges on, plan fulfilled. All he has to do it wait. Then, out of pure curiosity, he doubles back and follows him through a series of back alleys until he reaches the backside an apartment complex flirting with ‘decrepit’. Parker takes maybe two steps back before swinging himself up 2, 3, 4 floors via the fire escape. A broad skillset could get one very far in this world.
With the last of his strength, Potts pulls on Stevens’ hair to pull him up to his feet and kisses him, pushing his tongue into his mouth and groaning at the taste of himself, bitter and tangy, in his mouth. When they pull apart Stevens grins slightly, then presses a small, sweet kiss to the corner of Potts’ mouth, saying more than he dares.
, and the last time he would have seen him would have been when he got dragged away in cuffs in the courthouse, he doesn’t think he would be able to forgive himself.
“Oh?” Bucky speaks up for the first time in a while. He knows where this is going and he likes it even less.
“Like yours are? Drop the fucking prison bullshit, we do this as a team or not at all. Apologise, both of you.”
He pants above Potts, grinning dopily, the barest sheen of sweat cover his face, and holds out a hand to help him up.
“You need to tell me about what you did to Bucky,” Steve says, he knows just as well Nat that maybe he’s not, exactly 100% about what he had planned, hell, he can’t even be sure that the people he needs want to work with him. But Nat trusts him, and Bucky made his promises a long time ago. He’s not going to screw up this time.
“Manhattan,” Tony replies, ruefully. Even if they were going back to the same borough, there’s no chance they would cross paths.
Steve knows it’s unfair, especially considering, well, everything, but he can’t help it. Thankfully, Nat shuts both of them up with a glare strong enough for them to table the inevitable argument. For now.
If emotions could radiate from people, Matt would be screaming suspicion and distrust. He doesn’t do well in casinos far too much input, though he has enough faith in Steve that he’s pretty sure he’ll never actually cross the threshold. “I’m the whole list, aren’t I?”
Steve looks hopeful, but there’s something in his eyes that makes Tony think he's waiting for the other shoe to drop, “Okay,” he whispers, smiling.
“Casino’s are like… fairgrounds for adults. With greater consequences,” Steve wasn’t sure if the sentence even makes sense, but Tony giggled and he found that he couldn’t care for grammatical structure and other such follies.
He catches himself just before he spirals into a pit of self-hatred, some ‘best-friend’ he is, because Natasha has that glint in her eye, the one that used to mean they were in for a fun night in some absent multimillionaire’s mansion, one that now means she’s playing him like a fucking violin.
When James comes in, poorly constructed veil of enthusiasm barely shielding his face, he immediately pulls a face at Natasha as though there was a bad smell in the room. Or, well, a worse smell.
Bucky knows damn well the rules they had when they started all this, and he knows that Steve knows that he knows them better than the Constitution.
“I didn't know you owned casinos?” Steve said rolling over to face Tony properly. It’s stupidly late, a kind of late that’s really far too much into the next day to really, feasibly be perceived as stupidly late and really, is stupidly early, early enough that the sun’s begun it’s daily rise, streaming in soft, pale dawn light through Steve’s loft’s windows. They’d stayed up the entire night, just talking, actually getting to know each other.
“No, goddamnit, Steve,” Tony carefully navigates the remains of the building to get closer to Steve, already planning out an exit strategy.
“You have me stalking the most powerful man in Vegas? All week?” Peter says, in disbelief, when Steve tells him his role at the start of the week.
“Not that I’m not loving seeing my ex in my place of business, but cut to the chase already, Steve needs help getting out doesn’t he?”
“Friend of JJJ,” Steve replied. Peter supposes he intended to be vague and somewhat mysterious and elusive, but to Peter’s admittedly limited knowledge, Mr. Jameson doesn’t actually have that many friends. “Sit down.”
“Don’t fool yourself, you know that they probably have someone on the inside,” Bucky mutters. He almost wishes he was back teacher poker. Almost. “Besides, I’m not the snitch.”
Steve returns his smile and drags his eyes down Tony’s body, slowly, deliberately. In his ear, Sam gives the one minute warning. Steve doesn’t actually have much to do right now, he’s just back up and the wheels, other than gather knowledge and become cultured and hopefully laid. He did his share earlier; the forgery, the planning.
They linger just a little longer, trailing fingers and kisses on a path to nowhere until a phone chimes somewhere in the room, tossed haphazardly amongst trousers and shirts and shoes, and knocking them out of their little bubble.
Steve takes a sip of his bourbon to calm himself. Tony can - should, really - do whatever he likes with whomever he likes, it’s not Steve’s place to say, anymore.
Steve nods, getting up, “Right… my mistake, this table’s cold, anyway.” Who said prison hadn’t humbled him?
Stevens keeps eye contact with him, gorgeous blue eyes shining wide and bright in the darkness of the closet, as he tugs down his fly and mouths the head of his cock through his damp boxers, tongue pressing insistently against his slit - the roughness of the fabric of his boxers coupled with the hot, wet heat of Stevens’ mouth and tongue made Potts cry out above him and clench his hand tightly in Steven’s hair, which just makes him moan, adding low vibrations to the rock hard, leaking tip of his cock.
“I’m pretty sure the other guy is kinda famous?” Peter says, once again blissfully ignorant to Bucky’s inner turmoil, “but like, Elon Musk famous, if he was more… normal?”
“Can’t what?” And Tony, without question or trial, is going to hell for provoking him. He should put him straight to bed and leave a glass of water on his bedside, he should ignore what he says, because he’s drunker than a rugby player on tour and he barely knows which way is up, let alone what he’s saying.
Don’t admit to anything before they show they have proof, one of the first rules he learned. Though he supposes he has to commend them for at least trying to get him to admit to something.
“Don’t play fucking stupid, Tony’s with Laufeyson. Tell me this isn't about screwing the guy who's screwing your husband,” Bucky growls. If Steve were a lesser man he’d be utterly terrified.
Steve doesn’t often get the subway. It brings back… interesting memories. This time, he’s not going particularly anywhere, just watching a guy who looks barely old enough to graduate high school - by recommendation of JJJ. The train comes to a sudden stop and all the commuters sway forth with the air of people who have come to expect it land have given up fighting it, like a child with a broken backpack, with the exception of Parker. He, committing subway etiquette blasphemy, bumps into a guy who looks like he believes he’s too good for the subway, sleek, well-dressed Wall Street type. Steve has fond memories of breaking into guys like his houses. Parker, in one of the smoothest lifts Steve’s ever seen, takes the guy’s Apple watch and his wallet, muttering a shy, bashful, “Sorry,” after.
Amongst the throngs of up-and-coming actors and trust-fund kids on benders, James Rhodes and Pepper Potts stride down the street, doing god knows what. Steve’s good at hiding, you don’t (allegedly) steal hundreds of millions of dollars worth of various antiques and paintings without sneaking around some, and he knows when to slide down in his seat just so that the average person wouldn’t know he’s there, but by the sharp rap on the window, he’s cruelly reminded that James Rhodes and Pepper Potts are not the average person.
have access to a pretty massive number of Pym particles.  Which won’t be invented for another 15 years.”
When he pulls up to the hospital it’s crawling with press, so he double parks on a side street and flies in, startles some security guy when he lands on the helipad and takes the stairs two at a time.
“Exactly,” Tony says.  “Jameson would love to think he can divide and conquer us, maybe get somebody to stir some shit up, find a weak spot, but guess what?  Been there, blew up that airport, not doing it again.”
"Makes you hard," Natasha gasps, sassing Clint back even as he works her bare ass red with his belt.
- all finished eating quickly and disappeared off to presumably do adult things (Tony tried not to think about how much he knew about Clint’s massive stash of condoms) and left their dishes behind.  “Unbelievable,” Tony grumbled, carrying everything to the sink.  “Am I stuck being the dad forever or something?”
“If you’ll excuse me,” Steve said abruptly, standing up and smiling tightly at Peggy.  She smiled back and then turned back to Shirley, and their voices faded away as he wound through the busy restaurant and burst into the restroom.
He went sprawling, a tangle of scrawny arms and knobbly knees that was about as far from the peak of human perfection as anything Tony had ever seen.  It wasn’t
He pulled out his wallet and dropped a few crumpled bills on the table, then pushed himself out of the booth and headed for the door.  The bell tinkled behind him, and he walked half a mile before he looked up to see Tony trailing along beside him.
Steve looks back over his shoulder, but there’s nobody behind him, and he’s about to open his mouth to ask Sitwell what the big idea is when Sitwell stops dead in the center of the sidewalk.
“That’s because I’m the adult and you’re the kid,” Tony said.  “If I ever get turned into a teenager, you can make up as many rules as you want for me.  Bruce, can you please pass the salad?  Clint, elbows off the table, circus table manners don’t apply here.  Thor, slow down, buddy, it’s not going anywhere.”
“Thanks, Scott, that’d be super helpful,” Steve says.  “Anything more official?  No?  In that case, pass the cookies, Peter.”
Her blue eyes meet his. "How many pages did you have to read before you knew you were reading your favorite book?"
funny, Tony told himself firmly.  The other kids all seemed to be telling themselves the same thing, with mixed success if the choked giggles filling the room were any sign.
“What if I took it off your hands?” Stark says.  “I’ll give you 10 g’s.  No clean-up tonight, and I’ll bring the place into line.  Plus 12 percent to you, right off the top, before expenses.”
“Really,” Tony said disbelievingly.  “Tomorrow’s the end of the world, and you had nothing better to do than steam a bunch of broccoli?  You do know about Pornhub, right?”
Steve turns slowly.  Banner hovers in the doorway; he's wearing his jacket but no hat, and his too-long hair curls around his collar.
"Skiing?" Tony's hand creeps higher, the tips of his fingers sliding over Steve's hip bone, sweeping around the curve of his ass.  "Nah.  You'd be good at it."
"No." She pulls away, just enough to look him in the eyes. "Now you listen. You've been warning me off you since we met, but since we met you've also seen me fight an entire room full of made guys, fend off multiple hostile takeover attempts on my bar, set Tony Stark up with what I think might actually be a genuine war hero, and I'm also pretty sure you watched me with my bartender and my security guy at the same time. Unless that wasn't you in the stairwell that night, in which case," and here she ducks gently to catch Bruce's gaze again as he squirms, "I also sleep with my bartender and my security guy at the same time. Whatever you're hiding from me," and here, she has to do the gaze-catching trick again, because he's swiveling around the room like he wants to hide under the furniture. "
Steve looks around; the street is busy, and nobody’s paying any attention.  The man holding open the door looks hopeful.
“Uh, I don’t know, maybe he had a bad relationship with his father?” Peter says, wrapping up a clawed arm in webbing.
“I’d be happy to,” Steve says.  “It might be nice to get out of the city, in fact.  If I’m invited, that is.”
They all lie through their teeth to SHIELD and Congress and the WSC about how they did it, lock away the quantum machine and make up some story that Carol says pretty much checks out, if you don’t know too much about space and the causal nature of reality.
“Buncha scientists who couldn’t even hold a tommy gun the right way up,” Clint says with a shrug.  “You?”
“Track both,” Tony says.  “I’m grounded for another couple of minutes but I’ll meet you in the sky when I can.  I’ll have the local cops do a sweep of the grounds, maybe they’re still here.  Cops are on their way over, Spidey, cover up.”
“Okay, boys, settle down,” Natasha soothed.  “None of this matters because we’re listening to Destiny’s Child.”
“It’s just funny, hearing that come out of your mouth,” Steve said.  “You never would have told me to go easy on myself.  If anything, I never took
“They just like to make trouble,” Thor says, handing Banner his ice water.  “Throw their weight around, try to act like they’re tough.  The Black Widow’s been running for two years and never paid a bribe yet.”
Steve takes the cigarette from Tony's mouth and puts it out carefully on the balconet's railing.  "Nothing," he says, and when he crushes his mouth to Tony's he tastes nothing at all.
“Okay, moving right along,” Tony said, yanking Steve into his bedroom and slamming the door behind him.  “So this is my bedroom, you’ve been here before but never under these
For the first time, Steve looks at him.  “Seems like she was pretty good the other day,” he says, so casually that if Tony didn’t know him so well he’d miss it, but it turns out he
Tony, who is clearly currently making sweet sweet love to the Mark LIV, raises his eyebrows.  “Nope.”
"Prove it," Natasha says, just to goad him, and is rewarded with a hand in the hair at the nape of her neck, the silvery sound of a zipper, and finally a long slow thick slide, pressing inside of her. She groans in satisfaction and relief as he begins to stroke her, tugging her into an arched pose by the hair.
“Honestly?  Yes,” Stark says.  “That was a little bit of a letdown.  I was expecting my first time arranging a bribe to really get the blood flowing.”
"Well, you've got good instincts, then," Stark says.  He shoves his hands in his pockets and takes another step forward.  "Natasha's good people.  I don't want anything to happen to her or this place, and if anything does, I know exactly who to look for."
without revealing that he’s Spiderman, and it would be a really bad time for that because it’s midterms next week and -
“Well, as much as I’d like to contribute to that in exactly the way I hope you’re envisioning - by which I mean loud sex, was that clear?”
“Get anything good?” Natasha asks as she follows him through the winding hallway and out to the front of the building.
“I’m saying no because it’s - let’s see - well, it’s only, 10:13 pm, and the thing is, I don’t think I want to
“I could pull up each search history and leave blank spaces for searches that were redacted,” JARVIS offered.  “Only the histories since their transformation, of course.”
“Have a good night,” Steve says, watching idly as she tidies up her desk.  Desk duty: who knew sitting around doing nothing could be so exhausting?  He has no idea how long he’ll be out of the bureau’s good graces, but if he gets another stack of dropped off in the morning, he’ll -
Steve doesn't hesitate; he slides out of the Hawk's reach and follows the man in the ridiculous hat to a table in the corner.
Finding Clint at the base of the second flight of stairs, she leans in for a kiss, which he gives her easily. "You're fixing to give that poor shy bastard a heart attack," he breathes into her mouth as she pulls away.
When the shots stop, Steve jumps up and knocks out a third man waiting in the wings, then grabs a nearby chair and uses it to block a fourth coming down the stairs.  “Any chance you know of another way out of here?” he calls out to Stark.  “Oh criminy, put that thing
“Yes!” Thor boomed.  “I’m thankful for Jane, who changed my life so thoroughly with her warm welcome to Midgard.  I’m thankful for my family, who have shown me much patience as I find my way.  And I’m thankful for having a team of such strong warriors to fight alongside.”  He looked around, beaming.  “Oh, and Cheetos!”
"Hey, you wanna close the door, asshole?  You're letting the cold in."  Tony pulls the door shut behind him and crowds up next to Steve as he lights a cigarette.
“Oh, no,” Steve says, gripped with mild horror; how many of Tony’s servants know he spent the night?  “No, I’ll take the subway.  It’s fine.”
"Guess so," Stark says.  He holds out a hand.  "You ever need anything, you know where to find me.  It's the big ugly one a few blocks away."
“That’s why I’ve brought you here today, son,” Pierce says, and for the first time he turns and looks at Steve head on across the backseat of the car.  “I tried to warn you, but you didn’t get the message.  This balance that I’ve created, it’s delicate, and the other night it was disrupted once again.  And, let me tell you, Mr. Vanko wasn’t very happy.”
“Oh, I know,” Peter says.  “I actually - I didn’t mean that.  I mean if you weren’t okay about that, then we could talk about that, but actually I meant - what’s going on with you and Cap?”
Tony jogs toward him.  “Nah, Spidey’s got the rest of clean up covered.  Benefit of having junior team members, right?  They talk to the cops.”
just go on Anderson Cooper and explain what happened.  The problem, of course, is that while the story the press is telling is pretty bad, the real story isn’t that much better.  The two versions share the most important essential truth, anyway, which is that there’s no rendition where Tony gets it right.
Steve has plenty, but none of them are relevant to why he's here in the first place.  "I'm here on my own business.  I appreciate you helping me out back there with the Hawk, but I need to get back to it."
“I didn’t say anything about the rest of you,” Tony said.  “You’re welcome to celebrate the traditional American values of overeating and imperialism however you want.”
, and that’s how he ended up standing alone in the hallway of Stark Tower glaring at five closed doors and wondering how the hell he was going to get five teenaged Avengers to eat dinner.
“So what’s your deal?” Clint said, shoving the chips into Thor’s hands and throwing himself down on the floor in the middle of the room.  “Are you, like, our boss or something?”
“You’ve got to be joking,” Tony said.  “Nobody thinks that.  For one thing, the beard is completely different.”
Steve’s eyes hardened.  “That’s what I thought.  If you don’t mind, I’ll just get back to Brooklyn.  Good luck with getting all the others to grow up.”
The view is even more spectacular than it was at night.  The swimming pool glitters, and the lawn beyond it looks like it’d be real nice if it wasn’t littered with broken glass and left-behind shoes and confetti, and geez louise, when had
“Yeah, your office is bigger than last time I saw it,” Tony said, peering out the window.  “Great view of the parking lot.  What are you driving these days?”
Tony’s got everything queued up when Steve arrives, and he plays the whole scene through twice before Steve looks up at him, frowning, and says, “What am I looking for?”
not to stare) and grabbed a towel from the pile but did not, and Tony couldn’t help but wonder if it was strategic, use it to cover literally anything.  “I think I’m done for the night.  Uh, unless you wanted to go in the hot tub, Tony - ”
“It wasn’t my calling,” Tony says.  “You know, I really never thought I’d have kids, never planned on it, planned pretty hard
The way Steve’s mouth opens for him is a surprise and a long time coming all at once; a contradiction, just like the two of them.  It seems impossible that everything between them could have led to this moment, kissing like teenagers across Tony’s gear shift, and Steve must be thinking it too because he laughs against Tony’s lips, a low, quiet laugh that Tony’s never been allowed to hear before.
“It’ll blow over by tomorrow,” Bruce says.  He claps Tony on the shoulder.  “Stay off Twitter tonight, yeah?”
“Tough crowd.  Look, I just want to say, it wasn’t anything, all right?  With Nicola, I mean,” Tony says, and damn, when did he stop being smooth?  He was famous for it, there were articles in Esquire about his legendary smoothness, for chrissakes.  “It was - stupid, and I didn’t think, with you, you’d said - it wasn’t a thing, is what I’m saying.  It’s not a thing.  There is no thing.”
“They’re finishing up with the parking garage, but the Borgata security chief is opposed to room by room searches,” Tony says.  “Apparently rousting people out of their Atlantic City hotel room on a Friday evening isn’t considered the utmost in hospitality.”
Tony glances at him.  He’s looking out the window, the wind ruffling his hair, sunglasses on.  Steve is like a river - calm on the surface, but with depths beneath that you can’t necessarily see until you dive in, and Tony - Tony thinks he wants to jump.
Steve tossed the one he was holding in Tony’s direction.  “Tony’s not comfortable with nudity,” he whispered conspiratorially to Clint and Natasha.
The answer, it turned out, was “enough” - baseball caps did a lot of heavy lifting for high schoolers - and before long Tony was rushing Steve, Bruce and Clint into the back of a Range Rover and thanking the god of scheduling it wasn’t Happy’s day off.
“Tell me about it,” Steve said dryly.  He took the elixir bottle out of his pocket and took another long swallow.  “That was probably a bad idea.”
“I’m pretty sure of the two surprising things going on here, you being alive is the bigger one,” Tony said.
"I hope not," Natasha says, and pulls Clint's tie from its clip. "I want you to see him go down on me first."
Stark snorts.  "All right, Aldrich, we get the picture, you wanna take this little show of strength to somebody who cares?"
Tony considered him.  “That makes sense.  You gave up a lot.  Your friends.  Your job.  Internet porn.”
“Brooklyn,” Friday says, “but it was taken 45 minutes ago, the story just broke, it’s all over now, boss - ”
“That’s gonna be tough, considering I’m never careful,” Stark says.  “But I appreciate you looking out.  Happy’ll take you home, if you want.”
Natasha kisses him on the cheek and Bruce goes in for a handshake that he turns into a hug at the last second and Rhodey makes a bunch of spaghetti and Tony, for reasons that aren’t entirely clear, shows up, eats more than his share of pasta, and immediately leaves again.  Steve washes his bike and does his laundry and discovers 48 texts and thirteen voicemails on his phone.  Next time he hits the road, he thinks as he listens to Bruce’s third anxious message, he’ll leave a note.
“It was only a matter of time,” Natasha says, kicking one of the nearest fighters between the legs so hard that Steve winces.
“Mostly I’m just bummed I can’t post any of these videos on Instagram,” Peter says.  “The one of Bruce giving Ned a piggyback ride is pretty incredible.”
“ - been trying to get him out of town, I think it might be good for him,” Rhodey’s saying, and Tony spins around.
Tony pinches him.  "Well, aren't you full of yourself."  His fingers skate up Steve's inner thigh, wrap around the base of Steve's rapidly-hardening cock.  "I'll take you skiing one day.  I still have a chalet in Switzerland.  I think."
The hallway outside Steve’s room is quiet, and suspiciously empty - or not so suspiciously, actually, Tony thinks, not once you realize the surly figure slouched in a folding chair outside room 1408 is the Winter Soldier.  Tony considers his options, glances at his watch, and then walks straight up to the guy and says, “How’s he doing?”
I am going to reprogram all the doors in this house so they don't slam," announced Tony. "If I hear one more slammed door, you’re all in trouble!  Jesus Christ I can't take any more adolescence around here."
“Dude, I can’t believe you two made out!” Clint said, pointing at Natasha and Thor and then bursting into laughter.
Tony took a large gulp of wine and then continued, because hey, why the hell not, “And I don’t say this kind of stuff very often so don’t get used to it, okay?  Thor, I’m thankful that you’re here because, man, you’re a really good time even if your taste in food is garbage.  Natasha, I liked you when you were my PA and the crazy thing is I actually like you
And then Clint yelled, “Cannonball!” and jumped into the water, creating a splash that drenched all of them.
“I thought you said you were bringing bacon,” Clint called, coming down the hall behind Fury with Nat on his heels.
heard of it,” Pierce says, and the other agents laugh again.  One of them jabs the barrel of a pistol between Steve’s shoulderblades.  “Don’t even try to run off, son.  This’ll go much worse for your friends if you do.”
“Well, we saved the world, we deserve a party once in a while,” Tony says.  “How’s the new shield treating you?  I mean, the real test will be in a fight, but - ”
The gin joint is empty when Steve pokes his head inside, dim and hushed like a cathedral. Or a crypt.  He runs a finger along the bar and it comes away clean.  The only sign that the place was just 12 hours ago a hotbed of sin and sinners is the lingering scent of moonshine and the scuffs on the floor.
“I’m sure you don’t,” Pierce says smoothly.  “That’s why I’m going to make sure you get an idea, and fast.”  He leans closer to Steve and smiles.  “You may think you’re untouchable because of what the Army did to you, boy, but nobody’s untouchable.  You’re not untouchable, and neither are your friends.  And when I find them - well, you better hope I don’t, let’s just put it that way.”  He pats Steve on the knee and then leans forward.  “Driver?  Just here, if you don’t mind.”
Natasha considers several possible answers, and settles finally on the truth.  “Most men only have a couple of things on their mind.  You seem to have a lot more than that.  It’s… compelling.”
“So use your security codes to override me,” Tony said.  “Oh, wait.  You can’t.  Because you don’t remember them.  Because you’re a
Natasha had looked at maps of New York, makeup tutorials on YouTube, a website about how to make switchblades, several Madonna videos, and… “best way to roll a joint”.
a half-empty bottle of wine in the middle of the dining room table, which he selflessly stepped in to help finish off.
wanted,” Tony said.  “But if it’s not what you want anymore… what I’m saying is that you have options, okay?”
"Not at all," Stark says, backing away with his hands up.  "Just thought you might want to know, Banner."
“You know,” Tony says, after a long silence, “all that stuff the Ancient One told us, and Strange and his 14 million possibilities, that means there are different versions of us out there, right?  People who are us, kind of, but did all kinds of different things.  So it makes me think - ”
“I mean, Uncle Rhodey made us have dinner together every night, but other than that, pretty much. I saw Peter nap a few times, but I’m pretty sure Isabel’s blood content is just caffeine at this point. I’ve been trying to get them to take breaks, but you know how they are when they study together.” Matt explained, looking more and more drained as he talked, and Tony felt for him, pulling him into a hug.
"You didn't think to check with people first?" Tony chuckled. "You're usually quite the planner." Steve blushed. Could Tony tell something was up?
"Please don't tell me you need something. I'm sorry if that sounds rude, but I have had a long enough day and I still have things I need to finish."
“That’s why there are six pairs, and one that would only fit her.” May laughed and thanked him when he handed her the skates. With that, the three adults helped the kids get their skates on.
“Well, now that we know it was just teenage stupidity, I think being grounded for two weeks from everything ought to be a good punishment.” He said with a goofy grin.
Steve's first attempt at Operation Check Yes or No was... sad, to say the least. Asking Tony to work out with him probably wasn't going to help him achieve “more than teammate” status.
“Time to get the other two,” he said, leading the way to Matt’s room. Opening the door, they saw their two youngest, both looking not their best. Isabel was sitting at the desk, messy bun and glasses on, with a book in one hand, a highlighter in the other, and a pen in her mouth. Peter was staring at sticky notes on a wall that he seemed to be messing with, papers surrounding him on the floor, with his hair a mess and still in his pajamas. Soft classical music was being played in the background, and neither had looked up when their parents entered the room.
“Seriously Natasha, Tony and I can finish cleaning up, you can go to bed,” Steve said, knowing that she purposely wasn’t getting the hint, just to mess with him.
Steve would usually be slightly apprehensive about knocking on a stranger’s door in suburban LA, but, in all honesty, he’s more worried for Bucky.
The guard who leads him to the changing cubicles glances over his shoulder, “Missus couldn’t wait, huh?”
Steve makes a frustrated noise through his teeth, “Please, fuck me, Tony, please, I want-- I need your cock, Tony, please,” Steve begs, shifting, until Tony, finally, finally slips a finger into his ass and sucks the tip of his cock, flicking his tongue against the slit to make him cry out above him.
There’s a certain type of comfort he gets alongside all his personal possessions and the form that declares them officially his and legally obtained. Not homely, not exactly, but like he’s his own man again. He signs the form, slides it under the glass, and receives a manila envelope for his troubles.
“Do you wanna get cleaned up?”  Tony asks, still stroking his hair with one hand and, with the other, tracing his thumb over his cheekbone, fingers splayed over his beard, over a fading bruise.
Amongst the chaos and mayhem, Carol and Nat manage to slip away mostly unnoticed; a baby in a strolling blinks distrustingly up at them as they pass them and their father, who appears to be very engaged in a phone call that seems to have taken a turn for the worst, but aside from that, they’ve made a fairly clean break.
Steve looks gorgeous in the shirt, seams straining to keep in those muscles, playing the part of ‘college art teacher’ the general public think he is. Usually, keeping the identity of the ever-elusive Captain of Brooklyn a secret, only known to his allies and the ones he kills, is a good thing, when Steve had told Tony (a story for another time), he’d thought it was smart - a good way of avoiding the law while enticing fear into his enemies (a mask dehumanises a person) and giving him the ability to perform honeypot missions like these. But today, Tony wants to throw everything and anything he can (including all the very expensive, very custom recording gear he has on him) at this Storm guy.
“Idiot,” Barton says, and Steve doesn’t want to give Tony the satisfaction but he can’t help it, he laughs anyway.
“They heard Stark’s gun go off in Queens,” Natasha says.  “He’s gotta be compensating for something.”
On the drive home Happy talks their ears off about the Mets game that finished while he was waiting with the car, and when they park Tony turns to Steve before he can think better of it and blurts out, “Do you want to come upstairs?”
"A cop?" the man says.  "Yeah, I heard.  What's the technicality?  Special investigator?  Private eye?  I can keep guessing.  Or we could always ask the Hawk what
“It was my playroom.  And it still has a few toys.”  Stark leans down and picks up one of the hunks of metal, which shines brighter than anything else in the room.  “Whaddya think?”
“Really big,” Tony said, because now that the dick was out of the bag, as it were, he wanted to make sure Bruce knew he should be proud of himself.  “We’re talking enormous.  I have measurements, actually.  If you’re interested.”
Everybody knows Aldrich Killian.  He runs half the speakeasies in Manhattan and sells an even higher percentage of the guns, and anybody who tries to stop him usually ends up swimming with the fishes at the bottom of the East River. The FBI's lost three good agents to his men this year alone.
“If anyone could do it, it’s her.  Well, feel free to join the party down here.  Not that it’s much of a party, unless you want a drink?  Of course you don’t, I only offered to be polite, which is kind of out of character for me, admittedly, and I’m going back to work now, so you can turn the game on or whatever, all right, good talk, break!” Tony finished,
Steve opens his mouth to keep going, but before he can say a word Tony cuts in, "All right, we're within three percent of standard Hulk readings, let's call it a day, yeah?"
“Cover his poor virgin ears,” Stark snarks.  “He’s never heard of a good clean government official taking money to look the other way.”
“That’s up to Miss Romanov, of course,” Tony says, sliding the glass across the bar to her.  “It’s her joint, after all.  You want to stay in the game?”
want.  Some days he’s nothing else.  It’s gotten him into trouble more times than he can count, because Tony’s never fucking
And it was easier when Peggy was gone.  They were both committed to preserving the timeline, but Steve couldn’t help pushing against the boundaries little bit, testing the limits of what was safe.  Peggy didn’t say anything, usually, but Steve could sense her disapproval in the stiffness of her spine when he crawled back into bed.
“Nah, he’s actually incapable of lying,” Clint said.  “And he’ll probably just keep spouting things we really don’t need to hear about.  Like on and on and on.  That’s what always happened in the trials that SHIELD definitely never ran.”
, Steve thinks, backing out of the room and slamming the door.  He doesn’t care if the room he just left is literally full, floor to ceiling, with nothing but towels: he has no intention of opening that door again.  He takes a moment to wonder if he’ll ever be able to look Miss Romanov in the eye again, then shakes his head and moves on down the hall.
"Rules were made to be broken," Natasha observes. "I don't even think Stark plays. I just think he was shushed once, as a child."
"We’re ready here," Tony says over the loudspeaker.  He's got all kinds of medical readouts going in the observation room, heart rate and blood pressure and adrenal glands, to see if they can pinpoint what works.  If anything works.
Steve, who hasn’t bothered to put into words why he’s in South Dakota and isn’t particularly interested in trying, takes a sip of his beer.  “I know Hawaii exists.”
“So is this whole city,” Tony says.  “What’s one more bad guy, anyway?  Let him do what he wants.  We can still - ”
They found out that the Hulk had indeed joined Bruce for the ride, and that he was brought out not by rage but by excruciating embarrassment, which Tony discovered when he accidentally walked in on Bruce taking advantage of the internet in the way teenage boys always have and always will.  Luckily, the teenaged Hulk didn’t try to smash anything; unluckily, in his attempts to hide in the closet, he knocked down two doors and severely dented a load-bearing wall.
“Yeah,” Peter says.  He glances at Tony, and then back down.  “It’s just - it seems like it was tough, probably.”
"I can meet him anywhere he wants," Steve says.  "I just need a few minutes with him.  And I think - I think I might be able to help him, too.  Can you tell him that for me?"
, but he doesn’t sound pissed either, so Tony takes it for what it is.  He climbs the stairs two at a time and doesn’t realize until he’s already knocked on Steve’s front door that he doesn’t know what he’s going to say.
“Yeah, exactly, your silence said it all, Cap, I get it, it’s not me it’s you, or hey, maybe it’s me, that’s totally reasonable too - ”
"Sure," Steve says, glancing around.  "You haven't happened to see Banner around tonight, have you?"
,” Steve says, and wraps one big hand around both of them.  They’re slick with Tony’s spit and Steve’s precome, and Tony arches forward, meets Steve on every thrust.  Steve keeps their mouths pressed together like he can’t breathe without Tony’s lips, takes Tony apart with his tongue, and when he comes he
“The kind of spontaneous road trip where you ditch your phone and don’t talk to your team for three and a half weeks?  Didn’t realize that was something we could do.”  Tony waves for another round, and the bartender nearly trips over himself racing to pour it.
Bruce could get by in the kitchen, but everything he made was sad and screamed “bachelor” and “on the run” and Tony tried not to think about it too much.  One day Tony came home to find Bruce heating up some ground beef that he’d bought
“I know you don’t,” Tony interrupts smoothly.  “But that’s what friends do, right?  Looks like you’re up.”  He claps Steve on the shoulder and joins Sam along the wall with the PAs, who all skitter away nervously, like they think maybe he’s going to bite them.
“We missed four, actually,” Tony says.  “I didn’t know what you would want, I had a few options going, don’t worry about it, what’s good around here?”
“You know I try,” Natasha says.  She studies Stark for a second and then decides to go for the throat.  “You heard from Rogers?”
"Suit yourself," Stark says.  "It's too bad, I was about to buy you another drink.  You never know when a dirty cop could come in handy."
Stark shrugs.  “Nah, no kidnappings tonight.  This isn’t business, it’s pleasure.  Maybe a little too much pleasure, actually,” he says, catching a young woman by the elbow as she stumbles up the stairs.
Peter somehow maintains his secret identity long enough to get into Columbia (which is fine with Tony; he didn’t have his heart set on MIT for the kid or anything).  Tony throws him a graduation party at the Tower and invites the team and Aunt May and Peter’s best friend Ned, who stands between Steve and Bruce looking like he’s died and gone to heaven and it’s even better than he expected.  Happy shows up with one of those big head posters, and when Pepper and Morgan leave early so Morgan can sleep in her own bed, Peter gives Morgan a goodbye high five that Tony quietly asks Friday to save to the permanent drive.
"I don't think he's dead," Steve says.  "I think he got mixed up in something he shouldn't have, and I think - I think he may still be out there working for some really bad people.  People that you may have worked for too."
“Uh, yeah, I’m aware, my secretary runs my entire business,” Tony says, rolling his eyes.  “I’m talking about Rogers here failing to notice that his own secretary wasn’t actually working for his organization.  You’re a helluva cop, Rogers.”
“Not even that!” Tony says.  “We’re - we went on what was maybe a date.  Maybe two dates, I’m not totally sure, the second one involved more muggings than the term usually implies.  Also I think he tried to hold my hand but I got weird about it.”
“No longer than most,” he replies, accepting the glass but not taking a drink.  “It’s crowded in here tonight.  Any customers giving you trouble?”
“Honestly,” Steve mutters.  Their clothes are in a state of disarray, but luckily they’re still on, for the most part; Steve searches around until he finds a blanket in a cupboard and drapes it gently over all three of them before he heads out the door.
Stark’s eyes slide toward the clockwork man, and Steve follows his gaze, thinking of the armband that blew a hole in the wall the other night at the Black Widow.
"The fact that I just saved you from a pretty thorough beating," the man says.  "Not that you don't look like you can handle yourself, but - "
He’d fought it for so long.  He’d tried to bargain with the universe, tried to change it, but when it came down to it he knew.  He
The door behind them slams open again, and Thor tumbles through, Bruce hot on his heels.  “Natasha!” Bruce says, looking stricken.  “You have to - ”
"Not my fault your pitcher doesn't have his head in the game," Natasha said, brushing dust from her thigh.
“I’m sorry, am I getting a lecture from the guy who actually invented time travel?” Steve said archly.  “Even for you, that’s pretty - ”
“Anything interesting?  Not the porn, I don’t need to know about what kind of porn they liked as teenagers, that would be so weird - ”
“Tony, it’s fine,” Pepper says.  Her mouth twists a little, like it always used to when she was trying not to smile.  “It’s kind of funny, is all.  After everything - ”
“Bingo,” Tony says.  “Looks like a monitor with a burned out pixel, right?  But just for an instant, then - gone.”
Or Valkyrie. Why the heiress to the Singer Sewing Machine fortune thinks she can avoid notice with a put-on name like is a mystery, but not the kind of mystery Natasha is particularly interested in unraveling. She would imagine it has something to do with families. "Daddy issues". The kinds of issues, she is told, that other people have. No, that doesn't interest Natasha particularly much. What does interest Natasha is the way Millicent Margaret Ann--ahem, sorry,
“So that’s it,” Steve says.  “You’d rather blow it all up to try to take down some ex-employee with the extremely unique position of wanting to ruin your reputation.  You’d rather jump out of a
There was a moment of silence, and then - loudly - the sounds of five teenagers pounding up the stairs, dropping Xbox controllers, and just generally causing mayhem on their way to the dining room.
want to talk, I’m literally right here.  And so is Natasha.  And so is Bruce, and Rhodey, and Thor when he’s not in space.  But you don’t want to talk to anybody.  You just want to put the whole thing on your own shoulders and let the weight of it crush you until you don’t have to feel anything besides guilt, because you can’t stand the idea of feeling
“That was the last of it, anyway,” Natasha said, grinning.  “We only had twenty bucks left to spend.”
Morgan asks Steve a million questions during the drive out of the city, everything from where he grew up to what kind of pizza he likes to how old he is.  “I’m 40,” Steve says.
Romanov holds his gaze.  "Tell him yourself.  Tomorrow, 3 o'clock, before the bar opens.  The door'll be unlocked."
“What’s all the noise?” Bruce said around a yawn as he traipsed into the kitchen.  He peered into the microwave.  “Is that nachos?”
“Bringing somebody out of the quantum realm is a lot harder than going to space,” Bruce said.  “Bringing somebody
Steve nods, and crosses the room to take the seat at the bar as far from the muscle as possible.  It's not that he's nervous - if the muscle wants trouble, he probably has more to fear than Steve does - but he'd prefer not to be too memorable if he ever comes back under different circumstances.
The driver pulls up next to an alley, and the car rolls to a stop.  Behind them, Steve hears the second car pull up to the curb and cut the engine.
,” Clint said, sliding away from Natasha’s pointy elbow.  “I mean, that sucks and is definitely not funny at all.  Your life is a tragedy.”
“Oh, and I have a note here from Fury.”  Coulson pulled out a folded up piece of paper.   “Don’t let anybody get anybody pregnant.”
“Better him than me,” Steve says agreeably.  He’s not in uniform, just jeans and a t-shirt that have, somehow, stayed perfectly untouched despite the mutant octopus fight, and he’s got the shield on his arm and he looks - well, it’s not relevant, really, Tony decides, no reason to wander down that path, am I right?
“I wouldn’t say that, sir,” Rogers says, his voice clear as a bell in the dim room.  Clint’s face contorts, and Stark rears back so quickly that he almost slams into the wall.  “I just came here looking for a lead - ”
“But then again,” Killian says lightly, “we’ve got plenty of practice getting blood out of just about anything, so really it’s up to you.”
And it’s not until Steve’s cleaned up the Shake Shack detritus and said goodbye to Sam and gone back to Brooklyn that Tony realizes that maybe, just maybe, Steve was
how broad those shoulders are - but looking at him like this is different and the only part of it that’s actually surprising is how much Tony actually just wants to look at his face.  Because Steve looks so
Tony would like the record to reflect that what he’s been building isn’t an all-knowing, all-seeing artificial intelligence.  Been there, done that, created that superbot; he makes a lot of mistakes, sure, but he doesn’t make most of them twice.
The dial tone knocks Steve out of his sombre thoughts and Natasha’s hand on his elbow drags him away, “You’re making me see James for the first time in two years, you better be 100% about this.”
He takes a second to admire the Draper, a second to revel in the fact that he’ll soon be the owner of it and no-one would be the wiser. It’s a good feeling. Peggy tells him to get a move on.
They’re in a supply closet, because that’s how their flirting climaxed; one heated look and a strategically placed closet.
They make it back to base, drop their stuff, then to Steve’s apartment, where Steve leads them to the dining table.
A long time ago, Bruce Wayne had been jealous of Tony Stark. Not when their companies were competing and Wayne Enterprises stock dipped below Stark Industries, or when he was ahead in clean energy, not when he had parents and he didn’t, not when it seemed like the world had put so much damn responsibility on Bruce’s shoulders and next to none on Tony’s, but the way he’d looked at life, the way he’d stared it right in the face, grinned and taunted it to challenge him, throw whatever it could toward him, and a constant promise that he’d be there, throwing something right back.
Steve’s lips are the sole focus of Tony’s gaze now, delightfully pink and bright, his tongue flashes, just as pink and bright, in his mouth. Tony knows he’s a goner when he meets Steve’s eyes again, lust blown and heady, like what he’s doing turns him on as much as it does Tony.
He hands the godawful orange fatigues to the guard, who leads him to the gates, the precipice of freedom. He lingers there for a moment after the gates grind open, hovering, letting the wind whistle past. The world out there isn’t pretty, and the view isn’t particularly pleasant - being on the inside for so long had almost allowed him to forget that he’d spent the last two years of his life in New Jersey. Almost. The glaring, graffitied sign to his right reminds him immediately.
They walk to the car in silence and both slip into the back. Bruce is thankful that he asked Alfred to drive them. He’s not sure that he, or Dick, could’ve driven safely.
“Don’t talk to her like that,” Rhodes cuts in, stepping in between Pepper and the car, “we just want to make sure that you’re not planning anything that’s going to leave Tony hurt again.”
Among the hum of conversation, the dings and the thunks of the slots, the whir of shuffled cards, the splash of a drink… in the buzz of a casino, he's home. As close to the general concept of it as he’ll ever get in the absence of Tony, anyway.
“I love you,” he whispers, after JARVIS had dimmed the lights, running his hand through his clean, vanilla-scented hair - he was probably due for a cut, but he looked more boyish and carefree with his hair falling into his eyes and easier into disarray. It was a good look on him.
Tony nods, following Steve’s lead. He’s learned that when he gets like this, back ramrod straight and a steely expression in his eyes, it’s best to listen, follow, and take note of their surroundings. The bar they’re in is in a seedy part of town, lit by a couple low-watt bulbs and utterly crowded, so he can’t really do the last part, but Steve’s presumably found or saw danger.
Sam pats Steve’s shoulder in the way one would to mollify a distraught child, “You’ll catch up on the modern lingo soon.”
He thinks Steve huffs a laugh, but it could have been a cough, but it doesn’t matter, he’s close enough to gather him in his arms. His eyes are blown wide in pain and falling shut.
Steve mumbles something he can’t make out and wraps his arms around Tony’s waist and buries his head in his chest. Tony rests a hand in his hair, spreading his fingers through the strands, and presses a kiss to the top of his head when he makes a contented noise, calm and at ease.
card, but no one here would believe it. He’d clashed with them long before prison had any effect on his manners.
hm. soft and slightly jaded stevetony to make up for the previous lack thereof. thought u deserved it xx
“Why not? Maybe because you could go back inside? Because the Asgard vault isn’t a little painting? Because you full well know that if you get caught Laufeyson won’t just come for you, he’ll come for your entire livelihood.”
Tony huffs a laugh, “Well, if you must know, my secretary thinks it’s good I make international appearances, good for the company and all that.” Steve decides to not press him on the Stark Industries issue, sure he knows who Tony Stark of Stark Industries is, everyone does, but right now, he’s far more interested in the guy in front of him who’s still yet to grace them with his uncovered eyes. “Now your turn.”
Overtop the New York Times he’s pretending to read, Steve watches the faceless clock tick slowly closer to one - there’s still a couple minutes and Natasha doesn’t believe in being early. He scans the front page: plans to raze one of Fury’s - well, Loki’s now - hotels, accompanied by a picture of a scowling Fury (not that he has any other faces, Steve’s pretty sure he’s seen him smile exactly once when he got too into character in the Looky-Loo they pulled in Belgium) and another picture of Loki, with Tony at his arm, radiating smugness and generic assholery.
“I really don’t mind. Promise,” Tony assures, leaning over the table to kiss him soundly, and if later, when they have relationship-affirming sex, Tony leaves more hickeys on him than usual... well it gives Steve’s students something to razz him about.
At her look, Steve can’t stop himself from grinning and something else settles in him. He’s missed this, God, he’s missed this. He pulls a bill from his wallet, tucks it under the glass and gets up, “You coming?”
Tony just had the pleasure of being doused in a gas (thank you, Mr. Mxyzptlk) that forced him to spill all his thoughts in the past six hours, in hopes that he’d blurt out Stark Industries trade secrets on megaphone to the entire eastern seaboard, however, Superman, his, as the ever-credible Daily Planet like to put it on occasion, ‘knight in blue spandex (that really, really leaves deliciously little to the imagination, Tony’ll tell you) and fluttering red cape’, came and saved the day and any potential secrets from being found out.
Sam gives him a time-check when he’s made a lap of the gallery and has a nice stack of contact cards from wealthy people - if they still have time in the UK after this, Steve might pitch another con, some of those people could stand to lose something, maybe the guy who’d groped him, winked, and offered to show him ‘his Manet’ (although they were standing in front of a Monet, but that’s neither here nor there), or maybe the woman who’d complained for an inordinate amount of time about the influx of immigrants and how they were a detriment to the economy, thanking him for not being ‘like them’ - regardless, he still has ten minutes left until Sam cuts the power. Time for more socialising!
Bucky completely steamrolls over him, “–to take from the Fort Knox of casinos? Why? And don’t fucking say money ‘cause we both know that’s not it.”
Fury pauses for a second. He knows exactly why Steve and his little, soon to be expanded, gang came to him: he has money, an entirely justified vendetta against the greasy little fucker, and incredibly misplaced trust in Steve Rogers.
“I need him, and you. And a few more people,” he doesn’t want to say his plan directly to her when they’re like this; alone with no witnesses. She could see through him clearer than even Bucky, probably better than Tony could as well.
“Thank you. Mr. Rogers, the purpose of this meeting is to determine whether, if released, you are likely to break the law again. While this was your first conviction, you have been implicated, though never charged, in over a dozen other confidence schemes and frauds. What can you tell us about this?”
“If released,” finally, the last one speaks, the one closest to the door, “is it likely you would fall back into a similar pattern?”
“If things go to plan, I won't be the one who has to make that choice,” Steve says, quietly, simply. Some days, he just wants to take the man he calls his best friend and hit him over the head with a brick.
“Oh, c’mon, you go in there and by the time the strippers change sets you and James are going to end up punching it out over the bar,” Natasha reasons.
. He’s trying to hide it by facing away, looking out the window, but his shaking shoulders and the tears that glisten on his jaw give it away.
“But where are you even going to get the money to back this? Off the top of my head, I'd say we’re looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros, and a Leon Spinks. And probably the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever.” Nat asks, cutting him off. Plans are all well and good but they’re worth jack if they don’t have the capital, and last she checked, none of them are millionaires. Yet.
Bucky gives him a withering look. They’ve known each other long enough that Steve’s fully aware that if he’s not serious Bucky will walk straight out the door.
Banner takes a swig of tonic water.  "I'm not sure what you're looking for, but you should know that my connections to - certain people aren't what they used to be."
Tony pulls a bottle of bourbon out from behind the bar - he must have brought it from home, considering almost every bottle in the place shattered when his bomb went off - and pours a healthy glass.  “Well, hey, if it’s gonna be a bar again, I’m just saying, the alley’s fine and all but this could be a classy establishment - ”
Steve wonders if Tony is setting mines on purpose, if he hopes that Steve will step on one and blow the whole night up in their faces.  "Is it hard?"
“Hope I didn’t interrupt anything,” Clint says, pulling his knife out of the back of the man’s neck.
“True love?” Tony said.  “I’m kidding, it’s quantum entanglement.  We traveled through the quantum realm together a couple times, probably swapped a few electrons, things get really messy at the subatomic level.  Are you freaking out?  It’s okay if you want to freak out.”
“I never intended to tell you that,” Steve said seriously.  “I know you don’t feel the same way and the last thing I would ever want to do would be to ruin our friendship and working relationship, I - ”
“I’ll do my best,” Tony says.  “And, you know, my best is pretty great, so there’s probably nothing to worry about.”
Tony narrows his eyes.  “Don’t you have homework to do?  I feel like I remember some kid in here not 30 minutes ago whining about how much he has to turn in tomorrow...”
- well, Tony had been about to say “not even Steve”, but apparently he was wrong because he’d barely even hit the hallway when Steve caught up to him.
The room was quiet for a long, peaceful moment.  Tony’s breathing slowly returned to normal, and Steve was a warm, comfortable, sweaty weight on top of him, and Tony didn’t really have any urge to move at all.  And then -
“Eh, the past’s not so bad,” Tony said. “Things are simpler.  Not so many channels on TV.  Less traffic.  And there’s this guy whose bed I hang out in sometimes.  So, you know.”
Maria Hill took slightly more pity on him.  She confirmed that SHIELD was researching the magic at play and they were “pretty sure” the effects were temporary (which, wow, talk about reassuring), and then she ordered fifteen pizzas, and
Smoke hangs heavy in the air, and Steve can guess that everyone else’s ears are still ringing, but his feel fine, which means now’s his chance: he elbows one of his keepers in the gut, then grabs the gun from his hand and swings around to knock the other out with a blow to the temple.
Natasha spins around with a smile.  The man with the gaping knife wound in his hand drags himself out of the front room, fiddling with a pistol.
Morgan shrugs, and Tony heads for the kitchen optimistically.  “Morning,” Steve says, catching up with him at the stove and passing over a plate of still-warm pancakes.  “You said I should stop by today, and I thought - sorry if it was too early, or - ”
“Well,” Tony says.  “Guess there’s no point hanging around here when the party’s out there, am I right?  Catch you later.”
“Nobody else can hear me when I talk to them,” Tony said, a little distantly.  “Did you really just use the word ‘crush’?”
“Damn it,” Tony murmurs, pulling out his phone to call Happy and looking around for a street sign to give him.  Hopefully he hasn’t gone too far, Tony’s only made it to -
The boys behind Pierce laugh.  “Sir,” Steve starts, numbly, even though he has no idea what he’s going to say, “they don’t - they have nothing to do with - ”
There’s a clatter from above, and they both tense as somebody hurtles down the stairs.  “Let’s get out of here,” Banner says breathlessly, a sack thrown over his shoulder.
It’s all heat and noise and chaos, like a bomb went off in the center of the room, and even Steve is rattled enough that it takes half a second before he realizes that the force of the shot, which came out of one of the clockwork man’s arms, blew Tony across the room and straight through the back wall.  Through the smoke, Steve can just see the clockwork man lying in the rubble, perfectly still.
him for something?  He honestly can’t think what it could be; did he send an inappropriate gif to their group chat?  He doesn’t remember doing anything that could -
"So," the bartender says cheerfully, "what's a law enforcement officer like yourself doing in a place like this?"
“He’s right,” Tony said.  “This should be impossible.  It took Hank Pym thirty years to ge his wife out of here.  Then again, he may be smart, but he’s no
“You too,” Steve says.  He takes a sip of champagne and looks around, trying to spot Stark in the crowd as the band starts up again.  Pretty dumb of him, showing up to a party where he’s not sure he knows anyone besides the host; he probably won’t see Stark again for the whole night, and even if he did, it’s not like he has much to say to -
“We’re getting word of some kind of robotic militia in Sokovia,” Bruce says.  He sounds apologetic.  “Wanda’s already there, she says it’s getting ugly.  You don’t have to come, we can probably - but I thought, with Thor back in space, we’d ask if - ”
Tony finds a house that once belonged to a hobby welder. Steve arrives on his motorcycle four hours of stop-and-go traffic later and finds the house with the kicked-in door and the welding sizzle coming from the backyard.
“He’s awake,” Barnes says, standing up quickly.  Tony doesn’t bother asking how he knows - fucking supersoldier hearing, probably - and follows him into the room.
“I can’t believe I ever thought you were in my head,” Steve said.  “I never could have made up how annoying you are.”
“I’m not capable of conspiracy,” JARVIS reminded him, “and, technically, you never revoked their power to ask me not to inform you of something, a right granted to all permanent residents of the Tower.”
“Uh - yeah,” Santa said, in an embarrassing character break.  “Was there - something you needed, Captain America?”
"Dr. Bruce Banner," Stark says.  "PhD from Columbia in chemistry, Army science division from '14 through '19.  Got mixed up in something messy with the daughter of a colonel, then dropped off the map for a while.  Word is he spent some time working for Blonsky's operation down in Harlem, but the last couple of years are thin on details."
It’s funny, Tony thinks, how quickly the world moves on.  In the week since Beck, he’d gotten an earful from Rhodey over dinner, a mildly threatening voicemail from Fury, and absolutely nothing at all from Steve, not that he was expecting anything; a few days ago he was the most hated man in Manhattan, and now he can walk down the street with hardly an iPhone hastily snapping pictures in sight.
“Yeah,” Steve said.  He pinched the bridge of his nose.  “I meant to say no.  This stuff is strong.”
Today’s one of those.  They get up early and have breakfast at a diner Morgan loves on 64th and walk back through the park.  When they get back to the penthouse Happy’s there, gathering up Morgan’s schoolbooks and folders and loading them into her backpack, which Tony
Steve wonders what that means, and why, if he doesn't drink, he's risking spending time in a speakeasy, but Steve isn't here to satiate his curiosity about Dr. Bruce Banner.  He's here for answers.  "I need to talk to you about something."
The door behind the bar swings open, and Miss Romanov walks out, looking supremely unconcerned.  "Can I get you a drink, Mr. Killian?"
“Probably a lot,” Steve said.  “But at least I don’t wear open collar shirts that are way too young for me.”
“I’m not the one who made her pancakes with - am I tasting chocolate chips in here?  You really gave my child chocolate for breakfast?”
“Jesus christ, I’m not doing a speech, would you all shut up?” Tony said.  “I just want to say thanks to whoever cooked because I ate the last frozen pizza for lunch so I would have been hungry otherwise.  You guys suck and I hate you.  Let’s eat.”
, and they definitely wouldn’t go on a date because they’re friends, sure, but only just, and it’s not like Steve could be
“I’m not really a stuffing person,” Tony said with a shrug.  “Gotta keep it tight, the suit doesn’t exactly have an elastic waistband.”
wanted to freeze, he wanted to freeze and then run down to his lab and invent a time machine and go back in time five minutes and stop himself from talking
“You have a smudge,” Natasha said, and then - and Steve wouldn’t have believed it if he hadn’t seen it with his own two eyes - she licked her thumb and reached out to rub Bruce’s chin.
“Pretty sure it’s brand new, sir,” Natasha said, while Clint gave Tony a very enthusiastic thumbs up from behind her back.
He shoves his drink across the bar and picks up his hat.  Nobody looks up as he slides through the crowd, murmuring "pardon" as he squeezes past dancing couples and into the hallway.
Tony thunked his head on the table.  All the technology he’d invented and he still couldn’t recall texts on command.  What was the point of being a genius if you couldn’t even -
Tony licks a stripe down Steve's cock, then slides his fingers out of Steve's ass and sits back on his heels.  "You know," he says, pushing Steve's legs open and yanking him forward by the hips, lining his cock up, "this would be so much easier if you just did as you were told.  What do you say?"
The speakeasy at the bottom of the stairs is a lot like the ones he's seen before, though without all the bullet holes in the walls.  It's dusk, and though a few tables are occupied the bar's empty.
Back in New York after the night in Florida, Steve works out and leads neighborhood meetings in Brooklyn and leaves leftovers in the fridge for Nat and goes with the National Guard when they need extra hands in Houston or Detroit or Portland.  The riots have quieted down, for the most part, but there are still periodic food shortages and Steve's been on tour before, so it feels familiar enough.  Someone in Reno throws a hot coffee back in his face when they realize who handed it to them, and Steve wipes his face on his shirt and hands a coffee to the next person in line while local law enforcement drags the woman away.  She keeps screaming at him until she's all the way out the door.
“Well why didn’t you say so?” Tony said, grabbing a handful of Steve’s hair between his fingers and giving it a solid tug.  “Anything else you want to tell me, soldier?”
“Can you take over up here, Sam?” Steve says over the whir of the engines, and Sam unhooks his flight suit and slides into the co-pilot’s seat.  They ascend rapidly, and Steve hangs on to the grab bar as he stalks down the Quinjet toward Tony.  “What happened down there?”
“Then we’ll be there to make sure you don’t have to get started,” Clint says, jerking his head toward Thor.  “You’ll be on intel gathering only, Doc.”
Natasha turns around; behind her, a man with fists like wrecking balls thunders down the hallway.  She doesn’t even have time to consider whether to go for the knees or the solar plexus before Banner grabs the man by the collar and slams him up against the wall.
Steve glanced at him, then looked back across the otherwise-empty platform.  “I don’t mind the rain.”
Vanko turns to one of his men.  “Get up there and see what’s going on.”  He turns back to Natasha with narrowed eyes.  “You were saying, miss?”
“And miss all the fun?” Stark says, pushing up his sleeves as another man advances.  “You look like just the kind of fella who enjoys scientific investigation.  Care to help me out with an experiment?”
Steve wondered, occasionally, how many more years it would be until CT scans were available.  Not that he could ever get one, but still.
“I just,” Tony said, as the countdown started flashing out of the corner of Steve’s eye, but Steve wasn’t looking, because all he wanted to look at was Tony, “yeah, if it doesn’t work, I just want to say - ”
It’s Rhodey, and then it’s the head of Legal, and then it’s Pepper, and then it’s the entire PR firm he keeps on 24-hour retainer for moments exactly like this, and then it’s Rhodey again.
"I thought you were in Geneva this week," Steve says, stuffing a pillow into a threadbare pillowcase.  He strips the bed before they leave, re-makes it with whatever clean sheets he can find, always, just in case someone comes home, even though Tony always says there's no point.  Tony does his research.
“I hate you, but maybe,” Tony says.  “We haven’t even kissed!  I don’t even know if he wants to kiss me.  I mean, at first I was like, I’m definitely misinterpreting this, because he’s always been straight, or whatever, and even if he’s not it’s
“Yes,” Tony said, “definitely, whenever, any time, later is good, now would be better but considering we’re in the middle of an inning - ”
“You take plenty of advantage of my chauffeur in 20 years, Barton,” Tony snapped as the other kids, even Bruce, followed along.  “Bruce, don’t betray me like this, we are
"It has to be personal," he says.  They're seated around the big table at the base, the one where they all used to fit back when there were more of them.  Nobody's ever talked about taking away any of the chairs.
It’s not even remotely weird, Tony thinks as he pushes Steve onto his bed.  There’s a lot to look at - not that Tony hasn’t seen it before because hell, he makes the guy’s uniform, he knows
“Well that got dark,” Clint said.  “All right, Tony, you can’t wiggle out of this one.  Put the yams down and spill.”
“What are we talking about?” Clint asked, his and Thor’s battle to the death over key lime deliciousness apparently resolved.
.  You really know how to warm a fella’s heart.”  Stark knocks his shoulder against Steve’s.  “It’s nice to be on a team for once.”
“Hey, we all have childhood heroes,” Tony said.  “I’m just one of the few who was unlucky enough to meet mine.”
Steve whirls around to see Stark, his hip cocked against the bar and a sly grin on his face.  "Pardon me?"
“So here’s the thing,” Tony said.  “I kind of want to kiss you again.  Not right now, because my mouth tastes like something out of Thor’s cookbook of nightmares, I’m pretty sure my teeth have
“Eh,” Steve said.  “You know.  And a couple of the Howlies - well, fellas got up to what they got up to.  What they still get up to.  Fine by me.”
It was, in the end, just another thing to add to the list, long and ever-growing, of Things He Hid From Peggy.
Natasha showed up first.  Her hands were bright pink and scrubbed raw, and Steve could tell she’d been checking their weapons over and over since they’d wrapped their last pre-mission meeting.  She leaned in and sniffed at the potatoes he was mashing.
“Don’t move,” Sitwell says under his breath as a car pulls up smoothly beside them.  Steve can see his hand resting lightly over his holster.
“No,” Tony said, snatching a Princess Leia Funko Pop out of Thor’s hand and putting it back on the shelf.  “You sneak out, you don’t get any toys.”
Tony set a pace that was brutal but not punishing, his dick sliding in and out of Steve’s mouth with a filthy, wet sound.  It was so hot, knowing that Steve could, at literally any moment, push Tony away, knock him down and stop him from fucking Steve’s perfect mouth, with no more effort than it would take to tie his shoe - but instead he was swallowing around his cock, letting Tony hit the back of his throat and then some, his pupils blown wide and spit dripping down his chin.
“Oh, come on,” Clint said.  He pulled on a Slipknot beanie and grinned.  “This stuff is awesome.  And didn’t you say this was a charity shopping trip?”
"I'd prefer not to have to get rid of any bodies tonight, if you don't mind," Barton says, holding his hands out like he's calming a wild horse.
“Good thing that’s not why I did it,” Steve says, and when he catches Tony’s gaze he holds it until Tony looks away.
Peter points up, and Tony sees the Quinjet hovering above them.  “I thought we were coming to fight an elemental, but now I feel like I have no idea what’s going on.”
He’s half expecting him to jump out of the bushes with a grin and tell the crowd not to be so sombre, it’s a lovely day, after all.
Sam looks over it. Steve was right about it there being a lot of security, it’s looks like just about the least accessible vault ever designed, and that’s without the guards. “The… Asgard vault?”
“You’re going to give me grey hair, you know that?” Clark greets, dumping his things by his doorstep. He can practically hear his ma telling him the hook for his bag is just a couple feet away, but he’s far more interested in Tony, on his second-hand couch, wearing his old Metropolis University sweatshirt.
