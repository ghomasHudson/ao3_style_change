! Hydra's servants?" The king said loudly, nearly shouting, which made the people behind him jump and back away from the bars, even the guard flee, fearing that he will be killed if he stayed and the king spotted him.
Bucky Barnes, the one that Tony wanted to hate and despise, but he didn't have the heart to hate an innocent person that suffered by Hydra's hands, he read the files Edith was able to hack from Hydra, and he saw the torture videos, and if he did hate Barnes for stealing his love, after seeing those videos every hate he held for the poor Omega vanished, and turned to the source that deserves it, which was Rogers, for it was the bastard who played Tony's heart, and on top of that, he was the one who wanted to get back the relationship he always had with the still brain-damaged Omega that was once Bucky Barnes, didn't Rogers know that his mate doesn't even know the meaning of the word 'No'? And that he needed a lot of therapy and help before the two of them can be left alone in the same room or else something can trigger that poor Omega who looks more like a lifeless puppet than a person.
Tony grumbled to himself as he hammered into the armor, growling when he saw a part of the armor being ripped off, it was all because of that stupid cat and its harder than steel bite. Tony actually couldn't believe that the cat was able to rip into his armor by using its teeth and claws.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, confusion, a little bit of violence, and Steven screaming his head off with Peggy! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Reaching the stairs, Tony froze in his place when he glimpses someone walking near the stairs, brawling the first floor before they no doubt reach the second floor; now with panic followed by adrenaline, Tony rushed toward his babies his breath hitching as he tried to stay calm and not tip whoever was inside that he was aware of them being here.
After that day, Tony finally saw Pepper, Happy and Rhodey, all of them with tears running down their faces; he remembered getting lots of visitors, and not even turning his face toward them, he remembered that he screamed at his father every time he entered the room begging him to give him his baby back, he remembered how he screamed the day he saw Stane in his room, nearly attacking the man ready to kill him if it weren't for the nurses and the doctors sedating him, he remembered how he hated his father more and more when he gave him his baby's death certificate.
Two hours later; the two of them finally arrived at the mansion, both of them relaxed and content. Steve couldn't help but smile happily when he saw Bucky's face more open and relaxed since he started living with him and Tony, and it made Steve feel like he was able to accomplish something good. The two of them truly enjoyed their day out, exchanging funny stories and moments that happened a long time ago, Bucky finally opened up to him and told him about the art he used to make and about his days in the military, it made Steve truly happy that Bucky was getting out of his shell.
To try and finish as much work as he can, Steven had to function on four hours of sleep, which was tiring and draining on his body, especially with the kind of work the Iron King forced upon him. He has to wake up hours before dawn to start his work, cleaning the place from top to bottom, starting with his bare room which needs a little maintained as it was that the only thing he had in his room was the furs he and his son sleep on and the few pieces of clothes the king 'generously' given to him and his son. Steven always made sure to let his babe sleep for a few more hours before he has to wake him up at Prime when he had to wake the king's son, a strange little boy he was, always silent, a boy of a few words, a shy one at that, who spent all of his time in the gardens with no friends, though his company was far more pleasant than his father's, an Alpha who doesn't know how to treat a babe right unless he was teaching him how to work with fire and metal in the workshop he has in the back of the house, and doesn't even have an Omega to help him take care of the babe, which made Steven pity the child for having a harsh Alpha as a father.
Six months, that's how old his baby was, six months starting today. It will also mark half a year since Tony moved into this strange town, whose everyone in it was too friendly to be real, but maybe that's what was wrong from the start; Tony doesn't believe that people can be good without wanting something in return, maybe that's the whole reason why he was losing his mind in the first place, maybe if he just took a step back everything will be fine.
So what do you think?
Glaring, Steven's hands twitched several times as he tried to calm the fire that roared inside his body; he tried to stop himself from picking the first thing his eyes fell on and breaking it into tiny pieces. A prostitute! The nerve! Alphas were so full of themselves, always thinking that a genuine offer of friendship meant more than what it really was. Foolish brute, uncultured Alpha! As if Steven was ever going to bed someone so brutish and feral, a bastard with no regard for Omegas and their feelings! Steven would kill himself than bed someone like the foolish king, even if he was the last Alpha in this damn land!
But don't worry everything is going to be better… I think…
"No!" Tony shrieked denial and pain echoing in his voice, the thought of that nightmare being real caused Tony to give a pained sob, his hope of running away lying in ruins. "Why, God? Why? What did I do to deserve this?" Tony whined, gazing at the still dark sky, refusing to turn to Steve and see how innocent and happy he was looking while Tony was weeping and losing his mind not a few feet away.
"Jarvis? Is that really you?" Steven asked with caution, after all, he may have to see the butler's pictures and heard some of his stories and adventures from his Tony and Peggy, but seeing the man looking no older than thirty and staring at him was concerning, especially when the only Jarvis, Steven interact with was the AI version of him.
Tony failed his mate eleven years ago, leaving him pregnant and alone without anyone to protect him, leaving him facing the world by himself with no one by his side. Tony failed in protecting his son when he fell sick, he failed him when he met him a year ago and made him cry; Tony was the reason that his son always ended up crying. Tony failed his family a month ago when their own home was invaded by Hydra; he left his love and boy alone, scared, staring at death in the eyes without him being there to protect them, instead it was his father who rescued them. And now, now Tony made the biggest failure in his life; again Tony didn't notice what was going around him, too busy in his workshop, trying to invent the crazy thought that came to him, in the hope of him protecting his family. Look what happened, his son was sick, trying to fight the infection that overcomes because Tony didn't pay enough attention to his mate and son; not only that but his love, his Steve, was fighting for his life after being poisoned by Hydra's goons, in front of his son's recovery room nonetheless, how much of a failure can Tony be?
"Thank you, sweetheart, you are sweet!" Tony smiled at Harley, causing the boy to flush and look down at his feet like they were the most interesting thing in the whole world, which caused Tony to chuckle. "Tell me, Harley, do you wanna go to the movie tomorrow with us? I'm sure I can talk with Betty so she will allow you to come with us again." Tony's smile widens when he saw Harley's eyes widen in wonder; only for his eyes to deem after a while.
Everything was fine… until Afghanistan…
"A bitch that needed to be taught a lesson…" Tony said easily, which made Steve's mad grin widen even more, and his fingers twitched like crazy, preparing to strangle and no doubt kill someone. "What do you say? Tonight after dinner or in the witching hours?" Tony asked, a giggle leaving his lips at the thought of getting rid of Sunset for once and for all… Needless to say, no one found Sunset's body after that day, but rumors have it; if you listen closely while passing room No.537 in one of Hawaii's most known hotels. You would hear the screams of a woman being tortured to death every time the clock hit 3:33 AM; what made everyone shiver in fear and terror was the mad laughter coming out of the room every night accompanying the screams. On the other hand, Pepper was extremely happy when she told Tony about the cheap company SI bought after the disappearance of its CEO…
Speaking about sanity, Steve didn't know why, but he raised the paper to his nose and sniffed it a little, and the paper fell from his hand at the realization… that faint scent… it was the same scent that the Omega in the park had, the same scent that made Peter purr when he smelled it on the toy… suddenly, his meeting with the Omega today made more sense, the toy he carried, Peter telling him about the Omega crying, and the Omega looking so tired and haggled… everything took a turn to something darker, and it made Steve raise the paper to read the words again, his heartbreaking a little at the thought…
So what do you think?
"No sweetheart, no… just for the rest of mine," Tony whispered making Steve shake his head at that. "Please… this is the only thing I ask of you… please promise me…" Tony's voice cracked at that making Steve whine.
A whimper left Steve when he noticed many doctors and nurses around, him, trying to tell him something; Steve was too lost in panic and loss to hear a word of what they said, trying to jerk his arm out of one of the doctors, trying to scream at them and demand they bring his baby to him. No sound left his throat, causing him to let out a rushed breath of distress, tears gathering in his eyes when he saw the doctor bringing a needle full of some fluid before sticking it in his arm. It was a few seconds later that everything went dark and Steve lost his consciousness.
." She sneered, causing Johann to shiver in his place as she walked back into formation, looking at the huge blond and his black hair companion, newcomers, Steven noticed.
So my updating schedule is pretty messed up, maybe, probably, I don't know but it's a possibility I wouldn't update any chapter of my marvel stories this week… though I will answer your comments if this helps.
Tony hummed to himself, his eyes drifting back toward his baby who was sleeping soundlessly in the backseat of the car, which did nothing but caused a huge smile to take over his face and his face soften when his three years old, mumble something and snuggle into her carrier seat. Tony's smile widens as his attention returned back to the road, his mind wandering a little at the thought of returning back to the town.
"I think it will be a good idea, maybe then Peter will stop writing poets about how amazing Harley is, and how smart he is, and how genius he is." Steve said in a playful voice, which caused Tony to hide his laughter behind his hand, especially when Peter shriek from embarrassment, telling his father that the two of them are enemies from now on, and that Captain America sucks and it totally meant Civil War is going to happen, which caused Tony to let lose it and laugh loudly his, which turned Peter's adorable wrath to him…
"You can pay your debt to me by abandoning your hate, you nearly fried the universe with your stupid plan, next time, please throw a tantrum like a normal brat." Steve said with an eye roll as he starts floating planning to return to his real body and maybe sleep for the next thousand years, it really bothered him that it will take four years for him to reach his real body, the perk of astral travel. "Farewell Loki son of Odin." Steve said nodding his head a little before he shoots off into the space planning to return to his body, he may even bother Sara before that about going on an adventure to Jotunheim to see what happened to their planet and help in any way they can.
"And what will happen is someone angered you? You will turn into a raging monster?" Loki asked as he took his cup and take a sip from it, sending Steven a challenging look as he did, which only made the man lean back on his chair, and some emotion flickered in his eyes, but it went as fast as it came making Loki frown in confusion.
The first thing Steve was aware of as he woke up was the sound of piano playing in the background, it made Steve relax a little and smile, when was the last time he heard the sound of piano? It was too long, Steve can say, he used to play piano for Tony, his husband had loved hearing him play, especially when the first time Steve played the piano was on their one-year anniversary, but after his husband got sick… the sound of the piano always made him annoyed and some times he panic, sometimes it made him sad, so Steve ends up backing his piano and stores it in one of the storages room in the Avengers HQ.
"Tony…" Maria said gently after they reached a room full of children, which made Tony tense and hold into his son tightly. "You should leave Peter here, before going to the therapy." Maria said and Tony backed away shaking his head wildly a look of fear flashed in his eyes, he has never been separated from his pup, and they wanted him to leave his child, what if something happened to him?
Tony let out a strangled noise as he heard the office's door being slammed open, he bit his lip and held his breath butting the phone down gently, he tense as he heard footsteps searching in the room, after a while the footsteps left making Tony sighs in relief and move his leg a little… it was a mistake. His leg hit something making it falls into the floor with a loud clank…
"I box." The Alpha ended up saying as he took another sandbag and went to hand it on the hook after taking the broken chain. "Hitting the bag and ignoring my thoughts, trying to stop thinking and just hitting. It's better with a partner though, really made you focus on avoiding the 'enemy' more than punching a still bag." Steve said looking at Tony with a knowing smile. "Just like getting lost while inventing." That made Tony takes a deep breath and look at the punching bag.
That made everyone looks at the ceiling in surprise at the words. "What do you mean by that buddy, I am sure my word overrides everyone, besides this, isn't the first time you met Steve?" Tony said as he looked at the ceiling, with narrow eyes, heart pounding in his chest at the possibility of Steve meeting his AI before.
"Stevie!" The Alpha slurred as he changes his direction toward the frozen man, laughing as he nearly fell on his face when he tripped, but the man gains his balance back and walked toward the blond, hugging him with a happy growl. "Gosh… missed you…" The man murmured as he starts kissing Steve's neck, and it was only then that the blond regains himself and pushed Tony away while taking a step back.
Until next time!

"… Are you alright, Tony?" Steve's voice made the Omega blink and look at the Alpha who was gazing at him with concern look, and it made Tony blink and look at Steve with wonder since when did the Alpha arrived here? Looking at Peter who was gazing at him with worried eyes, Tony smiled a little, showing his baby that he was fine, which made the small pup give a grin of his own and return to his drawing.
The sound of screams made Tony look up, only to see a speeding car heading toward him before Tony could do anything, there was pain, so much pain, that he opened his mouth to scream, but no sound came out…
Harley huffed as he gazed outside of the window, crossing his arms together and resting his chin on them, pouting as he moved once more trying to get comfortable on the chair he was sitting on. His back was facing Peter and the terror that were the Coulson kids, ignoring how the three of them tried countless times to make Harley participate in their roughhousing and tiring games. It wasn't that, Harley hated playing with the three of them, in fact, he loved playing with those three sometimes, roughhousing and then sneaking away unnoticed and let them frustrated and search for him. Sometimes though, Harley just needed some time to sit alone and be left with his thoughts, wondering and thinking and trying to separate his chaotic thoughts into boxes so he can understand them better.
"What happened to your face?" That was Tony's scathe reply when he found them later making Bucky press his lips shut, tightly; Steve who was treating the wound send Tony a harsh look, causing the Alpha to huff and look away for a second. "The police are on their way." Tony stated as he went to the fridge, getting a cool bottle of water. "I went through the security feed too, found someone suspicious lurking around the house, but couldn't see his face due to the strange face mask and hat he was wearing." Tony growled as he opened the cap, causing Steve to shift uncomfortably.
"Just something to think of…" Angie stated as she put a cup of tea in front of Tony while sitting in front of him and sipping from her cup, a thoughtful look on her face. "You know, I always thought that Rogers was just like us, a victim that was kept in the dark surrounded by lies and secrets his friends tell… I don't think he is a bad person… not if he would go out of his way to save those who came to him." Angie hummed; her words made Tony press his lips tightly in deep thoughts…
Steve's mind was riled up about the images he saw, images and memories that were so strange and so familiar at the same time, causing Steve's mind to nearly halting in confusion. When the baby touched Steve, the Omega felt like time itself stopped, and for a second, he saw himself sitting in a car with Bucky, the two of them had proud smiles on their faces as they drove away somewhere… the image as much as it was a fleeting thing, it made the hair on the back of Steve's neck stand on its ends, causing his body to flinch away from the source of distress which ended up being the baby.
(See the end of the chapter for
You all hate me, I know, I know…
"You have nothing to explain Stark; your father did that for you a long time ago." Steve snapped, but he end up letting Tony enter the house as he went to the kitchen to continue preparing dinner. "Get your shoes off and sanitize your hands, germs are bad for Peter!" The Omega hissed at the Alpha, watching as he gets his shoes off and put it on the shoe rack, before using the hand sanitizer on the table next to the door, when he deemed the Alpha ready he let him come inside of the house, though not before giving him the cold shoulder.
"OK, fellas, take care of yourselves and be good, and I mean you, Peter, no more fight today and don't encourage him, Steve." Tony said as he kissed Peter and Steve on the cheek before waving to them as he got into his car and drove away, smiling happily at the thought of returning home later and seeing his boyfriend and the small pup, already planning what the three of them could do today, and tomorrow, considering that tomorrow was his day off…
Howard pursed his lips, turning away from Tony and gazing at the wall for a few moments before turning his eyes toward his son, gazing at him with a guarded look that made Tony's hope crush before he even heard his father's words. "The chance of the serum with the interference of the poison is up to 1% maybe 1.5% if he was lucky." Tony took a deep breath, closing his eyes tightly, refusing for the tears to fall, even if he knows it was a losing battle.
It was hard and cruel three months, Peter was always in a sad mood, and as much as Steve wanted to cheer his pup he couldn't summon enough joy, the pain of losing his best friend was too much, it was one day that May barge in with a grin and opened the TV on a specific news channel… that day Tony Stark returned to the world after creating a suit of armor, that day the Alpha shut the weapon manufacturing in SI to the shock of everyone, Howard Stark and Obadiah Stane were the most obvious ones as they tried to do a damage control, Steve watched all of that ignoring Peter's happy squeals as he jumped around the room…
But Tony pushed that thought away, for now, that is. His baby's birthday was tomorrow, her first. For that alone, Tony was willing to forgive the people that live in the town, was willing to invite them to celebrate his child's birthday; want it or not, if it wasn't for them his child would have died before Tony get the chance to hold her in his arms.
"Tony… what does he mean?" Steve asked in a shaky voice, denial and hurt warring inside his heart; part of Steve wanted to deny and gloss over what the stalker said on the phone, not wanting to believe what the man had implied when he talked to his husband. Another part of Steve, the most rational part of him, was making the connection to what the man implied with the behavior Tony exhibit in the past few months, finding it matching in the most painful way there was. "What the fuck does he mean, Tony?!" Steve screamed when he saw his husband continue to look away from him, refusing to answer his hidden plea; why won't his husband answer him? It is a simple question with only a few words to clarify it, why was it hard for his husband to tell him the truth?
"How old do you think I am son of Odin?" Steven asked which made Thor look panic for a second, shuffling around like he was struggling to discover the answer to the question. "Don't overwork yourself, I'm 2500 years old." Steven can observe how Thor's eyes grow in disbelieve, confusion painting his eyes, perhaps wondering how such a youthful star like him doesn't glow. "In my world, I'm still considered young; young enough to burn like your Sol." Thor looked down at the ground, knitting his eyebrows before peeking at Steven once more.
?" Tony narrows his eyes, letting some of his scent lack into the air around him, which got him nothing but a scrunched nose in distaste.
"Then why is the small fella here is complaining? You are eating for two now, you can't skip your meals! Look at the poor baby!" Angie glared at him, causing Tony to pout when he heard Rhodey and Pepper start laughing behind their hands, uncaring about the glare send their way by a flushed Tony. "Anyway… does the baby have a gender yet, or am I waiting until the birth to know?" Angie asked, turning the conversation one-eighty, nearly causing Tony's head to spin.
Tony whimper as he pulled the fuzzy pink blanket tightly around him, ignoring how Dum-E gave a sad beep as he tried to coax Tony out of his hiding spot from under the table; so far Dum-E had failed and Tony had been hiding under the same table for ten hours, contemplating how the universe hated him and wished to kill him by sending an Addams his way and forcing him to marry the said Addams without him knowing.
Tony didn't know how long he stayed inside the playroom crying and praying for a miracle; shaking as he heard the laughing and jeering and coursing coming from downstairs, even the slap of skin against skin was loud enough for Tony to hear, informing Tony that he will be having nightmares for years and years to come. Nightmares of memories reminding Tony of his abuse, and the nightmares of him being the reason that Steve Rogers was killed.
Serpentine hummed a creepy tone under her breath as she floats around the mansion, giggling and humming in appreciation as she took in Steve's way of decorating the place. The mansion in question looks like an abandoned and a haunted ground, striking fear, and terror in the heart of those who dared to enter it without permission; Serpentine couldn't be prouder with how her baby managed his life! Serpentine let out a squeal in delight when she saw possessed dolls running and crawling around the place; Serpentine decided to follow them and amuse herself by slaughtering the defenseless things until her son return and tell her all about his date and the souls he tortured with Tony.
"I was foolish and got my heart broken; it's as simple as that." His words could do nothing but widen Thor's eyes, disbelieve and horror and pain burning inside of them, and Steven, he couldn't deal with such an express sent his way, he loathes being subject to that look, he suddenly straightens himself and left the room, leaving silence behind.
"I see." Maria hummed giving a smile to Morgan who let out a few noises of complained until Tony started humming a cheerful song under his breath. "The DIY section is in the back, do you want me to come guide you there?" Maria asked, and Tony had to stop himself from frowning at her obvious offer of trying to follow him.
"I promise to tell you everything from the start… just later, please." Steve plea, making Jarvis hum, and get out a white rose out of the inner pocket of his jacket, it was intact and freshly picked from the Stark's garden.
A hand shot out and took a hold of the front of his suit pulling him down, Steve's breath left him as he regains his balance only to gaze at the Omega's brown eyes…
"Don't let them hear you say that Cap, you know what happened last time when Peter caught you cooing about him being your 'Spidey-Baby'… I never saw him turn that shade of red before." Tony chuckled as he remembered how embarrassed Peter was when Steve caught him by surprise in the clinic, cooing and pinching his cheeks, and calling him baby, all because Darcy dared Steve to do it.
"Listen closely to me, Alpha." Steven said which made the woman raise her brow but other than that her face turned emotionless as she gazed at the Omega who was glaring at her. "I do not care why you are here, or the kind of information your king sent you to get, but know this, Widow." Steven spate the name he heard the Alpha call the woman with and he can see how her eyes widen a little at that, to anyone but a trained eye, the woman's face would have been the same, but not Steven, never Steven, because if there was one thing known, everyone loved to underestimate him, which usually ended by their death. "If you and your people, especially that king of yours hurt a hair of anyone under my protection… you all will regret it." Steven let his threat hang, and he can see how the Alpha scuff at his words, but the caution in her eyes, made the Omega smirk mockingly and sat on the floor, his relaxed body, making the woman narrow her eyes, but what really made her rush out of the cellar was the murderous eyes the Omega was gazing at her with…
So Steve and Tony have left along, this time they were watching 'The Lady and the Tramp' which was something that Tony was so going to keep from Peter because if his baby knew he was seeing one of his favorite movies without him he will pout until Tony pleads for someone to save him.
"About that… the father doesn't know about Peter…." Steve said which made Bucky let go of him and for his mouth to open in shock. "I didn't tell him." Steve shrugged as he let go of Bucky returning to drying the dishes.
A choked noise that could as well be the sound of a dying whale left Tony's mouth before the shorter man can stop it, but by then he was too gone to care, the words Steve just told him were a God's send and the ultimate marriage proposal the Stark's way! "You! Oh my God! From where did you get this theory? How much chance does it have in succession? Tell me! Can you help with making the armor? Please!" Tony whined, throwing himself at Steve, hugging the star tightly as he pleads with him over and over again to help him make that armor; ignoring his blushing face at the act of touching Steve as intimately as this.
Steve gave a sigh as he tried to ignore the way he felt when Bucky stormed out of the room; it wasn't like Steve didn't know what Bucky was feeling for him, it wasn't really hard knowing what the Alpha meant when he wasn't even subtle about it. The thing was, Steve was all about ignoring it until the problem went away; he was already married, he was pregnant, he had a family (Even if it was a mess of a family at this moment) and Bucky's feeling in the mix would have created nothing but a bigger problem than it already was.
"FUCK!" Tony cursed for the millionth time as he dragged his suit behind him, panting and growling as he pulled the half-ton or something of metal behind him, growling to himself, grumbling to himself when the communication line didn't work after the fiftieth time he tried to fix it, which made Tony do nothing but curse loudly with so many different curses that if anyone saw him right now they will blush in embarrassment and mortification and his aunt will scream at him her favorite word "Language!".
"How can I? When every time he was brought up, you always ended up crying… I knew you tried to hide it so hard, Tony, from Peter and me, but I knew, and I didn't want to raise your hope when he was already dead…" That caused Tony to choke and a whine left him, his breath hitching in his chest when Steve's gentle hand wiped the next tear that rolled down his face. "I was there… when May and Ben brought the baby home… Ben was a friend of mine; we served together in the army." Steve said which made Tony's lips wobbly at that, and God, how much Tony hated how weak he was. "My ex was pregnant with Peter at that time, but I had to stay with Ben and May for a while… considering that I was the only one who knew how to handle taking care of an asthmatic child." Steve said, causing a sob to leave Tony which made the Alpha turn to the younger man and pull him in his embrace, letting out a grateful sigh when the Omega didn't push him away.
"It's alright. I won't move." Steve murmured comfortingly into Tony's ear after breaking the kiss. The Omega pressed the side of his face against Steve's and let one of his hands join Steve's between his legs. He touched a finger to the place where Steve was resting in him and shuddered. Then he pushed it in alongside Steve's. He wrapped the rest of his fingers around Steve's hand and moved them together; In and out.
20-Og þú ert ekkert öðruvísi en hann… þú særðir móður mína. -And you are no different than him… you hurt my mother.
Thinking about yesterday, made Tony bite his lower lip in deep thoughts, did Tony really wanted yesterday to be a date? Tony has to admit that he had fun yesterday, the most light and fun day he had in years, and his baby also enjoyed his day, it was the first time the small pup ever experience anything positive and good in his life, which made the smile on Tony's face widen every time he thought of it.
"Hello." A voice called behind Tony and for the second time in the past twenty-four hours, the young teen jumped and turned around to see who was the caller, blinking his eyes when his sight fell on a brunette woman in her forties who was looking at him with a raised eyebrow and an amused look on her face, making Tony uncomfortable for so many reasons. "Can I help you with something?" The woman asked which made Tony clear his throat at that.
"What kind of story do you want baby?" He asked gently making his baby open his eyes and blink in confusion.
So I know that a lot of readers are confused right now so to make things a little easier, I will try and explain this part of the story as best as I can.
Tony closed his eyes, letting out a small sigh, and opened them, but no one was there in the lab with him, that made Tony jump on his wobbly feet and look around the place but there was no sign of Steve being here. "Where did he go, JARVIS?" Tony called out in hysteria which made the AI answer immediately.
The door was knocked which made Tony blink and snap from his daydream, nearly jumping from his bed, heart pounding in his chest hoping that it wasn't Steve or Tony would embarrass himself with his cherry-red face. "Y-yes?" Tony called out, hating that he stuttered a little, but he cleared his throat hoping that whoever on the other side of the door will think that his stutter was because of him waking up and not because of him blushing fifty shade of scarlet.
Tony grunt as he felt the last trace of sleep leaving him, throwing him once more into the living world, reminding Tony once more that he was alive to see a new day. Letting out a tired sigh, Tony wiped his face on his pillow, wondering to himself if he should get up and face the day head-on, or if he can stay in bed and sleep some more, probably sleep until Aunt Peggy or Pepper came knocking on his door. The grumbling whines Tony heard, made Tony open his eyes, and search the room with sleepy eyes, until his gaze finally landed on his eight years old baby, snuggling into Tony's chest while huffing and muttering sleepily. Tony could only gaze at his sleepy son, blinking his eyes a few more times before he looked at his digital clock, his face then became colder as his eyes fell on the date, Tony only shut his eyes tightly and pulled Peter in his embrace, snuggling tightly to his boy as he pulled the blanket over their heads, trying to cocoon them away from this awful day.
Saturday morning you can see Tony pacing around his house, cleaning anything his hands fell on. He was nervous, that much was true, he woke up at dawn and couldn't return to sleep, so after showering and eating his breakfast, Tony start pacing around the place, a little nervous about the thought of Peter and his father coming to his house, and the only thing that he could think of to get himself together was going to his lab, but then he will lose himself in there and dirty his clothes, so the only thing Tony could do was clean the house, and he had to say his nervousness did lessen a little.
So after answering a few more questions, it seems that the fates decided to take pity on him because not a second later, the wall was exploded which made people scream and rush out of harm ways, and Steven gave a silent thanks to God, stood up and rushed with the rest of the Avengers who were sitting in different places inside of the conference hall in Stark's tower. "Who is going to pay for all that shit?!" Steven could hear Tony's screeching which made him snigger a little at that and turn his head to whoever decided to crush the party and saved him from more questioning… the person on the other side made him blink at that and raise his brow.
Fury on the other hand just let out a tired sigh and lowered his arms from their defensive position, looking more tired than angry if Tony had to say so. "I don't hate him, I just hate the…
' (Peter) and quietly slide from the bed and shuffling like the dead until washing their faces (Harley) after breakfast, Tony usually get busy dressing up and making sure he was presentable for work before hustling both Harley and Peter to the car to drive them to school (After making sure that they have their lunch boxes and are presentable for school)
"Cut the acting, we both know that you are not a slave, just as the two of us knows that you will not break and go back on your deal; I am tired of this cat and mouse chase, so just… enough." The king groan, his words made Steven press his lips together tightly, making a pale line with his mouth; this was the closest that the foolish king came to admit that Steven was not a slave or a servant, or the king wouldn't have given him so many liberties.
"Dear boy, did I teach you nothing in all those years under me?" Howard hummed his eyes sharp as they trailed after Morgan; Morgan let out a whine as she finally started waking up from her nap. "It's better to give the prey a sense of security, I always say." Tony's eyes trailed on Howard, taking in how his father's eyes became dark. That was Tony's cue, as he started running like hell, running up toward the stairs and trying to outrun Howard.
That left Tony with nothing but to suck it up and stay in this town with the people he learned to love over time but started to hate because of the secrets they seemed to keep. It left Tony with nothing but living in a house that has a ghost hovering around and playing pranks that Tony doesn't know when they will escalate. It left Tony living near a lake that contained a monster, a different species or being all together; something living near his house and punishing bullies with death, a monster that Tony doesn't know what will do to him and his daughter when their patient ran out… a monster that his daughter shares the same eye color with…
"Daddy!" Hearing Peter's voice made Tony blink his eyes, thinking that he was turning mad, imagining that voice. "Daddy!" Turning around following that voice, Tony let out a sob when he saw Steve standing under a tree with Peter in his arms.
It seems that the inspiration and the will to write had flown out of the window the moment college started…
"Peter!" A low voice was heard from behind Tony, which made the hair or the Omega's body stand on its end at the dangerous undertone he heard under the frantic voice.
"Only for you..." Tony pulled Steve down for a kiss, moaning into Steve's soft lips. He thought he can still taste himself in Steve's mouth, and it's sort of filthy but in the best way, and Tony's harder than he thought possible. Tony doesn't make a move to touch himself, though. His cock sits snug between his belly and Steve's, twitching at the occasional delicious friction afforded by Steve's thrusts and Tony's squirming, but Tony isn't worried about coming or not. Just feeling this close to Steve was doing him wonders.
The fourth story 'The Sound Of Breaking Glass' an Alpha/Beta/Omega Dynamic story, with pregnant Omega Steve, it's a Thrill/Mystery story, with a dash of psychological horror, as two possessive Alphas fighting over out poor blond.
Oh God! What is going on?
The sound of children screaming and something crashing inside of the house, made both Tony and Steve jump and the two of them rushed inside with hearts pounding loudly in their chests as fear took a grip of them, when they reached the room that the crashing sound came from, the only room that Tony never let Steve nor Peter go inside or come near, Steve can see how Tony's face pale and how he froze in his place before walking on wobbly legs toward the door and push it open.
Tony finally dares to look at the source of the fire, only to frown when he didn't see the reason for the flare he saw which made him feel twitchy and unsettled. There is just enough light to see by, and Tony walks across the grass back to his house, cursing softly, and looking up at the clouded night sky. There are no stars and no moon, just bands of dark grey moving slowly overhead.
"I am going to clean my room!" Peter shouted before rushing away, leaving Tony snorting and gazing at the boy who was running up the stairs. Clint's kids are really a bad influence on Peter, before those two little devils sink their claws in Peter, the little boy always loved tidying his room and kept his clothes clean; now… now Peter was the definition of a sloppy jobless person and he wasn't even twelve. Tony just hopes that Harley won't get influenced by those troublemakers like Peter.
Tony found the brunette on the front porch, talking with someone on the phone, clicking the phone shut when she saw him. "I checked the second floor and there is no damage like the first…I'm so, so sorry. I will take care of it, as soon as I can…" The brunette said as she returned back to her phone, which made Tony hum and turn to inspect the front door. The front door was wide open, and Tony ran his fingers down the door frame. There's no sign of forced entry, and the door had been locked when they arrived, he even watched Mrs. Carter struggle with the keys not moments ago.
Steve doesn't know how much time the two of them spent holding each other, Steve only knows that Tony held him tightly, apologizing over and over again until his voice nearly vanishes. "I am so sorry, sweetheart; so sorry." Tony kept whispering in his ears until Steve stopped shaking, letting out a tired sigh as his fried nerves finally calmed down for a bit.
"Yes, it's great." Tony hummed at that nodding his head as he turned toward Steve with a smile pasted on his lips. "Though I couldn't help but wonder, who are the Parkers? I never met them before, and I practically met every one of your friends, even that scary Natasha, which by the way I am still angry at her for arresting me, even if she was an undercover FBI." Tony rambled hoping that his words will distract the Alpha from his real goal.
"Steve is everything OK?" Becca asked as she came toward him which made Steve try to calm himself down, taking a deep breath and give Becca a small smile hoping to not tick the Alpha and cause her to start a fight with the idiot in front of him.
"Steve…" Tony's voice cracked, a sob wanted to leave Tony, but was held back by the power of will alone; even then it didn't stop Tony from throwing himself in Steve's embrace, holding on tightly to the Omega, trying to hold his sobs back by sheer will, only to fail when Steve ran his hand through his hair, causing sobs to shake Tony's body.
" He suddenly ordered, causing the Vikings to stop and look at him in confusion, just like his group of advisers. "Who said that?" The king took a step toward Steven's direction which made the Omega swallow and give Margaret his child which made her look at him in fear
Finally, when the sun finally set, Tony was free to return to his home once more, free from this parallel universe he was thrown into; who would have thought that the people Tony will learn to love and be loved by them will turn out to be a cult or something. It breaks Tony's heart, especially when he loves everyone in the town, they were his friends, and he considered Peggy and Bucky as his family... he loves them… but no matter what they will do, Morgan will always come first, even if Tony had to be the one who will kill the monster in the lake.
Is Howard turning good or what?
Harley's age is twelve, while Peter is ten and a half in this story. Tony is in his early thirties while Steve is in his early forties.
By the way, old Philips is Chester Philips, while younger Philips is Phil Coulson.
This is how Pepper found him, the Beta had to leave last night for something had come up, and when she called the Omega yesterday he didn't answer her, she had thought that the Omega was probably busy with meeting his pup and was so happy hoping that today she can come and meet the little fella that made Tony look all around the world for him, but when she entered the house, she was shaken at what she saw, everything was a disaster, it looked like a hurricane had passed through, she searched for Tony until she found him in the nursery crying, and when he looked at her she knew… she knew what happened and tears start running down her face as she went to hug the Omega rocking him back and forth, shushing him gently when he started sobbing harder than ever. And when Pepper finally saw the pictures after Tony calmed down a bit, she felt like the ground around her start shaking, because the baby looked a lot like Tony, and he was so happy and beautiful, and she cursed Howard, Stane, and that driver who took everything away from the Omega who asked for nothing, just for his pup.
"Peter, where…" Steve's voice made both the pup and the Alpha look at the Omega who was looking at them with shock, but that shock quickly turns into anger and wariness. "Peter go to May's house, now!" The Omega snapped which cut any protest the pup was about to say, which caused the pup to look at the ground and then let go of Tony giving him a small wave before running toward the house next to them. "I thought I made it clear Stark, stay away from me and my child." The Omega hissed at the Alpha which froze the Alpha a little before he rushed toward the Omega stopping him from closing the door in his face.
"And this little bear is for you…" Steve said getting a Winnie the Pooh toy out and hold it near Peter who was looking at the strange thing that his Papa was holding.
In the end Tony asked the AI to make a phone call for him, now Tony knew he should have called his mother, or at least Pepper to tell her about his will, but Tony only wanted to hear one voice now, so he held his breath as the call connected. Wishing desperately that the person at the end of the line will pick up the phone and talked to him, heart pounding in his chest Tony held his breath.
"Steve!"
, not in that place. The contractions were getting closer together and the pain was overwhelming. Even if his throat was hoarse from screaming for so long, even when hours passed and he wished for his mother, father, Peggy, Angie, Jarvis… anyone. Even when the pain didn't seem to end, and he thought he was going to die… he didn't know how he survived but he did, and he held his baby. It was a boy, a boy that has his eyes and hair, he was so small that Tony feared he was going to break him, he should… he should kill him… it was the only chance for his baby to survive… the only chance for him to not be raised in terror… it would be easy, Tony just have to put his hand on the child's face and it will be over in minutes, he could leave the body for one of Stane's minions to take to their boss, and Stane will know that Tony was not a pushover, that he wasn't afraid to kill. He should kill him... he should, he should, he can, he has to! But he can't do it! Especially when his baby turns to him and raises his small arms waving weakly, Tony started sobbing, his baby was his only family now, his baby boy.
"When I was home, she was all smiling and happy, acting like nothing was wrong in the world… but it was when I was away that was the problem… she thought that I stopped loving her after having Peter… so she had to teach the boy a lesson… that was her excuse... she always knew how to get in someone's head… probably the reason I didn't find any suspicious bruising on Peter…" Tony shook at that, his lips wobbled at the thought of his Peter being abused like that, he opened his mouth to order the Alpha to stop but his words got stuck in his own throat. "I start getting suspicious when Peter started acting different, he started jumping and shaking every time I took him outside. So, one day I decided to come home early… I was thankful I did… because it seemed that day Peggy snapped… she snapped and I found her choking Peter in his room…" Steve shook as he said those words closing the album in Tony's hands.
"Yes, yes, well, you see Ma'am, I am looking for a house or something of that sort to buy… hopefully moving in it, too, by today or tomorrow in the latest…" Tony's words trailed off, already knowing that he probably sounded crazy to the woman's ears, and Tony won't fault her if she called security on him, the police chief maybe? Though the woman just hummed and went to her desk opening her computer and looking through it after a few clicks on the keyboard, pointing to Tony to sit down on one of the chairs near him.
Because of Steve not being with him, Tony had to work, half the working hours before rushing to school to pick the kids up; no one speaks or complain about Tony being absent from work most of the time, not when he managed to invent such breakthrough products from his workshop at home, with that Tony felt safe to clock out anytime he wants (Reasonably though)
Anthony didn't know what to do, should he tell the Omega his real name or should he not? Most people change when they knew that he was a Stark, Anthony's face may not be recognized because of him staying out of the spotlight, but his name was a dead giveaway, it made Anthony bit his lip to come out with something fast. "Anthony… Carbonell…" Anthony ends up saying secretly sending an apology to his mother for using her maiden name like that. The Omega though just nods his head and hummed a little looking at the hospital that was getting closer.
Steve's lips twitch up at this and shook his head with a sigh as he saw the pup running down the aisle and took candies from the shelves to put them in their car, though he didn't realize that Steve was returning the candies. "Only when my best friend comes to visit, I start to think that he only visits to make my pup hype on candies." Steve explained which got a thoughtful hum from the Omega.
“I will kill him!” Steve snarled as he stalked around the tower’s halls trying to search for Tony, the Alpha has disappeared as fast as he can after he told Steve for the tenth time that day, that no, he can’t go out of the tower, and it doesn’t matter if it was May’s appointment with the doctor, he was staying because his mate and best friend are hell bend on making him spent the rest of his life with Peter in this ugly tower.
"With all due respect, I love him, sir…" Steve hissed at the man for doubting him, but the older man only snorts at Steve which made the Omega hold himself from attacking the man.
"Mr. Stark." Hearing his name startled Steve and caused him to jump out of his chair, looking at the woman like a deer caught in a headlight, the nurse though, was nice about it, as she gave him a gentle smile. The woman, whose name turned out to be Darcy, guided to the examination room, leaving Steve all nervous and jumpy as he waited for the doctor to show up. "Wait in her Mr. Stark. Dr. Cho will be with you any minute now." Said Darcy after leading him to sit on the chair when his legs couldn't support him anymore from how nervous he was, Steve, swallowed at that and nods his head in thanks as he saw the Beta leave feeling like he was going to be sick any minute now.
But the most important thing, they kissed!!!
Steve sat on the bed with a giggling Peter in his lap looking at him with wide eyes and messy hair. "You still didn't get Mommy's second present, yet." Steve said which made Peter's eyes sparkle in happiness and he looks at his mother's hands like the present was going to appear from thin air, it made Steve laugh a little and sit his baby on the bed, he looked at the baby with a small smile until he stood up and went to his room returning after a while with a picture frame.
The Alpha only scowl darkly at Steven and walked up the stairs glancing darkly at the Omega ordering him to follow the man. "This is your room…" The Alpha said when they reached the end of the stairs and the Omega pursed his lips at the bare space in front of him having nothing but a few furs in the farthest corner of the room as a substitute of a bed Steven bite the inside of his cheek and raise his eyebrow at the mocking and knowing look in the king's eyes and he went to the window near the fur and opening it to see that he was in the attic of the house… a big house indeed to have three stories in it. "You can change your mind, you can go back on your deal and return home no one will think less of you if you did, we both can forget about this, I will even escort you to your family… just say the word…" Starkad said with a gentle voice hoping that the Omega will regain his mind and stop this foolishness right here, right now, without humiliating himself more than he already did.
Opening the closet door, Steve stilled when he saw a sheet-lining covering the walls, causing Steve to let out a confused '
Crossing the road Tony paused when he came across a toy store that stood near his and Steve's favorite café. Tony couldn't help tilting his head when he saw a small boy looking through the window at the toys but not entering the shop; looking around hoping that he will catch the sight of the boy's parents anywhere, Tony saw no one searching frantically for a child, and no one came to collect the boy who when Tony focused on was wearing nothing but dirty clothes and a cap hiding his face, but Tony decided to hope.
Two years and finally, finally his baby's turn finally came, he was finally getting the transplant he needed, he was finally going to heal, going to stop the chemo, going to live his life like any other child, and he was finally going to live! But when was life ever fair to Steve? Not soon after the big day came… something had to come and ruin it for them…. It wasn't a normal thing like his baby dying before getting the transplant, not normal things like the people who were bringing the samples got into an accident, of the samples getting lost, no… it was aliens' attack… out of every joke, the universe decided to throw in Steve's face, it ends up being an aliens' attack… an attack that destroyed half of Manhattan and the hospital they were going to…. Two years, of his baby suffering and looking at Steve with pain-filled eyes… it was all for nothing, nothing, nothing! Because Steve had to find another hospital, and with another hospital, came other bills he has to pay with his current bills for the one destroyed with the interests, not to forget that Peter was going to be put at the end of the list once again… if Steve didn't get a bank rob by the end of the year then his baby was going to die, or worse getting taken from him because he was not fit as a parent.
"I thought you will never come." Was the only thing Maria heard as she entered the house, and she could only look at the Omega in front of her, he was skinny, too skinny to be healthy, and he was tired, too tired probably from taking care of the small pup and working overtime to pay for the bills, she wondered how old he was because she can see that he was young, younger than Tony by years, how young was he when he fell pregnant? She knew the answer to that question will scar her for life.
he slept on. It had been weeks since Hammer was humiliated on national TV; weeks since Steve came home happy as he made a B-ling to Tony and hugged him to death as if he was expecting praise for what he did on national TV. It had been weeks of the Addams' creepiness surrounding him from all sides, causing Tony to finally give up and accept his dark fate, after all, who would care what happen to Tony Stark? Tony was just entertainment to the outside world and a target to his 'friends' who were still angry that he was going to marry Steve. Like why don't you propose to him?! Tony didn't make it hard to do that, did he? They weren't even in a real relationship!
"What?! Do you even know what this means?" Betty hissed, glaring at Tony as if daring him to stop her from going to Harley, which Tony did when he saw her trying to sidestep him. "Dammit, Tony! You could be charged with kidnapping of a child!" Betty finally snapped her glare intensified when Tony refused to move. "I know you are angry I didn't tell you about Harley, but I need to check if he is OK." Betty took a deep breath trying to stay calm, knowing that if she started a fight with Tony they will overcomplicate something simple.
It ends up with Steve calling Anthony over and over again, but to his dismay, the Alpha never once picked up his phone or sent a message, Steve tried and tried to call him over and over again, for three days he did, but the Alpha never answered him and Steve was at his wit's end, it end with the landlady knocking at his door on the third day, she had looked so uncomfortable in being near Steve, but she told him to leave, that she was giving him only an extra day to pack everything and leave, least the police became involved.
Tony watched Steve go as he leaned on the sofa behind him, nearly groaning in embarrassment as he felt a little moister in his underwear; it seems that nine years of dry spell meant that he will get wet at the smallest touch… Tony licked his lips flushing pleasantly as he tasted Steve on them, shivering a little as he bit his lips trying to stop himself from grinning like a manic…
A voice screamed in Steve's ear which made him gasp loudly and curl on himself, it was Edith, and she was coaching him on how to breathe, it made Steve give a chocked laugh that turns into a sob as he heard Edith calming voice coos into his ears. Steve didn't know how much time had passed in his panic, but he was finally able to breathe again, his breath hitches every now and then but it was better than before when he gasped desperately to get his breath.
"What did you think you were doing Anthony?" Peggy finally said and Steven had to stop himself from snapping at the woman for how she was treating Tony, but the man knows that the woman won't do this unless she had a very good reason for it. "Twenty! You are just twenty years old, a child! And you are courting him? A mentally unstable Alpha who will run to his mate the second he finds him and leaves you alone!" Peggy snapped, and Steven didn't even scowl at her for letting the secret of Bucky being alive slip, he was just shocked by the news he was told, that Tony was twenty years old… if that was true, then where are Maria and Howard? The two of them should be alive, but they are not here, he guesses he will ask Peggy later.
It took another two days before Braes finally decided to let go of Steven, on the threat of him returning once a day so that the healer will check the stitches and give him the herbal ointment. In truth, the healer had wanted Steven to stay inside the hut for a fortnight, until the wound was closed and turn into nothing but a scar, but Steven, who was used to such treatment refused. Steven refused, because being inside the hut with nothing but his dark thoughts keeping him company was a waiting disaster; Steven knows that if he said something, Margaret or even his baby would keep his company as long as he likes, but even Steven value his alone time too much for him to let the two be imprisoned with him.
Now, this was the best chance for Tony to say no, and run away to the hills, hoping that Rogers won't catch him. but even Tony knows that this is the best deal he can get out of Steve because an Addams is a magnet for trouble and horror, they can't just tone their urges down like any sane person… they get more creepy if they did (Tony still remember that awful sight of Steve when he tried to be normal) maybe if Tony played his cards right, he will be able to save people who don't deserve to be Steve's next victim.
An hour later Tony's breathe hitched as his eyes took in the articles before him; his heart was pounding loudly in his chest as he kept on reading and rereading the articles he managed to steal from the archive. How could that even be? How did that even happen? Why? Why? Why? The only word that continued to chant in Tony's mind over and over and he reread the articles trying to make a sense.
"Your full name?" Steven asked not taking his eyes off of the woman making her jump in her place and gaze at Steven like a dear that was caught in headlights.
"No, he wasn't a bother at all." Tony said as he led the Alpha to the kitchen, which made the Alpha blink at that in confusion. "I want to talk to you about what happened today." Tony said as he sighed and ran his hand through his hair which made Steve tense a little. "Clint… he came this afternoon to talk to me, Peter saw him and went into a full-blown panic attack I was able to calm him down, he is watching TV right now, Steve, what did Clint meant when he said the pup fear Omegas?" Tony plea with the Alpha to explain as much as he hated to plea for anything, he couldn't help but do it, he wanted to know what happened to Peter, why was the pup this afraid.
"Shut up, he is not my mate, he is my son's neighbor that's all, and he needed help with his son." Tony said as he shifted from leg to leg, trying to will himself to stop with the blushing already, he thought that his answer will stop Darcy from asking any more questions, but the woman looked at him like a shark who smelled blood.
"Uh… I should be the one asking you that question. You are the ghost that I always see here, but Mom and Dad never believe me when I tell them about you; Nana though, says that you might be a vision I am having of something." Steve said before he started coughing causing Tony to wince at the sounds that left the teenager's chest (The sounds were painful to hear), taking a closer look, Tony notice the blanket that Steve huddle under, and the medicine on the nightstand beside him. Tony took a shaky breath as he took in the room once more, taking the strange furniture that decorates the room and how old and new it was at the same time.
It was scary, the thought of dying, it was scary, so, so scary; ever since Steve was a scrawny small kid of ten years old, he knew he will die before he reached the age of twenty. If it wasn't because of his asthma, then it was because of the fever, if it wasn't because of the fever, that it was because of the many sicknesses he acquired over the years. Steve knew he was dying since he was a child, so he was never scared of dying when he was a pup.
It should have been one-time-only, but that didn't stop him from looking at Midgard every chance he had hoping to see the man once more, Sara seemed to have caught on what he was doing and why, and the older star only looked at him with sadness and some sort of understanding. "Just be careful, darling, do not get too attached or you will get your heart broken." That was her words to him and he could only nod at that with a small smile.
Stane ends up being prohibited from coming to their mansion again, and Tony was thankful for his father for that. Stane, on the other hand, took it differently, the idiot tried to lock his father out of his own company, which really it ends up with Stane getting his ass handed to him and getting fired for his offers, Tony was happy he wouldn't have to deal with that creep again.
Realization dawned on Hamar and his face paled even more as he realized that, no, the Omega doesn't carry the marks of a slave, his hair wasn't cut short, but it was long, his clothes weren't ripped and old, but they were new, as new as any clothes that someone who had the wealth owned, there were no bruises on his body, he doesn't walk with his head lowered to the ground the Omega hold it high as he walked down the streets, and his son always play around the village not forced or bound to any work, it all leads to the realization that no, the Omega was not a slave, he was free as any citizen walking down the street. "B-but… but y-you said…" Hamar stuttered, the realization of what he did and what that meant for his punishment made him feel faint, for attacking another citizen and an Omega at that was punished by death after being tortured for an unknown amount of time. "You cannot kill m-me, m-my father will not allow it…" Hamar said in the last attempt to save himself from his approaching death, which gained him a loud and joyful laugh from the king, and that, more than ever sealed his fate.
Tears cloud Tony's eyes, and he opened his mouth to answer, to stall, to get more time, just a little more time… the loud sound of the gunshot made everything freeze, even the howling wind seemed to stop. Stane's eyes were wide, and Tony couldn't tell if they were from the surprise or shock; Tony only knows one thing, the gun went off…
Tony gritted his teeth together, he knows that Betty was coming from a logical place, he knows that Steve and even him wouldn't have welcomed to being disturbed while bonding, especially with how important this step was. "I am adopting him," Tony said out of the blue causing Betty's eyes to widen uncontrollably at that; Tony couldn't help the satisfaction taking over him at the shock Betty couldn't help controlling.
"Ouch, hey kid, are you OK?" Tony groan, his eyes sit on the boy who looked like a dear caught in a headlight; Tony took in the boy who could be thirteen years old or younger, the troubled and sheepish look on the boy's face nearly made Tony roll his eyes.
"Tony!" Rogers gave an angelic smile, and Tony was so sure he heard glasses breaking in the background and some demons weeping and shrieking; Tony wondered if it was worth it to say sorry, did the holy water do something to Rogers' head? Because Tony is now more afraid than ever. He might even call Barnes and asked him for help.
"I am happy." Steve grinned, wondering if he was going to embarrass himself in front of Bucky if he told him what happened. "Do you know where Tony is?" Steve asked instead, trying to ignore how Bucky frowned at the mention of Tony's name; it was probably because the two of them fought once more as they did in the past few weeks, but Steve wasn't going to let this ruin his good mood not when Tony was finally reaching out to him.
Steven gazed at the man in surprise, then a small smile took over his face as he lowered himself into a sitting position; it was awkward for a few minutes, both don't know what to say to the person they haven't seen in many years, a lifetime even. Other than Steven knowing that the Alpha had reached his fifties (And looking surprisingly young and alive) and few other information that Steven doubted staying the same as the years passed. Steven doesn't really know that much about the Alpha; how did he survive the seas when he was announced dead? Did he marry or was he still grieving for his dead mate? Where was Nicolaus when Brookland was burned to the ground? Many questions and so many answers Steven could gain. Nicolaus seemed to have the same thoughts as Steven because the Alpha cleared his throat and started talking, filling Steven about what happened in his life and what he missed while Brookland was still standing. A smile crossed over Steven's face, the anger he felt earlier this morning all but disappear as longing filled him when the older man talked about their home. Nicolaus was a family; he was like his uncle, seeing him after all these years brought bittersweet happiness. If only was his mother here, she would have pulled the Alpha's ears for the no doubt over-exaggerated stories the Alpha claimed to go through that gave him the title '
Tony though… Tony could only wince and send a silent prayer for Hammer's soul; Hammer is in Steve's grasp now, and no one, not even the Avengers will take the chance to cross Rogers to save him (Even when everyone knows that Steve will throw Hammer away like a ragdoll if Tony asked him) looking at Hammer one last time, Tony could only wince and turn away. "Who wants a drink?" Tony asked everyone, which made all of them raise their hands trying desperately to look away from Rogers but unable to…
The Omega snarled at that and let out a threatening hiss, which stopped the Alpha in his place because the man already knows how a pregnant Omega from his people can be dangerous. "A hypocrite brut that is what you are!" The Omega screamed making the Alpha back away a little at that. "If you have not realized yet, your enemy's child and husband already living under your roof, you arrogant king!" The Omega words made the king pause in his place, already knowing what the Omega was implying and as much as the Alpha hates it, the Omega's words held truth in them. "If you come near my children, any of them, I promise you I will make your end as painful as it can be…" The Omega hissed, which made the king scowl, but he didn't dare to come near the furious Omega, who left the king standing in his place.
(See the end of the chapter for
"And what gave you the right to assume I'm Anthony Stark and not who I'm telling you. I told you that my husband will kick your ass when he returns." Tony stated, trying to contain his shaking as he was forced to open the door to his house and get out. Tony's eyes darted around the lake, trying to find somewhere where he will be able to hide until Stane ran out of bullets or Natasha or Bucky give him a surprise visit, he just needs to make Stane talk; the man loves his voice too much that it wouldn't be a hardship.
What Steve said to Tony was true… the only thing that Steve found stars good at was shining, and shining brightly Steve did… the brighter Steve shine the hotter his core becomes, and the hotter it became the unstable Steve felt…
"Did I? What if that was the plan from the start?" Steve reply with a mischievous tone, giving Tony only a second of confusion before flipping them until Tony was under his Alpha, which made Tony give a small squeak. "Oh, darling, were you really that surprised?" Steve asked cheekily when he saw Tony pouting, hiding his laughing face in the crook of Tony's neck when the Omega continued to give him silly faces and trying to push him off to get the better hand once more.
The days after that trickled, uneasy at first, before the fear finally disappeared, leaving the family back to their normal lives, enjoying what's left of summer before welcoming autumn. And with autumn, came the fifth member of the Rogers family… a beautiful girl with dark brown hair and breath-taking blue eyes… a perfect mix between Steve and Tony.
Steve was shaken, he was petrified, a feeling he didn't think he could feel any longer, his wait for the ambulance was long it left him with a deep fear in his bones that both the Omega and his pup were not going to survive. Steve continued to hear Peggy scream and scream, begging Natasha to let go of her, that Peggy needed to be downstairs, as much as Steve wanted Peggy to be here with him, he knew she wasn't rational right now, that she will do more bad than good. Steve tried to listen to the haunting melody that followed him for more than six years, trying to draw comfort from something that he always knew no matter where he was, it was going to be there hunting him… but it was so quiet in his head, so, so quiet.
Steven closed his eyes tightly pulling his son toward his body, hoping that the babe's scent will stop his shaking, and the tears that were trapped behind his eyelashes… what will happen now? Will the Iron King take this as a chance to make Steven do what he wants? Will he take his unborn babe as a hostage? Threatening Steven and his friends if the Omega didn't do what the man wants?
