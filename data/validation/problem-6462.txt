The stone in Tony’s stomach forms into something sharper by the time they reach the address. He tries not to pay attention to the way his breathing gradually becomes shallower and how the urge to fidget in his seat becomes almost unbearable. That’s not even the worst part, though. The worst part is that he
Tony wishes they can go in there with their guns blazing, ready to kick ass, but even in this situation he knows that it won’t be a good idea. After all, they know nearly nothing about the group, and this might just be a small part of it. Going in there would only force them into hiding and inspire them to be more careful when going about their schemes. Still, he hates the idea of there being people out there suffering while he just lays back in a five-star hotel room on the coast.
“Now that we have the other information, we can finally look at what’s on the drive!” Steve says in a triumphant voice as he falls in step with Tony.
As Steve continues to get dressed, Tony sits on the table – which is not too shabby for a hotel table, though that is because Tony insisted on getting a five-star hotel and refused to stay in anything else – and wonders how he got himself into this.
Tony reaches over and takes the folder, dumping it on his lap as Steve unties his tie and carefully places it on a nearby chair. As he does so, he looks at Tony as he points at the bathroom a few feet away from the beds, “I’m going to go take a shower. I need to wash all this stuff out of my hair. Unless you need me to start looking at the files, too?”
The paper makes a tearing noise and Steve groans. Tony turns to see him with half the sheet of paper in his hand while the other half desperately hangs onto the drawing pad as if it were the edge of a cliff. Tony spots a smudge of bright blue on the paper and tilts his head, trying to get a better look at it only for Steve to clutch the torn papers to his chest, his blue eyes narrowing accusingly.
Tony buries his face in his hands, groaning loudly even though it’s muffled. “They put that address in the files as a trap, Nat. They knew that whoever had the files and didn’t recognize the address as a trap was someone who was not meant to have the files in the first place. They’ve tried to get rid of the threat without getting their hands dirty.”
When they walked out after paying the teenager behind the register – who thankfully didn’t seem to recognize either of them – Steve had the most sprinkles on his ice cream cone, which made Tony devilishly grin. “Well, well, well. Mr. I-didn’t-want-ice-cream has a cone that looks like it belongs to a five-year-old.”
Adrenaline pulses through his veins as he ducks under what would have been a punch to his face but the nerd hits him in the chest, his fist landing a few inches away from his hidden Arc Reactor. Naturally, his scars and lungs don’t appreciate that and it causes him to fall, a quick kick to his ribs making him yelp. Pain becomes the dominant feeling in his body as his back suffers more damage from kicks that soon become blurs. His mind is racing, thinking of a million things a minute.
Ignoring the obvious remark about Natasha, Tony pauses for a moment as he finally finishes tightening the tie and says, “Hey, it’s happened to me before. Didn’t I tell you about it? Somebody had a tattoo of me on their arm. Anyways, I haven’t seen anyone with you on their bodies, but that increases the chances of your face being drawn straight on their butt. How do you feel about that, Capsicle?”
“We did manage to get a flashdrive.” Steve, who’s been sitting beside Tony on one of the hotel beds, adds as he lifts it up to the camera for Natasha to see. “We’re not sure if we should run it or not, just in case it has the same effect.”
“I’m trying! How about you do something for once? I’m always the one doing the dirty work.” The smaller male hisses back before reaching out and roughly grabbing the kid’s arm. “You don’t have a choice, buddy. You’re coming with us. Consider it a promotion.”
As their laughter fades, he looks back out at the sea, the sun casting orange and golden rays across the water and sand. He turns his head to the side to say something else and catches Steve staring at him. Their eyes meet and Steve immediately looks embarrassed, breaking eye contact first. “What? Does my hair look bad? It’s your fault if it does.”
“If they’re as meticulous and careful as Nat said they are, then probably someone they’ve been watching for a while,” Steve answers but he sounds distracted, and Tony hears the eraser annoyingly squeaking against the paper as he attempts to gently get rid of a mistake. “Someone close to their base, maybe, so they wouldn’t have to use too many resources for transportation-”
Steve rolls his eyes. “I already know what sarcasm is. Anyway, you’re not supposed to be bored on a dangerous mission from Fury.”
“You and I both know that isn’t the good news we need right now,” he says, a bitter and metallic taste rising in his mouth. He expects another response out of Steve but instead gets nothing, and after a while he takes a deep breath, trying to calm his nerves. When he turns his head to look at Steve, he realizes that Steve is already looking at him, a mixture of concern and curiosity on his face. They make eye contact for a few brief moments but it feels like forever.
Tony rolls his eyes. “Geez, Steve, were you even listening to a word I was saying? Did you somehow miss the ‘genius’ part? I don’t think it’d be too narcissistic to say that I can do anything I want with whatever I want.”
“Haven’t been sleeping well?” Steve asks with a sympathetic look on his face, breaking the silence, settling down on the edge of the bed beside him. Tony sees that he has a cup in his hands, steam rising from it in gentle, thin wisps. The faint yet familiar smell of coffee hits his nose.
Steve heaves a sigh but Tony catches the ghost of a smile on his face that only encourages him. “Fine. Tell me. I’m not coming to your funeral once Fury finds out.”
“That interview feels like it’s a hundred years old. Anyway, are we going to look at what’s on the flash drive tonight?” Steve asks, looking up from combing over the files they’ve stolen the first day of their mission.
When he finally finds his bearings and sits up, he’s met with the same gun to his face, the nerd holding it shakily in his hands. It is just then that Tony notices his own sunglasses are cracked. “Stay still. Otherwise I’ll shoot.” His voice sounds distant, as if he were a few feet away from Tony and in a tunnel rather than right in front of him.
Once Steve finishes up his breakfast and Tony drains his cup of every last drop of coffee (and finishes his egg), they both disperse back into their hotel room, where everything is exactly as they left it. Their beds are messy despite not being slept in, their suits from last night are still in random places such as the top of the chair or the surface of the table, and everything remains in temporary lockdown mode. The files are the only things kept organized and well-hidden, as both of them knew better than to leave them outside in plain sight.
Once again, they share a silence, the only sound that breaks it being Tony tapping a pen against his thigh as he thinks. He’s already coming up of various different ways to remedy that situation but before he can voice any of them, Steve’s voice interrupts him.
“I say we should, I’ve had my fair share of explosions in my workshop. Besides, without it, we don’t have any other leads,” Tony explains his point of view before turning back to Natasha, “by the way, what are your buddies at SHIELD doing? Are they still managing our fake vacation in Florida?”
“Don’t you get it? ABORT MISSION!” Tony yells as loud as he can as he roughly tugs Steve along and Steve obliges this time, shooting a panicked and accusatory look at Tony before he dons an almost steely and calculating expression that only a true leader can wear. When Tony tries to turn a corner, Steve grabs his arm and sets him back on the right track, shouting something about there being a quicker way to get to the exit.
“You and me both, dude,” The man shakes his head, clumsily placing the lid over his coffee cup, “you and me both.”
” Steve practically squeaks, his blue eyes widening. He looks at Tony as if the mechanic suggested murdering someone. “What do you mean? You can’t seriously be going back on what we said, Stark.”
“If there’s anyone who isn’t a team player there, it’s probably you,” the voice on the other end states matter-o-factly, and Tony has to mentally agree. “Please tell me that you two found something and that you’re not hanging upside down over a pit of acid.”
“Alien tech? Or did your nerdy colleagues make this? How is it powered? This is way out of my field of knowledge.” Tony breathlessly asks, taking note of any feature of the weapon. “Something tells me that you don’t know how to use it yet. Or maybe you’re just shaking because of the cold spring breeze? Does your boss know that you’ve stolen it?”
Steve seems to be surprised that he’s called out but he quickly recovers, clearing his throat. “Are you alright?”
doing something and now that he’s left with nothing, all of the energy inside of him threatens to break loose. He’s been tinkering on his off hours but nothing has been finished yet.
Suddenly, he hears a commotion on the other side of the room. Quickly folding up the paper with the descriptions of their injuries and tucking it into his pocket, therefore leaving the other papers in the file, he speed-walks around the shelves of information until Steve is in his sight. Whatever happened seems to be already over since Steve is standing over an officer lying on the ground.
Trying to shove that moment in the back of his mind and keep it there, Tony takes advantage of Steve being knocked out like a light in order to change clothes. He sheds his tank top, replacing it with a black long-sleeved shirt that is dark enough to cover the glow of his Arc Reactor. He doesn’t usually hide it whenever he goes outside but it’s his most identifying mark. In other words, he has no choice. He then puts on dark blue jeans, sunglasses despite the sun having just risen, and expensive sneakers.
Tony muses as he confidently pulls the flashdrive out of the laptop. As soon as he does so, the computer screen flashes once and a bright red countdown appears, starting from 00:05:00, which translates to zero hours, five minutes, and zero seconds.
Tony pushes the thought away as soon as his common sense overrides his emotions. He shakes his head as if the action would put a stop to such thoughts from pestering him and leaves the hotel room, making his way to the elevator and eventually out of the hotel itself.
He recognized the signs of a nightmare before, but this sold the deal. Experience comes in handy, thankfully.
“Listen, about earlier. I didn’t mean it as a bad thing, to have scars,” he says softly, voice barely above a whisper as he continues, “I knew you went through a lot but actually seeing it reminded me of how strong you actually are. I know you don’t see yourself like that, Tony, but you’re a lot stronger than you give yourself credit for. And I’m not talking about your armor.” Steve’s hand lingers on his Arc Reactor before he quickly retracts it and flees to the bathroom, muttering under his breath something about taking a shower. Tony watches the door close, his own hand drifting up to his Reactor in place of Steve’s hand.
“Jackpot!” Tony exclaims as he looks at the confidential file, which is filled to the brim with disorganized papers. He puts his phone away and gathers the folder in his arms, surprised at how heavy it is. As soon as he has it in a secure grasp, he glances back towards Steve, who is busy staring off into the distance behind them, his eyes unusually clouded. Naturally, Tony doesn’t take it as a good sign.
he mentally consoles himself to avoid spiraling, lifting his face up from his hands to dare look at Steve again.
He feels a hand on him and blindly throws a punch, his fist connecting with the nerd’s glasses. He hears a satisfying snap as they break, and he already knows by the white tendrils of pain shooting up his hand that he punched the wrong way but it still did the damage he was hoping for.
“Show me the danger and then we’ll talk. Come on, you can’t tell me that you’re not bored. I mean, sure, you might be in your Picasso mode right now, but I bet my entire tower
Tony wonders if Natasha ever told him that undercover work involved more paperwork than an office job. No, she probably left that detail out, and for good reason.
“I know, Steve. Just trust me on this. It’ll work out.” With that said, she gives both of them a brief nod before the call ends and the hotel room is filled with silence, save for the sound of cars honking a few floors down and the hushed murmuring of people in the hallway. Tony relishes in the silence simply because it gives him a few moments to think through what had been said to him. He knows that Fury and Natasha are most likely right, since they’ve been doing this for much longer than they have, but Tony doesn’t share the same confidence.
That is the one thought running through Tony’s mind as he lies in bed, arms behind his back, his eyes blankly staring up at the ceiling above him. After processing the documents on his laptop and sending them on their way to Fury, both Tony and Steve agreed to get some rest, but Tony finds it hard to sleep with all of this new information on his mind. The files described, in great detail, plans involving human testing to make them more “useful,” and both of them had cringed once they found out what that word truly meant in that context.
For some odd reason, Tony’s body decided to force him to sleep as soon as they got back to the hotel. When he wakes up again, he’s lying on his side on his bed, his leg still hanging off the edge as if he had crashed there and stayed in that position.
“You and me both, Captain Spangles,” Tony agrees, taking a few steps forward. It is definitely strange that there are no cameras in what is supposed to be a secure room that requires an elevator key simply to unlock the floor. He knows that they are not out of the weeds yet but at least they can rule out their faces being connected to anything that goes on here.
a relief that you think I’m so honest.” Tony casually says as he raises his arms up above his head in a stretch, his back arching at a small angle, before settling back down and folding his arms across his chest. He realizes Steve is staring at him and he prompts, “You go first.”
“Look who’s talking, Mr. David Anders,” Tony hears Steve say, and he frowns at his own fake identity card.
He mentally consolidates himself, though it was more of a scolding. The last thing they needed was his anxiety disorder acting up every night. Anyway, what kind of grown man still has nightmares? His father would be immensely disappointed if he knew – perhaps disappointed enough to pretend like Tony doesn’t exist. Yeah, as if that hasn’t happened before.
“A human.” Steve finished grimly, and he looked just as disgusted as Tony felt. “Can’t they just invent a better one?”
“Yeah, it definitely is.” Tony notices that Steve’s laugh sounds a little different as he says that, but he doesn’t think about it too much. However, he gets a weird feeling in his chest as he mulls over his own words, but thankfully before he can think too much about it he suddenly remembers the reason why they’re sitting rather pathetically on the road.
Their awkward silence is broken by Natasha clearing her throat. “Boys? Are we still going to talk about the mission or do you have other things in mind?”
“Yeah, yeah. In the very small chance that they’re not, you can call me a dumbass to my face.” Tony replies absentmindedly, getting his fake badge ready as well as his watch, going for another disguised voice.
“Whoa, hey!” Tony exclaims as he clumsily stumbles to his feet, nearly tripping over the blanket tangled around his legs in the process. At first, Steve doesn’t seem to notice him and through the light of Tony’s Arc Reactor, he can see that the other man’s eyes are focused on his hands, his mouth slightly parted as his breathes come out in short, panicked gasps.
When he looks back up at the laptop screen again, Natasha’s eyebrows are furrowed and she’s chewing thoughtfully on her bottom lip. Tony also notices the dark circles under her eyes, but he chooses not to comment on it. “It means that whoever you’re up against is skilled and they’re definitely not new to this. They’ve most likely been doing this for years.”
By the time they reach the third floor, they have nothing of substance to go off of and Tony is frustrated beyond words.
“Seriously? Anyone can tell that’s fake. You’d never give us a vacation. In Florida, nonetheless. Is your team going to focus on Photoshopping pictures of us on the beach? If so, can you make me taller than Steve?”
Tony shrugs his shoulders, trying to ease his growing doubt as he stares up at the ceiling, “So you just want us to crash this party and find some files?”
My chest is a warzone. Why don’t you tell me something new, Rogers?” he spits, not meaning to come off so harsh but somehow managing to do so despite that.
They come across a small ice cream parlor and Tony grabs Steve’s arm, pointing at the parlor as if he were a little kid asking his parent for a treat. “Look. I don’t know about you but I’m starving. Hotel food can only sustain me for a few hours. I might just keel over if we don’t get some ice cream right this second. Don’t test me on that.”
Tony tilts his head up at the voice above him and he makes eye contact with Steve, whose blue eyes seem to be much bluer now that they turned the hotel lights to full brightness. Even though Tony can’t see anything but Steve’s face and the ceiling, he’s one hundred percent certain that the man is crossing his arms. “Let me think about that,” he pauses for a minute before shrugging his shoulders uselessly and looking back down at the metal he’s tinkering with, “no.”
“Tattletail. What are we, in grade school?” Tony grumbles, hoping that Steve notices the irony in his words. After a few minutes he decides that he’s not scared of Fury and presses, “So, you wanna hear it or not?”
“I already know that.” Tony dismisses with a wave of his hand. Seriously, who did Steve think he was? Tony grew up
Kneeling down, Tony gently takes Steve’s watch from his nightstand, trying to ignore the way his hands shake. Slowly and with precise care, he latches it onto Steve’s wrist, which is hanging down the side of the bed. For a second, his fingers hover over his hand, as if a single touch will electrify him.
“Hey, let’s go out to the balcony. We’ve been stuffed in here for a while.” Steve suggests as he stands up and opens the sliding window, something that Fury told them not to do. Sunlight streams into the room and Tony wants to shy away from it and continue working, but instead he finds himself drawn to it as if it were a magnet.
Tony stayed up that night, working on upgrades to the watches as promised, and proceeded to wake Steve up sometime around seven in the morning. They wolfed down a quick breakfast with what they had in the little refrigerator they were provided, which was nothing but a few measly eggs and pieces of toast. Still, it was better than going out there when their faces were most likely being plastered all over the enemy’s base.
it…” Steve begins to say but stops when Tony throws him an unimpressed glance. “Okay, maybe we didn’t do as much as we thought we would, but tomorrow will be better.”
Hands tightly clutching the gun, Tony tosses a glance to his right and sees the smaller man fiddling with something in his hands.
“Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I’m doing because I’ve done it before hundreds of times and hey, I’m still fine.” Even Tony knows that it’s a lie, but thankfully the conversation is dropped as quickly as it had been picked up. However, Tony doesn’t miss the glances that Steve throws at him every now and then. His bright blue eyes seem to be able to see through his soul and that is mildly unnerving.
Tony simply shrugs. “Tomorrow is what we make of it. And you know what we’re going to make of it? Testing the exploding flash drive, that’s what.”
Deep down, Tony knows that Steve is right but that doesn’t stop him from wanting to continue the argument for whatever reason currently unknown to him. He thoughtfully chews on the inside of his cheek, staring at the doors behind Steve. His attention is forcefully torn away as a waitress walks up to their secluded table, a small but kind smile on her face. She has strawberry blonde hair, hazel eyes, and appears to have a generally sunny disposition that matches the bright lighting of the dining room. On one of her hands is a perfectly balanced plate and Tony cranes his neck in an attempt to see what it is, trying to remember if he ordered breakfast or not. Before he can ask, the waitress smiles at Steve and hands him the plate, “Your order, Mr. Boreman.”
He’s not entirely helpless without his suit of armor but when he’s outnumbered in a fist-fight, well, he’s no Steve Rogers.
“His post-traumatic stress would act up. We can’t risk having that happen during a crucial moment.” Fury would say and the entirety of S.H.I.E.L.D. would nod their heads in agreement. Tony would be kicked off the mission faster than the speed of light. They’d toss him into Stark Tower – better known as Avengers Tower these days – and call it a day.
The person, a man in his mid-thirties with a pretentious red Polo shirt on, as well as beige shorts and boat shoes, lifts up his hands in mock surrender. “My bad. I was just putting some sugar in my coffee, I guess I didn’t watch where I was going. Did anything spill?”
“You’ve got a weird way of thanking people.” Steve says and though he’s behind Tony’s back, he can tell that he’s smiling. “We’re teammates. We’re supposed to help each other.”
Then she suddenly snaps her fingers, her eyebrows shooting up to her forehead. “That’s because you didn’t see us but we saw you. You’re the one who stole the flashdrive from that building. Bet you didn’t know we have video footage of you and your buddy.”
“You alright?” he brushes his free hand against Steve’s shoulder, who offers him a small smile, meant to be reassuring,
“I can and I will. What is this, a democracy?” he scoffs and rolls his eyes at Steve’s frown. “I just think we’re missing something here. What’s our background knowledge of these people so far? Zilch. Nada. We have maybe 1% of the entire picture and that’s being generous.”
“It doesn’t make sense. If there’s anything valuable here, there’s bound to be some form of security.” Steve shakes his head as if in disapproval of their poor security measures, and Tony has to mentally admit that he agrees. They both hear the elevator door close behind them and the room seems to plunge into a much deeper darkness than before, so much so that even Tony’s hidden Arc Reactor’s faint light blue glow is slightly visible. “I don’t trust this.”
He had been working on upgrades for his suit when he turned around and found Fury sitting on one of his work benches, drinking a cup of coffee as if he’s been there for hours. Annoyed with his surprise appearances, Tony asked him in a not-so-nice way what he was doing here, only to have his words drown in his throat as he realized that Steve Grant Rogers was awkwardly standing a few feet away. The blonde offered him an awkward smile and waved, while Tony simply stood there, trying to think of all of the possible world-ending scenarios that can possibly be going on. Just when he thought that things were finally calming down!
“You say that as if helping people isn’t in your blood. Maybe the teammates clause only applies to me.” Tony scoffs.
Steve is silent for a few moments and Tony begins to worry that he has offended him somehow, or that he isn’t as alright as Tony thinks he is. “Do you have them, too?”
They spend a few more minutes outside, walking and talking aimlessly, mostly about the mission but sometimes about other topics, before ending up getting caught in the rain. They debate whether they should make a run for it or huddle underneath a nearby frozen yogurt shop umbrella like a pair of freezing penguins. Naturally, Tony wins the argument, and together they jog back to the hotel.
Steve is the first to flush red with embarrassment as he rigidly sits up, brushing a hand through his hair, which is still messy from the collapse of the building. “Sorry, Nat.”
Before Steve has the chance to answer, they are both interrupted by a high-pitched voice. A girl with a nametag on her shirt appears in front of them, a bright smile on her face. “Hey! Do need any help finding anything? My co-worker Laverre is supposed to be here but she says that something came up. I can fill in for her once I set up!”
“No, did you even listen to a word I’ve said? I’m busy – ah! Fuck! What the fuck?” Tony’s annoyed voice cuts off as soon as he is hoisted into the air. It doesn’t take him long to figure out what’s going on, especially since he notices Steve’s arms hooked around his waist. “Steve Grant Rogers, you better put me down right now, just because you’re a supersoldier with big strong arms doesn’t mean that you have sudden permission to carry people around as if they weight nothing more than a couple of grapes.”
“No, we were out of there before they could see us. Worst case scenario, one of them saw my ass,” Tony responds nonchalantly as he sits on the edge of the bed and screws a tiny screw into his watch. He had been tinkering with it ever since they rushed into the hotel room, constantly looking over their backs to make sure they weren’t being followed. Steve even took a few different routes to the hotel to shake off potential threats, their ridiculously old rental car barely driving along. Tony had already made a few mental notes to fix it one day or another.
A brief pause. Steve folds his arms across his chest and thinks it through, before his eyes light up. “You’re right. Fury never mentioned them.”
Rogers. That’s just fucked up.” Tony emphasizes, his chest beginning to ache with frustration as words continue to spill out of his mouth. “It’s not exactly a great bedtime story if you know what I mean.”
There isn’t much room for argument, so both of the clamber back into the car and hit the gas, speeding away from the smoking remains of the building. As Tony takes a peek in one of the mirrors, he sees the tendrils of smoke slowly rising to the sky, painting the bright blue sky a hazy pastel color.
“Good luck, Stark. Send my best to Rogers, too. Check in after you find something, and we’ll decide on the next move. And remember, nobody knows who you are. Keep it that way otherwise I’ll kick your ass so hard you’ll find yourself right back in that workshop-”
As soon as he hears the name, Tony feels his heart drop all the way to his stomach in realization. He nudges Steve, who seems to have gotten the message, too. They both exchange glances before Tony’s charisma takes over. “No, we’re just looking around, sweetheart. Tourists, y’know? Got any places you wanna recommend to us?”
Tony amends his tone, “Hey, don’t worry about it. Did you forget that you have a genius mechanic by your side?”
Despite Friday’s words, they creep inside slowly and cautiously, making sure to quietly close the doors behind them. It’s oddly quiet inside, quiet enough for Tony to hear birds chirping outside. Sunlight streams through the windows, making the white interior seem whiter, resembling a hospital in a way. The floor is dirty and the walls have a multitude of stains and cracks of different shapes and sizes but other than that, it seems like it’s only recently been abandoned. In a way, that only seems to unnerve Tony more.
“Do you, really?” Tony whispers, drawing his hand away. He stands up and, clutching the flash drive in his hand like a life source, takes his laptop off of his table. As he stands in the doorway of the bathroom, he casts one last look at the sleeping man.
There was something about Steve in the way he spoke to him. There was no pity in his eyes, his lips moved and refrained from babying him for being stuck with a piece of metal in his chest. In that moment, he saw Tony as
After debating if he should let it go to voicemail or not, Tony picks up the phone and leans against the chair, “Mr. Fury, I’d like a new partner for this project. Mine isn’t a team player.” He hears Steve scoff.
As the man struggled to get his sentence out earlier, Tony had finished preparing his cup of coffee in the meantime and now holds it to his lips, more than grateful for the first sip. Unfortunately, as soon as the stranger finally speaks again, he ends up immediately regretting it.
People normally fall in love by falling head over heels. Tony Stark falls in love by falling straight off a cliff and tumbling down.
Tony looks up and sees Steve arching an eyebrow in disbelief. “You’re really bent on something spontaneous like that happening? Do they even know that we’re men?”
Tony scrambles up from the bed like a startled wild animal, nearly falling in the process. He looks at Steve, looks at the indentations on the covers where he once slept right beside him, practically on top of him, and promptly covers his face with his hands, feeling it heat up underneath his palms. He wishes he can somehow forget the last few minutes. He has never felt so embarrassed in his entire life. If he can somehow dig a hole in the hotel room, lay down in it, and proceed to die in it, he would with no hesitation.
“How long are we going to be out here?” Tony hears Steve ask and he turns his head to the side just in time to catch Steve checking the time on his watch – the watch that Tony made for him last night. Tony can’t help but smile. “I think it’s going to start raining again soon.”
After a few moments, Tony breaks the silence. “Hey, uh. Thanks for saving my ass back there. Not that I would have normally needed it, I would have just called my suit and blasted them into oblivion, but you know the circumstances. You’re the supersoldier and I’m not.”
They both fall silent but the air around them remains slightly tense, hanging over them like a dark cloud. Tony has nothing more to say for now, so he decides to try to busy himself with more adjustments to his already overly advanced watch, only to have his phone ring once again. They both stare at it for a few seconds, and Tony notices that this time the caller ID is different. He supposes that it’s a security measure, as Natasha had once told him that Fury sometimes contacted her with different phone numbers to erase the chances of one phone number being traced back to one location.
Tony tears his attention away from his fake ID and sees that Steve had pulled out a rather small lens case and before Tony can ask where he got that, he mentioned Fury’s name.
She turns and leaves, dragging the nerd with her. Even before she left, Tony can tell that Steve is dying to go after them.
She starts prattling on about about common tourist attractions, but Tony isn’t really listening. He looks to his left, and then to his right, suddenly feeling cramped and claustrophobic. The words echo in his head:
“’Twas a joke, Mr. America.” Tony deadpans but can’t help but feel surprised and satisfied with the fact that Steve is
“Friday, can you close the blinds? It’s too bright in here.” Tony murmurs automatically, turning on his side and splaying his hand out across from him, his fingertips brushing against … skin? Alarm bells ring in his head and he opens his eyes, only to find his face a mere few inches away from Steve’s sleeping face.
Tony feels a hand drop on his shoulder and his instincts kick in. He turns around so quickly it makes him dizzy, raising his hand above his head, preparing to throw a desperate punch only to have another hand clamp around his fist, stopping any momentum.
“No, thanks.” Tony blatantly rejects. “And don’t you dare make those puppy eyes, Rogers! You know what, I’m not even going to look at you, how about that?” He briskly turns away but he still feels Steve’s eyes on him, and he knows that the blonde bastard knows
“Wish you had sunglasses like me?” Tony teases as he watches Steve adjust his baseball cap so it shields his eyes more. They are leaning up against the counter where the coffee machines are located, and Tony is waiting for his coffee to finish brewing. The air smells of pancakes, syrup, coffee, tea, and various other breakfast foods, creating an overall sweet aroma that helps Tony feel more at ease.
As they begin to part ways, Steve grabs onto the sleeve of Tony’s jacket, tugging him backwards. There is something in his eyes, something akin to determination. “Try not to get your ass kicked again.”
“Here, I brought some coffee for you.” Steve says, handing the steaming cup to Tony, who accepts it with a quizzical thanks. “Aren’t we going to look at what’s on the flashdrive tonight? I was thinking you’d need some energy now that you’re an old man complaining about your back.”
The genius simply shrugs his shoulders, pressing another button and returning his voice to normal. “Probably not, but we need time to read and dissect the files. I’m not in the mood for kicking butt at the same time and this will come in handy soon, you’ll see.” He casts a look at the files he ran off with, a sinister pile of papers barely held together by a beige folder. The folder sat on the nightstand next to the bed that Tony called for himself, the one nearest to the door. Steve wanted the same bed, most likely for the same exact reason, but Tony won the rock-paper-scissors match they had so by those sacred rules it is rightfully his, and Steve got stuck with the bed next to the window.
“I’m willing to bet my entire net worth that the drive doesn’t mention them. It’d be too risky even with the bomb planted there.”
this fic is 100% spontaneous and impulsive, but i like the idea! i'm really excited to write more, but since it's impulsive i don't have an outline, so would you guys wanna see me finish this up? it'll be a somewhat lengthy fic!
“Are you kidding me? Have a little faith in me, Cap,” Tony laughs bitterly before he adds in a much more serious tone of voice, “But really, the building is about to blow up, so unless you want paramedics to try stitching our bodies back together like some screwed up jigsaw puzzle, you better use those supersoldier legs and run.”
“Yes,” he says as if it’s obvious because he thinks that it should be, “I always take it with me. You think I’m going to show up on an undercover mission without my suit? What if things go wrong? What are you going to do? Hit them with a suitcase? Huh? Give them a good old-fashioned suitcase-concussion? A suit-cussion?”
Steve snorts and Tony almost smiles despite their debate. Keyword: almost. “We can’t risk it. Fury is right, if we blow our cover then they’ll just go into hiding and we’ll never pick their trail up again until it’s too late.”
“I’m telling you I don’t know where the second key went!” A voice yells, distressed and masculine. Tony recognizes it as the person he bumped into earlier in order to get the elevator key. “It could have slipped out of my pocket. One of those bitches I was messing around with earlier could have stolen it. Listen, I really doubt that if anyone did pick it up, they would be here.” As the man quickly speaks, trying to prove his innocence, Tony remembers that the key is in his back pocket.
He jolts awake. At first, Tony is disoriented and unsure of what woke him up. Maybe his mind took mercy on him and decided to shove him out of his dreams before he was subjected to a panic attack. It takes him a few seconds to find his bearings since his eyes need to adjust to the darkness around him, differentiating between the darkness of his dream and the darkness of reality. He stares up at the ceiling, not daring to move just in case. When he musters up the courage, he turns his head to the side and sees pale moonlight streaming through the curtains blocking the window from view, faintly illuminating the man sleeping a few feet away from the window.
As Tony takes a sip of the coffee, Steve continues speaking, this time his gaze averted downwards, “I also wanted to check on your back. But you were out like a light as soon as we got here so I figured I wouldn’t do it without your permission.”
“Yeah. Yeah, sometimes. I think that comes with the job description of being an Avenger,” he softly admits, “everyone on the team has nightmares. I know they do. You can’t do the shit we do without seeing it again in your dreams.”
“Y’know what I’m thinking? We walk right in, take what we need, and walk right back out and be back by dinner so I can get some five-star hotel wine.” Tony says as he stuffs his hands in his pockets, the action seeming casual but actually being a way to wipe his hands against the fabric of his jeans.
“Open it! You’re a supersoldier! Dad didn’t hop you up on drugs for nothing.” Tony urgently orders as he moves over to the desk to make room as Steve climbs up it. Steve obliges and hooks his hands underneath the window, pulling it up. Unfortunately, and Tony realizes this too late, that having super strength also means not being able to control it at all times.
“Explain to me, why did Fury send us undercover again?” Tony asks as he stands in front of the mirror and ties his red tie, “Especially since our faces are probably tattooed on the bodies of other people?”
“Of course! What if one of them shows up in a maid outfit calling out room service and is only using it to find out who’s in here? We can’t risk that.”
Tony thinks he knows Steve: the truth is, he falls flat on his face when it comes to minuscule details. Both the mission and Steve are mysteries to him.
Steve rolls his eyes. “We’re both wearing things with the same exact purpose. I just look like less of a…” his voice trails off and Tony devilishly grins.
that Steve notices something off in his behavior, too, and he can tell from the glances that the other man keeps tossing at him every now and then.
a regular gun before he’s hit with a blast that throws him against a nearby discarded wooden sign, which splinters and eventually breaks. Groaning in pain and annoyance, Tony props himself up on his elbows, his ears ringing. His back feels like it’s on fire. Come to think of it, every part of him feels like it’s on fire.
The good thing is that she doesn’t know their names nor recognizes them as their true identities. Contrary to her belief, that puts Tony and Steve on the upper hand. Now all Tony has to worry about is somehow getting out of here when he’s clearly out-numbered.
“S.H.I.E.L.D. would break down the hotel door as soon as you do,” he points out before adding, “and Fury would personally make sure that you never do it again.”
Tony thinks for a moment but honestly, he’s already thought of this while he had been working on upgrades to his sunglasses. His incident with the homeless boy earlier this morning inspired him to think about something they haven’t considered yet. He shakes his head. “No, change of plans. Ready to resort to a life of crime?”
“You haven’t seen the photos?” Natasha snorts and taps on her phone before smiling and saying, “Steve, check your phone. You’ll love them.”
“You and what army?” Tony retorts only to flinch in surprise as his voice comes out not slow and deep as he intended it to be but high-pitched, as if he’s been gulping down helium all night.
“Welcome to paradise.” Steve notes as he parks the car a safe distance away from the building and turns off the ignition and makes his way out of it, Tony scrambling out after him.
hey, long time no see! this chapter is a little slow but things pick up in the next one! also, tony is very much pining but he's too oblivious to notice it himself.
Steve drops it, thankfully. They’re both silent as Steve bandages any cuts Tony got and judging by the bands of white that wrap around Tony’s torso, there’s a few of them. None of them seem too bad, though, since he was able to sleep without bleeding out. Something tells him that Steve is just being a worrywart, but he lets it slide.
Finally, the conversation comes to a close after a few remaining sentences, and a lot of empty promises from Steve to check out the places the man recommended. Tony watches the man leave and then flashes a shit-eating grin to Steve, “Are you going to go get a sun-tan while I work my ass off trying to find out where to go from here? Bring me back a seashell, will you?”
Tony ignores him and asks the million-dollar question. “Did you really run over here in your boxers?”
The video is set like an interview. Both Steve and Tony are in view, sitting down, and the “reporter” is unseen. He can tell it’s for the sake of an easy voiceover. The background is colorful, a light yellow, a sign that they’re trying to use color psychology to ensure that the atmosphere of the video is joyful and positive.
“It’s rude to look at an artist’s unfinished work. No one asked you to look.” Steve says defensively, and now Tony
The woman looks impressed as she blows a piece of her blonde hair away from her face but soon a smile graces her lips. “I could ask you the same thing.”
The elevator soon stops once again, interrupting their conversation, and the doors smoothly slide open, the light from the elevator illuminating the dark area extended out in front of them. It takes Tony a while to adjust from such a bright area to a dark one, and if he has to be honest, the darkness unsettles him. It reminds him of the darkness of the cave in Afghanistan, and that is certainly not the comparison he wants to be making right now.
Suddenly, Steve slings an arm around Tony’s shoulders, nudging for Tony’s hand to wrap around his back. “You’re acting like they broke my kneecaps and took my kidneys. All they did was rough me around a bit.” Tony complains but he does as Steve silently directed him to, thankful for having some support to lean against other than a wall. He isn’t sure what device they used but his head feels like it’s still spinning. He hopes that Steve blames his burning cheeks on whatever he was hit with.
As the video stops playing, Tony suddenly remembers the original source of the interview. Fury wanted to make sure that they were working well as a team and not constantly at each other’s throats, so he had every member do an interview with each other. Tony was at his best with Bruce, on friendly terms with Natasha, and decently acquainted enough with Clint and Thor to be his annoying self. Steve was someone he couldn’t figure out at the time. Despite their clashing personalities, they miraculously passed the interview.
Tony opens his mouth to respond, prepared to say that they’re going with his idea, then instantly closes it. His eyes wander from the hem of his jacket, which he’s been mindlessly picking at, to look at Steve.
On their way back, Tony tugs on Steve’s arm, pulling him closer to the entrance of a nearby gift shop. Since they had a hotel so close to the boardwalk and beach, the area is loaded with gift shops around every corner. A great marketing tactic, honestly. Tony hesitantly separates from Steve, gesturing towards the door.
“Yeah, I’ve had my fair share of life-and-death moments, it’s in the job description.” Tony says, trying to muster as much wit as possible into his voice. “I thought you were…sleeping with the fishes. You really do love messing with my heart condition, huh?” As Steve opens his mouth, most likely to apologize profusely, Tony pulls his fist away from Steve’s hand and lets it rest against his own thigh. “We better get out of here. I have a feeling the cops will show up here any minute and not take kindly to this mess, and we’re no maids.”
“That was easy.” Steve comments, looking over his shoulder at the closed door behind them. “Way too easy, don’t you think?”
“I guess there’s a lot you don’t know about me, then,” he casually says as he takes the plate from the waitress and warmly thanks her as she leaves. Tony isn’t sure why but some part of him takes Steve’s response as a challenge, though before he can force stupid and borderline impulsive words out of his mouth, the subject changes.
“We should get some sleep.” Steve murmurs before he gives Tony one last look and turns on his side, breaking eye contact with him. Tony waits for a few minutes, staring at the form of Steve, his body slightly illuminated by the moon’s reflected light streaming through the cracks of the blinds, before doing the same, met with the sight of the faraway closed door to their room.
Her text makes Tony snort. He knows that she’s just messing around, since Fury is most likely busy with other problems the United States seems to be riddled with, but at the same time he can definitely see Nick Fury saying that. He can imagine all of the gray hairs that are named after them. Just as he is about to lock his phone and resume working on his sunglasses, it buzzes with another text from her.
Steve nods his head, bringing his knees to his chest and resting his arms on them as he stares at the road ahead of them. “Yeah, a few years ago. She was difficult to work with at first but when I got to know her better, we were a great team. She really is skilled at what she does. She also made me kiss her to distract people following us.” He lets out a small laugh at the end of his sentence; clearly the memory is very fond to him.
The man smiles in response to Steve’s friendly disposition and softly sighs. However, he begins blinking rapidly before donning a confused look, eyebrows furrowed, mouth slightly open, as he points a finger at Tony and slides it to Steve, and then back to Tony. “Are you two…uh, together?”
“Fuck!” Tony snaps as he finally gets a good look at the engine and notices the tendrils of steam rising from it. This is the last thing he needs.
“Do you mind?” he snaps at the confused person behind him, who is most likely the culprit of the shove. “Do you even
Above them, seagulls caw annoyingly, sometimes dropping down to the boardwalk like missiles whenever a crumb of food is in sight. The waves crashing against the sand make a loud sound compared to the voices of other people around them, but the more time passes the more the waves become background noise, only audible if one remembers to pay attention to them. Despite the fact that the rain has stopped, the sky remains overcast, the sun hidden behind steel blue clouds.
Steve shrugs in defeat before he busies himself with his own tie, colored blue in contrast to Tony’s red. Both of them are in formal wear since Fury reported a Gala going on where they are most likely to find out everything they can.
if you wanna yell at me about how bad tony and steve are at being spies, consider endgame. trust me, they're the worst people for the job.
The tall woman shrugs her shoulders. “True. Boss wants us to get rid of you quick, though. Good to know that you’re still in the area.”
Voices catch his interest and he looks up from his watch, where he had been toying with it to keep his hands busy, peering through his sunglasses at the only other people on the boardwalk ahead of him. Tony spots a rather short male and a taller female, both of their identities unknown to him, hanging around a kid who doesn’t look more than thirteen-years-old. At first, he thinks nothing of it. After all, they look very much like a regular family out for a walk.
Now that he’s closer, Tony can get a better look at him. He has light brown hair, pale blue eyes, and thick-rimmed glasses that make him look like the pretentious sons of rich men that Tony has met as a kid. It is also just now that Tony realizes he’s wearing a suit but from what he can tell, there are no identifying marks to it. It’s just a regular suit.
Tony waits as the watch makes quiet beeping sounds for a few seconds before flashing green and Friday responds dutifully, “None found. There are also no other human lifeforms here.”
Thankfully, what Fury ended up describing sounded less urgent than aliens invading Earth or a robot trying to commit mass murder, but still important. He was vague, mentioning that Steve and Tony had to go undercover so the “bad guys” wouldn’t get nervous that the Avengers were on their tails and go into hiding, therefore jeopardizing any potential evidence and ways to stop them before they go underground.
to bench him under the current circumstances just because he deals with PTSD – as if Steve doesn’t experience it, too. They’d want to take Tony off of the mission because it’s so reminiscent of what he has gone through in Afghanistan but little do they know, there is never a point in time when Tony doesn’t think about what happened. The constant reminder is imbedded in his chest, for heaven’s sake.
“We need to get these guys,” Nick had simply said, “and we need to do it without mass hysteria. Agent Romanoff and Barton are out of commission for a while. You know I wouldn’t be asking you if I didn’t think it is important or that this is some average every day bank robbery.”
“-Next time he calls, we’re sending Nick Fury straight to voicemail, I don’t care what anyone says.” Tony says in as commanding of a voice as he can muster as he wags his finger. “We’re putting this mission in our own hands now, where it belongs.”
“Whoa, hey, I thought you said I was doing the punchy business!” Steve gasps as he catches Tony’s fist in one hand. Tony quickly eyeballs him; his hair is all over the place and he has a considerable amount of dust covering his clothes, but other than that he seems alright. Relief floods over Tony like a tidal wave and his once tense shoulders relax. If he didn’t have an ounce of self-control left, he probably would have hugged Steve but not all has left him, so he simply remains standing on shaky legs. “You alright?”
Apparently Tony just hit and nerve and therefore signed his death warrant. However, before the nerd can blow Tony’s face in, the gun is knocked from his hands with enough force to send him reeling. Tony looks up just in time to see Steve shaking his hand as if the force of the punch hurt him, too.
Tony immediately starts voicing his protests and Steve does, too, both of them for different reasons. Together, their voices form into a mix of “we can’t do that!”, “innocent people are getting hurt”, and “if I wanted to take a vacation while this group of people is off doing evil experiments, I’d be in Florida right now swimming with alligators.” Natasha puts her hand up and both of them fall silent at the gesture but Tony remains seething.
this chapter is LONG holy shit. a lot of things go down. i feel like this is turning into a buddy cop story but listen, i'm having a lot of fun writing this. the next chapter is also gonna be pretty important.
“Breaking the rules, are we? Wouldn’t Fury not want us to chill out in the open like this?” Tony softly chides as he follows Steve over to the small balcony, fit just for three or four people. There are two chairs beside each other on one end while a circular table is on the other side. Tony can see various pieces of cigarettes scattered under the table, most likely from the previous tenant. The afternoon sunlight is warm and colors the white balcony in a golden light. Below them and practically everywhere around them, there are various other balconies of the exact same shape and size. The hotel staff seems to know how to take advantage of their seaside view.
“Sunny side ups? I always thought you were an omelets type of guy.” Tony admits, surprised that he turned out to be wrong. For someone who believes that he’s right 99.9% of the time, this is more than a huge blow to his pride.
Suddenly feeling self-conscious, Tony covers his chest with his arms, the bright glow of the Arc Reactor coloring his arms blue. “I know, I know, I
Steve stares at him as if he had grown a second head as they begin awkwardly walking. “You were blasted straight through a sign.”
“Jealous?” Tony smirks as he retracts the gauntlet, the lights flickering on as they sense movement. The room is rather small, nothing like the room that Tony expected to come across, but the shelves are filled to the brim with files. “Organized my ass. This is only vaguely alphabetical. Alright, we’ll play it their way. You take right, I’ll take left.”
“You’re messing with things you don’t understand,” the smaller nerdy one warns as he catches his breath, “it’s better if you let us do what we need. Otherwise you’ll find yourself in the hospital.”
Tony absentmindedly walks down the boardwalk, the hotel he and Steve stay at shrinking more and more the further he walks. He doesn’t plan on straying too far, just enough so his restlessness can stop making his life hell. The problem with being on break is that Tony is used to
“Oh! Um, no. We’re not.” Steve awkwardly explains, and through vision blurred from tears Tony sees him rubbing the back of his neck, his ears a bright crimson. “We’re just traveling together. Do you have any recommended places we visit?”
Tony looks away and reaches outward, his hand touching the cold nightstand beside his bed. It feels nice to touch something solid. The only sound of water came from the sound of the ocean waves crashing against the sand. They never stopped no matter what time it was.
The wall is a heartbreaker. By the time Tony skids to a halt and aims to run out the way he came, the nerd blocks his path, panting, sweat glistening on his forehead. Tony backs away, his chest aching, his eyes searching for anything that could help him. On his left there’s a dumpster a few feet away from him and on his right there’s a discarded sign leaning against the wall. In other words, he’s fucked.
Guilt pricks at his skin and for a moment, he considers pushing everything else aside and telling Steve. He doesn’t want to hurt Steve. He knows that once Steve finds out that Tony knows something he doesn’t, he’s bound to feel like his trust had been carelessly trampled on. The thought of that makes Tony want to kick his own ass for daring to betray Steve’s trust. His revelation earlier about his newfound…feelings for Steve just makes things harder. Then again, or does it only solidify Tony’s earlier speculation?
Tony barks out a laugh. “If you ask me, it is fully appropriate in this situation to use the bad words I taught you.”
He stomps up the stairs and shoves the door to one of the few rooms on the floor open, narrowing his eyes as he takes in the small display of a neat desk and a shut off laptop with the screen still propped up. Curious but prepared to be disappointed once again, Tony saunters over to it, one hand stuffed in his pocket. He experimentally taps against the keyboard of the laptop and nothing happens. He taps against the touchpad and even goes as far as holding down the power button, and still gets no reaction.
He considers draping the blanket over Steve since the blanket is halfway on the floor and the other half is loosely on his body. His mind stays on that thought for a few seconds, as if it were reluctant to leave.
They spend a few minutes rummaging through various rooms, all of them rather small and empty. Tony always goes ahead, managing to read papers in record time, therefore deciphering between a lunch schedule and something important. Steve trails behind, making sure that they won’t get ambushed even though Tony is confident that Friday was right about there being no humans in the building currently, other than them. He also goes through what Tony might have missed, since Tony is quick but often careless in his approach.
“Uh-uh, I’m gonna stop you right there,” he interrupts Steve from apologizing to his grave, and pauses for a moment before impossibly softening his tone of voice even more, “I’m the last person to judge you for having nightmares, okay? You don’t have to give me a novel of an apology. I’m not going to read it.”
For the next few minutes, they both scour the shelves. Tony is glad that he’s read a lot of books in college and can therefore skim through the files easily, his mind picking out certain key words. Finally, after a multitude of files pertaining to old murders, assaults, drug busts – typical crimes – Tony finds exactly what he is looking for. The file is thinner than others, meaning that the case is still open and with little to no leads.
resemble pajamas, and crawled under the covers. Despite this, Tony didn’t expect to fall asleep. By now he’s lost count of how many minutes have gone by. All he can do is
Tony glances at Steve, who is sitting down on the chair closest to the side of the balcony, his eyes curiously fixed on him. He wears a soft smile and just then, a breeze flickers by them, ruffling his hair. “I have. I used to live in a place where I’d always wake up to the sound of the ocean,” he says in response, drawing away from the balcony and plopping down on the chair beside Steve.
Tony whined, tried to hide his face in Steve's hand, felt acutely how the bristles of his beard scratched against Steve's palm. "Steve—" he tried then, breath hitching.
"I should‒" Steve growled softly, sucking what was going to be a fantastic bruise into the junction of his shoulder, "I should go get dressed."
Fury looked at him blankly. He couldn't read Fury for the most part. He had been working for the man for years and he still couldn't read those damn facial expressions.
The waiter turned to face Steve, mild surprise on his face. He looked so nondescript. An average height white male, light brown hair, probably middle aged. It was a wonder Steve had recognized him as familiar at all. That was one of Phil’s assets as a SHIELD agent, looking nondescript. Steve idly wondered if being around nondescript agents enough to get to know them helped him be better at picking up on nuances within the average appearance. The man smiled politely.
To Steve’s credit, the ninjas did all seem afraid, and dissipated without reforming this time. Except the one. She let out a pained scream before hiding behind a pillar.
Tony said as he landed on the ground, crossing his arms. All at once the rest of the Avengers seemingly came out of nowhere, and MODOK couldn’t defeat all of them at once. Luckily as he shot out his last blast before they placed the jammer on his head, it only hit the Hulk, who seemed to think it tickled. No wonder MODOK had done his best to avoid Hulk this whole time.
It was hard to pinpoint when it started. Little troubles easily dismissed as bad luck or simple mistakes grew incrementally until the only logical conclusion was that something was wrong. Very wrong.
He looked so pathetic and in need of help, that Tony felt he had to reach out. They could maybe get him to SHIELD medical and find some way to communicate. He didn’t seem malicious, just in need. Glad that JARVIS had to have told the others about the lost contact by now and would let them in the basement, Tony decided to take the risk and grasp the stranger’s hand to help him up.
Tony looked around at the others. Bruce just gave him a pitying look as though the answer should be obvious. No one else even attempted to answer him, going back to their own activities.
The cave was not big. The two of them could lay curled up, but there would only be room for a small fire as well as their bodies. Tony threw his pack to the ground and watched the armour tumble out with a loud clamour.
Abram asked, slightly distracted as he wiped down the counters. Natasha immediately recognized the Afghani accent, so at least their limited intel was accurate.
The envelope held a ticket. Frank had a VIP ticket to the opera, a balcony to himself to watch the next show. It wasn’t poetry or a love letter, but it was something. This was Maria inviting him to actually enjoy her performance, enjoy the opera instead of working behind the scenes. He was going to have a better seat than many far above him in social status. He had to buy something nice to wear. The moment of warm happiness was quickly replaced with anxious irritation at the thought. At least he had been saving up money for a while.
Tony tensed as he felt Steve’s arms suddenly around him. He forced himself to relax into the embrace, because he didn’t want Steve to stop, he was just on edge.
When Strange awoke, he was not in the Sanctum Sanctorum. He sat up, looking around, confused. Everything was sleek and glass or metallic. This was the Avenger’s tower. It all came flooding back to him. His body ached in ways it hadn’t in a very long time. Lying back, he allowed himself a moment to order his thoughts.
he asked tiredly. Clint invaded his vision, appearing beside him on the bench. Tony sighed, sitting up.
Bravado always kept away the fear. He couldn’t give in to it yet, it was so early on in the kidnapping.
Steve looked up at his love and their eyes locked. He could feel that his cheeks were damp again. Tony was right, if he didn't stop thinking like this, the cycle the two of them had been stuck in would be endless. There's no need to force themselves to be miserable over nothing when there were plenty of Lokis and Mandarins and Red Skulls out there to do the work for them.
he looked at Steve sharply. There was a piece to his puzzle missing. Clint and he had been stable, there had been no reason to drug him.
Pepper, Steve and Bruce said in unison, and good grief, was this conversation choreographed? Thor just watched the banter, amusement plain on his face.
To battle, the Avengers go! With a special guest. Their plan is solid, but does anything ever go according to plan?
It didn’t seem like there was warning before Tony slumped over, lying unconscious. His breathing became more even without the sobbing, but he looked pale. No one could look healthy with bloody tears all over them, though, so Steve tried to just take comfort in the fact that he was still breathing. The medics were almost there. Tony dialed JARVIS and Pepper, updating them on the situation so someone can start looking for the car.
Steve ran full tilt into the kitchen, sliding slightly on his knees as he dropped to the ground to grasp Tony.
Natasha sighed, looking at the floor as she remembered watching Tony die slowly while he kept it to himself.
The god was miffed. The Loki-as-a-scapegoat routine was getting old. He hadn’t antagonized them in any really threatening way in a long time, merely silly pranks.
Steve blushed and shrugged, but let out a content sigh when Tony draped his too small jacket over Steve’s shoulders. He hadn’t wanted to mention it because it wasn’t really that cold out, it was early spring. It’s just that the sun had gone down while they had dinner and now the wind chill was a bit too much for him. He was always embarrassed by his extremely low tolerance for the cold.
Ty’s voice was familiar in a way Tony wasn’t prepared for. It thrust him back to the days when they had been close. It left a bittersweet taste of nostalgia for the friendly rivalry that had helped motivate and keep him sane through his whole childhood. Tony stared at the man in stony silence. A slow smile formed on the kidnapper’s face.
Her voice was slightly gravelly. They both knew she was putting on a brave face. Even the slightest cold, if it lasted too long, could quickly throw an opera star into oblivion, forgotten.
Clint knew a dismissal, so he turned to go. He didn’t like that Tony was alone right now, but JARVIS wouldn’t let him do anything too stupid, he could trust in that fact.
Bruce handed him a piece of paper with crayon scribbles that made absolutely no sense. Tony felt himself grin, the card filling him with warmth. Who needed children when you had bots?
Steve met his gaze, anxious and sad. That was never a good sign, but then again, Steve was more emotional than most.
Tony asked, hand on his hip. He only got even sassier around Janet. The two together could be a nightmare sometimes. When Tony, Janet, and Clint were all three in a room, one’s only hope was to flee before you got caught in their whirlwind.
Steve was reeling. How many things had Tony kept from them? Had he been time travelling and fighting legends this whole time when no one was looking? Had this been before they all met and Tony never felt the need to say? Did Tony truly just not remember it? But he had clearly recognized the sorceress in their kitchen.
The Palais Garnier Opera House had a long history, and was built to last. The decor was beautiful, and the acoustics superb. Every show had sold out, without fail, for the last decade. Nothing was a more popular way for the local aristocracy to socialize and show off, and there was no way Frank would have ever been allowed near the inside with his measly military stipend and small cop wage. Opera was a snobby affair, Frank decided. The old building was also not built with escape routes or threat visibility in mind, unfortunately. Luckily, the opera didn’t seem like a place a fight was likely to break out.
He pointed. Steve followed the line of sight before he spotted the small cave opening in a cliffside nearby. Steve hadn’t noticed that the land had such sharp rises in elevation from the treetops, the leaves had just sort of blurred together so everything looked pretty level. Their path to the river had been at a slight decline, and Steve guessed that if they had been just a bit further east they would have ended up climbing a hill to a dead end.
Tony turned to see the source of light, and was happy to see Steve standing their. He recognized the flashlight for the makeshift warning system it was. THANKS, he signed, ‘for not sneaking up on me.’ He motioned for Steve to come see what he was doing.
Tony realized where he was as he felt himself stop seizing. Since when did he have seizures? No, that’s not right, it had to be because of something the Mandarin was doing. He tried to think about the last thing he remembered but there was him in the chair with the tatters left of his shirt, and now he was on the ground, everything in between was blurry and didn’t make any sense. If he tried to think about it too hard, pain seared through his head. He tried to settle onto his back, but the burns were too raw, and he arched his back up with a hiss of pain.
Steve walked over to the work table, looking over the engineer’s shoulder. A couple comm units with some weird extension was sitting on the table, black outer shell still removed so the inner workings were visible. It could have been anything as far as Steve could tell, but he was sure it was probably brilliant. Tony screwed the casings back onto the pieces, and handed one to Steve. His facial expression was adorably eager.
Clint pulled him up onto the sidewalk into a kiss, savoring the small whine he elicited from Phil as he pulled away.
Tony rolled his eyes, holding in the frustrated growl that tried to escape him. It’s not like he had known Morgana was part of that whole disaster until it was too late.
Tony let his eyes slide shut. He should probably move to the bedroom, but where he had collapsed on the couch seemed good enough for now, even if his back would hate him later. Maybe Steve would find him and carry him to bed. He smiled sleepily at the thought. Exhaustion was where he had been about twelve hours ago. This here? This was Tony surprised he could still move or think. The Halloween party fundraiser for the children’s hospital had gone well enough, at least, the kids seemed happy. Pepper wasn’t, but he’d deal with that tomorrow. Yeah, tomorrow. Sleep sounded nice.
Obadiah had the reactor in his hands and Tony sat, unable to move while the man disconnected the wires. The pain was excruciating, but he couldn’t cry, couldn’t scream. His father’s friend, the man who had helped raise him, walked away with Tony’s heart in hand. Tony should never have trusted him.
Natasha asked Strange. They were in the lead, and only turned around at the sound of Clint’s warning.
Steve saw movement on the far side of the room, and when he honed, he watched in horror as Tony’s body slammed against the wall. He stayed pinned up there, far beyond anyone’s reach, and his breathing looked ragged.
One week she just handed him an envelope at the end of the night with no explanation. Before he could ask, she was already off socializing with the other singers and high society. He stared at the envelope as he walked home that night. It felt a little like as long as he didn’t know what was inside, he could imagine all sorts of wonderful things that were probably unrealistic. Maybe it was a love letter asking him to run away with her. Maybe she was secretly involved in a dangerous conspiracy and needed his help. They were not plausible contents of the envelope, but they were possible as long as he didn’t open it. He could only imagine for so long, though, before he began to feel like an idiot. He ripped open the envelope, cursing himself silently for already being so in love with this woman.
The worry the others always had for him was more painful than disappointment. He didn’t deserve their worry, their friendship, or their respect. He felt much more at home when the public was hurling insults at him, giving him his proper title of monster. A monster was all he saw when he looked in the mirror.
He considered it. He did; he considered asking her to drinks afterwards. But then he thought about his outbursts of rage that he couldn’t seem to control and how sometimes the wrong word sent him back into battle, and he knew that wouldn’t be fair to this woman. Maria probably wouldn’t even want to go out with him anyways. She was a famous opera singer, and he was a nobody.
I tried to capture a glimpse of the overall weirdness of being stuck in the hospital, both as the patient or the visitor. I've been both, as well as staff, and hospitals really feel like another universe sometimes. This one was going to be all fluffy and nice, but it's me, so it turned into a bit of a continuation to hurting Tony.   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ It's still mostly just avengers being a family for each other, I swear.
The room was silent. No one was sure right away if Thor was finished. Peter finally broke the silence,
Tony absolutely beamed at him. It had been a very long and difficult project, trying to figure out some of Steve’s interests. The man was so easygoing and not picky sometimes that it was impossible to tell what he actually liked and what he just didn’t mind. Tony wished Steve was a little more outspoken, but he also appreciated the little mysteries he had to work to solve about Steve. It kept the man interesting. His next project was trying to figure out the supersoldier’s favourite painters and art styles for a wedding portrait, but that was still a secret.
Tony rolled his eyes, leaning down to kiss the supersoldier before walking towards the mouth of the cave.
Tony watched as Steve shoved an incapacitated MODOK into the back of a SHIELD van, feeling pride that his team had won yet again. He felt knocking behind his arc reactor, and suddenly it was harder to breathe again.
Steve thought about Phil while he walked to the cafeteria. The man was very stoic, had been for as long as Steve knew him, but Steve could pick up on the subtleties of his expressions by now. The agent was a nice addition to the tower, a calm voice of reason to a group of arguably crazy people. He wondered what Phil had been like before SHIELD, if he had always been so subdued and deadpan, or if it was a result of the career path he took.
Frank Castle did not start out as a killer. No, he was a loving, gentle, family man. He had a gorgeous wife, Maria, and two beautiful children, Lisa and Frank Jr. He was a soldier, a military career man, but after the war he settled for police work. Maria was an opera singer. They met when Frank was assigned to guard her dressing room, a fairly routine protection detail that all of the starring role actresses got on shownights.
Natasha allowed herself to look back at Thor as she threw Steve over her shoulder. His face was wet with tears, but he was glaring right through the medallion he now held in his hand. Everyone was going to be okay, medical was already almost there. Mjolnir landed in his hand, hard from somewhere else in the tower. Thor met her eyes for a moment before he was crashing through the window. She couldn’t blame him, but she desperately hoped he’d return after taking care of the Enchantress. He needed to know that none of them blamed him. He needed to know not to blame himself.
Maria exclaimed when Frank threw the door open, too hard. She was fine. She looked a little pale and tired, but she was fine.
It was a fairly safe assumption that Howard and Maria had never taken Tony, so Steve figured it was probably Jarvis. The butler was more of a dad to Tony than Howard.
“Steeeeeeve.” Tony whines as he collapses on top of his bed, his stomach and one side of his face squished against the covers. He quickly changes position to lie on his back when his Arc Reactor starts to feel like it’s squeezing the air out of his lungs. When Tony gets no response, he says it even louder and in a much more vexing tone of voice.
“Batteries have a short life span, right?” Tony had said earlier that night as they examined the various papers, beginning to explain it not only for Steve’s sake but for his own, too. “You throw them away once they run out of juice and buy some new ones. But what if you can have a battery that lasts for years? More than ten years? More than twenty? What will you need to accomplish that?”
The sound of the window breaking, accompanied by shattering glass scattering across the floor, echoes through the room and the voices get louder, and much closer. White flashes bounce off the walls and thudding footsteps accompany them, like thunder following lightning.
Finally, after seconds that pass by like hours, the ground stops shaking. Tony tentatively lifts his head up, wrinkling his nose at the smell of smoke. Still on the ground, he tilts his head and looks around him, searching for the familiar sight of Steve next to him. When he sees nothing but grass and dust around him, his stomach lurches and a crushing weight presses down on his chest.
the challenge itself. “We both say things about ourselves and the person who admits to knowing the least loses.”
Tony takes that as their cue to run towards their rental car as if their lives depended on it because in this situation, they do.
Natasha just sighed at the two men, wishing that they both got their heads out of their asses long enough to realise that they both loved each other.
Nobody knew whether or not they should comfort the genius but before they could Tony regained his composure and resumed the film.
Steve’s eye twitched. Of course Tony would be able to recognise what Irene wore if her reminder at the room they shared was any indication of their relationship.
Tony blushed slightly, glancing quickly at Steve before quickly averting his gaze back to the screen. “I can’t remember it all that well to be honest.”
Once Tony’s eyes had stopped showing stars dancing in his vision, he looked up to survey the state that the rest of the team was in. Thor, Steve and Bruce had already shaken off the light exposure, no doubt due to their accelerated healing, whilst Clint and Natasha were only just starting to blink their eyes rapidly to rid themselves of the exposure.
“I’m not an alien Clint, I am a regular human being except for a few differences.” Taking a deep breath to calm his nerves, Tony began his story.
“Not anymore,” she mumbled under her breath which only caused more puzzled looks to be sent her way. “The Romanov’s ruled Russia for just over four hundred years until 1917. In 1918 the main members of the Romanov family were murdered and the rest were exiled. I happen to be a descendant of one of the men who was exiled and I do carry the family name but any claim to royalty is long gone.”
Steve frowned at Tony’s response. He was pretty sure that the mechanic was lying at it had been made apparent that he had almost perfect recall, so why would he feel the need to look at Steve and lie?
Tony waited for the commotion to die down before explaining. “Yes, I had a brother, in some lives I was an only child and in some I was one of many children. In that life it was just me and Mycroft who was seven years older than me.”
“I don’t see why you couldn’t have dissected him whilst he was still alive. Would have given better results I bet.” Clint’s slightly dark comment caused an uncomfortable tension to fill the room as it was uncommon for the archer to get so serious.
“That’s for me to know and you to find out,” grinned Tony, challenge lacing his tone that Natasha had every intention of winning.
Bruce snorted at the quote before pursing his lips in thought. “Were you referring to the Inspector or Blackwood?”
“If you think that is nice my Friend, then wait until you see the Halls of Asgard! They put that banquet hall to shame,” Thor boomed, not as impressed with the elegance as the rest of them.
Clint just leaned back in his seat and mimed zipping his lips up, amusement still dancing in his eyes.
Steve and Thor tried to get in the way of the Hulk’s outreaching arm but were a few seconds too late in stopping the vibrant green arm grabbing the retreating mechanic. Tony let out a grunt as he felt the hand close around his waist and lift him off the ground as though he weighed hardly anything. The other men in the room moved to try and dislodge Tony from Hulk’s grip but Natasha stopped them before they could interfere.
Tony had honestly wanted in that moment to whack the Inspector on the head a few times to see if it was possible for him to grow some brain cells because seriously, stating the obvious at every opportunity was very trying on his temper. Luckily the Inspector’s predictability at times had come in useful so Tony had often let it go without much more than a comment.
“HOW DOES TIN MAN RECOGNISE ONE SMALL BUMP?” Hulk scratched his head as he wondered if the bump in the road had been caused by a smash and if so then it had been a puny smash.
“If you two would just stop your weird flirting as it's way too early for this. Tony, if we have to suffer through a team exercise than so are you or you're going to spend an hour with me sparring.”
I'm not completely happy with this chapter as some part of me feels like its kind of a filler but I've been sitting on it for two days and haven't changed it so I decided to just release it.
Tony woke with a snort, finding himself in his bedroom even though he distinctly remembered passing out on the couch in his lab.
“He must have put up with a lot to be able to ignore your shenanigans,” Bruce sighed well aware how dramatic Tony could be at times in the lab.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” shifted Tony uncomfortably in his seat at the disapproving stares.
“This is going to get worse before it gets better,” Bruce paused before turning to Tony. “It is going to get better, right?”
The two parted and smiled at each other, Steve’s eye sparkling with love and affection. “I had been hoping it was you as I felt bad for having a crush on the Eagle when I had feelings for you. I just felt this connection to him and everything about him reminded me of you, from the colours on his wings to when he said that pineapple on pizza was his favourite just like you. That day when you let me into your lab was the day that I knew that I couldn’t live without you, you were willing to help me learn and it wasn’t the world that I was in awe off, it was you Tony. At how you were everything that I had hoped that future would be, I love you too Tony, but I never knew how to come out and say it.”
Just as he was about to get up and flee, a hand grabbed onto his and pulled him forward as Steve crashed his lips against Tony’s, the words having took a moment to catch up with the super soldier. A few stunned seconds passed as the mechanic took a few embarrassing moments to realise that his words hadn’t been rejected and he gladly began returning the kiss with enthusiasm as the team laughed and groaned at the sight.
“Brittany sage?” questioned Thor, not quite familiar with all the various herbs and spices that Midgard used.
Natasha rolled her eyes. “Right, not a crush. What would you call it when you pay extra attention to him when he comes on and the way you practically swoon and sigh as you hear his clues and listen to his singing?”
“Oh, it’s delightful,” responded Tony, eyes glazing over slightly at the memory of the bread. “It really gives the bread a unique flavour. I’ve never been able to find anything quite like it since.” Tony pauses before a wicked smirk crept onto his face. “I would even say that the flavours of the bread far out matches the flavours of Pop Tarts.”
So that's how I decided to explain how Tony was Sherlock. I felt as though I could do more with the idea of past lives than time travel or never ageing and will hopefully explore it in story second part of this series before Game of Shadows.
Shame washed over him like a bucket of ice water, and Tony felt his eyes begin to sting. Of course Steve was worried that this was going- going to make him
In the bathroom, Steve set Tony down on the edge of the tub with a towel and bottle of water, then hopped into the shower stall, scrubbing himself down with the speed and efficiency only someone who had been in the army was capable of. "Do you want a shower or a bath?" Steve asked once he was done, seemingly unconcerned with the fact that he was dripping all over the tile, standing there in the harsh unforgiving fluorescent lighting and still unbelievably, gorgeously nude.
Tony felt suddenly a little lost, tilting his head to the side a bit in his confusion. "I thought‒" he started, the words slow and sloppy on his tongue, "I thought you wanted to top tonight, honey?" They'd talked about it, earlier, like they usually did, and Tony had laid out under Steve and started going down into his headspace and‒ But this was fine, it was good, Tony could top, he just needed a minute to recalibrate‒
?" Steve swore, snatched his hand away, but Tony was quicker, grabbing Steve's fingers and sliding his hand back to Tony's cock, still not hard but getting harder under his touch.
to be here?" Tony asked desperately, screwing his eyes even tighter together. "Boo hoo, I have cancer, I'm going through chemo, I'm
"You don't mind, do you, darling?" Tony purred, and Steve could see every shiver and twitch and jerk of his body. "My jaw's still a little sore, but I— ah, I figure this wouldn't be a bad c-consolation prize?"
Steve came, felt the heat of it splashing up against his insides, his mouth sucking hot purple bruises to the base of his neck. "Y'gotta soften up, sweetheart," Steve rasped, tongue dragging down the prickling, sensitive skin. "You need to relax your stomach muscles a little so we can fit some more into that tight little body of yours, hmm?" His fingers slid up, rubbing slow, small circles over the round of his belly, the underside of his softened abdomen.
The pair looked like they had been out at a nice dinner and decided to stop for dessert on the way home. The plan was to behave as if they were a little tipsy, just loose enough to be overly talkative with strangers. Natasha would play the flirt role she was so good at, and Clint would be the boyfriend too dull to notice. They had been getting a look of the shop from various points for a couple hours, finding what they could about where ingredients came from and where food was prepped. They had looked over the file, but it was fairly empty because it turns out Abram is an undocumented immigrant who had slipped through the cracks unnoticed.
Steve shivered. He was so cold. There was a source of warmth to his right so he turned towards it. It was so warm, he just wanted it to envelop him and get rid of this wretched iciness. At first he thought maybe it was a fire because of how hot it was, but he didn’t hear any crackling. If it was Tony then he had a worrisomely high fever. That was when Steve’s sluggish thoughts started catching up. Shit, Tony… Tony was kidnapped by the Mandarin… They had gone to save him and…
He felt a little like an idiot, yelling into an empty room. There was no response, so Tony continued on, but stayed on high alert. Figuring he may as well check on everything while he was down here, he did a cursory check of the main reactor. Power levels were down a little, though that could be natural decrease in the reactor’s third year in a row. The element inside could not last forever, considering that the energy it created came from the decay of said element. It still didn’t have a name. The patent office just flat out refused, even under threat of lawsuit, to let him call it Badassium.
Clint watched Tony take a long drag of his liquor while he settled himself back on the ground. Tony motioned with his hand for Clint to continue from before, placing the hoodie on his lap like a blanket.
Tony studied his friend’s face. And they were friends, he knew that, but he also knew that he and Clint had never really talked about serious stuff. There was sort of an unspoken agreement that if one of them came to the other upset, it was to escape talking about it, to escape everything and just get drunk and be stupid. This was new territory, but Clint didn’t show any hint of this being a game.
She left the room, cackling evilly, Tony swore that was an evil laugh. Agent stepped forward with a file pulled out of nowhere as far as Tony can tell. He leafed through pages as he sat at a table at the foot of the bed.
The waves of nausea got stronger as he felt his fever rise. He pitched forward, Steve holding him steady as he emptied the contents of his stomach into a mixing bowl. He leaned back against Steve, just breathing with his eyes closed.
The unmistakable sound of the flex cage bounding around someone was loud enough through the wall and Tony held his breath. All that accompanied the sound was a muffled
JARVIS scanned the man beneath him, and his own neural electrical activity changed the moment he claimed to stop releasing pheromones. That was the most confirmation he was going to get, and he needed to get to his creator ASAP.
he said, quickly leading Steve out of the door, deliberately talking over Abram’s protests that that was way too much money, but the sound was cut off as the door shut behind them. Thank God the door had shut because Tony’s babbling had turned to naughty actions performed with whipped cream. Steve was so happy that this was one of the less crowded streets of New York, because he most certainly did not want those quotes ending up in the tabloids.
Steve wrapped his arms around his genius and put their foreheads together, just breathing in his presence. Tony could feel how tense the supersoldier was, so he started kneading at the others shoulders. The boiling anxiety slowly subsided to a simmer in the background. That was probably the best he could get at the moment.
By Odin, this was why he loved this woman, with such a pure heart. How could she expect him to leave her?
Much to Tony’s discomfort, Dr. Strange made himself comfortable, sitting down in mid-air as though a chair existed there. His cloak billowed slightly behind him despite the air being still. Screw the laws of physics whenever Strange was around. He had his hands clasped in front of his face for a moment, looking deep in thought. He dropped them to his lap before continuing.
He asked cautiously. Tony kept everyone at arm’s length most of the time. He didn’t want to jinx this.
Of course the last fucking branch was Tony’s only miscalculation. It must have already been structurally compromised on the underside, because it was definitely big enough to hold his weight with no sound this close to the tree trunk. The cracking sound gave him away, so it was now or never.
Another two had arrived with a stretcher and they were lifting Tony onto it. Steve followed beside them, holding Tony’s outstretched hand. Tony looked like he was about to say something, but instead cried out in pain and clutched at his abdomen. His breathing remained labored all the way to the helicopter, where it stopped altogether. Steve was gently pushed into a seat while they started manually inflating Tony’s lungs, and Steve’s world was spinning. Tony  was writhing in pain, still semi-conscious and all Steve could do was watch helplessly. When they landed at the hospital, Steve tried to stand and follow, but his knees locked in place and he was so dizzy.
Howard was handing him a glass of brown liquid, and Tony tried to give it back. He didn’t want it, it smelled bad and it reminded Tony of how his dad’s breath would smell when things were bad. Howard pushed it into his hand harder and glared at Tony, and he just wanted the man to look happy with him once. He downed the glass, and promptly broke off into a coughing fit while his throat burned and tasted acrid. Tony should’ve walked away.
Steve watched as Strange pulled an unmoving Iron Man through the flickering portal with him, just as it disappeared from the room. The sorcerer let out a roar with the effort, and as soon as they were through, collapsed into a heap on the ground. Iron Man was face down, still not moving.
Tony’s blissful doze was broken when he felt Steve shifting and heard a groan. Tony sat up and looked over at Steve, whose face was flushed and his expression was pained.
Steve leaned over him, and Tony wasn’t going to argue with a kiss. When Steve pulled back sharply, it was because one of the monitors attached to Tony’s chest was beeping at the change angrily. A nurse came in then, alerted by the change, to check on them.
JARVIS sounded genuinely grateful. Tony was surrounded by people, and AIs, that cared so much. If only he could convince himself that he deserved it.
Warnings for self-hatred and suicidal ideation, mentions of 616 events where characters die and get seriously injured, but it's comics so none of it is permanent. Everyone is alive at the end I swear.
He looked at the clock, 9:00AM. By the way he felt he probably got an hour and a half of sleep at the most. That was plenty for him, though, since his nightmares were torturous last night.
It really sucked trying to convince someone to kill you. Tony never imagined he’d actually be suggesting that someone take him apart. J3XM99 was all mechanical parts and program AI, so it almost seemed like cannibalism, he thought deliriously. A giggle bubbled out of him at the thought.
He walked over to the kitchen and poured a glass of whiskey. He downed it, poured another, and grabbed a six pack out of the fridge. Unwanted, the events of the MODOK battle replayed in his head. He slid down the wall, taking a gulp of the second glass.
Steve asked, and he made it sound like a trap. Like whatever Tony said next might lead into unknown consequences.
Steve Rogers often forgot that he wasn’t just a man. Captain America was a symbol of hope and patriotism, and the man behind the mask was often put on a pedestal. The average american who didn’t personally know him typically had their own distinct ideas about who Steve should be. Tony tried to make the man understand that, but he never wanted to listen.
everyone will be okay. This specific plot will be continued later in the month for one of the other prompts, so the injured characters can recover. This is kind of all hurt without the comfort I'm sorry! There's bits of Stony and Phlint in this one. Warning for bleeding I suppose.
Tony pulled on his sweatpants fairly easily. But when he went to raise his arms to slip on the t-shirt, his ribs and clavicle argued and he cried out, dropping the shirt. Steve caught the shirt and pulled Tony into a gentle hug in one swift move. He gently brought Tony’s arms into the shirt and pulled it over his head, thankfully not saying ‘I told you so.’
Bruce sat beside her and looked exhausted, so Clint had nothing to do but follow suit. He looked up at the capsicle uncomfortably.
The attempt to comfort the supersoldier was slightly undermined by the fresh wave of pain that washed over him, making him arch his back with a surprised gasp before collapsing onto the bed again.
The king sounded casually conversational. Tony heard him take a seat somewhere behind him, and he couldn’t get the right angle to see.
Tony was making grand gestures and speaking like a talk show host. It broke the awkward mood and he felt victorious.
Tony suddenly felt very tired, and didn’t want to have this conversation. It was a trap, this was going to become one of
Agent Coulson was looking down at Tony from behind the kneeling Captain. Tony saw the gratefulness in the man’s eyes and it had all been worth it. He was on a stretcher and Steve wasn’t pulled away. Tony finally let his eyes slide shut, and the world went black.
He was hoping to bury himself in his work until he passed out. The last thing he wanted to do right now was think about the last few days. He whipped through the newest bow design, trudged through some new weapons for Natasha, and started to work on the atomic structure for rip-proof shorts for Bruce when it all came crashing down. He pushed back from the table, running his hands through his hair as the chair clattered to the ground. His throat ached for the burn of vodka, but he feared JARVIS would betray him.
The pain in his torso helpfully chose that moment to give him a wave of agony that had him gasping for the breath, arching his back until he was leaned up against the wall again. When he caught his breath again,
Steve looked at her, confused. His confusion distracted him from his despair and panic for a moment.
he asked, sarcastic smile plastered on his face in an attempt to hide the fear. This is when Tony always expected people to run screaming.
He pulled Steve towards him, and Steve leaned his head towards Tony. Tony kissed his forehead and they leaned their foreheads together.
Steve scrubbed his tears out of the way so he could get a proper look. He was already taking apart the suit, muscle memory taking over.
The silence was tense while they waited for the demon to consider Loki’s words. Bruce watched the interaction carefully, keeping the Hulk away for now. If Loki was being submissive, it meant he probably hadn’t been lying about how powerful this demon was here. A fight was not what they wanted, but he was growing more worried for Tony. And angry at his friend for never mentioning any of it.
Tony felt sweat pouring down his face, which was weird. Maybe he’d been working harder than he thought? That seemed unlikely since apparently MODOK was content to let his grunts do all the dirty work before he’d even join the fight, always ducking back and hiding when one of them got close to him.
Tony bit back an exasperated sigh. Something about Steve’s quiet request told him to be nice. He spun to face the blond, resigning himself to the fact that he’d probably have to finish this project tomorrow.
Steve whispered, watching the enchanted mirror Loki had given him. It felt unreal, watching Tony suffer like that for no reason at all. It was impossible to even tell what she was doing to the man, only that he was in agony. There were five hours left of the 24 hours Mephisto had given himself. That meant Tony had only been in Hell for a little over 20 hours, but he looked like he had been there for a week. Loki hadn’t been able to explain how the magic or Hell itself would affect Tony, so they could only pray there was no permanent damage.
It wasn’t until after his parents’ deaths and his subsequent inheritance of Stark Industries that he truly began to understand the meaning of her words. A 21 year old Tony, who had never really had any guidance from his parents, was thrust into all of their responsibilities; He had to be the new Howard Stark. How was a scared basically-kid still in shock from loss supposed to shoulder the weight? He resorted to the only thing he knew, mimicry.
Steve looked so sad and confused, Tony felt so heartless for the laugh that slipped past his lips unwanted. Steve pulled his hands away, irritated.
Thor sat there quietly and Clint tried to avoid looking at him. He looked so angry and brooding, the static in the air around him was palpable. It was times like these that Clint suddenly remembered how powerful and terrifying Thor was.
That was when the staggered pitter patter of dirt on the coffin above her began. Great, she was already in the ground. She was being buried alive. Krupp’s voice startled her, and she hit her forehead on the surface above her again.
So Iron Man had showed up to the battle ready to leave, and he went in hard. Loki’s magical birds that were harassing citizens and stealing food were felled in ten seconds flat when Iron Man shot small bullets at them all simultaneously. Loki’s grin had quickly morphed into a snarl,
Tony had not joined him in bed for weeks. Steve knew there was a couch in his lab that he often crashed on, and that it was October, but every time he asked JARVIS what Tony was up to, the answer was always that he was working. Not once had it been sleeping. Plus Tony wasn’t showing any of the signs of stress he usually did this time of year; the genius seemed
It hurt Steve, the way Tony sounded so casual about that. His tone gave no inkling of sarcasm or that he had the notion that there was something wrong with that.
Peter wrapped his arms around Bruce’s neck. They hugged, tight. No one had anything they could say to a revelation like that. Tony had no regrets in letting Bruce tell the tale, and Steve was glad for it. Peter had recently been more curious about the Other Guy and how that could be his Uncle Bruce at the same time. Neither of them felt capable of explaining the ideas of repressed anger that Bruce encompassed, but Bruce had explained it beautifully and in a way an eight year old could still understand.
he smiled brightly. He wasn’t wrong. Tony often didn’t feel anything until the fifth drink depending on the strength, and these were just glasses of champagne. He typically drank straight liquor.
When Steve ripped the mask off of his attacker, the shock of seeing a vampire’s familiar fangs almost sent him back to WWII. He certainly had never thought he’d see them again after HYDRA had been properly banished from Transylvania.
The Asgardian looked like it physically pained him to admit there were people more powerful than him. Natasha thought it was funny, because he always seemed to conveniently forget that the Avengers had taken him down.
It turned out Wade was still allowed to spend the night, probably because Tony and Steve never really liked to send him home to his abusive parents, though they hadn’t found proof to give to children’s services yet. Peter was going to be grounded for two weeks.
The Red Skull made a shoo motion with his hand, as though the motivations of their alliance were trivial. This arrogant human knew not who he messed with.
he commented, and Tony was looking at him blankly. Then it all must have clicked into place, because Tony was laughing and slapping Phil’s shoulder.
When did she find out that Agent likes to tase Tony? Seriously, was everyone conspiring behind Tony’s back and they all were actually best friends? This creepy doctor already knew Agent and JARVIS too well. Tony decided to give up understanding the ways of people. He should just stick to robots… and Steve. As long as Steve would stick with him, anyways.
Tony nodded in agreement, before signing something to JARVIS. Steve didn’t recognize any of the signs, but he supposed he had never learned any technical terms in sign language because he had no need for them. It wasn’t so different from the usual not being able to understand half of what Tony said. It came with the territory of loving a genius.
He couldn’t remember what happened. All he could remember was Tony looking broken so high up on the wall, out of his reach. Where is he? Is he ok? He tried to open his eyes but he felt so heavy.
Tony shook his head, confused. He had had these thoughts swirling in his head for so long, being ingrained as fact with no one refuting them. He had never thought hard enough about this to notice the flaws in his logic.
Tony scrubbed his hands over his face, looking his age for once. It was easy to forget that he was older than most of them, well, older than all the naturally aging people.
Phil said, leading him down the hall. He had no idea where Phil was taking him, but he followed anyway. He may be terrified to be blind, but he’d blindly follow Phil Coulson any day.
Natasha punched him in the stomach, knocking the air out of him. He gasped and coughed, unable to move away from her or bend over in pain.
Clint shuddered. Poor Steve, he was not going to be happy that this had happened again when he woke up. He looked at Natasha, and she was staring at him. They both knew that everyone had gotten hit with their fears, but the question was how. There's no way Tony would sell them out, especially Steve.
He heaved again, but there wasn’t much in his stomach anyway. He wiped his mouth and stood, squaring his shoulders.
Steve slammed the door shut and let out a sigh. If MODOK didn’t have such an ego and superiority complex, he probably would have been much harder to defeat. Tony had explained to him before how MODOK always seemed to know what they would do before they did it. His ability to calculate probabilities so well was truly astonishing. The only way they had defeated them last time was when Tony had decided to act impulsively and irrationally in order to be unpredictable. That had been way too risky and Tony had broken several bones. After the riot act Steve had read him that time, Tony agreed to ask Steve for a plan before taking desperate measures from then on.
Steve glanced over to see what Tony was talking about. Sure enough, there was someone leaning out and watching the scene unfold, and Steve couldn’t blame the caller who had called the man a scarecrow. The costume certainly looked like a classic horror movie scarecrow.
Clint beamed at them. He never got to make the plans that saved the day, since he was always just a little slower at coming up with them. He was just as good a tactician as Steve, just not as fast. He liked to blame the serum for the difference.
Clint burst into a fit of giggles at his own joke, which no one else thought was that funny. Phil rolled his eyes.
The black was beginning to take over all of Tony’s vision, and his body felt like it was entirely pins and needles. Was he even breathing any more? Probably not, because his diaphragm just did that involuntary jerk that comes from a body desperately trying to oxygen.Tony blinked hard, and he could still see a little, but when the the arc reactor was slotted back into place, everything was white and electric and coconut.
Tony had been predictably correct. The next morning, every news station across TV and radio was talking about Captain America’s engagement to Iron Man. Steve decided his morning run was not worth it when he saw the crowd waiting right outside the tower. He decided to ignore Tony’s ‘I told you so’ smug face when he returned from the lobby and headed to the gym to use the treadmill. Tony was still in the kitchen watching another news channel an hour later.
Tony ground out. He tried to give Steve a reassuring smile because the man looked so miserable and Captain America should never be that sad. Steve Rogers should never be that sad. He knew it was more of a grimace and it was hard to breath. The pain was growing with every second and he was dying.
Strange took the empty seat directly in front of the back door between an empty seat and one of the couples, and Clint and Phil took seats facing away from the entertainment room. The corner Clint was now facing had a small china hutch shoved in it, filled with dishware that looked like it may come crashing out at any moment. Phil started some conversation about a TV show that Clint pretended to know while he carefully felt around with his feet under the table for outlets or wires. Detecting nothing that way, he subtly felt around with his left hand but the table had rough wood on the underside and some nails or screws sticking out here and there, and he really didn’t want a splinter. If there was some tech that was going to put on a show for them, it wasn’t under the table anyway, he decided. The next thing to look out for would be any stream of light that could be from a projector hidden in the walls.
Bruce wasn’t Hulk, so Tony must still be alive. There’s no way he’d still be himself if Tony was dead. Steve had to remind himself of that. The doctor cleared her throat.
Tony ground out. He tried to give Steve a reassuring smile because the man looked so miserable and Captain America should never be that sad. Steve Rogers should never be that sad. He knew it was more of a grimace and it was hard to breath. The pain was growing with every second and he was dying.
The pain ripped through him as something made contact with his side. Tony’s movements were outside of his control, his muscles twitching painfully before the current ceased. The haze of pain left him confused as to where he was for a moment.
Steve breathed. He put his face in his hands and let out a long sigh. He was still for a long moment before he looked up again, all traces of feeling gone.
The words straight from the international bounty Tony had had no clue about. He was vaguely aware that his legs had buckled. He thought the Mandarin wasn’t real; that all of this nonsense was behind him.
Tony scrubbed a hand over a tired face. He had not been sleeping much lately. October was one of his busiest times of the year for SI because the shareholders always panicked in November about the yearly summary. Over the years he found that having extra inventions up his sleeve to assure them that it had been a productive year kept them from getting their panties in a bunch. On top of his business duties, the Avengers tended to have extra missions in October since Halloween seemed to inspire even the most trivial villains to get up to no good.
Steve grabbed one of the glasses he knew Tony had drank from, more thankful than he’d ever been for his eidetic memory.
Steve met Tony’s eyes. Tony blushed and looked away. He cleared his throat and waved his hand around in the air. Apparently JARVIS understood that to mean to continue.
I'd like to say, my favourite headcanon for superfamily is with Tony and Steve adopting teenage Peter, but here I've had him adopted much younger because I like imagining how they would have raised him when he was little. Also, if anyone is trying to figure out a timeline here that connects all these chapters? It's best you don't, because there isn't one that works. At least not on purpose. I hope this one is fun!
He saw the bright red on the sharp edge of a metal sheet before he felt the sharp pain of his hand sliced open. He hissed at the stinging pain, running his hand under the sink so he could see how bad it was. It wasn’t too deep so it probably wouldn’t need stitches. He wrapped the nearest rag tight around his hand. This wouldn’t have happened if Tony hadn’t been distracted thinking about Steve’s hurt face staring at him upstairs. How the man who took down platoons of Nazis by himself without breaking a sweat could look like such a kicked puppy was beyond Tony.
Steve agreed. The room was beginning to feel stifling, and he closed the door quickly before anything could draw him back in. He wandered the halls of the helicarrier, nodding at agents who greeted him, trying to put out an unapproachable vibe. Eventually stepping outside, the harsh wind was welcoming. Steve leaned against a wall with his eyes closed, just focusing on the way the wind battered his clothing and face. He didn’t know how long he stood there, but was brought back to the present by a hand placed on his shoulder gently.
Steve closed the message, not wanting to deal with that train of thought until Tony was asleep again.
He let go and Tony gasped for air, his throat burning and lungs not filling properly. His lungs already didn’t have enough space with the arc reactor in his chest, so panic and mangled ribs were not a great combination for catching his breath. He had to actively force himself to take slower breaths until they felt a little more natural.
How could someone do something like this to someone like Tony? All in the name of  him being Captain America, ‘unsoiled’? The idea of Steve being with another man was so frightful to someone that they’d poison Iron Man just to stop it? It was completely illogical and  crazy, but that was the point. Steve was terrified in this very moment, and it was coupled with a rage and illogical desire to beat the waiter to death. Such violence wouldn’t help Tony survive, and it would do zero good for the world, but the idea of it alone helped assuage some of Steve’s fear. Fear could truly turn the gentlest of men to inhumane acts. It shouldn’t have been such a surprise to Steve, he had already seen it played out in the war, but the shock of it was real everytime he faced that reality. Tony would be okay, he had to be, but Steve would be haunted by this forever.
Tony replied, trying to be light. He was already trying to think of solutions in his head, maybe he could alter the reactor to also be the pacemaker. Though then he’d depend on the damn thing even more.
Tony heard her screams in his nightmares far too often, as her father was being threatened at gunpoint. The whole town was full of refugees, some who had lost limbs and family because of
he finished the code he was working on before turning to face the blond warily. This could be the argument he was hoping to avoid. While makeup sex was good, Tony preferred not adding emotional stress to his days if he could avoid it.
Peter looked filled with awe at the statement. He was so lucky to have so many cool aunts and uncles. Who else at school could say they had a god as an uncle?
Dracula would be lying if he said he felt no gratitude to Steven Rogers. He would never admit such a thing out loud, of course, but he knew HYDRA would still be a thorn in his side without the man. Steve knew he had to be thankful to Dracula as well. Without him and his cabaal, the allied forces may not have defeated the fairly powerful Transylvanian faction of his sworn enemy. So when Red Skull approached the vampire king around seventy years later with his proposal to team up against the Avengers, he was understandably conflicted.
Madame whatever-her-name-was (Amora didn’t care) may be the expert in human Voodoo here, but Amora knew her gods.
Steve was still inspecting the cave, looking for any signs that a predator was using it as a den at night. He didn’t see anything, and they needed to get some firewood while there was still some light out if they didn’t want to spend the night in total darkness.
Steve visibly deflated beside him, which said a lot because he had already looked pretty deflated and miserable.
Tony looked at Steve in shock. This was so out of the blue, but to be honest, why weren't they married yet? Tony could see the wedding in his mind now, it'd be awesome. He'd have to get Pepper planning right away and he's so going to make Rhodey wear the suit as best man. There will be fireworks and…
Tony drifted off to the amber honey tones of Steve’s singing. Maybe there were some upsides to camping, not that he’d admit it out loud.
The sudden, overwhelming desire to laugh took hold of Clint for a moment, but he thankfully stifled it. There’s no way Tony would take that well.
His head hurt, probably from the crying and exhaustion, but he didn’t want to sleep at the moment. Something was starting to nag at him, but he couldn’t tell what it was. Seeing Julie again had made him think about Tony’s hospital stay after the heart attack. Something about that was bugging him but what was it? His care had been terrific, obviously, that’s why he’s got the same doctor and PCA again. SHIELD has decided they’re good. So that’s not it.
The sight made Tony look so small. The anger bled out of Clint, leaving behind exhaustion and pity. He sighed, setting about to rekindle the flames. When he settled down on the other side of the fire, Tony still hadn’t looked away from the flames.
Steve was trembling as he gripped Tony’s hand. Natasha and Clint had to pry him away as the medics laid Tony onto the stretcher, Bruce undoing the safety latches of Tony’s suit in nothing but boxers. The pieces of the suit were strewn on the pavement as Tony was wheeled away, the medics already doing CPR before they made it to the ambulance. Steve couldn’t look away as they drove off, and he was glad for Natasha and Clint’s steady hands, holding him up because his knees were weak.
Clint and Nat go undercover, and we actually find out what's going on. Who's after the Avengers this time?
the voice rumbled with Dracula’s natural tone as well as the whispers of his minions all around the castle chamber.
So this is my first muti-chapter fic on ao3, I don't know if I've mentioned that. The whole fic is already written, but doing formatting things is take AGES. So they'll be posted as I finish them, no promises on dates.
Steve, Tony, and Peter grab the telescope and head out for a nighttime picnic under the blood moon. They all know the blood moon is just an excuse for the outing, but it doesn't matter. It's a beautiful sight and Peter can have some alone time with his dads. The tower was great, but sometimes it got to be a little overwhelming, and Peter had only been there for a couple years now. It was nothing like growing up with Aunt May and Uncle Ben.
It felt a little like a confession of feelings deeper than friendship, but Steve hoped Tony didn’t focus on that. Steve was still trying to make sense of the tangle of feelings he got when he looked at the genius. He wasn’t ready to discuss them quite yet. Tony had stopped crying and was staring wide-eyed at Steve.
Tony frowned. How could he make it make sense to someone like Steve? Steve was so perfect, didn’t have sins to balance out.
She was trying to get him to snap out of whatever this was, because he obviously wasn’t seeing them. The screaming was gone as his voice had gone hoarse and now it sounded more like a forced exhale against a rough throat, or a whispered scream. The sound was unnerving, on top of the fact that Clint’s eyes were wide but he gave no sign of noticing them there.
That was probably the worst news the sorcerer could’ve given. No, scratch that, it could’ve been untraceable.
While Steve had been climbing, Tony had managed to make a sack of sorts out of the sleeves of his undersuit that he cut off. Steve could see the pieces of the armor sticking out on all sides. It hung down Tony’s back, with it tied to fit like a sash in front of him, and it had to be heavy.
It all finally made sense. Things were always about the damn serum. Of all the things the serum could do, helping vampires become immune to UV rays was the last thing any of them would’ve expected. Tony already had some theories as to why, but he’d need to study some of Natasha’s blood with Steve’s first. He made a mental note to get a sample before he fixed her. Bruce will be excited to look at it with him, he was sure. As soon as he wasn’t being controlled by Dracula, that is. Maybe he shouldn't have been so quick to send the Hulk in. A vampire Hulk was extra terrifying.
He had never been good at comforting. Bruce cleared his throat and shook his head, unable to say anything. Strange took that as his cue to move on to Natasha.
His mouth curved into a small smile. He started walking in a semi circle around Tony, Tony watched him warily.
The assassin took Clint’s place in front of her family. She looked nervous for a moment, something none of them had ever seen on her.
Nathan Dolly practiced for years. It was not easy to mold a wax doll into a real person’s likeness on the spot, but by the time he took on the alias of Mr. Doll? He could do it in 10-15 seconds flat, depending on the details required for that person. That skill was not easily gained, it took hard work. So, when he began using his hard-earned skill to torture rich people into giving him money, well, hard work had got him there!
He was watching Tony expectantly. It had seemed like a rhetorical question to Tony, but what did he know?
When he made it to the top, he craned his neck, trying to see as far as possible in all directions. The position was awkward because he had to hold onto a branch with one hand for balance, unable to just stand up straight on a branch. There were woods in every direction into the horizon. He could make our the winding opening in the canopy of leaves that must be a river. They could follow the river and hope for the best. There was usually civilization near rivers. He wondered what country they might be in. Not a lot of places were left in the world with forests this large.
‘Sorry,’ Tony formed the word with his lips. Bruce could almost pretend he could hear a voice to accompany the movement, and it made him feel a little better. Tony smiled when some of the clear tension left his friend’s shoulders. Maybe Bruce was more comfortable lip-reading than signing. ‘Want to join me in the lab? I’ll show you my prototype comms.’
It wasn’t really as if Steve could sleep while Tony was being held captive, and who could blame him? He knew he’d be better off if he did, seeing as it was going on 48 waking hours now, and even super-soldiers needed sleep, but he just couldn’t. Every time he closed his eyes he saw Tony falling, the arc reactor dark. If he kept his eyes closed for too long he started imagining the torture that the Mandarin might be doing to Tony. He silently cursed his imagination and his own experiences with torture for fueling it.
Without further ado, Tony took the vial with blue liquid from the suitcase full of them and injected it into his leg. No need having to explain needle marks to the team, right? The AI chose not to respond. It’s not like the man would listen anyway.
Kneeling beside him, she reached for his wounded arm. The flinch was instinctual, they had only just escaped the building where he’d been beaten daily for weeks, so he couldn’t really be blamed. He allowed her to take his arm into her hands, though.
Tony dropped his head to his hands. He couldn’t do this right now; he was so bone tired and (although he’d never admit it) scared. Raza still haunted his nightmares. He let out a long sigh.
Another tense moment past before Bruce made up his mind. He sat down on the floor, smiling at Peter.
Tony stopping behind her automatically gave control back to his own legs, which he definitely should have thought about because he immediately started to crumple, stumbling forward and catching himself on a tree before he could fall. Unfortunately, he caught himself with his left arm, which made the pain lance up his side.
The Avengers had been gathered into the movie room to watch whatever Tony was demanding they watch. Everyone had already finished scolding the man for coming back from simple camping all banged up. The previous evening’s dinner had consisted of a series of lectures, followed by a hilariously flustered Tony finding out that yes, Tony Talks were a thing. He had fled the scene then, spending the night in his lab reviewing footage from their night vision goggles.
Phil looked over at Steve. They were probably feeling similarly, and an empathetic friend could do them both some good right now.
JARVIS’ sensors picked up the movement in the back hallway first, an unnaturally quick blur of a man darting across the doorway into the lobby, before peaking out.
He said as he walked into their kitchen, bringing out the tools for that hot chocolate Steve had already forgotten about. Still flushed and breathing a little shallow, he stepped up behind Tony, wrapping his arms around the genius’ waist. Tony melted into the touch of course, and leaned his head back for a chaste kiss before continuing to make the hot chocolate.
Wade burst out laughing, and that was really more of a cackle. Wade was cackling at him and Peter glared at the other kid. Wade showed no remorse and just stuck his tongue out before Peter took off chasing him towards his room.
Phil started the coffee pots while Clint went to wake Steve. He was very tense because if this didn’t work, they had no backup plan. Clint opened the door and looked at his sleeping friends. Steve was curled around Tony like a protective covering, which would only make this more difficult. Waking Steve is always tricky because if he’s having a war dream, Clint usually gets hurt then Steve feels awful. As long as he didn’t touch Steve, he was safe, but that meant he had to talk without waking Tony. He got as close to Steve’s ear as he could without touching anyone.
The tubes he was hooked up to said he’d been unconscious for awhile. “In fairness, this has got to be a first that someone saved a life by cannibalism, so, Tony slurred, already feeling drugs pull him back under.
Tony’s head had dropped back down to his arms already, but he shook with laughter. Natasha threw a butter knife at his head.
Clint waltzed into the kitchen cheerfully. He poured himself a mug of coffee while he took in Steve, Natasha, and Bruce who were already seated there. He couldn’t help the chuckle that escaped his lips. Their tired looks reminded him of when he had first lost his hearing. People didn’t realize that they actually liked some level of noise. True silence could be disconcerting when you weren’t used to it. He had been entirely unable to sleep without his hearing aids in the first night, which his doctor had expressly advised against.
