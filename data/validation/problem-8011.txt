“You found her.” Natasha wouldn’t have called him otherwise.
Sorry about how long this took to publish. Hope you had a wonderful holiday. And that you all are well.
"Take out then. What do you feel like?" asked Tony.
“Looks like Papa is waking up, sweet pea.”
“I’m in the tub, Papa. I’m not wearing anything,” she said.
“You hate museums,” said Steve.
"Thank you."
Steve dried his eyes on his sleeve.
He set a large plate of food in front of him. Steve ate slowly, wanting to extend his time with the alpha.
"You shouldn't be apologizing to me. He was lucky to have you there. Do you need me to come over?" asked Rhodes.
“You aren’t,” said Tony.
“What happened?! Let me see you!” yelled Tony.
“There’s still one thing we have to discuss,” said Edith.
“I’ll be there for you and the pup. And knock some sense into you when you need it,” said Rhodes.
“What are you doing?”
He nodded. She’d only been scruffed once before, when she accidentally ran into a busy road. Daddy had yanked her back to the sidewalk before anything could happen. He scruffed her then told her never do that again. Daddy did it protect her. He’d looked so scared when that happened. Was that what he looked like now?
“I was concerned for your health,” said Jarvis.
“You need sleep,” he said.
“Alright, I’m going to explore. You okay on your own?"
“So you’ll let me go?”
“I’m sorry, Hap.” What else could he say? He put on Happy's favorite TV show.
“But compared everyone- ”
*****
The apology caught him off guard. Apologies were rare and extremely difficult for Tony. The robotic tone of his voice made it difficult to tell its sincerity.
“Dad, I hope you’re proud of me,” said Steve.
The watch transformed into the same electromagnetic straps around his arm.
“Her scent is almost gone,” said Steve, tonelessly.
"Nothing I can explain," she said, letting her hat fall to cover her eyes again.
"Hello, Piper, it's so good to see you again," Edith said.
Thor launched Tony in the opposite direction. Steve didn’t react. Keeping a calm head was the answer to this.
January 9, 2013
Thirty minutes later the pup was awake. Her bunny dragged along the floor as she walked toward him.
“Where is she?” the omega gasped, refusing to let go despite the pain.
“Ready, Cap?” asked Clint from the pilot’s seat.
Steve pushed against it. There was a groan but nothing happened.
“Hey!”
“TONY!”
“A good dream,” said Steve.
"Everything looks perfect, Steve."
He pulled a blanket over his lap. “Any alpha a mile away could smell me."
“To check on you,” he said.
“Jarvis, how many missed calls do I have?”
Piper shook her head. "Most people don't teach how they did. You don't get hurt for getting something wrong or not paying attention. My brain just thought it would. I'm sorry for taking so long."
“Not that I’m complaining but what brought that on?” asked Tony.
Killian laughed. He pulled a muzzle from his jacket pocket. Steve had seen one like it before. His fight doubled. It locked around his face. A vapor filled his sense. His vision grew dark.
When was the last time he saw it? It felt like an eternity now. He quietly stepped toward Steve, not wishing to break moment, hoping that whatever bliss it was would maybe pass onto him by proximity alone. A stabbing pain in his foot stopped his silent approach.
“It’s Jarvis, he’s found something.”
“You’ll be better at than you think. I've seen you do amazing things, you can do this too,” said Steve.
Steve showed her the ring. It was a pale silver band, simple and beautiful perfectly suited to Steve's personality.
Tony absolutely loved Steve’s possessive side it was so very attractive.
“Why didn’t I hear about it?”
"No."
“I got him,” said Clint.
“How are you feeling?” asked Papa.
"I'll be performing a basic physical exam, and I'll take some blood samples," she said.
"I'll be there in an hour," said Tony.
he reminded himself. Steve ran into the lab, nearly crashing into Dum-E and U.
“I have something that might help.”
“I need you to watch, Piper.”
“Let me take care of you first.”
“It's lighter than I thought. How much does it weigh?” he asked.
"You want to know why I'm so sure about my job security? Without me, all that responsibility and commitment falls on you. And you, along with this company, will drown under it all," she growled.
“My mother Queen Elizabeth wanted to make sure you received this. She didn’t believe you would want the ceremony of a knighthood. And she sends her apologies for not being in attendance. She truly wished to be here,” said Charles.
Tony emerged from lab around seven the next morning. There was one sure-fire way to get back onto Steve's good side, and that was through his stomach. Blueberries and mangos prove to be the omega's favorite. He flipped open the pastry box. Steve had eaten the centers of the remaining cinnamon buns, leaving the outer shell.
“What look?” asked Tony. His fingers toyed with the handle of his teacup.
“I'm only doing my job, Mr. Stark. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions.”
Rune was leaning against the beta’s side. Piper was tucked in the big omega’s arm with an alpha looking her over. The way they looked at her was unlike anything he'd ever witnessed; like she was the most valuable thing in the world.
“Tony will notice if I don’t smell like an omega,” he said.
"I know, sweetheart," said Tony.
“How? I can’t control an unknown.”
"Take him to radiology. We've got to see what we're dealing with."
“Thank you for being our daughter’s friend,” said Steve.
“Morning,” Steve said.
“Steve?”
“I’m on my way, Steve,” he whispered.
“I don’t know if you can tell but I’ve patterned my whole look after you. My hair doesn’t look right but there’s no product in it,” said Gary, taking off his hat.
They weren't going to drop until he gave them something.
Their attention moved from their daughter to the boy clinging to Hill’s side.
“Bloody hell.”
He wasn’t going to push his presence on Steve. Tony kissed Steve before letting him get back to work. When he got into bed he knocked Steve’s box from the bed.
Piper woke up crying from a nightmare. Normally, when she had a bad dream she’d go to her parent’s room. Sleeping in either in Papa’s or Daddy’s arms. It was one of the safest places in the world. She went to Theodore’s corner. His eyes opened instantly at her approach.
“Thank you.” Natasha folded it neatly into her purse.
"Please, Piper, look at me," plead Papa.
“What’s this?”
*****
"No, no, just us."
"How much longer until he's here?" asked Steve.
"I can understand why you wouldn't want to approach it. This whole thing hasn't been easy for either of us. We're both stressed."
“We are awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark, hoping he will give us his reaction to the attack," a reporter.
"Come with me?" asked Steve.
“No."
“Shit."
He tossed her into the air as she giggled, before setting her down. Piper scowled at the cucumbers slices on her plate.
“He got out in that state,” said Clint.
“11:30.”
He wasn’t backing down. Maybe he thought she was bluffing. “Guarantee?”
"I'll tell him tonight. I promise," said Steve, moving his hand gently over his stomach.
“Jarvis is this real?”
"You scared me, Tony."
“I want them to suffer.”
Winter’s shoulders slumped. The kind of defense she needed, he couldn't provide.
It was the first major indication they’d gotten of Piper’s location. The first proof of life. He pushed away her stinging words.
Natasha watched Steve from above. There was no clear shot. They were all over the place. He was fighting differently carrying his shield lower, protecting his stomach.
“And try to get some rest,” she said.
Steve blushed.“So I should take it as a major accomplishment?"
“Go, Steve, I’m not worth your time,” he said.
"Protective custody, exceptions can be made. Rules can be bent. Is there somewhere you like to go?" said Phil.
Steve had knowingly or unknowingly agreed to a date. The choice was Steve's. Steve’s phone laying by the pillow. There were only five numbers in the contacts. Tony was tempted to take a picture of the two and set it as the background. He added his number. Tony pushed his nose to Steve's neck, closing his eyes.
"I'm not."
“You’ve broken men like him before.” Steve’s voice was cold, unyielding.
“Just happy my boyfriend is home,” said Steve.
Steve was slightly startled at being so abruptly woken but relaxed back into his hold. But swiftly straightened when he caught the scent of another alpha. Tony rose from place next to him,  taking a protective stance in front of the bed. The overprotective alpha state could get old quick, but Steve was willing to accept now. He was tired and injured.
Steve rolled his eyes. "Jarvis, call Dr. Turner and see if he can make an appoint for today.”
"We can't hide our emotions from each other. You’re scared,” said Steve.
“Good morning.” Natasha turned to greet Lena. She'd been waiting for the perfect chance to interact with her.
"As I expected a full tear. I want you to keep the wearing brace. Visit me in six weeks to see if you'll need surgery or physical therapy. Do you have any questions before I go?” said Crane.
“But I wanna know what it's like to have a pet."
“I have your usual,” he said.
He always wanted a garden. The closest thing he ever came was a window box outside his tiny apartment. Though, the only plant to survive were some red geraniums, their presence brought some much-needed color into his life. Maybe he and Piper could rehab this garden. Having a task would be a good distraction for them. All the garden needed was some weeding and pruning.
Piper lay on the floor working on her latest drawing. Rune worked beside her. She and Rune had hardly any supervision during art class lately. Piper was worried for her friend the only time he seemed to relax was when he was with her. It was due to Sir’s appearance.
She split the deck and offered one half to him.
Killian sprinted toward dodging his every blast. They locked in combat each searching for an edge to put it to an end.
“I thought I’d introduce myself. I’m your neighbor, at least temporarily. I’m Kate,” she said.
“I’m not hiding,” said Steve.
“That’s him,” said Edith.
“That photo says a lot,” she said.
"It was long ago."
"No, we're not good. I need a little more information than that," said the sheriff.
“Steve?”
“How about we get out these tubes?”
“We’ll have none of that,” he said, wiping dry her tears.
"You've caught me. There has to be a vegetable you like."
Tony kissed Steve's stomach before getting out of bed. He threw on a pair of pajama pants and a band t-shirt.
“Suit yourself.” Bruce shrugged and turned back to his work.
“I killed those people with my bare hands. I punched my hand through a man’s chest. What else could I be?”
“She’s not helpless,” said Tony.
Steve nodded.
"My omega." His thrusts quicken. Steve tightens around him. His knot began to swell.
Steve got into Natasha’s car. They only slowed when they pulled up to Stark Tower.
"The mission was completed. There were no constraints placed on how I dealt with the target."
*****
“But your priority is our daughter,” said Tony. He respected and loved the care Steve had for their unborn child, and he was pleased to hear it.
“Pregnant."
"It's nothing," said Steve pulling them away.
“You shower and I’ll get that ordered.”
“If I agree to let this go, you must promise me something,” said Steve.
“Alright, I’m going to give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons tie yourself to those chairs and I’ll let you live. In five, four, bang! You should have already been gone,” said Tony.
“Piper,” called Papa.
“Regimes fall every day. I tend not to weep over that, I’m Russian, or I was,” she said.
He held her tightly as panels in the walls opened. A chemically sweet smell flooded the room. Winter’s vision blurred and the room spun. Winter gritted his teeth, fighting the gas effects, but his legs gave out and the pup fell from his arms. He struggled to all fours, snarling when footsteps came near. A club stuck the back of his neck, bringing him down. He lacked the strength to rise again.
“Then what the hell happened? I couldn’t breathe. My heart was tight,” said Tony.
"Piper, if we don't know what caused it, we won't know how to avoid it, so it won't happen again."
“When do you come back?” he asked.
“Stark?”
“No.”
“But they should be informed. This is their turf. They should be informed. We don't want to step on any toes,” said Steve.
“Dinosaur chicken nuggets.”
Tony moved to him. The touch of their skin was electric. They kept as little space between them as possible. Their lips crashed together but it was all too brief. Tony kissed down his stomach. Steve bit his lip as Tony suddenly took him in his mouth. He fought back a scream as Tony’s tongue circled the head of his arousal.
Knowing he was there calmed her down enough to concentrate. Her other senses further intensified to make up for her temporary lack of sight. The scent of leather infiltrated her senses. Its smooth surface was placed snuggly against her face.
“What were they doing that caught our attention? There wasn’t much in the report,” said Steve.
"Tell Tony, I’m taking the jet to DC,” said Pepper, as she put on her shoes.
Steve followed Fury to a car. He couldn’t help staring wide eye out the car’s window. An ugly skyscraper caught his attention. The Stark name was plastered on the front of it. He smirked. Howard was as egotistical as ever.
He swiveled around in his chair. Steve stood in the doorway, staring at the ground. He looked defeated.
The omega’s eyes closed. Medics attended Steve's wounds under Tony's watchful eye. When done Steve lay in bed. Monitors watched both Steve's and their pup's vitals. It was a risk taking Steve here but he couldn't take him anywhere else. Normal hospitals couldn't care for him. He would have to hack and remove whatever information S.H.I.E.L.D. gathered from this visit. Tony tensed when someone entered their room. He moved in front of the bed.
Yelping as Tony lay a trail of hot kisses down his neck. The alpha's sharp teeth dragged against his claim. Steve shivered his knees going weak. He clutched Tony's clothes for support. Those skilled hands crept lower, grasping his ass, rocking him forward to grind their hips together. Steve keened when his alpha held him tighter. With one clean motion, Tony lifted him, his legs wrapping around the alpha's waist. The bedroom door flung open. He was thrown onto the bed. The alpha undressed. Whimpering with want as his mate shed his clothes. The bed creaked as the alpha joined him. Tony's leg wedged between his. They kissed. Tony's hand moved under his shirt, pulling it off.
“I don’t know,” said Piper looking at her toes.
“Change,” she whined.
Steve joined her on the couch. He placed the infant pup in her arms. Piper had Steve’s gentle eyes, but she had her father's inquisitive gaze.
Tony settled back at his desk, setting his coffee down next to him. He'd lost count of had many cups he’d had today. His chest had been tight for hours, but he brushed it off as nothing. There had been a near constant ache in his chest since Piper was taken. It was as if a part of his heart were missing. Steve’s presence was the only balm that slightly soothed the ache.
“But what!”
“I am Iron Patriot.”
"For you, getting a new heart will be no trouble. You'll go straight to the top of the donor list. The mental pain, not only for Steve but for you too, will last for years. You don't want to bring that down on Piper when you find her," she said.
“Yes.”
“You bit me.” He caught her fist.
Steve gently pulled the alpha's hand, leading him to the elevator. It was enough to temporarily coax Tony out of pacing. God, all he wanted was to chase after the lead. He wanted to hold his baby. He needed that missing part of himself back.
“I’m sorry, Tony,” Steve said. Then he smiled. His alpha needed some encouragement, so Steve leaned closer to him and whispered in his ear. “When you’re done, I’ll wear one of those lacy numbers you bought me. And let you rip my clothes off to see which one I chose.”
When they reached their penthouse, Natasha was perched at the bar, an empty shot glass sitting in front of her. She spun the glass. Natasha always appeared when there was even the slightest hint of where Piper might be.
*****
“I don’t want S.H.I.E.L.D. to have that information either. Only the people that need to know,” he said.
“No, Steve. You took it out on the penthouse."
“What’s wrong, Theodore? Did you have a bad dream?”
Tony grunt as Steve reset his pinky and wrapped it with a brace. Steve grabbed a box of band-aids from the kit. He managed a small excuse of a smile when he looked down at the alpha's arms. They were now covered in SpongeBob, Minions, and Thomas the Tank engine band-aids. The sight even coerced a small smile from the alpha.
"Since you can't help with the physical labor start on the paperwork."
His alpha was laughing hysterically beside him.
Steve nodded. The omega brought him close to his chest, holding him there. Steve's soothing scent clouded his senses. Soft purrs filled the silence—the delicate sound lulling him to sleep. Tony tried fighting the battle against sleep.
“Antoine Triplett,” he said, offering him his hand.
“A knife.”
The holographic blue image of the scene appeared before him. He walked to the center of the room, information floating around him.
“I get it, Aunt Peg," he said. Tony already felt guilty enough. He planned on making up on to his mate somehow.
“Maybe.”
"Piper, I'm not going to force to stay in my presence when you clearly so detest it. Before cutting this short, I'll ask you to me one favor.”
Steve heard the tapping of computer keys.
“May the Lord in his kindness strengthen the consent you have declared before the Church and graciously bring to fulfillment his blessings within you. What God has joined, let no one put asunder. Let us bless the Lord.”
"I couldn't handle it," said Bruce.
“You break you bought it,” said Tony.
“In what world I am better for him than you?” asked Tony.
“Will it always be so intense?” he asked.
“A living Adonis with an ass sculpted by the gods,” he said.
Piper turned her head when the doctor didn't try to get them to come down. He just sat on the bench, doodling on his notepad. They were used to being confronted, but this guy was making no effort to even talk with them.
“How is he handling all this?” asked Rhodes.
“Mm, that’s one option."
“I’ve got nuc coming in,” said Tony.
“I don’t. I know the exact science behind it, but it has a habit of turning people into super-powered green rage monsters. We are lucky the bears didn’t fully accept it,” said Natasha.
“Ready to go home?” asked Natasha.
“Of course."
“No, only a break. How has she been?”
"Who told you?"
"Oh, and a lovely speed boat. And the thing was he needed someone to credit for some accidental explosions," said Trevor, making an exploding gesture with his hands.
“They’ll make us go through the decontamination,” said Natasha.
Pepper walked into the penthouse to the sight of Tony changing a diaper with his ironman helmet on. She laughed. Never did she think she would see Tony Stark changing a diaper. She swiftly wiped a tear away.
“Come on, handsome time for bed,” he said, leading Steve to bed.
“Stark?”
“Contact Dr. Turner, Jarvis.”
“Will it happen again?” he asked.
“It’s the best heat I've experienced,” said Steve.
“It’s likely. What did she do to you?”
“You do?”
Steve subtly sniffed his skin. He was sure he'd showered off the smell. "You have enhanced senses, too, don't you?"
S.H.I.E.L.D. ambulances pulled to the front, setting up a perimeter. Steve and Tony were loaded into one, Pepper and Maria in the other. They were driven to the nearest S.H.I.E.L.D. facility. They were rushed to the medical wing. Edith was waiting for them there.
“I never thought Howard would get married let alone have a family,” said Steve.
“And shoes?” Tony picked up several pairs of shoes. Piper pointed to a pair of red sequined shoes with little flowers along the band. He slipped them onto her tiny feet. She instantly grabbed at her sparkling toes, giving a happy squeal.
“Did you find something?!” asked Steve.
“Very good, stand down.” Piper instantly relaxed. “When she wakes up, all she'll remember is playing a game of chess with me."
“You don’t want her to know your scent like this.”
“Please be here when I return.”
MANDARIN ATTACK STARK PRESUMED DEAD
Tony leaned over the edge of the tub. Steve was quick to brace him. He groaned when Tony vomited on him. Steve cringed but rubbed his back.
“I would say so,” he said. Tony gazed over the perfect features of the omega before him.
“No, I like to get an early start. Can I get you something to eat?” asked Matt.
She wiped them away on her sleeve.
“Alpha."
“Bedroom next to the master.”
"It's okay."
Piper went back to setting up the pieces, not wanting to test the sharpness of Lena’s tone.
“Who is your boss?” asked Steve.
“Yes, to the detriment of the subject.”
“Get me out of here. Come on.”
Steve slumped back onto the couch. He really was in a pathetic state.
He wanted to tell someone who wasn’t a doctor, a friend. Steve looked around, making sure the range was clear.
Steve nodded. Tony wrapped a blanket around the omega’s shoulders. He settled next to his omega. Steve instantly coiled his large form wrapped around him, trying to get as much physical contact as possible. Tony purred, running his hand down Steve’s back. All he could do was wait.
“I still like him better,” said Piper.
Pepper was asleep next to her. "Give me a second." Maria quietly left her bedroom and went to her secure office. “Alright, we’re good to talk,” she said.
Steve went motionless. Tony scruffed his mate. “Sleep.”
When he looked back at them from the doorway, he couldn't find it in himself to leave. He settled in the reading chair, hoping the pups would not mind his presence.
"Who hurt you?" he asked. The mental restraints on his mind loosen to some extent when it concerned the pup.
"I hope."
“On?” asked Barny.
“Yes, it was an unfortunate name. I never had much of a sweet tooth. That was Loki. When we were pups he spent his allowance of sugar plums and candied apples,” said Thor.
“Drop it, Pepper!” he warned.
“Who?”
“Have you ever had someone pick your brain and play? Pull you out and stuff something else in. You know what it’s like to be unmade,” said Clint.
Tony followed Fury into another room. His inner alpha growled, hating being separated from such a compatible omega, ready and wanting. He pushed down the urge. Tony was unused to that side of himself. Fury tossed a large stack of a paper in front of him. It was at least five hundred pages.
Lena stayed silent but left the door open behind her when she exited their quarters. Piper went to the doorway, watching as the woman walked down the hall away from them, not even looking back.
"Yes, I finished my work. Tell Steve and Stark that the child is disease-free," said Edith.
“Good morning, Natasha,” he said.
The museum came into view. It had changed dramatically since he last saw it. He was excited. Steve sat up, trying to get a better look. He grabbed Tony’s hand, practically dragging him through the door. Tony paid for their tickets.
"We can convert one of the guest bedrooms into a studio," said Tony.
"It's fine. I think we've finished up here for today."
“Alpha please!”
“What do you have, Natasha?” he asked.
“Yeah, but Killian made that think tank on military contracts,” said Maya.
“I’m sure I can come up with something to make up for that.”
“I’ll get the two of you some fresh clothes,” said Pepper.
“Jarvis, does Tony know I’m home?”
“Have you ever been with someone before?” she asked.
A lot happened in three years. The Battle of Greenwich was another strike against the normal that followed the chaos of The Battle of New York. Steve’s and Tony’s hands were tied with Piper so being young. If they'd gone, they’d only been in the way. They knew so little of what caused it. Even after a full debriefing from S.H.I.E.L.D., there were unanswered questions.
Tony understood Steve’s reasoning. He was right in hiding it from him, but it didn’t make it any easier to accept. But was going to stop him. He got down one knee in front of Steve.
Fury left them taking the holographic reconstruction with him. Tony fell back in reeling from the work he’d examined. It was eerie how his daughter style replicated his own. Shit, at her age he couldn’t dream of making something like that.
“Working on her most recent toy,” said Steve.
“I’m fine, Jarvis. If you even try and tell Tony, I will tear this tower apart until I find a way to unplug you!”
The couple tensed.
“I, I don’t see how that’s a party,” said Natasha.
“I haven’t heard that before." The venom seeped angrily into his voice.
Steve slowly woke from a deep frigid sleep. His vision blurred for a moment.  He stared up at a yellowing ceiling. Where was he?! The last thing he remembered was falling. Then a sudden unforgiving cold. The image of Peggy flashed before his mind. How did he get here? He shook away the thought. He had to keep his wit about him.
They stormed toward each. Tony skidded underneath him, racing to one of his suits. The armor locked around him. He charged at him. They traded attacks. His armor was steadily being ripped away. He ejected from the suit as when Killian pounced on him. Another suit caught him wrapping around him. He caught Killian and soared upward.
"Totally fine, Sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch. Then at the end of the sentence, I say the wrong cranberry. But sir you were right. Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal," said Jarvis.
“Not yet,” said Steve.
Steve jotted the ingredients of his mother’s stew. She made memorize the recipe. Passed down his grandmother to his mother to him. Promising he'd only serve it to his mate. But he was only bending the rules slightly. Tony was a potential mate. Jarvis scanned over this list. Steve didn’t know what to do with himself now.
"I see the way he looks at you," she said.
“Please let me in,” said Tony.
"Wasn't sleeping well anyway," said Tony. Steve smiled through his discomfort. "Need anything?"
“Have places to be, Rhodey,” he said.
“Did anyone see you arrive?” asked Happy.
George Wong tried not stared as he entered the giant mansion. The Starks weren't the average income level he usually treated. Their daughter's circumstances were far from ordinary. Piper wasn't his only patient here. There was also Rune. Captain America answered the door.
“What I saw went beyond my expertise. A specialist will have to be brought in to examine it. I'd suggest Dr. Helen Cho. She’s a world-renowned geneticist, the best in her field.”
"You're late."
“I still want to see.”
Steve sighed.
Bruce toyed with his hands, not enjoying the heavy atmosphere that had fallen between them.
"I have a daughter. She's an omega. I know the signs," said Barny.
Winter carefully lifted the pup, and she huddled into his neck. He placed her down on the mattress. Should he wake her? No, leaving while she was awake would only make things difficult. If she asked him to stay, he’d likely defy his orders, which would only put her in further danger.
"Don't Rhodey, I don't need to hear it."
"She asked me to teach her about biology when I caught her not paying attention, she freaked. As if she thought I was going to hurt her."
"They'll be all over us when they know about us," said Steve.
“Late July,” said Steve.
"No."
Winter scowled.
"It's not my best," he said, crumbling the blueprints. He tossed them into the sink. They couldn't be thrown away; they'd have to be destroyed. Even his duds could be dangerous if they fell into the wrong hands.
“I’m so happy."
“So why are you here?” she asked.
“We aren't doing anything too exciting. We'll at some amazing restaurants and layout on the beach," said Tony.
“You have time," said Steve.
“I smelled something.”
"Especially for me. I'm not the easiest person to get along with. Papa and Rhodey have the patience of a saint."
Steve liberated several concentration camps. He cried at each rescue. Nothing could prepare a person for such horrific scenes. He distinctly remembered an alpha saying:
"Answer it could be important," he said. Steve kissed Tony on the cheek before pulling away and settling on the couch.
He huddled closer to Tony. His earthy clove scent filled his nose. The alpha’s deep rumbling purr echoed in his ears. Tony’s fingers ran through his hair, working out tangles. His soft purr joined the alpha's.  He wasn’t sure how long they stayed like that.
Steve smiled. He looked over the bites marks coloring Tony's shoulders. They'd faded enough for him not to worry about. "Sorry about those."
, me. Not with this.”
“She seems to be flourishing under his attention. Do you see any downsides to Becker's teaching method?"
“You’re finally showing your potential.”
“Better?” asked Tony.
“I’m buried here," said Steve.
"Thank you, Nat."
“It does,” said Tony.
“No, but I can do something,” said Tony. He pulled up a transparent screen. Moments later holographic orbs of white lights appeared around the tree. Steve smiled.
December 15, 2011
“Ready to go in?”
Steve should have been impressed. He made the fearsome Black Widow giggle.
“I won’t be long."
“Tony.”
Steve’s mind went to the doctor, who taken such advantage of him when he was so defenseless. “I wouldn’t."
“You called me.”
“I can keep going,” she murmured, resting her head on his shoulder.
“You’ll have to meet with Edith," she said.
“I had a little problem with umm substances and I ended up umm doing things. Doing things in the street that a man shouldn’t do.”
Tony slow woke as the aroma of coffee filled the air.
“Only remembering when Howard and Maria first brought you here. He was tired but so proud. The man hardly let you out of his arms the entire visit.”
“It’s noon," said Steve.
"I don't know, yet. But I fully intend on finding out. She's due to return home in a month. I'll pay her a visit."
“It is,” he said.
“Give him some space,” warned Natasha.
He slowly woke. “Tony?”
"Why are you smirking?"
“Piper, when a person experiences something traumatic it stays with them forever, haunting them. Sometimes it gets so bad a person relives those moments forgetting where they are."
“Of course he is.”
Steve tucked his phone into his pocket. He went to find Piper. Passing through the kitchen, where Rune, Pepper, and Maria were baking. Rune loved cooking and baking. Piper could care less but would sometimes help out. He found Piper in the library with Bruce.
"That was amazing," said Tony. Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair.
“You’re not going in alone,” said Steve.
“They’re asleep,” said Maria.
“Steve Rogers, nice to meet you, James,” he said, shaking the alpha’s hand.
“Popcorn?” he asked.
Steve turned red. Had Tony seen him in the bathroom or him changing? Tony wouldn’t do that, would he? Steve took a seat on the couch. He shook the thought from his mind. Pepper sat across from him.
"Skin to skin contact helps a pup bond with their parents."
She pulled her chair closer to the one-way mirror.
“It's a temporary heart condition often brought on by stressful situations, such as the death or loss of loved ones. Alphas and omegas are often most affected. It causes a brief disruption in the normal pumping function of one area of the heart," said Jarvis.
"Let me shower then I'll feed her."
Steve turned red but started laughing.
*****
“How-
“Do you want to do that when you’re so close to being due?”
“You don’t hate me?” she sniffled.
“What do I owe this unwanted visit to?” asked Tony.
“Remind me to make a donation to MoMA,” said Tony.
“Talk to me, Happy,” said Tony.
“Fuck!” growled Kevin before pulling out his phone.
“They aren’t going to like this,” he said.
"The nurse was an omega."
“Regret is when you feel sad or disappointment at something you did or something you missed out on,” said Piper.
“None yet.” Honestly, he’d forgotten about. They just had a moment to clear their heads and relax after on the drama.
“How?”
At twelve hundred hours lunch came, and again the pup sheltered behind him. He stared at the tray it was double the amount they normally gave. What was on the tray looked more like food than anything he’d seen in years. It wasn’t that high protein, nutrient-rich, flavorless crap he was used to eating. They each took their share. She hadn’t eaten her share of broccoli.
“Your hair.”
"Tony?" Steve relaxed when Tony entered the room. The alpha got into bed with him, resting his head on Steve's stomach. The alpha purred, causing him to as well. Steve put down the baby book, marking the page. He ran his fingers through Tony's hair.
"You haven't been interested in this before," said Hill.
“Stark is a brilliant man there’s no denying that, but he’s unstable. I would hate to see you hurt by him,” said Barny.
“What?”
"Drug him!"
Winter washed off the blood the best he could in a public bathroom and changed into his civilian clothes. His hands were shaking. He clutched the counter taking a breath. What were these emotions weighing on his chest? It was heavy, unbearable. Pain, he could adjust to. This was new. He hoped, in time, he’d adjust to this, as well.
The kid would be safer now that he was gone. So was his mate.
It smelled dusty but other than it was fine.
Piper nodded, making space for Papa in the bed. He took up most of the space. His voice was soothing as he read. She leaned into the warmth of his skin and slowly drifted off.
“STOP!!”
One of the nurses got up to join them.
“That makes no sense,” said Rune.
“Come on, Piper, we have an appointment,” said Lena.
"I found him passed out on the floor. He'd thrown up on himself", said Steve.
Lena was forced from her sleep when an alert went off on her phone. The alarm system at the base had been activated. This couldn’t be good. It was surprising something like this hadn’t happened sooner.
“He’s like a really smart person,” said Phil.
In omegaverse, it normally only affects mated omega alpha pairs. Once the episode ends it leaves bruises over the scent glands in the neck and over the heart.
Ten armored alphas came flooded the small room. Piper whimpered.
Meanwhile, in Malibu, Tony was working his lab. He’d managed to block out most of Pepper’s lecture. She was a skilled CEO and worker, but he hated listening to business. He much rather working his lab.
“Why?”
“I’ll be careful.”
"All right, Piper, I'm done. Do you want a lollipop?"
“That’s no excuse for not calling, Anthony.”
“It seems so, judging by his heart rate," said Jarvis.
Crane left him. One of the reasons Tony enjoyed having Crane for a doctor was how straight to point and efficient he was. He eased his shirt back on. Again he checked on Steve. The footage pulled up on his phone. Steve was asleep in his nest perfectly relaxed. Every part of him wanted to race home, but he had to go to the grocery store. Steve would be pissed if left him with empty fridge much longer. He hated going to the store, preferring to have it delivered.
Steve didn’t know what was happening. “TONY!”
“Jarvis block this program."
Piper gave placed her soft tiny hands into his large, strong ones, trusting. She watched as he wrapped them in the white athletic tape. Piper had seen Papa do this many times before. Winter did it the same exact way.
“It’s okay,” she said. Piper patted his chest. He relaxed.
Something was up with his friend. He was following a contract to the letter. Making this omega breakfast. It had to be someone special. He was relieved that Tony was moving on.
“I know I will!” snarled Steve.
Her shouts went ignored. She growled, throwing the pack of cards at his head. He snarled at her but she was too angry to care.
“How did you get access to my medical records?!”
He held Steve closer. Protective instinct flaring.
He went into the kitchen. There was a bowl of fruit on the counter. He glared at the apple.
“Really good.”
“You can’t say that, Matt. That was Jeri Hogarth. A partner in one of the biggest law firms in New York,” he said.
Steve arrived back at the New York S.H.I.E.L.D. facility at eleven that night. It would be close to one in the morning when he got home. He swung onto his bike, starting up the engine and speeding home, not caring if it earned him several tickets. Steve pulled into the garage. He toed off his shoes before entering the penthouse.
“What do I do?” asked Steve.
“Tony.”
The panic was clear in the sleeping omega's expression. Distress leaked off him as Steve reared up, still asleep, momentarily instinctively sensing Tony pressing against him. He plastered his face to Tony’s neck, clutching his closely, his expression only relaxing slightly.
Rune looked uncomfortable somehow. “What’s wrong?” Piper asked
“Why is he the one that gets to storm off?”
"Those must be the pregnancy books, Sir ordered."
He caught the alpha in a kiss, clinging closely to him.
“My doctor.”
"Back to the doctor." He wanted to talk about something he could actually manage.
“Steve.”
“Yes.”
There was a special on the pyramids. Tony worked while Steve watched. He worked better when he was sitting with Steve running his fingers through the omega's hair. Only looking away from it when Steve started snoring.
“I’m sorry. I’ll be three days late.”
“It’s clear you find him attractive,” said Natasha.
"If I said no, what would happen?" asked Piper.
“Fine,” they said.
Tony fell back into the cushioned chair. The plane took off.
“Well, maybe it’s not about guns,” she said.
"Physically, I believe it would make an alpha even unbonded more susceptible to Broken Heart Syndrome if they were involved with you." Steve caught his breath. She put together the pieces. "Oh, Steve I'm sorry. Is Tony alright?"
“Maybe she knows how uncomfortable it would make you.”
“Steve, I wish I had the answers you wanted. Staying up all night staring at file will do nothing.”
"Will you actually eat it?" asked Tony.
“Who?”
"I love you."
Steve never knew his father. He was only a pup when the man died. His pup would know its father. He so wanted that for his baby - a family. Not only for the child, but also for himself.
, there was no potential about this. He returned to his position over the toilet.
“Will you tell me anything on this mystery man?” asked Rhodes.
“Fuck, Steve are you alright?”
“Ms. Potts is calling,” said Jarvis.
"That's fine. It's completely up to you, Steve," said Turner.
“Why has he been keeping you such a secret?” asked Matt.
“Is that normal?” asked the beta, staring at the large stuffed rabbit.
“You should teach your omega some manners, Stark,” said Rumlow.
“You’re always working a project,” said Steve.
“I’ve answered all your questions, Piper.”
“Pretty much. This is unrelated but when is Steve maternity leave over?” she asked.
“Look at this,” said Tony.
They reached a large gym. At the center of the room was a large, padded, blue sparring mat. Punching bags were piled in a corner. Guns and knives were displayed behind a cage on the wall. She stepped toward it. Piper had never seen gun up close. She'd only ever caught a glimpse of one. Papa kept his gun in a special lockbox in his room. The only reason she even seen it at all was that Papa had been cleaning it when he'd thought she was asleep. He'd scrambled to put it away when he noticed her peeking. Piper jumped when a hand touched her shoulder.
He regretted not being there for his mother. The car came to a stop.
"True, but it won't change that," said Natasha.
Piper didn’t like life sciences, where anomalies could occur more frequently. Those mechanics didn't follow the same simple mathematical logic she preferred. What she hated most, though, was not being able to understand. Uncle Bruce’s notes did nothing to aid her. It didn’t help that they were in cursive. She huffed, throwing the report across the room, forgetting the sleeping man on the couch behind her.
“Deploy,” he gasped.
Steve laughed. The man flies around in high tech suit of armor. And he was trying to find a way to reinvent a peeler.
"Not a clue," said Rhodes.
"Where?" asked Bruce.
“I don’t see how I can,” said Steve.
Steve didn’t know what to do. He kept his gaze down, toying with mug Tony left behind.
“Thank you,” said Steve.
“I guess you’re not eating.” The woman left with breakfast.
“Yeah.’
"He was caught in an explosion at the Chinese Theater," said Jarvis.
Steve taking a breath, reminding himself that she was safe here. He trusted Jarvis's word, but he still needed the reassurance of seeing her. He went to Rune's room, pushing open the door slightly. The two were sleeping peacefully. He walked in, pulling the blanket further over them.
“You can’t blame yourself. Piper will open up in her own time just like you did.”
Steve handed him the shield. It weighed twelve pounds. The metal itself was unscathed. Tony itched examine it further. Melt it down and remake it, but Steve would never allow him. It would be simple enough to build an electromagnetic glove. The project would take an hour at most. Applying a new coat of paint would be a short process, but it would take twenty-four hours to dry. He could add a few harmless functions that Steve wouldn’t mind.
“Can you lower your gown?” asked Blackwell.
He glanced at Hill's screen. On it was an image of Piper Stark. He hadn’t been heavily involved in the investigation around the Stark girl’s disappearance. Hill gave him the relevant details if she believed them of significance. He ran a worldwide agency that charged with dealing with disaster unfit for the average human mind. They went to a secure office.
“Steve.” It was straining Tony’s throat to keep his voice level. “Steve, please wake up.”
“Rune.”
“What happened?”
Tony grunted as he cleaned the wounds. Steve tried not to rush the process. But if he didn’t get this cared for before the next wave, it wouldn’t be treated until his heat was over. Most likely, he wouldn’t come out of his feral state again. He wound the bandages carefully around Tony’s arm. The entire time the alpha’s gaze was focused on him.
“I’m aware.”
Steve studied the alpha, noticing the claim mark on his neck. It was common for omegas to mark their alphas.
"Hey, beautiful."
“And the boy?” asked Bruce.
“Piper, you’ll be coming with me.”
“That’s not the point,” said Steve.
Rune woke before Piper, who was asleep against his shoulder.
Tony turned away from that blue-eyed gaze. He couldn’t take someone truly seeing him. Maybe there was something that he could have done? Maybe if he weren’t so concerned about his own issues he could have been more useful.
“When is our next mission?” asked Steve.
"That's not the point. He hasn't had such an incident in decades," said Pierce.
Steve raised his head, sinking his teeth into alpha's exposed neck.  The newly formed bond strengthened further. They were content. Nothing else mattered at the moment, but them. Tony turned them on their side. As they waited for his knot to go down he tended the newly formed claim mark. Tony watched as his mate fell asleep. When his knot went down he gently slid from his omega. Steve whined, but swiftly settle down again. Tony moved his mate so he was better hidden. He pressed himself closer to Steve. Tony placed his hand protectively over Steve’s stomach.
"It was something like that," said Steve.
She wore a white onesie with a yellow dinosaur on. The text underneath it read boobivore.
“Last time something interesting happened I was crushed by a giant bear,” he said.
Her captors couldn’t fake this.
Was that really all? Was it so easy to unsettle the child? Did he want to know if more happened? There were no marks or bruising on the pup. But some methods didn't leave behind bruises.
“You know what would happen when I told people I was Ironman’s bodyguard. They would laugh in my face.”
“Do you mind if I sleep?” he asked.
The woman tensed. “Isabella, you must be here to call in that favor. I don’t know why else you’d show your face here,” she said. “Let’s talk somewhere more private. Your alpha can’t come.”
“How many?”
*****
“We have to.”
Winter chuckled softly. Lena simply rolled her eyes. He had no fear of losing the pup’s affection.
*****
Tony's composure was aggravating! It made Steve feel like the unreasonable one. Couldn't Tony see how much of a threat he was? Steve stood up, needing some distance.
"All it took was a picture," said Steve.
He’d never been with Tony. Steve marched to the garage.
Steve put his shirt on, ignoring the tension between the two. He couldn't make them like each other. Steve couldn't be too upset about his mate feeling a bit overprotective after seeing their baby for the first time.
His voice was groggy and distant. Tony took off his helmet. Steve pressed against him.
“I want to go. I want to see our baby.”
He slid an iPad toward her. It had a split screen of Winter. She was forced to watch as her friends were punished for her actions. He left her with that image.
He quickly covered it with his hand. Steve covered his head with a pillow, trying to block out the conversation, a blush burning his cheeks.
They charged at each other, their sending sparks into the air as they collided.
The time in the ice hadn't changed him. Steve's relaxed posture changed.
“You’re fooling yourself if you believe that’s acceptance.”
“Depends on the day,” said Steve.
“Looks, like I’ll be paying wonder boy a visit,” said Fury.
Pierce followed her to an unoccupied office.
"The enemy I fought seven decades ago I still fight today. They set things in motion. But we are the ones that created this life. I will not let them take credit for our daughter."
"A monster. Is that what you think I am?" She didn't answer. "Girl!"
“No.”
He sighed.“It’s fine.”
“How do I open it?” asked Piper.
“I want to know why Loki let us take him. He not leading an army from here,” said Steve.
“Good, you’re awake. I wouldn’t want you to miss this,”
Steve nodded. The doors creaked loudly as he forced them open. Drones were sent in before them. They waited outside for the results.
“When he flew into the portal with the nuc, I could only give him so much time before I had to make the command. If I had given would second earlier, his blood would be on my hands.”
That was simple. Now, what? He took out his sketchbook began drawling. When he finished a little more than an hour past. He showered and went into the closet. Steve pulled open a drawer. He turned red he saw several sets of lingerie tucked in the corner. Tony must have done this when he was sleeping.
That was enough for him. His mate needing them to do this was enough reason for him to endure it.
"Thought you'd be awake. And you're one of the few people I can tolerate talking to at this hour."
“Steven got a major promotion in the navy. He travels so much I rarely get to see him, but he phones at least once a week. More than you do,” said Peggy.
Not much described the room perfectly. There was a small kitchen nook with cheap tile flooring, which led to a small living area. The living area was converted into a studio. It smelled of oil paints. There were twenty paintings of varying sizes. Half of them contained a train. Tony took a close look at the paintings. The strokes of the brush could be seen in the work, heavy and aggressive, but some were saddened and calm in their motion. The paint was heavily layered. Most of the works were painted in cool tones, but three of them were in warm colors. Some were obvious in their meanings, others were abstract in their true meanings. One of the more obvious featured a red skull melting away into a black background. Steve was showing him something intimate.
“Yes.”
“Yet, I’ve not tired of the image. An impressive feat,” said Tony.
“My ninety-four-year-old technology inept husband can do this."
Steve groaned. He didn't want to think of that.
Her curiosity got the best of her. She peeked out from the blanket. He went from stalking angrily around the cell to clutching his head in a tight ball making inhuman sounds. It went like this for two hours until he fell to the center of the floor holding his head. His breathing heavy and body soaked in sweat. She knew the deep mixture of fear and confusion in his expression. Once before she’d seen it with Papa before Daddy hurried her off to her room.
“See you, sparkles.”
“Winter!”
“A warm light for all mankind. Loki’s jab at Fury about the cube,” said Banner.
Tony ducked back behind the headboard.
“Your eyes glowed blue. There was a blue light under your skin. Waves of the stuff came off you. And you’re super strong, almost as strong as me.”
Thor followed him the movie theater Tony built. They settled in the cushy chairs.
Steve found the basement. He braced against a wall. Blood dripped from his wound. He collapsed.
"I should have come," she said.
“Barb, after Barbara Stanwyck,” said Steve. He put on his helmet.
“Make sure you come back to visit,” she said.
“Look all you want, doll face."
Tony laughed.
Steve’s arms were wrapped tightly around him, his arousal pressed against Tony's rear. Tony struggled to get out of Steve’s powerful grip. He showered and dressed. Tony took Steve’s present from the drawer, placing on the bedside table. He glanced back at the sleeping his sleeping omega. Steve would kill him if didn’t say goodbye. He took a seat on the edge of their bed, out of reach Steve’s arms.
The day went smoothly. They spent the day watching Christmas movies. Steve’s favorite being Rudolph. He was enjoying the slow pace of the day. Tony was uninterested in the movies but seemed more than content holding him. He got up.
He barely had to get the boy securely under his watch. If all went well, he'd have two super-powered children within his realm of control.
“Things should have been done differently. I wish it didn’t have to be done at all.”
“Fine, he can keep it,” he said.
Tony rested his head against Steve’s chest, listening to his heartbeat.
“I remember."
"Mom had a habit of locking Howard out when he got on her nerves. So he kept a key here. And she let him think she didn't know. He never bothered updating the system," said Tony.
“Any ideas on what you want. You have an unlimited budget,” said Tony.
“This isn’t about me.” said Papa.
“What kind of incident?”
“Not until you answer some questions.”
"After our honeymoon if it's nothing urgent," said Steve.
Trinkets were gifts given to omegas from alphas as a show of gratitude for being allowed to join them in heat. It was the first given to him. He played with it. Steve hadn't thought he get one. They had no previous relationship.
“What are you looking for?” asked Tony.
Lena reset Winter's arm, setting it in a brace. Then, they transferred the two super-soldiers to a recovery room. Piper's old collar had broken during the struggle, and Lena smiled softly as she locked a new one in place.
“You knew.”
“We need back up," said Tony.
birdeens
"I want to remove the shrapnel from my chest."
He broke out of his suite and rushed toward the stairs. A soldier sped toward, he jumped from the deck to another. A suit flew passed taking care of his pursuer. He glanced back. Steve and Pepper were hanging off a ledge above him.
"Then you're going to have to tell me," said Edith ignoring his tone. She couldn't answer the question stressing him if he refused to tell her. Steve took a shaky breath.
“I won’t,” said Steve. It was Tony’s version of be careful.
“Why shouldn’t the guy let off a little steam?” said Tony.
“Would you like a drink?” he asked.
“We could name her Sarah,” said Tony.
"I don't want to talk about this," he said.
"Then there's no way I'd go unnoticed."
“Yes, sir.”
“You’re tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut,” said Tony.
“You told me to put you down.”
"I see don't see why not."
Steve sent a warning glare in Tony's direction.
“And who is this?” asked Thor.
“I still think Ali is better,” said Tony.
“Order pizza I don't feel like cooking," said Tony.
They went to the penthouse. There were no signs that Steve had been out of the studio.
"It was good. I'm not in any rush to go to the beach again," he said.
“Get in,” she ordered.
“We’re here,” she said. She handed him a pack and a set of clothes.
Lena returned the observing room. She activated the rabbit. Piper's stats appeared on the monitor. The stuffed animal watched not her vitals, but rather picked up on her hormonal shifts. Secretary Pierce’s image appeared on the monitor.
“Heh, so you heard about that,” said Steve.
“The doctor refused to return under any circumstances.”
“What happened that was so bad in his past?” asked Rune.
"How?"
“My boss.”
“How many are you going to make?”
“I’ve got you.”
The alpha's thrust grew deeper. All he could do was moan as the alpha worked him. His nails digging into Tony's back as the alpha's knot tugged at his sensitive rim.  Steve screamed reaching release as the alpha's teeth sunk into his neck.
“He’s in the shower,” said Jarvis.
“It’s an enhanced energy suit.”
“Maybe,” he said. Despite the odds against her, he believed her capable of doing just that. He hoped he would be there to see it.
“But you can come with me,” suggested Tony.
The pup happily squealed at the new attention. Steve and Tony stared dumbfounded. Neither of them thought Nat had a maternal side. Tony wandered his workshop, sensing he wouldn’t be needed for a few hours.
“It stings.”
The doors opened. Steve was huddled in the corner. He slowly approached him.
Steve took a breath, forcing back his possibly unreasonable hope of being reunited with his daughter.
“Jarvis, what’s happening?”
“Do it.”
"I knew how to play rummy and spit before, and he already knew how to play those, so I didn't have to explain it to him. He taught me Durak.”
“What the fuck is he doing in Hell’s Kitchen?!”
“Did you any issues producing slick?” she asked.
He raised his head. His gaze darted from Piper. He shifted uncomfortably on his feet.
“Me too,” he said.
Tony watched from the doorway. The omega usually enjoyed the detailed process of making a nest. Slowly, Steve began piecing things together. As they worked on the nest, Steve gave into his feral side more, making it easier for both of them. Once it was done they fell back into holding each other. Tony hated the idea of disrupting this peace but they had to discuss this.
“Bulky,” said Steve.
“Did you get it?” asked Tony.
Steve understood that need.
Tony didn’t want to tell Steve about the flash drive yet, not until he was sure he had something. He didn’t want to get either of their hopes up only to be let down again. If there were nothing only he’d be let down.
“I appreciate the option of making my own choice about my body, but I don’t need or want an abortion this time,” he said.
“Sure,” said Steve.
The iPad shattered in Steve's grip. He’d given that woman a chance. He'd fucking cared what happened to her family.
"Jarvis, tell Bruce its dinner," said Steve.
Tony laid Piper on her back. He took a deep breath before undoing the tabs. Steve laughed when he made a gagging sound. He wasn't going throw up! He powered through it and quickly disposed of it.
Piper buried her face further into his neck, inhaling his minty, pine scent. With each breath, her breathing calmed. She pulled away slowly but didn't meet Lena's gaze.
Rune blushed. Her voice had a level of sincerity he was unused to.
She sat up. “How do you know?”
"Hello, Steve, it's been a while. It's good to hear from you. Do you need to set up an appointment?" Turner had fully expected Mr. Stark to be the first make contact with after Steve suffered some sort of episode.
“He’s your brother. You and Loki have lifetimes that will span millennia. This is a small blip in time for you. You can’t expect us to be so forgiving though,” said Steve.
"Sure."
*****
Natasha smiled softly. "I can name at least ten reasons why you deserve her. You're too hard on yourself. Be selfish. Enjoy this part of your life."
“Thank you, Pepper."
"I didn't need his permission. If I hadn't helped, who knows what world I would have brought my pup into," said Steve.
“Perfect condition. Captain Rogers, did a better job of cleaning than you,” said Jarvis.
“Jarvis, how did Steve even get into the penthouse?”
Tony’s hand was between his legs, rubbing him with the perfect pressure causing him to moan. The phone dropped from between his shoulder.
“Who the hell are you?”
“Why would I look at you any other way?”
“Can you place an order Bagel Factory?” asked Steve.
"Very funny, let's go," he said, shoving Rhodes out the door.
He snarled. Its lowness caught her off guard. She stepped back, bowing her head in submission. The man took a deep breath.
“You missed the back of your head but I’ve got it,” Steve ran the brush gently through her hair working out the knots. “Go get dressed.”
“It’s the principle,” said Steve, getting to his feet.
Even the most minuscule task that could prove helpful in finding Piper would ease the weight of his guilt. But Steve and Tony were left feeling –being- utterly useless. There was nothing for them to chase.
Piper’s stomach rumbled.
“He’s also genius, billionaire, and Ironman,” said Edith.
“You weren’t ready to hear it. Honestly, I didn’t think you would be until you were a few years older,” said Daddy.
“The less you know of my assignments, the safer you are.”
"Were there other prisoners?" she asked.
No answer. She raised her head, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. Winter was gone. He had been here just this morning. She instantly woke up, shooting from the bed. Her cell was truly empty. She went for the only item of comfort, Stanley the flattened rabbit, hugging it closely to her chest. Piper bit her lip barely fending off the tears.
“Can I join you?” asked Tony.
“Four days,” he said.
“Thank you, Rune.”
“Yes, but there'd hardly be any Asgardian blood left in the line by this point," said Thor.
“Fuck off!”
Genius recognized genius even in grief. His mind was trying to put together how the man created such an amazing piece of technology given the limited resources of the time.
Tony froze. He clenched the changing table. “Will he be okay?”
. Something from his past had to get in the way. If he didn’t help get the Tesseract from this Loki, there may not be a world to bring his pup into. He had no choice but to accept the mission.
"You think so?"
“What did I do? Did I hurt someone?”
He nuzzled against Steve, nosing against his throat. Tony thoroughly scented the omega, checking for anything concerning. Nothing was wrong but he was slow to pull away afraid something may suddenly change. Steve grabbed his arm when he tried leaving the bed. He whined. Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair.
“Come here.” Steve slowly inched closer. Tony caught him, hugging his mate tightly. The tension melted from him. “I’ve got you. I always will.”
As Loki rose, meeting the gazes of the six who'd defeated him.
“You’re fertile, so I see no reason why not,” she said with a bright smile.
“Move!” growled Tony.
Steve woke up a few minutes later. Groaning when he found he’d slicked himself in his sleep. Thankfully Nat wasn't there to see this. It wasn't even having that kind of dream. In his dream, he was sitting on the couch with Tony, the fingers carding through his hair. It was something so simple, but so meaningful. He doubted it meant anything to alpha. The simplicity of the moment was perfect. Steve showered and dressed before leaving for the café. Natasha was eating at a table with Clint. Steve grabbed several bagels and joined his friends.
Tony moved onto the couch with him, taking him into his arms. Steve pushed into the comfort of his embrace.
“Could say the same thing about you,” she said.
“You are too young hear such things in detail. I witnessed cruelty and depravity on a level I thought impossible and experienced deep loss. And sometimes my mind brings me back to moment."
Tony called room service, placing the order. He joined Steve in bed. His curled up against his chest. He purred when Steve gently ran his fingers over the arc reactor. There was a knock on the door.
*****
“It’s fine, your inner omega is a bit wild. It happens. In time, it will adjust to having contact with other alphas,” said Kate.
Winter stood up, not acknowledging what happened, and Piper didn’t push. He didn't know how much it meant to her to have that momentary feeling of safety.
“Tony, I’ve got to go to New York."
“You slicked yourself completely. I had to change them,” said Tony. He shivered, remembering the blissful intensity of the omega's slickened scent.
“Should we could call in the Romanian team?” asked Natasha.
“I see no reason to waste my time with touchy-feely bullshit. Let’s just see if compatible,” said Tony.
“Hey, Phil I was wondering if you could find me a motorcycle for personal use. I wasn’t sure who else to call about this,” he said.
“How is that possible?” asked Steve.
“Such a worrier. I have the upper ground you’d be amazed at what I can do with such a simple advantage,” said Clint.
Lena Zemo turned to face the alpha, irritated. She tucked a strand of her brown behind her ear. A brute like Rumlow wouldn’t understand her work; he was completely blind to the behavioral intricacies occurring.
“Daddy, would you do my hair, please?”
I will be publishing a bonus chapter on Monday.
Steve went into the bathroom. He leaned over the mirror. Steve raised his upper lip. He thought of marking Tony with his claim. Steve flinched with his canines extended into mating teeth. They’d never had a reason to show before now. He took a breath and they retracted to their original length. He rubbed his jaw trying to relieve some of the soreness. Steve went into the kitchen to help Tony. He ended up taking over the task when the news distracted Tony. He seemed particularly interested in the business news focusing on the Osborne Company.
He brought the gun closer. The beta back further into the seat. This either some elaborate lie or this was real. That this was just some washout failing actor that somehow got absorbed into this scheme.
“Please stop crying.”
“Not hungry.”
Steve woke up at four in the morning on May 2nd, having fallen asleep in his studio again. Since his recent discovery, he hadn’t slept well. Pushing his alpha away became his defensive mechanism in this moment of uncertainty.
His attention focused on one of the photos. Six men struggled together to raise the American flag. It summed up so much of the struggle.
“Where do you want to have it here or in California?” asked Pepper.
“Tony, I’m fine,” he insisted.
“Tony, wake up. Tony!” Locked around his neck was a frigid metal hand.
“Having Captain America drooling over me is something I can get used to,” said Tony.
“You should hydrate,” said Jarvis.
Tony moved Steve's hands, bringing him into an embrace.
Edith was shocked it was positive. With the level of birth control, Steve was on it shouldn't be possible. The test was a reliable brand. The chance of it being a false positive was one in a million.
“Better change.” said Gloria. “Having the smell of his distress on you will make leaving all the more difficult.”
Maya ignored him. "See we all begin wide-eyed pure science. Than ego steps in, the obsession and you look up you're a long way from shore."
“Or you’ll be suiting up like the rest of us,” said Tony.
“I’m so sorry, Tony."
“There aren’t many people who can sneak up me,” he said.
“We could never hate you,” said Papa.
"It's okay," she said, gently pulling his hand. He slowly got up and followed her, grabbing a box of his own.
"You're not alone in this," said Steve. He squeezed the alpha’s hand. Tony smiled.
“Why?”
"And your appearance. No one will ever suspect you of anything."
They went into the kitchen. Tony noticed a shoebox on the counter. It was slightly beaten up on the corners and rattled slightly when he lifted it. Steve wouldn’t have brought it if weren’t important.
Steve tucked his phone into his pocket. Today was relatively calm. The pups played most of the day. He’d put a plastic sheet over Piper’s mattress while she was outside. Piper was ashamed. He tried reassuring her it was okay accidents happen. But she didn't get any comfort from it. She'd likely be up in a couple of hours due to an excess of energy. Despite her curiosity, she’d shown no interest in wanting to leave and see more of the outside world. Before, she’d always wanted to explore and hated being confined to the house. Boredom would cause her to act out if she couldn't find an outlet. She could only do some much within the mansion. It would take months, but she’d crave escape. He got into bed with Tony.
Piper stiffened, alert. "Someone is coming."
"I know. I've been using it as a crutch. I'm sorry."
“I’m dreading it," said Steve. Those late-night calls and the spark he felt at their touch, he didn't want to lose that. Sometimes those calls were the only highlights of his day.
“Not my kind of award,” said Tony with a shrug. Steve smiled. Tony brought him a beer. He took a sip before setting it down.
“Why do you call your dad by his first name?” asked Piper.
Those metal hands were amazing against his heated skin. He purred as those deft fingers worked into his tired aching muscles. Steve moaned. Slick dampened his undergarments.
Tony pulled back the blanket. Steve whined, yanking the blanket back over his head. Tony tugged it back down again, earning a near-death level glare. Before Steve had the chance to scold him, he stuffed a sandwich in his mouth.
“La.”
Steve went through multiple handguns at the range, but none felt right. He was tempted to ask for a version of his old weapon, but he didn’t want to be a hassle.
“Do you think you conceived here or at S.H.I.E.L.D?” asked Tony.
“Doesn’t feel like it.”
"Nat found me on the floor my bathroom. I had a panic attack. She got me through it. Then I had to Edith. Then Fury-
Steve’s breathing was short.
"Steve your birth control."
“Yes, I could take you,” said Tony.
He didn’t know the proper etiquette for meeting royalty. The only other person of royal descent of he'd met was Thor.
“I should not have taken Piper with me.” Steve repeated more firmly. “Then she’d be here.”
Steve jumped when the front door flew open. Tony emerged from his suit and embraced him.
Steve smiled when the Iron Patriot.
“An alpha. He had long brown hair and a metal arm,” said Steve.
"Happy, to help. Stop by any time," he said.
“Doesn’t make it the same thing.”
She had been having a lot of those lately. The cause wasn’t rooted in anything physical. It would have been treated if that were the issue.
"Yes, would you want that?" asked Tony.
“I agree.”
From his tone, it was clear the alpha didn’t want to linger on the subject. He didn't press. It was personal.
“What?” he asked.
“Yeah, I just have to make it there for Thanksgiving,” said Clint.
"I murdered those people!" she screamed.
“I’m fine.”
Piper suppressed a groan. This was going to be so boring. He stacked several large equally boring books focusing on the Revolutionary War. The text seemed to thoroughly cover each battle, major player, and strategy used.
They readied their targets. Steve took aim and fired. Stopping when the ten-round magazine emptied. Their targets came forward. His shots focused at center mass, while Natasha preferred the headshots.
The elevator door shut. That brief happiness they'd shared was zapped from Steve's expression. Steve had gone to that distant place again. Tony didn't know how to get the omega out of it. This new task was where his mind needed to be. It was easier than lingering on his relationship issues. Maybe the honeymoon period was over. Banner's studies caught his attention.
“By him.”
A panicked yell forced her from her sleep. She had no idea what hour of the night it was. Theodore paced the room. His posture screamed aggression. Piper covered her mouth not wanting to whimper. She wrapped herself in the blanket, trying to avoid his attention.
“I won’t have the press hunting down a potentially innocent family,” said Steve. The press had already turned against them. Questioning how they could let daughter be taken. Their capabilities as parents. He didn’t want to see a normal family put through that.
“Stop. Whatever you’re saying isn’t going stop me from reporting you. You damaged one of Hydra’s most valuable tools. Whatever you were trying to prove by pissing him off may have set us back in fulfilling our goals.”
Tony's ran his fingers through that golden brown hair.
“No, problem, sugar lump.”
"I don't know," said Piper.
Gunfire sent them ducking for cover under the bed. Rune covered his ears, trying to block it out. Piper closed her eyes, focusing on the sound. The sound was too rapid in succession to be a handgun. It had to be an automatic weapon. The only people who carried automatic weapons were Sir's men. Gunfire continued without break for some time, and soon the scent of blood invaded their enclosure. They pressed into each other, trying to escape the smell.
“Do you have any proof?” said Rhodes.
“Yes, Sir.”
Steve stabbed his fork into his. Suddenly losing his appetite.
“Yeah, Papa.”
“We’ll go wherever you want, sweetheart.”
The remaining one came charging, rearing up. Steve locked his arms around the bear’s waist, keeping it still. Its claws scraped harmlessly against his shield.
"Snooze, Jarvis."
Piper pushed away his hand. “What will you do with him when you do?! Throw him in another prison! He’s sick!”
“I’d rather not.”
Piper sighed. Rune wasn’t what Winter told her he'd be, at least not yet. He wasn't bad. Would he be as limited in what he could tell her as Winter? It was easy enough to get him talking. He could be a way out of here. For helping her, she'd be sure to bring him with her if they ever got out of here. Piper yawned. She should probably sleep too she'd heal faster if she did.
Tony drew closer, but a snarl forced him back. He knew the signs and what was coming next. His mate was verging on an episode. And knew Steve wouldn't want anyone seeing him like that.
She rubbed her temples. He always mentioned the tripling of the stock when caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
“I don’t believe you.”
“Alright,” he said. Steve settled in the seat next to her. He closed his eyes and moments later he was snoring.
“Let’s get to training,” she said.
Winter could probably sleep standing. She didn't move, not wanting to wake him. Was it even tomorrow yet? She reached for one of the books at the end of the bed. The slight sound of the pages turning woke him anyway.
“Mind."
“Can I use your washing machine?” asked Steve.
Early the following day, Steve woke. He lowered the blanket, checking for blood. Thankfully, there was none. Tony was asleep beside him.
“I will be,” said Pepper.
“Maybe never. Relax about it.”
“We have a team looking into it. I don’t think so.,” said Maria.
“That’s my secret, Cap. I’m always angry,” he said. Effortlessly he transformed into the Hulk. His large green fists crushing the beast's skull, with such force its armor fell away.
“Maybe the next one if that’s okay,” said Steve.
"I'm sorry I shouldn't have lied. I promise I'll make it up to you somehow."
“Your ledger is dripping, gushing red and you think saving a man more virtuous than yourself will change anything? This is a basis sentimentality. This is a child’s prayer. Pathetic,” he growled. He expected more from her. She failed to be as entertaining as he'd hope.
Steve flipped them, his hips rested between Tony’s legs. Again the blush returned to his cheeks There was something extremely erotic about the position. It caused a shiver to go through his spine. He got up before it could go any further.
“Nothing in the fridge to your liking?” asked Tony.
“Godfather, one my favorites,” said Tony.
Tony didn’t question it. He needed this contacted. He needed Steve. His arm wrapped around the omega bringing him closer. Tony tightened his hold on Steve, afraid to let go.
"It's more what you want," said Lena.
“You saved my grandfather's ass countless times. The least I could do is try to help you in your time of need,” said Antoine.
“No.”
Tony groaned he barely slept last night. The constant sound of Steve throwing up wasn't something that could easily be slept through. Steve's form was coiled around him, drooling on his chest. When he tried getting out his grip Steve's hold tightened.
Tony tensed. He thought she’d ask sooner. “I think that’s something you have to ask Papa."
"Activate Babysitting Protocol. Get her out of here." The suit shot off the balcony seconds before Steve burst through. He was growling lowly. Tony made himself look as unintimidating as possible. Steve glared at him.
"Take out then?"
“It doesn’t matter it likely is the source of power. But I bet what you can do is directly related to the people who run this place. Have you always been with them?” asked Piper.
“We can watch Gone With the Wind if you want tonight. We can watch it in color,” said Tony. Steve threw another bagel at him. “What did I do that time?”
“Come out now.” The pups were frozen in fear.
Tony waited for Steve to sleep. A positive side effect of Steve's pregnancy was rest came easier to the omega. He didn't so frequently suffer from night terrors. He ran a tender hand over Steve's round stomach and was greeted by a gentle kick against his palm.
“Everything to your liking?” asked Happy.
“Okay umm."
“Steve.”
“What does that mean?” asked Steve.
He forced his legs shut.
“He thought what we think. The Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That’s something the world sorely needs,” Fury explained, seeing Steve shake his head.
“I'm not. Unless you’re having second thoughts.”
"We'll start with bringing Captain Rogers on stage, then bring you on later," said Oprah.
“Hey, ponytail express what’s the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?” said Tony.
Tony nodded. If he screwed up, at least the kid would have Steve, Rhodes, and Natasha.
“Yes, thank for your time,” said Steve.
"I would have come up with something better, but only had half an hour."
“Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography.”
“Spending time with a friend,” said Steve.
“I’m agent Phil Coulson."
“We have to go,” he said.
"You aren't going to hurt it." It was difficult to believe there was a life growing there.
“See you soon.” Tony hung up.
“She didn’t ask me. She asked Tony.”
“If you ever need a break from the familiar-
“Do you two fight like?” asked Rune. That would be even worse than hearing Piper's parents fight.
"Fine," winced Steve.
“Yes, and more specifically, a female omega, one of those lowest the on the societal food chain.”
Steve caught an arrow centimeter before it hit his chest.
“Okay, if that’s what you want.”
“Piper, we’re handling this,” said Tony.
"He isn't a member of the responding department. We'll find her, Steve. Have you called Tony yet?”
"It's an honor meeting you, I only wish it were under different circumstances," she said.
Winter picked her up. Her arms circled around his neck.
“Hello.”
“Papa didn’t,” she said.
He was hesitant to leave his baby with a stranger.
“None.”
An hour later, an alpha entered the room. He smelled of pepper and gun cleaner. Winter knew that scent.
He slowly opened his eyes. A small adorable bundle was curled against Tony's chest. All he could see was tuft thick dark brown hair. He hurriedly sat up to get a better look at her.
“May I open it? Please?” asked Piper excitedly.
"Mine could beat yours," said Rumlow.
“You’ll have to get checked too Rogers,” said Clint.
“When I was sixteen on Coney Island. Bucky spent all our travel fair trying to win a stuffed animal for a redhead named Deloris. We had to hitch a ride back in a freezer truck,” said Steve.
“We also have to figure out the vice president thing,” said Rhodes.
The admission caught him off guard. He wasn’t expecting Tony to admit wrongdoing. Steve didn't blame the alpha for reacting the way he did. It was reasonable. He didn’t know what say, so he nuzzled against Tony neck seeking comfort in his embrace. Tony’s arm wrapped around his shoulders drawing him closer.
The air went static, as if it were moments away from a thunderstorm. The lights in the room flickered.
“It’s not.”
"It's snowing right. Where are we upstate?"
“Get away!”
“You must promise me that you’ll never take your own life if something were to happen to me. You have to be here for her,” said Steve, placing Tony’s hand over his stomach.
“I know. We’ll go to Howard's mansion. I've had it updated to have anything we could possibly need. It’s been ready for a few weeks now," said Tony.
“That would be great, Rune, thank you,” said Steve.
“Can we just lay down?” he asked.
He watched as the man was comically thrown around the room. The alpha managed to strike a dramatic pose before being sent to the ground by a flying ass plate.
The pup looked on the verge of crying again. Her discovery of the collar had brought back that bad mood. He took one of the medical books from the foot of the bed, dropping it in her lap. The doctor probably left them for the girl to read. He gained nothing from them.
That’s all he said before shutting down and simply stared blankly at his sketchpad. She moved closer to him. Hoping her nearness would provide him with some comfort. She hummed the lullaby Papa used to calm her down.
“That’s better.”
“How shortly, Jarvis?”
“You want one, and I want to spoil you. And we haven’t bought anything for the kid yet.”
"Did anyone drop off a package while I was gone?" asked Steve.
“Did something happen?” asked Piper.
Tony went to the shower. The hot water soothed his aching muscles. He closed his eyes. Shivering when he thought of Steve's pleas for him to come back. He turned off the water. Tony changed into fresh clothes. He kneeled by the bed, gently nudging the beauty awake. Steve whined, but his eyes slowly opened.
“I was only gone a few days,”
“To add it to his nest,” said Tony.
“Your alpha contract. Read it over and see if there’s anything you wish to change,” said Phil.
"God, what do I do?" He gave up standing and sunk to the frigid road.
“You’re in good hands, Mr. Stark.”
“Yes.”
December 27, 2012
The image of the beautiful castle caught his interest.
"I won't let that happen."
Bruce was amazed at what he'd gathered from the samples. Tony's cells took on some attributes from the serum when Steve claimed him. It would slow his aging, make him heal faster, not as fast Steve, but faster than the average human. He could spend months learning from these samples. What could be learned from it could change the medical field forever. In seven weeks a cell-free fetal DNA could be taken from Steve's blood it would be interesting to see what he could learn from it. He promised not to do such things. It would be a massive breach of privacy.
Jeff was terrified of the girl and Winter. Shit, she was the daughter of Captain America and Ironman.
He stopped in front of a shop. Its shelves were packed with plushy stuffed unicorns. He touched the fluffy sparkling fabric. Pipes would like something like this. An omega should have soft things. They should be comfortable. All she had was a scratchy wool blanket.
“Which are?”
“Your husband seems worried,” said Dr. Wu.
“I have ten armored droids. They are twice as valuable and infinitely better at handling the situation.” Tony wasn’t going to waste time waiting to get the S.T.R.I.K.E. force.
“Does she know about us?” asked Steve.
“Tony!” Steve arched off the table as Tony's fingers hit perfectly inside him.  Tony moaned lowly in his ear. The alpha dropped his weight on him. Steve purred enjoying the alpha's weight on top of him. He ran his fingers along Tony’s back. They nuzzled.
*****
“Jarvis, you called me, Steve."
“Matt?”
“Varies from one to five,” said Steve.
"Morning sleepyhead," said Tony.
“I should go."
“We’ll know pretty soon though, today,” he said.
"Don't care," said Tony.
"You had Pepper."
She hid her face in Papa’s shoulder, letting her mask drop. Piper breathed in his honey vanilla scent, a smell she'd known since birth. It made her relax. He put her down when they got the bathroom and helped her out of her muddy clothes, before placing her in warm water. She sighed. It used to take so long for the water to warm up at the base.
The next morning he woke before. Tony modified the gym so it could meet his level of exercise. He went to the kitchen. Tony was there only wearing a towel.
“What does it do?”
"The bed is fine. It's me."
He’d forgotten that they were even there. An agonized cry pierced the calm.
"Related not about, and it wasn't a fight."
“He’s feral and has gotten out,” said a nurse.
Vanuatu is a South Pacific Ocean nation made up of roughly 80 islands that stretch 1,300 kilometers. The islands offer scuba diving at coral reefs, underwater caverns, and wrecks such as the WWII-era troopship SS President Coolidge. Harborside Port Vila, the nation’s capital and economic center, is on the island of Efate. The city is home to the Vanuatu National Museum, which explores the nation’s Melanesian culture.
"He threatened to taser me."
“My nausea has faded into dizziness. I’m not going risk that changing by getting up,” said Steve.
“I don’t get. How can something be dead and alive at the same time?” said Piper.
“Shit! He’s waking up - take care of him!”
She would have to get in contact with that ape. It was a conversation bound to end in a screaming match. She quietly snuck out of bed and out to the backyard.
“Yeah, it’s going to be fun,” she said.
“I’ll be teaching you chemistry, physics, biology, and math. Each class lasting about an hour maybe more depending on your understanding. Additionally, every day you’ll have an added private session, with me, for an hour. The schedule will change as needed. Winter is in charge of teaching you combat skills and other tools of the trade,” said Lena.
"Nice to meet you," said Tony.
*****
“I am calm!”
The pup cuddled against his chest. She started making that odd fluttering sound again. Piper yawned, her eyes growing heavy.
Steve cracked open a window letting some fresh air in.
The agony in Tony’s chest bristled against his ribcage at the sight of the deep hurt he'd caused Steve. He didn't have the strength to explain what he was feeling or even to stand, so he sunk to the floor.
“I’m not much for goodbyes,” she said.
“What was your answer?”
“One of my favorite comfort foods. My mom made them for me and Bucky all the time,” said Steve. No matter how many of them Steve ate he never grew sick of them, which his mother was grateful for. It was a cheap and easy meal for her to make.
She kicked his feet out from underneath him, sending him to the ground with a thud.
“Will you?” asked Steve.
"Steve, it isn't that bad."
She hadn’t realized her arms were still wrapped around his neck. Piper shook her head. Why was she doing this? They didn’t want her. Why was it so hard to let go?
Dr. Wong was a physiatrist who worked with the New York Special Victims Unit for ten years before retiring. He studied medicine at Howard University. Currently, he was volunteering at an omega shelter.
. Steve took out his phone, now was as good a time as any to call Edith. Hopefully, she wasn't too busy after all that's happened.
Steve smiled. Even when he was stressed, Tony effortlessly found a way to make him smile.
“What were you and Papa fighting about?”
“You don’t know that for sure,” Lena pressed, “What if you lose control and hurt him? It’s a likely possibility, and you know that.”
Tony ran his hand over Steve’s stomach, not even a scar. Pulling away when Steve flinched. "Did that hurt?"
"What do you feel like watching, little miss?" asked Jarvis.
"I believe so."
“A stranger will be cutting into my mate’s heart!” He sprung up, pacing the large room.
“I’m not picking up any traces of human life,” said Natasha.
“I’m not pregnant, Tony." Steve wiped a tear from the corner of his eye. He shouldn’t be laughing, but Tony’s expression was priceless.
Winter didn’t release the commanding hold until the pup was forced into sleep. It was for the pup’s own good. The woman smiled, leaning back in her chair; gentle expression fading, replaced by a cool calculating gaze.
Piper slowly stepped into the hallway, instantly searching for some sort of retribution, then quickly followed after Winter, not wanting to get separated from him. He seemed to know his way around.
The alert went off when Tony was about to walk out on stage. Tony was nearly brought to his knees brought fear, distress, and worry coursing through his bond.
Steve strode toward Loki. Holding his shield slightly lower and closer to his stomach.
Steve huffed. “I have time. I only have to go down a few floors.”
“Of course.”
“But you’d figure I’d come,” she said.
. It took seconds for him put it together. Fuck, Fury wants him to be Captain America’s alpha for a season. Saying no to the request would be impossible.
“Glad to be home.”
“I’d sit this one out, Cap,”
"Where do we start?" asked Steve.
Tony came up from his lab. He stopped in front of the parted door of Steve’s studio. Steve's distress had leaked into the hallway. He knocked on the door. Steve jumped in his seat.
"That depends on how soon Howard's notes are retrieved. I'd say a week at most," he said.
“Shit!"
“YOU WANT ME PUT THE HAMMER DOWN!”
“Where are you leaving to in such a rush?” asked Kate.
Her phrasing meant nothing. Despite gentle wording, it wasn't a question, it was a command. Winter picked up the pup so she wouldn't fall, before walking onto the cool floor with his bare feet. The office they went to was nondescript, like almost everything else. Even though it been a week since the pup was last brought there, it still reeked powerfully of distress. The lingering scent would only serve to set her further on edge. It even made him uncomfortable.
“How do you know?”
He went garage. Steve pulled his coat closer. Riding his bike this late in the year wasn't comfortable. Tony would have to start picking him again. He called Tony.
"Luv you."
“It was Steve!”
“I’m sorry Tony." He hated when that side of him showed up. Steve picked up the shattered pieces of his phone.
“What happened up there?” asked Natasha.
“What do you have?”
“What did he do after the war?” asked Steve.
Rabid behavior was a frequently occurring trait in alpha super soldiers, not seen their beta counterparts. In the nineties, one of them was put down for that very reason. Despite the issue, the higher up wanted alphas.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Your EKG has shown arrhythmia recently. I want to keep you overnight for observation. Hospital procedure says that you stay at least three days”
“They’re sizing each other up. Neither enjoys making the first move, for very different reasons though. Rune likes to give his opponents a chance to show their own strength, before shocking them with his. While Piper prefers studying her opponent for as long as possible to formulate the best strategy,” Lena explained easily.
“Yes, yes, his think tank thought it up.”
“That’s a four-hour drive, but I’m up for it,” he said.
They had to be professional in public. Everything in him wanted to nuzzle against the alpha's neck. They loaded Loki into the jet and restrained him. Natasha strapped Loki in. The entire time the man kept a playful smirk but said nothing. Steve doubted the restraints would hold. Loki's scent surprised him. It was sweet. A clear marker of an omega. It was a combination of rosemary and cinnamon. Loki is an omega. The only reason he picked it up was his enhanced senses. That green eyes glare set him at unease. He was planning something. It was all too easy. Steve saw the footage of Thor. Loki came from the same lineage and possessed the same strength. He was holding back. Steve's inner omega urged closer to Tony.
“At seven weeks, I’ll be able to get fetal DNA from Steve’s blood. I’m sure Banner wants to take a look at it,” said Edith.
"We can take her! Fire!"
I'm trying to think of someone that would sing at Steve and Tony's wedding, but I'm drawing a blank. Any suggestions?
“Defend me.”
"No, but he was the cause of many of mine," said Bruce. Piper never met his alter ego, something for which he was grateful.
“She’s been informed. Once she completes her task. She’ll rejoin us,” said Phil.
Steve didn’t have a chance to react before the computer was flung across the room. Inhuman sounds rippled through his alpha. So rigid was the agony, it brought Steve to tears to witness. Agony was quickly replaced by rage. He watched as his mate took it out on their surroundings.
"He's not my boyfriend," said Steve.
Steve groaned. Tony knew the omega was underplaying it. Him mentioning meant it was bad. There was an hour until his meeting. It wasn't enough time to properly help Steve reach his needed orgasm. He could still.
"Anything can be turned into a weapon if the right amount of force is applied," she said.
“I won't."
“What are you doing here?” asked Steve.
“You have yourself an amazing child. We’ll be lucky to have her,” said Lewis.
"You're giving a lecture at Georgia Tech. I promised Pepper you'd be there," said Steve.
Tony allowed Steve to pull him away. They slid into the nesting couch, together. Neither of them slept, only quietly lying next to each other, waiting for sleep to wash over them.
“I don’t want to waste time playing games with you. So, why should I trust you? I don’t wanna hear about all the degrees that make you qualified.”
"This wasn't drunken fueled destruction, Tony. I can smell both alpha and omega distress. Those bruises on your neck and chest. Are caused by what I think?"
Steve realized he was crying and wiped away the tears.
“I’ll let you work for it,” he said.
Piper stared at the door, mentally willing Winter to come back inside. She hated being alone with this woman. Lena was
“Which is why he needs to leave,” said Tony.
“We were told to,” he said.
Piper turned red. She took a breath, shaking it away. “I needed some space from everything.”
a tiny niggling voice reminded him.
“At least we've got the middle names sorted. Something Sarah Margret Stark,” said Tony.
Steve bit back a pained groaned as his muscles contorted, bracing against a nearby table.
It wasn't the first time he found Tony asleep in one of his suits. It made Steve nervous. What if Tony had a night terror in one? Having to subdue Tony when he was in the armor wouldn't be an easy task. Steve tapped on the mask.
“Good afternoon, Captain Rogers. It’s 80 degrees out and sunny,” said Jarvis.
“A reminder Sir maintenance is due on the arc reactor."  Letting Steve literally hold his heart would earn him some points. He pushed away the screen. Tony closed his eye and tried getting some sleep.
"I'll be right, I promise."
Clint tossed at one of the dummies it deflected harmlessly off the target. Steve laughed. He took his shield from the floor.
He sat up, rolling his shoulders. Tony's side of the bed was empty, as it had been ever since Piper was taken. Steve ached body and soul. The most simple of tasks became difficult. He had to check on Tony. The man spent almost all his time in the lab.
“It’s alright,” said George.
Tony returned her to the center of the nest.
"Need me to pick you up?" asked Tony.
“Him having a boyfriend by far,” said Rhodes.
“Who are they?” asked Steve.
“Steve?”
“He’s making you breakfast?” asked Natasha.
"Please call me, Edith," she said.
“This is fine,” said Natasha. She closed the door behind the agent. “Do you want top or bottom bunk?”
"No, simply a reminder of the power dynamic. You may be the adult here, but I'm the one with the power."
“The body alone is just a machine. It's evolved like any other through time, but at a much slower rate. It gets murky when you take into consideration the mind. Love is just a mixture of testosterone, estrogen, adrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin. But the way humans react or display the end result of that chemical mixture varies drastically. It can be predicted to some percentage but nothing concrete.”
“It’s different for every patient. I had an omega in the slow stage of labor for four days,” said Jackie.
Piper grew anxious after a few minutes of sitting there. The scent of stale distress made it impossible to relax. In the end, Piper gave in and took a seat across from Lena, so the whole hour was spent playing chess. The match ended in a draw, and Piper was finally allowed to return to her room. Winter sat, unharmed, in their chair.
"When was the last you ate?" he asked.
Steve was sensitive with pleasure. He pulled Tony kissed him, pushing his tongue into alpha’s mouth tasting himself there.
Piper groaned; her bed was wet. She'd done it again. The sun wasn't up yet.
Tony smiled at the blushing omega. Turning all the redder under his gaze.
“I’ll be right back,” Steve waited.
Steve watched the scenery change as they drove out of the city. The entire drive Tony barely went over the limit. The pulled into Peggy's driveway. Piper slept the entire drive there. Steve unbuckled Piper from her seat. He carefully tucked into his jacket, protecting her from the cold. Peggy hurried to open the door for them, rushing them inside. Tony helped him out of his jacket.
“You’re a great catch, Steve. Until you carry his mark this will keep on happening,” she said.
Steve cuddled his pup. Her gentle scent soothing his nerves. "I'm so sorry, Piper. I didn't mean to scare you."
“Natasha.”
He nodded, surprised she wasn't dressed in a black jumpsuit. Instead, she wore baggy cargo pants, a t-shirt, and a cotton shawl over her head. He nodded, following her to jet and the four members of the S.T.R.I.K.E. team. Rumlow smirked at him.
Steve handed helmet to Pepper. “Put it on.”
“Ignore it,” said Tony, moving between Steve’s legs.
"Cut the feed, Jarvis."
Steve sighed when he saw more press awaiting them.
"Airplane."
“How?” asked Tony.
"Senator Stern even sent a gift though it is addressed to Steve," said Jarvis.
They did rock paper scissors to decide who would make the call.

“Tony?”
“He’s not here.” He instantly knew that wrong thing to say. At first, it looked like she was going to cry. Then her expression changed swiftly, anger apparent. She stomped away from him. “Piper, they’d -” Winter started again, but hardly knew how to continue. Piper spun, grabbed a nearby hundred-pound plate and threw it at him. It zipped by his head.
“What?” said Tony.
Maybe it would be, but she wouldn’t give up on the chance that it wouldn’t be. She knew how much the odds were against her. Piper was led to the training room where Winter was waiting.
“What’s our assignment?” asked Steve.
Steve didn’t even realize he was crying.
“Oh, you are,” said Phil.
“A single alpha that injected Steve with something. We’ll know more when he wakes up,” said Tony.
Tony kissed him. Piper stirred against them.
"There have been changes since our bond," said Tony.
"I have to examine your neck. This may be uncomfortable," said Bruce. The claim was healing at a normal human rate. Odd, given Steve's advanced healing factor. As soon as he touched the mark Steve snarled, flashing his teeth. Bruce backed off. He didn't take the omega's aggression personally.
"They say it's chemical. The change is most likely due to the serum,” said Barny.
"It was horrible keeping that from him. He forgave me, but I can't let go of that guilt."
The tunnel forked. He and Natasha split off to the right. They were forced into a single file approach as the tunnel narrowed further. In some areas, he was forced to lower his shield to side at some points.
“Is that all you have?” asked Tony.
Steve scrambles backward momentarily bursting through the fog of lust. He didn't need all this. Only sink back into seconds later as the alpha's tongue continued to work him.
Steve put on his ragged shirt, not wanting to draw further attention.
“Been around enough bad people to know the good ones.”
"Eat up."
In her hand was an old nametag. She flipped it over revealing the formula on the back.
“Come in,” said Steve.
"No, you can go play outside. There's an amazing playground in the backyard. And I'm sure Jarvis did something wonderful with the playroom."
“I can’t believe it,” said Natasha.
The drive home was peaceful. They got home around 8:40 pm.
Steve bit his lip. He wanted to ask what this was. It was their second date, yet it felt like so much more.
"I thought painting would help me relax, but I can't think of a subject."
"It's your distress; it makes your scent sting the nose."
“What happened to him?” asked Steve.
“Why?”
“No, just got back from a ride needed to clear my head,” said Steve.
“Oh, this doesn’t come off.”
