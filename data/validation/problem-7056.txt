white teeth bright in the dim space, and it felt exactly like one of those moments on the battlefield, when they'd both done something in perfect unison and laughed together afterward in buoyant glee.
Tony stares at him, his eyes a little wet. "This still could be Narnia," Tony says. As better as they've become at clarifying emotions, Tony still changes the subject when he's feeling too vulnerable. "It
"Oh, you know me," Steve huffed a half-bitter laugh. "It's probably for the best." Single, then, Tony surmised. Steve cleared his throat. "I'm sorry about you and Jan," Steve added, because he was never not going to change the subject when conversation skirted close to his vulnerabilities.
Tony basks guiltily in the praise. "Well. When you don't catch him thirty hours into a paperwork bender."
somehow, which was another sensation Tony didn't like a lot. There wasn't much about this whole scenario that Tony was enjoying at all.
Steve, because he was an eternal show-off, picked up the three other empty crates in one hand, dutifully following Tony to the storage closet. Tony thought it was just Steve's practicality raising its head, and his need to control things sometimes – he wanted Steve to feel comfortable after making him talk about something so unpleasant, something Steve had probably been stewing silently over for weeks – but then Steve somehow moved too quickly, too sharply, and he was holding up the last crate to push onto the top shelf, and the door he'd been propping open with his foot closed.
Steve frowned deeply. "Well, it's just—you were always so interested in me. As Iron Man. And I just—you're a billionaire, Tony. And a genius, the most intelligent person I've ever met. Shell-head being into me made more sense, we work so well together, and he was just—I thought you were just like me, a fellow warrior."
brain a little mushy too. He still hadn't quite yet announced his intention to co-parent Sarah, but once they were both safely in New York, it was only a matter of time. Steve had to know that. Tony held his breath as he waited to see what Steve did next. He should probably turn Tony into SHIELD, now he was the world's most infamous supervillain.
"I keep forgetting where we are too," Tony pulled a wry face. "I thought I'd be up early enough to get this done before anyone woke up. Well, it's been a good enough run, I guess."
Steve drew his forehead back, attempting a serious expression that was slightly derailed by a somewhat goofy grin he was trying to tamper down. "Yeah," he nodded. "We should."
There was movement inside; Tony could see the shadow of someone coming to the door. It was certainly someone
Abruptly aware that he was a person made of nerve endings and muscular contractions, Tony climbed down the ladder as slowly as he dared without making it obvious Steve had ruffled him. Time had done nothing to Steve's ability to affect him like that. After years of fighting alongside him, and too-often
connected to his body, despite what Strange seemed to think. Strange did some more of his mumbo-jumbo over the teleporter, and then, seemingly satisfied, used it to disappear back to his creepy-ass mansion.
Steve's close to Iron Man now, close enough to admire those muscles up close. Iron Man's not talking much, making faint noises of agreement as the woman talking to him rambles about wanting to adopt, but not wanting the responsibility, because what would happen if the kid put muddy hand-prints all over her genuine Picasso?
"Yeah," Tony said bitterly, "running off to Maine, covering your tracks, not telling me you were basically adopting your dead friend's baby—that
Steve looks at Tony's tousled hair and counts his even, deliberate breaths with the same care he counted dials and days for. He doesn't answer Jan, but she doesn't ask again; maybe his expression speaks volumes enough.
"I don't need to." Steve stopped trying to clamp down on his smile. "I already know the most important things about you anyway."
Tony stared at Steve sadly. "I would if I could, darling." His voice cracked too, on that last word. He'd never gotten to call Steve that in person. Tony was definitely going to add that to his own list of regrets.
unfavorably to Tony's secret, Tony was pretty sure about that. Nothing he could think of. And then, once the shock had faded, maybe there could be some more kissing… His eyes glazed over a second. Pepper coughed indelicately and Tony cleared his throat, gripped his pen more tightly, and forced himself to concentrate. He quickly signed his name in the marked boxes.
I'm here," Tony said, scowling as Strange closed his eyes and started hovering mid-air, his legs crossed, "I've been here the
Tony puts the mug down and straightens up in his seat. He shifts so he's looking directly at Steve with a look of focused intent. "Do you promise not to laugh at me?"
Another thought creeps in, low and hot. He'd thought it before, during their sparring session, but now seeing those thighs under a different fabric makes the thought even more impressive. Iron Man's physique is
Steve's so stunned he doesn't even react when Tony tugs him into another of those dizzying kisses. Steve kisses back, stupefied by how good he feels, even over his spinning head.
"Have you looked up local schools yet? Nursery places can be hard to get, even at her age. And have you registered her yet with a local physician?" Tony pulled out his StarkPhone, immediately looking up the town on his browser. "We should check out their reviews, see which one is the best one to ask for—"
you," Steve said. "I tried to go to a fabric store, but—I had no idea what I was looking for. And she—"
Steve slips into his bathroom—pulls out a pink bar of hand-soap, and then automatically tips the contents of his mouthwash bottle down the sink. He watches the liquid slip away, almost hypnotized by the spiral motion.
and Tony Stark was so impressive. Steve was probably lying unconscious under a pile of rubble. If Steve could have picked anyone in the world for Iron Man to be, maybe he would have picked Tony Stark.
Steve wants to wallow out in the dark with his thoughts for the rest of the night, but that's stupid. Tony wouldn't want any of his guests to wait all night out in the cold. Steve takes a deep breath and returns to the party.
"You said once the helmet was open we could get something that I could use to pack your wound," Steve said. All-business he could do. He was dizzy, and didn’t know if it was from the pain or the blood loss. Or maybe the dizziness was because of the sneaking thought that had crept in, that Steve really
Steve had to know he was out here. Tony wriggled. The doorstep was hard; his butt was starting to get cold. He was starting to consider going to his car, fetching something soft to sit on, when the door opened again, and Steve's face sheepishly poked out of it.
someone to their dream, and then a thousand steps beyond—looking past Steve’s bright ideas of happiness into some far-off vision that Steve couldn’t even imagine.
"Is that safe?" Steve asks, because that's more important to him than satisfying their collective curiosity. He can't deny that he is curious. Iron Man isn't exactly an open book or effusive about things, so every time Steve gets a tiny scrap of information about the technology
But bravery had a short fuse until it burned out and Tony pulled back from the kiss, eyes wide, an apology ready to fall from his lips. It stuck in his throat at the look on Steve's face.
"Thanks, Pep," Tony smiled at her and handed the papers back. She was hesitating like she wanted to say more. "Anything else?"
Steve looked exhausted; Tony couldn't stay that close, quickly sitting up and moving back to the wall. He felt safer there, slightly at a distance.
Steve had woken up panting and disoriented more times than he cared to admit over the last few weeks, because his nightmares had taken that slim margin that had resulted in Tony's survival and crushed it. In the worst of those dreams, Steve had also been found too late, Tony's corpse lying on him, Steve choking on his blood.
"I'm glad you're up and about," Steve said. His voice was stiff, polite, and then he paused. "You've already talked to Carol?"
The bulb in this kitchen is just a normal fluorescent tube. Steve knows that for sure. He took it down and smashed it on Day 34. And Day 78. And Day 99, because Tony was being an ass, and it was either smash up the kitchen or smash Tony's face.
Steve sits by the door and turns dials, and Tony makes him a plate of pancakes, sitting cross-legged next to him, hand-feeding him bites of the traditional day-off breakfast food. Tony's grin is wicked; Steve doesn't understand until he gets the second pancake and a burst of strawberry flavor hits his taste buds. Tony's expression turns swiftly innocent. Steve rolls his eyes fondly and keeps turning dials; he doesn't need instant gratification. Steve pliantly finishes eating the pancakes Tony feeds him, continuing the methodical clicking of dials, and Tony pushes Steve's shirt aside just to press a warm kiss against his shoulder.
"You already know who I am," Iron Man said, sounding baffled. "You don’t need a name to know the most important part. Out of everyone in the whole world, you already
"I thought to myself, if someone—just a regular human someone, no super serum, no Vita-Rays—could hurl themselves at certain doom so often, then I had no excuse not to be as brave," Steve says. "It took me a while to learn the
" Tony said, bitterly. He concentrated enough to sit down on the chair opposite Steve; looking at Steve over his own unconscious body was kind of weird.
Happy made a loud, amused noise into his milk glass. Tony looked down at himself, still in the Santa suit. "Maybe tonight will help you figure it out? Let you get into character?"
"Yeah, uh—" Hank squinted at him. "While you were busy making out with Santa Claus, we got some old trouble in New Jersey—the Wrecking Crew are out to wreck the holidays—didn't you hear your identicard?"
Steve might not have put the frankly-kinda-obvious-in-hindsight pieces together to know the real name of his best friend in this decade, but he’d been right in that godforsaken parking structure: he
The world right now was noise and pain and blurry lines of gray and a whistling noise in the back of his skull that was so high-pitched it made his vision blur.
"Shoot, I have to go," Tony says, looking up from where his identicard is clutched in one hand. To his credit, he doesn't even try to explain why he has to go. He looks at Steve, truly apologetic. "I'm so sorry. Can I see you again?"
than that had felt stupid, selfish, impossible; it had never been something he'd thought about seriously pursuing. He and Steve were flammable, incendiary; Tony had just been too pleased Steve was there to linger on anything but that relieved joy.
that Steve liked about him. Sometimes, when Iron Man said something witty, Steve had to clench his fists and take a few deep breaths when no one was watching him. Delirious rambling from someone so smart might still sound like coherent speech. It was just one more vexation; his worries were starting to pile up. Why hadn’t anyone found them yet?
He takes a lot of them home afterward, if the gossip columns are correct, and shows them a swell time. Steve feels odd thinking about that, what it must be like; Tony's pretty blue eyes, picking you out from a crowd, and then one of his large hands on your waist, that suave accent inviting you to his bed. Steve shudders and pushes the fantasy aside. Tony's been a great friend to Steve over the last couple of years, helping him adjust to modern times. He's been nothing but a gentleman and there's been no sign that Tony might be interested in Steve particularly.
"Let's just go home," Tony said, and regretted saying even that much, because that word was wrong. How could
It's for the best. Tony's handsome and kind and he'll find someone better for him soon; Steve's sure of it.
The kids had loved his appearance and performance, and, even better, Tony's brain now held a comprehensive list of things the children in the long-term ward at Queen County Hospital wanted from Santa that year. Santa might be making one more delivery to that hospital before the week was over.
Steve wakes up late on day 303 to the smell of pancakes. He sits up in the (one) bed groggily. The room's reset again. Same bed, same pink coverlet, same dusky-rose sofa in the corner, same Formica dining table and chairs, same pink-painted walls, same pink analog clock, same pink curtains (no windows, just more wall), same pink kitchen appliances, same pink kitchen counters. The bathroom door is ajar. That looks the same too. Nothing changes.
Tony's fumbling at his own costume's pocket for what presumably is Iron Man's identicard; Steve would be more amused if he wasn't also fumbling quickly for his to slide it onto mute. Steve sighs quietly when he manages it, and tries not to wince guiltily. The Avengers will just have to wait a minute or two for him, that's all.
feeling the same sort of thing. And yeah, I should have probably been braver and tried to say something, but I'm glad I didn't. I'm
"They're all fried and neutralized," Tony said. He put the device on the edge of the nearby table so he could put both hands around the mug. The ceramic surface was still hot, even though the kitchen was several floors above and Steve had taken the stairs, both up and down again. More of that beneficial super-soldier strength and speed rearing its head. "Thanks for this."
leggings this time and Steve thinks he's going to die. Cause of death: Tony Stark. God, that would be an embarrassing obituary. Thankfully the public doesn't know Captain America's real name, so at least Steve could be buried honestly, without taking the Captain America mantle down with him.
″That's what an insane person would say.″ A pained look crossed Tony’s face; a particularly sharp inhale causing him to wheeze more loudly.
Tony's mouth was open, like he had a witty retort ready on hand, but he faltered, clearly sideswiped by Steve's demand. Maybe it was the evenness of it, or the intensity of Steve's eyes on his. Tony swallowed, his smirk falling, his eyes darkening. Steve kept staring, hoping Tony would decipher it as a serious request. A question deserving of an answer, despite the command of the delivery.
Staircases were strong in places like this one. Steve had seen buildings like this half-devastated by earthquakes and explosions, and the staircases were often the part that best survived best, so Clint and Simon were probably okay. Clint was only human, but Simon was strong enough to help dig he and Tony out of the rubble. Wanda and Vision would also have no trouble getting them out, with Vision’s ability to travel through walls and Wanda’s magic, but they were several floors above when the explosion happened. They could be caught up in this.
"Of course you're not going to wake up just because I ask." Steve laughed; the noise was a weird, twisted version of a laugh. "You always have to do things your own way, Tony. But who am I to talk? I'm exactly the same. I'm
Steve gives into temptation and thumps his face into the punching bag. It doesn't even make himself feel any better, it just makes the Avengers laugh. He doesn't know why he's still so impossibly fond of them all, he really doesn't.
Steve's eyes were wild and close. His breathing was ragged, disproportionate to the amount of exertion for a single kiss. Tony stared back at him, just as startled, just as
Happy's mouth went slack in realization. They got on so well, it was difficult for them both to remember sometimes that they lived in completely different spheres of experience. Happy squinted and
"Steve," Steve said, holding out his non-wand hand. "Steve Rogers." His gaze dropped to the buildings. "And I think… I think I'm a
"You looked a little cornered," Steve says, smiling politely at Iron Man, because if he doesn't temper his expression into something socially reasonable, he might just end up grinning uncontrollably.
Tony turned, looked up at Steve, and just—lost it. The impulse was too strong. Tony was unable to help himself; he leaned over Sarah, carefully cupped Steve's cheek, and kissed him.
Steve's heart hurt. Tony had been his best friend. He hadn't meant to hurt him like this. But it was the right thing to do. Love was dangerous. Love ripped you apart from the inside out. It was best to nip
"I can't believe you spoiled Robbie's brother like that," Steve murmured, and Tony braced for a lecture, but Steve just added, "that was
and no one would know it was him. The thought is thrilling, even if Steve knows that he probably won't do anything with the thought. It's enough for him right now to just think about doing it.
He spares a look at Tony then, but Tony's staring up at the ceiling still, his breathing carefully measured, like he's thinking it through.
Steve's got a thousand rational reasons why this whole chapter is better squirreled away as a sweet memory when he sees Tony slipping out from the dance floor to the balcony, and Steve's resolve shatters into teeny tiny pieces.
″Yeah?″ Tony raised an eyebrow, gracefully, in a way Steve tried to pretend he wasn't supremely envious about. Sarcastic eyebrows would have served him well in many situations. ″And what are you proposing?″
"It can’t be that much of a surprise how much I like you," Steve added, when Iron Man had been quiet too long for Steve’s calm.
"Uh," Tony says. "Because—" Oh shit. Steve's expression shifts into a suspicious one. "Because he usually puts his flowers in the lab, and he works on me in the lab, so—"
Definitions thumped through Tony's brain and then disappeared. Steve was close, and they were staring at each other, and Tony's skin was static electricity; Tony's body was genetically manufactured perfection, so why did it suddenly feel like his old chestplate was clamping down on him, digging spikes into his heart?
. The best parts of me. Believe me, you already know me, Cap. If I die here, it means I died getting to do what I loved. Next to someone who knows me better than anyone ever has, or ever will. It’s not a regretful way to go."
"What do you think I mean?" Tony demanded, setting off again to the disembarkment co-ordinates at an even brisker clip. His eyes threatened to sting and Tony blinked furiously. There was no way he was going to let Steve
Iron Man squeezes Steve's shoulder reassuringly. "Well. We rescued you, there's no world war going on now. There's plenty of time to get you caught up on everything you've missed out on." Iron Man side-eyes him. "Anything we can get started on now? Help you tick something off that bucket list?"
He called him Shell-head. As far as Steve knew, he was Iron Man. In a Santa costume. Tony had to proceed with that assumption for now.
Tony continued to stare helplessly. He was the one that was frozen now. But Steve wasn't. And because Steve was brave, always so brave, Tony kept watching as Steve got to his feet and took Tony's hand in his again. It was just as electric and Tony couldn't help the gasp that came from his throat at the realization it wasn't just a one-off fluke. For a moment, Tony wondered whether Steve was going to sit in his lap—Tony chalked that thought off as a hysterical daydream brought on by so much time of wishful thinking—and then Steve blew his expectations away like he always did.
and thought it was okay not to leave even a brief goodbye note. That fact had vastly rocked Tony's foundations.
It's taking place in the biggest ballroom Steve's ever seen. There's already what looks like nearly two hundred people milling around. There's a dance floor, a string quartet, a buffet table so loaded it's almost groaning, and an open bar in the corner. Over against the far wall is a long list of items up for blind auction; Steve stays away because his budget might be more than it's ever been, but even decades of back-pay don't come close to what some of the people in this room are worth.
Sometimes Steve's idea of morning jars painfully with Tony Stark's idea of nighttime. On these occasions, it's not unheard of that they both cross paths at an hour of the morning that most people would probably term
"I just—" Steve couldn’t shrug without hurting both of them. What was the point of holding words back now? "I hate the idea of it. The idea of never getting to say your real name. I’d regret that. I’d regret… never getting to
Oh. They're talking about Iron Man's amazing armor. It folds up? Steve blinks. Well, he supposes that makes sense.
Tony swallowed hard. Steve was staring at him, almost like he was entranced. It was impossible not to stare back. Steve had been close before, was he closer now? Tony's eyes caught on details: the prominent pulse on Steve's neck; the way his blond hair was pleasingly disheveled; the way his t-shirt clung to his broad shoulders, damp with a little sweat; those ever-alert and intense blue eyes.
"Tony," Steve said, and his voice sounded rough, and Tony had to be imagining that, surely? Tony clenched one hand into a fist, digging his nails into his palm. He felt so unreal that he needed the sharp pain of it. It was wishful thinking. It had to be.
"What the fucking good are you?" Tony snitted, folding his arms and leaning against the wall. He had to concentrate in order not to fall through it, which was making his brain make constant little shrieking noises, because what if he forgot to concentrate on
On the Avengers front, they've all still been stuck with clean-up after clean-up, courtesy of the supposedly-over War of the Realms. Tony doesn't mind it, not too much, now the odds are in their favor and they're just hunting down pockets of leftover creatures and monsters that haven't gotten the memo yet that they'd lost.
Taking as even a breath as he could manage, Steve finished glancing around. The explosion he barely recalled had caught them both in an enclosed pocket of fallen debris. There was that terrible, torturous gray in every visible direction. There was still air—at least there was that—maybe Iron Man had made a decent point earlier about the wondrous air system in this terribly ugly building. There was an intact vent to Steve’s left, and it was clearly intact enough to be functioning for the moment. They wouldn’t suffocate to death, then.
Tony found himself dragging his heels as he installed the last set of latches and it frustrated him. He never wanted to be in a place where he clearly
″You mean,″ Steve said slowly, ″that you built something into the armor to compensate for a collapsed lung
Tony tossed the bundle of mistletoe and glanced around the room consideringly. "I think I'm gonna put some up by the main door, just to be a brat. Come hold the ladder for me?"
Carol nodded and then her gaze caught on the panel and what he was looking at. Her mouth lifted at one side. "You gonna go get your guy?"
Steve swallows the swear word that nearly slips out because it's one thing internalizing all the wonderful things that happened and holding on to Tony's secret identity, but it's another thing entirely hearing parts of what happened from someone else. He keeps his face averted from the others, keeping up his punching, and tries to pretend he's not shamelessly hanging off Iron Man's every word.
Steve stares at him, unable to decipher Tony's words, even though they're simple and easy words and not the techspeak Tony uses as easy as breathing. In the artificial light, Tony's devoid of the angles and shadows that Steve is used to when he watches Tony work in his lab.
The clerk helpfully advised him to shave off his beard as he rang up Tony's purchases if he wanted to avoid the unwanted comparison.
It was when Tony was himself, and he was talking to Steve, that he regretted the secret identity thing the most. People knowing his identity was for their safety, but if anyone could protect themselves, wouldn't it be Steve Rogers?
“Cold,” Tony said, his pretty eyes slipping shut, and Steve was glad for it, because he could grimace out his hate without Tony seeing it.
"Shouldn't you be able to see him, if so?" Steve asked, moving his gaze away from Tony's body to glare at Strange suspiciously. Tony did a quiet fist-pump, because no one could see him, but at least Steve was there, asking the right questions.
saved him. That’s how they were in this mess, Steve realized, as the imaginary photo stills of memory finally lined up into an almost complete storyboard in Steve’s mind. They'd caught sight of their target; he’d had a larger device this time, and Steve raised his shield to attack. But Iron Man had detected something on his monitors, and the last thing Steve remembered after throwing his shield was the bright lights of an explosion, and Iron Man flying at him, and knocking him backwards, throwing them both out of the range of the blast.
" Jan whispers in the quinjet, her pretty eyes wide in confusion, like she can't even slightly comprehend it.
Steve swallows, his throat suddenly dry as he finds himself with more than a handful of Iron Man's firm ass under his palm.
quirk into something a little more joyful because if Tony was snarking, it meant that he was alive, and conscious, and that was good enough for now. ″I don't think I can get the faceplate back down.″
Except when Steve opens his mouth to say that, nothing comes out. Oh god. What's happening to him? Words. It's just words. Tell him the truth. That's it. It's simple.
" Jan says, and hops down from the hanging rings, surrendering the pretense she's actually concentrating on her training in favor of walking over to Iron Man. She's not the only one; nearly everyone's paused what they're doing, except for Vision, who's placidly running around the track like he needs the exercise.
hard in relief that the mouthwash is untouched. He still breaks the seal and tips it down the sink and pretends his eyes aren't stinging.
As Steve entered the mansion kitchen, his thoughts changed from coffee to an entirely different tune. Mostly that there was something nice about the way Tony’s eyes flitted briefly to Steve’s without a hint of hesitation, and there was something comforting about the way Tony’s mouth quirked at one side when Tony saw who’d joined him in the room. It was exactly the way Steve had always imagined Iron Man responding to his presence, if he ever did get to see who was behind the mask.
Happy obliged, regaling Tony with a full list of the adventures of trying to find a way to find the perfect gifts for Pepper, and how difficult it was to hide things from her. Tony offered to hide them in his secret lab, but Happy shook his head—half the fun of buying gifts for Pepper was the fun of concealing them from his wife. Tony could see where the appeal lay; Pepper had an extraordinary nose for digging out secrets. It was still somewhat of a surprise she hadn't figured out Iron Man's identity yet for herself. Tony would feel guilty about keeping it a secret from her if it wasn't safer for her not to know.
"Cap," Tony greeted, glad that his voice was holding steady. Steve was wearing his full uniform. It was always a pleasant view. "It's nice to see you. I hope you've had a good holiday season. Do take a seat."
when conversation edged too close to pain. "And I'm sorry she's not here right now, because she could fly this right up to the rafters for us."
"R&D called to remind you that they need authorization on some new equipment," Pepper said. "I promised that I'd remind you."
Iron Man wasn't moving. But was it because the pipes had pinned him, or because he couldn't move because he was—oh god please let him not be—
Tony was gearing up to be brave again, to open his eyes and beg Steve to abandon the tree, to come to his room, to take some of these impossibly good kisses to a soft surface. He was feeling feverish at the thought of that, Steve's heavy body pressing him to a mattress, holding him still, devouring him whole – when something external froze the moment solid.
Tony wanted to say a thousand things. Different scripts flooded through his head, all the possible dialogue options for this moment. He had a hundred different versions of this scene on the tip of his tongue. His glib professional persona wanted to say something witty. The part of him that had been a member of a strong team for so many years wanted to smooth over the atmosphere with something kind to push it under the rug. His anger wanted him to repulsor blast Steve in the chest and beg forgiveness later.
want this? Something was buzzing in the back of Tony's skull beyond the pleasurable sensations that were rippling through his body at being connected to Steve at this level, something about identity and honesty, but Steve's fingers were at the base of the Santa hat, grazing against the real hair beneath, and a frisson of pure bliss rocked through him, dislodging all thoughts that weren't
"Oh, Steve," Carol breathed. Her voice was unusually soft, kinder than Tony had heard it in a long time. She didn't know Tony was there, he supposed. "How long?"
"As I suspected," Strange said, suddenly appearing standing next to Tony's elbow. Tony looked from the slightly-translucent Strange next to him, to the one hovering mid-air and chanting under his breath, and back to the astral form of Strange.
His heart racing, Steve realized he must have cast it wandlessly, his anger at Tony unconsciously overriding control of his magic. Tony's robes were alight, and someone was hauling Steve backwards as Van Dyne cast
Jan's eyes narrow. "You mean Tony Stark has essentially invented a new kind of fabric and hasn't talked to me about it?"
Tony made a noise under his breath; he was pretty sure that Steve had known him long enough to understand that grunt as the combined affirmative and appreciative response it was. Tony refocused on scanning, logically moving around the tree in a clockwise motion, continuing his upward progress. It was easier as he rose, the circumference of the tree narrowing, the density of the branches lessening.
it. Until he heard the voice he expected from the impossibly brave man directly above him who was impaled twice and bleeding profusely.
Tony had a headache. It felt like he'd constantly had a low-grade headache for the last couple of weeks. When Steve was kissing him, he could forget about it, but as soon as Steve wasn't there, it was back, pressing against his temples, making his skull feel tense.
"Ooh," Jan's attention snaps back to the room and away from her mental costume designing. "Yeah, you should. That would be so much fun. You could actually dance with us and not have to worry about crushing our feet under your iron boots."
He's moving before he's even really thinking about it. Iron Man has always been one of his most favorite things about this decade and the more he thinks about him, the more Steve's blindsided by his feelings.
it shouldn't feel like he was touching a live wire with his bare fingers, but the noise Steve made when Tony ran his fingers over his scalp sounded like he was living and dying all at once.
Steve narrowed his eyes. "We're not supposed to tell," he said, in a firm voice, before smirking, "but if you had any idea what someone whose name rhymed with, say...
He would never be able to forget this moment. He would never be able to be anyone else's. Tony had pushed aside his feelings for Steve for so long, but he couldn't hold them back now. Couldn't think of anything else. Steve was here, kissing him. Steve, for some reason, inexplicably seemed to
I meant it,” Tony said, sounding surprised that Steve even had to ask, and it was that disbelief that made it easy, so easy, for Steve to lean forward. To put his hand carefully around Tony’s neck, to revel in how it felt for Tony to lean unconsciously into his fingers. Steve could snap Tony’s neck in an instant, they both knew that, and for him to be so pliant and trusting around Steve was a gift. Steve leaned in, telegraphing his intention with his movement; slow and deliberate. Tony’s eyes slid half-shut. Like this already felt good. Like this was already doing it for him.
Steve flashed him a cool, skeptical glance as he headed for the box of decorations that Tony was unwrapping, taking over the job of carefully peeling bubble wrap from the items packed within. "Um—should the question be how many times until you snapped and took scissors to it?"
"Hmm," Tony hummed under his breath. "You mean like a beloved colleague zooming off into the night with no note as to where he's gone or if he was ever intending to come back?"
"Okay," Steve said, slowly. It sounded like a lie too, but Tony was too exhausted to question it. Even clashing with Steve just this little amount felt like he was being hollowed out.
After Hill's lecture, and Hill's three weeks of detentions, Steve had vowed to himself to try and cool down on antagonizing anyone in Team Tony. Most of the other Gryffindors seemed to agree.
Tony smiles into their good morning kiss. Steve drifts into the bathroom still thinking about that kiss. When Steve emerges, bladder blessedly empty, he wraps his arms around Tony's waist as he mixes the batter, kissing his cheek.
"It's basically soft. You just pull it on, snap the connections, polarize it, and bam, it's solid." Iron Man actually shrugs this time. "It means I'm not exactly having to heave it on the subway."
Steve deserved to know the truth. Tony could tell him, right? It would be easy. There wasn't too much of a reason to hide it from him. And the idea of Steve smiling at him
It was a little insane. All Tony had to do was step back, and the others inside the training room would be able to see them. They'd
, and one of them made a noise, Tony wasn't sure which one of them it was, but he knew one thing – it didn't matter.
Steve inhaled sharply, like hearing those words out loud rattled him. "I wouldn't have put it like that."
Tony caves first after an hour of snuggling; his morning needs are always on a short delay to Steve's. It's only when the door closes that Steve realizes what he's done, opening Tony to a temptation that he shouldn't have to face in a place like this.
having to go through it too – it was unbearable. So when Tony had wandered into the potions lab, and seen Steve on the table, robes hiked up to his waist, Sharon kneeling between them… Steve let Tony think the worst.
be an alien corpse, hollowed out and stuck in the snow, arm outstretched like the Statue of Liberty gone wrong?
"Not really," Robbie lied, and then sagged. "Sorry, yeah, obviously there's something in particular, it's 5am and I'm willingly awake."
There's a really bad day: Steve wakes up with Tony in his arms, and it's just so nice he forgets his usual routine; he ignores the pressing need to pee in favor of how nice it feels to have Tony pressed up against him.
"Hmm," Iron Man says, "I can't see your ass from this angle very well. But I presume it's a nice one, or you wouldn't have bothered wearing an outfit involving tights."
"Am I reading this moment wrong?" Steve whispered, his spare hand moving up to Tony's head, fingers curling so gently around the back of Tony's neck. That touch sparked electricity through Tony's body too. Steve tilted his head, his eyes dropping unmistakably to Tony's lips.
“I don’t think I can.” Tony’s eyes looked glassy, unfocused. The gasping came even quicker now. “Steve, I don’t think I can.”
"You heard me." Steve tensed his lower jaw. He’d said it. He wasn’t going to take it back. Not when he'd spent months, thinking about it, over and over. How brave Iron Man was. How much he just wanted, all of the time, to celebrate that bravery. The mental bargains he made with himself at night, repeatedly, about what he'd do to keep Iron Man's secret, if it meant, come the end of a winning battle, that Steve could take him somewhere private and kiss him.
Iron Man makes a low humming noise, which is his usual equivalent of a shrug. "More like a tent. The armor isn't hard until it's polarized."
"Is is?" Tony blurted out the question louder than he meant to; he wrenched his gaze away from Steve, staring intently at the tree instead. There had been too much of
!" someone was yelling, near Steve, and Steve didn't understand, until he looked down at his hand – the wrist he'd jerked at Tony had been his wand-holding hand, and Tony – Tony was on
"You shouldn't give me anything," Steve said, surprising both Tony and Carol by the venom in his tone. Steve's face clenched weirdly and then he relaxed and shook his head a little. "I'm sorry. I'm just—I should have stayed behind and fought the Elves," Steve muttered. His eyes were locked on Tony's unconscious body. He looked miserable, but then, he was currently vocally beating himself up for making the wrong call on the battlefield. Steve was right; he
"Thor and Jen and Robbie are taking care of those elvish bastards," Carol interrupted him quickly. "Don't worry about that."
enough to be Steve. Tony took a deep breath, mentally rehearsing again his brief speech. Whatever it was, Tony could help Steve, he was sure.
Thinking about Steve's death, as temporary as it had been, was enough to clear Tony's head so he could brave company.
Tony blinked once, twice, slower than Steve was happy with. "Yes. Right. Yeah. Can you move either of your hands?"
Tony put a finger on his own mouth, dazed. He wanted to remember every second of it. His poor, damaged heart was
Jan blew out her cheeks and squinted at Tony's body speculatively for a long moment before leaning in and pressing a quick kiss against his cheek. Tony fancied he could feel it, just a little.
"You don't have to leave on my account," Steve said, putting his water down at the table, starting to pull a chair out right next to where Tony was still seated, somewhat frozen. Steve knew he was Iron Man. Just from his eyes and height and build? Did that mean Tony's identity was vulnerable now? Did Steve already know and was messing with him?
The longer it went on, the more obvious it was. One time, Tony blinked, and T'Challa entirely disappeared. Another, Robbie stepped right
The reporter was still staring at him doe-eyed, waiting for a response. Steve was still leaning against the wall, looking kind of annoyed that Tony was still messing around instead of leaving immediately.
Tony whistled under his teeth as he started to descend the ladder, because maybe Steve had a point. "That would be worse than a case of stache rash, that's for sure."
“Kiss you. Right now.” Steve stared at Tony. There wasn’t much else to stare at, other than the blood or the gray walls or his own eyelids. “Can I? I should insist that we not. I should say we should wait, so we have something to live for.” Everything felt cold. Oh, how Steve hated that. “But I don’t want to wait. If it’s… not unwanted. If it’s—” Our last chance, Steve swallowed back, just in time, but Tony’s expression shifted like he’d heard those words anyway.
"Doesn't look like he finished what he was doing," Jen said. "Ooh, that means we can help, right? Team bonding?"
Tony looked at him directly in the eye, the first time since Steve had come into the house to see him back here. "Yeah, I did. But it's okay if you don't get why."
Sam sidles up closer to Iron Man, glancing at him contemplatively. "Does that mean under the armor, you're that jacked?"
"I'm not pissed off she hit on you. I'd have to be pissed off every single day if that was the case. That sounds exhausting."
Tony glowers at him sourly, because sometimes the mask does have its benefits. "So what did you want to know? I presume you wanted insight to something in particular?"
"I heard what you said to Robbie," Steve murmured, keeping his voice carefully low. "That was sweet."
Steve pursed his lips. "Um… you to share your cookies with me?" His sad expression twisted into something more sly. "You're going to get enough of them left for you by all the chimneys you're due to drop down."
But Steve had said it. Two words that had crushed any hope Tony had that their relationship could ever be more than stolen kisses and nights spent together in secret:
By the time Tony had reached his destination, it was nearly dark, and he'd semi-convinced himself that Steve had an inoperable brain tumor. Tony rehearsed the speech he was going to make if that much was true.
Tony internally sagged. So much for Steve maybe dropping a hint now as to what he might have liked. How was Tony supposed to figure out what Steve wanted if even
"He's not dead," Robbie said, smiling waveringly at Steve as Tony still spluttered over that moment of horrific invasion. "I'd know. If anyone would know, I would."
Tony said something and Steve strained to piece the sounds together. “You should glue me back together.”
″Best I can do,″ Steve said when he was done, lowering himself back down with a wince. The squelching noise as he did so was not encouraging.
Steve frowns at Iron Man, his intent to stop the discussion wavering at the horrendous mental picture currently and vividly flashing through his mind. The armor failing, and Iron Man skewered on a villain's blade, soft material no protection against hard steel. "Is that possible?"
Tony’s knees felt weak, but he stood up.  It was either stand up or drag him to the ground right there.  He knew which he preferred, but tonight would be soon enough.  Steve was worth the wait.  “It’s a date, soldier.”
He had heard the tone before. She never really yelled at him, or got angry, but sometimes her voice would take on a firm tone, and when that happened, he gave in. Always. Every time. He nodded. “Okay. I’ll wake him up. Just give me a couple minutes, okay?”
--rub his temples with his fingers, slowly trying to let his eyes adjust to the change in the light.
Tony dropped his head down onto their clasped hands.  She removed one--gently--and ran it through his hair.  He let her pet him for a moment, reveling in the sheer comfort of it, then raised his head.  He tried to smile.
Tony responded to them all, basically just reiterating Steve’s original text, but the fact that it had the Stark seal of approval seemed to make it okay.  Tony couldn’t help but preen a little at that.
He knew. He knew them all. He could picture the guy who sang it, all chest hair and sexy-seventies mustache. Howard had owned that album. Weird to think about
?  Certainly more than him.  Certainly more than the man who had left him the second he didn’t get his own way.  Every time he thought of it, Tony filled with shame.  He’d left him.
Of course, there was no way Steve could keep it from Sam--not with his built-in bullshit detector wherever Steve was concerned. Nor could they keep it from Tony’s friends, Natasha and Clint, who were thrilled to abandon their usual lunch table and join Steve and Sam’s as soon as they found out Sam was taking some of the classes Tony had.
“Want that,” Steve said.  He put his free hand over Tony’s, moved it to his mouth, and kissed Tony’s palm.  “I don’t want that.  I’d do it if you want, Tony.  You know I would, but--”
--to kiss him, to touch him, to claim him boiling just under the surface of his skin. He’d held himself in check by sheer force of will, but he could feel that will crumbling. Could feel it shredding away, and he wanted it to. He wanted to be powerless around Tony. Wanted to just give in to every greedy desire burning in his brain. Wanted to be his subject and his ruler all at the same time.
He wanted to ask Bruce.  He so, so wanted to ask Bruce.  But Natasha had went on a mission, and he had taken the two weeks to go to Tibet.  He went there occasionally.  He said the atmosphere helped keep him calm.  He and the other guy were on pretty good terms lately.  This was one of their compromises.  Two weeks in Tibet at a monastery for Bruce, two weeks off-world with Thor for Hulk, where there were enough beasties and baddies to fight to make even
Steve let out a breath and rested his head against the seat back. His eyes were still on Tony. Now that he was looking at him, he couldn’t seem to look away. He reached out a hand and touched Tony’s where it sat on the gear-shift. Tony immediately grasped it and held it tight. “I’ll take a day,” Steve said. “If that’s what I get. I’ll take it.”
do.” He smiled again. “Of course, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t hope you both choose S.I., but you definitely do have a choice.”
Tony felt all the air leave his body.  Nat clamped her hand on his, giving him an anchor.  He held back tightly.  He looked past her shoulder at Steve.  Looked into his eyes, his blue, blue eyes.  “Steve?” he pleaded.
“‘Kay,” Steve said into his skin. His own arms crept around Tony’s waist and held on. “Good. ‘Cause I don’t want to.”
“Next time,” Steve echoed, and Tony must have heard something in his voice because he pulled back and looked into Steve’s eyes.
She gave him a mock-stern look, then ruffled his hair.  She turned to Tony and kissed his cheek.  “Glad you came, Tony.”
He wondered what Tony was doing right now. Wondered what he would do if he knew about Steve’s mom. The two of them were still friends. They spoke to each other. Tony had cared enough to send her a picture of his baby girl, and Sarah had cared enough to hang it on the wall along with the family pictures. That meant something. It meant something to Sarah, and that meant something to Steve.
Tony laughed and swatted him on the ass. “Get out of here,” he said, and Steve grinned. He kissed Tony one more time, then grabbed his jacket and left the room. “Bring me home some dinner!” Tony yelled after him.
. He’d ran through all the scenarios in his mind, rolling them over and over for hours. Even Steve had noticed how preoccupied he’d been. He’d asked him if he was feeling alright when he didn’t make a third cup of coffee that morning.
Tony looked at Steve’s face.  His eyes were closed, his bottom lip caught between his teeth, and if Tony had not already been completely in love with him he would have fallen hopelessly in that moment.
“Okay?” Tony asked, his hands roaming down Steve’s chest to his waist, then back up again. “You just said everything I was fucking
“No need to apologize, Captain Rogers,” Hunt said.  “Or thank me.  It was my great pleasure giving you that news.  Believe me.”
Steve wanted to deny it, but all of a sudden, it felt like he hadn’t. That he’d just been awake for nearly a decade, and it wouldn’t be long before he died himself. Before he just tumbled into that abyss that had followed him around since he was a kid. Sometimes it had been hidden from his view, but it was always there. Always. And today it felt closer than it had in a long time. Almost as close as that night in Chicago. That night he wished he’d had his pistol so he could put the barrel between his teeth. Taste the gun-oil. Feel the sight scraping against the roof of his mouth, then pull the trigger. Just pull the trigger.
“Well,” Tony said, “seeing as you’re so fine and dandy, I’ll just be on my way.  Seems like I have an artificial assistant to reprogram.”
Tony jerked his hand out of Natasha’s.  Anger and hurt battled inside him, vying for dominance.  It didn’t really matter which won.  It all came down to the same thing.
Sam furrowed his brow, but his lips twisted into a weary smile. One that Steve recognized from when they were kids. “
Steve began to drift again.  The good life must really take a lot out of a man.  He’d never slept so much or so well in his entire life.
Steve blinked, gazing up at him, then closed his eyes and rubbed them.  Actually rubbed them.  When they opened, they were as big, blue, and gorgeous as they’d ever been.
Steve turned on his side, rubbing his eyes.  It was dark.  It was always dark in the hole, and the light from the corridor stung.
“That sounds good,” Tony murmured, and lay back, pulling Steve on top of him. He ran his fingers through Steve’s blond hair, then fisted it in his fingers and pulled him closer, rising up a bit to meet his mouth.
Steve pushed the thought gently away and opened the door, steeling himself for a long, lonely night.  He’d left the bed tightly made this morning, but now the blankets were rumpled.  A bare shoulder and a lock of hair peeked out from beneath them.  Steve’s breath caught in his throat as she shifted then stilled again.
Those clouds in Steve's eyes broke.  The gray turned back to blue even as they filled with tears.  He smiled. "I love you so much."
Rhodey landed in front of him a moment later.  Nothing flashy about that landing, not like Tony’s.  His suit pulled itself away and turned into a carrying case.
“You don’t need to drive me the whole way,” Steve said. “You can just drop me off at the nearest bus station.”
Beside him, Bucky made an exaggerated show of clearing his throat, and Steve rolled his eyes again at Natasha. She laughed. “Nat,” Steve said, “this is Bucky. Bucky, Natasha.”
The couch was fairly low to the ground, and he slid on and off it with the ease of any man, impaired or not, doing the same task.  The bed, however, was higher, the table set at an awkward angle.  Tony had planned on asking Steve about it when they’d gotten here, having him try it out, then decide what he wanted done with the furniture to make it the most comfortable transition possible.  But when WWIII and the Great Living Room Decampment happened, it had become a moot point.  He wished now he had just moved the table out himself.
Steve lies back down on the bed and puts a pillow over his face, even though that doesn't help. He's come close to trying something like it. Day 159 is a day they'll never talk about again.
Iron Man had come towards him? And there'd been noise, and pain, and—oh. Steve was impaled, too, on one of the same pipes that was cleanly buried through Iron Man's body. They were skewered together. That was...interesting. Interesting. That's what Steve's art teacher had said when Steve had brought terrible art to class. If interesting had meant terrible this entire time, Steve was on board with it.
"Thanks, Pepper," Tony said. Maybe his voice was squeaking. She did shoot him an odd look before retreating from the office and closing the door.
Steve didn't even clamber off Tony's lap, though; he just casually turned to Hank with a blank expression. "Emergency?" Steve clarified.
Steve quirked a smile at that. "So that's why he was bitching a few years back about how to paint over scorch marks.”
and he was impaled on two long metal pipes that looked like they'd come loose from the walls from—had there been an explosion?
And worse, no one was even looking at him, even though Carol had run into the room, shouting for Thor.
"Has anyone ever told you how bossy you are?" Tony huffs, but he does turn and reluctantly shuffle into Steve's arms. For a moment, Tony's stiff, awkward with it, and then after a moment he relaxes into it, settling in close against Steve's broad chest, covered as it is with the familiar star and stripes.
"I just—that magic—whatever hit him—I could tell it was bad," Steve shook his head, his eyes still glued to Tony.
When Tony takes a day off, Steve doesn't complain anymore. He still counts the days, though, every single day, even the breaks. It's the only way to be sure all that time is real and not an illusion.
Steve didn't stop Tony, probably realizing it was useless to try, but he did continue to look dubious as he steadied the ladder.
"A name, a face, an identity—it changes things. It always changes things. Things like that—come with a reputation. With
"Yeah?" Robbie looked so hopeful at that, Tony couldn't bear to admit he'd just decided it was even happening.
″I'm okay,″ Tony breathed, his voice crackling. He was gasping for air at an increased rate, terribly betraying his own words.
Tony barked another of those rib-shocking laughs. ″You're a hazard, Rogers,″ Tony muttered, but with an undeniable fondness that just made Steve want to kiss him again. ″And you're wrong. The building wasn't ugly.″
. They were still cleaning up remnants of the War of the Realms, pockets of creatures that Malekith had conveniently "forgotten" to inform that the war was over. There was all the usual and ever-present strain of the ongoing threats – Starbrand, the Power Elite, the Supreme Squadron, the Russians.
"Oh, I totally get it. I'm onboard. No one needs to know we're… trialing an extended holiday celebration," Tony stumbled over the phrasing, but Steve nodded fervently, like Tony was doing a good job. "The
"Woah, you're right, it is soft," Jan says. She looks at the others, still squeezing at Iron Man's arm. "He really is as muscular as he looks. The fabric must just
There's something in the downturned slopes of Tony's shoulders that makes Steve heart ache in sympathy. "C'mon," he says, firmly. "I won't take no for an answer."
Tony stood up, rounded his table, and, buoyed by Steve's eyes so intently on him, he straddled Steve in the seat and smiled at him. He kept his motions slow and telegraphed his intent as best as he could. He meant to hold Steve close and keep him, as long as Steve would let him. Tony took one of Steve's hands in his own, the same electric feeling sliding between them even though Steve's hands were still in his gloves. Then Tony took his other hand and cupped it around Steve's neck.
Steve hates how miserable Tony sounds. He wants to wipe that sadness away, but he still can't find the right words. Some other words come out, though; it's like Steve's forgotten he's a big part of this dilemma, and it's someone else suggesting the solution to this problem. "Throw another masquerade ball and invite all the same people," Steve blurts.
"All the bugs squashed?" Steve asked, stepping back to gaze at the empty Christmas tree, his gaze narrowing like he could maybe spot one of Doom's nanotech creations with just his naked eye. If anyone could do it, Tony considered, it would probably be Steve Rogers.
Tony eyeballed Carol warily, waiting for her to look shocked, or ask for clarification, but instead, she just looked sadder. Like it wasn't really a surprise.
have to hurt all the time, now? Steve ground his teeth together. It wasn't fair. He just wanted Tony to be happy. Romance might make you feel gleeful for a while, but it always ended badly, so Steve had been
. He smiles ruefully. "This is probably the only time you'll ever surprise me," Tony warns him. "Make the most of it."
jealous of Doctor Strange, and Steve uses the jar of mustard they both hate to draw a target on the wall. Tony invents a ridiculous point system and more importantly, Steve
The reporter fluttered her eyelashes. "You free tonight, Mr. Stark? I could find space in my schedule for an off-the-record personal interview, if you get my drift?"
so,″ he said, fiercely. ″Are you going to tell me I'm wrong? I've heard it's unpatriotic to contradict Captain America.″
Tony swallowed in realization. "We can't be long in here, the others would talk," he said, slowly. He worried about what to say next; would
“Wanting to kiss me?” Tony’s eyes shuttered like he was trying to blink. Steve tried not to track the drop of sweat rolling down his nose.
He was volunteering to play Santa before he even really thought it through. Even after the hospital manager cried in gratitude and handed him the suit, and he had time to think it through as he pulled on the distinctive red-and-white clothing, Tony couldn't find it in himself to regret his impulsive yes. Tony had already done the most important part of his job, so the money part was sorted for another year. And it wasn't like people would even know it was Tony Stark inside the costume. He might not have had extensive experience pretending to be Santa Claus, but Tony did have copious experience of anonymously walking around in a red suit. It was nice to dive fully into being someone else for a short while.
Tony didn't kiss Steve goodbye when he left, because he figured it would be too difficult to leave if he did it again, and Tony had no other option left but to leave.
Steve moved his arm slowly, carefully, making sure not to jostle him. If he could peel up his uniform, tug out some of his undershirt, he could pack some of the cloth into Iron Man’s wound. It would hopefully slow the bleeding. He was reluctant, because wound-packing hurt like
, the way he's totally obsessed with Iron Man's thighs, and there's nothing shallow about the way he's feeling about Tony right now. He wants to kiss him again, yes, but he also wants to dance with him more, and spar with him, and take him to bed. There have been enough lies. Steve wants Tony for keeps and honesty is the only path that will take them there.
"Of course," Steve says, placidly, his mood settling when he realizes he can coach Tony later and help him with the task of hiding his identity. Because he's going to tell Tony the truth at the ball and everything will be great.
"But he was hot enough regardless, right?" Jan presses, while Steve is dying of mortification. He should leave, except maybe that would be incriminating?
you get me a cheeseboard for Christmas? I just—it didn't make sense. I wondered if I was missing a joke."
Tony took a step back. He had to. If he didn’t, there was no way in hell he would be able to walk out the door. He’d just drag Steve up to his room and get to the
“Mr. Stark,” Steve said, unable to keep the surprise and the hint of worry out of his voice. “What are you doing here?”
"Yeah.  He was proud of them--saving up the money for the bakery themselves instead of asking you for it--but you're right.  He wanted them home."
Something funny happened to me at work last night.  I work at a meat counter in a grocery store and it is all open so I can help customers with purchases.  I was doing dishes on the back wall, and when I turned around, a woman was standing there.  She's a regular customer and really friendly, but I don't know her other than from the store.  I came over and got her what she needed, then told her I was sorry about the wait and next time she can just yell at me if my back is turned.  She laughed and said, "Yeah, I'll just yell 'Hey, you!"
Tony groaned, suddenly overwhelmed with a feeling of dumb gratitude toward the arrogant prick he actually really did dislike.  It was an uneasy cocktail, but he’d ordered it.  He had to drink it.
“That’s okay,” Tony said, and pet the back of his neck. “You don’t have to. That’s okay. Everything’s okay.”
Tony tipped his head in a considering way. “Well,” he conceded reluctantly, “to be fair, I probably should have taken a little better care of
Bucky stepped out of the dim to Tony’s right.  It was not one of the darker points Tony had seen.  In fact, he seemed to have simply materialized out of thin air.  Maybe he really
Steve went down the short hallway and came back a moment later with a folded sheet and a thick comforter. They were both white and cozy-looking. He flipped a t-shirt over Tony’s shoulder. “Here,” he said. “You can get her dressed in the bathroom. I’ll make the bed up.”
,” he emphasized. “God. Steve. No. That was-” He stopped, and ran his hand through Steve’s hair again. It was still for comfort, but this time, he was comforting himself. He thought he could get used to that. Touching Steve to make himself feel better. Drawing solace just from the feel of him, the solid, dependable
They went out and got into Tony’s car. It wasn’t the same car, but it felt the same having Steve sitting beside him. So much the same, that he almost reached out and took his hand. He didn’t. He caught himself at the last second. But, it felt strange
Natasha came next, then Clint, and the pair curled up together on the same chair, Clint’s head on her shoulder, Nat’s arm curled protectively around him.  Scott came in next and perched on the counter with a cup of coffee.  Nebula followed and sat at the table, her black eyes moving restlessly.  They only settled when Tony and Rhodey came into the room.  Tony sat next to her and nodded in response to her silent questions.  She squeezed his wrist with fingers made from Tony’s own nanotech and relaxed.  A little.
Tony was standing by his locker when Steve came around the corner, just like he said he would be. Steve hadn’t been one hundred percent positive he would be, but there he was, looking as pretty as Steve had ever seen anyone look, his hair falling over his brow, his leg bent and propped against the lockers, his head down, headphones in his ears. Steve lingered a little way down the hall, his heart jogging a bit in his chest. He stood still, not wanting to disturb the picture Tony made, wanting to remember the way he looked right now, wanting to always remember, just in case things didn’t turn out the way he wanted. Just in case he only had a year with him. Or six months. Or six weeks. Or six days. He just wanted to remember the way he looked right now.
Sam shook his head.  “No.  He wouldn’t like that.”  He drank some of his beer.  “Why not The Raft?  Isn’t that Ross’ thing?”
Tony cocked his head.  “I might have over-shot with the betrayal stuff,” he admitted.  “I was just mad.”
“It’s alright,” Steve said without missing a beat, and Tony wrapped his hands lightly around his throat, shaking him the slightest bit.
Tony saw. Saw and understood. “Come on,” he said briskly, putting his hand on Steve’s arm. “Let’s go to my office. ‘Kay?” Steve didn’t answer. Didn’t even try. Tony was holding his arm. He just focused on that. “Karen, no calls, please,” he said over his shoulder as he steered Steve away.
Steve’s eyes hadn’t left his drawing during the entire conversation, but now they rolled heavenward.  “I didn’t deserve it then, Tony,” he said.
He hated thinking like that.  Hated thinking he was too vulnerable for Steve and too reckless for Pepper.
Sam grasped his arm and Tony drew his eyes back to his. They were still soft, but there was a stern edge to them too. “Make up with him,” Sam said. “Or at least make friends again. If something
“What then? It’s not like it used to be. No one would care.” She spoke in a gentle but firm way that made him feel very good. He’d called her a friend for a while now, and right now it really felt true. But she was wrong.
"No," Steve said.  "Turns out, there's no real cure for aging.  She said she could put me in cryo, but what would be the point?  Unless she put us both under."
Steve’s head snapped to the side, snapped to the sound of Tony’s voice like it was a siren-song on the open sea. He straightened his back unconsciously, standing taller, shoulders back, not noticing the way Sam rolled his eyes, smiling a little, and rubbed his temples.
each other. It just wasn’t working. Not like it should for two people who are married to each other. It just wasn’t working.
“They do if they’re tired,” she said.  “If they don’t want to run anymore.  If they want to just get it over and done with once and for all so they can...settle down somewhere.  When they get out.  Maybe put some roots down.”
Tony raised his head, looking into Steve’s eyes. They were the same. Steve loved how much they were the same. Even with the tiny crinkles that resided at the corners now, or maybe because of them. Yeah.
Steve chuckled and the sound sent shivers down Tony’s spine.  It always did, that soft, throaty laugh that he only used here, when they were lying in bed together, and it was like Pavlov’s dogs: Tony started to get hard.
outright, even though, in his head, that had been his immediate response. “I don’t know, Steve,” he said reluctantly. “In case you don’t remember, our last parental meet-and-greet did
Steve looked at him from under lowered lashes, smiling again.  “Well, we don’t know each other that well.”
Steve ran his hand through his hair, pulling it between his fingers. It was hot in here. With Thad pressed up against his back, his arms around him, his mouth now working over his shoulder and neck, kissing, biting, sucking, leaving marks and bruises, it was hot. Too hot. His skin felt tight, sticky with sweat and Thad’s come. It had never bothered him before. And it had only been an hour. There were nights when he laid there for three, four, sometimes five hours in the same state, and it didn’t bother him. Only an hour tonight. An hour lying in bed, his arm over his eyes, listening to Thad get up, shower, change, call his wife, go into the kitchen, eat an apple--Steve’s stomach grumbled a little while he listened. They hadn’t eaten dinner. Just went straight to the bedroom. The only thing he’d had in his mouth tonight was Thad’s cock--listening to the water turn on, fill a glass, then clunk down onto the countertop. Then Thad came back into the bedroom and got into bed. An hour. Only an hour.
it--but he touched Tony’s hand where it sat on the console between them. Touched the long fingers. Brushed his own along them. He ducked his head, shy now in a way he hadn’t been in months. “Will you love me forever, Tony?” he asked, looking at him from under his lashes, needing to hear the answer, but afraid of it all the same.
“Try explaining that to his wife,” Tony shouted, throwing his hand backward to where Jen was currently dancing with Sam.
Steve dropped his paperwork in his room and changed.  It was getting late, and he knew he should try and rest, but he was too wired to sleep yet.  He didn’t know if that was because of the coming battle, the serum, or the residual aftershocks of touching Stormbreaker, but whatever the reason, he knew he’d never sleep now.
currently taking up real estate in his head. He could almost feel it in there, slipping around the corners of his mind like a snake through the tall grass, and he wanted to try and get it out. He didn’t want to take it back to the Tower with him.
They were having coffee.  Just the two of them in a diner near her apartment.  Tony dumped sugar into his cup and stirred.  “I don’t know.  I don’t think so.”
“I’m glad,” Tony murmured, and ran his hand from Steve’s waist, up his back, to his neck, and caressed it with his thumb. Steve closed his eyes and clasped his own arms around the one Tony still had wrapped around his waist. They stood there like that, holding each other, and Tony was struck with the certainty that it should just be now. It was going to happen right now.
Steve shifted, squeezed him tightly, and bent his head to kiss the back of Tony’s neck.  “Will I get to come home soon?” he asked, and Tony said “Yes,” with no hesitation.
Steve subsided into nervous silence again.  He counted to one hundred.  Three times.  When he could stand it no longer, he said, “Come on, Tony.  You’ve read it ten times.  What do you think?”
Steve asked Tony if he wanted to go with him to his next appointment with Doctor Strange.  Tony agreed immediately.
Tony considered, then shrugged.  “Shit.  I don’t know.  I have no clue what normal relationship stuff is.”
“It’ll be okay,” Steve said. “You’ll be okay.” But he didn’t look at him. He couldn’t. He bowed his head and looked at Tony’s hands instead. Saw the way they lay on his own knees. So perfect. So pretty. So finely-made. He wanted to hold them again. Kiss them. Run his lips over the pads of the fingers, trace the lines of the palms with his tongue. He shook his head minutely. No. No. Stop thinking about it. He couldn’t do it. He could never do it again.
“I don’t have a guest room,” he said. “Sorry. But the couch is comfortable. I’ve slept on it a few times.”
Tony swallowed past the lump that had suddenly found its way into his throat.  God, was it old age or heartbreak that was making him lose his edge?  Whichever it was, could go fuck itself.
. There was a sofa. A coffee table. A chair. There was a lamp in the corner. A bookcase filled with paperbacks. An armoire that may or may not house a television. A
I said bowling team, okay?  I bowl.  I am a bowler.  And I’ll tell you something else, I’m a damn good one, too.  I bowl a 240 now.”
“Come on, troublemaker,” he whispered, and Dodger hopped down from the bed and followed him out the door.
Howard took a step toward him. Tony stood his ground. He wasn’t afraid of his father, he never had been, and if he was being truthful--really, honest-to-god truthful--the times Howard stepped menacingly toward him were some of his
“Ye-ess?” the kid drawled, and then glanced over his shoulder, looking deeper into the apartment. When he looked back, the smile had gotten a little less wicked, but was still very much there. “Hold that thought,” he said quietly, and then the door opened wider.
it had my security!”--Steve still found himself looking for them, checking their whereabouts, tracking their movements throughout the room. Clint lounged in the corner, his feet up on the table. Beside him, Laura bounced a baby on her knee, her pretty face alight and dazzled by the room around her. Rhodey stood nearby with a trio of ladies in low-cut dresses, a drink in his hand. Natasha was MIA for the moment and Sam had an emergency with one of his friends at the VA so he couldn’t make it to the party. On the dancefloor, Wanda and Vision twirled in a technically perfect but somewhat uninspired waltz. Steve smiled as Wanda grabbed Vision’s shoulders and gave them a brisk shake before placing his hands on her waist. The implications were clear: loosen up, you, and just dance.
It was after midnight when he finally made his way upstairs.  The floor was dark with only the city lights to illuminate the room.  He did not stop to admire the view.  His head hurt.  His hand hurt.  Looking out at the city would not help either of those things.  It would, in fact, make them worse.  Since the snap, there were fewer lights.  Even the brightest city in the world had dimmed.  Everything had.
Then he felt a tug on his sleeve. He opened his eyes and Tony’s were there, right in front of him, looking hurt but hopeful. “Hey,” Tony said, and his fingers didn’t move from where they were curled into Steve’s jacket, so close to his own hand, he could feel the warmth of his body heat. “Come on. Let’s not do this, okay? None of this has to matter, does it?”
Steve said nothing, just held Tony tighter, frowning into his skin. Tony must have felt the tension in his muscles, though, because he reached back and rubbed Steve’s hip with one hand in a soothing, gentle motion. “That was a joke, Steve,” he said. “Laugh at it.”
Hunt’s lips twitched.  If Steve didn’t know better, he would have thought he was hiding a smile.  “Yes, you did, Captain.  But I meant, do you know why you’re standing here in this office, right now?”
what he was thinking. He felt fear, and pressure, and a sharp, piercing loneliness that he just couldn’t shake. Sam was here, and he could not be more grateful, but when it came right down to it, without his mother, he was alone. All alone. He had no one but her. No one. And if something happened to her--when she died, hopefully, far far in the future--he would be alone for real.
scaring is Bucky, and I don’t know if it’s because you’re basically the same person, or if you just put on a better show for him.”
And that had been it. But now, as Steve led him inside by the hand, Tony wondered why the hell he hadn’t come down here and checked it out for himself.
“No, you were right.”  Steve adjusted his sweater, looked for his cane, and made his slow way over to it.  “I shouldn’t have come here.  I knew it was a mistake.”  His eyes had lost that cold, hard shine.  Now he just looked lost.  “I just--when I saw you this afternoon, I remembered how good it was between us.  For awhile, you know.  At home.  And I guess I just wanted to feel that again before--” he stopped.  Bent down and picked up his cane.  “It was selfish of me,” he said.  “I’m sorry, Tony.  Really.  For everything.  I really did never want to hurt you.”
They were speaking quietly, but he could hear them. He couldn’t quite make out what they were saying, and did it even really matter? He was warm. Comfortable. He could smell coffee. And the voices were soft and familiar. He wasn’t one hundred percent sure who they belonged to, but he knew he knew them. Knew they were important. Knew they were safe. Knew
“Don’t worry, Tony,” Rhodey said, slapping him on the back.  “I used my override.  I’ll give her back when you feel better.”
Steve smiled--that sweet, brilliant smile--and leaned slightly forward. Tony sighed and narrowed his eyes. Then he kissed him. He acted like it was with a great reluctance.
Howard smiled. On the surface, it seemed charming. “As far as Tony knows, there is no ‘but’. As far as Tony knows, that’s the end of the story.”
“Good,” Tony said, and reached out to grasp a fold of Steve’s shirtsleeve. “Then there’s nothing keeping you from asking me out.” He shook Steve’s arm a little. “Right?”
Tony squatted down on his haunches in front of him. “Hey,” he said quietly. He reached out, and Steve flinched.
“It’s not sappy.  It’s that ‘normal’ stuff we talked about before.”  She gave him a stern look.  It reminded him forcefully of the ones Rhodey sometimes gave him.  “But, now I definitely need to say what I was going to say.”
Steve’s fingers moved over Tony’s hand again.  He traced the blue veins, ran over the knuckles, delved into the heat of his palm.  “Are you sure?” he asked.  “After what happened before?”
Steve didn’t think that was actually true. His father’s death had been an accident caused by a winding road and a drunk driver, but he understood why she had said it. And he understood other stuff too...But he didn’t have to think about it if he didn’t want to.
He leaned forward.  She touched it gingerly.  “Doesn’t feel broken,” she said, and wiped some of the blood away.
Steve sat that way with Tony’s hand in his, just taking it in, marking it, and over the years that followed, after the Sokovia Accords, after Berlin, after Bucky and Siberia, when he and the rest of the Rogues went on the run, he would sometimes think about the way Tony’s hand had felt in his.  He would think about the tiny, brave heat that lived between their palms.  He would think about it and wonder, if he could undo everything that had happened, just erase it all so he could feel that touch again for real, even for one moment, if he would do that.
--toward him. Toward his friend. Toward James “Bucky” Barnes, where he lay screaming in the middle of the road.
Tony clenched his hand into a gentle fist, catching Steve’s gold hair within it. “And what did he say?”
He almost pressed ‘send’ on that one, but in the end, he didn’t. In the end, he just took a deep breath, and typed:
Steve looked down at his hands. They were long-fingered. Finely-made. Strong. He’d been looking at them his entire life. Watched them grow and change over the years, just like the rest of his body. He’d seen them holding pencils, pens, paintbrushes. Seen them folding laundry, and washing dishes. Seen them held inside his mother’s hands. Seen them caress the silken skin of Tony’s stomach. Funny, he’d never thought about them holding a gun before. Never thought of them as a
Tony rubbed his eyes again.  “I do.  But there’s more room in the garage.  I’ll be able to pull it up larger and give you a better overall visual.”
He was wearing old, faded jeans that hung dangerously low on his hips, and a t-shirt splattered with tiny droplets of paint. He was barefoot, of course, his toes curling a little on the drop-cloth he’d thrown on the floor. His hair fell over his brow. He had a brush stuck behind his ear. Tony had seen him concentrate before. Of course, he had. But never to this degree. His eyes bored like lasers into the canvas, his jaw clenched, his hands, steady and firm, not shaking, not quivering, barely even moving, just enough to add a touch of red here, the faintest blush of yellow there.
Tony sang along to the raspy voice coming through the speakers.  AC/DC.  One of his favorites.  He was concentrating only on the work in front of him.  Upgrades for Rhodey’s suit, and wasn’t
A few days later, Steve had come home from school and shopping, his arms filled with books and bags and pizza because he had another essay to write by Monday, and Tony had kept him up until four a.m. that morning doing things to him that were unspeakably dirty and unspeakably good, and now he was exhausted, and his outline was due tomorrow, and he wasn’t even halfway through it, and...and now there was a big yellow cat sitting on the kitchen counter staring at him with flat, green eyes.
That night, Tony replayed it in his head, except he pretended that Jarvis was his father and was married to his mother, and after Maria put the horse away, they all went into the cabin and had dinner together.  And there was no fighting.  No crying.  No long silences filled with only the sound of cutlery squealing against the plates.  No worry that at any moment his father would get angry, because
Steve nodded with an internal sigh--why couldn’t Tony just hire the same guys every time? “I’m okay,” he said. “And I’m not driving, so, again, please?”
“So I would do stuff.  All the stuff I did.  All the stuff I forgot.  They pumped me full of Baxter’s drugs then flashed that light, and I...I was gone.  I got lost.  I couldn’t find myself anymore, Tony.  I couldn’t...I couldn’t find you a lot of the time.”
Steve stood up.  He’d been waiting for this.  Since he’d walked through those lobby doors, he’d been waiting.  There was a meeting.  Tony would be there.  He’d be there.  They had to meet eventually.  It might as well be in the 60th floor conference room.  At least it was neutral ground.
“Because look at him.” he said, and now he looked over his own shoulder at Steve. His face softened when he did into something gentle and filled with the love of a brother. “Look at the kind of man he is. Strong. Decent.
He looked out the window at the gray sky. It may have lightened a little, but his mood didn’t. “How can you tell?” he muttered, and threw himself onto the couch. He knew he was being childish. He
Next chapter in a couple days. I think there will be nine. I'm writing chapter 8 right now.  I may post 8 and 9 on the same day.  Just 'cause, why wait, right? Why prolong this thing any longer than we have to😊!
Tony reached out and scratched behind Sir Purr’s ear.  The cat turned his head into it.  The purring intensified.  “Glad you two are getting along,” Tony said.
Watching the two of them together reminded Steve so much of he and Bucky that his heart broke all over again.  If Thanos was coming--and he was--then this might really be the last night on Earth for some of them.  It wasn’t just Tony and himself that was going through this, it was all of them, all of them that were left, Rhodey included.  Steve felt a flush of shame.  He’d been selfish.  Seeing Rhodey and Tony huddled together made him realize just how much.
“I won’t touch you,” Steve said. “Not...not like that. I-” He ran a hand through his hair, and when he spoke again, his voice was shaky with exhaustion and emotion. “I’m just so tired. It’s been such a long week. I-I just want to be close to you. I just want to-” he touched Tony’s shoulder, “I just want to listen to you breathe. Okay? Is that okay?”
Sam had told him once that meetings helped.  People with shared experiences talking out their feelings helped.  Fear.  Denial.  Survivor’s guilt.  He sat in on a few a week--there was no shortage of them, not now--and listened while person after person told different versions of the same story.
Tony waited for that voice inside his head to speak up, to tell him what to do, but it was silent.  He was on his own here.  Just him.  Just Tony Stark.  Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.  Only child of a murdered couple.
Sarah patted Steve’s back. “I’ll go tell Tony to get another plate,” she said, pulled him gently down to kiss his cheek, then left.
“Come again,” the salesman said dismissively, and as Tony left, he saw him sweeping the gorgeous vintage watch back into the case. He felt a little pang. He would have bought it for himself if the guy hadn’t acted like such an asshole.
“Dugan-” he began, then coughed, almost gagging as the breeze blew toward him, bringing with it the hot scent of explosives and charred...something. Something like meat on a barbecue. He gagged again, his stomach roiling, and his hand slipped in something. Something that looked like Cadmium Red straight out of the tube. Or maybe good old Stoplight Red mixed with a little blue. Just enough blue to make it look realistic on the canvas. To make it look exactly like what this was for real. “Dugan, report! Jones! Bucky!”
“Tell me,” Tony said as he slipped his hand inside Steve’s pants.  They were elastic-waist, prison-issue pajama pants.  Such easy access.  Uncle Sam wanted Steve to get off almost as much as Tony did, it seemed.  Steve moaned as Tony wrapped his fingers around his cock and stroked.  “That wasn’t words, baby,” he chided and kissed his neck again.  “Talk to me.  Tell me what it was.  Was it something about Ross?”
Tony shuddered, scrubbing a hand over his face.  He didn’t need this.  This was not the kind of thing a person should be thinking about on a sunny early-October afternoon.  He needed Steve.  He needed his relaxing ways, his steadying company, his calm eyes, his secure, strong arms.  For a moment, he thought he was being selfish, then the image of a thin, frightened Steve biting the sensitive skin of his wrist--skin Tony had kissed so lovingly--flashed in his head, and he thought maybe Steve needed him too.
“We were talking about Christmas yesterday,” he said.  “He couldn’t remember how they used to celebrate it.”  He looked at Sam a trifle defensively.  “But it was ninety years ago!  He’s
“It might be.  But don’t tell Steve.  I don’t want him getting upset if it turns out to be nothing.”
He looked exhausted. And angry. His mouth turned down in a pout. His eyebrows drawn inward in a tight scowl. His hair stuck up in bed-head spikes. The night before, he’d been wearing a leather jacket and jeans, but now he was wearing loose sleep pants that hung low on slim hips, and a t-shirt that had been slashed in half to show off a toned stomach. He looked perfect, not a blemish on him--at least not on the parts Steve could see--and he could see a lot. See how even though he was upset, his lips were red and finely-made. His eyes were dark and intense. His skin was smooth, almost poreless, like olive-hued porcelain, and that made sense because Steve could see something else too: he
Since it's Thanksgiving here in the States, I just wanted to take two seconds to say thank you again to everyone reading this!  I had a pretty rough year, and writing these six silly little stories was one of the few things that really kept me going.  Now, sharing them with you lovely people has made it all the more worthwhile.  Thank you so much!  Here we go...
Sam’s voice was laced with concern, but it was firm.  “Sorry, Tony, but did you?  He came over here today, and there’s something wrong.”
She blotted the rest of the blood away, then leaned back.  “Good as new,” she said, and a grief-laced arrow pierced his heart.
He slept for seven hours and awoke to the sunlight streaming through the window.  The storm was over, but it was cold, so very, very cold.
“Nope,” Tony said, and pulled Steve forward until he stood between Tony’s parted knees. Water sloshed up over Tony’s calves as he tightened his knees against Steve’s hips. “Not even one time.”
“Fine. Whatever.” Pepper was silent, and then he felt like shit. “Hey. Pep. Hey. I’m sorry.” He rubbed his eyes. His forehead. His head was starting to thump. “I’m a prick. I’m sorry, honey.”
Steve ducked his head to give him that innocent, evil look Tony never wanted to go without again. “You could just cuddle me a little.”
Tony held him as tightly as he could, his arms around his neck. “Come home to me,” he said. “I’m serious, Steve. I want to be with you. I love you.”
“Close enough,” he said. “Mine’s really Anthony. Three syllables.” They were still standing in the doorway of Steve’s apartment. He hadn’t invited Tony in. His work-station was pretty standard looking. They made sure of it when setting it up, just in case something like this occurred, and it was in the second bedroom with the door closed, away from prying eyes, but Steve still wasn’t sure it was prudent to let Tony into his space. For various reasons. Even though Tony kept glancing inside.
Bruce stayed behind.  “Steve?” he said quietly, putting his glasses back on.  His voice was calm, soothing.  “Steve, hey, let’s go inside, alright?”
Steve opened his eyes finally. “Yeah,” he said. “Lucky.” He turned a little, trying to smile. Trying really hard. But he couldn’t do it. Not after the night he’d had. Not after the history that hung between them. “Hi, Tony.”
He was sitting in the bathtub, knees hugged to his chest, his chin resting on them. His face was turned toward the door, but his eyes were downcast. Looking at the floor. Seeing him like that hurt Tony’s heart in a way nothing ever had. Nothing, that was, except for the other times he had seen Steve looking small and wounded.
Tony nodded, and now his grip was painful, extreme to the point of panic. He dropped his eyes, but Steve could see his jaw working, the muscle contracting with barely-checked emotion. “And I need you to tell me-” he stopped, breathed in, then exhaled jerkily, his eyes finally jumping back to Steve’s own, blazing. “I need you to tell me you’re
He watched as Steve was guided away.  As the sheriff opened the back door of his cruiser.  Ross stood off to one side.  He looked rather pleased with the whole situation, watching the show like it was a tent-pole movie premiere and he was the star.
Nat touched his shoulder, drawing his eyes back to her face. “You saw Tony?” she said, nodding in his direction.
“Well,” Tony said, taking his hand.  “I did a lot of tossing and turning on this bed while you were gone.  Maybe I broke it in a little.”
“Tony, can you please just try and understand? I’m sorry. I really am. But, what am I supposed to do? Carlos broke his wrist. Do you want me to tell him he has to try and bus tables with a broken wrist just so we can go out to dinner? I can’t do that.”
Tony sighed, his eyes straying to the photo on the nightstand.  Mrs. Ross laughing, Thaddeus smiling into her neck.  “I don’t want to think you’re an evil guy, Thad,” he said softly.  “But your priorities are fucked up and your vision is skewed.”
There was a weight on him now.  It wasn't much, just a little thing--a hand in his hair?--but it was there, and it was warm.  Good. So very, very good.
They stood in line and loaded their trays with food, then went to Steve and Sam’s usual table. Tony slid in easily beside Steve, edging a bit closer than perhaps was necessary, still lost in conversation with Sam.
Steve met them on the street. Howard stood near the car, watching, while the two boys stood facing each other, their hands shoved in their pockets, looking at the ground. The boy, the little blond boy, dug his toe into the ground. It looked like he was drawing something with his shoe, and Howard shook his head again, wondering just what in the
Steve moved forward instead of speaking, and took Tony in his arms.  He kissed him.  It was hard, determined, rough in a way Steve rarely was, but it was still undeniably
He shook his head.  The thought of that sex dungeon was still in his head.  “Uh, no.  No, thanks.  I’ll see you later.”
mean he was sad or secretly relieved that Tony wouldn’t be there? Was that a genuine frowny-face? Or did Steve just put it in there for show? And that ellipsis...What the hell? Who put an ellipsis at the end of a text? Was Steve trying to fuck with him? What did that
He breathed deep, and under the smells of concrete and exhaust and hot tar was the scent of cherry blossoms.  The scent of summer right around the corner.  Steve filled his lungs full of it.  When he exhaled, he pushed the air of the prison out.  The scent was still in his pores, but it would go away soon enough.
Tony laughed. It sounded startled but carefree. And like the best thing Steve had heard in two months. “‘Couple bucks’, huh?” he said.
Steve turned on his stool, and there he was. Those bad, dark eyes. That mouth curved into half a smile. Steve’s heart lurched in his chest, but his brain was quiet, like it had been expecting this from the moment his feet had dragged the rest of his body in here, and the quiet was nice. He’d lost the knack for being quiet too. It felt good having it back for a minute.
“Me too, baby,” Tony said, then let out a long breath. “I’ve missed you. Missed us. I wish we had…” He trailed off and exhaled again.
made him jealous. He didn’t want to be jealous. He didn’t. All of a sudden, he just wanted to drink his beer in peace and then go home. His mom was at work tonight, but he could just go to bed. The same bed. The same bed he and Tony had shared so often.
“It’s relaxing,” Steve said.  His voice was soft, mellow, like molasses.  He looked at the cigarette again, took another long drag, and breathed out a plume of smoke.  “I don’t know if it’s the nicotine, or the repetitive motions.  Or maybe it’s just the deep breathing.”  He shrugged, just a slow lift of his shoulders, then chuckled a little in the darkness.  “It’s kind of like yoga.”
“What’s going on?” Clint asked.  His voice was amused, but Tony saw how he moved between Tony and the other guy, his casual grace belying the coiled tension in his muscles.  He was ready, if it came to it.  Tony resolved to buy him something pretty when this was over.
“Are you sure?” he teased, putting his fingers back to work, letting them trace Steve’s full mouth again, letting one of them breach his lips, then slipping back out before Steve could do more than tongue at the pad. “I mean, I can go out and get laid by somebody else first, real quick, if you want.” He arched an eyebrow. “You
Steve laughed shortly.  “Stop it,” he breathed.  “Stop doing that.  That’s what I’m talking about.  You’re too good for me.”
Tony reached out and brushed a hand over Steve’s shoulder. The suit was perfect, not a wrinkle or spot in sight, but Tony could pretend. He needed some kind of excuse, a reason to touch him. When he did, he was miraculously able to breathe again. Like all his body had been waiting for was that contact. That touch. “Look at you,” he whispered, then cocked an eyebrow, gazing up into Steve’s blue, blue eyes. “I guess I can look now, anyway,” he said. “You seem to be fully clothed this time.”
Sam kept his hand on his shoulder, moving his thumb in small soothing arcs.  “You might have.  What do you remember?”
Tony squatted easily and ran his hand through the grass.  A light drizzle was falling and it was damp under his fingers.  It had been damp before too, but that time it had been damp with Steve’s blood.  This was just the rain.
Because he wanted that, too.  He wanted Tony to feel the same pride he felt.  He wanted to prove that Tony had done the right thing when he chose him, and if he’d done it Wanda’s way, it would not have been true.
They were still huddled together when the alarm went off at six. Tony groaned and rolled onto his stomach away from the sound, and Steve shut it hurriedly off. He could usually catch it before it went off and woke Tony up, but he had been too comfortable. Too warm and snuggly this morning.
“You could have called me,” Steve said quietly. “I wouldn’t have turned down a call from you, Tony. Not now. Maybe at the start. But not now.”
"What happened to him?" Steve asked, feeling even more stupid that had to ask such a basic question when everyone else seemed to know.
Tony knew he was just waiting for a reason to do it. He hadn’t wanted Tony in public school, at all. Maria had set it up last time before she died, and this time, Tony, himself, had insisted. He didn’t want to go to private school. He
Steve shook his head.  “Goddamnit, Tony,” he muttered.  “I deliberately didn’t make anything because you said you’d bring dinner.”
“There you are,” she said, and there was a sweet relief to her voice that made everything inside him start to loosen.
Then Tony was gone.  He jerked out of Steve’s hand and blundered a few steps away.  He stood, facing away, his hands on his hips, his head thrown back.  He was the very image of a desperate man trying to regain control.  Steve only heard the harsh, “Anything I want?
Steve let out a harsh breath as he pulled himself further onto the bed.  His biceps bulged impressively.  Tony gave up all pretense of not looking and turned his head, watching his progress intently.  Steve lifted his right leg onto the bed, only using his hands a little, then hauled his left into place, settling it beside its mate.  He rested his head against the headboard, eyes closed, fists loosely clenched, breathing in and out.
Tony came to him and dropped to his knees in front of him. He gripped Steve’s hands tightly. So tightly Steve could feel the bones in his fingers grinding together, but he didn’t mind. This would probably be the last time Tony ever touched him. He wanted to feel it. He wanted to feel every little thing about it. “Baby,” Tony pleaded. “What are you talking about?”
. Somehow, he swung his legs into the tub and settled them at Steve’s side. He leaned back against the porcelain and lay his head back, giving Steve a weak thumbs-up. “See?” he said without looking at him, “Told you I could do it.”
Steve put his head on her shoulder. He felt her hands lace together behind his back. It was familiar, that feeling. It was one of his favorite feelings. “Okay, Mom,” he said.
, and he loved it. He loved it, and he hated it, because as pure as it was, he wanted the words too. He wanted the promises. He wanted everything.
Steve came down to the shop later. He had his laptop under his arm, a stack of books in his hands with a bowl of sliced fruit balanced on top.
They pulled up in front of Nat and Sam’s building fifteen minutes later. They got out, and Steve blipped the horn once as he drove away.
were here.  They were together.  Steve was looking at him and being his sweet self, love shining out of his eyes like concentrated starlight, all directed at Tony.  He wondered--again--how in the name of
“Then that’s what I’ll give you,” he said, and kissed him deeply. He pulled away long enough to get rid of the rest of his own clothing, then kissed Steve again. First his mouth, then his cheek, his ear. “Turn over,” he whispered, and Steve rolled obediently onto his stomach.
Tony closed his eyes. That lump in his throat from earlier was back again, and it seemed to have grown considerably.
Steve shifted on his bed. He was suddenly very aware that he was only wearing a towel. That he had really only been with three people in his entire life. That it had been a
Steve let three people use his phone. He smoked while he waited, trying to think of some way to call Tony and tell him he’d be late without actually
Tony laid his hand on Steve’s stomach while he worked his mouth up and down his length. He could feel the tension in his muscles, how tightly coiled they were beneath his palm. He could feel the way they jumped and twitched involuntarily, punctuated by the sounds of Steve’s low moans. It was mesmerizing. The thought that with all the fantasies he’d had about him and Steve together, he had never even conceived of this. He'd imagined the broad strokes--had
Bruce wrung his hands, but he laughed a little too. Tony joined him. “PDA is not necessary,” Bruce said. “Some things should be kept private.”
Tony glanced back at him, then looked back at the photograph hanging on the wall. Hanging there with the pictures of Steve, and Sam, and Steve’s father. Hanging there with the pictures of the Rogers family. And, god, it looked
He looked down at the glass on the floor.  His hated reflection looked up at him a thousand times over.  “I’ll be careful.”
“I’m not playing hooky,” Tony protested. “I’m tired. I didn’t sleep very well last night. I’m gonna take a long nap, and you should too.” He could not stop his hand from reaching out and touching Steve’s neck, tracing the line of his throat with his thumb. “Besides,” he said quietly, “even if I did go in to work, you could still stay here. You can stay here whenever you want.”
.” He slipped his hand further up Steve’s arm, pulling him closer. “I didn’t really try that hard.” He brushed his lips lightly against Steve’s jaw. “Not once that
Tony resisted an almost insurmountable urge to reach up and brush a soothing hand through Steve’s hair. “Nah. Not serious. Pretty
“I almost didn’t recognize you,” Tony said, and now he came closer. His eyes roved over Steve’s face, the beard that covered his cheeks, his body, thinner now than it had been last time they'd seen each other. The cup in his hand trembled just the slightest bit as he looked at him. Steve let him look. He had to. He couldn’t move. He was frozen in place. “My god,” Tony breathed. “What are you doing here?”
Steve put his hand on Tony’s hip and kissed him briefly over Morgan’s head. “Mm. Guess that wouldn’t be very nice of me, would it?”
Tony threw himself down on the couch and lifted his feet onto the coffee table.  “You don’t have to tell me, soldier.  I believe you.  But next time you two decide to get down to fisticuffs, let me know.  I could sell out Madison Square Garden with that match-up.  It’d be like Tyson versus Holyfield all over again.  Although, hopefully with less ear-biting.”  He shrugged.  “Or more.  It’d be good, either way.”
She gave him a guilty, distracted smile. “You’re right, honey,” she said, visibly trying to get herself under control. “I’m sorry. I don’t mean to put pressure on you. On either of you.”
Tony skimmed his hands down Steve’s torso, then back up again, smoothing along his shirt. His fingers worked one button open. He kissed the skin he’d uncovered. Flicked it with his tongue. “Well, I’m a pretty needy
Tony took his time chewing his pizza, then sucked on his straw. He hadn’t told Howard about Steve. Mostly because he didn’t think it was any of his goddamn business--but part of him really did want to tell him. The part of him that enjoyed these lunches with Howard. The part of him that had always wanted to have a
Tony pulled the bandage he was wrapping around Steve’s hand tight.  Steve hissed in pain and Tony loosened it again.  “Sorry.”
Steve laughed, then ducked his head and exhaled slowly. “I’m gonna regret this,” he whispered. “I know it.”
Tony nodded, his finger gently stroking Steve’s unmarked skin.  “It was nice.  It was really nice.  Do you remember what happened then?”
Suddenly, he turned, cat-quick, super-soldier quick, grabbed a wine glass from the counter, and hurled it against the wall.  It exploded in a sharp, deadly rain of crystal.  Everyone ducked, covering their faces.
you to put that on me. Okay? I’m here. That’s part of what being together is.” He gestured between them. “That’s part of what
“Tell me everything,” she whispered. Her eyes were shining with a very specific dark glimmer he hadn’t seen in a couple years. The last time, Sam thought, had been just about nine months before Nick was born. She pressed against him, encircling his waist with her arms. “Speak slowly.” She let her tongue play over his lips. “Leave
Of course they did. Sam was a smart guy, good-looking, funny, quick with quips, and quick with a laugh whenever
Steve swam another lap, then stopped. He was directly across from Tony, but too far away to touch. “It wasn’t your fault.”
Steve glanced up, a little smile on his mouth. “It’s okay,” he said. “He won’t hurt her. He likes...people.”
She did. She was still just a baby--a round-faced, smiling baby--but she had the same dark hair, the same dark eyes. He could see Tony in those eyes. Like there was something going on behind them. Something either far too sophisticated, or far too funny for normal people to understand. Looking at it, seeing it in someone else, a child,
“Doesn’t like guns, does she?” Ross said.  His voice dripped with the same scorn his eyes held.  “I suppose when your whole body is a weapon you wouldn’t want competition.  Is that it,
“Clint!” she snapped, realizing his intent and the reason for it in the very next heartbeat.  She leapt to his side and grasped the arrow before he could let it fly.  She stared at him hard.  “Don’t,” she said.
Steve was paler too.  His face held the pallor of someone who had been locked under the ocean for a year, only able to see the sky for an hour a week.  His hair had lost some of its golden luster.  It was darker now, dull.
The car slowed--115.  110. 100. 90. 80. 70.  An almost sedate 60. It was still way too fast to take the curve, but he did it.
Sorry I haven't updated in a while. I've been in kind of a funk. It always happens this time of year. Feeling a little better, so here's a short chapter. I'm going to really try and get this done this week...she said hopefully.
Steve nodded.  “Yes,” he said, then took Tony’s hand and kissed his palm.  “Thank you for giving money to the pangolins.”
“It’s not a ‘but’ moment.  It’s an ‘and’ moment, because Bucky’s going to be one of those people.  And so is Pepper.”  Steve stopped, waiting for Tony to say something.  When he didn’t, Steve went on.  “And that’s going to make things--this--more complicated.”  Steve looked at the blank slate of Tony’s face and nodded.  “Right.  Unless I’m reading more into it than there is.  I do that.  You know I do that.”
Steve smiled, the tension already slipping out of his body just at the sight of the words on the screen. Warmth already prickling through his muscles. Banishing the cold.
“Yeah,” Steve said. “When I first...you know...woke up, they kept me pretty busy. Training mostly. With new weapons. Different martial arts disciplines.” He smiled. “And school. Or
Steve shook his head. “No. It’s never easy losing somebody.” He sighed again. “A team-mate. Or...you know. Anybody.”
“I can’t let it go,” he said in a loud, angry whisper, looking over his shoulder to where Steve and Bruce still lazed along the shoreline.  “Because none of
Steve stood hesitantly in the doorway.  His eyes jumped here and there, going everywhere but the bed.  Tony was reminded of that first night they’d spent together.  Neither had been sure what they were doing, where they belonged, how they fit.  Thankfully, this time, one of them knew.
Steve looked at that one the longest. He wasn’t jealous--not now, anyway--but he felt something stirring inside him as he looked at the photograph. At the differences and similarities between Pepper and the little girl in her arms. He wasn’t sure what it was he felt. Maybe it was gratitude.
They got up around ten. Steve started coffee and Tony fed the cat, picking him up and cooing to him for a while. Steve rolled his eyes.
“Stay here tonight,” he whispered, pushing himself against Steve’s cock, undulating against him. “Please. Baby. Stay here.”
Tony leaned closer and put his head on Steve's shoulder.  There was no point in arguing. Especially during the lover's/happy hour.  "Fine," he said. "You're right. You're always right."
The fire was dying out again, the two chunks of wood Tony had thrown onto it reduced to gray ash, but there was still enough light to see Steve.  He was curled up on the couch, his broad back to Tony, head pillowed on his own arm.  The chair lay on its side, one wheel spinning listlessly, as it Steve had shoved it after he’d gotten out.
He sat by the pool, his feet dangling down into the water. He’d come out here a few hours ago, when the sun was still up, and the afternoon was hot around him. He had sat on one of the lounge chairs for a while. He sat the folder of papers--all filled out and signed--on the table at his side, and anchored them with a bottle of gin. It was unopened. He left it unopened. He didn’t drink much under ordinary circumstances, and he didn’t want to start now. He’d seen how that spiralled. He didn’t want to spiral. He was staying afloat. Keeping it together. What else did people say in situations like this? Whatever it was, he was that. He was doing that.
Afterward, Steve laid by Tony's side for a while. Just holding him. Just kissing him. Just being quiet together, letting their hands and minds wander. After a bit, Steve kissed Tony once more, then went and got into the shower. Tony lazed in the bed after he was gone, replaying the evening in his head, thinking how perfect it was, how sweet and warm. Steve had
He looked up, his eyes blazing, and Tony drew in a sharp breath and closed his teeth over his lip. A flutter of fear and deep, hidden want shivered through him, but he shoved it down, back into whatever hole it had come from. “That-” he began, then let out a breath, wiped his mouth, and tried again. “That’s not what he meant, Steve.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve said, trying to keep his voice steady. “I’m so sorry, Pietro. I wanted to love you. I tried to love you. I tried so fucking hard.”
“It’s not what I meant either,” Tony said.  “In spite of how it sounded.”  He drummed his fingers on his desk, thinking.  He cast his mind back over the last week or so, trying to think of something that could have happened, and came up with nothing.  Just a handful of times Steve had acted strangely, but they all seemed like effect, not cause.
He’d put a restriction on Pepper’s access too.  Just in case.  He’d once said that she had paid her dues when it came to him.  That hadn’t changed.  FRIDAY said she’d been by twice.  No status change.  She went away upset.  But, at least she went away.
Steve kissed his shoulder, loving the way he could feel the warmth of Tony’s skin against his lips through the fabric of his shirt. “She was right. You both are. I don’t know what either one of you are doing with me.”
“No, it’s true.  I would’ve--” he swallowed again, “--died a hero.  That’s what I was meant for.  That was my moment.”  His face was soft but undeniable.  “You should have let him kill me.”
A wave of “What the fuck was that?” ran through the entire bus when it thumped heavily on the pavement as the tire blew out and the bus slued to the right. When the driver wrenched the wheel and guided them to the side of the road, there was a collective sigh that turned into a dark, wordless grumble when it was announced there was a flat and there would be another wait while it was fixed.
He scraped his toe through the dirt at his feet, tracing a couple of circles, tracing the shape of a star. He sighed, thinking about Tony, wondering what he’d done to make him mad, wondering why he’d-
He sat in his chair and called Steve.  It went to voicemail.  “Steve.  I need you to call me.  It’s eight o’clock.  I’m scared.  This is scary.  Please call me.”
He curled his fist into Steve’s shirt and kissed his chest.  “Besides,” he said, “I believe you promised me an eternity.”
and a string of emojis Tony couldn’t have explained if he’d tried.  They all seemed to know Steve was with him, though.  He didn’t know if that was poor secret-keeping on Natasha’s part, which seemed unlikely, or just good guess-work on everyone else’s.
When Steve still didn’t let go, Tony pressed his lips against his broad shoulder.  Steve was shaking.  His skin quivered under Tony’s lips.
Tony tossed the shoe he’d found away.  Fuck it.  The other was gone.  Maybe it had went through a worm-hole.  A dimensional gap.  Things like that existed.  He could attest to that first-hand.
Had he ever thought he’d been happy before?  His time with Peggy had been too short.  They’d never had the time to just be quiet together.  Their every moment had been filled with worry, fear, and blood.  It had brought them together in a way simple moments might not have done, and their love had burned brighter because of it, but he could not remember having a moment of quiet peace with her.  He ached for that loss even now while he sat here with Tony’s arm around him, but instead of turning this time into something bittersweet, it made it even better.  Steve thanked her for that in his heart.  He thanked her for being the one to show him what true love could be.  He would carry that with him for however long he had left in this life.  He would carry her face and her heart and her sweet love with him forever.  But maybe now, he would not have to carry her picture as much.  Maybe now, the person whose favor he would wear riding into battle was sitting here beside him.
He took a sketchpad and a book with him when he went, but Tony had never seen him use either one.  Whenever he looked out on him--and he looked out a lot--they sat in a tidy pile on the ground beside his chair, within reach but never reached for, while Steve sat looking out at the water.
“Hey baby,” he said into the phone, trying to stave off the hard-on the thought of that sleepover was bringing on. “Party starts at six, ‘kay? No rush getting there. It’s sort of open-house, but I can’t wait to see you, so six-thirty-ish? That okay? Then-” and that hard-on was just
They were sitting on Thad’s bed in his city apartment. It was where they always ended up. They had “date nights” twice a week, and “lunch dates” another two times per week. Their “dates” were spent indoors, either at Thad’s house or sometimes at a hotel near his office. A few times, when Thad was working late and there was no one else on his floor, Steve had come to his office. He brought sandwiches from a deli, but Thad was never very interested in the food. All he really had eyes for was the sight of Steve spread out naked on his desk or the couch in the corner.  Once, he’d taken Steve to the conference room, bent him over the head of the table, and fucked him mercilessly. He pulled out right before he came, and finished on his boss’s chair, muttering about
Steve sighed and reached into his pocket. He took out a folded slip of paper. Opened it. Looked at the numbers written inside. It was a phone number. Ten digits. He’d copied it off of a poster hanging on the bulletin board at school on Friday after he, Sam, and Tony had gone their separate ways after lunch. He had carried it in his pocket ever since, switching it from one pair of jeans to the next when he changed, keeping it close, keeping it as a reminder and as a safety net.
Steve leaned into him, pressing his cheek more fully into his palm. He looked up through his lashes. “It wasn’t all bad,” he said. “Over there. There was good stuff too. Good people. Some of the best people I ever met were over there.”
--got out of the car. He moved with a casual grace, slipping out of the car and straightening his jacket. He ran a hand through his hair and looked around. Steve couldn’t make out the look on his face. He was too high up to really do that. He wasn’t sure he wanted to anyway. And was certain that it didn’t matter. This was probably just a visitor. There were plenty of apartments in the building, and just because this kid
Steve just laughed.  “You would have been the only one.  Nobody was too interested back then.  Peggy, but she was my C.O.  It took us awhile.  In fact, we really weren’t supposed to, at all.”
“You’re the one not playing fair,” Steve said, and touched Tony’s bottom lip. “Pouting like that. You know I’m no good at resisting that.”
“--and then we won’t get invited to any more church services, or ice cream socials, and you’ll have to start greasing your hair back, and smoking on the street corner, and thumbing your nose at the cops, and frankly, it just sounds like a lot of work.  So, if you could just not get sent to prison again, that would be great.”
life here. They’d only been here a month or two, and most of that had been spent either in the hospital therapy wing or planning a wedding. Life had been put slightly on hold for a while, but they could start working on it now. Tony had no doubt, seeing them together at the wedding, so much in love, that life would be first and foremost on their minds from here on out. He sighed, thinking about that. About life where none had existed before. He only stopped thinking about it when Steve crossed the room toward him. He didn’t think about new life then. He thought about an old one.
I almost made it on time! Only a day late, that's not so bad for me. Anyway, enjoy a little bit of birthday fluff. It might be a little cheesy, but hey, if a birthday isn't a full-on shit-fest, it SHOULD be cheesy!
“I’ll find Stark, or at least somebody with eyes on him.”  He looked down at Steve, then at Nat.  “Keep him talking if you can.  I’ll hurry.”
They took the stairs again. Steve in the lead, Tony right behind him. It was familiar. So familiar. The close space, the scratches on the bannister. Some kid had drawn a smiley-face on the wall in Magic Marker, and that was new, but everything else was the same. Even Mrs. Perkins's door. The little doormat she had in front of it with the words WELCOME FRIENDS written in old-timey script was still there. Tony smiled at that. Still there. They’d still have to be quiet. Put on The Eagles. Muffle their voices as best they could. It was almost like they’d discovered some way of traveling back in time. Just erasing the last three years of their lives so they could wind up back here, climbing these stairs one more time.
more qualified to judge coolness. But,” she gave his arm a playful swat, and he smiled brightly, “it’s really just one guy. One guy...and his kid.”
“Well,” Howard said, “I’ve said my piece. I’ll leave the rest in your hands. You know what needs to happen. If you love him, you’ll do it.”
Seconds ticked by while they sat together in the sun.  Natasha could feel him thinking and let him do it.  She had something she needed to say to him, but he’d lead her there.  She knew he would.  Their minds were similar even though their tactics usually were not.
was he doing laughing with Howard Stark in the first place? And, he wondered, did it even matter anymore?
Tony could feel his own tears starting to well in his eyes, but he brushed them away with his hand. He nodded.
“Is it okay?” Tony asked, and all of a sudden, his face got anxious, his voice a little tight, a little worried. “I really didn’t know what to get. I wasn’t sure what you liked.”
Steve nodded at them.  The boy dropped the ball on his toe, and the girl covered her mouth, rocking in her chair, giggling.  Tony shook his head.  “God, were we ever that young?”
Tony continued running his hand through Steve’s hair.  “Yeah.  I do wish Nat would have told him sooner, though.  Bruce rewrote his four times before he found out he didn’t need them.”
Sir Purr was lounging in his cat bed by the door.  Steve absolutely refused to let him sleep in their bed, and Tony was smart enough to let him have his way on that point.  Besides, Sir Purr seemed to enjoy having his own space.  Maybe because he was an old tom who had never shared a bed before.  Tony was an old tom too, but he adored sharing a bed.  He supposed he and his cat-child couldn’t be in sync on every point.
Steve leaned into the quiet, waiting for sleep, waiting for its soft, welcoming embrace.  It was just reaching for him, just beginning to enfold him, when Tony’s voice came out of the darkness one more time.  It was a bit petulant, a bit sulky, and everything Steve had ever wanted and never thought he would be lucky enough to have.
“She doesn’t know how to make his coffee, Captain,” FRIDAY said.  “She doesn’t go check on him in the lab.  Or fold his t-shirts with the design facing up so he can find his favorites easier.  Or help him catalogue his DVDs by genre, sub-genre, and body-count.”
“I guess that would probably be okay,” Steve said. His hand stole out and landed on Tony’s hip. The feel of that, so familiar, so simple, so loved, sent a powerful wave of nostalgia through him, overtaking everything in its path. It even won over his brain, and for a second, one sweet second, the whole of him, every single part, was on-board with this. Completely and totally on-board.
“I’ll get better, okay?” Steve said, then stopped, a tight frown creasing his brow. “I mean, if you want me to…?”
But then she pulled away, and although she was a bit breathless, she was just Nat, and he was just Steve, and they were what they had been and would always be--just friends.
They held each other until Steve’s phone rang again. He groaned and Tony laughed. “What about tonight?” he asked into Steve’s ear. “Fury can’t keep you all night, right?”
to become a master of it. If you didn’t, you could fuck up. If you fucked up, somebody might end up dead.
“God, don’t talk about that,” Tony rasped.  “Don’t even say the name.  I don’t want to hear it in your mouth.”
“I’ve been in a long time, Buck,” he said and ran a hand through his hair. “You know? A long time. I...I just think it’s time I got out. That’s all.”
“I’m not a member of your Stark Tower frat house, Tony.  You must have me confused with someone else.”
"Oh, for Christ's sake," Tony muttered, running a hand through his hair. "That's nothing. That's like forty bucks. I want to give you something
“Yeah,” he said, smiling his little Cheshire Cat smile, “nobody ever accused me of that.”  He picked up his plate, sat it in his lap, then took Tony’s.  “Come on, check the locks and put out the candles.  I’ll do these.”
Steve, who had really only been aware of Tony sitting dangerously close, could only bob his head.  He couldn’t hear a melody.  Couldn’t hear anything but Tony’s voice, really, but he agreed.  “Yeah, Tony.  It is.  It’s really pretty.”
Tony rubbed Steve's back with slow, even movements.  "Hey," he said softly. "Um, I told Jen. It just slipped out.  I'm sorry."
“So, there’s something else, then?” he asked, and looked around, wide-eyed.  “Where is big, blond, and beautiful, anyway?”
“Hey,” Tony snapped. “Target has some good shit.” He had never been inside a Target, but Steve loved it. He bought all his sheets there. “You know what?” he said. “I think I will try Target. Thanks for your time.”
Tony stood up and settled himself at Steve’s side on the sofa. He picked the bottle up, recapped it, and sat it on the floor, far out of Steve’s reach. Steve didn’t even seem to notice. He was looking at his hands. Looking at them as if they were traitors to a cause. He clenched them into tight fists then let them hang loose between his knees again. It was only when Tony slipped his own hand into his left one that Steve looked at him. And even then, it was troubled. Hurt. Painful.
Tony ran his hands up through Steve’s hair, then drew him closer. He kissed Steve again, then kissed his neck, his shoulder, his hands slid under his shirt and began to inch slowly up, exposing his skin. “Fuck,” he murmured. “You found me out. Gonna have to change plans now.”
seen Bucky use them, though,” Steve went on, seemingly oblivious to Tony’s intestinal acrobatics. “But that’s something I’d really rather not think about right now. Or ever,” he said stolidly. “Again. If that’s okay with you.”
press--just a little--against Tony, and when he did, Tony felt his heart do a strenuous tumble in his chest. He felt something else too. Something a little more carnal truly make its presence known, and he wasn’t sure if he was worried or excited that Steve could probably feel it too.
Steve thought so too. It was easier for him if he just kept moving. He’d spoken to his mom on Christmas. Had even gotten to speak to Sam. He’d made it through the holidays okay, but now that they were over, it was like he was at low-tide. He tried not to show it. He tried to be an example, and on the outside, he thought he was doing fine. He got up, got dressed, got moving. He kept everyone else moving. He was
Tony sighed again. “I think I’ll wait ‘til later. Let him eat first. He’s always in a better mood after he eats.”
Steve put his arms around Tony’s shoulders, loving just how easily they fit around him. Like the way Tony’s hand had felt tucked into his own earlier. How it had felt so
“Alright, alright, smartass,” Tony said, flapping a hand at him.  “I thought we’d established that you are not funny.”
“Not because I didn’t wanna be, Tony,” he said, turning to face him fully.  He reached out and touched the blue light of the reactor with gentle fingers.  “I did want to be around you--I
Tony didn’t think even Stephen Strange could match the look of disdain that crossed Thaddeus Ross’ features.  “We had an appointment?” he said.  “January thirtieth.  Eight a.m.”
Steve bent down and ruffled the dog’s fur. Dodger looked up at him, asking if it was okay if he explored the unfamiliar place. Steve handed the end of the leash to Morgan. “We’ll keep him leashed for a while,” he said. “Until he understands what’s expected of him, ‘kay?”
Steve’s skin was hot under the fabric.  It always was.  At least that hadn’t changed.  Tony shook him.  Gently.  It felt like shaking a sleeping tiger awake.
Tony stood at the top of that grassy little hill where he’d knelt with Steve’s head in his lap so long ago now.
He’d been going to therapy for years, he’d said.  Twice a week, he’d said.  He had the courage and strength to lay himself bare time and time again and still come home happy and smiling.  It took a bravery Steve deeply admired, and the very thought that it was Tony doing it--
They stood side-by-side, watching them, silence once again falling between them. It wasn’t quite as awkward as it had been, but it wasn’t comfortable either. Tony could see Steve casting tiny side-long looks his way, and suddenly he couldn’t stand it anymore.
Tony grunted, his hand trailing down Steve’s shoulder to his wrist and back again.  “I see your point.  It is a little impersonal.”
“Yeah,” Steve said, running a hand through his hair. He felt like an idiot. Why did he still feel like an idiot? He was over this. He should be
say ‘Hey, Tony, I’m going to prison tomorrow.  See ya later’.”  Tony shook his head.  “Nope.  He definitely wouldn’t say that.”
“I joined for the wrong reason,” he said, squeezing Bucky’s hand. “Maybe quitting for the wrong reason is the right thing.”
done, and I just want to scream it out, you know?  But sometimes, I…I don’t think anyone would listen.  I don’t think they want to hear.  I don’t think they want to know.”
“Different how?” Sam asked.  Tony shifted, and Sam explained, “We don’t need, you know, details, just tell us why it was different.”
Tony watched him. The music was loud, but for now, he barely heard it. His briefcase hung from one hand. The flowers that he’d bought for Steve on a whim from a street-vendor--silly, but he’d done it--hung from the other, forgotten. Ever since the other night and his encounter with Thad Ross, Tony had begun to really think about the future. About what he wanted. About what he needed. About how he wanted to spend the rest of his life. And who he wanted to spend it with.
“Okay,” Tony said, and closed his eyes, rubbing his temples with one hand. “If we’re not calling it an ‘episode’, what are we calling it?”
Steve kissed him one more time, just a soft brush of his lips, then he stood up. He grabbed his jacket from the back of the desk-chair where he had thrown it, and slipped it on. He went to the pile of their clothing and toed into his shoes and picked up his bag. He didn’t come back for another kiss. Another hug. He stood straight, unconsciously at attention, his back a hard upright line.
guy. He wasn’t entirely sure how that had happened. Or how this somewhat spur-of-the-moment shopping trip inspired by a lunchtime text from Steve that consisted of no more than two little symbols-- <3 --had devolved into this mess he had going on here right now.
He looked around, scuffed his toe in the dust and earth covering the concrete, unconsciously tracing out letters.  S-T-E
She nodded, quick and light.  Her own tears were falling, catching the light from the bulb and shining like diamonds.
Steve shut the book with a flat clap and knocked his head against the locker a couple times. “Why do they have pop quizzes anyway?” he asked. “Don’t they get that we’re stressed enough without that on top of it all?”
Steve snaked his hand toward him and grasped his wrist.  He caressed the inner part with his thumb.  “Five minutes, Tony,” he mumbled.  “Then I want you back here.”
Steve made carbonara four times that year. Tony flew them to Paris four times.  They didn't go see The Mona Lisa.
Bucky glanced over his shoulder at Tony and Josh. “Don’t let that get to you. And whenever you’re ready to leave, we’re gone.”
As if sensing he was being left out of the equation, Sir Purr began to twine around Tony’s ankles, meowing and rubbing his face against his jeans.  Steve chuckled softly.  “Somebody’s pissed I’m getting all the attention.”
Thor closed the compass with a gentleness that bordered on reverence.  “Here,” he said, handing it back.  “Keep it next to your heart.  Ever have the warriors of Asgard ridden into battle wearing the favor of their beloved upon their chest.  It reminds us of why we fight.”
He sighed. “Fine,” he muttered, and dialed the number. He waited for a minute, then said, “Yeah, hey, can I talk to Steve Rogers in the kitchen, please?” He looked at his hand, at the bandage covering the knuckles. It hurt. His lip hurt too.
Another fraction of an inch, and was that amusement or even warmth in his eyes again?  God, Tony hoped so.
They went outside, blinking into the sun. It was still bright, and Steve wondered how that could possibly be. He’d left his sun back in the cabin. Why wasn’t it dark out?
“Yeah, you do. I got you one. It’s in the medicine cabinet.” Tony took a bite, groaned obscenely, then took another. “What’s the matter with you, Rogers? Don’t you snoop through medicine cabinets?”
“Come on,” Tony coaxed. “You already owe me. Owe me times two, remember?” He tipped his head up, lips curving. “Take me out tonight.”
Tony lay back on the bed and Steve followed. “Let’s worry about ‘from now on’ later, okay?” he breathed. “Just do what I want right now.”
On the floor, leaning back against the foot of the bed, he thought of all the times he and Nat had lain there watching tv, not talking much, just watching.  Sometimes Clint would come in and wedge himself into the space between them and rest his head on Natasha’s shoulder.  Or Steve’s.  He wasn’t picky about who played the part of pillow when naptime rolled around.  Or Wanda would stretch out along the bottom and change the channel with a flick  of her finger.
“In my room, asleep.  He’s exhausted.  I don’t think he’s slept...at all, probably since it happened.”
Tony bowed his head, laughing in relieved, happy breaths as the guy stepped out of the car and looked around, his hands on his hips.  Tony tossed the dish cloth he was holding over his shoulder and walked outside.
Thad looked at him, pierced him with his eyes. He was good at that. He had been from the beginning. It had been his eyes that first caught
the ‘somebody else’. Trish is out of town with her family. Bailey’s pulling a double-shift already, and then there’s me.” He dropped his head, trying very hard to calm himself down a little. “I have to go.”
Steve put his head in his hand, but he felt good.  Tony’s encouragement made him feel good.  Happy.  “You don’t have to try and put a positive spin on this, Tony.  I know it sucks.”
Tony smiled at him, but it seemed cautious, tiny lines around his eyes crinkling. “Do I shake your hand, or...?” he asked.
seen. He was all-encompassing. Everything. Just everything. The memories of Josh, of Pepper, of any of his other lovers were obliterated. How could they compare to this? How could anyone ever compare to the feeling of Steve Rogers pushing--gently at first, oh so very gently--into him, the stretch, the burn, then the ecstasy as he started to move, dragging in and out, leaning down to kiss him, to suck on his neck, overlaying his own marks on top of those left by Josh’s now-inconsequential mouth.
“‘Kay, Daddy!” she answered, then turned her eyes up to Steve’s. “May I take your coat?” she asked formally, and Steve bit the insides of his cheeks to keep the laughter in.
“Are you feeling sick?” he asked finally. It was almost the end of the day. Almost time for them to go their separate ways for the night, but he wanted to know if Tony was okay before he left. He felt a little worried about Tony. Steve had been sick a lot when he was a baby. His mom had told him so. Said he had a “weak constitution”. Steve didn’t know what that meant. They had read The Constitution in social studies--Mr. Coulson had even made them memorize the Preamble--but Steve didn’t remember anything about being sick in there. But, he was only eleven, still just a kid. Maybe it had been in some of the words he didn’t understand.
“Yes,” Tony answered immediately.  “I do.  I’m sorry.”  He folded his hands in front of his coffee cup, giving the appearance of a good boy.  “Please tell me what untoward things you are planning.”
Tony felt a hand on his elbow, and when he turned around, he realized how ridiculous it had been to wipe his eyes. He fell right into her arms. Just like he’d done before. And she caught him, just like she’d done before.
Tony turned in his arms and kissed his forehead sleepily. “Don’t worry,” he said. “‘Kay? Nothing to worry about.”
Steve hung up after that, then went into the bathroom. He turned the water on, shed his clothing, and climbed into the shower. He appreciated Nick’s concern. He knew why it was there. It was the same reason he’d been given this assignment in the first place. His last one had been rough. Very rough. He’d lost his partner--his friend--on that assignment. This was his quiet-time. His down-time. They had wanted to hold him back for six months after the last one, but he pushed to work. He convinced them he was ready. That he was not only ready, but
Tony shrugged. “Most of it, I guess. At least this side. I’m not sure where the property line is, but I’m pretty sure it’s a bunch of it.” He gestured vaguely behind him, at the small house and what lay beyond that. “It goes into the woods back there too. There’s a fence. I followed it a couple times when I was a kid, but I got tired and had to turn around and come back.”
He realized how it sounded. How loud and borderline desperate it was blurted out into the darkened room, but he didn’t care. Even when Steve lifted his head to look at him with eyes that were a cocktail of amusement and wariness, he still didn’t care. “Yeah,” he went on, deciding just to go with it. Deciding to just jump right in. “Yeah, I want to buy you something. Something big. Something extravagant. Something you always wanted but never got.” He maneuvered himself around, slipping out from under Steve's weight so he could kneel on the sofa in front of him and grab both his hands. “Whatever you want, baby," he said. "Anything. Tell me, and it’s yours.”
Thank you for indulging me! I don't usually write sweet love stories, but I hope you all enjoyed this one. Thank you for reading!❤️❤️❤️
But, as the plane bumped to the ground, Steve stirred beside him.  He took a deep breath, hummed it out, then rubbed his cheek against the fabric of Tony’s jacket.  He’d awoken that way a dozen times during the time they’d lived together.  Except then he’d--Steve turned his face into Tony’s shoulder and kissed it.  The ritual was complete.
Steve smiled guiltily. “Maybe,” he said. “But asking if I was having a sleepover? You put her up to that,” he accused, and Tony laughed darkly against his neck.
Around them were sounds of scuffle.  Voices shouting, running footsteps, but none of that mattered.  It was far away.  Unimportant.  Meaningless.  Right now, the only thing that meant anything was Steve’s arm holding him tightly against his body.  Steve’s tongue in his mouth.  Steve’s heart pounding against his own.  Steve.
P.s. Happy birthday, Tony Stark! I could have lived my life without you, but it would not have been as sweet.
Steve said nothing. He just stood in the doorway. He was frowning. He couldn’t help it. He couldn’t help that he was scared, either. He had never been alone in a room with Howard before. He’d never been alone in a room with a shark before either. He thought they might feel about the same.
He went into the bathroom and showered, brushed his teeth, pulled on some sweats, then went back into the bedroom. Tony hadn’t moved. Steve put the tablet aside, then bent to take Tony’s glasses off his nose. Tony flinched, his hand rising automatically. His eyelids fluttered, and he smiled when he saw it was just Steve.
Steve held his ground.  He had no idea what time it was.  No idea what day.  Time in the hole was non-time.  They brought him his meals, but he often slept through them and simply ate it cold when he woke up.  Sometimes, he had the suspicion he’d slept through two meals.  Unless the army had started serving oatmeal three times a day.  Which could be.  He wasn’t really sure.
“Miss Maximoff has incapacitated all guards and Mr. Wilson successfully penned the dogs away.  The only heat signature left belongs to Secretary Ross.  He’s in his bed.  Third floor, second door at the top of the stairs.
He took a quick shower, and sat on the edge of the bed, dressed in nothing but a towel, and looked at the clock on his bedside table. 12:04. Late. Or early. Depending on your thought process. He bit his lip. He knew he shouldn’t, but he wanted to talk to Tony. Wanted to hear his voice. Just to tell him good-night.
“Are you sure?” Steve asked, but he was already standing up, already shoving his feet into his shoes, already putting his keys in his pocket, already grabbing his jacket from the chair where he’d thrown it when he came home.
Tony held his hands up in surrender.  “No, Nat, I don’t mean to hurt him.  I mean, she could help him.”
people they were talking to. His mother they were talking to, and not his...anything else. Because he didn’t have an
It had been a week since he’d seen Tony again. A week since they’d gotten hot chocolate. A week since they’d decided to try again. Steve still was not one hundred percent sure that it had happened at all. If he didn’t have a napkin with Tony’s phone number written on it, he would have been one hundred percent positive that it
“Obie isn’t the boss of me,” Tony said, and he took another step, pressing almost completely against Steve. The fire escape was already small, and with the two of them on it together, there really was no room to move back. Not that Steve wanted to. He knew he should, but he didn’t. “I can see who I want.”
Steve’s bare feet slapped along the concrete as they made their way up the corridors.  He had changed out of his pajamas during his “awake” times and into his jumpsuit for awhile, but after Tony, Wanda, and Doctor Strange had come to visit, he had pretty much lived in his pajamas.  In fact, he was not sure, even now, that the entire interlude had not been a very vivid, very detailed dream.  He wore the pajamas to keep it close.  If it had been a dream, he wanted to remember it as well as possible.  If it hadn’t, well, the pjs were more comfortable, anyway.
Whew!  That went places I wasn't expecting.  Especially since this was just going to be a little one-off story about Steve and Nat bonding over a bit of mutual pining.  But, when they kept talking, I just kept writing.  Far be it from me to shush characters who continue to speak.
Tony’s fingers gripped Steve’s forearm tighter. “What do you say, Rogers?” he asked. “Want to come dance with us?”
Tony went to the back door and looked out.  Steve was sitting on the deck, staring down at the lake.  Tony went outside.
Strange called him on Friday and told him he was working on something but still had nothing concrete yet.
Nat gave him a final squeeze, then pulled back and looked at him with shining eyes. “Oh Tony,” she said, and there were tears in the corners of her eyes. “You guys are getting
“I know.”  Tony said, restlessly running his hands over Steve’s arms, his shoulders, his neck, his face.  “And I’m sorry.  I’m so sorry for that.  Everything was fucked up and I just lost it.  I went crazy.”  Steve let out a breath, and Tony pressed against him.  “And that’s not your fault, and it’s not a reason.  I know.  But, baby, I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.”  He clutched Steve’s cheek, trying to pull him down, trying to get Steve’s eyes on him.  “Please.  Please just…just forgive me.  You don’t have to be with me, if that’s not what you want, but please just forgive me.  Just tell me that it’s okay.”
The shower had run for a long time.  A very long time.  It was a good thing they’d washed the dishes right after their quiet little dinner because Steve seemed pretty determined to run the water cold.  Tony didn’t mind.  He’d showered himself earlier while Steve put dinner together, and besides, if his guy wanted to use all the hot water after four months in prison, Tony certainly wasn’t going to stop him.  Hell, he would have carried it up from the lake and boiled it on the stove himself if Steve had so desired.  He would have done anything.  Would
For Tony, time had ceased to exist.  Everyone and everything around them had disappeared.  With every word Steve spoke, a little more color had drained from their surroundings and leeched over into the protective bubble he built to keep them separate from everything else.  By the time he finished speaking, the world outside was nothing but a swirl of gray, while inside their bubble, every color, every sound, every sensation was heightened a thousandfold.  The rumble of Steve’s voice, the red of his lips, even the feeling of Tony’s own clothing against his skin was nearly more than he could bear.
Sarah stood up suddenly and came to him. She put her hands on his shoulders. “Let’s go to a movie,” she said decisively. “It won’t do either of us any good to sit here all day thinking about it. Let’s go out.”
to his relationship with Tony than there was to his relationship with Sam. There was that tingly feeling when Tony was close. That stupid, fucking tingly feeling that made him drop everything and think of nothing else whenever it happened. There was the fact that Tony stood closer to him than Sam stood. And when Tony brushed against him, Steve wanted to slide his arm around him and pull him even closer. There was the fact that they had
