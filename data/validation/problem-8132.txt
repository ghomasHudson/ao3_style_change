Tony swooped down to grab Steve around the midriff. "Time to go, Cap," he said and took off into the sky with Steve, fast enough that he could hope they wouldn't be tracked in the confusion, The sun's blinding rays covered their ascend. Steve clutched on to his shoulders with a death grip as Iron Man sped out into the blue.
Tony lifted the fingers of his other, healthy hand to brush at the tear tracks on Steve's grimy face with his thumb. "Hey, you."
"May I pet her?" Steve asked, with far more restraint than before when he'd been touching Tony, which just went to show.
"There's gotta be another way." Steve insisted. "Rocket said Peter Quill had been able to hold the power stone because he had some sort of special powers, remember?" Yeah, Tony remembered the raccoon's story of how they all held hands and sang kumbaya. But Steve was talking about a super human wielding the gauntlet, and Tony had to nip that in the bud.
Lost in thought, Tony considered Steve's reflection. For a man who
Tony didn't know what to make of Steve's dreamy look; it scared him. He hoped Steve wasn't feverish. Tony wanted a hotel with a good shower, somewhere clean to check on Steve's wound. "Once you're a little more stable, I'll take us to the nearest city and talk to an ATM, see if I can convince it to spit out some money." This century was frustrating with its reliance on paper documentation and face-to-face interactions, all the things Tony couldn't hack.
Steve turned to look at him, eye-brow lifted in question.
"I'm on it," Steve answered briskly, taking the elevator up. The workshop was under their penthouse floor in the Tower.
." Steve smiled. "Did it work?"
In the silence that followed, Tony couldn't find the words.
"Scoot over."
Tony's own image projection was less of a change: he'd lost the beard, and his hair was darker and longer, curling at the nape, his eyes blue. Steve had teased him about the most high-tech way to avoid shaving, but whatever — it worked, and they got on the base as two SHIELD agents, both wearing sharp dark suits they bought with the money Steve had won at pool the night before.
'I still think we'll be much better off if we don't list it all,' Sarah shook her head. 'This is just to make them want to meet us. Once we make a good impression that way, then we can fill them in on the rest.'
Bucky swept a critical eye over the garden, completing a head count. 'Three,' he decided, returning his attention to the braids.
Hell. He would take the woods again over this. At least then he knew who he was while a monster wore his face.
the company, you can count on that.' With that, she swept out. The two men barely noticed.
When Tony finally noticed him, he was so startled he dropped his hammer; the tool falling onto the floor with a weighty clang.
'Hello?' He said, trying to ignore how his heart was hammering, his chest constricting.
'That reminds me, Mr Stark,' Steve said, very aware that Thor and Stone were both still watching. 'I was going to ask if you'd consider rigging us up some of those fancy electric lights in the square, for the dancing.'
, and they were like
The thought made Peter pause. Because his dad
it might not be that simple; that Tony might change his mind or Howard might put a stop to the exchange, that even if Steve was free Barnaby still wouldn't be, that Barnaby might not forgive Steve lying about his name, that Barnaby might not feel the same connection Steve did, but the bond mark was a warm reassurance. He knew, somehow, on some level so deep inside that it had gone well beyond self delusion and into cosmic certainty, that out there somewhere Barnaby was trying to find his way back too.
There was a moment’s pause.  For a long minute Steve thought no one would say anything. Then:
Tony gave a limp chuckle. “Endorphin rush,” he said.
Somehow Tony’s confusion must have shown, paralysis be damned, because Stane continued in his villain rant.  Typical.  Obie was always one for grandstanding, and Jesus, Tony of all people could recognize a grandstand. “Ah, Tony. When I ordered that hit on you, I knew if that pack of fucking rabid Howling Commandos was around, they’d come and get you right away.  Had to take them out first.” Stane bent down so his face was inches away from Tony’s, reeking of cigar tobacco and cologne. “Worked like a charm. Took a nice little package of Starktech weapons, delivered to my late pal, Raza, but poof!” He grinned sharply, unfolding his hand like a small explosion. “No Commandos.  No Rogers.  No one to rescue poor little Tony.” He stood up again, the afternoon light glaring harshly against him, washing him out.
“He missed a Spanish quiz, Tony.  His grades are dropping, even though he’s brilliant.  You gotta remind him to go to class.  Just, you know, next time you’re telling him he did a good job.”
Tony was surprised to find he was hungry.  Well, then.  “Alright, J.  Run a prototype.  Clean  water. Achievable in our time.  And dad wanted to make a flying car.”  He turned to Steve.  “Lead on.”
Seriously, he’d thought the awful part of his day was over.  His mind flashed quickly over the past twelve hours or so.  Had they discussed anything classified? And—hadn’t the kitten been a little handsy with him? He blushed, his entire body burning hot.
It was like it was 1938, and he was having the snot kicked out of him in a Brooklyn back alley because he'd told a guy to lay off a lady, and he had known that the beating wasn't going to stop, that no-one else was coming to help, because Bucky was out of town. It was like he was in the plane, about to hit the water, and suddenly realised that he really didn't want to die. It was like the day he had cried at the news bulletin about the buildings, the day he had watched Bucky fall, the day he had been told Richard and Sarah would not be coming home, like someone had punched him so hard it had knocked everything out of him and, try as he might, there would be no getting back up.
‘Stop it.’
'I've worked here almost four years, Mr Stark.'
'What? No, of course not,' Tony said, and Steve realised he'd spoken aloud. 'Not one second of it. Except,' he hesitated, then trailed off.
'Better, I think,' his mom replied mildly. 'You must be hungry, let me fix you something.'
'Will you stop?' Steve asked.
'Yes.'
He felt rather stupid, but it wasn't like he'd had much experience. In the 40s,
'Well, too bad,' Steve said, putting the bag down on the floor. 'Let's get you dressed, eat some breakfast, and then we'll see what's in the bag, okay?'
'We call it Identity Fragmentation,' the Skrull said, obviously having decided to spoil it after all. 'I wonder, will you be able to keep hold of yourself when you're millions of different selves at the same time?'
sane to you right now?!'
what I'm supposed to be,' Steve said, then sighed. 'Listen, Ms Potts. I don't... this isn't going to make any more difference to his life than he wants it to. If he wants me to sign the marriage certificate and then get out of his life, I will.'
. He had no idea whether Natasha's level of distress was normal for women or not. He had no idea how much pain it was normal for her to be in, or whether he had got her enough tampons, or, or anything. She was a member of his team, and if she had to go through this every month, he needed to understand it, to know how to fix it. No matter how embarrassing it was, ignorance was no longer acceptable.
Steve thought, but quickly pushed the thought, the name, aside. He'd poured all that out onto the canvas, and couldn't think about it without feeling the howling roar of the void it had left inside him. It hurt like a hidden bruise buried deep in his skin, like the ache in his bones in the middle of a flare up. He couldn't think about it. Ms Potts looked at him a moment longer, then nodded, turning to go back to her desk. As she went to sit back down, she paused.
He smoothed down the flight suit and began working his way into the armour. This was going to be fun.
'Bones are just pistons, muscles are just pulleys,' Tony said. 'And I'm an engineer.'
'I'm proud of you,' Steve blurted, and Tony just had time to see his face flush with embarrassment before the door was shut between them.
'It was a
compliments? Oh honey.' He went over to Steve, rubbing his back until Steve eventually sat up and met his eye, pulling him in close.
This wasn't like normal. Usually, he sketched onto his canvases first, carefully building up lines, selecting colours one by one, getting help with the ones he couldn't distinguish between to make sure everything looked right. This was different, wild, he was almost throwing paint at the canvas, stabbing with with brush, trying to empty all the pain and anger and frustration that was too big to keep in, too much to process.
Peter, who as Spiderman was what Tony called an

too small for you, soldier.'
'What is that supposed to mean?'
Steve nodded and did so. Peter was all that mattered for now.
'I'm gone two months and this is what you do?! This is why I can't leave you alone!'
'Tony...' Steve said, stepping towards him, wishing the forge was closed off so he could cup his cheek, press his forehead against Tony's grime-streaked one, do something to ground him, remind him that he was here, and whole, and safe. But the forge was open to the street, so he contented himself with standing close, one hand gripped on Tony's elbow and the other, the bad one, doing what it could to squeeze his shoulder. This close, he could hear that Tony's breath was ragged. 'I had no idea you were this worried.'
‘The good folks at the museum seem to disagree,’ Stark examined the leaflet again, ‘As do 2 million visitors a year, apparently.’
'He went into the mine,' Miss Maximoff said, her face white. 'He was looking to see if there was anything left. But he hasn't come back out. I went in as far as I could, but the shaft has collapsed and-'
'It's S-' Steve cut himself off. If the Starks found out he'd been flirting at a bar after the third gift had already been sent, he could ruin the whole thing. 'It's James,' he finished, hoping Bucky wouldn't mind Steve borrowing his name. It wasn't like Bucky ever used it anyway.
The view out here never ceased to amaze him. It was one of the reasons he'd hired the place. For their first real trip away together, he'd wanted something special, and Steve had wanted to see Europe when it wasn't, quote,
'Stark.
‘Riiiight,’ Tony drawled, raising his eyebrows. ‘Well, excuse me for interrupting your “alone time” but-’
it would say.
(It was a good thing too, or Steve would have had a million strokes by now. Or worse, given that they had gotten up to a
'The Parkers' son? The one that's dying?'
The meeting the next day ended up taking place at the Stark mansion. When Howard found out that the coffee shop meeting hadn't taken place as scheduled, he'd insisted on supervising. Steve hadn't cared. He just wished the hours away, nearly vibrating with anticipation, not noticing his aches and pains, not a care in the world. It was like he was disappearing, like the feeling he got sometimes when he lost himself in his art, only to come round hours later. This time, though, he was losing himself in Barnaby.
flowers. My friend was not impressed that I got her lilies after “almost killing her”. Some people are so dramatic.’
'Does that mean you're finally going to kiss me, you ridiculous man?'
‘I need your number,’ he said, or tried to. What came out was a mess of strange, slobbery, guttering sounds, as if his tongue had melted away with his vision.
or refusal. For this reason, the extravagant gift often takes the form of a

. Hadn't it really been that simple?
'Okay, sure, I crossed a line, I get it.' He snapped, when he couldn't take the lecture any more. 'But I just like, put a toe across it, you're the one who used it as the start line of the long jump!'
'Bucky drove us,' Tony said. 'I'll call us a cab home.'
But Stark should have been here. He was half an hour late already, and Steve had a feeling he wasn't going to show. Maybe he had thought Steve was going to insist on going ahead with the marriage so was getting out while he could. Maybe Steve should have just let his mom explain, and not have scheduled this meeting at all. Or maybe Howard Stark had found out about the bargain and was going to force his son into going through with it; and neither of them respected Steve's time enough to ensure the meeting happened on time.
flower, is there?’
Steve could only be grateful that when the finger print had appeared on his skin when he was seventeen – four years later than average, of course, when he thought he had gotten away with it – it had come out on the back of his neck. If he wore collared shirts and let his hair get a little long and shaggy, he could just about cover it. Only about ten percent of the population got a mark like that, meaning there was another ten percent out there who were unblemished, wandering around not knowing that someone else was carrying their finger print on their skin, a mark that would respond and come alive only to their touch. Less than a quarter of people had anything to do with any of it, which meant your chances of finding your other half were infinitely small. These days, most people just thought the pairings were coincidence anyway. If you asked people, hardly anyone believed they were the sign of soulmates any more.
'Tony,' Steve said, but he wasn't sure why. He did need Stark to leave round the back, and soon, before the whole Timely was up and about to see him go. Except he didn't
'Oh good.' Steve sighed and slung his shield onto his back. 'Always a good day when you fight the Skrulls.'
'Aww, honey, still? Well, there's some new faces in the house tonight, maybe you'll get lucky. And what about you, sugar?' She turned to Bucky, twirling a dark green band around her long-nailed fingers. 'You're not going to make me give you the band of shame again, are you?'
'Used to,' Natasha mumbled. 'Before... before.'
. So we still need
Just then, Peter fell back flat onto his back on the bed. Steve looked at him, saw how quickly his chest was rising and falling, and ripped the helmet off him. Peter was beaming beneath it, wheezing, but eyes bright with excitement.
Steve was in the forties, still tiny, his breath hitching asthmatically. He was in space, he was under the sea, he was tall, he was short, he was old, he was young, he worked in a coffee shop, he was a student, he was a rockstar, a spy, he was Iron Man, Spiderman, the Sorceror Supreme, Hydra Supreme -
It was a stupid move. He'd seen bullets bounce off this thing; no matter how straight and true his aim was, Venom wasn't going to be hurt. And yet, he must have caught the thing off guard because the impact sent it flying, rolling over itself, the tentacled mass receding into something more man-shaped. Steve caught the shield as it came back to him, went to try for another hit, but before he could Venom was already back on his feet, snarling.
(trigger warning for a brief passing mention of suicide and a focus on homophobic/biphobic attitudes in the past. This chapter only.)
, over and over, yes to everything, to all of it, and they were going to get
'There must have been some sort of mistake,' Steve said. 'We're not looking for a Deputy here.' He unlocked the door and held it open. 'Have a seat, Mr Odinson. I'll go and get to the bottom of this.'
For the first time in his life, Peter pushed him away. Steve let go. He had no idea what he should do.
, looking up at the store instead. 'What exactly is bubble tea, anyway?'
Steve was embarrassed, but Tony couldn't work out what he felt. There was some awkwardness, sure, because Steve wasn't his dad, wasn't really anyone except his Shield-appointed guard, but... no-one had ever said that to Tony before. Ever. He'd done precious little for anyone to be proud of, but now Captain America was proud of him.
So, bubble tea. It was perfect; if he got one of the yoghurt-y ones it would be almost like food and drink at the same time. And it wouldn't take much swallowing, which he wasn't sure he was up to at the moment.
He wiped his nose one last time and then his eyes for good measure and stood up. He was done crying. It was time to get out of here.
life.
'Helped,' Tony croaked, pulling on the arm pressed to his windpipe and failing to move it an inch.
'You look great,' Steve said, earnestly, brushing a little dust off Tony's shoulder, just as an excuse to touch him.
. Still, Steve hated using it, not when Tony was trying so hard to break the habit. Not when Steve had been making it worse without even knowing. He couldn't live with that for another second, so he added, 'Wouldn't want Deputy Odinson to have to arrest you his first day on the job.'
Tony looked at him, wondering how he could get him to understand that
'Is it just the wall-climbing thing? Or will he have other powers?'
'Why don't you try one of these instead?' she asked, indicating a jar of bright green ones instead. The label read
Steve did not
Steve coloured and tipped his hat to her, moving quickly on. There was no way she could have mistaken him for Tony, not with a foot of height between them. She was just making a point about him being there so early in the morning, staying there.
'What?'
'James,' Barnaby said, his voice rough and sad and oh, Steve wished he had just used his real damn name, 'I...' he sighed, a noise of pain and frustration that made Steve's heart break.
. In this world, he knew, he did believe, simply and solidly, that they were meant to be. That his whole journey through the ice was for this exact reason, to bring him here to her. So they were married. They were happy. Their love was equivalent, perfectly balanced. It burned inside him like a sun.
Except now Thor was unusually quiet, looking back and forth between them, suspicion clouding his features. Tony left Steve's side to slap Thor on the back congenially. He'd built up quite a friendship with the Deputy, having been disposed to like him from the beginning because of the workload and risk he'd taken off Steve. Oftentimes if Steve was late back for lunch he'd find the two of them laughing and conversing easily together.
Clint smiled. 'Great,' he said. Then he reached forward and hugged them both. 'You're not on your own,' he said. 'I promise, we'll all help you. But Peter needs you.'
'You're drunk,' the cold voice said. The surgeon. 'Have some respect. I'm going to fetch more bandages, and you'd best be gone when I return.'
'So what are you going to do?'
After a long wait, here is the next chapter; aka 'One Day I Will Learn to Write Backstory: But Not Today'. I feel like this could have filled a full fic on its own, but never mind. It's time to introduce some Spiderman-based worldbuilding to this show, although - fair warning -  I'm going to be playing fast and loose with film/comic canon.
Which is why, months later, she still wasn't back on the contraceptive pill; because thinking about
‘They’re stubborn, you can’t get rid of them.’
‘I thought you probably lied to your mom about doing some chore,’ Steve said, suddenly wondering why he had assumed that. Possibly because, after forgetting to take the trash out the night before, he had snuck it out this morning but told his ma that
'Steve, I...' he wanted to tell him he didn't know how to get home, that if Steve left him he'd end up as a vagrant forever, but he couldn't. He'd already surrendered most of his dignity. Steve already thought he was some beardy, smelly mess. He couldn't make things any worse.
Steve mentally shrugged and went back to watching TV. The Dodgers were shit this year, but what was new. There was more clattering in the kitchen and muffled cursing.
“I didn’t, not one bit. I sat on the couch. The rest of the team made and then cleaned up dinner and I didn’t help. I made out with my boyfriend and gossiped with friends. No Captain America things.”
Tony crossed Yinsens’ arms across his chest and brushed the hair out of his face. He zipped his jacket all the way up to the top to hide the cut, and it almost looked like he was ok. He covered him in one of the blankets from the backpacks and swung the bag over his shoulder and picked up a walking stick. Overhead the motors of a hovercraft roared, slowly descending to pick up the body.
There was a moment of silence, as Tony picked at the sheets and Steve did his best to ignore him.
“I'm afraid I don't have the information available to answer that.”
After the coup, Tony had been dumped in the center of the mining camp along with everyone else in the government who had refused to submit and were still alive. There weren’t many, most having been executed at the castle as an example to others, and most of the rest dying of their wounds before they could start the journey. Tony held on to life with a iron force of will, lasting long enough to reach the capable hands of Yinsen, a castle doctor who had been banished with the rest when he refused to treat Loki’s men. Though his spirit was strong, his flesh was weak, and no matter how tightly his wound was bandaged Tony continued to bleed and his heart beat faded. Once they reached the camp people gathered around them. The camp was made up of prisoners, forced to do grueling work in the dangerous mines. They recognized Tony, from the carts that he had built them that saved them so much time and effort hauling rock. They had been willing to spare a battery from one of those carts, and Yinsen was able to set it deep into the wound and save him.
Tony woke up to the sound of a cannon firing. His eyes shot open and he pushed himself up so quickly the world spun and bile rose in his throat. He leaned against the cornucopia and looked around the clearing. It was empty except for five coats, one of which had been draped across Tony’s chest like a blanket. The snow had encroached further into the clearing, and it was now only a few feet from the cornucopia before the heat radiating off the giant metal structure melted it. Tony ran around the cornucopia, searching for footprints, trying to guess which direction they went. Between the wind and snow, there was nothing. How long had he been out? Minutes? Hours? A day? Who had the cannon been for? Another cannon blast sounded.
Tony nodded and sat beside him, flipping on the TV. Steve let his eyes unfocus and the sounds wash over him, enjoying a chance to sit with Tony. Nothing else he needed to be doing, nothing they still needed to talk about. Just….contentment. Tony safe and sound beside him, tucked away in their home, with the rest of the team laughing and messing around in the kitchen. Peter brought out a bowl of popcorn for them and they both thanked him. Steve watched him light up and bounce back to the others.
“A bad sign, I know, whatever. Maybe I wanted to do something nice, ok? I’ll see you in a bit.”
Tony sat back in his chair. No matter what happened next, the defenses were down and the rebels were in.
“We’re planning an escape in a few days, you can lead us to the rest of the resistance.”
“Tony,” Steve said gently. “We don't know what's going on and we can't risk hurting the hostage. Please let me try to talk it out, I'll use the old captain America charm, yeah? And the second he makes a threatening move you do your thing and come in guns a blazing. Just trust me.”
“Friends?”
For the rest of the week he dreamed of being sent into the games, and trying to run away before being caught and forced to the ground, the district boy looming over him, chopping off his hand or bashing in his head. It was months before he stopped waking up in the middle of the night screaming, and the next year they all came back, him dying over and over at night after spending the day watching in graphic detail every possible way to die.
“I should have all the tools I need already. With luck I’ll be done in four, maybe five hours.”
His hands were bleeding and nothing was breaking through the thick shell of the armor. Cold wind blew at his back. Below him the armor laughed, the sound distorted through the speakers into a growling screech of static.
“I need to give me a tour of all the spots you talked about in the book.”
They refused him silently, blocking his way.
“I’m here now. And I’m not leaving until both you and Lord Stark and every other traitor in your coup is dead by my blade.”
The man shook him off. “I need you to come with me. The President wants to see you.”
“If it makes you feel better, they’re not all real people.” Tony added. “Some are bots. I don’t have the heart to block them, they’re doing their best at what they were programmed to do... Which is spamming my DMs with links to sketchy porn websites, unfortunately. Anyways, lunch? Or dunch? That’s a mix between dinner and lunch, because its 3 in the afternoon and I’m starving.”
Steve’s mind was reeling. “Why?” He asked, trying to process the monumental news and figure out if it was true.
“And he is nothing more than a mad dog-”
“Halt! What are you doing up here?” The guard asked loudly.
“I’m not dead.”
“I’m not fighting anybody.” Steve was suddenly so tired he felt like he could barely stand. He trudged back to the truck, and collapsed in the back in the bed. The sky was annoyingly bright and blue above him, and the warmth of the truck bed sunk through his shirt into his back. He could hear his pack having a discussion a few yards away, their words muffled by both distance and his lack of care. No matter what they said, they couldn’t change anything. Steve closed his eyes. He could feel his hands shake a little with after fight jitters. He flexed the hand Tony had stepped on. Wondered if it would bruise. The bites from their par had been playful. This injury, Tony had meant to hurt. He heard footsteps approach the car, and it shook side to side as everyone got in. The engine started, and they started the long drive home.
And before they knew it, it had been over an hour of them just enjoying lunch, and not fighting. They got up and left the restaurant, and walked back to the tower.
“Alright, what'd he do???” He yelled with glee. His hair was fluffed up in wild curls, and he was in an old t-shirt, stained with soot from head to toe. Plus for the first time since they had met, he was smiling. Of course it was at his expense, but...it was maybe kind of nice. Not that he cared. Because he hated him. And he was making a mess in his house.
“Don't get starstruck, you need to milk this for all it's worth. Do you think there's anything the Queen wouldn't do for a crown jewel?”
Tony was shivering violently at this point, from cold or from shock he didn’t know. Yinsen helped him closer to the fire.
“No, this is good, this is progress. I thought we were going to have to wait until you were both eighty before you made a move. Maybe you'd dare to kiss him on your fifty year anniversary.”
Right, now was not the time for clock smashing. It was time for sweet sweet
Footage of him drugged up at the second interview.
“Probably not. That’s in case I need them later.”
Within minutes they reached the scene of the attack. Tony shut off the controls, got up and walked towards the group, his metal boots making echoing thuds.
“I usually stayed inside too, my asthma was much worse when I was younger. That was when I started getting into drawing.”
There was a silence over the comms then Cap said, “You're fighting the birds, aren't you,” in a resigned tone.
Yinsen nodded. “I will help you hide this for as long as I can. Raza is not the sort of man who should be gifted with weapons.”
“Tony! Tony! Tony!”
At Steve’s blank look the man sighed. “Nobody ever responds to my letters.” He shook it off and was soon back to a model of polite professionalism. “All of the wolves who worked on the serum Stane had will need to be investigated and possibly put to trial, as well as the task force who murdered your pack. We’ll be in touch.”
“Look, everything is fine, Tony and I had a little fight, no big deal. You don’t need to worry.” he tried to reassure them. Jan handed him a washcloth filled with ice, and he held it up to a scratch on his arm to appease her. He was totally fine. He just needed to convince his over anxious packmates of that, who were clucking around him just like the hens outside.
Tony looked at the TV as it showed the contestants riding in on their chariots. In the corner the word ‘LIVE’ blinked brightly.
Bucky let go of his arm like he was burned, and Steve brushed past him to go into his room. It wasn’t until he turned to shut the door and saw Bucky’s shocked look that he realized that Bucky was now left thinking either he lied and was eating alone in his room, or that Tony was sleeping with him. Which was technically true, but not in the sense his brother would assume. He could already hear Bucky telling him that he was in too deep, that he had lost perspective. He shut the door with a sigh.
Tony slid down the way to sit on the floor, holding his shoulder. Fifteen minutes later the peacekeeper let Tony back in. He immediately looked at the glass, shimmering with water droplets where it had been freshly washed.
“There you go! No yelling.”
Jarvis didn't have feelings in quite the same way as the humans he watched over, but he still felt unhappy as he broke the quiet camaraderie of the morning with bad news.
“Oh God, here we go again. It wasn’t your all your fault. I should have brought up the accords to you much earlier, and there isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t regret attacking your friend. It had been a long day, Ross was threatening me, then I got one shock after another and I exploded. I’m sorry.”
Tony had always known he was going to die someday, but right now it was staring him in the face. There were so many things he had never gotten to do. Would Rhodey miss him? Would Obie? Or did they both think he was a traitor? How could Obie do this to him? He was supposed to be family.
Meanwhile, Stane was trying to yell out explanations to the crowd, who were milling around in a panic over the sudden confrontation. “Everyone knows that the Roger pack doesn’t take the suppression shots, they shifted uncontrollably and turned on each other as wolves. You all saw the papers on the wolf attacks! Now they’re wild with grief, a danger to everyone around them. They need to be put down like the out of control monsters they are. Guards!”
“You’re coming back from the hallway where the accords half of the team is staying at six in the morning in your sleep clothes. I’ll tell you right now, it might feel good in the short term but sex with an ex is never a good idea.”
On the other side of the line Rhodey snorted. “No you won’t. I gotta go, don’t want to get in trouble for not listening to the broadcast.”
“The suit is only at 50% of its normal functionality after your last battle with the aforementioned bugs, and repairs will take at least another six hours.” Jarvis warned, his disapproval clear. “Perhaps you should let your team take care of this one until you are restored to full functionality.”
Steve leaned over the side of the plane and kissed him. “I love you too, Tony.”
“He’s staying?”
Tony stood and shoved the wings back into Sam’s arms. “I’m not fighting with Steve. He’s a little tense from the battle and he always has a harder time controlling his strength when he’s worked up. I’ll pay for any glasses he breaks. And Brian? I don’t understand what he has to do with anything. I'm flirting a little, I'm a flirty person, it’s fun. Don’t worry about it.”
“I found a new source on Brooklyn.” Tony gestured at the man who was standing in line next to Clint at the restaurant. Steve grabbed his arm.
Tony nodded frantically as they fingered their weapons. “I have a compass. And a blanket. I’m very useful.”
Steve glared at her, and Tony gaped at them. Was the dragon...talking? Vanko must have hit him harder than he thought. Steve leaned him against her side, and went to the mine to encourage the others to come out. Rhodey and Pepper looked at Tony, and after he waved they lead the others back out where they cautiously stared at the dragon. She flicked her tail at them playfully, and a few people jumped back with gasps. Steve sat down next to Tony and crossed his arms.
Whatever Steve had drawn was gone.
The notary prompted him. “Your vows?”
He was not nice. He hadn’t signed Tony’s papers then they had a big fight.
“I need one last spot. Where would you go if you needed to impress someone really special and you only had one chance to avoid ruining everything?”
He left himself fall back down to the ground, the peppery scent of the leaves filling his nose, the cool ground leeching the heat from his bruises. Steve sat down beside him and cupped Tony’s head in both hands, tilting his face up so he could see his eyes. Steve sighed and wiped his thumbs under Tony’s eyes to clear away the tears. He hadn’t realized that he was crying. Steve moved so that Tony’s head was resting in his lap, and his back was against a tree. He stroked a hand through Tony’s hair and the soothing repetitive strokes had Tony’s eyes drooping.
“They really included the lion in with the list of Commandos?”
“You can post it. I’m just surprised. It's dark and blurry, and riding a carousel isn’t cool. Don’t you have an image to maintain?”
“We DO live like this! And I’m trying! When something breaks you just call a contractor, but we can’t! Even if we could afford it, I don’t own a fucking phone! When something breaks, I fix it, and I’m not a plumber! I don’t know cars or furnaces or anything! I was never supposed to be in charge, I never wanted to be in charge, and now I am, so I’m doing the best I fucking can!”
Tony was mildly offended. “Hey, I’m doing pretty well for myself. You’re the one who needed rescuing. You’re welcome, by the way. You can stay in my cave until the fires burn out. I disabled the flamethrowers nearby so this area should stay relatively safe except for the smoke in the air.”
“Tony-”
Natasha glared at him from across the jet. “Well, maybe second best.” He amended hastily. “Definitely best archer though.”
“I’m saying goodbye, Steve. The first few months, when we struggled and fought and learned to get along, where we made it a little farther each day… Those were some of the best days of my life. I fell in love with you, and I got to watch you fall in love with me, over and over, every day for years. Then we stopped making progress. When we get along, we never make it past the cabin. So, I switched to other strategies. I got you to hate me. It goes better when we fight. We’re both sharper, angrier, more violent. A 12% increase in the speed of our runs, an extra three miles of distance.
As Tony walked off Steve paused. He needed to knock it off with the declarations of love now that Tony wanted to be friends only. But he had agreed to loving him and called him Buttercup? Mixed signals. Maybe things weren't as hopeless as he thought. Maybe he still had a chance.
Tony scoffed, but inside he could feel it too. Something inside him was always pulling towards Steve, and he felt bereft when he got far enough away that he couldn’t feel anyone else as a soothing presence inside his head. Even before he had met the dragon and solidified the bond, he had instinctively trusted Steve, even when he had no reason to. Steve handed him a flower, and Tony examined it.
Tony nodded and abandoned his carrots. They walked back into the hall and stopped a few feet out of the kitchen, facing each other. Tony gave him a concerned look. “Is everything alright? Did you run into trouble getting here?”
When the white receded from his vision, Steve was still on his knees next to him. He was alright, as far as Tony could tell. He yanked the Gauntlet off Tony's hand and after a horrified glance at Tony's right arm, his fingers were on the sides of Tony's face, peering into his eyes. Tony thought Carol held on to the gauntlet for them, and that was okay. Steve's hands on his face were rough, but Tony felt the warmth of them through Steve's fingerless gloves.
At lunch, he brought his tray back to his office. Tony was a young CEO. A brilliant engineer, taking Stark Industries easily into the modern era.  He shored up contracts from the government, private companies. The weapons division grew, as it had under Howard.  He only had a single, thick file left when May came to collect him.
“Nat?”
They tossed around names while the kitten ate an entire plate of chicken.  Thor thought they should name it Loki, and Tony could get behind that, since it was an asshole, and so was Loki.  Natasha called the kitten something in Russian, but none off the rest of them knew what it meant or could pronounce it.  Bruce didn’t feel like adding any names to the pot, and Clint wanted to name him Clint, which they all vetoed.  Finally Steve thought, since he was found in the Stradale, they could name him Romeo.  He turned pink when he offered up the name, but the team just teased him for being such a sentimentalist.
God it was so good to hear his voice. He sounded tired, but Steve had never been so relieved.  “Tony, I’m so glad I got ahold of you!”
The kitten seemed relatively particular, hissing at Thor, but cuddling up to Bruce and Natasha just fine.  He largely ignored Clint. Thor thought maybe kittens didn’t like beings from another realm.  Natasha suggested perhaps Thor needed a shower.  Bruce just put down a plate of shredded chicken, agreeing that they needed to find a name.  A real name.  Clint largely ignored him, claiming he was a dog person.
Steve stood up and went to the sink.  There weren’t very many dishes to be done, but he carefully washed each one and set them in the rack.  Then he picked up a new towel, wiped each dish, and put it away in the cabinet.  He reordered the porcelain mugs so that they were all facing down, handles turned toward the front right corner of the cabinet.  Easy for all of them to grab.
“Tones, get a grip,” Rhodey hissed at him, nodding toward Tony’s still open mouth.
They parted ways, Tony taking the elevator to the penthouse, Steve heading for his suite.  Tony fell asleep that night studiously not thinking about Steve and his glorious sunshine smile and his kind eyes and his mischievous sense of humor and his careful dexterous hands, and his amazing…
“Good,” she said, distractedly.
Tony lost control, breath sharp as he came.  He grabbed a rag and a wet wipe.  Thank god he kept those around in the workshop.  Cleaning himself up, he calmed his breathing.  Tossed both the rag and the wipe into the trash bin.
“I was trying to tell her, but she doesn’t believe me,” Natasha began smoothly.
Steve made his way down to the workshop, then knocked politely on the glass. He could see Mr. Stark inside, work gloves on, soldering gun smoking.  A robot arm held a piece of metal and another seemed to be holding a watering can. Steve waited for a minute.  But Mr. Stark appeared not to have heard.  He knocked again, a little louder.  Still nothing.
“Sexy catwoman Halloween costume?”
She smiled at him.  “That will be all, Mr. Stark.”
“Flying,
Jarvis spoke quietly. “Would you like me to call Mr. Stark, Captain?”
Tony was engaged in conversation with a scientist that Steve vaguely recognized as being involved in the Paris Agreements. Tony’s eyes reflected the lighting gently, laugh lines creasing the edges of his eyes when he smiled.  Steve caught himself staring and reminded himself he was there to work.  He was close enough to hear the conversation clearly, but listened with only half a mind.  He was sort of responsible for Happy’s job, too, given that Mr. Hogan was in San Francisco with his sister.  Not that anyone was likely to attack Tony in the middle of a gala, but Mr. Hogan had been very specific.  Barton would drive, and Steve would cover Tony inside the party. He wasn’t sure Mr. Hogan would ever truly like him.  But maybe this was a chance to win him over, prove he was helpful, that he’d protect Tony.
“Clearly you never took the sexual harassment training from SHIELD,” Tony broke in, unable to restrain himself. “See, that’s a bad touch right there, Rudolph.” Loki was really running with the horns thing, apparently.
Miss Potts looked at the empty dishes in his hands.  “Did you bring Tony lunch? In his workshop? And he ate it?” Her voice rose on each sentence.
Tony gave what tried to be a smile.  “Sleep tight, Steve.” He shut the door.
I know this is sort of an outlier, in style.
for human experimentation. Test subject.  That was
“Did you already call in the order?” he asked.
Jarvis had said he’d run some simulations, but Tony knew it would work. It would. Everything was in its place.  He’d have to pull power from all three backup generators, but they were fully fueled and he’d already rechecked the power grid.  Power was not going to be a problem. He had Steve’s book lying open on a workbench.  Inspiration.  Sure, he could just have Jarvis project the image for him, but having the tangible book, Steve’s initials painstakingly sharpied on the cover… In a pathetic little way, it was like a piece of Steve was still there with him.  He knew it was stupid.  He pulled the leather gloves back on and checked the coils one last time.
“Steve!” Nat called after him, but he was already halfway down the stairs, keys in hand.  It should take about forty minutes to get to Manhattan, but he thought he could do it in closer to twenty on the bike.
Steve turned away from Tony to face his friend directly.  Tony couldn’t help himself.  He noticed the set of his shoulders, ready for the confrontation, and the extremely shapely ass he would have liked to see under more friendly circumstances.  Barnes noticed him noticing.  But fuck it, he was Tony Stark, and that man had broken into his house.  So he grinned, to let Barnes know that he noticed the noticing.  Notiception! “Buck, you know you can’t do it,” Steve was saying. “Not with that arm…” he trailed off.  Took a deep breath. “And it’s not like I have anything more important going on right now.  It doesn’t matter for me.  It’s the least I can do.”
'It wasn't your fault! This isn't right!'
After just that one paragraph – run on, messy, disjointed and so very
But he was just being paranoid, because ever since he had started on this symbiotic relationship his course of action had always been clear, and now he wasn't sure. Things would return to normal as soon as he finished his plan and made the Captain his, at least for a night or two. Step One towards that end was to fix Peter, who was so little and so kind and so excited by science and idolised Tony and didn't deserve-
Somewhere, he was groaning in agony.
'Sorry, miss,' Osborn said, still looking at Tony. 'I just worry about the damage he'll cause, in here all alone.'
'Sounds great, Bar.'
It was an excellent question, at which point Natasha lost herself completely, laughing hysterically into the cushion, and leaving poor Steve more baffled than ever before. And then, for no reason at all that she could figure out, the laughs turned back to sobs. After a moment, she felt the couch cushions sag by her feet, and then Steve's kind, reassuring hand was making small circles on her back. She concentrated on the movement and said, 'You can have the pill. It stops you getting pregnant but it also... makes all this, better. For most people.'
'Oh!' Tony understood at last. 'Is it my turn? Thanks, baby, that's very kind, but Daddy's too big.'
‘He showed me on here,’ he almost whispered. Steve stared at it.
Steve needed to start thinking about schools. And college funds. And probably a million other things about child rearing that he had never looked at because the fact Peter would never need them had been too painful. Where did he even start?
'Any of it.'
'I was friends with his parents. They put me up after I woke up; I was lodging with them when Peter was born. So after they died...'
'Whatever. Here's the thing. I don't really give a crap who you are, I just want you to marry my son. Make him look wholesome and family friendly. Stop him from creeping out to bars at all hours and, most importantly, show his wankstain ex that Starks can't be messed with, and that we don't need their whore money. So, this medical stuff. What's your life expectancy?'
'You put it on the fridge?' Peter couldn't believe it. Neither, for that matter, could Steve. More than likely, it had been put on just for as long as it took to take the photograph. Still, he appreciated the effort.
'Oh,' Tony said. He had never realised he had a housekeeper, although now that he thought about it, things did have a habit of tidying themselves away when he wasn't looking. He'd honestly never really thought about it. 'You must be new?' He added, hopefully.
‘What are you playing at? I told you, once dinner was over we were done.’
He saw Steve's expression shift to one of reluctant acceptance and pulled his arm free. Then Steve's face changed again, softening as it always did when he thought about his son, and Tony held up a hand to stop him.
Barnaby looked at the sky, then at the ground, then finally at Steve as he shrugged. 'I get it,' he said. 'Honestly, I'm not... exactly...
'Well, if that's what you want to call it.'
'Sap.'
'I hate you,' he informed Steve.
And Steve smirked at him, the bastard, that curl to his lips that meant he thought he was being
Just then the elevator doors opened and his dad came in and started talking.
'He did, did he?' He asked, and laughed. Peter didn't like that laugh. His stomach was tingling worse than ever now. He put the rest of the juice back on the table. 'Well, Peter, you shouldn't listen to everything Mr Stark says. He's a killer.'
. Obviously, everyone knew this song, but it was a great song. He hadn't heard it for ages, years, and he suddenly wondered why. It was a classic song. It was calming, and sort of like a river in and of itself. He could so easily let himself drift away on it, back to sleep, but something in him said no.
'Steve,' Dr Moore said gently. 'You aren't the first grieving parent- sorry, carer- to ask me that. And I'm going to tell you what I tell all of them. First of all, I am very sceptical of the truth about those stories. If they're true, it would have been a medical and scientific marvel. Don't forget, for a long time Captain America was purely a propaganda icon, a marketing device. I wouldn't be surprised if they did that demonstration and the skinny guy got in the pod, slipped through a trap door, and the real soldier took his place. It may well have been sleight of hand, not science.' Steve opened his mouth to protest, but Dr Moore continued as if she hadn't noticed. 'But alright, let's say for the sake of argument that this really did occur, and did work like they say, and cured every illness going, made this guy into the peak of human health and fitness. All documents related to the formula are highly classified. I know because I've checked. And as far as I can tell, they're incomplete. Dr Erskine, the man who allegedly made the formula, supposedly always feared about it falling into enemy hands, and failed to commit vital details to paper. And even if you somehow pieced that together, you would still need these 'vita rays' that were the other half of the equation.'
, you know?”
“It’s already set up, and I arranged for a ride. Shall we?”
“So you assume everything I say is mean? Great. No wonder we have communication issues, every time I mention a movie or use an expression you think it’s an insult. Which is a real problem since I’m 90% pop culture references.”
“Steven Grant Rogers you can't just say that and run away! Get back here!” She yelled in outrage, waving a spoon in the air. He ignored her threats.
So Tony built monuments, Tony built marvels, he built fame and fortunes and Steve watched him do it from the stairs outside the workshop, standing the shadows where the light didn’t reach, his feet cold against the rough concrete floor. Then he went back upstairs, to the room they were supposed to share, with the pictures of them he had framed on the nightstand and the cork board he had covered in mementos from concerts and movies they’d been to, and lied in the cold bed and drowned in the past. Things had only gotten worse from there, eventually Tony started sleeping on the cot in the lab and two months later they tried to kill each other in an airport, and again a few hours later in the bunker.
That was probably the best he was going to get, so Steve moved on. “So. What’s your favorite color?”
“Really, everyone?”
Christine sat down and gave the camera a hundred watt smile. “Alright, that was quite the entrance from our contestants!”
His ears were ringing and his mouth was filled with the coppery taste of blood. “NO!”
“It’s a trap,” Tony realized. “The parachutes are leading Raza to us, we need to run!”
“It’s true! I used to work at the castle.”
“Please. We need your help.” Stane leaned forward in his chair, resting his arms on his desk.
And Meiko says she made it in a loaf pan. Why would she do that? Why not look up a recipe for lemon loaf, if she wanted a loaf? Also she added less sugar then complained that it wasn’t sweet enough. Whose fault is that, Meiko?”
Though he still couldn’t see him, from his hand on his arm he could feel him shrug and turn away. “Nothing, it’s nothing.”
“Steve Rogers Override Code 23-34-45.”
“Do you know who’s fault it was? Why the team is split up? Why Bucky isn’t here? Why Tony hates you?”
Steve didn't say anything.
Whatever it was, all references to it had been scrubbed from the hyper-sanitized search system the Capital citizens were allowed to use.
, and Thor kept his mouth shut because his own record with keeping the Tower in one piece was less than stellar. Falcon was boasting that he hadn't destroyed the Tower, not even once, and Natasha brought up how sad that was that they considered that an accomplishment. Clint joked that it was Natasha's turn to ruin it, and she should hurry up because he had some great ideas for his second go around. Tony threatened that if they blew up his beautiful tower one more time he was kicking them out on the streets.
“Thank you. I owe you a great debt.”
Tony’s voice grew distant. “I don’t know what’s wrong, I’m flying him to the hospital…..no...I’ll deal with it later...yes...watch out for Peter...yeah…”
'What wedding?' Widow asked from across the room. 'What, did you guys mislay my invitation?'
to, who else did? Who had he told? Did it even need to be told or was it obvious? They'd been so careful. Tony squeezed his arm comfortingly, looking characteristically unconcerned. His expression calmed Steve a little.
But now, he wanted to stand out. He wanted Osborn to know exactly who he had crossed and what he was facing. Most importantly, Steve wanted the shield. It was sitting in the bottom of the chest, shining as if it had been lovingly polished just hours before, waiting for him to pick it up.
Peter huffed loudly and rolled back onto his back, but even that didn't get his dad's attention. He was
'N-no,' Peter said, trying to take deep breaths so the crying would stop. 'I-it was just me and Mr Osborn and Harry.'
Tony nodded and they started to head for the doors, but then, Tony's screen blacked out. The suit whirred, powering down, and fell off him in segments, even as he made to grab at it. He pulled the helmet off himself, trying to see what was happening. What he saw was one of the guards, one of the hundred they had knocked out that day, obviously concious, standing at one of the computer terminals, looking very pleased with himself.
'Shield is going to help them,' the lady said, and Peter noticed she had a gun on her hip. 'But I need you to go inside with Agent Meason and wait.'
The three of them stared at it.
' Tony repeated, exasperated, knocking lightly on the bandages over Steve's chest. 'Thor set it up. I think he's been looking for something like this for a while. You know, where we're such good
'Great, deal, problem solved!' Bucky said, enthusiastically, beaming at Steve. 'This totally counts as you selling a painting for a million bucks.'
'I was hoping you would wake,' it said. 'Turn him around!'
It was dark in the broom cupboard, and there wasn't much space. Peter sat huddled on the floor, under the coats and surrounded by shoes, his knees pulled up under his chin, wiping the last bits of his drippy nose on his jeans. He wasn't going to cry any more. His dad had saved him, and now he would save Mr Stark, and he would definitely come back.
Only just remembering to excuse himself, Steve followed Ms Potts out into the hallway and hesitated at the bottom of the stairs. He wanted to run up them – he felt like he
'We aren't talking about underwear!' Pepper yelled. 'We are talking about how
'I'm not saying I was ready to give it to you,' Steve said. 'But I saw it last time we were in Dehli. I thought it would be perfect for you, so I bought it. Just in case.'
Steve raised an eyebrow. 'What, you think the 21
'So, you're going to get married just to avoid embarrassing Thor?' Natasha asked.
'No! I want to, I really want to, I just...' Steve trailed off miserably. '...I'm not free to.'

Bucky snorted a laugh. 'Can't argue with that.'

Sarah had agonised over making a good impression, trying on outfit after outfit, testing out everything she owned or could borrow in every possible combination before she settled on one. She got up an hour early to do her hair and make up, and Steve had sat on her bed, watching her apply it all, trying to ignore the weight of guilt filling up his stomach. So much for providing for himself. His mom still had to do everything for him.
'Soon.'
, and how Mr Stark wouldn't let any other kids have the medicine. He looked at Mr Osborn's outstretched hand. The moment seemed to go on forever.
', followed by the greatest blow-out party 'i
‘Steve, say something.’ Tony commanded, still sounding terrified. Steve wished he could calm him down. Explain this happened all the time. Well, not all the time, but enough. Pretty routine.
It was dark inside. Something moved.
'Fine,' Tony said, grudgingly. 'If you are very, very good for the next fifty to sixty years and
Steve looked almost ready to cry again. 'Bucky...'
Steve had wanted to cry at that, but he didn't, because Richard broke down at that point and Steve needed to keep things together for his friend. And that was how the day that Peter was born ended.
'Are you actually going to pay her?' Tony asked. For some reason it was all he could think of to ask.
'Electrical failure,' Jarvis said, in its same neutral voice, empty of expression. Unable to believe his luck, Peter kept climbing. Every so often, Jarvis reminded him 'You are intruding,' but now that he didn't have anything to use as a threat, Peter didn't mind so much. It was a good distraction from how high he was.
'You don't like kids? You seemed to get on with Pete.'
Steve seemed to be weighing his options. Finally he shrugged and said, 'Alright, fine. How did you find out?'
'How many are there?' Cap called, taking out six with one neat swing of his shield.
They were marching him towards the closet door. The youngest of their little band of merry men, looking as if he was barely more than a child and as if he knew he was in way over their head, was standing holding the padlock and key with shaking hands. Following a barked order from his superior, he opened the lock, pulled away the chains and bars, and wrenched the door open.
'Perish the thought,' Tony said, solemnly, trying not to giggle. He was remembering some footage he'd seen of the time the Howling Commandoes were invited for dinner at the White House, and the President had made a welcoming speech, had asked Steve to step forward – only to find out that none of them had turned up, as the administration had refused to allow Gabe Jones to use the front entrance with the others. It had been so hilariously awkward as the President tried to brush it off and sidle away.
Slowly, Tony removed his jacket, shirt and tie. There was no rush, and they would only get creased if he didn't lay them just so across the back seat. Once he had stripped down to nothing but his flight suit, he reached beneath his seat for the briefcase that disguised the Iron Man armour.
Three months later he received his copy, Pepper putting it on his desk. He spun the book around to look at the cover. He didn’t remember taking the picture, it must have been from an older press shoot. He looked good, his teeth white and his face tan as he stood in front of a photoshopped beach. He shoved it in a drawer of his desk. He’d read it eventually. Right now Pepper had things for him to sign.
Steve pushed Tony's chair back down on four legs, unamused. “We can't go supersonic in city limits, last time the mayor just about popped a gasket. And this time you're riding with us on the jet, even if that means handcuffing you and tying you to the top.”
“I apologize for the trouble I have put you all through. I swore to protect the people of this realm, and have instead ruined your escape plan.”
More music played, and on the screen above, Hammer appeared. He looked frazzled, though he was trying to hide it. “One final message before we sign off for tonight. Tampering with Capital equipment or trying to break out of the arena or into non-regulation areas is strictly forbidden. This was not clearly stated in the rules before now, so no punishment was awarded.”
“That’s the problem, it shouldn’t feel like that.”
“If I’m more famous than Beyonce then I don’t have time for reading, now do I?” Tony said. “Why do you care?”
Steve opened his eyes and sat up. He was outside a white mansion in what looked like the older part of New York. He got up, brushed off his pants and looked around. The streets were empty so he decided to knock on the door of the mansion. It was opened by a tall man who greeted him in an eerily familiar voice.
Steve glanced over Tony’s head at Clint and Jan who were looking at him in shock and horror. “Probably not. But since that was your family ring, I think we’re even. We'll get them back. Now let’s get out of here, you have a computer to buy.”  Sure it had been a gift from his Ma and it had originally been his Pa’s, but somehow he couldn’t find a way to regret it. He liked to think they would be proud of his choice. The three of them got into the truck and Steve drove them the short trip to the supermarket. Steve pulled into the parking lot, and Tony hopped out of the truck and helped Jan and Clint out.
His fingers hovered over the keyboard. He typed the best description of it that he could, and hit enter.
“He told me he was going to give Britain a lift and be back soon” Steve said through gritted teeth. “We need to hunt down Britain. Either he took Tony, or he’s the last person to have seen him.” He knew that that guy was no good! And now Tony was
Steve had always considered himself a good man. He assisted the elderly across the street and watched out for children, he kept to his word and was always ready to drop everything to help out a friend in an emergency. He didn’t lie, cheat, or steal, no matter how bad things had gotten back in the depression. He used to smoke, but as soon as he learned that it could give people cancer he quit one of the few comforting habits he had left in the new century to set a good example for all the kids who looked up to Captain America. He had even filmed a series of cheesy PSA videos for public high schools. The team teased him for it, but if they helped even one kid turn their life around than it was worth it. Might as well use the almost mythic proportions of the title of ‘Captain America’ for some good.
Tony left his head fall forward so their foreheads were touching. “I missed you too. Very, very much.”
He had never experienced this constant dull pain, that ebbed and flowed and lurked like a monster in the back of his mind. Every time someone touched his foot it lit up with sharp sparks, and he didn’t know how to handle it, didn’t know how anyone handled it. His face still hurt from where he had been hit too. How long were things supposed to take to heal? Days? Weeks? Months? Tony genuinely didn’t know.
(See the end of the chapter for
Closed, opened. The sun started to set, casting the room in shadows, then the inevitable darkness. Steve was still in his clothes from yesterday. He must have gotten up to pee. He couldn’t remember it. He felt more tired now than he had at the start of the morning, and though he knew intellectually that he should be hungry, he couldn’t feel it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Did you ever look into what Yinsen was really working on after he switched departments?” He spat at Tony through broken teeth. “He talked a good game about peace, love, and harmony, but at the end of the day his skill set was in biological weapons, and he rolled over and did what I said the second I threatened to kick his family out of the pack. He wasn’t working on suppressants, he was working to make the wolf inside stronger. Too bad he started turning you into a hippie and had to be put down.”
Steve lead them to the nearest restaurant that was still open and serving food. One of the windows in the front was damaged, but it was otherwise unaffected by the attack. A waitress lead them to a table, where Tony helped Brian into a chair and sat beside him, tossing his gauntlets on the table with a clang.
The weather stayed cold, and the occasional snowflakes drifted down, covering the ground in a thin layer of white. The snow muffled sound, and the forest was silent except for their breathing. They didn’t cross paths with anyone, and didn’t see any footprints. There were so few people left, and the arena was a huge place. They reached the cornucopia around midday, and in the center of the arena there was no wind or snow, like the eye at the center of a storm. The wind picked up again as soon as they stepped out of the clearing and into the trees, and they both shivered in their thin coats. The stream was near the cornucopia on the east side and they had no trouble finding it. Steve knelt down to drink, and Tony fell to his knees beside him. He leaned forward and froze, the sound of the water filling his ears like tidal wave. His breath seemed to catch in his throat, and the taste of mud filled his mouth. He scrambled backwards on his hands and knees, stumbling to his feet and turning his back to the water. He pressed his head to a tree and closed his eyes. He was fine, Raza wasn’t here. If he tried to get a drink no one was going to force him under. Behind him he heard Steve get up and he felt a cautious hand on his shoulder. “Tony?”
Tony hunched his shoulders up, pushing Steve’s hand off. “I’m not thirsty.”
“I never know what to do when you’re like this. Maybe talking to Clint would fix it?”
Tony stared at the wall, and halfheartedly tried to rub a bit of soot off his palm. “I have a point to this. Or at least I was trying to reach a point. I don’t think it worked. Nothing much seems to work around here.”
“Anthony, heir to the Stark pack, do you take Steven of the Rogers pack as your lawfully wedded husband, and chosen mate, surrendering all claims to your old pack?”
Tony hit the big green ‘revive’ button and waited with baited breath as the tubes started to drain, the liquid flowing out through tick tubes. The room started to warm, the frost on the glass turning into water droplets and sliding down the sides of the tubes. Tony starled backwards as Natasha slammed her hand into the side of the tube. He looked down the control panel and hit the open button. Natasha stumbled out of her tube first, with the others seconds behind. Steve was the last to step out, unsteady and shivering violently. Tony ran forward and pulled him into a hug, not caring as the slime soaked into his clothes and smeared across his neck and Steve hugged him back.
Thanks for reading! Please enjoy a cliff hanger 😈
“You found the money?” The banker was shocked. “That’s not possible-”
“For the Capital too.”
“And if I don’t? You’ll do what? Put me back in the games?” Tony started to laugh, a harsh wheezing thing, cut off as the peacekeeper hit him in the face. The peacekeeper grabbed him by the arm and dragged him along the ground and threw him in the chair. Tony bent over, holding a hand to his eye, still laughing under his breath. Beside him Hammer had gone white as a sheet. Tony could practically see the perception of the peacekeepers being there to keep everyone safe falling away. Tony put his hand down so Hammer could see the full glory of his swollen eye.
“It better be. You know Tony isn’t going to react well to being woken up, so if you’re planning a little ‘heart to heart’ then it would be better if you did it at any other time. Go down the left hallway, third door. Don’t wake me up again unless the world is ending.”
“I’m nothing like you,” Tony insisted. “I made Game Master at 18! The President is practically my dad! I’m going great places, I’ve got my whole life ahead of me.”
Steve hesitantly took Tony’s hand. “I’m more open to things than people think. The most important part is having the right partner.”
Tony rubbed his face. “Great. I’m glad a few slices of pizza were worth getting blown up over.” He threw out his arms in exasperation. “What were you thinking? You weren’t cleared to fight and I had to spend the last two hours on the phone trying to get the department of defense to agree not to arrest you! I told you to stay home!”
When they got back they slipped in the way they came out. The cart was missing from the line, and there would be interrogations and possibly beatings tomorrow if the overseer noticed. It couldn’t be helped, it was too heavy to be pushed, especially with Steve. Tony laid Steve down and checked his bandages. Blood darkened the white, indicating that he had popped the stitches. Tony would have to redo them tomorrow when it was light. For now he wrapped another layer of bandages and let him doze off. Tony collapsed on his own bed and tried to get as much sleep as he could before the work bell rang the next morning. Instead his thoughts were plagued with innocents dying and Loki laughing maniacally, waving a sword above his head. Steve appeared, and ran his sword through him, and Loki fell with a gasp as Tony cheered. Then Steve approached, his eyes cold. "You're next."
The pain wasn’t alright, but it was more because Tony wasn’t used to it than because it was debilitating, so he shook his head. “I’m fine. I might complain more to piss off Clint.”
I stopped making bombs, quit the company, sold all of my fancy cars, and modern art and aged whiskey and everything else of value, and gave all the money to charity. Of course, Obie wasn’t happy with my 'new direction'. I’m twenty one, he was supposed to start transferring control of the company and the pack to me this year. Now I was running around like a hippie, refusing to let a weapon’s company make weapons? He couldn’t have that. So he pawned me off to you, and I had no real reason to say no. The whole pack depends on the company to make a living, threatening to shut down weapons production drove my few friends away. If I tried the board would lock me out. But I refused to help design anymore, so this was a good way to remove me from the inheritance while also building relationships with other packs. Looks much better on paper than “The second Tony stopped being useful we decided to kick him out.”
The peacekeeper cursed. “Don’t you dare move until I get back, got it?”
“We need to get back. Without the cart it will be a slow walk.”
He ducked around a corner and pulled out his phone, dialing Obie. It rang once and went to voicemail.
“You don’t have…? It’s a hundred bucks, max, with the part you got. And that couldn’t have been more than twenty bucks.”
Steve was alive, he was really alive, solid and firm and real, the strength of his arms pulling Tony closer and holding him tight, the two of them holding onto each other like if they let go for a second the other person would disappear.
“And they all gave it five stars, but did they really like the recipe if they felt the need to change so many things?”
No sooner had Jarvis finished his sentence than the man himself strode out of the elevator, fully armored up, balancing two desks carefully in his arms. Behind him, DUM-E beeped and nudged a chair out to join the others filling the Avenger’s living room. Tony dumped the two desks next the others, and straightened up, casually brushing off his hands.
Ok, no, maybe not. He was a little bored too, and it was his cow. Steve guessed that he could show him around town tomorrow, and just have to think of something new after that. He’d ask Jan too, even if she was younger. While he thought to himself, Tony had moved on to apologizing.
“That's my girl.” He patted her side and started milking her. After he made it through a few cows, Clint came outside and started helping. In an hour more, they were done.
“What? I’m not allowed to have a boyfriend?” He asked indignantly. Sure he was a little hopeless in the romance department, okay, maybe very hopeless (several inches worth according to Tony), but still… it's not like this was impossible. Bucky saw his face and verbally back peddled, holding up his hands.
Tony was looking at him with large nervous eyes. “Steve, you didn’t have to-”
“Was it Freud who said kids want to grow up to marry boys just like their daddies?”
“Sure.” Bucky said skeptically. “ Look, I'm back now, and I'll go clean up your mess tomorrow. God, This is just like you, to go barreling head first into trouble without thinking twice about the consequences. There's no way he really likes you, you know that, right? You really think a rich guy from the Stark pack, hell, the Stark heir himself, wants to live on our dumpy ranch and milk cows and make moon eyes at you? Be real here.”
Tony was too vindicated to be mad. “I fucking called it! I knew it! Day one, I said it was going to involve me getting wet. And I was right. I was right!”
“S' good,” Tony assured him. He could feel Steve relax behind him.
“Man, it’s never a good time with you two.”
Tony was aware he wasn’t the most likable person, he wore the label of ‘difficult’ like a badge of pride, and like a shield against the cutting words. If people were going to hate him, then he’d give them something to hate. And if they hated the larger than life, most flashy and aggressive version of him, then that was alright. That version could take it. It could take it and take it and take it, and underneath it all the version of him with the sharp edges sanded down and an openness about him could hide away, only emerging cautiously around Obie and Rhodey where he could trust that it was safe to be softer. And now Steve too, who saw through him with piercing blue eyes, and held him with calloused hands, and smiled at Tony like happiness was a secret shared only between the two of them.
Tony did his best to follow, and when they stopped Steve helped him sit down, making sure his ankle was ok. Steve stayed standing, pacing back and forth. He dug through his pockets and handed Tony a crumpled piece of paper. It was the note from the parachute. Tony carefully unfolded it and read the message. He looked back up at Steve. “I don’t understand. They think we’re cute and want us to win? We can’t both win, how would that work?”
Steve looked up at the muddy grey sky. “Looks like rain, so we’ll do something indoors. How about the Brooklyn Historical Society?”
“All of it. No.” Tony insisted and Steve's breath puffed warmly against the back of his neck as he laughed. “You’re so grumpy in the morning.”
“All peacekeepers, please report to the Capitol building immediately, report to the Capitol building immediately, this is not a drill.”
“You’re the worst. Go get me more eggs.”
The notary prompted them. “Your vows?”
“Don’t be stupid, she’s dead.”
“Tony.”
That was a stupid question, everyone had to watch the games. “It’s mandatory,” Tony said dryly.
Steve brought the bandages over as Bruce slowly eased his boot off. It didn’t look as bad as Tony had feared, most swollen and bruised an ugly purple. They way it felt, he would have guessed a bone would be sticking out.
Tony hesitated. Could one kiss really hurt? He didn't want to hurt Steve by befriending him then lying and leaving, but now he was hurting him by staying away. He wished for the hundredth time that he was exactly who he said he was, some nobody from the castle, who was free to love Steve like he deserved. Because it would be so easy to love him, Tony felt like he was standing at the edge of a cliff, the edges crumbling, every second drawing him closer to falling for him once and for all. He stopped walking and lead Steve off the path. He cupped one hand around the side of Steve’s face and leaned in to give him a soft kiss, and simple press of lips. The bond between them flared brighter, and Tony jerked away. For a second the feelings morphed into a quick litany of words, "Tony! I can feel you, I-" before fading back into a rough sense of emotion as Tony pulled back, locking up as much of himself as he could.
“Mountain lion?”
“Yup, well, that’s how it is.” Steve said awkwardly, trying to shut Bucky up before he made a big deal of things. Tony knew he didn't have a whole lot of experience with relationships, but he didn't need to hear any more from his brother about it.
“I guess that explains why I’m so much more mature.”
He closed his eyes and played out another scenario. Their eyes would meet from across the hall. He would be too thin. He never ate enough without Steve nagging him. Tony’s eyes would widen, his hands would tremble, and he would take a step forward, without even realizing that he had done so. Steve would step forward too, and reach out a hand to shake, and Tony would ignore the hand to grab onto him in a desperate hug.
