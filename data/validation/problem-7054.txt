“Not you, you idiot. Me.  Ambitious. Headstrong. Doesn’t know his limits.” Tony hadn’t even thought about applying that description to Steve. But hearing it again, it does seem appropriate.
Tony reread the email.  That didn’t sound like he was jealous, right? Right.  Not at all.  He took out the question.  Then wrote it back in.  Then took it out.  Fuck it.  Fuck it, he wrote it back in, it was fine, it was totally cool, even if Flying never really exactly said he
“Down the hallway, second door on the left,” Pepper told them as she sorted through another stack of green index cards.
“Lock down the workshop; he can’t get you in there,” Steve ordered as he turned around to block Obadiah’s path to Tony.
Tony had a second to hesitate. Should he be nervous, with a potential giant baddy whom he had basically invited into his house? This Barnes, even with one arm, still looked like he could be pretty brutal in a fight.  Inwardly, he cursed himself briefly for giving Happy the day off.  But the man was driving everyone crazy and he really needed to take a day off.  Still, he had everything on camera. Jarvis watched all and could alert the police at any instant, anyway. He was going to be fine.  Just fine.
Tony looked over at him again out of the corner of his eye.  He was cute.  But more than that, if this was Flying, he knew him.  He knew the person inside.  And that was what mattered, even if he hadn’t been cute.  A bubble of excitement gurgled up in his stomach and he suppressed another inane desire to giggle like a kid.  He’d found him.  He’d found him, they could meet in person, he could maybe kiss him, maybe just be known and know each other.
He accessed Stern’s home computer, digging through his files.  Ugh. The man was despicable—bribes, coercion, a distinct lack of anything resembling a moral compass.  Emails from Howard? Interesting. Not Steve-related, but probably something he needed to know. Maybe something he could use. At the very least, something Pepper should have so she wouldn’t be blindsided in the future.
Natasha’s eyebrow just shot up higher as she pursed her lips.  “You know, you don’t have to go alone.”
“Really, Buck? I tell you that breaking and entering is a good idea and you want to make an issue outta what I call the guy?”
The feel of his fingers on Steve’s face, pressing on his lips. His dark eyes, fragile and longing. The spicy scent of his cologne, underlying notes of fire. The trail of Tony’s fingers still burned in his mind.  He wanted him so badly he ached with it, needing to touch him, needing to feel him. In the end though, he couldn’t.  Not with the taste of scotch still in his mouth, the woodsy flavor and smoke on his lips, the sharp bite of alcohol fresh on his tongue. Tony had evaded alcohol all night; it had been a coup. Steve could see the sense of accomplishment and contentedness Tony felt.  Steve wouldn’t drag Tony down from his success. He couldn’t.
“Oh Jesus, this is ridiculous,” Tony snapped.  “I didn’t know Captain America also included taming wild beasts on his resume.  Sure, I do the hard work, and then you waltz in and he pretends like he’s not a ferocious monster.”
He was just about to tell Jarvis to run a prototype when his AI announced that Steve Rogers was asking for entrance.
“Or what? You’ll tell people? It’ll be a rumor! Nobody even cares about rumors. Everyone knows how much shit gets made up and you have always been trying to start shit with me, you little fucking weasel.”
“Hey there, mister,” he said gently, grabbing a towel from the towel warmer Tony kept by the bath. “Aren’t you just adorable as all get out?” He got down on the floor, so he wouldn’t be as threatening, holding out his fingertips for the kitten to sniff. The small animal snuffled at him, nose twitching.  It sneezed.  “Aww, you’re okay, aren’t you, little guy?” He scooped him up with one hand and wrapped him in the warm towel, building a safe, fluffy cocoon.  The kitten settled down immediately, scrunching into the towel and purring.
Tony grinned. For now, he grabbed the little jar off the table and went back down to the workshop.  He opened it.  It smelled lightly fragrant, but floral. Sunflowers, maybe. Or cornflowers.  He stripped his shirt and rubbed a tiny fingertip of it into his scarring.  He could picture Steve’s fingers doing it instead, smoothing the salve onto his chest, wide fingertips massaging his skin.  He swallowed.  When had he paid attention to Steve’s fingers? But now he knew he could picture those hands, deft and sure, broad, long fingers.  His blood was suddenly leaving his brain and heading lower.  He twisted the lid back on the jar, wiping his fingers on a towel.  His chest did feel better.  The ache reduced and the inflammation was slightly less red and puffy, even if it wouldn’t do anything for his arc reactor problem. Still, he felt like he could take a deep breath for the first time since Afghanistan.
“And what, you’re the village idiot? I don’t know if you realized this, but Peggy wasn’t really the sort to tolerate idiots.”
“Yeah, and you got nothing to prove, right?” Barnes shook his head.  His expression was defeated, and looked like habit.  A losing fight he was used to losing.
She swore, angrily. “Steve, I’m getting him back on that list. I’m not leaving until I find someone who can make it happen.  You know I don’t care. You know I love him, arm or no arm. But I will not let him get shunted aside by someone who doesn’t know what he’s been through.”
His mouth was warm, sweet, lips caressing Tony’s, consuming him, easing over his mouth, his face, his eyelids, a line of searing kisses down his throat. Tony swallowed, catching his breath, then chased Steve’s mouth, reclaiming it, hand on his jaw, guiding his mouth back to Tony’s, he couldn’t get over the taste of him, the way his lips parted for him, searched for his.
Steve drew back, a little, looking down at Tony’s eyes, glinting moonlight.  “You’re not…” he let out a short, pained breath. “You’re not disappointed that it’s me?” It was too dark to see how blue Steve’s eyes were, the stars lighting him from above instead.
Steve rounded the doorway, pulling up short when he saw people in the driveway.  His gaze took in Tony, Pepper, and Rhodey, then glanced down to his lack of shirt, and raced back inside.
Tony stared.  “Were you like part of a super secret cult or something? Who doesn’t want to date you?”
“I want…” Steve’s voice goes colorless. Tony’s fairly sure he’s crying.  He’s whispering. “I want to come home. I’ll sign, I’ll turn myself in. I’ll do anything.”
“He did not.  Perhaps you would like to visit the gym, since you have no duties at the moment. Miss Potts left your belongings in your room, earlier.”
He downloaded the next batch of messages.  They loaded fairly quickly, thanks to Natasha’s ominously named leechandiwill3ndy0u wifi. Mostly just dates and times.  Negotiations and counteroffers, narrowing down to a specific date and time with more details on the target.
When Tony showed up to pick up Steve for the finals study group session, Rhodey and Pepper in tow, the door was already open. And there was a familiar silver volvo next to Peggy’s bicycle.   What the hell was going on?
, and Discovery played it like every day for three months.  Well, the young astronaut, John Storm… It was just like Wonder Woman, actually. My dad thought I had a thing for his sister, Sue.
“Tony,” comes the frayed reply.  It’s a little late for that. It’s a little late for sympathy, after Siberia.
“Senator Stern blacklisted James Barnes from the prosthetics list last night, sir, apparently after Captain Rogers gave him the slip.”
“Hey, Tony.” Steve carefully marked his place in his book and closed it, walking over to the workbench around dinnnertime.  “I’m going to make dinner.  Want to come upstairs?”
“I’m working on it.  Just, stay hidden for a while.  Please.” The night is so silent he feels like his words carry, even though he’s speaking quietly.
Eventually, Tony opened his eyes. “Come on, sugar, make me feel it,” he said, voice hoarse.  Steve pulled Tony’s hips up, making him puff out a laugh. Tony urged him on, murmuring breathlessly, praising Steve, telling him how he’d ruined Tony for anyone else, how he loved Steve, how he was going to have to keep him now, forever, and Steve’s orgasm blindsided him, leaving him gasping, panting, the word
The sound of a slightly raised voice came from the door, clearly Peggy.  “—should be more than suspended!” she was nearly shouting.
“I love me a man who can cook,” Sam said, yoking his arm around Steve’s neck.  Then he rapped his knuckles on Steve’s head.  “But we all know it ain’t you—this is all Abe, man.”
“Yeah. Forever.” He hadn’t planned it but he meant it.  He meant it.  Forever. Tony flattened his palm over Steve’s chest, over his heart.
He drove home, silently, radio off.  The roads were dark, unlit, the sky barely illuminated by a sliver of a waning moon.  The stars were cold, distant, impeccably hard and far away.
Tomorrow, Barnes will make a gruff, half-ashamed apology for breaking in, giving Tony a warning glare when Steve isn’t looking.  Tony will start wondering if he can develop a better prosthetic than whatever the VA is going to give him, if that would win him over entirely. Natasha and Pepper will make a date to talk business, but it’s going to be over several bottles of wine and they’re going to be wearing sweats, not suits.
Tony let his imagination run while Jarvis called the kids.  In this alternate future, he lived, somehow replacing the palladium that was burning out.  In this world, he saw the wells preventing cholera for millions, the refugee camps providing security—true homes, now—until Assad finally gave up and submitted himself to the ICC.  Steve came back, maybe just to check in now and again, Barnes in tow, both having forgiven him.  Still.  If he’d set all that in motion, that wasn’t so bad.  So maybe he wouldn’t see it grow to fruition, maybe his slate wasn’t clean, maybe he wasn’t in the black, but that had to make up for some of his sins.
Steve stood for a second, frozen with indecision. Then he gave in. If he had only this left, if this was the end, he could allow himself one hug.  It didn’t have to be romantic.  Even if those feelings weren’t appropriate, he still cared for Tony. He knew what a good man he was, what he was trying to do in the world. It could be friendly, and Tony wouldn’t hold it against him. He pulled Tony into a quick embrace, gratitude for all Tony had done for him, regret for leaving him prematurely, and a mix of stifled disappointment and relief he didn’t want to look too closely at right now.
Steve just turned to the fridge and grabbed Tony a Coke. Then he added a pink straw with a paper umbrella on it, and handed it over, grinning.
For some reason, he thought briefly about the look on Obadiah’s face in Steve’s drawing.  Which was stupid, irrational. It was literally a drawing, not reality. Totally unfounded, but Tony put the new reactor in Dum-E’s claw and threw what had once been an MIT sweatshirt before it was used as a shop rag over it.  Christ, maybe he was getting paranoid before he ever hit middle age. Going to Howard Hughes it.  Well, better than Howard Starking it? It wasn’t actually funny but to hear Stark as a verb… He gave a small laugh.  He could now. Everything seemed a little lighter now that he wasn’t going to die.
“I found what Barnes was looking for, Steve.  I know you were in Project Rebirth. I found Howard’s papers, your contract.”
He was just finishing the third optimization when his phone buzzed.  An email.  From Flying.  Tony’s body tingled in anticipation.  He didn’t even know this guy, but it was somehow, in some ways, closer than he’d gotten to nearly anyone.  This person knew he was gay, even if he didn’t know him.  This guy knew what he was going through.  He locked his door and swiped the email open.
According to Peggy Carter, Hammer and Hodge had cornered her in the art room.  They’d started groping her and she punched Hodge, giving him that glorious black eye and chipping the polish on her thumb. They’d gotten her arms behind her when Steve had walked in, seen what was going on, and thrown his palette (Tony’s palette!) at them.  It had knocked Hammer out, and Hodge, true to his nature, fled.
She didn’t turn to look at him, but he could feel her approval and agreement.  “He’s trained in it since practically birth. He’s had to do this since he was small—the press still sees him as he was when he was young: troubled and vulnerable.” Her voice hardened, and he knew the tone wasn’t for him; he was also aware he’d been guilty of misreading Tony, too.
Natasha looked a little troubled. “I mean, we were dating. Before I moved.  We still are.  I just didn’t get to say goodbye, really.  It’s complicated. He’s actually from Brooklyn, originally.”
Sirens sounded in the distance.  The police were on their way.  This whole horrible day was almost over. He looked around.  “J, did you get tape of his confession from earlier?”
He put his toiletries in the bathroom, then changed into a pair of sweatpants and an old t-shirt.  He followed Jarvis’s directions down to the gym, starting on a heavy bag after stretches.
Bucky looked surprised.  “You didn’t go for him? I thought you’d think he was cute, all brainy and shit. Otherwise I wouldn’t’ve left you there in the first place, paying for that stupid rose thing or not.”
“No idea why,” Sam commented dryly. “Just the weight of the world on your shoulders.  No big deal, right?” He shook his head.  “Steve. Why don’t you take a break? There’s a lot of superheroes out there now.  Let someone lead for a while. When’s the last time you took a break?”
Steve just smiled.  Tony smiled back like he couldn’t help it.  Steve sat on the floor, breaking the chicken into bite size pieces for the little fluffball now sitting docilely in the pile of towel as if he hadn’t been trying to tear Tony’s eyes out three minutes before.
Coulson sighed.  He would have run a hand through his hair if he hadn’t been so completely in control of himself.  “Yeah.  He’s coming to HQ today.  We want you to meet him.”
Tony looked in the mirror.  He looked… normal.  He didn’t look difference.  He looked like Tony Stark, millionaire genius nerd.
Tony reached out, his fingertips still tingling from the feeling of Steve’s lips, resting them resolutely against Steve’s warm mouth, lightly dragging it down to him, licking his lips, his breath shaky, other hand gently tracing the line of Steve’s neck.
Steve wandered down a little while later.  Tony was busy, like he always was, but he stopped what he was doing to smile at Steve and pull up the schematics for the gloves.
Steve hopped in the shower, still trying not to think about ice cream, and gave Natasha the video without his translation.  She didn’t need it, and he wanted independent confirmation.  She wrote down what Raza was saying, not falling for Steve’s misinterpretations. She noted the dates and the location, moving swiftly through the messages.  She’d made her way through the chain by the time he was done getting dressed. Impressive, as always. Steve looked them over.  He’d been pretty close, but her translations were better than Google. He handed the notes to Bucky.
“What’s the difference between punching a lump of dough and punching a bag? Other than I get food at the end of the first one?” she’d asked, ever practical.
Why hadn’t he just asked for help? It was such a fragile thing, this contract. The slip of paper was all Steve needed.  It was his guarantee.  His freedom.
,” Barnes retorted. Steve gave him a look. Wow. “Nat has licenses, I’m just here with her,” Barnes backtracked, cowed.
Steve smiled, kissed the corner of his mouth.  “No safer place.” He drew Tony in, arms around him, enclosing him, keeping him, safe and snug.  His thigh rested over Tony’s, anchoring him, his presence warm, always warmer than other people, he kissed Tony’s hair.
Tony didn’t have to look around the room.  This was what mattered.  He reached for Steve’s hand, pulled him close, luxuriated in the feeling of being near him. He saw Pepper notice and tear up.  She bumped into Rhodey who looked over and nodded, satisfied.  Natasha and Barnes just exchanged a look.  Then they turned the same expression on Steve, who blushed faintly.
Tony didn’t hack Fury’s office—not really.  He already had the hack there from before—he just opened the channel. He didn’t need, at this point, to hear the sound.  He just watched Steve’s shoulders, the tension rising.  Watched him draw himself up.  Steve had considered the outcomes, that was clear. Knew he might lose his job.
School was school.  Evidently, it continued, despite any upheavals Tony experienced. Despite any time Steve may have spent in lock up (Natasha had gotten Murdock to put aside his “I don’t really do this kind of lawyering, Ms. Romanoff,” to take on Steve’s case.  Steve was going to be just fine).  Hammer didn’t end up coming back though. Nor did Hodge.  Not by the time February rolled around, anyway.
Mel: I hear you. It took years for me to be able to talk about a bad mission I was on.  Lost everyone.  Lost myself. Wouldn’t have helped them for you to be there, you know.
Tony took questions from everyone with aplomb, deftly maneuvering his way through the more aggressive reporters.
“Tony, Tony, Tony.  I am not going to prison,” Obadiah blustered, standing up and drawing himself up to his full height. “Your father, Howard never would have sent me to prison.  He knew what we were trying to build here, Tony! Now that was a man with a vision! And you were a mess, you know you were, you were drinking and partying and was tearing down the business, m’boy!”
In the second image, Tony sat above Steve, perched on the counter.  It would have been a small matter for Steve to reach over, instead of rummaging around in the cabinet, and know exactly what command voice did to him.  He’d know just what Tony wanted, pushing a thick finger into his open mouth, slicking it up, parting Tony’s thighs with those ridiculous hands.
Miss Potts looked at the empty dishes in his hands.  “Did you bring Tony lunch? In his workshop? And he ate it?” Her voice rose on each sentence.
Bucky pushed the lid of his laptop shut and set his hand on Steve’s shoulder.  “Steve, I’ve known you since we were small enough to wear diapers. I was there when you decided horses were evil without ever having met one in person—“
Tony was pretty sure he knew what that unlocked.  He picked his way through the basement to the heaviest looking brick in the room.  Yep.  There it was.  An early electronically coded lock.  He entered the digits Jarvis gave him and opened the cabinet—well, safe was probably a closer term.  It was weighty, lined with lead and fireproofed.  He swung the unwilling, creaky door open, reaching inside for the papers within.
“Stevie, Stevie I’m a mess, man, I’m nothin, they didn’t want me and she left and I got nothin’ left, Stevie, I’m nothin’ I’m nothin’…”
He considered his circumstances.  He had two options, as far as he could see.  First, he could take a very cold shower and think about things that were exceptionally unsexy, like doombots, aliens, Clint.  Or he could try to take the edge off right now, quickly, before Steve caught him with his pants down. Literally.
“Um, it’s about a year ago? Hey, we were there a year ago.  It’s the—“ he broke off suddenly.  “Holy shit, is that what I think it is?”
Steve started a color wash over the page.  Half in daylight, half clearly shadowed in night.  Dawn breaking.  It had somehow turned into his room, his bed, even if the space was still undefined.  He looked up to see Tony looking back at him, smiling, affection radiating gently from him.  His brown eyes crinkled as he tapped his stylus on the desk in front of him.  The way he was twisted, back to Steve, showed off the lines of his body, the sleek, lithe muscle.  Steve loved his body, spent more time thinking about it than he ought to, especially if they were just friends.  But he liked the bird-quick way Tony moved, his amazing bubble butt, his arms draped in sinewy muscle and burn scars.  The way he stood now, feet apart, hands planted on the desk, it was like he was teasing inadvertently.
“Shit.  Hell. I shouldn’t have left him alone.  When he said they denied him I thought I could talk to a friend of mine who’s an aide to a member of the armed services committee. I thought if I talked to her in person I could get him back on the list. Fuck.  He thinks I left him? I would never.  Steve.  You know I would never.”
. The questions were getting increasingly vicious, asking about former bad habits from before Afghanistan, insinuating Tony was lying, cheating, and generally scum. A quick evaluation of the crowd told him they were sharks, scenting blood, pack mentality full swing. Time to pull back.
“Back in cryo.  Until there’s a way to get him better.  He said it’s better this way. He’s always been stubborn.”
“Not at all, Mr. Stark.  It’s always good to know someone’s looking after the recliners and champagne,” Steve replied, deadpan.
“Steve.  Do you. You gotta take care of yourself.  Go see an ocean, stay on a beach somewhere, chop down some trees. The world’ll be okay.”
This guy liked Batman.  Batman was awesome.  He had all the toys, made all the tech.  Actually, the rappelling rope from his belt was the inspiration for one of the Dum-E’s upgrades, making sure he could get from point-A to point-B in the beginning. He’d used it on the robotics team, too, for guidance.
Steve knows he’s done. He awkwardly hops off the workbench with his wrists still bound and steps outside the door.  “Am I locked out?”
Steve looked a bit regretful. “No.  I did have one date. We were supposed to come here, play a round. Never made it.”
They paused kissing, turning to look at their friends, Steve’s arms encircling Tony naturally, the most obvious position in the world.  Rhodey was giving them a thumbs up and Natasha just winked slowly.  Peggy kept up her catcalling and Sam joined in, a loud caterwaul under a perfect full moon.
Tony pulled on a coat and walked over to the Maximoff’s house.  It took 48 seconds, not that he was counting. The house looked pretty dark when he got there. Maybe they weren’t home.  He rang the bell, and it sounded, a tiny little tinkling noise that was incongruous with the heavy construction of the house.
“Nope, I’m good,” Tony replied, voice terse, keeping his hands in his pockets. “Hey, I’m getting started on those upgrades to your gloves.  Want to head down to the workshop later?”
Tony didn’t have time to ask, since Maya Hansen was back. She brought another scotch, but since Tony already had one, Steve took it from her, thanking her graciously.  Halfway into his third attempt to extract himself from the conversation, Tony noticed that Stern was moving toward him again, eyes intent.  He turned to tell Steve to go find Pepper, but Rogers had evaporated. Huh. Had he overheard something? No.  There was no way. Had he suddenly developed telepathy? Tony was pretty sure that was still beyond the range of science.
Suddenly, his hand was swinging loosely by his side, Stane was yelping, his nose gushing blood, and Steve was giving Tony a somewhat sheepish look from across the room, rubbing his knuckles.
He followed Steve up the stairs, which gave him the perfect opportunity to stare at that ass.  Jesus.  It was no wonder if the guy could run a 6 minute mile for a whole marathon.  Stamina, too.  Not that Tony was thinking, well, anything.
Most of it was Howard’s work, clear annotations in his cramped, capital letters.  There were a few memos, from Stern, Erskine, and a Commander Phillips, apparently the head of this military experiment, arguing back and forth over the rights they would have over the test subject once he had undergone the procedure. Howard claimed he should have experimental rights and all patents.  That anything the test subject did post-test would fall under his purview since the experiment would never take place without using his facility. And those Vita Rays were his, too.  Phillips argued that the military didn’t actually want to be involved at all, unless the procedure could be given to a test subject of his choice, saying he hadn’t wasted his political capital on “that skinny little gerbil, Rogers.” Idiot. Stern laid claim to the test subject indefinitely on the basis that he had secured the exemptions on human experimentation.  But to each of these, Erskine responded with absolute denial.  He wouldn’t give his formulae, he wouldn’t contribute his singular expertise, unless the subject was released after he’d served his time in the army.  He backed his stance with the Geneva Conventions, Human Rights conventions, and his personal experience, he said, in Nazi Germany.  And there it was: a contract, signed by all of them—Steve too, giving the subject freedom after one term of military service. Magically forgotten in Howard’s safe, hidden from the public.
Tony laughed, giving up the pose and the sultry voice. “You’re so…” He tossed the stylus on the desk and moved to stand over Steve.  He bent down, hand reaching out for Steve’s face, drawing him in. He settled into Steve’s lap, mouth closing over Steve’s, tilting his head back and recapturing his lips.  Tony licked over Steve’s mouth, sucking on his lower lip, Steve’s hands coming up to hold Tony’s hips. “You’re so distracting,” Tony finally said. “What’s Clint going to think when his arrows start exploding before they’re supposed to?”
Pepper grimaced.  “Fury thought it would be a ‘cute’ idea if the yearbook did interviews on students who had lost parents—how they thought their parents would feel about them graduating. It was scrapped, obviously.”
The sound of Pepper’s heels clicked quickly into the room.  “And I’m sure you won’t, Steve.  Happy just likes to be diligent.  But he understands, don’t you, Happy?” She turned a razor gaze on him.
Ugh. Tony was done with that conversation for today.  He narrowed his eyes at Steve as he said, “Yeah, J, go ahead and find Rogers a room. Tell Pep I’m good on PAs for a while. Have her send someone over to get whatever Rogers needs from wherever it is he lives. Give him the tour.”
He drove the A4 over to Gapstow Bridge.  The night was cold, but a clean cold, not snowy, the air was dry.  The moon illuminated everything, reflecting off of the river, placid as glass.  He checked his phone.  10:42.  That was more than enough time, right? That was enough time for someone to hear about his little display via snapchat even if Flying hadn’t been at the dance itself.
Steve tossed his phone to Natasha, who caught it midair, a questioning look on her face.  “Call Pepper, she’s #2 in contacts, have her contact Colonel Rhodes, Air Force, and tell him Obadiah Stane is trying to kill Tony.” Maybe Pepper could get someone sent over sooner. Maybe Rhodes would have someone in the area.  Damnit, why had he left Tony alone when Happy was still out of town?
He brushed the feeling away. He was being irrational.  Tony trusted Stane, so Steve should, too. He pushed away from the computer and got ready for bed.  He’d been tracking one transaction through servers in Portugal, Dubai, Singapore, Bolivia, Slovenia, and Cambodia, finally thinking he would get somewhere with the data when it ended in a bank in Monaco.  Again. He’d try again tomorrow morning.  It was so frustrating being so close, and yet not being able to do what was necessary.  He was sure Tony wasn’t behind the weapons sales.  He had to find the proof.  He’d been working for the man most of the month, and he could see Tony was a good person.  Generous and brilliant.  He cared about everything.  Why couldn’t Steve just help him out?
This was loving Steve Rogers, and being loved by him, and Tony would do it every day, until they died, until the stars failed, until the universe ceased to exist in vanishing motes of dust and sunlight, until forever, and even then.
Tony noticed Steve’s discomfort, swallowing his laughter and saying sympathetically, “Hey, no, you’re right. Do you. Do what makes you happy, right? You deserve it, Cap.  No one more than you.”
Tony wasn’t at all what he had thought. He wasn’t like Howard, he wasn’t like the magazines portrayed him to be—callous and selfish.  Steve knew that now.  Tony was generous to a fault, probably more brilliant than Howard had been, and Howard had literally cured Steve of a multitude of maladies. But Tony’s genius was tempered by his humanity, his compassion. He was warm and kind. His work would help millions of people.  Howard had wanted a medical experiment and treated Steve like a guinea pig.  Tony would never do that. He brought Steve a glass of water when he was having nightmares, took him mini golfing, teased him about his shitty taste in baseball teams.  Maybe it was being held in Afghanistan that made him so empathetic. Steve’d seen the reports.  He knew what the arc reactor did, on a basic level—after all, Tony had given him access to everything in SI.  He knew it helped him with the shrapnel that still threatened his heart. Did it hurt? Was he in constant pain? Anxiety, metallic and bitter, flooded his mouth, pulsing through his veins.
“Keep an eye on Steve’s phone and any contact with Stern.  If Stern tries anything, I need to know.”
She shrugged, coyly, sorting her tater tots by what seemed to be size and relative crispiness.  “Not sure.  Big decision, first Halloween in a new place.  Why, what do you want me to be?”
Tony tried to keep his hope up.  There were still eleven minutes.  But he’d been there for an hour.  Flying wasn’t coming.  Whatever he wanted, turns out it wasn’t Tony.  Tony felt like his whole body was shutting down, slowly solidifying.  He wanted to become a part of the landscape, one of those replica Japanese lanterns, or a tree.  Misery knotted in his stomach.  He put his head down on his knees.  Tomorrow he would tell himself that it was still worth it, that he was out, on his own, that he had his own assets, that he had great friends.  Tomorrow he would tell himself that he stood up for what he wanted, that he put his heart on the line, he was brave.  Tomorrow.  He could do that tomorrow.  He took a deep breath, getting ready to stand, to leave this place, this place where Flying came when he was feeling happy, or sad, or when he just wanted to feel like he had a place in the world.  And Tony was the intruder, really.  Time to vacate the premises, give it back to its rightful owners.
Tony went straight to the workshop to get started.  If he only had a month left, he had a hell of a lot to do.  He picked up on a redesign of the Stark water filtration system.  It was too expensive to produce right now, couldn’t get wide enough distribution to be truly effective.  Not in the places where it was really needed.  It was already lightweight, already portable. But the combination of high cost and low flow led to it being used mostly by the wealthy hiker sort, the ones who wanted to filter water out of the streams of Yosemite and Yellowstone.  That wasn’t good enough. Tony wanted it to be truly useful.  He wanted mass production for places that didn’t have centralized filtration systems.  He could do better.  And he knew,
Tony pretended to be hurt.  “Steve.  You don’t understand.  You’ve never felt the joy of mini golf before.  There are little tiny hobbit-size golf clubs, and windmills, and a giant clown that’s scary as fuckall.  Besides, it’s a rite of passage, I’m pretty sure.  Everybody has to go mini golfing.  I mean, you’re a little bit of a late bloomer.  Most of us do this in middle school.  High school maybe.  Everyone has at least a couple mini golf dates.” Tony shuddered, remembering the last mini golf date he’d been on, where he’d been pushed into the duck pond.  He’d probably been fourteen.  He’d definitely deserved it. It was awful.  On the other hand, maybe Steve had a point.  Why mini golf again? “You’ve really never been? Not even on a middle school date?”
The door opened and Rhodey walked in, while Sam loudly griped about “This asshole, who brings something and makes the rest of us fuckers look bad,” but he was smiling as he said it, fake punching Steve’s shoulder.
“The arc reactor is at twelve percent, Sir. It appears to be degenerating more quickly as it becomes weaker. I estimate it will last you two days, at most.”
“Not the help, you idiot, take out Stark!” Obadiah snarled, reaching into his pocket with one hand while stuffing something in his ear with the other.
Tony could almost fill this one in on his own.  Brock swung at the kid, and so of course, Steve decided to get in the way of that punch.  Jesus.  Brock was part of the football team, and he spent most of his free time in the weight room.  Steve was lucky he didn’t look worse at this point, jumping in unprepared.
“It’s not an atom, Pep, it’s a…” Tony trailed off.  He flipped the photo onto one of the displays.  “Son of a bitch.”
Fuck. Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck. He signed it love.  What the fuck? How did one get gmail to retract an email? Was it really electronic? Shit.  Shit.  Flying was never going to talk to him again.  Tony would have scared him off, so thoughtlessly, from the sheer ebullience he was feeling about coming out.  He put his head down on his desk, wishing he could invent a time machine—not even a very good time machine, he didn’t want to go back in time and punch Hitler or get Galileo to stand fast in the face of the papal inquiry—he just wanted to erase the last two minutes!   Christ, this was his life. He had one good thing, a great thing, and then this.
Steve just watched him work for a while, then turned back to his painting.  It took shape quickly.  Tony, in Steve’s bed, sleeping, blankets tangled around his waist.  Sun creeping in over the skyline.  His painting was a portent, he thought.  The sun fell gently on Tony’s skin, kissing it, gilding it, casting golden warmth over his lax torso. Steve himself sat next to him, watching him, watching over him.  His entire body was in shadow, one hand holding Tony’s, close to the line of the light.  His blond hair looked ashen.  His own coloring was grey. It was an inversion, desperately clinging to the source of his light. The way the color hit, it was some watercolor rendition of Photogen and Nycteris.  And there was no hiding the hopeless love in the line of his body. It was a love letter, in paint. He’d have to burn this.  Or stash it somewhere no one would ever find it.  Fitting.
At eleven, he had his hour with the therapist—an hour of oatmeal-colored furniture, grey walls, and the sterile vase of flowers centered on the coffee table. She asked if he wanted to talk about it.  Steve would refuse, politely.  She would say she understood.  He would smile politely.  He wondered, a little, after the destruction in Harlem, if Banner understood.  He wondered if Romanoff would say comforting platitudes about loss, about guilt. About redemption. He wondered if she would believe it.
“Pepper needed me for a moment, something about Johansson,” Steve replied smoothly.  But there it was again, the same tightness in his jaw as when he lied about Barnes’s girlfriend.  Tony turned back to Selvig for his email address, this time not noticing when Stern cornered him again.  With both relief and confusion, Tony noticed Steve was, once again, a ghost. He tried to brush Stern off again, done with this game, and burning with curiosity.  He finally shook him loose as he moved toward the door, almost made it, when Obie walked in. Stern gave up, disappointed, moving off to circle easier prey.
“How tragic, then, that the Captain is so enamored of you,” Loki told him.  “It’s unfortunate, really, with someone so well-endowed. Perhaps you’d reconsider?” he asked Steve.
Tony locked down the workshop when he finally got there, blacking out the whole thing.  He knew Steve might come down any minute, but he needed a second to regroup.
Tony was really going to miss Jarvis.  If he could miss people once he was dead.  If he could really miss AI when he was dead.  AI that he had created. Was that like missing himself? Could he miss himself?
I’m sure you can tell, my relationship with my dad isn’t great.  It’s been so long that I’ve basically given up on him.  The days when I don’t see him are good days.  But it’s been so many days, now. I think we talked before school started, but maybe not since then.  I stay out of his way, for the most part. And it’s good.  But sometimes I wish he’d yell at me, just so I’d know he was paying attention.  I know that sounds fucked up.  I know that *is* fucked up.
“He.  I thought he.” Why was it so hard to say? “I thought he was going to kiss me, on the way home.” Steve was bright red. Embarrassment, desire, disappointment. “After I’d helped out at a party instead of his old PA. But then he apologized and said…” He sifted through the memory, wanted to get the words exactly right.  “He said: ‘That wasn’t like me to do something like that. I’m not like that.’ That seems pretty clear to me.”
See, this was bittersweet.  Tony got Steve’s friendship, his affection.  It might not be exactly the way he hoped, he might not be able to put his tongue where he wanted, but it was good. He was lucky to have it.  Poets always said it was better to have loved and lost, but Tony didn’t think he’d survive it.  Not if it was fake.  Not if he got to taste how it felt to be loved by Steve Rogers, and then have to give it up for good.
Steve looked at her, confused.  Him? If this was going to be another one of those mandatory summons from another planet, he was going to be irritated.  Why couldn’t they just come at a reasonable hour, was all he asked, instead of—he looked at the clock—4:13 in the morning.  Tony looked like he might have been asleep for once, instead of finishing up the ultraglass formula.  Thor—well, he was unpredictable.  Sometimes he liked to hang out on the roof, flipping Mjolnir and singing ballads to the moon.
He heard Steve’s throat clicking dryly, felt Steve press a slow kiss into his hair.  “If it’s what you want, sweetheart,” he murmured.  And then he was gone.
The kitchen was spotless, all stainless steel, gleaming surfaces.  The sunlight shone softly through the window, catching on minute specks of dust floating lazily with the movement of air.  Steve washed his hands (the sink turned on by itself! And then off!) and found ingredients.  Ham, cheese, pickles.  Mustard.  He pulled a pan from one off the cupboards and butter from the fridge.  While he toasted the sandwich he found a pantry that held some chips and washed a few strawberries.  He tipped the sandwich out of the pan, sliced it neatly at an angle, and arranged the halves on a plate. Pulling a glass out of the cupboard, he filled it with iced tea and added a lemon wedge.  This he could do.  This was methodical.  It calmed him.  He could momentarily forget that he was here, being the personal assistant to a crazy billionaire in order to protect his best friend, forget that he was fleeing from the greedy grasp of a power-hungry maniac, forget all of that.  This.  This was routine.  This made sense.
Steve grimaced inwardly.  Not the problem, actually, this time.  “No, he didn’t. This one’s on me. It’s fine.”
“Wish I could say the same, but you’d have to be someone else,” Tony said flippantly, hoping he’d irritate the senator enough for him to drop the conversation.  “Aren’t you supposed to be talking to Hammer, instead? He’s still doing weapons contracting.  They might not work, but that doesn’t seem to have stopped you yet.”
Tony grabbed the file from Rhodey he’d never gotten around to opening.  Looked at that squiggly little code again.
they were talking about like a lab rat. Erskine’s original document was safe, never digitalized, according to Daddy Dickhead, and housed where Howard could keep an eye on it.  His insurance, Tony guessed, in case Stern ever wanted to renege on his deal. Howard really had been the best at this game.
Rhodey was Lando Calrissian, and Pepper made a badass Han Solo.  Bruce was wearing some sort of leaf toga—Jolly Green Giant, he said. Nat was dressed like Elastigirl, spandex hugging her curves and a little bandit mask framing her pretty green eyes.  It made even more sense when they got to the party—Sam was Frozone and Steve was a tall, blushing, gorgeous Mr. Incredible. God, he was beautiful, even in spandex. Especially in spandex. Was that really his butt? His real pecs? Or did he have padding? Tony wanted to touch, to find out, just for science.
The blood drained from Tony’s face.  No one could look at his phone.  “Please, Coulson—” he started.
“Weird,” Tony said.  “Do you like your room? You need new sheets, you know that?” He huffed a breath.  “Nice view, though.  Skyline looks great from this side. I gave you the best view, but don’t tell Thor.  It only encourages him.” He stretched. “Well.  I should get back to my own room.  Thanks for the crashpad, Rogers.”
“Sure,” Steve replied, “we hated him.  He was a manipulative asshole, a bully, always trying to throw his weight around. He was so sleazy he made my skin crawl.”
Steve cleaned the kitchen before filling out the forms.  Washing dishes was also meditative.  Calming.  He washed everything, dried it carefully, and put it away.  Jarvis mentioned they had a dishwasher, but Steve just thanked him, and said he didn’t mind.  That he found it relaxing.  He ended up snacking on some of the bits and pieces left over from Mr. Stark’s sandwich, and a handful of chips.  But he didn’t feel right eating all of Mr. Stark’s food.  Not that he thought Mr. Stark would add it to his bill or anything, but the whole arrangement was a little odd.  Besides, he didn’t want to waste the ends and odd bits.  That’s just how he was raised.
He opened the door and found a complete office set up. The wall was clearly intended to function as a screen, and the desk had a notepad, a Starkpad, and something he was pretty sure was a phone.  He picked up the Starkpad.  At his touch, it pinged with three new emails.  He swiped them open, seeing that they were all from Pepper.  It gave him instructions on how to call SI France, with whom to liaise, and what he needed from them.  There was a quick note at the bottom.
Score.  He got Steve time tomorrow, too, and it was for the team.  That was a net win for him, even if everyone else on the team was freaking out and he had to walk to Mrs. S’s with a giant green Hulk, an assassin, a demigod, and a goat.
“Oh,” Tony said. Then he paused. “No, I looked at his notes, and he got a lot closer than anybody thinks he did.  That should still work the same on you.”
“Well, he may have gone to run a few errands for SI.  I don’t know that he’ll be back tonight.” Tony put on his least-concerned face, perfected from years of living with Howard.
He packed a bag. Just a few clothes, toothbrush, cash. He was just double checking that he had what he needed when Tony showed up in his doorway.
There were barely any dots to connect, barely any data at all, but let it never be said Tony was not a genius. “Pepper told you.”
“Steve,” she said, slower.  “I know what you’re doing here.” Steve felt his face pale, but she just kept talking. “I think it’s really sweet of you to try to atone for your friend.  I think you’ll find that Tony will surprise you. That Merchant of Death thing, that’s not him anymore.  I think, if you give him a chance, you’ll find he’s a good person.  Not perfect, but a good man.” She smoothed his shirt in an almost maternal manner, and turned to collect her purse.
Sniveling little orange worm.  Tony was certain Stern was sorry.  He should have known better than going up against Howard’s son.  So Barnes was back on the list, just waiting for the VA to start procedures for their enhanced prosthetics. A little help with the funds on that probably wouldn’t hurt, either.  Get the program going, expand its capabilities.  The Maria Stark Foundation could ensure that the wait list wasn’t so exclusive going forward, could help more of the men and women who came back with injuries.
“You remember this little guy, right? One of Howard’s last. It’s a shame the government didn’t approve. There’s so many applications regarding short term paralysis.” Obie chuckled, removing plugs from his ears as he moved into Tony’s field of vision.  “You know what I was wondering just a minute ago?” He held out Steve’s sketchbook in the same hand as the paralysis device.  “How did your little rent boy figure me out?”
Tony scrutinized him.  “Why not?” He grinned. “Trying to poison me? New rule, you have to eat every time I eat.” He winked, teasing.
“Happy three weeks, Rogers,” Tony said casually, hating how much he liked the sound of counting anniversaries.  Steve was his PA.  He worked for him.  They weren’t dating.  He was working off Barnes’s debt, technically speaking, and Tony didn’t have all that many weeks left anyway.
He thought he might shatter.  He thought his stomach and his heart might not stay inside his body. He thought… He thought he recognized that voice.
Tony held his gaze, searching for something. Then he nodded, pure affection writ openly across his face.  “Of course.” He stroked a hand down Steve’s chest, settling in.  Steve kissed him, running fingers down Tony’s spine. Steve counted the stars, imagining each was a universe, knowing—desperate and true—that in each one he’d love the man he held in his arms tonight.
Thank god, someone was acting normal.  Maybe Steve had metabolized it quickly. That meant the others should be er, less-weird relatively soon.
The cops left. Pepper came over and hugged him, kissing his cheek.  She turned to Steve and hugged him, too. She still had tears in her eyes.
“Steve lives out in the middle of nowhere.  I have no idea where Nat lives, and my pops says you don’t get to come back until you replace that hydrangea.”
That’s very sweet, Steve, but in this case, James is actually right.  Tony needs to know how to do this sort of thing on his own.
“Sorry you ended up with a man in bed,” Tony smirked, walked to the door, oblivious to the fact that Steve was holding himself together with hope and worn cotton sheets. “If it makes you feel better, I’m ordering team breakfast from Elsie’s. You shouldn’t have to take care of the team after Loki fucks up your sleeping schedule.” He turned at the door.  “Sleep in, Cap.”
Natasha nudged him with her elbow.  She must have arrived sometime during the time when Tony’s brain was lost in a wormhole of trying to figure out if Flying and Pieter were the same person.
She shrugged.  “Certain skill set.  I’m good at tracking things down.” She swiped the bag of bagels out of his passenger seat, slipping a cranberry bagel out of the bag.  She nudged his shoulder, kindly, and started walking with Tony toward the door.  “She looks pissed,” Natasha noticed, looking at how Pepper was narrowing her eyes at Tony from the doorway.
Just over two weeks later, Steve had made some progress tracking the weapons deals.  He was pretty sure, now, that he’d been an idiot.  After all, what kind of businessman sells weapons to the enemy? One that didn’t mind bad press and a dying business.  And while Stark—Tony—had all kinds of bad press, he seemed to really care. About his company. About the world.  About Steve, actually.  And, given all the questions he’d been asking about Bucky and the waitlisting on his prosthetic procedure, maybe him too.  There was no way that Tony sold weapons to terrorists. There was just no way.  The man was all bluster, squishy on the inside, and wracked with enough guilt to give Steve a run for his money.  Although, only one of them was particularly into running, and the other one had all the money.
“Tony, Tony, Tony,” Obie drawled, walking over to his workbench. “That’s a publicity stunt! It was to shut the hippies up. We lose money there, every day. We need to get back to basics, Tony. We’re a weapons manufacturer.” Obie was shaking his head slightly, as if surprised by Tony’s naivete.
Steve could do that.  He pulled Tony under him, flipping him over.  “On your knees, love.” He could stare at Tony’s ass all day. And now he was allowed to, without being creepy about it.  He gazed at Tony’s smooth skin, his powerful thighs parted, shafting hanging down enticingly between them.  Steve ran his tongue up one cheek, then ghosted a breath over his hole, making Tony shudder.  He ran his tongue from Tony’s balls to his hole, gentle and wet, while Tony gasped under him.  He circled his tongue around, pressure increasing steadily, Tony’s breathing turning ragged.  Steve loved that, hearing Tony fall apart, just as vocal as he’d always hoped. Slowly, he shaped his tongue into a point, pushing it into Tony’s body, feeling him relax under him, allowing the intrusion, allowing him past the rim.  He pushed his tongue in, fucking in and out, thrusting and twisting.
Tony thought fast.  What would he have had Pepper do? Most of the assistant activities were handled by Jarvis, anyway, or they had been since she took off.  “Just get acquainted with SI.  Do some reading.  Jarvis can get it for you.  I want you to understand the whole company.  I might loan you out to help our CFO for a bit, if you feel up to it. Also, a friend of mine might come by this afternoon, if he can get time off.  Rhodes.  He’s Air Force,” Tony added at the last minute.
When they got home, Steve parked the bike in his usual spot, held it steady as Tony dismounted.  Tony was watching closely.  He watched the way Steve’s shoulders moved. The way he seemed a little lighter, somehow, when he got off the bike. Even more interesting.
“Well, um, I was just thinking that we’re neighbors, and well, I didn’t know what kind of traditions you have for Thanksgiving, but I’m having some friends over at eight to have a second Thanksgiving, more of a friendsgiving, except that’s a totally lame name for it, but whatever, it’s kind of what it is, but there won’t be any turkey, anyway, if you want to come over you can,” Tony rambled, not taking a breath.
“Modest, too, hm? You develop a plan of attack that involved playing dumb?” Tony’s tone was curious, rather than sharp.
I’m not disappointed. Or, I was, a little.  I guess I just wanted it to be you, not because of who he was, but because I thought it’d be nice to be with you, in person. Not be with you, but be with you. You know what I mean.
That night, lying in bed, Tony thought Steve wanted to say something. There was a hesitancy to him that he didn’t usually exhibit.  But when he asked, Steve just smiled and kissed him. “There’s nothing wrong,” he said. He could be infuriating that way.
He steps out of the suit entirely, although he leaves it in sentry mode in the corner.  He busies himself heating up a couple cans of soup he finds in his emergency stash and washing the blood from his hands.  He scrubs until the skin is raw and red and then scrubs some more. His back is to Steve.  He looks into the mirror when he turns off the water, meets Steve’s eyes.  He sees him blink rapidly, knows exactly how he feels.
Tony felt a vague, almost nostalgic ache go through his chest when Steve unwrapped his gift.  The warmth of his smile, the way his whole attention focused on the palette, seeing it, understanding and appreciating the beauty and the symmetry, it was like Tony himself was seen, understood.  He wished Flying could be like Steve.  He wished
Tony breathed a sigh of relief, his whole body relaxing.  He knew he’d been keyed up, but he didn’t realize how much he didn’t want Flying to be Rumlow until he was sure it wasn’t.
.  It was quite brilliant, although I think you forgot to account for the lessened atmospheric pressure in the first section.”
“Right, and I wanted to play chess on those tables outside at lunch.  We learned, at home.  Justin Hammer told me it was his club and he wasn’t letting some scrawny Soviet rat get his dirty hands all over the chess sets.”
“Man, I remember this, I got you, Pieter.  So my boy steps up to Hammer’s ugly mug, tells him to do his homework, and that the game isn’t American but started in India and that most of the grandmasters have been Eastern European anyway, Russian included. Then he goes to the library, checks out the decades old chess set that I swear to god was covered in an inch and a half of dust, claims a new table and he crushes Pieter in an epic game of speed chess.”
“Steve.  Do you. You gotta take care of yourself.  Go see an ocean, stay on a beach somewhere, chop down some trees. The world’ll be okay.”
He was breathtaking.  Literally.  Tony’s breath literally stopped as the man pushed the door open, the sunlight framed his shoulders—broad shoulders, sure, but Neanderthalian? Not a chance.  They tapered into a waist that was just unfair, and legs that went on forever.  That, and it all supported the prettiest face he’d ever seen.
they weren’t talking face to face, where Tony knew he tended to be flippant, and slick, and smart.  Where he never let anyone see how he might be vulnerable.  Sure, yes, his closest friends knew, but it had taken a long time to get to that point.  He’d grown up with Pepper and Rhodey since they were all in matching diapers.
Tony took a deep breath and put his blinker on.  As he merged back into traffic, he felt Natasha’s small hand on his shoulder, squeezing lightly.  Maybe he
Jesus, when did picking up Thai food become a field trip? It had always been just him and Steve, and he liked it. It was time he got just with Steve.  It felt special, even if it was all in his head.  But Steve would always do stupid little shit like hold the door open for him and he even paid for the order, if he could sweet talk Mrs. S into taking his credit card instead of Tony’s.  It didn’t always work, but he tried. It made him happy, just hanging out together, getting him to smile.
Tony hung up on his call to Pepper, confident Batroc would be taken care of.  So, Rogers was maybe more than just a pretty face. And plush lips. And broad shoulders. And great ass. Maybe.  Well, maybe he’d actually be helpful, rather than just eye candy.  No reason Tony couldn’t have both, after all.  Seems like Barnes breaking into the house was possibly not the worst thing that had happened to him this week.  Certainly not any worse than the latest round of articles on him. Sure, some of them did report on the SI France deal, and the zika vaccine prototype SI had developed.  But most of them were still harping on the weapons that ended up in enemy hands.  And Tony was trying to find them—he was.  He got Obie to work on them right away, told him to take whatever part of financial and legal to find how the weapons got away from the company in the first place.  Obie would get to the bottom of it.  Tony relied on him, and Obie always pulled through. Always had an eye on the company.
And now he knew, anyway. He knew exactly what Steve had never been.  That this body was all a sham anyway. That the muscles came out of Howard’s lab, that Steve was masquerading in this body. That the real Steve was tiny, a sickly twig, who never caught anyone’s eye. Who Tony would never have looked at twice. Even if he had been interested in men.  In Steve. There had been rumors, back when Tony was younger, before Afghanistan.  But it had been years since those, and Steve obviously knew just how wrong the press had been.
“You shot him?” Rhodes asked Barnes, severely. Bucky and Natasha were both standing at attention, although technically Natasha’s gun was still pointed at Stane’s head.
Tony walked in on Steve, dressing in uniform, leather gloves lying on the dresser.  He wore enough of his own armor to recognize what this was.  He walked to his side, a squire in a modern universe, tightening the brown leather straps, smoothing them down.
“Well, look at that.  What is that, a Cubano? I didn’t know you had it in you. Just put it on the workbench.” Tony looked over. It smelled delicious. A hot blonde bringing him grilled sandwiches for lunch? That was worth taking a break for.  Even if the idiot was on the wrong trail about the weapons. “Dum-E, hold the prototype.” Steve looked affronted for a second. Tony laughed. “No, not you, blondie. Steve, meet Dum-E.  Dum-E, Steve.” He gestured to the claw holding the metal shards. He took off the gloves and wiped them on a towel, shoved his glasses onto the top of his head.
“Happy’s looking after him. He got out okay.  It was just a bank robbery, but they had tech they shouldn’t have been able to get their grubby little paws on. It’s a good thing the kid’s so bouncy.”
,” and Bruce’s (“Shakespearean Reference to Scientific Developments”). He had never been more grateful for whatever luck that plopped her squarely in his high school for his senior year.  His email pinged.
Was it possible for silence to sound amused? Because Steve was pretty sure it did.  Or maybe he was just overreacting, taking things personally.  He did that, he knew.  “Jarvis, did I…” He stopped.  He wasn’t actually sure what to ask.
Steve snorted.  Then, begrudgingly, he added, “She’s a big favorite with a lot of the guys overseas. They think she’s real pretty.”
Tony picked up his head, turned so he was staring at Steve full in the face. There was that smile again, but a bit shy maybe, a wry upturn in the corner of his mouth.  “I love you.  Thought you already knew that. Thought I’d given myself away.”
So maybe Tony didn’t hate magic entirely, since it had eventually led to him having a very enthusiastic Steve Rogers as his boyfriend. He was, after all, a scientist at heart, and there were all sorts of experiments he could do with a naked supersoldier in his bed.
“That he should think of less sexy things? That he’s a grown man, an Avenger for goodness’ sake, he should be able to control himself?”
, and then Steve would be back on the train and Bucky would be falling again. “Guess you always were too much of a little guy,” he’d say.  “I thought I could trust you.”
No, knowing Steve, he’d be just as quick to protect him, to listen to his advice, to back Tony’s play. Just as generous with giving credit to Tony when it was due. Just as unwilling to send Tony into a compromised situation, doing it only when there truly was no other way—and his tactical mind was better than anyone Tony had ever seen, Fury included.
“No rush,” Tony said, gesturing at his lap. “Take all the time you need for that.” Then he turned and sped off toward the elevator.
Steve looked up, haloed by the light illuminating the kitchen.  Reprieve.  Relief.  “Well, when they ship food, they ship staples.  Dry goods.  Grains.  Protein. Sometimes they ship vitamins.  But those two areas are already good for growing sour oranges, for onions.  Those will help with the malnutrition that can happen, even if the people are being fed. But even more than that, those components are indigenous to their diets.  That way, they can feel like home.  Even if they don’t really have one anymore.” He dropped his eyes to his plate.  “Even if there’s no home to go back to. They can start a new one, and it will feel familiar.” He paused. “It might be stupid. Why waste water on a greenhouse, right? But, if it can feel more like home…”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says. Like he’d said in the letter. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you. I didn’t mean to lie to you. I thought I’d have more time, so I could figure out how.”
Tony shoved Hammer into the nearest bathroom, his mind racing. How had Hammer even gotten into his—oh, fuck. How had he been so dumb? His passcode to the tool cabinet was the same as his phone.  And he’d opened that cabinet right in front of this asshole.  Fuck. “So, what, Justin? You going to tell my dad? Your dad? What? What does it take to buy scum like you off?” God, Hammer could ruin him.  His father.
“I hope it doesn’t piss you off, Sam, but we brought cookies, too,” Pieter chimed in, holding a platter of chocolate chip cookies.  “We were taught it’s bad manners to show up empty handed. Got that pretty well-burned into our brains.”
“Tony? Tony!” Nat flicked his knee. Ouch.  He’d sort of lost his train of thought.  “You want a soda?”
He started working on taking the suit’s filtration and shrinking all the components down so it was portable, lightweight.  He didn’t know why he hadn’t thought of it earlier. He didn’t bother constructing a design yet.  Steve would come and help him with it.  Did he need the help? No, probably not. But Steve had a good eye for design and he liked helping out.  Tony liked having Steve around.  Win-win.  Besides, Tony was, when it came down to the engineering of things, more function than form.
“I’m not lying, Mr. Stark,” Steve said, suddenly looking directly at him, blue gaze fully focused on Tony. That was breathtaking.
“You’re a ringer!” Tony accused. “You part of a league on Sundays or something? Instead of bowling, you and your friends play this course?”
“Noted,” Steve replied, evenly. Why wasn’t he a little more weirded out by what was going on? Shouldn’t he, of all people, be focused on the team acting like normal?
Tony pulled a blanket around him.  Dum-E rolled over and tried to poke it, but unsuccessfully.  He missed by a wide foot and a half.  Idiot.  Tony halfheartedly knocked his claw away.  Wasn’t his fault.  He opened a new tab, turned on Netflix, and tried to drown out his own thoughts.  Doubtless Howard would be trying to figure out how to do damage control, how to get his hands on Tony.  Who to bully to get the right info, the right story. How to protect SI stock. How to get Tony to pray the gay away.  School was probably a madhouse. School.  Tony hoped that Steve and Peggy were okay, but with Peggy in charge, there was no way anyone was going to railroad Steve.  She’d handle it. Hodge and Hammer would probably get what was coming to them after all.  Hopefully.
, Tony reasoned with himself.  Because Howard would goddamn never find out.  Not until Tony was living on his own, paying his own way, far far from his father.
Sometimes, if I have a really hard day or a really good day—I know that doesn’t make a lot of sense, that it’s both—I go to this place in Central Park.  I can see the bridge from it and it’s beautiful. It’s always beautiful. And it makes me feel like there’s something there, something that will always be there, that I’ll always have.  Somewhere that I’ll always have.  My life has been through a lot of changes, and it’s nice to have a constant.  I went there today, and I just thought that it would be so nice if you could have that feeling too.  Is there anything like that for you?
Tony jumped in for him. “Thor, I appreciate the offer, but Steve and I are gonna pick up Thai for the team so we can have it during movie night.”
Tony isn’t a doctor.  He isn’t even Bruce, wherever the hell he is.  He’s got nothing, just old-fashioned first aid, but he has to do something.  He washes the cut with soap and water. It has to sting.  Steve says nothing, just watches him, like the first time, blue eyes vivid and clear, framed by unreasonable lashes.  Tony stitches the wound up neatly and coats it with a mild antibiotic.  He’s not sure any of it will work.
The recording, scratchy and metallic, caught the loud, jolly sound of Iron Monger’s laughter.  “Yeah, it sure is, m’boy,” the American voice said heartily. “You’ll get your Jericho when you eliminate Tony Stark.”
“Thank you, Sir, that was awfully polite of you,” Steve jumped in, talking over him and looking at Rhodes intently.  That was sort of uncharacteristically disrespectful, Tony thought.  “Tony, Ms. Potts said you’d probably be going out for dinner, but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to have something to drink after the colonel’s hearings on the Hill.”
Steve browsed the options.  He clicked through a few websites.  Most of them were informational. Fewer hosted groups.  He finally landed on HowtoCarryIt.  The moderator was ex-Air Force, a counselor who seemed to be living what he was teaching. In his photo he had kind eyes.  His bio said that he lost a man on one of his missions.  When he’d come home, he didn’t know how to talk about it. He didn’t know how to reconcile that loss with how the world hadn’t stopped.  And that’s why he founded this site. A message board.  A regularly scheduled groupchat, open to anyone.  He was just in time.
“Maybe you should look for some new company then,” Natasha purred. “Wouldn’t want you to get bored.”
What was he supposed to write? So, had a really bad day? Punched any blond guys lately?  And maybe it wasn’t him. Maybe it was someone else. Maybe it was someone he’d never even talked to, although that wasn’t very likely, since Shield High was fairly small.  Tony had probably at least talked to every senior once.
The phone rang.  And rang.  And rang.  Dammit, Tony knew he was going to regret teaching Pepper how to bypass voicemail.  She was supposed to use it for when she was trying to get in touch with
“So hard to find good help,” he commiserated. “Good night, Tony.” He watched Tony’s retreating figure, Steve leaning heavily on him.
Steve gave him a tiny smile before getting back to business.  “If you see it, neutralize it. We want him alive, for trial, make him come clean.  Romanoff, close quarters, cut off retreat.  Barnes, cover the field. Anyone sees him make a move on Tony, take the shot.”
Steve thought.  He considered how to extricate himself from the situation, but he had been caught supporting Nat’s leg where he sat.  Eventually, he cleared his throat. Bucky just slid his mouth down to her neck, licking her throat and the divot between her collarbones.  The shirt he’d almost put on lay forgotten in a little russet heap on the floor. Finally, Steve gave up.
He’d wanted a drink.  If he was dying anyway, he could have one drink, right? The burn of the scotch hitting his throat, he could have that, one last time.
He hit send, then let out the breath he’d been holding.  It was risky. But if it was Pieter, if it was, then it was perfect. It would be so easy.  It would be… like magic, if Tony believed in that sort of thing.
Steve never stayed long in one place.  He liked little towns, where people didn’t immediately know who he was.  He liked drinking coffee in the open air in the mornings, hearing birds in mountain trees.  He liked the way the breeze smelled, outside the city.
"I'm sorry," Tony blurted, and fled. He didn’t wait to hear the rest of what was sure to be a polite, apologetic refusal. He was out of the car and locked in the workshop, total blackout, before Steve could get Jarvis to open the front door.
"Criminal? Says the guy who broke in? Literally broke windows,” Tony retorted, noticing the trail of glass on the floor, “to get in? What are you looking for—oh, don’t tell me—regeneration? Didn’t want to wait for something a little more government-issue?”
“Pleased to meet you, Ma’am. Ms. Potts.  Pepper, I mean,” he stumbled, blushing again.  Her gaze went even more shrewd.
Tony screwed around a little with a little gadget he’d been working on, propulsion-based.  Not a lot progress, but he wasn’t really trying, heart not really in it.  There wasn’t any food in the fridge anymore.  But Tony couldn’t bring himself to go out.  Or even order anything in.  Eventually he just trudged back to his bed.  Not much of a safe haven.  He curled up again, Netflix back on.  In some part, he just wished he wouldn’t have to wake up. Wouldn’t have to deal with tomorrow. With the end of today. With everything. It was overwhelming. It felt like there was no way out.
Steve took a deep breath.  This was crazy, but it had been the truth. He didn’t have anything else going on right now.  He could best afford to work this out.  And, after all, who knows—maybe he’d pick up some useful skills that would actually transfer to a new job, work his way out that way.  He turned to face Mr. Stark, squaring his shoulders a bit, falling into parade rest probably without thinking about it.
Tony sat up, pulled back. Steve’s heart plummeted, made his hands release where they were clinging to him. “Steve.” Tony ran a finger over Steve’s collarbones.  “It’s not a crush for me either.” He kissed the space at the base of his throat, still soft, put Steve’s arms back around him.  “I want as many nights and days as you’ll give me.”
“Almost, Sir.  I’m currently decrypting one rather stubborn piece of data.  As of now, nothing alarming. Covert but sanctioned missions throughout his tours, commendations for leadership. The last file seems to be protected with a digital key of some sort, but I am attempting to ascertain how to access it.”
Well, this was going great.  Fast friends.  Stark walked in an actual circle around him.  He prodded Steve’s bicep at one angle, made a motion like he was measuring his shoulders in another.
Was this what love felt like? The flutters and the hope and the intense feeling that good things could happen? Tony smiled as he flopped back in bed.  His parents had gone to Mallorca for Thanksgiving, so he’d be on his own. He was inspired.  Fuck it.  If this was what love felt like, he wanted to share.  He ran down and talked to Jarvis, then started a group text.
“Well, step up your game, Stark, or you know what I’ll do.  I’ll destroy you,” Hammer spit at him.  “Your father will disown you.  You’ll be out on the street within minutes. Your mother will have a goddamn heart attack and it’ll be your fault.” They could hear the sink turn on, water splashing.  A second later the door opened, and Hammer slung his arm quickly around Tony’s neck.
“Tony, why are you worrying about this? You’ve got years left. You’re young and healthy, right? Am I right?”
I was thinking about colleges.  You know, big deal, hearing back from them soon. Do you think I should consider how good the football team is? I’m not really into a lot of sports, but since you do play sports, do you think that will affect campus life?
Tony made coffee. Drank three cups of it.  He showered, brushed his teeth again.  He picked up his history textbook, read the two chapters, answered the homework, wrote the responses.  He read the first section of
Tony turned and shuffled into the room ahead of her, nerves jangling. Did he think Pieter was cute? He was.  A little scruffy, thin runners build—part of the cross country team, like Steve and Sam.  A vague hint of an accent somewhere, adding a layer of mystery.
“So, I was watching Natasha,” he said, winking, knowing that Tony knew he would never cheat, but teasing anyway. “She’s so small—do you think you could pop a parachute on the back of her suit?”
Tony’s own brain was divided. Half of it was still ogling Steve’s gorgeous chest, his abs.  Half of it was seeing red, clearly echoing Pepper’s rage, at the purpling bruises and angry welts on Steve’s skin.  And a good 20% was kicking himself for ogling an injured friend.  So he had 120% brains, what of it?
The corner of Steve’s mouth twitched.  “I don’t think you’re supposed to celebrate your PA sticking around for a couple weeks, Tony.  I think you’re supposed to tell the help to get back to work.” Tony’s easy prattle helped ground him.
Last night replayed through his mind.  Finding the blueprints.  Realizing they’d been changed.  By someone who clearly knew what he was doing.  Seeing how wrecked that someone had been.  Telling Jarvis to let the man get some sleep after his shower. Scanning the new additions back into the program and sending them out. After all, they were better now.  Sure, he had some question about what kind of trees Rogers seemed to want to plant and why, but he figured the man probably had some good reasons for it given all the other changes he’d made.  Or, hell, maybe he just had a green thumb.  A little green space wouldn’t hurt.  It might even give the people some hope.  Remind them that things still grew.  There was still potential.  And, speaking of things growing—wait for it, that there was an inappropriate physical response, especially while on the phone with his assistant.  Boss.  Think about something else, anything else.
Tony jumped up immediately. “Yes! This is great! Fifty bucks to the best costume! Hey, you,” he pointed at the next table, “you’re invited! Sam’s house, party, spread the word! You, yeah, you, you’re invited too! And you!”
Steve dropped his gaze, ashamed.  He moved toward the car, then hesitated. “I can’t.  It’s leather. I’ll mess it up.”
“I might forget, Tony,” Steve confided, his face perfectly straight.  “You’d better come to movie night to make sure I don’t start with the wrong one.”
Steve's face tries not to crumple, like he’s sad, like he doesn’t measure up, like he's trying not to admit it. Tony rewinds the scene in his head.  Oh.
Hammer was his normal douchey self, scooting a little too close to Nat, being a little too loud.  She kept inching away from him.  Finally she stood up. “I’m going to go find the bathroom,” she said.
“I don’t know if interview is the right term, unless interview is what all the kids are calling doing the dirty these days.”
Steve read a dossier on Natasha Romanoff, Bruce Banner.  The notes said Banner was somewhere in India, rural.  They had tabs on him.  Steve hoped they’d let him be.  If he’d found some peace, they should let him have it.
“No way. I call bullshit.  I saw the way he was checking you out the first day.  There’s absolutely no way he didn’t wanna tap that.  And if he actually ‘got to know you,’” he put airquotes around it, rolling his eyes, “like you say, then there’s no way.  Dude, Steve, if I was into dudes, I’d be all over you.  I mean, that sounds weird an’ all, but I mean it.  You know I thought Nat was hanging with our unit cause she wanted you, at the beginning, and you were so goddamn clueless I couldn’t even get mad at you for it. You’re a good guy.  The best.  And if he thought you were hot to begin with, I know, hand to God, he’d only want you more when he got to know you.” He raised his right arm high. “I’d put the other hand on a Bible, but, yknow.” He smirked.
“No, I just think, it’s been good.  But it’s run its course, right? Let’s just, kit-kat it.  Right? Before one of us gets bored. I mean, trial run, right?” Tony was so glad his voice sounded normal. Bored even.  He snuck a glance at Steve.
Tony smirked at him.  “You bet,” he said, smacking Steve’s butt as he walked away.  Steve hesitated at the door, not wanting to leave this magical world, reluctant to relinquish even a moment of this day. “I’ll be here when you get back,” Tony said, as if reading his mind, eyes on Steve, affectionate.  “I’ll be here.”
“But it’s such a pretty ass,” Barnes said, batting his eyelashes theatrically at Tony.  Tony rolled his eyes again.  At this rate, his mother was going to be posthumously right after all, and they would get stuck this way.
Then he remembers. Steve will give it all up. For him. The responsibility, the fear, it’s suffocating.  Tony blacks out the workshop and waits until he’s gone.
Then Steve stopped, caught himself, the motion of his fingers stilling over Tony’s face as he drew back. Tony could see the guilt there.  “Miss Potts,” Steve said, ashamed. He flushed, the red enticing, drawing beneath the split in his collar.  He looked away.  “I’m sorry.” As if it were Steve who had started it.  As if it had been Steve who was splitting them apart.
“So you said,” Tony replies.  “I get it. I hear you.  What do you want?” He should have told him.  It destroys Tony that he didn’t. That he kept it from him.  His mother. Rationally, he knows Steve would have told him, when he found a way.  Rationally, he can see it was Hydra, it wasn’t Barnes.  But unfortunately, only the suit is mechanized.  Tony Stark is still human.
Steve looked at Pepper.  Her mouth twisted.  “His mother died a few years ago.  It’s the anniversary.”
“—and I stood by you during your stupid ultimate Frisbee stage in high school.  I watched you burn up your insides with Howard Stark’s death ray—“
“The Colonel and Miss Potts,” Barnes called, swinging down from an alcove in the wall, however the hell he’d managed to get up there in the first place. “They just pulled in.”
“It’s his adopted dad’s hat,” Sam finished for him.  “Dude, you know Abe doesn’t mind when you call him that.  He likes it. He’d be hanging your crayon drawings on the fridge if you were still at that stage.” He clapped Steve comfortingly on the shoulder.
Rhodey just smirked at him.  “You have two of them in your bedroom, Tony. You don’t need to come play at my house.”
“No idea why,” Sam commented dryly. “Just the weight of the world on your shoulders.  No big deal, right?” He shook his head.  “Steve. Why don’t you take a break? There’s a lot of superheroes out there now.  Let someone lead for a while. When’s the last time you took a break?”
He wandered up to his room, brushed his teeth, took a quick shower—scrubbing Hammer off of him.  He settled into bed, grabbed his laptop, and opened his email.
Steve felt slightly guilty about that, but also it rankled him, SHIELD controlling everything he did. He clicked the little icon in the corner.  He was definitely supposed to be connected to that one—SHIELDWIFI08.  Subtle.  He scanned down the list, looking for one that was unsecured. There was one.  Coffeeshop247.  That had to be the little café around the corner.  He liked it.  He’d gotten breakfast there three times already—proper bagels and coffee.  And since he’d already spent money there, he didn’t need to feel bad about using the wifi.  Perfect.
Steve’s tux felt constricting, conspicuous. He twisted, trying to see if it fit right. Tony had apparently put an order in for it yesterday, and when you were Tony Stark, you could get a custom tuxedo in fewer than twenty-four hours.  He’d been working on an email chain from a bank in Monaco that they’d supplied—possibly against their will? He wasn’t really sure—when the tux had gotten delivered.
He’d already set most things in order.  Pepper would get control of SI with Obie to help her.  He’d write in a renewable grant for the British kids.  They were good kids, they could make huge progress in their fields. A large chunk of change for Rhodes.  Not like he needed it, but Rhodey had been with him through some of the worst times and never asked for a thing.  The rest of his estate would go to the Maria Stark Foundation.
Steve shook his head.  He actually didn’t know the protocol for this.  Normally he’d pack a bag lunch for himself, saving money. But how would he do that if he wasn’t going to be going home? He grimaced. It wasn’t even really home.  He was just crashing at Natasha’s, anyway.  It wouldn’t be hard for whichever person ended up going to get his stuff.  It was still all packed into his old military duffle.
Steve noted the way that Tony gazed at him, the way his eyes seemed to run over his body like a physical touch.  He looked briefly at the coffee cup, his sketches affixed to the walls. Tony watched Steve’s face settle into a determined look, his shoulders square.  That was his “Rogers, you can do this, you’ve punched Hitler” face.  Tony loved that face.  It did all sorts of shivery things to him.  He watched Steve move slowly toward him, eyes darkening, tracking his movements, all intent and focus. Unmistakable.  He looked downright predatory.  Damn.
“Mr. Stark, these galas are the best. You’ve got to let me come to the next one. This is the best job,” Steve said, on the edge of slurring.
Stern’s synthetic smile never left his face.  Maybe it had been surgically set.  Plastic surgery was common in his crowd. “Actually, I wanted to talk to your assistant.”
Sorry, this was a really long email.  I just haven’t ever been able to talk to anyone about it before.  Ever.  You’re like this amazing secret place where I’m just me, no expectations, no pressure.  I really appreciate it.  Maybe I’m not ready for the world to know that I’m gay, but I’m so glad that I can talk with you about it.
“Let’s uh, let’s just go with Tony, shall we? Since you’ve seen me almost naked and broken into my workshop already.”
“Well, you’re not wrong,” Tony says. “Although I don’t understand how they don’t see it’s your chest on display just because it doesn’t have a shiny white star on it.  Of course, I guess they haven’t come all over that chest before.” He says it without thinking.  No, that’s not true. He knows it will hurt them both.  He says it anyway.
Tony looks down at the bowl.  It’s alphabet, tiny letters of pasta swimming around.  He pokes at them, rearranging them into words, wishes he could unscramble his thoughts as easily. Steve’s watching him still.
Steve knew Star Wars was one of Tony’s favorite movies.  “Iconic,” he’d called it. “Formative.”  Still, it was also about space, and Tony’d had an up-close encounter not too long ago.  Normally, Steve sat next to Tony on the couch, but that seat was obviously occupied, and Steve figured he was actually better off in the armchair, where he could keep an eye on Tony more discreetly.  Distract him if he started looking peaky, or just shut the whole thing down entirely.  He could always claim to be too overwhelmed by the special effects, play up the old-guy thing. He could usually still get away with that.
By the time they finally took Loki down (again), Steve was over it.  It was getting old.  This time the delusional demigod had kidnapped three of Odin’s household, taking them for who knows what sort of reason. As Tony always said, you couldn’t reason with crazy.  The battle had taken all night, Loki setting traps at every corner. In retrospect, it had been a good night.  Tony’s modifications to the Iron Man suit let him see through Loki’s projections.  Sam had been invaluable with Redwing.  And when Tony went off plan, seeing an opening they hadn’t anticipated, he’d warned them over the comm.  They’d fought together better than ever.  But it had still been a long night.
“What am I, a soccer mom?” Tony complained, but no real fire in it.  Yeah, they could definitely pick up Jimmy.  He’d much rather his anonymous pen pal was Morita than Douchey McDoucheface.  If Flying was really Rumlow, he’d done a great job of layering on the asshole over the nice guy who was hiding inside.  “Sure, we can go get OtherJim.”
, not to use it on her boss.  Former boss.  Employee.  Damn.  Tony reached out blearily to find his phone.
A pot of mac’n’cheese. Still warm to the touch.  Natasha then.  She hadn’t left a note, and the door was relocked. He didn’t know how she’d found him, or how she’d gotten in, but it was definitely her.  She had a skill set no one else did.  Where she picked it all up was a big question, but he put it out of his mind for now, picking up the pot and a spoon and dragging it back to his bed.
“What happened? Tell me nobody kissed me,” he joked, eyes flying open.  Steve Rogers: beautiful, light behind him, hair falling damply in his face, eyelashes filtering the sunlight.
Finally, as Wanda demurely slid all the tootsiepops into her giant hoard, flipping over a two of diamonds, a six of hearts, and a ten of clubs, they all surrendered.  She shared, though, and that’s what mattered, opening a raspberry flavored lollipop while they tried to figure out what movie to put on.
I definitely saw that Discovery movie—I don’t think there’s anyone left who hasn’t.  But isn’t that astronaut sort of a jerk? He seemed way too hot-headed. I mean, if you like astronauts, what about that one in the sci fi movie, where they’re going to restart the sun?  He’s fictional, but it fits in with your Wonder Woman thing better, about doing the right thing.  He definitely stands for the greater good, and making sure things are done right, even at his own expense. If you haven’t seen it, you should look it up.
He would not be Stern.  He would not. The stupid thing about the Chihuly was a pretense in the first place; Tony didn’t need the money. Steve was free to go, and he should. Away from Tony. Away from men who thought they were above the law, that their money and their sway granted them privilege.  Stern.
Then he stopped completely.  Put down the filter.  He looked at the coffee cup sitting next to him.  The tight clutch Steve was keeping on the SHIELD notes.  The rosy blush on Steve’s cheeks.
“Well, high school then. It’s quintessentially high school anyway.  Once you can drive, and then you can pretend to play mini golf and really just mess around in the back seat with your date.”
He hadn’t worked with Mr. Stane, not since that initial meeting.  Stane made him uncomfortable. No real reason.  And he didn’t want to be rude, especially since he’d just met the man and Tony seemed to trust him so much.  But there was something he didn’t like about him.  Something about the overly friendly, smugly jovial tone that Stane used. It made Steve feel small, again.
Natasha had moved to cover the other side of the room, keeping an eye on the doors.  “Pepper said Colonel Rhodes is on his way, Hogan is having a shit fit, and she’s flying him back in tonight.  She is rounding up the lawyers and she said that Stane was supposed to have an appointment in,” she checked her watch, “just a few minutes so she wanted to bring in private security.” She pulled another gun from the small of her back and slid it over to Steve.  “I told her not to bother.”
He laughed, throwing a baseball cap at her.  “Who’s going to come with me, you? I think you’re still on the active duty roster, Romanoff.”
“Alright, J.  Take it off his bill.” Tony tossed a glance toward Steve to see his mouth hanging open.  “Close your mouth, kid, before you pick up flies.  You saved the company money. You earned it.”
When Steve got back to the tower, he’d put the idea mostly out of his mind.  It wasn’t a big deal.  He’d get over it.  Then he saw Tony, finishing the last of the coffee pot in the kitchen, fiddling with a stylus and a Starkpad, and he had never felt so desperately, achingly alone.  For the first time, he felt completely hollow, he had nothing left to give. He filed paperwork for a leave of absence immediately. He gave himself a month.  He’d take his cell phone. If they really needed him, they could call. He sent out an email to the team.
“Okay, call me back, I think I’m going to talk to Mr. Coulson tomorrow,” Pepper responded absently, probably already listing the requirements for how to start the charter for a new club.  A gay club.  A gay-straight alliance, knowing Pepper.
Selvig spoke a little more to Dr. Erskine, then waved to the others and backed the volvo out of the driveway.
That stung, because he was right. Tony had been a mess.  He had been. Irresponsible and stupid, young, a complete disaster.
For two weeks, Steve lurked.  That was the term.  He signed up, read other people’s grief, their guilt.  And he felt it all.  All these men and women, people he could have saved if he hadn’t gone under. And what was the point of having put down the plane, of having missed out on everything if the world hadn’t really changed at all?
Tony didn’t say much on the ride back.  It took almost half an hour.  The clock on the dashboard said 1:12 when they got back to the tower. Steve sat in the passenger seat, fiddling with a small chain around his wrist, not asking questions.  He didn’t ask how he’d been found.  Maybe he hadn’t thought about it. On the other hand, with a brain like the one who made the changes to the blueprints… Not likely.  Maybe he was just tired.  He had run well over twenty miles.  If Tony had been anyone else, no telling where he would have ended up.  In fact, without Jarvis, it still would be hard to say.  That, and, of course, Tony had been pacing him for almost an hour.  He knew that look—the terrorized, haunted feel.  Guilt? Remorse? That was the look of a man being chased. By his own actions, his own sins.  Maybe the sins of others as well.  Well.  He knew how that felt, too.
“Jesus, Steve.  We weren’t all raised in the Great Depression you know. Were you going to boil that, too?”
He did it.  He’d really done it. Tony delicately placed the triangle in the redesigned core.  He’d had to modify the device to accept the hypothetical element, making the reactor currently in his chest seem outdated and clumsy.  Well, he preened smugly, the previous reactor was based on Howard’s work, anyway.  This new one, this was all his.  His baby, so to speak, but cooler and with less mess.  He looked around at the devastation that used to be a workshop.  So maybe not less mess.  But less smelly, anyway.
Apparently no one else seemed to notice much of a change.  Steve did make waffles, and bacon, while Peter edited the video of the battle he’d taken with his phone to a highlights reel. He was still sidelined until he was older, but Tony’d set him to filming.  He got to see the fight, walk through the strategies with the team afterward. Tony scrambled a few dozen eggs to go with the waffles and bacon.  Natasha made coffee, showing Thor how to do it for at least the fifth time.  Clint set the table, and Sam poured juice for everyone.
Coulson stepped just inside the doorway.  “Come now.” Now he did grin a little.  “I brought the Lola, and she’s parked on the roof.  I don’t want to get a ticket for nothing.”
“You asked for it?” Tony was across the room from him, moonlight glancing off of the blue glass of his lenses. His posture was too still. Too stiff.
“Steve?” Tony asks when he picks up the phone.  He doesn’t need to ask. No one else left him a little flip phone.  No one else underdelivered on his promises so spectacularly.
Tony chuckled.  “He didn’t.  I noticed one night.  You came downstairs, just a pair of sweats on, saw I was still working, and disappeared.  You showed up an hour later, too.  After that, it was almost like I wanted to keep working so I could keep getting haunted by the ghost of Christmas Sexy.”
“So, I know you like numbers.  So I thought you might be interested to know that while the general population is about 10% gay, Shield High apparently only has two.  Gay.  Guys.”
“Nice!” Rhodey exclaimed, going for a fist bump.  “Relax, Barnes, I owe you one. Besides, you’re not in uniform.”
He sighed and stretched, arching his back to relieve the stress. “Look, Pepper has some paperwork to sign, Happy’s got some sort of background check forms, just indulge him, it makes it easier for everyone, and don’t let him bully you, not that he could with all that,” he flapped his hands toward Steve again. “And then I need someone to call the French division of SI and see where the negotiations are for the new StarkPhone, so I guess that means you.  Don’t worry, you don’t need to speak French. Just get the update.  Make sure you talk with both the SI leads and also with the French telecom authority.  I’d like to get that done within a week, but if they say two, we can live with it.  I’m pretty sure that’s what Pepper said, anyway. Alright, Rogers.  Thanks for lunch. I can’t remember when I had lunch last.
He got into bed, pulling the covers over himself and turning out the lights.  The kitten shuffled its way around the bed and over him, padding over some very sensitive areas a number of times.  Steve just winced, trying to stay still.  Not like kittens knew what they were doing, and at least it wasn’t using claws.  Finally Romeo turned around and tucked himself into a little ball.  Satisfied that he was going to stay settled, Steve drifted off to sleep.
“I’ll catch you tomorrow, right? Filtration masks?” Tony tried to keep his voice even, avoid that pleading, needy tone he was feeling.
After lunch, May would escort him to the gym.  He was fairly sure there were cameras, sensors, tracking his performance, his exertion, seeing if his body measured up to Erskine’s notes.  To Banner.  Seeing where his limits were.  He broke a punching bag on the first day.  It was replaced when he returned.  He broke the replacement. They set him on an indoor running track. They said it was to help him train.  So they could increase the speed, change the settings. Keep him agile. Steve was pretty sure it was so he couldn’t go running around in public, where anyone could see him.  Where his interactions wouldn’t be carefully scripted.  But he didn’t complain.  He did understand.  He was a liability.
Steve draws in a deep breath. It quavers.  “No.  I lost him.  I lost him and they found him and now, he’ll never be the same.  He remembers everyone.  Every single hit they sent him on.  It’s most of why he’s in cryo, I think.” Steve at last looks at him.  “I lost perspective.  I couldn’t lose you that way.  I had to stop you because you would have killed him.  And you’ve been drowning in guilt as long as I’ve known you. I would have lost you, the person I know, the person I… The Tony Stark I know would have been gone. We’ve all killed people, in battle. It weighs on us. This was different. You’re not a murderer, Tony.  I had to stand for you.  The way you would have done for me. The way you do. Always making sure I’m the best version of myself I can be.”
I know you said you don’t have plans for Thanksgiving.  What with your family and all.  And I just wanted to let you know that I am around.  We don’t have a lot of extended family, so we usually just roast a chicken and call it a day.  But I’ll be thinking about you.
By the time the delivery arrived at the tower, the team was back and squished onto the couch.  Tony was in the middle, looking slightly crowded.  Well, not the middle.  Hulk took up more than half, so he was sandwiched in between a very large Hulk on one side and a slightly smaller Norse god on the other.  Natasha was perched on the back of the couch, playing with his hair. The goat was on the floor.
When Steve got back to the tower, he’d put the idea mostly out of his mind.  It wasn’t a big deal.  He’d get over it.  Then he saw Tony, finishing the last of the coffee pot in the kitchen, fiddling with a stylus and a Starkpad, and he had never felt so desperately, achingly alone.  Hollow. He filed paperwork for a leave of absence immediately. He’d take his cell phone. If they really needed him, they could call. He sent out an email to the team.
He was in a tiny town, far from anywhere resembling a city, renting out a room in the only motel in town. The whole building only had three units and the bedspread looked to be something knitted by the old lady who ran the place, but it had a percolator instead of a single-cup brewer, so he was actually very pleased with it, on the whole. It had a shelf of books—take one, leave one.  The shelf was clean, but the books had that smell to them, the dusty smell, the one that said they had forgotten how it felt to be read. He had picked up a cookbook, was halfway through the poultry section learning about duck a l’orange, when he heard a familiar thud outside.  He sighed, closing the book.
His phone pinged, and Tony’s heart rate sped up in a pavlovian response.  It was a text.  Fuck.  Then his heartrate really did speed up.  It was from Hammer.
Peggy strode over to Pepper, a ragged shirt and a packet of Neosporin still in her hands. “He won’t listen to me, Pepper,” she pleaded.  “I told him he should press charges against the monster but he won’t do it.  Says Brock’s going through a difficult time!”
“Give me that, pizza snob,” he demanded, grabbing his plate and sitting at the counter.  “You’re actually worse than your friend.  And he broke a Chihuly.”
Then a screenshot of ShieldSpies, announcing that Tony was gay, blasting his emails. And trending.  Fuck.
Sif put Loki’s collar back on him, handcuffs around his wrists.  Thor apologized, accompanying the other Asgardians outside to transport them back. Clint kept his arrow trained on Loki the whole time, hoping he’d twitch funny and give him an excuse.  Tony looked around, but Bruce had somehow vanished, and Natasha was shutting the door on the two of them.  The door clicked, and then a muffled clanking came from the other side.
“Sir has actually been developing the program since he was at MIT.  His first notes about the program were taken just after his 16
This morning, Pepper had forwarded him a story that was published overnight, alleging that Tony Stark had sold weapons to three Russian supermodels when he had a sordid orgy with them that night.  It was obvious garbage.  Not that Tony couldn’t get a supermodel to come home with him, if he wanted—the more Steve was around him, the more he couldn’t help notice how attractive and charismatic Tony was—but he’d been working all night, finally dropping onto a couch in his workshop, fluffy hair a mess, around 3am.  In fact, Tony hadn’t spent a night out, or brought anyone home, since Steve had started working there. Steve knew, because he’d started waking up to check on Tony every hour.  It was routine, now.  It left him a little tired, but he couldn’t help it.  If he went to sleep before Tony, he’d try to sleep through the night, but he’d wake up on the hour, unable to get back to sleep until he checked on him.  It was a holdover from the army, he knew, totally irrational.  But that impulse to make sure that his people were still there was ingrained habit, now.  The only difference was that now, apparently, Tony was one of his people.  He’d always been a mother hen.  Bucky’d teased him about it mercilessly, calling the Commandos “Steve’s ducklings.”  But he couldn’t help it.  He couldn’t allow himself to lose someone.
Through nearly closed eyes, he could see the light shift as Natasha moved to stand in the doorway. They’d have to get through her to get out.  She leaned casually against the doorframe but the gun in her hand was unmistakable.  Steve moved out of the shadows to stand behind Tony.
Natasha shrugged.  “You’ve got a secret. We’ve all got secrets.” She looked down for a second, at her hands. “Yours is one you need to protect.  From your family.  You don’t need to tell me. But you can, if you want.”
Steve knew it hadn’t really been a mistake. Stern definitely had ulterior motives to getting Bucky off the list. It was a clear ploy.  Stern had been trying to corner Steve all night, been dogging him since before then.
“Christine Everhart, Mr. Stark. What do you say to rumors that you sold weapons to the Russians at an orgy with supermodels and are holding the money in Dubai?” she asked, smiling as if she’d caught him.
Tony’s done with it.  He grabs Steve and flies to the tower. When they touch down, Steve’s skin is clammy and pale, but he stops outside, plants himself firmly, and says, “The cuffs.”
At the front of the room, Steve raised an eyebrow, but said nothing.  He added a note about the filtration masks for the team and then asked for team input.
As they pulled into the driveway, Tony watched Steve closely as Steve seemed to memorize the way their hands looked.  Tentatively, he reached out his hand to Steve’s face, lightly ran the tips of his fingers down his smooth cheek, electricity sparking at his fingertips and warming him entirely. This was what it felt like to be burning alive and want no relief. He dragged his fingers to the corner of Steve’s mouth, gently pulling Steve to him, slowly, softly, aching in every cell for Steve to turn and kiss him, to want him, to choose him.
So maybe, maybe, if everything went right, she’d have to wait a little longer for total control of SI.  He didn’t think she’d mind.
“You shot me!” Stane roared at him. Colonel Rhodes burst into the room, Pepper only a few steps behind him.  “That man shot me!” Stane bellowed to the Colonel. “Arrest him!”
Tony’s jaw dropped as his hand had a sandwich halfway to his mouth.  He snapped it closed.  Then he seemed to reconsider and took a bite of his sandwich, a strange look chasing across his face and disappearing.  “Huh, the army definitely didn’t teach you how to cook. Where’d you learn to do this? Nevermind, it doesn’t matter. Even Pepper couldn’t cook.  Did you taste this?”
Tony blushed, looking at the screen.  Jesus.  He was blushing from reading words.  Just words.  Not even porn or anything, just knowing that Flying thought about him.  “a lot.” And he signed it, “Love.”
“Well. I guess maybe we took a break, huh? Decided it wasn’t for us?” his voice quavered, just a little, heart racing, imploding, trying to break free of his ribs.
They loaded into the car, everyone. Tony’d had to borrow the Q7, but he didn’t mind.  Pepper hopped in the front seat, Rhodey in the next, and Peggy still fussing a bit over Steve in the back.
“If I lose him, I lose everything.” Steve looked at her directly. This was what he knew.  He knew loss.  And he’d just lost so much already.
“No,” he said, moving closer, smiling up at him.  “Graphic design, maybe.  I think that’s more your speed.”
“Tony?” Steve called, quiet. Tony looked over his shoulder and Steve noticed again how tired he looked.  How worn down. “Am I really the second longest running PA you’ve ever had?”
“But then I realized, I’ve already taken him out once.” Stane scoffed, almost a laugh. “It should be easy enough to do it again.”
Tony lost control, breath sharp as he came.  He grabbed a rag and a wet wipe.  Thank god he kept those around in the workshop.  Cleaning himself up, he calmed his breathing.  Tossed both the rag and the wipe into the trash bin.
“So, the point is to make sure you can feel everything, right, but to not let your fingers get burnt off again,” Tony summarized.  “This is what I’ve got now. It’s a neoprene base, but it has Kevlar armor to let you punch things, since I know it’s one of your favorite activities, and magnetic pulses on the gauntlet to call back the shield.  Also, the finger tips have increased sensitivity, they’re almost as sensitive as your fingers normally are, but they have a layer of shielding.  Not like the Kevlar, it won’t stop bullets and it’s not really flame proof, but it’s a start for right now.” He was a little frustrated. He hadn’t found anything that would keep sensitivity and be truly protective. Not yet.  But Steve needed it, and he couldn’t help feeling a little extra motivated.  He loved taking care of Steve, who rarely asked for anything. It was infuriating, really.
The reactor was still recognizable, but stretched into a nautilus, winding around itself.  It was beautiful, like a flower in the midst of unfurling.  The next page patterned the shape geometrically, as if Gatsby had decided to forgo his green light in favor of a love affair with an arc reactor.  The following sketch pulled the reactor into four dimensions as much as it could while using only two.  Tony had never thought about it like that.  There was so much potential.  He turned the page again.  The center of the arc reactor, the heart, encircled by an orbiting set of external lights.  It looked like a hyper stylized flower.  Or a solar system.  It was beautiful.  Was it hubris to get a drawing of something you made framed, if someone else had drawn it and it wasn’t quite your original creation? What would Miss Manners say? Emily Post? Emily Gilmore? Screw that. What would Pepper say? She was always a good judge of what was tasteful.  Tony’s wry humor came back to him.  He could leave it to her.  If Steve said it was okay.  He could leave her a giant rendition of his true heart.  The thing that made him see the need to do good in the world.  To leave behind something better than himself.  Sure, it might kill him, but it made him have a life worth living.  Better not tell her the killing him part.  She probably wouldn’t like it as much.
Outside school, Tony checked his phone for an email. Nothing.  He locked his phone, and slipped it into his pocket.  Everything was fine.  AP Bio was still a cakewalk, Theoretical physics was still at a point where he could do it with his eyes closed—even if Dr. Selvig did try to accelerate the curriculum—and in English they were still talking about Hamlet.  Well, he knew something about daddy issues.  Everything was fine.  Until lunch, when Mr. Coulson took his goddamn phone.
He apologized.  Steve apologized for being such an ass. He didn’t blame Loki, not exactly, but Loki’s staff certainly did bring out the stubborn in the man.  But, Tony thought, in retrospect, that stubbornness, although it might be a pain—he really was such a mule—was what made him dependable. Made him steadfast. It wasn’t that Steve wouldn’t change.  He would. Tony thought about the way that Steve found the weapons onboard the helicarrier.  Even with Loki’s staff sowing dissension.  He thought about the way that Steve adapted his strategy given what Tony told him about the Chitauri, during the battle. Even just a few days in a new world, a new future, with really nothing left of his past. No better way to get caught up with the times than spending time with a futurist.
Fuck. This was really fucked up.  He was dying, when he’d just created life. Christ, this was irony at its finest.  He’d found the key to surviving and it was downstairs in the hands of his first bot.  Well, the claw of his first bot. If there was a god, Tony bet he’d be laughing his goddamn head off.  It hurt to breathe.  It hurt to sit there and die, too, but there wasn’t anything he could do about it. He was really going to die here.  On his goddamn couch in his own fucking living room. Hell, if he could breathe, he’d be laughing at the situation, but maybe that was the lack of oxygen speaking. He could feel himself getting hysterical.
Tony tried to imagine Steve as a middle schooler.  He just came up with an unbearably cute image of a kid with fluffy blond hair, sticking up all over like a duck, big blue eyes, and probably more of that cocky smirk that sometimes showed up. He wished he could have seen it.
She peered at him doubtfully over the video call.  “Okay, Tony. We’ll write up a contract for Steve.  Oh, and Mr. Stane is going to come see you this afternoon.  Something he wants to discuss with only you.”
“Hulk shrank down to Bruce around midnight. Took about eight hours.  Thor and Natasha both seem to have burned it off in their sleep—SHIELD’s estimates put it at around 3am, maybe 4.  The lady said she was aiming for a twelve hour dose.  I think she hit it pretty close.  They haven’t shown any symptoms since they’ve woken up, and Nat and I went running at six.”
When he parked at school, he took one last look at himself in the rearview mirror.  This was it.  Taking a deep breath, he stepped out of the car, nearly tripping over Natasha.
“Captain, sir left a new arc reactor with Dum-E.  It has not been tested, but the current circumstances seem to make that irrelevant.  It could save his life.”
“Let’s get this cleaned up and get back to the Tower. Do your tox screens ASAP.  I want to do a debrief in an hour,” Steve said, voice steady and sexy and well, normal. “Tony, looks like your tech saved you from being dosed by whatever that was.  We should think about incorporating something similar in our go-bags.  Do you think you could create something for the rest of us?”
Tony’s face flushed, then went pale.  When he looked at his hand it was actually trembling.  It was like someone had put his own thoughts, right there, on the screen, out in public.  Someone braver than him, anyway.  Downstairs, he could hear Jarvis moving around, probably setting out his toast.  His mother was already drifting into her parlor, a glass of coffee in one hand.  Coffee and amaretto.  Howard was already gone.  He had been for a week.  There was little chance anyone would come up and disturb him.  Holding his breath, he created a gmail account.
“Still a disappointment,” he said, almost regretfully.  He stood up and stretched.  “Well, m'boy,” he said, his tone perking up, becoming businesslike, “I told Miss Potts to make an appointment for me to meet you here at 4:30.  So I’ll be back in,” he checked his watch, “just about an hour to find you.  Don’t worry.  We’ll make a big event of it.  Flowers, the whole works.” He wiped the pliers on his shirt, pressed Tony’s fingers against them, set them on the table, and walked away.
“Why did you bring a goat?” Steve asked, looking at what appeared to be a very confused goat now sitting on the conference table.
Steve knew better than to assume the claw was just a claw, and nodded.  “Pleased to meet you, Dum-E.”
“Why, Tony, do you not want to stay up with me? I can show you how Asgardians call it a night,” Thor rumbled suggestively.
On the bed, the kitten shimmered, expanding and reshaping to become a fully armored trickster Asgardian, horned helmet and all, lying spread out in Steve’s blankets.  Well, at least he was fully clothed, Steve thought, thanking whomever was still available for that small mercy.
Everyone else seemed pretty satisfied. Natasha gave Sam a round of Krav Magra lessons.  Said she’d learned it overseas (she was as vague as ever) and wanted to toughen him up.  Steve had made Pepper a gorgeous painting, reminiscent of the Obama posters, but with Pepper as the star.  The entire group agreed they’d vote for her.  Pepper had made Peggy a scrapbook of her time she’d been in the States, with extra pages to fill in throughout next semester.
Sometimes he’d wake to a car backfiring.  Sometimes to nothing at all.  He’d sit, not breathing. His chest felt like it was cracking, like whatever was inside him might spill over and it was his, his guilt, his fault. There was no one else.  These were Steve’s nightmares, his history, his past.  This was his record, blemished and tattered, and the blame was his alone.
Still.  He missed him. He missed the way that Tony ran his hands through his hair when he was in the middle of a project, leaving smudges. He missed the look Tony gave him when he brought him food in his workshop, like cooking him lunch was a work of genius and kindness that no one had ever done before.  He missed the startling way that he could break down what he was working on so that Steve could understand it, using him as a sounding board for his ideas, and listening when Steve occasionally had a suggestion.  His intensity when he was excited, the softness when he was tired. The wry wit and quick jokes. His smile.
“For being a drama queen? I mean, probably. She’s on her way back and you stink. When you’re showered, I’ve got news.  Good news.”
The spark, the light that was in Tony’s eyes went out.  “Good job, kid. J, music.” He turned away from Steve and Steve felt the cool dismissal again.  Drums and guitars clashed, serenading his exit.
Tony can’t help but laugh.  Stubborn little shit.  “Yeah, I think he said something about that. I think he was more embarrassed for you when you said you were from Jersey.”
“Yeah, that’s the one.  So, imagine, just for a second, if he got put in charge of an integrated unit.  A few women under his command—the beginnings of combat for women, trying to win their way into true combat positions with combat pay. Trying to prove themselves. Had to… get his approval… to get through.” She made a face, meaning clear.
“Why did it have to be you?” Phillips would ask, disgusted, becoming Schmidt, becoming Bucky, while Steve’s body gradually turned to ice, surrendered to the chill of the Atlantic. “Why did it have to be you?”
After an hour, the therapist had told him that he should try a survivor’s guilt message board.  Steve didn’t know if that’s what the therapist told everyone she saw.  After all, it’s not like they’d had a deep conversation about how he was dealing. And he didn’t really think there was a handbook on how to help recently defrosted men from the 1940s readjust to the modern world. She’d mostly just watched him catalogue the titles of the books and try to remember the names of the flowers on the coffee table.  And she’d explained wifi.
Pepper handed the pie to Jarvis, then took off her coat and matching gloves. “Last week.  I freeze them, so there’s always a few lying around in case there’s an unexpected party.” She grinned, obviously pleased with herself.  “Jim went to pick up Sam and Steve, and Natasha and Bruce were right behind me.”
They gave him a heavily redacted paper file about a hammer.  Redacted, but not enough.  Clearly they’d found a being of enormous power, capable of near god-like actions. And he’d found himself a girlfriend.  Steve had to smile at that.
“Shut the fuck up.  I mean, I get what you’re saying about Macbeth (witches, lady Macbeth) and about Othello. But Hamlet isn’t gay! I’d know!” Send.
“What are you supposed to be?” he asked Tony, looking over his boxy suit and fake moustache. “And what’s with the metal bagel on a stick?”
Tony, it’s like fifty feet from your front door to theirs. I’ve literally walked it before when I had to return that water bottle to Pieter.  It took less than a minute.
Mr. Morita just chuckled.  “We like smart people in this family. Speaking of which, this is totally new.  It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. I can’t even tell you exactly what it is. But you’ll like it.” He popped open the box Jim had brought over.  It was a thick, heavy disc, dull silver.
“Jesus, Steve. I want you inside me, darling. I want to fuck you so bad. I want you to come down my throat. God I want everything.” Tony was shaking, desire thrumming through him.
Steve hurried to the elevator, looking back as the doors closed, eyes obscuring something Tony couldn’t pinpoint.
PFCer: Half my unit is gone. And I watched it all happen.  Right off base, right in front of me.  And I was sick that day, couldn’t go on patrol.  Fucking stomach bug.  One minute I got my head in a fucking bucket, dumping my guts, and there’s an explosion, rocked the whole fucking camp.  I shoulda been on that patrol.
Steve paused.  “No. I. I just want to hold you, know that you’re safe. That you’re mine.” He hesitated again. “That I won’t lose you, too,” he added, quiet, so quiet. Tony wasn’t even sure he was meant to hear.
“J. Send the esteemed senator a note.  Tell him to release his hold on Barnes or we go public on that story. Don’t even use the contract.  Just tell him that Stark Legal is taking Barnes’s case on, pro bono, with all the magic of Pepper’s PR team, and we will have the distinguished purple cross veteran polished up and pouring his heart out to Anderson Cooper before Stern can finish lunch. It will ruin him. His constituents will burn him in effigy by dinner. Hell, not just Anderson.  He’ll do an afternoon show with Ellen and then I will personally have Happy shuttle him over to tear up for Oprah.”
He took a deep breath and splashed water on his face.  It was going to be okay. He went back out to his friends.
.  That’s what he used to call himself when he was in school and competing in kickboxing.  But he’s just a low-level bureaucrat.  There’s no way he has the money to buy a yacht.  Especially not one like that.  Not on his own. And I read through HammerTech’s public declarations for the French market—they want to release their new model early next week.  I think he’s trying to get a jump on you.”
“I would be very,” Tony said, licking Steve’s nipple, “very, disappointed,” he continued, biting down sharply, “if that were the case.” Steve’s body jolted under him.  Tony pressed tiny kisses up Steve’s neck, softly, leading to his mouth. Then his mouth was on Steve’s and they were kissing, slower, sweeter than he’d ever imagined. Tony sighed, smiling, Steve could feel the gentle curve against his own lips.
He might have just lost out on the whole thing.  What if Mr. Stark decided to scrap the whole idea after this? After all, it wasn’t like he’d done very much to help—he’d what, brought him some food? He’d barely lasted a day. Mr. Stark wanted a PA, not a wise guy.
Tony was beyond embarrassed.  It was true.  But somehow putting this all in front of this relative stranger—especially a stranger who actively disliked him less than a few hours ago—made him feel exposed.  “Sure.  Well, you know, probably hung over or drinking, I don’t really remember, and you know, liquid, makes you think about water, and so, you know, wells…” Tony babbled.  “So, I’ve got to go, thanks for food.” He practically ran out of the room, hooking another slice onto his plate as he left, but he could hear Steve quietly ask Jarvis another question.
Wanda followed close behind him.  “Besides, this is our mom’s recipe.  She taught Pietro when he was little. He does okay.”
is about men ensuring that women never hold power.  Don’t stress—you’ll be fine.  If you want to hash out your ideas, just let me know.  I’m here for you.”
Tony mutters a few curses. “You can’t just go romping around the tower. I don’t know what you want me to do.  I mean, what, you wanna strip down where you are?”
Steve didn’t want to spoil the mood, not when everything he wanted was here, in his arms, in his bed, and keenly receptive, but he had to make sure.  “Tony,” he said, struggling to control his breathing, to stay still.  “It’s not just a crush, for me, I don’t just want tonight.”
Erskine had been in and out of SI for years, right up until Project Rebirth. Nice guy, as Tony remembered.  Kind, always with an encouraging word. But he’d died years ago. And now Howard was gone, clearly Tony had been left in the dark, and Steve had somehow gotten himself discharged.  And Stern thought he could send the wolves after him, get him back into the fold, back under his lecherous, grubby thumb.
Oh god.  He knew that smug, oily voice. The voice that told a warlord to kill Tony.  He’d heard it say “m’boy” before, not even a full day ago. That was Obadiah Stane.
He went up the stairs, considering.  He turned the questions over in his mind for a bit before he asked. “Jarvis, does Mr. Stark not drink anymore?”
“That’s enough, it’s enough, you’re good, I’m good,” he babbled, never having moved from where Steve set him. “Please, darling, please, stop teasing—“ he broke off breathless when Steve moved to lick his way around the rim, pushing his tongue in beside his fingers. “You kinky bastard, Jesus, they’ll never believe, next time, please, just, please, don’t make me beg,” Tony implored, apparently ignoring the detail that he was actually begging.
I’m really sorry to hear about your dad.  I know some people take longer to realize that it doesn’t matter who you love than other people do.  Do you think something would change his mind? Are you safe where you are?
He ate half of it, putting the rest in the fridge.  Nothing on Netflix seemed to grab his attention.  And he still wasn’t ready to face the world, but he at least washed his spoon, even drying it and putting it back in the drawer, and brushed his teeth. They were disgusting, fuzzy. That was it though. That was all he had in him.  He drank a glass of water, and then got back into bed.  Refreshed email, as if it wouldn’t do that on its own.  Nothing.  He stared at the screen until he fell asleep again.
Dinner was a team affair, loud and boisterous, just the same as always.  Except that sometimes, he’d look over at Tony, and Tony would be looking back, the same private smile on his face.  Dinner turned into movie night, everyone clustered onto the couch and in the giant chairs.  Tony and Steve ended up on one of the couches, in their normal seats.  Steve relaxed into Tony’s side, holding his popcorn bowl where Tony could easily reach it.  Maybe he held Tony’s hand during the space scenes.  Maybe Tony squeezed his hand, grateful.
“It’s just cranberry sauce,” Steve said, blushing a little.  “It’s an old German recipe, so it’s kind of different.  It has dried cherries in it, and it’s basically good on everything.”
Bruce drew next, then Tony.  He unfolded his little card to see Steve’s name written on it.  Underneath his name he’d jotted: “To whomever draws my card: I don’t want a giant bunny either.” The little shit. Tony couldn’t help smiling a little. Mission accepted.  He’d make Steve something amazing. Something he’d never see coming.
Steve glances at his wrists. “I said I would do anything.” His voice is raw, but he looks at Tony directly. “I mean it, Tony.  I’ll do anything you want.”
“Sir has several close friends: Ms. Potts, Mr. Rhodes, Mr. Hogan.  But, if you allow me to say so, I would postulate that Sir does not make close friends easily, and less so since he was younger.  Especially since the media tend to vilify him, and forget the good he does. I would say, Captain, that he has made significant efforts to create a better world, especially in the past few years.”
He showed her the text, and she gave a quick nod.  He walked toward the podium with a bottle of water for Tony, ready to usher him away, when Christine Everhart jumped in with one more question. “Mr. Stark! I have a source that says you were partying with Junior Manfredi last night at his high stakes club in LA. Any comment?”
“Wait—are those the stretchy polymers you were talking about the other day?” Steve asked.  He’d picked up a lot hanging around Tony, and using Jarvis and Google like a fiend.
“Okay, man,” Rhodes said placatingly, hands up in mock-surrender. “So, he’s smart and pretty, huh? He’s also, according to Happy, friends with a criminal.”
One of the bots wheeled over to him and crashed a plate of cut fruit and mini waffles into Tony’s left thigh.  He picked it up absently and set it on the table.  “Good boy, Butterfingers,” he said, patting him and biting into a nutella and strawberry waffle. Wait a second. “Jarvis, where did this come from?” he asked, his mouth full.
He wants to punch Steve in his stupid inconsiderate face.  Instead he takes off, the suit guiding him to the tower.  Steve stays where he is, on the ground, watches him go.
Steve clapped him on the shoulder from the back seat.  “Morita, that’s amazing! I know your mom would have been so proud of you.”
Tony wasn’t looking at him as he said, “Don’t blow her off.  She’s likely to strangle me in my sleep if you do.”
Tony ached for him—this should not also fall on him, too.  He carried enough burdens.  “Do you want me to go with you?”
Tony gave a sardonic chuckle. “Rogers. You’ve more than paid off any debt.  If anything, I owe you at this point.  You don’t need to come back.” It would be better, really, if he didn’t.  Better for Steve, certainly.  Probably better for everyone, really. Tony could keep an eye on Stern remotely, make sure he didn’t go after Steve, and get Jarvis to help Rhodey to continue after the arc reactor died. After he died. “The phone’s yours.  Consider it severance.”
“Okay. Yep. Do not recommend. Breaking up with Steve Rogers: bad idea.” He kissed Steve, relief flooding him, the same feeling as he had waking up in New York, a second life granted. Then his brain caught up to him. “But if you found a time machine and you broke it, so help me, we’re getting a divorce!”
It’s all he wanted, after all, lying here, with Tony, completely honest, completely known, completely loved, in the light of his own personal sun.
The photo further down the hallway—beyond the bathroom—was older.  Steve was maybe ten—well before puberty. And his arm was slung around another kid that Tony didn’t recognize.  Brown hair. Scrappy.  Bigger than Steve, for sure.  Was this the mystery best friend?  3/5 was pretty good.  60%.  That was almost passing.
Steve takes a step back.  A step away.  He sits down against a block of rubble on the ground, folds his legs in, exposing his stomach, leaving it unprotected.  Making it more difficult for him to get into an aggressive stance.  Tony knows what he’s doing; animals do the same thing.
“Well, Jarvis, I think I’ve gotten settled, and it’s about noon.  Should I make Mr. Stark lunch or something? Did he tell you what to tell me?”
He thought about Flying.  How he wished he were brave enough to tell his mother.  How he made Tony want to be brave, too. He took a deep breath, gagged, steadied himself. She didn’t say anything.  Tony tried again, tried to make the words come up, words he’d never actually said out loud before. They wanted to stay, threatened to close his throat, tried to make a molten lump in his stomach, stay hidden. He choked, once, swallowed, and then: “I’m gay.”
It was extremely weird hearing Loki’s voice coming out of his own mouth, Tony reflected, distracted momentarily.  Then he saw Steve, who was glowing like a tomato again, bashful. If the poor guy got any redder, he’d be having nightmares of himself.
Tony dragged himself out of the workshop that night. He hadn’t gotten anything done. His hair was wild but he didn’t care, he was heartsick.  Was he doing the right thing? Yes, of course, he was.  But the reactor was twice as heavy now, pressing down on him, weighing on him. Steve was brilliant and kind, generous and devoted, the stubborn ass. Steve had been the best of him, brought out the best in him.  He couldn’t breathe, now, thinking of how it would be, his bedroom cold and dark, without Steve and his goddamn paper books.  He couldn’t bring himself to open the door.
Tony transferred the scotch to his right hand, resting it on the table. Steve moved to the edges of his vision so Tony knew it was him. Turning his back to obscure his movements, he deftly switched out his own apple juice for the scotch.  Tony betrayed only a flicker of an eyebrow toward Steve to indicate his confusion, but Steve just turned back to the group, smiling placidly. Maya moved closer to Tony, slipping an arm around him and sliding her hand over his lapels.  Tony’s smile set and Steve could see tensions in the corners of his eyes. He sighed internally, ruefully realizing he’d been paying enough attention to Tony to see minute changes in the set of his mouth and eyes.
Tony took a left on Peach Street, heading toward Sam’s.  “How is Sam’s house the new hangout?” he wondered out loud.
Tony stopped, moved his lips from Steve’s nipple to kiss his mouth, feather-soft.  “Just from my dreams, then,” he said, lightly. He walked Steve back to the bed, pushing him down, and Steve went, easily. Once he was laid out, Tony stopped, above him, drawing back to fully view how Steve’s body looked, drenched in moonlight.  “You’re so beautiful, sometimes it just.” He ran a finger down Steve’s body, a hot line that made Steve shiver.  He put his own fingers into his mouth, wetting them obscenely, licking down his fingers, never breaking eye contact.  Steve couldn’t look away.  Then Tony shifted on the bed, spreading Steve’s legs, taking him deep into his mouth at the same time that he pushed the tip of his finger at the tight center of his hole.  Steve was trapped, trying to get deeper, ending up rocking, slightly, gasping and chanting Tony’s name. Tony was working his cock lewdly, wet and messy, making a show of it, seeing how it turned Steve on, dragging the sharp stubble of his beard across Steve’s thighs.  Steve pulsed in his mouth, wet, and Tony pulled off, licking his shaft instead, slurping, humming happily to himself. “Excellent,” he exclaimed, only half to Steve, it seemed, “I was wondering how we’d get you wet enough.” Then he paused for a second, catching himself, petting Steve’s thigh distractedly. He dropped little chaste kisses up Steve’s body, kissing his ear, his neck. He kissed his mouth, barely brushing his lips over Steve’s. “Steve,” he said calmly, deliberately. “Sugar. Baby.  We don’t have to do anything more, we don’t have to do anything at all. Whatever you—“
The house was dark and empty, but not the comforting warmth of a haven.  It was a cave.  Devoid of comfort. Tony felt like a pinball, completely aimless.
“Yes, ma’am,” Happy muttered sullenly. Steve wasn’t sure he was going to let the issue drop, but there wasn’t a lot he could do about it.
“Anyway, Mr. Stark,” Jemma continued, as if their momentary bickering was commonplace.  From what Tony had seen at the gala, it was. “We haven’t found a suitable replacement.  We tried looking at some other elements and compounds, but we haven’t narrowed it down yet. But it’s
He looked up to find Tony looking at him, clearly able to hear. “Go,” Tony said. “I’ll send the rest of your stuff when I get it packed up.”
“I think that’s amazing, Mr. Stark,” Steve said, earnestly.  “When I was overseas, we’d be in villages where there were no functioning wells.  Sometimes there would only be one well for a whole village, and the women would have to line up for hours. The irony, you know? Because it looked just like our textbook photos of the oil crisis in the 1980s.”
Tony’s stomach did an uncomfortable flip.  Was he ready to be known? Maybe not.  Sure, this guy had a point.  Okay.  He hadn’t meant to pry.  But on the other hand, Flying didn’t seem to mind, just wasn’t ready to share. No problem.  Tony was totally patient. Super patient.  Winning awards for his patience left and right.
Steve followed Jarvis’s voice and the lights as he wandered through the house.  He stopped to leave his jacket and helmet in the room that Jarvis told him would be his, while he was here.   He asked Jarvis where to find a broom and dustpan, and cleaned up the fractured masterpiece.  Shards of crimson scattered like bloody remnants across the foyer, the evidence of Bucky’s crime.  Fragments of blue and green mixed with gold and clear glass. After he’d swept up the pieces, mourning the whole time, he found a mop and a bucket, thoroughly washing the floor so that no splinters of glass remained.  He was on his hands and knees, rag in hand, drying the patches of clean floor so there was no danger of anyone slipping, when the surreal nature of his morning began to hit him.  A cold motorcycle ride through New York, signing up to work for Mr. Stark, asking a bodiless voice for help.  Now that he thought about it, that voice sounded a bit cold, but perhaps that’s just the British accent.  Still, Monty had been British, in his old special forces platoon, and certainly didn’t sound that distant.  Maybe they were from different parts of England.  He caught himself and blushed.
Tony turned to Steve, helpless and flustered.  For a second, he could have sworn that Steve looked… Something. But then it was gone, and he was grinning at Tony. “Oh I see how it is.  Don’t worry about it—I’ll get the clones all set up.”
Mr. Morita patted him on the shoulder.  “I bet you make your dad so proud.  We’re always so invested in our sons.” He shook his head, a little misty-eyed.  “I’m going to miss this one when he leaves me next year.” He canted his head toward Jimmy.  “It’s been just the two of us for so long.  I’ll be an empty nester.  Gotta take up golf and start raising chickens.”
Ugh.  No. No.  Tony’s pulse raced, his stomach didn’t want to stay in place.  But what could Hammer possibly do to Natasha? Nothing. The girl was more than capable of handling herself and then some. So, what, he had them all hang out together for a couple awkward sessions? Okay. Not so bad, right? He could do that.  He could.  And she wouldn’t ever let him touch her anyway. So he could buy off Hammer, stay in his good graces. Because if Howard found out… Shit.  Tony didn’t even want to think about what would happen.  He’d be disowned, first.  Out of the company. Pulled from school.  Maybe sent to one of those praythegayaway camps. Or maybe Howard would just try to beat it out of him.  Not like it hadn’t happened before, the sleeping with the teddy bear, that one brief moment in kindergarten when he wanted to be a writer.
Tony always did that, when he made his own coffee.  He never seemed to test it when Steve made it for him.  Of course, Steve had always made sure the grains had dissolved.  He pushed the thought aside.
Wow.  I slipped up. I had to go back and re-read and find where I told you what grade I’m in.  I’m an idiot.  Yeah. Senior year.  I don’t know.  Maybe a superhero or something.  Like, Batman. I didn’t want to be him or anything, when I was growing up—actually, I could never be like him—but he was always my favorite. I used to come home and watch the cartoon with my best friend after school, and eat chocolate chip cookies.  My mom taught me how to make the most amazing chocolate chip cookies.  I haven’t made them in ages. But it’s probably too late to get a Batman costume at this point anyway. Besides, if I tell you, then you’ll know who I am.  I’m not sure I’m ready for that.
Steve swung his leg over the motorcycle, turning back to look at Tony, that same look just below the surface.  Tony got on behind him, wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist. A slight shudder went through Steve, and he put his hands over Tony’s. Interesting.
She just breezed past him. “I got it.”  She came back, carrying three cans of tangerine soda, handing them off to Bruce and Tony.  Sam followed with a plate of cookies, and Steve was just behind him with a stack of napkins.
“Ugh.” That was a boner killer. “Those snooty bastards have been jerking us around for weeks.  What is it now?”
Jarvis had said he’d run some simulations, but Tony knew it would work. It would. Everything was in its place.  He’d have to pull power from all three backup generators, but they were fully fueled and he’d already rechecked the power grid.  Power was not going to be a problem. He had Steve’s book lying open on a workbench.  Inspiration.  Sure, he could just have Jarvis project the image for him, but having the tangible book, Steve’s initials painstakingly sharpied on the cover… In a pathetic little way, it was like a piece of Steve was still there with him.  He knew it was stupid.  He pulled the leather gloves back on and checked the coils one last time.
“And we know you’re just going to fall into your old ways! You’ll get one taste of alcohol or a new and shiny toy, and we know you’re going to be just like before. I was only trying to do right by your father, Tony, to make him proud!” There was a very loud
Steve holds out his wrists, still resting his head on his knees where he’s sitting on the landing platform.  Tony fastens the cuffs around him. He’s gentle.  He can’t help himself. He helps Steve up, hearing the strain it takes him to breathe.  They get to the workshop and Steve slumps back on a bench.  His eyes hold an apology, but he doesn’t have the breath to say it.
Stepping into the shower, Tony imagined Steve’s hands running over his torso, his face, maybe slightly shy, blushing when he let Tony lean in, kiss him, and take him in hand. In his mind, Steve’s soft lips parted easily, allowing Tony to explore his mouth, moaning when Tony’s tongue swept in, licking and sucking. Tony gasped as he slid into his fist, fully hard and slightly breathless under the warm water. The thought of Steve, waiting in anticipation was enough to put him on the edge. He pictured Steve’s perfect pink mouth, stretched around his cock, tight and hot, tongue working the ridge on the underside, blue eyes holding his, approving him, and lost control embarrassingly quickly, shivering as he came, striping the marble in white. He basked in the afterglow for a brief moment, then cleaned himself up, rinsing the evidence of his gauche behavior down the drain.  In the aftermath, he was bereft, cold despite the hot water, now more aware of how much he wanted Steve, thrown into relief by his vivid imagination.
“Hey, Shell, I’m not sure.  I don’t think they would mind, but maybe I’m just being overly optimistic? They aren’t stopping me from coming out.  I don’t think they would be disappointed in me.  It’s not them.  They’re great. But it’s kind of complicated.  In a way, I feel like I owe them—like I have to be good for them.  Because they’ve done so much for me, much more than they needed to do.  Does that make sense?
Steve thought the universe was playing an extraordinarily cruel joke on him when Tony got on the elevator at the workshop, reading a text on his phone. He felt like all the air had been sucked out of the car, and Tony hadn’t even glanced up at him yet.  This yearning, this need to just be seen, to be able to touch him again, it was agony, and Tony had no idea the way Steve had to dissemble, daily.  “Everything okay, Steve?” he asked. “The kids want me to ask you why you’re taking off.” Ah.  That explained the text.
Tony looked at her wide-eyed.  Fuck it.  He pulled over, making some asshole behind him honk at him. The van pulled to a stop in the shoulder.
Steve’s eyes widened, clearly remembering the incident.  “Oh, really? I didn’t know, that’s—but you’re such a great runner! We’re lucky to have you!”
Tony banged his head on the steering wheel, miserably. “I’m sorry, Natasha.  I’m so sorry. I was never going to let it get too far, always make sure it was a group setting… I just. I can’t.  If my father, if he… I’d never let Hammer do anything to you, though, I just thought I could play it so he’d feel like he was getting somewhere until he got bored.” He couldn’t look at her.  What kind of a man trades on someone else’s body?
That would actually be adorable, Tony thought.  He kept his mouth shut, though. Instead, he kept Steve for another half hour, ordering kitten supplies.  It wasn’t exactly that he wanted to keep LF around, but Steve seemed to like him, and well, he liked making Steve happy.  They settled on a half dozen toys, and Tony had them shipped to the tower.  He let Steve think that he’d put it on Steve’s card.  He probably wouldn’t get away with it for long, but there was a chance. Reluctantly, Tony got back to the desal project he’d promised Pepper.  Steve stayed, reading a book on the couch.  It made Tony unaccountably fuzzy to be able to look over and see him curled up, content.  Eventually, sometime around the point where Tony switched over to ultraglass production, Steve got up and made a pot of coffee.  He put a mug down for Tony in his workspace, in reach but out of the way.
“Thank you, Jarvis,” Steve said, making his way toward the office near his room.  He paused.  “You don’t need to call me Captain. I’m not.” He swallowed. “I’m not in the army anymore.”
“I’m a scientist, Steve, it’s what I do,” Tony said, stretching one hand out toward the folder while pouring sand over a filter with the other.
Ugh. Another petty criminal looking for some sort of super replacement.  Prosthetics, by the look of things.
Steve looked up quickly, chastised. If Tony hadn’t been watching closely, he would have missed the lie. “I forgot Natasha’s birthday. Not a big deal. We’ve been putting together a book from her old unit.  Bucky gave it to her without me.” He made a face.  Not a lie.  Not exactly. Tony would have put money on at least half of that all being true. He could just have Jarvis pull up the texts later.  If he needed. Not that he would. Probably. But if Steve was in trouble…
Steve barely noticed. He sent a quick text to Bucky, telling him that things were okay. That old phone of his had finally given up the ghost and he didn’t want Bucky to worry. He was surprised when he got back a message almost immediately.
“Sure, Mr. Coulson,” Tony said, desperately trying to think of an excuse to get his phone back sooner. He was pretty sure he had set gmail to just show an alert when he got a new message, but he wasn’t sure.
“—really wasn’t going to go out for cross country before that, so full confessions here, Steve’s the reason I’m off running so much,” Pieter was telling his sister.
as “Mr. Stark.” He wiped his hands and meticulously folded the striped towel, hanging it on the oven handle before sitting back down in front of Bucky’s laptop.
You made me a better person today. Wait, I know what you’re thinking, we’ve never even met.  But you were talking about how you wanted to be brave, to tell your mother, if she were around.  Well.  I was thinking about it today and—long story, lots of drama, nothing to concern your pretty little head about—I told someone.  I told a friend.  God, I feel like, I feel amazing. I feel like I’m invincible. I can do anything. Sure, anything except come out or tell my parents or understand what the hell Mrs. Lewis is talking about in terms of the ‘unexpected theme analysis’ of Shakespeare, but anything.  I’m a modern marvel. So.  Again. To recap: you inspired me.
Jimmy seemed like he couldn’t help it.  “I just got early acceptance.  To Columbia.  With a scholarship and work study.  It’s close enough I can commute, and my dad isn’t going to have to pay anything.  I’m just… I’m so damn happy.”
Steve hesitated, then hooked a stool over from behind him, and grabbed a slice.  “So, how long has this clean water thing been going?” he ventured. His lips were shiny, and Tony had the urge to lick it off.  He’d never found grease quite so sexy before.
“Shell, I don’t know much about football. Is going to games important to you? I’ve been to a few of our games, but mostly just to hang out with friends.  I guess it’s good for that aspect?
“I was wondering when you were going to notice me,” he said, sulkily.  He wasn’t actually upset, though.  Steve hadn’t let go of his hand.  His blue eyes kept drifting toward the reactor, seeming to be comforted by the constancy.
Tony read it quickly.  Sure, Ophelia.  Gertrude has to get remarried real quick while she’s still able to produce an heir… Horatio… Holy fuck.
But Steve was also the best of them.  He trained with Nat, wanting to learn from her, since her style was so unlike his own. He cooked with Thor, both learning about the delights of modern American cuisine. He played at target practice with Clint.  Stretched while Bruce did yoga.  And through it all, listened to them unburden themselves.  They all had guilt. They all had red, as Nat put it. He listened to her crimes, when she gave them to him, sparsely, haltingly, moments not even listed in her SHIELD file. He listened, without judgement, as Thor talked through his complicated relationship with his brother.  He talked Clint through his guilt, how to put aside what he had done under Loki’s spell while finding ways to atone, to assuage his remorse. Let Bruce tentatively tell him about Betty.
Steve winced.  He thought he’d thought it through. He thought he’d considered the outcomes, that Tony would forget everything, that he would have to hide his feelings again. How had he not seen this outcome, the one where he lost Tony anyway? Where Steve broke the friendship? He should have just said it.  If Tony was going to figure it out—and he should have known, Tony was the smartest person he knew—why hadn’t he just said how he felt, been honest, they’d end up in the same place anyway, with Tony leaving and Steve on his own, completely alone.  He’d thought there’d been nothing left to lose.  How short sighted he’d been. He prepared himself now, straightening his shoulders.
Tony let half his brain do the studying, and the other half tried to think of an innocuous question that he could ask Jimmy—a litmus test, so to speak.  It had to be vague enough not to be too weird, but specific enough that not everyone would answer the same.  Obviously Batman was out; he’d tried that already. And he couldn’t really ask about Bucky.  That was way too specific, and if Jimmy
Tony reached up and kissed him quickly.  A perfect second kiss.  “I’m ecstatic that it’s you.” Steve’s lips were soft, the way they always looked, and he kissed like he did everything, sweet and purposeful.
He took his notes and the portfolio down to the workshop.  Tony had blueprints up on all the walls.  At a glance, he could see they were for some sort of camp layout.  Water distribution systems, restroom and shower facilities, giant kitchen stations.  A library of sorts.  A fence surrounded it, though.  To keep people in? Or to keep people out?
liked Tony.  But the guy signed his name “love” and that had to mean something, right?  He hit send and tapped his fingers impatiently on the desk.  It wasn’t like he was going to get an immediate response. He felt antsy.
Project Rebirth.  That was Rogers.  Fuck.  Tony didn’t even know the details, just that they’d managed to regenerate musculature via the moronically named “vita rays”, it was the basis for a few of SI’s original vaccines, and that Howard had shut it down after one trial. One trial.
Tony opened his eyes, pulling open his shirt to reveal the light within.  He would not miss the expression on Obadiah’s face when he got outmaneuvered.  There it was.  He knew he was screwed.
“Tony, I know you have a lot of pressure on you.  But you need to take a break, see things the way they are.” He tapped the vintage bobblehead sitting on his desk. “Expectations on you are high. They are. Higher than they should be. You might feel like you’re under a microscope here, since I know Howard has high hopes for you.” He smiled kindly at Tony.
He was dialing before he even realized it. It rang endlessly. He bypassed voicemail (thank you, Pepper, you’re a genius) and let it ring, nerves beginning to eat at him.  There was no reason to think anything was amiss, but Tony always picked up the phone when he called.  Always.  He’d never even had to use the voicemail trick before.  Even when he was in that meeting with Legal, when Steve knew he wouldn’t use Jarvis.  He didn’t talk to Jarvis when other people were around. Fuck, Tony, pick up the phone!
The kitten seemed relatively particular, hissing at Thor, but cuddling up to Bruce and Natasha just fine.  He largely ignored Clint. Thor thought maybe kittens didn’t like beings from another realm.  Natasha suggested perhaps Thor needed a shower.  Bruce just put down a plate of shredded chicken, agreeing that they needed to find a name.  A real name.  Clint largely ignored him, claiming he was a dog person.
And I know what you mean, about feeling alone.  I do.  So, I just want you to know, if you need me, I’m here for you.
Besides, it’s my last year in school, and I don’t want them to have to deal with more. It just seems easier to stay quiet about it.  I think I’d hurt more people by coming out than I do by staying quiet.  I mean, what if my friends did decide to stick by me? I don’t want them to lose out on the rest of high school. I don’t want people to pick on them. I don’t want them to get bullied because of me, because I came out. That would be on me.  I can’t do that to them. Maybe you think I’m just being a coward.  Maybe I am.
“It’s an Alfa Romeo, Tony, it probably leaked on him,” Steve said, mildly. “Everybody knows the Italians leak a lot.” He heard how it sounded just after he said it and looked down, feeling his face flame. He bent close to the kitten, working to dry off his tiny paws.  Tony didn’t say anything, and Steve couldn’t bring himself to glance up to see what his face looked like.
“Oh, I’m very excited to play,” Peggy said, eyes twinkling.  She had a take-charge, roll with the punches sort of attitude.  God help the world if Pepper and Peggy ever decided to team up against it.  Tony was pretty sure they could reorder the entire planet if they put their mind to it, while painting their nails and sipping on lattes—er, tea.
Coulson had dropped a plate on his way into Steve’s office in that first week and Steve had upended his desk and dragged Coulson behind it before he realized the crash was just broken ceramic.  He was dangerous.  He understood.
“Steve,” Tony said, maybe a little gently. He felt for the guy, after all.  “Go get cleaned up.  If you’re awake after that, come down to my office.  If not, there’s no emergency. Get some rest.” Whatever this guy’s deal was, Tony wasn’t going to make it any worse.
Tony said it looked fine, glancing over him when he’d gone down to the workshop to remind him to get ready. Tony had wiped his hands on a rag, gulped down the dregs of his coffee.  His arms were more heavily muscled than Steve would have thought for a billionaire engineer, his shoulders and back covered in a sheen of sweat. Steve’s thoughts strayed, looking at Tony’s work-roughened hands, the curve of his neck, the sinewy muscle and cocky smile. The man had disappeared up to his bedroom before Steve realized he’d gone, leaving a trace of his cologne and fired metal behind.
“Can it. I’m here anyway. What are you doing at Stark’s mansion? You wanted to be another one of his casualties? Didn’t get enough of the Merchant of Death’s destruction already?”
Finally he just typed in Cap.  It would work.  Miraculously, it wasn’t already taken.  He wasn’t sure what he should say.  The moderator, Wilson, opened up the chat.  Asked if anyone wanted to share.
“God, you’re enormous, I love it, come on Steve, give it to me, please, don’t tease, sharing is caring,” Tony groaned out, hands scrabbling for Steve’s and pulling him forward.  “Oh god, yes, holy—you—is that still, Jesus—“ He stopped talking, just gasped as he finally felt Steve’s thighs against his ass.  Steve could feel Tony’s body quivering around him, trying to relax, trying to allow him to move, but he thought just the little tremors might be enough to set him off.  He tried hard to think of other things, stave off an orgasm until Tony had his, but he didn’t want to think of anything except this, forever, burn it into his mind.
Tony felt warmth wash over him.  She did.  “How’d you get into my place? How’d you even know where I live?”
“Nat, what the hell are you doing with a gun?” Steve asked, clearly relaxing. Barnes’s girlfriend moved into the living room, red hair aflame in the afternoon sun.  Barnes followed close on her heels, a rifle slung over his back.
Steve wrapped the kitten securely in the towel, placing the whole bundle on a chair, where it purred loudly. Steeling himself, he looked up.  Tony’s left sleeve was shredded and stained most of the way up his arm. Immediately, Steve got to his feet.  “You’re hurt,” he said.
Tony read the email, almost wistful.  Was there something like that for him?  It had been a difficult week. He’d gone with Nat every day to see the lawyer, Murdock, who seemed intense.  But he needed intense. He needed the help.  And it wouldn’t be too long, now, until he would be out of danger.
Miss Potts took another look at him and slowed down a bit.  She tripped over to him in her shockingly tall stilettos.  She was almost as tall as he was in them.
He had access to everything. Literally. Tony’d given him access to every file in SI, no limits. He’d traced some of the money to offshore accounts, putting his rusty Farsi and French to good use. Apparently his time in the army gave him some marketable skills after all. The more he used his language skills to parse through the documents he’d found, the more they returned to him.
“Look,” she redirected. “We can do it. We can manage Hammer. I’m not going to really flirt with him. That’s unfair, even to scum.  I’ll just be friendly. Normal friendly.  But I think it will be enough. And in the meantime, I’ll help you move your assets out of Howard’s control into your own name.  I’m pretty good with banking and property law.” She said it as if she were talking about the weather, normal conversational topics for a teen.
Steve couldn’t look at him, sat down on the edge of the bed.  “I’m a little old for that, I think,” he said, a self-deprecating note in his voice. “Or young.  Either way, I’ve never been particularly flighty.” He sighed.  “Sorry,” he said again.  “I’m um, more of a one-guy kinda guy.” He took a deep breath.  “I promise it won’t change anything, I won’t try anything,” he got out before he was knocked backward onto the bed and straddled.
Pepper fixed him with a very direct look.  “I don’t care about the painting, Steve.  I’m glad you’re mostly alright.”
A blue laser shot from the prismatic core, slicing cleanly through several sets of industrial shelving and sending tools and sheets of metal clanging toward the floor. Well, collateral damage.  Worth it, this time. He turned the laser toward the stabilizer, praying to a god he didn’t believe in and science he did that it would work and held his breath.  Bad idea.  Muscles need oxygen.  And there, it took! Yes! He was a genius! He’d always known it was going to work! He hit the shut off switch with a gloved hand.
, it's sort of a lawyer show, but more like a soap opera.  But her boyfriend on the show… Larry Paul.  He was so smart, and really good looking.  I know it’s kind of lame, and most of my friends seem to crush on people closer to their own age, but there was just something about him. He used to make her breakfast in bed, and I just thought that was… So sweet and domestic, you know? In a good way.
