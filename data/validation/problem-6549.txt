Tony kept staring at Steve, who kept staring at the goat as it explored. Yup, he was sensing things all right and he already knew he was going to be in so much trouble.
“Oh, no. Well, I can’t really,” Tony felt his eyes sting. He didn’t know why he felt like crying after Howard now, when he hadn’t even cried at the funeral. He didn’t really miss Howard, but maybe the idea of a man that Steve remembered made him wistful. A version of his own father that he had never met, “He died three years ago. Along with mom. With Maria,” he sniffed, “yeah.
“I can’t- Tony, I’m not-” Steve took a harsh breath, his eyes hardened, suddenly focused, an almost animalistic expression appeared on his face, “I can’t control it, when I see things, when I hear people saying things like that- They would have done it too,” the hand that covered his face went up to his hair, pulling, “they can’t- They don’t deserve to live, they can’t- When everyone else is dying, they can’t-”
Steve clinged to him. He buried his face into Tony’s stomach, hands bunching in his clothes. If he had been holding onto him, Tony thought, he would have bruised him already.
He also learns that Iron Man doesn’t really have that much free time and has many other responsibilities and that’s why many things are automated even though he exists. Though he gives away that whatever is controlling Iron Man when his human is not around is much better than any other regular AI.
He was standing on the edge of his sanity, ready to fall. He couldn’t sleep. He couldn’t go out. What felt like an escape, now meant his mind staying back home while his body moved, his rationality thinning out the further away he got.
“If you bite me, and I mean it, even if you just, peck me a little, I’m taking you right to the butcher’s shop.”
Tony took his other hand and placed a kiss on top of it’s scarred knuckles as he reached for the phone, “It’s all right baby. Steve?” He kissed Steve’s hand one more time, “Let me hear what he’s got to say, okay? I’ll make something up.”
Steve’s lip connects with Tony’s neck, “Just means there’s only one winner. And the prize? I know you’ll like the prize.”
Tony laughs and slides off his jacket as the elevator doors ping open to his penthouse, he steps out and into the living area to deposit his jacket and shoes. “Bring up the best recipes for the best Chicken Caesar Salad. Do you think Steve would like salad? He has to eat it, I made it.” He continues rambling away to himself, as he collects all the ingredients JARVIS kindly collected for him.
Dinner, much to Tony’s relief, consists of a five-star meal prepared by Tony’s personal chef. Tony had never spoken negatively about his cooking. As a Stark, he knows he can get the best and he does, especially when he's sharing with Steve.
He let the mattress flop back down onto the floor, sat down and took out his phone. Someone probably had found Ty already. He had probably been in bad shape. And Obie knew… He knew Ty and him. Not the whole story but, oh well. He also knew Tony wouldn’t be able to put Ty in that shape so he probably had already figured out there had been a third party involved.
He was so close now, he could almost pinpoint the place the tinkering was coming from. A little below his waistline, as if someone’s hands were feeling along the planes of wood that made the house.
“I refuse ‘almost’, I’m Tony Stark. I don’t do ‘almost’. Oh, and 3 out of 5 stars is not good enough either!” he huffs and crosses his arms, furrowing his brows, in the way Steve calls adorable and can’t help teasing him about.
Just when he’s about to open his mouth, he gets a direct message on Discord. It’s from the one and only Iron Man. “Please don’t freak out,” it reads.
The shit that he had discovered, that alone was enough to make him stay awake, go that extra mile when his body wanted to shut down.
Until a series of events had triggered those buried feelings, how unfair it was that his mother had died young when other people just… Kept on living. Undeservedly.
Steve bent down, pressed his lips into his hair, “I cannot lose you. I cannot lose you right now, alright. I know it’s selfish but God, Tony, I cannot.”
“I saw rats on the Christmas tree. One of them already knocked down the topper, I- Uh- Didn’t know what to do,” he looked at Tony’s tired face sheepishly.
Some of his fantasy landscape studies are suitable. He sets them aside. There are some sketches he did as examples at school recently, when he had given his students the character and map creation prompts; those, he can flesh out. He sets them aside as well.
Steve bared his face enough to look at him, his hands revealing a blotchy blush spreading over his face, “You were so beautiful,” his pink patches got suddenly darker.
He could take Stone. For Steve. Then only thing that was left would be that detective Stone talked about but that was for later.
Tony almost expected someone to come up and say that no, Tiberius wasn’t actually dead, there had been a mistake.
They had went to three different pig farms over two weeks. Coolers in the back of a truck, shoes two sizes bigger on their feet. It was almost like the pigs had known they were coming, lining up by the pen in anticipation, their cute pink snouts sniffing the air.
“I left an entire pot of Vicks boiling on that electric stove we never got to unpack, no one will ever smell anything but Vicks for the next decade in that apartment. Come on, we have cleaning to do.”
“Yeah, a microphone it seems like,” Tony cringes as soon as the words leave his mouth. Yes Tony, amazing, insert your foot a little bit deeper into your mouth.
“Hey,” he leaned into Steve over the small table, his stomach swooped when their eyes met but he didn’t avert his gaze, “That’s  probably the first time anyone said that to me and actually meant it, you know. Or maybe, no wait, it might actually be the first time ever that someone called me beautiful,” he laughed maybe a little bitterly.
Hell, Tony was not the mediator. He was the catalyst, if anything. Always the one that stirred up shit, made a mess, a hurricane, a tornado. But for Steve, he was apparently whatever he needed, kneeling between his legs on damp ground and whispering things he couldn’t remember over the dull throb of his joint.
“It’s alright,” Tony voice was so small, it would have gotten lost anywhere. Anywhere else but here, in the foggy silence of Central Park in the morning. Tony’s brain went on a tangent, working overtime. It was Maria’s line, wasn’t it. Why had it come out like that? Tony used to hate it. Maria used to be the de-escalator in every fight, always calm and collected. Tony used to hate that, how he could look at Howard’s drunk, red face and say- Why did it come out like that? Out of his mouth? “It’s alright,” he said again, firmer, a long ingrained instinct of generational conditioning.
A quiet little brunch is where things come to head. And it’s all Dum-E’s fault. And in relation, Steve’s own fault because Tony had told him Dum-E was bound fuck something up. Steve, for some reason, cannot understand the bots are just bots and just feels an immense fondness for them.
For the resilient little thing in his arms who lived through hell and came out fighting, he would find a way.
Steve laughs and kisses him, “Just to clarify, this is not the real proposal, I have all that planned out.”
They had walked back from the park slowly, as the sun got higher in the sky and got lost in the lunch break crowd; people in suits, in various work attire creating a bubble around them: two young men with nothing to do but pay attention to each other.
He found the bakery he preferred and the office supplies shop where he bought his sketchbooks and his 2B pencils and his route through Central Park on the five  out of seven mornings that he ran and the place he sat down to draw on the other two.
Steve smiled wistfully, playing with a hole in the plastic cover he was sitting on, “Loud, flirty, reckless. He was,” he sighed, “annoying. But he was a good man.”
His panic had put Tony in a mindset that he would panic about later and would call it “I was scared of becoming my dad but oh no, I am turning into my mother”.
So Tony laid down in his way too big bed, hiding under his soft duvet from the dimmed lights that he couldn’t escape from and thought about how it would have been if he stayed awake for a minute longer that night, to feel two hefty fingers dive into his mouth, over his tongue, inside his cheeks. How it would have felt to taste Ty’s blood and to know at that moment that he was dead. That the torment was now over, forever.
“I had built this house for my Omega initially. It was supposed to be a bonding gift, you know,” he had sighed, ”well…”
Iron Man squeaks and sputters, “I mean- I could be? Sometimes maybe I am? Maybe I am right now? How is- I mean- Humans right? Am I even human? I survive on coffee and goji berries. Exclusively. Can a human do that?”
He sits there, looking at his computer screen, trying to understand what just happened. Then he gives up. Closes the game. Turns off his computer and slowly makes his way back to his bed.
Steve expects to find himself in the lobby again or a clean slate on the map editor but no. Where he is, is the arena he just created. And Iron Man is right there. He fumbles for his headset immediately, plugging in the USB at the fifth try.
The music bloomed in a crescendo for a second. A door forcefully shut. Ty was suddenly gone, a sudden burst of cold air filling the place he vacated. Tony wanted to curl up against it, with Ty’s body suddenly gone, but his body refused to budge.
“I do. But the nonsense I’m being sent is ridiculous. Once, his gadget blew up in the conference room, ruining my Armani suit. Somehow Pepper’s louboutin’s came out unscathed.”
The Alpha who sold him the house, Tiberius Stone, had been very proud of how he had modeled the house, sending Steve, who couldn’t yet leave New York, as many photos of the house as he liked. From room layouts and outside of the property, to under the sinks and the inside of the water heater cabinet, Steve had seen it all before purchasing the house remotely.
At this point, Iron Man is already a legend. Videos and tutorials and walkthrough ideas on how to beat him, conspiracy theories, praises to Tony Stark’s AI building capabilities are all over the internet. Everything that can be said about the boss fight has already been said, every tip has been given. And still, no one has been able to beat him.
Placing his newspaper down, Steve laughs and examines the pile of somewhat decent looking pancakes in front of him. “They look good, Tony. Now for the taste test.” He takes his fork and gently cuts a small piece and puts it in his mouth. Chewing, he nods his head for a moment and takes a sip of orange juice, “They’re good, 3 out of 5 stars, I think.”
Tony trembled involuntarily. One side of him wanted that, so much. Fuck, didn’t that just sound like a dream? Leaving everything behind. No Obie, no Stone, no responsibility other than keeping Steve’s nightmares at bay at night. But that would also mean…
Steve smiles at him, bringing his other hand to their clasped ones, “I like that too. I didn’t want it to change. I- I don’t know why I thought it would. I don’t know. It all seems so silly right now.”
“Well people know how rowdy you can get, you got that part down for us. If an accident happens… After all I can do anything I want to you, boy,” Stone says, “no one will connect the dots back to me.”
A mantra of I fucked up, I fucked up, I fucked up went over and over in his head. He should have stayed behind. He should have stayed in the shadows. Helped without getting involved. Done something selfless for once in his life but no, Tony had to go and be selfish again. He had to go and want him and lust after him like a creep and get himself on his knees in front of Captain America. For once in his life, he could have just been happy with what he had but no, he had to go and want more.
“Snippy?,” a groggy voice from the doorway, causes Tony to peek his head up from behind the counter.
He tried to tell himself Obie could have moved or deleted the file simply because that kind of shit was incriminating to have. Maybe it had nothing to do with Tony. Maybe he had no idea Tony had ever been in his files. Maybe he really just wanted Tony to be there for a dinner with the father of his deceased boyfriend and that was all in his eyes.
It’s weird. But in a good way. Steve gets all the answers he couldn't pry out of Iron Man from Tony. And Tony periodically berates himself about talking too much about himself but it’s clear he wants to talk. More than that, it’s clear he wants to talk without being judged and if there is something Steve can do, it’s that.
But the worst thing was, every time he opened his mouth, he knew without a doubt that these were Omega pheromones.
“It’s all right, I asked him not to,” Tony came beside him, scooping up the Cap Tsum in his arms, “I knew the little beans were coming, you know, for Christmas. Not that they understand Christmas but still, I thought it would be a nice surprise for you.
So Tony gives Steve his number. Steve sends him a text. After a polite goodbye he leaves, clutching his tools to his chest and all but runs back to his house. He throws the bag onto his work table on his way up and immediately goes searching for his phone.
Iron Tsum started rumbling, almost like a purring cat as soon as he settled in Steve’s arms, he smiled down at him, then at Tony sheepishly, “Sorry for interrupting your work too.”
And now he was sitting here, looking at his prepped canvas going to waste as he thought about a nameless, faceless Omega who died three years ago in this very house.
But it only took about half an hour for the absurd blood results that he stole from and rewrote in the hospital system to bring up decades old files from his father’s personal collection, scanned and protected behind firewalls.
There’s no doubt The Avengers are busy people. From aliens, to gods with a bag of cats for brains, to a weak attempt of robots wreaking havoc in New York City... To say relationships were hard to maintain was not an understatement, but somehow through the havoc and the chaos, Tony Stark and Steve Rogers had made it work.
Tony grinns giddily. Okay, maybe he’s a little head over heels here but at least he knows he’s not the only one.
He’s a weirdo. But he’s Tony’s weirdo and Tony loves him. Also, Steve, in turn, says nothing about Tony’s dried berry and coffee addiction so it all balances out, really.
Tony watched him wait in line and vibrated with the knowledge that he, yes this man, was alive, right now, going about his daily life. He was real. He was really Captain America and he was there and real.
He didn’t try to learn his name. Not that he wouldn’t be able to. Call him paranoid but the best way to not accidentally leak evidence is if you don’t have any evidence in the first place. Call him sentimental but Tony had wanted to hear it from him, wanted his name to be something he would give Tony because they would be meeting in the middle. Tony would give him his and he would receive a name in turn.
Steve sighed. Putting the glass on the counter, he pulled the Omega back up and onto the counter. It was very hard, maneuvering with how stiff he was, but he managed to sit him on the granite top.
Tony considered that, looking at Steve who already pulled the bare mattress that was still in its plastic cover onto the floor. Steve sat down onto it. Tony perched on a padded box, now labeled “desk”. He could see the appeal of not calling strangers here.
His name was Steve and he was living on other people’s goodwill. Because he was a sweet boy like that, said the smiling woman behind the counter in that little bakery Tony had hacked to bits.
Unfortunately, Iron Man says very little for someone who likes the sound of his own voice. Steve can’t really blame him, what Iron Man is doing is probably very illegal and could cost him his job. One part of Steve does wonder how come no one has realized that Iron Man is spending a little too much time doing something that’s clearly not working while he’s still on the job he was hired to do.
Well… Tony had to kiss the frog if he wanted to be able to talk. But then again, that would tie the changeling frog to him. Maybe he could run away. Or he could stay here, never kiss the frog. And… Whatever happened would happen.
Tony preened under Steve’s sparkling gaze, bit his cinnamon roll, licking his lips showily. He was supposed to be used to being looked at but Steve’s attention was like no other. Tony had been high on his affection since last night. He knew he was putting things off, that they would catch up with him. He needed to go back to the mansion. He needed to make an excuse to Obie. He needed to-
Tony hadn’t been able to leave with him that night maybe; but he had left with a phone number and a promise to have coffee. Just coffee. Really. Nothing else.
And then there are the digital drawings he has made in the recent year. Those are probably in worse disarray somewhere in his computer, named as kjgkfjg.png and the like.
Still, he braced himself for surprises before lifting his hammer and bringing it down on the nail in a solid hit.
And Tony, bitter about people he wouldn’t be able to bring back and battles he wouldn’t be able to win, now that Howard was dead, had let it happen.
He strolls down the little path after the toddling white bum, listening to the sound of the chain rolling on the ground without paying much attention to where he’s actually going.
He talked about Bucky and the Howling Commandos. About not wanting to come back to the States after the war was over. About actually going through with that plan, drifting around in Europe, lost in every sense of the word. Cutting ties with everyone, once he realized he couldn’t age. Coming back years later, dejected, to find out that everyone he knew was either dead or about to be.
So they had packed up, Howard’s super secret super soldier files safely tucked away and went all the way over to Malibu.
But then again Obie knew. Or at least he must have, considering his lack of reaction to definite drugging and attempted sexual assault.
They enter the elevator. And then the elevator speaks, “Miss. Potts, Mr. Rogers; to the penthouse, I assume?”
Steve sighs, “Tony, the main topic is supposed to be the new accessibility controllers. Our relationship is literally the secondary topic here.”
He hates tea; claims to love the smell of coffee but will not drink it. Soft drinks are a no-no. Alcohol, he indulges sparingly.
Barely eating. Almost never sleeping. Having no thoughts other than the thoughts of death and pain, he was at the end of his resolve here.
But he had done it. He had helped Captain fucking America turn from the edge of a literal panic attack so you could pry that from his cold dead fingers. He wasn’t letting that go. His personal victory. The most important one.
“I have dinner to attend. And if I remember correctly, you have a dinner to cook, you best be off. Mr I-want-five-out-of-five-stars.”
Steve scrambled away from the wall, away from this cloud of vile smell and the moaning cries and the house. He threw himself out of the front door and onto the porch.
An uncomfortable silence came over them. Tony trembled, still stiff against his chest. He was in a tank top and some ratty sweatpants. The house was cold with the windows constantly open. Steve knew he should bring him something to wear.
He walked into the bathroom and checked himself over with a critical eye, now that the haze of the alcohol was finally gone. His face was scraped and bruised, his clothing was absolutely vile, he looked horrible. Perfect. I am sorry officer, I hit my head, you see, I don’t remember a thing.
“And at first I was going to ask them to name it Steve Rogers Petting Zoo but then I thought that was maybe kind of invasive, you know, naming it like that without your input, and then I thought about naming it Captain America Petting Zoo but then that kind of sounded silly and- Oh my God, Captain’s Petting Zoo is even sillier than that isn’t it-”
That little expressionless harbinger of doom, that pint sized behemoth, Tony’s peanut-brained personal devil choose Steve Rogers’ garden to stove away his embezzled tools.
His mind addled with sleep, he wondered if this was it. A ghost, a deadly apparition would be the end of him. The remainders of an Omega who went into this house with hopes for a sweet and easy life and had never been able to get out again, traversing his grounds that never belonged to Steve in the first place.
Steve went inside without looking after the moving truck. Sat down onto a box marked “BOOKS” in big blocky letters and sighed. His body slumped down like that last breath had been the only thing keeping him upright, like an inflatable prop.
For all that he was stuck on false bad omens, he should have realized that Obie’s car was not in the driveway when he was leaving the taxi. But he didn’t. Tony paid the driver and got off, walking past Stone’s car and unlocked the door.
The goose must be taking this stuff somewhere. This is almost a one-man organized crime at this point. The bird must have a stash and that stash must be somewhere in this little town.
Once they were inside, Tony sat on the bed and took out his laptop to turn it off, then took out the battery immediately. Then he took out his little tool kit to take their phones’ solid frames apart to took out their batteries as well.
Tony is pacing his garage. He needs his 3mm plier that is somewhere in Steve Rogers’ garden. He cannot go there. He has ordered a new one but the two day shipping is… Well, two days away. And he just has nothing else to do but pace and think.
It was kind of funny to think they had gotten together because of the Tsum Tsums in some degree. They had appeared on an alien mission once and… Just never left. Or couldn’t leave, until Tony had figured out where they came from and how. There were others too. A Hulk one, a Black Widow one… But the Cap and Iron Tsums never left each other's side. In the lab, after the fighting was over, they had huddled together to sleep; stacked on top of each other, watching Tony work...
They stood around the tree in comfortable silence for a while. Tony was stroking Cap Tsum’s little round nose. ‘He does that to me too,’ Steve thought.
There is a saying in the game development community, “Devs are the best at playing their own game; that is, until one hour after the launch.”
“You won’t! I promise you, Steve, just, yeah. I love you. I will love you with your cat ears and tail too. Honestly, I’m just more worried that Pepper will faint when she hears that you’re the Crown Prince. It’s a bit of an organizational nightmare for any future occasions we want to attend to, I guess.”
It was almost like a wave of sound. There, but not really. Muffled. Still, loud in the way that alarms and alert signals are. Danger, danger, danger.
“So, the main question is; why did you give me the map tools? Like- Don’t get me wrong, I’m very glad to be here, but like, I have seen people who’ve done much better and I’ve-” Steve shrugs, even though he knows Iron man can’t see it.
They ate in silence for a while. Steve alternated between taking a bite from his own croissant and ripping off a piece from Tony’s. Tony imagined licking the caster’s sugar off of his fingers, he re-lived in his head how he had imagined taking his bloody fingers into his mouth. He imagined he could smell the old blood. But he diligently took the pieces of pastry from his hands instead.
Tony put the notebook back into its place. Pulled out another, bigger one. This one had people in it. Sitting down in cafes, walking in the streets, running… Tony realized Steve had more than one drawing of the yoga group he passed by in Central Park, thrilled by the fact that they paid attention to the same thing.
Steve had sighed internally, still, had saluted her with his mug. Despite his reluctance to be nagged by nosy neighbours before breakfast, his politeness had won and Steve had been pulled into a conversation.
Steve crumpled before him. The Omega started crying more forcefully. Steve suddenly thought, he was probably expecting to be dragged out. Beaten.
He didn’t have much choice. He could leave. Say fuck it to the money he poured into buying the house and moving in and just, get away.
“Too much like Ty,” Tony huffed humorlessly, “Yeah, he was infuriating like that. Couldn’t get your anger out the first time?”
“Huh, it’s almost like I’m familiar with that dynamic.” He steps forward and kisses both of their cheeks before walking out the door.”
Steves checks out the frankly impressive pile of tools and knick-knacks the big bird carried into his house over the course of weeks. He sighs, he needs to do something about this. He needs to be brave. He can take his stuff to the guy. He can-
Now, back in his house, Steve sits down and puts his face in his hands. He can literally feel just how blushed his cheeks are from the warmth. But, what’s done is done. He cannot really take it back now. The mechanic’s tools are in a paper bag by the door, in case he just, you know, wants to take them and leave. Steve wouldn’t want to make him wait.
“Yes, and no one can really hack into a system they cannot read. At first I thought I could just use, you know, already existing languages and just, playdough them together but that’s more work than I thought it would be, the operators, I mean, the parts that tell the code what to do and how to read commands, they all need to be integrated and then that turns into a language all by itself and ugh,” he slumped in his chair.
Tony pouts and crosses his arms, “I think we’re all scared of her. But she makes Pepper happy, and you make me happy so we’re all one big happy family.”
Tony scrambled to the other side, all on fours, scrambling between doing something like standing up proudly in front of him to cut his way and throwing himself on the ground, hugging his leg and begging for him to stay.
That somehow gives Steve less confidence but he is saved by the bodiless elevator voice, whom he learns is Jarvis, who suggests that they search the names of the eight different balms they have laying around on the internet.
“No!” Tony shouts, making both of them flinch. Then schools his voice into something more appropriate, “I mean I didn’t,” he flails, pointing up the hill he came from, “my house is just over there so, I don’t know, I didn’t think I’d need it honestly. So I can’t really- I mean, your number- I can give you mine?”
He looked around. The apartment was barren, other than the mattress. However it wasn’t dusty in a way that one would expect from an empty house. Someone had been living here. He got up and peeked through the open door to another room, a bathroom. There were still fresh droplets on the shower curtain. Tony turned the tap open. The water flowed clear. He washed his face, his mouth, then took a drink. The cool,stale water did little to settle the queasy feeling in his stomach. His head still swam.
Steve didn’t know what to do. Did they even have rat cages? Or rat poison. But then again he’d feel bad killing the rats. Could he just catch them? Did rats carry rabies? Could he get rabies? He looked at the clock blinking on the microwave all the way in the kitchen, barely visible. 3 A.M. Who would even be…
Needless to say, he can’t sleep and he’s more than a little bit out of it throughout all his classes. Also his back definitely makes it known that the way he sits in front of the computer needs to change.
Laying Tony down on the bed, he brushes the stray hair from his forehead.  Taking off both their shirts, Steve pulls the blanket over their bodies and kisses him. “This.”
Warmth. For a moment, his cold hand leached the glorious heat from the wall. It took a sharp turn in the warm vanilla that surrounded him and a bang that resounded throughout the house to bring Steve back into the reality where walls were not inexplicably warm.
He had ran to his ensuite and puked whatever junk he had eaten for dinner, then went back to watching with shaking hands and an aching throat.
Tony wasn’t really scared of someone prosecuting Captain America of murder, really. He was more concerned with the fact that Captain America had gone of the radar, and was willingly living like a homeless person instead of reaping the benefits of… Well… Being Captain America.
Steve laid in bad, ramrod straight and unmoving in the darkness. Listening. It was almost like a weight, an invisible demon, sat on his chest. He couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t move.
The elevator door pings open and Steve walks in, he slides his leather jacket off and turns to see Tony, with an apron on, nonetheless bent over the table as he places something down, he blushes and clears his throat. “Well, hi there mista—”
Tony wanted to turn, but he couldn’t move. The asphalt under his face got gradually damper with warm blood trickling in. Somewhere in his mind he knew this was a lot of blood. Too much blood.
So they ended up sitting side by side in a cafe with ice held up to Tony’s wrist, waiting for their almond croissants to arrive. Steve was still sniffling every once in a while. Tony could still feel the last dregs of adrenaline coursing through his veins, feel the tightness in his own hunched shoulders that he couldn’t relax. All of it acting as little signs that told people to stay the fuck away.
He slumps. The guy lives fifteen minutes away. He really couldn’t have come up with a more offensive way of returning the stuff and making the situation even more uncomfortable. He could even add a note. Hey remember how rudely I turned you down the first time we met? Well I still don’t want to see your face, just so you know.
Steve weirds himself out with how quickly he goes from playing The Avengers for four hours a day to building maps for it for four hours a day. In fact, since he walked through the Iron Man’s bossfight arena doors, he’s been the only one he played against. And he enjoys it, he does, but it also scares him a little.
Steve’s character twitches from left to right behind the rock he’s hiding, “Well, I have scoliosis. I either die now or I will actually die because of my back.”
So Obie had hid the footage, and it probably wouldn’t further the investigation much anyway. Just create another scandal and well, don’t speak ill of the dead, yadda yadda… Still, the fact that Obie knew what Ty did and was still calling him a bright, young boy curdled his stomach.
Whenever he had closed his eyes he heard Elvis Presley and thump, thump, thump, crunch. And it seemed like Obie was more inconvenienced by Ty’s death than anyone else, so Tony played into it. Went around the mansion with its fucking dim lights like he had no idea what to do.
He wanted to lift his head, to push him away. But his head bobbed up and down with Ty’s manhandling, hitting and scraping against the asphalt against his will. His hands felt like static, his legs didn’t listen to him. What did you give me, you motherfucker. Tony wanted to scream but his mouth just leaked more vomit and spit against his will. I’m going to choke and die, Tony thought, I’m going to die with my pants down in an alley. His head swam.
Tony took a step back, away from him but no words came out of his mouth. Surely someone was hearing all of this right now. Cleaners, cooks… Somebody.
“You think I don’t have an alibi? You think we didn’t disable the cameras in here? Let everyone out early like the benevolent employers that we are?” He chuckled, “No one,” Stone opened his arms to the sides, “no one saw me coming in.”
So much that he almost didn’t hear the keys jangling outside the door. He jumped at the sudden click of the lock. A cold gust of air brought the smell of something into the room. Tony pushed his laptop off to the side, blind in the dark after the bright screen.
“It’s fine,” Tony flashed a quick smile, “It’s nothing, really,” he could feel Steve’s eyes on him as he lifted his ice bag to make room for their food.
Actually, it’s a little refreshing. Tony has always been the weirdo in his relationships. He has no sleep schedule. He’s a billionaire, playboy (no longer), philanthropist. He talks to his home security systems and has a green energy company.
“Yeah,” Tony nodded, “he’s dead.” He got off from his box, sat down beside Steve and leaned on his shoulder.
Tony sighed. He wanted to claim the goat could probably smell it but… Well. It did make Steve happy.
“Oh no! That was just the worst thing to say. It’s not about you, really! Wait no! Ugh!” He takes a deep breath. “I just wanted someone to care about me for just who I am! Being a royal is- God I sound vain. But, well, yeah.”
“I’m sure Bucky can help. I mean he did help me keep my identity secret for so long and if he didn’t blurt it out himself, then I’m sure we can just… Ease the media into it.”
He checks himself out in the mirror one last time. Fixes his hair and washes his hands once again. The grease under his nails will never be fully gone probably but he can try. Make an effort. Yeah.
Which in turn had brought Tony and Steve together. Tony couldn’t leave their side and Steve just wanted to see them, one more time, a little bit jealous about how free they were with their affection, crawling on top of him and Tony. Their Tsum counterparts were good for each other. It had turned out, so were the human ones.
Steve knows exactly how the high-end, diamond tipped cutter came into his house and from where. And the screwdrivers. And the pliers. And the tape.
Steve pointed to the sign over the entrance, saying Captain’s Petting Zoo in big bold letters tentatively, “Is this? What is this?”
Steve slowly pushed away the covers. Bare footed, he slowly crept to the door, pressed his ear to the wood. Listened.
“I like it. The salad was crunchy and the chicken was lovely. Well done Tones.” Steve smiles and wipes his mouth with his napkin, “You did great.”
Tony was annoyed at himself now that he didn’t wait a little bit more to buy the furniture. He had wanted the apartment to look like someone was indeed moving in after the cleaning, for the neighbours to see. If he had waited he could have gotten Steve an actual drawing table that angled and shit. Well, he still could. Maybe.
In the end, there he was, wide and muscled as he was in the dark and heavily shaded video where he had beaten Ty bloody, so bad that the body needed DNA identification to close the case and finalize the autopsy. Blond hair slightly bleached at the tips from the sun, light eyes almost shy as he purchased two bagels, one plain and one raisin.
Steve has been fighting, he has actually been fighting for almost three hours now. His hand is cramping. His back is killing him. His health potions are gone and he only has about 15% of his health left. He checks out his mana meter refilling at an alarmingly slow rate. He cannot get another hit. He cannot. He’ll die.
Getting closer to the goose, Tony realizes there is a red ribbon tied in a neat bow around his neck. From this ribbon dangles a piece of paper.
The house looked more like a house than the last time he had been here. Steve had finished assembling the furniture. It still looked a bit bare, a bit makeshift but it was alright. For now.
Tony could see his hard cock bobbing up and down even through his pants as he moved, he hooked his fingers into Steve’s belt loops, “Yes. Yeah, come on.”
And Steve, after being convinced that Tony wasn’t going to perish immediately in the middle of Central Park from a bruised wrist, suggested they go and find some ice.
He carried his precious cargo into the kitchen. He didn’t open the lights, not wanting to shock the Omega’s eyes after God knows how long in that dark hole. He placed Tony onto the floor, positioning him so that his back was supported by the cupboard.
He had never understood though. Howard’s decades long obsession. Only now he was realizing that, maybe, Howard had suspected this. That Captain America was still alive. That maybe he couldn’t die.
Okay, no going down that road. He did it once already. And he’s still pacing. Tony’s feelings and opinions about Steve Rogers are not the answer to this dilemma.
Sliding her heels back off, Pepper laughs, walking around and sitting next to him, “What’s got you so distracted anyway. Are you plotting something?”
“Well, Sam and I are going to a few SHIELD meetings,” he kisses Tony’s cheek, “Nothing interesting, I know you have SI. Try not to fall asleep.”
Tony ran his hands through Steve’s sweat damp hair, tried to remember any other time he had been so turned on, so close to coming without even getting undressed. He just couldn’t. Steve on top of him, arms so tight around him, hands kneading his sides forcefully, Tony finally felt like the panic in him abate. He was safe. He repeated to himself like a mantra that Steve would keep him safe. And Tony would do anything to keep him here.
The moment he got up and got free, details rushed to him. Blood. Everywhere. Slick on the floor. Warm, covering his hands, arms up to his elbows. Soaking into Stone’s shirt and pants, his arm bent in the middle of his forearm at an unnatural angle.
Tony had nodded. It had made sense that he didn’t want to leave with Tony right away that night. And well, it had been a subject they could both vent to each other about. It had helped them bond, in a way.
Now that Steve had seen one, his eyes could pick up another dark blob, scurrying up along the side of the tinsel.
Tony slowly approached the tree, crouched and sat down on the damp grass, on the other side of the large trunk. Dew immediately starting to make its way through his thin jeans. Still, he couldn’t bring himself to open his mouth.
Steve shuddered, suddenly acutely aware of the hard ground underneath him, the wetness that had been seeping through his clothes.
Inside, the acrid smell lingered. Steve opened all the windows, sitting in the living room with a blanket over his shoulders.
Steve scrunches up his nose, “Firstly, I’m not, secondly, Steve-like? Would you like to elaborate, Anthony.”
“No I mean,” Steve snorts, runs a hand through his hair, then sits straighter, ready for questioning, “Are you- Is Iron Man always controlled by a human? You? Someone else?” He pauses; then continues, Can I even ask that?”
It was so weird. Possibly the closest thing Tony ever had to a date. He gazed at the busy street through the floor to ceiling windows, peeking at Steve every so often. No rushing, no cajoling, no manipulation. Just Steve, who was sitting on his hands in the plush armchair and still managing to seem fidgety, and Tony, with his ice in a plastic bag held up to his wrist. Stealing glances at each other.
And anywhere else, in any other place but in Steve’s arms, he would have acted like it was a nonchalant kind of carelessness. But here, he could admit that no one ever cared about him and he didn’t care about them. Tony was familiar with being used for money, sex, access. The sparkliest of the necklaces and cufflinks, the biggest bottle of vodka with the best cocaine in the city, clubs and penthouses with beds that covered half the room…
He knew what the problem was, Steve realized in a sudden moment of clarity. He stood at the door, looking around in his living room, taking in the barren walls. He didn’t feel at home here. To Steve, this was still someone else’s house.
Deciding on a grid pattern over the largest empty wall, Steve picked up a couple nails in his mouth. He laid his hand on the wall. Soft. Steve pushed. Cushiony. He ran his hands over the expanse of the walls. Were they insulated? Stone hadn’t talked about anything like that. But it was almost like the walls were covered in layers.
He checked his pocket to find his phone and wallet untouched. 27 missed calls from Obie. He’d deal with that in a minute.
Taking a sip of his drink, Tony laughs, “Sure babe, but if I’m going to win I’m going to need your full stamina.”
The genius slouches back in his chair, looking between his friend and his phone, “It’s Hammer tech, they’re making the same advances as Howard did in the eighties. Mind-blowingly numb!”
Unlike breakfast, lunch comes along much smoother, his chicken is tender and the salad is crunchy and yummy. Hopefully, Steve would like this more. Of course, it wouldn’t be complete without some soft drink that Steve likes. This week's interest was Diet Coke. WHO drinks Diet Coke?? God that’s ridiculous. Just drink the coke.
They keep on sitting at the table. It’s been hours and Steve feels like neither of them want to leave.
Tony gaped for a second, then joined him, nerves finally abating about this entire thing at last, “You’re not angry with me, are you?”
He’s had it. A goose is a glorified duck. Tony will not hear anything else on this matter. Also a goose definitely does not need one flat head and three Phillips head screwdrivers; two pliers, one needle nose and one grooved; a roll of blue painter’s tape, in mint condition; wire cutters; one putty knife; one medium sized hammer and two bananas.
He pointed out other shops and changes, buildings that were now gone, entire alleys that disappeared to create the large plazas… Everything, he remembered in picture perfect detail.
Stone screamed again, frenzied and cut off, but there was no one in the entire mansion to hear him. You and Obie made sure of that, Tony thought as he heard the bone give a wet crunch, thank you.
“So now you’re making a new one that can do all the things,” Steve gestures vaguely, “the other ones can do?”
And the reason had come out once they had sat down in an obscure little coffee shop that Steve had chosen, milky porcelain cups in hand.
Now that he was found, battered and bruised but not dead, there was going to be a week or so where Obie wouldn’t be so strict with him. He had been almost fatally alcohol poisoned once. And once after that he had almost overdosed on cocaine.
He could call Obie now, bring him and the police and the private detectives he had certainly already hired to this very apartment where someone clearly lived for a while. Enough for the mattress to leave a damp mark on the floorboards. They could probably find him from the hairs that got stuck in the drain. He’d be locked up and no longer stopping sexual assault cases he encountered. Excessive force or not, that didn’t seem like a good tradeoff to Tony.
So Steve loses, but also, he gets a date. From Iron Man. And it makes him feel weird to call it a date because what he has is a day and an hour, which is a date. Technically. But it’s not a- A romantic date. They will just like, meet to talk and try to kill each other again. Which sounds ridiculous. But it’s a date. Not like that. But still…
All he knows is that this has been the most fun boss battle of his life and he will most certainly die in the next couple of minutes. Who knows when it will be his turn to fight Iron Man again. He’s been having so much fun but a slow realization dawns on him as he realizes his time with the boss is coming to an end; the fight hasn’t been fun just because of the incredible challenge of it.
He listened all night for another clue of a sound, laid in bed with the whisper of a smell in his nose. Vanilla, underneath it all.
The days refuse to pass. Thursday is a blur. He’s at the school but his mind is elsewhere. Even Steve doesn’t know where. He forgets the graded designs from his students at home and just tells them everyone got an A. Because why not. He’s the teacher, he can do whatever he wants and then goes on a tangent about how art is about expressing yourself and that part cannot be graded.
This couldn’t be hard. He flicks through the easy, fool-proof recipe and claps his hands, “Right, let’s do this.”
He slowly descended the stairs, hammer in hand and raised up high already. His arms shook with the idea of swinging it down, breaking the wall, ending it all.
Steve hid the carrot under one of the three buckets he had and started moving them like a shell game. After a dizzyingly long time, he stopped. The goat nudged the bucket on the left, which had the carrot underneath and started munching as Steve gazed at him proudly.
He let it fall to the floor, nearly missing his foot. The sudden thud of the hammer hitting the floor broke his petrified reverie.
“No one in a room like that would turn and look at you twice if you died in your own vomit,” Tony had kissed Steve’s palm, resting on his cheek, “and they would act so sad in the morning, you’d have no idea,” another kiss, “that they didn’t give a damn.”
“You know I can actually see that when some of my very necessary building components suddenly disappear, right?”
“I know, God, fuck, I know. I’m sorry. I just- I bought the house, I just couldn’t leave it like that, I-” He hissed at the sudden spike of pain from his wrist. When the gripping hand abruptly disappeared, his wrist was already filling with blood under his skin, blooming a fierce red that would surely turn into an ugly bruise that would heal in blotches of blue black purple, mottled with yellowish greens.
“Nah,” Steve grabbed the little Iron Tsum and placed him on his shoulder, “I woke up hungry and we’re out of milk upstairs in the mini-fridge so-”
“No. No, nothing like that, but God, I have to see you, okay? I have to talk to you. I’m coming back, just stay there, alright?”
“I would- I would like to stay human, actually. So that- Uh- We could talk. And you could tell me about your kingdom.”
Steve knew the moment the Omega’s chin started to tremble, he was already gone. He didn’t know where to start. He didn’t know what they would do, where they would go from here, come morning.
He got into the apartment on the edge of tears, hands fumbling with the keys. He opened the door, only to be swallowed up by another body, arms coming around him, vice tight.
For a while, he must have actually fallen asleep. When he came to himself with a jolt, the sun was setting, painting the curtains down in the living room a purplish blue. His ass was numb. His legs filled with static.
He ducked into an alley with two huge trash cans, close enough that he could have feasibly walked by himself in the night but far enough that it might have slipped away in an area sweep. He sat himself down between the cans, and dialed.
Steve lifts Tony’s chin up, looking into his eyes, “Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Just for one day. I’ll see if you’re a good chef.”
Steve drew back, towering over Tony, one of his knees between his legs, pressing into his crotch. The blue of his irises were still swallowed up by the dilated pupils but the edge of his anger was gone, all that was left was fondness and arousal.
It had been a little cringy for Steve to watch the interviews where the usual magazine reporters who knew jack shit about games tried to make sense of a billionaire’s love for something they saw so menial.
Because Iron Man seems interested in Steve, but also, that could mean anything. And that’s the sad thing, that Iron Man is probably just a thoughtful guy who genuinely saw something in Steve’s gameplay style and doesn’t mind becoming friends. Kind of friends. Doesn’t mean he would be interested like that.
Since the eggs can wait and the sausages will take their sweet time cooking, they have no reason to hurry. Which brings them to Steve's insistence that Dum-E gets to do something Tony would not allow any other time: Help with setting the table.
Steve doubled over, still at the door. He retched once, twice. Barely reached the kitchen sink before emptying the contents of his stomach into the basin.
Tony would stay at that little apartment for forever, but he has to go home at some point so that Obie wouldn’t come looking after him. Obie never really looked for him before when he spent the night somewhere else, but then again back then he knew Tony was with Ty, that Ty dragged him wherever he went.
If Steve hadn’t been sold on his humanness before, now he is. And he’s not quite sure what to do with this information. Is there a person hired to direct Iron Man? Is there a team? This one seems to know Steve and the previous match.
It’s not that hard to get the orbs. Steve racks them up pretty easily with the damage he’s doing. But now he is divided. Does he want to win? Or does he want the orbs? He shoots, “Okay, that’s thirty four. Is it always controlled by a human and is there only one of you?”
Even though Tony was so out of it, he could still hear the music playing through the walls. People chatting and laughing, muffled but still there, a reminder that anyone could walk in on them, Ty and him. Just a single raised voice and someone could barge in. He wished so much that someone would barge in, headlines be damned.
As Steve had predicted, the goose kept stealing his tools. And kept stashing them in Steve’s house. And Tony just kept… Going back to retrieve them. In time it became Steve coming over to drop off some things Tony had not yet realized gone missing and staying to chat for a bit. Or Tony realizing things were missing and going to Steve’s house for a coffee, waiting for the goose to come from parading his stolen goods around.
They sat in silence for a while, watching the dust from the opened boxes dance and slowly settle in the sunbeams.
“So weak,” Steve’s lips trailed his jaw with a gentleness that contrasted the vice of his arms, found his lips, planted little whispers of kisses, “I’d do anything for you. Anything.”
There was nothing above this. Everyone wanted Tony Stark. They wanted a piece of his cash, a piece of his legacy. They fucked him like as if, if they touched his bare skin enough times, some of this genius would rub off on them. Tony had nothing to give to them.
“I just! Oh God, this is a mess,” Steve buries his face into his hands, his ears flatten on his head, “I didn’t think we’d get this far.”
Tony shifts on his chair, “Okay, so, I am planning on making a- A security system, but also like, a smart house software but not like those that open and close your lights from your phone, something that will monitor the entire house, keep track of everything that comes in and leaves, connected to the internet and satellite and- Well, yeah.”
For three years Stone had lived in this house where his Omega had died. Had it been finally too much? Did he have enough of looking around and seeing memories everywhere? Or had he stayed deliberately? Had he tried to stay close to the Omega he lost for one more day, telling himself this would be the last every time he woke up, only to find himself going to bed without posting an ad?
It’s just that, sometimes it’s still hard for Steve to remember he has grown, both literally and figuratively, and possibly more than doubled in weight. He’s… Well, decent looking now. Not a scrawny little kid. On the outside, at least. Inside is a whole another matter.
He went to the living room, but there, the room just smelled like linseed oil from his fluid white mixture. He returned to the kitchen, trying to catch the smell.
“Steve?” Tony stood at the entrance of the common kitchen area of the Avengers Tower and tried to make sense of what he was seeing, “Is that… A goat?”
His day with Steve started to seem like a dreamscape the moment he had stepped back into the mansion. If not for his wrist, he could have convinced himself that the entire thing had been a dream.
Obie started talking the moment Tony tapped on accept. HIs tone was familiar. His worry was disgustingly familiar too. He recognized this voice and tone from way back. Had it always been this fake? Or was it Tony’s newfound distrust coloring his ideas. The call ended without Tony saying much about anything and Obie running over him with his words.
“It sounds really stupid when you said it like that but yeah; I mean you get to pet a goat, kids get to pet a goat. And to be honest, babe, I can get you a petting zoo. A petting zoo where professionals take care of the animals and we get to reap the benefits so why not? You should get to pet as many goats as you want to.”
Steve laughs, “People still send snail mail?” They fell the entire Skrull band between the two of them. A little experience points marker pops up on Steve’s screen.
Listening to the irregular scratch of the pencil on paper was hypnotizing. Calming. Tony felt as if he opened his mouth, said a word, the moment would be broken. The man would disappear into thin smoke.
He doesn’t want to fuck that up because he couldn’t keep his hands to himself. And about hair, of all things.
“You were. You were supposed to die and Obadiah was supposed to inherit Stark Industries and we were supposed to merge. It was a foolproof plan, really. Though I think you know how that all went, right? I think you were there.”
With some of his older painted canvases and canvas prints under one arm and a hammer in one hand, Steve came back down. He placed everything on his couch and looked around consideringly. This was a good idea. The only good idea he had since moving in, honestly. No wonder he couldn’t paint. His muses did not surround him here. He didn’t feel at home.
“Of course,” he rests his chin on Steve’s head, “what are you going to be doing for the rest of the day.”
Tsum Tsums. The little aliens that were the likenesses of them, only in small, bread-roll-ish forms. Now that the lights were on, he could see the Iron Man one, the Tony one, was on top of the tree. While his likeness was on the tinsel, trying to make his way up to the top.
That- Tony shivered. He hugged Steve’s arm. Steve smiled down at him. They walked in silence after that, world around them getting quieter as they left the streets lined with cafes and shops and made their way into the housing dense areas.
“Oh Cap, I’m definitely one of a kind,” Iron Man giggles. It’s so weird, hearing the sound, distorted and coming from that menacing, demonic figure. Then he continues, “Yeah, Iron Man is controlled by me. It’s my job. Kind of. Many things are automated, some things are not.”
Heart in his mouth, Tony observed him from afar. Like a fucking creep, the thought, but then pushed that down.
He was aware that this could go very wrong. He could just end up dead in a ditch, which would have been the exact opposite of what he set out to do. Though that did seem a bit out there, as rational fears go when meeting Captain America. Still...
“God, do you have any idea how scared you got me here? Huh?” He pulled back and looked into Tony’s eyes, “All I could do was pacing and pacing, no idea if you were in trouble or not, not being able to do anything Tony I-”
He spent the entire day in a daze, being ushered from one makeshift interrogation room to the other at the hospital while doctors tended to his wounds and gave him IV fluids.
Avengers Initiative. It would be fine. Steve and him, they would be fine no matter what. They had been laying low, staying quiet for so long, trying to figure out what they were.
When they reached the apartment, Steve ran his thumb over his hand, brought it to his lips to kiss once before letting him go to unlock the door.
There, stands the goose, with a chain hanging from its beak. It happily waddles inside once Steve steps aside and drops the chain onto its pile.
Was the smell embedded into whatever the wall padding was? But who had scared an Omega that bad? For the smell to sink in like that. That permanently.
Beautiful, strong, caring Steve with napalm like temper, who was still at the door with his back to Tony, forehead pressed against the wood and hand trying to rip off the doorknob.
Steve sighed, “That’s because he was busy eating a 24-pack of toilet paper when I found him. And oh- I called a vet for that, I think they will have to take him away to get that fixed,” he grimaced.
Tony has never been a businessman. Not even his old man was that much of a one. That role was always Obie’s. But they both had drilled one thing into Tony’s mind early on, no matter how brilliant your idea was, if you weren’t fast enough, someone else would think of it too eventually.
“And you don’t have to apologize because you don’t drink coffee. I’m serious Steve, just- I’m serious, tell me what kibble you like and I’ll get you kibble. This all seems very , well, inconsequential to me. Like, there isn’t anything else, right?”
It had been a pain in the ass to keep his bruised wrist a secret from him, especially with the restricted movement, but at least Tony had experience hiding injuries. Maybe the one good thing that came out of his on again off again relationship with Ty was that it taught him how to be sneaky.
“Okay,” Tony drawled, he was sensing… Things. Sensy things. Yeah… “So when are his owners picking him up?”
The elevator doors open and Tony Stark is standing there, somehow managing to seem awkward in a tailored suit and opens his arms to the sides, “Yay! It’s me! Please don’t start throwing things at me, I can explain. I mean, you can throw things at me. Been there, done that. Or it’s been done to me. But at least let me explain first. Then start throwing. Not the salt lamp though. That’s Pepper’s but everything else is fair game.”
Maybe it was his subconscious, trying to be everything Howard couldn’t ever be in front of Captain America. Cool, calm, level-headed.
Tony had told himself that he would try to make it seem like it was a coincidence if he got caught snooping. Obie was from the Howard Stark school of there is no such thing as coincidence though so that might not have worked but still, he had done it anyway.
Tony claps his hands and quickly lays out the table, he grabs an extra water bottle for his supersoldier boyfriend who drinks unnecessary amounts of water per day.
It had been something that they compromised on. Steve was never too comfortable with sudden gifts. And Tony had way too many impulses to completely cut the habit. So instead of buying something cool but completely useless out of the blue, they had decided on surprise dates. Steve was always up for spending time together and Tony couldn’t deny he loved spoiling Steve. So, it seemed to work well so far.
Well. What happened had happened and Steve should have apologized when he had the chance. But now, after so much time, it would be weird to go to the guy’s house and apologize.
Steve smiles. Wrapping his hands around Tony’s waist from behind, coos just like he did for Dum-E and he plants a kiss on his head, “Don’t call him trash pile, you’ll hurt his feelings.”
“I heard you buddy, I’m on it,” Steve slowly rises from his chair and leaves his brooding aside to open his door.
They quietly made it up back up to the shared kitchen, Steve holding the gun, being the one with better aim for things like this. Tony was right behind him, peeking around to see what was going on.
If Steve can focus on only hiding, he can create the time to Google some strategies about messing with chatbots. He is scrolling through the search results when the Iron Man gets bored.
Did ghosts remember danger? The way they went or got stuck in between? What would scare somebody, if they were already dead? Could ghosts still feel pain?
“Yes?” Steve has to remind himself at that moment, that Iron Man is an AI and can’t really think about the implications of that. Hell, he can’t think. Unless someone has coded that into him, which seems pretty unlikely, still…
Back in the car about three hours later with their own goat’s milk that Steve milked himself (“Oh! It’s warm,” Steve had said, an enchanted smile on his face), Steve reached towards Tony from the passenger side and pulled him in for a kiss, “Thank you. This was… It was really the best gift ever. And to think that kids will get to learn here is-” He shrugged, “That really makes it special.”
“And I understood so much, I understood that I want to live with you, I want to marry you, I want to wake up by your side every day, and I know we already do most of those things, but I just know, that you’re going to be in my future, no matter what.”
He Googled “what to do if my house is haunted”. He burned the sage he ripped out of herbal tea bags.
For the blissful moments the sage burnt and spread its heady, thick smoke around, there was no Omega smell. No other smell other than sweet smoke that he welcomed.
He picked up a glass from the cupboard. His hands left bloody prints on it. Turning on the tap, he discarded the stained glass. Ran his hand under cold water, then picked up another glass, filling it up.
There was no clue to where the smell was coming from. One moment, it was there, swimming through the air to reach him. If Steve moved to suddenly, if he made loud noises, it got sharper. Then it disappeared mysteriously.
You’re having sleep paralysis, said the logical part of his brain, these, the sounds, are a hallucination caused by your superstitions and your vulnerable state.
The similarities were there though. Steve couldn’t stand unfairness. Howard used to say Captain America had started out with a kid who always stood up to bullies and never knew how to back down, before the obsession and the alcohol, before, when Tony was just old enough to understand.
Steve leaned over too, his alarmingly quick anger forgotten, his hand reached to touch Tony’s cold pinky.
Steve felt his lungs burning. Either his head swam from taking big gulps of air, trying to get some more of that smell in or his chest ached from a constant, conscious effort to try and take the smallest breaths, trying to shun the smell.
Steve still cannot really wrap his brain around it. He’s supposed to… What? Have a one versus one with Iron Man in an arena he designed just for the shits and giggles? Who’s giggles? Is this an official match? What if he wins?
Tony watches him through the door he left ajar. Steve gently pokes the screw down the table, then he pokes it with the tip of his shoe on the floor, watching it roll around with glee.
Steve’s determined excitement lasts all of five minutes when he sits down with his drawings and designs. He hasn’t made a portfolio in years. The last time he had prepared one was when he was applying as a teacher and even then, they hadn’t really looked at the works in it, just his credentials.
It starts with Steve instinctively pushing shit off of Tony's table. Tony wants to show him his new projects, get Steve involved because that's what they're doing now. Getting involved in each other's stuff. Because they are boyfriends.
Someone helping you get a job when you asked for help is one thing. Thinking you got somewhere on your own merit and discovering it’s all been a lie is something else entirely. And it’s just, Steve cannot stand dishonesty. He cannot stand unwanted favours. He cannot stand-
For the last three years, Tony had been inside this dark cavern, carved out by the one person who was responsible for protecting him.
Steve’s face, as they parked, was… A bit blank. Tony would have considered himself good at reading Steve’s facial expressions normally but right now, addled with his own apprehension, he was drawing blank himself. He pressed the button to turn off the car and wiped his sweaty hands on his jeans. He really wanted this to go well.
Rogers hadn’t looked like a bigot then, and with all that he has heard about him, Tony doesn’t think he’s one either. Maybe he’s straight. A huge possibility. But that alone still doesn’t explain his hostility.
Steve had immediately left the apartment, coming over to deal with the mess, berating himself about leaving Tony alone. He had pressed his lips to Tony’s forehead, neck, over his pulse right at the door, engulfing him in his arms, “Never again, you’re not dealing with anything by yourself again.”
After they had bagged up and cleaned up everything in New York though, Tony had offered to go to Malibu.
“Steve!! If you don’t come pick up your live pillow stuffing, you’re going to see it under the cloche for tonight’s dinner.”
All right, maybe he could let go of the bananas. The little dude, or dudette, has probably already demolished what was supposed to be Tony’s attempt at starting healthy eating habits three weeks ago.
The burn gets redder and redder while he’s on the train and starts to throb in a very distracting way. Surely, a normal person would just email or call in the front desk, explain the situation and ask to reschedule. But at that moment, Steve’s mind is zeroed in on the possibilities and he’s definitely not thinking right either.
There stood the house, pale blue and behind a generic white picket fence. Up close and personal, it all looked pretty tame and ordinary to Steve. And frankly, a little bit tasteless but he had refrained from commenting, in the face of the other Alpha’s enthusiasm.
Tony had gotten rusty. Dealing with Ty, trying to forget that he existed while he was just there hadn’t been good to his brain. But Ty was gone and he was still here and that had to mean something.
Steve laughed, put his head in the crook of his neck, laid on top of him, engulfing Tony completely, “Let’s stay in bed today, until you have to- have to leave,” he sucked on the thin skin behind his ear, “give me this.”
And then they talked about more personal details. Steve’s insecurities from when he was dealing with asthma and was as thin as a stick that never quite left. Tony’s inability to pay attention to anybody or anything but his craft for more than two seconds that drove all his ex-es away.
Obie had stood up to leave, turned around, then pointed to a covered platter sitting on his side table, “I had some food brought up while you were sleeping, the pot stickers with the crab filling that you liked. It must have gone cold by now but heat it up, yeah,” he had patted his shoulder, bending over to reach him, alarmingly close, “eat something real for a change.”
Of all things, they actually end up arguing about the work Steve is doing for the Avengers. And they are not even past the inventory page yet. The thing is, Steve doesn’t want to argue with Iron Man; but the pushy boss-character-man just makes it so hard to stay calm.
Suddenly, Steve was exhausted. The anger left him. The anxiety drained away. He was tired. Bone deep, crushingly tired. He swayed on his feet. He turned towards the staircase. His head was empty. No thoughts formed in his brain. Even his own footsteps were too loud.
“Still, a merge with S.I. is not something I can just let go because you decided to turn your life around. I know you’ll understand Tony, business is business,” Stone grinned.
Steve sits up and flips them over so Tony is underneath his body, while Tony’s head is cradled in Steve’s suspiciously delicate hands, “You called me your husband. Do you really want that?”
And weeks, no scratch that, years of fear from Ty, Obie’s straight out dismissal of everything he had done to Tony, every hurt he had compartmentalized, that he had bottled up and put on the shelf came out. Tony put his face into Steve’s chest and cried like he hasn't in years.
Tony caught his fumbling hands in his own, feeling the little tremble Steve gave. It melted his heart, filling his chest with some giddy warmth that Steve would be ready to kill a man one second but blush when asking for sex. Tony had sex. Or he thought he had. It wasn’t that he had bad sex before, he enjoyed himself. Or that no one ever fucked him slowly, taking their time. But it all had been a performance, a competition to see who would hold out the longest, who could pleasure the other well enough.
He took a heaving breath. The smell, even stronger now, almost like a mist, filled his nose and mouth, covered his taste buds. Steve continued puking.
Steve is suddenly, extremely furious. Who the hell that fucker thinks he is? Steve didn’t tell him about his application for a reason. Does he think he can just meddle with Steve’s business? Does he think he’s helping?
“I don’t think it works that way sweetheart,” Steve pulls Tony towards the elevator. If it’s left to him, they will never be leaving this room ever again.
He probably doesn’t even remember you, says a little voice in his head, he probably hasn’t even lingered on it like you do, forgot about it the moment you had left.
“I don’t want you to, uh, get the wrong impression with this. I really do give the last go on the art and design stuff, I- I am this game. I’m in this game. This has been- Well, you probably know that part, sorry. The thing is, the art department really liked your portfolio and they sent it to me with all the others because well, we are looking for a level designer and an environment designer. And I just recognized one of the arenas we had designed and it just looked good in your hand and I-”
“Steven, no, no, I thought we agreed you wouldn’t call me mista, my brain isn’t much use when it’s turned to mush.”
All these years and still, no one had connected them to the disappearance of Obie and Stone. Or the previous murders. Tony knew Fury had suspicions, since the day his kidnapping forced Steve to come out of hiding, to reveal himself as Captain America.
Steve laughs and holds both of Tony’s hands, “You’re not some damsel in distress, you’re Tony. My Tony.” He pulls him close and wraps his boyfriend up in his arms.
“Don’t you worry about me,” Steve kissed his temple, once they found enough energy to leave the bed, “we’ll find a way. I know a genius that could help.”
Steve stood there, back to the door with blood and bile soaked into his clothes. His haphazardly wiped hands had left faint, bloody prints on the light switch. His right hand gripped his keys still. Tony’s brain was immediately firing at full speed; where had he been, where was the body, where did he touch, which subdivision’s database did he need to hack into?
Had they treated him badly? Like a lab rat, rather than a human? It would be a shame if someone were to go and dig up dirt on government officials and then release it into the public but what could you do?
Steve plays with the kind of precision you wouldn’t expect even from a pre-rendered cutscene. And so, it’s not really surprising that he gets to the famous last boss of The Avengers, breaking records left and right. The Iron Man.
Steve bundled him up in his arms, pressed his face to his tear wrecked one, “No more, Tony, oh God, never again, okay? I’m here now. You- You’re-” Tony felt Steve’s face warm up, “Mine.”
“Steve!!” Tony grabbed his arm suddenly, “Oh God, this was supposed to be a surprise! JARVIS, lights.”
He has made the calculations. Ran the numbers. The goose cannot be hiding its stolen goodies anywhere too far. First of all, it’s a goose. With short legs. And it has been seen stealing stuff that was too heavy for it to fly with. Second of all, it’s always around. So considering the time it would need to steal, leave, stash and come back; it’s probably hiding its stuff in some unseen but not unreachable and definitely not far away place.
“You’re a smart boy. I told Obadiah that if he played with your mind a little, you’d be confused enough, try to act before you planned everything through, you were bound to leave a trail. You hid the apartment thing well, I’ll give you that. We had to hire a detective, one of those guys who follow cheating husbands and shit, you know those guys. That and well, the curtains you ordered and their size. Cross searched with the apartments sold in the last couple of months around the town... “
After a beat of silence, Iron Man speaks, “I will act like I didn’t hear that very hurtful thing you just said.”
An invisible hand closed around Tony’s heart, it’s a heavy weight in his chest. He got hurt because of me. No, for me. A slight pout. A constant arch to his brows.
He sat down, leaned back and closed his eyes as everything rebooted and the security sweep got completed. Steve and him had talked until late at night. Tony didn’t want to push him, but there was still so much he wanted to ask Steve.
And still, Tony doesn’t regret the fact that started this relationship. Steve had told him in the beginning that he wanted to take things slow. Tony had been okay with that. He is still okay with that. And he had gone into this relationship knowing that.
“I quite like cooking for you though,” he looks up into Steve’s eyes, “Thank you for this, it’s all truly wonderful.”
“Don’t go, please,” he slowly reached for his hand, the right one, the hale one, lightly touching the warm palm with his own cold digits, “Please.”
He had big hammers in his closet. Left over from the times he made his own frames. What was a wall to a hammer, swung with the helpless anger that brewed in him for days now.
He wanted to jump to action at the whisper, take Steve into his arms, rid him of his soiled shirt but held himself back, “Yes baby,” he got up, but didn’t go any closer, “What do you need?”
The said goat, now done with the lamp, started exploring the kitchen area, his little hooves clicking on the tiles.
“—re all great ideas Mr Hammer, thank you for your input. I’ll have a transcript written and sent to your office by the end of the day, Mr Stark and I will continue further discussions.”
He laughs again, breathless and beautiful, “Okay, as long as I get to call you mine,” Steve rolls over, pulling Tony onto his chest, “If it slips out, I can’t help it.”
God, but Obie did run everything and Tony hadn’t even stopped to question it. He thought Obie cared. He couldn’t understand no one had cared. He had had nothing to compare Obie to. God, he had to do something but what, what, what?
“Salad stuff?” Pepper laughs and stands up. “Good luck, I’ll speak to Steve in the afternoon to make sure he’s okay.”
On the other hand, Iron Man seems… He seems genuinely interested in the things Steve comes up with. He brings feedback from other fights, gives his opinions about the different area types in the game, is willing to “trial and error” stuff that Steve and him throw together on a whim.
“Goodnight, wife to be.” They both laugh, and Steve squeezes Tony in his arms just a little tighter that night. Just like always, the blond presses a soft kiss into Tony’s soft brunet locks, before closing his eyes and getting some shut-eye.
In the end, Tony had to move his legs, “Ow,” he moved his toes that fell asleep in his shoes, making them wiggle. Steve turned, wrapping an arm around Tony, he pulled him into his chest.
It didn’t quite feel like insulation. It certainly wasn’t just foam. But Steve wasn’t going to rip the walls apart to find that out. The house was… Well, homemade in a sense. If they had used some unconventional material, Steve wasn’t going to mess with that unless it caused problems.
“Ooh! That’s a cool one! I forgot that one was even in the game. Did you know that was one of the first attack power-ups ever created?”
He scrambled away from the wall, almost toppling over the banister in his panic, hitting his midriff in a way that would surely leave a nasty bruise. He couldn’t scream. He couldn’t make a sound or produce a thought. He ran upstairs in a frenzy, got into his bedroom and slammed the door closed.
Tony covered it hastily, “No he- He wouldn’t. He was-” he smiled, “Actually he was the one who saved me.”
“Sometimes, I hoped to get caught, it’s hard out there in winter, or,” he had looked out of the window, then back at Tony, “it used to be. Maybe not so much anymore.”
The goose is waddling around in the open areas of his garage, its little orange feet making cute flapping sounds on concrete. But weirdly enough, it doesn’t seem to be stealing anything. On the contrary, it’s just… Waddling. Around. Hmm...
He had made Steve angry. You have to get used to that, said Tony to himself as he started remote data collection as he changed, knowing you, probably won’t be the last time he’ll be angry at you. Still, it was hard to hear his strained voice directed at him.
Steve had taken his morning coffee and had headed to the porch, trying to familiarize himself with the neighbourhood. He had looked around the little neat rows of houses as he held the scalding mug, no matter how much he wanted to go back inside to the little kitchen table that he knew, to what was familiar. This is your home now, he had said to himself, suck it up, get used to it.
“That’s all Mr Stark. You’ll be hearing from us.” Pepper smiles and stands up to dismiss the rather dreary looking men from the room. They each exit one by one, chattering away, while Pepper maintains her composure till it’s just the two in the room.
Steve insisted on carrying their dishes back on his way. While he was gone and Tony was paying, the cashier woman discreetly leaned towards him, “Look dear, I have known Steve for a long time but if he ever did-” she gestured to his exposed wrist.
“Yeah,” Tony’s heart was beating double time, “I am. Steve,” he pulled back to look into Steve’s eyes, pupils dilated, they only left a thin ring of that sky blue irises, “I’m yours and you’re mine and that’s exactly why I’m going to keep deleting information off of state databases.” He pressed a kiss, very lightly, to Steve’s lips, feeling his hitched breath on his own mouth, “So tell me where you’ve been, baby.”
He’s about to go crazy. Just a little more pacing and thinking and he will be intellectually stunted forever, only being able to think about Steve Rogers.
“Steve,” Tony snuck up a hand through his embrace, caressing his rough cheek, “I’m okay, I’m alright, I- I couldn’t talk in the house, I was- Obie could-”
And Tony was sure there was a reason for that. He just wasn’t sure if he wanted to hear that reason or not.
So he had killed again, or at least got his hands bloody somehow. Tony wanted to shake his head. Not- Not because of what he did. But really, Steve was going around with blood on his hands. He knew from the files that he couldn’t really catch anything himself, but Tony wondered how he hadn’t gotten caught yet with all his recklessness. Impulsiveness. I am here now, he wanted to say, I will protect you. There is not one piece of evidence that I cannot destroy. Instead he chewed on his sweet pastry.
They stand there for a moment. Just holding hands and looking at each other with smiling eyes. But it’s okay. Tony thinks it is. Yes, they had lost many good sausages and possibly half of the frittata muffins but his relationship is intact. And that is all that matters.
He continued, his voice shaky, “I had nothing to lose. Before you. I- Now, the thought of them touching a strand of your hair makes me want to bash their skulls in, God. Tony, now that I have you, I cannot lose you. That’s,” he kissed Tony’s cheek lightly, a complete contradiction to the vice of his arms around him, “that’s the only thing that scares me in the entire world.”
Steve blushes. Well, at least his character can’t. It’s- Nice. That Iron Man paid attention to his fighting style to realize that the layout was deliberate. It was nice to be seen like that.
He heard the legs of the chair scraping the ground as Steve clenched his hands. Tony shushed him, hands back in his hair.
Steve opened him up slowly. Slicked his fingers with too much lube and laid his head on Tony’s ass, elevated by a pillow and watching as he slowly pushed his fingers in. Pulled at the rim. Caressed his insides. He ran his wet, hot fingertips down Tony’s balls and cock lightly then up again, pouring more lube right into his hole and plunging back in.
Steve learns it’s Jarvis who controls Iron Man when Tony cannot. They talk about the intricacies of coding something like Jarvis. Or Tony talks about it and Steve listens. They talk about art. They talk about how much Tony doesn’t get art. Steve goes on a lecture about how much art means for games. And it’s good.
“Are you asking me? I’m going to try to kill you, I cannot be trusted. Take the Hand, Runes are heavy.”
“I- Yeah, I’m here.” Lies. Steve’s head is definitely at five different places. “I guess I’m a little… Surprised? I didn’t expect you to remember- I mean, I do have a good set up. Don’t worry about my back. And about the design thing, I was truly confused when you used that rock. I didn’t know it was that obscure though. By the way, I really didn’t think about that rock...” Steve trails off.
“Tony,” Steve looked at him with his trademark Come On Now expression, so, okay, maybe this was Steve, “what was I supposed to do? Leave him there in the supermarket?”
His hands tore on the splinters. His skin ripped. His hand caught a particularly long piece of wood panel. He pulled.
What he doesn’t expect is this chain of events: Steve asks Dum-E to bring him a fork. Dum-E, being the absolute fucking dummy that it is, grabs the foot-long carving fork from the drawer. Steve panics. Dum-E panics. Then Tony panics.
Obie had barged into his room the moment he was awake, voice booming. His cheer felt fake. Tony had flinched at his touch but his discomfort at Obie touching him had been mistaken as surprise, thankfully.
He shoots and Steve rolls to dodge. Behind the rock is one of the crates he placed himself. He wonders how much this banter causes Iron Man to get distracted but also, he wants to hear what he’s thinking, genuinely.
Toy bristled. Okay, he was convincing maybe but he wasn’t going to let down his guard so quickly, “Look, I am the one who makes questionable impulsive decisions in this relationship, not Steve, so let’s give up the act real quick-”
It was the same pattern as the previous nights. Little steps, carefully placed with uneven gaps in between. Almost careful. Almost calculating.
He crumpled down onto the kitchen tiles whole body shaking. In some corner of his mind, he knew come morning, he would be angry at himself, thinking this was the most ridiculous shit to ever happen to him. He would have cursed his own mind, his easily addled brain, his endless vulnerability in the face of an Omega, despite being mentioned only in passing.
He looked around the room with its weirdly placed columns and haphazardly hung wallpaper. He could make it in here. In the memory of the ones who tried to build that dream from scratch, only to abandon it in the hands of a stranger.
He wasn’t going to do that. Oh no. Wouldn’t be the first illegal thing he turned a blind eye to. Luckily, Tony Stark with an impulsive plan was a Tony Stark in his element.
Steve isn’t able to beat Iron Man. He likes to think he got close but still. The thing is, it’s easy to talk to Iron Man. Mostly because Iron Man likes the sound of his own voice but it’s somehow not bothersome and he just fills in the quiet. So Steve gets a lot of bits and pieces of information out of him. But it’s also very distracting when it comes to fighting against him.
The main room was lived in. Steve had put everything in here, not bothering to fill up the other two rooms. The unmade bed, now with a proper frame that had drawers, covered the most area. Tony threw his jacket and laptop bag onto it. The small study table was at the foot of it, long side looking to the windows, with notebooks neatly piled.
How long until someone from the Stone’s end realized Obie fiddled with the evidence? That Tony fiddled with evidence? How long until someone tracked it back to him? It wouldn’t take much time for the truth to come out after someone realized he had dug up old files from decades ago. The government would get involved. How long? How long?
The smell of green grass in the morning tickled his abused nose. He got away from the door. Got off the porch. Laid down on the damp grass.
Stone looked up at him. For a second he looked like he was about to say something. Tony, without hesitation, lifted the meat cleaver and buried it right in the middle of his forehead.
Steve nodded mutely once again, looking at the thick paper that covered the walls, creased in some places. He could remodel to his heart’s content once everything was done.
Frankly, this is not the most ridiculous situation he ever found himself in. It’s big, what Steve kept from him. That’s true. It’s a lot to take in at the moment. Not the fact that Steve is the Crown Prince but the fact that he has cat ears and cat mannerisms and cat appetite. Which all should have been very clear since the first moment but Tony is the dumbest genius that ever walked the earth and he just never-
When he crouched down to press the glass onto Tony’s lips, they remained tightly sealed. His eyes didn’t open either.
“It’s not selfish. Steve, I’m here and fuck- He- Obie relocated the files of- The security footage from the first night. He knows. I mean, I don’t know if he knows it’s me but he knows something, Steve I-”
“I’m not worried about myself,” Steve lifted his head up to look at him, his eyes were bleary, the anger was drained out of them, “I’m just-” He cut off, crawling up a little to give Tony a slow kiss, licking at his lips lightly, “You know what I’m worried about. If they wanted you out of the company once, they won’t stop now because their first plan backfired.”
Funnily enough, once they are basically in-game civilians, going around beside TheCaptain is what gives Iron Man, oh sorry, DiscountIronGuy, enough credibility. Even funnier, apparently Iron Man hadn’t realized just how well known Steve’s handle is. But that doesn’t save them from the in-game chat.
“I would like to draw you again one day,” Steve whispered into his ear as they were nodding off, “you’re so beautiful, always.”
They both sit in silence for a second as Steve realizes he can actually do many things with this information. Then the NDA appears in front of him. Steve clicks “I accept,” after barely skimming it.
Tony sat up in bed and pulled his laptop bag to himself. If he was going to wait, at least he could be useful while he waited. Opening his interpreter, he got to work.
He looks after the waddling white bum, slowly disappearing in the distance. Oh well, he has other screwdrivers.
Here, it felt a little bit disrespectful, subconsciously, taping up his sketches on someone else’s walls carelessly.
Now, Tony from a couple years ago had been more, uncontrollably impulsive. He would have bought a goat, stuck a red bow on its head and three days later gone crazy because he had no idea what to do with a goat. Nevermind the fact that goats cannot live indoors. They had just confirmed that.
Tony, in some corner of his mind knew that Ty relayed information about their whereabouts to Obie but he had never thought to be suspicious of that. Of them knowing each other and Obie accepting their relationship so quickly.
“I’m not too sure. Sometime this week and to be fair, they might pick him up from the vet too. We haven’t talked about the details yet. He is like a- An eating goat, I mean, not for eating, they eat weeds from people’s farms to help the cleaning process or something,” Steve followed the goat with his eyes as it licked and prodded things, “So they cannot work all the time and this entire thing set the owners a little back so… Yeah, I don’t really know.”
All Tony could do was return the sentiment, “Me too baby, Steve,” he panted, “anything baby, for you, anything.”
Tony smiles, “Like I needed a competition to tell me that.” He loops his arms around Steve’s shoulders, “Think I bagged the win a long time ago.”
“I mean it would but, anyway, the compiler I made for that is trash now. That’s sad. But I’m working on a new one, the interpreter doesn’t even feel forced, would you believe it, making shit up is easier than trying to stick other people’s shit together and hope it would work, no offence but I have special make-shit-up powers,” Tony wiggled his brows over his coffee cup.
“Are you there Captain? Hello! You seem online still. This wouldn’t be the first time someone rage quitted to be honest but you didn’t seem like-”
Well, Pepper had been the one who handled everything from the beginning so she already knew but still. He deserved some credit for improving from his past duty shirking ways.
Everything that made Steve an Alpha in his prime was screaming at him, standing in attention to the cues of an Omega in distress.
Steve shook. Adrenaline coursed through him. His eyes burned with unshed tears. Bile came all the way up to his throat, stinging but he pushed it back. His ribs hurt where he had flung himself onto the banister, pain pulsing with every breath he took.
They had met at some kind of half-official function. Tony had been desperate to shake off the business people droning around him and had walked out onto a balcony he thought to be empty.
His friends from MIT had slowly disappeared, he only saw people from the same business circle and then Ty had appeared. After Ty was just… Ty.
“But your- Your weirdness was never a turn-off Steve. You’re weird? I’m weird! Do you know how many of my dates just got up and left because I- Well, I can’t remember what I talked about in any of those occasions, probably something tech related but- I mean, you listened to a lecture about Dum-E! And it was a lecture, really, I shouldn’t have talked for that long, I’m still sorry-”
And after ten years, he still felt compelled to rub his hands over them whenever he took his crown off at the end of the day.
Tony puts his hands over his ears and squeezes his eyes shut, “Don’t spoil it!!” He kisses Steve again and wipes away Steve’s own tears. “I won’t be going as Captain America’s wife. I will not.”
He had gotten to experience that, a hug. Not for sex, not for photos and appearances. Just, held. And he couldn’t remember that. Just his luck.
“Sure,” Steve ran a hand through Tony’s hair as he put the marker between the pages with his other, “where to?”
Tony smiles and looks up, “Of course, I just had an idea,” he says, taking a sip of his ridiculously expensive champagne. If Steve asks the price, he’d bump it down a few hundred.
The bloody shoulder seeped into his shirt. His own hands left barely there pink drops on Tony’s skin.
Dark eyes met his for a fleeting second before being tightly closed again. It almost seemed like the Omega was bracing himself.
Depressed, he kept on walking on the little trail of mushrooms. Of course no changeling wanted to be his consort. Why would anyone leave their life in this beautiful forest, comfortable and protected, and turn into a human to deal with councils, grain reports and threat of war?
He turned, burying his face into the pillows. Steve had slept here. Giddy, he took a deep breath, trying to find his smell in the sheets.
It was funny, looking through women’s forums about how cool water and ammonia would take blood out of sheets and fill up a tub with water to soak two different recently dead men’s clothes while his boyfriend, who was a legendary war hero, dismembered and bagged up one of them downstairs. Funny how easy it was to get hospital grade disinfectants over the internet and get them delivered to their door.
Steve perked up as the tree shook once more, as if someone was fiddling with the branches. They did have incidents with baubles before. One memorable time, Thor had superglued little jelly dicks onto the tree, claiming that his research on human customs yielded the result that phallic forms were used throughout history to represent prosperity. The poor tree still had bald spots left from that day.
Steve Rogers the artist. The polite, kind, attractive, whose angelic aura enticed even that little white beast of hell and he’s just so-
“What was that doll??” Steve crowds up behind him, placing his hands, strategically, on Tony’s waist, his lips ghosting Tony’s neck,  “somethin’ about,” the shell of his ear, “proving something to me.”
The worst part is, Iron Man doesn’t stop talking. It had been what threw Steve off for the first half of the fight. Iron Man doesn’t seem to have pre-existing dialogue. He responds to Steve.
“But really,” Steve continues, “I didn’t have many friends growing up. Well, I basically just had one single friend. We’re still friends. It’s cool. But I also like being able to jump into the game and chat with people who just know my gaming persona. And that’s… Freeing, I guess. Oh look! A Skrull basecamp, I’m sure we can steamroll it.”
In the end he comes up with an extremely personalized boss arena. He’s aware that for someone who plays differently, the gaming experience in this home baked arena would be pretty shitty. But hell, he hasn’t been given any instructions.
Just when he is about to fall asleep, he realizes. Iron Man really did hit him with a hexagonal beam. He made something. Huh. Shit.
So Tony had taken a trip into Obie’s files along with the hospital and whatnot; and had found the security camera footage that somehow never made into any of the official files. It showed Ty being beaten to death, there had been no clear view of the assaulter’s front, just his incredibly broad back and his forearm that had flexed as it came up and down with ferocity above Ty’s body, skin breaking with each hit before finally coming up bloody, splattering the dark liquid around.
Tony could recognize the cut of the pants he wore that day, the collar of the shirt. Steve had drawn him, first his silhouette, then gradually more and more in detail. Laying on the mattress that he woke up, scared and disoriented.
Steve peeked discreetly from the entryway of the communal floor, trying to see where the rustling noise was coming from. Clint, he assumed, trying to get a glimpse of what other people bought for everyone else to get an idea. He was always the last one to buy gifts and Steve had his theories about why. Or maybe, someone was placing gifts in secret at night.
Steve continues to eat his food, it drives Tony absolutely crazy not knowing what Steve is thinking, he knows he can’t lose. It’s mathematically and probably impossible for him to lose. He’s brought this point up before, but he can’t help but wonder if Steve likes the food he’s prepared. Steve always made him feel weird and soft inside, he made him care about things Tony hasn’t thought two moments about.
It hadn’t been love at first sight for them, but the best love stories aren’t. It hadn’t been easy either, for some reason, their frustration, their feelings, had developed into something neither of them had expected. With them, it was always comfortable, it was easy, and there was definitely passion, both of them had promised to give each other their all. Tony had been scared, relationships were hard, things with Pepper had fizzled, and he desperately didn’t want that with Steve.
After that was a frenzy of coding and reading and more coding. Thanking Howard for his well documented obsessions of the first time and then more coding.
Tony pulled them both into the bathroom, turned on the tap with one hand for water to warm up. Steve flinched at the sudden sound of water sloshing down. Tony shushed him.
It tore through the wallpaper. Layers upon layers of thick, heavy wallpaper divided with foam. Wood underneath it splintered. The walls, the middle of the walls were hollow.
He steps into the elevator, “JARVIS, we have some work, pull up recipes for somethin’ you think Steve might like.”
“Yeah, well, don’t really worry about it. I’m not- I mean, we’re not really expecting you to work for us. Unless you’d want to. I mean I’d need- We’d need your portfolio but it could be done. Anyway, I was just wondering what you’d come up with. Not for like, adding it into the game. But that can be done! If you want, I mean,” Iron Man sighs, “What I’m trying to say is that I genuinely didn’t use my brain when I added that map maker into your menu.”
Tony laughs again, this time, his head thrown back as he hears Steve’s words, “I can most definitely cook, it’s you that can’t. Remember Milan? Breakfast was terrible.”
Tony couldn’t remember the last time someone held him like this, no other motive but to hold him close. Other than Steve, he could remember no one.
Steve pressed in a nail, without hitting, to gauge the layers. The nail pierced through the wall paper. And then some. Half of a thick, long cement wall nail was embedded in the layers of soft material until it hit something solid.
The Stark building is imposing. There is no other way to describe it. The security guard helps him scan the barcode that came with his confirmation email at the turnstiles and points him to the reception.
He kicked a little toadstool mushroom that had come loose from the ground. He wouldn’t be able to become a king like this. But then again, what changeling would want to be his consort. He wasn’t supposed to be king yet anyway. Not yet. He was young and dumb and liked his cogs and gears a little too much; and the worst was, he was hot-headed and didn’t understand strategy. At all.
“Well, I started working here,” Steve goes over the statement Miss Potts prepared for them, for the millionth time, “After we started working together, we got close.”
Steve laughs at that, “You can literally have anything you want and it’s unfair that I get some crates? Come on! They don’t even respawn, I need to ration them.”
Tony’s mind immediately went to the image of his bent, bruised, vomit covered form; he couldn’t help the giggle that escaped in his disbelief.
They opened the boxes. Tony insisted on calling an assembly crew. Steve insisted he’d do it himself.
Obviously, livestock veterinary care couldn’t be found in the city, or in any city, Tony assumed, so they called in a professional in at a ridiculously high price but at least Steve was happy and no longer wringing his hands, going on and on about blocked bowels. Oh, also the entire common area now smelt like a medieval barn and the goat had made a sizeable dent in the salt lamp.
He doesn’t have any classes on Friday. And that’s just even worse. There is nothing to take his mind off of the upcoming interview. He doesn’t even want to look at the desktop icon of The Avengers. So he just makes tea, sits in trepidation while it gets cold. Then makes another tea. Then makes another tea.
Steve pressed his face into his shoulder as he came to himself, stilling in his ass, his breath was laboured, “Sweetheart, Tony, can I?”
“When?!” Tony cannot name the emotions going through him. One side of him is devastated. The other can understand, logically, why Steve didn’t immediately want to tell him that he was the Crown Prince but he can understand.
Steve continues, “I just thought this one would fall apart like my previous relationships. Bucky- He sets me up with people all the time. Sometimes it turns out they just wanted to climb higher on the social ladder. Sometimes it’s the political ladder,” he gestures broadly, “and that’s just even worse!”
Thinking of it, it is a bit weird for them to call him to the main tower for an art job interview. Wouldn’t Stark Industries have a separate studio building for the gaming side of the things?
Tiberius Stone had planned this. Had planned this so meticulously, so insidiously. Had built this house with the gaps and secret passages in mind. For one reason only.
He wanted to run his hands all over Steve, over his chest, from his wide shoulders to his biceps. But not like this, not now. He needs me, Tony thought, he needs me to help him now.
Everyone who worked at the mansion reported to Obie. This wasn’t even supposed to be his house, didn’t he have a penthouse somewhere in New York. But he had slowly moved himself in, asserting more of himself into Tony’s life. Pulling himself like a divider in between Tony and Stark Industries.
They make their way down to the conference room, and Tony pulls his best puppy eyes, “Take me out of here.”
Steve turned his face slightly to kiss his palm, “Yeah, I know. But I feel like it’s time. Time for us to get out there, take some responsibility. I feel like- I have a feeling this won’t be the last time the world will need us to be present, you know.”
They laid like that as they came down, Steve still half splayed over Tony, still sucking whatever skin he could reach and Tony playing with the frankly ridiculous amount of come soaking through his clothes, rubbing it into his skin.
Iron Man doesn’t let up, “Why would you lie about having scoliosis. I- You know what? Alright, here you go.”
His character design stuff left from the art school days don’t really fit The Avengers’ style or aesthetic. There are some unrelated videogame-y stuff he has done as personal projects but they just feel… Uninspired.
Tony had been at the edge of a mad panic the entire evening. He hadn’t been able to sleep. He sat up all night, opened up every single work file, every single notepad to computer program he had ever set aside, had given up on. I have to be useful, went through his head, I have to be.
“Hm,” Steve says, the questioning lilt in Iron Man’s voice doesn’t give him much confidence. Still, his character spawns dutifully in the bossfight arena.
“And no one will question me disappearing because…” Tony took a big step back aligning himself with the island counter, Stone followed him in.
Iron Man comes “alive”- or more like online, at specific hours every day. Only a single player can fight him at one time. There is a waiting list. Every fight goes different. Every fight Iron Man has different tactics, different dialogues; sometimes even different visuals, making his hitbox larger or smaller.
Tony had no idea how Steve found any purchase at all with his spread knees when he started to fuck him in earnest. Steve didn’t lift off of him. Instead he put his forearms to the either sides of Tony’s shoulders and pressed against him completely. Only his hips moved methodically, fucking into him in short but slow strokes.
“It’s delicious.” Tony takes a sip of his wine, while waiting for Steve to sit down as he dishes out a portion for them both. “I hope you like it.”
“But the +4 shield,” Steve rolled his shoulders, “How do you know people would be interested in, like, things I make? Like I’m sure Stark Industries gets like, hundreds of portfolios every week.”
Tony’s brain didn’t seem to click. He had been wondering. But wondering and hearing the truth so plainly were different things. One part of him wanted to reject the thought still. Obie knew.
He dropped his head onto his color changing keyboard. He had bought the thing as a joke while in MIT. Okay maybe he had bought it because he wanted to seem like he was enthused about at least some things in life. RBG lights didn’t cure depression, so what. At least it looked cool.
Ten thousand possibilities go through Tony’s head. Had he heard someone coming? Worse, had someone seen him already? Had something happened to him? He felt panic creeping in.
“That’s… Also a surprise. But it will just be the two of us, not, like, not a grand gesture, I mean, public and all.”
It’s just that after a year of dating, you just want to run your hand through your significant other’s hair once. Just once. One single time.
Obie had used his you have a responsibility voice and maybe Tony was being paranoid but now that he had Steve.
With how little he actually talks about himself, it turns into a game of itself for Steve. His own little side quest: Get Iron Man talking.
Iron Man sputters and at that moment Steve has a dawning suspicion that he might not actually be an AI.
Tony hadn’t even known that he had a hair kink. No wait, he hadn’t had one. Until Steve. Until Steve and his stupid little beanies and complete avoidance of taking them off or letting anyone touch his hair.
Unthinkingly, he attacked the wall with his bare hands, ripping and tearing. Wallpaper layers resisted the most, but the wood was softened in the damp air of whatever was in the cavity of the walls.
“Great! I’ll answer one question for every ten gold orbs you get out of me. Now let’s start,” and then without waiting, Iron Man fires.
It was like holding a bag of bones, very stiffly tied together. He clearly favored the shoulder Steve ruined with the hammer. His stomach lurched.
“Ha ha, so funny Cap,” Tony rolled his eyes at him but then gave in, “really though, it’s not like- Okay, it’s not an impulsive thing, like, I have been planning this-”
What had been the procedure really like? What parts of the process he knew? What did he remember? What had changed? What had his connection to the government been like? How was he treated back then?
In the end, by the end of the school day all Steve can think of is going back home, back to his computer and registering to the waiting list for the Iron Man fight again. He can’t let go of it. He just… Can’t.
“But, no, it’s not an offer babe.” He wipes his mouth with his napkin and stands up. “I can cook, I don’t need to prove anything.” Gathering up the rest of the dishes, he heads over to the kitchen and places them into the dishwasher.
“Look,” he said, taking the glass back and dumping it out into the sink, then he turned on the tap, “Tony, look. It’s clean. Tap water. Look.”
There, in the barely foot wide gap in the wall was an Omega male, stick thin and dirty, curled up on the floor, trembling and weeping.
But no Steve had to go and be all hopelessly romantic and embarrassing and overshare. At least he didn’t outright say stuff like your eyes are beautiful or you’re really confident and I don’t know how to talk to you or… Yeah.
So, he will wait and he will follow. Because if there is one thing he knows, it’s that that goose cannot resist the sweet, sweet call of free knick-knacks that are absolutely of no use to it.
As he walked out, the door to the apartment slid open the moment his hand was on the handle. The lock was broken, Tony realized. So he closed it again slowly, listened for anyone else in the hall, then made his way outside.
That is, until the jangling of the chain is dulled by grass and the white feathery bum disappears between someone’s broken garden fence. But not just anyone’s garden fence. Oh no. Because Tony Stark’s life cannot be without drama and complications once, even in a remote little town like this.
Steve had suggested the idea of simple rules, things they would always follow, to make each other happy. After all, they didn’t have an easy relationship, they were Captain America and Iron Man, superheroes and Avengers. To each other, they were boyfriends, great loves, somebody to call home.
Tony closed the compiler and opened a browser instead. His code wasn’t coming together. The vacation thing Obie had said wouldn’t leave his brain alone. But he would deal with all of that later. It was time for some retail therapy.
There is also the fact that Iron Man is a real person who works at Stark Industries and if Steve also worked at Stark Industries and worked on environment design, he would probably become one of those art department people whom Iron Man is in touch with.
“Good,” Tony said, grabbing a handle under the counter, where the cooks kept the knives they rarely used, the big ones, “then no one will question why they never saw you getting out.”
Tony wakes up the next day, refreshed and feeling good. Steve’s arms were right around his waist, “Good morning.” Steve’s reply was a mumble into his shoulder. Tony laughs and strokes his hair carefully, “You want to sleep for a while? Sleep tight.” He sneaks out of bed, and quickly freshens up before heading towards the kitchen and pouring himself a cup of coffee.
Steve loved Christmas time in the tower. It was cozy and… Well, a lot. But without being in excess somehow. Or maybe it would always feel a lot to Steve, tinged with sadness left from the times when no one had enough to make Christmas look like Christmas and the Rogers family has even less. But it only made him cherish it more.
Unfortunately, his reputation had preceded him, even after Tony had chosen a quieter life. Less alcohol, less women, less men, less… Everything.
And frankly, when Steve had kind of adopted the town criminal, the goose, how could he have known that the animal would have… Done this! Out of all things a goose could ever do! This!!
Steve comes back to his house and his incriminating balled up papers, hiding and evading the town people throughout the whole way. And he’s already having a freak-out about just how much he has overshared in what was supposed to be a tiny note saying “Hey, I have your things I think, would you like to pick them up or would you like me to bring them over.”
Tony is left all by himself in front of the door, suddenly feeling disappointed. Well, what did he expect?
Central Park at 7AM was cold as fuck. No one would ever catch Tony outside at this hour. Or out of bed. It was more like bedtime for him, frankly. Tinker in the night, sleep through the morning, breakfast in the afternoon and repeat.
So Tony had hugged him close, the hand, freshly wounded from the keys elevated, laying on his shoulder, bare skin touching from head to toe.
The white gold crown sat heavily on Steve’s head. It was identical to Tony’s yellow gold one. They both had rubies adorning the folds and twists of the precious metals.
“Lunch? I’ve barely made it alive through breakfast,” he throws his hands in the air, emphasising his point, “Somethin’ DUM-E can cook up, so how does an oil-smoothie sound?”
They both bent instinctively towards Tony’s ringing phone as Obie’s name lit up the screen. Cold anxiety coiled in his stomach, leaving no trace of the loving warmth of the day. Tony’s eyes immediately went to Steve, no matter what Steve said about not being worried about him, Tony’s fear was not for himself but him.
He spent his days in the common area, (which, for the other Avengers, now was unofficially relocated to Thor’s living room because of the goatly smells and goatly residues and the goat itself), playing with the goat and feeding the goat and claiming he taught the goat tricks. And Tony had to suck it up if he wanted to see his boyfriend at all who, himself, smelt like a goat.
Both the women smile and laugh at him. “If you weren’t too busy drooling over your boyfriend, you’d know that my girlfriend has an office right outside mine and is my assistant.”
Steve blushed at that, “Yes, and he is making a- Ugh,” he laughed, “A computer that makes his coffee for him.”
Along the kitchen wall, Steve positioned himself. He could hear it now. One step, two steps. Wait. Listen. Just one step until it was right in front of him.
As they say their goodbyes over the audio channel, Steve thinks about the thick portfolio that’s probably still in the mail somewhere in New York and hopes, just hopes really hard.
He lost about a hundred dollars worth of cable and gained one lump on his head. Now exactly a fair trade, if you ask him.
Stone continued, “Mind if I ask how long it would have taken you to drown in your own vomit? Ty and I had a wager going on, you know. I was willing to give you some more time, no lie; but he had said five months tops until you managed to kill yourself. That was before someone caved his face in, of course.”
He checked the premises, using the tail of his shirt to open the doors. The two other rooms were covered in dust, as was expected from an empty flat. He didn’t walk into them, there was nothing in them that he wanted. Tony turned back to the room where the mattress was. Looked at the doorknob, the window latches, anywhere that would require touch. Rubbed clean.
Tony hoped he would understand his discretion and panic once they could talk, without Tony worrying about things going to Obie’s ear.
But it feels good, in some odd way, to experience Iron Man being an actual person because, well, because he makes Steve feel seen. He remembers things Steve told him, brings them back and asks about them. It feels like he cares. For some reason Steve can't quite comprehend that he has caught the eye, or well, ear of Iron Man and now they talk about game design and try to virtually stab each other.
“I don’t know where he went and I don’t know what he planned, but I promise you,” he cupped Tony’s face, running his hand over the matted beard, lightly tipping his face so he would look at Steve, “I promise he is never going to touch you again.”
Steve looks at all the art he spread around his living room floor and sighs. He probably won’t even make it to a preliminary interview. So there is no need for him to get anyone else up in arms about his portfolio, right? Right. Least of all Iron Man.
He reverently placed the notebook back where he found it. Got up, threw himself onto the bed, suddenly restless, wanting Steve to come back soon. He should have thought of a phone that first day. It was ridiculous that Steve didn’t have a way to contact him, now that they had found each other.
Different types of wall material, rocks, tiles, power-up crates, malleable obstacles… It’s a treat; both for his artistic side and gamer side. He recalls details from the one and only match he had with Iron Man. He remembers what he needed and when, he remembers what he could use to his advantage and what felt unnecessary. He leans back and gets to work.
It wasn’t only Obie who could throw money at his problems and make them disappear. He turned off his systems and closed his laptop, Tony knew what he was good for.
Iron Man’s character in the game, his actual playing character, is called “DiscountIronGuy”. He wears game gear that somehow both looks like the Iron Man boss but also like how Iron Man would look if he was dressing from the fantasy equivalent of Goodwill.
Steve closed his eyes, only stopping himself from planting face first in the tacky canvas at the last moment, as he slumped over. You’re projecting, he said to himself, stop projecting.
Inside of the apartment, while clean, was a mess. Tony looked around, trying to work out what box belonged to what furniture. It smelt like stale cardboard inside. Steve, on the other hand, looked a bit overwhelmed, still holding the strap of his duffel bag with one hand, standing at the door.
Steve takes the hefty bag of tools into his hands. Takes a deep breath. Now or never, now or never, he repeats from inside, be brave for yourself for one second.
In response, Steve chuckles and rolls his eyes, “Whatever you say, doll. Do your tastes include paying your chef upwards of fifteen thousand dollars, per month.”
“Tones, that sounds like a dream, but you know Pepper will march right up here and drag her with you. Oh and I’m scared of Natasha, so I don’t want to have my butt kicked by her because we’ve been skipping team meetings.”
So in the end, it had taken his tired-to-the-bone-from-moving brain about three days to realize the mechanic hadn’t been making fun of him when they had been introduced but instead, had been kind of hitting on him. Possibly. Or he is just friendly like that. But Steve is ready to bet the guy had been flirting. With him. Maybe.
He thought, lawyer first. Then a trip to hospital. Then whatever the hell life would throw at them. But hell, Steve was going to find a way.
So Steve being a fucking weirdo instead of him, is something he actually welcomes. And clearly, Steve is soothed by the fact that Tony simply just… Doesn’t care all that much.
Tony is clearly very against the idea, seeing that he’s changing his t-shirt for the fourth time instead of just leaving his house like a normal person.
“Come to bed,” Tony’s muffled sound came from somewhere between the pillows, “stop ogling your crown,” he turned around, opened his arms to the sides, “ogle me instead.”
“Well, I make it,” Tony runs a hand through his hair, “I quit drinking a while ago, like, completely cold turkey, you cannot imagine how much of a businessman’s life is just standing around and drinking when there are hundreds of other people doing the business part for you. Coffee?”
That seemed to shake off whatever had came onto Steve for a second, he lifted his head, incredulous, “He is your godfather?”
He had carried Tony in his arms so carefully and had made sure he didn’t choke or drown and he was Captain America.
Right. So he paces, and thinks maybe he could ask his regulars to ask around and one of them is bound to know Rogers and they can be a middleman to-
Tony rubbed his clammy hands on his pants. He could take Stone but if someone came to check the voices he’d be fucked. If there was anyone in the mansion, at that. Stone was still droning on his villain monologue.
Tony took a deep breath. He couldn’t freak out right now. Freak-out time was over. He had to do something.
It was Captain America. Fucking Captain America that went off the radar way before Tony was born but he didn’t look a day older than thirty and he had killed Ty and he was…
He had hoped for a unicorn. Delicate and shy, white coat gleaming under light streaming through the trees. Or maybe, maybe a centaur! Strong and tall, looming over him. A wolf with thick fur, trotting right beside him, tipping his head up to Tony.
He swung the cleaver with all his strength but Stone caught up to his plan half way. Still, it was clear the moment a gleaming meat cleaver had lodged itself into his forearm to the bone, he had been expecting to be hit by something much duller. He screamed.
Had he been trying to get a rise out of Tony? He found himself over analyzing everything Obie has ever said while laying in bed, waiting for exhaustion to do him in. Thinking about how he was somewhere in the house, right now, or in his own bed, sleeping soundly while knowing very well what Ty did.
Tony cannot remember any other time in which he couldn’t care about sex this much. They hadn’t had any, yes. But that was something Tony had foreseen. That was something he had accepted once Steve had said he wanted to take things slow.
Explain. It was a thrill, even after it happened numerous times, to see Steve and the interest in his eyes. Explain. One word and Tony was ready to take a bullet for this man. No one ever, not even Obie…
“Oh, yeah, sure. Just let me-” Steve disappears back into the house and comes back with his phone, gives a little nod, “Mhm?”
“Baby,” Tony ran his hands up and down Steve’s back as far as he could reach, “Let me go see what they want. Let me find out what they’re up to. Maybe it’s nothing. But if not, we have each other’s back, right?”
He went down to his workshop immediately. Some of the backtracking for Steve’s latest slip up, he had done on his laptop but the hacking and busting, he didn’t want to without his regular security systems. He needed to get to work.
Steve clears his throat, “I will go get your, uh- Tools? Yes. Just a sec-” He disappears behind the door as the goose squeezes inside beside his leg.
"I'm sorry," says Steve, pink all over. "I don't know what came over me, I'm sorry. It won't happen again."
Tony couldn’t get enough of that boyish smile. Steve’s left eye was getting pinker by the second, where he had rubbed his buttery hands onto his face but his eyes sparkled still. He dropped his ice bag that was mostly water now onto the table.
