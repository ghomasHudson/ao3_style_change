Slowly, so slowly, the boy untangled himself from Tony's side and came toward him, a wondering look on his face as he took Howard in, a small smile growing on the boy's face as he reached him. "H-hello! My name is Peter Rogers, nice to meet you!" The blush on the boy's face caused Howard to give am amused chuckle, for Tony used to do the same thing when he was nothing but a small child, the blushing thing, Howard meant.
Steve could only shake in his place, his breath getting faster and faster as a panic attack nearly sink its claws in him; there were a few other gunshots that were heard, causing Steve to whimper as he hid his face in Bucky's neck. Bucky, who was shushing him softly and rushing toward Steve's car, planning on driving them as far away from the supermarket as they can.
"What do you seek from a person who nearly destroyed your world?" Odin asked which made Steven nearly growl at the older man but he contains himself, going to the old man and giving him a good punch on the face won't make everything turn alright.
(See the end of the chapter for
?' wondering why Bucky went out of his way to do that. Pressing his lips tightly, Steve pulled the sheets away, wondering if he needs to have a long talk with Bucky about his habits of living. What Steve saw behind the sheets, made him froze and for all the clothes in his hands to fall on the floor after his hands went lax.
So as Tony said, life with Rogers was a weird one, not because of the screaming that came from his room in the middle of the night, not because of the blood that would paint the mansion's walls came sunset, not the fake (he hoped they were fake) body parts that will be found all around the mansion, and the blood trails and broken windows… no, Tony got used to it after living with the man for two months, he even got used to (no, not Barnes, that man doesn't deserve his respect when he kept glaring at him like a five years old child every time Rogers' gaze turned to the engineer) Bucky always swooning over Rogers every time the man breathed.
"Who's that…?" The pup asked when he finally noticed him; Howard could do nothing but smile at the boy who shies away behind Tony, a flush on the boy's face as he waved a hello toward Howard. The action was sweet and it caused a small smile to take over Howard's face as his eyes took in the family in front of him.
Tony didn't know if he wanted to cry in joy at the thought of someone believing him or whine in pain and fear at the idea of war knocking down on earth's door. "Wait, so you are telling me, that everything Tony just told us was true and not a nightmare, because of the witch's attack last week?" Clint asked slowly, looking divided between worried at the thought of Tony having a meltdown and terrified at the news of Thanos coming to earth.
"You know, all this planning makes me wanna run to the hills." Tony pouts and snuggles into Steve's embrace, gaining a chuckle from the huge man and a kiss on the back of his head. "Are you sure that the two of us can't elope together and end all of this torture?" Tony questioned with a bland tone, scrunching his nose at the different themed wedding invitations that were thrown all around the coffee table.
"Then I am coming right now," Tony said cutting the Beta's next words, he heard the sigh from the end of the line, he said goodbye and shut the phone, turning to see Pepper looking at him with an expecting face. "He found something about him…" Tony replied to Pepper's silent question in daze, which made the Beta squeal in happiness and jump to hug the Omega, slowly a smile took over the Omega's face as he let go of Pepper and rushed upstairs toward his room. "I better get ready Pepper! I will tell you everything tonight!" Tony shouted as he rushed upstairs to change his clothes, as much as he wanted to rush out of the house with his sweatpants and sweater, he knew he couldn't let his first meeting with his son go on like that.
Waking up, Tony grunt and snuggle into the warmth that was surrounding him, hoping against hope that this nightmare was finally over and that he was actually home sleeping. Letting out a sigh, Tony huffed a little, wondering if this crazy dream of meeting an Addams was just that, a crazy dream; a crazy dream that Rhodey and him will laugh over with Pepper and Happy as they gathered on their monthly video calls.
So there was his baby toddling on the boxing ring, looking at Steve like a warrior ready for a battle which made Tony hold his squeals at how adorable his baby was, something that his mother and Angie don't feel ashamed at all to let their squeals out as they looked at the pup wishing for a camera to capture that adorable sight when the bell ringed signaling the round to start, Tony bite his lips and held his hands together praying, and he saw his baby rushing toward the Captain, only to get picked up from underneath his armpits, making everyone's eyes widen in disbelieve at that, and Tony was ready to march for the Captain and fight him for what he did, because how dare he!
Poor Steve! Getting terrorized by Tony!
"In here!" Steven called out as he stood up, shaking his head and sending Nicolaus an amused look; Steven didn't even have to wait that long for the children to break through the tree line, laughing as they raced toward Steven and throw themselves in his arms. "You seem more energetic than you were this morn, why is that?" Steven asked, chuckling when James and Petrus started blabbering at the same time.
"Oh? What did you bring me, Steve?" Tony asked as he took the book, smiling at the Alpha when he ripped the papers to show the book inside, thinking that it was nothing but the manuscript of Steve's next comic and that the man wanted Tony to see it, but when the decorating papers were all gone, Tony froze in his place when he saw that he was holding an album in his hands.
"P-please don't, please let go!" Tony cried out, only to let out a hysterical scream when he felt the knife coming near his belly and giving him a small cut, which did nothing but caused Tony to cry uncontrollably letting out screams and sobs as he tried to push the bigger man off him.
"Papa, Mama, I brought Harley!" Peter's joyful voice made both Steve and Tony break apart to look at the two pups that were running toward them… will it was Peter running toward them while dragging Harley who seemed like he wanted to be anywhere but here, the look on his small face stated that.
But Tony had to be true to himself, it was a beautiful town, if badly named, wide streets and tall, red-painted buildings, with beautiful houses. With so many lakes and rivers running around, that Tony passed through on his long drive, and there are a few running through the town. It will be a beautiful place for his baby to grow up in, and he has enough money from his saving and from his mother that he will be able to live a luxurious life for the rest of his long one with his baby.
So what do you think?
"What? Isn't that what marring an Addams is all about? You killed your husband! You could have divorced him but you didn't, so why are you acting like I just throw holy water at you?" Tony asked furrowing his brows, his ice cream went forgotten as he gazed at the ghost who looked like Tony just told her that everything outside is sunshine and rainbow and that there are no wars and evils in the world.
… and Tony knew deep down that he was lying to himself, because if he did this... if he dared to do this without Steve's consent or the Alpha understanding what Tony was asking then it meant a broken trust… a broken trust that will never be back, just like how him and his father are handling the situation they were in, ignoring and hurting each other, refusing to just sit and talk because the trust was broken, it wasn't there anymore, and they couldn't mend it, it's hard to do so… Tony wondered if he went with this plan of his, would he be another dark history in the Rogers family, just like Steve's ex-mate, someone that they never talked about, but their action ran deep and fractured the family, will Peter return to his old thoughts, looking at every Omega he saw after Tony with distrust and fear? Will Steve look at every Omega like nothing but a potential betrayal and heartbreak? Will Tony prove Sarah right in her thoughts of never trusting an Omega? Will Tony be forgotten and not talked about like how everyone refused to talk about Steve's ex-mate?
Tony Stark. "James! Get your fat ass out of the house this instead or so help me God I will roast you to death!" Winnie snarled loudly, which kinda made Tony jump in surprise and look at the woman like she had grown another head, it was the first time he saw her snap at someone that wasn't one of her children that loved to act like little shit sometimes.
The next time he woke up, his head was killing him more than before, but thankfully the pain in his body seemed to be less than the first time he woke up. Steve let out a distressed whine, his breath was picking up as he remembered that his baby wasn't with him… Morgan wasn't with him!
Everything suddenly became quiet, there was no screaming, there was no laughing, there was no sound of skin slapping against skin and objects… the quiet was as loud as the bloody scream Tony heard just a few seconds ago, Tony could only shake in his place as he cried, Morgan whimpering and whining in his embrace…
"M-my… k-king… stay back I will kill it!" Tyber squeaked as he pushed Anton's horse away and ignoring everyone's warnings and protests in doing that; Tyber defying the order did nothing but cause trouble as Anton's horse let out a loud neigh as it bucked several times, causing Anton to curse as he fell from the beast who decided to run for its life. The commotion caused the white bear to raise its head and sniff the air, the terror and fear taking over as they waited to see what the bear was going to do. The bear though only let out a grunt before turning around to leave, causing everyone to let out a relieved sigh. The relief was short as everyone gasped in horror when they saw an arrow sailing toward the bear, getting stuck in the animal's forelimb; turning to the culprit, they found Tyber holding the bow, his hands shaking as he tried to fire another arrow but failed.
"Is that so?" Tony asked which made Peter nod his head with a happy grin on his face making Tony smile a little at that, turning his face toward his Alpha when he entered the kitchen and saw the Alpha cooking dinner.
Poor Stevie! Poor Peter! Poor Tony! And poor everyone!
"Are you scared because you think we are moving fast or because you are pregnant?" Steve asked, studying how Tony flinches at the second half of the question which gave Steve the answers he needed. "You know this won't be like the last time, do you?" Steve murmured causing Tony to shift and look away from Steve, his hands clenched tightly into fists. "This time you have me, you have our family, and our friends are there too… in the end, the choice is yours, Tony." Steve continued, causing Tony to shudder and wipe under his eyes.
Tony laughed at his father's words, shaking all the while. "You know… when I was a brat, Mom… Mom made me promise her that whatever happens… that whatever you will do, that I will always stay by your side because we are family and family doesn't leave each other behind…" Tony said the words remembering his mother saying them on the night she died, a small but sad smile on her face like she already knows that she and Jarvis wouldn't be back. "And I had to remind myself of that stupid fucking promise, every time I pack my shit ready to run away, I had to remind myself of that promise when I left for MIT because if it was for me I would have never returned to New York again, I had to remind myself of that promise every time Obadiah showed his face trying to convince you to do one of his stupid shitty plans… but you know what? Enough was enough, I am tired of your shit, just leave Howard, please, leave me alone, you already did enough damage as it is." Tony plea with Howard taking a step back when the Alpha opened his mouth, and he ran to his lab, closing the door and refusing to come out even when his father continued to knock on the door for three hours straight pleading with Tony to talk with him, pleading with Tony to listen… the Omega did nothing other than hiding in the lab crying.
So what do you think?
"Oh, don't worry nothing happened just a feud between us that lasted eleven years and me ending it with a punch, besides, that good for nothing Alpha had it coming." Steve said as he went to the kitchen planning on sitting the table for dinner, a smile on his face as he felt Peter tugging his pants pleading with him to tell him how he knew Mr. Stark, which made the Omega give a small smile hoping the sadness in his eyes wasn't showing, but one thought that struck him made him chuckle happily…
Seeing Steve move away from him, that was what unfroze Tony and the Alpha rushed upstairs heart pounding in his chest hoping that he will be able to catch Steve, and he doesn't know, maybe plea with him? But for Steve and his son he will do anything no matter what the consequences will be. He reached the second floor and rushed toward Steve's room, heart pounding in his throat when he saw Steve sitting on the bed with his head in hands causing Tony's hands to shake as he took a step after step toward the Omega until he stood near him, sitting beside him on the bed and pulling the Omega in his arms, holding him tightly. "I am selfish…" Tony said after a while of silence holding Steve tightly in his arms. "I am a mess, but you knew that when you start dating me, I was never a good man, not like you, I am the farthest from anyone you can imagine… but I can't lose you… not you, not Peter, can't… I already did, I lost you for eleven years, and I can't do it again, I can't… I am sorry… you don't know how much I am sorry, how much I hated myself because I know that it's my fault, it will always be my biggest regret, falling for Howard's mind games and not seeing the truth earlier, for letting you and Peter suffer while I was out there making a fool out of myself, I am sorry…" Steve sniffed at Tony's words when he moved Tony feared that the Omega will move away from him, that he will rip himself and push Tony away, but when Steve leaned on him, the Alpha let out a stuttered breath of relief and pulled the Omega toward his body.
Starkad can feel his advisors shifting in their places; Jamti and Magna were on either side of him, their eyes flashing dangerously as they took in Hamar who was a shivering mess, his face and clothes stained with his blood, curtsy of Starkad's rage and the queen protectiveness of Petrus. Everyone was mad, but no one was as mad as Loki, who was screaming threats and promises of pain and death, the only thing keeping him in his place was his brother who was having a strong grip on his shoulder; no one saw Loki like this before, for the Alpha was the picture of calm and collected, and him turning nearly feral on Hamar, informed all of them that the Omega was truly one of their people and that if the news reached king Odin (Loki and Thor's father) about what took a place here, it will not only mean the alliance and friendship between their villages was over, but it also meant war, and Starkad, even if he was sure that his people will win, he was certain that the causalities and deaths that will take them to win will be fatal and crushing.
Anton could only frown and let out an annoying sigh, wanting so much to be in his workshop at the moment and not out here in the cold autumn freezing his hide; fortune was not on his side though, for that wench of an Omega by the name Sunset took to following him wherever he went, trying to either seduce him or convince him of her twisted tale. Up until an hour ago, Anton was enjoying himself in his workshop, making beautiful daggers and accessories (Accessories that he will end up melting and using the metal for a weapon or a shield) everything was doing great, good even. That of course was, until Sunset decided to come knocking on his workshop and invite herself in, touching everything in sight as she tried to giggle and force Anton to part with a necklace or two as a gift.
Because something inside Steven snapped, something ugly reared its head, and then Steven was screaming at the woman with so much hate and pain he bottled down for decades. "What the fuck are you doing here? Didn't you do enough?!" And then followed by so many curses and threats, that the woman was left shaking in the corner, by then everyone rushed to see what Steven was doing and it took Peggy and Natasha to pull him away from the woman before he stabbed her in the eye.
Tony couldn't help but let out a small giggle when Steve picked him up from the floor and walked toward the huge bed in the middle of the room; the two were still kissing as they reached the bed, and Tony couldn't help but purr when Steve put him down and got on top of him.
"Damn, are you two trying to create a baseball team or something?" that was Bucky who seemed to be the first who snapped out of his shock, his exclaim, getting snorts and confused noises from their friends. "Like who would be the Godparents of those munchkins? You know I am not open for that position, right? I can't handle kids, Nuh-uh, buddy, anything but kids, especially the baseball team you seem to go after." Bucky's rant seemed to break the awkward atmosphere that surrounded everyone, getting a laugh and head shakes, as their friends finally gathered themselves enough to give Tony and Steve hard times; the good news though, everyone seemed to be happy for the two of them, just pulling his ears once or twice before they warmed up to the idea of another Rogers kid running around the place and creating problems…
"No funny business, Rogers, or you are going to regret it." Tony hissed in a low voice, putting his hands on Peter's ears in hope of him not hearing his threat, which the pup didn't seem to hear, and that made the Omega relax a little.
"Oh, I don't know your family? Your intentions with my baby? Your past relationships? I will even tell you about me and Joseph if you want! I am sure you will enjoy this story, Steve loves it every time, especially when I reach the part when I kill his father." Serpentine giggled, causing Tony to choke on his ice cream and start coughing like no tomorrow, she did what? She killed her husband? Is she for real? Is this what Steve will do to him when they get married?! "Don't worry! We were already divorced by then; after all, no one raises their hand on their spouse without heavy consequences, especially if one of the spouses was an Addams." Serpentine stated, patting Tony's back gently until his coughing stopped and he could finally breathe.
"I hope that he like me then…" Steve said which made his Alpha leaned on his shoulder while pinching his cheek, making the man grumble and try to pull away from his Alpha with the threat of biting his fingers.
him and not like the usually courting of these days that ended up with a quick fuck and heartbreak on the Omega's side with nothing but a pup for a reminder of broken dreams, no the Alpha was really interested in him… like really, really… for a lifetime really.
"Wha…" Steve murmured, his voice was so faint and hoarse that Steve winced when he heard it; his voice sounded like he spent hours and hours screaming until his voice vanishes into thin air, it was a miracle that Steve was even able to give out that faint sound.
After Starkad was able to make it to Braes's hut, he made sure to leave the queen in Bótey capable hands hoping that the Omega's stubbornness will keep him alive if not for himself, than for his child who probably heard what happened from one of the people who never kept their mouth shut. Starkad remembered how he went to his son, hoping to hold him or at least check how severe his injuries were, but the Alpha only gets his heartbroken when his son shuffled away from him, not even looking him in the eyes, and when he did, he saw the uncertain and pain shining in the pup's eyes like he wasn't sure how to act around Starkad anymore, and that more than ever made him angry partially at himself, but also he was furious at Hamar for had finally done it, he had finally signed his death warrant by attacking his son and the queen.
And to be true to himself Tony had fun, Steve was charming, caring, loving even, and it made Tony flush every time he remembered how the Alpha gave his baby as much attention as he gave him, keeping in mind Peter's happiness as much as Tony. The Omega never had any real date in his life, but Tony think that yesterday was the closest he had to a one, but what really surprised him was Steve's words, how the Alpha gave Tony the freedom to make his choice every step of the way, and it made him happy, it made him happy and he couldn't help but a fantasy about what will happen if he just said 'Yes', he wondered if Steve would have smiled and leaned up to kiss him, and that thought made Tony's face become red at the thought of being kissed by the Alpha after all the Omega was never kissed before, not even Stane kissed him in fear of the Omega biting his tongue off, and it made Tony grateful for that because it meant that he got to enjoy the kissing experience without fear clouding it.
Rhodey called him as soon as he got the news crying about how he was happy for Tony, and how sad he was that Tony didn't tell him the happy news first, and how he wouldn't accept less than being the baby's Godfather. That made Tony laugh happily and the two friends talked happily about the baby and how Tony was doing, Rhodey promised him that he will come home soon for Christmas to see the baby, by the time he Rhodey will come, Tony will be seven months pregnant, so he was happy to get all the help he wants.
"You never changed, ya punk… I missed you, Stevie, we searched for you for so long… Ma, Pa, Becca, and I… we never found you thought the worse…" Bucky's voice cracked as he pulled Steve into another hug which made the Omega gives a choked noise and pulls the Alpha tightly toward him, which made Bucky shake and hide his face in Steve's neck, biting his tongue to hold his snarl as he smelled Stark's scent on Steve… though his heart did break a little as he smelled the scent of tears and pain… and Bucky for the thousand times tried to remind himself that Stark was also a victim of his father's manipulating.
"Please Mama; can Papa stay here tonight, please?" Peter hugged Tony's legs looking at the Omega with big brown eyes, begging the Omega to say yes, that made Tony let out a sigh and look at Steve with a small frown.
"Son of Sarah, I was wondering when you were going to wake up." The woman said in a gentle voice, none existent eyebrow rising as she looked at Steven who was looking at the woman with confusion. "I hope that you knew that you nearly destroy the flow of time with that dangerous stunt you did." She said calmly and Steven had to contain his wince at the accusing he heard in her voice.
"You couldn't…" Steve repeated those words looking at Tony as he did that. "You couldn't?" Bucky looked nervously at Steve who was looking at Tony with a dark look as he parrots those words once again. "Just like how you couldn't tell me the truth… just how you couldn't tell your father to butt out of our life… just how you couldn't man up and tell your parents about us… just like you couldn't search for me to hear the truth out of my own fucking mouth… you couldn't, you couldn't, you couldn't!" Steve ended up screaming which made Tony shiver at that feeling two inches tall in Steve's presence. "That's always your excuse! Nothing new, the same sentence over and over again! Why the fuck did you return Tony?" Steve screamed which made Bucky look behind him and drag both Tony and Steve inside when he saw people stopping to look at the scene that Steve was causing.
Everyone left him alone after that, the only being who stayed by his side was Sara, and Steven was grateful for her, for understanding, for accepting, for trying to help Steven even when Steven had refused her help, but in the end, he accepts it, he accepts her help in forgetting, because if there was one thing that was known Steven was cracking.
All of the Avengers were trying their hardest to make it work one way or another; Peggy was using all of her political connections in hope of them managing to gather as many superheroes to help when the unthinkable will happen. Natasha, Bucky, and Clint were using their connection to gather as much information that will help; be it the whereabouts of a strong Mutant/Hero/Vigilante that will be willing to help, or information about a stray piece of alien's technology. Even Bruce was trying to help, which mainly consist of him calling people he 'Knew' when he was hiding away from S.H.I.E.L.D, and General Ross. Even Tony was working his ass, trying to update all of the Avengers gears and his suits, taking science by lapses to make the impossible possible, in hope of defeating the Mad Titan.
it was the first time someone dared to come into his water without screaming or tricking him to reveal himself. The creature tensed at that thought, his breath stalled in his chest, as he turned his gaze around the lake, studying his land; time passed fast, and the creature relaxed when he didn't see any other one in his land, no one was here other than the smaller boy in the boat.
"Oh, God, are you hurt?" Tony panic when he saw the tears sliding down Harley's face as he starts muttering '
What if Tony managed to answer Steven Rogers's question? What if he managed to say 'No, I am not' before Rogers was dragged away to be killed, would Rogers return back as the creature he was? Or would he move on and go to the afterlife? So many questions, and so many answers, the big problem though, Tony doesn't know the right answer that would abase everyone.
"It seems… it seems that the pup thought that you were sad, so he thought it would be a good idea to go out alone and surprise you by buying you something, you being here for a short time, I am sure you didn't know about the child kidnapping that has been going around Manhattan for three months now." The Omega said which made the Alpha let out a small sigh at that shaking his head while looking at the pup in sadness. "Look… I know it's not my business, and that I will probably insert my foot in my mouth… but the kid loved you, he was so worried about you ever since the two of you moved here from your home, especially about you being sad… so please don't be hard on him he didn't know any better." The Omega said which made the Alpha press his lips into thin line sighing through his nose and closing his eyes trying to collect himself.
Tony hummed happily to himself as he closed the front door, locking it twice to make sure that everything was going to be fine when he will go to his bedroom and enjoy a good night of uninterrupted sleep, that was unless his bladder decided to act first. But first thing first, Tony was going to the kitchen and search for some food; his little Morgan is always hungry this time of the night. Tony was sure that if he searched a little he will find some of Angie's cook in the fridge.
"Well then, I shall be on my way." Thor gave a shy smile, turning back to his friends, hugging them tightly as he bid them goodbyes; the sight filled Steve with sadness. For a long time, Steve wished to have a family just like the Avengers; a family where he and Sara will thrive and be loved back. Seeing the Avengers act like the family they were, made some part of Steve sad and hopeful; Steve hoped that the Avengers considered him a friend and not some burden, maybe then he will be allowed to join their family.
Tony blink his eyes and turned his gaze to the house, a small smile taking over his face when he saw the sunset turning the lake surface into canvases of yellow, oranges, and reds, taking Tony's breath away, the brunette woman cleared her throat making Tony blink and turn to the woman with a sheepish smile and rushed to sit in the passenger's seat, putting his seatbelt on and closing the door behind him. Tony looked across the road at the path leading back to the cabin.
?' as he gazed at his husband with shocked eyes. "What? Did you believe that I didn't know about you and my brother getting it on? How sweet James is on you ever since he came into the house? Give me a break! You act high and mighty but you are willing to sleep with my brother when…" Whatever nonsense Tony was about to say next was cut by the harsh slap Steve gave him, making the Alpha stagger back with wide eyes.
Pepper's frantic voice called out making Tony let out a shaky breath. "My baby is alive, all these years, when I felt him out there, he was really alive I didn't imagine it …" Tony let out a shaky laugh at that… "He is alive." Tony heard Pepper confused shouts, for the first time in six years…
Back in the penthouse, everyone was looking at the place the Omega had gone to before Howard's moan of pain snapped them out. "Dammit Tony, is that your Omega?" Rhodey said as he continued to stare at the place the Omega disappeared too, gazing at his friend who looked star truck at the place the Omega disappeared too.
Steve screamed, trying to break Nebula's hold of him, trying to reach Tony to help him away, use anything even the last of his magic to transport Tony back to Midgard, back where Peter and the Avengers were. When a barely recovered Tony tried to stand on his legs once more, Thanos effortlessly took hold of him and flipped Tony onto his back, and began to brutally beat Tony down with his fists, breaking off more and more of his armor with each strike. Steve knew that Tony was helpless to resist, Steve knew that Tony would have lost if he faced Thanos, Steve knew that earth's villains are not like Thanosm, that compared to Thanos every villain Tony fought was nothing but a child… Steve knew this, and because of him getting involved with Tony, Thanos was targeting his love… Steve should have listened to Sara when she told him not to get involved in mortals affairs.
It went from Gamora pleading with her sister stop to Nebula accusing her sister of abandoning her in Thanos' clutch, and it ended with the two of them fighting like their lives depended on it, more with the intention to kill and not restrain, leaving Steve sick when he heard the sound of skin slapping skin, and bones breaking against harsh blows.
Steve's breath hitched at that… why was he here? He never went to the cemetery anymore, not since entering Tony's room, not since he found calmness in the teen's room, the calmness that made him stop punching the punching bags in the gym braking chain after chain, and ripping the bags in half, not since he starts seeing his therapist, Bruce "I a-am not t-that kind of doctor" Banner who wasn't a shrink, who worked in Maria's hospital, that Steve volunteer in sometimes, but being near the Beta was calming in itself. Steve stood on shaky legs and start running, he runs past the graves, past the dead trees and bushes, and the fogs.
So far, what Bruce was forced to witness, made him thankful that he only gave Tony harsh glares for stealing Steve all to himself; Bruce was thankful that Steve didn't come after him like he did the others. He saw the spider-Nat who made him shiver and squeak; his childhood nightmares coming true as he saw her hiss and squeak and jump at anyone who dared to touch her, still angry that she failed to at least bite Tony and poison him. What Bruce really wanted to forget was the slim Clint, who made him scream himself so loudly he wondered how he didn't wet himself; that was an experience that Bruce wanted to forget even if it meant bleaching his eyes.
"Daddy…?" Peter asked as he took the picture from Steve to look at the messy hair man standing beside his mother, Peter couldn't believe that he was finally seeing his Daddy! His Mommy didn't usually talk about him, and it always made Peter wonder about that but seeing the picture made Peter's heart raced in his chest like he had run all the way home from the park near their house. "Name…?" Peter asked in a small voice which made Steve kiss the back of his head.
"What took you so long?" Bucky snapped as he stood up, his fists clenching tightly; Tony, on the other hand, was so grateful to the other Alpha for asking the question that was running inside his mind since the start, but Tony couldn't voice it because his voice was trapped in his throat refusing to make itself known.
It doesn't matter, not now, not when Fury was left with an Omega who claimed that Tyber was an oath breaker, not when the Alpha had his job to unearth and expose the Stone Clan like how he had wanted to do for years but couldn't because of the stupid elders who decided to believe in Tyber's story. Looking around the place, Fury caught the eyes of Nattalegg, nodding to the Alpha in a way that informed her of his want to talk with her.
It was only a few seconds later before Steve starts chanting, making the hair on Tony's body stand on its ends, he can already predict what was going to happen, and he prayed that nothing bad was going to happen to his poor soul.
"Stevie, are you sure you don't want to come with us tonight?" Sam's calm and gentle voice made Steve raise his head from the bed, already feeling drained and tired just doing that action; Steve only shook his head and let his head fall to the pillow once more, wanting to sleep but unable to do that, the words Bucky sprinkled on him yesterday still looping in his mind, causing Steve to lose himself more and more as he tried to make sense of what's going on with his life. "Steve, please… this is not good for you or the baby, you need to get out and see the world." Sam tried one more time, which only gained him a groan and Steve hiding his head under the blanket, wanting everyone to leave him alone until he gets his mind on the right track.
The hour he spent in that room, was the sadist and happiest one he went through, it remind him of how happy and joyful he was when he moved into this house, how he spent the days and months talking to his baby and waiting for him to be born into this world. By the end of his visit, a decision made itself known, and all the doubts left Tony as went to his husband to tell him about his answer.
This is the timeline of the fic because I think a lot of people got confused...
"T-that's amazing Tony!" His mom was the first to recover, abandoning her chair and hopped (That's the only word that Tony can use to specify what his mother did) to him, drawing him into a strong embrace, cooing and nuzzling him, which turned Tony's face red with embarrassment, how did this even happen? It was only a few moments later that the rest of his family unfroze too, praising him and hugging him tightly, Tony will never admit that he was touched a little at how his family took his side.
Shield Real Estate is easy enough to find, with the town being small and all. Tony parks and removes his gloves, leaving them on the passenger's seat while he brushes his hands through his hair and tries to look slightly presentable. He glances at his reflection in the review mirror and stops trying. His right eye is red and puffy, pushing his eye shut. His hands don't look much better. He lets out a sigh, and hopes for the best, hoping to still have some leftover from the luck that made him able to run away without being caught to help him here, too.
Steve, whose body bends pliantly along Tony's movement, moans loudly, and staring at Tony with wide, submissive eyes; for a while they just stare at each other, their noses brushing together, sharing a vulnerable wordlessness. Their lower stomachs are slippery from pre-cum from Steve's cock that's pressed between their bodies, and Tony slowed down for a bit, concentrating all of his senses on how hot and wet and easy and perfect everything is. They belong together, like this. "You belong to me…" Tony whispered his words to Steve and Steve clench around him in response. A particularly long and demanding thrust cuts of Steve's voice, cutting whatever he was about to say voice.
"We can leave after I heal him," Steve stated, kneeling down to heal Tony, only for Thanos' hand to clutch his shoulder tightly. "If he dies, you will lose your blessing and power," Steve stated with a dark smile, enjoying how Thanos' hand tightened over his shoulder before letting go; Thanos was so delusional, he was delusional to think that the day Steven refused to look at Thor was to bless him, he was so delusional to think that Steve was going to choose him when Tony was not a few feet away from him. But because of Thanos' delusions, Steve would be able to heal his lover before everything become worse.
Steve sighs a little and returned to pack his lover's bag, his fiancé didn't talk about his family, nor home, but when he did, Steve always paid special attention to the Alpha, and from what Steve gathered, Anthony's father was not the kind of a person you will want to be in his presence for more than five seconds, because he either hates you or tolerate you, and it seemed that his fiancé was in the middle of his father's scale which made Anthony want to be as far away from the older Alpha as he can, but for the elderly Alpha to ask Anthony to do the presentation, it meant that he was finally acknowledging his son's hard work, all those sleepless nights Steve will find Anthony in his lab (Which was nothing but a spear room in their apartment) hunching over some machine, working his ass off for his father had finally paid off.
Steve saw how Bucky shifted from foot to foot, and he let out a sigh when he saw his best friend get uncomfortable, as much as Steve wanted to snap at the first person he saw, snapping at Bucky won’t solve anything, and he does need someone to take him to the hospital. “Peter is sick.” Finally admit, causing Bucky to stiff and tense, probably ready to whisk Peter to the hospital. “Can you take us to the hospital, I called his doctor and she said it’s best to be safe than sorry.” Bucky gave Steve a soft encouraging smile, trying to calm him down before he starts fritting.
But what is he to do? What is he to do when the king will soon know about the pregnancy? Will he beat him? The King still has not raised a hand to Steven, only because the Omega kept his head down and did what the man wanted from him, cleaning and cooking and taking care of him and his child. Would he be the reason that Steven lose his unborn? It would be easy for the king to make him lose the babe if he didn't want to raise a hand, he only had to bed and knot him and then pull out while still knotting… it would hurt, it will make Steven hold into his cries of pain as tears trickle down his face, it will make the Omega wish for death as he moans in pain, and hope that the physical and mental pain of pulling a knot will go… but it will do the trick. His body will get rid of the child in his womb, preparing for another one… a child from a strong and capable Alpha… and in a week's time, he will fall in heat, and by then not even Steven can stop that heat if he didn't find the herbs he wanted in time.
Bucky finally ends up getting his life back under control, he finally gets rid of the last reminding of Hydra he has, by getting rid of that arm. He finally decided to move on with his life, by finally asking Sharon out, it was shocking news to everyone, but the two of them worked so well, they were so happy and lived full and happy lives with kids, they are now proud grandparents for a bunch of lively little devils as Tony liked to call them.
"OK, baby, bedtime, Papa is going to stay here with us tonight with Goose, so be on your best behavior." Tony said to the pup as he put him in his bed, he saw from the corner of his eye how Goose nuzzled Steve's cheek before talking her spot on his chest and start purring when Steve lay down on the floor, which made Steve pet her and close his eyes while putting his other arm over his eyes, that made Tony bite his bottom lip as he gets in bed shutting down the lights when he gets comfortable pulling Peter in his arms, the sound of purring from Goose, with the scent of safety from Steve made Tony sleepy, and before he knew it he fell into a deep sleep…
Steve himself didn't know what happened, he mainly wanted to scream at Tony, because the Alpha didn't only pay for their son's treatment and future treatment, but the idiotic Alpha actually opened a bank account for him and Peter with enough money for the two of them to live the high-life and not worry about working anymore, but that wasn't the problem! The problem was that Tony made his bosses fire him! He really should hit the Alpha in the face for that. So after taking the inhaler from the Alpha, he didn't actually know where the Alpha found his inhaler, but after he regains his breath he discovers that in fact, this was not his inhaler. "The fuck Stark, did our chat get in one ear then out of the other! You got me fired from my jobs! This was the exact reason why… AH!" Steve screamed and cursed which made Tony fidget and stand on the sideline waiting until the Omega calms down. "Take this back, I can get on fine on my own." Steve said thrusting the papers at Tony's chest which made the Alpha sigh at that, he should have known that Steve was too proud to accept help.
full of books and toys of all kinds; there was a small floor cushion on one side of the walls, the walls were lined with colorful paintings of dragons, bears, mountains, waterfalls and so much more. Tony could only wow as he walked through the room and pulled the curtains aside, his breath hitched when he saw a window behind it, a window with the most beautiful view of the lake as the sunset was leaving various colors streaking across the water; in the back of his mind, Tony wondered how he didn't notice this window before, especially when it was pointing directly at the lake.
Steve the mean bad husband, only chuckled and leaned down to kiss his cheek, ignoring how Peter screamed 'Eww!' and gaged, while Harley scrunched his nose and gave them a judgmental look. "What Tony meant to say is… in a few more months another family member is going to join us…" That made both Harley and Peter still looking at Tony and Steve with the confused looks (Peter) and blank ones (Harley) which made Tony a little concerned. "Tony is pregnant," Steve said, which made Peter's eyes widen before he squealed, jumping off his seat and rushing toward Tony, taking a mile in a second, giving Tony a little whiplash trying to make sense of what his son was saying.
"There is no need for that, Mr. Rogers; I will be on my way shortly." Mr. Carbonell said making Steve pause a little and look at the older man who was glaring at him it made Steve stand up straight and look at the man with a frown on his face. "The thing is, I came here to ask you to leave my son alone." Mr. Carbonell said making Steve open his mouth in shock.
Steve though, Steve just smile happily and the glow surrounding him get a little brighter, informing Tony that his words were appreciated, which calmed the inventor down a little, he hadn't messed it up, good! "You too…" Steve mumbled shyly, causing Tony to puff his chest a little, so Steve did notice!
Steve let out a choked gasp as he tried to push the man away from him, letting out a scream when he heard a gunshot fearing that something happened to his baby… it was a few seconds later before the big man stopped moving and feel on top of the Omega, which made Steve cough and pushes the man away from him, gasping as he finally was able to gain his breath back, when he looked at the one who saved him, his breath nearly stopped…
"I wanted to ask something from you," Tony said after letting go of Pepper making the older woman wipe her tears and look at the Omega with a happy look. "Would you honor me by accepting the position of a Godmother? It's a hard rule, and you will most likely help me with changing the diapers and-" Tony couldn't continue as he heard Pepper let out a scream of joy and throw herself at him, laughing happily and crying at the same time.
Steven didn't know how long he stayed frozen in his place, but by the time someone dared to touch him, the Omega was going in and out of consciousness.
/Warning/: This chapter contains, cursing, sadness, time skips, shocking news, near mental break down, panic attack, and awesome Peggy Carter! And who knows what! All reviews are appreciated.
Again a short chapter, because I have no time and real life sucks…
"I'm sorry… it was my fault, if only I noticed…" Hearing these words once again, caused Steve to let go of the door handle and lean his head on the door, finally being able to place the voice he heard. "I screw up again, didn't I? I screw up, and you ended up here after I promised you that everything will be OK." Tony's voice cracked as he said those words, and Steve's breath hitched at the hurt and pain he heard waved in Ton's words; the same hurt and pain that festered in Steve's heart since the start, probably even before he had his baby. "Steve was right, I should stop looking to the faraway future and focus on the now; I should focus on the now before I… I…"
Oh, well, that happened and all, at least we catch a glimpse of Steve, right?
"Darling, I told you I will love you for the rest of my-" Steve couldn't continue as Tony put his fingers on Steve's lips gently, shushing him.
Harsh breaths left Steven's lips, his want to find his baby was stronger than any rational thought that wanted to make a presence in his mind. "James…" Steven mutters over and over under his breath, his body growing colder and colder every second that passed, the terror of losing his child dominating his mind.
Steven looked at Thor who was talking to the shop owner with a grin on his face, waving animated stories of Midgard and its heroes, it made Steven wonder if his Thor will ever smile like this again, but he knows that it was just a childish wish, after all, the last time Thor smiled was thirty-five years ago and after the Time Heist… you can say that he lost the ability to feel emotions, it was probably the reason why he left with the guardians, a thing that Steven wouldn't fault the man for doing.
"Well, my present isn't here." Steve said with lips twitching up which caused Tony's smile to slip for a little time before it returned, hoping that no one saw the slip. "But if you follow me…" Steve sing-song as he stood up which made everyone look at one another then at Tony, but the Omega's excitement returned ten volts and he nearly jumped from his seat on the sofa, carrying Peter in his arms when the babe raised his arms, the walk was not short, but not that long either, but when the Omega's crossed his father's lab he paused, not knowing why they were the basement, but he followed the Alpha anyway until they reached a door the farthest away. "Open it." Steve said as he pointed to the door, which made the Omega look at the Alpha, excitement and nervousness warring inside, but Peter was hopping in his arms which gained Tony the confidence to open the door.
After the ceremony ended, it was time for the reception, and Tony had to be honest with himself, meeting the rest of Steve's family was… interesting. He met Wednesday again, and Tony had to say she look as terrifying as she did the first time he met her, and surprise of all surprises, she was a BFF with Serpentine and learned everything from her aunt and mother. Wednesday's brothers were kinda interesting on their own… but their hero-worship and crush on Steve is kinda concerning, but sweet at the same time. As for Gomez and Morticia… Tony can say he could only give a dreamy sigh at how in love the two of them were, even being creepy and all of that, they were so sweet and loyal and should be the role model of every healthy relationship! Looking closely, Tony now knew from where Steve got his charms and romantic side from, and the genius hoped that he and his husband would look like those two when they get older. The rest of Steve's family were fascinated and scary at the same time, Tony was so sure one of two of his guests had run away from the wedding while screaming bloody murder.
Steven felt himself scream in his mother language without realizing it, his voice strong despite the fear shaking him, but he had to give it to himself for his voice made the Iron King stopping in his tracks and then turning around; a frown etched in his features while he looked for the source of the desperate scream.
"I…" Tony's voice cracked, his tears finally start fallen down at the realization that the love of his life was going to die, that Steve was going to die and leave him alone in this world; Steve and Peter were going to leave him alone. It wasn't even fair, it wasn't fair at all, Tony just got his mate and child back, he just got them back; it was so unfair, so unfair losing them not a few months later so unfair!
"Mr. Stark… am hungry." The pup said after the two of them finished their work in the lab, Peter's words made Tony blink and look up from his cleaning.
"It's OK, Tony, he is already falling asleep," Steve said running his hand through the pup's hair getting a sleepy yawn one more. The sight in front of him made Tony let out a small hum tears gathering in his eyes once more, how many times had he imagined his baby looking this happy and content? Too many for him to count, Tony thought and let out a small sob, he felt a gentle hand touching his arm and he turns to see Steve giving him an understanding look, opening his arm for him.
"Peggy Carter, sorry we haven officially met, but I'm sure you have heard of me in passing." The words the woman uttered made Steve's eyes widen a little when the woman's words made sense to him and the Omega realized that Captain America was standing on his front porch… Peter is going to lose his mind when Steve was going to tell him about that, he may even regret going out with Tony, an amusing thought that Steve was going to share with Tony and Peter when they will return.
Getting out of the room, Steve saw Tony waiting for the two of them, he didn't mention the Alpha' puffy eyes, which made him think that the Alpha was grateful for that as he stood up and gave them a strained smile when they reached him. "Baby, I am going to go and talk with the doctor, why don't you stay with Mr. Stark for a little bit?" Steve asked which got him a hesitant nod, which made Steve smile and kisses his son on the forehead while giving the Alpha a pointed look, before going to talk with the doctor.
"He knows more about it then you will ever do, people have hearts, unlike that block of ice in your chest." Tony answered coldly gazing at the Alpha with a blank look. "You know, the day you die, I will wear red and dance on your grave… I hope you have a long miserable and lonely life, Howard because that's the only thing you deserve." With that, the mask snapped shut and Tony used his thrusters and launched himself out of the house, not caring about making another hole in the ceiling, he ignored the shouts and screams behind him.
Steven looked at Tony with a small smile on his face, though the sadness in it made Tony's anger vanish. "I knew you for more than forty years; Tony, beside you, named your AI Jarvis, and nicknamed him J for short." Steven said as he tried to lighten up the mood, which made Tony hum at that.
Part of Tony was wondering why he didn't just go to the lake, part of Tony was sure that if Tony managed to summon the monster, Steven Rogers may answer his questions. If what Angie said was true and that Rogers was also a victim then he wouldn't hurt Tony, he may even answer him, right? Another part, the one that still believed that Steven Rogers would take his Morgan as soon as he saw her hissed at that thought; Tony didn't have it in him to disagree, no one, not even the victims of this town are as innocent as they appeared to be.
"Nothing, just wondering what the fuss is all about," Steve shrugged, which made Bucky sigh but continued with his walk, still latching on Steve's arms, refusing to let it go, Steve didn't even mention how Bucky held his arm more tightly than a few seconds ago.
So what do you think?
"They were close…" Peggy said, a sad smile taking over his face as she lost herself in memories. "Howard, he was over the moon when Maria told him she was a pregnant, God, the man always treated his son like he was a prince, was so overprotective of him, even after Tony presented as an Omega… everyone thought that the man will be angry and humiliated when his son turned out to be an Omega, that's what people in power felt like, like their Omegas children were nothing but a burden, but Howard surprised us all, his love for his son may as well have increased ten volts if that was even possible, and his protectiveness of Tony was legendary… he taught Tony everything the Omega wanted to learn, from engineering to business to everything else the Omega wanted to learn about, Maria, she was always by Howard's side, teaching Tony about music and how to have a healthy relationship with an Alpha, and how to handle life… they were so happy… they died when they were on their way to MIT, they wanted to surprise Tony, the Omega has won a prize not a week ago for creating Dum-E his first Ai… deep down I know that Tony still blames himself for what happened… how were they in your world?" Peggy asked with a smile, already expecting Steve to tell her some happy news like the one she told him, but the man could do nothing but close his eyes and swallow.
Steven looking back at the king who glowered down at Johann as he continued with his pathetic excuses, and Steven took a deep breath as he looked at his son confused and scared expression, giving him a kiss on the forehead and hiding him, he felt Margaret pull him closer toward him and pointing at an exit with her eyes, making Steven give her a sad smile and a head shake, which made the woman pale when she understood Steven's meaning, that caused Margaret to hold on tightly to Steven hoping that her shaking will stop.
Natasha and Sam understood what he went through, they were supportive, and they definitely were pissed at Tony and what he said to Steve; it ended up with Natasha and Tony getting into a screaming match when the Alpha came to collect Steve the next day, hoping that Steve had calmed down a little. Steve still remembered the snarls and hisses his best friend and husband throw at each other, followed by screams and curses and threats; it was only thanks to Sam that the screaming match didn't turn into a brawl with Natasha killing Tony and going to jail for it.
Even as Tony prepared for everything, that didn't stop him from trying to create as many happy memories with his daughter as he can; memories of happiness in the only place Tony never feared to be his true self, that was before he was stabbed in the back by his so-called friends. At the moment, Tony was happy to ignore everything in the world, being content with playing in the garden, running around his toddling baby, and trying to convince her to call him Daddy, something his girl never called him even when she started to talk a week ago. It was probably his ten months old baby being a pain in the butt like when Tony was a child.
It was after so much shouting, so much screaming, excuses thrown in left and right, that everyone was dragged to Shield, with Howard being sent to the medics, it ends with everyone being squeezed in Peggy's office, as much as the office was wide and spacious, it felt like a broom closet from how tense everyone was, Maria Stark was sitting one of the chairs looking on her hands before she stood up and walked to Peggy that was screaming something on the phone, the Omega took the phone and slammed it shut on the table which made everyone turn to her. "Did you know?" The Omega asked with a strong voice, it was a whisper but for everyone, it was like a shout for how silent the room had become. "Did you know about his Omega? About him being a father? Did you know or not?" Maria ends up screaming which made everyone shuffle and back away from the enraged Omega no one wants to be in her sight.
"Did he force you?" Steven finally spoke, his words made Tony furrow his brows but he shook his head because as much as he wanted to blame Rogers, it was as much his fault as it was Rogers. "Does he know?" Steven asked after taking a few breathes to calm down, his words causing Tony to fidget a little.
"Please..." He begged brokenly making Steve hummed non-committal and dragged his other hand over the tense muscles in Tony's back until he relaxed again. "I'm ready." The Omega moaned and pulled their fingers away. Steve lubed his cock with Tony's slick and then held himself steady with one hand while the Omega sank down.
Oh! And we got to know a little about Steven's past! Poor Tony!
With one last glance in Harley's direction, Tony left the room quietly closing the door behind him as he went down, going to the laundry room, and putting Harley's clothes in the washing machine before heading to the kitchen. Tony's lips couldn't help but twitch up when he started hearing Steve and Peter's voices as he went inside the kitchen, no doubt the two of them arguing about Peter's need to wake Harley so the two of them will go and play.
When you see the character talks like this: "Talking" that meant they are Vikings and are talking in Icelandic, the Vikings know the Hydra kingdom's language which is English in this case.
A ping came from the computer, then the AI starts making the same peeping sound with high pitched noise, making Dum-E stop, and lower his head? like he was cocking its head when the AI stopped peeping, Steve saw Dum-E lower his claw to the ground and let out a heartbreaking peep. "I know buddy, I know…" Steve said as he walked toward Dum-E and raises his hand to pet the claw…
"Where is the fun in that? At least this way he would come after me to get revenge, and if that happened, it's justified that I turn it into sashimi." Steve grumbled, making Tony snort and shake his head at that, ignoring how panicked everyone was still around them. Tony was sure that the shark won't show its face in this neck of the woods for the next one hundred years if it could; hell! It would probably bring its gang with it the next time they came around, hoping that they would manage to overpower Steve by dumb luck.
Sam… Sam died heroically in the line of duty in 2030, sacrificing himself to save more than one hundred lives, his life was good, he ends up marrying Darcy and they had a son and a daughter, his teenage son took it on himself to carry his father's legacy of being the next Falcon, Steve visited his Godchildren from time to time, to see how Darcy and them were doing.
The room was tense, no one was brave enough to break the silence, and they could only take what Steven shared with them, such a dark future… "What about you?" Loki finally said which made Steven blink before a harsh smile taking over his face, eyes going distant before they focused on Loki.
… Steve pleaded inside his mind, begging and begging whoever was listening to help Tony…
(See the end of the chapter for
"Where… 's he?" Peter murmured as he ran his small hand over the picture, his dad looked just like him, he also had brown hair and eyes, but his skin was tan, darker than Peter's pale one, it made Peter wonder why his dad wasn't with him and his mother.
Suddenly there was a loud sound of thunder and a loud thumb behind him causing Steven to turn his head to see who was the creature who dared to make such loud sounds, and his eyes widen when he saw Thor son of Odin, which may as well have been his only way out of here, hopefully, the man was not a fool. "Brother Stark, did you see what caused this great crater?" The man shouted in a frantic voice which made everyone turned their head to the armored man.
"A little bit, I learned it After I met…" Steve swallowed his words, biting his lip once more, scolding himself for nearly slipping and telling his baby about Tony, turning to his son, his heart gave a painful bang as he saw the sad look on the pup's face, that made him swallow and put the rag on the counter before going to his baby and taking a seat before him, making the pup look at him for a little while in wonder. "Your Daddy, he was half Italian." Steve said smiling when he saw Peter's face lighten up at the information. "He used to always blabber in Italian when he was excited or happy which was always, so I didn't understand him that much at first, so I learned Italian." Steve said hidden his chuckle when he saw Peter pouncing in his chair in excitement.
11-Til að koma aftur á jafnvægið milli lífs og dauða verður að greiða skuldina í blóð. Hydra konungur tók; Þess vegna verður það tekið frá honum. En til að láta saklaust fólk borga með blóði sínu fyrir glæpi hans… reiði AllFather verður unnin á sálum ykkar í lífinu á eftir. -To re-establish the balance between life and death, the debt must be paid in blood. The Hydra king took; therefore, it shall be taken from him. But to have innocent people pay with their blood for his crimes… the wrath of the AllFather will be wrought upon your souls in the afterlife.
"Mommy, did you see my picture… oh, hello…" The pup's sound made both Omegas look at the pup that shuffles toward his mother hiding behind him, which made a smile take over Maria's face as she looked at the small pup that was looking at her with a strange look on his face.
As much as Steve wanted to snap at the woman for sticking her nose in people's business, he knows that it will be his head if he did, so he took a deep breath trying to calm himself down. "I love him." Steve said which made the woman look at the Alpha with a strange look on her face before she smiled at the Alpha.
Steve froze in his place when his eyes catch the title on the newspaper when he passed an old man reading it; Steve's breathe hitch a little before trying to blink the shock away, swallowing as he wheeled himself toward the elderly man sitting on the bench. "Excuse me?" Steve called out, his voice breaking a little when the man raised his head and gave Steve a strange look. "C-can I please borrow the newspaper? Just for a few seconds, I will give it back, I swear." Steve asked, pleading note was in his voice, which ended with the old man blink and nods his head hesitantly before giving Steve the newspaper.
Steve wanted to say scream no, that Tony didn't die, that he and his son were finally saved, but he knew someone like Tony wouldn't believe something like that without proof. "Why do you think you are dead?" Steve asked the Omega gently, which made the Omega wet his lips, thinking.
take me, come on, I've been so fucking wet and I want you-" Tony couldn't continue though, because of the hard grind Steve gave, causing him to let out a loud moan.
How are you holding up, Tony? Steven asked, which gained the younger man's attention, and Steven couldn't help but take in Tonys figure, taking in the lovely dark suit he wore, and how put together he always looked. Nostalgia slammed into Steven, reminding him of his late husband.
I will explain this to you in the next chapters.
What Steve didn't realize was the shocked woman he left in his wake, Peggy sit still, trying to make sense of what happened just a minute ago, she then stood and shakily brushed the man's hair off of his face to get a better look, when she studied him closely she discovered that he indeed looked like Steve, but he was… he was older? The only differences were the few laughing lines on his face and the white hairs that were mixed with his blond. But what throws her off was not his age, no, what throws her off was that he smelled like a… a Beta? No, that wasn't right, Peggy leans toward the man's neck and sniffed, she desperately hoped that no one was watching her or they will think she went crazy… the man's scent was full of power… so much power it burdens on insane, it made the hair on the back of her neck stand on its ends, he smelled of lightning, rain, and roses, thinking about it the man smelled like Thor, maybe he was Asgardian? It would explain why he smelled like this after all Thor told her that his people don't have the Alpha/Beta/Omega Dynamic the humans have.
"No, I was reading in the living room before someone broke the window there, when I went to chase them I found this on the porch." Bucky shifted uncomfortably before showing Steve and Tony the picture. Steve's face paled when he saw the picture in Bucky's hand, as for Tony, the Alpha let out an enrage snarl when his eyes fell on the picture.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Maybe I will go with you after I tidy the house, I wanted to see the boathouse in the back and maybe try and collect as much as I can of firewood, if today is as cold as the night before then maybe I should." Tony mumbled which made Natasha raise her head and glare at him, making the teen shiver.
"I did not!" Peter said as he puffed his cheeks and cross his arms over his chest. "My school is out for a month because some idiot eighth graders decided to blow the labs at night, which burn half of the school." Peter said with a pout which made Tony blink at that and hummed.
"Why is Papa angry?" Peter asked as he took his small cup of ice cream from Tony's hand, purring happily when he took the first bite of his chocolate ice cream, the sudden question caused Tony to pause, pursing his lips before he sighed.
Steve took a deep breath as he looked around the place, swallowing when it finally hit him why this room was the only forbidden one in the whole house… a room that held so many promises and heartache… Steve went to Tony, touching the Omega's back gently which only caused the Omega's sobs to become louder, hiding his face in his knees, and Steve knowing the Omega he knows that there was no moving him.
Steve was in a very good mood today, not only because he felt reassure that they will catch whoever was the stalker, thanks to Natasha who Steve knows will catch him with no problem at all; but also because Tony was in the house, and Steve was planning on going out with his husband and having a good time with the man. It had been four months since the two of them had a day to themselves, and Steve was excited to stay with his husband and enjoy a good movie.
Steven had always known about his people way of life before he was taken away from them. They went by many names, but the one that struck fear in people's hearts had been just one: Vikings. Powerful men and women, from Alphas to Omegas, with no discrimination about dynamic or gender. They who worshiped their Gods who were very different from the Christian one he was forced to learning about, and who seemed to really dislike the rival religion, and he won't fault them for that, for the Christians had killed his parents and took him a hostage forcing him into a marriage bending his life forever in the name of their God. He lost the count of how many times he overheard Johann and his advisors discussing the attacks to monasteries or Christian communities in distant kingdoms, or how the Scandinavian pirates seemed to be causing a ruckus at the seas. Was pretty sure that one of Johann's ships had been attacked by Vikings once, and he remembers that Johann had a particularly nasty mood during those days, he remembered the day for it was after his children were born and Johann's decision to kill one of them as revenge on him. Other than that, there was no Vikings that had been seen around Hydra kingdom, seeing that Johann's people were strategically far away from the North where they live.
Steve was angry, he was hurt, he was spiteful, and he hated everyone and everything that continue to trap him in this room. But the most important thing was; Steve was terrified, he was so terrified of everything that happened around him. He was terrified that everyone around him was right all along and Steve was the crazy one in all of this. And maybe Steve was the crazy one, because if he wasn't, then how was Peggy alive when Steve was the one who confirmed her death after seeing her body? If he wasn't crazy then where was Tony? The man hasn't been here not once, nor was there a search or news about a missing husband anywhere… was Steve really making this up? This life with Tony that thinking about it now seemed impossible and out of soap operas kind of things.
; yes, I married him, but he was the one who asked me out, not me, so he wasn't my true
The redhead thought held her position for a moment longer, before stepping back and removing the blade from Johann neck, which made the Alpha released a shuddering breath and clutched his throat. "
Angie comes over to check on them and insists on bringing Tony a second serving, waving off his protests and whine with a glare and a threat. Tony could never go against Angie; he muttered soft thanks as Angie returns with a fresh bowl of broth in one hand and a jug of coffee in the other, setting the bowl down before him and filling his friends' cups. "C'mon, eat up!" Angie patted him on the shoulder. "Get some nutrition in ya, people will start thinking you're the ghost." Angie narrowed her eyes until he took the first bite of his second serving, causing the woman to smile.
… the realization made Steve tears up, feeling like a failure. Steve stood up and start walking, to a specific room, feeling like the weight of the world was crashing him, if he wasn't a coward, none of this would have happened, if he just get himself together after Bucky had died, Tony wouldn't have been here right now, he would have been home, enjoying his life, falling in love, dating, choosing his own mate, and maybe he would have had a pup, instead he was here in the hospital crying and begging the doctors to let him see his pup…
"In your car? Baby, I left the not near the nightstand before I went to work, I know nothing about the note you are talking about." Tony said, shifting nervily in his place, causing Steve's breath to hitch as dread took over him replacing the happy feeling he had.
Also many thanks to my friend Stingray! Without Her, this chapter would have never been written at all!
"Look what I found in the dumpster!" Tony cheered, raising the baby for Steve to see, only for his husband to scrunch his nose at the child, like it was something nasty; Tony won't blame Steve, this was his initial reaction before the little kid bites him.
"What do you think, Tony?" Peggy's gentle voice made Tony snap out of it as he looked at the Alpha that was standing a little bit farther away from the Omega in the hope of not scaring him, Tony blink at that and turn himself in circles, taking in the changes once more.
When he finally reached the HQ, the Omega took a shuddering breath as he gathered himself as much as he could, taking off his Nano-mask and leaving it in the car. He knew that no one would let him in unless they saw his real face. He tried to shove away the discomfort of leaving the car with his real face, hating the fear he was feeling at the thought of a reporter waiting for him around the corner, but the Omega soldiered on, getting out of the car and walking towards the door with a raised head. He tried to stop himself from trembling, wanting to find Steve and hold him, as the past month had been like torture to the Omega, mentally and physically.
Tony blinked as he checked over the house once more before getting out and letting the brunette woman close the door shut and lock it… he was tired and sore, he hasn't slept in over twenty-four hours, ever since he ran away from home, and in all honestly, he needed real food and a bed, hoping to crash for a few hours before returning here, hoping to fix the house and be able to remodel it as best as he can.
"Do you want it to be one?" He asked which made Tony look at his hands, a blush taking over his face as he shrugged his shoulders not knowing what to say. Six and a half years ago, he would have squealed and jumped right into the opportunity to go on a date with Captain America, but this was Steve Rogers he was talking about, the man his pup was attached to. "It's whatever you wanted to be Tony, friends hanging out, or date; it's a choice you need to make on your own." That made Tony nods his head and snuggled under the covers saying good night to the Alpha and pulling his pup, closer to him...
Steve and Tony discuss how to tell the kids about the baby for a few more minutes before leaving the bed, taking turns showering before ordering takeout, not so surprisingly, the kids came running when they saw the delivery man stopping in front of their house, which informed Tony that the kids were not so secretly staking out the house. As always, dinner was a lively affair, with both Harley and Peter trying to steal as many slices of pizza as their stomachs can handle, which did nothing but made Tony concern about sick children come tomorrow.
So what do you think?
Letting out a pained noise, Steve tried to move his hands around, which gained him nothing other than a few twitches of his fingers, causing the Omega to whine lowly in his throat before trying once more. Steve didn't know how long he spent trying to move one of his hands, but it took him too long, that he ended up tired as hell, wanting to return back to sleep and ignore the world. But Steve can't do that, he can't, not until he checks on his baby, that he would allow himself the rest his body desperately wants.
The rest of the day was a blur, a blur that Steve couldn't make a head or a tail of. He just remembered Bucky finally getting him out of the supermarket a few minutes before everything got from bad to worse; worse as in the person who shot the doctor/lab worker, had friends, and with his friends they decided to rob the supermarket, holding everyone inside a hostage.
But what made him bear going to the therapy every week was his baby's happy smile and excited eyes, and Tony's heart starts fluttering like crazy when his son stopped screaming and crying every time he saw a stranger, he even went and talked with the strange Beta 'Carol' who came to visit them one day and latched into Steve's arms complaining that the Alpha never comes to Shield anymore, and didn't train her anymore and that she missed Goose and she squeals two hours straight when she saw Peter and hugged him tightly… Dr. Ross says that the children are incredible survivor, and that in no time, his baby will be all healed and that for Tony to make the process faster he just has to get better himself because children can pick their parents' anxiety, but it made Tony purr in happiness at the thought that his child will be OK in the end.
Peter let out a sob as he clutched the Omega's shirt tightly; taking in big breaths as he tried to calm himself down, but Tony could feel that it wasn't working. "B-bad man… Papa, bad man… used his scary voice…" Peter let out a whimper as he said those words, and the tears that clouded Tony's eyes start falling as the Omega tried to desperately shake his head.
"He was taken from us…" Howard said with hitch breath, it made Steve look at the picture one more time than handing it to Howard who took it and caresses the picture gently. "He is out there… somewhere… I just have to find him, Steve." Howard said with a cracked voice, making Steve put his hand on Howard's shoulder and squeeze gently.
Two of three names that made the smile fall from the Omega's face, his eyes widen as he rushed to read throw the comic, face becoming pale as he looked at the perfect replica of the photos he saw a year and a half ago… the comic book fell from Tony's hands but the Omega didn't pay it any mind, the only thing he could do was stare at his hands with shocked wide eyes…
He wanted to scream, he wanted to curse and yell, and break things. He wanted to pick the phone and call his friends, tell them that he needs them, that he did something stupid, that he needed someone here with him. But the problem he couldn't, Rhodey has enlisted in the army, and no matter what he wanted he couldn't bring himself to bother the older man. Pepper was out there trying to get a job, trying to have a real-life with her fiance Happy, so why would she have time for him. Jarvis was gone, and so was his mother, and his father was not someone you just tell him this kind of things, you never know what the old man will do. And unfortunately, he didn't have many friends or people who will stand to be in his presence for more than a few seconds at any giving time.
"Look at him!" Tony screamed as he got one of the pup's photos from the envelope thrusting it in Howard's face making the Alpha back away avoid looking at the photo. "Why won't you look at him? So it is OK to get rid of him but it's another seeing the person you want to throw away?" Tony let out a sob lowering the photo, his body was shaking and the Omega was trying desperately to hold into his tears because it was one thing to let his father see that he was a few seconds from breaking.
"What happened?" Tony asked, already pressing his lips tightly, holding his baby in his arms when she made grumbling noises and snuggled into his chest, his mind already trying to imagine what happened to someone who everyone in the town thinks nothing but good things of.
"Steve!" Bucky jumped out of his chair and ran toward Steve, pulling him into a tight hug, trying to hide his face in Steve's neck, mainly to stop Steve from noticing his shiny eyes. "Oh my God, why didn't you call me when Steve woke up, Stark?" Bucky glared at his fellow Alpha, causing Tony to give him an innocent smile, which was anything but.
"I will see what I can do, sir." He said making Tony laugh and followed Jarvis to the kitchen. It was half an hour later they heard a crash coming from inside the mansion which made the two froze. "Stay here sir and hide." Said Jarvis standing from the stool taking a kitchen knife with him, Tony moved and went to the landline to call aunt Peggy… the landline wasn't working that made Tony's breath hitches, he has to go to his father's office to get the mobile phone. Tony then jumped as he heard gunshots from upstairs, Jarvis!
Before Steve left the apartment, he put the letter he wrote on the coffee table, as much as Steve hated it, he pleads with Anthony to come and look for him when he was back, he asked him to explain why he sent his father to tell him about who he was, Steve wrote some other stuff too, he couldn't remember them all, but he remembered that he cried while writing that letter, Steve looked at the apartment for one last time before he left and paused a little when his eyes fell on a photo, an old photo that contains Steve and Anthony, they took it on their first vacation as a couple, Anthony had taken him to the beach that day, the two of them were smiling happily while hugging each other.
