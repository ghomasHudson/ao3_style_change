“Oh…”
“No, that’s not what this is all about,” a woman returns. Peter remembers her introducing herself as Heather a little bit earlier. She looks around Natasha’s age, with blonde hair that is put up in a loose tail and brown eyes that give him a kind look. “There are a few of us that
“Here, pal, you need it more than I do,” he tells the man, who stares at him with wide eyes.
“Peter, are you feeling any pain?” Tony asks. He’s reaching his hand forward, feeling Peter’s forehead for a few seconds. Peter shakes his head.
“I’m sorry, Mr. Ross, will this take long?” Sue asks, a little concerned about her dinner plans with Reed. They have reservations, but they’ve cancelled so often lately due to sudden missions and the owners don’t really seem to like them that much anymore.
“Peter, can you tell me what you know about the spiders?”
“Thank you, doctor,” Peter returns. Strange nods at him before turning back towards May and nodding at her as well. After that, he leaves the room. Steve then lets go of Tony’s shoulders and heads towards the door to close it again.
The king pointed to her.“She happened.”
“Rumlow escaped before we managed to capture him. Luckily nobody got hurt… He also seems to have taken up the persona of ‘Crossbones’ or something. It’s what his workers call him.”
- That's about it. Enjoy!
The first thing he reaches out for, ignoring many passwords in the process, is going for the security cameras. Just so he an get a view of the entire building, which comes in rather handing, really, since at least that way he’s prepared when he hears the door open. Immediately he jumps out of sight, letting the suit surround him and putting it on stealth mode. Then he hovers into the air, high enough so that the man entering can’t see him.
“What, the fact that you’ve got a girlfriend?” Tony asks dryly with a raised eyebrow, giving Peter a grin. Steve, too, snorts. “We heard from FRIDAY, who heard it from Karen. It’s not really a secret anymore.”
Because Peter never became Spider-Man, Uncle Ben never died.
,” Steve admits. Peter nods.
“But if I’m honest, I like the red and blue better,” May jokes. “So let’s get this crap off of you and make you back into the Spider-Man we all know, alright?”
“No, no, Johnny’s inside so you can just get in. I’ll be there in maybe twenty minutes or so…”
Natasha closes her mouth. She doesn’t respond otherwise. Tony takes a deep breath.
The Goblin joined up with them. He grabbed Gwen, flew her up to a bell tower of an old church, and threatened to kill her after realizing who Spider-Man was. Trying to talk him down, the Goblin dropped Gwen anyway. Peter managed to catch her with his web, and he secured her while trying to stop the Goblin.
“I’m alright,” he assures him, but not really certain on who he’s trying to kid here. “I just- I wish he wouldn’t have been brought into this mess.”
“Yeah, because it’s so easy to leave me, apparently,” Tony bites back. Peter turns around, pointing a finger Tony’s way.
“Of course, Tony,” Bruce responds to his request. “Let’s bring his stuff to my floor, shall we?”
"Grab a gun and we'll put together a strategy!" he says. The rest of his team nods and hurries to take a weapon. Natasha just rolls her eyes but follows anyway. That's when Tony turns towards his own teammates. He hands Peter his gun before quickly explaining to him how it works.
On the same evening he ended up in a lip-lock with Black Cat?
Peter sighs, allowing May to hook her arm into Peter’s and make him follow Steve and Clint, since they’re about the only ones who know the way. May, feeling like a complete tourist, already has her phone at the ready to take some snapshots. Rhodey and Bruce are walking ahead of them, deep in discussion about old traditional Viking weddings. Peter’s pretty sure Thor’s not a Viking, but he doesn’t really care enough to correct them. Bruce has enough PhD’s to figure that out, he states.
“Forget her, Peter,” the Cat says. Peter hesitates for a short second, but then he pulls himself free. As if he’s just going to forget about MJ. Again, that is. He doesn’t know what has been happening inside his head for the past few days. Has no idea why he feels like he’s been spending more time with the Cat than he can remember. He has no idea of many things, and he knows he’s going to need to talk about this with somebody after this all is over.
FRIDAY suddenly adds without Peter having to ask for it. The teenager hums while leaning back in his chair.
Peter runs and runs, forgetting that he can swing. He goes so fast that he doesn’t even have time to avoid Eddie Brock on the path.
“You’re getting there,” Steve tells him with a wink, and Tony bumps up against him playfully.
“Oh Peter, Peter, Peter,” he sings. “You keep on trying and trying, but you just can’t accept the fact that
“I don’t-“ he doesn’t know what to say, that’s what he’s trying to say. But even that escapes his capabilities.
After making a quick stop in the tower to get some clothes for Peter, Tony personally drives him back to Queens.
And that’s when it happens. At first when all the lights on the ceiling start leaning towards the source. Otto starts typing something on the computer. In the corner of his eyes, Tony can see Peter looking up in surprise, as well. All the women’s jewels start flying off. Their supposedly gold necklaces fly right into the reaction as if a big magnet pulled them along. It’s quickly followed by people’s watches. When Tony’s watch, which contains the gauntlet, comes flying off as well, he figures it’s enough.
“Uh, I’m, uh…” he starts, but even as he fidgets his fingers together, nothing comes out. Peter gives him an unimpressed look, crossing his arms. He’s not angry, but he would still like to pass along the message that they’re making a lot of noise.
When Yaël woke up again, she immediately started puking before she even had the time to look around. Even though there were people around her and she heard them talking, it felt like she wasn’t able to heard what exactly they were saying.
“That’s right,” T’Challa admits. Tony then stands up.
“When did you even get the idea to do this?” he asks. The mischievous smirk on Peter’s face is enough to make Tony realize he probably pulled out the big guns.
Getting so close to the end!
“So… what does it feel like now that Stark knows you’re his son?”
“She’s been dead for a few era’s already,” Yaël answered while scratching her hand. It wasn’t easy to talk about it, as everyone reacted with pity, which Yaël really avoided. Hilde’s mouth fell open, but then it seemed like she made a puzzle in her head.
“So this woman sends you to a complete different planet, just to find me? How did you even manage to do that? There are more than seven billion people on earth!” Nilla straightened her back and casually cracked her fingers. She would’ve been beautiful if she wasn’t so brainwashed and crazy.
“It’s more an ode to all those who weren’t even worthy to get a ‘name’ before they died. That, and I want the Grandmaster to know that I made the thing that is too big to get removed in a few days, the thing that will force him to cancel coming arena fights, the thing that will shimmer in his eyes as soon as the sun touches it.“
“We need to fix this!”
“What’s wrong?” Steve asks, looking confused. When it looks like James isn’t going to answer, he turns to Sam. Sam, who isn’t looking at Natasha at all, and who can’t see her warning glare.
Great, Pepper’s pissed off. Tony squeezes his eyes shut and presses his hands against his eyes.
“No, I’m not calling him when Dad’s around. That would be a crap move,” Peter tells him, taking the phone and putting it back on the desk. A short look around and he sees Dum-E is rolling back from the little kitchenette to bring him a bottle of water. “Now I’m going to stretch my legs for a bit, just put the water on the desk.”
He opens the window like he always does.
“I don’t know how I could deserve a son like you,” Tony admits. Peter snorts.
“What, what’s wrong?” Johnny asks, worriedly. Peter just points at the buttons of the floors.
Natasha, who seemed to be getting closer to Bruce. Sitting at the sidelines, Steve was having a full view of seeing whatever was going on there blooming. She would join them the most, leaning over Bruce’s shoulder and pointing at his screen while he tried to explain to her what he was doing.
“Looks like we’re both hopeless when it comes to the matters of the heart,” Natasha answers. Tony wonders what she means with that, but he already knows that asking will earn him nothing but silence and more questions, still. She’s probably talking about a time before they met her.
“Your temperature is normal, are you feeling alright?” she asks.
Tony bites his lips together when he sees Wade look up at Steve, suddenly jumping up and down in excitement. Steve shakes a bit with the movement, but he, too, seems amused. It’s really a testament to the guy’s patience.
Of course, there’s always a thorough background check for every kid that has come in there so far, and of all the twenty that have asked for a scholarship, he’s only had to refuse three of them who quite obviously came from wealthy enough descend to pay for the education themselves. Tony’s not an idiot, and he’s aware that most parents just tell their kids to try it, but there are certain rules to it that even he has to follow, no matter how much he might like said kid’s attitude.
“Uh, thanks, dad?” Peter says nervously, not even bothering to tell him not to tinker around with his stuff anymore; he knows it’s no use. Tony doesn’t say anything, only shortly passing his eyes over Peter’s half-naked state before letting it roll over to Ned standing there, looking star struck. While he’s met Tony before in the past two months, he keeps on getting speechless around him.
“Not yet,” he says with a smirk. Right after that, the door opens and a guard walks in. Where Peter would have expected for Steve to pull away and pretend nothing happened, the Super Soldier remains where he was.
“There are surprisingly few words coming out of your mouth right now,” the familiar voice of Natasha Romanoff says from behind him. “I’m kind of impressed, really.”
- Peter has been traumatized. After Gwen's death he lost close to everybody he loved except for May, and that even at just a young age (some would think that would make a kid grow up faster, but that's just not always the case). It's also why he always calls him 'The Goblin' instead of Harry, because he knows that's not his friend, and that he's somewhere in there behind the evil persona. Peter's a kid who can't think rationally anymore. If it isn't panic attacks, it's the strong urge to make things right again; his goal is to get Harry back. Harry Osborn, one little remaining thing of Peter's past before (most of) the crap happens. (small spoiler for a few chapters later in the story: Harry's been there when Peter's parents died, he's been his friend when nobody else would. Then he was sent away, and Peter was left alone.)
“Well, I was approached by one of their agents. Asked me if I wanted to get back in. They’ll give me a clean slate, making it as if I never left SHIELD,” she says. Tony reaches to take a drink, but one look at the wine-glass makes him change his mind. He shouldn’t be drinking.
Peter hangs up without waiting for an answer. To be really honest, he can’t really be bothered with his Dad’s problems. The guy needs to fix his own problems, much like Peter is taking care of his own.
Tony shakes his head. “But you don’t want children,” he states. Steve looks up, startled, with eyes wide. “We’ve dealt with this issue; I wanted kids. You didn’t. But it’s alright, because we have Peter. And he’s not a kid, but he’s
“Okay,” he says. Peter gives it a short thought before putting a hand on the younger boy’s shoulder.
And Peter starts explaining his plan to his friend in the middle of being thrown into Venom once again. Harry’s pulled off his glider once or twice, but he always climbs right back up. Felicia and MJ are nowhere to be seen, which is a good thing. What was the girl even thinking, coming back here when she’s hurt the way she is!
“I might not be the biggest fan of Peter putting his life on the line, but I’m sure that with an Uncle like Steve no harm could come to him,” Mary jokes as she guides them inside the building. There are only a few people still inside, most of them on their way back home. The receptionist who got stuck with the evening shift looks like she’s about ready to head back to bed.
“Just- don’t say anything,” he mutters out. He turns back towards the door to Peter’s room, hating the fact that he can’t see anything in there. He can hear more footsteps coming up from behind him. It’s probably Rhodey, Nat or Bucky. Or anyone, really. Tony can’t think at all.
Yaël stood up and walked to her bed. “But… my file says nothing about Europe?” Yaël took the file and looked at that one page they had given her. It actually didn’t mention where she came from. “Weird…” Yaël mumbled.
the things he discussed with Dr. Wynedell two days earlier.
Wanda jokes.
What he understands, too, is that he can’t really force it to turn, either.
Tony gives Rhodey a wink before he closes the box with the suitcase in it, lets the armor surround him once more, and flies up in the air.
Peter looks at her, but suddenly feels unable to answer. Because he can’t remember ever really kissing her other than that first time right before he got together with MJ.
“Yaël, how marvellous to see you here alive and well! Where did Loki kidnap you from this time?” Thor huffed, slapping her on her shoulder, hard enough to make her lose her breath. Heck, the man was missing an eye and it looked gross as fuck. Yaël cocked her eyebrow sarcastically.
“Your hilarious, Stark,” Steve muttered. “What’s the plan, then?”
Steve raised an eyebrow, but couldn’t help the smile that ran over his face. He stood up and took the empty plates to the sink. Yaël helped him.
“Yeah yeah, I can’t bring home more than one girl,” Johnny complains while rolling his eyes. “I already know, don’t remind me of it all the time.”
“Dad?”
- Absolutely no mention about Harry, I'm sorry about that :'(
“You know, when I programmed you I probably added a little bit too much of sarcasm. Maybe I should take some back?” he threatens her.
If he’s going to, at least. After that fight, he wouldn’t put it past him to just decide and head to sleep himself.
,” FRIDAY adds in. Peter and Wanda start laughing, but Tony just groans.
With the sunlight shining right into the workshop, Peter notices immediately that there’s something missing. Or rather, someone…
We are young
“How about that? Penis Parker?” Flash asks. His friends agree in laughter, and Flash is smiling that ugly smile of his. Peter wonders what he ever did to Flash to make him hate him so much, but he figures Flash just picks out his favorite victims and works from there on out.
While Tony returns to help Rhodey with his revalidation, Peter usually arrives there, feeling like he’s somewhere he doesn’t belong. After all, Wanda’s gone. Steve’s gone. Clint’s gone. Even Yaël has freaking disappeared overnight, never letting him know anything about it other than leaving a letter saying ‘
He’s never had money to run out of. Never had to worry about having food in the fridge, having a bed to sleep in. He never even had to worry about his parents, because they barely seemed to worry about him.
Once it’s on, he surfs a bit on the internet, tries out a few of the games Tony must have installed for him, but eventually
“Fair enough. What do you want, though? For me to create complete bullshit like a toaster? Don’t you guys remember the reaction we got when the Starkbucks came out?”
“You promise you’ll be good, here? No forbidden drunken parties or anything?”
to keep everything to herself. Would it be really that bad if she knew?
“Yeah, and that’s the problem. Because when Peter’s fifteen one of those spiders is going to bite him which will give him special powers.”
inside. Sigh, this guy is going to keep on popping up from everywhere, is he?
,” FRIDAY says all of the sudden. Tony sighs, and Natasha picks up her phone. Peter then decides to just emerge from the hallway as if he’s just walking in. His father’s distraction helps with his innocent act.
Peter’s not sure how to feel about this. Should he be angry that Johnny left without saying anything? Or should he be glad that Johnny respected the fact that Peter’s already having too much shit to deal with lately?
“Hey! Don’t be a jerk, Rogers!” Tony quickly yells at him. Then Steve, without warning, lifts Tony up from the ground and throws him over his shoulder. Tony starts to kick his legs (gently) in an attempt to break free, but he’s unsuccessful.
“Here, you should do the honors,” Mr. Stark suddenly says, handing the pincer to Peter.
shouldn’t be a reason to stop you from dropping buildings on kids.”
“Yeah, no…I accidentally stomped on him on the bridge. I just felt so guilty, I’ve been carrying him around the entire time.” Brunnhildesubtly put her hand over her mouth to cover her disgust. Even Yaël felt her stomach turning. How wasn’t the whole spaceship covered in a corpse-stank yet?
fits you the best, no?”
“I suppose it’s to bring up some family tradition Mr. Stark never had before,” Vision admits. Peter laughs again. After that they continue in silence, hearing a low murmur between Bruce and Tony. He could focus on what they’re saying, but he doesn’t really feel like invading their privacy.
“We’ll see,” Steve whispers back.
It’s May now, and there’s only a few more weeks to go until the school year ends. The teachers are all droning on about the finals, and how they should prepare themselves in these last few lessons they’ll have. Peter tries not to think about it too much. Only barely has he managed to get his grades back up with all the extra credit work and the internship. He doesn’t want to think about the fact that everything might still have been for nothing because of him failing his tests.
After Steve, too, has taken place, a pleasant silence has come up. While Steve looks up the news on the tablet, Tony goes through whatever FRIDAY has found on the Black Cat. After ten minutes of this, Tony puts down his phone and starts looking at Steve, only to find out the super soldier has been having the same idea. The time of reddened cheeks are far behind them now, so Tony just grins and reaches out his hand, allowing Steve to put his above it.
“Uh, and what’s good about that?” he asks in confusion. That’s when the two soldier suddenly start laughing over the laughing track in the sitcom the two are currently watching. As the crowd on TV finds amusement in whatever happened on the screen, the two soldiers seem unable to hold back their tears as they put their hands on their stomachs and try to keep it in, only failing at it.
Peter falls asleep again after Dr. Cho’s nurse injected some more painkillers. As he closes his eyes, he still has his aunt and his father holding his hands, and a smile on his lips.
Tony offers him a smile, and then reaches out to put a hand behind Peter’s neck.
“Say, Steve, you think the Avengers are up for a night-mission?” Tony asks suddenly. Steve doesn’t turn around while he prepares some eggs.
And to make it worse, Mr. Toomes insists on driving them, apparently going out of town anyway. If that isn’t enough indication that something is wrong, Peter doesn’t know.
She leans forward to kiss his forehead before pulling him towards her, into a strong hug. Tony lets out a soft sob before nodding in agreement. Of course she’s right. She’s always right.
“Listen, Eddie, I don’t know why you suddenly hate me so much but-“
Suddenly, Peter stops. His eyes are glued to that spot above him, but his mind has come to a sudden stop. He’s been in this kind of situation before. It didn’t work out well, and he’s sure it’s not going to work out well this time, either. He’s not at the top of his game; he’s lost a lot of strength and speed now that the black suit is gone. His senses are dulled because of the past few days. He’s alone, his body tired, and because of his failure MJ is going to die.
They don’t even get a day before Tony is called away again. Only barely caught up on sleep, he comes with the news that he’s called away to Berlin. When Peter asks what’s up, all Tony does it put up the TV where a news channel is showing a live feed of something happening in Vienna.
know him? The guy owns pretty much everything here, comes on the news practically every day.” Well, it still didn’t ring a bell and there was a reason for that.
“I’ll, uh, open the door for her,” Peter starts. May hums in agreement. “Tell her she looks nice but not too much ‘cause that’s creepy.”
The next few days, after X’s phone call, Yaël lived in pure coldness. The sneezing, coughing and shivering drove her nuts.
“There you go,” Yaël mumbled as she tried not to step on the unconscious bodies while searching for keys. The more keys they had, the quicker they could release the prisoners instead of fiddling with the locks for too long.
A few taxis passed them. Yaël saw one, clearly driving over the speed-limits, before it stopped in front of them with screeching tires. The driver opened the passenger-door from inside and… WADE?! Why was he driving a taxi?
The moment he’s outside, Peter’s already back into his uniform, swinging from building to building in just a matter of seconds. His backpack is still over his shoulders, and his eyes are glued to the ground as he inspects everything that is happening here.
“I know now. I heard the thing’s thoughts while it possessed me.” She lets out a cough. “I guess I was a bit of a fool to believe you would ever choose me over MJ.”
“I’ll teach you, just follow my lead,” he answers, before pulling Steve along on the dancefloor, but staying on the side. It’s time to dance to the swing of the music.
Tony gets out, and Peter starts laughing. Just as he writes down the answer to his exercise, the school bell lets out a loud ring to indicate that it’s time.
“Hello, are you alright?” she asks curiously.
- Violence against my boy Peter
“NO WAY! You get to help him with the Iron Man suit? Which number is he at, now?” Ned interrupts him enthusiastically. Both Peter and Michelle turn to look at him, Michelle annoyed while Peter is more shocked. He has
Another chill passes through Tony; he’s practically naked underneath the sheets with Steve Rogers… Who would ever have thought?
“And that friend of yours? You said she’s been living with the Avengers now? How’s that working out?”
“We did save the judge’s daughter, remember?” Clint throws in, repeating what he said earlier. Tony ignores it as he stares at Steve in front of him. Then he jumps up, grabbing Steve by the tie and pulling him towards him. Sharing a strong kiss, literally
Light surrounds them without warning. Pieces of dust and small bits of rock fall on them, but Steve is quick enough to pull up his shield and hold it above their heads. Tony makes himself small against him, finally taking in the fresh air of the open. The smell of dust gets old after a while.
“Jim is home, he stayed with the dog. He’ll help you find them,” she quickly assures him. Tony nods, getting himself back to Bruce and poking him in the side.
Of course, the former case of her trying to comfort a student might also just be the reason for their avoidance of her, remembering how she suggested one of the kids to listen to some song she found online, causing for the kid to now have an immense fixation on Norse culture. The kid actually even switched into an ancient Norse religion despite the knowledge that the Norse Gods are nothing but Aliens, as well.
Mystique and Scott nod, while Yaël hesitates for a moment longer.
“How have I been?” Tony asks. “You know,
“I don’t know, he sort of fell from the sky.” Yaël remembered sudden bright light in the middle of the night and out of the blue this man had been knocking on her door.
- Tony can't really handle being stronger
upon seeing her since all she does is glare at him. Even now she’s giving him her death-stare.
“Honey, it’s alright,” Tony assures him. “We’ll just order some pizza, okay?”
“Hey, I understand it,” Felicia says. “I know what it’s like to have everybody leave, but you know what helps me through the day?”
Feeling tired all over his body, Peter curses internally as he digs into his closet in search for the suit. He feels guilty for having forgotten about it in the past few weeks. The mask looking at him like it’s blaming him for being forgotten the entire time. Peter shakes his head, deciding to best just get the show on the road.
“They weren’t with five,” she whispers out with fear in her eyes.
“Let them through,” he breathes out. The two brats never call him unless they need his help with something. Immediately, on his tablet, the familiar image of Deadpool and Johnny appear. The two look a bit… freaked out? Worry rises immediately inside of Tony.
“We should get back inside,” Steve points out. He’s holding out his hand in Tony’s direction, but the other man is just looking at the ground, unmoving. That’s what usually happens whenever Tony is reminded of the Infinity War. The burning smell, the ashes covering his hands. He’s not even aware that he’s practically punching his chest until Steve grabs his hands.
“You know, I was thinking…”
They’re seated next to Peter, who is sitting next to MJ. Then, there’s Johnny and Yaël, who are sharing a bowl of popcorn and end up laughing at every scary scene in the movie. They might be ruining a bit, but it helps as well. Peter quickly realizes that he doesn’t really like scary movies. On the last couch, Wanda and Vision are seated. Though they don’t seem to react on the movie all too much, there are a few times where Peter catches Wanda grabbing Vision’s hand without saying a word.
“Because I was pissed? Still am, actually…”
His ear has been against a phone almost all day when Steve was brought in; mostly Tony talking to the guys on top to keep Steve and the others a clear name. He even dared to bring up Barnes, but he’s got no high hopes for his fate.
Of course, not that he’s ever going to admit that.
“Yo, miss Space!”
“Then why didn’t my sister come with us?” Yaël felt like she knew the answers to all of her own questions, but she wanted him to tell it to her. She wanted to hear everything, so she was sure she wasn’t imagining stuff, even though he was just a part of her dream.
Ned throws him a ball and Miles catches it – with his face. Sputtering out a muffled curse, Miles rubs his slightly painful cheek and throws Ned a small glare, only to get a wide grin in return.
“Tony, are you alright?” Sharon asks, putting down her knife and fork and adjusting herself in her seat. Tony blinks a few times before looking to the side, seeing a few empty chairs around them, but only two that matter.
“Hey come on now, don’t start fighting over me again, guys!”
Okay, so the first week, Peter thought it was normal; sure, the guy might be abroad to take care of some business. Or maybe there’s some Avengers-business to take care of? Some evil bad guy far away that they need to take care of, first.
Something made a sweeping sound behind her and before she could turn around, Lopt jumped out of nowhere onto the guards and eliminated them with just one smooth slash. His stealth looked mythical, inhuman, just like the grace and elegance he moved with. A soon as everyone was down, he picked up a shovel and started scooped the dirt away, also faster and with more strength than any human or Helvegian would be able off.
"Sweet love, my oldest friend
Aunt May is surprised when Peter gets home, since he’s earlier than usual. Peter doesn’t want to explain what happened, so he just keeps it with ‘Tony wasn’t feeling too well,’ and leaves it at that. Aunt May doesn’t ask any questions, luckily.
Damn, she should give that girl a call.
“No shit! If Peter hadn’t felt the danger beforehand, we would have been dead!” Ned adds to that, still a bit out of breath. Tony pulls back at last, giving Peter a good look to inspect for wounds.
! They even assaulted Ned on the streets in the evening!-“
Chapter warnings
Sorry for the delay again. The story's almost finished!
Peter doesn’t seem too sure about that; Harry already escaped twice. He’s crafty enough, always waiting for the right opportunity.
So after almost an hour of getting the kid to come back down with Bruce’s help, Tony feels about ready to get back to sleep. It helps a lot that Peter is such a well-behaved kid, really. Other than constantly wanting to climb the walls, he listens quite well to what Tony or Bruce tell him.
after all. They may not be related by blood, but the guy’s basically Tony’s brother. Instead, Tony receives a grin from the soldier and a wink. A hidden way for them to wish each other luck – though it’s not
“But he wants to!” Yaël countered.
Nat are rare already, so if one of those gets taken from me, I would be pretty pissed, too.”
Really, it’s a wonder there aren’t any little Storms wandering around already.
“No, we haven’t. Though we were going to if you hadn’t woken up an hour from now,” she says. When there’s a sudden knock on the door, everybody turns to look at it as it opens. There, Bruce’s face suddenly shows up. There’s obvious relief when he sees Tony awake, lying in bed.
Steve hums a bit in thought. "I think he said something about a picture directly on paper?" he offers.
The video ends, and Tony feels like his heart stopped for a moment. That was Peter, at the end. Five-year-old, little Peter, who didn’t know anything about what was happening. Whose life hadn’t already fallen apart around him.
“Only for a little while, until we catch him,” Steve assures him. Tony takes the mask off his head and drops it down on the desk before standing up. Then he takes his cup of coffee and starts walking towards the window to have a good look outside. Spring is trying to show, but the last bit of winter is still making an effort to make itself known. It’s not yet weather for t-shirts or shorts, but at least the sun is shining again.
“I should’ve killed you on Helvegen when I had the chance, back when you were just a little child. I could’ve known that you’d be more like your mother than Nilla is.”
“Oh, eh, hi!” Peter calls out nervously. He hasn’t spoken to her since that one morning he refuses to think about. Not only is the idea of him sleeping with his friend unsettling, but also the thought that this girl is much older than him (she explained that, while she appears 23 years old, she’s actually over a hundred already).
“Good morning, Dad,” Peter says with his mouth full. “How was your night?”
- A parent losing their kid
“How many?” he asks, almost sounding deadly, reminding him a bit of Natasha during a mission.
“I’m probably going to regret this,” she mutters as she reaches towards the door. Opening it, she gestures for Tony to get inside.
The doctors check him for a little while. There’s another blood sample, a look into his eyes and a quick check in his mouth. After that, they make sure his vitals are alright before they leave him alone again in the room.
The team is nearly nothing like it used to be. There’s Clint having taken in a young girl Peter’s age (Tony thinks her name is Kate) who appears to be just as skilled at archery as him (he calls her his ward, which is just ridiculous but at the same time
She wasn’t mad about that, though, she could use some sleep. On her bedside table stood a bottle of painkillers, waiting for her. At first, Yaël was a bit headstrong and was sure that she could fall asleep without those. But as soon as she laid down everything hurt again. So badly, that it seemed the injuries were never taken care of. Dr. Cho had warned her that because of the many hours her wounds had been exposed to so much filth and bacteria, some of the wounds could stay infected for a little time. Yaël grabbed the bottle of painkillers with one hand and screwed it open.
“Kid, are you alright?” Cap suddenly asks. Peter opens his eyes again, not realizing that he’s closed them, and looks back towards the Super Soldier next to him. Peter holds up his hand to give him a thumb’s up.
And suddenly the roles are reversed, and Steve is towering above Tony, worshipping the engineer’s chest in such an adoration that makes Tony once again melt on the spot. All too soon, things are starting to get extremely tight in his pants. Every part of him tells him to stop right now.
“Yeah, sure, they’re always constantly worried anyway,” Peter mutters. He gets on his feet and nods towards the door. “Hey, pal, care to help me on this search party?”
“FRI, can you call Ned?” Peter asks.
me to join the Avengers…? Just like that? Just like parents don’t let their kids do drama or football because they don’t agree with it?” Peter huffs out a breath, unable to look Steve
There’s no robberies, nor any muggings. Even after half an hour of just wandering around and listening to everything that his happening around him, he finds that there’s not much action at all. He’s about ready to head back home, still, when he suddenly finds a group of teens on the street.
“Besides, Peter is here tonight. And while the walls are sound proof, I don’t really want him to walk in on us.”
The suit, having been put in the closet for a long while, feels a bit stiff after being locked away for such a long time. It takes a few stretching moves to loosen it up a bit. Putting on the mask gives Peter another strange sense of relief. He’s missed being Spider-Man, and he knows he’ll have his work cut out for him tonight; after all, a hiatus of two and half weeks is enough to give the criminals a feeling of security on the streets – which in turns gives the people a feeling of
Tony quickly tells FRIDAY.
FRIDAY returns. “
After a little chitchat with the couple, Yaël left and walked back home. While walking, she kept staring at her phone. Calling him wouldn’t hurt her, right? She searched his number through the extremely small list on her phone, being:
“Yes, Odin’s first born, legally the one who had a right to claim the throne. Of course, she was awful so nobody wanted her as a queen. Thor went to face her, and Brunnhilde couldn’t defeat Hela’s huge wolf so I went back down. After that, I woke up here. Whatever happened in between, I have no idea. I’m actually even surprised I’m still here.”
Peter takes a few careful steps forward. He’s got no idea where to look, but the doors have small little viewing glasses. One by one, Peter gives a look through them, finding only empty rooms.
“We need to leave!”
“Yeah, just my head going a bit in overdrive again. I’m trying to see what the progress is downstairs.”
“What are you doing?” Mary asks.
- drunk Peter
“Whatever I did, I’m sure I had my reasons,” Tony responds automatically. “Now go and be a pretty-boy somewhere else, Storm.”
“I was perfectly fine with you being the loser, Parker,” Eddy grunts out. He throws another punch, but Peter evades it easily, jumping out of Eddie’s hold by crawling down, sliding between his legs and jumping back up. Eddie looks confused for a second before he turns around to face him again. “I felt enough pleasure at knowing your life was miserable even more than mine was.”
“Hi, Nerds,” she greets them, pretending not to notice Harry after that. Peter and Ned just wave at her. She pokes her fork into her spinach without seeming to want to eat it. “Have you heard the news on Stark? He seems to be in critical condition.”
“I need to take this,” he almost yells, jumping out of his seat to get into the hallway. Not bothering to look who’s calling, he puts the device against his ear and clears his throat.
“What? Did he want you to get objectified?” he frowned.
“Goodnight, Tony.”
Out of all the heroes that wander around in New York, Aunt May seems to have two that stand out in particular; while she dislikes Mr. Stark the most – though she won’t really explain why – it seems like he adores Captain America with all her heart. If it would have been that easy, Peter would even have arranged a meet-and-greet with him. Perhaps he should ask her the next time he’s at the facility.
“What?” Loki and Yaël hissed simultaneously.
“Don’t worry, pal! I’ll drink with you,” he says with a wink.
“NOW JOHNNY!” he shouts. Or he thinks he does. He’s not sure about that at all. He doesn’t hear himself. Even when the machine is supposed to be turned off, Peter’s ears are still pretty much ringing. All he can do is watch how Johnny flames up and starts circling around Venom, putting him into a prison made of fire. The circle he forms around him becomes smaller and smaller, until there’s about no more space for Venom to move.
“He had some other matters to attend to, regarding that friend of yours. They get along pretty well, I suppose,” Tony mutters. Peter feels his cheeks heat up again at the vague mention of Yaël, but Tony can’t see it, luckily. So, yeah, that’s going to be awkward for a little while…
“I, uh, right now I’m kind of alright,” he says. The man nods, and the other two doctors start writing things down. When the nurse, Lisa, enters the room as well, she throws him a big smile and a thumb’s up. Dr. Palmer, meanwhile, walks up to him and pulls out a stethoscope, pressing it against Tony’s chest and asking him to take a few deep breaths.
“Don’t sweat it, Wilson told me all about it. I suppose I should have warned you about her little crush on you before she assaulted those perfect lips with hers,” Tony assures him. Then he lets the gauntlet of his suit pull away, letting his bare hand into the cold air of the hallway. Without hesitation, he leans forward to rest his fingers onto Steve’s cheek.
But the problem is… he doesn’t really know what result he’s looking forward to mostly.
“Look, you’re stuck anyway. Why won’t you just tell me what going on there on that bloody planet?”
“It wasn’t even yours to begin with, now come, astronaut.” The woman turned around and walked out the door with straight back, taking big steps. Yaël quickly jumped off her chair and almost tripped in the hurry, ignoring the fact that she had already went through some kind of breakdown after pushing her body too far with too much training and way too little food to fuel herself not that long ago.
“So, you eventually got yourself a date for today or not?” she asks playfully. Steve’s words fall short, and he realizes he can’t come up with anything. When he turns towards Tony, he finds the jerk looking at them in amusement.
New York, only from a very high view one can only get from Stark Tower.
“Nah, but life would be boring otherwise. Do you have news on Nilla?”
Holy crap, what did he do?
“No, because in the end we both didn’t really know what exactly Harry Osborn
After all, there’s a whole new suit waiting for Peter back in the Compound. And he might not get it as quickly as Tony had been expecting, but one day he will wear it.
The moment the bell indicates that the hour is over, Peter stands up while already grabbing his phone. He thinks of typing Francis’ number, but then he realizes the guy probably isn’t working right now, usually going for the evenings at the tower. He doesn’t even have any other numbers, except for…
“I’ve been thinking.”
“Oh, come on!” Yaël didn’t even recognize her own voice anymore as she screamed out her frustration.
“Yeah uh, thanks for letting me use this,” Peter mutters out, not really able to grasp what’s happening. The girl nods once before starting to walk off again. Meanwhile, Peter takes a good look around him, staring up in the sky in search for Stark Tower anywhere near.
“I’m sure the two of you will make up for that after the wedding,” Tony mutters.
MJ turns back to him, her dark, greenish-brown eyes looking right into his. Just, for a small moment, Peter almost expects her to lean forward for a kiss. But there’s still a slight disappointment when she doesn’t. Instead, she just studies him, suddenly reaching her hand towards his hair and passing her fingers through them.
Toomes nods nervously, rubbing his painful wrist, his face red. He looks genuinely scared. Good, that’s what Steve was aiming for.
Bruce joins Tony. Steve goes alone. Everybody who has a suit is suited up. Bruce just gets some firearms meant for stunning as well. Peter and Mantis are headed to the apartment first to pick up Peter’s uniform. His
“Stark! Did he give you anything on Rogers?” the man asks.
“I didn’t mean to intrude but you know me, I’m a rather curious person,” Tony says while leaning against his partner. He’s only
“A-positive,” Peter answers. “I’m AB, though I wouldn’t have been able to donate either way.”
“Save everything under a new file. Call it ‘Bleeding Edge’,” he says, naming the first thing that comes to mind.
“Let me take a look,” he says. Peter pulls away with a chuckle.
“Did Steve also tell you I cheated on my girlfriend without really knowing it?”
Seeing the screens that come with the tubes, Tony frowns. With slow steps, the three of them move forward. Now that he’s closer, he sees that they’re heart-monitors, showing the heart-function. Only, this one is flatlining. And the other one, too. And the other one…
“And the worst part about it all is to find out that FRIDAY can’t even track you anymore! What if something would have happened, and we couldn’t find you? I didn’t put in that tracker to stalk you, Peter! I would only use it for emergencies!”
security.
“Uh, nothing, look; I- it’s just the Academic Decathlon. No big deal!”
“It’s okay,” Tony said dryly, not at all sounding like he was okay with it. He probably just wanted to stop Steve’s rattling. A tense silence followed. Yaël couldn’t even look at the two men, she felt like she was an intruder in this conversation, even though it was about her.
- relationships not going exactly how everybody wants it but they work on it
Peter then gives him a dry stare.
! Peter closes his eyes and turns his head back until he’s facing the ceiling.
is going on?!” the girl shouts in anger.
Dr. Palmer. Peter recognizes her from the pictures May showed him. She and Dr. Strange used to be together. It was the story of the century when the two had broken up, according to her. Peter nods at her, and she gives him a small smile back.
“Harry, let me down!” Peter returns. He knows he can’t shoot anything into his face, because falling from this high would certainly be lethal, and he’s not sure he’ll be fast enough seeing as how high he is. The glider keeps on bringing them up.
Only to see Harry standing there with a wide-eyed MJ.
“Yeah, as if. I can help,” he mutters out, grabbing his mask from the ground and putting it over his head.
Steve tried to shrug, but instead he grunted in slight pain. Tony seemed to startle from it, clearly wondering if he should be asking for help.
Or worse… That he’s Spider-Man!
Steve pulls away after Tony starts pushing against his chest. Opening his eyes again, Tony finds Peter standing there, completely in his suit and ready for the battle. He looks eager, active… Alive…
. I had not taken into account that he’s also a teenager.” And can you blame him? Tony never had to deal with teenagers
Of course, that would have mattered had the guy actually
“Steve…” Tony whispers out when Steve starts leaning his head forward. Tony pulls back, not wanting him to get even closer. “When I’m gone… I need you to tell him this.”
“I nnnnnnnn- where’s Tooooooooooooooooooony?”
It’s only in the mirror that he sees the figure on his bed.
“You do know it, right?” he asks, “that I love you?”
Somehow, it’s Steve who seems opposed to that idea. “Yaël,” he somehow warns her, and Yaël holds up her hands in a questioning stance. Then she rolls her eyes.
Tony lets out a shaky laugh, almost too scared to hope. He balls his hands into fists right before he gets himself airborne again. The school isn’t far, so he’s there quickly. Not bothering to get out of his suit, he storms inside the building all the way to where he knows Charles’ office is.
One person looks up, and he nods. Then he stands up and starts walking to somewhere on his right. The guard motions for Tony and Bruce to follow him.
“Oh, now I’m gonna get it…” he mumbled to a random woman standing next to him, who looked at Wade with utter disgrace and confusion. Yaël stamped towards him.
“He is,” Tony says.
“I-I just don’t know you guys. Nobody’s even supposed to know, but yet here we are, Wanda knows, you know. I wonder who else does?” Peter explains.
Aunt May stays quiet for a long moment as she gives Peter a long look. Then, without a warning, she wraps her arms around him and a happy cry comes out of her mouth.
“Okay, just a few seconds, alright? We do not need to see the whole thing!” Sam reminds the two of them. Clint waves off the comment.
FRIDAY answers.
“I’M NOT A HELPLESS LITTLE GIRL, OKAY?!” Yaël grunted out of frustration as she tried to lean more on one leg to get the other one out of her pants.
,” Venom continues. He starts crawling to where MJ is lying on the webs. She doesn’t look scared, but rather pissed off as hell. “
“The girl with the golden eyes,” she spoke softly. “I believe I asked you to join
“Why on earth-“
“You’re Tony Stark, you always find a way to do that.”
“For what?” Steve asked, confused. Tony pulled out some sunglasses, giving Steve a long look.
Star Wars puzzle that I thought we could put together!”
“But do- You still love me, right? Even if I screwed it up?”
The other person is Clint – of course it’s Clint. Though while he normally looks like he’s ready to start cracking a joke, right now he, too, looks absolutely serious.
“Ah yes, we spoke on the phone earlier,” she says. “I have the journals here in this box. There are quite a few – it’s mostly scientific research and all so I don’t know if they’re going to be much use, but it’s customary for us to ask the next of kin if they want to keep the belongings.” She rambles on as she lifts up a box that looks kind of heavy for her – man how many of those books did his mother write? The moment the box is on the counter, Peter opens it to check out its content. They look real enough to him, and when he just picks one out randomly he sees that the date indeed goes back to even before he was born.
“I don’t think that’s such a good idea,” he admits in embarrassment. Everybody turns to him with an understanding expression.
And so the two of them went back to the gym, and they sparred for almost two hours. After that, Tony returned home, ready to face it after a long conversation with the Captain about taking responsibility for his actions.
“Wow, you survived that?” Yaël jumped as someone suddenly sneaked towards her from behind. She rapidly turned around and saw what seemed to be a drunk woman in full armour holding some sort of gun, aiming at Yaël. Wherever she stranded, this didn’t seem to be a nice, kind place.
“TONY TURN DOWN THAT ALARM DAMN IT!” Rhodey shouts as well. Then, as if on cue, the alarm stops at last.
" He tried to stand up. He failed, instead dropping back down.
“Because…” Tony sighs, putting a hand on his forehead while he thinks about how he’s going to explain it. If anything, Steve likes the story straight, no jokes, no excessive details. “Because we are where I’m from.”
“Oh, eh,” Peter already starts, beginning to take the empty plate from the table, but then the man starts to laugh like an idiot. Great, and the whole restaurant is once again looking at them. Maybe he should have just taken the job as a delivery boy, instead.
the voice of FRIDAY suddenly calls out, and in his surprise Peter drops the gauntlet back on the ground and almost jumps off his seat. Oh, right, it’s the AI that always helps Mr. Stark around.
I triggered your memories, and this was what came out of it. So, do you remember Steve?
“I’m not sure how often they fight with you, but they are literally insufferable. I suppose Tony never really forgave Steve after that business in Siberia.”
Yaël supposed that the Asgardians and the Sakaar- escapees would be searching for a new planet to live on. How or where, she wasn’t aware of. Somehow, Yaël would get back home, right? Maybe it would take a few years longer than she had expected when she travelled to Norway…
"Sure," Tony says, taking up his tablet and putting it on his lap.
He goes to the tower, where he’s avoided by his sons the moment they get home. Natalee, apparently, is at a friend’s house. Tony doesn’t mind too much. He hides away in his workshop, gets informed about his ‘wife’ coming back home, gets news about dinner being put up. Gets the news about the kids heading to bed. Tony doesn’t pay too much attention to it – he barely hears it.
Something he would only use in case of an emergency.
Tony can’t remember how often he’s awakened in a room with a heart-monitor reading him. Waking up in medical causes for him to notice too much noise around him the moment he’s out of his sleep. For some reason, though, this time Tony seems to be extra aware of it.
“I mean, even if I wanted to, I can’t. This is
But Steve doesn’t buy it. “You keep telling yourself that,” he says, and he drops the pen back down, giving Tony another glare. “Hate to break up the set.”
Tony falls quiet, eyes wide and mouth dropped open. He closes it quickly enough, clearing his throat and scratching through his hair.
of money. The planes at the airport in Leipzig were also horribly expensive. Tony felt that, the bits that he paid for, too. The damage was partly his fault.
The tower is dark when Tony arrives back. There’s a quinjet on the landing platform, the sunlight is shining brightly onto his skin – a stark contrast in comparison to the cold he felt back in Siberia – and the inside of the penthouse is clearly darkened.
Tony looks everywhere; under the bed, in the closet, in the bathroom. It’s only when he gets a bit of drool into his hair that he notices his son is hanging above his head.
"I have a feeling- I think she's not as guilty as we think she is," the voice that belonged to the blonde guy stated.
“Everybody’s heard of them, Nick Fury is like the most secretive guy-“
That, or his speculation of her secret crush on Barton is true?
Jason wasn’t freaking out, everyone else was.
There he was, Peter Parker, vividly dancing to Rihanna’s Umbrella, and boy, did he have some moves. It took Yaël a little while of staring before she actually felt the anger boil, which’ sudden, fierce appearance was caused by the alcohol. She was going to give him a rant, a hard time! Oh, she’d make him feel!
,” Steve begs of him. Or at least, Tony thinks he does. He hears the words, but doesn’t really see Steve’s face move. Is he going mad?
“What? Are you afraid Peter will be attracted to me instead of you?” Oh, Yaël loved teasing her raisin-friend.
That’s, of course, when he realizes that he’s not feeling bad. At all. He’s feeling great, in fact. Looking at his face in the mirror, he’s got a healthy color in his cheeks, no bags under his eyes. Despite feeling like he could use more sleep in the night – though, honest to Thor and all the other Gods, Peter went to sleep at nine in the evening yesterday so he’s had about twelve hours – his body is not giving him that wave of impending doom. When he wakes up, he jumps out of bed, embracing the new day. While normally he would snooze away on his alarm clock, now he’s up like it’s not that big of a deal. He even went for a jog that morning, for crying out loud!
“Actually, spiders aren’t bugs, but-“
“Steve, how did you even get here?” Peter suddenly asks, not even remembering Steve arriving. Has the suit taken over again at the point where Steve returned to New York? That sucks, Peter would have loved to greet him back in a normal way without this whole situation right now.
FRIDAY tells him. Then, in just a matter of seconds, a whole Iron Man suit forms in front of him. He looks it over, checking out if everything is in working order. He looks over the thrusters, the flight stabilizers, the helmet. All in all, it looks pretty good.
“Can you take it off? So I could have a look at it perhaps?” Tony asks. Peter shrugs, standing up from his bed and pressing on the same spot he always does to take it off.
“Uh,” Peter gets out. He did his research on the accords the moment Tony left, and he
“Nobody?” Pepper asks, raising her eyebrow, putting her hands on her hips.
Tony agreed on Peter keeping it if he continued his training, but that possibility also disappeared as soon as they realized Natasha has gone under as well. Leaving only small messages that say she’s doing fine, there’s not much else they hear about it. Peter just sticks to training against a dummy for the few times he joins Tony at the compound.
“FRI, can you ask Dad how much longer he’ll be?” Peter asks after putting down the final plate. He’s counted about twenty plates so far, most of them for the Sousas and the Carters. Then Peter has to add one for Sharon’s surprise date, Pepper and Happy, aunt May, Vision, Wanda, Rhodey, Bruce (and his secret date?), Tony, Harry and then Peter.
“Oh, nothing much. Your dad just has a nasty stomach-flu, is all,” Rhodey explains, laughing about it. Bucky, too, snorts, shaking his head. Peter just frowns.
After that, they put up the next commercial break. It’s once again surprising, since Tony would have expected it to be over once the winner has been chosen. They’re all called off the stage while the people start cleaning up Peter’s stuff. They’re once again handed bottles of water, and Peter’s given a white robe. He takes off the wig at last, handing it to Johnny who gives it a funny look.
Given, Tony would have run away, too, if he had to watch continuous videos of Steve like that, but he would have thought Peter to be better than that.
“Yaël- I mean, my name is Yaël.” God bloody damn-
“No! Only this smoothie U gave me,” Tony counters. “Though it’s entirely possible he might have thrown something like an energy-drink inside of it.”
“Uh, no, obviously.” Yaël filled her own glass with water and sat down on the rug in front of Wade.
“Heh, my Aunt would freak! She’s been trying to get me to get my grades back up at school,” Peter mumbles back. “Besides, I can barely manage to convince the Avengers to let me fight alongside them.” Then he just shakes his head. He really needs to find some people more of his age to vent to, but instead he finds himself talking to an adult woman who shouldn’t really bother listening to him.
“Oh…”
With May now only working half-time, she can get more time off to go to these kinds of things. Like Wakanda, last week or so. Peter’s actually sure Tony has something to do with it, but it’s also entirely possible her boss just lets her off the hook because he’s got a secret crush on her. He wouldn’t be the first one, after all. Peter remembers the waiter at the Thai-restaurant, Mr. Delmar… That just seems like a lifetime ago.
Peter hadn’t found a response for that. He was actually rather surprised that she hadn’t just broken into his Dad’s accounts to just wire the money to herself, but then again, Tony would have tracked that money back just as easily.
Arriving at the place of the battle, Peter is faced with an even bigger mystery: there’s no sign of the battle there. No broken cars, no pieces of glass. Nothing that indicates that Mordo blew up the Quinjet. It’s as if they’ve cleaned everything up in that short timespan and haven’t made a crime-scene of it at all, which Peter doubts.
excited about this all. Peter just sighs and decides to give up.
“Hi, Cap!” she did her best to sound cheerful.
“You did, she had to leave again. But she left a message,” he says, picking up the post-it and handing it to Tony. The engineer blinks a few times at Peter’s outstretched hand holding the piece of paper, but eventually reaches out to take it.
Okay, calm down, take a deep breath. Things have been hard on Peter, too. He’s just trying to get past his anger and grief towards Steve by constantly fighting crime all over New York. Tony can’t be angry at him for that, right?
MJ and Peter follow Tony back outside. After that, they wait for Happy to arrive and bring Ned and MJ back to their houses. Tony drives Harry and Peter back to the tower, where he allows a now-informed Bruce to look after his cuts and scrapes.
Once everybody has taken something to eat Felicia manages to find a free table for them to sit at. They continue talking, Shuri explaining what’s happening in Wakanda right now. MJ explains how there’s another protest she’s going to in a week. Johnny has nothing much to say other than the parties he’s been going to. Felicia stays quiet, though. Peter doesn’t read into it, some people just don’t like sharing too much about themselves.
But it’s exhausting. It’s pretty much like training again, only this time the only reasons he’s getting bruises is because of his own feet kicking his legs. He can sing, sure, but dancing like this has never really been his talent. Of course, Tony wouldn’t be Tony if he would just back down from a challenge like this.
He arrives just in time when he sees the guy pull her back to him by grabbing her arm. Then he pushes her against the wall. He hears a painful grunt coming from Michelle, and he jumps up. He needs to help, here.
"Maybe she didn't know better. "
Peter laughs for a bit, then. Really, he’s glad he has Harry back in his life. It would have been a lot better had Harry actually been here. He remembers the day the guy announced that he was going to travel. Peter had felt abandoned, then. First Ned, who was leaving for MIT, and then Harry? Holy crap, it was like everybody was just leaving at the same time!
“But- nobody knows me? Why would they take me?”
He frowns, then. He can’t remember that he’s been having it difficult to breathe? He doesn’t let go of their hands, but does try to take a deep breath. It’s as if he hasn’t been breathing at all since he’s here, because taking that gulp of air suddenly brings him into a coughing fit.
Steve complains. “
“No, he isn’t,” Yaël replied while looking at the trunk of the nearby trees “Raido is not even his real name, but I call him that because of his obsession with horses. Since he was a little boy, he seemed to have a connection with them. He has a lot of respect and patience with horses so he joined the cavalry as soon as he grew up. Raido is not only a rune, it also stands for horseback riding, or just riding. It stands for a journey, well, at least it does here at Helvegen,” Yaël smiled when she finally found the right trees: two trees standing perfectly next to each other. A horse was carved into both of their trunks. “His real name is Rozenrød.”
“’sup guys, forget your pin-number?” Peter asks casually. Simultaneously, all the plastic, cartoony faces of the Avengers turn to look at him. Then he points at them. “Whoa, you’re the Avengers! What are you guys doing here?”
But we paraphrase a book written 3, 500 hundred years ago
Things that makes Peter wish he would only have a normal family.
“It’s okay, Peter,” Tony continues. He glances a quick look at May on Peter’s other side, finding the woman close to having some sort of panic attack. Shit, he should get Rhodey here as soon as possible. Quickly, he leans to Steve’s side and whispers at him.
Huh, those are the same eyes he looks at when he’s standing in front of the mirror. How funny that is. Hey, didn’t his mother once sleep with this guy? How freaking weird is that? But then again, the dancing spiders around Mr. Stark’s head are weird as well.
“I was only out for a few hours?” Tony counters.
,” somebody says in between. Tony doesn’t know who or when.
“I’ve been miserable for so long without you,” Peter admits as well, a bit breathless. Then, he finally pulls back a little, not getting out of her hold completely. That’s when Peter realizes his hands are still on her cheeks. She doesn’t seem to mind it, though. “But I don’t understand? I held you in my arms? I went to your funeral? How are you here?”
Oh, God, the things he said to Tony. That’s everything but alright. And he didn’t even mean it like that; he’d just been
of relief for Tony. There’s more noise behind Tony, but he ignores it as he takes a look at his son.
- Tony receiving too much shit from all around him
“Care to go to Washington?” he asks, a little uncertain in his words. Peter blinks a few times before nodding. After that, they’re off to the compound, where they take one of the smaller quinjet and lift off, away from New York.
“No way, he took you to Disneyland?”
Shit, this wasn’t a good idea! Yaël needed to get that card as quick as possible and leave this dude alone. Not that Jason was going to manipulate her into taking over the world, but God knows what he had up his sleeve.
“Control me?” Eddie asks. “No, he’s not controlling me. He’s using me, much the same way
“When’s it that Dad stepped out of the weapon’s business?” Peter asks.
Chapter warnings in the end notes
“Tony,” Steve starts again, and Tony’s eyes rest on those lips as they speak out his name. Those full lips that can produce the sincerest smile any human can ever manage. Crap, he needs to get out of here,
“You do, huh?” Peter asks, crossing his arms. Tony smirks a bit at him, but his eyes look hollow. “Tell me about it, then?”
Bucky shouts in their ears.
“He- he wanted revenge on you. I wouldn’t co-operate so he went to find someone who would give him less resistance.” Felicia closes her eyes again. “I’m sorry, Peter. For everything.” The hand on Peter’s cheek drops down.
There’s another call coming through. This time, Peter’s available of picking it up.
Peter nods, smiling back at him.
Steve can’t really pinpoint the exact moment he fell in love with Tony Stark.
Steve had said.
It looks like even the sky is burning. What used to always be blue and bright is now red, yellow, burning into everybody’s eyes. The blood of all their fallen comrades, a reminder of what they’ve all lost.
“Nothing much, just her apology, and explanation as to why she broke all contact. Also to tell me Peter’s my son.”
“May, this is Tony. Peter’s asleep,” Tony says in a whisper.
Sharon Carter enters the tower at exactly seven in the evening. She’s still in her SHIELD-uniform, holding a tablet in her hands while she keeps on tapping away on the screen, not even looking up at Tony or Steve as she walks inside.
“I used to live here…” she mumbled to herself. The man, who decided to sit down for a minute while she looked around, stayed silent. “Who lived here with me?” Yaël turned around and saw that black-head eating a pear from the big basket of fruit standing next to the old, comfy-looking chair he was sitting in. So he was kind of stealing her pears now?
“So this is the plan,” Yaël opened the door herself and walked in, Lopt followed her into the room as she explained herself.
“I don’t know! I’ve been breaking my head about this but I just can’t get to a simple plan,” Peter confesses in annoyance. He kicks away a little stone from the ground, and when it lands in the water the ducks fly away in panic.
Chapter warnings:
“How did you get here?” he asks, not angry but more curiously. Peter opens his mouth to answer, but then FRIDAY suddenly opens up the door for them, allowing them in.
During a clearer moment, she saw Steve, Wade, a random person and Wanda standing in the corner of a room, discussing something.
“It’s nothing,” he said.
extremis. The fire-stuff, it helps with nothing. It’s what makes everything unstable. He needs to get rid of the fire, to find a way to make it something
” Yaël instantly rolled her eyes as she opened them. Yup, that was Thor alright.
“You’re such a hypocrite,” Peter bites out. Finally, confused, Tony’s angry look disappears and makes place for one of confusion. “You two, you go out on life-threatening missions even more than I do! Last time you ended up in the hospital! You didn’t see me cause a scene after that!”
Great. He quickly pockets it in his back pocket and stands back up. His knees ache when he does that, but at least it’s bearable. At least it’s not worthy of getting a prosthesis yet. Tony doesn’t think he’s psychologically ready to face that reality just yet.
After a few hours, Tony finally arrives to the coordinates Wilson gave him. At first he doesn’t see much other than snow – luckily the suit has its own heating system, otherwise he’s seriously underdressed. Eventually, he spots the quinjet, and another vehicle close to what seems like an underground bunker. When he comes down next to the quinjet, he can see that the footprints aren’t that old – they’re still pretty deep, not yet covered by freshly fallen snow.
“How long until Steve arrives?”
“I love you, too,” he says, smiling despite his freezing face. Then he hangs up the phone and turns around, heading back into the café.
“If you don’t fix this
“No Steve! Stop defending the ass all the time! He’s done nothing but make everything harder for us all the time!”
“Peter, what’s wrong?” Eddie asks. He sounds on the edge, which is good. He’ll just use that stress to get his ass out of here, Peter hopes.
Maybe this wasn’t a good choice she was going to make, maybe she could handle this differently, but who would care? Her reputation couldn’t get any worse, as people clearly looked down at her.
I'm not really sure what I should say. It feels like the beginning of the story wrote out easily, the middle part became a bitch to write, and the ending went by easily again! There was a moment of writer's block that I couldn't get myself out of, I think. But, I'm glad it's finished at last!
“Peter, do you know if there was anybody else in the building?” Harry asks, a bit scared. Wanda’s face turns into one of horror, only to get back to relief once Peter shakes his head.
“How is she doing?” Charles heard Mr. Rogers ask as they we’re going through one of the hallways, towards Yaël’s classroom.
“Seven beers and four wines!”
Iron Man’s calm voice calls out. Peter feels another cold chill pass him by. Excessively, he starts shaking his head, gripping the Goblin a bit tighter by the arm. He knows what’s going to happen next, and of course he knows he’s not going to fall down to his death, that small moment of freefall is scary enough for him.
“No, you see? Mary wrote here that, somehow, she knew Peter would be bitten when he’s older. Now there’s no possible way for her to know that other than-“
Clearly, he’s not.
“WHAT?!” Steve suddenly shouts, turning towards the middle of everything. They’re not too far away, seeing the cause of all the destruction standing there proudly, swinging fists around like it’s just a walk in the park. With every swing, about five of Wakanda’s warriors go flying.
As for the kid's deal; it's all part of Yaël's story and will be explained there. Just know that at one point there's a baby and it gets a reaction out of Tony and Steve.
“Rhodey,” Tony warns him. Rhodey ignores him
Tony smiles a bit. Yes, Tony can imagine Steve sitting here, waiting for the sun to get on the right spot, with his sketchbook on his lap and crayon in his hand. A small wave of sadness goes through him. He clears his throat.
T’Challa is there to greet him when he lands at a private airport. The two men shake hands, and Tony gets greeted with three kisses on his cheeks. He’s not new to that, so he doesn’t pull away.
- Depression, mentions of depression
“Steve, I-“ he starts, but he chokes, his eyes stinging and a sob escaping. He turns his head to the side, squeezing his eyes shut in an attempt to stop the tears. He fails at it. With Steve still sitting on top of him, the two men cry it out.
Then she walked back to her sink and put her hands in the water to test if it wasn’t too hot. She frowned. “You have to be shitting me!” she growled. The water was still cold. Yaël ran to the shower and tested the water there. Cold. Oh, she was so going to call Fury! She had to call him anyways to hear if she finally could contact Steve, because she still got no news from X nor Fury about that.
“But how did my mom end up as a Valkyrie?” Yaël asked.
Tony can see quickly enough that the menu, too, has been designed by Steve. Is this whole place pimped up by him? Tony knows the guy did some freelance painting jobs, but it’s almost as if Steve designed this whole place!
The doors open in just a matter of seconds after he pressed the button. He hears one of the nurses say something among the lines of ‘damn it, again?’, though Tony doesn’t respond to it. He takes a step back when the nurse comes up to him, indicating that she’ll take his place.
“Dad, I’ll do the drinks, okay?” Peter suggests, taking the bottle from the table. Tony nods. With a little brush, they clean up the shards. Harry, in the meantime, decides to go talking with Wanda and Vision for a while. If they mistrusted Harry at first, at least now they’re not showing it anymore. Though Harry might be getting a few moments where he’s just staring ahead, deep in thought, he’s done nothing more than prove that he’s back to his old self.
He decides to just move forward. He only vaguely remembers where the professor’s office is, so with a careful knock he indicates his presence, hearing a small ‘come in’ from the other side. But even if he hadn’t heard anything he would have stepped inside the room.
Peter jumped up to defend himself energetically. “I swear, I don’t have hidden feelings for you. I mean, sure, you look great and all; very exotic with that Latino vibe and then the hair. But to be honest, and I don’t mean to be rude, the combination of my meds and the alcohol…” Yaël took the compliment easily and let it pass.
“FRIDAY, try and get me some footage of what happened here in June 2015,” he says.
“Steve isn’t going to keep you a secret forever. He’s just been raised to see it as wrong, so his morals and his feelings continuously contradict themselves. He’s been thrown out of time, he hasn’t gotten
“What was that?” Mr. Stark’s voice sounds, almost metallic through the microphone of the helmet.
That’s a decision Nick made. I think he sort of wanted to test you, see what you are worth without anyone around you to influence you. Maybe he wanted to see your true colors.
“Really?!” Yaël grunted to Loki’s back “We promised these people freedom and you take them to war against your sister on your stupid planet!” Loki had put his hands on his back and stared out of the wall-filling window. He was standing a few steps higher than her, but Yaël was able to see the flashes from lasers shooting at them from where she was standing. The whole ship was in chaos whilst trying to flee from Sakaar.
“More like a father,” he says.
Tony knows the way well; he’s designed this damn place, after all.
"And along came the mourning of another," Yaël sighed as she saw Peter walk to a certain row, like he was on auto-pilot. "He'll probably think I'm paranoid if he sees me talking tomyself like this."
“I don’t blame her,” Tony responds. It’s crappy, what happened. He can perfectly imagine she’s not feeling all that well for causing so much destruction. But on the other hand, he’s grateful that she rescued Steve when he was about to be blown up. And if that makes him the biggest hypocrite of them all, he doesn’t care.
After they hung up, Yaël fell asleep quickly and finally saw that what she had been hoping to see passed weeks: the dream.
“Hero, villain, all just titles that don’t really matter. I think you’re a living being who, just like me, lives upon making mistakes and fixing those.” This time, Yaël raised her eyebrows.
“You’re such a child.”
"Hey, Pete, how was school?" he asks. Peter shrugs, leaning forward to catch a glimpse of what Tony is making.
“So you hate sex. Big deal,” she says like it’s indeed not that big of a deal. Peter’s mouth falls open, eyes wide, at the flippant way she just seems to dismiss his problem.
“And what if she joins us?” Wade nodded to Yaël, ignoring Peter’s biting question, still frozen like a popsicle. Yaël saw the curiosity in Peter’s eyes as he turned to her, also a bit distracted now, just a bit.
But in the tower there’s Steve. And Peter. And all the other Avengers. And, right now, he doesn’t think he can handle them. Steve because of his damn confession yesterday. Peter because of everything that happened to him. The Avengers are just too… loud. He doesn’t want to deal with this right now.
“Boy, you know me so well,” Tony snaps back, pushing himself off the couch with a grunt. “Actually I’m nursing an electromagnetic headache.”
“Uh, thanks,” Peter mutters the moment he’s freed. He wipes his mouth on his sleeve, eyeing Wade carefully.
They’re in an open field when the phone starts vibrating against his leg. Steve tries to ignore it, running as fast as he can behind Natasha who keeps up a surprising speed that matches his own. He would never have thought her to be so fast.
“Tea?” he asks. Bruce nods, but Peter shakes his head. In just a blink of the eye, Bruce has a steamy mug in his hands. “What do you drink?”
The receptionists are right in the middle of the room, and on the sides there are waiting-stools for the people who made appointments. There’s one big staircase that leads to the first floor, and there are about six elevators that go up. Peter wonders if all of them go to the Penthouse on the top.
“You look amazing,” Steve whispers at him. He puts his hand behind Tony’s head, turning it until they’re looking right at each other.
“Eh, sort of,” she mumbled vaguely.
“I’ll figure that out after a while. First I just want to… spend some time with him,” Peter says. “Of course, that would work if he would actually
all the time. It’s exactly what Pepper said before she left.
“Negative. If I’m correct, the suit is currently still located at the apartment Peter shares with young master Storm.”
What?! “That doesn’t make sense, I can steer the four elements!”
“I can be very persuasive.”
“You’ve made a surprising recovery, Peter,” Dr. Cho starts. Peter nods in agreement, trying to pretend not to know anything about it. “The bruises on your face have faded already more than they should have in just a week, and this wound… The stitches could have been removed three days ago, I think.”
Peter grabs his bag, making sure that he’s
“You know what? I’m leaving. I don’t need this shit.” Peter gets up from where he was sitting, his hot coco completely forgotten as he starts his way back to his room.
“I’m not sure… but…” The man looked confused and stared to the sky, like he was searching for something. Did Yaël just hear her name somewhere? He looked back at her and threw her a sad smile. Yaël frowned at him, blinked and when she opened her eyes, she was staring at the ceiling. For a second, Yaël felt dizzy from the sudden change.
“We don’t know,” she admits. “For now, it doesn’t seem like it. But the amount you have is significantly smaller than Steve.”
Peter clears his throat, announcing his arrival. Tony turns around so fast Peter’s sure he could have broken his neck. Steve, who is in the kitchenette, drops down his towel and leans against the counter with his arms crossed.
“No, I don’t think that’s necessary,” he says. “Thank you, though.”
“It was perfect,” Steve returns. Thor then lets out a relieved sigh, walking up towards Steve and pulling him up on his feet. Then, all of the sudden, there are two extremely strong arms pulling him into a hug that steals the breath out of Steve’s lungs.
“Tony, calm down,” Steve comes in, putting a hand on Tony’s shoulder to pull him back a bit. In return, Tony turns around and pulls away from him.
“Hey! Sir, you can’t be here!” a nurse shouts. Tony opens his eyes again. He turns to the side to watch what’s going on. He startles when he sees a dark figure standing in the opening of his door.
“I said that I didn’t know you for too long, but if anything would have happened to you I would kill everybody in the room and then myself.”
Felicia smiles. So does Peter who looks at her like the proudest boyfriend in the world.
“What does he want?” Steve asks.
“Hello?” he asks hesitantly.
Natasha nods, though she pretends to have no clue what he’s talking about.
- Relationship issues
“What did you do?” she asked suspiciously.
“She says that it’s a gift for the bomb-goddess,” Korg translated casually.
Oh, Tony’s good at this! Natasha holds back her laughter.
“Tony is in the hospital, and Steve wants to go back to New York,” Bucky explains. There’s some murmurs after that.
“You don’t look so well,” Tony points out. Peter rolls his eyes, taking off his coat and hanging it up among the others.
“I’m sorry you have to search for a new teacher now, Charlie.” He shrugged with a grin on his face
“Tony,” Steve starts, but then he stops. Putting his hands on his hips, his eyes bore angrily into Tony’s back.
feelings from her side if they actually drunkenly slept together. In any way, Peter knows that he doesn’t particularly feel anything
“Hell, yeah!” Wait, did he seriously mean that or was it just a sick joke?
Peter frowns, but then shrugs. “Sure, go ahead,” he says.
He passes Rhodey with a nod, gives Vision a high five – he’s been the lucky person to teach the Android how to do that – and receives an apple from Clint without asking for it. Enjoying the sweet, fruity snack, Peter knocks on the door of Dr. Cho’s office, and waits for her word to be taken inside.
“Okay, that’s enough,” he warns Ross, who nods at his colleague. He starts talking again, explaining how the government no longer wants them to operate just like that. When the other man hands him a thick book, Tony figures that must be what these supposed ‘accords’ are all about. Handing the book towards Wanda, Ross calls them the ‘Sokovia Accords’, which, Tony thinks, is probably the crappiest name they could have chosen, but he doesn’t mention it at all.
“What makes you think I’m not doing okay?” Tony shifts uncomfortably.
“Just do it. I’m not planning to destroy the world with it,” he assures her.
,” she says. Peter can’t blame her, she mentioned once before that comforting people isn’t something she’s good at, at all. She explained how she’s always afraid to make it worse by saying something wrong, or whatever. Peter doesn’t hold it against her; just once more he’s proving how a horrible friend he is. Can’t even act normal to have a serious talk with the girl.
Oh, yeah, he’d forgotten the thrill that came with appearing in front of a large audience. Tony shakes hands with LL once again before walking further ahead, high-fiving a few of the people at the front. To the people in the back, he blows them a kiss just to make them feel included.
But Peter knows what’s going on. Steve is a fugitive. If they catch him, he’ll be locked up and they won’t speak. If he escapes, he’ll be a wanted man, and they won’t be able to speak, either. In any way, the chances of them being in contact in the future are close to zero…
The drop on the ground isn’t pleasurable. Leaving the suit behind and walking away from Steve hurts even more.
“But those are colored lenses?” Peter continues. Felicia looks up again, a bitter look on her face.
“You’re a snitch, and nobody likes snitches,” he says with a wink. Then the three walk out of the room, followed by Bucky who hurries after them. That little team there is just full of evil plans, and Tony’s sure he doesn’t want any part of that.
For a moment he wonders if the population of New York starts to realize that doing crime in here is a hopeless task given that it’s the home base of who knows how many superheroes? He
“Uhm, because I’m not sure if I’m walking into a trap,” Peter mutters out. “Has my dad awakened yet?”
“Tell me about it, he keeps on sneaking up on me,” Peter mutters. While shaking his head, he feels once more that he’s still completely
Peter nods, leaning back a bit in his chair.
Steve Rogers says on the other side of the line. Once again, Peter almost drops the phone. He finally pulls the mask off and heads towards the bathroom. If Happy comes walking inside, he wouldn’t immediately catch him like this.
pissed him off.
The campus is huge, making Peter feel like he’s going to be lost if he wanders here alone. The people around him all seem… huge. Not as in
“Hi, Steve,” Peter returns. “Listen, Nat and I had about half an hour of walking to get here. If you two need to… do whatever you need to do, you’ve still got time.”
“FRI, can you try and connect with the nanites?” Tony asks, only noticing then how scratchy his voice sounds.
“Oh, so then you must know Scotty! He’s a teacher there. Maybe you students called him mister Summers…” Mrs. Thompson chattered happily.
Good, they’re talking. Peter keeps his mouth shut now. They need to figure this out themselves.
? He can do things Spider-Man can’t. So on a certain day in May, a day where the sun is shining and the temperature is good enough to not have to wear a coat, they call up the press conference. Peter is nervous the entire time he has to wait. He’s behind the stage; people can’t see him there. Tony’s team has prepared him for this, styled his hair and dressed him up. They made him pretty much unrecognizable from the college student Peter Parker he’s created in the past month.
Peter takes a breath, and then takes another one. One part of him wants to call Steve, bring him up to date about what is happening at the moment. But the other part of him thinks that he doesn’t deserve to know if he’s not going to make an effort and try to be here. He knows it’s dangerous, but he would have thought that Tony would be reason enough to ignore all that.
May nods. “You don’t want creepy.”
“Well, god-bloody-damn it!” she hissed instead.
“You talked? Or did Spider-Man talk?” she asks, avoiding the next punch and using her foot to throw him down again. Immediately, Peter jumps back up and shakes it off like it’s not too big a deal.
But, for the few times that he thinks about texting his friends, he usually gets a pretty quick reply. He realizes he’s probably screwed something up when, after five texts of him trying to get everybody together for another Pizza-evening, Yaël still doesn’t answer.
“Look,” she started talking, wanting to clean this mess up. They shouldn’t be fighting about her. “I’ll move out as soon as I have enough money, don’t worry. And until that moment, I’ll help out wherever you need me to. I’m not here to take advantage of you. Just don’t let me do anything technical, I’m not as smart as you or your son.” Tony looked a bit startled, but that emotion went off his face again very quickly. He just stared at her, like he was thinking of an answer. But yet, he just nodded and turned back to Steve after a few seconds.
“Good!” the guy grinned. Yaël somehow doubted if partying with Wade would be the most responsible thing to do, but whatever. Having some fun wasn’t a crime, right?
When the phone suddenly starts ringing, he startles, pulling his hand back just a tiny bit. On the screen, a number appears, but one unfamiliar to Tony. Not a lot of people have Tony’s personal number, so he wonders if this could be a mistake? Carefully, Tony takes the phone, and presses the ‘answer’ button.
The window probably wouldn’t help at all, because it only led to a small alley with garbage bins. And that wasn’t to speak about the lights, which were just as useless. Most of them didn’t even work! And the ones that did gave enough light for Yaël to find her bed, which consisted of two mattresses placed on each other, at night. Luckily it was day now, so the window above her bed let in enough light to provide her whole room.
“Whoa, this is a lot lighter than I expected,” she calls out, moving it around a bit in her surprise.
back to him.
“He has to be at least six months sober before he can receive a liver. Otherwise there’s too much chance of him falling back to it,” Dr. Palmer had said after the hepathologist had come by. Tony had shouted angrily at that before his mood changed completely and he started crying about how it’s his own fault. Peter had just held him back then, but hadn’t said anything otherwise.
Breakfast goes on without much trouble. At one point Thor shows up with obvious panic in his eyes, storming towards Steve to ask if they can go through the vows one more time. They’re going for a completely Asgardian wedding, but Jane still insisted on getting some traditional, Midgardian things in it as well. Given the fact that Thor is about to marry the woman he loves, there’s no way he’s refusing her wish.
