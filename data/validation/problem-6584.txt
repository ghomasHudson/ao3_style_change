Steve smiled. "Maybe next time, then," he said, and God, Tony could hardly believe that Steve already wanted there to be a next time.
Tiberius made a show of noticing Steve, which was impressive considering that he'd had to walk past him in order to sit next to him. "Captain!" he said, brightly. "It's a pleasure to see you again."
"Nah, I'm fine for right now," Tony says. "Maybe in the morning, though, yeah. I mean, we still have the whole day off tomorrow, right? And I think Jan ought to give us extra since it's not like we got the night off. What with Ghost."
"A very discreet artisan in Wakanda," Steve said. "I can give you her number if you're looking to add to your collection."
"Tony," Steve gasped. "Tony, Tony, yes, perfect, thank you so much, I love you, I've always loved you," he breathed, and he came.
Sweat begins to bead on the back of Steve's neck, as Tony stands there, motionless. This is bad. If Ghost figures out that Tony can't fight -- which both seems to be currently true and also something that Ghost is well on the way to discovering -- he's going to know that Tony is vulnerable. And he's going to take advantage of it. The situation has just gotten far more dangerous for Tony. Steve swallows hard.
The sound coming from Tony's mouth was a ruined, broken groan; he didn't have the breath to scream. He just laid there, passive, shuddering, letting the pain take him. It carried him along inside it, a rushing current of agony, threatening to pull him under entirely.
Steve was hot and tight inside, his body clenching down on Tony's fingers, desperately trying to hold onto him, and it was very easy to imagine what it might be like on another night, when they might have more supplies and Steve could take even more of him. Tony was getting harder at the mere thought.
He opened his eyes. Hospital, definitely. The world was too bright to make out more details than the bland whiteness of the walls and the eye-searing intensity of the lights. He glanced down. Blanket pulled up to his chest. Hospital gown. Massive amounts of wires snaking under the neck of the gown. Those were EKG leads. Great. His favorite. He glanced right. Blood pressure cuff on his arm. Pulse oximeter on his finger. Hospital bracelet. A bag of liquid hanging next to him, dripping down the tube leading to the IV in his right arm.
"With me in the studio today," she said, "here to discuss the allegations against Mr. Stark and his bodyguard Iron Man, is one of Iron Man's longtime teammates and the Avengers' current co-chairperson, the Sentinel of Liberty himself, Captain America."
Tony still wasn't looking at him. "But when you say it," he said, softly, "you make me want to believe it."
Steve's face was burning. Tony didn't seem to mind, but, well. He knew it wasn't normal. And he always hated feeling like he was imposing, wanting so much more than any other fella needed. And some people -- well, okay, Connie -- had just wanted him to last longer. If he'd told her he was Captain America, he could have at least explained this particular issue. But, well, she hadn't liked that much either, had she?
Then Steve looked down at the tangle of wires in Tony's hands. "Damn," he said, sotto voce. "Here I am keeping you from your work, aren't I? I'm sorry."
His mic was still live. He couldn't answer Carol, not without broadcasting it to the whole world. Carol would tell him more, wouldn't she? He schooled his face into impassiveness. Whatever was happening, he'd be ready.
"Glad to hear it," Steve said, cheerfully, with a smile that ought to have been illegal, which he then followed up with an implied proposition to commit several acts that were definitely currently illegal in slightly under half of the United States. "This is going to be a day for a lot of firsts for you, isn't it?"
, they can touch now -- and leans down to murmur in his ear. "Not a problem," he says, smoothly, confidently, like
Tony's eyes lit up; he was smiling like Steve had just handed him an unexpected present. It looked like Tony, too, was enjoying the novelty of being able to act on his desires. He raised his hand, his palm skimming over Steve's stomach not quite touching him. "You want--?"
"Obviously an Iron Man one," Steve says, passing over the tiny stickers of Hank and Jan at ant and wasp size, respectively, and then the sticker of Mj√∂lnir, to get to the next Iron Man one. "He's
"For you, Winghead? Of course. Always." Iron Man's already starting to take a few steps in his direction.
Steve took a deep breath, and he lay down next to Tony, stretching out beside him, farther down the bed, his head at Tony's side. His feet were hanging off the end of the mattress now, but his cock, still hard, was pressed very nicely against Tony's leg. He wasn't about to deny himself the additional stimulation.
Iron Man makes a quiet clicking noise, a catch in the back of his throat, and that's when Steve realizes he's been rubbing Iron Man's palm with his thumb, massaging it. He freezes. He hadn't asked first.
Steve looked up, blinking, and wiped his face on his glove. "Not your fault. I just wonder -- what's even left in there, you know?"
For some reason, Tony was grinning more broadly, as if something about that terrible time was making him happy to think about. "I'm just saying," he murmured. "The just thing would have been to turn me in. The noble thing would have been to step back and let me die a free man. The thing you did, Steve? The thing you did was
He hadn't quite meant to say it. Not so soon. Not like this. But that's how he is with feelings: he tries to hold them in as long as he can, to be proper and controlled, and then when he opens his mouth somehow they all slip out of him, unbidden. He feels clumsy, off-kilter.
He struggled mostly one-handed into another pair of sweatpants and another t-shirt and headed downstairs, which was when he realized he'd made two very serious miscalculations.
"Well," Steve said, like he'd put down a heavy weight all at once and didn't quite know what to do with himself now. "That's good. That's really good."
Steve still had no idea what to do. But he had to think of something soon, before Tony had nothing left.
Tony had raised his head and was regarding him curiously. "Really? That fast?" he asked, intrigued, and then he smiled. "I mean, obviously, yes, really, I can see you, but wow. That's--"
Steve's voice was choppy and stiff. He probably sounded humorless. Unemotional. Everything the world always thought Captain America was, like they didn't know there was a man under the cowl. Sometimes it seemed like there shouldn't be.
"You already read the title and author," Steve pointed out. "But if you want to keep going, anything is fine. Here." He reached over to Tony's lap, opened the book at random. "Just wherever that is. That's probably fine."
Steve glanced down at himself; he was down to a sleeveless undershirt on top, but he was, indeed, still wearing his uniform pants and boots.
This right here, this was what Steve was missing, not being with Tony. It wasn't about sex. It wasn't even about Steve. It was about Tony. Tony just wanted love. And if Tony had wanted him, by God, he would have tried with all his heart to make him happy, to show him what it was like to be loved. Tony wanted love, and Steve had love to give.
It's a terrible sensation, and it's also an oddly familiar one. Steve can't imagine when this ever happened to him before, though, and now is probably not the best time to contemplate it.
"Sunset started cornering me last year," Tony said, dully. "In public. I ended up agreeing to work for her, so I didn't make a scene at my own party. Unfortunately, I wasn't working for her in public. She was-- she was actually the one holding Jocasta hostage." That explained the terrible expression that had been on Tony's face. "Her idea of distracting me from finding Jocasta was, uh, grabbing me and kissing me." His words were hesitant. "I-- I didn't tell her no."
"Not a solution I'd recommend," Tony said, sighing again. "If you can get drunk enough, there's a point where you eventually stop feeling ashamed of what you want. Of course, then you're not really in a fit state to act on what you want, and no decent human being would agree to sleep with you. It's very convenient if you happen to be dating an amoral psychopath, though." Tony said the words like he'd only just now realized how terribly wrong the entire situation had been, at a decade-long remove.
you, and I told myself it would be okay because I thought you'd never find out. And it was wrong of me. I should never have... given into my desires."
. Okay, so Steve hadn't exactly been intending for him to know that quite yet, but the sentiment remains unchanged.
The last time Steve had touched Tony was a friendly clap to the shoulder, when he'd told him he hadn't wanted to be an Avenger like he'd expected Tony to be happy about it.
," he says, and there's no way Steve can come up with a counter to that. "That would be absolutely lovely. If-- if you're sure."
"Eh." Tony raises his hand and tips it to the side. "Yes and no. The outer layer of the armor hooks into a second piece, and that's the part I have to wear. Not this. On the field, if I were unconscious, you might have tried to strip the whole thing off me, and that would have been... bad, so stressing that the chestplate couldn't come off was the simplest way to go, then. But the outer armor is just armor." He taps his metallic shoulder with one finger. "When I was redesigning the armor, after I got home, I wanted to be able to wear the chestplate under ordinary clothes. Still can't let anyone touch me, or they'll figure it out, but at least I can fit into a button-down shirt. And that's what's really important, right?"
It was all too much. He couldn't think. He couldn't feel anything except the terrible onrushing darkness, threatening to swallow him whole. He didn't know what to do.
Even as he said it, he didn't know if he believed himself. Tony was asleep. It was like some kind of fairytale. An awful one. Helpless, he reached out, and he traced two gloved fingers over Tony's cheekbone, down the side of his face to his sharp, stubbled jawline. Tony still didn't stir.
Then Steve's earpiece crackled to life. He was still on Avengers comms, because if there was an emergency, he needed to know about it. This was the worst timing in the world, though.
Luckily, Tony seemingly hadn't noticed there was anything wrong. He waved his hand, a gesture encompassing the entire kitchen. "Well?" he said, still smiling, like he was prompting Steve. "Come on in and fix yourself something. I'm almost done, don't worry. I won't get in your way. I've got a meeting to get to at ten."
Steve was beginning to feel like a character in that sci-fi movie Tony had shown him once, the one where everyone was being replaced by pod people. He couldn't believe what he was hearing.
Steve holds out an arm, and Iron Man leans into him, pressing up against him, hip to knee, and he's definitely not wearing anything metal below the waist. Steve's not going to contemplate that right now. He's with Iron Man, and it's enough.
Steve's never seen Iron Man's hands before; he's never seen any part of him out of the armor. Iron Man's skin is olive-toned, but under the shade of his complexion he's too pale; he's clearly not all right. Iron Man flexes his wrist, back and forth. His palm is covered with a patchwork of thin scars. Some are old. Others are newer. After a second or two, he slides his bare hand to the cuff of the other gauntlet, flips whatever hidden switch it has, and the other gauntlet likewise retracts as the process repeats.
That was how it had worked, Steve realized, dully. Pleasure had come with a price. A favor Tony hadn't wanted to owe, for something that Tiberius had probably made a big deal of doing especially for Tony -- because that was
"Hey," Steve murmurs, steadying Tony with a firm grip on his arm as Tony brings up his other hand to lean on Steve for even more support. "Hey, hey. Shh. I've got you."
"And obviously he didn't know that I -- or Iron Man -- had any existing connection to Donahue. How could he have known? He said he wouldn't have asked me for that favor if he'd known. So, you see," Tony said, triumphantly, "he did apologize after all. He said that part was his fault."
," Steve breathed, in a voice Tony had never heard from his mouth before. He never begged. He was begging for this.
Tony stepped in close, and Steve wrapped his arms around him, and Tony hugged him back just as fiercely. It was okay, Steve told himself. It was. They could be friends. They could still do this. They could still have this.
"No, it's fine," Tony said. He couldn't really bring himself to care. People had definitely believed even flimsier stories from him. "Just let me know how many photos there are of me being strapped to a gurney in only my underwear."
That all sounded like something Tiberius would have said, and also something that Tony, hungry for love, would absolutely have believed. As long as Tiberius had said he loved him, Tony would have taken it.
It's not like people haven't had nice things to say about Steve, over the years -- everyone thinks well of Captain America -- but from Tony it feels so much more special. Not because he's stinting with praise, not at all. Every one of Tony's friends knows how much Tony loves them. But Tony knows him, knows him in a way a lot of people don't, knows who he really is at the end of the day, and loves him for it -- and that means far more to Steve than the roar of the crowd ever could. And for all that Tony is a consummate showman, he's positive the same goes for Tony.
The reporter onscreen was looking around in confusion, but Steve had access to more information than she did. He grabbed his laptop again, typing in the commands as fast as he could. Every Avenger's location could be tracked via their identicard, but because Tony was Tony, Steve had a hell of a lot more data on him. Tony's suit telemetry was extensive. In addition to location, Steve could access the suit's medical monitoring as well as a systems log. The log gave him real-time data on shots fired -- currently just the repulsor blasts from two minutes ago -- and, apparently, Tony's teleporter usage.
Steve could at least correct him about that. "I definitely would be," he said, fiercely. "I got your message. Listened to the whole thing. Then when you weren't back when you said you'd be back, I got worried. And then I came looking for you."
He had no idea what to expect, and he'd never enjoyed going in blind, but he was positive this wasn't going to be the deadliest fight he'd ever been in. Tiberius was only a baseline human, and if he was foolhardy enough to try to take Steve on directly, he was absolutely going to lose. But Tiberius had spent the entire week demonstrating that he definitely wasn't stupid, so he probably had a different plan. Steve wished he had some idea of what it was. Everything he could picture as a worst-case scenario stemming from his own involvement was along the lines of Tiberius using Tony as a hostage once he figured out Steve was there. But, assuming that Tiberius still didn't know about Tony's secret identity, he was definitely going to be underestimating Tony's ability to get himself out of his own hostage situation, which Tony already had to do every few months. Not a lot of people knew how good Tony was at hand-to-hand; Steve had trained Tony himself. Plus, Tony could remotely summon the armor if he really needed it.
Tony's clenching the edge of his work bench with all the strength in him. If he were Steve, it would break. "Maybe for
nervous. Steve could save the whole damn world twice a week without so much as breaking a sweat. But here he was, refusing to meet Tony's eyes.
kind. I sort of liked the idea of being a kept man. Your kept man." He sounds oddly wistful, longing -- like he knows he's joking but at the same time, some part of him honestly, truly wants that -- and it makes Steve's stomach do a somersault.
His tone suggests that he doesn't expect anything about him to make Steve happy, and Steve's not sure why. Steve loves him. Tony has to know that. Steve must be missing a few pieces of the puzzle.
But she didn't back down. "That's just it, Captain. How can you be trusted to be an impartial leader of the Avengers when you yourself admit to a certain partiality? Don't you think that, to the rest of us, it looks very much like the Avengers are closing ranks to protect one of their own?"
But whatever Steve had to ask him didn't seem to be an ordinary sort of question. Steve laid his hand on Tony's upper arm and gently chivvied him across the room, whereupon he pulled out a chair for Tony and another for himself, just opposite.
Steve's up by 0600 every morning, a rhythm well-trained into him, a familiar routine. But when he opens his eyes, the world around him is unfamiliar. He's stretched out on a couch, covered in a blanket, and at first he can't make sense of the towering shadows around him in the dimness. Then he blinks, and memory comes back to him as his vision resolves: he's in Mr. Stark's workshop. Those are Mr. Stark's machines. The clock on the wall reads 5:46, in bright red digits. Steve's still not used to these clocks.
He licks his lips, another reflex. He accidentally pokes his tongue with the edge of one of his fangs. He hates this.
is a bit of a misnomer, because Ghost has none. He's clad head-to-toe in featureless white armor, and his face is fully obscured. His body bristles with technology Steve can't identify, wires wrapped around his belt, running to various devices. No wonder he's one of Tony's villains. This sure isn't Steve's usual sort of mission.
Tony raised a hand and pointed at him, his finger stabbing into the air, but then his hand sagged back against the door. His throat worked as he swallowed hard. "I didn't ask you to defend me." The words sounded strangled, caught somewhere in his chest.
"Hey, Jan," Tony said, cheerfully. He grinned down at Steve. Steve couldn't quite hear Jan's half of the conversation. "Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. No, really." He smiled ruefully. "It's my fault Steve didn't get back to you. He didn't want to make it sound like it was my fault -- you know how he is, right? -- but it was absolutely my fault. I got myself knocked out and held captive. You know, a regular Monday, right?" He snorted. "I wasn't feeling too great afterwards. Wasn't really up for team company." He paused "Yeah, I know. Me too. I'm a lot better now, though." He nodded thoughtfully. "Oh, right. I asked Steve if I could stay over at his place in Brooklyn for the night, and I'm afraid I kept him up way past his bedtime. He just woke up a couple minutes ago."
"Well, I can," Carol said. "And Thor definitely can. I wish you could have told us to bring crutches but I guess the emergency beacon isn't that specific."
Tony's mouth quirked, like he'd made an amazing discovery. "Nice. Want to go for three?" he murmured.
"Everyone is fine," Steve said. The words sounded rehearsed, like Steve had been sitting here for hours planning what to tell him. Or maybe longer than that. And then he flashed a rueful grin and departed from the script. "Everyone except you, I mean. But you're going to be fine, too. It's Tuesday morning. You've been out for six days. You didn't miss Christmas," he added, which was thoughtful of him, because Tony had no idea what date it might have been. Math was currently beyond him. "You're at Columbia-Presbyterian. I didn't know if you had a hospital preference."
"Feels so good," Steve told him, and Tony grinned at him and repeated the motion, balancing the head of Steve's cock on his tongue like he knew how much Steve wanted to see that -- which was a lot. Steve moaned, and Tony kept going.
Tony drags the garbage can over and picks out the petals, one by one, hiding every shred of evidence, and then he disposes of the trash in the dumpster behind the dormitory. He takes a mostly-steady breath, ignoring the tickle in his throat. It's a secret.
The wind whips around Steve as he clings to Tony's armor with as much of him as he can manage. It's the fastest way to get to Tony's tower, and Tony assured him that he was flight-capable -- but it had been very much like what he'd said about the rest of the armor. Tony's not going to fall out of the sky, because Tony is on autopilot. Tony doesn't have to control the suit at all until he touches down.
"I'll have to make sure the villains get the memo," Steve says, and he realizes he's grinning back. "I'll let them all know to lay off."
"Better keep your eyes shut, Shellhead," Steve says, as he settles them both down against a nearby wall, Iron Man's head in his lap. "You can take the mask off later and clean your face. When I'm not here, I mean. I won't pry. I just want you to be okay."
It was night, and he was standing in the shadows, and as a further ode to attempted stealthiness he'd turned off every light in the armor, even the unibeam and the eye slits -- but Steve didn't even jump. Of course he didn't.
Tony raised his head. His eyes were glassy, and there were tears streaming down his face. He took a gasping breath.
"Tony--" Steve begins. He doesn't know what to say -- has he ever known? -- but he has to say something. Because this isn't right. This isn't like that.
"If you don't want this," Steve says, his voice rough, raspy, smoky from the flame burning inside his soul, "now would be a great time to leave the room."
Steve's face is burning. "Well," he says, wrong-footed, sheepish. "We both know I can't keep you in the style to which you're accustomed."
Then Tony stumbled and lost the rhythm entirely, misinterpreting the praise, trying to take him deeper. Tony's eyes were squeezed shut and his head dipped lower, taking in another inch or two of Steve's cock. Steve shuddered and tried to keep his wits about him, because, God, Tony's mouth was like heaven, but Steve was well aware that deep-throating him was not for beginners. This wasn't going to turn out well. He could feel Tony's mouth tense a little, Tony's tongue and throat tightening around the head of his cock, which felt, oh God,
It's a good thing that no one decides to attack New York the next day, because Steve's in no condition to fight. All he can think about, with mounting, pleasantly-nervous anticipation, is what's going to happen that night: Iron Man has some kind of plan, and Steve doesn't know what it is, but he's positive that he's going to like it. It's going to involve
And out there, behind the cops, was one of SHIELD's flying cars. Steve didn't know whose side the cops were on, but he knew whose side SHIELD was on.
He didn't have to know what to do. It was all right not to know. Tony wasn't going to expect him to know. Kissing worked the same, at least, and as for anything after that -- Steve had no idea what the rest of the night would hold, but he wasn't afraid. It was Tony, and he'd always trusted Tony, and Tony wasn't going to steer him wrong.
Tony wanted him. He knew that. But the thought of it, the fact of Tony just saying it, was new enough that hearing what Tony wanted to do about it was leaving him breathless, lightheaded with the possibility of it. And very, very hard.
At this rate this was looking to be the world's worst love confession. Flag Smasher was lumbering to his feet, and Steve, still wide-eyed and stunned, spun around and raised his shield high. Tony raised a hand. Nope. Repulsors still offline, and, ugh, half the suit servos too. He wasn't even going to be able to stand up like this. Steve was on his own. And, oh, God, Steve knew he was in love with him.
. It was strange, doubly so, because not only did Tony go to great pains to avoid talking about his childhood at all, he'd left Steve with the impression that he hadn't really had much in the way of actual friends from those days.
"Oh," Steve said, the sound small and somehow disappointed, and then he picked up his pizza again and didn't say anything else for the rest of the meal.
Steve had no idea what was happening. Even if Tiberius had an explanation, nothing about the situation was
"Easy," Tony said. "You're going to get more than this. I know exactly what you can take, so I fully intend to beat you black and blue because I know you'll be fine in six hours. But in the meantime, well, maybe your ass gets to match your uniform."
Tony sighs in unfeigned pleasure. "Oh, yeah, that's the ticket," he breathes. "You do that so well," he says, and the hand in Steve's hair lightens into a caress. "I'm just going to get some work done. You stay right where you are."
There's a pause, then; the words seem to hang between them in the air, echoing, pounding through Steve's head. He was right, he was right, he was so right and it's all wrong. Iron Man was just humoring him. Iron Man didn't have a good time. It's like being sixteen and scrawny again and knowing that no one is ever really going to like him back--
"I can ch-- I can ask Mr. Stark to change it," he offers, hastily, as if he were the one who had done it, as if he thinks he's made some kind of mistake here. "If you'd rather have something else, I mean."
If they could all just hold together, Steve thought, they could do this. They were a team. They'd always been a team. Tony didn't have to go it alone.
It was hard not to feel responsible. Tony knew Jan felt responsible, of course; this had all happened on her watch. But Tony felt more so. It had been his house. He was the engineer. He'd been responsible for the defense system. It never should have failed.
Huh. He wasn't expecting anyone. It couldn't be an Avengers emergency; they'd have used the identicard. Anyone who needed him for business-related reasons would also have called, and even then they really would have waited until morning; it was getting pretty late. And not a lot of people these days knew where he lived in New York. He'd filed it in the Avengers' records, but he didn't think he'd told anyone outside of the team. And the front desk wouldn't have let just anyone off the street up to see him, after all.
Mr. Stark looks like he wants to laugh and cry at the same time. "You'd think that, wouldn't you?" he murmurs to himself. "I know what it looks like," he continues, a little louder. "But, no. I'm not jealous."
It was rare to catch Tony off-guard with his own logic. Tony's mouth opened and shut. And then he smiled. "You-- you suspect that, huh?"
Tony exhaled hard, relaxing under Steve's fingers. He was starting to smile again, and in his eyes-- oh. That was love. That was what that was.
"Oh, is it?" Steve asked, amusement glinting in his eyes. It was a little bit of a dare. Clearly everything always was, with Steve.
Iron Man tilts his head to the side; his shoulders move slightly, a constricted shrug. "Eh, you know, it wasn't that special. An ordinary day for a superhero. It wasn't anything that anyone else wouldn't have done."
"Hey, it's okay," Steve murmured, as he led Tony back to the living room, back over to the couch. "I've got you. It's okay."
"Oh, he's fine," Mr. Stark says. The same thing Iron Man had said. "A little banged-up, but no permanent damage. Just some cuts and bruises. I patched him up too, before I started working on the suit. Don't worry about him."
"He's a liar," Steve retorted. "Every word out of his mouth was a lie. He's a liar and everything he said tonight, he said to hurt you, to get back at you, to harm you any way he could--"
Steve glances down at the rest of himself, and he doesn't look judgmental, but he still looks a little confused, like he isn't sure how to give Tony exactly what he wants. "All of it?" he asks. He sounds a little dubious, like he can't figure out how that works. Like he's still not quite sure this is what Tony really wants.
The lens was curved over Tony's eye. It looked, actually, a whole lot like the HUD interfaces for some of his armors, but Steve couldn't tell what this one was displaying, if anything.
"Thar's where you're wrong," Tony said, grinning, but he obligingly moved away a little, to give Steve room to wrench his boots off. "I feel I should inform you that everything you do is sexy, and that includes the time I watched you nearly drink paint water instead of coffee."
Mr. Stark's brow furrows. He takes off the safety glasses and leaves them folded on the table. Running his hand through his already-disheveled hair, he slides off the stool, lands a little too heavily, and then comes around to the side of the workbench, a little closer to Steve. He leans on the bench. His body language is open, inviting.
Slowly, he pulled Tony's briefs over his hips; Tony rocked pleasantly against him until he could free them entirely, and then Tony kicked them off and-- yeah, Tony was definitely very hard. His cock was heavy and dark, just as large as Steve had thought. He liked the size of him. Tony had trimmed the hair down there a little -- not shaved all the way off, but he'd clearly neatened everything up. Steve realized, a little self-consciously, that he hadn't. Had he been supposed to do that? Did other men care about that kind of thing?
Steve sure likes how that sounds, but he doesn't understand how any of this is possible. "But you have to wear the armor." He frowns. "That's what you said. You said you'd die without it."
He took a breath. He had to try to say this so Tony would believe it. He had to use the right arguments. He had to make the logic follow, from A to B to C. But he wasn't good at this. He wasn't smart the same way Tony was smart. He wasn't good at this, like Tony was. And he wasn't
"Yes, I do," Steve said, with every ounce of confidence in him. "I can't promise I'm going to be any good, but I can promise that."
The funny thing is, whenever people have asked Steve what he misses about the past, he's been tempted to answer
Steve's mouth is as hot as the rest of him. His kiss is deep, strong, and eager, as he licks into Tony's mouth. Tony moans and lets him take exactly what he wants, and Steve clutches him tighter and rubs frantically up against him like he's rapidly approaching not caring whether anyone manages to get their clothes off. Tony would much rather have Steve in him.
isn't really the right word, because, on one hand, he looks exactly like Steve expects him to look given that he is well into subspace, in a state where -- for him -- even the mildest correction can be vastly distressing. His mouth wobbles, and he looks like he's on the verge of tears, like if Steve refused this request it would absolutely shatter him. Knowing how Tony gets when he's under, Steve knows this cost Tony a lot to even ask. It's impressive that he can even think of trying to do this. It's a testament to his sense of duty. It's admirable, and Steve is somehow infuriated at him and proud of him at the same time.
Tony pushes himself up to sitting, reaches out, and pats Steve's cheek. "Glad to hear it." He unhooks the remains of the cuffs and boots and tosses them haphazardly in the direction of the floor, and then there's something sad and faraway in his eyes again. "The big thing that's left is the chestplate, but that's also where things get ugly, so I understand if this is enough for you."
Tiberius smiled broadly, and Steve knew that Tiberius had him exactly where he wanted him. They both knew it.
, he tells himself. If he can get through this, maybe it means the hard part will be easier than he thinks it is. He just wishes he knew for certain what Iron Man will say -- but, well, there's only one way to find that out.
Watching him, Steve licked his lips. "Do I-- do I get to see you now, Tony?" he asked. "I've been good. Haven't I been good?"
After several minutes of wrangling the entire team into the second Quinjet, Carol deposited Steve unceremoniously into the seat next to Tony. It was sweet of her.
He was right, because whatever he said about Tony, Tony would just roll over and take it. He had Tony wrapped around his finger. Tony wasn't going to think he was doing anything wrong. Not now, not ever.
Mr. Stark fixes his armor. Mr. Stark keeps him alive. So what does he have against his own bodyguard?
Steve's laughing too. "I don't know how well that'll work out. Flag-Smasher will probably decide that my birthday is the perfect time to remind us all that he doesn't approve of the existence of countries."
Tony laughed against Steve's collarbone; the sound had a knife-edge of hysteria. His hand, gripping Steve's shoulder, was white-knuckled. "I'm sorry," he said, desperately. "I'm so sorry, Steve, I was wrong and I'm so, so sorry--"
Tony took a deep breath. "Okay. So this all started maybe seven, eight months ago. I'd been asked to do some consulting work on an AI project, helping map and decode an artificial intelligence that S-- uh, the person who had it couldn't access." Tony's face went through about four different expressions and they were all increasingly bad, and Steve had no idea what any of that meant. "Anyway, long story short, it turned out that Sun-- I mean, my client, she was keeping Jocasta against her will, and had intended to coerce her into running weapons systems. And I'd been hired because she knew I was familiar with Jocasta's code and could get Jocasta running again, but she thought she could, uh." Tony made another face. "She thought she could distract me from figuring out that it was Jocasta I was working on. Didn't work. So I broke Jocasta out, obviously. I wasn't just going to leave her there."
Steve had thought -- naively, perhaps -- that Tony would be content to let him take the lead. He was delighted to be proved wrong, as Tony turned his face against Steve's hand, kissed his palm, and then began kissing slowly along Steve's upturned wrist, his lips trailing delicately over Steve's inner arm. Steve heard himself gasp, a wordless little sound. There was a familiar surge of heat gathering within him, the beginnings of arousal. What was unfamiliar was the fact that he didn't have to suppress it, repress it, wish it away, pretend it wasn't happening. It was all right, now. It was all right to be here, like this, to want a man, to want Tony. It was better than all right, even -- Tony would want to know. It would make Tony happy to know that Steve was enjoying this.
"It's not too late to stop," Tiberius pleaded. "Please. You're a good man, Tony. You have a good heart. You don't want to hurt me. You don't really want to do this. Have mercy."
gorgeous mess," he said, with hope in his voice, and even though Tony tried to tell himself Steve couldn't mean it the way Tony thought he did, his heart beat faster at the words.
He turned right on red -- which, honestly, was probably the least of his sins at this point -- onto West 47th, and he didn't bother slowing down as he leaned into the turn. He was too fast, the turn too tight for his speed. He was cornering so hard that for a dizzying few seconds he thought he might actually come off the bike altogether in the middle of the damn intersection. He could picture his body skidding limp and broken across the pavement. He held his breath and he held tight as the bike shook beneath him and he tried desperately to find his center of gravity again. At the last possible moment, in this span of seconds that lasted an eternity of pounding heartbeats, he managed to straighten up.
But, well, Tony's pretty sure he only gets to do this particular thing once, and he'll be damned if he doesn't at least try to have exactly what he wants. Steve's definitely going to get exactly what he wants, so why shouldn't Tony?
Steve's hospital room is next to Tony's. That's really the only good thing about this entire situation.
"It'll keep," Tony said, as he cracked one egg and then another into the pan. He leaned over, dug into the breadbox, and stuck a couple slices of bread in the toaster. "You're more important."
A brief tangle of emotion, too fast for Steve to identify, darkened Tony's face and then fled, subsumed by a cheerful smile. Steve had no idea what that was all about, but it didn't look good. But at least-- at least Tony was smiling.
Steve was still crouching at his side, and now, in a reversal of irony, Tony was the one distracting him. He hadn't seen Flag Smasher starting to move, returning to consciousness, rising up behind him.
Picking up one of Steve's hands, Tony guides it to one of the metal pads on his hips. "These first."
"Hey," Steve says, gently, and Tony turns his head late, running on what feels like a seven-second broadcast delay. Tony's eyes are soft and dreamy again. Steve tosses him the underwear; he doesn't catch it. "You're going to want these first."
The guard scoffed. "Yeah, I can fuckin' see that. But there's no visitors allowed. The boss is busy."
He watched Steve's chest rise and fall and rise again, and then he swung out with the crop, hitting him on the exhale, on the sweet spot where his ass met his thigh. It was one of the compensations of his profession -- or perhaps avocation, because he'd still never quite worked out where superheroing fell on that scale -- that Tony had very, very,
It wasn't just that he wanted Tony to love him. It wasn't even that he wanted to be special to Tony. He knew both of those things were true, and would still have been true even if Tony hadn't loved me first. It was something else entirely.
Tony's hand promptly cupped Steve's balls, caressing him, and, God, that was so good. He was almost there. It was what he did for himself, a lot of the time; he'd always liked the feeling, and now it was driving him closer and closer to the peak, every scrap of sensation in him focused just
thing." That was nice to hear. Tony was grinning. "I just," he said in wonder. "I just. You want me?"
The question had probably been supposed to sound like a joke, but Steve knew Tony well enough to know that it hadn't been a joke at all.
knew that. Maybe they didn't know that Tony was Iron Man, but they definitely knew that Iron Man and Captain America were inseparable -- and, for that matter, that Tony and Captain America were pretty good friends, as well. What did it matter if Tony didn't love him like he wanted Tony to love him? What did it matter if he was never going to know what it would be like to kiss him? What did it matter if he was never going to be the fella Tony took home with him? What did it matter if he was never going to learn how it would feel to wake up at Tony's side every morning?
Steve could feel his face heating up. They both knew he should have been better than this. "Um," he said. "Warbird, actually."
"I know," Steve said, a little guiltily, before Tony even had to say it. "Believe me, I know. I do understand. They asked me about pain management. And I gave them permission. I know you don't want it. But you didn't see how bad it was." His mouth wobbled, and he looked like he was about to cry again. "It was that or-- or being
Tony hisses between his teeth, plucks the packet from Steve's fingers, and rips it open himself. "Give me your right hand."
"Don't be," Iron Man says, the words full of heartfelt intensity, and Steve can see a flash of teeth behind the mouth slit that might be a smile. "Don't you dare be sorry. That was wonderful. I just-- I just--" He sighs. "I shouldn't ask this -- God, I'm just going to-- it's just going to make it worse--" He pauses, clearly torn. "Would you do something for me? You don't-- you don't have to."
"No problem," she said. "What are friends for, huh?" She stepped back and looked around the room. "I guess I'd better let you get back to packing."
Tony didn't even blink. "The entire superhero community already knows I'm Iron Man," Tony said. His tone was even, level, calm. "That's a lot of people. So I can't imagine it'll make much of a difference if the entire world knows. It can't make me look worse. At this point, it might even make me look better."
This piques Tony's interest. Tony loosens his grip on Steve, and when he puts his head up there's curiosity in his gaze and a flicker of delight, as if just by asking Steve has given him a gift. For Tony, Steve's question is a puzzle -- and there's not much in the world that Tony likes better than a good puzzle.
Tony slowly opened his eyes. Raising his head, he blinked, then his gaze focused on Steve, and he smiled, wide and pleased. He was actually clutching Steve a little tighter. He obviously didn't want to let Steve go for any reason.
Iron Man's gaze drops; he's staring down at his own hands. And then he does a curious thing: he sets two fingers to the thickened edge of the gauntlet on his other hand, to the band of crimson metal halfway down his arm. And then he does something Steve can't quite make out, an intricate movement of his fingers. There's a quiet click, and then the entire gauntlet starts to... retract? The striated metal begins to fold in on itself, as the whole gauntlet, repulsor node and all, draws itself backwards and up into the cuff, and Steve is left staring at Iron Man's hand.
That, unfortunately, really reminded him of the old days. He was so glad he didn't have to worry about keeping the chestplate charged anymore.
Helpless, Tony came, hard, his world blacking out as the pleasure took him over, as he fell into the night and through the other side. When he opened his eyes, Steve was even more of a come-spattered mess, but Steve was smiling lazily up at him, and Tony figured he should get off him before he fell over.
Carol muttered an obscenity under her breath, took two steps forward and then launched herself off the landing into the air, in flight the rest of the way, skimming over the steps. She set herself down next to Steve, on the step he was on, and as Steve watched, miserable, she laid one black-gloved hand on his arm. She was kind. She'd always been kind. But it wasn't going to help.
He was going to have to do something about that. About his own secret. But not right now. Not yet. Because right now, Tony was coming home with him.
With his other friends, the friendship had been gradual. Even the friends who'd been his partners. He'd always liked Sam, and they'd always worked well together, but it taken them a bit of time to go from acquaintances to friends. The part where he hadn't been in his own body when they'd met had probably been a bit of a setback. Sam was in his pictures, of course, but gradually: a few at the beginning, and then a little more frequently. They'd had to work up to friendship, he supposed. They hadn't started with the blurry Polaroid of him and Sam and Josh Cooper, arms tipsily around each other's shoulders, laughing, a pitcher of sangria on the table in front of them. And that was fine. That was normal. That was how friendship worked. That was how it was supposed to work.
Tony's breath rattles in Steve's ears and yeah, he's still crying under the armor. There's a quiet sob over the comms. Something inside Steve clenches up. Tony's still suffering, and he still can't do anything about it.
He still had to figure out who this box belonged to, and he had one last chance for an answer. Maybe the final item would explain it all and help him find the owner.
"So," Iron Man says, like the word is a sentence in and of itself. "I should probably mention that Mr. Stark controls merchandising rights for the Avengers, and sometimes companies send him samples of products they'd like him to approve."
That's not a very Captain America thought for Steve to have, but Ghost ruined his goddamn anniversary, so he thinks that Steve Rogers, the man under the cowl, is allowed to be just a little bitter. Steve rocks back and shifts his weight, continuing to stand up--
Tony just stares. Eyebrows still raised, he sprawls back onto Steve's pillows, artfully, like he wouldn't know how not to be graceful if he tried.
They left Tigra on the seventh floor, and then Tony, Steve, and Thor headed up one last creaky, frozen escalator to what was presumably the site of their impending battle.
From Steve's vantage point, only Tiberius' back was visible. And while Tony had obviously showered and dressed, Tiberius hadn't. He was wearing a robe. It was one of Tony's robes.
So if Tiberius was telling Tony everything he wanted to hear and Steve was telling him nothing he wanted to hear, it was obvious which of them Tony was going to trust. Tiberius had had a point.
"Please, yes, please, yours," Steve gasped, and then Steve's cock jerked in Tony's hand and he was coming, coming all over Tony's hand, Tony's cock, his own trembling stomach, and it was the hottest thing Tony had ever seen.
Steve nodded. "I'm so glad it was me," he said. And then he realized what he actually meant. "Because I'm glad that first it was something
Iron Man's gaze flicks downward to Steve's lap. Steve regrets wearing sweatpants. He's usually in his uniform around Iron Man, and the thick padding of his uniform pants usually does a decent job concealing any... excitement. Maybe Iron Man literally hadn't noticed before -- it's possible, and it would definitely explain why he hasn't said anything -- but Steve sure can't hide anything now.
Tony shook his head. "Not the way I count it." His gaze went distant. "When I was seven, my father sent me to boarding school. I was soft, he said. I was sensitive. It would toughen me up. It took me years to figure out what he'd actually seen in me. What everybody saw in me. I was a kid. I didn't
"You sure don't make it easy on a guy, do you?" Tony murmurs, under his breath, but he sounds ridiculously fond when he says it.
"No, I want to," Steve says. He's always thought Tony needs to hear it again, how much he loves him, how much he wants him, how much he wants to make him happy. If he says it often enough, maybe Tony will begin to believe him. "I just can't figure out the best angle."
Tony's shocked, saddened face floated in front of Steve's eyes, and he blinked to clear his vision. That wasn't going to help.
If Iron Man couldn't ever get off on it, or if Iron Man just didn't want someone to touch him -- that would be one thing. Iron Man would be offering all he wanted, and then Steve might consider it equitable, because they'd both be fulfilled, one way or the other. But if Iron Man can't have what he wants, then Steve would be leaving him hanging, and that's obviously unfair.
He knows he should probably protest more, but Iron Man's embrace is warm and soft, and Steve just wants to stay here forever.
"There you go," Tony says, approvingly, as Steve slides off his underwear and kicks it away. "Feels better, huh? I feel better too."
"I was never meant to join the Ultimates, in the beginning," Tony says, and Steve doesn't quite understand why he's started all the way back there, but that's why Tony's the genius. "You know that, right?" Tony continues, like he's giving a lecture and needs to gauge the audience's understanding. "I was meant to be a tech liaison for SHIELD. I was never meant to be the guy in the suit. It wasn't like Fury ever turned me down, mind you. That wasn't how it worked. He didn't have the chance. My name just... never came up. Because why would you send" -- he gestures at himself -- "your billionaire engineer to do a job any grunt could do?" He coughs. "No offense, darling."
Tony gave the box an experimental shake. It didn't sound like there was much more in there. A few smaller things, probably. One of them was wholly metal -- and not vibranium, to judge by the sound it made against the walls of the box. He supposed he'd find out soon.
. I can't stop thinking about what he did. I keep seeing him over and over. Nothing feels safe at all."
Steve didn't know if anyone else would have been able to tell, but Tony had left the bedroom door open and Steve's hearing was very, very good. Every couple of minutes, Tony sighed noisily, and the covers rustled as he turned over again, obviously trying to get comfortable. His breathing hadn't yet slowed into the rhythms of sleep.
He took a deep breath and pushed all the fear away. He was on a mission now. He had to stay calm. He couldn't let himself worry about Tony's condition right now. He'd do what had to be done. He had to believe that Tony was alive. He had to keep believing that. He'd start by paying Tiberius a visit. Chances were good that Tony was still there, after all, and unconscious -- because if Tiberius had taken Tony elsewhere and had known enough to divest Tony of Iron Man's identicard first, that was a very bad sign. Tiberius had already shown that he was willing to murder Iron Man. So Steve was just going to assume that that hadn't happened yet.
As usual, Tony is halfway across the apartment, gesturing wildly and talking a mile a minute. "So how about I get some protein into you before you leave? I make a mean omelette. Or, if you have, uh, other needs you'd like some help with, I'm definitely not opposed to taking you to bed--"
"Likewise," Steve replies, a little stunned. He hadn't expected Iron Man to go to all this trouble for him.
Steve watches Ghost pick out the keys one at a time, typing one-handed. The metal keys click heavily as he presses them. The sound has a certain ominous finality.
As the elevator kept rising, Steve pulled out his identicard one last time. Still no movement from Tony. As far as Steve could tell from the distances involved, Tony -- or rather, his identicard -- wasn't right next to the elevator, but the signal was decently close. It probably in a nearby room. At least he wouldn't have to go far.
But this time, Tony wasn't even playing along. He didn't wince. He didn't chuckle. He just looked thoughtful, like he hadn't even heard. He looked... happy, almost. Like thinking about this guy made him happy. "All those CEOs with all their points in Charisma, you mean?"
"Thanks, Shellhead!" Steve calls back, as he pushes himself to his feet again and leaps back into the fray.
" Tony yells, hoarse with fear. He's on external speakers now. A small part of Steve is grateful that he doesn't have a secret identity anymore, because Tony's clearly not in any condition to keep secrets.
Steve just grinned at him, pushed off the doorframe, and took a step forward. "You're a real sweet-talker, huh? You want to marry me?"
," Steve said, finally. "Not like you're implying. He just seemed-- for a couple seconds, he just seemed... off. Like there was something about him that wasn't right. Like it was all a put-on. But it wasn't much. Just a feeling." He shrugged helplessly. "I wasn't really a fan of how he told me I wasn't rich enough to be in his presence."
Iron Man sighs heavily. "You want to know something else I've never told anyone?" Behind the mask, his eyes fall shut. "I haven't slept with anyone since the accident. The cardiac damage affected, uh." He pauses delicately. "A lot of things. I mostly can't even-- I can't stay-- even when I'm by myself, I still can't get--" He stops again. He presses his palms against his legs in obvious dismay. His thighs clearly aren't covered in armor. Steve needs to stop thinking about touching him. "I'm sorry. I really am. But I can't do it."
He drapes a towel over Tony's ass, not because it's off-limits -- honestly, Steve will probably get there eventually -- but because the towels are warm and soft, and Tony will be more comfortable if Steve is covering the parts of him that he isn't currently working on. He won't get as cold, that way.
"Oh, no, no!" Steve hastens to assure him. "Nothing like that! Iron Man's amazing. Nothing's wrong at all."
"Are you going to tell me what you know?" Steve repeats. "Are you going to let me in on whatever the deep dark secret is that you think will ruin Iron Man for me forever? Where's your list of reasons, Mr. Stark?" He can feel his mouth twitching, twisting, trying to smile. It's not a nice smile. "You know what they say, right?
He wonders what the hell Tony wears when he thinks someone else is actually going to be looking; he suspects he might not survive the answer.
"I want this," Tony told him. "I want this so much. I told myself it couldn't be you, but, God, Steve, if you only knew how many years I've spent trying not to think about you like this..."
"We were only together for a month or two, back then," Tony continued. "I was so happy. But you know what the hell of it is? I told myself I was doing good. I told myself that Ty was grieving, and that he needed me, and that I was helping him. That this was what he needed. I thought I was being kind. But now I know he was laughing at me all along. He was probably laughing at how stupid I was, how he'd tricked me, how I had no idea he'd murdered his own parents to-- to get back at me. He'd beaten me, he'd deceived me, and, hey, he even got free orgasms out of the deal. Somewhere to put his dick. He was using me. Literally."
"Yeah," Steve said. "Brian Falsworth and Roger Aubrey. Union Jack and the Mighty Destroyer. They were together the entire time I knew them; they'd been together for years. Best friends their whole damn lives, too. I didn't meet Roger until we got him out of Nazi mind control. And Brian was so damn happy to have him back. They were in love. We all knew it. So, yeah, I've had gay teammates. For years, actually."
"Seriously, though," Steve said. His mouth twitched, and he was starting to redden again. "One of the things I wasn't about to tell my good buddy Shellhead while I was asking him out was the fact that I
In the light, Tony looked even more exhausted than he had half an hour ago. He'd taken his shoes off, but he'd clearly been trying to sleep in the remains of the suit he'd been wearing. His shirt was rumpled, his pants creased, and he hadn't even taken his belt off.
He sits down at his desk, takes a few fortifying breaths, and then nudges his computer awake. The internet has rings. The internet will either sell him rings or know where he can buy them. The internet cannot possibly fail him this time.
It was an old, old reason. Steve knew Tony was right about that. He bit back the familiar flare of anger. This wasn't about him. This had never been about him, not really. This was about Tony's fear. After all this time, Steve couldn't quite believe that Tony would still think Steve's first impulse was to scratch him from the team. Why was Tony's deepest fear that Steve wouldn't want him around?
If Tony was anything in this life he was an engineer first and foremost. Someone who liked to take things apart, figure them out, solve every problem they contained. You couldn't hand him a box and not expect him to want to open it. It was like sitting him in front of a button that said
Tony's gaze was still distant. "I always liked it too, honestly. I liked it a hell of a lot more before last night, though." His eyes fell briefly shut. "Because who was I going to tell about this revelation other than my best friend in the entire world, right?"
"Come on, then," Tony said, with an encouraging smile. "Sit down, Cap. I'll fry you up a couple of eggs."
"Do I ever," Steve said, and, oh God, that was his body clenching around the plug, trying to fuck himself when he couldn't move to get enough stimulation. "Dreamed about seeing you like this for a long time." Steve's smile was soft. "Who's the beautiful one now, huh?"
tell." He licked his lips, a convulsive motion. "You know everything else. Anyone else, I'd have to explain the drinking, or my father, or-- or the queer thing, and you know already. And honestly, I don't think I'm brave enough right now to come out to anyone else. I didn't even manage to tell you, did I?"
"This is DreamVision," Tiberius said, proudly. "If you want to win gold in the Olympics, you can! ViaStone will provide the programming, and you can do anything your heart desires. Right now, this is what our lovely volunteer is experiencing. She feels just like she's there. She can be whoever she wants to be, feel whatever she wants to feel. But it doesn't end with ice skating, of course."
"You wouldn't hesitate to bench any Avenger if you thought it was the right thing to do, even someone you were dating," Tony retorted. "You'd do what was best for the team."
was. Tony was a full-time CEO and a full-time superhero -- as well as the landlord, ostensible employer, resident engineer, and quartermaster of an entire superhero team. He had more demands on his time than Steve could possibly conceive of. Tony's calendar was booked months in advance. Steve knew that much. Anyone else who wanted to see Tony, anyone ordinary who wanted to see Tony -- well, they had to wait their turn, didn't they? They all waited weeks. Months, maybe. Just to spend maybe half an hour in Tony's presence. But not Steve. No, he was Tony's teammate. He was Tony's roommate. He lived in Tony's house, for crying out loud. He got to see Tony nearly every day. He was one of Tony's closest friends. Tony, in fact, carved out a hell of a lot of time just to see him. Him, specifically. Was Steve really going to sulk and mope because that wasn't
His feet carried him all the way across the mansion's first floor and into the library. He'd always liked the library. It was quiet, serene, lit by sconces, full of comfortable, overstuffed furniture. He'd liked it from the beginning, because at first to him it felt like it probably hadn't been a room that had changed a lot since his day. Familiar. Known.
"Admittedly," Tony said, and he, caught up in his reasoning, wasn't even looking at Steve, "I'm not really clear on
He takes a slow, shaking breath. He counts to three. He exhales. He shouldn't be this nervous, should he? This isn't even the hard part.
The air in front of Mordo's midsection glowed green, and Tony hastily killed his left-hand repulsors, hooked his gauntleted fingers into the back of Steve's shield harness, and threw them both sideways, just in time.
, obviously, Tony thought, as he admired Steve run -- was that they'd fought together so long that at this point they barely had to say anything.
Carol wasn't there. She'd pulled up out of the dive and was floating a couple feet away from him, her hands up, palms out. Groggily, he processed this as surrender. It wouldn't have been a surrender from Tony.
"I know," Tony says, softly. "I know." Tony's still shaking, even in the armor. "I actually don't have all that much more in me right now," he adds, like it's paining him to admit. "And I know it's not quite over yet. You think you can do all the talking when SHIELD gets up here?"
"So this question can't be any weirder than that one," Carol said, "but do you want me to keep an eye on him for you?" She knotted her fingers together. "I mean, I would anyway, but, you know. For you."
There was a fluttery feeling in Steve's stomach, tension but actually good. A little bit of nerves, a lot of anticipation. "I think that'd be swell," Steve said. This late at night, his old accent sometimes found its way back.
He swallowed hard, hoped his face was impassive, and looked up. Carol was at the top of the stairs heading down, in full Avengers uniform. She was probably next up on the monitors. He'd forgotten about the shift change. Damn.
Tony was saying something to Radioactive Man that the news crew's mics weren't picking up. He was holding up his armored hands, which was the sort of thing he remembered to do around people who didn't know what he actually did to be non-threatening. He was probably asking Radioactive Man to put his boyfriend down.
But Tony didn't answer the question. "I think I should start from the beginning." He picked up his mug again and stared off into the distance. "This wasn't anything I wanted. I mean, of course I didn't want this" -- he gestured at his chest -- "but I meant, more generally. The Sentient Armor. I wasn't trying to make any of it happen. This wasn't like Hank's AI experiments." No one was ever going to be able to forget Ultron. "In fact, I've had safeguards against sentience built into my armor for years for that exact reason. I wasn't interested in being the guy who built the second Ultron, you know?" His laugh was dry. "Turned out my safeguards weren't all that safe. Because, despite my best efforts, I, uh. I essentially
Tony was smiling again, which was when Steve realized, too late, that what he'd said made it sound like he'd meant to agree to Tony's offer.
"Yeah." Tony's voice was bland, his expression unreadable. "I got the idea when you tried to kill me."
"Oh, that's nice," Tony murmured, all in a rush, a whisper that seemed to be directed at his tea. He hadn't drunk any yet; he was clearly just enjoying the warmth.
"Right here in River City," Tony sang, under his breath. "With a capital T, and that rhymes with--" and as he spoke, one of the holographic displays flickered to life, displaying the face of their latest adversary. He faltered. "And that rhymes with, uh, B, and that stands for... um... Baron Mordo?"
"A brand new day," Steve echoed, and he reached up and took Tony's hand in his and, yeah, Tony could live with that.
Amazingly, Iron Man can actually spare some time for him during the day, and even more amazingly, they end up in the East Village for a late lunch. Iron Man can't eat in the armor, but he insists there's a pizza place that Steve absolutely has to try.
"You can't talk me out of loving you," Steve murmurs. "You can't. I'm already here. You've got me. If it hurts, then it hurts. But I don't think it will. I'm yours. For as long as you want me."
"That's what he says," Steve retorted. "How do you know it's true? He invited himself to the show that he knew I was appearing on, to talk to me, to rebut everything that I said. That sounds an awful lot like
Undoing his tie as he walked, Tony maneuvered around the empty tables and collapsed into the chair next to Steve, the one the art-loving woman had occupied, and he scooted himself a little closer. "Long night, huh, Winghead?" he murmured, with a smile.
The woman settled into the recliner, and Steve watched as Tiberius grabbed a handful of wires from the computer desk, and then another handful from the... television? He plugged them into what looked like medical electrodes, then positioned the electrodes on the woman's face. There was also a long piece of plastic tubing, like part of an IV. Steve couldn't quite see where Tiberius had put it; it was on the woman's far side. Tiberius slipped some kind of eyepiece over one of her eyes; it curved around her head, hooking over her ear like half a pair of glasses. It reminded Steve of that night, a long time ago, when he couldn't sleep and had wandered downstairs to the workshop to find Tony burning the midnight oil. Tony had taken apart one of his suits for him so Steve would be as familiar as possible with how the systems all worked; Steve thought there had been lenses like this inside the helmet, to interface with the computers. But what in God's name was the
But soon enough, they've got Ghost -- who is still unconscious -- out of here. He'll probably wake up in the Raft, and that's fine by Steve. Maybe he'll stay there. One of the painfully-eager young agents runs upstairs to take care of Ghost's grappling hook, and then another one runs outside and comes back with the pieces of the drive Steve dropped out the window, just so no one can try to run data recovery. Steve promises that he'll tell Tony he needs to call Damage Control; luckily, Iron Man is still in the room. He agrees to everything. Yes, he'll send copies of the official reports. He just wants them gone.
Bending down, he started to read through the spines on the shelf below, and then he stopped, staring at a slim paperback. That-- that one had potential. And he was willing to bet that neither Tony nor Tiberius would have been caught dead reading it.
Iron Man's fingers knot together, twisting up in anxiety. "I know I'm not anyone you really want," Iron Man says, hoarsely. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry that I can't be someone who actually makes you happy."
"I could, though." Iron Man repeats the offer, a little less hesitantly. "I would. If you wanted me to." He blows out a breath; it whistles through the mouth-slit. "I did mean it when I said I wanted you. Quite a lot. You just can't-- I'd rather you not try to reciprocate."
But it's not over. A scrap of half-remembered information drifts through his mind, Tony telling him about the first time he ever fought Ghost: Ghost couldn't be invisible and intangible at the same time. And if that's still true, then Ghost can't phase out of here without being seen, and if he opens a door while invisible Steve will certainly hear him. Ghost isn't going to be able to get off this floor, as long as Steve can track him.
Steve just gave him a look, the one Tony saw sometimes when Steve thought he'd said something wrong but wasn't pushing it. And it was weird for Steve to not push it, but, well, he had other concerns right now. Steve shifted his weight on the bed, gasping as the plug slid within him.
"Right," Steve says, weary, exhausted, as Ghost lies motionless and empty-handed on the floor. Steve's got places to be. Boyfriends to cuddle. At least now it's finally over. He starts to push himself to his feet. "I hope that now we've all learned that crime doesn't--"
"Yeah," Steve said. "Yeah, of course, I'd love that." Eager, he was halfway to untucking his shirt when he had a better idea. "You want to help, or you just want to watch? Either's fine, but you can-- you can touch me if you want. It's allowed. Encouraged, actually."
The oddest transformation happens to the man's face then; he slips on a bright, charming smile, like charisma is something he can wear, and despite knowing that it's happening, Steve is still drawn in.
Mr. Hogan -- Happy? -- grins broadly into the mirror. "Whatever you say, b--" Oddly, his mouth snaps shut and he frowns. "Uh. Iron Man."
That, Steve noticed, wasn't the same thing as saying yes. "I know," Steve said, softly. "I know I've seen the scars. But I also know you never wanted me to. And if it's going to make you the slightest bit uncomfortable or worried at all, to have me looking at them again, I don't want to do that to you. The scars don't matter to me, but it's not my opinion that counts. It's yours. So if it matters to you, then I'd like to respect that." That was something Tiberius had probably never said to Tony. "It's okay to draw a line here. I want to give you exactly what you want, and that also means nothing you don't want."
And then, gently, he nudged Tony's shoulder. "Hey, Shellhead," he said, softly. "Can you let me up for a second? I need to get my phone. I'll come right back, I promise."
"That's the other thing," Steve said, eyes downcast. "I'm-- I'm not a good sub. I don't want you to go getting your hopes up, because most people who scene with me don't want to come back for a second round."
It's nice like this, all fucked out, just letting Steve use him. Tony's just a little too sensitive like this, and he loves that feeling too, Steve overwhelming him with his touch, with his body. Steve's gripping Tony's hips tight, rocking Tony with him as he fucks into him, harder and harder. He lifts Tony up a little more and then he's in
"AIM happened," Tony said. "You remember, there were missiles? I think you got knocked out by the missile impact, which is what you get for not wearing your seatbelt. Then I had to put the jet down somewhere, which wasn't easy, but." He half-smiled. "I think this is the part where you're supposed to say
The hardwood floor isn't the softest surface Steve's ever crawled over, but that's not important. His uniform is thick enough to protect him from most of it. And that's not good; the fact that he's wearing the uniform, that he's moving like he might move on a mission, is impinging on his consciousness again, threatening to bring him back to a state of mind where it wouldn't be okay that any of this is happening.
It can't be his heart. Iron Man said that was an injury. An accident. That wouldn't be something that could affect a child of his.
Steve can't help but think about Iron Man's mysterious secrets, the things that both Mr. Stark and Iron Man have said should put him off Iron Man for good.
"It's okay," Tony says, softly. "I don't think I'll be... up for much, though," he adds, delicately, and Steve's glad Tony can think straight enough again that he's not just going to say yes. Maybe he can't stand up, but he can still stand up to Steve. "But that doesn't mean you can't have a good time, in whatever form you'd like. I'd be happy to make sure you're... seen to. I, um. I really like knowing how much you want me," he says, his expression raw and open, unguarded in a way Steve knows he wouldn't let himself be in the light of day. "It does a lot for me. Even if I'm not getting off. It just feels good," he says, helplessly, like he has no words to describe the feeling. Steve knows what he means, though. "Good inside my head. Satisfying. I don't know. So, really, if you, uh,
"You did it exactly right," Tony says. "You know how you always tell me that? Well, you did it right too. You did exactly what I needed you to do. There's nothing to apologize for."
"Like that," Steve breathed. The pace was just right, the pressure light enough to be a tantalizing tease, the way he sometimes liked to work himself up, knowing it wasn't quite enough to push him over the edge. And then he realized this really wasn't enough. It wasn't how he wanted it at all. He didn't want Tony to tease him. He wanted everything. "You can-- just a little tighter-- oh--"
Iron Man could, in theory, be an android. It's not like Steve's never met androids -- he was proud to count Jim Hammond as a fellow Invader, no different than anyone else -- but he thinks an android probably wouldn't want an armored suit unless they were already built into one. And Iron Man doesn't talk much about himself, but he definitely has the basic physical needs of a human. Steve's seen him drinking all sorts of beverages, a straw jammed into the mouth-slit of his mask. So. Probably not an android.
Tony's smile was more than a little misty; he looked like he might start crying again out of happiness. And then he wrapped himself around Steve and kissed him, kissed him again and again like he was just so grateful for all of this, for being here, for Steve. Steve understood the feeling.
sex life just to make me miserable. I think he's too selfish for that. So I don't think he lied about not having a good time. I think he truly didn't like sleeping with me. I think I'm actually, genuinely bad at this. So, I mean, I understand if you don't want me to, now that you know--"
be something." It was a joke, because of course Tony couldn't help with that. Steve just needed to heal up.
"Hell, yes," Tony said. He was actually grinning now, his face bright with relief. A disproportionate amount of relief. "Please. If you want. If-- if that's okay with you."
When he turned around, Tony was standing next to him, and he startled. He hadn't even heard Tony stand up. Geez. He was tired too.
But it wasn't like he could fight this fear with logic. He'd tried. And he was still here. In a mask.
He wasn't really that mad; he'd needed to up his game anyway. But it was going to be harder to get her to the mat if she wasn't going to stay on the damn ground.
"Shhh, it's okay, I don't need it like that," he murmured, and he reached down and tapped Tony's cheek to get his attention. "Not that deep. I just meant, what you were doing before, with your tongue higher up, that was great. More of
You wouldn't know it to look at Steve -- or so he flatters himself by thinking, even as he suspects that he is probably much more obvious than he thinks he is -- but he's a sentimental kind of guy. And six months, well, that's pretty big, isn't it?
"So," Jan said, as they all stood in what once had been the mansion basement, looking all the way up to the hole that went through the roof. Sunshine streamed down, making dust motes dance. "Do you want the good news or the bad news?"
After Molecule Man. Before Tony had started drinking again. It had been a narrow sliver of time. Steve had been so happy. He thought Tony had been, then, too.
"No," Tony says, in Steve's ear. His voice is hoarse, and his affect is all wrong; there's somehow too much feeling in the word and too little all at the same time. "No, I'm not okay. It's wrong inside my head." His speech is slow and labored. "I feel-- upset. Unreal. Alone. Alone and it hurts."
"Well, when I was getting dressed," Steve begins, as he sets his now-empty plate on the coffee table, "I was looking in my nightstand to see if I had a watch or anything, and I found a... device? It looks like a fancy little clock, maybe? But with a photograph on it."
"Hey, Cap!" Hank said, cheerfully. "I didn't see you over there before. Sorry. Have you been here this whole time?"
Steve takes a breath -- and then he realizes, as Tony stares back at him, his eyes wide and dazed, that he can't yell at Tony for what he's done. Right now, Tony can't handle him being angry, and Tony's just volunteered himself for a job that's going to take everything he has just to hold himself together.
Did Steve seriously think Tony didn't want to savor every last whimper? "Put that away, then," Tony said. "This place is soundproofed, and I want to hear you."
whose father ever hit him," Steve clarified, as carefully as he could. He was dizzy. His voice was too loud in his ears. He'd never told anyone. Not about this. Hell, Tony was one of the few people who even knew his father had had a drinking problem.
"Yeah," Steve said, when he trusted himself to be able to speak, to be able to make sure his face and his voice wouldn't give him away. "I was jealous, a bit, at the beginning. It wasn't-- it wasn't very admirable of me. I didn't like him." Maybe Tony wouldn't notice if Steve didn't tell him why. "So I tried to get over it. I tried to be happy for you. I thought he was good for you, because he made you so happy. But then I watched it all go wrong. And I know you don't believe me, but it's the truth. He's hurting you."
Tony's mouth thinned and his gaze went somewhere far away. "Boy, was she ever." His lips twisted even more, almost a frown; it was as bad as his public face ever got, and if he was showing it this much, his actual feelings were far worse. "Why do you ask?"
Tony's had a hell of a night and Steve's not actually here professionally. So he doesn't push as hard as he might. He just moves on to the next spot, giving it equal attention, and Tony lets out a heavy sigh, like he was definitely in at least some discomfort but hadn't wanted to bring it up.
Mr. Stark holds up his left hand, with the back of his hand facing Steve. Several unpleasant-looking scars mar his skin; he looks like he once had a fight with a blowtorch and lost. Then he wiggles his bare ring finger, illustratively, and that's when Steve gets it.
So Steve smiled and resisted the impulse to run his fingers across Tony's tense jawline. "Hey, Shellhead," he murmured. "There you are."
Tony's smile was brilliant, and then he took a breath like he was steeling himself to say something. "I'd really like to go down on you. If you'd like that."
The cancer. Yes. Of course Steve knows. Tony had been diagnosed before Steve had been woken up. He's never known Tony without brain cancer, really. He never knew him before. He wonders if that man was different. If a brush with death changed him, like they say.
He reaches up and brushes Steve's fire-hot cheekbone with the back of his hand, the fabric so much softer than the gauntlet, and, yeah, Steve could definitely get used to this.
He hears the rustle of fabric, and he forces his eyes open to see Iron Man taking a folded blanket from the back of the couch. Iron Man unfolds it, and then the blanket settles over him.
Tony's love life was dragged under the magnifying glass. They talked about his history with Whitney Frost and speculated on his ties to the Maggia. A particularly nasty column suggested that Kathy Dare's allegations of abuse had been true and that she'd shot him in self-defense. A couple of the lowest gossip rags somehow ran with stories about illegitimate children. It was all lies.
-- he has an even better thought. "Or maybe I'll pull out first." He thrusts harder, entranced by his own imagination, fueled by the sight of Tony. "I'll come on your face. Come on your chest. I'll mark you. It'll be messy. You'll look so good. Get it all over those ropes, all over you, and you won't be able to do a thing, will you, you'll just have to lie there, covered in it--"
"I'm sorry it has to be under these circumstances, Mr. Stone," Steve replied. It was an answer that didn't require him to say anything nice about Tiberius, and from the brief flash of annoyance in Tiberius' eyes, it was clear that he knew that.
"So," Steve says, and he smiles, and he hopes he doesn't sound anywhere near as nervous as he feels. He wants this to go right. He doesn't want to presume too much. He wants Iron Man to like him as much as he likes Iron Man. "Did you want to be a gentleman and walk me to my door?"
Well, Steve had asked for it. Tony could always put his clothes back on when it turned out that Steve really hated the sight of him. So he set the first flogger aside, unbuttoned his shirt with shaking hands, and let it fall. Steve regarded his skinny chest in silence, and Tony swallowed hard and undid his fly before he could second-guess himself, pushing off boxers and pants and socks in a tangled heap of clothing. With dread in his stomach, he glanced up.
That made him Thor's problem. Tigra's problem? No, Thor's problem. Tony couldn't think. He looked down at himself and saw that he had one gauntleted hand splayed across his stomach, metal clanking against metal, like this was the best solution his agony-dulled brain had managed to come up with.
"I know." God, he wished there were something he could do. "But it's going to get better. I believe that."
Tony must be cold, because it doesn't take any more convincing to get Tony to come over to the blanket. Tony sits down, picks up a blanket, wraps it around himself, but he doesn't come closer. And he's still shivering. It's not going to be enough.
It's actually important to know what Ghost is after. Also, Ghost seems like the kind of fella who can blather on about his principles for enough time to let Steve come up with a plan of attack.
When Iron Man drags his gloved hand over his face, it doesn't make the usual clanking noise, just the susurration of fabric. Steve thinks he's beginning to like that sound, too.
Tony chuckles. "Sure, of course," he says. "It's not an offer anyone else I've known has ever made me, I can tell you that much. It had sheer novelty going for it. And you're-- you're
It's an easy explanation, at first -- the iceberg, the Avengers, joining the team. He explains the RT, since obviously Steve wants to know what the big glowy circle in Tony's chest is, even if he's too well-mannered to ask outright. Explaining how they found Bucky is a little more complicated, and Steve's face is more and more distressed, even as Tony assures him that Bucky is fine now. He's about to tell Steve he'll try to get in touch with the guy for him, when Steve interrupts the explanation and entirely derails it.
Tony inhaled sharply, brain gone stupid with lust. That was something he hadn't considered, and he didn't really have a good angle, but he could give it a try. Barehanded, he slapped Steve between the legs and managed mostly to hit his balls, which made Steve cry out, full-throated, his body shaking like he wanted to throw himself toward and away from the blow at the same time.
Mouth still open, Steve stared at him. After a few seconds, he shut his mouth. He swallowed hard. "I'm sorry," he said, quietly. "I don't understand what I said wrong."
"Yeah," Tony said, hoarsely. "Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying." He coughed. "And, for the record, I do like men. And you. I like you a hell of a lot."
While Tony runs the washcloth over his face, Steve takes the opportunity to open the nightstand drawer and look for the massage oil. There's a variety of lube here, in all different sorts of containers. Tony's collection ranges from Astroglide, through a number of discreetly-packaged products Steve suspects are expensive, all the way to a bottle of mysterious dry powder labeled "for veterinary use only." And then there are the
"All right," Steve said, keeping his voice gentle. "We can do that. You can stay as long as you need."
Mr. Stark turns the soldering iron off, sets it to the side, and looks up. "Hi, Captain." He smiles. "What can I do for you? Did you have a special request for the mansion's grocery list this week? I can pass it on to Jarvis if you want; I think he's putting in the order now. Or is it Avengers business? Do you need me to build you something? If you give me a few minutes to finish this repulsor control assembly, I'm all yours."
He held out his hands and stared down at them, dazed, as if they belonged to someone else. His left hand was smeared with blood. His right hand was rapidly swelling. It was probably one of the metacarpals. It was hard to tell.
Tony just kept grinning at him -- a little weakly, but at least he was smiling. "Oh, absolutely," he said. "But mine are all Captain America, of course."
, for yourself, first and foremost. And you're a good man, an amazing man, so I'm sure you'll find that person."
Somehow Tony's eyes went even wider. "He's not my boyfriend!" Tony said, practically tripping over the sentence in his haste, and Steve felt every word like a punch, one devastating body-blow after another. "No-- Steve's not-- I'd never-- we're just good friends."
"Of course," Steve said. "And I'd like to extend my condolences to the families of all those who perished in the explosion." That included Chen Lu's family, but Steve already knew if he stressed that point Walders would eat him alive, and he needed to be defending Tony. "I wish I could say that an event like this is an isolated tragedy, but we all know that I can't. Even one death is too many, but it's thanks to Iron Man's quick thinking that the conflict was relocated from Midtown to a much less populated area of the city. Without his intervention, we would almost certainly have been looking at a much greater catastrophe right now, if Radioactive Man's explosion had instead happened in front of the Stone building."
Iron Man has one hand braced on the doorframe, leaning on it for support. His eyes are glassy and bloodshot, his gaze not quite tracking right. The slivers of bare skin Steve can see around them, framed in the narrow windows of the eye-slits, don't look any better: his skin is alternately patchy with blood in some places and then far too pale in others.
How could his dreams finally be coming true? Was this Tony's lucky day? He didn't have those. There had to be a mistake. He didn't deserve this. Maybe Steve didn't mean it the way it sounded.
