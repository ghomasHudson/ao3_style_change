"She helped me through my process of taking the evil memories of the Winter Soldier." Bucky explained, "I would watch Star Wars movies when I couldn't sleep or when I was feeling down. She was strong, and I looked up to her more then I looked up at Skywalker or Solo. Even if I didn't meet her in person, the character she played is held dearly in my heart."
“Tony, you are so amazing. Why would you be afraid of yourself?” Bruce asked, “You don’t have to tell us of course.”
“Trust me when I say this, but my brother would have married you so fast, you would have gotten whiplash.” Shuri chirped in with an evil grin on her lips, “oh man, how cool would it have been if you lived in the castle. I’d probably won’t get to see you much since you’d be basically stuck in bed the whole time.”
Just as he reached to unlock the front door, there was an audible click. Then slowly the door swung open. A soft tune reached his ears, and Steve tensed before reaching underneath the bottom of his wheelchair to pull out a small handgun that he carried everywhere with him. He softly closed the door behind him, glancing around to examine anything that could’ve been taken. He stayed silent to listen for any kind of movement, since he could still not see a big part of the living room. He could only hear the soft music playing on his record player. Louis Armstrong, his mind supplied.
The Captain slowly walked over to his husband, whose hips were slowly swaying. He gently wrapped an arm around Tony’s waist and pressed his back to the Captain’s front. With the other hand, he wrapped around the genius’s throat. The latter groaned and leaned his head back to expose his throat, letting the Captain leave a trail of kisses and bite marks. The song continued, with the two couples slowly swaying against each other.
There could also be the possibility of Stane showing up. His father’s right hand man was scary. Anyone who met him always left feeling uneasy and a little frightened. Even Natasha and Carol couldn’t stand to be in the same room with said man for an extended amount of time. Though they knew they could defend themselves, they still felt the little nervous fear crawl up their throats.
“I- I don’t know, Tony. You’re my friend, you know”
“Did you know that electronics run in a little different frequency then from where we are from?” Tony tapped his watch, killing all electronics in the house, including Steve’s phone.
“Honey, I think we are ready to start.” Tony called out.
“You know, Tony did always love space. After the Chitauri attack, he began to fear it.” Pepper told them, tears slowly sliding down her face, “But he loved it. Told us one day he would go to space. To see the stars peacefully. And now he’s there.”
T’Challa smoothly jumped on the table and sat there some how looking badass. Tony didn’t even blink as he jumped into the king’s arms with surprising grace and in a way that hinted they’ve done that before in the past. Bucky somehow remembered the exchange weeks ago and threw himself to the ground as he screamed “FUCKING FINALLY!”
“Thank you.” Tony whispered, his voice hoarse.
“I’m not... afraid of myself per se. I’m afraid of who I will become. Of my legacy.” Tony whispered, his hands tightening around the warm cup.
“Does it?” he grinned in amusement, lifting Toni off her feet and kissing the juncture between her neck and shoulder just to hear her laugh, and feel her clinging to him. “Does that sound about right to you?”
“I shoulda just pretended that I was still a murderous assassin.”
The now dubbed Man-Child behind him drew a ragged breath through his teeth. “No,” he choked out, sounding so genuinely wrecked that it actually made Steve feel a little bit of compassion. Until, you know, he remembered the whole part where he was prime target for getting sliced. “I have to finish what he started. I have to honour my father’s legacy and
“I promise,” she nodded, voice slightly thick, and pressed a kiss to Peter’s forehead. With the reassurance, the kid finally relented to being sat upon the wooden loveseat that Toni’d had built up here when the Avengers Tower had been remodeled. She had done up an entire roof terrace, outfitted with plenty of spaces for the rest of the team to join her if they wanted to, but over the years, it had become more of a special place between Steve and Toni.
Part of Clint settled at the way his wife very pointedly didn’t ask what the rest of the Avengers were asking; whether or not Toni was still alive. “There’s a plan,” he answered heavily, dragging a palm over his eyes. “Thor, Nat and I are holding down the fort and keeping an eye on the kid, so I’m not too sure what’s going on over there. Our latest update was a couple hours ago. Bruce just said that she was trying to climb while they dug a little.”
She would be leaving behind a family, now, if the unthinkable should come to pass. She’d have to leave Peter; her son, who’d lost so much in his tender six years already, and didn’t deserve to lose another person. She’d have to leave Steve, who’d given up so much for the world, for this job of theirs, and who she knew would find a way to shoulder the blame and break his own heart. The thought of that alone was enough to cripple her, enough to turn her cold right to her bones, and that was even before she thought of Rhodey and Pepper. Of Nat and Clint and Bucky and Bruce. Thor. Coulson. Loki. Even Fury, to an extent.
Nobody. Nobody was to say, and Steve wouldn’t let them even if they wanted to, because he needed to believe right now that she would beat the odds yet again. Nothing less than that was an acceptable outcome to him.
“Yes,” she laughed with a nod, eyes brightened with delight. “Exactly like a shield, Cap. Well, a shield that has the ability to level an enemy if they still decide to aim an attack at it.” At some point during her impassioned words, Toni had moved again, this time perching on the edge of the table nearer to where Steve’s chair was. Now, she pushed herself up onto it, letting her feet dangle as she made herself comfortable. “This the part where you tell me I’m delusional?” she asked lightly, but there was a real challenge in her words that made it clear she’d been shot down for her vision before. It made a flash of ire spark through Steve, the idea that someone as vibrant and passionate as Toni had ever been made to feel like she was wrong for daring to dream of a better world.
he’d replied almost robotically.
Ever since legally assuming guardianship of him, Toni had altered little things in little ways, so that they were invisible if not specifically searched for. Like the constant supply of fresh fruits and vegetables next to the rest of the groceries she had people stock for the Avengers Tower. Like the break she took every morning and evening no matter what she was working on, to greet Peter every morning and wish him goodnight. Like the way she never activated the soundproofing on the lab anymore, or how a picture of Steve, Toni and Peter, had somehow ended up in a frame on her desk in the workshop.
Apparently, it was the right thing to say, because in the next second, Tony was kissing him.
Toni could hear the aggrieved voice of one Nick Fury as he ranted to Steve, something about HYDRA and time warps and
It was something that still tied Steve’s throat up in knots sometimes, to see.
“Not happening, soldier boy,” she replied cheerfully, only her soft eyes indicative of the emotion of the moment. “Whatever we do, we’re doing it together.”
“You should go on ahead, Winghead,” he suggested softly. “Clunky metal isn’t really conducive to stealth mode. I’ll find another way in and meet up with you.”
“We’re being careful,” he promised lowly, ignoring her attempt at humour. She couldn’t blame him for it. “
“So what happened?” he prompted, flicking his gaze at her arms. Toni rolled her eyes slightly but leaned into him, something that made Steve bite back a huff of annoyance.
Efficient hands tied off the sutures, taped a piece of gauze over it and secured a bandage around her abdomen, as good as any field medic in Steve’s opinion. Toni dry swallowed two painkillers and packed her kit neatly away before Steve broke the comfortable silence.
A cavernous sigh was his only response and Tony decided that he didn’t have time to bother with Barnes or changing the gun. He had under 90 minutes left on the clock and if he could design and fabricate a knife that could carry a charge, close combat would be a lot quicker for him, which was good because Jarvis had trained him to fight from a young age – a consequence of constant threats against him as the Stark heir – but the older man’s first lesson had been a golden one:
Toni laughed loudly, shaking her head and pressing her palm to her cheek as it flushed a pretty, light pink. “
“What do you need, doll?” he encouraged her, nuzzling into Toni’s neck. “Jus’ tell me, darlin’, I’ll make you feel so good.” The promise was whispered with delicious intent, and who was she to deny him?
“What the fuck is wrong with you?!” he snarled unintelligibly at them, logic and reason obliterated by the sheer terror coursing through his veins, because he had no way of telling what the last few seconds had been like for his girl. Distantly, he recognized that he owed them his life, but Toni was more valuable than that to him and they had just stood by and watched as she was buried underneath debris.
But for all the bad feelings, there was also understanding there. It didn’t surprise her because out of everyone, herself included, it always seemed like Steve was the one person who had the deepest understanding of Toni’s relationship with Peter. At times when she didn’t even understand it herself, Steve somehow did. He had yet to be surprised by the level of love and devotion that Toni had shown towards being a mother, even when people like Rhodey and Pepper and Happy still expressed some level of reservation. Even when Toni
When they absolutely had to come up for air, he pinned darkened blue eyes on her, needing his message to be heard. “Don’t you dare think that Howard Stark has any idea who you are, and what you’re worth, because darlin’, he doesn’t have a single clue.” His eyes were burning with intensity, but Steve didn’t intend to stop before saying everything he’d wanted to tell her yesterday, when he’d heard the words Howard had thrown at her. “Don’t you dare think that you’re the undeserving one in this relationship, because if either of us is, it’s me.” She looked like she was about to interrupt, but a warning squeeze to her hip kept her silent. He continued, “Don’t you dare think that you’re not every last one of my dreams come true, and even more that I didn’t dare to dream of. And don’t you dare think that there is anywhere, or any other time, that I want to be in, more than this one.” He smiled softly down at the love of his life; nuzzled against her temple with utmost gentleness. “Right here, in this moment, with you in my arms, this is exactly where I want and need to be. I wouldn’t ever go back, because this is my home, Toni.
“No, don’t you
being careful. I mean, I have to be; my partner isn’t here to save my ass.”
Also, for interest's sake, the quote Toni is thinking of, is "Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself and listens to his own lie comes to a point that he cannot distinguish the truth within him, or around him." - Fyodor Dostoyevsky.
Steve had been the one who’d helped him integrate into society, but Toni had been the one who’d given him a part in their
The former wasn’t a surprise to anyone – he and Steve were brothers of the best kind; brothers chosen; brothers who’d seen through variations of the same war only to find their way back to being best friends again – but the latter was still sometimes met with some disbelief. Understandably so. The only one who seemed to shrug it off as something normal was Steve himself, citing that Bucky had always been a protective mother hen and that Toni tended to inspire that kind of response in anyone who met her and knew how little she cared about her own safety.
But this wasn’t a time for wishful thinking, he reminded himself. This was a time for fixing things.
She needed to feel safe, Steve knew that. Toni and Peter both. Toni’s safe space was her workshop and the lab, and Peter’s safe space was wherever Toni was, but since the workshop had Howard, and the lab wasn’t kid-friendly enough… where in the Tower was still somewhere Toni felt safe?
“Someday,” Steve agreed. And wondered just how he’d ever thought of Toni Stark as self-absorbed.
This time, Steve had to swallow hard a few times before he could answer. “Not yet, Pete, but soon. As soon as I can. Until we get back, you listen to Aunt Nat and Uncle Thor, alright? Be good for them.”
Dragging in a deep breath, the Thunder God watched as the sky lit up with a few bolts of lightning, reacting to his tumultuous emotions. “You had better be well, Toni,” he murmured, as if he could hope for the words to reach her ears somehow. “Valhalla is not ready for the Woman of Iron yet.”
Without thinking, Steve stiffened as Bucky approached him. His best friend had been the first to firmly declare his intention to accompany Steve to Argentina; his exact words, Steve vaguely recalled, were
Tony was a genius. It was just a matter of fact. That amount of data processing was barely a flex of his brain capacity, barely a hint of what he was capable of if motivated.
“Always am,” Jim parroted back, and a soft kiss landed atop her head. After a moment of silence, Rhodes hesitantly spoke. “Say the word, baby girl.”
not girls, Steve
“Sure thing, pal,” Steve nodded, more than ready to get back to his beautiful genius. He just needed to make sure, one more time, that she was okay before he went back to his room and turned in for the night.
– was lodged into Toni’s chest.
Except that they didn’t.
Dismissing the idea of trying to fabricate a new knife in time, Tony instead stalked across his workshop to the suitcase he kept behind one of the shelves. It was some of his old belongings that he hadn’t anticipated needing again, but was now glad that he’d kept as backups.
“You are,” Toni reiterated, and hoped that the eight-year-old was too tired and afraid to hear what she deliberately wasn’t saying. That she couldn’t guarantee anything about herself. “But I need you to go back into my superhero suit, okay?”
Her right knee in particular ached, and she carefully lifted herself to her feet at the same time that the doors suddenly swished open.
“Enough!”
The clarity came with the suddenness of a rubber band snapping into place. Shoving off the hand (green-tinted, didn’t escape his notice) that was reaching out to steady him, Steve brushed past Bruce and Nat to grab his phone back from Bucky.
As he watched, Toni bent low to press a kiss to the child’s forehead. “We’ll see about that, sweet pea,” she murmured softly, pushing Peter’s hair back in gentle strokes meant to sooth him into sleep. Not for the first time, Steve shook his head in amusement at the nickname Toni only used when Peter needed comforting or reassurance. It had become a thing between the little boy and the genius; Peter loved it, because his name started with a ‘P’, and Toni indulged it, probably because as much as she denied it, she loved the kid more than any of them could.
In theory, it made sense, but for some bizarre reason, the notion didn’t make him as happy as he thought it should have. Wasn’t it supposed to be a relief? That Steve wouldn’t have to confront anything awkward like feelings with Tony, and wouldn’t have to risk losing the best thing he’d had after coming out of the ice?
Even before the suit gently retracted from the small, trembling form of an eight-year-old boy.
For a moment, both men were silent. Jim’s mind was racing, tormented by the fact that Toni had gone ahead and said her last words anyway, despite asserting that she wouldn’t. Did that mean that she knew something they didn’t? Something that might not give them the successful end that they needed? Because fuck that. If anything happened to her… if anything happened to her, he was going to bring her back just so that he could kill her himself.
“Steve!”
And then there was the Avengers Initiative.
Because she knew he would hesitate, scared of hurting her, Toni took the initiative and gently tugged on Steve’s wrist until her lover removed his hand from her underwear. Showing off her regained flexibility, Toni rolled herself to lie on top of him. Steve grinned in approval, bright and easy like it hadn’t been for a while, and Toni felt warmth encapsulate her entire body at the sight. It was all she needed to drive out any residual cold that she still carried from her harrowing brush with Mother Nature.
“Captain America needs no introduction,” the guy – Ryan – smiled amicably enough, offering a hand that Steve really didn’t want to take, unsure as he was that he wouldn’t crush a tiny bone or two. By mistake, obviously. He was really strong. Stronger than this guy, anyway. “Ryan Coleman, but everyone calls me Cole.”
Tony seemed to have no such reservation. “Ryan Coleman.” The genius laughed, happy and unrestrained in a way that was usually reserved for Steve. “Well, fuck me. Of all the sidewalks on all the streets in all the world.”
“Yeah,” he nodded easily, ducking a little to enter and turning to face her with a smile when he was inside. "I just… I haven’t apologized yet.”
Well, except to Toni. She’d actually been convinced that they would get on like a house on fire, what with them both being staunch military men with a strict moral code and a tendency to reproach her disrespect for authority; and of course, Steve was paraphrasing his charming lover, just a bit. What she hadn’t taken into account, however, was how possessive both of them also were, and in particular possessive over her. Although in fairness, he and Toni hadn’t even been an official item at the time that Rhodes and Steve had met, so it was rather understandable that the genius hadn’t accounted for him...
“Do you understand what I’m telling you, Mr. Stark?” Rumlow asked, not particularly kindly. He looked rather bored, honestly, save for the spike of vicious satisfaction that he hadn’t been quick enough to hide from Tony when he’d mentioned Steve’s kidnapping.
She grinned, eyes mischievous and sparkling. “You know, Rogers, I think you just might have.”
“Uh-oh.” Toni made a face, trying to elicit a smile from Steve and bring him back from whatever he had heard with his superior senses that had incited his temper. “Are you going to give them the “Captain America Is Disappointed In You” dressing down, or the “Captain America Is Going To Strike You Down” tirade?”
That answer had earned him dual smacks to the back of the head, but the man wasn’t wrong.
how many times I held my breath and prayed that the suit was as indestructible as I hoped, that my friend hadn’t died in a bid to save my life, and that was when I only thought that there was a soldier in there who’d become my ally. But now… now, I have to look back on all those times and see that it was
The army uniform in front of him was unmistakably Peggy’s, and though Steve was hopelessly attracted to her, he couldn’t quite shake the initial pulse of disappointment that it wasn’t the younger Stark. It made no sense whatsoever, since she was more than likely to say something annoying that would put his back up now that the experiment was over and successful and she no longer needed to help keep him calm, but for whatever reason, he’d hoped that she would be there first, helping him get down instead of her father doing it, or flicking his head up with a careless finger and a smug smile. But she wasn’t, Agent Carter was, and it was rude to be disappointed by that.
Whatever she’d lived through to make her so accustomed to pain didn’t have any of the trappings of a typical rich kid socialite who’d been handed her life on a silver platter.
Speaking of whom. “Steve mentioned your little household AI,” he commented, and now, Howard sounded like the same disapproving, disappointed man she’d known as a child. “If it was a failure as an experiment, why flaunt it in your home?”
Insincere or not, it was apparently enough for Stark. “I forgot about it when I saw that Erskine had taken the hit,” she told him brusquely, and if he hadn’t seen her nearly destroyed with grief earlier, he might have mistaken the tone for heartlessness. As it were, he realized now that it was simply a defense mechanism of hers; not that he knew exactly what she was so defensive against. “Get me the kit in my nightstand, will you?” she asked as she tied the ends of her blouse into a knot at her sternum.
The blond only nodded once in response, but Bruce recognized the flickering in his eyes as relief. Steve and Jim still had a bit of a rocky standing, but they would both put that aside in order to help Toni.
“Somebody’s gotta have your back, Captain,” she murmured, a small smile curving her lips before she ducked down and kissed him, swift and sweet. “Keep this bird in the air, give me as much time as you can,” she instructed him, and though he was usually the one giving the orders, this time he realized that he was out of his depth. Toni, however, was right in the middle of hers.
Toni was hard-pressed to pinpoint the exact moment when she’d fallen in love with Steve, but she chalked it down to a gradual process. What had started out as enmity had transformed into friendship, and then blossomed into love, and though she didn’t fully recognize how it had happened, she was still enormously grateful for it. And though she wasn’t sure when the transition had occurred, she could still remember the exact moment, in HD clarity, wherein she’d realized it had happened…
“Rhodes,” the super soldier explained miserably, leaning almost desperately into the contact of Tony’s hand against his neck. “I heard you talking to him last week. You told him you were over me. Why? And why didn’t you tell me about it?”
Toni looked torn, and though Steve hated knowing that he’d put that expression on her face, he hated even more the idea that he would one day be the reason that the love of his life accelerated the cause of her ill-health.
Before he could ask the man to spit out whatever it was he so obviously wanted to say, Toni piped up. “Nobody likes a naysayer, Dad.” Suddenly, she was there in his line of sight as well, and despite the rocky footing they’d started on upon introduction, Steve found himself relaxing with her presence. “I double and triple checked the numbers myself; it’s going to work,” she told him confidently, but her posture was all wrong. Her arms were crossed and her chin was tilted slightly and she was stiff and defensive in a way that Steve had never seen; in a way that reminded him of the stance he took when he faced off against bullies in back alleys. Before he could wonder if the comparison had more merit to it than he thought, she turned to him and smiled. It wasn’t like the other razor-edged smirks she usually sent his way; this one was bright and excited, eyes sparkling and face brightening, and it transformed her into the kind of sight that made people stop what they were doing just so they’d get a chance to stare and sigh.
Toni interrupted him icily, and a whole new wave of horror washed over him when he recognized the name of the headmistress of Peter’s school. Toni couldn’t be implying… no, not…
The HUD flickered off.
He dropped his head to rest against her collarbone and Toni automatically lifted her hand to run through his hair. “Take it,” she consented softly, turning her head to press a kiss to Steve’s temple without ceasing the motion of her fingers through the silky strands of hair. “We’ve got the whole day.”
Toni wouldn’t disappoint.
Which would have been a lot easier if Maico would let her go.
“Something like that,” Steve replied cryptically, and Toni wondered whether her lover was going to need a lawyer. Before she could ask, her supersoldier zeroed on to the mottled mess that was her left bicep, and grimaced. “Have you taken anything for that?” he asked, sounding like he already knew the answer as he reached out to grasp her elbow, acting as a temporary brace.
To his credit, Steve knew the very second the words left his mouth, that they were a mistake of epic proportions. There was no part of him that meant them, but he’d frozen so spectacularly, shocked even at himself for the words he’d thrown at her, that he couldn’t figure out how to backtrack, to apologize.
Most of that awful tension had dissipated from Steve, but Toni knew it would be several days until the last of it was eradicated. It would be several days, possibly even weeks, until they could both put the terror and dread and shakiness behind them.
But then, Agent Carter was shooting at him, eyes frosty and livid as they had been when they’d seen him caught in that awkward encounter with the dame outside, and even as Toni distractedly promised to push the design work on his costume and shield through, she was following her friend’s march out of the room, and Steve knew that he’d managed to shoot himself in the foot before he could even try to court the genius.
Jaw clenched, he grabbed his jacket and stormed out of Steve’s study, crossing the hallway and taking the stairs two and three at a time as he headed down to the basement he’d converted into a workshop.
showed anything but the utmost respect to mothers in general. Mothers – the ones who did their jobs with love – were amazing and wonderful creatures, the truest miracle even in a world that had superheroes.
As it were, she had plenty of warning as Thor stepped out into the hallway of their floor, looking far removed from his usual cheery self. For the first time since she’d known him, Thor looked like some of his real age was showing, stress and worry and dejection and helplessness all chipping away at what sometimes seemed like eternal youthfulness. His eyes were dulled and his posture imbued with the weight of powerlessness until those strong shoulders seemed almost slumped.
“I have you,” Toni breathed back, lips lifting in a wan smile despite the pain. “If I’m not okay, I’ll reach out my hand, you’ll take it, and everything will be okay.”
“We have had very different upbringings, Rogers,” she murmured, sounding equally matter-of-fact and weary, and it made something deep in Steve rumble quietly. Made him wish, inexplicably, that he could have known Toni a little younger and dragged her to the tiny place he had called home, before throwing her at his mom and letting Sarah Rogers fix her the way she seemed to be able to fix anything.
Except that JARVIS was always kept in perfectly updated condition, and he had never, not once failed her, or the rest of the house, and he always took orders fro-…
“You go any harder, you’re gonna split your knuckles.”
“You’re a pain in my ass,” Steve replied, but he was chuckling as he spoke, a fond expression leveled at the smirking genius. “Just grab a jacket and let’s get a move on, huh?”
‘Iron Man’ had made a total of one appearance in all the missions that Steve had undertaken since he got together with Toni, and learned the truth, and she wasn’t even supposed to be near this one on account of the fact that she had been struggling the past few days with the increased blood toxicity from her palladium poisoning, but God, she was here and Steve was terrified of what this was costing her, but he couldn’t help also being so
“I see.” Uncle Loki sounded like he didn’t believe it, so Peter hastened to reassure him.
Her eyes were weary when she lifted them to his, something that made Steve’s chest clench unpleasantly. “Do you know how many people consider me worthy to continue the Stark legacy? To take my place at the helm of the company?” Steve’s temper flared, because he could guess the answer, but he stayed quiet, sensing that Toni didn’t need an answer so much as a listening ear. “One,” she told him with a small laugh, but the sound was all wrong. It was bitter and hurt and resigned in a way that Toni should never sound in her entire life. “Peggy Carter. She’s the only one, now that Dr. Erskine is gone, who thinks that I’ll be able to handle it. Most people stick to the normal ways of expressing their disapproval of me; hushed whispers with pointed glares, talking over me when I make a suggestion, that sort of thing. My dad’s old partner, though… he got a bit creative.”
“Love you, Steve,” she whispered back, the words wrapping around him like silk. “I’m yours.”
“I’ll keep ‘em all, if you just let me,” he replied, voice low and teeming with love and elation.
Hope y'all enjoy!
There was a lot to be said about the kid’s bravery – and though she wouldn’t realize it until much later, even more to be said about his implicit trust and faith in her – that Maico only hesitated for a brief moment before nodding decisively and climbing back into the armor.
he thought fleetingly, before taking a running leap.
“Rest well, young warrior,” Thor rumbled quietly, smiling faintly at the sleeping form of their precious little charge. “May good dreams follow you into sleep.”
And he only realized it when Nat had approached him, a familiar grim look in place that was equally unfamiliar in their home, and told him what had transpired in the time that he’d foolishly taken to sleep.
Now, she was here, and damn it, she didn’t know what to say.
He wasn’t sure who he was trying to convince.
A jaw-cracking yawn made Toni finally stop her work for longer than half a minute, straightening and stretching and relishing the series of pops her spine made as it cracked back into place. She’d been in the workshop since 2am, having only surfaced once that morning in order to greet her boyfriend and Peter, who’d brought her a breakfast bagel. Glancing at her watch, the genius cringed when she realized it was well after 4pm.
to watch that new mindless action movie that had no plot and even less suspense.
“I am not permitted to say.” If it was possible – and with Toni, Steve didn’t doubt that it was – the AI actually sounded cold. There was an impersonal edge to his normally warm and friendly voice that made Steve feel like a hostile, and of course the AI would have become sentient to Toni. Steve hadn’t met anyone who knew the real Toni, who didn’t fall in love with her, so why should a robot be the exception?
“I left,” Steve summarized wretchedly, the full extent of his own guilt weighted in those two little words.
She’d believed the lie.
This time, though, Steve was as shocked as Bucky to find his fingers clamped around his friend’s wrist in an unforgiving grip as he outright growled, “She’s not just some dame that you can fuck and duck out on, Bucky.” He didn’t know who was more surprised at the cuss word he rarely used with such viciousness, but Steve didn’t waste any time thinking on it. “She’s worth way more than that, so why don’t you just fool around somewhere else and leave Toni out of it?”
– aghast. “You’re
Except maybe, sometimes even geniuses were wrong.
“Hey, Shellhead! You up for a visitor?”
“I said I’d take proper care of myself,” Toni interrupted calmly, using her good arm to tug at the jacket Steve was wearing. Obligingly, he started to slip out of it, and the inventor spared a moment to concede how much she loved him. “And I will. But I’m not going to let Peter’s first look at me scare him to death.” Pulling away from Steve with a badly concealed grimace, she started to struggle into the jacket.
Not even when he’d had his world shattered by the confirmation that Tony had felt the same, had Steve realized that he’d been in love all along.
“Palladium poisoning,” Steve repeated, and it didn’t sound any less sinister or terrifying the second time around. “Is there an antidote? Some kind of cure?” His heart dropped into his stomach when she shook her head wordlessly, but Steve refused to give up that easily. “What about slowing it down? Is there a way to slow it down until we find an antidote?”
Regrettably, her bodyguards seemed to feel differently, and Bucky actually growled. “Do you have a death wish, Barton?” he demanded, but a quick glance slid towards the former assassin showed Toni that he hadn’t drawn a weapon. Progress was progress, after all, she noted with approval.
“I’m only going because it’s you,” she informed her lover primly, shifting warm eyes on him when Steve finally lifted his head to smile at her. “You’re lucky you’re so pretty,” she added with a playful smirk.
“You’re forgetting that Toni is the genius behind JARVIS,” Rhodes added, completely unhelpfully, but since Steve wasn’t really in the frame of mind to explain something he was only half sure he understood himself, the super soldier didn’t judge.
“’Kay,” Peter nodded sleepily, snuggling into his bed and clutching the teddy bear that had been the only thing he’d wanted from his old home. “G’night, Mommy.”
He’d never been particularly good at sharing, but Steve didn’t care much about that. He had no intentions of sharing Tony, especially not now that he’d finally figured out that the genius was his.
have known, and that was the truth. Not only because she hadn’t fought with him a word in her own defense, but because he should have believed that the woman he loved would have never acted that way in front of Peter without a damn good reason.
Translations: Bambino = Baby in Italian and Mladshaya sestra = Little sister in Russian.
For all the wordless communication that could pass between them, Toni also heard one more thing. “You have to go, don’t you?”
At one time, that might have been a low blow on her part, but today, it simply rang to her as the absolute truth.
She didn’t see the SHIELD agents, who looked poised to intervene on her behalf. All she saw, was that Peter was standing there, wide-eyed and pale, having obviously witnessed enough through the transparent windows to know that she hadn’t tripped.
He was trusting her to make this right, to keep him safe.
Sometimes, Bruce still wondered how that interaction had worked out in her favour, but he was endlessly grateful for it. He knew with certainty that he wouldn’t have ever forgiven himself or the Hulk if he’d attacked Toni.
But then she was recovering, that awful mask of cool disconnect coming back and leaving Steve cold as he felt shut out. Without a word, she threw the last of her things in the bag she’d been packing when he’d interrupted her and threw the unzipped bag over her shoulder. Part of him wanted to immediately stop her, make sure she hadn’t tugged loose any stitches with the motion and take the bag from her, but he couldn’t bring himself to act. He scrambled for something to say, anything, because even a fight would be better than this horrible silence.
, he thought to himself, smiling as Toni complained lightly about helmet hair even as she pulled his spare one over her head.
A shock of static was his only warning before Bucky came on to the line that Peggy had commandeered just a few minutes before Toni’s arrival on the plane. “Is she there?” his best friend demanded without preamble. His voice was tense and low in a way that it rarely got, except for moments when he was genuinely afraid. “What’s your status?”
Toni stopped in her tracks, blinking slowly as she spotted Steve at the entrance to the foundation’s premises, leaning against his bike and looking for all the world like a concerned boyfriend waiting to pick up his girl. To her trained eyes, however, he looked positively wrecked; his features was taut and there were light bruises underneath his eyes to indicate a sleepless night, much like her own. His hair had the look of someone who’d run their fingers through it countless times and when she’d stopped, his arms had twitched in an aborted motion that Toni knew, would have tugged her into his arms had she not stopped short.
She was almost tempted to talk herself through the climb, disquieting as it was without JARVIS as her constant guide and steady presence, but she was struggling for breath already; the thin air combined with the dust and her compromised lung capacity enough to thwart even her stubborn refusal to back away from a fight; and she didn’t want to aggravate the situation. Her progress was slow, but it was marked, and it would be for nothing if she did something stupid like pass out from lack of air and fall all the way back down.
For now, he spun his lover around, bringing Tony back against his chest with a strong arm around his waist. Instinctively, he ground against the other man’s ass, unable to keep himself from indulging a little, only to find that there was a unique sort of torture in pressing up against Tony’s perfect ass with the full knowledge that he wasn’t going to get to be inside him just yet.
Toni had loved to play chess, a long time ago. It was, perhaps, the single, solitary thing that she’d enjoyed about the boarding school she’d been shipped off to. At first, she’d joined the team in the hopes that her parents would visit more often to see her matches, but after time, she grew to savour the depth of brilliance it fostered; the challenges it presented to her overactive mind.
Toni, at least.
When it became clear that Tony wasn’t going to kick off their strategizing with a little light banter to lift their spirits, Steve awkwardly fumbled into the battle plan that he usually delivered with all the steady surety of Captain America. What he hadn’t realized, was just how big a part Iron Man played in keeping him as rock-solid as he was; Tony was the foundation that gave Steve the stability to be the Captain.
Toni laughed, and though it was a slightly hitching one, it was enough, for now. “So he’s my son when he’s cheeky, and yours when he’s an angel?” Before he could answer, she cocked her head to the side, considering. “Actually, that sounds about right.”
When he was close, he bent to capture her lips with his once more. “I love you, sweetheart,” he breathed between kisses, feeling like nothing was more important than her knowing that in this moment. “I love you, I love you so damn much.”
“Only if Toni’s the one to take me out,” Clint quipped back faux flirtatiously, batting his eyelashes ridiculously at her as he clutched his chest.
Forcefully, the genius shoved those thoughts away, needing to believe that a rescue team would be there soon enough and get them out before things got desperate. The first step to helping was to fix JARVIS, and so Toni concentrated on that while launching into another story about the time that Peter had climbed atop of Mjolnir, only to start flying throughout the Tower when Thor recalled his hammer from four stories up.
“Thank you,” she replied simply, a rare moment of unguarded gratitude making her relax muscles that she hadn’t realized she’d tensed. “I just wish we had something to go on. HYDRA’s been quiet for a while and that doesn’t inspire much confidence, but if this is an ambush, then it’s a really sloppy one. You guys are prepared for something like that, even with the unfortunate last-minute roster change of me being benched.”
“What are you thinking, sweetheart?” Rogers asked, and as much as Jim was still sure that he didn’t deserve Toni, there was no denying how much the Captain was struggling in that moment. He usually steered clear of pet names on the field, but the fact that he was using them now meant that he wasn’t thinking like the tactician he was. He was thinking like a boyfriend.
Tony smiled, razor sharp and all teeth. “Good call.”
Pain rippled over her after she automatically tensed, but Toni couldn’t help laughing at the typical entrance of their resident archer. It was so endearingly normal that she loved him all the more for it.
“I think you deserve some ice cream, little hero,” she teased lightly, and that was enough to distract the four year old. It wasn’t nearly enough for Steve, who looked at her with the forlorn expression of a kicked puppy, but the hurt was too fresh in her mind and heart to handle now.
Her entire succinct report made Steve feel sick. It was glaringly obvious that there was no way around this impossible situation, that didn’t include some part of his world being in danger. Helplessness turned to anger, that started to crackle deep inside him, burning away the nausea. “What are you going to do?”
“Go for ice-cream,” the blond declared, standing up. Speaking the idea only strengthened his belief that it was a great one. “Let’s go for ice-cream. Chocolate ice-cream. With sprinkles.”
Before Barnes could comment on that, Steve was cut loose, and Tony abruptly shifted his attention from the door to his advancing lover. Banner wisely finished taping his wrist and made tracks, but Barnes stayed behind. Steve’s usually soft and playful blue eyes were now flinty with fire, and whether that was anger at Tony being there, or anger that the goons had laid into him, he couldn’t be entirely certain.
For the first time in her life, she had been accepted. Clint’s family had not only opened their arms to her, as Clint himself had, but they’d loved her in a way that she’d been trained to think of as weak, except… well, it hadn’t seemed like a weakness when she’d been faced with it. To her, it seemed to be an immeasurable strength to be able to find love in their heart for one whose hands were stained so deeply in blood red, as hers were.
But no matter what was between him and Rhodes, Toni was still the common thread between them.
About the bruises she’d been sporting the night they’d come back from rescuing the soldiers from the 107th.
“Wake up, tiny human. It has… By Odin, I cannot believe that I let you talk me into this… Awaken, Son of Stark!”
about raising a hand to my son again, I swear, I will kill you,” she enunciated slowly and carefully, making sure that each snarled word, and the solemn vow within them, penetrated her father’s thick skull. Her eyes blazed with a lethal intent, and not even Howard was stupid enough to test her. “You don’t look at him, you don’t touch him, you don’t think about him. Are we
Steve didn’t marry her the next day, so that was another one of his certainties that was proven wrong. But he did eventually do everything he vowed to do, so, technically…
In the end, all it took to bring Captain Steven Grant Rogers to his knees, was a goddamn phone call.
A problem for another day, she decided, and sent Rhodey a wan smile. “If you’re about to yell, I should warn you that it might bring my overprotective Captain down on your head,” she teased, her words completely negated by the emotion that she knew had come into her eyes.
And yet Toni could hardly remember how she lived a life without all of them in it.
But apparently, Carbonell Tech was making as many waves in its short five-year lifespan as SI made in the past five decades. In any other circumstance, it might have even crossed Tony’s mind to be proud of the strides he’d been making in the empire that next to nobody had believed he could create.
Come hell or high water, she was going to tuck Peter in tonight.
Lining himself up, Steve bent to capture her lips in a deep kiss at the same time that he pushed forward. Toni whimpered helplessly against his mouth, the blood in her veins bubbling with the scorching pleasure of being filled by her lover again. Steve stilled inside her, giving her a chance as he always did to adjust to the fullness, and after a few moments, Toni rocked against him in a wordless go-ahead.
She heard his sharp, demanding voice in her head now. What was she missing? What was she being so quick to overlook, that her gut was screaming at her to
Expert fingers flipped the modified design of the watch he’d been working on last week. He’d added a manual activation switch for the tracker and replaced the comm interface with a targeting interface, to complement the radically new and yet untested repulsor tech he was installing in it. What was meant to only be a shield in the standard model, was going to be a gauntlet of sorts for him as soon as he could figure out how to connect the watch to the arc reactor. It would provide enough power to send a limited number of repulsor blasts, he was sure. If he included the nanotech to flip panels along his entire arm, like a sleeve, he could add the wiring between them, maybe even stretch the arm-shield into a chest shield to protect the arc.
On that note, to any mothers who might be reading this, Happy Mother's Day! Y'all are all just incredible <3
Steve started to speak, determined to remind them of his presence, but before he could, Tony beat him to the punch. “That depends,” the inventor grinned, and Steve almost swallowed his tongue. “You gonna take me back to that God-awful Thai place with th-…”
“Clint,” she cut him off slowly, an almost dangerous edge to her tone. “You feel like telling me just why I can hear my son crying?”
Before he could stop her, Toni grabbed the bottle of scotch and upended some of it over her wound, lips going white as she sealed them shut in an effort not to cry out from the pain.
And then another.
“It’ll hold,” the other soldier stated confidently, rapping the chest plate with a gauntleted hand. “Gotta work on the impact absorption, because they hurt like a motherfucker, but I’m still secure.”
As if he’d heard her thoughts, Bruce softly and tactfully redirected the EMT to fetch some supplies, and smoothly made the transition to continue stitching the large gash in her arm.
The archer would have given anything to help ease his son’s pain, even buried as it was underneath childish anger, but the cost of living off the grid, keeping his family safe from harm with top of the range security and still supporting them all on his paycheck alone… SHIELD paid him well, but not exorbitantly, and less so after he’d joined the Avengers, as the transition had bumped him down to a SHIELD contract employee. Damn bureaucratic red tape.
As they rode home, Toni felt a deep peace settle inside her, the likes of which she’d only ever experienced before the first time Steve had kissed her. Whatever challenges lay in front of her, she was going to handle, because the alternative simply wasn’t an option; losing this, messing this up, simply wasn’t an option.
get caught up in trying to keep them from offering her as a sacrificial lamb to enemy camps, just so that they can get some work done without her trying to undo it all.”
Of course, that self-professed debt didn’t have anything to do with why he’d been so adamant about being involved in this little rescue mission. No, that had more to do with two things; his willingness to follow Stevie into the depths of hell, and his own fierce protectiveness over the girl genius.
Tony, who saw the world, and Steve, in a way that no one else ever did. Tony, who treated his bots like they were his children and kept dumb tapes of Steve’s USO days to make him laugh and abandoned everything at 3 in the morning because Steve wanted to get ice-cream.
“I promised you I would be.” Steve brought her carefully closer to him, still cradling her against him, and pressed his lips to her temple for a long moment. “I will always be there. But please, baby, don’t you ever do that to me again.”
She stayed in that position for as long as it took for her tears to dry – minutes? Hours? – before shakily rising and walking away without another word.
So what was going on now, that Toni was so set on hiding?
The armor flickered to life.
He had never been one of those guys who stood back and watched as some entitled, arrogant, pompous jerk took whatever extreme measures he so fucking desired because he believed that the entire world should bow down to his wishes. He had also never been the guy to walk away from someone in trouble, and so in a way, that first meeting of his and Toni’s was one that couldn’t have gone any other way. He’d knocked out the guy she was with, and when she’d begun to scream and yell at him for it, he’d simply tossed her over his shoulder and made the quick walk to his dorm.
They respectfully stepped aside from the weeping mother and son and begun their examination of the battered remains of the armor. It had been far more damaged than his initial assessment; from the exposed mass of wires near the helmet, it was obvious that Toni had had to scavenge it to make it meet her needs down there; and Steve didn’t need to be a tech genius to know that the suit was useless to them right now. Even if they could use the override for JARVIS to pilot it, it simply wasn’t roadworthy, to use one of Toni’s popular metaphors.
Steve wasn’t sure he would ever fully understand the friendship that had blossomed between his lover and his best friend. Only six months ago, Bucky had been on the run, avoiding everything and everyone as far as possible for fear of losing control over his HYDRA programming. It had been Toni who had eventually tracked him down, once Steve had swallowed his pride and asked his resourceful girlfriend for help, and Steve had spent the better part of two weeks convincing his childhood best friend to come back to the tower with him.
“Language,” Clint admonished weakly over the comms, and for the first time, Steve remembered that the entire team was probably listening to this. Tony was going to
myself that he would
Pressing his thigh against the bulge in the front of Tony’s pants, Steve found some relief of his own as his aching cock pressed against Tony’s hip. It wasn’t much, but it was enough for right then. “Want you, Tony,” he confessed mindlessly, his voice rough and deep. “Can I touch you, sweetheart? Will you let me? Please let me, doll.” As if to supplement his plea, Steve mouthed a trail from the spot behind Tony’s ear, across his jaw and then down his throat, ending by tracing the hollow at the bottom of the other man’s throat with his tongue.
Steve nodded wordlessly, not trusting his voice as his senses exploded all over again with the hazy rush that came from having the man he loved in this position. Slower this time, as if Steve was the one who needed to adjust, Tony slid his mouth down his length, bobbing his head a little to take more and more until finally, he hit the back of the inventor’s throat. A strangled noise that Steve would deny ever making slipped from his lips and pleasure buzzed like live wires in his blood.
And when that didn’t work, Toni was always all too happy to let him mark her up with his teeth and tongue and make it very clear whose best gal she was.
“Ah, what could have been, Madam,” JARVIS deadpanned back, making Toni laugh in delight at the snark that her brilliant AI had somehow developed. Some – or, more accurately, most – of the Avengers had laid blame for that on her shoulders. “Alas, you chose Captain Rogers.”
Somehow, the fact that his backup was batshit insane served as a comfort to the soldier. Reminded him a bit of Toni, to be honest, and it would make sense that she’d need someone as off the reservation as she was to agree to test out her new weapon.
…well, Toni couldn’t have felt safer.
“And so good in bed,” Steve nodded agreeably, blue eyes sparkling with concealed mischief as she spluttered with laughter. One of the most rewarding things that she’d learned about in this relationship she’d fallen into, was Steve’s dry but undeniably quick humour. Most people thought it was spending time with her that was rubbing off on the clean-cut Boy Scout Captain America, but Toni knew the truth; buried underneath the public persona, there was an impish Brooklyn boy with a sharp wit who always gave as good as he got, and the serum hadn’t changed that inherent part of him.
Shaking his head to clear it of the muddled, confused thoughts, he argued lowly. “She’s different, Buck, you and I both know it. She deserves more than a roll in the sheets.”
Like it always did, Steve’s heart warmed at the address, thawing away some of the ice that seemed to be encroaching on it since hearing about Toni. “Hey, buddy,” he greeted gently, his entire tone and demeanour changing from what it had been while talking to his best friend. “You looking after Uncle Clint for us?”
Fury barely batted an eyelid at her nickname for him, closing the distance between them with single-minded determination. Toni wanted to huff a sigh when Coulson sent the elevator back up without them, but she settled for fixing an impatient look on the SHIELD Director.
do that to my kid, he would never hurt anyone but me, and when I took Peter, I told myself that it was okay, because he was dead and he couldn’t do anything to destroy this, but he came here too, and Steve, he’s always going to be there. Oh, God,” she stopped her diatribe long enough to suck in a horrified breath that didn’t help her choppy breathing in the least. “He’s
If he minded, the soldier didn’t show it. Instead, he offered a lazy little salute of agreement. “You got it, Winghead.”
Oh, she was on to him. Softening her up with those earnest eyes, targeting her natural desire to protect him from helplessness by focusing on his reaction if something were to go wrong… everyone thought Steve was about as manipulative as a butterfly, but she had his number. Sneaky little jerk.
Steve hauled himself up and out of the crater he’d put in the rubble since he’d restarted, giving Bruce the space he needed to work and also giving himself a minute to take a breather. It went against his every instinct, but the strategist in him had been very vocal about making sure that he didn’t rush headfirst into this rescue like he did almost everything else. This was the very definition of a delicate operation, and Steve wouldn’t let anything – neither fault nor fatigue – jeopardize it.
And another.
Forcing himself to relax a little, because there was no point in lashing out when he could be thinking of a strategy to get Toni out safely, Steve forced himself to take a steadying breath. “S’okay,” he muttered, absently knuckling his chest. In some ways, he felt like he used to as a kid; steps away from having an asthma attack because he just couldn’t take a fucking breath. Not while he knew that the love of his life was possibly hurting, probably scared. “I just… I gotta focus on her right now. Gettin’ her outta there safely.”
“Eight,” he answered softly, making her feel a little sick as he reminded her even more starkly of Peter. Who, she hoped, would never find himself in a situation like this.
Quite literally. The Winter Soldier programming in him was dormant for the most part, but all too happy to take the proverbial driver’s seat when the skillset was necessary for protecting his family.
Had been ever since he was a scrawny little guy from Brooklyn, enlisted in the army and trying to cover a grenade with nothing but his own body while an idiotic, reckless genius who shared his trait of never knowing when to give up, didn’t stop running towards him and trying to figure out a way to save them both.
“Toni?”
Her answer was short and cold enough to chill Steve right to his core, spoken to the background noise of her repulsors flaring and her suit’s artillery shifting beneath its panels.
Silence reigned between them for a long moment, the only sound being the fabricators as they worked overtime to pump out the designs Tony had fed them. Eventually, it was broken by Bucky straightening and looking him in the eye, with nothing but respect and a hint of affection in his blue orbs.
But it wasn’t. It hadn’t happened. Everything was okay.
“Shouldn’t you be in bed right now?” Tony drawled, raising a condescending eyebrow. “Kids need a solid eight hours if they want to function at their best in school.”
It probably wasn’t much of a surprise to anyone that Jim and Steve didn’t really get along.
With a flash of inspiration, he started towards the stairs, taking them three at a time.
so! You’re a horrible person and I hate you!” With that fierce proclamation, Peter rushed forward and landed a spectacularly aimed boot on Howard Stark’s shin.
with him, that was just. Way too painful for him to handle.
And while he trusted them with the little boy who was a pseudo nephew to them all, he still hadn’t forgotten the time that Clint had suggested teaching Peter darts as a suitable babysitting activity.
. I’ve got to follow those instructions.”
Blue eyes widened with shock as Steve snapped back up to his feet, Bucky and Bruce both whirling around to face him as well. All three of them realized what was happening at the same time.
As Steve paced the Quinjet, he comforted himself with the memory. People, himself included, so often forgot just how brilliant Toni was; her mind was like a steel trap and it worked faster and more accurately that some computers. She wielded any tool like it was a magical wand and she looked at what most people would deem to be junk, and saw something amazing. She ran numbers and rattled off complicated equations like she was reciting the alphabet. The woman was the personification of futuristic and if there was anyone in the world who front-lined the phrase ‘pulling a rabbit out of the hat’, it was Toni. She had this insane knack to come out of any situation on top.
“That does seem like you,” her father sneered a moment later, after she’d turned back to her suit. Determinedly, she kept working, trying to ignore him. “Always coveting those things that you shouldn’t have. That you don’t deserve to have.”
But there was no denying the tug of her gut that told her she’d hit the nail on the head.
“…assume that they will kill him once the three hours are up,” Rumlow was saying, and once again, he was a nanosecond too late in disguising the smugness that filled his eyes at the thought. Tony’s stomach turned and he fought against the sudden violent urge to slam his fist into the lawyer’s face. Taking a cleansing breath, he made himself listen to the rest of what the man was saying. “Though in a situation not of his doing, the Captain still instructed our firm, in the event of
He was grateful for Tony.
Immediately, Steve had her elbow braced in his gentle grip. “Toni!” he admonished, sounding worried enough that she managed an inkling of remorse among her impatience. “You have to leave that on, Bruce said that pulling the stitches would cause you unnecessary pain, not to mention set back your recovery if they pop. You said that you…”
Another voice piped up suddenly.
She’d never needed that reminder.
son. I can’t do that from a hospital.”
So instead of leaving, as he might have a few months ago, he strode determinedly forward, kneeling in front of the bed so that he was at face-level with her as she sat cross-legged upon it. “No,” he replied simply, the previous anger in his voice giving way to throbbing fear and sincerity and desperate need all at once. A need for her to listen and understand just what his mind was screaming at him. “Do you even understand…” he stopped himself abruptly, shaking his head as he realized how wrong a track he was choosing. There was fire in her eyes, lighting them a hot amber, but to his gratification, she didn’t try to stop him. “Do you know just how many times… how many hits Iron Ma-
To thank her, he was sure. His momma had drilled manners into him and he wasn’t about to forget them.
Maico giggled, a childish sound that warmed Toni’s heart a little as he relaxed and leaned back as much as their small space allowed. “Daddy says I am, but my mama says I’m still her baby boy.”
An agent by the name of Clint Barton had been the first person to ever make her forget that irrefutable truth. It wasn’t, like she’d told others, because he’d saved her rather than eliminate her, per SHIELD’s suggestion. That decision had fostered a debt between them, that Natasha had yet to repay, but it had not fostered love.
“We’re gonna head back right now,” he reported tersely, turning back to face her with blazing blue eyes. There was some self-recrimination amidst the anger, but now wasn’t the time for her to address that. “If anything happens, you’ll have the element of surprise, since they’ll probably expect you to be with us. Use it, but don’t try to take them on by yourself. Just… wait for me.” Abruptly, the fearless leader was gone, replaced with the urgent lover. “Okay? Please, Toni, promise that you won’t make a move on them until I get there. Can you do that for me?”
As tempting as it was to give voice to that thought, Steve knew it would have to wait. A proper apology was still in order; or rather, the confirmation of Tony’s acceptance of his apology, Steve didn’t want to just assume; and he still had to take the man on a real date. He had to
“I told him that heroes were born, not made,” she said, a terrible flatness to her tone that didn’t match the exuberance he’d associated with her up to now. That instead, matched the muted bleakness that had been in her eyes earlier. “I told him that Erskine chose you because Steve Rogers was a hero that needed a body that would fit his heart.” She paused for a moment, the words hanging heavily in the air between them before she rapped her knuckles twice against the door jamb. “See you around,
On the other hand, a little rutting was probably all he would need to get off as long as Tony kept making all those pretty noises just for him.
– because he thought you would be a good
Her repulsors took care of the door to the pathetic excuse for a bunker; JARVIS had already located the only one that she was concerned about protecting, and she was secure in the knowledge that he was ensconced safely in a room on the lowermost level of the supposedly secured place. His captors – the ones that would die the slowest – were cowering in a room of steel, barred and barricaded as if any of it would stop her.
Undefined though it may have been, it was exactly what she needed, and Toni shuddered out a breath that was equal parts relief and residual anxiety from the entire ordeal. Bucky held her closer still, thumb rubbing soothing circles at the base of her neck, not dissimilar to what she used to do for him when the Winter Soldier was too close to the surface for him to be comfortable with.
Steve heard it as Man-Child swallowed; sensed his wavering resolution and their imminent win.
Part of her couldn’t help the gratitude, though. Steve was the best thing that had ever happened to her, until Peter, and he was still the dream come true that she could have never anticipated she would find, let alone deserve. The thought of them still pining after each other was unimaginable, especially not when she could attribute most of her fondest memories of the past few years to her super soldier.
He knew that he didn’t deserve her kindness.
Rerouting some of the suit’s backup power and manipulating the circuitry that connected her interface to her AI in order to make it run on a patchworked wire connection, without those wires frying? Piece of cake.
“He never listened,” Man-Child mumbled softly, and the desolation in his voice was enough for the super soldier to circle back to feeling compassionate. “When I said I wanted to be a scientist, that I wanted a different life… nobody ever listened.”
For a heavy moment, Clint only scrutinized Toni, and Steve would be lying if he claimed he didn’t feel at all jealous at the wordless conversation the two appeared to be having. Abruptly, the archer nodded.
From his left, Howard Stark was positively gaping. “We actually did it,” he muttered to Erskine, eyes a little crazed with excitement in a way that wasn’t nearly as attractive on him as it was on his daughter.
And he had been… kidnapped?
The demand was spoken in a serious tone that Clint rarely used, and it told Toni a lot about how him, and probably the rest of the team at home as well, was taking her predicament. She’d managed to reassure Steve, Rhodey, Bucky and Bruce, but it simply hadn’t occurred to her that the rest of her team could have done well to hear from her too.
Her hand found his blindly, and Steve snapped out of his desolation when she squeezed it. “I reached out my hand… and you were there to take it,” Toni told him, voice achingly weak and breathless, but crystal clear. Love edged away the worst of the dullness in her eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
She didn’t realize that was speaking out loud until JARVIS interrupted her with a tentative call of her name. “Shall I contact Captain Rogers?” the AI asked worriedly when Toni failed to respond to him. At any time, the genius might have spared a moment to fondly compliment the AI, but right then, even breathing seemed like a monumental task.
In an instant, the expressive features closed down into a carefully arranged mask of disdain and cool irritability. If Steve hadn’t been so sure of what he saw, he would have bought right into Stark’s well-practiced cover.
Tony rolled his eyes slightly, but there was a hint of pleasure evident in his eyes at the undertone of approval in the words. Why did this guy’s endorsement mean anything to him, anyway? The past was in the stupid past, and it needed to stay there as far as Steve was concerned.
taking his love out for a romantic dinner, he would have taken Tony to this little Mom-and-Pop Italian joint that served the best homemade carbonara in the state, hands down. Tony had also told him once, during one of their deep and intimate conversations, that he was far over the clubbing scene, with all its pumping music and sweaty anonymity, so
He prepped her slowly, languidly, fingering her through a first orgasm and then a second before he couldn’t stand dragging it out any longer. He hushed Toni’s mindless protests with a kiss when he finally pulled his fingers out of her, leaving only long enough for grab protection (he was a boy scout, so sue him) before he was back and easing himself into her tight heat. He went as slow as she needed, not wanting for a second to cause her any more pain than necessary, and it was worth it when, a few beats after bottoming out, she rocked up against him purposefully.
Dimly, she became aware of Steve’s whispered words against her skin as he stroked her through the aftershocks: “So good for me… Mine, my sweetheart… Feel so good, so hot and wet for me… so beautiful, baby…”
Now, she would have given anything to have Steve’s arms around her.
“I don’t…” Tony tried, and abruptly clamped his lips shut again, shaking his head as if he were trying to solve a complicated math equation. Come to it, that might have been easier for the genius to do. “I didn’t want you to know and feel guilty for not returning my feelings. I was happy just being your best friend, if that was all I could get.”
As he drew breath into his lungs, ready to bellow as loud as he needed to get attention, he was cut off by a cold, clammy hand on his chest. Steve expelled his breath raggedly, relief crashing over him in waves when Toni sat up weakly in his arms.
He never thought he’d have to return that favour literally.
They made the rest of their ascent in mutual silence, both simply relishing being in each other’s arms when they’d feared, for the better part of almost 27 hours, that they would never feel it again. The only break in the quiet was from the periodic sounds of Steve kissing Toni’s hair, her forehead, her temple; basically anything he could reach; to assure himself that she was safe and back in his arms.
She nodded once, starting to turn away before stopping and pinning an intense look on him. “I know that she might sometimes be a handful, Captain Rogers,” Peggy stated brusquely. “She’s reckless and impulsive and jumps into things without thinking whenever her heart is on the line. But she’s the most brilliant and kindest person I’ve ever had the good fortune to meet and I’m entirely fond of her.” Now, the agent’s smile turned razor sharp. “Just something you should bear in mind.”
– he was treated to a smile. Not a Toni Stark Smile, but a
Toni didn’t voice the thought, because she didn’t think either of them needed to dwell on what could have been, but it was the unfiltered truth. She’d faced death so many times in her relatively short life that it no longer scared her. That wasn’t to say that she wanted to die; not at all, not since becoming Iron Woman, at least; but at the same time, her mortality was an incontrovertible thing that Toni didn’t feel the need to fear. Death, as far as she was concerned, was what happened to the people who were left behind.
When he flicked her already-taut nipple, Toni actually jerked in his arms. “Fuck, Steve,” she breathed, eyes slamming shut as pleasure flooded her senses. He kept teasing the tight bud and pressing his thigh firmly against her aching center until she was almost mindless with the onslaught of sensation. “More,” she eventually managed to blurt out. Dangerously close to a plea. “More, Steve, I need…”
Thankfully, neither Clint nor the presumably present but silent Natasha, said anything to contradict her insane promise. Instead, the Toni was treated to the shuddery breath and the quick sniffle that meant, happily, that Peter’s crying was easing off.
Steve winced slightly, knowing how much the title set Toni’s teeth on edge with her perceived inability to bear it, but to his surprise, his lover only sighed, almost inaudibly, and got to her feet with a softly returned, “Sweet dreams, honey.”
Stupid, selfless, loving, amazing, idiotic fucking Steve. They were going to have
So, yes. This idea that Toni was a soulless automaton was not entirely out of the realm of what she wanted. But someone had once said to be careful of the lies one told themselves, lest they begin to believe them to be true… and though Toni didn’t make a habit of paraphrasing Dostoyevsky to herself, there was no denying that those words had always rung close to home for her.
might be there.
, he knew that he would take all the stress and worry in the world, over not having her at all.
Toni leaned against him, fatigue edging out her reserves. “Bruce is getting something, I think,” she answered noncommittedly, scanning the crowds from the relative safety of the gurney she was sat upon, strategically positioned so that the people and the cameras couldn’t get a clear sight of her. She didn’t want Peter, or Nat, Clint and Thor to see her on TV, looking far worse than she actually was, and worry unnecessarily.
In the next moment, she couldn’t think coherently enough to feel much of anything except pleasure.
Hey y'all! So sorry for the super late update, but this chapter just didn't want to cooperate with me! I think Toni just didn't want it to be finished, but alas! Here it is, and this is the end! What started off as something I didn't think would exceed 20k works, became this 84k+ monster that I absolutely thrilled in navigating. I hope you guys did, too!
Not giving him a chance to get back in his head, she engaged him once more. “Well, I think we could use some of that. I’m Toni, by the way. I think my name means ‘one who talks a lot’.” Her attempt at a joke elicited a wider smile and even got the kid to loosen his grip on her a little. Small successes. “How old are you, Maico?”
With one last frosty glare of his own, Tony turned on his heel and left. To Steve’s credit, he didn’t follow him, and Tony was only partially true to his word as he hitched a ride with Barton and Romanoff, striking up an easy friendship with the man as they chatted on the way.
Steve stopped in his tracks, looking at the blue eyes of the robot – not robot,
-J <3
She nodded once, then disappeared for a few seconds as Erskine began addressing people. Steve heard bits and pieces of what they were planning to do to him, but he couldn’t focus his attention on one single thing, at least up until the point where Toni reappeared at his head. He felt a prick in his bicep, growing chagrined when he was told that it was simply a penicillin shot, but before he could flush or say anything to Erskine’s little shrug, he felt a small, cool hand against his forehead.
“Shall I open a private line to Captain Rogers, Madam?” JARVIS asked gently, and it said something about Toni’s mental state that she’d almost forgotten her beloved AI’s presence.
A particularly ferocious yank of some rubble earned him a look from War Machine that Bucky could guess, without the man lifting his faceplate, was probably cautioning with a hint of threat. Rhodes took Toni’s safety as seriously as the rest of them and though he and the Colonel had reached an understanding based thereupon, Bucky knew that he wasn’t exempt from the other man’s wrath if he did anything to hurt Toni. And he wouldn’t have it any other way.
“Some of us, Stevie, ain’t afraid of a little complicatin’,” Bucky replied loftily, sounding strangely amused. “But alright, fine. I won’t go sweepin’ him off his feet. Now get the fuck outta my room and let me sleep. Punk.”
?! Where the fuck is she?”
Peter mumbled, and he sounded so miserable that it made the backs of her eyes sting.
With slow, deliberate movements, Steve lifted his body to hover over Tony’s. The brunet sighed in contentment at the heat radiating off his lover, but pouted when the blond refused to blanket him like he usually did. Stupid ribs, stupid bruising, stupid everything. Tony knew for a fact that it would dissuade Steve from hot, life-affirming sex, and for that alone, Tony wished he could shoot Slime Man again.
“Yes Sir,” Tony saluted playfully, and a bolt of something hot and uncomfortable rippled down Steve’s spine. It displaced him, but thankfully Tony was oblivious to it as he pulled on an old MIT hoodie that Steve was eighty percent sure belonged to Rhodes.
He was on his feet in an instant, only mindful enough to make sure Peter was still preoccupied with his toys while Steve took jerky steps away from his son. “Pepper?” he croaked out, his voice thin even to his own ears. “What… what’s going on, what’s wrong? Where’s Toni?”
As if reading his mind, Tony murmured, “New York is amazing at night. It helps that even the delinquents are asleep by now,” he added jokingly, slanting a grin at Steve when he laughed, “but it really is amazing.”
“That’s your job,” Steve replied cheekily, feeling his spirits rise by the second. Not with the promise of ice-cream, but with the simple pleasure of spending time with Tony. Because maybe he was over Steve, but Tony was still his, really. His best friend, he meant. Of course.
The bruising grip had made her want to purr in happiness. She loved Steve’s marks on her, especially the ones he made with the specific intention of claiming her as his, and while she’d been healing, he’d been so achingly gentle in everything. It had been appreciated, while she’d been on the mend, but now? She wanted nothing more than to feel the power of that restrained strength. She wanted Steve, without fear and without reservation.
On the plus side, she mused to herself wryly, at least all the times where she’d learned to duck a swing from her old man was now working in her favour.
“Mommy!” Peter scrambled across the small expanse and, as predicted, threw himself into her arms. Pain erupted like a volcano but it was still a far second to the blinding joy and crippling relief that came from having the little boy in her arms. Holding him close. This was what made her feel like she was at home, and she would’ve broken every bone in her body twice if it meant getting back here. To Steve and Peter, and the Avengers and their home.
Steve didn’t know whether to be grateful for, or annoyed by his best friend’s interference when he heard Nat’s voice over speakerphone, but he was forced to admit that speaking to Peter was probably the only thing that would keep his head away from the dark thoughts at this point.
Who was to say that she wouldn’t figure out a way to beat natural disasters as well?
She was almost home and away, when Fury’s clipped voice reached them from the other end of the hall. “Stark.”
It took a second before her boyfriend figured out what she’d done and responded, voice soft.
Steve growled audibly, despite the relative regularity of Toni and Clint playfully pretending to flirt with each other, and the genius took the liberty of derailing any possible tension by reaching out and using her good arm to pull the archer into a quick hug, without actually leaving the protective circle of Steve’s arms.
“Hey, Sugarplum? Do you think you could stop treating the love of my life like some kind of parolee?” she asked, hoping to catch Rhodey off-guard and succeeding as he spluttered slightly, making her grin. “Seriously. I don’t want to one day explain to Peter that Uncle Rhodey only hates Dad on principal.”
The words, combined with the searing kiss they shared and the wonderful feeling of her around him, and Steve came hard, his own orgasm throwing Toni off the edge one more time as well. For a while, they stayed like that, locked together and sharing breath as they fought to move back from the edge that they were perched upon together, and when they finally did, the first thing Steve did was press his lips firmly against hers.
That hope strengthened a little when Iron Man responded, as prompt and battle-ready as always, when the call to assemble came in the early hours of the morning on day three. Steve felt relief come close to smothering him as Tony approached them where the Quinjet landed, but it was tempered when the genius didn’t raise his faceplate like he normally did. Or send Steve a bright, infectious grin and a snarky comment about how they were late to the party. Or stand next to him in that wordless way that told anyone who cared to look that Tony had Steve’s back, just as Steve had Tony’s.
Steve whirled around, hushed disbelief dripping from his voice as he spoke the words that seemed to be completely insane, and yet made all the sense in the world. “You’re… Iron Man?”
“I’m no happier about this than you are,” Rhodes told him abruptly, as soon as Steve calmed down and managed to meet their eyes again. His anguished eyes deviated from the hardness of his expression as he looked at the renewed rubble. “If I thought letting you get buried would have helped her, I’d have done that, but all it would have done was ensure that she would kick all our asses when she’s topside.”
broken the man’s cheekbone. Anyone would be pissed.
“You make such pretty sounds for me.” He husked the words into her ear like it took a great deal of effort to form them. If she had the presence of mind for it, Toni might have felt smug about that. “My gorgeous girl.”
Except, she knew, it really wasn’t.
“Peter,” she nodded, taking a steadying breath. Toni dropped her head against his shoulder for half a second. “He’s downstairs. I’ve got him. I’ll get him.”
A win-win, in his mind.
Cutting off without saying goodbye – because that word suddenly held much deeper, scarier connotations – the genius began to do what she did best.
And it worked, despite everything, because Tony loved Steve more than life and the rest of the world combined. He would do anything for Steve. Even this. Even… building weapons.
Without much conscious thought, he found himself speaking. “So beautiful, sweetheart… you look so beautiful like that, on your knees for me, wrapped around my cock. You’re so good for me, baby, can’t believe you’re doing this for me. My perfect babydoll.”
Steve grinned to himself as his sharp senses picked up the change in Toni’s breathing.
being there to guard his six.
Things had, of course, gotten better. When Rhodes had realized that Steve was as crazily in love with Toni as one person could be with another, and when Steve had realized just how many awful and sickening things the man had seen Toni through and protected her from as far as possible, the military men reached an understanding. Toni was their common thread and the one person in the world that they would fight heaven and hell for. They would always be suspicious of each other and step on each other’s toes more often than not, but for the most part, they teamed up tentatively to take care of Toni.
As Slime-Man grabbed a handful of Steve’s hair and yanked his head back, Tony became sure he could deal with a smidgen more guilt.
So instead of begging her to wait for him, instead of pleading with her to stay safe until he could get there and keep both her and Peter from harm, Steve swallowed his fear and rage and asked, “How will I know where to come when I get there? How will I know where you are?”
And his smile? God, Tony’s smile lit up every inch of a darkened space. Steve did whatever he could on a consistent basis, just so that he could have that smile as a part of his day. Whether it was lounging on the couch in Tony’s workshop, or bringing him lunch when he forgot to eat, or listening to him even though Steve only understood about half the words, he did it all, because the only thing better than Tony’s smile was his laugh, and on the best days, Steve got to hear that, too.
So, no. She’d never related to the Mama Bear in that story, so she had no idea why people so often compared her to a Mama Bear.
Again, I really hope everyone enjoyed the update! More fluffy reunions and homecomings soon...
“How’s Saturday?” he asked softly, eyes no longer on the screen or the timer or anything, now. He had his eyes closed, picturing Toni smiling at him from underneath her lashes as they danced together to a song that never ended. “Eight o’clock? If you promise to let me keep taking you, I promise we’ll make it a regular thing.”
When he felt some of the pressure start to decrease, he managed to shout out. “No! Don’t! I can do this!”
) and that fierce pride he’d tried to stifle earlier at his amazing girlfriend.
“I’m right here, honey, I promise,” she told him, and slipped away from him just long enough for the armor to close up around him. His resulting scream broke her heart, but at least he was safe. Without needing a prompt, because JARVIS was amazing like that, the suit immediately shifted to cover her as much as possible from the falling debris. When she was curled underneath it as much as she was able, she thumped a fist softly against the torso of the suit. Maico stopped screaming at the sound and Toni grabbed the opportunity to get a word in edgewise. “See? I’m right here, Maico, I didn’t leave. I’m here, sweetie, everything’s going to be okay.”
Amazingly, Steve snorted a small laugh. “Yeah, don’t worry,” he replied amusedly, “I’m not gonna be makin’ you a friendship bracelet anytime soon.”
She blanched at the thought of basically living with her father again. “Can’t you make up a reason to keep him here?” she asked, not caring how desperate she knew she sounded. Even in the mansion, there had never been enough space between her and her father, and she would be damned if she let him anywhere near Peter or the home she had built.
James Buchanan Barnes could safely say that he had absolutely no clue how he’d gone from being the Winter Soldier; an isolated HYDRA assassin elite who was fear personified; to an Avenger; a do-gooding teammate who had little kids dressing up as him on Halloween.
“Long as it goes both ways, soldier boy,” Tony replied breathlessly, rocking into him teasingly as Steve stumbled towards the showers.
Maico shook his head, but it felt more like he was just trying to bury himself closer to her with the movement. “I want to go home,” he whimpered, and those five words flashed her right back to her son’s tearful plea from a few hours ago.
to reveal a look of cool implacability. To anyone else, he might have looked cold and uncaring, but to someone who knew Tony as well as Steve did? Well, it was easy to see the tension that thinned his mouth. The way a muscle in his cheek jumped from how stiffly he was clenching his jaw. The combination of anger and apprehension that darkened whiskey-coloured eyes into a dark, murky brown.
“Maico Santino Navarro, can’t you see Miss Toni is very tired?” A woman bustled forward and if not for the scolding, the strong familial resemblance would have given her away as Maico’s mother. She spoke in rapid-fire Spanish that took Toni a second to get into the rhythm of. “Come now, no jumping on her!”
“Darling, you always know just what to say to get me all hot and bothered,” Toni joked, hazel eyes sparking with a glint of challenge. Steve felt himself begin to blush a little at the flirty response, but he could tell that the inventor was only joking around and trying to lighten the air. He hadn’t understood as much at first, but he was starting to realize that there were many more layers to Stark than he’d initially credited her with. “What’s the situation?”
That would have been it for their little family, if not for the attack ten months ago, which had brought Peter into the fold. He was already one of them because, unspoken though it might have been, he was Toni and Steve’s. Whether or not they had intended this course of action for their relationship, was irrelevant; the very moment that the dust had settled on Toni’s attack on their resident bad guy, and Steve had seen her holding a little bundle of trembling three year old in her arms, curled protectively around him, the super soldier was already halfway gone.
Drawing the covers over her sleeping son, Toni leaned down to press a kiss to his cheek. Peter barely stirred – a welcome change from the nightmares and sporadic sleep patterns of the last two weeks – and Toni latched on to the tentative hope that the worst of the trauma was over.
Toni felt each and every movement like it was a lightning bolt of pain rocketing through her aching body. Her muscles sang with strain, evidently unimpressed by the pushing she was doing while dehydrated, and sleep-, food-, and oxygen-deprived, and her head throbbed vilely with the reminder of the concussion she’d yet to properly acknowledge. Her arm still bled sluggishly, seeping through her makeshift tourniquet at a slow but steady rate, and at some point – she wasn’t entirely sure when – she’d managed to split her bottom lip with all the gnawing she’d been doing on it.
Since he was fairly certain that he wouldn’t be convincing Bucky to stay behind, Steve had made the difficult decision of leaving Thor behind, the God having shown up within ten minutes of the news breaking. Thor himself had done what he’d always done; nodded understandingly and vowed to hold the fort along with Nat and Clint; and that had left Bucky and Bruce to accompany him. Bruce was a no-brainer, what with the Hulk’s strength combined with his protectiveness over Toni, not to mention the doctor himself. Whatever happened, Steve wanted Bruce in on checking Toni over, since the genius only really trusted her science bro by way of medical.
The plan to thank Toni had to wait a little longer, because at around about the same time that Bucky called out, “Let’s hear it for Captain America and… uh… Iron Man!” Steve realized that the genius, along with the suit and its pilot, was nowhere to be seen.
Tony froze a little before turning in his arms. He didn’t make any move to leave Steve’s embrace, though, so the super soldier happily held on.
But if that wasn’t enough to break his heart, then the shattering confirmation that she’d been abused for that long, had certainly done the trick.
Assholes.
Rather than Bruce, it was the AI who responded, voice kind. “Indeed, Sergeant Barnes, however I am most generally the vessel with which Miss Stark conducts the calculations.”
“Funny, I was about to tell you the same thing,” he retorted, chucking her softly underneath her chin. And then, because even tradition could be altered after she’d nearly died, he stood in front of her, shielding her from the crowds, and gathered her to his chest. “You’re gonna be okay?” he asked softly.
Later, they’d told him that he’d been lucky. That his mother had shielded him with her body, which was what had kept him alive, and that armed forces had been quick enough to respond before the hostiles could take advantage of the situation and kidnap him.
As soon as he was put at least partway to rights, Steve wasted no time crowding Tony against the railing and kissing him. It was softer this time, almost lazy, like a slow-burn of desire rather than the inferno they’d just had. Because he could, Steve lifted his lover into his arms, waiting for the smaller man to wrap his legs around his waist cooperatively before claiming his lips again. He licked in as deep as he could, plucking the taste of himself from the inventor’s tongue and growling at how inherently right it felt that Tony tasted like him. Smelled like him, even.
“Yeah, well, you were right,” he conceded with a small shrug, following her lead and taking a seat when she did. At her raised eyebrow, he elaborated, “Erskine gave me the serum with the faith that I would do a lot more than… what was it?” he asked, smile growing teasingly. “Dance around in a Halloween costume like America’s new boy toy?”
It had been beyond difficult for him then, away from home and his family without any contact for the first time. The worst part hadn’t been the aching muscles or the abhorrent living conditions or the constant knowledge that lives were depending on him; the worst had been the sheer distance away from everything he’d grown up knowing and loving. It was the reminder, every day, that his Ma woke up praying that she wouldn’t get a telegram about him. The reminder that Stevie was trying to enlist and probably also curled up in a ball at night trying to breathe right because he always pushed himself too much during the day. The reminder that everything could go to hell in a handbasket for him in an instant, and his loved ones would be left to suffer through life without him there to do whatever he could to help them.
Tony his.
Okay, loves! Here's a suuuuper long chapter full of the schmoopiest schmoop I could conceivably schmoop, for two reasons: 1, because I have exams in a week so the next update will probably take another week or two, and 2, because I watched Engame this weekend and I AM DESTROYED AND NEED TO BELIEVE THAT MY FANFICTION IS THE NEW CANON!
The archer firmly ignored her. “Did you touch her?” he asked in a voice too low to be heard by anyone but Steve. Clint’s voice was icy and controlled, but it was the white-knuckled grip on his knife that indicated the extent of his fury. Barton had always gotten along well with Toni, and over the years, the two had become more like long-lost siblings than friends, and it was painfully evident now, that he considered himself the big brother.
Though she resented it, the genius knew she couldn’t lie about that. “No,” she admitted after a brief pause, cringing at the dead silence her words were met with. “The suit has its own emergency oxygen supply, but…”
“At ease, soldier,” Bucky murmured, eyes gentle as he took in the stiff stance Steve had taken. “You doin’ okay?” He winced and shook his head before Steve could so much as raise an eyebrow, pinching the bridge of his nose impatiently. “Stupid question, I know. M’sorry.”
Clint still wasn’t entirely sure how that one had crept up on him; and by that one, he meant the mismatched family that had banded together over the course of the past few years, adding to the tally that had started with him and Nat. Laura often teased him, saying that she’d had to wait for years after their marriage before he’d given her in-laws, and though Clint pretended otherwise, it made something that was now all too familiar swell up in his chest, to think that these people were now his. His family, and his alone.
As for trying at the things that he didn’t care about before; well, that encompassed just about everything, didn’t it? For the longest time, Steve had had trouble putting his energy and passion into anything because of how heart-wrenching it had been to lose all those years. To move on from friends and loved ones already passed, knowing that they’d mourned him long decades ago. The weight of that grief and guilt had been like a living thing, sucking the soul out of him one dreary hour at a time. But then Tony had blasted into his life like a meteor and nothing was as dull anymore, and gradually, Steve found himself caring about the little things again. Trying again. Living again. It had given him a life, again.
Honestly, he probably
For a few moments, Barnes didn’t speak, but Tony didn’t blame him. Must have been difficult for the man to realize that he just might not be the most dangerous man in the room, anymore. It had been the same for Tony when Rumlow had started blathering on about Steve’s business.
For as long as he could, he held out against the scream building in his throat, for some reason thinking of the tension in Stark’s voice when she’d been trying to soothe him through the serum injection. Perhaps she was holding out the hope that it would be a relatively painless procedure, and oddly, he wanted to spare her the blatant disproving of the theory. When he couldn’t hold it back anymore, the sound scraped at his throat until it was tender, and yet for all that he was the one screaming, he could still hear Toni’s yells through it.
While Clint may have been the one to teach her that love was not simply a tool for the weak and powerless, it had been Toni who had taught her how to accept that love and love back.
He stopped in the doorway to Peter’s room, watching with a fond smile as Toni tucked a half-asleep Peter into bed.
His hands framed her face, brought her forehead to rest against his because it was easier to speak when he was able to feel her breath, every life-affirming one of them, against his face. “I wouldn’t have been able to tell you that I think of you every time I need a boost of courage on a mission. I wouldn’t have been able to tell you that you’re the biggest driving force behind me fighting to get back home. I wouldn’t have been able to tell you that I love you, God, so much that it doesn’t even make sense sometimes, because you would have been gone before I could say anything. And I wouldn’t have known, Toni.”
In a moment of courage, probably brought on by their solitude and the bubble that always wrapped around him when he was alone with Tony, Steve managed to ask, “What I really meant was, why did you get out of the suit
“Get out.” The words were spoken low and even, with no inflection at all, and Steve winced. He would have much preferred her cussing him out, screaming at him, maybe even throwing something, but this? This, he knew, Toni so controlled and cold and seemingly devoid of any emotion, this was the worst he had ever fucked up. This was the worst he’d ever hurt her, and to his chagrin, he’d managed to hurt her more than once in the past.
Toni Stark was not Mother Material.
“JARV, feel like slicing me out, here?” she muttered, low enough that she hoped the kid wouldn’t hear her. Compliantly, and without the reprimand she’d expected from her AI, the suit lifted an autopiloted gauntlet and shot off a quick blast. The heat from the proximity made her grit her teeth, but the effect was beneficial and two-fold; not only did it break off the piece of the beam so that she wasn’t pinned anymore, it also cleared away some of the debris to widen their space, thankfully without causing any collapses.
Tony grinned at the kid, but Steve spotted the mix of emotions swirling in his eyes. “Call me Tony, kid.”
boots, I would worry more about not getting everyone else’s up my ass whenever it comes time to spar. Good to see that shiner I gave you faded okay.”
The words worked as they were intended to; comprehension dawned over Steve’s face and something close to empathy eased the combative stance that Kevin-the-stupid-paramedic had fallen into. For his part, Bruce didn’t falter for half a breath as he worked on her injuries, but the genius didn’t miss the shuffling motion that brought him a little closer to her.
Drawing away, Toni didn’t fully register her brow knitting with concern. “Is it an assignment?” she asked solemnly. It was never any easier to let Rhodey go off into dangerous territories, not before or after knowing what she did and having felt what she’d felt, but Toni had long ago mastered the art of composure. Regardless of how she felt about it, she would never do anything but gracefully relent to watching Rhodey go, her heart in her throat and a fervent prayer to a God she didn’t believe in on her lips.
“No, it’s okay,” she pulled away, taking a breath to steady herself. Smiled shakily at him. “I’m okay. Just got ambushed by everything for a second.”
And that was when the earth trembled and started to collapse around her.
“Please,” he forced through chattering teeth. “Have mercy.”
“I’m not actually sure where she is,” Peggy admitted, when a lull in their conversation prompted him to ask where the genius was. “I haven’t seen her since we got back to base. I’d assumed she was laying low to keep tabs on the prototype she sent in.”
“Some minor glitches while testing some new ideas,” she replied vaguely, waving a hand in clear dismissal. “If Hodge and his cronies were dumb enough to corner me, do you honestly think I’d be the one with bruises?” She snorted indelicately, not bothering to hide her opinion on that idea.
Biting her lip to suppress the laugh that was bubbling in her throat, because Toni just knew there would be a hint of hysteria in there, she managed to drawl back, “Listen, Featherbutt, if you try to teach him how to shoot an arrow again, I’m not gonna stop Steve from scalping you with a spork.”
“I’m okay,” he confirmed with a happy nod, snuggling closer still. With a gentleness that not many his age possessed, Maico touched his fingers to the top of her arm, just above the first stitch. “You got hurt without it. I’m sorry.”
She could deny it all she wanted, but Peter was bringing out the softer side to Toni more than anyone else besides himself could. If it were anyone else, she wouldn’t have bothered to preserve the surprise of breakfast in bed, but for Peter? Somehow, she knew how important this was to the kid, and she was doing what she could not to spoil it for him.
Bucky, Rhodes, and a few other good Samaritans who had provided the rescue equipment, all worked different points in the rigged harness, lowering him achingly slow into his descent. It felt like it had taken eons, and Steve had held his breath the entire way, but impossibly, miraculously, amazingly, he finally reached her.
Toni moved swiftly past them, but paused to throw a measured request over her shoulder, voice cold and hard. “Keep one of them alive. Someone needs to spread the word about what to expect if anyone touches my son again.”
And so, the dreaded helplessness had kicked in.
are?”
That wasn’t even the right thing to do! Anyone who actually knew Tony, would have known that sending him flowers was ridiculous and clichéd and juvenile, and the real way to his heart would have been something a little less conventional. Steve? He would have gone with sending the genius a bag of his favourite coffee beans, for example. Tony loved the stuff, practically lived on it most days, and it was a personal touch that said a whole lot more than stupid flowers.
He had a point there. A person would have to be certifiable to waltz into the Black Widow’s bedroom in the middle of the night and alternately shake and urge her awake. “This is important,” Steve said instead of arguing, brow furrowing as he remembered the reason he’d woken Bucky up in the first place; a reason that was still making his stomach churn. “I was going to the workshop to sketch because I couldn’t sleep, and I knew Tony would be up, too, and I heard him talkin’ to someon-…”
“Designs, I’d wager,” Peggy replied when he asked, her tone a little curt in a way that Steve could tell was meant for Howard Stark. “Wouldn’t be the first time that we needed to bend the rules a little and needed Stark Senior’s help to do so. He’ll take credit for her work in exchange for what she’s asking him to do.”
He kept a hooded gaze on her face as he slowly, almost hesitantly, began to explore her soft, moist folds with his fingers. The little whine she let out and the sheer pleasure on her expression was a vision, but then, Steve was fairly certain that everything about Toni Stark was ridiculously beautiful.
Miraculously, the clumsy words were enough to make the genius relax in his arms. Tony even leaned back against him for a few glorious moments, allowing Steve to surreptitiously brush his lips across the nape of his neck in the guise of raising his head.
Erskine was the one who finally stopped her frantic movements by grabbing on to her hand, holding it securely in his without care of the blood that slicked between their palms. He linked his fingers with hers and rested it against his ribs, wordlessly forcing her to stop and accept the inevitable, before directing his gaze at Steve.
Toni was okay. She was safe, for the moment, and she would stay that way. If HYDRA attacked, there were plenty of ways for her to deflect without confronting them, until backup arrived. She was smart and resourceful and armed with no shortage of ways to wreak havoc.
Bucky slanted a smirk at her. “I think your AI just scolded us.”
Toni, hurt and scared and alone, clawing her way up from the destruction and hanging on to survival by a single thread.
A measure of earnestness slipped into her voice, and Rhodes wondered whether she was trying to convince them, or herself.
Fear turned to fury, because it was so much easier for Steve to handle. “You promised me you wouldn’t, Stark,” he barked, the voice of the Captain taking the place of the lover. “But if that doesn’t mean a goddamn thing to you, then…”
“What made you come all the way out here?” she asked curiously, playing with the ends of his hair in a way that made him happy enough to want to purr. “How did you even know where I was?”
“Ten-four, Captain,” she replied with a smile that she knew he would hear in her voice. Predictably, a tiny huff of laughter was her reward, and though it was only superficial, Toni still counted it as a win. “I love you.”
Peter replied solemnly, an oath of a child if Steve had ever heard one.
The same thing as Steve. Dig like their lives depended on it.
And fine, that was damn well easy for Bucky to say, wasn’t it?! It wasn’t the love of his life trapped under there, it wasn’t his whole world that was in danger and hurt and afraid and needing him! Toni had called, she’d reached out like she’d promised, and Steve had sworn to her that he would get her out of the nightmare she was trapped in, and how was he supposed to do that if everyone else who claimed to want to help, stopped him from doing that?!
something in you, Steve, he saw more than you ever have! He would have wanted so much more for you than this. He expected more to come from you than parading you around in a fucking Halloween costume like the serum was only good for turning you into America’s boy toy!”
Not sparing either man a glance, she turned around and walked out of the lab, not caring about anything else except the trembling little boy in her arms.
The sharp call of her name made the genius realize that she had paled spectacularly, her expression frozen in equal parts foreboding and dazed shock. Darting her eyes back to Steve, she saw that the Captain was in full-battle mode, not knowing why but recognizing that Toni did.
In his life, there’d only been one time and one person who’d managed, not to erase his helplessness, but at least to ease its sting by turning it into an opportunity for growth. It hadn’t been Laura, who was his lifeline and savior and angel nevertheless, and it hadn’t been Nat, who represented his salvation, to him.
Toni swallowed, grateful for the cover and solidity of Rhodey’s strong chest. “’Course,” she confirmed, equally quiet. “I always am. You?”
Tears slipped freely down the woman’s face now, but she gathered enough composure to slip a delicate looking chain off her neck. A pendent roughly the size of a quarter hung from it, and she pressed the medallion into Toni’s free hand.
“Easy, Steve,” the genius murmured, one hand petting the outside of his thigh soothingly while the other rubbed absently at the pre-come that had inadvertently gotten streaked across Tony’s cheek. God fucking damnit, that was so sexy… “Let me take care of you,” he cajoled lowly, eyes sparkling with mischief but somehow simultaneously soft.
A rather eccentric coach had considered her the crowning jewel of his team; had gone to great lengths to polish her game until Toni was competing among some of the highest ranked players in the world. The best advice he’d ever given her, and the most memorable, had been the day he’d offered to play a game with her. He’d stopped her from pushing an attack with her bishop, halfway through the game, and told her:
Tony opened his mouth to speak, struggling as he drowned in his blood, “Steve, it’s okay. It’s okay.”
“Who decided to make the after life a hard thing, I swear–“ Tony groans, his shoulders slumping. “Well I mean even in other myhts there’s the whome judgement thing you know, Tony?” Steve remarks, his brain thinking hard. “So what the hell are we supposed to do then? I hate this”
Tony flushed, “Please, I could never never land a guy like him.”
The noise of the ship they were on barely registered to the team.
“Stop apologizing for doing absolutely nothing” Tony is seriously starting to get sick of Steve’s guilty eyes.
Tony and T’challa? They didn’t mind. They knew what the two teenagers were capable of. So it wasn’t a surprise when the immature friends jumped up on the table in the common room, and screamed “THE FLOOR IS LAVA”
The embrace lasted awhile, both Steve and Tony finding comfort in each other. “So what do we do now?” Tony breaks the silence. “We cross, we walk, we move on.” Steve points to the general direction of nothingness. “So what are you still doing here?” Tony questions “I was waiting”
“Tony?” He whispered, his voice full of emotion as he made his way closer.
Peter and Shuri locked eyes and nodded. A new plan was hatched. Operation get Tony and Steve together phase 1.
“This is a new era, Rogers. You are everything the old era represents. What a better way to start this by ending everything you represent. Hope. Strength.” The Captain walked closer.
Tony picked up the cup of tea before taking a long drink from it. He usually preferred coffee when he could sneak it in, but tea would have to do. It tasted very herbal with a bit of orange peel. Probably one of Bruce’s teas.
“SHURI.” T’Challa glared at his sister while Tony let out a choked sound.
Steve was so warm. So warm and gentle. He should tell him.
Harley broke down this time, silent cries shaking his shoulders. Peter squeezed his hand, fresh tears falling softly down his cheeks. They looked over at was once their mentor. Father figure. Then silently, they pressed the button. The compartment shot out and from the safety of the ship, they watched as tony’s ashes were spread across the stars. Watched in silent awe as Carol slowly floated out and used some of her powers and the mixture of solution Bruce and Shuri had made to turn the ashes into small stars. Pepper let out a quiet cry and had to walk away.
“I’m bored, honey.” Tony sighed and placed the lollipop back in his mouth.
"Oh no..." Tony whispered before going back to typing his next fanfic on Sterek involving a food fight, a bear, and an almost character death.
T’Challa threw his head back and let out a hearty laugh before speaking, “I do not think my fiancé will appreciate the joke.”
"Well of course it's better. I'm just saying that this ship named Malec seems to have more joyful moments together on the show." Thor tried to sooth his brother.
The man walked over, small remote in hand and handed it to them, “he would have wanted it to be you two.”
Tony opened his mouth to say something but Steve put his hand over his mouth.
“Look at you now, Rogers. I’d never thought I would see you like this.” Tony chuckled, tapping a long finger on his knee.
"Anything for you, babe."
"So does that make Thor and myself Gryffindor?" Steve asked.
Tony mentally shook his head. If something was coming, they would be ready for it. The Boggart could’ve just been trying to make him paranoid. Scared. It worked but Tony knew that if something big was coming, they would be able to handle it. They were stronger together than they were apart.
Tony grinned and shared a knowing look with Natasha before they both belted out, "
Curious and confused, Tony continues walking. He continues walking until he finally comes across a shadow- can there be shadows? How does reflection work in the afterlife? of a man. Tony slowly approaches the man. “Um hi, I don’t suppose you really know what’s going on, do you?”
“You’re just... you. You’re beautiful.” Tony is seriously starting to get tired- Steve is so stubborn.
"So are you!" Clint retaliated, "I happen to like Hufflepuff."
“You’re not your father, Tony.” Steve spoke up, pressing his warm body closer to him.
The thing walked closer, “Something is coming... and it will be your fault.”
“You’re not my Tony, but you’re still like him. You know this isn’t right. I know deep inside you, you regret this. That you don’t want this.” Steve heard himself say, “I loved you. Tony I loved you. I’m so sorry. Don’t do this.”
“Your eyes, there are stars in them. Your hair is also star speckled. Gosh Tony, you’re beautiful”
"And then the last time, we ran in to each other in a party in LA. She... She treated me differently. She never treated me like a piece of meat, or like a rich snobby and important person. She treated me like I was her son. She was so nice and funny and sweet. She was the reason I didn't drink that night. She kept me in line. That night I told her how much I looked up to her. I told her that I was the kid at the first movie premier." The genius chuckled wetly, "She pulled a Han Solo at me by saying 'I know.' But I never got to tell her how much I really did love her. How I wished she was my mother, or at least a close friend."
“No. You are the message.” Tony grinned at him.
"Slytherin. Along with Buckaroo and Loki." Tony responded, not looking up from his tablet.
The boggart screeched and trembled before falling over. As soon as he hit the ground, its body began to crack like cement. With a loud snap, the boggart crumbled like a fallen rock statue.
Tony curled himself tighter against Steve’s chest. He still felt so cold. Steve grabbed a throw blanket from the back of the couch they were sitting on. He quietly wrapped them both in the blanket as Rhodey pulled out his tablet from under the couch.
“Who the hell are you?” Steve snapped, trying desperately to find his fallen weapon.
“Stay with me Tony. Come on, sweetheart.” Steve begged, tears tracking down his face.
Tony silently watched as the man he once looked up to, now withered with age, slept on without a care in the world. He watched as the older man twitched under his stare, as his eyes moved under closed eyelids. The man could feel someone there, someone watching him. Tony leaned back, smirking as he thought about the months it took to plan this.
Tony trembled before smiling softly, “Love you too.”
“Stay with me, Tony.” Steve kept begging.
“Whatever that thing told you, it’s not true. A boggart is just supposed to represent your fear, and for most people those fears won’t ever come true. For you, it’s simple. You are not your father. You don’t inherit your fathers legacy.” Steve pressed on, “You’re Tony Stark. Not Howard Stark. You make your own future. You make your own decisions. At the end of the day, you will inherit his company and you will get to decide what you do with it.
Peter and Harley both holding on to each other, tears tracking down their face.
“He’s were he belongs. In the stars. He will shine for us forever now.” Thor reassured.
“What are you trying to say?”
“Just stay with me. Carol went to get help. The others are fighting.” Steve whispered, gently rocking back and forth.
“L-Love you, St-Steve.”
Tony tilted his head to the side and narrowed his eyes thoughtfully, “I do want this Steve. I have all I could possibly want.”
Cold. Tony was cold. And tired. So so tired. But he couldn’t breathe. He couldn’t get anything else in. Sleep. Yeah sleep.
Tony’s worst fear. It couldn’t be that bad. Hopefully.
“Tony…” Steve whispered.
Two quiet hisses of air and almost silent thuds of bullets. The Captain carefully slid his weapon back in its holster.
He quietly pulled himself off Steve’s lap and went to sit back on the chair.
T’challa knew that introducing Shuri and Peter was a bad idea. From the moment they met, they had become the tag team no one wanted. Clint and Bcky were looking over their shoulder all the time. There was always a thick layer of anticipation as fear when all the Avengers gathered together.
"I can see Tony as a Gryffindor." Natasha pointed out.
“You’re not Tony. Not my Tony.”
"Why's that?" Steve asked gently.
Steve felt like he had been hit with a wave of ice cold water. He watched in silence as The Captain pulled out a gun, with a special nuzzle attached. In panic, Steve turned to look at Tony.
Shuri jumped on the nearest person in the room, which turned out to be Fury, and latched on with surprising strength.
“Making a statement.”
“I can get him out of here. There’s a place near he-“ Carol began.
He moved to get up. Pain washed over him like a tsunami. Tony gasped out and collapsed. His mouth filled with iron. He was struggling to breathe. The ground underneath him crumbled as he tried to move. With a jump, and help from his thrusters, he moved out of the way just as the ground gave way, tumbling down into a sinkhole.
Rhodey nodded and grabbed a tissue box from the large pile on the coffee table before throwing it at the archer, who caught it weakly. Clint nodded and crawled in to Natasha's lap, and let out a pleased sound at the red head ran her fingers through his hair.
“You okay?” Rhodey piped in, voice low and gentle.
“St-Steve. Warm. Home.” Tony was able to get out.
“Thanks, I- you too” Tony isn’t even kidding. Steve’s eyes are so incredibly blue, his hair is one with the waves, his suit is the wave. Everything about Steve was the ocean.
Okay, Steve definitely isn’t making sense, the stars, how can he have ‘stars in his eyes’ maybe it’s a metaphor? Or what about the whole star hair? Yeah, no. Tony’s not falling for that bullshit.
"Her memory will live on. I hope, Carrie, that you are happy and that you know how much we all loved you and looked up to you. How much I loved you and looked up to you. Thank you for being in my life." Tony said at the end of another speech.
"Pfft. I'm a Ravenclaw. Duh." Tony slapped the back of Bucky's head, "Brucey is too."
"Oh yeah." Clint nodded.
Tony cracked his neck and pulled out his wand, then walked closer to the dog (the last student’s worst fear). It tilted its head to the side before taking a step closer. The monster jumped up and swirled around as it began to take form.
"Why does everyone seem to have such a great story behind Carrie Fisher. I just really really
Tony nodded and kissed his boyfriend on the cheek before taking out his tablet and typing furiously on it.
"Thor, you just gave me another fic idea!" Tony squealed, "I'll use your picture as the cover for it. Steve, can you draw me a few picture, maybe you, Loki, and Bruce could team up to make a comic about it. Bucky, Sam, and Clint, could you guys make a trailer for it, please? And Natasha, find music for the video trailer and to inspire me for the fic?"
Pepper and Rhodey quietly whispered to them. Calming them after a few minutes. Happy, eyes red from crying, handed them some water. After a few seconds, they took in deep breaths before nodding at Rhodey.
Getting the other Tony’s friends to trust him had been tougher, especially Rhodes and Potts. They had hated him at first, would tense if he even moved the wrong way. Potts had immediately decided to keep her daughter from meeting him, said she did want to confuse her. But Tony tried for months to get their trust. And it paid off, Potts gave up her position of Stark Industries to Tony. Temporarily she had promised.
The soldier gently pulled him into his lap, has hands shaking. His body shaking with grief and dread.
"It won't be the same." Rhodey sighed.
“I just got you back Tony. I just got you back.” Steve sobbed as he pressed, “We agreed to do this together. I cant lose my home again. Tony stay with me.”
Natasha felt new set of tears push out against her will, she let out a choked off gasp. Biting her lip, she pressed her face into Bucky’s shoulder, her own shoulders shaking.
“Of course. Please continue.” Tony turned his attention back to Fury as he sat down at his chair.
He forgets Howard, he forgets the pain. He forgets Ty and Sunset- and Obie, he forgets the betrayal. He forgets... Steve and Bucky, he forgets Thanos, he forgets pain. He forgets the hurt.
Tonight was a night of celebration. Tonight called for rough yet agonizing slow rounds. Called for The Captain to slide in Tony’s still used and slick hole, to take him apart slowly. Bit by agonizing bit. A great way to start a new era. Their era.
They were expecting Howard or Stane. Or at least a spider. They weren’t expecting that. The boggart stopped turning, its back to Tony. Steve sucked in a breath. He recognized that back of the head.
He wasn’t breathing. No air to breath. Everything stopped. Wait. Have to tell him.
“The spell is supposed to turn something scary into something to laugh at. You’re just fell over and died.” Thor whispered.
Peter didn’t hesitate and threw himself to the nearest wall for him to stick to, all while screaming “YEET!”
“How long are you going to keep doing this, Mr. Stark?” T’Challa asked, a smirk gracing his lips.
“Riddikulus!” Tony yelled, his arm straight as an arrow, knuckles white from gripping his wand too hard.
“Don’t be hard on yourself, Tony. If I hadn’t met nakia, I would have surely tried to court you.” T’Challa winked.
The team, the Avengers were incredibly gullible. They all immediately took to him, as if trying to make up from their past mistakes of ignoring the other Tony. They trusted too hard, too fast. Mostly because he already knew who they were. They weren’t the same as his old team but they had similar traits. It also helped that they didn’t have a Black Widow.
"Victor is hot too." Bucky added as he plopped down on the floor in front of Tony while Steve settled beside his boyfriend.
“The man of Iron, Anthony Stark. My my” a strange lady greets him appearing out of thin air, startling Tony. “Jesus fuck please do it more subtly I have a heart condition” Tony slowly moves his hand to rub his chest where his scar and reactor is supposed to be to find nothing but a blank spot.
"Well I don't. I'm a genius. I'm a Ravenclaw." Tony said smugly.
“Tony belonged to the stars. For as long as I knew him, all he wished to do to was go o space.” Rhodey whispered, watching the ground get farther away.
“Till I get tired of your charming personality, my King” Tony grinned before getting out of T’Challa’s arms, “are you complaining? I thought you liked me in your arms?”
"WHAT?!" The other three exclaimed.
“Aye aye captain, lead the way.” Steve rolls his eyes fondly at Tony’s wording, both of them moving.
"I first met her when I was 7. Howard took us to the premier, and she was there. I had gotten separated from Howard when she found me. She told me everything was going to be alright and that my parents will find me later, she didn't even know who I was. She stayed with me through the entire movie, and she stayed with me until almost all of the people in the premiere left. Howard had left me, and it was Jarvis that picked me up. She was furious at my father for leaving me alone and forgetting all about me. Jarvis reassured her that he would take good care of me." Tony explained,
“Tony?” Steve’s voice gently whispered in his ear.
Why are you blaming yourself Tony questions.
Steve quietly hummed to himself as he rolled up the front door of his house. He still couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that had woken him up earlier than he was used to waking up. It had already been a pretty eventful day as it was, Sam and Bucky had almost forgotten that he was joining them for lunch. Which turned out to be a mission, and were using him as a cover, that he didn’t mind being but a warning would’ve been nice.
"That's daft." Steve sighed as he came in to the living room holding two bowls of potato chips, "I don't understand why someone could not like Yuri."
Steve let out a shaky sob before kissing Tony in the cheek.
It’s like the ocean- the ocean hair, the suit. It’s a recurring theme, it seems. “I, uh. I died too” Steve’s hands run through his blonde locks. “So it’s true? We’re really dead?” Tony’s voice caught in his throat as he speaks, obviously shocked. “I’m sorry” Steve says mournfully
"She was a beautiful and powerful woman." Sam whispered and rubbed soothing circles on Bucky's back.
“Being your own worst fear. How narcissistic of you.” It said.
“Angel of Death.” The creature hissed, its voice sounding exactly like Tony’s, “Just like your father. A murderer.”
Tony’s face twisted into a nasty scowl. His cold blue eyes danced with fury, “I was never yours to begin with.”
Someone grabbed his arm. Right, class.
Tony wiped tears away with a fist and made grabby hands at Rhodey, who handed him a tissue. The genius muttered a thanks before blowing his nose.
“You will kill so many people, Tony Stark.” It said, taking a step closer.
“Just let him be” Sam sighed before pinching the bridge of his nose.
Tony’s breath was becoming more erratic, his chest beginning to feel like it was being crushed by a giant. The creature tilted his head to the side and its grin stretched.
“Tony... no...” T’Challa chuckled
“We end this now.”
“I love you Tony. I believe that one day you’re irony of killing off your legacy will become a reality. You are so incredibly strong and brave. So smart and kind. You’re a pain in the ass but I love it.” Steve whispered in his ear.
He remembers Steve- Steve sketching in his worksop, Steve cooking breakfast, Steve’s bright blue eyes, Steve gleaming after his morning run, Steve being- Steve. Steve who’s with him now, Steve who’s next to him.
“–I feel like I’ve loved you for so long, Tony. And I feel stupid at how long it took for me to talk about it, and above all I still did those things to you and I just can’t forgive myself for it.” Steve finishes.
"2016 sucks ass." Bruce groaned.
Shuri and Peter burst into fits of uncontrollable laughter as Steve glared at T’Challa and Tony.
———————
It was a beautifully edited John Watson and Sherlock embracing each other in the rain, and from the looks of it, after a case. John had a near death experience from the way Sherlock was holding him. All of a sudden Tony got an idea.
Tony snapped out of whatever trance he had been in and looked around. Everyone was around him, eyes filled with concern. Carol handed Tony a cup of warm tea. Tony wrinkled his nose at it before taking a small sip.
“Who the hell are you? Get out. I will call the Avengers.” Steve warned, already pulling out his phone.
Tony blinked before stumbling to correct himself, “Not like that. I find it funny when what is assumed of me dies because I know it wont ever go away. Yes you all believe in me, but... its supposed to be irony. In a way.”
“Did Bucky fall asleep on the floor?” Clint asked suddenly.
"He's so hot." Clint moaned.
“I hate seeing me like this.” Steve, other-Steve growled.
"Everyone loved her." Thor said.
They rode in silence, those who were alive. The team, the remainder of the team, had already spread Steve’s ashes in the ocean as the country led their own public burial with an empty coffin.
Tony blinks his eyes open, adjusting to the bright white nothing in the scope of his vision. He stands up after adjusting to the brightness of the vast white nothingness, his legs wobbly and his mind disoriented. And as he looks around to see nothing he grows more confused
It pained him to leave the man, but they had set up a plan and they needed to stick to it. So without hesitation Tony left the house, blue eyes scanning the empty street, watching as the moon began to sink on the horizon. He would be back to start the plan.
“Never thought you’d be the kind to settle down.” Tony whispered as he gently straddled onto Steve’s lap, carefully placing his legs to not hurt the older man, “Always so busy  with work.”
Tony was so tired. Tired of fighting. Tired of being played. Tired of being the bad guy to the people he cared about. But god, he loved Steve with all his heart. And here he was, dying and making Steve cry.
"She's dead. The world is ending." Bucky whined and sniffed.
"Tony... Babe, it'll be okay." Steve whispered as he handed the man a mug of hot chocolate with extra whip cream, marshmallows, and a stick of candy cane.
“I’m going to take you apart, baby.” The Captain promised as he bit down a little harder on the juncture of Tony’s neck.
Shuri arched a brow before climbing off of fury, “You couldn’t kick me out if you could.”
Steve let out a strangled noise and pulled Tony out of his mountain of blankets and held him against his chest. Bucky let out a whimper and curled up in to a ball.
“We’re here...” Carol said, her voice soft and gentle.
“It’s not your fault” Tony responds to Steve’s apology. “I failed to save you- I couldn’t get to you in time, I’m sorry” Steve- Steve seems so sad, Tony just wants to hug Steve. “Hey cap, you tried your best, okay? It’s okay, we're together now” Tony embraces Steve softly, which was returned shortly by Steve, the two of them being each other’s anchor for just a bit.
(And boy, had
Toni nodded, her expression one of grim resolve. She had the look of a person who could change the world with the sheer force of her willpower alone; as though any cynic who told her no, could just watch and see as she made it happen.
Thankfully, Bruce stepped in. “Think of it like a calculator,” the scientist explained, and the logic and facts looked like it was helping ease the green tint from his veins. Small blessings. “JARVIS can only do the calculations because Toni inputs the knowledge, or codes cues into him. Without her at the helm, he can make educated guesses based on the research that his servers have access to, but he won’t be able to give us a specific window because there’s nobody to enter the data for the calculations.”
“Liar,” Toni shot back, laughing softly. “Hey, Cap? When this is over, you know what I wanna do?”
” Swallowing a little, because the knowledge and the skill wasn’t without its toll, he added determinedly, “I don’t like it, but I’ll use it. Especially when it’s for Steve.”
Rhodey had been borderline homicidal with rage, but he’d submitted to Tony’s pleas to let it go. The Lieutenant Colonel had also been happy to let him crash there as long as he needed – Rhodey was the actual best and Tony would fight anyone who said otherwise – and it was the first he’d felt at home since sharing a dorm with the man at MIT. It was also where Tony had come up with Carbonell Tech.
Instead, it had been the feelings that had begun to invade his life for the genius he’d only known as a friend. At the time, he’d been convinced that she would never give him the time of day, and by holding on to the little novelty button, he’d have a small part of her, at least. After they’d gotten together, Toni had found it among his things, and even when she’d shaken her head and called him a sap, those brown eyes had sparkled when his response was simply to tuck it back into the pocket of his uniform. By then, it was his, and he’d grown used to carrying around a piece of his whole world with him.
Now, as he watched his girlfriend feign sleep, Steve had to wonder how she always knew what Peter needed and when.
Toni was used to high standards, and that extended all the way back to her childhood. Steve had heard many a story of how Howard Stark used to push the envelope in terms of what he could realistically expect from his only child and yet Toni, more often than not, somehow rose to the occasion. As much as she was upfront, now, about her father’s toxic child-rearing techniques, the genius had always reluctantly maintained that the Stark patriarch had, at the very least, primed her to face similar expectations in the rest of the course of her life.
He wondered what it said about him, that the voice of reason in his head sounded like his lover and so was pretty much the only one he would listen to, but Steve didn’t care either way. His consciousness/inner Toni voice was right and he would have regretted a blow up like that, especially knowing how everyone in their family loved Toni. Because he had to, Steve took a few minutes to calm himself down and clear his head.
When he could, he spoke. “I never drank much before, and even when I did, nothing too strong. I was just as likely to hack up an organ instead, with my medical history,” he added by way of explanation.
Steve didn’t hear much over the roaring of his blood in his ears, but suddenly, there were six SHIELD agents holding him back while Howard laid curled on the floor again, this time clutching an abdomen that, no doubt, housed broken ribs. The only thing Steve could bring himself to feel was fierce regret that he’d only managed to land one punch, except, had this been what had set Toni off? Had he protected the wrong person?
Steve lost his feet, sinking to his seat as the blood drained from his face. Peter… he was just a baby. He’d only started school a few months ago, and it had taken close to two weeks before he’d stopped crying when they’d dropped him off.
To be fair, with her windswept locks and red-rimmed eyes and pale, tear-streaked face, she probably wasn’t that much better of a sight.
A soft sound of distress left Laura’s mouth, enough that Clint knew the visual was scaring her in the same way it was scaring all of them there at the Tower. She’d gotten closer to Toni, slowly but surely, and the two woman had become close friends, similar to how Laura had befriended Nat. Though his wife was removed from the action, so to speak, it didn’t stop her from worrying about them; case in point.
Oh, fuck no.
“Drink?” she asked shortly before he could question it and check if she was okay, tossing her own back and going to pour out another two fingers of what looked like expensive whiskey. When Steve only nodded back, she produced another glass and repeated the process while kicking a chair towards him. He straddled it backwards and accepted the offered drink, rattling it to hear the ice hit the glass as she dropped heavily into the opposite chair, kicking her feet up on to the table.
“Greedy,” Bucky commented laughingly, but he knew better than to argue it. He flicked his head towards Peter. “Kid doing okay without her here?”
Sighing inwardly, Steve slipped back into parade rest. Until he touched down in Argentina, there was nothing else he could do except count.
As it were, at the time, his only thoughts had been a near constant loop of
Iron Man?”
Some deeply rooted instinct in Steve told him that there was something more to the question; something underlying; something that would either send him down the path of no return or steer them back to safe and familiar territory. The former option would open him up to the risk and uncertainty of unchartered waters, but the latter… the latter would close the door on something that he could no longer deny he wanted, with every fiber of his being.
“Feel like hooking me up, J?” she asked rhetorically, when she was better composed. Steve’s voice was suddenly the only thing in the world that she wanted to hear, wanted it in her ear almost as much as she wanted out of this ridiculous hole in the earth.
It took her a moment, her expression totally perplexed, before Toni realized what he was talking about. Her face smoothed out as she laughed softly, shaking her head. “You don’t have to apologize for that. Ancient history.”
“Your son,” he added teasingly, aiming to lighten the mood, “thinks that I’m easily confused, and that I need remedial classes.”
smile, that one that was soft and affectionate and a tiny bit awed, and usually reserved just for him and the team and, more recently, Peter. But mostly him and Peter.
“Oh man, you’ve got that stupid, sappy look on your face,” a teasing voice drifted over the air, making Steve grin despite the words. Bucky was pulling an exaggerated face of disdain, but his eyes were warm and happy. “Thinking about your girl genius again?”
Running a dry tongue over chapped lips made her wince, but it also brought her out of her reminiscing long enough to wonder how much time had passed. A glance at the watch that was still on the sleeping kid told her that it had been a little over three hours since she’d sent herself into that self-imposed meditative state of remembering, and if she’d run the numbers right based on the max speed of the Quinjet… well, that meant that her team might be there by now.
Right?
Steve had to swallow twice before he thought he could manage an even tone. “Name it, sweetheart.”
“Stop,” he rasped, the sound more of a groan than anything else. In a quick movement, because he wasn’t sure he’d be able to stop if he didn’t do it now, he manacled her wrists with his hands and pinned them behind her back. The action pushed her sinfully closer to him, making Steve growl slightly in equal parts desire and frustration, but it served its purpose as Toni blinked away the haze that had coloured her eyes a sexy shade of dark hazel.
Sure, he hated the guy and thought he wasn’t nearly good enough for Toni, but he wasn’t heartless, damn.
Thankfully, his entire body was being lifted, bed and all, before he could do something stupid like call out for her. He exchanged a bit of lighthearted banter with Erskine, more for the peace of mind of everyone else, and braced himself when Erskine called for Stark – whichever one of them – to start the process.
Steve’s first reaction was to crush the camera and the microphone of the reporter spouting all that bullshit about his girlfriend, but it was overshadowed by sudden realization.
She tutted in mocking disappointment, shaking her head. “I might’ve… but that ship sailed the second you laid a finger on him.”
For a long moment, Toni held Steve’s gaze, meeting turbulent blue with calm and steady amber.
“As you can see from the very precise hole in your boss’s head, I don’t miss my targets,” he stated, voice cold and flat and chillingly dark. Even to his own ears, Tony sounded like a predator, and the look in his eyes, the unflinching stance, was telling of how little he would hesitate to pull the trigger again. “Wanna see if this fancy new repulsor tech melts the skin from your bones before you can get a shot off?”
, out of
Catching her eyes with his, he offered a rough, “I love you, you know?”
Rhodey would have complained, only it worked wonders on Toni. Sounding a lot less frazzled, she answered,
Dimly, she thought that Steve would probably disapprove of her line of thinking, if only because he didn’t take her near-death experiences as lightly as she pretended to, but it was the God’s honest truth. Fire flared between them with the barest of provocation, and when it was combined with the sweet, dizzying relief that they’d survived whatever had been trying to take them out? It was positively
Presumably, the partner had answered non-verbally in the negative, because they were frog-marching him through some doors without any more abuse to his admittedly achy body. It had been a long time since he’d been beat up, and despite his familiarity with it, it was never nice to get a refresher course.
“They want you, Mr. Stark,” he answered crisply, without tact or care. “We can’t be certain, but based on their demand, these men are not among The Captain’s enemies, as they require your unique skill set and are willing to trade that, in exchange for The Captain’s life.”
Emotion stole Toni’s words. She knew, intuitively, that this gift wasn’t one that she could refuse or return; there was meaning behind it, an unassailable intent that was unspoken but understood, from one mother to another.
It was amusing, now, to think of how dismissive he’d been of Stark upon their first meeting. It was only after she’d come after him, and damn near bested him in combat to boot, that he’d realized what a worthy comrade-in-arms he’d come across.
“They aren’t even considering that you’ll fight back,” Bucky realized faintly, and Tony nodded a little grimly. That assumption was the long and the short of what his entire plan hinged on.
Apologies were pretty much the only thing falling from her lips, interspersed ever so often with an endearment or a reminder of how much she loved him. Now that he was safe; now that she had nothing to lose herself in except her own perceived failures and shortcomings; Toni couldn’t quite believe that she’d gotten her wonderful, beautiful, amazing little boy into this mess. This was all her fault; she’d been an idiot to bring Peter into this world, into this life where she was so constantly under attack. What right did she had to put him through this? What had she been thinking?
When the little kid had walked into the kitchen this morning, half-asleep and knuckling at bleary eyes, Steve had been braced for tears from a fresh nightmare and a wobbly demand for Toni. Peter still had nightmares of what little he had seen in the attack on his family ten months ago, and the only person he wanted or could stand after those, was Toni herself. He’d cling to her and refuse to look at, or even acknowledge anyone else, and for her part, the beautiful billionaire would simply put down whatever it was that she was doing, whenever and wherever she was doing it, and bundle Peter up in her arms, humming and rocking him until he calmed.
The first thing that jolted her to awareness, was a sugar-sweet little giggle.
As predicted, Steve’s arrival was heralded with the slamming of their door, but where it was normally Tony’s place to silently bait his lover until the former soldier snapped and yelled, this time, it was the brunet who was bubbling with palpable rage. Even though he knew it would only rile Steve up further, Tony preceded his words by thrusting the folder unceremoniously against the other man’s chest.
Swallowing hard, he yelled. “Just go! Get outta here!” Even as he spoke the words, he knew that Bucky would never leave him behind, but he’d hoped. He didn’t want his friend to die with him… so there was only one option left.
Toni narrowed her eyes at him. “You might as well be, you big moron,” she shot back, and though Steve enjoyed the fire finally being back in her eyes, he couldn’t say he appreciated the fire being meant to burn him. “Especially if you’re expecting me to jump up and down and sing a song because you’re going to be; what? The star-spangled man with a plan?” She snorted derisively. “Get real, Steve, come on!”
“Really?” Tony’s eyes snapped to Steve’s, and the fire in them was his first clue that he’d put his foot in his mouth again. “If you’re asking me that, you must really have as low an opinion of me as I thought.”
Hope y'all enjoy!
“Shh, sweetheart, I got you,” Steve rumbled soothingly, soft adoration taking the place of mindless desire for a brief second as Tony relaxed pliantly against him at the reassurance, all wonderfully trusting and willing. Raw need burnt it away again as Steve finally moved his hand underneath Tony’s boxers and gripped his hard length in his hand. He all but purred as Tony cried out with the contact, hips stuttering, trying to follow the movement as Steve languidly stroked him. “Feel good, darlin’?” he husked softly. “This what’cha need? Need my hand on ya?” As he spoke, he increased the speed of his stroking incrementally, and pressed sporadic kisses to whatever skin he could reach.
“If you
That in itself was another small comfort. Toni had fought, before, to return home, and would fight doubly hard now because she had him, the Avengers and Peter to come back for.
“He convinced my dad to send me with one of the regiments that were doing recon,” she continued, resting her own arms atop his. “Howard was supposed to go, he was meant to provide them with their tech, but Obadiah… I thought he was giving me a chance to prove myself,” she shook her head, obviously still irate with herself. “I was grateful. I was an idiot.” The words were spoken briskly, as if she were already decided in her harsh assessment of herself. Before Steve could argue, she continued talking, eyes fixed on a spot at his shoulder, downcast and reserved. Steve hated it. “He’d sold us all out to the enemy camp on the condition that they kill me. They used one of the missiles that I… I helped
“Yeah,” he answered for them, clearing his throat and stubbornly pushing away the little flare of unfamiliar heat in his chest that tasted a bit like disgruntlement. He didn’t care if Toni and Bucky were friends, or more than that. He had no reason to care about something so stupid. It probably wouldn’t even last very long, anyway. “We kind of owe her and Peggy for the rescue.”
So, yes. She had forgiven him and Toni could no longer be hurt by what had happened two years ago. They’d grown since then, as a couple and as a family, and just because his mind was intent on pointing out all the times that he’d been less than what she deserved, didn’t mean that Toni didn’t know how much he loved her.
Shellhead hesitated for a beat before replying carefully, “We’re working on it. There are still some avenues left to explore.”
Just in case.
The second, was that she was totally self-absorbed and had absolutely no regard for anything but herself. The woman actively tried to antagonize everyone from Dr. Erskine to Colonel Phillips and showed absolutely no hint of giving a damn as to how disrespectful and downright infuriating she was being. It was honestly a mystery to him, how she was still around, and for that matter, how everyone still seemed to be able to speak of her with equal parts affection and exasperation.
What the hell was going on?
“Well, you would know all about falling short of expectations, wouldn’t you Stark?” His voice was cold, acerbic even, as he spoke. Toni’s eyes widened briefly, the hurt expression somehow made worse by the fact that she was so surprised, as if she hadn’t expected he would be the one taking such a direct hit at her.
Tony was someone who seldom expressed his emotions, especially so freely, and in that moment, Steve realized what a priceless gift he’d almost never known he had. Tony’s love was a force entirely its own, stronger than any current and more addictive than any opiate. And it was his. Or, had been his…
“Okay” and hands interwined. Steve and Tony walks, they walk far until they encounter a tunnel. The grip they have on each other’s hands tighten, holding each other for a sense of comfort- so they won’t be alone, so they won’t be scared, because together? Nothing will beat them.
"But listen, Tony. Harry and Draco have so much UST it's impossible to ignore!" Natasha argued.
“Tony stay awake okay? I just got you back. Please stay awake.” Steve sobbed, clutching Tony to his chest, “Tony please!”
"No, dammit! That is just not correct, Nat! It's Harry and Hermione all the way!" Tony sighed as he placed his tablet down.
“Steve, you said no more secrets” Tony really wants answers “We’re dead, Tony”
Tony giggled and kissed Steve on the cheek as he remembered that great week. Steve nuzzled his hair top and then gently pressed his lips against Tony's for a few seconds before pulling away. His blue eyes were blazing with fanboy determination, "We got this. We are about to start another Avengapocalyps."
Steve gritted his teeth and pushed himself into the room, his gun raised. He froze. A gasp. The gun clattered to the ground.
Tony let his white and blue suit slowly wrap around his body, making sure to leave his throat exposed. He groaned at the roaming hands, letting lust fill his senses, cloud his mind, stir his cock. It had been too long since this. Too long of not being able to dance with each other, to breathe another one’s scent so intimately. The night before had been fast and hard and so so rough.
He stood up, grimacing at the pain of his bruised body. He looked down at his shield. Tony had made that shield while they had been in hiding. With a shaking hand, he reached over and tightened the straps hard.
“Baby, listen. It’s our song.” Tony gasped and stood up, turning up the volume a little louder, “Come here.”
“He’s happy now. He’s with Jarvis and Steve.” Bruce muttered as he stared out one of the windows.
“I love you too- I can’t believe it took us years and finally death for me to say that. God. I’m such an idiot” Tony nearly laughs at himself.
Huh, when was Tony moved to sit on the blonde’s lap.
______________
Steve cleared his throat, “Sorry to interrupt but we do have a meeting to finish up.”
"No it won't. But we will have to do. She might have died, but her memory still lives on. Carrie Fisher was an inspiration to all of us, in some way or another. She was a great woman and she will be missed. I wish I had met her. 2016 sucked ass, but in less then a week, it'll be a new year. So I say, we do something in her honor." Steve suggested.
“There’s more”
Tony laughed and sat down the cup. He rubbed his eyes in frustration.
Something is coming.
“Steve.”
"The Mortal Instruments is better than the show." Loki snapped as he and Thor walked in.
“So that’s why it spoke. It had to take a form of something but your fear was the words it said.” Pepper murmured as she pushed a stray hair behind her ear.
Tony looks around to the pale white surroundings. Closing his eyes, slowly starting to see some of his memories past by. His mother teaching him piano, Jarvis fixing his tie, Anna making cookies for him to steal, Every single time Rhodey helped him get up, when Rhodey told him they were best friends. When Happy saved him from a group of thugs, his and pepper’s first meeting- and first kiss. He remembers the Avengers, Bruce and his constant presence, Natasha and her constant mothering, Clint as a constant annoyance, Thor and every-time he discovers something ‘new’. He remembers his kids, Peter and Harley.
Loki seemed to agree, and pulled out his specially designed Art Tablet that Tony had provided for him, Steve, and Bruce to draw on.
That one sentenced is what ended the somewhat sanity of the Avengers. It was said by Doctor Doom about a year ago, during which he used robotic cicadas to try and take over New York city. Tony had been pissed and had maybe beat some robots a little too much since Doom had decided to attack right in the middle of his love confession to Steve. But that one sentenced seemed to spark the Avenger's interest.
T’Challa didn’t hesitate and jumped on the book case that was behind him. Clint and Scott also jumped on the nearest sofa all while trying not to step on anyone. Tony dropped his phone on the couch before diving to the floor.
“Waiting? Waiting for what?” Tony wonders, it must be really important to Steve. “I was... I was waiting for you.” Steve shyly says under his breath, just loud enough for Tony to be able to hear. “Me?” Questions Tony further. “Yes you, genius.” Why would Steve wait for Tony?
So they did their research. They began to google whatever they could to figure out where that line came from. Plus, they were bored. It had been months since everything went to hell during the War. So they needed entertainment. That's when they found out about Sherlock. Then it spiraled out of control from there. Now a year later, everything was still chaotic.
"What are you?" Bucky asked.
Filling up the darkness with a bright blue light. He was where he belonged. In the stars.
The boggart slowly turned and Tony froze. He heard the students behind him gasp. The creature could’ve turned to anyone. But there in front of Tony was himself. He had everything, from the messy hair do, to the smirk Tony always had on his lips.
“What does that even mean?”
Tony let out a sad and heartbreaking whimper before he buried himself deeper in his mountain of blankets.
“You don’t have to hide.” A voice rang out.
“Alright love birds, we have a meeting to finish.” Natasha interrupted.
"It's all Trumps fault." Clint hissed.
“What are you doing here?” Steve ground out.
The team stared at him with wide eyes.
Even knowing Tony for a short amount of time, his impact left a scar in her heart. She noted that Fury, sitting in the co-pilot seat, stayed quiet. Only staring at his hands or out the window every so often. Tony had impacted him too, no matter how much he denied it.
So there they were, in the middle of a debriefing when Shuri jumped up and screamed “THE FLOOR IS LAVA!”
“Just tell me, What do you really want to say? Why are you acting all weird”
“I’ve been studying you, you know?” Tony informed him, reaching over and pulling out a lollipop from Steve’s front pocket.
Tricking the kid was easy. Peter had been so desperate to have another father figure, so desperate to bring back a Tony Stark to their earth. So desperate to bring back Morgan’s father. If Tony cared, he might’ve even felt bad for tricking him into thinking he was actually good.
All the Avengers had Tumblr accounts and Archive of Our Own accounts. Steve, Bruce, and Loki got Deviant Art accounts, because drawing is their favorite thing to do. Bucky, Clint, and Sam got YouTube accounts to post fan videos. Surprisingly, Natasha and Thor were fantastic at editing pictures and memes for their fandoms. And Tony, well, he wrote. He loved to write fanfictions. They were his favorite. Especially when it involved writing about life in the tower and posting it on AO3, and his readers believing it was actually fiction.
“I’ll see you later, Wing Head.” Tony whispered as he left the room, “I got some business to take care of.”
The Captain grunted and stared at Steve with disgust.
and with a flash of light, hands still intertwined, they’re gone.
“Tony!” Someone yelled his name.
“Dear, let’s get out of here.” Tony huskily whispered, grinding backwards.
Pepper got up, wiping her tears away. The rest of the team slowly followed to the specialized compartment in the ship. One last goodbye. They took turns, all of them filled with grief. Rhodey broke down, shoulder shaking. Pepper laid a hand on his shoulder before she too began to release fresh tears.
"I could see it. Of course it's just for the one book and movie." Natasha agreed.
“It’s, I’m sorry too” Steve looks ashamed.
Sleep.
The team began to argue about what movie should they watch, while Natasha turned on the WiFi machine Tony had created the first year in Hogwarts since there was no WiFi in the stupid school.
Tony hummed and stood up, “I love this song.”
“Tony, my home wasn’t the Avengers. It wasn’t the tower, or the mansion, or SHIELD. It was... you. You gave me a home, just you- and that’s when- that’s how I realized I was in love with you.”
“Please, Nakia would tease you to no end. She might’ve even record what I said and post it online.” Tony stuck out his tongue as he climbed off the table with the help of the captain, “thanks steve.”
“It’s okay. I’ll be okay.” Tony gave Steve a crooked smile.
Tony turned to look at Steve with soft eyes. He could feel the tears trying to make their way out but with a couple blinks, they were gone.
“Together.”
It was getting harder to breathe. He was drowning, he realized. Drowning in his own blood. Oh wow. He couldn’t feel his legs. Steve yelled some orders through the comm. Another person joined them, Carol.
Tony hummed as he pulled the wrapper off, throwing it behind him, and placing the candy into his mouth. After a second he pulled it out and ran a pink tongue over it.
“No time.” Tony whispered, feeling the numbness spread to his navel and his fingertips.
“Let me finish”
"Ah yes. The Avengapocalyps." Loki smiled, "That was a great time."
“Okay. And?” Tony raises an eyebrow- is that supposed to be new? “I- I don’t know, I mean you’re a nice chap and all and I- never mind” Steve cuts himself in the middle of the sentence, Tony despises it when someone does that.
A day later, Tony Stark announced that he was currently grieving for the loss of the wonderful actress. And how he was planning to make a statue in her honor to be placed in Avengers Tower. The day after that SI announced a new foundation. The Fisher Foundation that helped with anything ranging between helping lost children to helping people who couldn't pay their medical bills. The day after that SI held a vigil in central park, and began building Fisher Homes for the Lost or the Homeless.
He turned the volume up, closing his eyes at the familiar and beautiful notes of La Vie En Rose. He gently swayed back and forth, humming along. Finally he opened his eyes and walked towards Steve, hips swaying back and forth, smirking as the man unconsciously licked his lips.
“There’s nothing wrong with you.” Bucky gently ruffled his hair.
Steve Rogers had died in the battle against Thanos. When he had gone back to be with Peggy he became Steve Edwards. Sam and Bucky still teased him endlessly for the name change but they understood. The ex soldier wanted privacy, and that meant becoming another man in the process.
“Tony! No no no no no! Stay with me Tony.”
Then he had also been invited back to the compound to check on the new recruits. Steve had tried to remind Rhodes that he didn’t need to approve training exercises, he wasn’t Captain America. Hell he wasn’t even Steve Rogers anymore.
"You got it!"
It wasn’t until weeks later that Peter and Shuri tried their stunt again, in the middle of a debriefing. No one was expecting it, but to be honest, they should have seen it coming since the weeks before had been fairly prank free.
Steve's own cup of hot chocolate cracked as he clenched his fist, "As much as I hate him, it's not his fault."
“I- yeah, you’re one with the stars and all.” Steve’s hands slowly comes off Tony’s hair. “Cut the bullshit, Rogers.”
Peter doubled over laughing while Shuri recorded Tony on her phone with shaking hands.
That’s when he noticed it. The suit mangled, blown off by the blast. Another yell and he could register the sounds of battle. Right, saving the world. A thud landed behind him and Tony raised his hands to fire, but then there was a clawed hand through his chest. Tony froze and gurgled out a gasp.
The Avengers nodded and got comfortable as the lights dimmed and Jarvis began the movie.
“Well I, uh. Okay. I’m here now” Assures Tony. “We can go”. At first, Steve seems to be silent- is he looking at Tony? “Let’s take a walk then” Steve finally breaks his stare.
“No, Tony. I... I could’ve helped you, I could’ve been there for you. But you know what I did? I betrayed you, I left you, I let you die” Steve takes a deep breath here, his palms covering his mouth.
"What's going to happen now with Star Wars?" Natasha said broodingly.
“And when we look up at the sky at night, we will know he is there. He will look after us now.” Fury spoke up, getting the attention of the two young boys.
“HEY! That’s my line!” Tony accused from his position in T’Challa arms.
Tony flinched “now that woman scares me. when Pepper, Okoye, and Nakia met, I thought that the world was going to end. At least my world.”
“Look, Cap. It’s okay. We’re here now, we’re together, and we have an eternity right?” Tony brushes Steve’s cheeks. “So let’s walk, let’s talk. Let’s forgive, let’s forget, okay?”
I believe you will be great one day. You will prove to those who doubted you or those who said you are your father, wrong. I know you. We all do. You can’t rely on what an abusive father, a creepy advisor, and a boggart tell you. We believe in you. I believe in you. That’s all that should matter.”
holding the limp body of the person he loved the most.
Steve glared, hands clenched into tight fists.
“Not quite.” Tony whispered and pushed himself forward.
Tony, with the stars. Steve, with the ocean. Both static and dynamic. A light to each other’s darkness. And together, they walk into the tunnel, white light instantly surrounding them, absorbing them.
“Tony? TONY! No...” Steve cried out,
“Together?”
Natasha and Tony exchanged looks before turning to the archer.
The Ravenclaw gripped his wand and opened his mouth to speak but found himself speechless. The boggart grinned and slowly began to walk up to the stunned wizard. Tony opened his mouth to speak again but the boggart talked first.
He couldn’t taste anything anymore. He couldn’t feel anything. Tony opened his eyes. Steve.
"He's the main character?! Someone explain!" Sam yelled as he walked in with his phone in hand.
“I’m not, Tony. You really are.”
“Well, Captain, what did you expect? He went back.” Tony informed Captain.
“Well what other reasons have you to be here but death, Anthony? Welcome to the afterlife” and just like that, she disappears leaving Tony even more confused and frazzled than before holy shit he’s dead. He died- he’s in the afterlife- why is he in the afterlife?
“I love you, Tony Stark.”
"No it won't." Clint cried out from his position on top of a bookcase.
“Get him out of here.” Coulson whispered.
Tony reacted before he could even think about it. No warning. No scream. Just a hard shove, which sent Steve flying a few feet away. The impact was hard and painful. It sent Tony flying, smoke made it hard to see. There was a yell far away.
“Your point is? Just tell me, okay?” Tony softly urges. “I fine- just, I... I love you, okay?” Steve turns his face away, both of them stopped walking. “You... what?” “I know, you think it’s weird and-“ Tony leans in to Steve, giving him a kiss to the mouth “Shut up, Steve”
Toni saw no point in denying it; not when she knew Steve would know better. “This whole mission feels wrong, Stevie,” she said instead, raking a hand through her hair. It wasn’t the first time she’d said so, but not even her lover could convince her that she was overthinking things. “Even more so now that we know it’s a bust. Just… swear to me that you’re being careful. You and the rest of the team. I’d love to swoop in for the rescue, but you know how nervous Happy gets when he has to babysit.”
