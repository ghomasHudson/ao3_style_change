Although, no, Bruce wasn't the owner of the dog, he was more than willing to care for the animal on Clint's behalf. The CDC workers found this agreeable and handed the dog over to his custody. Caring for the dog wasn't that bad. The dog seemed to know that the bathroom was outside and for the most part he didn't seem too interested in chewing anything up other than the tennis ball that was given to him by one of the CDC workers. The only thing the dog demanded was attention, which Bruce was more than willing to give. He even cuddled with the dog while he took his well-earned nap. It was rather nice.
"Hill," he explained. "I messaged her the other night to see if there was an incident report ready yet. She said no, but filled me in on what happened." Natasha slouched dramatically. "You know that was uncalled for." She nodded.
Once in, Rhodey used a payphone to call Happy. He updated the other man on what had happened and as soon as he said the words "taken to the hospital" Happy was declaring that he was on his way there, despite the fact that he didn't give Rhodey a chance to tell him
"All I know is that I shouldn't let you two go around damaging virgin eyes." Tony frowned.
"What else would it be?" he asked.
"Nothing," Tony said. "I was just thinking." Steve raised an eyebrow to try to prompt him further, but Tony did not elaborate; he just reaffirmed his grip on Steve's hand. "Look, I don't know what to tell you. All I can say is 'hold on, it gets better,' which is about the worst advice you can give to someone in any situation, but… I am trying to understand, okay? I know that doesn't make any of this better, but I am trying." Steve nodded.
So that is it for this story! Thank you for all the support you guys have given to this and the prequel, My Head's Above the Rain and Roses! It really means a lot and I hope you continue to follow this series into the next fic, Live to Rise, coming out 6/15/19! Now, if you're asking yourself, "why the long wait?" It's because I want to wait for Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame to come out. Captain Marvel takes place prior to almost every MCU film, so there could be stuff in it that effects what we know/understand about the MCU. Also, I want to find out where Carol Danvers has been for the past twenty years and whether or not I can change things up so she makes an appearance earlier on in the story. As for Endgame, there are rumors (that I hope are untrue) that the plot of that movie is going to be resolved through time-travel. Again, I want to see if this is true and if it is, how it affects the MCU timeline. Again, I hope it's untrue. As a writer, I know it's next to impossible to write a time travel story that doesn't contain plot-holes and contradictions. It's the nature of the beast and if the whole story focuses on time travel... Ugh, I don't want to imagine that headache. Personally, I think what it's actually going to be is travel between alternate universes/realms. I feel like that's what they've been spending a lot of Phase Three establishing, with Doctor Strange opening up the concept, Ant-Man and the Wasp focusing heavy on the quantum realm, and the rumors that Captain Marvel will have some focus on the quantum realm as well. So, yeah, that's what I'm hoping for. Sorry, this is a big block of text, and this is my awkward transition into the next paragraph.
"I…" she stammered out. "I'm sorry." She quickly turned and ran back inside the building. Not giving her a second glance, Tony turned and walked right out. He wasn't going to go back to the hotel, but he wasn't going to stay there, either.
"Do it." Tony raised his left arm and fired a repulsor blast at Knežević just as the man was going to lunge for him again. Knežević was knocked back, hit his head on one of the rocks, and fell into the water. Tony legitimately thought for a second that he killed the guy, but he was quickly proven wrong. Knežević's head bobbed up out of the water and he appeared to be doggy-paddling back to shore. Tony began running across the shoreline after him.
"You people are so petty," the Blonde God remarked. "And tiny." That made Tony take notice of something he hadn't before. Everything looked like it was being filtered through a wide angled lens and everything sounded much sharper, louder, then it was supposed to. He shut his eyes in hopes that it would bring everything back into proper focus. Damn sleep deprivation.
"Fury." Jessica pulled the elastic out of her hair and tried to redo her ponytail to make herself at least the tiniest bit more presentable. "You got my calls."
"Do we start going floor by floor?" Clint asked. Natasha thought about it for a second.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Sorry," he said. "I just wanted to make sure you were okay."
"Close up shop for me, would you J?"
"I always am." Slowly, her grin became more genuine. He was glad she believed him, because he sure as hell didn't. "I should let you go. I think I've monopolized enough of your time."
"Then what are you?" Clint asked.
Tony frowned and wondered for a moment if hearing Napoleon XIV in your head was a sign of hypothermia.
"She passed out in front of the holographic display about seven hours ago." Tony nodded.
"What about it?"
"You need to take time out for yourself," Carol said. "I learned that the hard way." Tony frowned, the few details he could remember of the story she told him coming to mind.
"I'm sorry about what I said earlier," he said.
"No," Tony confirmed.
"Thank you." Pepper sounded honestly relieved. Tony felt a pang of guilt for making her worry. "So, what's the plan here? Do you really think you'll be back by Monday or do you think S.H.I.E.L.D. will keep you longer?"
Thank you to mfaerie32 and guest reviewer Star for the reviews on FFN and FriedChickenNisha for the comment on AO3. You guys rock!
"Do it!" Steve's voice called out.
Natasha had the blade at Sharpton's throat in an instant. Although the interrogation and viewing rooms were supposed to be separated by a sound-proof wall (to prevent suspects from being able to identify investigators and victims by voice) but thanks to her enhanced hearing, she could hear a short scuffle go down in the next room. Likely, Steve had charged at the window and Hill had tried to hold him back. She couldn't blame him. She so badly wanted to make a move against Sharpton herself, but she couldn't. If she killed her now, they would lose all the information that she had, and they really couldn't afford that right now. Clint couldn't afford that right now.
"It's just what he wants," Steve narrowed his eyes skeptically at that, but eventually Natasha's questioning gaze met his eyes. She was silently asking whether she should continue what she was doing. Steve nodded and gestured for her to do so. Natasha then left, leaving the two of them alone in the kitchen.
, and it's certainly not going to work for the security of this company."
"And what would that be?" Lara asked.
"You speak of control," he said. "Yet you court chaos."
"All of that!" Knežević flailed his arms around to demonstrate what he was talking about. "Breaking into Stark Industries in front of a whole bunch of security guards and cameras without anyone even noticing! There must be a trick to it! Is there a trick to it? There must be a trick to it! I promise I won't tell anyone." Oswin let out an amused giggle.

The entire time he was watching the scene, Tony could feel a smile pulling at the corners of his lips. Although kids weren't his thing, he had to admit it was kind of heartwarming to watch that interaction. What really killed him though was the dad. He couldn't believe that someone would take their kid to bring a gift to their favorite superhero – especially with the prices they were charging for admission (all the profits of which were going to benefit the New York Battle Relief Fund.) That… Wow, that hit his feelings hard.
Tony trailed his tongue down to Steve's jawline, where he started to leave tiny kisses as he made his way south. He paused for a moment to pay special attention to a part of Steve's neck that he knew made him moan when nibbled and was rewarded in kind. Continuing to travel downwards, Tony left a trail of kisses, nibbles, and hot breath that lead right down to the hem of Steve's underwear.
"Space arson is a serious problem," Carol said with a shrug and a shake of her head. "So, what's the situation with Stark?" Fury sighed.
However, she had somehow managed it and the sun was shining brightly in the sky, indicating that a new day had dawned quite some time ago. Carol forced herself to her feet, stumbling slightly as she hadn't realized how cramped her legs were from resting against the cold, hard ground. She dusted her clothes off and did her best to straighten her hair out. It probably didn't do much to help her appearance, but she still had to try. She needed to look presentable if her cover was going to be believable. Although, it did quickly occur to her that she was going to need more than a simple brush-down to achieve that.
The first movie Clint ended up picking was
"Yes," was his only reply.
Tony was then led by a pair of agents to the other end of the room. A panel slid out of the wall, revealing a hidden doorway. Tony then followed the agents through the door down a narrow flight of stairs. At the landing there was another door that was twice as thick and had six different sets of locks; the door to the interrogation room.
"I'm sure she knows how much you appreciate it," Clint said. "Just be sure not to spend all that money in one place Mr. Richie Rich."
Clint moved his hands to his ears and snapped his fingers. It was a habit for him to check his hearing as soon as he woke up. Even if he could hear things immediately, he always liked to double check to make sure. He snapped next to both ears and confirmed he still had hearing. He snapped left, then right. Both ears were working properly. It came as somewhat of a relief. At least, until he heard an unseen person speak up.
"Oh," Bruce said. "Right."
"The hotel has a right to their property and the surveillance footage is considered their property," she explained. "We can ask them nicely for it, but if they give it to us there's a chance, we won't give it back. We can tell them we're law enforcement – which we're technically not, but whatever – but without our badges they have no grounds to believe us and even if we have our badges, we need to have ordered from a judge saying that the footage is pertinent to a criminal investigation and it is necessary for the hotel to hand over any potential evidence they have. Hence, why we also need the warrant."
"Are you kidding me?" she said. "No!"
"Well, seeing as none of us can be civil, I think we can all agree to adjourn this meeting," he said. "What do you say? Same time next week? Do you think that's enough time for all of you to grow up?"
Steve reluctantly complied and allowed Tony to throw a sheet, the comforter, and that fuzzy blue blanket over him. Tony did not bother to try to tuck the blankets into the mattress, figuring that just having the warm blankets on top of him would be comfortable enough for Steve. Once they were all spread out, Tony climbed back on top Steve, again resting his head on his chest.
"Subarian," she said. "Where is he?"
"Can you stick your foot behind your head?" Carol made a face at Clint's question.
Steve didn't seem to mind the sudden unplanned cross-country plane trip. In fact, from what it sounded like, S.H.I.E.L.D. wasn't doing much to help him adjust, just gave him a bunch of files and told him to figure it out on his own. Granted, they could just be keeping their distance as not to overwhelm him, but it seemed to Tony that they were going about it the wrong way. Steve needed to hear the full truth of what happened during his time gone, and he also probably needed to talk to a psychiatrist or something. Pepper had tried to make him go to one after Afghanistan (which he did eventually do, and it ended up being just a waste of an hour) and considering how messed up he was after that (and still is) he would be surprised if that even amounted to a quarter of the trauma Steve was facing now. Everyone he knew is either dead or in their nineties, the world's moved on sixty years without him, and to top it all off he was in the middle of one of the deadliest wars in world history when he went under, only to awaken in relative peace-times (ignoring certain aforementioned conflicts in the middle east). That had to do something to him psychologically. Tony would bet money on it.
"I am and I will," Pepper said. "Come inside, we have celebratory champagne."
"Dr. Banner," Steve called out to the scientist, who looked very awkward and out of place. He held out his hand for the other man to shake.
"'What the hell's my problem?'" She repeated. "'What the hell's my problem?' You! You are my problem, dumbass! You destroyed my home and almost killed me! God, why did I agree to help you in the first place?"
Hope everyone's enjoying the longest day of the year. Personally, I'm more excited about tomorrow. Pray for the Wicked and the Sims 4 Seasons both come out tomorrow and I'm going to be babysitting my six-month-old cousin who is the definition of adorable, so I can't wait! Also, there's something you probably can't wait for what's going to happen tomorrow... Ooo, you better get excited!
Recovering quickly, Natasha was able to dodge the next few punches Clint threw at her and spun around to land a kick directly to his hip. Clint fell back while Natasha used the opportunity to slip under the metal grating of the catwalk and spring back up behind him, managing to get another good kick in.
Carol opened her mouth to fire a retort back at him, but instead, she found herself getting hit by a golden beam. The pain was identical to that she felt before she was pushed down the stairs. Now that she could see what was happening, she learned where it came from; the woman on the left – Alpha, Carol was guessing – was pointing two fingers directly at her. From her fingers emanated a bright gold beam that hit Carol squarely in the chest. Carol raised a fist and fired at her sending her stumbling back.
Clint sighed. He knew if he locked the dog out again, he'd just go back to scratching on the door. He looked the dog directly in the eyes.
"Right ho!" Thor lifted Mjolnir and pointed the hammer towards the cockpit. "Set forth, metal sky bird and bring us nothing but safe tidings on our journey to this S.H.I.E.L.D." Thor set his hammer down rather gently on the seat next to him. Loki rolled his eyes at his brother while everyone else just stared.
Stepping over to the bag, Tony picked it up and took stock of all its contents. Everything he might need was in there, except for a sledgehammer. However, he only intended to use that as a last resort. So, Tony figured he could live without it for now. Besides, if worse came to worst, he knew there was one downstairs in the lab. It was no big deal.
"And her address?" The minute the words came out of Nina's mouth, the agent's eyes went wide with horror. Nina knew what the next words out of Duran's mouth were going to be, but it didn't make them any less devastating.
"I don't want to know how she can be so sure of that," Bruce said as he ladled the soup into the bowl.
After a few moments of circling, the connecting screen disappeared, replaced with nothing but a static blackness. For a moment, Clint was alarmed and began searching the screen for any indication of what went wrong. Then Laura's smiling face appeared onscreen and Clint was able to let out a breath of relief.
"Alright," Steve said as he made sure he had a good grip on Tony. "Let's go down the stairs." Tony muttered something incoherent. "Are you going to help me?"
Well, that wasn't completely disturbing. To be honest, the biggest thing here is that I hope no one's still pissed at me for the last chapter or pissed that I didn't immediately follow up on what happened the last chapter. Sorry, for some reason my brain wouldn't let me change the plan. This HAD to be chapter sixteen for reasons I don't fully understand myself and I'm the person writing it. Anyways, don't be shy. Leave a comment or a review if you liked this chapter!
However, once the elevator doors closed and they started moving upwards, Lara surprised him.
"You are better than me, Pep." Pepper opened her mouth to argue, but Tony didn't give her the chance. "Don't try to argue with me, because you are. You're one of the best people I know. I wouldn't have entrusted Stark Industries to you if I didn't think you were capable of being better than me in every way. You deserve better than me, which is why I completely understand the choice you made."
"What is it?" Oswin tried to take the papers from him, but Knežević quickly snatched them back and slid them back into his pants pocket.
"Why?" she questioned. "I already gave my deposition. What more do they want?"
"Ah," Lara said. "Smart idea."
"Well, Louise," he said, looking her directly in her glazed-over eyes. "I'm sorry you had to meet your end like this but know that your death was not in vain. It is for a worthy cause."
"Given the explosive nature of the reactions of the chemicals that were taken, it's not out of the realm of possibility," The ATF agent said. "Special Agent Natasha Ness, ATF."
"I can't." The devastated look on Steve's face caused a few tears to spill over the edge.
"Yes, ma'am," Steve said.
"Hey," Dante shouted. "I earn my keep!"
"He's drunk," Lara pointed out. "Drunk people are known to pass out in weird places and positions. Where in the suite do you think he could have gotten into? We'll start looking for him there and work our way through until we find him."
"What does that mean?" Tony knew what the real question wad underneath that one.
"Why don't you lean back?" he asked. "Try to relax?" Reluctantly, Tony set the clipboard down on his lap and did as he was asked. Admittedly, the seat was quite comfortable. It was real, dark brown leather and whatever it was stuffed with was soft beyond compare. It would be hard

"We had to warm up somehow," she said. "If it makes you feel better, I forgot to pick up marshmallows at the store and we had to do without."
"I would like to announce my resignation as Head of Public Relations for Stark Industries." Freeman paused as if waiting for the press' reaction. However, they didn't have any reaction. In fact, it was probably news to all of them that Stark Industries even had a Head of Public Relations, given Tony's notorious spontaneity. ("I am Iron Man," anyone?)
"But you did," Lara said. "When it happened, you called it abuse. That's why I stopped and let you go." Tony winced a bit at the revelation.
"Isn't there some sort of emergency?" he asked. "I mean, you're out here with no shoes or jacket…"
"You're not going to like what I have to say." It was the truth. He couldn't imagine a scenario in which Tony reciprocated his feelings. Tony didn't back down. He mirrored Steve's stance and looked at him dead on.
"Oh, that's all?" she asked.
"Alright," she said. "I'll call them but I'm just saying… Hello, is this West Hills Hospital and Medical Center?" As Conroy continued her phone call, Pepper opened the passenger-side door for Tony and Steve helped him get in the car. Although he was having a hard time staying on his feet, Tony was able to fasten his seat belt on his own.
Tony didn't give any response. He was, in fact, happy with himself and had no regrets. He didn't even try to argue with the points the doctor had made. He had been paying attention, at least to the part where she had told him that his immune system had been completely wrecked and it was imperative to his recovery to stay in the hospital, he just couldn't bring himself to care about his own personal safety at the time. So really, he had nothing to argue with her about. Except, maybe the fact that she assumed either Pepper or Conroy was his girlfriend. That, he kind of took issue with. However, he couldn't bring himself to argue about anything. Not now. The drugs were too strong.
Tony certainly did have a few words to say to the showrunner once the interview was over. Normally, that would be a job for his assistant, but Pepper had decided to retain her position as CEO of Stark Industries, "Natalie Rushman" discreetly made her exit in the days following the disaster that was Stark Expo, and Tony had yet to appoint someone new to the position. Regardless, the showrunner was extremely apologetic for the way the interview had gone, but the damage had been done and now Tony was going to be left to figure out the fall out of that. He just hoped that none of the press continued the wannabe big shot's crusade at the groundbreaking ceremony that was to take place that afternoon. If he could get through that part of the day, he wouldn't be "home free", but he would have one of the more stressful parts of the day done and over with and he couldn't wait for it.
"Okay," Charles said. "Is there any way you can say all that information a bit slower?"
"He'll be fine," Dr. Smith assured. "He just needs rest and to sober up a bit. Agent Drew, on the other hand, needs to get to bed STAT."
"What I'm trying to reach isn't another phone," he said.
"But Barton is." He hoped Barton was awake and heard that. He made a point to say it loudly, so likely, he did. Tony was just hoping he didn't do the wrong thing. The stern looks on Smith's face said that he might have.
"Both of you are free to go," Hill said. "You don't have to stick around here."
!" He pointed at the person in question. "He thought we wouldn't notice, but we did." Then, he turned his attention back to Fury's command post, covering one eye. He quickly realized that the setup probably wasn't entirely accessible for a man with only one eye. "How does Fury even see these?"
"It's cold by now," he said. "And I don't really want to reheat it. I'll make a sandwich." Tony nodded.
"Cropsey," Stark said. "You never heard that story."
"I still don't think this is a good idea," she said.
Deciding it probably wasn't the best idea to stick around any longer, Oswin ducked under the police tape and started to run. She ran for several blocks, not even paying attention to where she was going. She ran until her legs gave out underneath her, and even then she still tried to keep going, pulling herself forward with her arms until a cacophony of sobs overtook her.
He kept still as the footsteps got louder. His eyes were squeezed shut, silently willing the Kree soldiers to pass him by. He knew that if they caught him, the rest of the ship would be spared. However, it was far more important to his people's continued survival that he not be caught as he carried with him the key to restarting their civilization.
"So, it's alright not to let a pregnant woman into your inn, but if the baby's already been born, you're a monster?" Peggy gave him a look that clearly said, "not the point."
"Stark," he said. "Are you awake?"
"Well, in the weeks following, someone sent out letters containing anthrax spores to several news media outlets and politicians. Five people were killed, and seventeen others got sick." Steve audibly gagged.
"Why wasn't I informed of this?" Tony asked.
"Of course," JARVIS said. "According to web searches, when mixed with alcohol, Ketamine can cause prolonged periods of sleep and drowsiness, along with a lowered heart rate and shallow breathing. Other complications include difficulty breathing, arrhythmia, and potentially death." Rhodey's eyes went wide.
"Does…?" She tapped her chest with her two middle fingers as she said that. Natasha knew what she was trying to say and shook her head.
"Anytime," Carol assured. "You don't need to apologize to me. Though, there may be some sick orphans out there somewhere that need an apology."
Either way, the ultimate outcome was that Tony had to go to the board meeting, forced or not. He did not put up a fight when Romanoff came to collect him (which came as a surprise to her) and took his usual spot next to Pepper once he made it to the meeting room. Romanoff sat to his right with a laptop open in front of her, fingers poised to start typing away. Likely she was taking notes for Lara so she would know what was going on when she came back. Lara always seemed to like to have detailed notes. Tony never really understood why.
"I just found the bottle on the floor of my bathroom," he said. "Someone must have dropped it at a party or something…" Rhodey did not exactly look convinced, so Tony let out a noise of frustration. "Look, I don't know what to tell you. That's the best answer I've got."
"Fair enough," she said. "I'm rarely ever here on business after all."
"Yeah," he said. "I'm talking about the robbery thing."
person, let alone
Because it was just nothing.
"On that desk over there." Steve pointed over to it and Natasha quickly spotted and retrieved the files. "What do you need them for?"
"It's no problem, Captain," Fury said. "Although, next time we meet you're going to have to explain why you and Stark haven't disclosed your relationship to S.H.I.E.L.D."
"But you're not the only people out there, are you?" Fury countered. "And you're not the only threat. The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, that can't be controlled."
"No." Steve shook his head. "I couldn't watch. I wasn't allowed to see her at all." Steve took a deep breath before continuing. "Before the serum, I got sick often. I had a few conditions that weakened my immune system and as a result, the doctors wouldn't let me visit her. The last time I saw her, she was leaving for work. She was coughing a lot, but she told me not to worry about it, she'd be fine."
. The pre-taped appearances went off without a hitch, but the live interview had been a disaster. Not only had the words "merchant of death" come up a few times, but also several inquiries into his personal life that he'd rather not answer. It was obvious that the woman interviewing him – God, he couldn't remember her name – decided to use this as an opportunity to advance her career and went so far off script that someone could have easily mistaken it for a taping of
"What the…" Freeman stammered. "Why the… That was so dangerous! I could have been exposed!"
"Yeah, the glass repair guy isn't going to see it that way," Tony explained. "Nor the wall plaster guy."
"Thanks," was all he could say in response.
Glancing down and kicking a pebble on the ground as hard as he could, Knežević realized he was completely and utterly screwed. He had no job, no money, no solid place to live, and now the police were after him. He'd be surprised if he'd even be allowed to breathe the same air as Audrey and Stephanie again, never mind be in the same room as them. He brought his hands to his face and thought about what he could possibly do. All he had to his name was a box made of solid rock. He doubted Audrey could even buy a pen from the dollar store for all that was worth, let alone pay for college.
"I could go in there." Every head in the room snapped around to stare at Tony.
"It's just something to think about," he said. "We can discuss this more when you're in a better state of mind. We'd be lucky to have you though, Tony. We could use someone like you."
"Hey," she said. "It's okay. I'm okay. Why don't we go inside, and I'll fix you a nice cuppa tea? That sound good?" Nina nodded. "Alright, come on. Let's go inside."
That was all in the past now, though. They had to focus on the present, which was the Q&A session. Although, yes, it was open to the public, every single person had been vetted by SI's PR Department, S.H.I.E.L.D. and a few other agencies. After all, there were quite a few weirdos out there and even more people with just plain bad intentions. It was much better to be safe than sorry.
"What is this?" he asked.
"It is," Lara said. "And I am filling out Tony's information. …Well, except for his insurance information and social security number. I don't know that. I'm just asking you the questions on this form because how else are you supposed to invasively get to know someone?" Steve didn't have a response to that. "Last name?"
"Probably by having those team meetings more often," Natasha said. "And training."
"I'll be on standby," Happy assured and shortly after the call ended.
"Nice to meet you," Steve said. "I'd shake your hand, but I can't seem to lift my arms… They're weighed down."
"If you're in need of that, I know a group that can help." Again, Salinas began squeezing Tony's foot in an uncomfortable manner. It was like he was trying to give him a foot massage. Tony didn't like it. He tried to pull his foot away, but Salinas wouldn't let him. "I was lost once, but they helped me find the way. They're all about faith and helping the community. I think you'd like them. They're called the Peoples Unity Church. Does that sound interesting to you?" Tony remained deathly silent and just stared at Salinas.
He heard Laura take a deep breath, as if to compose herself. If Clint were with her right then, he'd take her hand and give it a little squeeze to reassure her that she could say anything to him. Unfortunately, the thousands of miles between them made that impossible.
him in the same bed, but it wasn't like that." Surprisingly, Pepper laughed.
"Because if you don't, I'm going to have to restrain your arms." Tony raised his eyebrows suggestively.
Last Chapter! Hurrah!
"If I let go of the shard for a second and come back, will you not immediately overwhelm me with all that information?" Marx gave another nod and Charles broke his connection with the shard.
"I took a cab," she shrugged. "I'm not supposed to drive or operate machinery until I know how Lotensin affects me. Which is a real shame given I've just gotten my license to operate forklifts, tanks, and small aircraft."
"That's arguable," Tony said.
That didn't stop Tony from letting it put a damper on his mood, though, since it was a little bit hard to fantasize about having sex with his handsome, muscular boyfriend when he had to be paying attention to a woman explaining how and when it was appropriate to touch a co-worker. (The answer was never.) It was truly a buzzkill. Tony spent most of the time the HR woman was talking playing around with the signal coding on his phone. He was surprised he got away with it if he did before Pepper swiped the phone out of his hand. Tony looked at her flatly.
Once he got dressed, he went downstairs to find Conroy standing at the landing, waiting for him with a glass of water in one hand and something enclosed in her other fist. He raised his eyebrows as he reached the bottom of the stairs and she grabbed one of his empty hands and deposited three pills into them.
Quiet.
"Eh, that doesn't mean I can't take a crack at it." Lara walked around the counter so that way she could get a better view of the writing at the proper angle. The paper Bruce was doing his calculations on was cluttered, but Lara was able to find where the problem started easily.
"No." Lara had been in both positions and found order-taking to be a lot less stressful.
when I need to be."
"We do
Tony stopped himself from adding that. He didn't need to open that dark can of worms. Not now. Everhart tilted her head slightly.
"Can't say I can fault you for that," he said.
Carol retaliated with a punch of her own, but Beta twisted out of the way. She grabbed at Carol's left arm, trying to use it as leverage to pull her down. Carol punched her hard on the temple, with her right hand and this time she did not miss. Beta crumpled to the ground but tried to grab Carol's ankle in a last-ditch attempt to prevent her from escaping. Carol used her other foot to kick Beta hard in the stomach, forcing her to let go.
"Yeah, we're not going to that," Lara said. "I've already worked it out with Pepper. We don't have to go."
"So what?" Tony said. "You want me off the team?"
"Really?" she said. "Why don't we ask the man in charge. Steve?"
"I get that," she said. "I really do."
Tony looked up at Conroy and grinned. This was just too easy.
"Really?" she said. "Are you sure you don't want to go somewhere more comfortable? Get some rest?" Tony shook his head.
"Then what's the problem?" Natasha looked down, truly looking like she didn't want to say what she was about to say about another person.
to. Yes, taking over Midgard and waging war on Asgard was his ultimate plan – even if he did manage to forget that sometimes – it wasn't a full-proof one. Mostly because he idiotically trusted Thanos to hold up his end of the bargain. Hell, Thanos never even technically agreed not to invade Asgard. He just said he'd consider it and that was the end of the matter. For all Loki knew, he'd been played the fool and Asgard would be next up on Thanos' hit list. His kingdom… His
"That's the same thing," Adoniram pointed out.
"Sara," Barton said. "That's a pretty name." The girl's cheeks turned a little pink.
"Of course not," he said. "Unless Tony tells me to go, I'm not going anywhere." Rhodes' smile widened.
"Really?" she said. "What about?"
"But weren't you just talking to him?" Tony asked.
Happy nodded before moving to shake Lara's shoulder. She was startled back into alertness but didn't lash out, which was both a good thing and a testimony to how tired she really was. She allowed Happy to help her stand up but refused any assistance outside of that and let Tony lead the way out the door. Happy followed as well, likely to make sure Lara didn't pass out on the way to the elevator. Luckily, the movement was enough to keep her conscious until they got inside the elevator.
Happy Canada Day to all Canadians! Enjoy the freedom you politely asked for and was given rather than just throw a tantrum like a spoiled toddler and take it yourself! (Looking at you, America!)
"I'm your fella?" Steve smiled and wrapped his arms tightly around Tony.
"Of course," Steve assured. "I'll stay with you."
"Who else knows?" he asked.
"I guess so," Clint said.
"I can see that," she said. "How's Tony?" Steve sighed.
Yeah... TBH, this is the closest I'm probably going to get to writing porn, so enjoy it, people. I'm not giving you any more than implications, cut-to-black, and coitus interruptus. Hate me all you like, but I'm not comfortable writing it, end of discussion.
"Why didn't you do anything sooner?" Rhodes sighed.
"The robbery wasn't caught on tape at all," Bergeron elaborated. "We have nothing."
"I have implants," Clint explained. "S.H.I.E.L.D. installed them. They actually allow me to hear better than I did before." Mostly because he had already had twenty-percent hearing loss before he went totally deaf and the implants brought him up to the level of a person without any hearing loss.
"Where the hell did that come from?" he asked.
The elevator ride up to the penthouse was uncomfortable to say the least. Lara was leaning against the far wall, eyes squeezed shut; Pepper had a hand pressed to the bandage on her cheek, gently rubbing it as if the action would alleviate the pain; and Tony… Well, Tony was just trying not to let his dread about the next day eat him alive.
"I know that a blood-alcohol of one point oh-two six is certainly pushing the limits." Stark's eyes went wide.
A pang of guilt ran through Tony as he watched Steve rush out of the room. He shouldn't have said anything, that much was clear, but Steve had been very apparently distressed. He didn't mean to push him. He just didn't want to see him that upset.
"Talk to you Monday," Pepper agreed. "Remember to take care of yourself."
"Of course, we do," he said. "Lay it on me Romanoff. If you have anything to say, say it now." Natasha took a deep breath and went back in her mind. She scrutinized every interaction she had ever had with Stark as best she could on such short notice.
However, he knew that with this new villain, something had to be done about them. That's why he had taken an interest in Freeman. His position in Stark Industries put him close to a lot of big players, notably Tony Stark himself. If he could discover a weakness or flaw that Stark or the Avengers had, then maybe they could exploit it.
"Yeah," Clint said. "But I was a part of it."
"Will do," Bruce assured.
"Oh, God, yes," Stark said. "That'd be solitary confinement."
"I'll be okay for a bit," Tony assured before a sudden spell of dizziness struck him. He caught himself against the wall before he fell, and Steve rushed to put an arm around him for additional support. "Thanks."
"Yes," the woman said. "Well, sort of. Agent Jennifer Duran, Department of Homeland Security. How can I help you?"
"I know I know," he muttered in response. Slowly, he dragged his head up to look Steve in the eyes. "I just wish we had more time together." Steve gave him a warm smile.
"Captain Rogers just woke up," Fury said. "He needs to be looked over by a doctor before he has any visitors."
"Yeah, mostly," she laughed before turning to look behind her. "You know Bruce and Steve obviously."
"This better work," he said before taking a sip of water. It was nice and cold and felt good on his throat. "I've tried literally everything already."
"Steve," he heard Clint say. "Let's go."
"She hurt my
"I'm willing to take that chance," Carol said. "Do we have a deal?"
"I'm sorry," he said. "Shouldn't I be asking you that? After all,
"Oh, you are," Coulson assured. "Absolutely. Uh, we made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input."
"Are you mad at me?" Steve shook his head.
"Clint can't leave the bed," she astounded pointed out.
. Tony directed his gaze from the wall to his lap.
Tony looked up at the sky with a flurry of emotions running through him, most of which he couldn't describe. An entire legion of alien soldiers on what he could only describe as flying motorcycles were emerging from a giant hole in the sky. Every possible warning indication that his suit could give him flashed onscreen, changing the HUD display from a light sky blue to an intense, bright red. He was glad he had that he had that drink while he had the chance.
"I second the motion." Tony gaped at Steve.
"You would generally describe yourself as happy, though there are times where you feel sad."
"Are you ever not going to fall for that?" he had his illusion ask.
"Well unfortunately for you, I know I'm not your type."
"We moved the TV in your room so it's facing the bed," she said. "And none of us have anywhere we need to be for the rest of the day."
It was looking like the better idea was to cancel the flight and try to ride out the withdrawal symptoms in the hotel, that presented problems in and of itself. Most notably, the fact that they were staying in a
"What did you do next?" Hill asked.
When Tony walked out of frame for the second time, Steve felt himself deflate like a balloon. For one dark second, he considered the idea that was the last time Tony would be seen alive. The thought made his heart ache, but he knew the possibility could be all too real. Thankfully, the others weren't thinking along such dark lines.
"What's wrong?" Steve asked. Natasha shook her head.
Carol Danvers."
"We had just gotten into that argument about our post-graduate studies," Bruce said. "You can't tell me that wasn't on your mind."
"Try me," she said.
"Hey," he said back. "They want to take a blood sample."
"You mixed Ketamine and alcohol because you wanted to sleep?" All attempts to keep any note of incredulousness out of his voice failed. Tony shook his head.
Before Thor could attempt to get another blow in – or worse, plead for him to stop again – Loki rolled sideways off the edge of the balcony and down onto one of the hoverbikes piloted by the Chitauri. He quickly grabbed ahold of the controls and started piloting the vehicle himself. No one was going to stop this invasion or deter his plans. Not even – apparently – himself.
"You're not okay." It was clearly a statement, not a question. Steve shook his head.
Tony wasn't sure why he was doing this. It wasn't like he'd ever met the man before or knew anything about him. Well, that's not true. He knew what others had told him about Steve Rogers, but that wasn't the same as knowing the man himself, especially when you considered the high pedestal that Howard Stark put Captain America on.
It was only eight o'clock at night, but Steve was at a loss for what to do. He was wide awake and couldn't focus on reading the files anymore. He would go and do something else, but apparently, he was only allowed to be on this floor. The door to the stairs was locked and every time he tried to go down in the elevator, it just stayed in place with the doors wide open. He also hadn't seen a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent all day. He supposed they were trying to give him space to adjust, but Steve was finding it more frustrating than helpful.
Despite her best efforts, Lara was unable to fall asleep. She tossed and turned until her alarm went off, mind a wreck with worry. Honestly, Lara was questioning whether she should go into work. After all, she wouldn't be doing anyone any good if she was falling asleep on the job. At the same time, though, she wanted to know what was happening. Neither Bruce nor Pepper had texted her any updates, which only served to worry her more. She wanted to know if everyone was alright. Sure, the CDC had told Pepper that Tony, Steve, and Natasha were okay, but Lara wanted a little more confirmation than that.
"Christ," Lara said as she walked into the room with four champagne glasses in-hand. "If that's how much credit Pepper's getting for this, I don't wanna know how much I've earned."
"Alright," Natasha said. "This is now a non-stop flight back to S.H.I.E.L.D. Tactical HQ. From now on if you jump out of the plane, no one's coming back for you. Any questions?" No one spoke up. "Good. You boys might want to strap in. We have no time to lose and this ride is going to get bumpy."
The hospital they ended up taking her to was Metro General. It was apparently the closest ER/trauma center. She had to remain strapped to the stretcher as she was wheeled inside and as they triaged her. She figured she probably should lie, but honestly any lie she gave they would probably figure out, so she told the truth. Her name was Carol Susan Jane Danvers. She was born on October 1st, 1959. She had no idea what her social security number was, and she didn't have insurance. No, she wasn't pregnant. Yes, she was sure. She was over fifty, she'd had a hysterectomy, she hadn't had sex in more than a year, and the last person she had sex with was a woman, so she could be certain. It was all incredibly irritating – especially since it didn't look like the nurse taking her information believed her. Despite that, the woman still punched in all the information Carol had given her. Whether it was because she didn't want to put up the fight or because she thought Carol was delirious from her trauma, she wasn't sure but whatever the case, they ended up moving on to the next stage of process – removing Carol's clothes.
"I'm a reporter, Mr. Stark," she said. "It's my job to find out what the public wants to know."
"I still want you, too," Tony said. "But these hang ups aren't going to hold you back forever."
"As I doubt it would," Tony commented. "Go on."
"Alright," she said. "I'll be over there when you're ready to start." Lucy then started to walk back over to the storefront. Lara looked at Bruce.
While he worked to serve Loki, he somehow felt like he was on autopilot, or more accurately in cruise control on the fast lane. He was in complete control of the car. He knew what he was doing or where he was going, but at the same time, he wasn't really the one making the car go. His foot was off the gas pedal and he could go nowhere but straight to whatever destination he was supposed to arrive at. It was disconcerting, but he couldn't really think on it too much, lest he is forced to sit through his mind's featured broadcast presentation once again. So, he let it all go and just focused on serving Loki. That really was all he could truly do.
"I'm guessing that's not AM?" Pepper shook her head. "Shit. I hope the subway is still running. I don't want to have to catch a cab."
"Well, don't let me stand in your way, then." Happy remarked.
Her day had been largely uninterrupted. She got a text at one point from Tony asking if she knew his social security number (which she did, although texting it back to him almost certainly meant that she was going to have to memorize a new one) but other than that, she got no texts or phone calls, which she was thankful for. All in all, it looked like she was going to have the peaceful day she'd been longing for weeks, and she could finally just let her guard down.
"You want to waste time looking for one, be my guest," Pepper said. "Meanwhile, we have an emergency situation and I'm sure Tony would very much appreciate getting the treatment he needs without getting accosted by the press."
"Good," she said. "How much of the poison has spread through his system?"
Tony did as she commanded as she ran a few more tests. With each one, the doctor seemed to grow even more confused.
Tony started to look like he might be starting to get overwhelmed, so Steve gave his shoulder a squeeze. Tony turned to look at Steve with glistening eyes.
"Headache," instantly came out of Tony's mouth. "I've been getting them on and off for months, but this one just won't let up."
"Yes, I can," Steve said. "Especially when I know what the reality is going to be. I'm going to lose Tony just like I've lost everything else." Steve's voice broke a little bit at the end of that sentence. Natasha said nothing, just waited for him to be able to say something again.
"Of course not," Freeman said. "The Reconnaissance and Covert Missionary Practice."
"Yes," Tony said.
"We have a plan," she said. "Of what to do about Tony. We want you on the same page."
"Cropsey ended up being real." Clint found himself narrowing his eyes skeptically. "Some sick fuck murdered a little girl with Down Syndrome and dumped her body in a shallow grave near a hospital connected to the Cropsey legend. They caught the guy, thankfully, but they think he might have had more victims."
"I don't know," was the only thing he was willing to offer the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Mostly because he was still so confused by what Tony had said. Honestly, the man seemed genuinely surprised when Steve suggested that they could get arrested for being gay. Tony had said people didn't "think like that now." He shook his head. There was no way this was thought of as "normal." It was an unfixable disease. People who were unfixable either went to jail or the asylum. That's just how it was. He wasn't going to tell this woman that he was attracted to Tony, especially when it seemed she already had it out for the guy, given the incredibly inconsistent misleading character assessment she wrote of him.
"Steve." He'd give her his last name if she asked, but he was hoping it wouldn't come to that. "I'm here because Tony asked me to be." The woman nodded, seemingly accepting that response.
"You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to," Steve assured. "I just wanted you to know I know."
"No," Tony assured. "You didn't. You're good. I accept your apology, though I wouldn't go so far as to say that you were abusive."
Special Agent Bergeron sat at his desk and tried to enjoy the ham and cheese with mayo he brought for lunch. It was a lot harder than he expected because how could he enjoy his sandwich when this case wasn't going anywhere? Finally deciding that he wasn't hungry, Bergeron put the sandwich down and went back to his hopeless search for leads.
"Look on the bright side," he said. "At least we learned that the easiest way to tame the Hulk is to give him a puppy." Natasha looked up, giving Clint a confused look before turning to Bruce.
How could she have ever thought that this was Dante? Everything was spelled correctly, and the message was very polite. Both were dead giveaways that it wasn't him. She was just so scared and exhausted that she was willing to run with whatever conclusion her brain happened to come to first. Not to mention that in running with that conclusion, she snapped at Bruce, who honestly didn't deserve that kind of reaction. After all, it was just a text from a person who – as far as Lara had heard and could tell – was a completely decent human being. (Unlike
"Nothing," she said. "It's just refreshing to hear." After all, it wasn't a statement she heard from men often. "So, you're worried that if you go near her, she's going to get hurt."
Tony had been up most of the night, preparing to take the tower off the grid. While he was doing some electrical work (because apparently the electrician he hired chose to ignore him when he said to wire the penthouse to both the main city powerline
"Quiet," Natasha said. "The crying stopped a while ago. I think they're asleep."
"They won't have to look far," Clint said. "I mean, I'm right here."
"Uh," Bruce suddenly spoke up. "Okay, I'm sorry, but I have to ask, when did all the flirting and the kissing start? Not that I have a problem with it. Good for you guys, but did I miss something?"
"Your conclusion, doctor?" The CDC leader did nothing to hide the aggravation and condensation in his voice. Smith sighed.
I am just a villain vying for attention from a boy, a boy who can't decide and here's the reason why...
Originally uploaded to FFN on 1/7/21.
However, all of that would not happen until years later. On that day in 1995, Rhodey just held out hope that Tony was okay and that he would be able to hold it together through the oncoming storm. Even if he could not, Rhodey promised himself that he would be there to help Tony out, because he had to. He just had to.
So, who's ready for some feels?
There had been a debate about whether they should return to New York as planned or not. On the one hand, withdrawal symptoms had finally hit Tony hard. He woke up three different times during the night to throw up. Each time he failed to make it to the bathroom, but luckily Steve moved fast and managed to grab a plastic bag or a wastebasket and get it to Tony before the contents of his stomach ended up all over the hotel's extremely lovely plush carpeting. After the third time, Tony went straight to the bathroom and laid down on the cold tile floor in front of the toilet. Steve joined him a short while later, bringing pillows and blankets with him. Both stayed on the floor until the first light of dawn.
"So you'll be back in time for the board meeting on Tuesday." Tony audibly groaned.
Looking towards the front, Tony saw that Lara had gotten to her feet. She looked a little shaken, but no worse for wear. He gave her a concerned look and she nodded, mouthing that she was fine. Reassured, Tony turned to look behind him and saw Pepper kneeling on the ground, cradling her right cheek. He started to crawl towards her before he heard a heavy board hitting the ground on the opposite side of the room.
"Alright." Oswin raised her glass with a little more elegance than her drinking partner. "What are we toasting to?"
"How would I mess things up?" The question was meant to be rhetorical, but Lorraine just felt the need to answer it.
"I have to go to work." When he opened his eyes again, a concerned look had spread across Steve's face.
"Sorry," Lara said. "I had no choice, given the situation."
Audrey walked through the house, continuing to call for her aunt. It was useless and Knežević knew that, but he wasn't going to reveal himself to the girls just yet. The moment didn't feel right. Eventually, Audrey came back downstairs heaving a heavy sigh.
"Doesn't mean you should," six voices spoke up simultaneously. Carol's shoulders sagged a bit in defeat. Tony gestured for her to come closer.
"Sure," Steve said, making room for her to walk by. "But couldn't you have done this earlier, or at least waited until morning."
"You know what?" she said. "I'll tell you why in court." She then turned on her heel and started ripping through the crowd, ignoring it's current completely. Even though Dante was literally being held down by the Peoples Unity Church, his voice still managed to follow her.
Clint was suddenly more grateful that he did not make that Lila comment. Natasha, meanwhile, let out a frustrated sigh before retreating into her room. She made no effort to try to close the door again, nor did she tell them to go away or leave her alone, so Clint took it as a cue that it was okay to come inside as long as they gave her space. He gestured for Bruce to follow him before stepping inside himself.
It didn't last, though. For half a second, Steve's eyes drifted away from Tony's and that was all it took for the atmosphere to completely change.
Steve quickly started looking for Tony. He was relieved to see that Tony was unharmed and was also surprised to see that he made it to the other side of the street without incident. Steve looked both ways to make sure no one else was coming before running after him. When he caught up, he grabbed Tony by the shoulder and turned him to face him.
"I just want the pain to stop," Tony said. "For you and me both."
"Of course." He nodded, but his tone didn't sound agreeing. "Well, I'll leave you in peace, then. Enjoy the rest of your night gentlemen, ladies." Salinas then turned and left the table with Freeman following closely behind him. As soon as they were out of his line of sight, Tony pulled his cellphone out of his jacket pocket.
Deciding he had spent enough time thinking for that morning, Steve carefully shut the compass, pulled himself out from under the warmth of the blankets, and walked over to the kitchen. On his way there, the stack of S.H.I.E.L.D. files sitting on the small dining table caught his attention. He had a lot of catching up to do and sadly it was seeming more and more like these files were only the tip of the iceberg.
"What?" For some reason, Tony felt like that came off a little harsher than he meant it to.
"Hey there," he said. "I was just coming to check on you." Tony smiled a bit.
"Yeah," Lara said. "I mean, we've only been texting for the past twenty minutes, but she seems nice enough."
"Okay," Lara said. "Does this have anything to do with the woman that Hill mentioned?"
"We believe that the Super Soldier Serum in his system kept him alive and the ice preserved him in a cryostasis-like state," she explained. "However, we know nothing about his physiology, let alone how much the Serum affected it. That's what's caused us to hit a snag on how to revive him. We've been treating him for hypothermia and so far, he's remained stable, but we don't know what drugs to administer or avoid. If we accidentally gave him something that would interact poorly with the Serum or his advanced systems couldn't process, we'd kill him."
Natasha did, though. She kept pointing out all the reasons that brining the dog back to the hotel with them was a bad idea. Even when Clint brought up the "we can't just leave him out here" argument, Natasha pointed out that they didn't have to; they could easily drop him off at the nearest emergency vet's office or animal shelter. Clint didn't listen to her, though, and just went ahead with what his gut was telling him to do. Was that true impulsiveness or just stupidity? It was probably a mixture of both.
Anyways, be sure to favorite, follow, review, comment, kudos... Whatever the kids are doing nowadays. I'm old.
She tapped the screen to open the message faster than she had done anything else in her life. She was racking her brain, trying to remember how to take a screenshot with this phone when she finally caught a glimpse of the message's contents.
"Don't listen to him. Just take us back to the hotel." Before Tony could voice his objection, Steve hit the button to put up the privacy shade. Tony tried to hit it again to bring it back down, but Steve stopped him and pushed his hands away.
"I like the sound of that." Loki froze as the throne began to turn around. He instantly recognized the figure sitting in it. Real fear crept through his veins. Of all the people in the universe to run into, this certainly one of the ones you didn't want to.
Since Tony couldn't put in the energy to lie again, he just shrugged and looked down at his lap. Steve raised his hand and left if hovering at his back for a few seconds before asking "is it alright if I touch you?"
Pepper's face paled a bit.
"Well, keep scanning until you detect one," Tony said. I don't know what they did to the tape, but it made it…"
He took a deep breath in and out. He wasn't angry, just confused. A part of him wanted to chase down Lara and ask her to clarify, but he had a feeling that would just make matters worse. She was clearly upset and probably needed a bit to cool off – something he could understand better than anyone. For a brief second, he considered texting Betty to find out what she had texted to Lara, but that kind of felt underhanded and would just make more problems than necessary.
"What are you saying, Agent Romanoff?" she asked.
"Like, if Castro dies," Conroy said. "What do I do then?" Tony rolled his eyes and walked past her up the stairs.
At the top of the stairs, they had to release their hands so they could file through the doors. Once they were inside, Tony removed his sunglasses and took Steve and Romanoff's hands again. He was still having trouble walking and that was an easy way to have them help support him without anyone noticing.
"You're probably right," she said. "What time is it, anyway?"
"Of course not, Brother Daniel," he said. "Everyone knows you're the profit; the only one who can lead us to ascension."
"Yeah, I am." Tony noticed that Steve's eyes were slowly tracing the armor up and down. Tony smirked, and Steve's face turned white the second he realized he'd been caught. Yeah, they needed to finish having that discussion from before. "What about you? Are you alright?"
"Thank God," he said. "I was worried. When I saw that the armor didn't deploy…"
"Clint Barton," he supplied in case she had forgotten as well. He pulled his hand back to try and rub the remaining sleepiness from his eyes. "Sorry. I almost died a week ago so I'm kind of groggy on a few things."
"Did he throw up right after?" Jessica nodded.
"There was nothing for the serum to fix because there was nothing wrong," she said. If homosexuality truly was a disease, he would have been cured of it, but there was no disease to cure. It was just the way he was, and nothing could change that. I also realized the fact that he felt safe telling me that was huge. It meant that he was serious about me; that he wanted to have a life with me, and honestly, I had wanted that too…"
"What do you mean?" Steve narrowed his eyes at the sudden, unspurred question.
"You weren't the only impulsive one," Natasha interrupted. "I just wanted to get the situation under control as soon as possible. I did not realize what I was asking of who and you were put in danger because of that. For that, I'm sorry."
"I wasn't trying to…"
"What does that mean?" he asked. "It's good, right?"
"God damn it, Lara!" she growled out. "Look what you've done now!"
"You think this madness will end with your rule?"
"And you can't get ahold of Fury?" Carol asked.
"True," Tony said. "So why don't we ask the person whose call it is?" Tony turned to Steve, who was still mostly supporting his weight. "Steve, do you want to go with the nice S.H.I.E.L.D. lady…" Steve took notice of how blatantly the redhead rolled her green eyes. "…or do you want to help me sneak out of the hospital, sneak back in, and watch the law of averages slowly kill me?"
Steve's train of thought was interrupted by the sound of mechanical
Carol Danvers died in 1989," Amanda explained. "She was twenty-nine years old. There's no way you could be her. Even if there was a mistake, you are far too young. So, care to explain?"
"Oh, I'm sure Duane here will tell you all about it soon enough," he said. "He's one of our best." Freeman honestly laughed at that.
"So, someone switched it," Steve said.
"Meeting him was mind-boggling," Tony said. "I mean, I couldn't imagine someone coming back from the dead as he did, especially after being missing for so long. I heard stories about him when I was a kid. It was just too surreal."
Tony turned to look back at Steve. His unwillingness to leave and his frustration at being told what to do showed on his face plain as day. Steve felt Tony place his hand on his shoulder.
"No," she carefully declined. "I'm not interested."
"How's that deal now, you filthy animal?" With that, Johnny fired one last round into the cop.
attracted to Tony, there was no chance there was anything more behind this night. None. Just two friends going off to spend a night on the town. Completely innocent and normal.
"Pretty sure he was born like this," Clint said. "He didn't have any blood on him, and I can't feel anything when I touch it…" Clint moved his hand over the stump, but immediately pulled it back when the dog gave a yelp of displeasure. "Yeah, he was born like this. He's just sensitive about it."
"When talking to Miss Everhart," Adoniram said. "Don't be afraid to lay on the
"Yeah," Oswin said. "Me from a jail cell and her somewhere a thousand miles away. Thanks, but I think I'll be just fine handling it on my own.
"It's 4:59," he said. "I usually let Conroy go around five." Natasha nodded and stood up.
, I don't know how much I trust that."
"Who? What? Slow down! What happened?" At this point, everyone had gotten up and were approaching the two. Freeman took a deep breath, collecting himself before proceeding to explain.
"How's that going?"
"Uh, are you sure that's a good idea?" Bruce asked nervously.
"Yes," A dagger went through Steve's heart. Peggy promised never to tell another soul for as long as she lived, and yet here was Tony claiming that Peggy revealed that deeply-held secret to him. Steve's emotions went haywire. He didn't know what to think or say and he wanted nothing more than to hit something. (He still had enough sense not to get himself kicked out of the hospital for random acts of violence against medical equipment, though.) He searched for his words for a good long time before speaking up.
"I know you weren't trying to kill yourself." Rhodey was not sure how much he
"You're not," Natasha said.
"Public restrooms," Tony suggested.
"He'll live," Steve's mom assured. "He just might not be able to hold a pencil for a few days."
"Thank you," Lara said as she got up and ran to the kitchen. "I don't think it's a good idea to stay here."
Remember kids, all is right when you welcome Loki into your life! Loki be with you!
Imagine her surprise when Pepper was sympathetic.
"I've changed it so many times," Tony said. "And you honestly can't expect me to remember a number that long."
"I'm fine," Tony asserted.
"Natasha…"
"Thanks," Stark said. "But I don't think I can handle eating anything right now."
Whether they knew it or not, taking their congregation indoors meant giving up their right to freely gather and express their religious views. If they wanted to hold a public event, they needed a permit from the city and permission from the property owner to gather there. The People's Unity Church had neither. The first time they got thrown out, the Church claimed that they couldn't legally gather. However, they kept coming back, so they couldn't exactly use that as an excuse anymore and in a way, getting thrown out of Avengers Tower worked in their favor.
"Yeah, Tony's going to need to work on your Asimov protocols." Rhodey sighed before pressing his fingers to Tony's pulse point again. He could still feel a heartbeat, albeit one that was a little slower and weaker than it probably should be. "Call poison control. I want a more reliable source of information than the internet."
Tony was going to bend over to pick it up, but a hand on his shoulder stopped him. Looking back to his left, Tony's eyes met Steve's to find a worried look had completely fallen over them.
His idea was a good one, and it might have worked, too, if he only had a knowledge of chemistry beyond what he could vaguely remember learning in high school. As a result, his arms were badly burnt, he was locked away in a federal penitentiary, and he missed the most important years of his young daughters' lives. That was the worst part about all of this. His daughters – who were only five and one years old at the time of his arrest – had to grow up without either one of their parents was just plain unfair. He hadn't done anything wrong. He was just trying to provide a life for his girls, but instead, they were snatched away from him.
"Sorry," she offered softly.
"But instead you got fired," Salinas snapped. "And now you've royally screwed us over!"
Annabeth quickly locked Ricky in her bedroom and went back to lead Agent Duran through the house. When they reached the backyard, Agent Duran immediately made a bee-line for the fence.
"We can't always get what we want." Although Steve was doing his best not to look disappointed, Tony still couldn't help but notice the slightly sad note in his voice. "But I still don't think it's a good idea for you to go back to work so soon."
Afterward, Hill had told them that they were free to go about their business and that she was going down to the lobby to wait for Fury and Tony. Again, Steve didn't want to fall asleep, but he was just too exhausted both physically and emotionally. He needed some form of rest.
"And just like that you've lost out on your chance to get a free Nintendo Wii," Lara said.
At the last second, Steve lifted his head to the sky and what he saw… Well, it was nothing short of a damn miracle. Just as the portal was about to snap shut, the figure of a man clearly came tumbling out of it and once the sunlight caught a gleam on the red-and-gold paint job, there was no denying who it was.
"Okay," Rawls said. "Well, I'm handing this case over to Dr. Holcomb. If anyone can find you a match, it's her."
"Of course, you are," Salinas agreed. "I just don't want you to strain yourself. In fact, lay back. You'll be more comfortable that way.
"Alright, sorry this had to be cut so short." Mrs. Barnes then reached out to give Steve's mother a hug.
"Va te faire foutre." Tony burst out laughing while Lara's eyes widened, and her mouth dropped in shock. She kept that expression on her face as she turned around to look at Steve, who was standing in the archway, grinning like an idiot.
"Games?" Tony questioned. "What, are we nine?"

"What's wrong." Carol's tone made it clear she wasn't going to take sarcasm for an answer. Jessica's face contorted in pain. She knew it was pointless to lie.
"Yup," Carol said, popping the "p." "Then you crawled back into bed and slept for thirty minutes. I'm glad you're up, though. I won't have to carry you bridal-style again."
"What about Pepper?"
"It would be," Steve said. "If I was allowed to leave this floor."
Tony knew where he was when he woke up. He remembered passing out on the beach, so he knew that presumably Steve, Natasha, or one of the cops had called for an ambulance and brought him back to the hospital. That was fine. He probably deserved it anyway for sneaking out and all. Oh well, at least he didn't have to worry about the thieves being at-large anymore. Both had been caught and arrested by the police. That was such a relief off Tony's mind that he had time to focus on other things like why exactly couldn't he turn over?
"I don't need to see a doctor," Tony said.
"So?" Stark said. "Any one of us could have done that."
Taking a deep breath, Duran pulled out her secure satellite phone and went into the ladies' room. She hit speed dial number one on her phone and brought it to her ear. She already knew that he wasn't going to like this, not one bit.
"Yeah," Bruce said. "Well, she's Tony's assistant – that's how I know her – but we're friends. I'd say we're friends." A knowing smile crossed Betty's face.
With Stane gone, Rhodey was the only person left there for Tony. With no other choice but to wait for him to wake up, he sat down and tried to keep his thoughts from becoming too bleak. Thankfully, a suitable distraction came nearly an hour later in the form of Happy finally showing up to the right hospital.
to sneak out of the hospital. You can just check out AMA."
"What?"
"What are we doing?" Tony's eyes narrowed and his posture became tense. He gripped the armrests of the chair for dear life. Lara made eye contact with him and within an instant, she was hurriedly whispering something into Freeman's ear. Everhart, meanwhile, played dumb.
The door to the suite was open, so Steve just walked right in. Tony was surprised to see the other Avengers standing there, waiting for him. He didn't think they would care enough even to look so concerned. Alright, he thought Bruce might be a little worried at least, but he wasn't expecting Barton and Romanoff to care at all. The only one that didn't look concerned was Lara. The expression on her face looked more like one you would give a person who cornered you in an alleyway with an AK-47. He couldn't blame her. Honestly, he felt the same.
"I don't know," he said. "It's different every time."
"No need to apologize." Salinas held up one hand in an assuring manner. "Where are the other Avengers?" Tony gave the Congressman a strange look.
"Tell me," she said. "Or do I have to hold you down and smack you?"
"I'm fine," she insisted.
"So, he took a drunk man back to his house without his consent?" Barton questioned.
"Thankfully, it's not something anyone's attempted," Lara said. "The TV show just happened to be on once, and he just told her and Rhodes, 'if anyone ever did that to me for any reason, I'd never spoken to them again.'"
Tony stepped out of the way fast enough that he narrowly avoided having the countertop come down on his toes. For a second, he had to gasp in shock while he pressed a hand to his chest. He didn't think his heart was beating too abnormally given the circumstance, but he still had to check. Assured that he wasn't having a heart attack, Tony turned his scrutiny to his fingers and toes. All of them were attached and there were no tell-tale signs of bruising or bleeding, so he figured he was good to go on that front.
A minute or two later, the elevator came to a halt, and the doors opened into the penthouse. Tony was prepared to give Barton and Romanoff a tour of the place until the second he stepped off the elevator. Then, his stomach gave a violent lurch, and Tony had to think fast before he tossed his cookies across the marble floor. Thankfully, the trash chute was right next to the elevator, so he didn't have to look far.
"Units aren't valueless," Carol tried to argue.
"Worried sick," Pepper said. "I didn't get the text you sent me until the plane was already in the air! Are you okay? Are you hurt? Are you still sick? What's going on?"
After his nap, Bruce went about his usual business. He worked on his research in his office and pet the puppy whenever he started getting whiney. Eventually, he made himself dinner and took the dog for a walk outside (careful to give the gathered reporters a wide berth.) When he came back, he went to his office to see if he could get some more work done before he went to bed.
"It's a code that's programmed into all electronic locks when they're still on the factory floor," Knežević explained. "It's supposed to reset the electronic components into an unlocked, disarmed state. That way if something goes wrong and the lock seizes up while they're still putting it together, they can reset it and fix the problem. Usually, they program the override code out before letting the locks ship out commercially, but sometimes either through oversight or negligence, a lock ships out with the override code still programmed in. However, that's rare. We really lucked out. Seriously, that only had a two-percent chance of working."
"A shame," Adoniram heard Salinas mutter under his breath. Adoniram glared at him. Now they had a third accomplice to worry about.
"Mm," she said. "I doubt that, especially since I'm not going to know anyone there."
"Because he's a dog," he said. "The rules for naming people are a little bit different, but for dogs you've got to stick to the traditional boy-girl names." Lila frowned in disappointment at her rejection, but at the same time Cooper seemed to recover from his.
Thank you to mfaerie32 for the review on FFN and the two guests that left kudos on AO3! You guys rock!
However, his screwed up emotional state wasn't helped when he looked up and saw Bruce raising an eyebrow at him.
"Don't be," Lara said. "It started out as work-related anyway."
"I'm sorry," he said. "What?"
So, yeah, hopefully, you're not too mad at me for stopping here for right now. The deleted scenes for Better to Be Fake and Happy took up the last post-date spot for July. I'm not going to be posting in August because:
"Fine," she assured. "You startled me a bit."
"And do you really think breaking up would spare us that pain?" Steve asked. "Not just add to it?" Tony didn't even need to think about it to know the answer.
Once inside, Rhodey headed straight for Tony's workshop, expecting to find Tony there working on something, but the place was totally empty save for DUM-E, who immediately ran up to Rhodey in greeting. Rhodey gave the enthusiastic robot a pat on the claw before exiting the workshop and heading upstairs. He did not know where in the house to look for Tony, but luckily for him, Tony had made himself relatively easy to find.
kingdom would be decimated, and it would be all his fault.
"How so?" Bruce asked. Tony frowned. He tried to think of the proper words to explain it but came up empty. He felt everyone's eyes on him, and Steve's hand paused at his shoulder to give it a comforting squeeze.
Much like how it happened for Tarquan before him, Charles found himself on a platform in the middle of the sea. Standing before him, however, was none other than Karl Marx himself. Charles opened his mouth to try to say something, anything to his idol, and as he did Karl Max opened his mouth as well, causing the flood of information to surge through Charles' brain.
Natasha seemed to be catching on to the fact that they were purposefully leaving stuff out as well. She looked to Fury and the S.H.I.E.L.D. Director gave her a look that said "we're doing this for a reason. Keep pushing, and this could blow up in all of our faces." Natasha gave a small nod of understanding before turning back to Carol.
"I'd feel sorry for you, Charlie Brown," he said. "But that's what you get for stirring the pot."
"If I was there…" Tony cut him off.
"This isn't a consultation," Coulson said.
"Yes," he said warily. Steve didn't look convinced. "Alright, some I really don't know the answers to. Others… I want to be honest with you. I really do. I'm just scared…" Tony felt Steve place a hand on his shoulder, so he looked him right in the eyes.
"Really?" His disbelief carried through his tone. "What are you, a master of disguise now? Did you camouflage yourself with the nearest potted plant? Turned yourself invisible?"
"It's a good practice to get into," Steve remarked.
Remember kids, friends will be friends right 'till the end!
"Hello?"
Steve then watched as Tony turned and headed out of the room, smile gleaming on his face.
"I most certainly do Mr. Stark." Steve turned around to face Carol, a confused expression on his face. Glancing over at Natasha, Tony could see that her face held nothing but suspicion.
"What do you mean?" Steve asked.
That day back in September, Adoniram had told his followers that the Chitauri Invasion was the start of the apocalypse, and to be honest, he thought it could be. Although he used the incident to renew his follower's waning belief, he truly feared that this would be the end of all things. At least, on Earth. Thanks to the shard, Adoniram knew that there were other planets and galaxies out there, teeming with life. If the entire population of the Earth had been exterminated, it wouldn't matter. There were still worlds that would continue to turn without them. Earth, Terra, Midgard, C-53… It was just a tiny drop in the bucket; one that could easily be washed away. So honestly, this wasn't the apocalypse. It was just a mass genocide. However, his followers didn't know that. They only knew what he told them. So, he said to them it was the end of days. He tried to impress in their minds that this was the end times, and only their belief in the church – their faith in
"Really… I hadn't… Noticed."
"You said it had to dry," Lila said.
"Bi?" Steve questioned. "What's that?"
"For me it's just years of practice," he said. "You just have a natural talent for it."
"Do you have a camera outside the front door?" Natasha asked.
"$250," Clint offered.
"I know," Lara said. "It's a
"Hi, Lara. I di-" Lara hit the "end call" button faster than she had hit anything in her life. She had no idea why Dante was calling her this early in the morning, all she knew was she didn't want to hear it. Unfortunately, her hang up didn't get the message across. Dante must have immediately re-dialed her number because the unknown number popped up again within seconds. Lara rejected that call and two more before she was able to properly power off her phone. She returned the device to her messenger bag and climbed back into bed.
"So," she said. "There's nothing distracting us from the elephant in the room anymore. Would it make it easier if we just skipped this conversation and I head straight for the unemployment line?" Tony shook his head. "Thought so."
"Well, you
(See the end of the chapter for
"Then what the hell?" he said. "Why are you moving him to the Decibel's Wing and giving him some special new job? He's not responsible and can't be trusted!"
"That you thought that you were unworthy of being in my presence; that you don't deserve all the adoration I give you, and you should have offed yourself years ago." Tony's stomach churned, and his blood ran cold. With wide eyes, he pulled Steve into his arms.
"And tell them I love them extra much." Laura nodded.
"Well, you three better get your asses down here," Tony said. "Because there's plenty of entertainment to go around. Swing up Park, I'm gonna lay 'em out for you."
"Agent Duran," he said. "I wasn't expecting to hear from you again so soon."
"S.H.I.E.L.D. seems to be efficient with that kind of stuff," she said. "Didn't you say they had you giving testimony as to what happened immediately after the incident?" Tony internally cringed at the colloquial dubbing of the Battle of New York. Although it had been months that wound still felt fresh. Regardless, it was still easy enough to hide his real reaction.
Lara's eyes widened and narrowed as she read the message over a few more times. Then she blinked in confusion. It didn't make sense to her. Why would Bruce give a stranger her number? Granted, Betty wasn't a stranger to him – he had spoken of her quite a few times – but Lara hadn't met her before and with what was going on in her life right now, she was sort of wary and skeptical of anyone who was attempting to contact her over text. Sure, Dante had previously only called, but that didn't automatically mean he wouldn't try impersonating someone and contact her over text. In fact, it would make it easier to conceal his identity.
"Yeah," she said. "True, but… I do not know. Something about it just bothers me. I mean, before he was desperate to get into contact with me. Now, he does not even show up at the hearing. That just does not make sense to me. You'd think he'd take the opportunity when it was presented to him, right?"
Remember kids, put your faith in my stomach! (Please tell me I heard that lyric wrong.)
"Ten hours?" The doctor nodded in confirmation. "Holy hell…"
"Where's a puppy?" Lila asked again.
Steve, Clint, and Natasha did their best to fend off the Chitauri invading the streets. Steve was able to give orders to the NYPD to evacuate the media and those who failed to heed the evacuation notices earlier either to the basements of nearby buildings or down into the subway tunnels and to move back their perimeter to 39th Street. Meanwhile, Natasha covered Clint while he evacuated a stranded city bus. They were all able to hold their own for the most part, but all of them would have to admit that they were relieved when a certain God of Thunder showed up and struck down several opponents with one burst of lightning. If anything, it was going to give them the two seconds they needed to regroup and reassess the situation.
All he got in response was light snoring. Tony tried to push them off him, but their arms were locked around his neck. Tony groaned and slumped over on the couch, dragging the other body with him. Slowly, his eyes slid shut. Sleep didn't seem like such a bad idea. Besides, whoever was on top of him was warm… Maybe he could drift off for just a few moments right here on this couch…
"Yeah," Clint remarked as he quickly wiped off some of his arrows and stuck them back in his quiver. "Get in line."
"According to the letter, yes," Betty said.
Tony did not bat an eye. He knew what she was going to do; she was going to deny her part in what happened that fateful night and settle all the blame on his shoulders, just like everyone else. She encouraged him to go all out that night. She watched him drink until he could not talk in a straight line anymore. She saw him get into the armor and did not stop him. Yes, everything he did that night was his decision and he was responsible for his own actions, but she did not stop him from doing any of it. She just passively watched his destructive behavior and enabled every bad decision he made. Undercover S.H.I.E.L.D. operative or not, there was no excuse for that. So, Tony just sat there, patiently waiting to see what lies came gracefully falling from the world-renowned spy's lips.
"What was that?" Bruce asked. "What did they do in there?"
…Or it would just keep him up longer. At least, that's what he realized when he heard knocking at the hotel room door and looked up at the clock on the stove to find it was just a little past five AM. He let out a curse and saved what he was working on before getting up and heading for the door. Through the peephole, he could see that Lara was standing on the other side, honestly looking tired and bored. What the hell, he might as well entertain her.
"Yeah," Margot said. "Like when we first got married. Remember that? You looked so handsome that day. I felt like I was the luckiest girl on Earth."
"We're leaving." Tony frowned at the declaration.
"We could fly commercial," Bruce pointed out. "Tell the flight attendants not to serve him."
"What happened." Tony sighed.
"You would have actually done it." Again, Natasha remained unphased.
"Yes," Steve answered quickly. "There are a bunch of plugs with red lights around their bases."
"Well, so much for the nice guy act," Barton commented. Someone sighed in agreement.
"So," Knežević said. "Let's go over this plan one more time. You're going to walk in there and gain access to one of their chemical engineering labs and you're going to have me identify the chemicals over the phone?"
"Glad to see you're taking this well," Pepper said.
"What about Clint?" Hill bit her lip and in three seconds flat she had gone from all-business to sympathetic.
"She thinks I might be… That you'd…" Steve shook his head and looked down, clasping his wrist in the opposite hand. He couldn't do it. He couldn't say it.
"It's a dead end," he said. "The letter's addressed from the fourth-grade class of the Greenpark School in Newark, New Jersey. There's no school by that name in Newark or anywhere else in New Jersey."
of them." Lara scoffed, but Cabe remained unphased. Meanwhile, Happy nodded.
"Well, you shouldn't have called my boyfriend a lazy-ass." Lara's expression soured, but Steve remained non-pulsed as he walked over to Tony and bent over to give him a kiss. "Good morning, honey." Tony smiled.
When the plane finally came to a stop and they could get off, Steve stood up, but Tony didn't move. He wondered if Tony fell back to sleep and tried gently shaking his shoulder. When that didn't work he called his name.
"So, the plane's really falling seventy or eighty feet?" Tony asked.
"What?" she questioned, raising her eyebrow. "But it's Thursday."
Steve did as he was told and pulled all the switches on each side towards the center. He watched as the lights on the plugs went out, then flickered back on, now glowing green. Once he could see that there were no problems with any of the plugs, he slid the panel back into the wall.
. She didn't know how long this had been Knežević's situation for, but she certainly didn't want to find out, and she didn't want to make this her permanent living situation, too. She wished she could go back to her nice house/squatter's den with her nice bed that fell off a mattress truck and all her stolen jewelry. However, that was impossible now that this idiot had blown it all up.
"I told you," Tony said. "I wanted to sleep. Alcohol wasn't working, so I thought I'd try something else." Rhodey frowned, still not entirely convinced by that explanation. Tony was still leaving something out. He could feel it.
It was about ten to fifteen minutes later when she finally got to the living room. Stepping into the room, she knew immediately that she wasn't alone. Someone was sitting slumped over on the couch. Figuring it was Salinas and want to check his progress, she approached him.
"It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner," Tony said, and it was. He had heard about the other scientist a lot throughout the years – both before and after his little Gamma Radiation accident. He was and still is a brilliant man and Tony was all too happy to help get General Ross off his tail and prevent the Abomination from getting placed on the Avengers after the Harlem incident the previous year. Getting to meet the man was somewhat of an honor, but Tony being Tony, he still had to give Bruce at least a little bit of a hard time. "Your work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled, and I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage-monster." Bruce's face fell a little bit when he got to the second part.
"I could hear you over the comms, honey," Tony said. "You were, in fact, gaping, but then again who wouldn't? None of us has seen anything like that before. Well, other than Thor, since apparently giant birds are common wherever he's from."
"You question us?" Loki could physically feel his adrenaline spike at the Other's snapping tone. He managed to keep a calm outward demeanor. It was easy to do that when the other person could only see a psychically-generated image of yourself. "You question him?" The other gestured upwards to the asteroid upon which Thanos' throne sat. The implied threat wasn't lost on Loki.
, he dreamed of one day exploring the stars and venturing into the unknown, but it wasn't at all like the media presented it; all vibrant and teaming with life and the promises of adventure and discovery. It was just dark and terrifying, the most terrifying part is what lay above him – a huge ship with entire legions of sky-whales and Chitauri poised for attack, waiting to attack the Earth, to kill them all.
"Yes," Tony reluctantly agreed. He hated no win situations like that. "Okay, I'll leave this whole thing alone, but I'm not going to be happy about it."
Almost as soon as Tony stepped out into the hallway, his phone started ringing. He answered it as quickly as possible and was relieved to find that it was just Rhodey. That was, until Rhodey explained that he was already in route to the Tower when he got a news alert that it had been struck by a missile. That made Tony's relief wain a bit.
While withdrawing from alcohol, there was a risk that the sufferer could fall into a seizure. Tony himself had nearly gone into cardiac arrest when Bruce mentioned that, and with the way Steve had paled, he could imagine that he wasn't far behind him. Bruce was quick to amend that seizures only occurred in about fifteen percent of patients, but Lara questioned the sample size and pointed out that fifteen percent could still be a disconcerting number of people. All that did was make Tony wonder if he had the legal authority to send her to a nursing school so she could learn a proper bedside manner.
"Before you two start sucking face," he said. "Maybe we should move along with this meeting?" Steve gave him an inquisitive look.
Tarquan followed the creature through the marketplace and into a rather ruddy-looking building. Form there, he was led up a flight of stairs and into a room that looked to serve as a storage space, office, and one-room apartment all in one. In the center of the room sat a man with violet skin and a frog-like face. The robed creature said something to the man in a language Tarquan didn't understand before stepping out of the room. The frog-man then turned his attention to him. Tarquan had never felt so intimidated in his entire life.
"Can't argue with that," she said.
The Avengers originally came to Washington D.C. to attend the President's State of the Union Address. However, they've hit some bumps along the way and aren't in the best state right now. However, some people appear to be oblivious to that...
The movie continued without incident. Shortly after eating, Clint nodded off and he was soon followed by Steve, Tony, and Natasha. Lara managed to stay awake with Bruce until the end of the movie. Once the credits started rolling, Lara stood up and stretched.
The journey to Tony's room wasn't unlike the last time Steve had to carry a half-dazed Tony; Steve was doing most of the work carrying Tony's weight while Tony was completely unhelpful by walking with his eyes closed. Still, it wasn't hard for Steve to find the room, seeing as he, Natasha, Thor, and Bruce were all placed in the same hallway. The others all had their doors shut, likely taking some well-earned naps after being up all day and night fighting. Tony's door, however, was slightly ajar and walking in Steve could see that someone had recently been in there, as Tony's clothes had been left on the bed; freshly laundered and sealed in one of those bags you were supposed to vacuum the air out of that he had seen advertised on Television. Steve moved them out of the way before helping Tony lay down. Steve had expected him to fall asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow, but Tony surprised him by immediately scooching over to make room on the full-sized mattress and patting the newly-vacated space beside him.
"She still did the job, though," Pepper pointed out.
It wasn't like the thought hadn't occurred to him before; of course, it had. However, the previous times he had "tried" (been forced into) it, he ended up going straight home and drinking until the floor became the ceiling. Then again, it might be different this time. At the very least, the Tower was now essentially a dry building. It'd be far harder for him to drink his pain away. He could at least look into it. There wouldn't be any harm in that, right?"
," a blonde who had clearly had way too many plastic surgeries said. "I'm Rhoda Beret."
"Quiet, Captain," Natasha said, her eyes firmly on Subarian. "The Black Widow is working." Steve was going to say something to counter that, but Subarian beat him with his pleading.
"No," Natasha said. "But I can probably still get us in, though."
"You've had non-diabetic ice cream before?" he asked in response to her earlier statement. "Wouldn't that make you sick?" Lara shook her head.
"True," Duran said. "But this girl got around
The next four decades Adoniram spent trying to get as many people to join his church as he possibly could. The first thing he did to try to further that goal was to relocate to New York City. Since it was one of the largest cities in the world, he had the potential to reach the widest audience. He held different religious events, such as faith healings and conventions that boasted acceptance of all denominations of Christianity, but pushed people to try and join his movement, the Peoples Unity Church of the Supreme Understanding. Many of his churches were set up in low-income areas and neighborhoods with high minority populations. He piggybacked on the civil rights movement, promising equality for all and even asked all attendees to come dressed in their everyday attire, so that way poorer members wouldn't feel alienated or lesser.
"Then what are you…" Then it clicked in Pepper's head. "You're worried about the video leaking."
"When someone has a drug or alcohol addiction, sometimes the friends and loved ones of the addicted person will gather to confront them and urge them to change their behavior," he explained. "When this happens, it's called an intervention."
"Yeah," Bruce said.
Rhodey updated Happy on everything that happened since he arrived at the hospital, while Happy reported on how the media was reacting to the tapes. It was not well. The one silver lining was that due to FCC regulations, the tapes could not be played on any of the major news networks. However, that was not enough to stop them from
"That explains why you wouldn't stop texting me, trying to find out the Avengers' conditions." The look of sudden realization was quickly replaced on Freeman's face with a look of sour confusion. "Wait, what do you mean 'retaliation?' What did the Avengers even do in the first place?"
"I can't find Tony," he admitted as his nerves started to vibrate.
to do that! I asked
The sound of the sound barrier being broken reverberated through the atmosphere. Jessica raised an eyebrow, impressed. Carol must have been closer than she thought. Within seconds, a bright flash of orange-blue light hit the ground, causing the pavement around it to crack up. Quickly, the light faded, and Carol lowered her helmet, letting her blonde hair fall loose.
The next two interviews went much better, to say the least. The one after Everhart was a CNN round table discussion with the entire team and a Time Magazine interview where they were split into groups. Tony, Steve, and Bruce in the first group, Barton and Romanoff in the second. While Time was a respectable publication, Tony couldn't help but wonder if they had split them up that way on purpose. They did have the grace not to outright ask if Barton and Romanoff were dating, which is more than he could say about most of the media outlets they interacted with throughout the day.
"That can't be right," he said.
"Good," Lila said.
"The consensus of several internet sources is that it is a sedative." Rhodey held back the urge to groan.
I was in the middle of writing another chapter when I remembered I'm supposed to post this chapter today. Oops.
One ring…
"The girls weren't home at the time!" Desperation was starting to sink in. "Besides, the explosions were contained to the basement. I made sure of it." He then rolled up his sleeves to reveal several severe-looking burns on his hands and arms. The social worker just kept the same cold expression on her face.
"It's just JARVIS; an AI," Tony quickly corrected before moving on to the more pressing issue. "Did Pepper say anything else before you left?"
Returning to the observation room, Tony took a moment to re-evaluate the situation. Now that he knew that several hours had passed, he took notice of things he hadn't before like that Fury had left. Hill and Coulson were still there, though, and it seemed as if the chaos of the situation had become a little more controlled. If Tony had to guess, it was because they knew exactly what they were doing now.
Peggy appeared puzzled.
"I'm sorry." Tony shook his head.
"The tooth fairy thought so, too," Laura said. "And what do you say to her?" Cooper clasped his hands together like he was praying and looked up at the ceiling.
Remember kids, search "onision chris hansen" on YouTube. Seriously, this guy's behavior is out of control and I honestly believe more people should be aware of him and his spouse, Cool Guy Kai. I don't want any more children to fall victim to their manipulation and the only way to ensure that is to make more adults aware of what they're doing. Look out for all the children in your life, please.
"No sir," the crew member said. "It'll go live once you step onstage."
"Cameras going offline?" Tony questioned.
"Right," Bruce said. "I'll let you go."
As she stood out there, it occurred to her that Knežević hadn't emerged from the building. He had been staying in her basement since they pulled off the heist at Stark Industries. It was the least she could do given that he didn't have anywhere else to go. It worried her that he was still inside. If the house really was on fire, then that meant he was in danger. Seeing as she couldn't call the police or fire rescue, Oswin briefly considered going back in herself to save him. However, that course of action was proven unnecessary as Knežević finally appeared at the front door, screaming at the top of his lungs with his shirt on fire.
"So, how are we supposed to get up there?" As soon as Steve turned to face Thor and Tony, he got his answer. The Norse God and the man with jet repulsors in his shoes had already made it to the top of the cliff and didn't even offer to give him a lift, of course. Steve sighed and looked the cliff up and down.
"Okay, maybe I wasn't that precise." Tony could feel the heat coming off the glare Pepper was sending him all the way from the west coast. "I'm sorry. I should have explained better."
"You feel okay right this minute, though?" Lara asked. Tony closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
"You mean other than the obvious?" he asked rhetorically. "I'm just tired and I want this day to be over." More honestly, he wanted the rest of the week to be over, but he did not feel like killing himself by traveling at over 1,440 miles per second just to achieve that end. He rather liked having his bones and flesh in a solid form, thank you very much. "That doesn't matter, though. I wasn't the one who got hurt today."
"Well, first off, he unexpectedly announced that he was resigning from his position as head of public relations," she explained. "That didn't stop Pepper from firing his ass, though."
"So, he's an orphan?" Cooper asked. "Like you and Mom?"
Remember kids, your cat is adorable. He deserves scratches.
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed this chapter. I still haven't made any progress on writing anything new and for that, I must apologize. Inspiration is a little hard to come by right now. Hopefully, future episodes of WandaVision will help to spur some on!
"I'd like to argue with you," he said. "But I can't say that's something I don't do either."
"Because it wouldn't be life if it was." Lara glared at Steve for that remark, but Steve was not bothered. Tony brought a hand to his forehead as he thought out a strategy.
"Then it means it means in some strange way you feel sorry for Michael Jackson." Tony scooped up another glob of yogurt from the cup and shoved the spoon into his mouth. "No big deal."
Surprisingly enough, the first thing that Steve Rogers did when he got up in the morning nowadays was checking to see if he had gotten any text messages from Tony Stark. Tony had given him the cell phone (mostly due to the fact he was worried S.H.I.E.L.D. was monitoring their calls) and had gotten in the habit of texting him in the middle of the night for latterly no discernable reason. Very few of the text messages made any real sense, so Steve had to figure Tony had either gotten drunk and written them or had worked himself beyond exhaustion and written them. Lately, Steve would figure the latter given that Tony's been hard at work finishing the construction of Stark Tower.
"Okay," Stark said. "What's so private that we can't discuss it in front of our boyfriends?" Natasha rolled her eyes and covered her face with the palm of her hand. Clint could hear Cap give a warning "Tony" before he dropped out of the conversation entirely. Rather than be a part of the argument, he turned his attention back to the mail pile.
When he got down the stairs, Steve found Clint and Natasha at the front desk arguing with the concierge. He didn't need to get too close to know that the exchange was very heated.
"That's true," Everhart said. "But you have to have had a certain image of him before you met, right?"
"I'll give you five minutes," she said. "After that, you are going back to the hospital and Captain Rogers is returning to S.H.I.E.L.D. Is that clear?"
"You didn't say anything that would cause him distress, though, right?" Fury asked.
"Yes," Tony said. "Yes, it is. I have a lawyer working on that though, so don't worry about it."
Obviously enough a living human being had never been thawed before. First, there was the fact that humans are made mostly of water and when water freezes, it expands, leading the rupturing of all the major bodily tissue cells, resulting in death. Secondly, even if you somehow managed to solve that little problem in the freezing process, there was the little issue of it being scientifically unethical to freeze a person and bring them back to life. Even if the person was okay with the possibility of dying or something going wrong in the thawing process causing them to be permanently injured for life it'd still be unethical and possibly illegal.

Everything else aside, Tony wasn't surprised to see Steve there. This was clearly an all-hands-on-deck situation for S.H.I.E.L.D. and of course, they would call in their golden boy Super Soldier to save the day. He just wished it hadn't gotten in the way of their date. No matter. From what he could tell Steve was still in one piece and they could talk later once they got this mess straightened out. (Granted, it wasn't going to be the romantic scenario that Tony had played out in his head with dim lights, mood music, and well-stocked bedroom with a king-sized bed and soundproof walls just in case of the nearly impossible result of Steve not only returning his feelings, but wanting to do something about them right then and there came to pass, but Tony could take what he could get.) Tony was glad he had the helmet on. If anyone could see how much he was smiling at that moment, well, Tony wouldn't have minded because
"Captain Rogers," she said as she stepped in front of them. "Mr. Stark, I'm surprised that you're still here." Tony frowned.
"Is it safe to eat?" Tony wasn't sure how to answer that.
"The things we said in the heat of the moment we can work out later," Steve said. "For right now, just focus on calming yourself down. We're not going to be able to do anything if you don't pull it together."
He had just about caught up to Knežević when the man turned his head and shot his arm out behind him. He was trying to reach for the Arc Reactor's housing, but Tony realized this and threw his arm in the way before Knežević could touch it. It worked, but unfortunately, it caused another piece of the armor's outer plating to turn to stone. Tony growled in frustration and sent a punch straight to Knežević's gut. He fell backward onto his back, clenching his stomach. After taking two repulsor blasts to the torso, Tony could imagine he was in quite a bit of pain right now.
"Do you still doubt that the man in the next room is Captain Steve Rogers?" Tony remained silent. "Because that was the deal; you could talk to Rogers and ask any question you wanted until you were convinced that he was the real deal. So, are you convinced that this man is Steve Rogers?"
"I thought you never protected the President," Pepper said.
"It's enough for me to give S.H.I.E.L.D. so they can go find him," Natasha said. "We need to get back to New York. We wasted enough time already." Steve took a step back from the redheaded agent, narrowing his eyes.
"You wouldn't have gotten here in time." Carol gave him a look.
"Really?" Knežević said. "Because you're not acting like it. What do you expect? That you're going to just waltz in there, take whatever you want, and then walk out the front door?"
"Which of course it is," Freeman added from where he was sitting behind them. "The press has been going crazy trying to get interviews and statements from you guys for months. I'm surprised they never tried to break down the doors to Stark Tower with the way they've been constantly calling the PR offices."
"Agent Romanoff," Fury said. "Would you mind escorting Dr. Banner back to his…"
"I don't know," Tony said. "Any of them. Hell, I'll even sleep on a deserted beach on Long Island. That was more of a home to me than any of Howard's houses."
As a last-ditch effort, S.H.I.E.L.D. was trying to locate anyone who had any involvement in Project: Rebirth or the SSR back in the day who was still alive, of sound enough mind, and possibly had information that could help them. It was going about as well as anyone would expect.
"Get in the shower," he said. "I'll make you something." Tony frowned.
"Oh!" Dr. Cranston said as realization clicked together. "You mean a chaise lounge?"
"Weird?"
"Not so much," Coulson agreed. "When he's not that thing, though, the guy's like a Stephen Hawking." Steve gave Coulson a slightly confused look. "He's like a smart person."

do to make this easier for you?" Steve gave Tony's question a moment of genuine contemplation. The corners of his lips began to rise.
"Shit," was Rhodey's initial reaction. "Are you okay, though?" Tony swallowed hard.
Steve shook his head to get rid of the dirty images that thought stirred up and instead focused on waking Tony up.
"You were pregnant?" Lara nodded.
As stated before, Barton was intubated and couldn't communicate. Well, technically he could through ASL, but Tony didn't know ASL and even if he did, he couldn't see Barton thanks to the dark gray vinyl divider that separated them. Tony could pull the sheet back if he wanted to, but then he'd run the risk of being exposed. Normally, he wouldn't care about the risk and run in there to tell Barton right away, but ultimately Tony wasn't sure if that was what Barton wanted. He had said himself that if he was dying, he wouldn't want to know. On the one hand, Tony wanted to respect Barton's wishes. On the other hand, this just plain felt wrong and he wanted to do something about it.
"Then what was the point in asking me to meet you here?" she asked. "Where are you going, anyway."
Gently, he ran his fingers through Steve's hair. He heard him give what sounded like a little – and completely adorable – squeak of pleasure in his sleep, but otherwise, Steve still didn't stir. Tony's smile grew wider as he entangled his fingers in Steve's hair further.
Finally, there was the Peoples Unity Church. They, as usual, had parked themselves in the middle of the lobby and were refusing to leave. The police, SI security, and S.H.I.E.L.D. had taken notice of this activity right away and had surrounded the group. However, instead of chanting sermons and accosting passersby, the members of the church were rather calm. They sat facing outwards in a circle that was about forty people in circumference. They all had their arms linked and anytime an authority figure asked them to move, they'd just say "no," not bothering to follow it up with anything else. Since they weren't actively attacking anyone, officers and agents for all the agencies were hesitant to try to physically engage with them. After all, they were having trouble controlling the gathered crowd while monitoring the Peoples Unity Church. They didn't need to add a violent confrontation on to that mess.
It did not end there, though. Again, it felt like they had jumped from the side of the road where they parked the car to the elevator in no time flat. Tony found himself giving Steve's hand a tight squeeze. Steve reciprocated, albeit more gently. Tony tried to feel reassured by that, but honestly anxiety was winning out.
Flash!
"Too bad," Lara said. "We're going." They made it through the first set of double doors before Tony was able to break Lara's grip again.
Hopping down from the table top, Lara grabbed her purse and the handful of belts she had grabbed from Tony's room. It was a long way down and there was no telling whether she'd be able to make it all the way down without any issues. If she got cornered by these guys, she wanted to have an easy way to deny them access to her location and find an alternate escape route. Though, she doubted there'd be many of those, especially on the higher levels.
"How much more of it?" Tony smirked.
Finally, we find out what happened to Tony! Just promise not to be too mad at me.
"I know," Adoniram said. "That's why I'm moving him; to keep an eye on him."
"I'm afraid I can't do that, Sir." Tony furrowed his brow.
and she'll tell someone…"
"So…" Knežević slammed his glass down a little harder than he intended and laughed. "So, you gonna tell me how you did that?"
"Did you already forget that I only let you walk on your own as long as you promised to take it easy?" Clint did not even flinch.
"Really?" Steve said. "They're that good."
"Absolutely," Betty said. "I know Leonard won't mind and my father is not going to be there. Also, we're having an outdoor wedding at a place that's a little off the beaten path, so there's not going to be much in the way of property damage either." For once, Bruce ignored the part of his brain that urged him to stay away from people and smiled.
A short while later, everyone had gathered in one of the hotel's conference rooms to go over PR strategy. Once everyone got to their seats, it didn't take long for Freeman to get started.
Steve had to admit, Natasha was the last person he had been expecting to come knocking at his door first thing Monday morning. By first thing, he really meant
"I'm not saying it." Peggy nodded in understanding.
"Like, perhaps, a thick steel door with the word 'danger' written on it in capital letters and hazardous material symbols all over it?" She pointed the camera at the door to show Knežević what she was talking about.
"Sounds good to me," Tony said. Steve nodded in agreement.
Tony watched it all from his position on a couch in the back of the room. He was tired and starting to feel like he might throw up from the pain of the headache again. He would leave, but he needed to make certain for himself that the information was being used in the way S.H.I.E.L.D. said it would be. Plus, Fury did promise him that he could talk to Rogers if he woke up, so he had more reason to stay and wait for S.H.I.E.L.D. to do whatever they were going to do. So, he just sat back on the couch and not only tried to ignore the pain, but also was forcing himself to remain awake and alert just in case.
"Yes," she said. "I had a part in what happened that night. I cannot deny that. Did I do everything I could have to keep the situation from getting as out of control as it did? No, and to be fair, I did not really want to. I take responsibility for that. However, it was not my intention to sabotage anyone that night, let alone the company."

"What no toy?" The agent wasn't amused.
"Everyone's in danger when they're near me," he said. "That's just a fact."
There was a moment of dead silence.
"Someone broke into Tony's house." The cop shot an irritated look at Lara. "Oops," she said despite her smirk. Pepper's eyes went wide, and she looked back and forth between the cop and the blonde woman.
"I am the rightful ruler of Asgard," Loki said. "Cast aside by both my kingdom and my supposed family."
"Are you worried about the cost?" she asked. "Because if you are, stop it right now. That's for me to worry about later. Right now, we need to get you to the hospital."
"Yes, really," she said.
"Hello?"
"I… Don't think I have insurance?" He wasn't entirely sure on that. Supposedly the Army was going to take care of all his medical expenses for the rest of his life, but that might not still stand. After all, he was still technically considered legally dead.
"Well, that's strong," she remarked. "Like really sour but kind of watered-down wine." Stark nodded in agreement while he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, the action obscuring his own soured expression.
"No comment," she said. Lara frowned rather dramatically.
"Why?" Tony asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Don't try to resist," she said. "You'll only make it harder on yourself."
"You need to get a new personal assistant," she said. "It's getting ridiculous." Tony quickly thanked the makeup artist as she finished with her work before jumping right back into his conversation with Pepper.
"'Nothing's wrong?' What is that for an explanation? Why weren't you on the plane? Where are you? Are you okay?"
venom, but his blood-alcohol level is ridiculously high. One point oh-two six percent. I've never seen anything like it, not even when I was a resident.
"Are they still talking about that interview?" Tony had to ask.
"Of course, I know about Iron Man," Knežević said. "We might not have had computers in prison, but we certainly had access to a TV. I wouldn't worry about him, though." Knežević gestured over to the TV and Oswin turned her head to see Tony Stark being interviewed by some overly bubbly blonde. The banner beneath them both read
"Shut it down, Dr. Selvig," Tony ordered. The wind blew the scientist's hair wildly as he turned around.
"A distraction, and an eyeball."
"Oh," she said. "Yeah, of course. Just wait one second." She gestured to the small sitting area before turning to go back to her computer. "Sit down. Make yourself comfortable."
Starting Saturday morning, Tony isolated himself a bit. It wasn't like he was entirely shutting the world out – he would respond if Steve tried to talk to him and was just as talkative as usual – but he spent most of his time either working on the MK13 armor in its assembly station or in his office continually opening a file on his computer and closing it again. Only in the past hour had he really seemed depressed. Well, outside of his lack of a desire to eat. It took a bit of convincing, but Steve got Tony to sit down and have dinner with him.
"There you are," she said. "Took you long enough."
Flash!
"I need a minute here!" he shouted into the coms. He was so close, just a few more feet…
"Medical emergency on floor P1," she said calmly into the handset. "A letter was opened containing a fine white powder. Possible exposed include Agents Barton and Romanoff, Captain Rogers, and Tony Stark."
"Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny." He was quick to add a "no offense, Doc," once he realized that Bruce was still in the room.
"I'm sure," Tony said. "I have Steve. I'm not in any immediate danger or anything."
"She might not," she said. "But I do. Leave the premises now or the cops are being called." Dante held up his hands placatingly.
"That's not necessarily true," Freeman said.
"Like what?" Barton asked Lara.
He still had not talked to Pepper. It was not like he had not had a chance to. They had seen each other since their argument, but they only discussed company-related matters and the lawsuit did not come up at all. It created an uncomfortable strain between them, but he would rather deal with that than get into an argument about it again. Overall, he just wanted it to go away, but he knew Pepper would not let that happen. She wanted everyone to be held responsible and for that, Tony could not blame her. If there was a way to try the hotel and the police without the video footage, he would, but that just was not possible, so hence the impasse.
"Are you sure?" Lucy asked. "It's free."
"Both the first floor and the second floor are secure," Natasha reported. "They're both completely trashed, so there's no realistic way of ensuring everything's accounted for, but on the bright side there are no unaccounted-for individuals inside the building."
"Hey, JARVIS," she said. "Is there a hair dryer anywhere around here?"
Again, the agents demanded him to open the elevator and again Wallace must have refused to do so as another one of the agents delivered a swift, hard kick to his ribs, causing Wallace to fall over and roll onto his back. At that point, the agent that attacked Lara pulled a Sig Saur out of the holster at his side, cocked it, and pointed it directly at Wallace's head. Once again, a demand was made to open the elevator. Once again, Wallace refused. With a bright flash from the gun's muzzle and a small explosion of blood from the top of Wallace's head, his life was ended. It took everything Lara had in her not to scream directly into the phone. Instead, she just fell back on what she learned in training for these kinds of situations with the Secret Service; remain calm and focus on the objective.
"I think you need to see a doctor," Pepper said.
"I'm sure if he still made weapons," he said. "Stark would be neck-deep…"
"Yeah," Tony said. "Thank you."
After what seemed like forever, Pepper finally hung up the phone. She took a few deep, calming breaths before she turned to Lara.
Other than that, everything was boring and uneventful. He walked around the building a few times and he drew a few rough sketches using a pencil he found on the ground and paper that was just randomly in the middle of some empty office space. (He made a mental note to ask what that was later.) He didn't draw anything, just some random shapes, and objects as a warm-up exercise. It wasn't much, but it passed the time.
Now, all she could do was hold Nina and cry. She wanted to pretend that she had no idea how something like this could have happened, but she'd just be fooling herself. This happened because she was selfish and took things that weren't hers. The time had come for her to pay the price. She just wished that price hadn't included Nina.
Right then the real Loki struck. He came up behind Coulson, stabbing him in the back. The blade of his scepter penetrated him so deeply that it came out through the other side of his chest, covered in blood.
"'I'm going to miss the flight,'" Pepper quoted. "'Leave without me. Nothing's wrong. See you Monday.'"
For a moment, Carol allowed herself to hope that this person was the doctor, but they were dashed when she saw that the woman was wearing a blazer and a matching pencil skirt instead of the expected lab coat and scrubs. Carol frowned as she continued her appraisal. The woman looked the same age Carol was supposed to and had graying hair tied up in a tight bun. She put on a reassuring façade, but the coldness of her eyes cut right through it. Already, Carol didn't like her.
"Mr. Jarvis," she clarified. "He became concerned when you wouldn't open the door for him or your mother."
"Why?" It came out as an overly dramatic whine. Tony stifled the urge to chuckle.
Tony always had a thing for flashy entrances. When he walked into a party, everyone had to know he was there and remember him. Not only did it fit in with his lavish playboy façade, but it was also just plain fun. So, as soon as JARVIS notified him that a S.H.I.E.L.D. Quinjet had just arrived in the area, he naturally hacked into their coms system and started to play a little AC/DC. Before the song started playing, he clearly heard the voice of Natasha Romanoff on the coms line. That just made this more perfect.
Remember kids, my name is Melinda, I'm twenty-two years old, and I have a baby shower to go to tomorrow!
"Yeah," he agreed. "Stay out here, though. Just in case." Lara nodded. Steve slowly pushed the door open. He was met with darkness and started feeling around the sides of the door for the light switch. "Tony?"
"Conroy." She turned around. "Don't come in tomorrow."
This wasn't the worst headache Tony had ever experienced in his life – the award for that easily went to the one he had in the days/weeks leading up to his aplastic anemia diagnosis – but it sure was an annoying one. In fact, he wasn't entirely sure it could be completely classified as a "headache." It was just a sort of throbbing, pulse-like sensation in his right temple. He tried pressing a couple of fingers against it, hoping that might ease it into stopping. It didn't. He just ended up feeling the pressure against his fingers as well as in his temple. When he realized that, he slowly pulled his fingers away from his head and frowned. It was clear nothing was going to change. At least, not until he was able to get away from this meeting.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You located the Tesseract?" Thor asked.
hurt Clint."
"Why?" Stark asked. "If it's not serious why can't we talk about it now?"
"Oh." Disappointment was clear in Stark's voice. "Well, if you don't mind, do you think I could have a look at them sometime." Old dread started to stir up in Clint's stomach.
My Dad's coming to pick me up at nine and it's 8:48 right now so I have to make this quick. Thank you for reading this story and chapter! Please favorite and follow if you like and don't be afraid to leave a review!
"Holy shit, I was not expecting that today." Putting her hand on her heart, Lara could feel that it was beating faster than the speed of light.
She took a deep breath of oxygen and could already feel the edge taken off her alertness. They must have turned the Anastasia on. However, she could hear what the doctor said next clearly.
Thank you to Queen E for leaving kudos on AO3! It really means a lot! :)
"Pepper caught a shard of glass to the cheek," he explained. "A few others got minor injuries like that, but nothing serious."
"Nothing much, buttercup," he said. "Are the kids in bed?"
"What about when it becomes too much?" he asked.
"Shut up," she murmured, but the slight amount of amusement in her voice made it clear she did not mean it seriously. Bruce laughed.
Okay, I'm feeling better now, so hopefully, I can type an author's note that actually makes sense!
"I can," he said without any hesitation. Steve looked over at Natasha, who gave a nod of assurance.
"It's okay," Tony assured.
"Never been," she said. "But I've encountered some of the people. They're good people as far as I can tell. Why?"
Special thanks to mfaerie32 on FFN for the review! It really means a lot! :)
"Better enough to be up for a movie?" Clint raised an eyebrow.
"I mean to a counselor," Natasha said. "Or a psychologist." Steve shook his head.
"We can't know that for sure," Smith said. "Open your mouth, say 'ah!'"
"No."
Her first step was to remove Stark's wet clothing. It was standard procedure when dealing with someone who had been exposed to the elements in mid-winter. However, Stark had somehow managed to soak all his clothes, meaning she would have to strip him down to his underwear. Carol had no problem with this if Stark remained asleep throughout the process. After all, he was drunk and vulnerable. She could only imagine what conclusion he would jump to.
"Still, I have it handled. Go call Fury." Jessica nodded and stepped out of the room. Carol, meanwhile, decided to get to work at making Stark more comfortable.
"I don't know," Steve said. "I never had a hamster."
"Let's hope so," Stark said.
"Take him to the hospital," Carol flatly stated.
you disrespect our beliefs!" the shorter man shouted. "When the Kree bring their war upon this world…"
However, before that happens I should also let you know that I'm going to be taking another hiatus. It's not going to be as big as last time! Let me assure you of that! I'm just not going to be posting in November or December because even with the pandemic going on, I still have a lot going on other priorities around that time that take precedence, and I know I won't be able to write fast enough to keep up with posting. As of right now, I'm writing chapter forty-nine and I almost have all of January covered, so things are looking up. The last chapter that's going to be released before I go on hiatus again will be chapter forty-four on October 28th. So don't worry, we still have plenty more stories to go before we have to go on pause! Look forward to that!
Yeah, I am not feeling good right now, so if you have any questions about this chapter, just leave it in a comment or review and I'll reply when my brain isn't running at a speed of 0.001 miles per hour. I'm going to go back to bed now.
It felt like forever before S.H.I.E.L.D. let Bruce and Betty go. Well, technically they didn't let them "go." Both would be spending the night in the Hub. Bruce because it still wasn't safe to return to Avengers Tower and Betty simply because she didn't want to fly back to Virginia in the middle of the night. So, S.H.I.E.L.D. had to put them up for the night.
Rhodey and Happy stayed for as long as they could before they got kicked out. At around nine o'clock, a petite yet intimidating nurse named Clara informed them that visiting hours were over and unless they wanted to check themselves into the emergency room, they were going to have to leave. Both men knew better than to try arguing with her, the two men did as she ordered.
The Avengers are in D.C. to meet the press. What could possibly go wrong?
right, now."
The closed captions stated that there were reports that the building was being squatted in or being used as an improvised homeless center. That seemed to ring true as the most recent images seemed to depict boards partially or totally ripped off windows. Most of the windows were darkened, despite the removal of the boards, though, except for one. That one held within it a sign declaring the building
Tony could see what she was doing. He might be inebriated, but he wasn't blind. However, he couldn't feasibly see a way to justifiably deny her request. Frowning, he had no choice but to do exactly what she wanted.
"Are you going to try to pick it?" Steve asked.
"This is going to sound really personal, but I'm only asking this for both yours and Tony's safety. Whatever happened between you two is between you two. I'm not asking for details, I just need to ask this to ensure you're both okay. Do you understand?" Steve tightened his lips, but once again nodded. He didn't like where this was going, but his only option was to sit there and let Pepper ask the question. "Did you two do anything last night?"
Twenty minutes later, Carol was touching down on the front stoop of the safe house. She could see Jessica halfway down the road, sprinting towards them. Glad she was able to keep up, Carol turned her attention to the problem of the door. She knew where the spare key was hidden and knew she should probably wait for Jess to catch up so she could unlock the door for her. However, Carol was impatient and even though Stark's condition wasn't critical, she still felt that it was best to get him into a warm bed sooner rather than later. Readjusting the way Stark was positioned in her arms, she stuck her fist out and fired an energy blast at the doorknob. It shattered like glass. She smirked.
Then, mere seconds later (or it felt like seconds to Tony. He may have blacked out.) A door slammed open and people started screaming. He heard a distinctive shout of "Metro Police! Put your hands up!" Tony tried to comply but found he couldn't. He was completely unable to move. He couldn't even open his eyes until he felt a hand roughly grab him and drag him to his feet. Very unsteady, Tony moved in the direction the cop was pushing him in.
Anyways, if you enjoyed this chapter, please leave a review or a comment or kudos or whatever. I cross-post, just do what's appropriate for the site you're on.
"He's going to be okay." The way Steve said that almost made Tony believe him. Keyword:
"Good." Pepper nodded. "Good to hear. Now, are you still going to be here this afternoon for your assistant interviews?"
Grace then turned and left the room. Margot allowed Adoniram to kiss the back of her hand before following her out. Within moments of their departure, Salinas and Freeman entered the room. Salinas walked in with his usual confidence, holding out his hand for Adoniram to shake and flashing him his almost iconic million-dollar smile.
"Oh, really?" A wry grin came across Steve's face. "And how exactly do you plan on doing that?" Tony smirked.
"Isn't it," Natasha asked. "Because the whole point was that I was scared you were going to die. I acted irrationally because I thought you were going to die. That's not…" She took a deep breath. "We've been in life or death situations before. I have seen you almost die before, but I was never
The girl scoffed at that.
I hate telling you this, but we've hit a dead-end.
"About what?" he asked.
"A lot?" Steve nodded. "I get it."
"For how long?" Lara hesitated. She wanted to lie, but she couldn't bring herself to.
In the center of the room, a pair of chairs were set up to face each other. Both chairs were the color of coffee cream, and both had a small table to their right. Dr. Cranston walked past Tony and over to the furthest chair.
"I just need to do something really quick," Tony said. "I'll be right back." He started to go down the hallway again, but Steve was right behind him.
help Dr. Banner, not the Hulk."
Anyways, if you liked this please leave a review. Be nice, though. I kind of need it after the hell week I've had. I think today's the only free day I have to myself and I intend to enjoy it.
"What do you care?" she asked.
"We'd rather you do the latter, though," Lara stressed.
"Fucking scared shitless," Lara said. "That's what."
"Well, it's nice to see that you've decided to rejoin the land of the living," she remarked. "I thought you were going to stay asleep forever." Her bagel then popped up and she turned her attention to transferring the breakfast treat from the toaster to her plate without burning herself.
"Stark, I swear to God if you don't tell me what the hell you mean…"
"Do you mind if I put some music on?" Tony asked.
"Yes," Adoniram said. "But placing him with them would arouse suspicion. Besides, we shouldn't be tempting the women into breaking their chastity vows. Also, isn't the phrase 'keep you friends close and enemies closer?" Salinas raised an eyebrow.
Tony raised an eyebrow at that but was nonetheless intrigued. With only a few seconds of consideration, Tony followed Fury and Coulson past a security checkpoint and through an elaborate series of hallways that seemed more like a maze than a functional corridor system. Then again, that was probably the point.
"And while we wait this out, they could be dying, and we wouldn't even know." Steve leaned forward and made direct eye contact. "Don't tell me that hadn't occurred to you." Natasha looked down and took a deep breath.
"I hate it when you're right," Tony said.
"Captain Rogers, Agent Romanoff, you're needed in the field, now." The sound of Commander Hill's voice instantly caused them to perk up. Both Natasha and Steve scrambled off the exam tables and rushed to meet her.
"That's good to hear," he said. "Anything else I need to be aware of?"
"Honey dust?" Clint questioned. "What's that?"
Walking towards the doorway to the stairwell, the Commander was quick to notice Agent Romanoff standing in their way. This couldn't be good.
"Dreams?" Clint took a deep breath.
"No, I don't," she said. "But shouldn't you stay here? I mean, I doubt it would be good PR for you all to suddenly leave, right?"
"Steve?"
"Ich libe ditch!" Tony was out of the room before Steve could properly translate out what that meant.
Marx nodded.
"Yes," Thor said regretfully. "And on behalf of my brother and all of Asgard, I must apologize for everything he has done."
"Thank you for the offer," Steve said. "But really, this is something I need to figure out for myself. Besides, I thought you said you wanted to lie down."
"You've had a headache for a few days?" he questioned. "Have you seen a doctor or anything?"
"What about Steve?" Tony tried to swallow around the knot in his throat, hoping beyond hope that Steve hadn't…
"Romanoff hates me anyway."
"Nervous," he said. "And also, a little achy, but mostly nervous." Steve rubbed his back sympathetically.
"Steve," he heard Natasha say. "You need to take a moment and just breathe."
"Alright," he said. "Looks like I'm going to have to show you."
"What are you saying?" His voice was as cold as it was the day he confronted that social worker in the yard.
"Oops…" Tony's voice dropped an octave. "Uh, Steve, you wouldn't happen to remember what I sent you two Christmases ago?"
Tony sighed. His mind went alight with all the possible naughty things he could ask for, but as much as he wanted it, he didn't
"We don't need you to consult on anything," Coulson said. "We just need to know if you have access to any of your father's old research files."
"What is this?" Carol asked. "You're acting like I'm going somewhere."
"Okay." She kept the word soft and short and gave him a look that gently urged him to explain further.
"I'm good, thanks." Salinas nodded before taking off down the hall again. Tony turned his gaze to the ceiling.
"I still don't get how this Skype thing works," Knežević said. "You're going to be on a phone, I'm going to be on a computer… How can a phone call a computer? Also, you said I'd be able to see everything, but I don't see how that's going to work."
"And what would that be?" Adoniram frowned.
Giving Steve's hair one last run-through, Tony got up and started walking. Initially, he was just going to lie down on the other side of the bed, but instead he ended up just following his feet through the door and out into the hallway. The door directly across from their bedroom was to Tony's private office. Without even thinking about it, he opened the door and stopped in the doorframe.
"So did that sort of set expectations high?"
"Um, you remember that I resigned right?" Adoniram's brow knitted in confusion.
"I know," he said. "But don't come in." Lara opened her mouth to question why, but Tony cut her off. "I'm serious. Take the day off. You deserve it."
"Well, excellent then," Viv said. "Then we can just jump right into the tour. Is there anything specific you wanted to see?"
"Stark," she said. "Come, now." The fire in her eyes made him not want to argue. He got up out of bed and followed Smith through the door.
She had her iPod queued up to "Another One Bites the Dust." Not her favorite Queen song, but good at drowning out background noise in her experience. Quickly after entering the building, a commotion could be heard. Lara started turning her iPod up, but as she kept going, the commotion grew louder. Turning her iPod up to the maximum volume, she finally saw what was causing all the noise.
"I know," Pepper said.
Breathing heavily – mostly from the shock and anxiety of the whole situation – Lara stuck the electronic key Tony had given her into the designated slot and waited for the elevator to lurch upwards. It was only then that she allowed herself to walk over to the far wall and collapse.
"Another Asgardian?" Natasha questioned.
"Mary was still pregnant," Peggy countered.
a Super Soldier. Pushing open the door to the foyer with his hip, Steve carried Tony over the threshold and down the hall to the local elevator.
She then led them to a medium-sized room whose lights had already been turned off for the night. As soon as they arrived at the threshold, Tony pulled Viv to the side and handed her a bill of unknown worth. Steve caught something along the lines of "give us a minute," but he let the conversation go over his head as he stepped further into the room. The lights came on automatically to reveal photographs and memorabilia all relating to Captain America.
"Yes," Tony said, only just then realizing that Steve hadn't been around for the AIDS epidemic in the 80's/90's. "Yes, that's very good."

In spite of all of that, it didn't change that she owed these people an explanation. After all, she just flew into their building with little regard for property damage or civilian injuries. Granted, she did think that something serious was happening, but that wasn't an excuse, especially when these people didn't know her at all. For all these people knew, she was a hostile threat and she honestly couldn't blame them for that. It was the natural assumption, after all. So, she needed to explain everything to them; who she was, how she got her powers, how she met Tony. The thing was, though, that not all of those memories were entirely clear to her.
"Yeah," Steve said. "I'm fine."
"Got it," Lara said. "So, that's the plan?"
"Home?" he questioned. "Like back to the hotel?"
"Trying to get me back in the world?" That would be rich.
"This was an attack?" he asked.
"It's more than that," Stark said. "He's already lost so many people. I didn't want to put him through something like that. I shouldn't have."
"FBI," he answered. "Special Agent Bergeron, how can I help you?"
"I can't, though." He knew Steve frowned at that.
"Why not?" Duran teased. "I mean, you practically had the girl eating out of your hand! I don't know how you do it!"
"I don't understand." She noticed the way Tony jumped a little bit when he realized that someone, he wasn't expecting had entered the room. "What's the problem? You certainly can afford to get a guy to do it, so it's not like you have to do all of the work yourself." Tony took a breath before responding.
"Interesting," the man said. "Was Stark there?"
"I'm okay. Don't worry. Go back to sleep." As an example, Tony rolled over so he was close to Steve and went back to sleep.
"You're avoiding it." Lara's nostrils flared and she looked from Pepper to Tony in complete indignation.
"They put me under and did surgery to install them," Clint explained. "That's pretty much it."
"You're not mad at me though, right?" Tony had to ask.
"Not now," Coulson explained. "He's busy handling a situation."
"Hey," Tony responded in a soft, sleep-laden tone.
Loki has been captured by S.H.I.E.L.D., but that hasn't kept him from hiding a trick up his sleeve. Using the power of the Mind Stone - unknowingly hidden in his scepter - he has turned the Avengers against one another, buying himself enough time to make a daring escape. Before anyone can come to their senses and realize what's happening, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s hellicarrier base is attacked and one of its engines destroyed. The blast also awakened the Hulk, who is now running amock across the ship. The Avengers have to pull it together and fast, otherwise, they're going to have to watch the world be destroyed from their watery graves...
"No one?" Clint questioned. "You mean you wouldn't tell the press."
"How do I make it worse?" He questioned. "Do you not like me? Is that it?"
"You want to know what someone told me once?" Tony asked.
fight back if someone tried to do something to him as drastic as a lobotomy. Of that, Steve could be absolutely certain. So, the fact that they hadn't heard a struggle, or a fight could only be promising.
!" Dante shouted at the same time Lara was speaking. "Shit, I can't keep this up anymore! Fine! I admit it! There was someone here yesterday!"
"That," he said. "Was the best thing anyone's ever said to me."
"Yeah," Tony responded quietly with a nod. Steve's hand stroked slowly up and down his back before coming to rest on his shoulder. Tony shut his eyes and leaned into the touch. He still couldn't believe that he and Steve were dating now. He was still waiting for the universe to reveal that this was all an elaborate joke and rip Steve away from him at any moment, so he was determined to enjoy it while he could.
Salinas helped Tony up and led him over to the car. Tony did not appreciate the assistance but decided that he had no choice but to accept it. He was too tired and uncoordinated to put up a fight now, anyways. Sitting down in the back seat, Tony relished in the feeling of the warm air of the heater washing over him. Salinas sat down next to him.
"The override is still active," Tony said. "If you hit the button for the penthouse, it'll take you there. When you get up there, have JARVIS stop the elevator and get your key. If you put it in the keyhole like normal, it'll turn off the override and no one will be able to get up there."
"So, how much are you going to pay me and what do you want me to steal?" A wicked grin spread across his face.
"Oh, of course." Bruce led the way over to the protective box. Betty was slowed by putting her bag down on the table and pulling her hair up, but quickly caught up.
Turning around to look back at the box, Knežević was stunned by the appearance of the box he slept in the night before. What was once cardboard being now a large coffin-like stone that was yellow in color? In attempting to lift it up, Knežević found that the "box" was much denser and heavier than the cardboard version. Putting his hands on his hips, Knežević was completely stumped. There was no logical explanation for the change. That was until his shorts started changing to solid stone around him.
"Just relax," Steve said. "It'll come." Things were quiet again for a few moments, until Tony felt the pressing need to ask something.
"Nope," she assured with a popping "p." "I heard about it from Pepper. While you were getting ready to kill yourself via formula one automobile accident, Pepper was complaining to me about the woman and let that little detail slip out." Tony sighed.
