"Happy Valentine's day to us," Steve said softly, smiling to himself.
I was hoping to save this update for a rainy day, when I feel that it would be a good day to update or I haven't updated in awhile, but I've been a pretty good mood all week and this weekend, so here we are.
"Do I have to? Pepper is going to kill me for this!" Tony asked, pouting slightly. Steve chuckled, tugging on Tony's arm until he was close.
When he gets to the medbay, he sees Bruce waiting there, glasses rested on the bridge of his nose and is settled comfortably in a chair, some sort of textbook in his hands.
Three days later, he was asleep in his and Tony's bedroom, head facing out towards the balcony that overlooked the rest of the city.
When Tony refused to move from his spot, Steve bent down to kiss his cheek.
However, his favourite thing about loving Tony is the fact that Tony feels as if he can come to him and tell him about his day, or the annoying intern who didn't get his coffee right, even though it wasn't his job to get Tony his coffee fix for that day. He loves that Tony feels as if he could vent to him whenever he was feeling frustrated with the board members after a meeting.
Not that he planned to do anything with the ring anytime soon. The stress that Steve was going through over them announcing the pregnancy to the rest of the world was enough for him to go through. Maybe when things calmed down and had settled somewhat would he pull out the ring.
Tony arched a brow. "And?" he pressed.
I'm currently busy writing the next chapter, so please bear with me.
It's not a new feeling, rather an old one that he'd experienced once or twice after receiving the serum, but it was still one that didn't make him feel too great.
looked at him since they broke up.
Steve flushes and he smirks.
"Nothing." He's aware that his response was short and gruff, but he couldn't care less.
His run with Sam was good, not like it usually was. And no matter how much Sam spoke, he couldn't really concentrate on anything that Sam had to say. He made sure to smile and to laugh and to make the right sounds whenever Sam looked his way for some sort of response, and it seemed to please Sam.
"Hi, Steve. Did you order anything for me?"
Tony steps forward and cups his face between his two hands.
"What?" he asks in a defensive tone, borrowing his brows and frowning when it only serves to make Steve laugh harder.
Rhodey snickered.
When he steps cautiously out of the elevator, she raises an eyebrow and smirks.
What would be infinitely
want a repeat.
"You know, I'm kinda sad that we won't see the rest of the gang this Valentine's Day," Tony said after a few minutes of silence in which they both focused on their breakfasts.
"Okay, okay, I get it. Now eat up, or else your waffles will get cold," Steve gestured to Tony's plate of food with his fork.
"See? There's nothing to worry about, Steve," Bruce assures him.
What feels like an hour later, the sound of someone keying in the code to the lab enters his mind, but he doesn't pay any attention to it, eyes only slightly blurry as he flicks through FRIDAY's corrections of his blueprints. He only startles when he feels someone's hands sliding around his waist.
He turns to face her and grins.
"Fine. You're entitled to your secrets." Tony said, "I've never been here before. It has a nice feel to it. Not like one of those stiff restaurants where I feel like I have to watch myself. I like it."
"You think so? I didn't exactly talk to her."
Tony chuckled, winking at Steve. "Whatever you want, Princess." Steve scowled and resumed walking.
Tony is more than happy to stand and watch Steve and his daughter. There's a warm, unfamiliar feeling spreading throughout his body, but he's not worried about it. Instead, he basks in the feeling.
It was silent in the common room, everyone had just overheard the
What Steve can't handle is Tony being the way he was right now. Not this morning. And it isn't just the fact that Tony is smiling at him, because Tony had smiled at him numerous times over the course of two days, but because today was different to any other day, and his nerves were already frayed at the edges. Which means that Steve isn't completely sure whether Tony was toying with him or being sincere at the moment, and he was too tired to look deeper into it.
"Do you really believe that? I still hurt our daughter, Tony. And she's here because I was reckless and I didn't even take care of her. A parent is supposed to look after their child, aren't they? And now she's here. Because of me. Because I didn't think and I went on that mission," Steve whispered, breaking away from the intense gaze he'd shared with Tony.
have.
When he opened his eyes, he made contact with Rhodey, who looked just as unimpressed and incredulous as he himself was feeling before opening his mouth just to say: "Well, I'm not touching that one with a ten-foot pole. They can sort this one out themselves."
He cocks his head to the side, feeling confused.
He opened his mouth, and then hesitated.
And also very panicked. So much so that Steve had a hard time getting him to focus enough so that he could find out what exactly had happened. Which, once Tony had calmed down enough and understood that he didn't want to force him to leave the bathroom, was much easier.
Immediately his ears were assaulted with noise. Beside him, Tony laughed, then moved closer to him so that he could see everyone.
Steve hadn't looked up yet and he cleared his throat, letting loose a chuckle of amusement when Steve's head whips up and his eyes widen at the sight of him.
He lost track of time a while ago, but he knows he's been down in the gym for a long time. Natasha and Clint had long come to soar and then left again, same with Bucky and Sam.
He just needs some space.
He stays silent, opting instead to glance down at Tony who is now properly asleep on his shoulder. He'd find it funny if the circumstances were different, but as they weren't, and he wasn't in the best of moods, he was feeling extremely annoyed and angry. He shifts his arm slightly, gripping Tony tighter to his side and tries to wake him up.
One ring, two rings, three rings.
Finally, a chapter! This was originally going to be part of a much longer chapter but I hated the idea that you guys haven't gotten an update from me in a while (for those of you who are still waiting around for me to update, I send you my most sincerest thanks for sticking around this long) and decided that I would update. I apologize for the long wait 🙈
"You can sleep as soon as you tell me what happened, Tony," he said, opting to use his name instead of surname. He didn't want to try and distance himself when Tony was like this.
If anything, his voice didn't relay any of what he was feeling and it was hard to get a read on Steve.
Tony tore his eyes away from the blue candy heart, eyes widening when he saw Steve kneeling in front of him on a bent knee.
"See that you do and
Steve refused to let that happen.
He likes to think that she won't be too mad at him for calling her, and since they're closer since living together - she lets him call her Tasha, if anyone else does it she glared at them until they either fall over themselves trying to apologize to her or they back off - he likes to think that she knows him well enough by now to know that he'll tell her things when he's ready to tell her.
Tony gave him a look. "- and two, there's absolutely nothing to worry about. I promise, baby."
Sometimes he replays their shared kiss on the balcony and wonders what it would be like now, exactly a year later, if he had told Steve he felt the same, if he hadn't been the one to hurt Steve. Would they be together, then?
He bit his lip so hard that he thinks it might bleed.
Until the next chapter!
And the next morning, when he's down in the kitchen and grabbing two mugs of coffee for the two of them and Pepper walks in, face already forming that familiar frown of hers that she got whenever she realizes he's got someone over, he's quick to stop her from walking into his bedroom and waking Steve up only to throw him out of the tower. He remembers the Christine Everheart situation from a few years ago and
"Sir, what project can I assist you with today?" FRIDAY's calm voice came from the speakers hidden in all corners of the lab. He felt a small smile tugging at the corner of his mouth.
Not even five minutes after Tony posted the tweet their phones started ringing.
Steve is quiet, eyes looking out at the passers-by and not at all listening to whatever Tony is saying.
He's so pathetic that even his own inventions don't listen to him.
He shelves the thought and refocuses on Tony who is struggling to keep himself awake.
"Excuse me, asshole. You're the one who bumped into me first! If you weren't so busy on that stupid phone of yours, you would've seen that the sidewalk was full of people. Maybe you should watch where you're going and do the normal thing and not stand in the middle of the walkway!" Steve snaps, gesturing to where Tony was standing; right in the middle of the walkway.
"I know that you're not mad at me. I also know that something else is on your mind. Judging by the fact that you never even made it to bed, I'm assuming that it's something to do with the time of year. Which tells me that you're thinking of your parents," Steve says carefully, hitting the nail right on the head.
"I woke up the day you were getting ready to leave and nothing felt right. And everyday while you were away it never felt right, everything just felt off. No matter who I spoke to or who I was with, everything felt different. And I - there's no way to explain it, maybe I'm paranoid or overthinking but I can't shake this feeling. I can't sleep because I dream about things that I have no right dreaming about. Not anymore. I'm happy here, I am. But how do I explain the thoughts that I keep on having?" he asked, taking a hand through his hair in agitation and frustration.
Oh, wait. He couldn't do that face to face. He'll just have to get him a gift that says 'hey, I'm sorry for making a complete fool of myself and making you babysit me, but here, take this as a token of my apology'. So he'll send a fruit basket then, actually, he thinks he'd rather buy him something artsy. Steve liked that.
And it was none other than Ty Stone.
He can't help but think that that was where things had started to go wrong for them, that they had depended too much on each other. More importantly, it was the point in time where he realized that
He'd fallen asleep against his will, and was still lying on top of the bedcovers, hands covered by the long sleeves of one of his sleep shirts.
"So, since it's both yours and Barnes' best buddies in there, you two should go sort it out," Clint said tactlessly, breaking the silence that had now spread through the common room as the rest of the team listened to the argument that flowed through the vents from Tony's lab down below.
Seeing this, Tony frowns slightly.
Tony nodded thoughtfully, rubbing soothing circles on his free hand.
He loved the way that Tony looked when his hair was like this; no product and silky-soft. He knew that Tony didn't like the way he looked without styling his hair, or even when wearing clothing that wasn't fancy, such as the lab clothes that he so often fell asleep in, but personally, privately, he loved this Tony.
story. And, well, they were shocked into silence, to say the least.
And this was only for while he was staying on the medical floor. When Steve finally left - and their baby was with them - there would be late-night diaper changes and feeding times as well.
Which is something that Tony didn't want.
The rest of the evening passes with them spending time together and for the moment, all thoughts of the mission that awaited them tomorrow - and Tony - is the farthest thing from his mind.
He didn't want his daughter to feel like she wasn't wanted or that she was different simply because she had two parents who weren't together. And yeah, he knows that kids go through it all the time when their parents get divorced - or when they break up.
He checks on Steve and finds that the blond is still sleeping peacefully. He moves quietly out of the plastic chair, wincing when his back and neck spasms slightly from the awkward position he'd slept in during the night. He really was getting too old to fall asleep just about anywhere.
When he deems Steve relatively calm and able to listen, he speaks.
He pushed a travel mug of coffee into Tony's hands and was gone.
"Steve?" he called the blond, hoping that Steve would look him in the eye.
Steve had barely had any chance to be annoyed at the showboating Tony had done for the team before Tony had completely left the tower. And by then it was too late to show his frustration and annoyance because the rest of the team had dispersed, and the only one who usually listened to his ranting about how annoying Tony was was Natasha, and she had left a few minutes after Tony had left the building to go back to her room, claiming to take a soak in her bath.
The fight with Doom had been over eight hours ago and Tony had been in the lab ever since the fight was over. Which meant that Tony hadn't even put ice over his ankle. And from what he remembered, if your ankle was sprained, especially if it was as badly sprained as Tony's was, you'd have to use an ice pack or ice bath immediately for 15 to 20 minutes and repeat every two to three hours while you're awake.
The nickname, as he learns, doesn't even affect her. Usually, Clint is the only one to call her that and no one else deigns to try, lest she decides to strangle them or murder them in their sleep.
He knows that he just told another lie to Tony; he's not going to be waiting there for Tony when he wakes up tomorrow morning.
Steve was willing to bet that Pepper and Tony's PR team wouldn't be too happy with the announcement, but what's done is done.
Okay, so she was a little like Pepper. Not amused by his jokes, or his charming attitude. He could work with that. Sort've.
"Hi! It's nice to meet you, Tony," Sharon said, extending her hand out to him.
Like ripping off a band-aid.
Tony shakes his head. "No, I'm good. Stop worrying about me and get some sleep."
Tony kept still, eyes never leaving his, waiting patiently until he was ready to speak without pushing him.
something was wrong, but he felt as if he needed to tell her what was going on.
It’s the third mission with the rest of the team in the last couple of months. If he’s counting - which he is; he hasn’t had much to keep his mind from roaming to more traitorous thoughts and at the moment he’ll take anything to keep his thoughts from wandering - then this is his fifth mission ever since he and Tony broke up.
“I didn’t want to bother you and it’s not exactly the first time I've sprained my ankle," Tony says.
In which Steve grows frustrated and throws someone overboard, and continues to ignore the obvious signs that maybe, just maybe, everything isn't okay.
"I'm coming, I'm coming, Tony! You need to go easy, okay? How's your head? Are you still feeling sick?" he asked, tugging Tony back until he was facing him so that he could scan him over once more.
Tony's eyes grew concerned and his face got more than a little upset at the information that JARVIS gave.
He knows for a fact that that is where the blend
He can tell that Steve's panicking, and he's ready to try to get her to stop but then the nurse is at Steve's side and instructing him to open his gown enough to expose his chest. The nurse hands Steve the baby once more and helps him adjust his hold so that the baby is placed over him.
They eat breakfast together and it doesn't take too long for Steve to finally cave and takes Tony's advice to go back to bed.
Big mistake. Very, very big mistake on his part.
"I'm still sore. My
It was a pretty bad joke, as most of Tony's jokes were, but it made him feel slightly better.
He supposed that the second clue was when he finally managed to get out of the shower and Tony was nowhere to be seen in the penthouse. When he'd asked JARVIS, all that the AI could tell him was that Tony was busy in the lab and would be out in time for supper.
So he went back to sleep, not straight away, because apparently, it was difficult to tell his brain that everything was alright even when his body had already caught up to that fact.
How useless. How was he supposed to help Tony when he forgot something as important at that?
No, JARVIS had sounded downright worried when he called the team down to the common room. And for an A.I. who had no emotions, he sure as hell sounded like a human then.
The silence wasn't awkward, wasn't even tense because Steve didn't even make an effort to say anything to him, just gave him a tiny smile and pulled out his phone, shooting off a text to someone before pocketing the device once again.
"You okay, Tony?" Steve asked, and just like that it felt as if whatever little composure he had, had broken. Cracked.
Steve's pliant in his hold, and seems to accept the comfort he offers; he's slumped in a semblance of an exhausted heap, his head laying low over Tony's chest, listening to the thump-thump of Tony's heartbeat.
So he helps Steve into the wheelchair.
For the sake of the nausea that has suddenly reared its head and his churning stomach, he hopes that she doesn't eat the two together.
"Hm, yes please. Waffles, with fruit? I made coffee." Tony gestured to the coffee pot with his mug.
"Great. I'll just pop out for a minute and then I'll be back soon, okay?" he told Steve.
"Quick question, how much have you slept since I left, honey?"
"You love me?" he asks softly.
"You're welcome...?" He pauses, not knowing what to call him.
"No, JARVIS. Just that."
Steve flips through the book and can't help but smile as he reads over the titles;
He feels rather than sees the smirk on Pepper's face, but says nothing to address it.
See, it was like this: Tony had come down from the penthouse dressed to the nines in a Tom Ford suit, shades in place over his eyes and greeted them goodbye with a jaunty wave and a wink before he left in his Audi for some charity gala.
He watched as she blinked slowly at him, each blink getting heavier and heavier and he knew then that he'd do anything for her.
Which made his job - and no, he really didn't mean it to come out sounding like it was some sort of chore to be Tony's boyfriend, but being Tony's boyfriend was a full time job - so much more difficult, especially since Tony still held his old insecurities concerning his past lovers close to heart.
Steve doesn't watch for long, and as he watches Steve, Tony can see the way the blond bites his lip and turns away before walking to the wheelchair and sitting down.
He practically ran for the door and didn't look back once, walking until he was at least a block away and leaned against a wall, sinking down to the floor.
It felt a lot like regret and jealousy when he watched them leave because that was something he wanted. He wanted Steve to joke around with him, talk to him, be around him, laugh with him, and yet, Steve couldn't even stand to be around him.
And Tony can't help the curiosity that takes over; he walks over and stands beside the chair that Steve's sitting in.
He phones Steve after an hour of waiting at their coffee shop and when Steve fails to answer his calls and texts Tony can't help but feel as if he'd been stood up.
"Yeah, yeah. I'm still telling Pepper. God, I can already picture her face." Wonder coloured Tony's voice, displaying just how happy he was.
He raised an eyebrow and cocked his head to one side.
He smiled, squeezing one of Steve's hands in his own, then extracted himself from Steve's grip, standing up.
Tony gave him a tight smile.
Steve stepped away from the door and held his hands up in surrender, inching his way slowly towards Tony.
Tony gives him a fond smile. "No need to thank me, Steve. Sleep tight, buttercup."
He had known that his life was messed up and tried to reach out to Bruce for help after the whole thing with the Mandarin but not even Bruce could help him. So he tried to help himself. He cleaned up his 'playboy' act and got married to Steve. They even adopted Peter, also famously known as Spiderman. And then Steve decided to throw everything away. He left Tony, his husband, and his own son. He threw it all away for his best friend who couldn't even remember him properly, but rather small figments of their friendship, fleeting memories of his former life before becoming the Winter Soldier.
think of stealing Tony's money. Steve cared too much about his health and Tony's
"No," Tony says and he grits his teeth.
He remembers it like it was yesterday, and he hates that what he remembers the most clearly of all from that night is the hurt that shone in Steve's beautiful blue eyes. And yes, those eyes of his were amazing to look at, were even more amazing when he decided to grace you with his attention. They were so expressive.
"Really," Steve says.
Exhausted.
Then Tony tilted his head so that he could lay a kiss on his lips, humming happily when he reciprocated without hesitating.
When he opens his eyes, he finds Steve waiting patiently for him to answer.
started, the A.I. had informed them that it been going on for the better part of an hour.
Bucky let out a loud whoop and Sam immediately stepped in to hit the back of his head, reminding him to be quiet. Steve forgot that they were in different timezones, so maybe the rest of the house was asleep.
Tony smiled slightly. "Kinda. I still feel as though she's talking a whole lot of crap," Tony said. "Really?" Steve laughed.
Sam and Natasha share a look that he won't try to decipher; if it's anything like the conversations they tried to bring up on several different occasions, then he doesn't want to know. He already knows what they're going to say, and he doesn't want to hear it.
"And I suppose it's a way you aren't going to share with the class?" Tony said sarcastically.
The only solution that he'd hadn't tried yet was reading.
Why did things like this always happen to him?
So he does what he does best. Talk until people are forced to listen to him and they eventually stop talking themselves.
When Tony looked up at him with a glare, he knew he was gone for, because frankly, Tony wasn't exactly that threatening in the state that he was in. If anything, Tony was like a small, angry little kitten. An adorable kitten that wasn't his right now.
"Pepper, just go before he wakes up and you scare him away. We'll talk later, okay? After I've woken up properly and had a good breakfast. And no, I won't be in to SI today. Steve and I have plans," he says as he turns his back to her and carries on with his task.
It's not like they jumped to that conclusion immediately, more that Steve had some sort of inkling as to what was going on with his own body. There was also the little fact that Steve wasn't entirely honest when he told Tony that he felt fine whenever he asked.
Tony watched Steve leave until the blond disappeared into the crowd. He grinned at the number in his phone, pocketing the device and putting his sunglasses back into place. He turned around and walked into the bank.
"Everyone always hurts me and then leaves."
So he ignored Tony's whining and the pout that made him want to back Tony up against a wall and kiss him until he was breathless (he knew it wasn't ever going to happen again, and told himself to forget it) and spun Tony around until the man was looking at him face to face. His eyes searched Tony's blown ones, and grabbed his hands, effectively stilling their movements midair.
Tony wasn't drunk, he was high.
The brown strands that he knew to be soft and silky were all tousled and out of place compared to how it had been styled when Tony had just left the tower for the gala.
been talking behind his back.
She raised an eyebrow at him.
And… Tony missed it.
Steve hurt him and, well, Tony knew he hurt him too but what was he supposed to do? Steve had lied to his face and then proceeded to walk away as if he didn't do anything wrong, leaving him lying on a cold floor in some abandoned place in Siberia.
Tony groaned into his hands, then glanced at the clock.
He watches as Steve blinks, different expressions flickering across his face and he bites his lip in nervousness.
He winces and Tony catches him, eyes going soft and he adjusts his grip on his hands, but Tony's misunderstood; he couldn't help but feel a stab of pain at the way Tony didn't call him Steve and chose to call him by his last name instead.
He needs to leave the gala, and soon. Tony needs to be checked over and the right people need to be notified on Tony's status (he knows that Pepper won't be too happy with him if he doesn't alert her, and Rhodes would be extremely worried and concerned about what his best friend had to ordeal at an event that supposedly had the best security), and he just wants to get home to the Tower as soon as possible and leave behind the terrible events of tonight.
"Not much to talk about, Stark. You were drugged, you call me, I got you back to the tower. As simple as that. Are we done now?" he says, voice not betraying any emotion.
It's because he's looking at the table while deep in thought that he doesn't hear the rest of the conversation and when he finally realizes that the briefing is over, both Sam and Natasha are having their own conversation, talking about the cookies that Sam's mom had baked so that he'd have something to contribute to the team dinner they had the other night.
"Steve! Where are you going? You have to stay with me!" he calls. Tony's hand is outstretched towards him and he has a determined look on his face.
"So? Are there wedding bells in the near future?" Natasha all but yelled into the phone. Steve could see in Pepper's square that she was nodding furiously along to Natasha's question.
Tony looked at her in confusion. "I want you to write a letter," she said and Tony blinked. "A letter?" he asked in disbelief. He didn't know how writing a letter would help him get over Steve.
Even though he knew that only one person had access to the penthouse, bar himself, he still startled.
"Yeah, I - Sorry. I didn't mean to snap at you like that. Both of you. It's just, I
Take now for example.
Also, he just really liked when Tony spoke. It never ceased to amaze him how Tony's eyes lit up and his hands made vivid gestures in the air whenever he spoke. Tony was like an excitable child whenever he spoke about things he was passionate about, and it often showed when he asked Tony to tell him about his day or what latest project he was working on.
"So am I, but I'm sure we'll be able to see each other again soon. And at least we're together. It won't be the same as last year's Valentine's Day but we can still celebrate," Steve said.
He doesn't know what drugs Tony was fed, and he'd feel better if Tony stayed awake until he got him safely back to Bruce at the tower.
That set alarm bells off in his head.
"That's a great idea, Cap. Did you mean it when you said you were going to come back?" Tony asked hopefully. "Yes, sweetheart, I did. I mean it. I'm coming back. I promise," Steve said.
just go through a traumatic birth, one that he wasn't even aware he
Wait, scratch that, who the hell even sang about their heartache? He certainly never wanted to write a song about how he was feeling, much less about how he hurt Steve.
Tony lifted his head to glare at him. "As a matter of fact, I have. Wanna watch
Bingo.
He’s happy when he’s got something to do, and this mission is a blessing in disguise, really. He didn’t even think twice before accepting the mission briefing from Tony.
"Tones, it doesn't matter. We're not saying anything about your relationship with Steve. We just want to know if you're sure about this. What if the guy is just after your money? We know there's the possibility that he isn't, " Rhodey tries to placate, "but there's also the possibility that he is. Look at all the other times someone wanted you for your money."
He gets the bill and drives back to the tower, feeling frustrated and disappointed and all out of sorts.
"Why did you drug him? What were you possibly hoping to achieve by doing this to him?" he asks. He's so furious that he's hands are shaking with the effort to keep from punching Tiberius Stone in his ugly face.
Right, whether Tony wanted to or not, they were going to leave this bathroom and the gala, and nothing would get him to stop.
"Tony? Are you okay? How are you feeling?" Bruce asks. He's cleaning his glasses using the bottom of his lab coat, eyes checking over Tony.
"You weren't in bed. Why?" Steve asks. His tone of voice isn't accusatory, more curious, and slightly confused. If the sight wasn't so endearing he thinks that he just might snap at Steve. But Steve looks cute when he's confused and instead of snapping at Steve like he wants to, he settles for something slightly bitter.
Steve sent him a smile. "Good morning, Tony," he greeted, "I slept well. And you? You aren't stiff from sleeping in that chair? I know it couldn't have been all too comfortable for you. You could've gone back to the penthouse to sleep, you know, I would've been fine."
Apparently he didn't, because the doors stayed stubbornly closed and he sighed.
his type.
He knew that something was bothering Steve, had a very good feeling that he knew what it was too, but receiving confirmation from the man would make him feel better.
And then he thinks of Tony who is warm and all-too trusting and vulnerable right now, Tony who is currently dosing on his feet, head leaning on his shoulder and using him as a crutch and he feels the familiar burn of anger flow through him once more.
Bucky grinned, whooping as he jumped off the sofa and ran to the elevator, presumably to fetch his coat. Well, he got that from what little he could make out of Bucky's brooklyn drawl. It was always hard to make out what he was saying whenever he got excited.
He gave a short, jerky nod.
"Really?" he hears himself ask.
Which tonight was.
He should've known that once Pepper figured out what was going on between him and Steve, it wouldn't be too long until the news got to Rhodey.
"Hi, Sharon. Sharon, you haven't met Tony yet. Tony, this is Sharon. Sharon, this is Tony," Steve introduced.
Am I the only one that thinks Tony's love language is providing for people??? Like, he makes them gear, pays for things and buys food? It's the way he shows his love, people!
Sometimes his AI was too goddamn smart.
He knew that it was wrong, it being Christmas Eve and all, but he couldn't lay in bed any longer. His mind replaying his parents' death's in his head like some sort of broken film. Steve was dead to the world, exhaustion clear on his face even in his sleeping form. He knows he should be a good boyfriend and stay in bed, but being near Steve seemed too much for him at the moment. And the guilt at staying away from his slumbering boyfriend was practically eating him alive, but he soldiers on and shakes it off like he always does.
"I should've known about her. I should've guessed that something was wrong, that my body changed. Who doesn't notice that, Tony? And now… God, I'm so, so sorry. All I can do is apologize, but sorry isn't going to fix anything, is it? It's not going to fix the fact that our - that our daughter isn't - I'm sorry. Tony, I'm so
"Okay, okay, okay! You can stop now, it was just a joke. Relax. I've got a team that deals with things like this, should someone decide they wanted to kidnap me. It's a process. Going back to dinner, well, it depends on whether or not you say yes. So what do you say? Friday night? Six pm?" he asks.
They're quick to accept his apology and give him their reassurances.
"You see, the footage that JARVIS showed me says something different. You could've just picked me up and dropped me off at the medbay. Easy peasy. No muss no fuss. But you didn't. You checked with Bruce to make sure that I was going to be okay. Why? Why didn't you just leave and go to your floor?" Tony questions, sounding frustrated.
"Tony?" Steve called.
"Yes. I'll try feeding her," Steve says.
But now, seeing Steve hold their daughter was, well, the sight was breathtaking, for lack of better words.
"Sweetheart," And wow, he never thought it was so easy to slip into what they were before, easier still to use the nicknames that he teasingly called Tony whenever Tony called him by his nicknames. "Hey, it's okay. I promise. Don't stress, we'll figure it all out one step at a time. Just take it slowly, alright?"
"Captain Rogers has slept for a total of three hours while you were away, Sir," came the response from JARVIS and Steve felt shame burn through him.
"Shut up. I don't sleep well by myself and I was severely sleep deprived and hyped up on caffeine. And you don't get to play the innocent card! I believe you were warned in advance by both Rhodey-bear and Pepper before we got together, so you can't say you weren't warned about my genius ideas. And the sentient toaster was a brilliant idea! My baby is just scared of Thor and his pop tarts, that's all," Tony patted the toaster lovingly.
And who knew that signing himself up for therapy and dealing with stupid shrinks who told him to write letters that he wouldn't send - who even writes letters anymore? - was a step towards healing? But the thing that really helped? The thing that really helped was picking up the phone and calling Steve.
"Lay it on me. Can't be worse than last year. I'm pretty sure he sent me a couple of Valentine's Day messages while he was drunk," Steve said, knife poised in the air as he thought back to the year before.
He's sure that if he had to spend time in the tower doing absolutely nothing while he waited for the next self-made villain until they decided that they wanted to attack the city, then he'll go completely crazy.
The waiter nodded.
"Come on, let's get some dinner and watch a movie. I'm starving," she looks over her shoulder at him, "And I miss my bonding buddy. We haven't done anything fun together in a while."
This argument that Tony and Steve were now involved in was the worst one that they had ever overheard.
He slowly moved away, unwrapping his arms from where it had been around Tony's waist until he was looking at Tony.
At the questioning looks, he explains.
But that was when they were still on good terms and he didn't want to do (or say) anything when Tony couldn't defend himself in the state that he was in.
Feeling guilty yet again - Steve can't remember feeling anything else during these past few days beyond exhaustion, guilt, and embarrassment and he's starting to get fed up with himself - he tosses his duvet aside and slips out of bed.
He's just stepping out of the elevator when he sees Natasha waiting for him. Apparently, she had been waiting for him for a while; there was a novel lying on the seat next to her, and he could see the flashes coming from the big screen light up the dimly lit room.
Something was amiss. And he was definitely not that much of a prick to let something like the argument that he and Tony were involved in stop him from thinking rationally. He needed to forget about their explosive argument if he wanted to help Tony, whether he was just messing around or if he was really in need. Not that he was willing to take the chance and put the phone down on the off chance that Tony really needed his help.
Well, his night certainly wasn't boring, that's for sure.
The word “caro” or “cara” is one of the most common terms of endearment. It means “dear,” and you’ll hear it paired with other words – “caro amico,” for instance, or even “caro mio” for “my dear” – or used all by itself. Incidentally, the word “caro” also means “expensive,” in the same sense that in old-fashioned English we might say something that is too costly is “too dear.”
"You know, you're such a fucking dick. Of the two of us, people actually thought I was the type to cheat. Guess they were wrong, and that even America's Golden Boy can't resist the temptation of someone flirting with him. How absolutely sinful. The public would be up in arms if they knew."
A number of emotions flash across Steve's face. Steve looks confused, then hurt and finally determined.
Now all he had to do was get through was breakfast.
He's more than halfway there. Something that he's happy about. Now, whenever he looks at Tony it doesn't hurt as much and he's not fighting back what feels like a permanent lump in his throat. Instead, it's a dull ache that forms in his chest.
"We need to talk. About last night, I mean," Tony says bluntly.
Well, there's the snarky genius that everyone (himself included) knows and loves.
He made the action of crossing his heart and Steve rolled his eyes, the corners of his lips quirking up slightly in a semblance of a smile. Albeit, one that Steve tried hard to resist doing.
Eventually, Pepper sees that she hasn't gotten a single word through to him and she rolls her eyes and throws her hands up in exasperation, leaving his office and grumbling something about his frustrating antics and how one day he was going to drive her to quit.
Not even a week later he gets an unsuspected visit from his best friend.
“Tony,” he sighs, “Why didn’t you just say something? How long have you been hurt? And why didn’t you tell me?”
Tony looks extremely guilty.
So instead he nods. He turns to leave and is more than surprised when Tony calls after him, iron man sticker now forgotten.
"Because I figured that Tony deserved it! He took what was rightfully mine. Do you have any -"
He already feels antsy whenever he's in the tower, almost as if walking around the various halls and floors would suddenly make Tony appear in front of him. It's an invalid fear, of course, ever since he and Tony broke up it was like whatever agreed-upon idea made to remain friends was put on the back-burner while they sorted through whatever they needed to go through.
When Steve glances out the window, he understands why. The weather outside looked to be one of the days where it was nothing but cold and wet.
He knows it's a remnant of all the things Steve has had to go through and face; years of bullying and snide comments from strangers and co-workers finally getting to him and wearing him thin.
if you say it sounds interesting."
"Yes, Sir. The lab is indeed locked," JARVIS says and he rolls his eyes.
Steve relaxes against the pillows, getting comfy. When he replies, his voice is soft, sleepy, and his eyes flutter slightly. "Thank you, Tony."
The words choke him up, and he struggles to keep his eyes dry.
than I already am. How about I treat you to dinner? As an apology?" He tries. Never let it be said that Anthony Edward Stark didn't know what he was doing when it came to
"You should sleep. Take a nap."
However, that did not mean that he didn't feel the cold settling into his bones like it had made a home inside of him. In a way, it had ever since the ice. His skin grew cold and his core temperature dropped whenever it was a bad day for him.
"I can't. I'm not tired," he argues. As far as arguments with Steve go, it's a weak one, and Tony knows it, which is why he raises an eyebrow.
He's still standing awkwardly in the room, and Steve motions towards the chair that Tony's occupied from the beginning of Steve's stay on the medical floor.
Tony didn't have a quick reply for that one, and chose to stay quiet with his mouth hanging open, face appalled at the fact that his A.I had just showed him who's more superior when it comes to sarcastic retorts.
He takes the small pile of clothing from Steve's hands and packs it away in the open drawer, making sure that everything was packed away neatly before closing it.
Tony scowls.
He recalls Steve carrying him last night in his arms like he was some sort of invalid and groans, putting his head in his hands. Steve was so warm and had smelt so nice. And he was really good at cuddling, not that he would ever be caught saying that, of course.
"And how are you doing? Sure, Captain Rogers, sorry,
His face pales and he rushes to the bathroom, emptying his already empty stomach.
Steve instantly agrees. It's safer to go with Tony and leave the nursery behind them, that and all the words left unspoken. He just doesn't have the energy to deal with whatever Tony seems to have going on inside his head. Not this morning.
"I thought you said that you never 'pegged me as one of the people who sucked up to their boss' type people. I'm just proving your theory correct," she sniffed.
"Alright, Tony. Thank you for not bothering my patient. He needs his rest, and with you added in the mix that's highly impossible. I doubt you had a… What was it that you called it? Oh, right. A civil conversation. Maybe a slightly stilted one, of course, but I'll take what I can get. So long as my patient is calm and he isn't in a state, I can tolerate your presence."
"You okay?"
Tony's mouth fell open in mock-horror, and then he pouted.
"Well, well, well. If it isn't the knight in shining armour. Wait, that's Tony. You're the knight in red, white and blue spandex." she says with an amused smile playing on her lips. She stands up from the sofa that she had been lying on and walks towards the pair, eyeing Tony with critical eyes.
"Hey, hey, hey. Shh. Steve, look at me. Okay? Look at me. I want you to listen very carefully. It's okay. I don't blame you. And you shouldn't blame yourself either, alright? I want you to answer something for me," Tony said and Steve nodded quickly.
Tony smiled at him, sitting down next to him.
"You alright? Comfy?" he asks.
along?" Steve asked, managing to sound slightly incredulous.
The thought was sobering and he stopped laughing. Doctor Mikhailov must've sensed the shift in his mood because she looked at him in concern.
"Yeah, babe?"
The moment is over too soon and he's left watching as Steve walks away from him. He's partly disappointed that the blond - Steve is walking away, but that quickly vanishes when he catches sight of Steve's perfect ass. He doesn't feel too guilty and pays no mind to the little voice in his head that sounds like Pepper telling him to stop objectifying people.
Steve raises an eyebrow at him. "Really? So Pepper didn't think I was after your money, then? I guess I must've imagined it."
Not that it was a secret, of course. Tony had told him numerous times before that he was warm and comfortable.
She didn't ask him what was wrong, or
meant to use Steve like that, and it wasn't supposed to last all that long, really, not when he and Pepper were still sorting out things between them, but then he had fallen for Steve as time went on, and Steve was unaware of that little bit of information, if the fact that he went out to dinner with Sharon was anything to go by.
Tony was finally his. And he belong to Tony.
Tony wasn't his, was never his to start with, and these thoughts that were swirling around his head needed to stop or he was going to lose his mind.
"Sir, the lab is locked," JARVIS informs him.
He crosses the room to the ottoman where the pink gift bag from Pepper lay discarded. Steve picks it up and sits down on the edge of the bed, finding that he was curious to know what was inside. The bag wasn't heavy, nor too light, which meant that the contents in the bag were on the small side.
He cuts her off.
Tony pocketed his card and grabbed Steve's hand and they left the coffee shop together, both of them wearing infectious smiles.
He was mad at Tony, but he couldn't find it in himself to be mad at Tony when he was like this. When he was stuck in this situation. Especially because he wasn't firing on all senses.
At least she wasn't scolding him. Which was a massive step up from last night, if he remembered correctly.
Tony is really angry now. How can his friends say that about Steve? Steve wasn't like anyone else, he would
He debates going back to sleep but decides that he's too keyed up to simply lie there and wait for sleep to come. So when he finds himself outside Morgan's nursery it's not a surprise.
And that's why, when the compound was dark and silent, everybody finally asleep, Tony slipped out of bed and made his way across the room. His heart was beating erratically in his chest and his head was pounding in time with his heart, making his quest to the draw where he stored the phone so much harder. Tony inhaled and closed his eyes, leaning his head against the cool surface of the window, allowing him to think things through, hopefully with a positive outcome at the end. He opened his eyes and stared at the cityscape. It was quiet.
Tony moves further into the room, moving closer to the bed until he's less than a foot away. And then he decides 'fuck it' and sits on the edge closest to Steve.
There's a moment of silence between them, and Tony debates on whether or not to tentatively approach the topic of Steve and their daughter staying with him in the penthouse, or to simply come out and say it.
After, dessert resumes as normal and they spend the rest of the evening together, watching movies and sipping on wine until the early hours of the morning.
So he does what he does best; get's his anger and frustration and embarrassment and longing out of his system by heading to the gym and punching itt out.
He puts his hand on Steve's shoulder and leans down to look at her properly. "She's ours," he says, and Steve nods. "Yeah, she is."
The shower works wonders on his aching neck and back, not that he notices it. His thoughts are stuck on Steve and his daughter.
And now that he's blurted everything out to Steve, it really doesn't seem that bad. It might be awkward - they weren't together anymore, after all - but for the sake of their daughter and the fact that it simply wasn't practical to pack a bag for her at the end of every week and dump her on the other's floor when their week with her was over, it was easier for them to live together. It made him uncomfortable and brought back memories of when he was a child and when Howard had him shipped to boarding school. Granted, the situations weren't the same, but the feeling of living out of a suitcase and the feeling of not being wanted was something that made him pause and think that a situation like his past one could be prevented.
He nods, putting Tony down gently onto the bed. Tony stirs slightly, and he pauses, but to no avail. Tony wakes, eyes blinking against the harsh artificial light coming from overhead.
Tony's eyes widened before he glared, nostrils flaring in anger. If Steve was trying to rile him up, to anger him, then he was doing one hell of a job.
Tony nodded and he turned around, unlocking the door.
Steve looked at him, noticing the way Tony wasn't completely at the breakfast table but rather some place further. There was no doubt that there was something on his mind. Judging by his tone of voice and the way he brought up the topic of Valentine's day, Tony was probably missing their friends. Not that Steve wasn't, to course. He missed them as well, but their friends were spread out all over the place and wouldn't be able to travel any time soon.
It takes them both a while to figure out that all of their outings together were actually dates. To remedy the fact that neither of them were acknowledging them as the dates they were, they decide to go out on a few more dates, this time going to proper restaurants that required suits and visiting the museum (Tony liked seeing Steve's eyes light up in happiness whenever they saw the various art pieces).
"I missed you," he mumbled, his happy mood evaporating.
"I love you, and I'm not going anywhere, okay?" Tony whispers and he nods, eyes burning with tears.
Steve gives a jerky nod of his head. "Yeah, I - It's just -," Steve gives up, voice thick with emotion, and Tony doesn't comment on it, instead giving him a small smile and squeezes his shoulder comfortingly.
- very clear.
And yes, having someone like Steve who was willing to overlook his own discomfort at this situation in order to comfort him felt nice. It was nice knowing that someone cared about him.
Tony's ankle was extremely swollen, and although he might not be a medical doctor or have the same amount of medical experience as Bruce, he could at least tell that it was a grade three sprain from his time spent in the army.
"Hey, Fri, get ready to add some input on the blueprints for the new StarkPhone. It needs to be checked, although I know everything is correct because I'm a genius, but I also know that Pepper will take great joy in threatening me with those killer heels of hers if I don't check it before I send it off to R&D," he said, pulling up a hologram in front of him and sitting down.
The doctor had also left strict instructions for Tony to help Steve. When she'd done that Steve had looked unhappy, but didn't protest too much.
Steve squeezed Tony's hand in his, then directed his attention to their waiter one more time. "You have our thanks. Thank you for the blessing," he said. It was kind of her to give them a blessing.
"Steve, honey, look at me, hey - there you are," Tony took his hand in his, waiting until he was looking at him. "I love you so, so much. And it hurts me to see you like this. Why didn't you sleep while I was away?"
By now, he's literally had enough of everything and is so frustrated that he doesn't even think before grabbing Tony's hand and heading towards the bathroom door.
Steve wouldn't do this alone.
And the fact that JARVIS had alerted them to what was going on between them was worrying.
And then he was standing in front of Tony, eyes burning and hands clenched.
He'd bumped into Steve on the sidewalk a couple of months ago when he had told Pepper he was going to get a coffee from the coffee shop downstairs when in reality he was planning on skipping the board meeting and going for a walk until it was over instead.
He doesn't know what to say. How else could he say that he wanted to be there when Tony woke up? He didn't want to appear transparent, although he knows that the entire team knew about his and Tony's argument the other day.
"I'm fine, Tony. Just a little sore."
"Steve?" he slurs. He looks disorientated, and he opens his mouth to reassure Tony that he was fine, and that he was safely at the tower, but then Bruce is suddenly at his side and leaning over Tony's form.
Steve feels his fingers twitch and he wished he had a pencil and some paper so that he could draw Tony. Tony's hair was all mussed and his expensive suit rumpled. In that moment he's never wanted Tony to be his more.
The next time he sees Steve, he's been dragged to the bank by Rhodey who claims that it's an absolute necessity to know how to bank. Apparently, online banking doesn't count. When Tony had told Rhodey that he absolutely knew how to bank and that he could do it in three easy steps from the comfort of his home, all Rhodey had done was sigh and pinch the bridge of his nose. And then he'd said something along the lines of "You've never set foot in a bank, have you?" and Tony didn't exactly know how he was going to deny it, so he settled for "Anyone who doesn't do online banking is a heathen".
"It's a new restaurant. They just opened up a couple of months ago and have got nothing but good reviews and glowing recommendations," Steve explained, leaning back in his seat as he relaxed.
Tony nods, eyes flock JG to the door and then his face once, twice, three times until they settle.
It's not that difficult to join the conversation and soon he finds himself laughing both at Sam's dry humor and Natasha's quick wit. He notices that they're purposefully poking fun at one another in an attempt to make him laugh and speak more, which he does, and chooses not to say anything at their lack of subtlety.
I've finally managed to update! I apologize for the long wait but things were super hectic on my side.
Well, he knew why, the reason was currently trying to persuade him to let them fall asleep on his shoulder (which he wasn't going to fall for, dammit, he wasn't a pushover) but wasn't very successful.
And yes, maybe it was because Steve had this bad habit of playing with his fingers whenever he was nervous or worried or anxious, and it had just been something that Tony had picked up during their relationship - and found rather adorable, really. Steve was usually so confident that seeing him do something like that was like witnessing a rare moment - but this was also
"Oh, yeah. I forgot about the boxes. But you didn't have to unpack them yourself, I could've had someone else do it." Tony scratches his head, stepping out of the entryway and deeper into the nursery.
"I apologize, Sir, but I cannot do that. My main priority is to look out for you and I believe that it is in your best interest if you and the good Captain talk to one another."
He's so goddamn embarrassed by his actions from the night before that should he ever decide to leave the lab - which, thank you very much, was not going to happen in the next ten years, he'll send out the iron man suit and pilot it from the tower if there was a need for iron man out in the field - he's not sure how he's going to show his face.
"Yeah, Tony?"
Because something is immensely wrong.
Steve, and he wouldn't do something like that," he said, unable to look either of them in the eye.
The little flight he took around the city really helped. He felt a lot better after it, and if the wind roaring around his closed helmet was all that he needed to feel better about this whole crappy situation, then he knew that he'll be taking a whole lot more flights in the near future.
That day she told him that he was the only person that Tony had ever properly introduced her to, disregarding the fact that he was an Avenger and she'd met him before, and had seen every piece of information museums and textbooks had on him. It was concerning that she had thought of their meeting like that, because while they had been introduced to one another, with Tony doing all the introducing, it had been nothing more than a simple meet and greet. Tony was just being polite - well, as polite as Tony Stark ever got - and she was honoured that Tony had done that.
He pulls his hands our of Tony's grip and steps back, not looking Tony in the eye and gathers his things.
And I that moment, all they could focus on was each other. When their lips met, Steve felt as though everything was finally coming together again, and all we forgiven.
"I'm only teasing, Tony." Steve looked up from where he was making their breakfast, sounding slightly put out.
"You're right. Doesn't mean this doesn't suck, though. I was looking forward to eating my body weight in pizza and sweet treats and then watching all those cheesy romcoms that Nat swears she doesn't watch." Tony poked at a bite of waffle, chasing it around his plate with his fork. Steve could tell that Tony was trying his best to come across as joking, but to his ears it sounded flat, almost as if it were forced.
"Goodnight, Tony. Sleep well," he says.
He had no idea what this was.
Steve looks up, a slight flush coloring his cheeks.
Steve feels a flash of something akin to irritation flare up at Tony's words, but he tamps down on the urge to give a scathing remark and chooses instead to watch as Tony surveys the work he's done in the nursery this morning with a critical eye.
Steve looked good, well, as good as someone who just gave birth could look. Apparently, he'd manage to take a shower, because Tony could see that the blond's hair was wet and he looked refreshed.
"JARVIS, shut that off, now. And fire up the suit. Daddy needs some time to think," he said, getting out of his chair.
It's only when Tony clears his throat - for the second time - does Steve startle and look up to find the brunet watching him curiously.
The conversation that he had with JARVIS replayed in his mind, sparking his anger at Tiberius Stone once more.
In less than five minutes, the entire process is done and Bruce gathers his equipment to pack away.
Sometimes he wondered why he made A.I's that just repeated everything he said.
Looking outside seemed to help him to center himself.
He sighs. "Come here," he says and holds out a hand.
Tony raised an eyebrow. He sensed some insecurity from Steve's side. And wow, how could a guy like Steve ever be insecure? Steve was hot as hell, and when he scolded Tony he looked adorable.
When they do finally get to the room, it's like a wave of exhaustion settles over Steve, and he struggles to fight back a yawn, but to no avail, one slips out.
It takes slightly longer than it usually would to get them moving, especially with Steve moving slower because of the pain he was in.
And the media, well, they'll have a field day.
"Sorry! I didn't mean to bump into you, I promise. It's just, Bucky is going to be so mad at me. I lost track of time and -"
This time it's Tony's turn to blink.
"I did that. I caused this," Steve interrupts.
He had to be, seeing as he had contributed to the problem. Not that it was a problem, more of an… unplanned adventure that started last night and will last for the next eighteen years.
Bruce preps the needle and three vials and in less than a second the needle had pierced Tony's skin, and Tony watches with childlike fascination how the blood flows through the tube and into the vials.
It's a foreign feeling for him, and he doesn't like it, but he would be lying if he wasn't excited at the prospect of trying something new. He wasn't the type to back down from a challenge. And he has a feeling Steve will provide him with plenty of challenges.
Last Christmas was pretty shitty, too.
And if a few tears fell when he kissed Tony and pulled him closer to his body in thanks, well, that was between them.
Both of Steve's hands were fisted in Tony's blazer, pulling Tony closer to him.
I know, I know. Y'all can yell at me all you want about how frustrating it is that Steve is so oblivious to what's going on with his body. I promise you, I will yell along with you. Steve is clearly in denial.
Tony was vulnerable and he felt like the worst person alive.
Tony must’ve picked up on it too because if possible, he hunches over even more and pointedly avoids his eyes when answering him.
He could feel the last bits of his dark thoughts fade away to the back of his mind the longer he spent down in the lab. The sounds were familiar, the work second nature to him.
As soon as she was in his arms, it was like all the breath was knocked out of him. He was too afraid to breathe too loud or to hold her too close in case he accidentally hurt her.
"That will be all, Ms. Potts. Have a good day."
Tony leans heavily on him, face screwed up in pain and he hates the way a pained whimper escapes Tony's tightly sealed lips.
He can hear Bruce puttering around in the background, his back turned towards them to give them some semblance of privacy.
And he was still going at the punching bags.
Judging from the look of horror on Steve's face, he was right, too.
He steps around Stone's pathetic form that is hunched over, clutching at his bleeding nose and gets into the car, shutting the door behind him and smiles down at Tony's sleeping form.
(See the end of the chapter for
So he sees the way more tears spill from Steve's eyes and roll down his face before Steve wipes them away quickly.
"Yeah, Tony?"
Tony stops headbutting his shoulder and his eyebrows furrow in thought. He nods not even a second later and at that moment Steve regrets not mentioning Bruce sooner.
His main priority right now was to get Tony out of the bathroom and to Bruce at the Tower. He knows that Tony hates medical, but he would feel so much better if he knew what was really wrong with Tony.
Hi everyone!
The only way he could get Tony out of the bathroom was if he carried him out. But that would garner all types of negative attention. Also, he didn't think that Tony would make his job very easy. But then again, it was never easy with Tony Stark.
“Tony, what’s wrong?”
Maybe he should just disable JARVIS.
Satisfaction is thrumming through his veins and he feels himself grin at the petty revenge.
Pepper always did whatever she wanted, and had no time for anyone who told her that she couldn't do something.
"Enjoy," the waiter said, leaving with a smile as soon as Tony had taken the dish.
He thinks of Sharon who is sweet and kind. She's not his type, and he thinks that he put her in the 'friends' category. That's as far as he even got to admitting that he was head over heels in love with Tony, but he's too proud to admit it.
"Why would I joke about dinner? What jerk would make a joke like that?" he asks.
And now the team had been crowded around the common room, each in various states of undress and all wearing similar looks of exhaustion.
No, he wasn't lying to himself.
"As you say, sir. I shall wait patiently until then. However, I do have a rather pressing question that regards you selling me to 'a community college', as you so eloquently put it; who will help you remember whenever you have a meeting with Ms. Potts? Or help you upgrade DUM-E or U or Butterfingers? I won't be able to help you from my post at a community college, sir, and as you very well know, I can't keep you out of trouble if I'm not by your side. As that seems to be the case every second day of the week, my job as your protector is thus 'a moot point', as you so often like to say," JARVIS said, sounding oddly smug and sarcastic at the same time.
When he saw Steve sitting up in bed, he smiled, entering the room and closed the door behind him.
In itself, that was pretty weird. The whole them being close situation. Because Tony and Pepper were broken up, but not properly broken up and Sharon seemed real flirty with Steve whenever they happened to bump into her on the Helicarrier. Which was rare - she worked for the CIA and didn't really affiliate herself with SHIELD anymore, not properly, at least - thank god for that.
"Don't ever call me Princess again, " Steve said.
And yeah, sure, they ended things between him, but those things still stood; Tony would still do anything for Steve.
Steve's features soften, and he smiles at Tony from beneath his lashes, a look of slight embarrassment on his face.
He knows that it's wrong, and he knows that if Tony wasn't high or whatever was wrong with him, then Tony would be betrayed by what he was thinking of doing, but he was desperate, and it was for Tony's own good.
"You're crazy, you know that? But something tells me you're used to people telling you that. As for Steve, I was just about to head to his room. I'm sure it would be alright for him to visit the baby. I'm sure he'd feel better when he gets to hold her. Well, longer than he did last night. I'd like to do a quick check-up to see if everything's healing up as it should be, but hopefully, Steve will be discharged tomorrow."
Truth be told, he never really thought past that, which, in hindsight, was an issue on his behalf. Really, he was just so surprised and caught in the moment when Steve was in the throes of labor that when everything was finally over, he was still reeling from it. And then after, when he called Pepper, the whole thing with the living arrangements hadn't even been on his mind.
He's standing outside the doors of the bank with Rhodey trying to coax him inside (the man had even tried to bribe him with the promise of coffee and red velvet cake, not that he was going to admit to it working, of course) when someone bumps into him.
Steve sighs wearily and rubs a hand down his face, screwing his eyes shut.
The last thing that he pulls out of the gift bag is a gold box. He's slightly confused but he spies the bright blue Post-It stuck on what he supposes is the lid. He takes a moment to read it and immediately feels a swell of gratitude for Pepper. She really was a godsend in all of this.
Steve focuses his bright blue gaze on Tony.
Pepper sighed, pulling her hand off his wrist.
He hated it whenever he woke up and everything just seemed off. Wrong. Not wrong, that wasn't the proper word for it, just that something wasn't right in the world. It was concerning, and worrying because when he woke up, everything was fine, the room was just as they'd left it the night before. It was dark out still, not yet time for him to be up for his run with Sam, and Tony was still sound asleep next to him, seemingly unaware of his inner self-conflict.
"Obsessed? Steve, in case you weren't aware of what a relationship is about, it's between
He turns around, face showing his confusion.
however, is if Sam just accepted his offer at staying in the tower. That way he wouldn't have to travel back and forth between his house and the tower every week. Also, he would get the satisfaction of being able to say that he finally managed to get Sam to stay at the tower. But, seeing as this was almost a year-long argument with no signs of Sam's resolve weakening in sight, it just served as making everyone vaguely irritated that they couldn't get Sam to accept the invitation to stay in the apartment that was made for him.
It really is easier to just crash in one of the many guest rooms in the tower.
When he reaches the medical floor, it's busier than it was earlier, but not overly so; there is more medical staff walking around, and he could see a few men and women dressed in business attire, which made him put them into the 'employee of Stark Industries' category, and not 'family who were visiting patients' category.
So they make plans and Pepper joins them for dinner.
"Tony, I'm going to help you stand, and then we're going to medical so that we can sort out your ankle."
"So Clint was up bright and early this morning. Sent a whole bunch of messages. You know, the usual Valentine's Day ones. I swear, this man has a freaking arsenal of pick-up lines and puns for every occasion," Tony spoke for the first time in five minutes.
It took him an embarrassingly long time to figure out that many of Tony's past relationships (if you can even call them relationships) weren't very kind to him. His past lovers liked Tony, but not enough to listen to him go off on a tangent on whatever interested him at the time. They preferred when he was quiet and only spoke when spoken to, not when he spoke at speeds too fast to grasp.
"You actually like this person. Steve, is it?" she asks, a teasing lilt to her voice and he rolls his eyes.
Tony sighs but pulls the chair closer to the edge of Steve's bed, then sits, scooting forward until he can lean his elbows onto the bed.
He couldn't help the thrill of pleasure that went through him every time he saw Steve and the small changes his body went through as his pregnancy progressed. There was some carnal surge of possession and lust that flowed through him whenever he saw the tiny bump. Logically, he knew that it was something that he should stop thinking about and get over, but the caveman in him couldn't stop the thrill that he got whenever he touched Steve. Steve was his, and if the baby bump that he sported wasn't enough to show that he had staked a claim on the mouthy blond, then maybe the diamond ring he had in the back of his sock drawer would show the world exactly who Steve belonged to.
"How - What? You're Tony Stark and your idea of someone stalking you is funny? What if I really was stalking you? Huh?
He smiled, walking over to Steve to kiss him on the forehead. "Morning. I got a call from Pepper earlier. I have to catch a flight to Tokyo now and I'll be back in about a week's time. Maybe less if I'm good and get all the paperwork done and the deal goes through. Though we all know how much I hate paperwork, which means that I'll probably be there for the full week. Sorry if I woke you."
And that made every single protective instinct in him flare up.
He needs to get Tony's ankle compressed and elevated.
"Sure, Tasha," he says and she grins, dragging him from the boardroom and to the elevator, which he's ninety percent sure is going to take them to the communal floor's kitchen.
He nodded at the receptionist, and when she sent him a beaming smile and a nod in return he was off. He headed down the hallway leading to the maternity ward, passing a couple of rooms until he reached Steve's private room, and then he knocked, waiting a couple of seconds before sticking his head in.
She apparently had no thoughts of returning to Tony and was understandably frustrated with Tony, considering the fact that he had done the things he did, but she was also surprisingly kind towards Steve. What she had told him left him reeling. It was food for thought. And think he did.
Why did he even phone Steve in the first place? God knows that Pepper was the one he called when he found himself in these sort of situations; she was his emergency contact.
He felt a bit better after, but wasn't totally ready to admit that he would forgive Tony then and there.
Not that said blond was willing to accept his apologies. The blond scowled up at him, hitting his hands away when he tried to help pick up the items lying along the sidewalk.
Despite his previous fears, Steve couldn't be any more lucky than what he currently was; he had a boyfriend who loved him for who he was (no matter how short he was!) and they had a baby on the way.
"Of course it's not one of my flings! How can you ask me that? Have you ever seen one of my flings last
It's pathetic how he's relating to someone who's dead. He hated that he's even sitting here in his lab, drinking stale coffee (why the hell was he sober for this?) and listening to this stupid song in the first place. And really, it's not as if he was the one who 'gave' his love away to anyone.
"Bucky's coming over. He says you better hide. The others don't sound
So he went to his own apartment, taking the elevator to his own floor and wandered around. He wasn't sulking, thank you very much, he was just extremely bored, and his usual confidant didn't want anything to do with him. And then he just so happened to walk past his art studio.
Steve's pallor was pale, far too pale for his liking, really, but Tony didn't think anything was wrong with him.
Tony's eyes fly open and he whines, swatting half-heartedly at Bruce.
He wanted the blond all to himself.
"You two are conspiring against me. See if I don't sell you to a community college, JARVIS. The little rugrats won't appreciate you enough and then you'll regret ever turning against me," Tony said with a sniff.
“Tony, what happened?” he asks. He winces when he listens to the sound of his own voice, hating how it comes out sounding more than a little exasperated and disappointed.
Apparently, it's right on time because their daughter lets out a loud whimper, clenching and unclenching her tiny fingers. Her face screws up and Tony can pinpoint the exact moment that Steve begins to panic.
"Christ, Tony," he says as he takes hold of Tony's ankle, trying to be as gentle as possible. It looks bad, and, judging by how Tony keeps on shying away, it probably hurts just as much.
He raises an eyebrow at Tony who's gone back to pouting at him now. And no, it wasn't fair. Why did Tony always have to make his life so difficult? He just wanted to get Tony out of this godforsaken bathroom and away from the ritzy gala filled to the brim with peroxide blond men and women and glittering jewels that costs more than the clothing he was currently wearing and back to the safety of the tower where he could be examined properly by Bruce.
"Why are you still here?"
In which Sam and Steve have a conversation with feelings and Steve has doubts.
She simply raises an eyebrow at him in a challenge.
Tony turned to kiss him along his jaw. "Love you. And I missed you too. Never going on another business trip again. Pepper will have to go. And if she forces me and threatens me with her high heels I'm making you come with me," Tony said.
"Okay," Tony whispered. He heard Steve give a relieved sigh and what sounded like keys? "I'll be there soon, doll. I promise. Now, I want you to do something for me. Can you do that for me, sweetheart?" Steve asked.
"English, Blue Eyes. I don't speak mumble."
The suit assembled around his body and in less than a minute he felt his head clear significantly and it felt as though he could breathe easier.
It's strange, and yet, he feels as though Steve were made to do this. And the thought strikes a chord deep inside of his consciousness because Steve was told that he could never have this, that he was unable to ever experience something so precious.
It was a wonder that Tony was even standing when he came down to the lab earlier to tell him about supper.
If he was completely honest with himself, he really just enjoys the fact that Tony talks to him. And really, Tony talks enough for the two of them most of the time. Which, when they first started dating, was a massive issue, not because he didn't like Tony talking, but because Tony would start talking to him, babbling and waving his hands in the air when he spoke of something that he was passionate about, only to stop mid-sentence and go completely silent.
He watches Steve flinch, no doubt remembering two years ago when he did the same; left him to die in the cold of a Siberian bunker, his suit a deadweight.
Sure, they get to take her home in two days' time, but it still doesn't sit right.
"Oh, Tony. Doll, I still love you. I haven't stopped. And I'm sorry for everything. I know it doesn't justify anything but I want to make it up to you. I think that we both need to work on our communication skills. Maybe I'll join you in your sessions," Steve said. Tony laughed softly.
Steve
Steve raised an eyebrow, smirking.
"Fine, whatever. Wanna hear what Clint had to say?" Tony asked, giving up on getting Steve to react the way he wanted. It was hard to get a rise out of Steve when the blond wasn't fully paying attention. Or when he knew what you were trying to do. And Steve was oddly good at reading whenever Tony was messing with him.
It's because he's watching Steve that he sees the way Steve closes his eyes tightly and the way that Steve's entire face twists into a look of sadness.
So yes, his therapist did help him a lot. But some problems can't be talked about and hey presto! Everything is sorted. It really can't. And Tony of all people knew that. Sometimes all he wanted to do was to lie in Steve's arms again and just be. No Accords. No therapy. No stupid villain trying to take over the world. Just them.
Now that he realizes it, Tony's silence was probably because of all the pain that he was in, and not because Tony was mad at him or avoiding him and the rest of the team.
He blinks.
Bruce nods. "I think I'll be able to see, yes. And if I do happen to miss anything then we've got JARVIS to help and pick up on it. Although, judging by what you've told me, it seems as though this is just your standard run of the mill drug. Not bad enough to have any bad lingering effects on him, but I have a hunch that it was mixed with a few other drugs as well. Tony's actually really lucky. From what I've seen, this is the tamest effects that someone who's been drugged have ever experienced."
Steve nods surely and Tony grins, bending down until his body was nearly flush with Steve's. "I know, sorry. If it were Bucky or Sam… Well, I know exactly what they'd do if the roles were reversed," Steve says.
He looked Steve in the eyes, glad that the fear he saw there earlier had disappeared and in its place was one of lust.
Which didn't always work because every now and again, one of them would say something without realizing it and the other would flinch.
Next up, Steve and Tony meet up to discuss the "mission" and the long-awaited labor arrives.
He grabbed Steve's chin and tilted it so that Steve was looking at him. "Hey, forget about them. They'll always have an opinion, whether it's right or wrong. Besides, what do they know about my type anyway? I know that I have a thing for smart, mouthy, good-looking blonds who won't think twice before punching me in the face if I say something stupid or even hesitate to put me in my place. No one does that better than you, okay? As for people thinking that you're just after my money, who exactly will say something like that? You refuse to let me pay for dinner or buy you gifts!" Tony exclaims, sounding exasperated.
Tony deflates.
When Steve did talk to him in that boardroom that day, it was in his 'Cap voice', discussing strategies and plans.
Bruce turns around and gathers all the equipment he'll be needing. Tony is now awake once more and is glaring daggers at Bruce, probably for waking him up.
Tony doesn't answer straight away, grabbing a plastic chair that he spied earlier when he entered the room and places it beside the one that Steve's sitting on. He sits down and leans closer so that he can rub a finger gently across the baby's cheek.
He turns back to look at Tony when he hisses in pain, hand hovering inches above his right ankle, which, now that he’s looking at it closer, is swollen and slightly bruised.
I was originally going to break this chapter up because it seemed too long, but then I scrapped the idea.
“Tesoro” is a very popular term of endearment for a loved one, particularly someone with whom you’re in a romantic relationship. It means “treasure,” and is one of the few that remains masculine no matter who is being addressed. It also literally means treasure (as in the thing pirates have), wealth, fortune, or riches. The word “tesoro” can also be used to describe an artistic masterpiece.
"Yeah. Yes, I trust you. Always, Stevie. I'm scared. My head hurts and I don't feel too good. I wanna go sleep," Tony said, slurring slightly. He gripped his head and swayed a bit, about to fall until Steve grabbed him.
He's managed it before, the seven months after their break-up was proof of that. And now that he's suddenly found himself a new parent, his independence was shot to hell. He couldn't allow it to go on any further. Sooner or later the other shoe will drop and Tony will realize that Steve was just another burden that he needed to carry.
He got up and dumped the rest of the disgusting coffee down the sink and stumbled over to his workbench, slumping into his chair and reached blindly for his phone.
When he asks Steve how he's feeling, the blond can only groan in response, turning his face into the pillows.
He lets Steve lead him to bed.
And then he was going to make sure that that piece of scum was going to be locked up for a very, very long time.
"As you wish, Sir, is there anything else you wish to tell them?" JARVIS asked and he chuckled bitterly.
Her lips quirked up slightly and he resisted the urge to smile.
It's as he's drinking from the cup and trying not to burn his tongue as he takes big gulps in his haste to get back down to the medical floor that he realizes that the brew was one that Steve introduced him to.
Rhodey sighs.
Should I have Tony and Pepper talk in the next chapter? Or should I have him and Steve (attempt) to talk about what they should do going forward?
The bell above the door to the café rang as the door opened and he didn't look up.
What if he didn't get to Tony in time?
It basically summed up the entire year after their kiss. Steve couldn't -
Tony's vision blurred and he sobbed. "I just- I miss you, Steve. I can't keep on going on like everybody wants me to," Tony sobbed. "Tony, put Rhodey on the phone. Or Peter," Steve ordered and Tony shook his head even though Steve couldn't see him.
But then he was given a miracle, and he realized that he would do anything to keep her happy and would be more than willing to watch the world burn if something happened to her.
"I said, because I knew you were going to act like this, " Steve muttered, not looking him in the eye.
He doesn't say anything, eyes roaming along Tony's body until he reaches his eyes, searching for some sort of clue that Tony's joking.
In the back of his mind, Tony felt guilty, and then he realized that Dum-E was only a robot and he had more pressing things to deal with.
It's seven in the morning.
"Definitely is a good morning now that you're up. And yeah, I'm up early. Not by choice, though. My space heater up and left me to freeze," Tony said with a slight pout, adding to his overall look of adorable-ness. His hair was disheveled and he looked as if he were still in the process of waking up.
"Okay."
Tony didn't even complain about the long lines, too busy thinking of the next time that he would get to see Steve.
Steve tries to shush her, rocking her gently but it doesn't work and her whimpers get louder.
"I'm not stalking you. I just happen to bump into you all the time. And to be honest, I'm not as upset about the part where you might be stalking me because you are most certainly one of the hottest stalkers I have ever seen."
He puts his hand on the small swell of Steve's belly, and Steve puts his smaller hand over his.
Steve nods slightly.
Tony will be fine.
"I'm sorry. It's— Tonight's just stressful." He pulls Steve closer by the hand, not that Steve had put up a fight against it.
He's eager to get out of the tower.
When he mentions Clint trying to steal Tony’s chinese food and it garners absolutely no look of horror from Tony, the metaphorical alarm bells in the back of his mind start ringing. Because Tony always, always, always has something to say when it’s Clint who’s trying to steal his food. Tony’s lack of outrageous response that he always manages to make, paired with the pale complexion that now fills his form is what makes him do a double take.
Tony was now leaning on him, and seemed comfortable enough that he didn't want to move, and he told Steve that.
Then Tony realized what he needed was someone to talk to. Someone to actually understand him and pour his heart out to. What he needed was professional help. A therapist.
He can feel the beginnings of a smile coming on, and can tell that Steve sees it too because he smiles somewhat shyly, pulling him closer until they were in each others' space.
A part of him was enraged that someone had tried to hurt Tony, had gone to extremes to do whatever unthinkable act they'd thought of to him.
"Probably. But when has time ever stopped Bucky from doing anything he wants to do? Also, I'm pretty sure that now that I'm pregnant, Bucky will be even more annoying than he usually is," Steve said matter-of-factly.
He immediately spots Tony in the centre of the lab, holograms splayed up in the air all around his head.
Steve didn't say anything anything else, turning on his heel and walked out of theout the lab.
Tony laughed and she joined him not long after.
Tony cocks his head to one side, watching him for a couple of beats, and then he straightens up and walks over to Steve.
Except, he couldn't exactly protect and shield Steve from his own head, could he?
So far he's feeling pretty lonely because at least four people in his social circle left for their family's homes. And at least two of those messages sounded as if they were copied and pasted into the conversation before they'd left. So he thinks it's safe to say that maybe they've finally cracked and gotten so annoyed with him that they felt the need to leave.
The thought is enough to spur him on and he gulps down the last few mouthfuls of coffee, hissing as it burns his tongue, and he rushes to grab his cellphone and heads to the penthouse elevator.
Tony thought about it for a minute before nodding. He grabbed the pen and started writing on the given piece of paper. After a minute he was done and sat back with a satisfied smile. His therapist stared at him in shock. Surely he couldn't be writing down all his thoughts and feelings so quickly? Her other patients usually took half an hour to write down one or two feelings or thoughts, but then again, Tony Stark was a special type of patient. He never ceased to amaze her. Or to amuse her. He was the wild card.
"Brucie-bear! Hi! Steve says I have to tell you that I'm not feeling great and I have a headache. He won't let me fall asleep, Bruce. Tell him to let me sleep," Tony whined into the phone.
So he stays silent and lets Steve process things. Allows Steve to see that he really is staying. For good. Nothing, not even Steve's half-hearted attempts at pushing him away will make him stay away from his precious daughter and the bright future she holds the key to.
"It's all part of the recovery process. Depression is a pretty annoying thing to have, not fun, Steve, trust me. Neither is PTSD, my shrink told me I had that too, but if you ask me, it wasn't that hard to self-diagnose after the whole Chitauri attack. From now on, if you have a bad day all you have to do is tell me. For better or for worse, right? I made a promise, and I intend to stick with it. So don't make me seem like a bad husband," Tony joked.
"Thank you, Tony."
"Are you sure you don't want to sleep either? I know you couldn't have slept enough last night," Steve asks, sounding concerned.
He puts the book to one side and pulls out the next item.
There was also the little voice In the back of Tony's mind that reminded him that the position they were currently in was one they've been in multiple times; they used to cuddle a lot when they were dating, either in bed while one was reading or watching tv or on one of the many luxury sofas scattered about the penthouse floor.
Tony went quiet after that, and he could almost feel the way that Tony's eyes bored holes into him from how hard he was staring at him.
Tony blinked and then shook his head.
It's only when someone touches his shoulder that he startles, jumping slightly out of fright and he's nearly too late to stop from punching the person in the face.
"And do you remember Valentine's Day two years ago? Clint was supposed to pick up the cupcakes we ordered and when we opened the box from the bakery, turns out he grabbed the wrong one. We ended up with some poor bachelorette's cupcakes," Tony said, chuckling as he remembered the past events.
Tonight, no matter the fact that he was wearing the blue sweater, was not cold.
They're into their sixth month of dating (two days until their seventh anniversary) when Steve gets sick.
“Shit, that hurts like a bitch. Dum-E, what have I told you about chasing after that damn ball? I said that you were going to trip someone and look what you do, tangle me up in your goddamn wires,” Tony huffs in irritation.
"Of course she knows your voice. You might not have spoken directly to her, but she heard your voice. You carried her for nine - sorry,
Some days he's overcome with a bone-deep tiredness that he knows is from his own sadness and he allows himself to feel it, because he knows that it will disappear eventually. As suddenly as it had crept up on him it's quick to go away and he's able to go on with his day once more.
He wanted to help Steve anyway.
By the time he's done sorting out Tony's ankle, their Chinese food is long cold and the movie with the rest of the team is more than halfway, but at least they got to spend the rest of the night in bed together as they ate supper and watched a movie on the big screen in their room.
A mission that had one objective; protect Tony at all costs.
The landing platform on the roof helped him out of his suit and he couldn't help but shiver. After all, he was only in his flight suit with a pair of jeans thrown over for some form of decency.
They go out a few more times, spending as little as half an hour to as much as two hours together. They aren't dates, just… gatherings. Outings. Two people getting to know each other.
It wasn't good thoughts that plagued his mind, and his hindbrain was more than a little disgusted with the thoughts that he entertained, but his heart was heavy and in the comfort of the dark he wasn't strong enough to dispel the thoughts that maybe if he'd found a way to get Howard on the line, then maybe he'd still be with the rest of his friends and family in the forties.
"Hey, JARVIS, do Daddy a favour and reply the footage from last night. All of it, don't skip or fast forward anything," he says and closes his eyes, mentally preparing himself for what he was about to see.
He doesn't break Steve's gaze.
and experienced feelings like a normal human being. For him, it was easier if he suppressed them and ignored their existence. It was mainly due to past experiences - ones he wasn't prepared to delve into - but something about the way Doctor Mikhailov looked at him, as if he wasn't 'Mr. Anthony Edward Stark: CEO of Fortune 500 company, Stark Industries' but rather plain, old Tony Stark. Just a guy who messed around with cars in his free time and preferred talking to his 'bots than to people. A regular guy with problems like everyone else.
Steve took his phone and inserted his number, handing it back as soon as he was done with a smile. Their fingers brushed and Tony noticed how Steve flushed, turning his head away slightly.
They make their way to the kitchen and Natasha starts pulling out various items.
"Sir, the lab will remain unlocked until you and Captain Rogers talk to one another," the A.I. tells him, sounding extremely self-assured and more than a little smug.
Which, is to say that he knows Tony quite well.
When the brunet finally moved, it was sudden, and he pulled Steve impossibly closer to him, his hands finding their way into Steve's hair and his lips meeting Steve's in a chaste kiss.
Steve placed the box of donuts they had gotten from the bakery on the way home on the table, then loosened his tie. He could hear Tony already flicking through the movies on Netflix from where the brunet sat on the sofa, providing unnecessary commentary on each one that he flipped past.
Hi everyone! I apologize for the five month long wait but school and exams are hectic at the moment. Thankfully, I only have two and a half months left until I am FINISHED! I thank each and every one of you for your patience while I sort my life out and try and work on writing this fic in what little free time I have❤️
Tony wasn't one for explaining his feelings, or even accepting the fact that he
"Bruce made hot chocolate for everyone. He said that we needed a change of scene and that he was tired of everyone sipping on coffee and soda when we watched a movie. You missed out."
The restaurant was quaint and gave off a feeling of warmth; there was soft music playing from hidden speakers and the candlelight gave the place a romantic feel. Given that it was Valentine's day, it was to be expected.
Tony flounders for a minute before he glares at Steve, pushing his sunglasses on top of his head.
It's - okay, see, it's like this: Steve is in love with Tony. Literally every inch of Tony.
"Tony…" When Steve said his name it sounded like an exhausted sigh.
Unless, of course, it interfered with the team.
And really, it's not like he needed the doctor to tell him that he needed to help Steve.
She was so tiny.
He frowned when Steve stopped, turning around again.
And so, as with everything, Steve loves the fact that he is the only one who gets to see Tony first thing in the morning. He loves seeing Tony wake up next to him, all sleepy soft and hair product-free, curls mussed and hanging over his eyes. He makes sure to have a pot of coffee already made and a mug waiting on the marble kitchen counter after his run for whenever Tony decides to stumble out of bed.
He cleared his throat. "Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I tell Cupid to shoot you with that arrow one more time?" Tony read. He looked up at Steve, waiting for a reaction.
Tony had promised himself that he would be the best father he could possibly be to his daughter. And yes, she was unplanned, but that didn't mean she wouldn't be loved or cared for. In fact, he loved her the moment he first laid eyes on her.
Neither of them has anything to say, both enthralled at the sight of their daughter.
Natasha, true to her words, doesn't push him. But she does question him.
He's quick to look down again, not wanting to miss anything now that his daughter is in his arms.
He knows how exhausted Steve must be, especially after the grueling labor, then having to deal with the fact that their daughter wasn't breathing properly. It was enough to put stress on anyone else, and coupled with the fact that Tony
He scowled glaring at the nearest camera he could find and hoped that JARVIS got the message.
He settles in the bed, allowing Tony to help him get comfortable. No matter what position he's in, it's difficult for him to settle in properly and when he shifts, he can't help wincing when he moves too fast, feeling the tenderness in his lower half that hasn't disappeared yet.
Tony shrugs the questions off again and doesn’t answer him, just turns back to his floating holograms.
He felt bad when he felt Tony flinch slightly, moving away from him, but Tony was headstrong and stubborn and didn't let him scare him away.
"Tony, Bruce is waiting for us at the tower, okay? He's waiting for you. And then you can sleep. But first, we have to leave the bathroom. I'm going to walk with you out of the door, and we're going to head to my car that's parked outside." He hopes that Tony understands what he's saying. He just wants to leave the stupid gala already.
Steve must’ve sensed that he's really sorry because he inches forward slowly, taking Tony's hand in his own.
"Maybe I felt sorry for you and that's why I decided to do a favor for everyone else who had to listen to your pick-up lines," Steve teased.
For what he didn't know, but he didn't have time to ask because she was already gone, heels clacking on the way out of the gym.
"That was pretty funny," Steve laughed, shaking his head at Clint's ridiculous antics.
Steve nods tentatively, biting on his bottom lip unsurely.
Tony questioned, his voice cracking on the last word.
And Tony's greatest weakness, other than his penchant for self-sabotage, was -
, but still."
But he's not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, and he's soon standing next to where Tony had huddled himself into a corner of the bathroom, trying to hide away from whatever person was 'coming after him'.
Nothing worked.
He felt as if he were being tugged into two; half of him wanted to climb into bed and forget the whole ordeal and the other half wanted to stay until Tony woke up.
"Okay, I know this isn't exactly what you want, but it's better than the alternative, which would be us packing a bag for our daughter at the end of each week so that that other gets to keep her when it's their chance. And there's also the fact that Pepper already had people see things up in the penthouse. Do you want to move everything to your floor? Because then we need to order duplicates of everything so when she stays with either of us she's comfortable. And if it's not that what's bothering you and simply the fact that staying at the penthouse with me is what makes you
Tony moves forward until he's leaning halfway out of his seat, then moves to tuck the blankets around Steve properly.
So why the hell was he feeling this way? If anything, the one who should be as upset about this whole clusterfuck should be Steve, since he was the one who had his heart rejected and then stomped on.
The doors close and he grabs the two coffees, heading back to the bedroom.
Don't forget to leave comments and kudos! Tell me what you guys think, I love feedback!
It's incredibly thoughtful of her. Steve knows how difficult it must be for her because of his break-up with Tony. Of course, she wasn't rude or on an obvious side, Pepper was never like that, but he can't help but feel that a baby has just made things even more difficult. They hadn't planned this and he knew that Pepper liked things to be planned out, especially since she had to work so hard at the company. Of course, working for Tony is hard enough as it is, but when you're running his company Steve can only imagine just how much harder it is. Add the fact that Tony was now a new parent, well, things would be much, much more difficult.
And nothing was going to stop him.
As in, he'd bumped into Steve so hard that Steve fell to the floor and all his belongings scattered everywhere.
"I don't know… that's a really good one. Remember the sentient toaster? You were bordering on manic by the time I found you and muttering about increasing the speed of a slinky. Those were two things I never thought I'd see, much less hear. But then the toaster made toast by itself and all but blew up in Thor's face when he tried to put a pop tart in, so all in all, not the
"You do that. In the mean time, breakfast?" Steve asked.
"Okay, to be fair, Rhodey and Pepper are extremely protective, you know how they can be. And I explained to Pepper that you weren't after my money! She even apologized. Come on, I've never seen Pepper look that mortified in all the time she's worked for me."
He smiles, and he's surprised to note that it's a genuine one this time, not one he's had to force.
He doesn't understand why Stone would admit to drugging Tony. Why even drug Tony in the first place?
God, Steve had the patient of a saint. He needed to apologise.
Steve couldn't help the smile that tugged at his lips. Tony had said yes. He'd said yes to marrying him and to building a life together. He was absolutely giddy at the thought of it.
It was all part of the healing process. A road that they were traveling. Together. And that's all that mattered.
"She's wishing us well for the future. Am I right?" Steve asked.
"Give me a break, Tony! Why are you suddenly so obsessed with what Sharon has to do with me? Yes, I went out to dinner with her tonight. Does it concern you? No. Is it my business? Yes. Back. Off."
They panic about it for a while, Steve maybe more than him, although he has his own fears, but they calm down soon enough.
It's not highly unusual that he's hidden himself away in the lab under the guise of needing to finish up a few pressing designs for the new StarkPhone. He snickers when he realizes that he's lying to himself again. Who is he kidding? He finished those designs a month ago, and was already working on the upgrades for the 'new' StarkPhone.
It's quiet again, but the silence between them isn't tense, it's relaxed.
Any other time he would've laughed at the way Tony's eyes widened in shock and the look of surprise on his face, but this wasn't the right time or place for that.
And, because he was a masochist and a sucker for pain, he agreed to go with.
Which Tony wasn't supposed to know about but he did. Tony's therapist had helped him a lot, but not everything was fixed. He still felt torn in between running after Steve and dragging him back home to live with him and Peter to staring into space, thinking of how Steve hurt him. And it hurt because he loved Steve and getting hurt by the ones you love was the worst way to get hurt.
Despite the sombre mood, he finds himself letting loose a chuckle.
"I love you too, Tony. And I'm so sorry for hurting you," he says.
They both know he isn't just talking about the work for SI, but rather what happened in Siberia and Steve's little time away in Wakanda with the rest of the team.
He actually liked Steve.
"Tony," he finds himself sighing, "They aren't going to come back, you're safe here in the tower. Bruce and JARVIS are watching over you, okay? You'll be fine. Just go to sleep."
He thinks he's done a good job of ignoring Tony so far but the man has to ruin it for him, stepping into his space and grimacing at his hands.
"Is that a no to dinner, then?" Steve raised an eyebrow, choosing to ignore Tony's questions and answering with one of his own. He knew that Tony wouldn't say no to him.
The glass panel that doubled as a large window slid open and he flew out.
And for the first time since Steve left, Tony was sure of himself. He didn't have this feeling of being vulnerable. Not the way he was before. He was sure of himself.
He took a deep breath and exhaled, then walked to the kitchen, heading straight for the coffee machine and hoped that Steve and Barnes didn't notice him.
"I love you, too," he whispered, closing his eyes as he leaned his head on Tony's shoulder.
Exactly his type.
Tony cracks a tiny grin, hugging Steve to him.
He steps back, feeling as though he's not needed, and keeps to the side, content to just be standing there watching over Tony.
Really obvious one but something I feel the need to point out, is that Mama Rosa is an original character. I just needed a mother-figure that's kind've close to Tony and that will help provide some insight as to why Tony is the way he is and she kinda just popped into my head.
Don't forget to leave kudos and comments! I'd love to hear what you all think!
yes, it sucks that our daughter needs to stay an extra night when we get to go home, but you didn't know. You didn't know you could even fall pregnant, that this was possible. But soon she'll be able to come home. None of this was planned, and absolutely
He feels a blush working its way across his face and although he wants to laugh and shrug it off, he knows it's true. It makes him uncomfortable that people who would have never ever looked at him that way before will suddenly stop in the middle of the sidewalk to look at him now. And although he was in a relationship with Tony -  who was completely and utterly shameless - he still found that he didn't believe that people could honestly like someone like him, and the thought made him uneasy and uncomfortable.
"No," Tony growled, scowling a little and he felt his heart beat faster. Tony Stark was going to be the death of him. And he couldn't even find it in himself to be mad at the man!
Steve didn't even have a chance to hit the sack after the mission and was in labor for most of the day, it's understandable that he'd be asleep for some time still.
"Uh, hi. Question. Were you here all night? Because if you were, that would be a serious problem," Tony says in lieu of greeting.
He shuts his eyes tightly and takes a controlled breath.
Tony puts a finger under his chin and forces Steve to look at him. When he kisses Steve, it feels like everything is right again. Steve's lips are soft against his, their mouths slotting together perfectly like they belonged together.
So seeing Steve all broken up and a sobbing mess was something that made some part of him want to grab Steve into his arms and shield him from whatever was hurting him. He wanted to protect Steve.
"And then there's this one: 'You’re like a Valentine’s candy bar: half sweet and half nuts.' I don't know whether to laugh or to be offended that he's indirectly calling me crazy." Tony sounded half put out and half confused.
As soon as they entered the foyer, someone was there to greet them with a smile.
He was extremely annoyed and more than a little frustrated that Tony was messing around and calling him, more so because he'd just sat down and was currently busy painting, something which he rarely had time to do, and when he did, there was a distinct lack of inspiration. He'd told Tony so, ready to slam the phone down in Tony's face because he was sick of the way Tony was going on, except he'd heard the desperation in Tony's voice when he asked him to pick him up. And something obviously wasn't right, because Tony Stark didn't beg. And he also didn't ask for help.
"You - What? You're not supposed to talk to the person who pays your salary like this! Blasphemy! I will not stand for it," he whined.
He's definitely not pouting as Rhodey drags him to the bank and he's definitely not groaning at the injustice of it all. He and Rhodey were supposed to spend the day together, maybe go out and get some food and then go back to the tower and binge watch some of their favorite movies. Instead, they were going to the bank. On a Saturday!
One hand pulled Steve closer and he moved, pulling and flipping them over so that he was at the bottom and Steve was on top of him. Their kisses were less frantic now, going slower as they explored each other's mouths. One hand was tangled in Steve's hair and the other was resting on the small bump.
Tony heaved a great sigh but put his phone away, turning it off and turning it face down so that he could eat his breakfast.
When he's done explaining the situation to Pepper, and after her face has finally gone back to normal, she notices what he was trying to do and a smile grows on her face.
Steve's heart broke at how distressed Tony was and he didn't even hesitate before pulling Tony close to him, wrapping his arms around his smaller, shaking frame.
He's ready to ream them a new one, seriously, because he was
He suspects the sight of various wires that are connected to their daughter only added to Steve's nerves, but then their daughter is being placed into his waiting arms, and Steve just… calms down.
That had predictably settled
Tony raised an eyebrow and then looked back at whatever message Clint had left on his cellphone.
thing Clint can call you," Steve replied, moving to sit at one of the bar stools at the counter. By now he was fully invested in teasing Tony and playing innocent until Tony realized that he was being messed with.
Steve couldn't help laugh at Tony's dramatic antics. He threaded his hands through Tony's tousled curls, reveling in its softness; Tony had let his hair grow slightly longer than usual and now it just reached the nape of his neck, curling slightly at the ends. He loved how Tony's hair looked without all the products he insisted on using.
This was the Tony that he was in love with. But it's also the Tony that he could never have.
"So do you. I seem to remember a few instances where you had absolutely no shame in using your horrible pick-up lines on me," Steve said after a brief pause.
He thanks god or whoever decided to answer his prayers when Steve turns his head, glancing at him.
Of course he loves Tony. He couldn't imagine not loving Tony.
He's surprised to note that it was one of the few times that Tony had looked at him,
But that surge of guilt was wiped out at the thought of Tony.
His internal monologue is interrupted when Tony speaks. Even to Steve's ears it sounds dull.
"I - "
All too soon the peace is disrupted when their daughter whimpers in Steve's hold.
Translations:
He sighs, because what else was he supposed to do? This is exactly what he should be used to; Tony always refused to admit when he was hurt and would to try his absolute best to escape medical. Whenever he landed up in hospital, which was a rare occurrence, Tony always signed himself out, much to Rhodey, Pepper and his chagrin.
"Yes! Yes, yes, yes! You didn't even have to ask, babe, I'm a sure thing," Tony exclaimed.
"What. Did. You. Do. To. Tony" he grits out. He wasn't going to stand around and pretend to be interested in what this piece of scum had to say about Tony. He wasn't interested in his fabricated lies either.
The silence stretched between them, and for a while, neither of them made any move to say anything or to ask any more awkward questions.
He was jolted out of his fitful sleep when a hand brushed gently through his hair.
Okay, so this was out of his comfort zone, and he was doing that thing where he spoke too fast and rambled, but he'd like to think that he'd made his intentions - and his
"Have you found something to watch or are you still criticizing everything you see?" Steve asked.
"Sorry? JARVIS, just open the doors! You can't tell me what to do," he says, beginning to get annoyed.
He loved the Tony who smiled widely, who gave real smiles and not smiles that were fake and razor sharp like those likened to those of a shark. Tony's fake smiles were made of plastic, so hard and brittle that he was afraid that Tony would crack, but Tony surprised him time and time again whenever he happened to be watching Tony interact with an overexcited journalist who didn't know their boundaries, those smiles were tailored specifically for journalists like that, his smile predatory sarcastic.
Tony made a noise of sympathy. "That's normal, though. You'll be sore for a bit, but hopefully, the serum will kick in soon and you'll be back to normal in no time."
They were partially through the first episode when Steve's cellphone rang.
Bruce smiles amusedly and shakes his head at Tony's antics.
Bruce congratulated them quietly and Natasha practically squealed. Rhodey and Pepper had huge smiles on their faces, each of them happy for the couple.
= Tony! I haven't seen you in so long? Are you so busy that you don't have time to visit me anymore?
isn't completely better. In both mental and physical aspects, but I have yet to hear how you yourself are coping. I understand that this is new territory and it can be difficult to navigate, so how are you feeling?" she asks.
"It's nothing special, Stark," two can play at that game. Tony wanted to pretend that everything was fine and whatever they had before didn't exist, he could do it too. "Anyone from the team would've done the same. We care about one another. We work together and have to have each other's backs. That's what being part of a team is about."
Rhodey wasn't even trying to hide the fact that he had been eavesdropping, grinning knowingly at Tony. He punched him on the arm and Tony struggled to contain the smile that was tugging at his mouth.
He's pretty sure that the super-soldier would wake soon, and he wanted to be there so that Steve wouldn't immediately think the worst; that he wasn't interested in their daughter or that he simply didn't care enough to stay.
"Hey! Look at me, Stark. No one is coming through that door, okay? I won't let them. Do you trust me?" he asked, gripping Tony's chin until Tony was looking at him.
"Actually, Steve and I were goin' to head out to this little café I found a couple 'a days ago. We were gonna leave afta the movie but why don't you come with us? They have great coffee," Barnes said, looking to Steve for confirmation.
And that's when the other shoe drops.
"Cheeky. Just you see, Fri, keep it up and I will take you apart and send you to a community college. Preferably some government college, and not the private ones. See how much you like that," he mock-threatened.
And wasn't that the crux of the matter?
It wasn't even that he cheated on Tony, because what he and Sharon had going on was nothing romantic and completely platonic, except Tony didn't know that. He just played it off as if he and Sharon were together. Not very well, though, since Tony standing in the lab shouting at him was all it took to get him to feel guilty. But Tony had to at least acknowledge the fact that what he was doing to him was wrong too. He was getting sick of them just sleeping together and then Tony telling him after that he and Pepper were just in a break. He was beginning to feel used. And, if you don't count his pride, it was really beginning to hurt him too, especially since he had started to develop feeling for the tower's resident genius.
The fact that she was painting her toenails crimson was definitely an obvious show of the state of mind she was in, which was the one where she was extremely close to either strangling someone, or killing them and hiding the body so that nobody could find the remains. Also, she had just
"She knows your voice, Cap," Tony speaks up and Steve's head shoots up and he gives Tony an unsure smile.
His heart aches seeing Steve like this, especially when his efforts at reassuring Steve that this wasn't his fault was failing drastically.
"Nevermind. Friday then? I really need to go now, Tony. I'm going to be late and my friends - Bucky is going to be mad at me because I'm late again, " Steve sounded regretful and more than a little disappointed and Tony felt a warm rush of pleasure flow through his body.
He clears his throat and Bruce jumps, and then relaxes when he realises that it's him. He puts his textbook down on the table beside him and stands, walking towards them.
He knows that the issue with his parents' death needs to be approached. He also knows that it can be put on hold until tomorrow, or the day after, until the Christmas celebration was over.
"Tony, we're not -"
"I didn't hear you complaining when you said that candy hearts were your favorite," Steve shot back.
"Tony, it's not that. I - nevermind. You're right."
"Steve. Steve Rogers. Look, I really need to be going and I don't have time to talk, so if you could kindly pass the rest of my stuff?" He gestures to the rest that Tony's holding and Tony felt slightly embarrassed.
"Tell me about it. Tony just wanted to sleep," he says and Bruce laughs.
Steve shakes his head, stubborn.
Anyway, KUDOS AND COMMENTS mean *LOVE*.  And I love you all so please leave some behind on this chapter! 🙈❤️
"What?" Steve asks.
Tony turned to the screen and cleared his throat. "I said yes, by the way."
"I thought so. You have no right to tell me what to do when you were the one who planned to do the same thing to me."
"She forgot the lid thing," Tony said, sounding confused. Steve shrugged his shoulders, sipping at his wine as he watched Tony lift the lid off his plate. The brunet frowned for a second and then his features evened out, confusion leading to a tiny grin.
Steve didn't exactly sound enthusiastic.
"Do you want me to go check if I can find Doctor Mikhailov? I can ask her if you're allowed to see the baby," he said.
Tony raised an eyebrow, mouth downturned in a frown.
Dammit.
She was right, like she always was, not that he was willing to say it to her face, of course. But he was willing to bet his entire fortune on the fact that she knew just how right she was whenever she ended up warning him about something.
They chose a table near the window and sat down, Steve on one side and Barnes, surprisingly, sat down next to him.
"You're so warm. And - and comfortable. I don't want to move. Can I lie on you? Then I can fall asleep," Tony whispered, almost as if he were telling Steve a secret.
It's almost amusing to see when Tony startles, causing his hand to wave the holograms away before whirling around to face him. Almost.
"You are indeed correct, Sir. In France we like to say a simple congratulations and give our blessings to the newly engaged couple. What I said was that I hope you will make each other extremely happy."
He couldn't look at their confused faces, focused solely on getting out of the café that seemed as if it was closing in on him.
And then there was the deal with the burner phone. God, that old piece of tech was a sight for sore eyes. But it made some part of his heart warm again at the thought that it was from Steve. That Steve still wanted to talk to him.
And if he benefited from the close contact as well, if the familiar smell of Steve and the heat that radiated from Steve's body was a balm that soothed him like no other, he wasn't about to deny himself that little pleasure.
When he finally found out who it was, he was beyond mad. He saw red.
"Are you going to stand there all night or are you going to watch with me?" Tony called out. Steve shook his head with a light, stepping out of the kitchen area and heading to the sofa where Tony cuddled up to him as soon as he sat down.
"I went to a shrink," Tony said, finally calm, chest no longer heaving with sobs.
Maybe it wasn't such a great idea that the lab was beneath the common room.
"I am
Bruce seems to see his inner turmoil and sends him a small smile. "Don't worry, Steve. I can still check. All I need is a sample of Tony's blood. Hopefully JARVIS will be able to help me pick up on whatever is lingering in his bloodstream. Thank God you called me when you did, because if Tony came home and we only picked it up tomorrow morning, it would be too late. We'd hardly be able to pick up on whatever's on his bloodstream," Bruce said.
He kept his movements careful and hoped that they wouldn't see how his hands had started to shake.
"Wait, really?" Tony asks and Steve rolls his eyes.
"As you wish. Will that be all, Mr. Stark?" she asks, holding her hand out to stop the doors from closing behind her.
Tony grinned, watching Steve walk away, a tiny spring in his step.
His heart skips a beat and he struggled to keep his face straight, not wanting to  showi Tony how much those words really affect him.
His skin looks almost ashen in the artificial light of the lab and although the lights in the lab are probably only making it look more severe, Tony doesn't look… great, for lack of better words.
"What?" he asks.
He still looked tired and there were circles under his eyes, making them look bruised. He supposed Steve would look tired for a while, he
He hates that he was the one to put that hurt there.
He swallowed thickly, smiling at Steve. "Yeah. Fine."
, think of it as being roommates. I won't bother you, and I'll stick to my half of the penthouse. You won't even know I'm there. You won't see or hear anything from me. Promise," Tony said.
Tony chuckled. On screen, everyone was still arguing about whether or not Tony said yes. Although it was pretty obvious judging by the huge smile on the brunet's face. And by the ring sitting innocently on his finger.
of this is your fault. Do you believe me now?"
What's the point of having an A.I if they were just going to go against you and be disobedient?
It wasn't even all that difficult to look Tony in the eye and grab the dossier from him. So long as he's got something to keep him busy then he's happy.
It's weird to think that a stranger that he's never spent more than five minutes with really cares about his well-being. And hearing Steve scold him about joking about his life and the possibility of someone stalking him makes him uncomfortable. He doesn't know what to do with himself.
Tony gasped, small sobs still escaping. "O- okay," Tony said, voice raw. "Good. Now, I want you to get back into bed and lay down, okay? You don't have to fall asleep if you don't want to. We can talk until you do fall asleep. Tell me about your day. What did you do today?" Steve asked. His voice sounded slightly breathless and Tony could still hear sounds in the background.
Seeing Steve like this is strange, rare. But he knows that beyond Steve's confident persona and the way he holds himself, he's the type of person to hold his heart on his sleeve. He's shy and insecure. And this situation seemed to bring all of the qualities that Steve tried to hide out into the light.
She left and returned with their coffees, leaving them with another smile and a request to call her if they wanted anything else.
Natasha scowls and shrugs his hand off.
He rolled his eyes and snorted, too busy drawing patterns on Tony's forearm to reply verbally.
And lonely. God is he lonely.
"No - I - no. I miss you, Steve. So much," Tony said, "I don't want them. I need you, Steve," Tony choked on a sob.
And Tony couldn't remember the last time he felt this calm. Even after his numerous therapy sessions, he still felt slightly restless. Like an itch that won't go away, under his skin. Listening to Steve was quiet. He could relax. No rushing from one place to the other. No working on new updates for the team. Just calm. So he told Steve everything.
Even without Rhodey telling her about the not quite date, they had spent so much time together that it was clear to her that Tony honestly loved him, and had somehow, however unconsciously, had no plans on getting back together with her. Which she respected, because she loved Tony and wanted the best for him. She'd also realised that she and Tony would be better off as friends.
He turns around and is ready to defend Tony should the need arise when he sees just who is standing by his car.
He points a screwdriver at DUM-E who whirs sadly, claw dropping at the obvious chastisement from his father figure.
"Let me ask you again. How much have you slept since I was gone, Steve? And don't change the subject this time."
But Steve doesn't let the doctor's orders slow him down. Usually, he'd protest against something like that, saying that he was fine and that he could walk and that they should save the wheelchair for someone who really needed it. And for Tony, witnessing Steve give in so easily, it's a testimony for how much Steve must still be in pain.
To be fair, it was kind of confusing for the team to wake up and hear the sounds of their two leaders arguing. Not that the arguing was unusual. It wasn't, actually. Steve and Tony fought constantly.
The conversation between them was light, and when it seemed like he couldn't possibly talk anymore, Barnes intervened, telling them about all the stupid things he's walked in on Sam and Clint doing.
It's only after Steve has completely disappeared out of his line of sight that he realizes he never even got to ask the man for his number, much less had time to slip his number between Steve's belongings.
"Okay, Tony -"
Steve's eyes were red and sad when he connected them with Tony's.
*****
Tony seems to pick up on it because the previous look of openness that he so easily displayed since stepping into the nursery immediately falls away.
He picked up a leather-bound book and handed it to the blond, interest piqued when he noticed a piece of paper with a charcoal drawing sticking out of it. The blond snatched it from him, giving him a snarky
"No - no, I know that he's out there. He's -" Tony hiccuped, "He's out there, waiting for me to come out. Steve, tell him to go away!" Tony said hysterically.
"I think I'm going to get some sleep. Don't forget to rest, Bruce. You need sleep as well," he says, even though his words are hollow and empty. He doesn't need to sleep. He's not tired. But he knows that it's a lost cause and he should just leave it at that.
"You should've seen your face! Priceless! Okay, fine. What happens if I agree to this dinner of yours? Are you going to stop stalking me?" Steve asks seriously.
He's so busy staring at Steve that he almost misses Steve accepting. From the smirk on Steve's face, he noticed it as well but wasn't going to say anything.
Tony's asleep in his arms and he has no doubt about it that if Tony were awake, he'd be pretty mortified to hear that Steve had carried him in a bridal carry.
"You were asleep. And I wanted a bit of silence," Steve settles on saying. There's a lot missing from the sentence, such as
He can't help but chuckle bitterly, taking another swig of coffee from the pot. It was cold but he was too lazy to get up and fix another pot.
"Steve, honey, look at me. Yeah, there are those pretty eyes. I love you, okay -"
"Uh, sorry, sir. The cheque, Mr. Stark, " the waiter said, handing Tony the cheque and his card without looking him in the eye and walking away briskly.
again or not? There's also
In his hands is a book with a hard cover, with the words 'Baby's firsts' written on it and underneath a blank space where he assumes a picture of Morgan is meant to be placed.
Friends go out together. And he and Steve have long ago passed the 'strangers who keep on running into each other stage' and ventured into the 'friends who sometimes go out together for coffee' stage.
“Steve, it’s fine. Just- go upstairs and make sure that Barton doesn’t get his grimy paws on my chinese food. God, he’s like a freaking vacuum when it comes to food,” Tony says. The last part is muttered under his breath, but he hears it anyway due to his keen sense of hearing.
