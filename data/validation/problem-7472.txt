“I ran,” Steve answers sheepishly.
“She’s really warm,” Steve says to the others.
Tony take the empty glass in his hand and throws it at the wall. The two of them watch it shatters into pieces. Steve flinches and prepares himself to be yelled at, but instead Tony softened a bit. Steve likes to think he used to have a pretty good handle on Tony’s moods, but right now he can’t figure him out at all.
“Please don’t leave us here,” he hears one of the doctors cry out.
“I don’t feel good. I’m sleepy,” says manages to get out between yawns.
“No, first we have to prepare her to receive it. We have two give her a form of chemotherapy,” Shuri explains.
“Ha!” Tony laughs bitterly. “The only person who destroyed us is you. YOU! You put all of this in motion. It would be so easy for you to just lay the blame on someone else, but you ruined this. We had our problems, but you! You put the nail in the coffin. And yeah maybe someone is working against you and deleted the message. But none of that matters because nothing will change what you did to me. And if you’re serious and you want to be a part of Maria’s life. If you truly want to be a father to her than prove it.”
“You are being so selfish! He could help her! He could save her! Your fear is going to cost you a daughter! Why don’t you see that? I cannot, I will not lose my sister. If you don’t speak to him then I will!” Steve’s never heard such anger in her voice.
“JEEZ TONY!” Steve says turning away. “Stop, I get it okay.”
“Tell me I’m the coolest!”
Steve looks at him in shock but does his best to recover from this slap of information. He looks at Alana, she’s unfazed. Okay, so they both know. He shouldn’t be surprised.
He’s about to call it quits and leave when he hears an honest to goodness laugh come out of Tony’s mouth. A real genuine laugh. He looks up at Tony in confusion.
He knows Bone Marrow, he's heard it before. What he doesn’t know is how a sample of it is taken, or from where. Not that it matters to him. He’ll do anything to save her. He’d give up his life if it meant she’d live.
Tony rolls his eyes and sighs. “You can’t still be this naive!” Tony walks over to Steve and flicks him in the head. “Think Steve! You can’t just waltz into the hospital and say hi I’m Maria’s other biological parent.”
Scott gives Tony a confused look, questioning why he’s getting roasted in the middle of his lecture.
“Do you really think I would ignore you? I gave you that phone because I was too much of a coward to admit that I was wrong and that I missed you,” Steve pleads. “I was scared that you’d tell me to get lost. I couldn't handle that. All I’ve wanted is you Tony. Do you really think that I could that? Ignore you? Let alone all of this, Maria?”
“Thanks, Sam.”
“You left your bike by the hospital. Look for a street sign or something. I’ll come to get you.”
“I’m sorry to do this, I just wanted a minute alone with you,” Steve tries to explain.
Maria is completely oblivious to the tension that settles in the room, only acknowledging the sound of her own name. Apparently, raising children is a hot subject.
“Thanks.”
Tony gently questions her as he gives her a bath and Maria tells him tales of her adventures through wild jungles and enchanted forests with Steve, the sidekick to her heroine. He’s torn between wanting to beat the ever-loving crap out of Steve and the thought that maybe Maria deserves to have any kind of happy memory associated with Steve. From what he gathers from Maria, Steve never attempts to tell her who he is, and at the very least, he’s grateful to Steve for that. But it all makes him nervous. He can’t figure out what Steve wants from them.
The fire alarms turn off and the sprinklers stop. Steve walks over to a cabinet filled with different bottles. He pulls them out at random and throws them around the room. He reaches into his jacket and pulls out a Zippo lighter he found at Tony’s and flicks it open. He watches fear spread across the doctors’ faces as he drops the lit lighter onto the floor. The room is instantly engulfed in flames. The doctors start to shout for help. It a chorus of desperate cries, but Steve feels nothing. He walks out of the room and makes his way towards the elevators. The doctors barge out the door behind him.
Steve gets up and runs out of the room. He has the phone. He never could bring himself to get rid of it. It’s a way for him to torture himself. He pulls it out of the bag and runs back to Tony. When he gets back to the room he finds Tony sitting on the edge of the bed with his head in his hands.
“Chemo…therapy?” Steve says in confusion. “Isn’t that radiation? Won’t that kill her?” Steve’s horrified.
“That’s probably because of Steve,” Tony says. “He’s her father.”
“I’m fine, I can stay,” Steve says regardless of the fact he could really use a shower.
“You wanna talk about it?"
“She needs bone marrow.”
This isn’t the line of conversation he’d been expecting, the truth is Steve is concerned. He did want to know more. He’s had a terrible knot forming in his stomach that only got worse with each passing day. But this feels wrong. He feels like somehow Tony is leading into dangerous territory. Steve sighs, all their conversations are littered with land mines.
“Yeah,” Steve fibs, really it’s only a half lie. He enjoyed seeing everyone, spending time together, even though some of them were missing. He just wishes that things were different between him and Tony.
“She never would have made it out of utero. She’s almost four,” Tony adds. He sounds hopeful.
“Tony?”
He makes his way up the stairwell to the floor he knows the doctors have taken over. He walks onto the floor and snaps the handle of the door before he pulls the fire alarm. Then he pushes the button and the lights go out, just like Tony said they would. There’s water streaming down all around him. The doctors come out of the room and immediately rush back in at the sight of Steve lumbering down the hall, soaking wet.

For the first time, being with Tony, being loved, put Steve at ease. Then of course, once he realized how he felt the doubt, the shame, and guilt took over. Who ever would have thought, the great Captain America, was a self-sabotager. It was easy at first, to let Tony shoulder all the blame. When everything went down hill Steve simply stepped back and allowed everyone’s assumptions about Tony prevail. Steve had always believe that God had a plan for everyone. He also believes that God didn’t give directions. He lays out the destination and send you on your way without a map; and boy what a mess he made. Taking the long way there is an understatement. He wonders if he’s even on the right path anymore.
“Seriously? How the hell did you end up in Queens?”
“Oh,” Tony says, slightly less suspicious.
“What happens if we irradiate her and it doesn’t work? What if we lower her immune system and she doesn’t get better? We’ll be helping the virus kill her faster!”
Steve stands there with no reaction on his face, where Peter looks between them like a bomb was about to go off.
“I wish I could say something more than I am sorry,” she says with anxiety spread across her face. Tony takes her hands in his.
Steve is beyond control. The dam has broken and the tears are running down his face. He can feel the mucus from his nose beginning to run down his face but he can’t bring himself to care.
No matter what he fucking did everything always led back to Steve. Since Steve’s return, Tony’s mood has exponentially soured. He knew having Steve back in his home would be difficult, but what he didn’t anticipate was the extent. Having Steve near again is like being dunked and pulled from a river of ice. The first night, the night of the party, the very sight of Steve makes Tony weak and that weakness has been gaining power since. The desire hasn’t faded, but now it’s mixed with disappointment, fear, and such fiery hatred that it actually scares him.
“For what?”
“I CARRIED HER INSIDE ME! FOR NINE MONTHS WE WERE ONE! I’M HER FATHER! ME!”
“PAPA!,” they hear Maria cry from the dining room. “PAPA, WE HAVE PANCAKES!” It’s followed by a squeal of unbridled joy that brings a smile to all their faces. Tony, however, looks horrified.
“Papa has sad eyes,” she finishes before her sniffles turn into full-fledged tears. Steve feels a deep swelling pain through his whole body. Every part of him is screaming to find out why, but he’s not stupid enough to drag her into their mess.
Tony’s left alone, with their daughter, to figure out how to get her out of the hospital. Their daughter.  It’s strange to think of Maria as theirs. Tony has had sole claim to her for so long he never thought it was possible to ever give Steve a share, but it feels right. She is theirs and if the world is going to find out, well they’re going be sure as hell that everyone knows exactly what’s waiting for them if anyone tries to hurt her.
“You are so strong. I know you are because you have the best parts of us in you,” Steve turns and looks at Tony. “You just have to hang on a little longer.”
The music picks up and Wanda pulls him onto the dance floor, telling him he has to loosen up at some point. Steve watches as Tony pulls Alana onto the floor. They glide effortlessly in-between the other people. Tony’s easy smile pulls at his heart. After, Tony’s the only thing he can focus on. He watches as Tony plays the perfect host, moving from person to person, making jokes, laughing, and smiling.
Sleep is a fairly foreign concept to Tony. He didn’t sleep before Maria, after Maria sleep became impossible and now too much is going on for Tony to get more than a few hours. He spends the night tossing and turning. His encounter with Steve left him feeling like his skin was on too tight, and his mind filled with all the unspoken words he wished he’d said. Every time he tries to clear his mind Steve’s stupid face pops into his head. The jerk.
After some time he feels Tony’s breathing start to even out. It’s now or never. He hates that Tony makes him feel like he’s ambushing him, but what other choice does he have? He has to come right out and say what’s on his mind, like ripping off a bandaid, best to just do it as fast as possible. All the fights, battles, wars he’s fought, and a simple sentence is going to be his undoing.
“Thank you, Alana.”
The whole thing makes Steve feel flushed and ill and has his chest feeling tight. He feels an overwhelming sense of guilt that such a sweet moment makes him confused, sad, and angry. He thinks back to what Tony was like before they had ended and compares it to the person he sees in front of him now. This Tony is genuinely happy, something Steve can’t remember seeing in a very long time. He knows he should be happy for Tony, but he can’t. He hurts too much to do that. He certainly knows he shouldn’t feel anything but positivity and kindness towards Maria, but all he can muster is a bit of fondness mixed with curiosity, discomfort, and a bit of resentment. He shouldn’t, she’s just a baby. She didn’t do anything wrong, but it doesn’t change how he feels. For him, the little blue-eyed beauty is all of his regrets and failed dreams made real.
At the mention of whip cream, Maria’s face lights up. Her little smile is so infectious Steve can’t stop one from forming on his own. Tony guides Maria as she puts two pancakes on her plate, loads it up with fruit and helps her put a nice little serving of whip cream on top. Tony hands Maria a fork and knife and tells her to cut small pieces and to finish chewing before her next bite.
Peter and Alana are waiting for them in the hall. Alana takes Tony’s hand in hers and Tony brings it up to his lips and gives it a gentle kiss. Peter hangs behind and looks to Steve for comfort. He does the best he can and squeezes the kid’s shoulder.
“I don’t know if she does and the point is she shouldn’t because I’m supposed to be the parent. And as for Matt, he is a good man. His extra-curricular activities, however, could be better.”
“Shuri gave her another treatment… 6 hours ago,” Steve informs Tony.
Steve spins around to face him. Tony’s filled with so much anger, it kills him and Steve is just exhausted, too exhausted to fight, too exhausted for all of it.
Before they leave, Steve goes over to Maria’s bed and kisses her cheek. “I’ll be back angel,” he whispers into her hair.
Both she and Tony smile at Steve, like they’re both in on a joke Steve is too dumb to get.
“At least some things never change. It’s still funny to watch you squirm, Rogers,” Tony says around the mouth of the glass.
“What?”
Tony turns, from his place in front of the window, to give him a look of shame and anger at the intrusion. Steve proceeds into the room anyway. Tony turns back to face the window. His audible sobs replaced with silent streams of tears running down his face. The closer Steve gets to him the more obvious it become that Tony has been crying for a good long time. Steve does his best to not let it affect his decision. He came for answers and he’s going to get them. There’s no other choice.
The waiting room is small and just as sad as the wall that greeted them. It’s too bright and there aren’t enough chairs for all of them, but they make it work. You don’t become a superhero if you can’t sit on the floor for extended periods of time.
Steve shifts in his seat uncomfortably.
“Tony, I’m begging you. Please believe me.” Steve pleads as he grabs Tony. “Look into my eyes. You know me! I know you do! In your heart you know. Why would I lie to you?”
Steve falls silent. What else was there to say?
“Where are you? Everyone’s been going crazy trying to reach you,” Sam tells him.
“That’s right! You know, I remember when you were born.”
“This is it,” Shuri says as she changes out one IV bag for another one. Only this time the bag she’s hooking Maria up to is filled with Steve’s bone marrow. “Remember this has never been done. We don’t know how long it will take to see change if any,” she cautiously adds.
Tony has a look on his face that Steve can’t quite read. Steve starts to feel like he’s rapidly losing control of the situation again. He starts to ramble. “All I'm saying is it’s good to see you happ-”
“You have to talk to him, Papa. This is crazy,” Steve listens through the door as Alana speaks. Her voice is filled with desperation. Her accent getting thicker the more she pleads.
“Mr. Stark, while this sample is helpful. An unaltered, pure sample would be more helpful. You're not a doctor. You could have removed vital information,” he says in a cold and demeaning tone, never once taking his eyes off the vile.
“Thank you, I understand and I am grateful,” Steve says, shoulders visibly relaxing.
“Snug and tight,” Steve responds.
“She was my mother and I loved her. And I know that if she were here, she would have loved you and Maria.” Tony’s voice cracks as he finishes.
“A bone marrow transplant?” Peter questions.
Jenna smiles at him softly. “They looked like a bunch of doctors who are getting paid way too much.”
“She’s going to be okay,” she says as she places her hand on their shoulders. “Better than okay. I’m going to give her another treatment.”
“How can you say that?”
“No, it’s fine. Stay.” Steve’s confused, to say the least.
“C’era una volta un re e una regina che ogni giorno dicevano: ‘Ah, se avessimo un bambino!’ Ma il bambino non veniva mai. Un giorno, mentre la regina faceva il bagno, ecco che un gambero salto fuori dall’acqua e le disse: ‘Il tuo desiderio sarà esaudito: darai alla luce una bambina.”
“Uh, yeah?” He responds warily.
“This has to be it, Steve. This is all that matters. She’s all that matters.”
Steve’s silent for a moment. “No, I know the perfect place to take her. She’ll be protected one hundred 100% and she’ll have some of the greatest minds working to help her.”
“Actually, it’s 5:43, but that’s irrelevant.”
He could lose her, before he’s even gotten the chance to really know her. His fear is quickly replaced with anger. All this time he let Tony play the victim. Every time he manges a bit of control in his life it’s ripped away, but not this time. If it’s true, if somehow Maria was birthed from the insanity that had become his life, it’s for a reason, it’s God’s purpose and he isn’t going to ruin it like everything else.
He knows he should, but he doesn’t bother with a helmet, he’s too tired to hold up pretenses. The cold morning air stings his face. It feels like hundreds of tiny shards of glass are cutting into his skin. Deep down some sick part of him enjoys it. The good old Catholic boy inside him that tells him he deserves to be punished. He makes a stop on his way. As he pulls up to the hospital and sees the reports he goes around back and hides his bike in a different parking lot before he sneaks in without anyone knowing. The last thing he needs is his picture taken. He heads straight for the pediatric ward.
Tears threatened again, but these ones were okay.  They were not happy, exactly, but they were grateful.  Grateful that they were here, and he didn’t have to do this alone.
“Well, we can’t all have spent all our childhood in Brooklyn.”
Steve drew his lower lip into his mouth and chewed it. Tony waited, rage burning inside his every pore.
“Never got to though, did I?”
“Damn right, I am. So don’t worry about that part, okay? ‘Cause I won’t be carrying it alone either. We’re going to do it together.” He smiled. “Team lift.”
Natasha was getting to her feet, her eyes on the house.  Tony rolled over and looked.
like Charlie Bucket.
It was so much.
“I wish I could,” Steve said and kissed the soft juncture of Tony’s neck and shoulder.
“Go on,” she said, and put her arm around Dodger. “We’ll be here in the morning, right, Dodger?”
Steve shook his head. “I
Strange nodded.  “Glad to know he has a heart.”
But he
“We’ll depart from the Compound at seven a.m.  Sharp.”
Steve lifted a trembling hand to his face. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. “Jack-”
But, then he moved a little, shifted his bag from one shoulder to the other, and the illusion was broken.  Steve sighed, and those strain-lines appeared around his eyes again.  “Maybe someday,” he said tiredly.  “But not tonight.”
His eyes opened again.  “Thank you for coming for me.”
“No,” he said.  “You just haven’t called me that in a while.”
“Perfect. I knew you were a born dishwasher.”
He shifted again, turning onto his back, and there were his eyes, cloudy but open, and blue, and looking at him.  Looking at him.
“I know. Too long, Stark.”
“‘Some guy’?
.  But what Steve had just said was probably the heaviest, most important statement that had ever been uttered here.
Tony laughed, and sat down on the bed with a bounce. It creaked a little--not much, but enough--and Tony laughed again. “I was kind of thinking about Mrs. Perkins...you know?”
He shoved the thought away. Just like he’d done a thousand times for the last sixteen days. He was still in his office. Working. Always working. Just a busy little bee. That was him. If nothing else, this little feud he was having with Steve was certainly making him much more productive on the work-front. Even Pepper had commented on it. Praised him for his sudden hard-on for paperwork. She didn’t use those exact words, but he knew what she meant. And for that reason, he kept pushing. He liked making her happy, and if this made her happy, he’d keep it up. He just wished it wasn’t so boring
to keep drinking.  Especially if they were going to talk about this.
That’s all he got?  After the last week of either yelling, silence, or fucking
Steve scratched his forehead, then ran his hand back through his hair. “You’ve never...anything?”
They headed home, so tied up in each other they stumbled coming out of the elevator, Steve pulling at Tony’s clothes before they even got through the door, and Tony was on his knees two seconds after that. He grasped Steve’s hips and said, “Turn around,” in a voice husked with need. Steve pivoted, and Tony pushed him against the door. He ran his hands over Steve’s bare skin, as high as he could reach, brushing his shoulders, following the length of his spine, down to his waist, then to the cheeks of his ass. “God, baby,” he whispered, then delved between them with his tongue.
He shook his head as he passed the cop car on the side of the road.  Long thoughts.  Long, stupid thoughts.  He snapped the radio on, found The Beatles doing “Can’t Buy Me Love”, and sang along.
So, he let her.
Tony turned around. He was still bare-chested, but Steve had put his jeans back on. A faded, rumpled pair that hung low on his hips. He’d thrown his towel casually over his shoulder. His feet were bare. A sudden possessive feeling swept over Tony as he looked at him. He’d felt it before. A lot. But never with such burning intensity. And the thought of anyone else seeing Steve like this made him almost feral with jealousy. “
Tony looked at the paper, at her round, girlish hand.  Light years from the scribble that spelled out the inscription at the bottom of that drawing he’d found.  So, too, had been the casual way she asked him out.  Not like that other time.  That other person stumbling his way through it even with Tony’s blatant coaxing and coaching.  Not to mention the complete and utter differences in physicality.
Tony looked at him, looked into those eyes that he still dreamed about, still thought about every single day. He cupped Steve’s cheek, brushed his thumb along that high cheekbone. “It can only be once, Steve,” he said. “Just once, okay? Just tonight. She and I-” he shook his head, “-it really is serious. Okay?”
“I’m not laughing.”  But he was.  That patented Tony Stark smile was on his face, half-taunting, half-challenging, all-exasperating.  Steve wondered briefly what it would take to wipe it off his face for a minute.  He was sure there was something, but he wasn’t prepared to try any theories.  That was a dangerous road to go down, and once he started, there would be no exits, no turning back, he would have to go on through to the end, and he wasn’t entirely sure what the destination would look like when they got there.
“Sam.”
“Okay.”
“Mr. Stark is expecting you, Captain Rogers. You may enter.”
, but he
Steve held the paper in front of his face to hide his smile.
Steve laid hold of the razor and put the tip under his ear.  He drew it across his throat, ending its short, deadly journey at the exact spot Tony had claimed as his own.
“Fine,” Tony answered.  “It was ten.  But you’re all ‘super’ and stuff.  You can take it.”
A little ember glowed in Steve’s chest like a tiny, molten sun.  “You wrote most of it,” he said.
“No.”
Steve was sitting on the porch.  He’d changed into a blue Henley and pushed the sleeves casually up.  His hair had darkened a bit over the years, but now it shone gold in the sunlight.  His blue eyes, so big and bright, sparkled with happiness.  He was still a little pale, and he was still seated in his chair, but Tony caught his breath, seeing him there.  And he wasn’t the only one.  No eye could stray from him, so perfect in that bar of golden July sun.
Tony smiled in the darkness.
Tony winked.  “Keep walking that straight line, kid.”
But not enough to stop him.
dreams, Barton,” he muttered. “Cash and prizes. Candy, diamonds, pills, hundred dollar bills.” He glanced at Steve. His face still burned brilliantly, but Steve had bowed his head, looking at his hands now. “You know. Stark Industries stock options. Not...not anything else.”
,” he mumbled. “She’ll kill me.” He bit his lip. “She’ll kill us both," he amended, "but I’ll get the worst of it.”
Tony smiled up at him, and Steve's heart was lighter, heavier, brighter, darker.  It beat in his chest like a thunder, and the sound of it in his ears was a name, just a name: Tony Tony Tony.
He nodded at Steve and was gone.
He took his phone out of his pocket and pressed a couple of buttons.  Tony watched him curiously, adorable-Bruce still in full-effect.
“Yes, Steven,” Howard said. “There are.”
Lavish. It was the only word that fit. Waiters in hot rod red shirts walked here and there balancing huge trays of champagne and delicate canapes. Chandeliers dripped crystals, women dripped jewels. Music from a string quartet played continuously, people chatted, laughed, groups of beautiful men and women forming and re-forming in the swirl of a sequined skirt, the flash of a diamond cufflink.
excited.”
“Was his Zoloft tainted?”
was the same, but it wasn’t.
“No,” she assured him.  “No one hates you.  Just give him some time.”
, knowing what was going to happen between them as soon as they left here.
Tony considered giving him the silent treatment--just for a few minutes, of course--then reconsidered. That was ridiculous. He didn’t want to do that. He
“I miss you, too.”
, Tony thought, looking at them without a trace of his earlier jealousy.
The apartment door opens to a wall of sound. The TV was blaring some Hallmark Christmas re-run about what looked like a soldier and a ski instructor. A young brunet woman was arguing vociferously with an equally young man with bleached hair about crystals, while a slightly older blond man kibitzed and played darts. All the conversation ground to a halt as Steve ushered Tony over to the couch and got him situated comfortably on it. Someone even found the remote and shut off the TV.
“Not something romance focused please… I just… don’t want to think right now.”
“Of course. Nothing happens if you don’t say yes. Everything stays exactly the way it is right now, and I won’t ask again. It won’t come up again unless you bring it up.”
“No bed.”
“I… bought the house for you…so you can do what you want with it. You don’t have to set one of the bedrooms aside for me.”
“Thank You. Most people just think I lost my mind while I was a prisoner in Afghanistan."
“Did, uh, did you practice that?” Tony asked.
“You could get hurt. You could have gotten hurt today.”
“Yeah. It’s going to take me a bit to get the R8 running again, and I need something to drive until then. I didn’t want to ship one of my other cars in, and anyway, this one is completely electric. It goes with the new image I want for Stark industries. Green energy, a view of the future, responsible stewardship… you know.”
“She said her name was Natalie.”
“Get me off of my diet of hamburgers and pizza?”
“No. We use them for everything. Digging, reinforcing, carrying, forging, fighting, dancing…”Phil trailed off in thought.
“You should carve the clan medallion into the headstone where it belongs.”
“Is she hot? Japanese?”
“No. I’ve been awake for a while now. Clint is still sleeping though.”
This made Tony feel particularly bad when he woke up gasping from a nightmare and staggered into the shower, turning up the temperature as hot as the rattling old pipes here could produce. Steve greeted him at the bathroom door with a mug full of warm milk, another shirt, and a pair of sweatpants that weren’t soaked in sweat.
“Nah man. Don’t worry about it. The way Steve and Pietro eat no one but Lucky will notice that you’re eating too, and Steve thinks he eats too much pizza anyway.”
“Couples get their names engraved on the hearts over at Billy’s shop, then hang them on the Tree of Hearts. I help Billy out on the weekends with the engravings. He can’t keep up with the weekend business. I’ll help all week the weeks before and after Valentine’s day as well.”
“She’s under a lot of stress, she’s worried about her sister. I know all about worrying about sisters.” The guy with the bleached hair must be Pietro then, Tony thought. That must make the older looking blond with the amazing biceps Clint.
“Perhaps if you frame the conflict for us so that we can understand?” Steve offered gently.
“Really, I’m a big fan of the impressionists,” Wanda was saying thoughtfully as Tony worked with the coffee machine. “Not just the art, but the attitude. I mean, the major art critics of their time rejected them, rejected most living artists, according to Steve, and instead of giving up, or accepting that, they pooled their resources and put together their own exhibition. They questioned everything about the world they were trying to get a foothold in, from their fixation on historical paintings and landscapes to the way the only existing major gallery of the time worked. Steve told me once that that was why so many of their works ended up in collections outside of France.”
"It's good to see you awake. I was worried about you when I found you unconscious in this weather. We'll be at the hospital in about 15 minutes."
Tony took a big bite to give himself time to formulate a response, but then his chewing turned thoughtful. “Are these homemade noodles?”
“Oh, whenever we want.”
Background conversations and a break-up.
“Oh, wow. I did misunderstand… but that sounds fantastic. What movie did you pick?”
“Yeah, I mean, I just wanted to put together some suggestions. I know what you’re like with a brand new project that is a complete blank slate, so I want to give you an idea of what I would like if you say yes.” Steve explained.
“You are very big. The rest of us are pretty much the same size as Phil.”
“Would… I could fit three rooms like the hybrid rooms on this level around the trillium room. Windows up that high shouldn’t open, it would make them week against strong winds, but they would give the best view of the area around our lair.”
“It’s a surprise. Once you’re done eating you can go get settled on the couch and I’ll get our popcorn and snacks.”
“So what about him made you happy?”
“Sounds Good.” Nat said. “Do we want to talk about dealing with Tony’s family now?”
“Speak for yourself.” Natalie countered. “I’m looking forward to getting to know Clint better.”
“Can I join in the conversation?” Tony asked thoughtfully. “I’m not much of an art aficionado, but I do like Arrival of the Normandy Train, and I’ve always thought it was a shame that no one wants to talk about it with me.” They eventually moved from chatting about impressionists to watching a three hour miniseries about them. Along the way Tony learned that the red-head was named Natalie, and she was Clint’s newest valentine.
“Right. Should we stand against the back wall with our hands up?” Clint asked.
“Steve doesn’t like us wandering around at night unless we take the phone with us.”
“We will probably be the last to arrive. We drove down to New York last night.”
“So do you.”
“Not really. It’s a close call, but I prefer Imbolc.”
“With a completely furnished Master suite.”
“We don’t know.” The red-head answered.
“You all three want to try this?” Steve asked uncertainly.
“Do we need to help with the humans out front?” Nat asked, saving Tony from his bought of introspection.
“Tall enough for this” Tony replied as he hooked the metal heart over the wire branch of the fake willow. The two scurried back to the car and cranked the heater on, neither had been dressed for the snowy mid-February evening.
Phil arranged the three of them around the platform and walked them through a series of exercises designed to strengthen their flight muscles. “I ache in muscles I didn’t have yesterday.” Clint announced cheerfully when Phil called a halt to the activity.
“This, uh, ….”
“I don’t think Natalie was honest with me about why she was in town.”
“No idea. It was too dark for me to figure anything out last night.”
"You're in the Poconos, but Valentine is much closer. I've never had to use the ER, but I'm pretty sure they are up to treating hypothermia. Most of their business is skiers and hikers."
“Are you planning to take her up on it?” Crystal asked curiously.
Eventually Steve tired of Obie enough to turn from the red-head with a snap of his neck and a low angry growl that nearly sent the carriage horses running despite Happy’s best efforts. His teeth snapped as well, inches from Obie’s suddenly wide eyes. “I WILL greet my guests in the order in which I choose, and YOU will be silent, or YOU will leave. I am allowed, by my treaty with the queen, to toss trespassers off the top of my cliff and watch as they hit the ground so very far below.” Steve hissed. His wings were mantled, claws arched from the ground, protoscales on full threat display, the very image of a dragon that humans in this delta had been raised to fear before Steve allied with the queen. Obie swallowed and took a step back, leaving Steve free to turn his attention to the farm cart couple again.
for a long time. The only art I’ve done lately is pretty much just drawing stuff for Morgan to color.”
Steve scuffed his toe on the concrete.  “Well…”
“Thaddeus--”
Tony streaked by then banked left and came back.  He landed near Thanos’ body, the suit already disappearing, and started toward them.  His foot connected with the broken shell of the Infinity Gauntlet.  He kicked it out of his path without a glance.
“Umm…”
“And I don’t know your name,” Tony went on, as if Steve hadn’t spoken. Or grunted, anyway, because he wasn’t sure what he’d just done qualified as
saw that.”
His eyes filled with tears when he heard Tony’s voice.
“Why are you showing me this?”
Tony breathed out a laugh. “Aw, it’s alright.”
Steve shook his head.  “Nothing.  That’s it.  ‘General Ross’.”
Bruce reached out and gently touched one screen with his finger.  The other sections disappeared and this one expanded to fill the monitor.  Bruce touched it again and, with a measured flick of his finger, threw the image up into the air in front of them.
“You,” she answered, her eyes going to Tony, then back again. “Tony?”
“I missed the one by the bandstand,” she said, tracking his casual gestures. “Are they a threat?”
Tony shrugged. “Thought we’d run away.”
Steve nodded.  “I’ll take a cab, then.  I’ll call in the morning.”
“Really?  Because--”
tired now.”
“He will be fine,” Thor assured a very worried, highly pissed-off Tony Stark.  “He has made his ancestors proud.  He deserves a rest.”
Bucky shrugged.  “I just wanted to say thank you.”
“I know.  Me too.”
His mind went blank.  There was nothing.  Something only he knew?  He didn’t know a goddamn thing.
“No,” Sam said. “This is more than worried. This is...something else.”
Tony popped another button on Steve’s shirt, kissed his chest, then popped another.
Steve sat suddenly up, wrapping an arm around Tony.  He kissed him while Tony’s hand moved between them.  “Tony,” he said into his ear urgently.  “Did you really love me?  Before?  Please.  I-I need to know.”
They kept it a secret.
“I’m getting your suit all wet,” Steve said softly, and his finger began to move, subtly running across Tony’s palm.
okay, you’ll tell me. Alright?” Tony said. His fingers were on Steve’s hips, tracing the skin just above the waistband of his boxers. “Just say ‘stop’, and we’ll stop.”
Accidents and consequences
Tony threw himself down on the couch and lifted his feet onto the coffee table.  “You don’t have to tell me, soldier.  I believe you.  But next time you two decide to get down to fisticuffs, let me know.  I could sell out Madison Square Garden with that match-up.  It’d be like Tyson versus Holyfield all over again.  Although, hopefully with less ear-biting.”  He shrugged.  “Or more.  It’d be good, either way.”
“Do you like Paprikash, Mr. Stark?” Howard looked up, and Steve gave him a complicated smile, equal parts concern, fear, and hope.
Steve sighed, a sound of pure contentment, and Tony’s worry went away.  “That sounds great, Tony.”
"Holy shit."
“If I answer that, I’ll be telling you something,” she said with a sly, fox-like smile.
Thaddeus grunted.  “And the system--?”
“Oh, baby. Such a hardship,” Tony said, and pulled him closer. Steve came to him and clasped his hand, burrowing his head into Tony’s shoulder. He closed his eyes and sighed with contentment.
“Me too.”
Steve kept grinning, but he glanced around furtively, saw no one, then leaned over Tony’s chair and pressed a kiss to his mouth. “I am,” he said, and kissed him again. “Very sorry. Very, really sorry.” He lifted one eyebrow. “Do you believe me now?”
Steve shook his head.  “No.  It stopped.”
“Okay.”
“Not because I didn’t wanna be, Tony,” he said, turning to face him fully.  He reached out and touched the blue light of the reactor with gentle fingers.  “I did want to be around you--I
Tony smiled and kissed his forehead again. He’d never get tired of that. He knew it. He knew how sappy it was, but he couldn’t care less. “Well, I like how that turned out.”
“Where’s the pizza?”
“She means well. And he really is a nice guy.”
“Yeah?”
“No,” Tony said, holding up his free hand, but keeping his finger twined with Steve’s. “It’s okay. Just call, okay? Please?”
He waited by the passenger-side door while Tony climbed in and unlocked it, then slipped inside the car with practiced ease. He tossed his bag in the backseat like he’d done dozens of times before, and buckled his seat-belt while Tony keyed the engine to life. It sounded the same. Loud and good. Steve felt his spirits lift a little. It was irrational. He knew it. One little car ride was not going to make much of a difference, but he felt it anyway. Felt it and went with it, hoping he was wrong. Hoping it
“Yeah.  I know.  But it’s nice to hear.”
“He shouldn’t be going at all,” Nick said.  “Let’s take this to a judge.  In court--”
Tony thought about it.  Why
“I know.”
Well, fuck you too, then, Steve Rogers.
Steve’s hands balled into fists, the right gripping the handle of the cane until the knuckles were white.
Tony looked out the window.  The hatch leading down into the prison was still closed.  It was closed 99% of the time.  Not much use opening it when you were surrounded by hundreds of miles of water in every direction.  Not even Steve could swim that far.  At least not in these temperatures.
“You’ve lost weight too. I know you’re worried, but fuck, man, you’ve got to take better care of yourself. You’ve got to eat. And sleep. And-”
His head was reeling. It was such a switch. Going from thinking Steve didn’t want him at all to this. This gentle look. This soft, hesitant touch of his hand. And Christ, wasn’t that the way it had always been between them? Hot and cold. Red light, green light. Never steady, no way of knowing exactly where they stood from one moment to the next. Part of him loved it. Loved playing the game. But another part of him didn’t want to play anymore. That part just wanted something sure. Stable.
“-am, Brucie. I’m always-”
Tony grabbed his hand and shook it wildly, like he couldn’t contain his excitement. “No,” he said, “baby, you don’t understand. It’s
Jeff wasn’t a hugger, but he clasped Tony’s shoulder when the jet touched down, thanked him, told him to get home to his fella, then got into the Charger and drove home.
It's so fucking
"Shut up, Tony," Steve said, but the grin was still on his face.  Tony was heavy, squirmy like a puppy, complaining like a brat, but Steve had never been more happy to have all of those things held in his arms, bundled up against his heart.  "At least let me get you inside first."
“I’m scared,” he said.
Steve shrugged.
“That’s not the way it sounded earlier."
We're getting closer to the end. Time is flowing by...
never--be anybody else. Not for me.”
“Yeah.  Sorry I couldn’t get here sooner.  I was on clean-up duty after the hurricanes in Florida.”
Sam met him at the door, and hugged him hard. They’d talked on the phone a lot, texted, messaged back and forth, but this was the first time they’d seen each other in a long time, and when they parted, both of them wiped their eyes.
“Yes. Seven.”
“Daddy,
That’s what he’d said last time.
Steve nodded. “Don’t mention it to Tony just yet, okay?” he said. “I’d like to think about it before I talk it over with him.”
No.  He’s noble.  He’s good.
“You feel good.”
Yeah. Essential. Those moments when Steve was just sitting with him. Just holding him. Just lying with his feet in Tony’s lap while they listened to music or watched some stupid show on tv. They were essential. Steve was essential.
Tony let it happen, just watching him silently, respectfully.  He never interrupted a man so obviously working through a problem.  It was a professional courtesy.  Plus, Bruce was adorable when he worked, and adorable-Bruce was always worth a look.
Tony nudged him with his shoulder. “Stop being understanding and be mad at me instead.”
Steve shrugged, a little self-consciously. “I don’t know,” he muttered. “I guess I’m just starting to think about...my future, or whatever.” He laughed bitterly under his breath. “
Steve gripped Tony’s hand, but didn’t look at him. “We don’t have to.”
“I bought a new one, Mom. Remember?”
“I know.  But they can’t make me
“But I missed you.”
Steve returned his kiss, then pulled Tony against his chest, wrapping his arms around him and put his face in his neck.  He held him, just breathing him in, just being with him.  Steve still couldn’t believe that this was his life now.  He couldn’t believe that he was allowed to just
“Get ‘em out of here, Tony,” Steve whispered, his voice flat and cold.
Steve didn’t have to look for Tony. He was everywhere and drew Steve’s eye like a moth to the flame. He was with Pepper tonight, and if the constant touching meant anything, she had come as his date and not his employee. A more casual viewer may not have noticed the difference--Tony touched everybody--but the delicate way his fingers lingered on the small of her back or brushed her hair aside so he could whisper in her ear spoke volumes to Steve.
“And your daddy will always be seventeen,” Sarah went on, sliding her hand through Tony’s hair. “Sitting at my kitchen table with a cup of coffee, wearing a t-shirt two sizes too big for him.”
Tony pulled back and looked him in the eye.  “Are you happy, Steve?  For real, I mean.  Do I make you happy?”
“Just...just an errand. It won’t take long. Please?”
. Tell me something you want."
A smile:
“Confirm that?”
Steve texted back a moment later.
“Are you finished?”
“Promise me if we win, you’ll grow it again.”
One more night.
Oh my god, Nat, where’s Tony?  Is he--” he coughed, sending blood flying in a spray.
“Do you really think charm is going to work on me?”
“Coats go on Daddy’s bed,” she informed him. “Can I show Dodger my room?”
Steve nodded.  “Okay.”
Steve gave him a tight smile. “That’s what my mom says too.”
“Just sit down.”
Steve swiped at the blood and sat up.  Nat watched him warily, clearly waiting for another attack.  He held his hand up.
“Steve?”
Tony nodded.  “I know.  I’m sorry.  It was an accident I found out.  Nobody told me.”
They stood side-by-side, watching them, silence once again falling between them. It wasn’t quite as awkward as it had been, but it wasn’t comfortable either. Tony could see Steve casting tiny side-long looks his way, and suddenly he couldn’t stand it anymore.
“‘Kay.”
He came almost immediately. Tony always gave him that. They had never talked about it, but after their first time together, Tony had picked up on the fact that Steve could go multiple times before being truly satisfied, and Tony liked to give him the first one fast. It was just one of the things Steve adored about him. That he would always be so selfless. Giving Steve pleasure before ever even thinking of himself. Of course, it was always mutually beneficial in the end. Steve could hold out longer the second time around, and that was a gift
“That sucks.”
It was the shout of triumph from the other side of the door that spurred the two men into motion. They rammed the door open and lunged into the room. Clint, going low, forced the table into Alexi’s gut while jerking Tony off the table and down to the floor. Steve vaulted the table, crashing into the stranger and driving him to the ground. A few moments of violent wrestling followed before Alexi twisted free and lunged for the front door
“Blue and red. Here,” Steve flipped through the folder pulling out a picture he’d drawn, and some others he’d printed out. “I love you in red, and I know you love me in blue.”
Steve was clambering around the cart while the blond talked, delicately maneuvering the unconscious dragon around. Steve re-positioned Phil’s legs and wings, curling the smaller dragon’s spine gently so it looked like he was resting comfortably in the cart rather than having been tossed in haphazardly. The odd thing was that the longer the two touched the brighter the glow around them became, a soft golden light that sparked green and blue where they touched. “I didn’t know anyone had decided to emulate me.” Steve commented softly.
“She was perfect. Everything dad would have wanted for me. Exactly the sort of woman he said I should find and marry.”
“Well now you have a much bigger bed and your own master suite.” Something odd passed over Steve’s face then, brief flashes of sudden and contradictory emotions. He took a deep breath, and then sighed before answering.
“Why aren’t you going to culinary school?”
“Isn’t the Stop and Shop a store?” Tony asked as Steve started driving.
Obie was not as intimidated as the horses, which he proved by stepping out of the carriage, approaching Steve, and speaking over the red-head’s polite response to Steve’s polite greeting. Steve ignored it at first, but Tony knew the flash of temper was coming from the way Steve’s protoscales were raising up into a line of razor sharp spines along Steve’s spine. Tony had done a lot of reading about dragons before approaching Steve with his proposition, and one of those books had shown a rider mounted on a dragons’ back in front of its wings. Any human trying to ride Steve like that would have found themselves cut to shreds. When Steve wanted to fly Tony somewhere he had Tony crawl into what was basically a very large basket that Steve carried in his claws.
“Matings within a clan are rather frowned upon…” Steve began.
“You’ll have all that, and with someone who really cares about you.”
“Tony? Is something wrong?” Steve’s voice held both an edge of worry and a slight slur of sleepiness. Tony turned, pressing his face into the warm, soft, dark place under Steve’s wing, not even sure why he was trying to hide from the proof that so many of his dreams truly HAD come true yesterday.
“Domestic geese…” Tony murmured to himself, remembering last time Steve had traded with one of the farms beyond the woods, and how much he had enjoyed his snacks.
“What?”
“Me too,” Clint said softly.
“Anyway, I’m grateful you showed up. Pizza means a chance to hang out at the bar and flirt. I want to get a girlfriend by this weekend. Nothing is more depressing than being single in Valentine on Valentine’s Day.”
"That... seems unstable."
“Great! I’m Tony!” Tony glanced around to see that Steve had slipped off. “How bout I show you to the flight platform out back and we can kill some time until Steve’s return?”
“I’d kinda rather if everyone gathered here. I was going to call Crystal when I was done on the phone with you.”
“The house isn’t perfect, but I didn’t have time to build something new if I wanted it to be ready for tonight… I’ve been told I give a pretty mean massage, and I remember what you said about the tub at your apartment.”
“Well, yeah,” Steve stuttered to a stop, while slowly turning bright cherry red.
“Right. Okay.” Tony grabbed one of Steve’s shoulders and pushed his wobbly way to his feet, straightening Steve’s jacket and glancing down to double check that no light was seeping out of it. “Time to open the door and get a nice blanket for Steve.” He told Clint once he was sure he was going to remain standing.
He ignored the down hallways and led the newcomers up instead.  The hall here was almost as large as the main hall below, but rather trillium shaped rather than round, with one lobe ending in the stairway to the main part of the compound and each of the others being a guard post. Tony found little desire in himself to hop now that Steve was gone, but was pleased with the easy way his new dragon body turned the wheel that controlled the back door. All three of the newcomers blinked and fluffed in surprise when the entirety of the back wall twisted on its track opening their way to the flight platform. A path to his left lead to the top of the cliff and the viewing platform Tony had watched all their varied guests arrive from just yesterday. He ignored that as well and trotted out to where the long oval of the platform ended to look down at the water so far below. “The door is cool, isn’t is?” Tony chatted as he gazed around. “I designed it when I moved in. The trillium room used to be open to this platform, and super cold in the winter, but now it seals up tight and its possible to keep that area warm enough for guards to be comfortable, if we had enough residents to HAVE guards. I'm real pleased by how smooth the tracks are. I think that sort of construction could be used on a much grander scale. It would really smooth out and speed up trade between cities if we ran tracks between them and ran carriages along the tracks instead of the kind of roads trade flows along now…”
“I… would like that, but there isn’t any need to…”
by A. E. Housman
“People come here to renew their vows for just that reason. Outside of Valentine’s day, most of our guests are here for anniversaries, to reconnect, or both.”
“Not Steve’s. His parents are just dead. My dad and brother are still alive, but they’re both in prison. Pietro and Wanda slithered out of their father’s criminal empire by testifying against him, but they really have no idea how to live on their own. Neither do I. Steve didn’t either. The system was all he remembered when I met him, but he figures things out. He’s adaptable.”
"Err... It's February." the blond said sounding awkward. "I doubt there is a hotel in Valentine that has a free room tonight. If you really don't want to go to the hospital you could crash with us tonight I guess, but you were unconscious in your car in freezing temperatures and you should really probably get medical care."
“I’ve been enjoying it,” Tony replied. “I had no idea Olympia was considered scandalous at the time.”
“The board will want a prenup.” Tony mentioned hesitantly.
“I wanted to spend time with you too.” Tony said, uncertain if he was in trouble for something now that Steve’s face was so serious.
“That is probably wise. Do you need to be picked up?”
All three of the former humans dissolved into trilling laughter, while Phil looked over at Steve in commiseration. “I don’t get it either.”
“Goober works for me. We can call yours piece one and mine piece two… Oh, Hey everybody!” The other three dragons were standing in the main hall again, having clearly woken up around the same time as their hosts. The purple and white one was hopping around in much the same way Tony had just done, he too had a black edge to his wings he was having a hard time seeing. Despite her more complex coloring the red headed, red chested dragon seemed much more able to restrain herself from hopping about.
“S'iz shver tsu zayn a Yid” Pietro muttered. Then said “there is nothing you need to clean up Cap. The girls took care of everything.”
“Hey. That rhymes.”
“Ah… what I mean is… there is only one grocery store in Valentine, so everyone just calls it The Store.”
As Steve drove Tony started being able to smell smoke as well. Shortly thereafter they could both SEE the smoke tainting the pale gray winter sky with a column of darkness. It was obvious that they were getting closer to the fire as they traveled and it became obvious why as they failed to be able to pull into the lot in front of the hotel. The lot was instead completely full of hotel guests, staff, emergency crews and fire fighters. Tony’s hotel belched smoke into the sky as Tony jumped from the van to race over to the crews, desperate to find out if Rumiko had arrived without telling him, completely forgetting Steve, the van and his shopping in his haste.
A little chat with Nat
the adoration pouring out of his own mouth.
“Seriously, what’s…Oooohhhh.”
"Have you been inside?" Steve asked and Clint shook his head.
So, he went back to Malibu.  And started drinking in earnest.  And nobody came to ask how he was.  Nobody came to stop him.
Tony touched the back of his neck, drawing his thumb over the knobs of his spine.
the one we owe, Nat.  He’s the one who saved us all.”
“Ooh!”
But Tony just laughed. Shook his arm again. He smelled good. His hair gleamed in the setting sun. “
Tony nodded. “Tonight,” he agreed. “Lots of stuff tonight.”
.  I’m afraid of
“Not. The point. Steve.”
“The very same people who, along with Wanda Maximoff, came here last night, damaged property, disrupted patients, destroyed security footage, and assaulted two people.”
Steve laughed. It was soft. Fond. Like it used to be. “I’m covered up now,” he said. “How’s that?”
“Really?  Daisies?”
Steve pulled him closer and kissed the side of his face with a gentleness that was heartbreaking in its fragility, then held him, just held him.
Steve looked up from his task, catching Tony’s eyes. “Hey,” he said, brow furrowing. “You okay?”
Jen grasped his wrist.  "Make up, sweetheart," she said.  "It's not worth it. Whatever it is, it's not worth it."
“In your dreams, Mr. Stark,” the soldier said.  “I doubt you’ll ever be allowed back in.  Come on.”
I know these two are technically underage. I know it. I struggle with this. A lot. However, they are both seventeen, almost eighteen, so I'm going to be okay with that. THIS IS WHY I DON'T WRITE HIGH SCHOOL STUFF. There's the ick-factor attached to the word "underage", so I try to stay away from it altogether. I tried not to be explicit. Sorry if anyone is either offended, or thinks that I'm a huge dork for even worrying about it in the context of a fan-fiction alternate universe take on high-school-aged superheroes. Reading that back makes me sound like a huge dork. Meh, that's okay. I've been called worse.
Thank you for reading! Enjoy a little bit of not-quite-as-angsty-as-usual!
Tony shrugged, said Steve had taken ill, and drank his beer.
“I do know.”
“Okay.” He said it like he was relenting, and Steve heard the humor in his voice, but he heard something else too--Tony’s own need. His own want. There was a heat under the humor. Tony could not disguise it any more than Steve could stop his own muscles from trembling. “Okay, baby. I’ll give you what you want.”
“Then, play with me.”
“Okay,” Tony said. “I’m looking very forward to this talk, just so you know.”
as grown-up as Tony looked. Most of the time, he still felt like that angry, confused kid he’d been before Tony came along. He felt that way now, especially given the admiring looks that everyone was shooting Tony’s way, and he felt his heart sink a little. Because six years
to talk to Steve. For as long as he had him here, he wanted to talk to him. “How easy this is,” he murmured. “When it’s just you and me. How it only gets hard when we have to bring other people into it.”
the toughest.”
“Mom.”
“Wow,” Tony said, and poked him in that sensitive spot on his ribs that always made him squirm. “Retire, huh? Christ, when did you get so old?”
“Well, then maybe you don’t trust me, either.”
He drew his clothes back on in the gloom and limped out the door.  His cane was leaning next to the bed.  He reached for it, then opened the third drawer instead.  There was paper in there, sharpened pencils.  He’d always kept them next to the bed.
“Where’s Clint?”
“Of course, I am,” Tony said. He ran his hand over Steve’s bare shoulder. “But that’s what I mean. We’re one of
“I know a lot of people who would disagree.”
Steve sighed and shook his head.  “Prison was the consequence, Tony.  It was the effect, not the cause.”
Sam called Tony Friday afternoon.
Tony pulled up while they stood outside talking.  He’d seen this sort of thing before, Steve in front of a loose group of guys with pamphlets and smiles, and he sauntered over to listen.  He and Steve didn’t know each other very well yet, were still navigating the waters between acquaintances and friends, but he always enjoyed hearing a good, old-fashioned Steve Rogers smack-down.  Especially when it wasn’t aimed at him.
“Don’t know,” Steve said, sipping his drink. “Maybe. Maybe Bucky and Nat thought I’d rip off their valuables or something and they hired you to come check and see.”
“Tony and I don’t speak about personal things,” Howard said. “In fact, we hardly speak at all. We haven’t in years.”
She gave him a little push, and he went, carrying Tony’s cup.
Steve nodded, and rested his head against Tony’s. “Yeah. I guess it was.”
He was shaking now.  Tony could see it, his big hands trembling against the arms of the chair.  His jaw was clenched, those eyes, flashing black pearls in the sweet cream of his skin.  He looked both terrible and exquisite, like a god of old, worshipped on an altar stained with the blood of sacrifice.
Steve tried to leave his nerves behind, but they followed them through the lobby, into the elevator, and then down the hallway to Tony’s front door. He lived in the penthouse. Of course, he lived in the penthouse. Howard Stark would not live anywhere but the penthouse, Steve thought bitterly, and that broke his heart a little, because he had never been bitter about people who had more than he did. But when Tony opened the door and he saw the room, all the expensive, beautiful, delicate-looking things inside, he couldn’t help but feel
“Couldn’t you just ask Bruce?”
“No.  I was just thinking.”
Tony snorted. “I hid her scissors.”
, he thought.
allowed me in the first place?”
“So,” Howard said, “are you bringing Morgan tonight?” His voice was curious but not intrusive and Tony was glad. He’d only allowed Howard to be around Morgan once or twice since they’d moved back, and only for very short periods of time. And never alone. Tony didn’t think he would do or say anything to harm her--at least not now--but he still wanted to keep a very close eye on the situation for now.
“‘Kay.”
“Just, um, move for a second, okay?”
the pool.
At first, with a gentle, “I’m sorry” tone, then, when that didn’t work, a more firm one.  Finally, the last few days, he’d broken into desperate pleading.  The cat was unmoved.  It hated him, so Steve had finally given up and decided to hate it right back.
Some snuggles. Howard pays a visit. Steve makes a decision.
Steve shrugged. “Yeah. You’re right. They woulda kicked me out just to get rid of me. They don’t want guys like me dragging down their averages for too long.”
Tony turned the stereo up and drove home with the top down.  Steve was glad he didn’t have to talk.  He couldn’t stop thinking about where Tony fit into that equation.
“Yes.  You know he was in love with you for a long time.”
“Boss?” FRIDAY asked, her chipper voice questioning.
“‘Night, Mom.”
“Before their faces are out there or before someone decides to come gunning for the racist fucks spreading their shit all over Manhattan?”
“Let’s go.  Do you want to go to Tahiti?  I think I still have that place in Tahiti.”
Home.
Tony leaned closer, getting into Steve’s space.  “I mean, the thought of you in a dress uniform is always hot,” he said deliberately, and Steve ducked his head, blushing and smiling.  Tony went on, unable--or maybe just unwilling--to stop his own mouth.  “Of course, I really only want you in your uniform so I can take you
“I’m fine.”
. Not even something that could be called a
He hung up the phone, took two bites of his cereal, then picked up the phone again.  He didn’t have to search his contacts--this number was on speed-dial.  Number 3, to be exact.
“I didn’t mean
Tony laughed softly.  “My little optimist,” he said, peppering little kisses onto Steve’s neck.
, Thad,” Steve said, running his hand through his hair. “Just...maybe take a little breather. A little time. Apart.”
Lots.
“Guess I won’t be running any more circles around you,” Steve said.
“They’re not hypothetical, Tony. You already met them. They’re there. They’re there, and at MIT, you’re going to be with them every single day. You’re going to see them, and talk to them, and go out for coffee with them after class. While I’d be back here stocking shelves, you’d be doing projects with them, and experiments, and-” he gestured with one hand, taking in everything and nothing, “-and telling them jokes you can’t tell me because I wouldn’t understand them in a thousand years. And pretty soon-”
“The same thing I’ve always wanted,” he said, drawing himself up to his full height.  Even so much thinner, it was still impressive.  “You.  Just one last time.  And then I’ll leave you alone.”
Steve glanced at his feet. The smile was still there, but it changed a little, faded, then resurfaced. Tony wasn’t sure what it meant. Or if it meant anything at all. Steve nodded, then turned and walked away, toward the door leading to the stairs.
Tony sighed. Ran his hand through Steve’s hair. “Yeah.”
me. A while ago. He said you were with somebody. Some
“I love it,” he said.
He chucked his stuff into the bedroom, then went into the bathroom to shower. Standing under the hot spray, he tried hard to not think. He tried to just clear his mind of everything. It was getting a little easier. Even without the help of a drink when he needed it, clearing his mind was getting easier. He still
Sorry.”  He pulled away fast once he realized what he was doing.  Once he realized how close he was, how tightly he was clinging to a person he was no longer allowed to cling to.  A red blush the color of bricks stained his cheeks.  “I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to--” he flapped a hand at Tony like that explained everything.  Tony supposed it did.
“Come for me, Tony. Right now. C-” He fell back on the pillows, cock spurting into his hand, covering his stomach. In his ear, he heard Tony cry out softly, and for one blinding, brilliant moment, he almost felt like he was there with him, holding his sweat-slick body against him, both of them panting, both of them flushed with heat and passion, Tony weak in his arms the way he only was when they were like this. When they were holding each other in the sweet, floaty after-time.
“Tony wants it to work, Steve. He wants you. The way he talks, he’s always wanted you.”
“Not from his end, but you might want to watch out for stray bullets or poison arrows or some shit.  They might be coming for you.”
Tonight he just wanted to get Steve home.
“What’d you do?”
said it, but not every day.  Not every hour.  Not with every waking breath so Tony might have
Tony groaned, suddenly overwhelmed with a feeling of dumb gratitude toward the arrogant prick he actually really did dislike.  It was an uneasy cocktail, but he’d ordered it.  He had to drink it.
“What thing?”
“Forever.”
“Not too slow,” Steve said quietly, urgently.  He put his hand in Tony’s hair.  “Please.  Okay, Tony?  I need you.”
“Oh my god,” Tony sighed, sinking further into the chair, giggling. And when was the last time he had giggled? Had he ever giggled? “Does he know?”
Dodger whined, trying to remind them he was here and wanted some attention too, and Morgan dropped to her knees to hug him around the neck. “Hi, Dodger,” she said, and he bumped her cheek with his nose. She let out a high-pitched string of giggles, and that
It was hell.
“You paid me before.”
“And I believe there was an ‘unethical’ in there somewhere.”
fucked him. They had been working their way up to it, but time--and nerves--were always too big a factor, but Steve had slipped his fingers gently inside him a few times. Turned him over and licked his way in. He still remembered the sounds Tony made when he did that. The low moans, the way he’d muffled his cries against his forearm or Steve’s pillow. He wouldn’t have to stifle himself now with Josh. No Mrs. Perkins in the apartment below, listening to the illicit affair of two teenage boys just discovering the pleasures of being with someone they loved.
“Hey, buddy,” Steve said quietly, bending down to ruffle his fur, and laughing to himself when the dog swiped his face with his tongue. “Gross, Dodge,” he said, but it was more than fond. He scratched him behind the ears with both hands, then planted a kiss to the top of his head. “Where’s Mom?”
“But be on alert.  I trust your judgement, sweetheart.”
? I don’t even know where his apartment is.”
“He knows I’m right, Miss Romanov,” Ross said.  “I’ll give him that.  He
“I’ll see you in the morning.”
Nat sighed heavily.  “We should go.”
“I am sure.”
Tony slid into the booth next to him.  Clint scooted in on Bruce’s side.  “What are you sorry for?” he asked and snagged a muffin.  “Blueberry?”
He hung up.
"No.  Never have."
Steve propped himself up on one elbow so he didn’t completely crush Tony, and kissed him, opening his mouth at Tony’s unspoken insistence, meeting his tongue, letting them move together in a way that had become so familiar and yet was still so thrilling. Tony’s hands moved up his sides, then back down again, slipping under his shirt to touch his bare skin, pulling him closer until Steve’s hips lay flush against him, feeling his growing hardness.
he asleep?” Natasha asked.  “Did he just doze off?”
Steve sighed, giving in.  It was easy, that giving in.  Maybe too easy, but that seemed to be the way of things when it came to Tony.  “Okay.  Okay, fine.”
“Can you two please fuck it out later?” Clint said mildly.  “How ‘bout giving someone else the floor?”
kind of fun.”
Steve rolled his eyes and hugged him again. Wrapped his arms around his neck and squeezed him very tight. As tight as he could without hurting him. “Well, stop it. I don’t like it.”
Tony took a step backward. He had to. If he didn’t, he was going to throw up, because right now, that scent and closeness that he craved was also making him sick. And wasn’t that the way it always was? The things you loved most were the things most toxic.
“So, I’m not the world’s worst guy for not asking you?” Steve asked.
Tony nodded. “Okay.”
Steve shook his head slowly from side to side. “No. I guess it’s not.”
“Not much longer now, baby,” he promised.
“Every plan I had...except this one.”
Steve recoiled.  His face first slammed shut, then turned frightened.  He drew himself up, pulling into the corner, getting as far away from Tony as he possibly could.  His knees came toward his chest and his arms wrapped around them.  He dropped his head down onto them.  He rocked himself.
“Anything you want, Tony,” Steve said.
“Well, then you understand,” Howard said. “You understand why I would have a problem with you being with my son.”
And that was it.
“It felt a lot longer.”
Steve ducked his head. He was blushing. Crazily. The feel of Tony’s hand in his, a near revelatory experience. “Stark,” he said quietly. “
As if reading his mind, Bucky stepped back, back toward the shadows.  “You should go.  Steve’s waiting.”
,” he gasped, and there was an almost frantic rustling in Steve’s ear.
Natasha watched Bucky’s broad back shiver and quake within the circle of Steve’s arms.  She wondered that Steve had the strength still to contain him, but he held on, solid, stable.  If not for the paleness of his cheek and the brightness of the blood on his neck and the grass around him, no one would know that he was a dying man.
Steve looked at his watch again, then looked anxiously up and then down the street. He didn’t see Tony. He didn’t see any of the three cars he drove.  He didn’t see any of his suits, or his stupid t-shirts, or his sunglasses, or the reading glasses he wore when they sat in the diner looking at menus like they always did, in spite of the fact that they invariably ordered the exact same thing every time they went there. He didn’t see his hair, or his arms, or his hands, and Steve thought--no,
, he thought.  And that was true.  He deserved to be lying here alone, riled up, lonely, frustrated.  Because that was exactly what Tony had done to Steve.  He broke into that hospital, woke Steve up from his slumber, got him excited, got him anxious, then ran away without a backward glance.
“No,” Steve said.  “No, I’ll take the couch.  If that’s okay?  I’d rather do that.”
Steve came home late and tired. The restaurant had been busy all week. It was busy again tonight. He had been working a lot. He, Trish, and Bailey had been covering Carlos’s shifts while he healed. He’d also been painting more. The art school wanted samples of his work before admitting him for the next semester, and whenever he wasn’t at the bakery or the restaurant, he was at his easel, working on his paintings.
Steve nodded.  “That’s what I thought too.”
“She would never, Bruce,” Natasha said flatly.  “Steve is like a father to her.  She would never do that.”
Thoughts of Natasha flooded his mind as he walked.  Battle-bloodied and bruised, dancing in a red dress and slinky heels, lying in his bed in his old green Army t-shirt, kicking his ass in the gym.  She’d believed in him, held him, helped him, tethered him, and given him wings to fly.  Other than Bucky and Tony, she was the one person he had ever truly claimed as his own.  She was his.  She’d always be his.  A part of him.  Another piece of the puzzle that was Steve Rogers’ heart.  And Bruce was waiting for her, and Steve would give her willingly and happily, but he would never let her go.  Not completely.  Never completely.
And she started to cry.
“Shut up, Tony.”
But none of those things worked.
and not just a father. That part wanted to tell him. Wanted Howard to be happy for him. And happy for Steve too. But he wasn’t quite sure if they were there yet. Which sucked because the party was in roughly three hours. They were running out of time, but so what? Like Howard had said, it was
“I might.”
. Telling himself that didn’t help though. Not in the face of that wicked, sweet little smile.
“Yeah.”
Tony closed his eyes.  Only Steve.  Only Steve would consider a beat-down over a bully no big deal.  “How badly are you hurt?”
“And you’re pretty determined to be one of them, aren’t you?”
“Oh my god, Tony, no,” Steve pleaded.  “You can’t be serious.”
“What’s with the face?”
He looked exhausted. And angry. His mouth turned down in a pout. His eyebrows drawn inward in a tight scowl. His hair stuck up in bed-head spikes. The night before, he’d been wearing a leather jacket and jeans, but now he was wearing loose sleep pants that hung low on slim hips, and a t-shirt that had been slashed in half to show off a toned stomach. He looked perfect, not a blemish on him--at least not on the parts Steve could see--and he could see a lot. See how even though he was upset, his lips were red and finely-made. His eyes were dark and intense. His skin was smooth, almost poreless, like olive-hued porcelain, and that made sense because Steve could see something else too: he
Steve sighed.  “I already told you.”
Tony heard the water going one last time, and tried to put his focus back on Clint’s arrows.  Officially, he was retired, but sometimes Clint still came on-board.  Like with Baxter.  Tony supposed he was a “consultant”.  Like Tony himself.
doing. You. Call. Me.”
“Can you be quiet for just a--oh, here we go.”  Bruce typed in a few more key-strokes, waited for it to process, then a few more.  On the monitor in front of him, a split-screen of what looked like security camera footage appeared.  Each screen showed a different tiny room.  Each tiny room had four things in it--a cot, a toilet, a sink, and a person.
"I know.  And I know we need to start telling people, I just...want a little more time."
“Nope. Not a bit.”
“I wouldn’t say that,” Tony breathed against him, then ran his tongue along the column of his throat.  Steve moaned, fisting his hand in Tony’s hair.  “I just wondered what the...situation is,” Tony said.  “Can you…” He looked at Steve and raised an eyebrow.  “
Tony laughed and clasped his arms around Steve’s waist. They hadn’t kissed. Not really. Just hands. Just cheeks. But now, he stretched on his toes and pressed his lips to Steve’s soft ones. Steve sighed into it, like it was a relief. “It
They came out into the common room, and the word had never felt so right.  After the time he’d spent with Steve, this place had never felt so common.  Tony looked at his watch as the portal closed.  They had went in at eleven-fifteen.  It was now twelve twenty-three.  Tony blinked, surreality making him dizzy.  It seemed he and Steve had spent hours,
Tony held Steve tighter. He thought he could tell where this story was going, and he was glad Steve was lying on top of him. His weight was comforting. Needed. He ran a hand through Steve’s hair, and whispered, “Then what?” in his ear.
“Anything you want, Tony.”
Tony wasn't a huge fan of Steve's choice, either.  Steve had been in prison then, and even though Stephen Strange had given them a few blissful hours alone, for some reason, it didn't seem right to celebrate on a day they hadn't really been able to be together.
“He’s not that bad.”
“I should have something by then.  If there’s anything to have, that is.”
The cell wasn’t crowded, so that was a plus.
What if the school didn’t accept him?
“Bullshit, Steven. It’s exactly what you meant.”
“Baby,” he moaned, latching onto his neck, sucking at it, biting with little nips that stung just the right amount. “I want...I want to…
When the meetings were over, he’d walk the streets.  He’d put one foot in front of the other, his hands shoved into his pockets, still hearing phantom voices in his head.  One most of all.  No fear in that voice, just bewilderment.  Given time, it would have changed to fear, but there had been no time.  No time for anything except a name: “--Steve?--” Just that.  He’d walked out of the trees, his gun hanging from his hand, his eyes filled with a dreadful worry, and--
Steve finished the letter.
SEPTEMBER, SUNDAY 2:00 AM
He wanted Tony.
“I’m sorry.  I just…”
Steve nodded again. It was enough, he supposed. It had to be. There was no other answer but that plain and simple one.
“No.  No, come here,” she said, and pulled him into her arms, hugging him fiercely.  “I didn’t mean--”
And speaking of that, he needed to shave, and have his mom cut his hair again. It was almost time for his weekend away. And after that, his summer drill.
Steve smiled a dark, slow, smile and shook his head.  “‘
Sam rolled his eyes. “Well, now you’ve both got apartments, with beds, so there should be no need for clandestine grope sessions in some poor unsuspecting janitor’s place of business.” He took a sip of his drink. “Or clandestine anything. Hate to break it to you, but you’re adults. So, why the secrecy?”
Nat made him dance at the reception. She pulled him onto the dancefloor first, wrapping him up in her arms and holding him extra tight. “Thank you,” she whispered in his ear as they swayed together.
Steve’s nearly unintelligible scrawl:
Steve sunk into him, delving into his mouth with no hesitation, just a delicious lust that set Tony’s body on fire. It was the same, but not exactly. His body was broader, harder, his lips soft and warm with alcohol and smoke. He wrapped his arms around Tony and held him tight to his chest, crushing him almost to the point of making it difficult to breathe, but Tony didn’t care. He wanted it. He wanted to be crushed, to be taken so completely by someone he loved so entirely.
Tony sagged against him, secure in the knowledge that Steve would hold him up, and he wasn’t disappointed.  Those arms--those strong, comforting arms--came around him and held him tight.
and that's all he could think of.  Was that what you said? When your partner was shot?
“Why, ‘cause you’re so much stronger than I am?  Christ, what a boy scout.”
“Baxter,” Tony said, and Bruce shook his head.
It was just a warm kiss, soft and friendly, his fingers reaching up to stroke the beard on Steve’s cheek.  Steve hummed with contentment.
“I can’t let you do that, Tony.  You know that.”
“Bruce does that.  Nat too.”
“Mad at you for what?” He shrugged and nudged Tony back. “Not only are you Starks not boring, but you’re also not not-popular either. I’ve known that forever.”
he thought, and that old, familiar shame flooded through him, dampening the desire.
and you can’t stand to not exceed every fucking limitation ever set.”
his face after he read it.  And that was in spite of his intense aversion to spitting.  Why couldn’t he leave them alone?  Ross had served his time, just the same as Steve had.  He wasn’t back in Washington yet, but he could go back any time he wanted.  True, Tony had heard his wife had taken a little sabbatical of her own.  Had moved to Iowa to be nearer to her family while Ross was in The Raft and hadn’t come back yet, even through Ross had been back for six months.  There were rumors of a divorce brewing in the Ross household.  Maybe Thaddeus had told her what he’d done.  He had to have told her something when he went to The Raft.  He couldn’t get away with the company line of bullshit when it came to his own wife.
rain. He remembered it from before, but for some reason he couldn’t remember it lasting this long. Maybe it was just because he was so acclimated to sunny Los Angeles now. Maybe because it had been a long winter already, and now the spring was being a bitch too. Whatever the reason, he found himself feeling irritated and sulky. And that was rubbing off on Morgan, who was usually the sweetest kid in the universe.
“Well, good morning, sunshine,” Sarah said, noticing him standing in the doorway.
Steve’s skin was hot under the fabric.  It always was.  At least that hadn’t changed.  Tony shook him.  Gently.  It felt like shaking a sleeping tiger awake.
“No way,” he objected.  “Nobody said this was for Iron Man.  It’s on the house, dude.  My boss would kill me if he knew I charged
Words trembled on his lips, those three little words that he’d held in his heart for so long, but he held them back.  If he said them, he’d come undone and nothing would be able to stop him from taking Tony away, not just from this dim stairway, but out of the building and down the street.  To where?  It didn’t matter.  As long as the two of them were together, it would not matter where.  And if Thanos did come and the rest of the world turned to ash, it would almost be worth it if he could die in Tony’s arms.
Tony narrowed his eyes at Steve.  “You owe me.”  Steve nodded.  “FRIDAY, let Rhodey in.  And do whatever Captain Virtue here asks from now on, okay?  Pretty please?”
“By whose standards? Are you dating the people you want to date or are you dating the people you think you should want to date?”
“Oh.”
“We can set you up a Workshop here if you want to sleep in a workshop. You can have any of the rooms, whichever works for you. I can bring you dinner there, and we can set up a bed or a comfy couch.” Steve paused to blink at Tony quietly while Tony struggled to find words. “Think about it while we get breakfast… or while you work when you’ve dropped me off after breakfast. You don’t have to decide right now. I’m not going anywhere.”
“So they did end up here.” Said Phil.
“You are sleeping in my bed tonight.”
They were in the middle of the third episode when Clint, Pietro and Steve got back, not that Tony actually noticed Pietro passing through the room. The sound of the bathroom door closing and Clint’s complaints about how he had called dibs on the first shower were the only signs of the presence of the youngest of the Three guys with a Truck. Steve ignored the fracas by the bathroom and perched on the arm of the couch next to Tony.
“My feet feel fine. We can look up signs of frostbite and you can examine them if you like.”
“And there are three, and dragon culture once revolved around them.” The red head said softly, “and now you only have legends about how they worked.”
“Well, I think Pepper will castrate me if I cause you to miss an important meeting. If you want to plan it for as soon as possible though I can pester her for that.” Steve replied.
“What do you like on your pizza?” Clint asked, plopping down on the arm of the couch next to Lucky and Tony’s immobilized feet.
“Hey Obie, broke down in some backwater. Figured I should let you know I’m going to be late getting to Scranton. I know, I know, you told me not to drive myself, but really, I needed to unwind or something…”
“I can see that. Monet’s pieces are beautiful, but until I met Steve I really didn’t know anything about impressionism beyond…well, let’s just say that the idea of wearing a bright red kimono like Madame Monet would never have occurred to me.”
“Steve isn’t our mother, and you just don’t like me seeing Crystal.”
Steve had clearly been expecting to leave town after Danny’s. Tony had asked earlier in the week if it was OK to plan to spend the night in Scranton. Tony studied those wide blue eyes in the surprisingly bright light of the lamps that surrounded Valentine’s ‘Lovers Garden’. Then pulled a wide flat box from where he’d slipped it down between the seats. “This isn’t your actual Present, but I remembered the way you talked about these and thought that it would be worth braving the cold to hang one.”
“I’d much rather discuss our background story for the queen and her court,” Tony replied. “What kinda of childhood do we want to claim?”
“Decorating,” Steve contributed. “The hallway leading to the nursery in the old lair was lined in shields painted with the stories of our ancestors.”
A kidnapping and a rescue.
"Oh, uh I'm Steve. One of the three guys with a truck? More of a cargo van really. I live in a two bedroom with my partners, Clint and Pietro, and with Pietro's sister Wanda."
“About an hour? We don’t know exactly when he dosed you… but it’s been a little longer than that since he grabbed you.” Steve replied. “How are you feeling?”
Tony flicked his wings out to their full extension, enjoying how the wind felt in feathers, then twisted his head around on his long neck so that he could see Phil sitting near the opening to the trillium hall. “How do we do this?” he asked curiously while he admired the iridescent colors the sunlight was pulling out of the feathers that had seemed black to his human eyes. Would a human see any of these colors in the sunlight, or would Phil always look plain to them?
“So what’s it doing broken down?”
“I’ve had lots of chances. I somehow managed to fuck them all up.”
“Steve DOES look just like the guy.” Pietro protested. “Particularly when he does the pose. Do the pose Steve.”
“Aye!” Dugan agreed cheerfully. “We’ll have your new brother-in-law back to ya ina few days, Stevie.”
“You are paranoid.” Steve said thoughtfully. “That doesn’t mean that these strangers might not represent trouble.”
“Nat,” said the dragon whose delicately detailed black trimmed with white wing feathers merged so smoothly into a black mask and a white throat.
“There isn’t much to frame?” Tony sighed. “My dad was a jerk. He wanted us to be just like him, and Gregory obliged. I did too, for a while. It was the only I way I really knew how to be? Mom had tried to live differently, but she died when I was young. Obadiah encouraged the awfulness. With the three of us constantly tearing at each other or drunk, he could do what he wanted with the workers. Greg paid to have me horrifically killed. I didn’t die but I did realize there wasn’t much in my life worth living for. I tried to make some changes at home, and learned that the rest of the family was actually happy with their lifestyles of alcoholism and betrayal. If I wanted anything else I was going to either have to leave, or do it over their dead bodies. So I approached Steve and tricked him into letting me move in here.”
“Obadiah will be suspicious if I tell him I have a bodyguard,” Tony objected.
“There is no shame for you in that story!” Phil protested.
“Not the police,” Steve answered.
Tony was in the repair shop making a list of replacement parts he was going to need when his new phone arrived. He left off the depressing work of examining the damage to his favorite car in order to make a few phone calls. If anyone had been paying attention they would know he made two calls before texting his list to Pepper and heading out to make himself hotel reservations.
“Steven, you may wish to attend to Sir at this time.” The urbane and rather British voice of Tony’s AI PA rang clearly through the speakers Tony had spread through the house, and Steve folded up his sketch pad and contemplated trying to hide the fruit while he was away.
With Clint gone the rest of the group looked at each other tiredly and silently agreed that he had the right idea. Wanda headed back to her room while Pietro walked Crystal home and told Steve not to wait up for him. Only Tony, Steve and Lucky remained on the couch, Tony idly scratching the dog’s ears as Lucky lolled indolently in his lap. “So,” Tony eventually sighed. “What now?”
“I just… when I take it off of you after the reception it will feel like opening a present.” Steve explained.
“Can I come hunting too?” Tony asked eagerly as he tried to find a comfortable way to fold his wings while trotting along after Steve.
“Ceramic, and crushed black opal,” Steve replied. “I wanted something nonconductive, something that would never hurt you. Though I’d still prefer if you wore it on a cord or something when you’re working, just to be safe.”
“Thank You.” Steve watched the Commandos break camp for a moment, then turned his attention to Obadiah. “And how can I help you?” Tony moved with Steve as he shifted into the center of the courtyard. At sometime when the dragons were attending to something else the carriage horses had been taken down to the paddock and the carriage had become a sort of center piece to a second camp site. From his new vantage Tony could clearly see Rhodey and Pepper sitting with Happy at the front of the carriage while Obie approached Steve.
“Well, you should probably try to get some sleep.” Steve replied. “Tomorrow is soon enough to try and figure out who is trying to kill you.”
“We’re all He’s.” Tony snickered.
“So that rude man isn’t your father?” Steve’s relief was obvious and palpable. Tony didn’t have the heart to tell him that Obie was usually better to deal with than Howard.
“Oooh! We should give them a full tour Steve! I bet Phil would love to see the Library, and the Nursery!” Tony exclaimed, then proceed to drag the rest of the newcomers around the Lair, while Steve excused himself to go start on Nat’s room.
“Not Rumiko then.”
“He was just trying to start a fight, and my brother is always willing to provide in that regard.” Wanda responded grimly.
“Yeah. Do you like them?”
“These, uh, hotels…”
“Yeah. Yeah. Do that. I’ll pin down legal first thing in the morning. What are our colors going to be?” Tony asked. “That’s what everyone will ask me right?”
“Don’t get out on your own.” Steve continued as Tony cracked the door open. “The last thing your feet need is to be plunged into the snow.”
“Maybe.”
The farm cart beat the carriage into the courtyard by the simple factor of being too wide to pass on the narrow winding road up the rocks. Happy had always been a calm driver and seemed unfazed by the carriage’s slow process. Tony had heard enough of the angry voices drifting up the road before them to know that Obadiah Stane was less calm about being stuck behind a farm cart. The red headed woman driving said farm cart was completely unintimidated by him, which was rare. In Tony’s experience most people were intimidated by Obie. Once he’d thought it was Obie’s size. Now he thought it was more Obie’s certainty in his own power.
. Too young. Too young for Steve, and definitely too young for Rumlow. Tony was a flirt, and Rumlow would ruin him in a heartbeat. Just because he could.
Tony stuttered out a breath, but he gripped Steve tightly, hugging him. “Really?” he muttered into his neck. “You’re telling me no because you don’t want to rush things?”
“You never ask me.”
Steve nodded. “It’s okay.”
“No, I mean stay
“No.”
“Don’t do that,” Tony said. He put his forehead against Steve’s hard chest, fingers digging into his sides. “You can’t put that on me. Not if we’re not- It’s not fair.”
Steve smiled against him and his hand slipped underneath Tony’s shirt to touch the bare skin of his back.
Strange was waiting for him when he got to the diner.  He wasn’t eating, just sitting with a cup of coffee in front of him.  Tony looked for Pepper and didn’t see her.
.  Don’t move.  Just lie here with me for a second, ‘kay?  Please?”
When he finally pulled away, he rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand. “Sorry,” he mumbled, but Sarah just shook her head.
“She’s Thanos’ daughter.”
“What’s that?”
“And if there are any fringe groups still looking for Clint Barton, you’ll take care of them.  I know there were still a few that were upset with him after what he did during Thanos.”
“It’s not,” he said, shaking his head.  “I miss it, too.”
Sam nodded. “That’s what my mom said too.”
He nodded again, thoughts of Steve--worried, scared thoughts, in spite of what Sam said--taking over everything else. “Okay,” he said. “I’m sorry, but I really do need to get over there.”
She turned to Clint next and he held her with an intensity that bordered possession.  He whispered words in her ear in a rapid jumble that even Steve, who was standing so close, couldn’t hear.
“-I can make it
Thank you all for your support for this story! Your comments and enthusiasm about it just astounds me. THANK YOU!
feel about it?” Tony asked, taking a step closer.
Steve sighed, eyes closing, his body heavy with peace. He turned his face into Tony’s chest and kissed him above his heart. “Favorable,” he mumbled.
Tony’s first inkling something was wrong came when Steve yelled at him for coming home late.
“Then say it.  Say that.  Say exactly that.”
hear?”
This is where he was still at his best.  In the lab, machinery whirring, plans hanging in a holographic haze around his head like tangible smoke, lights brights, music loud, the scents of hot metal and electrical currents in the air.  He could do all the rest of it--the human stuff--but this was always easiest.  This was always home.
“So, that’s it?”
“With Peggy?” Steve asked.  “Just that one kiss.”  He laughed, and the sound was pleasant, a nice laugh, untainted by pain.  “And we weren’t exactly alone.  Or in any kind of position to take it further.  If nothing else, Hydra was one hell of a cock-block.”
“What happened?”
come from? And more importantly, why haven’t we done this before?”
signals. I thought you might be flirting with me, but-” He laughed again. “And I’m supposed to be a genius. I might need to get retested. I’ll book an appointment with somebody in the morning.”
him, really--and Tony wished Howard could have lived to see that.
Tony looked at the red-rimmed eyes that were trying so hard to be brave, but still seemed so fragile.  “What are you not telling me?”
Sarah gave his hair one final snip, then brushed a few strays from his shoulders. “There,” she said. “All done.”
“It’s not what I meant either,” Tony said.  “In spite of how it sounded.”  He drummed his fingers on his desk, thinking.  He cast his mind back over the last week or so, trying to think of something that could have happened, and came up with nothing.  Just a handful of times Steve had acted strangely, but they all seemed like effect, not cause.
Wanda shook her head.  “I told you, I won’t without his permission.  I promised.”
“Aw, you could out-run her.”
Thanks for reading! i love you gorgeous creatures!
The reason was right in front of him.
“Sure,” Steve answered, then glanced down at himself. “I should go clean up first. I look like hell warmed over.”
This was where he belonged.  This was his family.  This was home.
“Are you armed?” Bucky asked, and it was almost casual.  As if the answer didn’t matter.  As if asking if Tony wanted to catch a movie later.
They made their way over to the chair Tony had been sitting in, hand-in-hand. Steve said hi to everyone, then let Tony push him down into the deep softness. Tony grabbed a blanket, then eased himself down into Steve’s lap and wrapped them both up like a burrito. On the screen, there was indeed a sterile-looking space station and a computer now. Tony didn’t think it seemed all that crazy. Hell, Jarvis took care of everything too, and, frankly, a lot of the time, he had better judgement than Tony did. In fact, he started to feel a little bad for HAL. Poor guy. He was just doing what he was programmed to do. Just following protocols. It wasn’t really fair to condemn him for doing his fucking
Steve’s fingers clenched tighter on the pen, then loosened. “Anything else?” he asked the desk-clerk.
“‘Kay.”
than a little relieved when he heard Clint stand up and leave the room. As much as he loved Clint--and he did--he wanted Steve to himself right now.
Very,
“You’re right. We don’t have to. I
Tony smiled distractedly. “Yeah,” he said. “I think about her sometimes to-
“Won’t they be able to see that the blood sample came from a man?” Steve asks startling Tony.
“I am. I want to!”
He’s gone over everything that happened with them a thousand times. He keeps telling himself that if he could only find the moment where it all went to hell then maybe somehow he could fix all of it. He’s spent many nights going over every detail with Sam, poor Sam. But it always comes down to the same thing, at some point, the half-truths and lies became more important than being honest with each other. No matter how he looks at it Steve stands behind his decision to oppose the Accords. That’s one thing he can’t change, but that isn’t their problem, not really. He replays conversations he’s had with Tony over and over again. In each of them, he tells Tony the truth about Bucky, about his parents. Tony’s angry at first, but he always comes around. If only Steve had actually lived out one of those moments.
“Already done sir,” she responds.
Peter shuffles over to him and plops down onto the ground. Matt introduces himself as a friend of Alana’s and Steve snorts, friend, right. Steve’s going to have to check him out.
“I think we already are,” Tony says clipped and short. He can feel the hatred radiating off of Tony.
“Oh, Captain. Hello,” he continues, extending his hand out to Steve. Steve quickly shakes the doctor’s hand and makes his way over to Tony.
Steve lets out a hysterical laugh. “How can I make you believe Tony? There has to be some way.”
Steve wants to keep talking about this, but he looks to Tony and sees the toll everything is taking on Tony. The fight leaves him. At the moment, Tony looks far older than he is. The fight leaves him. He remembers he should be happy Tony is open to anything he has to say. Contributing 50% of her DNA makes him a sperm donor, not a parent.
“Don’t cry, Peter. I’m sorry, I love you,” she says trying to comfort him.
Peter looks like he only took in about a third of what Vision said. Steve, on the other hand, hangs off of every word. The boy shakes his head in confusion and then tries to move around Vision.
“I - I came to see Maria,” Steve fumbles. She looks down at the bunny in his hands and smiles at him. She takes his hand in herself and gives them a squeeze. She looks like she might cry. They haven’t had much of an opportunity to speak and Steve desperately would like to, considering every time he sees her he feels like she’s on the verge of making a confession. He misses her company and her confidence.
“I’ve come to relieve you. Go home. Shower, eat, rest.”
“Ugh,” Peter sighs. “Fine, but let me know how RiRi’s doing, okay?” Peter says eyes softening as he walk to Tony, throwing his arms around him.
“Yeah,” Wanda responds. “We’ve been trying to get her to eat something so she can take her medicine again, but she just won’t do it.”
It must be nice to have someone who is concerned with your well-being, Steve thinks to himself. To have someone who fights with you because they love you and want what’s best for you. No matter what he does, somehow everything he thinks about leads him back to Tony. It’s the house he’s sure of it. He’d been both nervous and excited about coming back. Now he realizes how stupid he’d been. Being back there only made everything worse.
The second they land T’Challa is waiting for them along with the entire guard. He has a concerned look on his face like he isn’t sure what to expect. Steve looks at Tony and sees the nervous energy radiating off of him.
“Can’t you just see the headlines?” Tony said. Steve’s not amused.
They share a sad smile. Alana knows exactly how it feels to lose a mother.

Steve is awoken by the change in the beeping of the monitors. Something is happening and he isn’t sure if it’s something good or something bad. Tony is standing up in front of the screens, hands covering his mouth and tears running down his cheeks.
The more time he spends with Maria, the more he realizes she’s not like other children. It’s a cloudy day, which means Steve can’t take Maria out and that’s fine because Maria’s been sick for a week with a fever and spends most of her mornings curled up in Tony’s arms, fussing and crying. Tony made the decision to work from home, understandably not wanting to leave his sick child. On this particular morning, he leaves Maria in the care of Clint, Wanda, and Nat. The medicine they give her slows her down considerably and Steve isn’t a fan. She doesn’t behave like the little girl he’s come to know. He walks into the living room to find Maria pouting, her little forehead shining as she pushes Wanda’s offering of crackers away.
“Ti voglio bene,” Tony tells her. He tries his best to pour everything he’s thinking and feeling into the hug. “I hope you know how much.”
“I don't want to do this Tony. I don’t want to fight. I’m exhausted. My head feels like it’s going to explode. I have no idea what to do. I need you. We need each other. So tell me what to do and I’ll do it. Our daughter is dying. Everything else isn’t important. I can’t lose her, not like this, not before I even know her. All I want is a chance Tony. I know I messed up. I’m going to make up for it. I promise. But for now tell me, how do I help our little girl?”
“Forgive me. I’m sorry to keep you waiting,” he counters.
“Wakanda. T’Challa will help us.”
“Good morning,” Steve says quietly, surprising Tony nonetheless.
Steve is staring out the large windows when it finally happens. Tony has long since fallen asleep in a chair next to Maria’s bed, his head resting on the mattress. Her voice is so soft, so quiet he almost misses it.
He really doesn’t want to go, but he wants to see Tony. He wants to see how Tony will react to seeing him in the tux. He needs to know if Tony still feels anything for him. He showers, dresses and makes his way to Nat’s room to see if she’ll do him the honor of not having to show up alone.
“Alright,” T’Challa answers.
“Tony, I..”
“I can't guarantee that I won’t hurt you. And not just because it’d bring me a bit of happiness.”
when she wraps her arms around his neck. He hasn’t held any toddlers before, but he feels like Peter’s struggle is justified. She’s surprisingly solid for someone so small.
“This means nothing.”
“It isn’t.”
“What?” Steve asks.
“I came to see Maria. I brought her something,” Steve says, pointing to the bunny.
Tony carves out a bit of time to spend with everyone. Even Wanda, Vision and Tony spend time alone discussing possible ways of helping Vision. He, Clint, and Scott bond over
“Knew what?” he asks.
“Exx-tinc-t,” Maria tries a second time.
“I could call Mr. Stark and see if he’ll approve you?” She suggests in a soft tone.
“No, she’s had a few runny noses here and there, but that’s it. She has an excellent immune system,” Tony says, going over to stand next to Shuri as she opens the pod and uses a handheld device to scan Maria.
Steve finally interferes when it looks like Peter’s going to drop her. He takes Maria into his arms and lets out an involuntary
"I don't know.”
No, there’s no way he’s going to follow in Howard’s footsteps. But he’s also not going to be a fool. Even if it seems to be Steve mission.
“I prayed for help. Things with Steve were terrible. I saw the writing on the wall and I felt so lost,” Tony answers as he rubs his face. “I know you think that our problems started with the Accords, but we had a problem before that. There were little things that just got bigger and bigger. Everything that happened at the end was the breaking point.”
Steve watches Tony’s movements become more and more erratic. He get up and goes to Tony, but as soon as he touches Tony’s arm, he’s shoved away.
Hatred, at a level he’s never felt before floods through him. It makes him want to feel their bones crunch in his hands. It scares him. He’s never felt this way before. You’ve never had your daughter’s life threatened before, his brain supplies. For the first time, Steve feels no remorse. There’s no understanding there.
(See the end of the chapter for
If Tony hears him he shows no sign of it. Steve sighs in frustration. Even now, in tears, Tony manages to piss him off and some how also makes him want to comfort him. He goes over to Tony, who is still clutching Maria’s blanket like a life line. He gets down and picks Tony up. Much to his surprise, Tony doesn’t push him away. Instead, he wraps his arms around Steve’s neck and curls into him. Steve takes them over to the bed and sits down with Tony still in his arms.
He wasn't sure why, but Tony laughed. “She does.”
“What is all this?” Steve asks.
“Hello, could you please let the doctors know we have something for them. It’s urgent,” Steve tells the nurse.
“So then what was the point of taking this sample at the house? They’re going to find out.”
Steve turns to Tony who looks a second away from collapsing. “Why don’t you go lay down in the room, and I’ll deal with them?” He tells Tony.
He’s got a bone to pick with the so called specialist he had flown in. It’s been a day and a half and they haven’t given him anything. For what he was paying for them, they should have already given him good news, or any at all. He doesn’t stop to greet the nurse at the station. He knows he should. Alana always does, but he can’t really be bothered with the niceties. Despite the fact they all probably like Alana a lot more than him, they still greet him.
“Born?” Tony finishes Steve’s bumbling sentence.
“That’s fair. I want you to understand, you are welcome here, for however long you need. Please know no one will pressure you for information, but I do need to know if there is any potential danger towards you and if it should affect Wakanda.”
“Nothing new to tell. I had some specialist flown in,” Tony tells him.
Shuri swipes her hand and the results show up on a large screen in front of them.
“How can I not? Sometimes things just happen. Things that are outside of our control. She’s strong and you need to stay strong for both your daughters.”
“Thank you,” Steve says turning back to the King and accepting his hand.
“Well, I’m awake now. What were we talking about before I fell asleep?” Tony asks in an attempt to avoid the awkward tension that lingers between them.
“You’re gonna let her use a real knife?” Clint asks a bit scandalized. Steve’s confused. The knife in question isn’t very sharp and Maria has a more than decent handle on it.
"Wouldn't do anything for me," Steve tells him honestly. The man nods and walks away, thankfully understanding that he wants to be left alone.
Tony is tired. He’s tired of always worrying, of being angry all the time. He looks Steve with Maria and wants to believe what Steve is saying, but he can’t. He wants to believe Steve’s story, but it’s too convenient. How can he just let Steve walk into his daughter’s life? Steve just said he’d do anything, but what about The Accords. They would keep them apart. Steve would never sign and Tony isn’t sure he even wants Steve too. If he did it would be for the wrong reasons. Tony’s always admired Steve’s resolve. It was one of the traits that made Tony love him. But it would keep Steve away. How can he subject Maria to that kind of life? How can he call himself a good father knowing too well how it feels to live that kind of life?
He cautiously peers into the room and sees the teen sitting on the floor, face in his hand, as he pretends to cry. Maria gets up and throws her arms around his neck.
“Yes, without a doubt.” Steve’s thrown by Tony’s question but recovers quickly.
Steve wipes the tears away from his eyes as he gently pushes Tony’s hand away and sits up. “Thanks.”
It isn't much longer when out of nowhere, they hear a swoosh of air above them and a jet appears. It hovers lower and lower as it becomes visible. The door opens and Princess Shuri exits.
“Yes, I mean it, Tony,” Steve quickly responds. Tony lets out a little laugh.
“Alana, please. I don’t want to have this conversation again. There’s no point.”
“Yes, my daughter. Her name is Maria. Please, we don’t have a lot of time. She’s very sick,” he pleads, voice cracking.
Matt pulls her back into his arms and soon after Peter comes up behind her and wraps his arms as far around both of them as he can. They break apart and Nat comes over, handing Alana a cup of tea as she leads her to an empty seat.
“Tony, I don’t know about this,” Steve expresses.
“For whatever I need huh?” Tony says with a small smirk and raised eyebrow.
They both continue to look on stone-faced.
“Sure I can’t get you anything stiffer than that Cap?” the man working the bar asks.
“She’s grown. She’s a woman now. Three plus years is a long time. A lot happens.”
“Sorry,” Steve says only half listening.
“You’re doing great,” Tony tells him.
“Papa wants to be here too, but Papa is very busy right now. Is it okay if I stay with you instead?” Steve continues.
“I want Papa,” she cries.
“Why?”
It isn’t possible.
“No, it is necessary for her body to accept your bone marrow. We have to lower her immune system so her body won’t reject it.”
That wakes Steve up. Our kids. Steve’s heart clenches in his chest. He tries to stomp down his hopefulness. Tony is tired, he’s not really thinking about what he’s saying. He doesn’t mean it, Steve tells himself.
“But you don’t really want to go,” she adds. She pulls the door closed and links her arm through his. “It would be a shame not to, especially when you’re wearing the hell out of that tux.”
His daughter iss sick.
While getting naked in front of Tony isn’t anything new to him, hell, even stripping slowly and with intent isn’t new to them, but doing it in front of other people certainly is. It wasn’t as if they hid their relationship before, but they never announced it either. It’s strange that only after it’s over should Steve feel the questioning gaze of everyone in the room on them and feel uncomfortable. Although, at this point, it didn’t truly matter considering everyone in the room most likely already know Steve and Tony are Maria’s biological parents. Tony does nothing to alleviate Steve discomfort. In fact, he makes it worse as he wiggles his eyebrows and crosses his arms in a manner that says get on with it, don’t make me wait.
“It’s working,” Tony mumbles into his hands.
Everyone follows Tony to the main entrance and watch as he and Alana get into the ambulance with Maria.
Steve sits up and looks over at Tony, who wastes no time cupping his face in his hands. “All that matters is that you got her the help she needs. The princess is going to help her and everything is going to be okay. We’re going to find the people that did this and we’ll make them pay.”
“Shhh, Steve. Don’t say anything else. Do you have any idea how hard it is for me to have her here, like this, exposed? How hard it is for me to let you close? To either of us? I’m working hard to let you in. Please don’t prove me right by trying to run away from us. You said you wanted to be her father. This is your chance. Don’t waste it.”
“Stop that, Captain.” She rolls her eyes. “We don’t have time for this. Please get in.”
Steve hears Peter grunt as he stands up with Maria in his arms. “When did you get so big? And so heavy?” Peter asks rhetorically.
A shot rings out in the room. It misses him by a mile, but it gets his attention nevertheless. He turns and sees one the doctors point a gun up at him. Steve dives out of the way before she can get another round out. Damn, he doesn’t hit women, but he has to get that gun out of her hands. Steve jumps up and runs towards her, grabbing her by the wrist and forcing the gun to the side. She pulls the trigger and Steve’s ear feels like it exploded, but he doesn’t let it stop him. He reaches over and rips the gun from her hand. He squeezes her wrist bit harder and she crumbles to her knees. Steve releases her and she crawls back to where the other doctors are.
“Hi,” Steve says, jostling her in his arms.
“I did this. I shouldn’t be around her. I only make- ”
“Alana sent me home, I had a drink, and then I ran into that overly-rightous Neanderthal. He was sitting in the living room, looking all sad and lost, and the stupid part of my brain let my guard down. How can I hate him so much, so deeply and yet still want to comfort him when he’s in pain? Why does it still hurt me? Why do I still care? How does he still have so much power over me? God, what the fuck is there matter with me?”
“Yeah,” Steve says regretfully.
“She’s different, Alana. She’s never been weak, but she seems more self-assured now.”
“What happened? Are you hurt? Is everyone okay?” The concern in T’Challa voice is clear.
Tony gives him a look that is one part awe and one part what the hell. All they can do now is wait. Steve takes back the tracker and they make their way to a location that is less likely to be discovered and wait. It feels like it takes a lifetime.
There were times he’d envied Tony's ability to disappear into a bottle. Why should he not be allowed an escape from his problems like everyone else? He’d tried, many times in his lowest moments, but the serum made it impossible.
“Uh, you’ll have to ask Tony. He’d know better than me,” Steve informs her.
“You’re both here,” Alana says walking into the room. “That’s good.”
“Because is not a reason,” he informs her.
“Come on, Captain. We haven’t seen our family in a long time. Let’s go and try and have a good time.”
“Okay, well I agree there, so what’s the thing you’re gonna regret later?”
Steve sits down on the edge of Maria’s bed and pulls out a small grey bunny from inside his jacket. He places it next to her and then takes one of her tiny hands in his. Tony’s simultaneously filled with anger and sadness. The anger wins out.
Steve nods and takes a step back. Tony signals Shuri to proceed.
Whenever Steve feels like he’s lost his way the first thing he does is to go back to the place where he’d gone wrong and try and course correct. He thinks back over every conversation he had with Tony. Yes, he’d been a bit too optimistic in thinking Tony would be glad to see him, but he never imagined Tony would not want him around at all. Then there was Maria. She’s at the root of all their problems. She isn’t a problem, but she’s there at the center of it all.
“Thank you, Jenna. Do you know where they went?”
“It’s okay, angel. Go to sleep. Me and Daddy will be here when you wake up,” Tony tells her. She looks between the two of them. Steve nods in agreement.
"Where are you going?" a voice calls out from the shadows. No one knows how to lurk in dark corners like a Stark. He watches as Alana emerges into the light.
“That your RiRi’s dad?” Peter blurts out like it’s nothing.
“No, I should stay. They’re going to give her another dose soon,” Tony answers. Steve puts both his hands on Tony’s shoulders and runs them slowly midway down his triceps. The gesture is laced with uneasy familiarity. He can feel Alana and Peter’s eyes boring holes into his back. He ignores it and leans to whisper.
- I know Papa. I love you too.
“Tony, get her out of here. I left a tracker on a bench a few blocks away. Go there. T’Challa is sending a jet. They’re expecting you. I’m going upstairs.”
He turns to Steve and says,” Steve do you mind leaving for a minute.”
“Because,” she replies.
“I’m probably not the best person to ask questions. Let go find the princess and see if she can’t explain all this to you and let's see if we can get you some rooms,” Steve says.
They make their way down the main staircase, where guests are checking their name cards, and everyone stops to stare. Where Nat flourishes under the attention, Steve wants to crawl under a rock and hide. He tries to focus on the music coming in through the back doors. She gives him a tug to remind him to put on his mask. He can’t be Steve, tonight he has to be Captain Rogers, Captain America, and Captain America is friendly and happy. He snaps a smile into place.
- You've been here for two days.
“Exactly. I don’t know about anyone else, but I’m starving and my goddaughter’s making those pancakes look awesome,” Rhodey thankfully interjects, breaking the strange silence. Steve clears his throat and aggressively begins piling food onto his plate.
“Tell me that everything is going to be okay,” Tony whispers out, broken and wet. “Tell me that she’s strong enough to beat this.”
“Where are you… okay, never mind I see what you’re talking about,” Tony says as he points to different highlighted areas on the screen. “Am I crazy or are these results saying that her body is attacking itself?”
Its a punch to the gut. Steve feels like all the air has been sucked out of him along with everything else inside him. He looks between Maria and Tony. Maria reaches out and takes his hand in hers.
“Lo so, Papa. Anch’io ti voglio bene.” She pulls away to look into his eyes. “I waited very long to find you and now I not only have a father, I have a family.”
Steve sees a mix of emotions flash across Tony’s face. He can’t figure out what they all are, but for, for the second time since he’s been back Steve thinks he sees his Tony. It only lasts a second, but it gives him a bit of hope. He’s never encouraged Tony’s drinking, but tonight’s different. At least, that’s what he tells himself to justify why he’s pouring Tony another glass. And if it wins him whatever little favor he can get from Tony, Steve doesn’t dwell on that either. He hands Tony the glass and as their fingers brush against each other Steve swears he feels something. He looks at Tony hopefully, but if Tony feels anything he doesn’t show it.
Tony leaned forward and put his forehead against Steve’s knee.  Then there was a hand on the back of his neck.  It was large and warm and soothing.  He’d been afraid of that hand once, not too long ago.  And he’d had a right to be.  That hand had beaten him, had smashed against his face, had nearly killed him.  How could it be that it stroked his skin with such tenderness now?  Such gentle, slow sweeps of a thumb across the top of his spine, such soft caresses through his hair?  Tony didn’t know.  Didn’t care.  He just wanted it to go on forever, and that knowledge gave him courage.
“I’m not accusing her of anything,” Bruce said in a neutral tone.  “I’m just pointing out that she’s not completely innocent.”
“Ready to come out, or do you need a minute?”
“We had to tube-feed him for three weeks because he refused to eat on his own.”  Pause.  “He lost weight.  He’s gained a little back, but he’s still thin.”
He smiled into Tony’s skin.  “Yeah.”
sad. He wanted him happy. He wanted him talking and happy and smiling and laughing. He didn’t like this other way. He still liked
“Probably not.”
“Call me Bucky.”
“I want to,” he said, then shook his head.  “But don’t tell me.  It really doesn’t matter anymore.  Does it?”
“They’re gone,” she assured him when the coughing fit passed.  “Carol, Thor, and Tony got the ones that were left.”
“I’m not a soldier here, Tony. At least not right now.”
He had a few days off, so he came home. She met him at the door when he came in and immediately began snipping at him, telling him he was too thin--even though he had actually gained a little weight since coming back stateside. Telling him he looked too pale--even though he didn’t think he was anywhere near as pale as he had been as a kid. Telling him if he didn’t stop smoking she was going to kick his damn ass for him--even though… nah. She had a point there.
“What about you?  Are you alright?”
“It looked like him.”
Steve just shook his head. He didn’t take his hand away, but he cast his eyes at the ground again, refusing to look Tony’s way.
He nodded.  The relief felt like poison.  “Okay.”
tip Howard out onto the ground. It would never dare let anyone so important look so undignified. “I withdrew my objections to the two of you spending time together,” he went on. “I told him I would pay for his college education. His room and board. His car. His allowance would stay intact.” He gestured with one manicured hand. “Whatever else he needs. Or wants. Within reason. Just as I have always done.”
the same thing.”
. He wrapped his arms tightly around Tony, hugging him with sudden, fierce strength. “I love you,” he said. “God, Tony, I love you so much.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “It’s
Wherever the light didn’t directly hit, the gloom still lingered.  Tony’s eyes searched each pocket of darkness, looking for a shadow that was maybe a little more distinct, a little more substantial.  He didn’t want to just call out.  It seemed too aggressive somehow.  The last thing Tony wanted to appear right now was aggressive.
“Give me time.”
"Steve?"
Tony sighed, defeated.  “I want to know.”
He didn’t look up when Tony entered the room, glass in hand.  His eyes were trained on the bed, indecision spelled neatly out in his posture, the slight cock of his head.
“Steve?” her voice breathless.
“Uh-huh.” And he was. He was good. But for some reason, the tears still wanted to fall. They still seemed to be caught in his throat. He blinked rapidly, trying hard to get rid of them, but they were stubborn. Resistant. Steve could think of only one way to get rid of them, and so he did it. Or said it, anyway. “I miss you, Tony.”
Steve shook his head. “No. It’s never easy losing somebody.” He sighed again. “A team-mate. Or...you know. Anybody.”
They pulled up in front of Nat and Sam’s building fifteen minutes later. They got out, and Steve blipped the horn once as he drove away.
He thought about it. Thought about going to work at Stark Industries. Thought about doing that again. Working.
“I wanted to,” Tony said.  “Come on.  The jet’s right there.  All ready to go.”
Sir Purr arched his back into his touch.  Steve smiled his little half-smile.
“What kind of incident?”
Tony stroked Steve harder, faster.
He cleared his throat.  “Steve?” he called.  “Baby, it’s me.  Tony.  Can I come in?”
“But,
She picked up on the third ring.  “Hello?”  Cautious.  Curious.
"Are you sure you've never heard me sneeze?"
Steve cocked his head. “I think ‘long lost evil twin’ might take precedence over me swimming naked, Tony.”
“Yes, sir.  Have a seat.  Inmate 12439 will be right out.”
He limped into the corner where he’d thrown his sweater and pulled it over his head.
And Steve’s.
Bruce swiped it away, then typed on the keyboard.  The other images from the prison disappeared, as well.
“And that’s what you would have kept telling yourself,” Steve said placidly. “No matter how many people you met at your school, or at Stark Industries, or at the parties and stuff you’d go to for work. No matter that they were all smart like you. And you had way more in common with them. And they fit in with your life better than I ever could. You’d still tell yourself, ‘But I love him. I can’t leave him. I love him.’”
Tears slipped out from under his lashes.  He wiped them away.  “Yeah.  We will.  Hey, FRI?”
She grabbed the hard copy and stuck it in a folder.  “Sorry.”
“It’s true,” Wanda said from within his arms.
“Oh. Okay. No problem.” Tony said, deceptively light, and Steve squeezed him.
“He wasn’t that happy when he left.”
“Then why are you laughing?”
Steve dipped his head and placed a few strategic kisses against Tony’s collarbone before turning his eyes back to Tony. “Which couples? What are you talking about?”
Tony smiled up at him. He looked happy, and Steve’s heart eased a lot more than he thought it should have. “Hey.”
“I’m not. If I was, I wouldn’t tell you I had nightmares and didn’t sleep last night. Just-” he moved Tony’s hand to his mouth and kissed the palm, “-You just gotta give me a little time, okay? A little space to work through this stuff. I’m still learning how to cope with it all without...you know…” he waved his hand in an indistinct manner, but Tony nodded immediately. He got it. Steve knew he would. He had grown up with Howard Stark, after all.
Steve shook his head and tried to pull his hands out of wanda’s.  “No,” he said with a terrible finality.  “No.  I’m not doing it.  I won’t put her through that.”
Tony huffed out a hurt little laugh. “Yeah. Seriously. That’s pretty rude, Steve.”
dangerous, but then Tony would look at him with such desire in his eyes--and something else, too. Something soft and gentle--and then he wouldn’t care about the danger anymore for a while. All he cared about then was making Tony happy. Making them both happy.
“You’re afraid it won’t work?”
Steve laughed again, and pulled him even closer. He kissed his shoulder, then rested his chin where his mouth had been. “I think we both know who I meant.”
“Are you okay?” she murmured sleepily.  “Bruce said Tony was going to look for you.”
Tony stood up.  He hadn’t said anything in a long time, and his face was dark, his brow furrowed, mouth turned down as he studied Steve with an intensity that almost made him uncomfortable.
Don't worry too much about this! I swear we are not going back into the darkness, maybe just a step into the shadows for a second. We have come WAY too far to go back now! Our boys will get their happiness. And I'm not like Steve--I'm promising! :)
one of those in there.  And he was waiting for Tony.
Steve squeezed his eyes shut even tighter and swallowed. The silk against his skin was maddening. “What, um,” he began, then swallowed again, trying to ignore the way the air seemed to hold no oxygen. The way his cock was now straining against his jeans. “What did you have in mind?”
of time. He’d gotten that from Howard. He didn’t think about that either.
“Hey.”
He shrugged.  “With Steve,” he said simply.
Tony took an envelope out of his pocket and pressed it into Peter’s hand.  “Don’t drop this, kid,” he admonished.
--he wasn’t sure what they’d do.  He and Steve could still watch, he supposed, but fireworks felt like a party thing, something meant for a crowd.  He wasn’t sure if it would be as interesting with just the two of them.
That thought made Steve’s stomach feel a little tingly too.
“Wanda and Vision?”
.” He paused and Tony hummed in his ear, telling him that he disagreed but was willing to listen. “I’m not opposed to...movie-making-” the corresponding hum was vastly more pleased, “-but maybe not while your six-year-old daughter’s just down the hall.”
Tony cocked an eyebrow.  “Scared?  You should be flattered.  It’s hot.  You’re hot.” He shrugged.  “Makes sense.”
“Steve, listen to me, ‘kay?  Listen to my voice.  You know me.  You know who I am.  Alright?  It’s me.  It’s
Dodger leapt up, putting his forefeet on the couch, whining in his throat.
He looked up suddenly.  Tony held his ground, but just barely.
“What is it about him?  I look at the two of you, and I just don’t see it.”
Tony brought Steve’s hand to his mouth and kissed the knuckles.  “I know, baby.  I know there’s something wrong.  Bruce and I talked about it, and he’s bringing help, okay?  We’re going to get you sorted out.”
before, but all of a sudden, it felt amazing.
Strange stopped them in the hallway and leaned against the wall.  He looked weary, bags under his eyes, face drawn and pale. Steve would have felt bad for him, but his great reserves of patience were starting to run dry.  He was holding on--just barely--because he had to. He had to hold on to his control, his stoic, almost icy demeanor, because if he didn't, he would simply run mad.  He couldn't do that. Tony needed him to stay calm. Tony needed him to stay strong, and so he did, even though all of mind, body, and soul was shrieking behind that extremely thin veneer of cool calm he had affected.
Tony shook his head against Steve’s chest. His hair brushed the underside of Steve’s chin. “It’s stupid,” he said, and laughed a jagged, bitter little laugh. “My dad and I got into a fight.” He clenched his fist into the back of Steve’s t-shirt, holding him tight. “I didn’t want to stay there, so I just. You know. Came here.”
“Yes, boss.”
“Hey, beautiful,” Tony said.
Tony grabbed another beer from the fridge and sat down in his chair, letting his mind wander.  He hadn’t drunk much since they’d been here.  Just a glass of wine sometimes with dinner, a beer here or there, and this second one felt like an indulgence.  It was funny to think that there had been a time in his life when he'd had his first one at noon, been drunk by three, and high as a kite by eight.  Sipping this one now, he was glad those days were gone, but, he reflected, they'd had one advantage--everything had been a hell of a lot simpler then.
“I can’t, Tony. I’m sorry.”
“I still don’t like it.”
“No.  No, no, this is all you.  It’s concise.  It’s polite.  It’s...you.  It’s better than he deserves.”
Tony didn’t notice. His thoughts were still on Steve. “It’s not for me,” he said, eyes still roving over the watches in the case. It was hard, because everything was beautiful. Everything was pristine. Everything in the shop was something that he might have chosen for himself, but nothing was right for Steve.
Steve and Tony did the dishes, and when they were done, Tony picked Morgan up and hugged Sarah good-bye one-handed.
They had been seeing each other regularly ever since. Tony wasn’t sure how long it would last. He knew it wouldn’t be forever. He was still young. He wasn’t thinking about forever--at least not anymore--but they got along well, and up until this moment, Tony had thought they would at least last a few more months. But now. Well, now he wasn’t so sure.
Steve shook his head without opening his eyes.  “Nothing,” he said.  “I just couldn’t sleep.”
Steve laid him down, and Tony pulled him down on top of him. Now, lying on the bed, their kisses lost some of their urgency, but none of the heat. Steve licked slowly into his mouth, and Tony hummed around his tongue. “What do you want, Tony?” Steve asked, grazing Tony’s throat with his teeth. “What do you want me to do to you?”
Tony reached back and grasped a handful of Steve’s jeans. “Glad you’re home,” he mumbled.
Bunch of free-loaders, anyway.
Tony’s mouth was rough and possessive, taking in Steve’s sweetness.  He wanted to bathe in it, drown in it, die from it.  But he wanted to live forever in it, too.  With Steve beside him, he thought there was a chance he
He thought about some of that stuff while he had coffee with a couple of people after the meeting. They weren’t friends, but they were
But Steve wanted this.
Dodger moved around Tony and sat down beside the bathtub. He rested his head on the rim, looking at Steve with what was undoubtedly a worried expression. Steve put his hand on the dog’s head.
Sam chuckled.  “Yeah, man, I do.  Trying to forget it, actually.”
Steve slowly put his phone back into his pocket.
He just wished Steve was closer.  He wished he dared touch him.
“I’ll see her in a couple days, though.”
not resisting, she’s gonna start to think she can get away with it too.”
Tony ran a hand through his own hair, tugging at it a little. “And we were going to go at eight. Shit. You should have come and gotten me,” he said.
“You mean
“I was going to kill you,” he said.  “I think you deserve it.  After everything you did to him, after all
it.” He wiped his cheek gruffly.
“Tony?” he breathed uncertainly, and Tony nearly swooned with the force of his relief.  He rested his head against Steve’s shoulder.  It seemed too heavy to lift.
Tony took his hand off the box and Steve picked it up. He ran his thumb over the top, where their initials were engraved in entwined calligraphy. The hand still holding Tony’s tightened almost painfully as he opened the box and looked at the ring inside.
Tony tried to pull his hand away, but Steve gripped it with panicky tightness.  “Don’t leave,” he said.
he thought desperately.
Somewhere inside his brain, Tony felt a circuit misfire. Or overload. Or something. Something that made it completely impossible for the words that had just come out of Steve’s mouth to compute correctly. At least that’s what it felt like. Like there was a panel inside his head and it was starting to flash red.
“Yeah.”
“I know,” he said, petting her hair. “I know, sweet girl, but I have to.” He kissed her cheek, then knelt and put her gently on her feet. “But I’ll think about you every day, remember?”
As they made their way back to Morgan and Dodger, the sun broke through the clouds.
They stopped talking, but neither dropped their eyes, flashing daggers at each other in the sun.
“I’m sorry, Tony,” he said, touching him lightly. “I wish I could’ve helped.”
“Someone would care,” he said.
There were speeches and stories and far too many toasts raised in honor of Nat and Bruce.  Far too many glasses of champagne.  Far too many dances.  Far too many songs.  Natasha herself brought the house down with a sultry rendition of Peggy Lee’s “Fever” that left Bruce a stammering, blushing mess, and it was not long after that, the couple decided to make their escape.
“Thank you for your interest in meeting with me.”
“Shut up, Tony,” he commanded.  “Let them finish.”
“Since when?” Tony snapped. He was over being unsettled and starting to get pissed off. His business? That was a fucking joke. “You’ve never given a shit about who my friends are before. You never cared who I went out with, or who I hung around with. Why is it all of a sudden your business?”
“Like what?”
Steve held his hand, kissed the top of his head.  "Damn straight."
Tony inclined his head until their lips met one more time. “I love you,” he whispered. “I want to be with you. If that means I have to wait five years, or ten years, or whatever, then I’ll wait.”
go out. And how nice that would be. That’s all.”
He grabbed a blanket off the back of the couch and laid it over Steve, then he sat down in the recliner.  It was old and ugly, but surprisingly comfortable when he popped the footrest out.
it was his father. It looked like him, but it sure as hell didn’t act like him.
Tony ran his hand down Steve’s chest, smoothing his tie. He knew he was being pretty obvious with his own flirting now, but Steve didn’t seem to mind. Was, in fact, still smiling that little smile. Still looking at him steadily with those dark eyes. Still not moving away, no matter how close Tony got or how long he let his hands linger. “I’ll bet they do,” he said. “I’m sure you have no trouble filling your dance card.”
“Don’t,” Tony said quickly, and his gaze snapped back to Steve. “Don’t, okay? I get it. I get what you’re saying. But don’t say it.”
Steve," Tony shot back.
Tony thought, and closed his eyes again.
going to be alright.
“So what about the kid?” he asked, deciding to just jump right into the heart of the matter. “I’ve got nothing on him. At least not from you. What do I need to know about him?”
The third time was a little different.  He changed his technique, going against the grain, a little slower, a little more careful, a little more thorough.
"No," he muttered.  "No. No, I'm sorry.  I-I have to-I have to go."
Steve jumped to his feet and practically ran to the training room.  He didn’t even bother wrapping his hands before laying into one of the sandbags hanging from the ceiling.  He just lashed out, again and again, pouring all of his confusion and anger and fear into his fists.
it is,” Tony said, and popped the DVD in. When he turned back, he stopped, a flurry of emotions passing over his face in the space of a few seconds as he looked at Steve and Morgan on the couch. Steve met his eye, smiling a little, and lifted one shoulder in a shrug.
Steve and Sarah stayed where they were for a moment, Sarah on the couch, Steve standing by his bedroom door. He could still feel Tony under his hand. Still feel the warmth from his body. But it was fading. Fading.
“Yeah, Mom. I got everything.”
“I, uh, left my glasses in the house,” he muttered, and while his eyes might be a little less than perfect now, there was nothing wrong with his ears.  He heard Steve’s soft snort of laughter loud and clear.  He sunk his teeth into Steve’s shoulder.
Steve swiped a hand over his eyes.  “I ate the last one, so you’re too late.”
“I want to do all kinds of things to you,” Tony answered.  Then, because his curiosity had been piqued, “Have you ever seen it?  The Mona Lisa?”
Tony felt a lump growing in his own throat and swallowed past it.  He smiled.  “You’d better say you love me, soldier.  Or I’ll feed all your Pop Tarts to that damn squirrel you love so much.”
“Dodger left,” she said. “Where are you going?”
“Ignoring me,” Tony said, and Steve couldn’t help it. He shivered.
--in the most intimate ways, it did not compare even marginally to this. The tension and anticipation he knew in the moment of time before his mouth met Steve’s.
“Gone.  We won,” she said, but looking at his ruined body, it felt like a lie.
Tony came around the kitchen island and stood in front of him.  He brushed his hair back.  “No, you’re not,” he said.  “You’re just like a kid on Christmas Eve.”
jealous.”
He was starting to drift.  He could feel it happening, and went with it.  As sleep enfolded him, it wasn’t Thanos he thought of.  It wasn’t Natasha, or Peggy, or Bucky, or even the softness of Tony’s mouth on his.  No, his last conscious thought was of Stormbreaker and that scorching current that galvanized his arm when he touched it.  Could he do it?  Could he possess that much power or would the force of it simply tear him apart from the inside out?  His fingers closed and a phantom voltage tingled through his muscles--inside his muscles, as if it lived there instead of the axe’s haft.
Steve put his hand on Tony’s waist, his thumb edging under his shirt to touch his skin.  He bent down and kissed Tony’s mouth.  It was short and sweet, just a two-second press of his lips, but Tony wouldn’t change it for anything.  “Okay.”
Steve nodded. He was glad. He felt like he had missed most of it too. “‘Kay.”
Finally, after what seemed like a very long time, Howard leaned forward again. He picked up his pen and one of the papers. “If that’s the way you want it,” he said.
“Thanks for everything, Mrs. Rogers,” he said, and she kissed his cheek, petting Morgan’s sleeping head.
guy somehow insulting
"Where do I sign up?"
“I’d like to see that.”
“Tony’s going to be pissed that you stole his chicken,” she remarked, tossing a bone back into the bucket.
Tony knew Steve was with someone. Knew this was just a greeting of two old friends, nothing more, but he could not help the way his hand rose and first ran through his hair, then fisted tightly into it, remembering the way it felt with a nostalgic pang in his gut.
“No,” Steve said for the third time. “I can’t just tell them no. I already told them yes.” He stripped the shirt off, and then pulled the white t-shirt he wore underneath it off too. His uniform shirt was lying next to his jacket. He picked it up and yanked it over his head.
“Ten minutes,” Tony said, and gave him a quick, firm kiss. “We can still go. Just give me ten minutes to jump in the shower-”
Bucky cocked his head at Steve.  “This asshole thinks he’s funny.”
Sarah lifted one shoulder in a shrug. It was very much like Steve’s own. It should be. He’d gotten it from her. “He’s his father,” she said simply.
“I was just thinking about you.”
“Hey, thanks.  This is awesome.”
“Yeah, but--”
was a little new.  Steve didn’t usually get up until 5:30 to get ready for his 6:00 run.  Tony rubbed his eyes.  The sheets around him weren’t straight, but they weren’t a jumbled-up mess like they were when Steve had a nightmare, either.  Plus, Tony had been right here.  If Steve had a nightmare, Tony knew it.
After a while, Tony left a string of kisses from Steve’s shoulder up to his ear. “I felt it too, you know,” he said. “That connection. Right from the start. From the very first minute I met you.”
“Stop it.”
Tony--filled his heart with pride.
baby pictures. He groaned again much more loudly. “God, Mom.
It wasn’t candy, but it was almost as sweet.
“You should prove it.”
.  In every mood, every light, every way.  Smiling, angry, asleep in the bed they’d shared, lounging on the deck with his feet up on the railing.  He saw himself in the lab in the Tower, glasses on, face set while his hands flew over images, correcting, assessing, rearranging.  He saw himself driving the Bentley.  He saw himself as Iron Man, a streak of red and gold, gorgeous and glinting in the sun.  He saw himself on his knees, gazing up, his hair rumpled from Steve’s restless, roaming hands while he took Steve into his mouth.
The corner of the salesman’s mouth turned down in an irritated little frown as if Tony had insulted his middle child. “I think anything larger would overwhelm your wrist, sir,” he said with a chilly edge to his voice.
Steve shook his head. “I’m never telling you anything ever again. You know that, don’t you, Stark?”
“That sounds good,” Tony murmured, and lay back, pulling Steve on top of him. He ran his fingers through Steve’s blond hair, then fisted it in his fingers and pulled him closer, rising up a bit to meet his mouth.
Tony nodded, huffing out a little laugh. He tightened his grip on Steve’s hand. Kissed it again. “Yeah. I thought about that all day.”
The one he would always come home to.
“I don’t believe that, Strange.  Steve didn’t have some dealer on the lake, and I don’t give a
They just let it go.
Steve grabbed him roughly and pulled him onto his lap.  “If you’re gonna kiss me, just kiss me,” he said.
“I’ll stand watch,” Nat whispered.  “You guys wake him up and do it.”
There were tears in the corners of her eyes again, and the look of sheer pride he saw there was utterly blinding. “Yes,” she said, scratching his back with her short nails.
“Yes,” she assured him playfully, “she does.”
Steve laughed.
. Maybe fuck the gardener when I get bored in the afternoons. Isn’t that what rich housewives do?”
age.”
Steve nodded without lifting his head. “Yeah.”
Steve turned back to Tony.  “You don’t have to.”
“Oh, hell no.  It’s not like that.”
“You were with Pepper then,” Steve said.  “I couldn’t.  I wanted to, though, Tony.  I really did.”
“Baby?” he called, but the light was off in the bathroom, the door hanging open.
It got to be a habit.
“Yeah, well, he always was a perceptive little shit.”
“Guess we could watch a movie?”
are you talking about?”
“Good,” Steve said, kissed his mouth hungrily, then moved away. Tony made a disappointed sound, and Steve kissed his stomach before slipping off the bed to kneel at the foot of it. “Don’t, Tony,” he whispered, working the button of Tony’s jeans open and sliding them down his thighs. “It’s okay. I’m gonna take care of you, okay? For real, this time. I’m gonna do whatever you want--whatever I can--to make you happy.”
This is three chapters now. My previous readers should be less than shocked. I'm notorious for adding chapters. I was having too much fun writing these two again to get to the resolution this chapter. So, one more!
…”Make it an honorary one for now.  But when I come back, be ready to dump the new guy.”
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, laughing at the statement and the situation because what the
They were inseparable after that. One unit. Steve and Tony. Tony and Steve. Between the hours of eight and four, Monday through Friday, they were constantly together, and Steve loved every single minute of it.
“I shouldn’t’ve talked to Rhodey behind your back,” he said quietly.  “I’m sorry.  I didn’t think of it as a...betrayal.  I don’t-I don’t know what I thought.”
Steve came toward him.  He was limping.  He had almost shaken the limp, but it was back now.  With avengence, so to speak.  His right arm was in a cast to the elbow, held close against his body in a sling to keep it from moving and disturbing the bone as it healed.  A gash ran up the side of his face and reached into his hairline.  Ugly black stitches held the wound together.
“What happened to him?”
Tony sighed, slumping against the deck railing.  “I was kind of shocked it happened at all.  You know Steve, he’s...proper.  I didn’t think with you guys in the house…”
“What?”
Finally, Steve looked at him, and Tony drew in a sharp breath. He’d forgotten what that felt like. To have Steve Rogers’s undivided attention. How it felt to have those eyes boring into his own, the blue dark and intense. It made his knees buckle.
Thanks for reading! Lyrics are from "Peaceful Easy Feeling" by The Eagles. I don't own them. I just borrowed. I did, however, own the very cassette tape they were on. Or, my mom did, anyway.
, Tony thought.  To FRIDAY, he said, “Keep 713-B active, ‘kay?”
Steve walked out of the gym.  Tony followed, staying a step behind him the whole way.  When they reached the stairwell and the door closed behind them, Steve reached for Tony’s hand.  He gave it reluctantly.
He gave her an obscenely large tip.
“No. You’re done.”
“Fair enough,” Tony said.  He put the soldering iron down and adjusted some miniscule bit of wire by hand.  “It’s none of my business, whatever’s with you and Nat,” he said.  “I didn’t mean to say anything bad about her.  You know that, right?”
When Steve still didn’t let go, Tony pressed his lips against his broad shoulder.  Steve was shaking.  His skin quivered under Tony’s lips.
Steve just shook his head, looking embarrassed but happy, and Tony couldn’t resist wrapping his arms around him and squeezing him tightly. Steve tucked his head down onto Tony’s shoulder.
“Yes.”
He liked the car.  He liked the way it felt, like a tank in a battlefield, solid, safe, dependable.  It rode smooth over the road, eating up miles and taking up space.  It wasn’t exactly eco-friendly, but he kind of liked the looks he got when he drove it.  Both the admiring and the scandalized.  They made him happy in equal measure.
"I can find him," Clint said.  "Wanda wants to help, too. And Bucky."
“Bruce and I don’t count.”
“Tell me about it.  Tell me everything about it.”
“It might be.  But don’t tell Steve.  I don’t want him getting upset if it turns out to be nothing.”
“I’ll call the jet for you.  At least let me do that much.”
“Are you staying with your mom?”
Steve lifted his head.  “That’s me.”
“You are a cruel, cruel man, Steve Rogers.”
Already lost.
Steve turned the volume down, then sat back, uncertainty speeding up his heart.  He should wake Tony up and send him to bed.  FRIDAY could keep watch and let Steve know that he’d gotten to his room alright.  There’d be no need to stand him up and put an arm around him and help him down the hall himself.  No need to lay him back then kneel and untie his shoes and toss them into a dark corner.  No need to slip him between cool sheets, and certainly no need to slip between them himself.  The fact that every inch of him cried out for him to do all of those things did not make them necessary.
“We just got Tony back from a kidnapper. We should wait until he wakes up and let him decide what we do next.”
“No. I got a lot bigger when I became guardian of my third of the… what were they calling it? The Goober? I guess I could start teaching you draconic pronunciations.”
“That too, but mostly it would mean that I got to see you every evening.” Tony thought about that for a moment, thought about quiet meals like this one shuffled in amongst the crazy family pizza nights he had already experienced with Steve’s crew. He rolled the idea around, compared it to his usual habit of cold pizza when prompted and smoothies when they were placed in his hand while working and he felt this deep and desperate surge of
“I don’t think I’ve ever seen this. Is it any good?”
“Why does that matter?”
“I wanted to go all out for you.” Steve said seriously.
"Great. Se you in a few hours."
“She would make a terrible sister in law. Your relationship is too volatile.”
“No one likes going to the hospital, but sometimes it’s necessary.” Steve argues.
“Yeah… which hotel are you at? I can drop you there and go see if someone needs help.”
“We shouldn’t tell them about the artifacts.” She said firmly. “We should have some other story… Maybe… Tony, Clint and I are siblings. Tony came here to be your mate, we came to keep him company, and Phil came to stay with his mate Clint.”
“I… don’t know… I can’t imagine… the way that thing is in him…”
“Natalie was going to call them in.” Clint added.
“Yeah?” Steve replied.
“That’s really good.” Tony said thoughtfully. “It’s a good fall back for when Steve or Phil knows something completely differently from us. We three had the same upbringing.”
“Tony, No.” Steve begged.
“It’ll just be more nightmares.”
“Only because the circle was violated by supporters of your enemy as soon as it was clear the murderer was losing! And the council allowed the challenge to be interrupted! Instead of excising the murderer’s dishonor every one of them was tainted by it,” Phil practically spat the words, as if they left a bad taste in his mouth.
“Talking about lack of skill with human language…”
Steve followed the rose petals in to see a massage table set up in front of the large glassed in shower area and a tub big enough, not just for Steve, but for Steve and another person. “I’ve never seen a bathtub that big.” He said quietly.
“I … should probably pick things like that up.” Tony agreed hesitantly. “Would you mind taking me back over to the Stop and Shop? I think I saw stuff like that there.”
“Then that’s what important isn’t it?” Steve asked. “And if she hurts you we’ll find a way to beat her up for you whatever kinda of secret agent or spy she happens to be.”
“I’m not sure if I should say ‘Sorry’ or ‘Thank You’,” Steve replied in a rather bemused tone.
“Round peg in a square hole?”
“Rachel was a feminist protester. I met her at a rally, and I thought she was just amazing. Brave, opinionated, completely unafraid of standing up for what she believed in… I find that really attractive in a person.” Steve faltered for a moment, then continued. “We’d been dating for a while. I’d actually moved out of the apartment I’d been sharing with Clint and moved in with her. Out of the blue she brought up this idea that we should try bondage, and I was just… No. Just a flat no. I’ve spent time strapped down for unwanted medical procedures and the idea of being tied up is just not… sexy.”
“Very much so. I’ll tell you all about it tonight.”
“He was just a barking dog. There was no need for a scene like that one.” Wanda scolded.
“No… umm… something good actually…or at least, I hope everyone will be happy for me.” Steve stuttered a little.
“It didn’t work at all.” Phil replied. “They spent decades with your clan home abandoned while the whispering and rumors of corruption grew, and were certain enough of their might to invite representatives of all the other clans to the renaming, when the old medallion was torn down and the new placed. As soon as the cavern was claimed by its new owners the caverns rang with noise, as if we were hearing every scrape of metal on rock since the first tunnel was excavated, then a thundering roar as if every dragon who had ever lived there screamed the word murderer at the same time. The caverns shook as if in the throes of a massive earthquake and many hallways and balconies collapsed under the strain. When it was over, and we all dug ourselves out, it was revealed that every book and treasure which had been stored there in its centuries of habitation had vanished without a trace. I was still a squire at the time, but I asked my Knight if he still had faith in the judgement of the high council when even the stones we walked on were wise enough to see the corruption of their decisions. The fact that none of the elders of any of the clans called for an investigation of
“I’m fine.” Steve assured him. “I don’t really feel the cold.”
“Yeah. Yeah it does, gimme another.”
"I'm doing illustration. Wanda is into Statistics and Chaos theory."
“That sucks. All three of them created beautiful paintings. They deserve to be part of the legacy.”
"Months?"
(See the end of the chapter for
“My girlfriend is coming to meet me here. And I want it to be perfect… I haven’t been… around a lot… this last, um few months… I had a … thing… overseas that… uh… took a lot longer than I expected. Things have been distant with Rumi since I got back. It doesn’t take much looking around to think ‘Hey, this looks like the perfect place to reconnect.’” Tony settled his bags of chocolates, Flowers, and bottles in the back of the van.
“Is he as good as Monet?”
“What’s good for me isn’t important. The important thing is that whomever I marry is good for Stark industries.”
“I guess so? I’ve never had anyone want to keep dating after the lies start coming to light.” Clint responded.
“I was going to call S.H.I.E.L.D. once Alexi left with the thing…”
“Ah.” It turned out that Clint was right about the coffee, and the Frostbite check-up. No one in the apartment shared a bed, both bedrooms held solid wood, handmade looking bunk beds. Everyone but Pietro was single and there was a lot of arguing over whether Crystal counted as not being Single. Steve insisted that Tony sleep in his bed. Tony tried to argue for the couch, but Steve was immovable. Tony was a guest. He would sleep in a bed. Steve even changed out the sheets and blanket, so they would be clean.
“Did any of them make you happy? Really happy?”
“Why don’t you shove it in the player then,” Tony asked. “Did you guys at least get to eat?”
“Oh. Yeah. Of course it’s a yes Steve. Did you really doubt that?” Tony asked in return, while losing his battle with the tears.
“He had no interest in your nuptials? I can see that. The boy has always been completely self interested… he is rather like his father in that regard.”
“How should we go in?” Pietro asked.
“We should get moving.” Steve stated firmly, choosing to pay attention to Crystal’s response rather than Clint’s. “I’ve got the phone. We will call you if anything changes. You do the same.”
"Three guys with a truck?"
“Aww, come on Steve.” Pietro whined. “I’ll bet Tony has read some of those comics, or seen the Smithsonian exhibit, or something. He’ll see the similarity if you just do the pose.”
“Hey, Hey, no need for that,” He caught Tony’s elbow, reflexively steadying his boyfriend. “I didn’t mean to startle you. What had so much of your attention?”
Behind him Tony heard the scrabble of claws on stone. He didn’t take his eye from his seeing device, but he did reach out one hand. Soft feathers skimmed beneath Tony’s reaching fingers for a moment, then Tony’s hand was resting on his best friend’s wing. He lifted his head to admire the rough edged blue scales and for a moment his mind flashed back to his years in school and the taxonomy charts he had never had any trouble memorizing. What would his instructors have thought of the creature next to him? Hard scales protected the vitals, bright blue on top, creamy underneath. Feather edged protoscales slipped down the spine, raised now with curiosity. Bright red tipped the crest feathers that were currently fluffed up in a display of interest. The red was normally hidden by blue and black protoscales- razor sharp impediments to making a grab for the back of that long neck. True feathers banded in distinct lines of blue, black and white covered the wings, making them the least protected part of the dragon next to him. A concession to flight efficiency and speed, Tony thought. Would taxonomists decide that dragons were birds rather than giant lizards if they could get close enough to truly examine a live specimen? Tony rather thought they existed in a space between birds and reptiles, showing that the two must have been connected once, but biology had never been his favorite of the sciences.
