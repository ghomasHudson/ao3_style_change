“Bedside drawer,” Tony nodded. Steve reached over and opened the drawer, shuffling the contents around until he pulled a fresh tube out.
“I just don’t want a body count to be our only legacy,” Tony added quietly. “This isn’t a mistake.”
“My name. I told them my name.”
That must have gotten the attention of the rest of the strike team, because Steve heard them pounding up the stairs. Steve barely had enough time to bring his shield up before more bullets were piercing into his apartment. Unable to find a way out, Steve crashed through his window.
“You’re gonna trust that asshole?!”
Fury leaned forward, his elbow resting on his knees. “Do you remember what happened to you?”
Tony laughed harshly. “There was no strained relationship. That’s because there was no relationship. Surprised your best buddy Howard didn’t mention that.”
he hissed in return, grabbing at Steve’s hip so they can grind their hips together. The pair parted, only long enough to shred the rest of their clothing. Tony marveled at the miles of Steve’s pale skin, littered with scars and memories of his battles and victories. He looked down at Tony, his blue eyes radiating in the glow of the arc reactor. He was so beautiful.
“He thinks that once Iron Man is dead, he’ll never have been sent back here. He’ll just vanish I guess. He’d be back with his wife.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “Are you kidding me? I’ve wasted all my small talk on you.”
Steve frowned. “I need to hear it anyway.”
Steve pecked the inside of Tony’s palm. “I know, I-I just…” Steve broke off with a sigh.
he had said.
Tony’s body arched up against the bed before flopping back down, the EKG still flashing red.
He cried out in pain, the close heat from the repulsor beam too close to Tony, the external metal from his own gauntlet warming, starting to burn against his skin.
“Don’t,” Clint hissed. He was currently curled up in his bed, the only thing visible was a greasy head of hair that hadn’t been washed in a few days. Bucky could only count his blessings that Clint was facing the other way; Bucky knew that he wouldn’t be able to survive another look from that broken face.
Echoing gun shots and screams bounced around him as he stepped back into his car.
Stark steeped his head in his hands. “They’re Hammer’s right?” When Natasha nodded, he continued. “Was he buying or selling?”
“So, you agree with me,” said Tony. “You don’t think you should be here. You don’t think
He hopped out of the car and looked around, trying to pinpoint anything that was out of place. But the rundown buildings just stared back silently, refusing to give him the answers he wanted.
Fury gave him a stony eye, but nodded. “Alright Stark, you’re up. Take Romanoff and Rhodes with you. Get it done. And you,” he pointed back to Clint as he walked out the door. “You and I are going to talk.”
“Good,” Steve retorted. “We need answers quick. We’re running out of time.”
Stane eyed him warily. “Desperate men are capable of many things.”
After that day, Steve had brought Tony to the hospital, standing vigil until his love was healed.
“Huh,” Clint remarked, looking at a small frame hanging over by the bar. “Old fashioned is right; I don’t even know what this means,” he said, pointing at the sign. “’Go Ugly Early’? What the hell kind of an insult is that?”
Tony came up behind Steve and clapped a hand on his shoulder. “Oh, Joe here- well, he’s a- ”Tony paused, looking at Steve.
He pushed another button to open the gangway, smoky air filtering into the cockpit. Steve grabbed his shield and took a deep breath.
An awkward silence fell over the two men.
It worked the same way for Clint. Steve’s heart would always break a little when Clint would just gape at him when Steve agreed with his field strategies. It was if the archer had no idea why anyone would take his recommendation, use his maneuvers. Which was completely ridiculous. If anything, Clint Barton was the most skilled tactician Steve had ever had the pleasure of knowing. Steve would go down to Tony’s lab, just to watch him and Clint bicker over Clint’s arrows. Clint would always tell Tony exactly what he needed, what would work, what wouldn’t. In fact, there had been a couple times where Clint had just looked at an arrow made by Tony, and just shook his head.
“I guess I’ll forgive you,” chuckled Tony.
“He’s not here,” Sam replied. "
Steve checked his watch before starting the engine, pulling out into the street. He had left early, but Sam’s pestering accompanied with his own jumpy anticipation had the man driving to his engagement with ample time to get there. Lord knows he had a lengthy laundry list of instances where he'd been, well, late. It was a work in progress.
Steve thought morosely, chest throbbing for the missing limb that was Tony. Because he couldn't take in any comfort that Tony was still alive. Because defiant, stupid,
“Well, let’s hear it.”
Sam nodded. “Well, Nat’s informants gave me another tip.”
Steve furrowed his brow as he traced the outside. That didn’t make any sense. Tony hade finished the renovations from the New York invasion years ago. So unless the Tony had an experiment go wrong, there was no excuse for the-
Tony checked his watch. “Yeah, the jet leaves for England within the hour, I believe.”
From: Sam Wilson
Tony felt a tear of his own slip down his cheek when Steve finally did speak.
But that all seemed like a dream. Like ever disliking Riley, thinking of a time in which Steve and Stark were at odds was almost inconceivable. Sure, he could list a million reasons why they shouldn’t work, but here they were anyway, working.
“What?”
“You’re sure? Steve, I- ”
“That’s your name, isn’t it?” Tony prodded. “Steve. Steve Rogers.”
“You so as much even think about pulling that trigger, I’ll kill us both,” Steve gasped.
“Well, I’m always on board for that,” Steve murmured. “Besides, we’ve got our own problems. The Monger is still out there are we don’t know how he connects the Ten Rings to HYDRA.”
He saw a ball of energy form between the two of them, growing erratically as the power built. He could see when Obadiah caught on to his wavelength, the orb growing right in front of him. Exothermic reactions: the heat needed to go somewhere.
Unconsciously, Tony grabbed at a dirty frying pan that had been resting in the sink, waiting to be cleaned. He realized that he probably should go for something with a little more bang – it wasn’t as if he didn’t have a multitude of guns waiting downstairs for him in his workshop. But he didn’t bother. If this was a home invasion, a sick part of Tony hoped that he would get caught in the crossfire.
Steve couldn’t help but snort. He knew Tony was just saying these things to lighten the mood, but despite knowing, it still managed to work every time.
“No time to explain, but I think I broke your boyfriend.”
The blonde had crumpled, knees on the floor, head cushioned between his two hands. His shoulders shook, and
Tony whirled back around, facing Steve.
“I can’t in good conscience- ”
“You have to read at the table? Since when are newspapers still even a thing?”
, that’s right, a bow and arrow, was a better shot than Tony could probably make with a gun and a scope all while standing right in front of the man. The wound was clean and downright perfect; minimum blood loss, but maximum damage.
“Tony, maybe you should go lay down.”
“Yeah,” he answered. “It’s Obie.”
“You won’t get anywhere,” replied Thor. “Throwing a few fists at him will not get him to show his weaknesses.”
But no matter how different they were, they were all the same. They were good. They were heroes. They were what Steve wanted to be when he grew up.
Everyone walked around with their heads in the cloud, like they didn’t have a care in the world. There was so much more that this century can offer, that people had no idea that they’ve lost so much more.
And now, because of Steve’s stupidity, he may have just lost his lover to an explosion. Again.
Tony ducked on autopilot, narrowly missing the man’s fist. He scrambled away quickly, arms going up defensively, but Tony could see that despite the outburst, Barnes didn’t really want to fight him. Tony looked around the room once more. Clearly, he and Barnes were the only ones left in the building, but if The Commandos were gone, why the hell was Barnes even here?
Steve’s eyes softened, obviously following the same thought train, as he tugged at Tony’s chin, pulling it up enough so their lips could meet in a tender kiss. “Kansas,” Steve breathed when he finally pulled away.
Fury narrowed his eyes, obviously displeased that he couldn’t see the ace that they were holding. “Fine,” he agreed. “I get you to confirm the SSR files for me, you get Coulson. That is,” he continued, “only if we manage to bag Pierce. I have more than enough testimonies against the man, but I need evidence. The man knows how to cover his tracks. The only thing I have him cornered on is suspicion of domestic violence. His live-in housekeeper was very specific,” Fury stated. “It would be enough to keep him behind bars to search his house and personal affects, but I need back-up in case his stuff comes back clean. If I can prove that he altered the files for his own benefit, we’ll be golden.”
Steve peered back down at the address written on the page.
Steve nodded. “Thought you might be hungry. Fair warning, though; I’ve never made a hamburger myself, before. Although, I’m pretty sure it’s just a flat meatball, so I think I’ll be able to figure it out.”
“News,” Bucky murmured. “They’re burying that girl today.”
Rogers squinted down at the map, making sure he had the right address.
Bruce sighed. “No, I guess not. I’ll throw a test together. See if you can find anything else for me.”
The Captain leaned forward from the rear seat, giving a small smile. “Maybe it’s just age.”
How would Obie react? It wasn’t like Obie didn’t know that he dabbled with mobs, just as Tony knew that Obie didn’t have a problem with it. Hell, Obie was in the process of trying to convince Tony to start
“Steve?”
“So?”
of our listeners stand with you, and pray that you will find peace.”
“Steve, please. This really is not the place. Let’s go- ”
The man gave a small smile, holding up a cup of tea. “I come in peace.”
Tony rubbed at his temple. “Numbers?”
They did miss something;
“It’s amazing that you two made it out,” Tony continued. He knew what he'd said, what he'd shouted and screamed at Rogers. That it was his fault the SSR was dead. But he knew it wasn't; maybe it was just another thing Tony tried to blame the blonde for. When he'd backtracked through to find the SSR, he caught the whiff of the mole, but he couldn't figure out who it was. Sure, Rogers - and apparently Barnes - were the only ones that survived, but Tony couldn't imagine it being them. It was strange to have such blind faith in the men that had lied and deceived him. He was so convinced throughout his life that it would have been Rogers that was the mole; but now, having a face to the face, seeing him and his number two interact, see the devotion and pride with their current mob, it was if he couldn't fit the final piece of the puzzle in. There was no way either of them were the mole.
Bucky shook his head, eyes not leaving where they were loading Steve on a stretcher. “I’m not going anywhere without him.”
“I’m allowed to have friends, Sir,” Phil hissed. This was not good. This was definitely not good. With Fury poking around, who knows how long it would be before something slips out of Phil’s mouth. For all he knew, Fury already asked him when he was drugged out of his mind.
Clint nodded before slinging his arms over Tony’s shoulders, assuming his usual position. He made sure Clint was secure before blasting up into the sky.
He walked over to The Captain’s desk, tearing out drawer after drawer until Tony found an extra side arm. He could hear yelling from the other side of the office door, but Tony paid it no mind. With any luck, someone out there was giving The Captain all the shit he deserves right now.
Steve let out a hum in agreement, Stane snapping his attention over to him.
Stark gave a hollow laugh. “I could say the same for you.” With that, Tony’s leg jutted forward, giving Steve a sharp knee to the groin.
," smirked Clint.
This was supposed to be all fluff, but WHOOPS, turns out I'm incapable of writing without adding angst. Also, I know I have a billion other fics to work on, I just wanted a billion and one, so don't @ me.
So yes, when Clint had disappeared Steve was devastated. But now he’s back,
“Yes,” Phil wavered, his body as tight as a coil. “He’s an old friend from school.”
“No,” Barnes agreed. “And you probably won’t by yourself. But you and Steve managed to find them once. You found them together.”
Tony shushed him. “I know,” he smiled. “So why say anything?”
Natasha pointed to the curb. “The catch basin. When it rains, it catches the water and brings it to the sewer. Where there’s catch basins, there’s storm sewers. Find another one of those and we’ve got another way in.”
Clint shot his friend a jaunty salute, before tearing up the stairs, his fingers dancing across the phone’s screen.
Steve must have been on the same wavelength, if the way he whispered
Bucky watched as Clint grinned, almost feral, before letting an arrow fly. The choked shout that followed was all the proof Bucky needed. Not that he actually need any; Clint never missed. Bucky turned and saw the man twitching helplessly on the ground, long arrow piercing out of his upper left shoulder.
Someone was screaming.
“Pierce. Alexander Pierce.”
Steve huffed out a laugh. “I’ll call you when I’m back home, alright?”
Tony whispered with watery eyes. But Steve wasn’t finished.
Tony stopped, sighing. “Well, I’m sure your boss will retract his offer when I show up. This works out better if you let me go alone, actually. Cap will be pissed, HYDRA will be dead, and then I’ll be gone. You’ll have to find someone else to hate.”
A man came tearing through two steel doors, panting loudly as he sprinted down the hallway. He ignored the looks of the armed guards, focusing only on the entrance to the back office.
“Ms. Potts,” Steve sighed. “We can sit here and talk all day about this, but we really need your help. Tony’s in trouble, and just sitting around here isn’t doing him any favors.”
“You sure?” Stark had boasted all about how he could bring weaker men to their knees without so much as taking a swing. And while Steve would be foolish not to believe him, there was a heavy layer of uneasiness that sat with him. He didn't doubt Stark's skills, but who was really to gain here? What he said he could do to their prisoner with only a computer - how long before he does the same to Steve? To the crew? Stark's full skill set was unknown to him; the man himself was a ticking time bomb. Trying to keep any control of the situation with his methods was the only way he could think of to potentially keep the mouthy brunette in line.
Natasha nodded. “He’s right. Throwing a curveball like this is the best chance to catch Loki off guard.”
With that, Tony thrust his head forward, catching The Captain off guard with a strong head butt. The huge man fell backwards, tipping over the chair he had been sitting in. Wobbling forward, Tony didn’t hesitate to bring his hands around in front of him, freed minutes ago by his deft fingers. Taking The Captain’s surprise to his advantage, Tony hopped up, jumping over him to the door, bringing his iron chair with him. The blonde tried to grab his ankles, but a well-timed kick to The Captain’s groin had the man doubling over in pain.
“He’s gone,” Thor sounded out. “Chipped the stone right out from behind his chain.”
“Thank you,” he said quietly, once they’d both quieted down. “For doing this for me.”
the asshole was sauntering – out of the room. “Barton, you flying?”
“Tony,” Obie drawled, gaze turning towards him. He stood in the center of the lobby, the room completely ablaze around him. The gauntlets he wore were massive, looking like mutated boxing gloves, traveling all the way up to his elbows. There were wires weaving around the twisted metal, connected to Tony’s other arc reactor, laying like a mockery across the man’s chest.
Rhodey laughed in response. "Yeah, you're right. But this is some serious stuff. I can call my superiors, ask for an extended leave? I'm not sure if- "
Steve ignored the pinky finger that Tony extended. “I wasn’t aware you still kept in touch with your other associates,” he said with a frown.
Tony hissed, chasing after the man.
he thought.
“What can I say, I made some new friends,” Phil couldn’t help but sneer back.
“Or a few days,” Bucky murmured, looking at the cot.
It wasn’t the fight. Of course it wasn’t. He and Steve had fought much more over much less. It wasn’t that. Maybe it was the realizations. The fact that he couldn’t lie to himself anymore; that he can’t pretend to not see his father every time he stepped in front of the mirror.
“This is The Captain,” Tony interjected. “But I’m sure you already knew that.” Tony turned to face the group again. “I’ve given Yinsen all of your files, redacted, of course. It’s just so he sees your face as a friendly.”
He could feel the weight of Natasha’s stare on him, but Steve refused to meet her gaze, shifting in his seat as he tore through traffic, speeding down the highway.
Tony any day, but Tony in a suit could always make his heart race. He’d lost way too many a sketchbook to this look. Maybe it was the way that the expensive fabric wrapped around him, fitting him perfectly. Or maybe it was the way that he seemed to have a suit for any occasion. Casual suits that were worn with graphic tees and high tops, things that shouldn’t work together but
Clint was out of the car in an instant, dashing towards the calamity. “Clint, wait!” Tony called, following right behind him, grabbing at the other man’s arm.
His Mama would say it was fate,
“The longer we wait, the more the rubble could shift. We need you here to get to them. Please, Steve.”
was born.
“They won’t leave.”
Steve was faced with a frazzled looking man in a business suit. The way the suit formed around him, Steve was sure that the tailor must have sown it right onto his body, it fit so perfectly. Everything about him was flash; it was like the man was the personification of Stark Tower itself: showy, sleek, but fake.
Steve startled from his thoughts, piling in the vehicle that Bucky had already started. “Where are we going?” Steve asked as Bucky weaved effortlessly though the streets.
Yinsen stumbled back over to him. “You could not know that this would have happened.”
Steve huffed out a laugh. “Is that so? Better than a Rogers homecooked meal?”
“Has it really been that long?”
That was Fury. She must be at the front doors of their man briefing room. She frowned, weighing her options.
“Yeah, but last time I checked it doesn’t take this long to heal from a bullet wound. Come along, Coulson.”
The Commandos had been their saving grace. Not just for Steve; Bucky found himself unbelievably codependent on the rag-tag group of criminals they threw together. They were the glue that held him and his best friend together, and by all accounts, are the very reason they’re both still alive today.
“I’m saying that this man has to be HYDRA.”
“Steve,” Tony started. He definitely didn’t want to get into this age old agreement.
“Clint. Clint,” Phil snapped at the disheveled man. “Where’s Steve?”
Tony looked wary, but Steve slowly nodded. He had heard no complaints from Natasha either. It was worth a shot. Clint visibly relaxed before leaving the room, making his way to the other side of the glass.
Steve stared at his new business partner. For just watching a man kill himself, Stark looked remarkably calm. However, Steve could still see some uneasiness hidden behind his brown eyes. Steve knew he had the same look in his own. “Any thoughts?” Steve prompted.
“Well, we do now! Or might, I’m not sure. This is why I need you to scope it out for me, see if there’s anything there," Tony answered. "Shouldn’t take any more than a week. Come on, when’s the last time you’ve had decent fish and chips?”
Unwanted images of Tony bleeding out on the floor next to him, whispering unheard words in the rumble of the pending explosion filtered through his mind. He could see why Tony would have wanted to face the end together; he himself wanted the same. If anything, Steve should have been faster, should have been better, so he could have made his way back to Tony.
was left unsaid.
The Captain shook his head. "It's nothing. It doesn't even hurt."
The elevator beeped its arrival and Clint stepped on, the metal doors cutting off the rest of the conversation.
“Uh, actually, let Stark lead the team. There might be more explosives there that we might need to defuse,” retorted Clint.
Rage poured through Tony’s veins like icy fire. They were going to pay.
Steve was pounding into Tony in earnest now, trying to pull him impossibly closer. With one particularly hard thrust, Tony came, painting both men’s chests. Steve felt Tony clench around him, sending Steve spiraling over the edge as well.
Tony hummed in response, dropping his head to rest against Steve’s collarbone, looking down at his fingers trailing over his chest, tracing a design that only he saw.
splatter, wouldn’t it? And through it all, I’ll do it with a smile.”
“I know, I know, I’m not supposed to tell you and you’re not supposed to tell me,” he snapped in reply. He was more than aware that a threat from Fury was not to be taken lightly. “I just, I- ”
Clint looked away, rubbing hand through his hair. “I don’t know how to tell you. I asked Delmar how he got they managed to get the bombs into SI, and well, he used to work there.”
Schmidt rolled his eyes dramatically. “Cap, you’re always saying be true to yourself. I’ve figured out who I really am, Cap. I’m a hero, just like you!”
There are so many markets that we’ve been idle in for years, pouring our entire R&D into weaponry. We could change that. We could change the face of the company!”
“Alright, that’s enough,” Fury sighed, sensing a fight coming. “We’ll meet on this again next week. Get some rest; you deserve it.”
Bucky thought to himself, mentally adding another item to his to-do list. “Uh, no,” he finally answered. “I think I’m alright. I’m pretty jittery, but I think it’s just an adrenaline rush. The new reactor has a higher cycling rate, so my body’s trying to adjust. I’ll, uh, let you know if anything changes.”
Tony groaned, but answered anyway.
“You gonna tell us about your little fieldtrip this morning?” Bucky drawled, kicking his feet up on the table. Tony and Steve had been gone for hours, sitting and debating with Fury about how they could all get a semblance of what they wanted. Unfortunately for all of the men involved, none of them were good at compromising. They’d settled on an arrangement in the end, but even now, Tony wasn’t completely on board. He and Steve were, surprisingly, able to get Fury to agree to their major concerns, but there were still a bunch of red flags that were looming in his head. The idea didn’t sit well with him at all, but it was what they had to agree to if they wanted their family to make it to the other side. By the way Steve had sat silent the entire trip home, Tony could only assume he was following the same trail of thought.
“Tony- ” Stane tried again, but was quickly cut off.
And there was no reason for him to go that.
“I’m a wanted man, Pep, I can’t go outside. Besides, Obie and I got to hold down the fort here. Please, Pep. I need someone I trust on this.”
People always said your life was supposed to flash before your eyes. Your good memories, your bad ones. When Steve was in the ice, he never got that chance. There was no last minute burst from his adrenaline filled mind; the ice just slowly lulled him to sleep. But staring down the gun, Steve only saw one thing.
“Well the guy had a busy morning. Three bombs before lunch probably works up a huge appetite,” quipped Tony.
Tony stared at the other man, completely in shock, trying to find any angle to spin the conversation away from the current collision it was heading for. “Well you’re shit out of luck, I’m afraid. It doesn’t matter what I feel; I can’t help you. I don’t have anything on HYDRA either. They’re gone. I can’t even find them.”
A military man, for sure. Stoicism was always a requirement when taking a job under the uniform. A blank canvas, one that would never crack, never showing emotion. Never showing weakness.
They had come so close to losing it all again many times in the past few months. He knew that everyone was getting desperate, trying to hold on to each other as they hurdled closer and closer to destruction. It seemed that with each passing day, Bucky was reminded that they still had room to hit rock bottom.
“You’re shaking.”
He tried to push forward, but he barely made it an inch before pain sliced through his body, causing him to freeze.
Steve could feel the heat rising in his cheeks as his brain caught up to how he looked at Tony’s feet. Steve huffed before yanking on Tony’s arm to help him stand up straight, trying to tower over Tony as much as possible. “Please,” Steve replied, eyes giving Tony the same treatment. “I think we both know who’d really be on their knees.”
It was The Captain and his Commandos.
be here. Not after what he had done. He should be home,
“Nope. We can even stop at the gift shop. I’ll buy you a Rubik’s cube.”
Clint watched as Loki rolled his eyes dramatically, scoffing at Thor's plead. “I don’t know what you want from me, brother. I’ve been locked up in here the whole time. How could I possibly know anything that’s happened to Stark?” his tone was as slimy as always, and it made Clint roil with anger. Whether or not Loki had direct involvement with Stark's kidnapping, he was absolutely aware of it. Information, that's the market Loki dealt in. Trading whispers for secrets, that sort of thing. A very similar deal to what Tony worked with in the criminal world - except for the fact that Stark used it for protection, and Loki only saw information as fire starters, dropping bombs where he could to get something burning, leaving before it got too hot. It was why he'd never been caught before, never been blindsided.
Tony hummed, and Steve could feel it reverberate against his own chest. “Seems to me that Captain America is jealous.”
Clint crossed his arms, defensively. “Think about it. Cold at the entry wound and no bullet. You got any other theories?”
Steve felt Tony push his fingers through his hair.
Tony scoffed, wiping his eyes. “It turns out that going on national television and shutting down my weapons division doesn’t mean shit if my CFO is still selling under the table.”
“Cap!”
“Is that so?” The tone was light, but Steve could tell that Fury already knew he was lying.
Steve closed his eyes, nodding slowly. “Just-just don’t do that again. It’s not good for my heart.”
“Well,” he started. “Coulson’s our man on the inside now. We’re not going to want to pull our last remaining link to HYDRA, especially now that we know his boss is in charge of the whole operation. But.”
The pair stepped in, Steve pushing the only button on the inside panel, the doors creaking shut behind him before the two of them started to descend. It was a short ride, and Steve was quickly back at the door, prying them open to reveal another dark cavern of concrete. As soon as the doors were open, however, the two of them were hit with a pungent smell.
The Captain refused to budge. “You’re not going anywhere. How about I put you in another chair like our guest here?”
“Gotta keep Sam in shape,” Steve tried to joke.
“We’ve got NYPD officers armed and ready in these buildings,” Hill said, pointing to a few offices across the street. “They’ll swoop in on my signal, but I’m hoping that we can just sneak in quietly. This place should be emptied out.”
“Of course!” she replied, taking Steve’s phone. “You guys on vacation?”
Any control Steve had maintained was long gone, the blonde dancing between whispered curses and choked gasps as Tony brought his body up and down.
Tony sat in awe at the sight in front of him. When Tony had first met The Howling Commandos he had expected one thing: a group of stone cold killers from all the stories whispered on the streets. But this? It was just like his initial interaction with The Captain himself; they were able to throw him through such a loop, that his mind couldn’t process what was happening.
Phil smiled sheepishly and gave an awkward wave to the other two men. His hair was still adorably ruffled from sleep, swallowed in Clint’s holey shirt and worn sweatpants. “What are you doing in the closet, Phil?” Clint asked, wondering that if he knew what would happen today, if he would have just stayed in bed.
Sam sighed, leaning back against the driver’s seat. “What are we doing here, Steve?”
“No doctors,” Tony tried to plead again.
Pepper was
“He’s going to have to learn to be,” Phil replied.
“Good,” Natasha smiled. “Now,” she added, much to her student’s dismay, “Relevé.”
“Will you quit it?” Steve hissed. “I just want to get something nice for Tony. You and I both know that Tony likes these sheets, so ergo, we’re getting some for our bed.”
“Not when it matters,” said Steve. When they were younger, Steve wouldn't hesitate reaching out to Bucky, asking him for advice on what to say. Bucky was suave and grew into his body fact, quickly elevating his status on the school grounds. It seemed like he could day anything on the school grounds to make the girls swoon. But it was just for fun, a complete facade based on empty words and quick smiles. Enough to work on the common crowd, but not those closest to him. It had taken years for Bucky to muster out the strength that he considered Steve his best friend, the brunette biting his lip and kicking at the ground, as he wasn't sure his admission woud be taken well. “He can talk his way out of any crime, but God forbid that man actually says he likes you,” Steve laughed.
Bucky shook his head, tremors taking over his body once he felt tears finally slip down his face. “No,” he moaned. “They shot him, they shot him.”
he had admitted with mischievous eyes.
he thought to himself.
“What?”
He stood, leaving money on the table. He had almost reached the door when the waitress turned the volume of the television.
Tony shot her another winning smile, but it came out more like a grimace, each heart beat sending waves of pain through his body. “Wilson,” Tony gasped.
Tony huffed out a laugh. “Well, it’s nice to know all the good things I can look forward too.”
Steve huffed. “That’s not what I meant. This whole thing started because something was bugging you.”
“I’m glad we were able to reach an understanding,” sneered Steve. “Wrap him up, Thor, and drop him in a street. I don’t care which one; just get this filth out of here.”
Tony gave one final look around the warehouse before following Rhodey outside. Rhodey hopped in his car, staring the engine to drive to the hospital with Tony.
“How bad is it?”
“I’m driving,” Steve responded gruffly.
Sure, Tony had enemies, but no one had ever done this. No one had ever dared too. They knew who Tony was, what he would do if they tried to attack him. No one would be crazy enough to do it.
Thank you for keeping up with the story, I hope you're enjoying it!
Steve leaned closer to Tony. “I think you need to be more adaptable.”
And then he met Riley.
“Yea, sure.”
“But those are risks we never took before!” Barnes shouted. “I know you agree with me; there is no way in
A large chunk of roof came tumbling to the ground just feet from where Clint was sitting. Clint jumped, trying to retract further into the alley where he sat, looking up at his former home.
“Yes, but he won’t be for much longer if we sit on our asses. Hill, please!”
“It’s HYDRA. It has to be,” answered Natasha. “Back when we caught Hammer. He said that they were digging around. What if they found some of the locations? That was the last time we saw everyone.”
“Because that means you’ll have to come back here and get it after you use the bathroom. Because you can’t leave without it.”
“Ok, makes sense. He would know the layout of the building.”
“And you are?" he yelled back.
Steve went to punch Rogers when he stopped. To the left of him, his shield was floating in the air.
With the speed of the quinjet, Steve found himself at base in ten minutes. Agents were frantically running around, darting quickly around the still smoky building.
“Rogers won’t listen to me,” Tony scoffed.
Bucky let go of Steve’s wrist and punched him in the shoulder. “Like you can talk, Mr. Alpha. You we’re just about ready to throw him onto the ground and take him right here!”
He ended up locking the robot down in the lab, his father not even caring about it then.
“You have another call from Captain Rogers, Sir.”
“Buck, I didn’t mean- ”
“Only if you’re a good boy,” Tony chided, leading Clint out of the lab. He walked ahead, letting Clint dart off to grab his own weapons before they made their way to the car. Tony only let himself pause over the couch where he’d been stabbed in the back, grabbing his phone.
Clint flinched at Steve’s tone. But of course, it was definitely warranted.
Tony tried to breathe through yet another panic attack. His hands were shaking and tears were streaming down his face.
“I mean, it’s been a stressful week for us all. You don’t have to go through this alone. I just think that maybe you should take a day, and- ”
Bullet wounds shouldn't show up in car accidents.
“Steve!” Bucky cried, pulling away from his to aim his own weapon that he’d taken off of Campbell’s body. He fired wildly, causing Zola to retreat. Steve took the chance to crawl over to the back corner, hiding behind a stack of crated files.
“You’re sure?” Yinsen's voice was quiet, uncertain. They'd gone over the plan plenty of times, but there was no room for error here. One wrong move and it was over for the both of them.
“I didn’t say it was Captain Grant,” Pepper replied, trying to peer over Tony’s shoulder.
That’s not an answer.” Tony’s trashes turned into twitches, getting slower by the second.
Steve nodded, watching her turn and head off with her own group. “C’mon, Steve,” Bucky prodded, pulling him to follow Campbell. “Let’s finish this.”
But, Tony also hadn’t said no; Steve would cling to that as long as he could.
Time froze.
The aftermath of the
“Uh, I require precedence,” Tony countered. “If you couldn’t tell, it’s been quite the month for me. My CFO turned out to be crazy, by boyfriend was missing in action for a little while, and I- ”
Bucky shook his head again. “He doesn’t know who he is, but we’re willing to bet any money that Steve doesn’t know about Loki’s other rendezvous.”
“Drop it.”
Steve was a failure. He had no idea why Tony put up with him. Tony always saw himself as the insecure one; he was so sure Steve would pack up and leave. But it was Steve who didn’t deserve Tony. Tony, who always saw him as perfect, as someone who could do no wrong. But Steve was anything but. He was a constant disappointment. Steve would never be good enough for Tony.
Steve sighed. “Listen, I have a contact at the police, I’ve got men scouring the streets for him, but it’s still not enough. It’s been
That’s when it caught up with him. How by saving the world, he was still killing off some of it. Taking lives. Being a bully. Erskine told him to be a good man, but here Steve was, no better than any of the Nazis.
“For some time,” came the vague response.
Where’s his body, Steve?
if you wanted to know.”
Faint laps in the water over the jets was the only warning he had before Tony’s hands grabbed at his arms, pulling him closer. “Is this alright?” he asked as Steve fell into his embrace. “Not sure how you feel about the water, but I- ”
“Everything. Anything you could think of,” Steve answered truthfully. “Double agent identities, stock pile locations, ammunition drops, addresses of all our informants. The SSR was founded in a time of crisis. It was during the brink of World War II, and the world was floundering, trying to pick up the pieces. Believe it or not, it was the perfect time to set the foundations of an empire.
“Of course not. I’m just admitting that I’m smarter than you.” Tony silently preened when he saw Fury clench his jaw.
The constant ringing in his ears was what woke him. The pain that followed, radiating all over his body, had him wishing that he was anything but conscious. A noise followed, like broken glass, but it wasn’t long until he figured out that it was him that made such a grating sound.
Bruce reached out and squeezed Natasha’s hand. “Don’t ever feel like you don’t belong, or that we are only here to judge you. You’re the glue that keeps us together. Or, I should say, the glue that keeps our heads out of our asses. We need you.”
But from the sounds of that conversation, things were not going too well.
Natasha added over the comm.
No; there still was a chance that The Captain was wrong. Wasn't there?
Bruce finally walked over to Stark, taking a look at his arm. He wiped down the wound and started on the stitches when he said, “It’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Stark.”
Tony wanted to protest, wanted to scream and yell some more. Where had Steve been? Why was he so late? Would he still be here when Tony woke up? That was what scared him the most – that Tony would wake up cradling an empty bottle instead of Steve’s warm hands.
“Of course. Of fucking course,” Stark hissed.
“Besides,” Tony continued. “We can’t leave tonight. You’ll be too busy cooking for me.”
As for him, Steve wasn’t sure how he was doing. He’d be lying if said he was okay, but with everything that happened, Steve had a hard time remembering if there was a time where he was ever okay.
“Bye,” Steve whispered, listening to Tony hand up the phone. “Excuse me,” he said, turning back to the shaking woman. “Where were we?”
Bucky was floating. Or maybe he was drowning. In the end, he didn’t really care. Anything to get him far away from the flames.
Tony flopped down on the musty couch in The Captain’s office, groaning softly as he closed in eyes. The stress of the past few days had definitely taken its toll; it felt good to finally take the weight off his feet. He heard The Captain follow him in, the small creaks against the floor and rustle of The Captain’s clothing a comfort to Tony’s ears.
Right?
Phil shrugged. “I heard that The Captain wanted him dead, that’s all.”
“How the hell are we going to deal with this?”
But it kept happening. Just whispers, warnings to The Captain and The Commandos. HYDRA was coming back for them. Steve never blinked an eye. Until last week.
Tony tensed as his heart fluttered otherwise.
But that was then. This is now.
Clint shrugged, movements sluggish. “Thor took him.”
Phil was shaking his head as Fury spoke. He could hear the EKG betraying him, his pulse escalating like a runaway train. “You’re wrong. I don’t know who that is.”
Tony frowned. “I don’t have beef with The Captain, I just have beef with Steve Rogers.”
be late for this meeting!” Pepper’s voice carried in from the living room as the woman was, no doubt, going over final preparations for the work day. Steve chuckled at the pout Tony gave the unseen Pepper, unable to stop himself from leaning in, pressing a kiss to the corner of the frown.
He forced himself to look back down at his pocket watch. At Peggy.
Tony laughed. "Your word means jack shit to me."
saw it," Bucky pushed. "And I know you feel the same way I do; the word anger doesn’t begin to cover it. I brought the others here alive because I knew there was no way that I would have the strength to ignore the urge to kill the one guy if I brought him here alone. And I know you wouldn’t be able to do it either. The way I see it, we can fuck up five times and still have one left over to interrogate.”
Tony grabbed his arm. “Stay as far back as possible, okay? The blast shouldn’t reach you, but I don’t want to take any chances.”
Tony’s heart leapt. There was an explosion at the compound. Steve had been there, and he hadn’t answered his phone.
Tony froze.
“Your boss is a lunatic. When are you gonna come work with me?”
“For medical reasons? No. But for personal reasons? Absolutely.”
“Am I supposed to be impressed? Phil, last week I saw Natasha cleaning blood off a stiletto.
“Yea, I need to stay here for a little while.” Steve groaned, standing up slowly.
Part of Tony thought about powering JARVIS down and slipping through the back door where no prying eyes could catch him, but he knew that was a fool’s errand. Past Tony, in his infinite wisdom, had programmed an alert to The Commandos’ phones to tell them if and when JARVIS ever went offline. JARVIS was the first line of defense to the speakeasy; if anyone managed to get through his firewalls and into the building, at least the team would still be ready for whatever was coming. So, if he took J offline now, Tony would probably make it half a block before the beefcake twins downstairs would know what he’d planned.
9. Alfred Westbrook - Treachery
Also also, fun fact, both news stories Bucky mentions ACTUALLY HAPPENED. Y'all, Florida is crazy.
Bucky wasn’t much different. He was closed off; didn’t talk too much, and when he did, he would ask for someone to pass the liquor. Clint couldn’t blame the man, he couldn’t blame Steve either. Their world had been ripped from them so many times, it was only a matter of time before it became too much.
“If you do find Coulson alive, kill him.”
Clint sped through the streets. He had reached the outskirts of New York; he needed to get to Stark Industries.
It’s literally claiming that the only thing they have going for them is that it’s a state you cross to get to other states.”
“Hill,” Steve nodded. She smiled in response but it didn’t reach her eyes.
If anything, this worked out better for Steve. If Tony had fallen asleep in his lab, it would be easier for Steve to slip out of the speakeasy unnoticed. He knew what he said, he knew what he promised Tony. Trying to negotiate with Fury was their only option, the only way that they could potentially come out with some semblance of a win. This situation was bigger than them. HYDRA needed to be stopped, and they couldn’t get greedy. With Pierce controlling the NYPD and Stane running guns to anyone that was remotely criminal, New York City was just steps away from becoming a war zone.
Steve looked back at the cop, making sure his hands were still up as he slowly lowered himself to the ground.
Tony rubbed shaking hands over his eyes. “I have no idea what the fuck you’re on about. I just, I can’t get into this now.”
“Well,” Sam said slowly. “Tell her I said hi.”
“Are you sure it will work?”
Stark waved a hand. "Happy's clinging to life; your crew will live to see another day. For now."  Stark stood up, idly walking around the room, still blatantly ignoring the many guns pointed his direction. He stopped in front of Sam Wilson, glaring down at the younger man.
“DUM-E, hand me my phone,” Tony panted.
Steve ignored the urge to look at the photo immediately, instead turning to see Tony looking up again at the mailbox, a more curious gaze about him. “You want to go inside, don’t you?” Steve knowingly asked.
It wasn’t long before Steve and Sam found their way to the collapsed floor. The fallen walls and supports were no match for Steve’s strength. Slowly but surely, they reached the offices trapped by the falling debris.
But it had been over two weeks, and Tony was nowhere closer to finding any more about Rumlow or HYDRA. While Tony had first admired the challenge, he was now about two seconds from ripping his hair out. Tony could tell The Captain was just as anxious. Their meetings at the hospital were getting more and more repetitive, the two of them just trying to fool each other into thinking they still had the upper hand against HYDRA. And now Obie was breathing down his neck. Perfect.
“I knew that we were already prepping with our back up plan after Washington; I just didn’t know it was you.”
. They are no use to us anymore. You need to remember that you can’t save everybody.”
The blonde man blinked up in confusion. “Used?”
“Now is so not the time to do this,” Barnes repeated with a hiss, metal hand tugging nervously on his long hair. “Give me the phone!”
“It’s not about the meal, Tony, it’s about spending time together! It’s about being a family!”
Sam frowned slightly, before nodding. As he walked away, Steve could make out his faint remark of “
Looking around, Steve could only guess he was in some run down building, virtually indistinguishable in New York. It was completely empty except for the chair he was in, another chair across from him, and some barrel pushed off to the side. It was dimly lit, moonlight barely seeping in from the large windows along the far wall. Steve sighed, trying to stay relaxed. He was no stranger to playing prisoner, even if that meant getting beat around a little bit. His team could come. Tony would come, he knew it.
Clint blinked. “Excuse me?”
Tony squinted, the engineer’s mind no doubt whirling, trying to piece the events together. “Wha-where?”
“We won’t what?” Sam pushed.
Words were beyond Tony now, all he could do was raise a shaking hand to the left, directing Clint towards the other reactor. The other man dashed rom his sight, and Tony could hear the sound of glass shattering. And then Clint was back, sliding across the floor, arc reactor cradled in his hands.
Steve’s heart pounded, blood rushing through his veins. This wasn’t right. Skull was dead; Schmidt was dead. He’d seen it with his own eyes. Right? Was there anyone else that could have brought HYDRA back from the grave? Who better to do it than a man who was also supposed to be dead?
“He knows about HYDRA.”
“Oh, God,” Pepper sighed.
“Listen, I’m going to go take care of this- ”
A piece of falling debris crashed net to him. Tony couldn’t help but shudder, remembering the last time he was in exploding building did not end well for him.
Using the distraction to his advantage, Tony pushed The Captain towards the crowd while running the opposite direction. People were screaming; whether they were yelling at The Captain or him, Tony didn’t stop to find out.
“Is that Clint’s quinjet?”
“Why don’t you take the gun out in between your legs and do it already,” Rogers sneered. “Since when are you using a gun?”
Tony huffed. “You are just one bad decision after another, aren’t you?”
“Did you kill someone you weren’t supposed to?”
“I'm only going in case of a code green, Tony,” the man answered, almost apologetic. “You never know when you might need a doctor.”
Barton nodded. “You see,” he started. “None of the Lost Boys liked it when Wendy showed up. In some of the older stories, they actually shot Wendy out of the sky when she went flying into Neverland. They were so afraid that Wendy would take Peter away. That they’d wake up one morning and they’d be alone again.”
“JARVIS, just because you’re not installed in the bedroom does not mean you should use that as an opportunity to disrupt my personal time by other methods.”
Clint already started to show signs of worry – for good reason – and Steve couldn’t look away. Maybe he should have let Bucky tell him. Hell, even Tony. Give him a gun, and he could walk into any room, no matter the odds. He wasn’t scared of the violence, he secretly craved it. But this? He didn’t have the stomach for this; the ability to admit his failure.
Steve clenched his eyes shut tightly. "There wasn't anything you could have done," he whispered, voice wavering in pain. "You couldn't have known that was going to happen."
"Excuse me?" Tony scoffed.
Steve gaped at the other man. “You’ve got to be joking,” he deadpanned. “I distinctly remember a previous conversation about your feelings on camping and now all of a sudden you’re on board?”
Phil could barely see Fury through his half lidded eyes. Even if Fury hadn’t mentioned their location, Phil would have been able to figure out that he was drugged out of his mind. Honestly, it was a miracle that he got a full sentence out of his cotton mouth.
Below him, Pepper had turned white as a sheet. “
He froze.
"You refuse to tell us the location of The Captain's new hideout."
“Maybe now, but you won’t like it when it comes with wrinkles,” Tony replied. “With Extremis my lifespan will most likely be longer, so I can be here longer with you, and- ”
“Yeah, you’re fine,” Bucky murmured lowly, barely any gray left in his eyes. “You were more than fine, doll,
Steve broke off with a sigh. He didn’t know what they needed anymore.
It wasn’t until the car had stopped that Steve finally knew where they were. Steve stepped out of the car, staring at the huge ‘STARK’ printed on the side of the building. He shuddered, instantly thinking about how he had seen those words just a few days before on a bomb.
“I don’t follow.”
A name stared right back at him.
Tony groaned, pushing Barnes away. Maybe Barnes wasn’t stuck after all. After all, even with the extra adrenaline, there was no way that Tony could have been able to pull the injured man from-
Steve closed his eyes. “He doesn’t. He’ll kill you all until he gets sent back home.”
Tony waved him off. “No, no. If anything you probably did me a favor. Who knows what horrors my body would face if I stayed hunched over like that,” he said rubbing a hand on the back of his neck. “What time is it?”
Silence descended over the room. “We did our best,” Steve croaked. “I mean, with all the shit that we’ve done over the years, it would be dumb of us to assume that we could just walk away from this. I know this is hard, and if you’re gonna be pissed, be pissed at me. I just have to believe that it’ll all work out.” Steve paused, eyes blinking rapidly. “It will be, it will be, uh, I’m sorry… I-I just need to- ”
There was no ongoing operation for the Kansas jurisdiction of the New York office, let alone an operational and occupied safehouse. There was just nothing.
The war was far from over, but for now, Tony was going to take a moment and relish in his continued heartbeat. And in the warmth of Steve pressed against him.
A middle aged woman gaped at Clint. “What?!” Her head snapped towards the alleyway. “I don’t see anyone. Who?”
“Well, maybe you shouldn’t have left me alone so long.”
Loki rolled his eyes. “Please. I know that you pieced together that Coulson was a mole. You weren’t going to let him live.”
“What,” Steve smiled. “You really don’t think that I would have gone looking for you anyway? The key just made it a little easier.”
Steve snorted, but found himself smiling back. “What could possibly go wrong?”
Tony’s eyes roamed all over the uniform, letting out a hollow laugh when he saw his rank. “What can I do for you…
Tony saw Pietro’s shoulders slump in relief, the rest of the family replicating the action as Sam Wilson walked through the door.
He had been played.
“You’re not forgiven. Now leave,” Tony snapped.
Clint paced behind an abandoned factory, humming a broken tune.
“What else are you keeping from us?” Steve snapped.
Stark looked back at man in the chair. “Well, dead man tells no tales,” he quipped, stepping over to him. “So I guess I’ll just do the talking for him.” Steve watched as Stark pulled out his phone before snapping a few close ups of the man’s face.
It was Bucky, yet again, that stopped Steve from drowning. Pulled him back out, gave him new hope.
Steve’s pulse quickened, his blood pumping as adrenaline filled his system.
“Here. Take the truck. It’s filled with gold. Take it and go live your life. No one will come after you; I took care of it.”
“Oh. Um. Oops?” Pepper gave a small laugh followed by a sharp gasp. “
The room was silent besides the nervous tapping of Tony’s foot against the hard floor of The Commando’s base. He couldn’t remember how long he had been sitting in front of his computers, screening for people accessing his hidden virus. JARVIS was running the back trace now; it shouldn’t be too much longer before Tony had a location.
Phil scolded.
,” Steve grit out, eyes not leaving the door.
It had been the first time he’d met Stark, in person, anyway. He would have to have lived under a rock not to know about one of the largest puppet masters of Manhattan. It was there, in their own home, watching as Stark batted Steve around like a cat with a ball of yarn that he was reminded of the first time he met Riley. Of course, Sam thought that as bad as it was, his and Riley’s first meeting ended a lot better than theirs, considering Steve had Stark pushed up against the wall, snarling in his face, his own gun pointed at the smaller man’s chest.
“Well, Treachery found me not to long after Washington. I was on leave when it happened so I never got caught up in all the mess. The foot soldiers like me were lucky; we weren’t important enough for HYDRA to ever create files on us. SHIELD never figured out who we were; we could slip into hiding easily. But Treachery managed to find me. Said he needed someone with my past experience.”
“Yeah, the answer is still no. Rumors aren’t always true.”
The team sat around the dinner table. They always made an effort to try and have a meal together once a week. Something to pull away from their stresses and get them out of their own head for a while.
Steve ignored him, kicking the door open and stomping up the stairs to the meeting room. Bucky was already in there with Clint, the brunette holding his now ruined jacket up against Clint’s side, stopping the still flowing blood.
faster, we
It wasn't until Bucky caught him trying to teach himself ASL that Steve finally revealed Clint to the rest of the team.
“Yes,” Raza agreed. “But this is business, and as you can see, it’s booming. I need more.”
Bucky knocked their shoulders together. “Come on,” he stated. “Let’s go finish this.”
If anyone found out, they wouldn’t hesitate to just shove him out the door. Clint wouldn’t let that happen. He needed to be there for his family.
“Everything ok with you?”
But no one ever thinks to look at the teeth.
“Christ,
11:30 a.m., it read.
"Steve."
Fury hummed, but didn’t move to continue the conversation. Steve felt his leg start to twitch as he started to get antsy. “Why are you here? Is it about the podcast?”
she prayed to whoever the hell was listening.
Bruce pointed at a tear that had slipped down her cheek. Natasha tolled her eyes. “Your point?”
“HYDRA is a broken shell of what it used to be. You lot were nothing but a stepping stone for me.”
Steve would like nothing more than to curl up in bed. But he couldn’t; Steve had slept for almost seventy years. And now he found himself unable to get through more than three hours at a time. Each time Steve closed his eyes, he couldn’t help but think that he might wake up in yet another century. In another world. His subconscious haunted him, keeping Steve awake for weeks. The only reason he was able to make it through each day was from the added benefits of the super soldier serum. But even with the extra bonus, Steve is feeling his body shut down. But it’s not like any of it mattered. Steve just wanted to sleep again. Hopefully forever this time.
“Sir?”
“Ms. Scarlett?” a grating voice asked. Like nails on a chalkboard. Natasha could imagine Mrs. Barkley on the other side of the door, one hand raised and ready to knock again, the other clutching her sunglasses and designer handbag. Another thing that was new – this time, not to rub her apparent wealth in the other parent’s face, but because a replacement was necessary, especially after a few weeks ago when Natasha had accidently slipped a hand in to loosen a nail polish cap, painting the entire bags insides a vomitous pink.
Steve’s eyes widened. “No shit.” He looked back to the door as it finally opened. Sam Wilson stepped through, looking utterly disheveled.
Steve let out a small sigh. Natasha must still be pushing for him to get a date. Still, he was Captain America. He put on a professional smile, and shook her hand. “A pleasure, ma’am.”
Steve groaned, his head pounding as his eyes fluttered open. He tried to move around, only to find himself zip-tied to a chair. Even his feet were secure against the legs of the chair. The last thing he remembered was the assault, and Tony was there, and then- Steve winced as he remembered the pipe that had come down on his head. Steve could only pray that Tony had fled while he had the chance, going for backup.
“Oh yeah?” Tony breathed, his breath ghosting over Steve’s face.
“I’m not gonna let that happen,” Steve shot back confidently. Just because Tony didn't want anything to do with them anymore didn't mean that they were going to cast him to the side. Steve was serious about the job he offered Tony - back when what seemed almost a lifetime ago. And after what he'd done for Bucky, Steve would always be indebted to him. The least he could do was ensure that he always had someone watching his six, even if from the shadows.
Tony sighed in realization. “You’re on babysitting duty, aren’t you?”
Against his better judgement, Steve rushed over to the door and flung it open. There stood a hulking man wearing a tailored black suit, phone pressed to his ear, with dark skin, and piercing eye –
Tony looked away, not able to meet the piercing gaze. Tony had thought he and The Captain had come a long way. Sure, what Barnes was saying may have been the original plan, but that wasn’t his end game now, right? Tony bit his lip. Who was he kidding. The fact that he wasn’t convincing Barnes was enough to show Tony that he was no better than the original piece of shit he started out as. And with The Captain making empty promises of trust, maybe they were both just trying to fool themselves. Like they both didn't know what was going to happen in the end, once HYDRA was out of the picture. “It seems like you speak from experience,” Tony managed to grit out.
“Wilson, please tell me you need me anywhere but here,” Barnes said as he answered the phone, pressing the device up to his ear. “If you could just see the shit that I’m dealing wi-
Tony froze, glancing carefully over his shoulder to where Fury had gotten out of his chair.
Steve couldn’t help but smile. Last night was intense. It was nothing he had ever felt before. He knew now more than ever that he would do anything to keep Tony safe.
Pressing the phone against his ear, Clint called out. “Phil?”
She reached into her pocket and pulled out a worn picture. “Here. Grandpa always said that he never saw the war as the end of his life; it was the beginning of a new one. Moving on to America was the best decision he ever made; he never regretted anything that happened.”
Tony thought, glaring at the older man. Maybe this was the reason Pepper wanted him to come to board meetings. To come and see the greedy warmongers he let run his company while he turned a blind eye to keep tinkering in his lab. "I wouldn't say that," Tony responded. "There's a high chance that I'll be calling your family tonight," he hissed.
“No,” Tony negated. “Not this time. He needs you.”
“You didn’t notice this entire time he was gone?” Bucky asked, steering the conversation away from that dreadful day. “You had no contact?”
Part of Tony’s mind was throwing up a red flag; that this was wrong. He had Steve now, and there was no way he was letting him go. He knew Steve always hated it when he coerced women and the occasional man. He always got that furrowed brow look, with a tight frown. Getting the look of pure disapproval from the Righteous Man himself never sat well with Tony.
Tony watched in horror as Yinsen’s eyes fluttered shut. Tony scrambled, slapping the man’s cheeks, screaming his name, but Yinsen refused to answer.
Steve countered in response.
Tony laughed, a bunch of bright charms dancing in the wind, his face scrunching up like a sly raccoon. Steve couldn’t help but answer the infectious smile, pulling the man closer. Maybe it wasn’t the future they’d planned, but at least Steve still had him. As long as he had Tony, as long as he had his family, he’d give up being a superhero any day.
He walked down the stairs to the foyer, but stopped himself. On the entrance table to the left was one of the buzzers Tony had made for him and Steve.
“That’s as good as it’s going to get,” Yinsen said, throwing the last chair against the door, barring it as best he could.
“No, no, it’s fine. What did I say about calling me Mr. Stark?” Tony replied with a small chuckle.
“Downstairs.”
“Yes, and Tony Stark is the
Steve smiled, looking back down at Tony’s pale face. “He’d find a reason to yell at me anyway,” Steve responded fondly.
"Hey, you can't go in there!" The agent's yell wasn't directed at him, but at Clint, who had decided that he had waited long enough, charging straight into the warzone.
Tony had thought The Captain was screaming at him in the streets for the Hammer situation, while Tony tried to plead with the man as to why he was hiding from going out in public. Who knew that they were shouting about two completely different things? Tony sure didn’t.
in here,” Tony corrected, as he crouched down and gently scooped up some bits of rubble. Bits of rubble, that seemed to have a mind of their own as they started wiggling in Tony’s arms.
Almost. Tony could see the stubborn locks of hair that refused to fall in line, a result of his incessant tugging. He could still see a faint flush on chiseled cheeks, matching Steve’s kiss-ridden lips. He looked so startlingly young in that moment, but no less handsome. But in a flash, it was gone, the veil dropping back into place as Steve slipped his jacket on. Gone were the bright eyes and boyish grins. Only The Captain remained now.
Silence echoed through the small room, broken sporadically by their prisoner’s raspy breaths, still unconscious. Tony stared at The Captain, starting to think that he had won him over. That was until The Captain gave a sharp laugh. “That’s the worst idea I’ve ever heard.”
“The first one,” Steve answered, opening the rusted gate wide enough for both him and Natasha to slip through. “The original meeting place for the SSR and the first info hold. When the war ended, the Army shut the camp down, making it the perfect place for them to meet. They collected the scarps of intel that the military left behind and started to build their territory. This camp houses some of the most important and the oldest information that the SSR ever came by. It’s the only file drop that I never even included in my sketches. HYDRA getting their hands on their information would be catastrophic.”
Now that he found himself sitting between the two and their staring contest, Steve itched for his gun. There was a high probability that this turns bloody very quickly.
Steve sighed, rubbing a hand across his face. “I’m not even going to ask why you know what this is.”
“What’s the situation?”
He scuffled with Barnes as long as he could before the sound of his gun cocking pulled Tony away. “Barnes, you don’t have to do this,” Tony tried to reason.
“Against HYDRA?”
From: Tony Stark
“Steve,” Sam tried again, but Steve wasn’t having it. He needed to leave. He needed to get out.
is to keep Bucky safe. Or did you forget what happened the last time I let him out of my sight?”
“That took a while,” he sneered.
“You really are the faithful guard dog, aren’t you?”
JARVIS obliged, playing back the footage, until the car was pulling in to the street, Tony able to make out the fuzzy face of The Captain in the driver's seat. "There," Tony pointed to his face. "Can you get facial recognition off that face?"
Steve laughed softly before collapsing on the bed, smelling in the acquainted smells of his team, his eyes already drifting shut. He could vaguely hear Bucky push another bed next to him before clambering on top.
Just a stump.
“I need you to be here. You kept Steve safe, kept my family safe, while the rest of us tried to throw you out like yesterday’s trash. You stood by our side, through everything. Lord knows why; I know I sure as hell wouldn’t have. Just shows that you’re the best one of us here; it shows what Steve saw in you. I don’t know why it took so long for me to see that.”
“Like I said before, I was being held by The Commandos. But now I’m here. I got back out.”
Part of him wanted to confide in Stane, and tell him the truth about Steve Rogers, but he knew he could never trust the man. Besides, he had no use for Rogers anymore anyway. Loki had told him where Rogers said the SSR kept their files. The Captain was just as expendable as the rest of them now.
None of that mattered now. Tony needed to find help.
Of course that’s why Obie’s here. He had basically tanked his company just hours ago.
But it didn't matter how often Tony tried; in Howard's eyes, he was never fit enough. And here he was, years later, staring up at a man, wearing the same face he'd seen his father wear too many times.
“How could you think that, doll?” Bucky answered hoarsely. “How could you let us make you think that?”
Steve took a step back, giving the fireman another look. Something wasn’t right. “Excuse me?”
Pierce hung up the phone and leaned back in his chair.
“Your choice, bud, concrete or bullets.”
Tony couldn’t help but fall into a laughing fit. “You really want me to answer that?”
behave, said treat might involve a flat surface.”
a small whisper came over the phone.
The man sighed, looking up towards the ceiling. Tony smiled to himself, enjoying both the man’s frustration and the pale skin that adorned his neck. If he thought Tony was just going to roll over without his security team, he was even more stupid than Tony thought.
A constant breeze passed over him, the whooshing sound bouncing across the wall.
“Don’t do that,” Tony hissed. “How the hell did you even get here so fast? Were you in here the whole time?”
It was almost fate that you survived,” Stane laughed. “Turns out you had one last golden egg to lay.”
“I need you to do something for me.”
Tony broke off with one final laugh. By the look on The Captain’s face, Tony knew he was spot on. “Am I right, or am I right?”
at a gun.”
listed underneath. Maybe it was Sam? Steve had his personal cell, but he could be calling from a work number.
“What?” his husband cried. “You knocked down a building?!”
“It’s a town favorite,” she replied.
“Are you really making this out to be a bad thing? Their home is gone! There isn’t anywhere for them to hide anymore. They’re wounded now; it’s the perfect time to attack.”
The man offered a hollow laugh. “Of course. I’d apologize, but it needed to be done.”
Almost on auto pilot, Tony reached down to help him up. The man looked positively horrible. Dark bags of restlessness lay on sickly skin, under weary eyes. Tony could feel the fingers that were latched on his shoulders trembling, shaking the layers of clothing that barely clung to Coulson’s emaciated body. And good Lord, was Coulson wearing a hoodie? Tony always assumed hell would freeze over before he saw the man in anything besides his uniform or a stiff suit. But it was close enough, seeing as the man wearing sad hoodie was supposed to be dead.
“Hey, it’s ok, we’re ok,” replied Clint, trying to soothe her.
Phil's voice replied harshly. "
"It's already done," Pierce smiled maniacally. "You'll be gone by the end of the week. Do me a favor and say hello to your dear old Dad for me, won't you? You see, he answered my call, and he just
Steve lurched forward as both he and Rhodes stumbled back into the main room. The rest of his team were still gathered there, holding onto different pieces of furniture for support.
“That shipment has been here for weeks now. Wouldn’t Hammer have struck a deal already?” Steve continued.
Loki shrugged, peeling another portion of the apple. “Wasn’t my building that blew up; not my problem.”
"It's almost funny. How you can go and preach on how it wasn't my fault when you were getting the same speech not even a month ago."
Steve opened his eyes to be met with a familiar red and gold suit.
Sam nodded, and started to reply when Natasha came bursting in. “We’ve got a problem. There’s been an explosion at Stark Industries.”
“Wait, Yinsen!” Tony shouted. “Dammit,” he whispered to himself, his clunky fingers moving over the keyboard to finish the virus.
Steve returned the laugh hollowly, before looking down at his hands. “Phil, I- ”
“Did they kill him?” he asked.
Fury stared at him hard for a long moment. “Fine, we can come back to it. There are more pressing matters to deal with.”
“You’re going now?” Tony pressed, obviously alluding to the conversation they had just finished.
“Tony, you listening?”
Tony nodded, looking back to his house. “Ok.” Steve watched as Tony paced around, muttering to himself, before he stopped in front of Steve again. Steve saw his eyes calculating; he could almost hear the gears whirring in his head as he made a decision. With on last deep breath, Tony stuck his hand out.
“No,” she smirked. “I was kind of hoping you would convince me that it was.”
at the time; a mob half-hazardly thrown together, a team consisting of every single clashing personality on the planet.
Steve pinched his nose with his fingers. "Seems risky."
Steve silenced him with a kiss. “It’s perfect,” he reassured when he pulled away.
Steve looked over at him. “What do you mean?”
“Where are you, Odinson?”
Stark frowned at that.
“Tell me,” he finally answered.
“You can’t be serious,” Natasha replied. “You know you made the right call. The
“How did you do this?” Steve snapped, gesturing to the rest of the room. “You didn’t know about any of these places!”
Pierce’s brain stuttered to a halt.
Steve had been skeptical of the whole idea, as had Bucky. They couldn’t exactly move past the words
“Did I stutter?” Tony snapped. “He’s in the East River!”
“My God, you’re just head over heels for that boy, aren’t you?” Pepper murmured.
"JARVIS?"
Steve shut his eyes, waiting. The sound of the gun firing pierced his ears, splitting right through the wind. Steve’s body automatically flinched, the man waiting for the void to take him.
“Tony- ”
Rhodey looked around the warehouse. "What are you thinking? Hammer?"
“Yep.”
Steve and Tony shared a look. That definitely didn’t bode well. “Well, we’re not,” Steve started, carefully, as if trying not to spook a wild animal.
“I get it, Wendy wasn’t popular,” Tony grit out.
Clint’s heart rate skyrocketed, the man dropping the phone from his ear. He pushed away from Bucky, trying to get to Phil.
Tony sighed. “Yes, I’ll try and put in a few more hours. Just give me time. That’s all I’m asking for. I need time to figure this out.”
“I’m not talking about Lucky,” Clint replied, biting his lip. Of course, the universe was rarely on his side, and he was stopped by Tony shouting in surprise yet again. The other men raced over, following the sound. Once he saw what had caused the scream, Clint groaned, wiping a hand over his face in frustration, ignoring the sharp pain that pulsed on his face when he did so. Tony had opened the closet, but he certainly hadn’t found the first aid kit.
Tony threw a fry at him. “Don’t be such a party pooper.”
"Fine then. Get the hammer."
“Buck?” he managed to croak out.
“No,” Steve answered. “We came to an agreement.”
The whole monopoly situation he has going on in Brooklyn can be seen as a potential threat. How long before The Captain decides that Brooklyn isn’t big enough, and stretches his reach farther? Into Queens, hell, maybe even Manhattan? The last thing Tony needs is to be responsible for handing over his precious tech to what looked like a crazed super soldier.
for the scones,” Tony scoffed, smacking Steve on the shoulder. “I just thought you guys might want a place for yourselves.”
“They won’t tell me where Hammer is,” Steve interjected, glaring at Clint.
fine,” Steve grit out. He yanked Stark against him again, his temper getting the best of him. When he felt Stark flinch roughly under him, guilt poured through Steve’s veins, his harsh grasp instantly yielding. He spun Stark around, Steve’s head dipping down so he was eye level with Stark’s.
Steve took off running. Hiding behind a car, he saw past Steve run into his apartment complex. Only to hear shots fired.
“Why?”
“All these states have shit about Lincoln in their state slogan because they have no accomplishments other than some past president walking through their fields.”
Steve shook his head. “I’m not sure; I haven’t gotten word from Tony yet.” He palmed for his phone, sighing when he realized he left it on the quinjet. “How could this happen?”
Wanda shot out a force field, sending Pietro crashing to the ground.
But Bucky was already shaking his head. “I’m sorry, Steve. I’m so sorry,” he whispered.
“This wasn’t taken in the Middle East. This is in New York.”
“You bet your ass I did,” Steve replied, stepping out of the car. “Come on,” he continued, leaning back in his door to look at Tony. “I want us to get a picture with it. I think you can even climb inside.”
Steve stepped back abruptly, darting out of Sam’s reach. “Get out of here, Wilson.”
“Jesus, Tony," Steve groaned. You can’t possibly- ”
There were voices, shouts.
"Ok, normal speed. Keep playing the footage." Tony watched the cameras minutes after he had already driven off when finally a hulking figure stepped out onto the road. "There. Can we follow him through other cameras?"
Tony cheered. Steve could hear splashes in the background, no doubt Peter in the middle of getting a bath.
Steve wasn’t sure what he was expecting when he was met with large glass panels at the bottom of the stairs, but he couldn’t help but smile when the lights flickered on as the three passed through the glass door. Because the lab? It was all Tony. Completely contrasting with the rest of the speakeasy that remained a style from the past with its old wood and dark walls, the lab looked almost white. Sleek tables littered in papers surrounded the lab, the walls lined with cabinets still half open from where Tony had dug around through them. Whiteboards covered in Tony’s scrawl hung on the walls, while random contraptions of metal that only Tony could understand sat in all the only available free space. Steve could see a small mini fridge in the corner with a small cot shoved alongside it. If Steve had to guess, that cot saw more nights than Tony’s actual bed did.
Coulson just sighed, and headed towards the door. “They’re your problem for now. Don’t do anything stupid.”
Clint gave a weak smile. “I think they just do that to people who are already dead.”
’. At this rate, I’ll be out of brain cells by the end of the year.” The brunette grumbled and turned back away from Steve, shifting back down to a comfortable position.
Bruce sighed. “I can see why he likes you; you’re just as stubborn as he is. You two are perfect for each other,” he grumbled, checking over Tony’s vitals.
Behind the trees, Steve held his breath. After seeing the figure walk away he relaxed, head swimming. He tried to get his bearings, but to no avail. His body needed more serum; it craved it. But Steve had no more serum on him.
Steve smiled innocently as he watched Tony stutter over his reply, chuckling lightly as he plucked his pencil out of the brunette’s hand. Tony scowled at him, stepping in front of Steve to collapse in his desk chair, flopping his feet up on top of the desk. “In your dreams, Cap,” Tony retorted before reaching out to grab his sketch. “Now, what do we have here?”
Barton shook his head. “No. The Monger isn’t HYDRA, he’s only working with him. Some sort of criminal consultant. No, Loki didn't mention him much. Instead, he let another name slip. I think it’s the guy running HYDRA now.”
was left unsaid.
“That’s the mystery. There are no pictures of him, if it even is a him. There are only whispers of a red and gold suit in the sky. There are stories. How he has no heart; his lover tried to kill him, but it went wrong. Killed the lover instead, moved away in solitude, shit like that. He went insane. First thing he did was start closing loops. All of them.”
Steve bit his lip. “There are suites on the next nine floors down from here. Check them all,” Steve said to his companions as he slowly began his trek across the main room. He heard Sam sigh again behind him but heard the pair dutifully open the stairwell and trudge down to the next floors.
“You sure that’s the answer you’re gonna go with?” Fury asked. “Because I know you’re lying.”
“Leave. I’ll take care of it.” The squirrelly man dipped out of Pierce’s office, no doubt relieved that he survived being the bringer of bad news. Unknowingly, the man had actually brought the best news he’s heard all day. Assuming that everything had gone according to plan.
“You fucking idiot.” Steve tried to respond again, but Bucky cut him off. “What the hell were you thinking, Steve? Your face is probably going to be plastered all over the news by tomorrow!”
“Last one on the left.”
Rhodes stood, walking towards the door. “The military doesn’t want to lose its golden egg. I’m gonna go pull some strings and get the techs looking into it. If we’ve got every possible side of the law looking for him, there’s no way we won’t be able to find Tony.”
"Come on, spill the beans.”
Tony had to hand it to the blonde, the shot was perfect. Tony always considered Barton a deadly shot; everyone on the street knew that Clint Barton never missed. The wound on his arm was just another proof of that. While Tony had originally thought that he had gotten lucky and dodged a disastrous bullet, him getting shot was just another part of The Captain’s plan. The bullet that Barton delivered went straight through his previous set of stitches; none of the doctors at the hospital, Pepper, or Obie discovered that he had already been shot there just weeks before, and Tony had the added bonus of not marring any other skin.
Steve could hear Tony’s smile over the phone, no doubt smug at such an achievement. But that was Tony for you; the man thought everything he did was incredible. Of course, Steve always thought so as well.
They’re easy to pick out in a crowd. Overlooked by most, but not by Steve. Not by anyone who’s worn the fatigues. They’re drawn to each face, staring at it like they were looking in a mirror. Knowing eyes and a faint nod, the only confirmation that they as well share the look. That they’re stuck with it too.
The other men always seemed to get a kick out Riley’s antics, but never Sam. It was if everything was a joke to him, that this job was an endless summer vacation. Sam submitted complaint after complaint, but his CO never pulled the other man off the squad, claiming that he and Riley would get along if he just let him.
Natasha huffed at the memory, entering the complex and walking up the stairs to her apartment. The carpet was worn and faded, stained with every imaginable color, and the smell of stale cigarettes mixed with cleaning supplies hung in the air. She reached the second floor and strolled over to her apartment door, equally as washed up as the carpet. She unlocked the door and stepped in, quickly shutting the door behind her.
“Oh, don’t be so dramatic,” she replied, rolling her eyes like nothing was wrong. Like she hadn’t been gone for an entire month.
“It’s not pus, it’s an inorganic plasmic discharge. It’s from the device, not from my body.”
“Steve and his other half are downstairs doing things I’d rather not think about. Doesn’t matter, you’re the one I wanted to talk to.”
People were screaming, jumping out of their cars and sprinting the over way, praying to avoid the chaotic beams. He looked down at the gauntlets in his hands. He would recognize his designs anywhere. By the powers of the blasts, Tony could only assume that he wasn’t the only one who had updated his gauntlet design.
“What?”
Steve saw a small smile grace Tony’s face, but it didn’t reach his eyes. Steve had seen how worn the man looked from before, but this last attack seemed to be eating Tony alive.
“Smart move,” Sam replied. “It’ll stop either of you from doing something stupid.”
missed you.”
But an empty suit meant that Tony was not in here. He’s probably down with the crowd, arguing with the fire marshals. Steve, relief pouring over him, image playing out in his mind.
“I’m sorry, Tony, but I have no choice but to push this. We need to keep moving forward.”
Both he and his heart couldn’t help but slump in relief, the new reactor taking over its job of keeping Tony alive flawlessly. He didn’t protest when Pepper screwed the reactor in its final place, nor when Barnes came back over and snatched the phone out of his hand. Instead he watched silently, taking careful breaths, as Pepper grabbed a towel to clean off his chest and Barnes whisper a few final sharp words to Wilson before hanging up the phone.
Weeks passed; Steve gave Clint more jobs, Clint returning with more information, not even stumbling in his work when he found out more about Steve's background.
again?”
“An obligation that, if I remember correctly, wasn’t my idea,” Tony barked back, instantly regretting that words as they slipped from his mouth. Even if Peter had never been on his radar before, there was now no life that Tony could picture without him.
“It was the right call and you know it,” Bucky tried to placate. He wasn't sure if he was saying it to convince Clint or himself. He'd spent the last few days not much better than Clint, running through Phil's shooting in his head over and over again.
“Touché, Captain,” Stark responded with a smirk. “I’ll be in touch,” he added before sauntering out of the room, giving a small salute.
“Gotta love a man who has his priorities straight,” Steve smiled, wrapping an arm around Tony as they walked to the dining room.
“Then who?”
Steve finally pulled back, his large hands coming up to cup Tony’s face. Dark circles seemed permanently etched on the once tanned face, worry lines starting to form way before their time. “You too?” Steve asked quietly.
“That’s because you’re both insane,” snorted Bruce, gathering up his things. “I’ll be back in a while to check up on him.”
Tony started to reach for the phone before his body spasmed in protest. Tony’s mouth opened in a silent scream, his gaze turning back to where Pepper had pulled out the entire magnet. The EKG shouted a litany of alarms, both Pepper and Barnes adding in the chorus with their own concerns, but Tony could only focus on Wilson’s mention of Steve.
to the rest of the team. He went so far as to assume Steve was a closeted homophobe. Of course, in order to prove his theory, Clint ended up blurting that he was gay during the first dinner he was invited to with the rest of The Commandos. What he hadn't excepted was Steve to just smile and say,
Yay for POV changes. As the story carries on, I'll most likely continue mixing up the POV's (stemming away from just Steve and Tony) to keep you on your toes. (AKA, if you want me to write about someone in particular/you don't want me to write from a certain person's eyes, now is your time to shine.)
Steve could see Tony stiffen in his chair minutely in his peripheral. How the hell could Fury know? Phil telling him was out of the question. Phil had told Tony that Fury knew what he needed to know about the situation – about Pierce. Everything else was irrelevant, and a way to protect the crew from the FBI. Knowing Phil, he’d given up anything necessary, but would leave anything incriminating about the rest of the crew out of it.
“Suspects?” Clint asked, reading the names.
Steve didn’t hesitate; he took off down the alley. Steve manages to squeeze in between a truck before in backed into a loading dock, effectively separating himself from SHIELD.
With his ideas, Schmidt could have had everything. He
Steve couldn’t help but silently preen.
“Search the place,” Steve snapped, looking warily around the room. “Tony?” he continued, calling out into the space. "Tony, you in here? Answer me, Tony, please!"
Steve grinned, obviously pleased with the answer. He took one of Tony’s hands and kissed the inside of him palm. “Let me know if anything hurts, and we’ll stop, alright?”
he had asked.
and he got off the book. All Tony knew was that he would call, and then somehow, some way, Strange would create a sterile location for him to do his work. Tony had seen him save a life in the back of a school bus once.
Tony could see the exact moment when Clint changed. Away went the broken shell of a man, only to be replaced by a hardened soldier. An Avenger. Clint pushed himself back up, his sharp eyes taking in the situation. Not even waiting for directions, Clint positioned himself over the fallen rubble. With a quick nod to Tony, the two managed to pull the piece of ceiling off of the suit. Clint shot back down to Tony’s side, looking for injuries.
“We got a lock,” Tony responded. His inner battle with his status with The Commandos will have to wait for another day.
“What?” Tony said, his voice barely heard over the crackle of gunfire. His eyes almost looked aflame in the warehouse lights, his hair manic from where he had ran his fingers through. The gun fit perfectly in his hands, his callused fingers steady on the grip and trigger. His clothes were old, wrinkled and covered in grease, no doubt the same outfit he’d worm the past two days. A fine sheen of sweat had formed on his brow, his tongue darting out to lick his lips as he panted through his adrenaline rush.
Steve clenched his jaw. “And what exactly do you need from me in order to get your services?”
“Yes, it’s perfect!”
“Jeez, not like that Tony! You don’t think I want to go and squeeze the life out of him myself?”
he almost whimpered, raw betrayal crossing over his features.
Sam tugged on Steve’s shoulder. “Come on, man. There are still agents in there.”
And then, like a candle snuffed out, the fire was gone.
“Don’t play dumb,” Stane said, rolling his eyes. “You knew Grant wasn’t The Captain’s real name, didn’t you? That’s why you wanted him all to yourself, wasn’t it? I
Everything would be okay now. Steve was here; Steve would know what to do. He could feel his heartbeat start to slow down and his body relax, hearing faint whispers of Natasha chastising him for worrying too much. But then, he froze.
“Bucky,” Steve sighed.
“Where are you going?” Tony asked.
“I know, and that’s part of the problem,” Steve frowned. “I don’t want him running himself into the ground to keep me happy. He’s been through enough already.”
Of course, there were more pressing matters at the moment.
“No,” retorted Barnes, opening his mouth for the first time. “He was going to meet with another one of Hammer’s lackeys. They took care of the body already.”
They’re going to mow down every single one of you just because you know me. Don’t you get it?
Steve just sheepishly smiled back, shifting awkwardly on his feet. Iron Man always looked like he had Steve under inspection, the stoic gaze of the faceplate leaving much to Steve’s imagination. He heard Iron Man huff a laugh, the small mechanized chuckle sending a shiver down his spine.
Another wave of pain burned through his chest. “This place is on a pier. There could be water down there to break our fall.”
Steve gave the man a weak smile, and Tony couldn’t help but lean down and kiss it as well. “I’m glad you’re alright,” Tony whispered when he pulled away, words only for Steve.
“No, I swear! I only know what they tell me, man!”
Sam cleared his throat. “I didn’t realize you knew I was in here. You’ve just been staring at a wall for like ten minutes.”
Steve huffed out a low chuckle. “I haven’t been okay in a long time.”
Steve found himself scrambling to find the right words. “
“You sit there like you’re so high and mighty, but you can’t even seem to manage your local precincts, let alone Manhattan. Who’s begging for scraps now?” Tony hissed.
“Pepper, relax,” he replied, keeping his voice calm as Clint weaved through traffic. “We’re gonna bag him, alright? Now, where are you?”
Obie shifted in his seat. "Only four dead this time. There have been worse- "
“I know,” Tony responded quickly, not giving reason for Steve’s doubt. “It’s not that, it’s just… I’ve never done this before.”
Steve stared down at the man, his body radiating pure fury. Without a single word, he stuck his hand out towards Thor, one that was quickly filled with the hammer. Not waiting for the man to try and bargain again, Steve swung the hammer around, hitting him square in his right shin. The man howled, the force from his shout almost tipping his chair over. “Huh,” said Steve, looking down at the hammer.
Finally hearing the door click, Steve would have smiled if he hadn’t seen the spider web cracks form on the window. Steve watched in dismay as the cracks continue to grow until the glass shattered, sending bits of window everywhere. Steve saw red, his rage sending him to pick up the car, ready to throw it at the nearest building.
The older man was heaving, trying frantically to control his breathing, his eyes zipping around the room before landing on Steve. He huffed out a hoarse laugh before peeling a hand away from his chest to reach for Steve. “Really, Steve, we have to stop meeting like this.”
But, Tony’s incessant tapping wasn’t coming from impatience. The brunette glanced over to The Captain’s closed office door again, thinking of the man inside. Tony would be lying if he didn’t stop to admire the man as he walked in on him sketching just earlier. The man looked almost happy; his face calm as he tracked his pencil with slow, sure movements. The man’s eyes, so determined and focused, almost caring; like his entire world was zoned in on the sketch alone. It was enough to have Tony quivering in his boots.
Clint charged over to the driver window. “Please, lady, you gotta help me. I saw a man with a gun in the alleyway!”
But he was.
“Of course, sir.”
The Captain must have gotten the notification, assuming that he and his men should be able to take on Hammer’s mediocre firepower. Keyword: should. Tony had told him it would be safe.
Hammer's man had said. That was a new one. Their prisoner hadn't denied his knowledge of Hammer's working with HYDRA, but who was The Monger? How was he involved? Maybe he was the new face of HYDRA; they had to have picked someone after Schmidt died. Whoever The Monger was, he was the next piece of the puzzle that they needed.
Steve took off sprinting for the quinjet. He didn’t even bother to wait for the rest of his team. His mind was taken over by one thought.
Steve rolled his eyes. “Quit your griping. You know he wouldn’t risk us.”
Silence then echoed through the halls, followed by a sharp hiss from Tony. “No, absolutely not. I made a deal with Fury, I’m not dropping them.”
He didn’t have the keys anymore, but Tony had all his cars coded to him anyway. His brain had more important things to worry about that where he last put his car keys. Tony started up the car and began pulling away when he saw The Captain tear out of the building after him.
Phil huffed before pulling Clint into another kiss. “What’s wrong?” he pressed again.
Enjoy!
“Oh my God,” he breathed, looking at the rest of the bodies.
“This certainly makes our visit sort of a moot point,” Tony huffed.
“Whoa, take it easy, maybe you shouldn’t- ”
But could he? They were so far into the game, he couldn’t leave them now. Not with HYDRA so close. It was too dangerous.
“I think it’s safe to assume that HYDRA’s cleared out the rest of the locations. I need you here to keep doing your job – to keep him from doing something stupid.”
“He almost didn’t. God, if I were five minutes later- ”
pressing in.
“Well,” Phil started.
he thought to himself.
Nick shook his head softly. “No, sorry. If I find one back at the office, I’ll let you know.”
Steve sent Bucky a cutting look, answering the question for him. Bucky knew that Steve, as well as the rest of The Commandos, were trained for hairy situations such as kidnapping and ransoms, but Bucky could imagine how their latest enemy could have gotten a little creative to get answers. Especially since they had Stark to dangle in front of Steve.
“Let me see.”
A sudden urge for his sketch book startled him. Sure, Tony was a handsome man, with aesthetic features that any artist would love to draw, but this was getting a little ridiculous.
The elevator roared to life but Steve could barely hear it over the thumping in his own chest and their gasping breaths. Once the contraption came to a halt, Steve clutched Natasha’s hand, yanking her onto the new floor. He could see the front door in the distance, the couple running towards it. But they never made it, as a huge vibration below them knocked them both to the ground. He could feel the building shake as foundations started to crumble, the walls starting to crack.
Tony walked up next to Steve, handing him a fresh cup of coffee. Steve just shook his head, but turned to offer a small smile to Tony in thanks for the hot drink.
“Yep.”
Months ago, in the midst of their battle with HYDRA and the FBI, the thought was so far from his mind, it was almost laughable. Now, the threat of domesticity was almost daunting. Steve barely knew what to do with his hands without having to hold a gun, let alone plan and maintain a steady relationship.
with her.
“No,” he whispered.
The Captain nodded, looking towards the door as Barnes stepped in. “Grab everyone else and get ready to move,” snapped the blonde. Barnes simply nodded and slipped out as quickly as he left. “Alright,” he said, turning back towards Tony. “Tell me about this place.”
He had been tasked with helping citizens get back to their homes safely after the rest of HYDRA had been cleared out. That’s when it happened.
And Alexander Pierce wanted it.
“Smooth,” Tony replied.
Barnes obliged, quickly stopping the car along a beachfront lot. The two men scurried out, their eyes already looking out at the river. Tony looked down at the ice with concern. “You think he’s out there?”
“For the last time;
“Clear,” he replied, his eyes seeing nothing out of the ordinary. Bucky filed in next to him, the rest of the team hot on his heels.
He’d read the report that Fury gave him. He read how Stane had almost taken Tony from him. He read how he almost walked into this house only to find it empty.
“Wait, JARVIS- ”
The blonde raised an eyebrow. “What?”
Clint when he'd first learned about them that he'd stay out of it. But this was above them all. HYDRA was above them all.
Natasha glanced at Rhodey. “The man’s a bomber. I’m not gonna give him time to prepare himself if we went through the front door and up the steps.”
Tony had countered.
He’d struggled for days, trying to think of the right thing to say. What could he say? Fury was anything but helpful, and it wasn’t as if he could use past events as reference. He was on his own for this one, floating alone in an endless abyss of water.
“Like a disease?” Sam continued. “Stark was sick?”
The two had been meeting up in Hogan’s room for over two weeks, deeming it the safest place given their current situation. No one looked twice when they saw Tony Stark slip in to see his friend, and with his resources, Stark faked Steve an ID making him look like any other hospital volunteer. Just in case HYDRA was still watching, the two never came or left at the same time, choosing inconspicuous routes to avoid detection.
“I think I’m gonna take a few days,” drawled Tony.
After walking for a while, Tony finally found himself in the midst of Hell's Kitchen. He passed easily through streets crowded with hungry tourists, cutting through back aalleyways. It wasn't long until the crowds had thinned out, leaving only the occasional resident passing by. A few more blocks and Tony strolled up to his final destination. He pulled out the keys he had grabbed from his office, unlocking a car on a small side street. Tony had, over the course of some years and with the help of Happy, deposited cars over different parts of New York if he ever found himself unprotected and in need of a fast get away. Or, in this case, a discrete way to get around the city.
“Yes?” he answered dumbly.
For the first time in weeks, Steve broke out into a smile, laughing brightly as he grabbed at Clint. “Get the vans ready!” he called behind him, the rest of the crew already on the move.
Barnes shot him a blank look. “Whatever helps you sleep at night.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t be ridiculous. Johnny Cash on the other hand,” Steve started with a grin, but Stark wasn’t listening anymore, already pestering Bruce.
Tony moaned softly, his head flopping against his chest. Steve had to be alive. He
Someone flicked him on his arm. “You’re staring.”
“A little bird from the governor’s office overheard the conversation he had with Pierce.”
WD 40 is a multi-use oil and water-displacing spray. I've heard that when leaving it on a firearm, however, the spray will dry, leaving a gluey residue that could glue up the action of a gun.
Steve walked to the pawn shop after his meal. Nodding to the cashier, he made his way to the back of the shop. The pawn shop was a front of course. Steve dropped his shield off at the back of the store, ‘
Tony's voice filtered through his head.
“You pulled the lever,” Steve whispered, mostly to himself.
“Yes, he sent me an email saying he wouldn’t be in until next week.”
"No," Tony cut him off. Unwanted images of Rhodey's prone form bleeding out on the sidewalk filtered through his head. "I don't want you caught in the crossfire."
All three men leaned forward, looking at a blurry Loki talking with a hooded figure in an alley. Clint squinted, his eyes failing to try and get a face from the shadowed figure. “Stark get a face from this guy?”
Sam was the first one to crack, much to Hill’s apparent dismay. “Fine,” he sighed. “You need someone to fly you there anyway. There’s no way I’m letting your punk ass anywhere near the pilot seat.” His new friend threw an arm around him, Steve breathing a sigh of relief when he felt Sam take some of his weight.
Once Tony got him settled, he slapped the man in the face, getting his attention.
“Hello, Steve. You look well.”
there was something you were hiding.”
Clint sobbed into her neck. “We needed you.
That old-timey Capone mob. A band of brothers, putting the mob before their own blood. Tony saw it now. He saw why The Commandos were never taken down. It was almost impossible; the group before him shared such a bond, that with each hit, they get nothing but stronger. It was Sparta; King Leonidas and his three hundred men standing guard, not letting a single man get past to their home. It was Arminius and his men, defending their Germanic homeland from invasion. It was William Wallace and his Scots battling for freedom on The Stirling Bridge. It was Davey Crocket and his fellow Texans standing tall in the Alamo’s last stand. It was Paul Revere and the Minutemen leading a revolution on the fields of Lexington and Concord. It was the Allies with one final push against a final Blitzkrieg in the British skies.
should be here.”
“Steve?” came Tony’s timid voice. The smaller man reached out slowly, hand brushing against Steve’s shoulder.
“Well, we can’t sit around and do nothing!”
“Genius never sleeps?”
“Listen, man. I’m sorry! I didn’t know- ”
The captor sneered at Steve. “The real name. Give it to me.” Steve looked at Tony who shook his head minutely. He made a move to respond as well, but was cut off as his head was shoved in the barrel.
“Of course, Sir. Anything else?”
He was a hit, of course. His Midwestern snark and easy smile were addicting, getting him a permanent spot in the family. It was Bucky who had finally approached Steve about putting Clint in the field, doing more dangerous ops. Before Steve could object, Bucky pulled out two slim hearing aids.
“Tony, what in the
Trying to fight Steve and Tony was like trying to contest the elements. Tony moved like water; fluid and unpredictable. He lets you think you have the upper hand, drawing you further out from shore, only for you to be caught up in a riptide. Or, in this case, a weaponized metal suit. Steve fought like air, able to change from a calm breeze to a destructive wind in seconds. He’s unyielding, able to take down the strongest opponents from sheer will alone. Both Avengers alone are a force to be reckoned with. But together? They were a typhoon; a vicious hurricane. No one ever stood a chance. There was never an eye to their storm, or a calm reprieve. There was only the battle, fierce and chaotic from start to finish. They came from different times, different ideals, different elements. But yet, when put together, Captain America and Iron Man are the most terrifying people to stand against.
“What’s the matter? You upset you missed all the fun?” Clint asked with a grin.
“You’ll have to be more specific, I do that all the time. It’s a hobby,” Tony chided.
Tony’s laugh echoed through his entryway as Bucky watched him and Steve step outside. “Catch you later, Barnes,” the brunette said over his shoulder as the pair made their way to their car. “Have fun at bridge!”
“Maybe it’s the weapons,” Clint added. “Stark weapons are the best on the market; mobs would go crazy at a chance to get those.”
“Don’t,” Tony snapped in response. “I don’t wanna hear anything from you. Or you for that matter,” he continued, pointing at Steve. “I just want to sit here and enjoy my soup and the lovely view.”
“Rest, Mr. Stark. You need rest.”
Tony watched as the man hit the ground, groaning softly.
“So this is what we’re going to do, huh? Just sit back and let Stark come in here and take over?” Bucky snapped. Clint flinched slightly at Bucky’s tone, knowing that he and Steve have been pretty tense the last few weeks because of Stark’s involvement.
S'alright? S'alright.
Steve closed his eyes, thinking of Tony, who had struggled to walk to the bathroom. Who had to lay his tablet on the bed because his hands were shaking too much to hold it. Who was still covered in healing bruises, leaving behind patches of a sickly yellow-green as the skin healed. Tony, who had come home with a whole chunk of his chest missing and a battery to keep him breathing.
“Steve!” Tony cried out, but Steve ignored him.
He heard Bucky snort next to him, knowing his friend probably followed along on the same train of thought.
. You just had to make yourself the bigger threat, didn't you?"
look like an actual machine now, what with the large contraption laying on top of his chest like a ticking time bomb. The eerie blue light seemed to give Tony a ghostlier look than his pasty skin. Tony had been adamant about not going to the hospital, which Steve could understand. If he was the doctor on call, the first thing he’d want to do was take it out. Of course, Bruce had popped that bubble, as well as helping in Steve heave up everything he had eaten, by showing how the blue circle was actually lodged into his chest.
Steve snorted at Sam’s outburst, Bucky pulling slightly away from Natasha to shoot the man a dirty look. “You want me to kiss you so you don’t feel left out?” Steve chided.
hissed Steve, throwing another jab. Now, his punches weren’t hitting close to Bucky, the brunette not even having to step out of the way for some of them.
Tony’s face drew grim, the man no doubt following the same line of thought. But it lasted just a moment before it was gone, Tony nodding determinedly. “Of course,” he said before smiling sarcastically. “You think we have something he’ll want to hear about?” Tony asked, eyes twinkling.
He blatantly avoided his reflection in the mirror as he wiped his hands with scented paper towels. He knew what he would see, he just wasn’t ready to face it. Clint eyed the clock on the wall. It had been almost ten minutes. He should probably head back before Tony made good word on his security threat.
“Have you?” Barton asked in a serious tone.
Steve relinquished his hold on Stark immediately, the other man darting away from his grip. Steve turned to face Stark opposite him, giving him the same death stare he was receiving. He could see people looking at the two of them; they weren’t exactly in private. But it didn’t matter, none of it mattered. Not with what was at stake.
Steve walked into the kitchen before plopping down in the nearest chair, pushing his head into his hands.
Steve gaped, his body already standing, intent on chasing after his shadow. “What, are you mad?”
Tony obliged, turning to look out of the window. He itched for his sketchbook again, wanting to forever capture the gape of Tony’s face when he finally saw it. “What the fuck is that?”
Stark nodded his head once. “Yep,” he said with a pop of his mouth. “We’re done here.”
He’d never finished. What? A shave?
“Clint, I can’t let you go over there,” Bucky pleaded, his eyes wild as he tried to grab at Clint again. “Clint,
In the sitting room stood Maria Hill. With her gun pressed against Tony’s temple.
Steve still didn’t respond, and the two shifted into an uncomfortable silence. “Well, nice chatting with you, Fury.” Steve made a move to leave, but Fury gestured for him to stay put.
Tony groaned, pushing further into Steve. “I don’t wanna. I’d rather drink motor oil.”
Which was why Tony was currently running full speed back to the cemetery. Knowing The Captain, he’d unleash his full pack of blood hounds once he knew Barnes was alive; Tony knew he wouldn’t have much of a window to escape unnoticed.
Steve ignored the please, focusing on grabbing the charge from the tip of Schmidt’s cape. Schmidt’s flight pattern grew more erratic, Steve being tossed in every direction. Finally getting a grasp on the bomb, Steve chucked it down immediately, letting go of Schmidt as well, watching as the boy flew away to safety.
Steve looked back outside. “I set up in the shed. But if I’m in there, and you’re in here, we’re going to need some way to communicate.”
He could shoot straight up to Pepper’s office, so they could undoubtedly finish the argument they started yesterday. Or Tony could cower in his lab until Pepper found him.
Tony glanced over to the clock on the wall, deflating.
"Does it look like I care about some boxes, Obie? Tell me what I want to know."
Steve sprinted over to Tony’s side, immediately finding the gaping wound in his chest. The blonde pressed down hard, frantic eyes trekking all over the husband’s injured body. He pulled an arm away to find Tony’s pulse, weak and sporadic.
Tony had to be better.
“Perfect,” Tony breathed. “Now, you need to make sure that it doesn’t touch the- ” A faint buzzing was the only warning he got before his chest jumped, an electrical shock traveling throughout his chest.
“Come on, Nat. You’ve gotta give me something. Steve’s in the hospital with the mental state that could lead to an act of terrorism. That man is going to tear up the entire state of New York if we don’t get him any answers.”
“Hands in the air!”
The Captain could just go toe to toe against HYDRA without him, and Tony would do as he’s always done: survive.
Bruce stared into his hands, trying to piece his memory back together. He felt Thor’s comforting hand reset on his shoulder.
Tony moaned, starting to feel his own body push up to meet Steve’s gentle prods.
“The Vision?”
on fucking driving because as soon as he stops, I’m going to put a fucking cap in his ass.”
“Now is not the time for us to be paying the blame game,” Tony interjected. “I mean, we could probably sit here for days talking about all of the mistakes we’ve made. But we’ve got bigger fish to fry right now.”
Tony frowned even thought his eyes were already closed. “You need to sleep,” he murmured into the pillow. “And eat. You’re skinny.”
Tony shrugged with a smile. “We could watch the sunrise and what not. Seems like the exact kind of sappy crap you’d be into.”
You’re Bruce Banner.”
He wasn’t exactly sure what his plan was when he walked into 1 Police Plaza. The NYPD headquarters was teeming with both security and tourists. Not to mention that all of the employees the building housed were experienced police officers. No, he couldn’t exactly walk up to the receptionist and ask for a walk-in with New York’s Police Commissioner.
Tony sat down in the chair carefully, groaning softly to himself. Although his arm was a constant throbbing, Barnes’s threats were the only thing plaguing him right now. Tony had been lucky that Cap was right there; he knew that Barnes could be a loose cannon if he wanted to. Tony would have to keep a closer eye on him; there was no way he would be able to win the war if he was fighting battles on both sides.
“I wasn’t supposed to,” Phil whispered, looking ashamed. “I don’t know how I managed to convince Fury that I should be here for the conference. I told him that no one would be looking out for a dead man, and it could get us a lead with Pierce, and he agreed! I knew that if you were here everyone else was and I just- I just needed to see him. One last time,” he croaked. “But I couldn’t find him, he - ”
Loki started to get up, but stopped himself. “Why should I believe you,” he asked, eyes narrowing.
"What are you doing here?" Loki asked, giving them a bored expression. "Come to get me out?"
“Get them ready.”
The doors had barely shut before Steve was on him, pressing him tightly against the far wall, his hands tracking up and down his sides, as if looking for an injury.
Steve stumbled to find his footing, dragging Natasha over to one of the abandoned desks, barely managing to cover her body with his own before the ceiling was coming down on both of them.
His chest clenched, like it had been doing in a more consistent pattern, upon thinking about the newest team member. He never thought a Stark of all people would manage to shoulder his way into his heart. In his defense, he sort of had a reputation for clashing with the people he would later consider his family. Hell, even Steve just about broke his nose when the two had first stumbled into each other all those years ago.
Bucky almost missed it, the way it was uttered so quietly. “What do you mean you can’t? Steve, if anyone’s going to find him, it’s you. What happened at the warehouse?”
“That doesn’t sound right,” he said with a groan. “Yes, stick it in, quickly,” he added, directed at Pepper. He could feel his heart pounding, rattling against his rib cage for any form of relief. “Attach it to the base plate.”
“These people I’m running with; they’re not HYDRA. Well, I think some of us are, but not everyone. It’s a separate strike group. We’re called Brimstone.”
“Don’t look at me like that,” Tony whispered hoarsely.
Tony nodded through another gulp of water. “Swimmingly; I should be good to go for a couple of days.”
“I work alone,” Steve said, his smile telling otherwise.
Thor clapped a hand on his shoulder comfortingly. “We managed to pull a victory before. I have no doubt that we shall triumph again.”
survive in Kansas. Hell, he would probably even thrive. He’d done it before, and he would do it again. And he’d do it without Tony.
to be.
Tony laughed. “You got it, Ms. Potts.”
Tony laughed, leaning up to give Steve a final peck. “I’ll be back soon. Go get some rest.” Steve watched him saunter out of the lab, blatantly ignoring the sway of his hips.
“I’m sorry?” Steve asked, finally answering Thor.
“Come on,” Rhodes said, pushing forward. “We need to find him.”
Tony’s head whipped over to Clint. “Clint? Jesus Christ, Clint, is that you?!”
“You were protecting
Luckily, the man didn’t argue, sprinting up the stairs behind Clint and back into their car. Bucky had barely pulled out into the street before Clint opened his phone to call Phil.
“For what?”
"Yeah, yeah. We're all good here." Tony looked over at Rhodey carefully. "Happy?"
Steve shut his eyes, waiting.
When Tony got a hold of his bearings, he heard a sickening creak. Looking up, he saw the support beams groaning under, the stress. Tony barely had time to gasp before he was crushed under falling rubble.
Steve moved slowly, his feet shuffling loudly against the floor. Even with the thick layers piled around him, Steve could still feel the heat from Tony’s hand on his back as the smaller man guided him into the next room. Tony led him over to a herd of chairs, carefully ushering Steve into the most padded one. A sharp throb coursed in his chest, reminded of their gathering table at their old house, now only ash and dust. Steve let out a soft groan as he all but collapsed into the furniture, wanting nothing more than to be back in bed, ignoring the world for a little while longer.
“Yes, of course. I’m heading there now.”
Natasha narrowed her eyes, picking up the paper. “Why?”
"You made me lose Stark," hissed Stane.
Please enjoy an extra long chapter as an apology for my absence.
Steve bit down hard on his lip, coppery liquid filling the inside of his mouth. This was a mistake. Fury was a mistake. Every time he opened his mouth it was to block and parry with ease, cutting down each of their own remarks.
“Garbage,” Tony answered quickly, trying to move things along. “On to the better model, now.”
The Captain crossed his arms defensively, but kept his face neutral. “Tony, come on. No one would have bought your plan.”
Bucky nodded in agreement. “Alright, alright. What do you need me to do?”
“Tony, it’s going to be alright,” Pepper tried to placate.
“Only because Barnes asked so nicely,” Tony smiled.
Bucky froze before letting out a deep sigh. “Please tell me you did not just put a bomb in my pants.”
“No,” Buck replied hoarsely. “No fuckin’ way, Steve. That’s some horseshit, right there.”
"I don't think Hogan is up for chasing you right now."
“I don’t think I’m supposed too, and that’s more reason for me to go,” Tony smiled. “Even Pepper didn’t bring it up to me. It’s a miracle I caught the reminder on television.” When the blonde pouted, Tony continued. “Listen, I don’t want to go, but I should. The reason no one told me about the gala is because they want me on the sidelines and out of the spotlight. But the entire board and my investors will be there. After the stint I pulled on them with my last press conference, I owe it to them to be there. Well, be there and not make a mess of things,” he laughed. “I do still have a day job, Steve.”
Loki hummed. “I see. Just like they’ve gone after Stark?" Hearing Tony's voice sent shivers down his spine, their last argument still fresh in the forefront in his mind. He could barely think of little else these days. "Tell me, Captain, why don’t you just ask Anthony for help? If it’s information you seek, I’m sure he’d be more than willing.” The chilling smile Loki sent Steve his way was enough to prove that Loki knew what had happened already between them.
Tony shrugged. “Is it working?”
“Well, Steve couples argue and- ”
“Fine,” she said. “You can go with him. I’ll just let my boys know to bring the handcuffs down.”
Tony huffed out a hollow laugh. “Are you joking? The FBI is holding you hostage?”
In response to that, I think I will be tacking on the other villain and pushing on with the story. But, addressing some certain concerns, this villain won't be around until at least two of the current ones are taken care of. I don't want the story to be so all over the place that no one has any idea who they're fighting anymore.
They could go on for hours, days maybe, of reasons, but Steve knew that right now it was enough, but it would also never be enough. Tony stood trembling in their arms, but Steve wasn’t sure what it was from anymore.
“Then you know why I’m acting this way!” shouted Steve. “I can’t lose them! I can’t lose you!”
“I’m already in overdrive, what else do you want me to do! I may be a genius but even I have my limits.”
Something cool was pressed up against his lips and Tony opened his mouth on reflex, almost sobbing in relief as cold water washed over the desert that had taken up residence in his throat. It was a mistake, one that he realized too late, to open his eyes. Harsh light burned into his retinas, scorching all the way inside his head.
"What do you mean?"
Steve jabbed a finger at her chest. “You’re not the boss of me anymore. And if you wanted me to sit complacent in bed, you should have thought about delivering this garbage to me after I was discharged,” he finished, wagging the crumpled list in his hand.
He saw
“I’m done relaxing,” hissed Pierce. “We’ve waited too long; The Captain and his crew are probably long gone by now.”
After Rumlow’s initial failure at Stark’s meeting with the military, Pierce knew he had to step up his game. There was no use ignoring it now; Stark was working with The Captain. This was bad news. Sure, The Captain was a huge threat to them already, but with Stark? The two of them together could tear apart what Pierce had spent months rebuilding.
“No. You said it was too dangerous. You said you didn’t want our people involved in this.”
“It’s simple military tactics. Tricking the enemy into thinking they’ll get what you want when you really get what you want.”
“So, we shouldn’t engage?” inquired The Captain.
Steve ignored him. “How do I look? Good?”
It all made sense. Thorpe had wanted to use his fake vibranium to scam the market, making him rich. The other eight code names probably coincided with whatever task they were given.
Secondly, I'm slowly going back through the story, doing some editing. Nothing major is changing, just some grammar errors I find, maybe a sentence restructure here and there. Nothing from the story line is being disrupted, it's just me trying to clean up my word vomit. With each chapter, I'll also be reading over the comments as well, going over old feedback. The story still has a way to go, and I'm still always on the look out for what you guys think the story still needs. I'm also going to be putting in a better effort to answer comments, because I've already stumbled on some instances where I haven't been answering some questions/thoughts you guys are having that I should have. (AKA, I'm gonna be less of an ass). So definitely keep the feedback coming! Know that I read it, and I love every bit of it.
“No, not us. He’s still in there!”
When he first got involved with The Commandos, there were plenty of nights that he lay awake wondering how Steve not only kept the rag-tag group together, but also drove the reins. It seemed like all of them had a reason to do what they did, and given their backgrounds, would have ended up resorting to some sort of crime in their lifetimes. But Steve, or the illusive Captain, as he was known at the time, didn’t seem to fit that mold. Of course, now he knew better. He knew why Steve was the way he was. He knew that he of all people had the most reason to be involved in what they were.
Bucky sighed, throwing the shirt on.
“What, why?”
Steve felt a weight being lifted from his chest as he relaxed into his chair, unable to hide a small smile that formed from hearing the teasing voice.
He could see Barnes’s head loll to the side, Tony immediately grabbing at his shirt and shaking him. “Don’t you dare fall asleep, Barnes! Your lazy ass has to help me.”
Steve obliged, swinging the door open, breath immediately getting caught in his throat. Past the wooden entryway was a surprisingly spacious room, walls adorned it a rich blue, accented by bright scones. A large desk, probably mahogany knowing Tony, lay facing the pair, lush chair sitting behind it. A personal bar sat atop plush rugs, nestled nicely between a long couch and matching armchair. The wall along the left side was left oddly bare, while the back was consisted of one giant bookshelf, the wall to Steve’s right made entirely out of glass.
“You’re late.”
“Itches. Burns.”
Steve smacked Bucky’s wandering hand away. “No, I’m fine,” he snapped. “I’m not talking about yesterday, I’m talking about before that.”
“You give me one first! The last we heard, there were two explosions at Stark Industries. Is everyone alright?”
“Now hold on, you can’t just walk onto my property like you own the joint! Leave before I- ”
Steve shook his head. “He refused. And then,” Steve broke off with another sigh.
The sight that was waiting for them, however, was one that Tony wished he never had to see.
Tony winced. Steve swearing did not mean good things. “Steve, I’ve got a whole lifetime of lunches to have with him. What’s wrong with me missing one?”
“I’m sorry, Mrs. Hogenson,” Steve sighed. “But our liability is spelled out in paragraph seventeen. It states clearly that- ”
“I know; I’m trying to work on it.”
“Yes,” Tony answered breathlessly. He peeked down, Steve’s erection prepped at the starting line, waiting for gun shot.
Tony froze. “You didn’t.”
"You're right," Steve continued. "It's not his usual MO, but HYDRA isn't only making plays against us. They're responible for the bomb that put Hogan in the hospital, as well as the murder of your employees."
Natasha snorted. “If this mission was supposedly ‘easy’ for you, where did this come from I wonder?” Without a moment’s hesitation, she shot an arm out, punching Clint on his bruised ribs. Clint groaned loudly before falling dramatically off the couch, which was quickly filled by a smiling Natasha.
“Well, I can’t hold being hired muscle against you. You may leave.” Steve stepped aside, watching as the two men sprinted out of the room.
Stane rounded Pierce’s desk and grabbed him by the lapels of his jacket. “The explosion at The Captain’s base.
” Tony broke off, starting to smack at the side of his head.
Bucky crawled over to the address, pounding on the door until his arms vanished. “Wait, please!”
“What an ass,” he heard Clint breathe.
“Yes,” Steve answered, feeling his ears turn pink. Tony’s gaze softened, tilting his head back to look at the sky.
Steve startled. “I’m sorry?”
It was a different warmth.
The woman walked over to the sidewalk but chuckled softly. “Oh, no need to worry, Captain. He’s quite tame!”
“It’s not about whether I agree with- ”
Which of course, was the plan, before three SUV's came tearing out around the corner, screeching on their brakes in front of the Sharma shop. Steve immediately placed himself in front of Tony, throwing the first punch before the first assailant had finished opening the door.
