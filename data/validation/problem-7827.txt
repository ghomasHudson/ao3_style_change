“Maybe,” Tony muses, and shuts his eyes again.
“He’s not a guardian angel,” Bucky said, rolling his eyes.
underage drinking.”
“I’m not the one who made her pancakes with - am I tasting chocolate chips in here?  You really gave my child chocolate for breakfast?”
“Does the public really need an in-car hologram?” holo-Rhodey says from Tony’s dashboard.
"No you won't," he says, lighting a second cigarette for her and another for him.
“I don’t know, didn’t we used to brush our teeth together sometimes?”
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Tony said.
should be running it instead?”
And that’s when the signal’s cut off by the blast of gunfire.
“Well, it doesn’t show,” Tony says, and Steve laughs, and Tony’s relieved as hell that their salads arrive at exactly that moment.
“Not a word, boss,” Friday says.
Steve raised his eyebrows.
“Because it amused me,” Thor said.
He rents a car from a guy operating out of a defunct Honda dealership and drives an hour and a half to a cabin that overlooks Lake Tahoe.  It's not quite snowing but it’s cold enough to start, and when Steve walks in through the side door he finds Tony in bare feet, standing over a pot on the stove.
Tony sighs.  “Yeah, put him through.”
"Nice to meet you," Banner says, looking down at his glass.
“We can sneak you out the fire escape if you don’t want to run into Bucky,” Steve says seriously.
doing it for me.”
“But he’s considering it,” Stark says.  “That’s a big step forward.”
“It’s a feast,” Thor said smugly.
brush your teeth?  Come on, just answer me, please?”
"And me," Steve continues, "I'm familiar with it, too.  Different organization, different goals in mind, a little more government-sanctioned, maybe, but at the end of the day, we both came out of it different than we went in.  You and me, we're cut from the same cloth."
Tony pinches the bridge of his nose.  Downstairs, he can hear the dishwasher running.  “Give me forty-five minutes.”
“You read minds, right?” Tony said conversationally.
tell you that her and Master Odinson’s heat signatures are… very close.  To each other.”
“Stark!” Banner snaps, loud enough that everyone jumps, and Tony’s eyes fly open.
“I’ll race you to the pool,” Steve said, and vaulted over the side of the balcony to land on his feet in the grass a full story below.
?” Natasha says, furious.  “Get the hell out of here!”
“She was good, I’ll give you that,” Tony says.  “But you belong with the team too.”
“Being married to a badass has its downsides,” Tony said sympathetically.
“And?”
“Peter caught it,” Steve says.
“Maybe I just like salad,” Bruce said mildly.  “What were you saying about dental hygiene?”
“Yup,” Tony said.  “Surprise!”
“Well, I’m famous for being afraid of the unknown,” Steve said.
"And if you weren't such a coward," Steve continues, watching Bruce's jaw work, "you might have actually been able to
Miss Romanov leans across the bar, biting her reddened bottom lip.
“Pretty far to come for a glass of moonshine.”
“Do children not drink on Midgard?” Thor said, frowning.
“You followed me all all the way to Wall, South Dakota to give me my
“Captain Rogers is in the building.”
“Jarvis’ll make sure everybody clears out.  Or not.  I don’t really care.”  Stark yawns and tosses an arm over Steve’s chest.  “You can stay.  If you want, I mean.  No pressure.  Jarvis makes great pancakes, if you’re into that kind of thing.”
It’s not even remotely weird, Tony thinks as he pushes Steve onto his bed.  There’s a lot to look at - not that Tony hasn’t seen it before because hell, he makes the guy’s uniform, he knows
“I thought we deserved it,” Stark says, sliding her a glass.
you are?  What a pathetic reason to stay alive."
One of Killian's men takes a running jump at Stark, but Steve dives in front of him and catches the goon with a right hook to the jaw.  The man flops backward, and one of his friends steps in to take his place; Steve swings again and again, listening to Barton go head to head on his left and Odinson on his right.  The fourth guy seems to be weighing his chances against Banner, who's still sitting on his barstool, and Stark, whose arm is smoking a little from the whatever-it-was that blew up a minute ago.  Killian, of course, is no where to be found.
“I wouldn’t count on it,” Steve says wryly.  “You can’t just call me up at work, you know.”
“And I never agreed to work with you,” Rogers says.  “I’m running my own op, if you want in you’ll have to go through me.”
"Name's Rogers," Steve said.  "Can I buy you a drink?"

, and that was awesome.

“I know, but I came to find - I came for
“That’s still a few years away,” Steve said.
But instead he kisses him.
“Yeah, I know,” Tony says, and collapses into the chair across the hallway.
“Both.”
Tony takes the stairs to buy himself some time - he didn’t think about what he was going to say, and he definitely didn’t expect to do this with an audience, but he should’ve figured Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum would be here, pecking like mother hens over their precious Cap.
apologize for this, I thought the highlight of today was gonna be Thai food, we are already
"This is a private conversation," Steve growls.
“Yeah, when I was like
“Oh,” Steve said.  “Yeah?”
“You’re the one who brought him along!”
“Whoa,” Clint said.
“That’s what they say,” Steve says.  “So are you busy here, or would you want to grab some dinner?”
“Not you and Cap,” Bruce contributed.
to be a date, there’s no way Steve would walk around looking like that if he didn’t want this to be a date, that would be
“We have operations of our own throughout the city,” Coulson says.  “Intelligence agents who handle all kinds of criminal enterprises.  And we can always use people with your… particular skills.”
“I’m sorry, what exactly is it you think I’m doing here?” Coulson interrupted.
Steve doesn't reply.  He has no idea where Tony and Pepper stand, and even though Tony's hand is currently working its way up his thigh, he doesn't really see it as his place to ask.  "I've never been here before," he says instead.  "Used to be ski resorts, right?"
Steve throws back the rest of his drink and slams the glass down.  "Thanks again for the hand back there."
now, huh?” Clint said with a snicker.
“No, the first sign of trouble was when he showed up,” Stark says.  “We’re better off without him.”
"He'll be back," Miss Romanov says.  "Try again tomorrow, Rogers."
Tony nearly choked on a gulp of prosecco.  “I’m just gonna move past
Tony flips them until he’s pinning Steve to the bed.  He’s grinning as widely as Steve’s seen in a while, and Steve can’t help but grin back.  “That’s only if you drive under the speed limit.”
“Hey, guys?” Scott says, poking his head around the corner.  “Uh, just so you know, you’re being kind of loud.”
“I mean, it’s not like I have a lot of options,” Tony said, taking a swig.  “When I asked Edgar if he had any McCallan, you’d think I kicked his cat.”
this but just now he can’t imagine not.
"We’re ready here," Tony says over the loudspeaker.  He's got all kinds of medical readouts going in the observation room, heart rate and blood pressure and adrenal glands, to see if they can pinpoint what works.  If anything works.
“Whatever you say,” Stark murmurs, burrowing into his pillow, and Steve’s gonna slide out from under his arm and find his clothes and head for the subway in just a moment.
The men are efficient and not exactly gentle as they pat down first Steve, then Banner; Steve holds his breath when they get to Tony, but the man moves on quickly.  One of them turns toward Miss Romanov with a leer, but she steps closer to Steve and he throws his arm around her.  “Not my girl,” he says firmly.
"Oh," Tony says.  "Nothing.  Might go check on one of the plants tomorrow, but Pepper mostly manages things on this side of the country."
“Nah,” Steve says.  “I went all the way to LA in the middle of the night for a fella once.  Didn’t even get laid.”
Steve snorts and puts out his cigarette, grabs the apple off the railing.  Tony always brings snacks, even though Steve's the one who always wants to eat after sex, and as Steve takes a bite Tony asks, "Do you have to leave?"
Through the speakers, a potent mix of 90s hip hop emanated.  Clint had disappeared, possibly for more wine (or more nachos), and the parlor suddenly felt very, very private.
Tony stared at Steve, who stared back.
“Okay,” Pepper says.
“Honestly, I don’t really remember.”  Nicola grins at him.  “We always had a good time, huh?”
“I’m sure they do,” Tony says.  “What the hell were you thinking?”
“I’m aware,” Steve says.  “Maybe I just like the company.”
The Ukrainian woman behind the counter doesn't even look up as Steve passes through the deli the next day, and Steve has to hand it to Miss Romanov: she's bold as brass, running a barely-operating sandwich shop above a speakeasy in the smack dab middle of Midtown.  It's so obviously a front, Steve thinks, that people must assume it's
“Mr. Stark’s a man of many talents,” Hogan says.
The voice was almost like a hand trailing its way down Steve’s spine.
to do this.”
“I have some ideas,” Steve says, “but I didn’t ask.”
.  “I don’t see how this doesn’t fit the definition.”
“So what, you’re immortal now?  Impenetrable skin and all that?”
Steve shakes his head, steps back onto Broadway, and disappears into the night.
Banner sighs.  "Who sent you?"
Tony’s surprised that it feels that big, that
But Steve doesn’t seem to notice: he’s digging into his sixth taco and talking about some vacation him and Wanda went on to Ohio (Ohio!  On vacation!  Who
“Thanks for coming,” Steve says, and Tony looks around as Cap lowers himself into the next seat over.
Steve leans back against the wall.  It’s for the best; he’s not
“Give me those,” Steve said, taking the plate out of Clint’s hands.  “You’re gonna spill.”
Pepper gives Morgan a hug in the doorway and laughs as she climbs up the stairs telling Steve all about how she wants to build her dolls a swimming pool but Mommy says it’s not practical.   “So,” Pepper says while Tony shuffles into the house with Morgan’s bags, “not that it’s a problem, but why is Captain America playing with our daughter’s dollhouse?”
and Tony tightened his grip on Steve’s hair and bucked his hips forward, just a bit.
were smarter than this.”
“Try on clothes,” Clint said.  “Hold hands.  Steal shit.”
Banner fiddles with the edge of his jacket and looks up at Steve.  "Emil Blonsky doesn't let his people socialize much.  You come in, you do your work, and if you're lucky you go home at the end of the night in one piece.  Your friend - "
“With the power of this scarily competent Strategic Science Reserve behind us, we might be able to make some real changes around here,” Tony says.  “Not that I’d ever work for anyone but myself, but if

him,” Bruce says fiercely.  “And we couldn’t have done that without you.”
“Yeah, but we weren’t on TV or anything.  Were we?  We weren’t, right?”
“Bucky?” he says.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says, and he looks it, too, which takes
“Eh,” Steve said.  “You know.  And a couple of the Howlies - well, fellas got up to what they got up to.  What they still get up to.  Fine by me.”
“Not to mention a friend with deep pockets and a couple of engineering degrees,” Natasha says.
“You’re an agent for the federal bureau of investigation,” Natasha says.  “Let the right people know that you’re looking for secondary employment, and Blonsky might come to you.”
“Why?” Tony said, exasperated.  “What difference does it make?  So you spilled your guts to me a few times.  Who cares?  It’s not like I can tell anyone.”
“I mean, not that we know of,” Scott says.  “But do you ever think we should have, like, a second headquarters?”
“I can,” Steve said, rolling his eyes and undoing Tony’s button, yanking his jeans down so that Tony’s cock popped free.  “I can’t wait to get you in my mouth.”  He looked up at Tony, a blush staining his cheeks again.  “Can you just - try to not listen to anything I say?  Thanks.”
“It already did, once,” Tony says.
“I thought you said we had work to do,” Steve said, arching an eyebrow.
“Well, maybe you should try it out sometime,” Tony says, and they go back to watching the kids.
Finding Clint at the base of the second flight of stairs, she leans in for a kiss, which he gives her easily. "You're fixing to give that poor shy bastard a heart attack," he breathes into her mouth as she pulls away.
“Probably a lot,” Steve said.  “But at least I don’t wear open collar shirts that are way too young for me.”
"Sure," Steve says, glancing around.  "You haven't happened to see Banner around tonight, have you?"
Tony’s all ready to ignore the cyclone with a face until a water creature with an entire
Pepper steps up next to him, slips her hand into his.  “I don’t want to move back.”
Steve rears back like Tony’s taken a swing at him.  “Jesus, Tony, you are unbelievable - ”
“No longer than most,” he replies, accepting the glass but not taking a drink.  “It’s crowded in here tonight.  Any customers giving you trouble?”
And then Clint yelled, “Cannonball!” and jumped into the water, creating a splash that drenched all of them.
, Steve.  I try really hard to get things right, but we both know that at the end of the day I cause a lot of my own problems, this one included.  I didn’t want you to see that side of things.”
Steve hesitates for a moment at the door.  The room’s dark, and he has no idea what could be in there; more than that, he has no idea if he really wants to be alone in a dark, locked room with Tony Stark.  He doesn’t trust the man, and - even worse - he doesn’t trust himself.
.  He wants to go back further and get it all right with Thanos, years ago, so none of this ever happened in the first place.
“You never let us do anything fun,” Clint whined.  “Why don’t you ever - ”
“Five seconds, Captain,” Hank Pym said into the comms.  “Four, three, two - ”
instead of just vaguely annoyed.
“Sorry, Mr. Stark,” Peter says, but Tony’s been going too easy on him lately, clearly, because he’s smirking.
“Yeah, I have a quote for Mr. J. Jonah Jameson,” Tony says.  He takes a deep breath.  “He’s welcome to criticize all he wants, free speech and power of the press and all that, I hang out with Captain America, I know the first amendment.  This investigation, whatever it is, that’s all just talk, and I know exactly what it will turn up and what the results will be.  But here’s the thing.  To Jameson and anybody else who wants to do more than just talk, who wants to put on a suit - a
“It sounded like fighting.”
“Probably,” Thor chimes in.
; it was infuriating.  “Maybe you’ve even thought about it before - me on my knees, I mean - ”
He looks a little less uncomfortable than he did last time he was here, and Natasha pours him a glass of the moonshine just to see what happens.  “Long day?”
"I thought you were in Geneva this week," Steve says, stuffing a pillow into a threadbare pillowcase.  He strips the bed before they leave, re-makes it with whatever clean sheets he can find, always, just in case someone comes home, even though Tony always says there's no point.  Tony does his research.
“This is... my department’s secretary,” Steve says.  “And you are - ”
“Yup.”
“Why’s that?”
“It’s just that usually when somebody leaves town, it’s because they want to be alone.”
Clint glances at Natasha.  “You could always draw ‘em out.”
Not that this is easier than marriage, though.  Leaving Morgan half the time, waving to Pepper from the car while Morgan runs down the front steps with her My Little Pony backpack, keeping the smile on his face until she’s out of sight when Happy drives away with her again a few days later - no, it’s not easy.  Tony made the first Iron Man suit in a cave with a box of scraps, Tony fought aliens and robots and gods, Tony
“Yes,” Steve said.  “Assuming what you were about to say was ‘have sex with you.’”
Steve spins around.  "You need something, Stark?"
The noise gets louder as he edges through the crowd to the backyard.  The band is set up on a stage next to a swimming pool, and the air is thick with laughter and cigarette smoke.  Almost everybody has a drink in their hand, and Steve doesn’t recognize a single person.
“It sounded like you being a judgmental asshole, actually.”
Steve flops back against the pillows and surveys the room.  It’s spacious, just like everything else in the house, classy and elegant, but also a little… empty.  It doesn’t feel lived in, and it
The 3D figures zoom backwards, then start up.  The helmeted man dives again, and -
chargers on your side, I pilfered
“It comes and goes,” Tony said.  “I have, you know, a lot of time to myself.  Time to think.  So that’s good and bad.  Mostly bad, if I’m honest.  I don’t know how all of this shakes out for me, in the end.  Or even if there is an end.  I’m kind of like Schrodinger's cat at the moment, so mostly I’m just trying not to look in the box.”
"Damn right you will," Barton grumbles.
“Oh,” Steve said.
"Thanks, Ma," Steve says dryly, and Tony flips him off over his shoulder as he disappears out the door.
Banner opens his mouth.  "Why - "
“Oh my god, that is hilar -
“Did he,” she’d said, “did he go in the fight, or with - or with everybody else?”
“Don’t sound so surprised,” Tony said.  “I told you I’d figured out how to pinpoint days, did you not think I could do it?”
Steve shrugs.  “Not bad.  Only took a couple days.  Oh, and I went to that great Chinese place in Greenwich Village that closed in 2014.”
Tony narrows his eyes.  “Come on, doc.  I’ll just bug you until you tell me and you know it.”
“Seems like you figured it out eventually,” Steve said, rolling his eyes.
Banner shrugs.  “I’m still not actually sure it’ll work, but - ”
“Well, sure I can,” Hogan says, “but it’ll take you ages to get into the city that way.”
“Including kidnapping, apparently,” Steve mutters.
“I lied,” Natasha said.  “He’s cute.”
“Works for me,” Steve says.

or he’ll vibrate out of his skin.  He twists his hands together behind his back and says, “Just trying to keep busy, I guess.”
"I already know how to knit."
“Yup.”  Morgan barely glanced up as her dad appeared holographically next to her at the dining room table from 150 miles away.  Kids these days, honestly.
This was a
“I didn’t say that’s what I wanted,” Steve interrupts.  “I said I’d take that if that’s all you want to give.”
“Captain America doesn’t speed.”
It was kind of hard to follow - they all used slightly different slang, and wouldn’t stop talking over each other, and anyway Tony was only on his first cup of coffee so his comprehension skills hovered around 20% at best - but eventually he heard Steve snap, “Shut
"So I was kind of celebrating but mostly not," Tony finishes.
“Jesus,” Barton says, sounding stunned, and the few goons who can still move of their own accord stumble to the stairs to escape.  Steve doesn’t even care: he crashes across the room, the blast still echoing in his ears, and falls to his knees beside Tony.
“I’m kind of out of the habit after, you know, being in hiding for the past couple of years,” Bruce said apologetically.
“He didn’t tell you?”
“Something like that,” Steve says.  “Ready?”
Pepper doesn’t rise to the bait, which irritates Tony even more.  “Being there isn’t going to help anything.”
“Yes,” Steve said, quietly.
“Steve!” Tony says, feigning disapproval.
Tony winces.  “We only go flying in Pennsylvania, munchkin.”
Just before midnight, his phone buzzes.
Stark leans even closer, and Steve holds his ground.  The other man is completely in his space now, their bodies nearly touching at the chest.  Stark's lips are slightly parted, and if Steve leaned forward he could -
“It’s not all you have,” Tony says.
Tony looked down at it.  His brow furrowed.  When he looked up, Steve couldn’t tell what he was thinking at all.  “Your death certificate?”
Tony studied him intently, like he was looking for something, and then he shoved his hands in his pockets and smiled, a small, wistful kind of smile.  “You’re not afraid of anything, are you.”
“Sometimes,” Steve said, writhing under Tony’s lips and his hands, tracing a winding path up Steve’s inner thigh.  “Sometimes I’d probably just tell you how much I want you.  I think about it a lot, I don’t want you to know how much I think about it, please kiss me so I can
, Tony thought,
And then, taking his glass of wine with him because Tony Stark was
“It’s not - I don’t know.  I don’t know, okay?”
But Steve didn’t want to hear it, whatever it was, so he leaned in and kissed Tony, twisted his hand in Tony’s shirt and held him tight, and when the world started changing around them he closed his eyes and thought, to
“I have a question,” Tony said.  “I mean, that’s a lie, I have literally a
Stark’s smirk flickers for just a moment.  “Funny thing about that is that I reported it myself in 1917.”
“I wouldn’t want to spend my last night on Earth with us either,” Clint said, spinning a plate on each pointer finger.
“You used being Captain America to get the Palace to
"Huh," Tony says.  "That sucks."
Steve elbows him.  “You trying to get rid of me?”
“Cool,” Tony says.  “The second one is, uh.  Well, it’s a little more complicated.  You know how, with universes, there’s more than one?  Well, I found out that we aren’t the first universe to beat Thanos.  We’re a branched one.”
“Wait, how come you and Steve are hooking up and
“Stuck in the quantum realm,” Tony said.  “It was kind of a last minute call, I would have done things a little different, but, you know, I didn’t have time to run the calculations.  Clearly, I didn’t
“No?”
Steve stiffens.  “Not that.  I’m… looking for somebody.”
“Real smooth, Stark,” Steve smirked, and leaned across the table to press a bacon-y soft kiss to Tony’s lips.
“Well, then, that answers that,” Tony said, undoing Steve’s zipper and drawing his cock out of his briefs, keeping his touch light and teasing.  “You want me to keep going?”
doing, meanwhile, is destroying the very careful equilibrium I’ve spent years building.  And we can’t have that, son.  That’s not a game you’re going to win no matter who your friends are - who they are, or how many Midtown skyscrapers they’ve built.”
, anybody could have
They take turns showering, and when Steve walks into the kitchen in his sweats he finds Tony fully dressed next to a bag full of protein bars and fruit.  He grabs an apple and pulls open the sliding glass door.
"Barnes," Steve says.  "James Barnes."
“Science, mostly,” Tony said.  “Pushing the limits of what we know about time and space.  Oh, I went to Peter’s wedding a couple months ago.  He didn’t know I was there, of course.  Happy cried the entire time.”
Tony, who thinks about such a scenario pretty much every night before he goes to sleep, winces.  “We would address that through the criminal justice system just like we always have,” Steve says, and his voice is steady but Tony can tell the questions are wearing him down.
“You following me, Hogan?” Steve says, turning to Hogan with a wry smile.
“You’re reading, but you have the TV on too,” Tony said.  “Which means you’re not paying attention to either.  So.  What are you thinking about?”
Every head in the room whipped to Steve.
“Good thing I wasn’t making you any,” Strange says.  “Any other questions?”
“I think you’ll have better luck,” Steve says.  “He looks up to you.”
But there was food in the fridge and his ma had taught him you could make a casserole out of anything, so he pulled out everything that hadn’t already expired and decided to test her wisdom.
“Yeah, that’s fair,” Tony says.  “Okay.  I’m just gonna say it.  I think I have a crush on Cap.”
of messes lately, haven’t you?”
Sam’s birthday, twenty minutes ago.  It’s not anymore.  Steve’s missed it completely.
. The floor he’s arrived on looks like it’s one large room, brightened by light bulbs that hang from the ceiling and cluttered with - well, with what looks mostly like trash to Steve: hunks of concrete, all kinds of tubing, sheets of glass and twisted up metal.  Strewn across one large table is the wreckage of what looks like an entire automobile.
“Who knows where they went?” he snapped at Bruce, Steve and Clint.
On the one hand, they’d all agreed that the quantum time machine was a dangerous technological advancement, only to be used under the most dire of circumstances.
“I’m sure Bruce and Natasha weren’t too sorry to get some space.”
“Oh, you know,” Nicola says.  “I blipped.  My husband didn’t.”
"Oh," the bartender says, wrinkling his nose.  "Really?  Are you certain?"
“Don’t believe everything you read in the Wall Street Journal.”  Tony grabs a fry from Steve’s container.   “Do you ever think about if we should have done things differently?”
“Yup,” Steve said, gesturing for Tony to lead the way.
“You can’t send me to my room,” Clint said.  “You’re not the boss.  Steve, do I have to go to my room?”
“He’s a dick who a lot of people listen to.”
“I set the table and you successfully slowed me down,” Bruce corrected.
"Care to dance?"
“It better be, considering I stepped out of a meeting with the Secretary of Defense to answer it,” Rhodey replied.
“I give up,” he said, and then, because everything apparently hated him back, he accidentally hit send on a single letter “p”.
could move on as quickly as everybody else.
"Oh, yeah?" he says, as she steps to him and undoes his tie, loosens his collar. "What do you read in me?"
But Steve is already gone.
“Friday,” he says out loud, ignoring Steve’s pained gaze, “we good to fly?”
“Stark - ”
“What?” Tony says.
“Maybe I should write it down,” Steve mutters, and takes another burger off the pile.
“Well, after fifteen years as coworkers things can get pretty heated around the water cooler.  Don’t you have an essay due in twelve hours?”
“It’s a flyover,” Tony interrupts.  “That’s it.  Cap’s gonna be on the ground, if he needs backup I’ll be there and if he doesn’t, they won’t even see me.”
"You keep your hands on that shelf," he tells her as he yanks her hips into his, increasing the pace.
Wanda looked up at him with narrowed eyes.  Tony still sometimes got the feeling that she trusted him about as far as she could throw him - which was admittedly pretty far, she was cool like that - but that meant it didn’t surprise him when she said, “It depends.”
“If I wanted to see you dead I would have done a lot of things differently the past few days,” Steve said, snatching the bottle from Clint’s hands.
“You ready for it?” Stark says, and throws Natasha a wink.  “Here it is: duck.”
“I know that too.”
"And ladies."  From out of the smoky gloom, a woman glides up to the table.  Her dark red hair is done up in tight, close-cropped curls, and her dress leaves just enough to the imagination.  "I hear we have an unexpected visitor."
important enough?"
“It’ll work,” Stark says confidently, and Natasha adjusts her estimation of him: he’s even smarter than she thought.  “So Romanov, what’s this Barton tells me about Schmidt’s boys stopping by?”
instead of bells?”
don’t want to fall for a classic Tony Stark line.”
They started on the first floor and worked their way up.  Steve stared at everything in awe and kept getting distracted by escalators; Bruce seemed hyper-aware of the way the crowd parted for them (well, for Tony) and tried to disappear into his too-large jacket; and Clint, bless his soul, was the only one brave enough to accompany Tony into Victoria’s Secret.  Tony was going to buy the kid a Lambo when he got old again.
“I could say the same to you,” Stark says.  He shoves his hands in his pockets and strides out from around the bar.  Natasha sees Rogers’ eyes widen fractionally as the guns follow Stark’s movement.  “I’m serious.  I’ve seen Romanov’s books.  She’s not exactly raking it in.”
"You worried it'll kill me?"
,” he hissed, sitting bolt upright.  “What the - ”
“How could I forget Happy?” Nicola says.  “He’s a doll.  He used to keep aspirin and ginger ale in the glove compartment.”
“Clint and Thor’ll be on their tail,” Miss Romanov says.
"Netflix is terrible these days."
“You picked the wrong side in all of this,” Steve says.  “The city may be sick, but you’re what’s making it sicker.  We won’t let you get away with it.”
“Yes!” Thor boomed.  “I’m thankful for Jane, who changed my life so thoroughly with her warm welcome to Midgard.  I’m thankful for my family, who have shown me much patience as I find my way.  And I’m thankful for having a team of such strong warriors to fight alongside.”  He looked around, beaming.  “Oh, and Cheetos!”
“Ha, ha.”
“Luckily, Captain, I’m not ashamed of enjoying carnal pleasures,” Thor said smugly.
“Same as everybody else,” Steve says, thinking of the nearly-healed stab wound in his shoulder.  “Bootlegging, weapons, hits - be hard to find anything below board in New York that doesn’t come back to him.”
“Then we’re all in a lot of trouble,” Tony said, poking his head into a Bath and Body Works and withdrawing immediately due to the smell.  “Come on, you guys should be better than this, what do teenagers like to do at the mall?”
"You seem to have a history with him," Steve points out.
“Of what’ll happen if it doesn’t work?”
Steve swallows, adjusts his tie.  “Yeah.  Same to you.”
Steve shrugs.  “Maybe.”
“Damn it,” Steve swears, “Stark - ”
Everyone groaned.
“Out of the country on a mission.”
) had emerged from their rooms by the time the pizza arrived, so Tony set everything up, leaned back in his chair, and just waited.  Frankly, he’d have happily locked them all in their rooms until they grew up, but JARVIS said that was unkind and not a long-term solution and also that he’d show the footage to Steve when they were adults again, so Tony eventually caved and called out over the comms system, “Dinner’s on the table, last one out does the dishes.”
Strange raises an eyebrow.  “Let me guess.  You were just in the neighborhood?”
a relief,” Stark says, and when Natasha starts laughing out of pure adrenaline none of them are able to stop for a long, long time.
“Tactical genius like you can’t think of any solutions for that?”
“Mr. Stark?  Are you listening?”
“Huh,” Steve said.  He pulled out Thor’s elixir bottle and took a sip.  “Wow.”
Tony whistled.  “Not bad.  You make that kind of money as an insurance broker?”
Steve glanced at him.  “
“You didn’t,” Tony said.  “Not at all.  Never been less uncomfortable in my life.  Dictionary definition of comfortable?  See: Tony Stark.”
Steve tries not to think about that too hard as he approaches the door off the alley just past the corner of 55th and Broadway.  The alley smells like grease and garbage and everything else a New York City alley usually smells like, and when Steve opens the swinging door there's nobody in the storeroom of the deli.
“More or less,” Steve said.  “I told her not to worry about it.  She had some choice words for that.”
“Should someone go after him?” Bruce said uncertainly.
“Enough that even you’d be welcome, Mr. Stark,” Coulson says, and Tony snorts.  “We’d like to ask all of you to maintain your discretion about Pierce and the other agents who were involved in last week’s incident.  In exchange, we’ll agree to look the other way about any low-level illegal activity going on in the building, and we hope that we can look forward to a further partnership with all of you.”
"I should go," Banner says.
"Not even a little bit," Tony says.
“It’s not just about food!” Clint said, pointing at him with the baster.  “It’s about - it’s about the whole - everything!  Pilgrims!  Football!  We live with
“And then I said honey, if that’s a four pound roast, then I’m a professional golfer!”
“I can imagine she did.”
Huh.  One night stand.  That was probably not
"What?" Steve says.
, so he eats a sumptuous breakfast in the palace ballroom and then hangs out in a conference room for twenty minutes before T’Challa shows up.  “Sorry to drop in unannounced,” Tony says, because his mother raised him to be polite to royalty.  “There’s a situation.”
“I once woke up after a 70 year nap,” Steve said.  “I know weird.”
“You know, Tony,” Steve said thoughtfully a week later, “a lot of kids think you’re Santa Claus.”
Stark appears in the center of the crowd with a grin, and Steve grins back.  “I’m only here to shut this place down.”
“Sam would probably say something obnoxious, like that it’s my subconscious trying to process grief alongside my unresolved emotional attachment.  He’d probably be right, but don’t tell him that.”
“Come over,” Tony says.  “Morgan would love to see you.”
“I mean you’re staring at Cap,” Peter says.  “What’s up with you guys?”
“I wasn’t trying to get away from you,” Steve says.
Tony gapes.  “Did you seriously jump out of a plane without a parachute to teach me a
.  I like it.”
"Of course Tony would have a baby grand in the library," Bruce remarks, his fingers idly tracing the edges of the black keys. "No keeping quiet in here."
Tony smirks.  “So do you have a place to sleep in this one-horse town or what?”
?” Jameson says.  “Guilty?  Ashamed of your choices?”
“Are you sure you don’t want to take them back to SHIELD?” Tony wheedled.  “I’m sure you could do a lot of fun superspy science on them.”
.  “You’ve imagined me in the suit?”
“If you really think I’m a figment of your imagination,” Tony said, “why do you think your brain picked
“Still might be worth it.”
She leads Bruce up the stairs, down the hallway past five closed doors, and into a room which turns out... not to be a bedroom. It's Tony's library. Two stories tall, circular, a wraparound balcony halfway up, accessed only by a spiral staircase. There are red velvet couches. A globe. And, sitting in the center of the central column, a baby grand.
Steve is that Tony has bothered to not only find him, but to walk into the only bar in Wall, South Dakota, sit down at the next barstool, pull off his sunglasses - which he’s wearing
“I’m not drunk!” Bruce insisted, mopping up the spilt wine ineffectually with his napkin.
"Complicated," Stark says with a smirk.  "I'm still getting to know him."
Stark jerks his head at the band.  "C'mon, I love this song."
“I happen to have a very demanding social life, actually.”
“I’ve never asked for - ”
Stark’s house is huge.  He’d seen that from the outside, of course, but somehow it seems even bigger up on the second floor, with its endless hallways full of doors and not one of them, apparently, containing a linen closet.  He wonders what it would be like to live in a house where you couldn’t hear somebody calling to you from one end to the other.  Steve can’t remember the last time he’s been far enough away from his nearest neighbor not to hear them sneeze.
“That bad?”

“Well, I said it twenty minutes ago, too, and nobody listened to me then either - ”
“Was it just a drunk thing for

having a ton of sex with you?”  He tilted his head, like he was considering it, and then he leaned in and pressed a firm kiss on Tony’s lips.  “I’ll pass.”
“If you weren’t so good at cooking I’d throw you out,” Tony said, turning back to his coffee.
There’s nothing else to say about that, so they don’t try.  Tony glances at Steve and then away, back to the skyline.  The silence should be awkward, but it’s - not, actually, and on the bench, the back of Steve’s hand brushes his; his little finger rests on top of Tony’s, not pinning it, just resting there.  Tony waits for him to murmur an apology, move away, and when he doesn’t, Tony realizes he’s holding his breath.
Tony’s sitting in the pilot’s seat running a liftoff sequence.  “I’m not.”
Bruce stares at him.  “Cap?  As in… Captain… America?”
“She’s a very mature six.”
“He did,” Steve said.  “That’s what the whole sugar and burnt hair smell is.”
Steve winced.  “Maybe.  I think.  I’m pretty sure, actually.  And for the record I’m only telling you because I think you already said it on accident.  And also because I have a feeling you won’t remember any of this tomorrow.”
Miss Potts turns to Steve with a smile.  “I don’t believe we’ve met.”
“And the Black Widow once again proves herself a competent thief!” Thor rumbled from the commentator’s box up behind home plate.  “The score is six to five, with the Winter Soldier holding the bat.”
Four men walk into the warehouse; Steve’s stomach flips over, but none of them are Bucky.  Steve counts seven guns between them, and that’s just what he can see above their clothes.
“Okay, good,” Tony says.  “Because, look, don’t take this the wrong way, you don’t
Steve snorts.  “Okay.  Dinner.”
Tony still has plenty of bad days, and some of the worst are the ones when Morgan leaves.
“It’s a long story,” Steve said.  “We’ll talk about it later.”
” Tony said, waving his hands.
“She asked so nicely,” Steve says.  Behind the counter, he reaches out and brushes Tony’s hand with his.  “Hope you don’t mind that I took over pancake duty.”
“Do you think it’s too big?” Steve said, frowning down at the atrium of Stark Tower.
“They’re sixteen years old,” Coulson said.  “They can take care of themselves.”
“Hi,” Tony said.  “Mind if I sit down?”
“Nightmare?” Tony says, pulling up a feed from her room.
“I heard,” T’Challa says.  “Captain Rogers is all right?”
“It was one time.”
“Touche,” Tony says, and kisses him.  It should be weird kissing Steve whenever he wants, or at least weird how
“I’m not a cop.”
“Not at all,” Beck says smoothly.  “But I do think there’s room to ask a few questions.”
“So it’s like a thing-thing.”
Everyone goes quiet.  “Excuse me?” Stark says.
“There are a lot of issues with this plan, you know, starting with the fact that we don’t even - “
Steve shakes his hand.  "Busy night?"
“If wine did anything to me I’d’ve been drunk by noon,” Steve admitted, a smile threatening his face.  “Which I… also didn’t mean to admit.”
“If you’ll excuse me,” Steve said abruptly, standing up and smiling tightly at Peggy.  She smiled back and then turned back to Shirley, and their voices faded away as he wound through the busy restaurant and burst into the restroom.
“Yeah, we don’t have car phones anymore!”
“Tell him he’s already walked through me twice,” Tony said.
Tony sighed.  “You know, I thought maybe an orgasm would buy us, like, five minutes silence.”
“Sure.  Whatever you need.”
“I can definitively say I do not need a toothbrush,” Tony said.  “In fact, my problem is that I have too many toothbrushes.  My cup runneth over with toothbrushes.”
There was a moment of silence, and then - loudly - the sounds of five teenagers pounding up the stairs, dropping Xbox controllers, and just generally causing mayhem on their way to the dining room.
“He’s lying,” Natasha said.
There’s a sudden explosion of gunfire, and Steve rolls under a table as bullets hit the wall behind him.  “Give it up, Rogers,” Pierce says from across the smoky room.  “It’s just like Stark to save his own skin when it comes down to it, so I can’t say I’m surprised, but I thought
Steve rolled his eyes as he tore the cardboard away.  “I’m not sure most history textbooks say ‘TV’ is what defines the modern era.  There, you think?”
Steve smokes another cigarette and waits half an hour before he finishes getting dressed to leave.  The stairs are covered in family pictures he didn't notice on the way up, when he was pulling off his shirt and sticking his tongue down Tony's throat.  He looks at every photo on the way down, one at a time, carefully, and wonders which half of these people he killed.
“Nick,” Steve said, clearing his throat.  “How’d you find us?”
“Yeah, I think that’d be best,” Steve said.
“I could always dare you to do it,” Steve said.
“We got ‘em,” Clint says.  “They’re set up in East Harlem, by the water.  Not a huge operation, just a couple’a guys who look like scientists and a dozen or so hired guns.”
Bruce had found footage of the Hulk destroying Harlem, which was too bad, but he’d also watched at least seventeen episodes of Cheers, which was
“I guess we won’t know until we try,” Vanko says finally.  “We’ll be in touch.”
“Have you considered the possibility that I’m not just doing this for you?” Steve interrupted.
“I’m not taking out a Times Square billboard or anything but I just assumed, he’s your best friend and all - ”
idea, but it’s not like we have an HR department.  Hey, stop looking over your shoulder, they’re gonna catch you,” Tony said, grabbing Steve’s chin and forcing him to look straight ahead, which, entirely coincidentally, happened to be right at Tony.
his smirk.
“I beg to differ,” Tony says.  “It’s tight in here, sure, but shift that barrel over and we’ll have plenty of room, and I don’t mind scuffing up my knees one bit - ”
Peter’s face lights up.  “Wait, are you guys doing it?  Was I
Steve shrugs.  “Lot of things bother me.  I try not to waste too much time on the ones I can’t do anything about.”
“I’m in Brooklyn,” Steve says tensely.  “But I think I’m going to - ”
“Exactly,” Tony says.  He turns back to the Mark LIV.  “Got work to do.  Catch you on the flip, Jolly Green.”
tonight.
"Skiing?" Tony's hand creeps higher, the tips of his fingers sliding over Steve's hip bone, sweeping around the curve of his ass.  "Nah.  You'd be good at it."
"Cap?" Bruce says, a little hesitantly.  "You ready?"
“What do you mean?”
“I don’t know, do I?” Tony said.  “I’m supposed to be
Avenger?”
Strange nods, and takes a sip of the tea that’s just appeared in his hand.
“Anything you want,” Tony says, waving his hand at the walls and nearly spilling his glass.  “All yours, pal.”
“That’s disappointing,” Tony said, trying to be cool even though he was about one second from turning into a puddle of goo at Steve’s feet.  “Cause normally you’re pretty competitive, so I was kinda expecting you to be a little more focused on the game, you know?”
“It’s funny, actually,” Stark says, looking around at all of them, “Schmidt’s men showing up here, just a few days after Killian.  It seems like the Widow’s got a target on its back.”
mad.  “Pull it together, Stevie.  I’m gonna get old standing here waiting for you to stop makin’ goo goo eyes at Stark.”
“She’s not in the neighborhood,” Fury says.  “Unfortunately, you all are the best I’ve got.”
“Somewhere over Pennsylvania, boss.”
Clint turned to the rest of the team.  “
“You have got to be kidding me,” Tony murmurs.
"Yeah," Steve says, and then Tony's quiet for a long time, and absolutely nothing is ever right anymore but given the circumstances it's not exactly wrong, either.
To everyone’s relief, Christmas itself was quiet.
It rains the entire ride through Oklahoma.  He gives Texas a wide berth and heads north again, and he’s all the way to South Dakota before he realizes his cash is about to run out and he’s no further from what he’s trying to get away from than he was when he left New York, so he checks into a motel and considers his options.
“He’s very loyal,” Clint said.  “Nat, remember that time that contractor tried to get pictures of you sunbathing?”
“That’s the most romantic thing you’ve ever said to me,” Tony says.
interesting.
Tony sighs and shuts his faceplate.  “I hate it when you’re right.”
“The city’s rotten,” Stark says.  “I’m not talking about the speakeasies - they’re business establishments meeting a need, it’s the government’s own fault that most of them are run by the mob - but the whole core of this city has gone bad.  I just want to try to safeguard whatever small parts of it I can.”
Steve watches the kids play for a while.  Across the playground, Morgan pops out of a slide with a shriek.  “It’d be messy,” he says finally.  “Keeping my head down.  Or creating a new timeline, more likely.  I’d have to be pretty desperate.”
?  Attention, sure, these guys always wanted attention, but it never ended there.  What was the goal?  What did they
“Too much?” Tony says, and when he looks up at Steve he’s a little bit defiant and a little bit hopeful and Steve smiles at him, the muscles a little rusty but surprisingly willing, at least at the moment.
“I never intended to tell you that,” Steve said seriously.  “I know you don’t feel the same way and the last thing I would ever want to do would be to ruin our friendship and working relationship, I - ”
“You have a smudge,” Natasha said, and then - and Steve wouldn’t have believed it if he hadn’t seen it with his own two eyes - she licked her thumb and reached out to rub Bruce’s chin.
Steve raises his eyebrows.  "I just told you I'm an officer of the law.  What makes you think I'm gonna tell you my name?"
It’s only two and a half blocks to Strange’s place, and Tony puts his head down and hoofs it, just a New Yorker trying to stay dry.  When he gets to the big doors he hesitates, just for a second, and then he thinks
“I didn’t say anything about the rest of you,” Tony said.  “You’re welcome to celebrate the traditional American values of overeating and imperialism however you want.”
“You awake?”
“Very well,” Vanko says, and the men back off.   “So, Agent.  We hear you’re interested in an arrangement with the boss.”
Tony takes a good look at him.  This time yesterday - or was it the day before? - he was getting pounded into mincemeat.  Today his bruises are going green and yellow, and the skin all around his eye is bright red, freshly scarred.  “Well, at least the ugly won’t last.”
being the operative word,” Tony said.  “I was short.  Google it.”
But when Steve looked back, Tony was gone.
“It’s not about that.”
Natasha gratefully takes it between her lips and draws.
“I’m getting bored, actually,” Peter says, tossing the vase from one hand to the other.  “Wanna go throw them off the balcony for me?”
at him because even if they are friends these days he’s
“We’ve talked about this,” Steve says.  “Two of us will draw attention.”
“Thanks, pal,” Tony said wistfully.
The man narrows his eyes and lunges, and Stark holds out his arm and - and
“That sounds fascinating,” Shirley said.  “I was in a steno pool for a few years before Bob and I got married.  Do you meet a lot of important people?”
"Not sure why it matters to you," Steve says.
Thor smiles warmly at her; he's seen her play this game before.  He's brighter than he looks, her Norwegian boy.
Steve fights back a blush and hands him a bottle off the nearest shelf.  “It’s not like that.”
Stark turns to face him.  “If you are, I want to help.”
“Do you still have to brush your teeth?”
"Heart rate up," Tony says.
“Why, fingers getting itchy?” Tony said, watching as the energy sensor on the time machine approaches 100%.
, but - if you want to, I want to.”
“Okay, slightly more fun,” Stark amends, rolling away.  “I’m gonna go to sleep, you want to go to sleep?”
“Have you considered having a conversation?”
The room was quiet for a long, peaceful moment.  Tony’s breathing slowly returned to normal, and Steve was a warm, comfortable, sweaty weight on top of him, and Tony didn’t really have any urge to move at all.  And then -
For the first time, Steve looks at him.  “Seems like she was pretty good the other day,” he says, so casually that if Tony didn’t know him so well he’d miss it, but it turns out he
And Steve, who was, frankly, exhausted of Tony’s commentary, said, “Not as often as you’d think, all things considered.”
He sauteed.

“We were training when Friday told us another elemental had shown up.  Well, Parker and I were training.  Cap was breaking punching bags,” Sam says, nodding in the direction of the jet overhead.  “Speaking of, I think he’s about ready to head back to the city.  You need a ride home, Spiderman?”
Steve doesn't get involved in whatever's going on between them.  He catches them together sometimes in the kitchen, heads bent close, murmurs passing back and forth, and on other days he sees them avoid each other's eyes as they pass in the hallway.  This, Steve thinks, is why
“If I tell you something, do you promise not to give me a hard time about it?”
,” Tony says.
“It’s all taken care of,” Steve said.  “I’m coming back.”
“Because I’m a spy,” Nick said.  “And Edgar texted me.”
“You’re all grounded,” Tony said when they got home.
T’Challa raises an eyebrow.  “Somehow I don’t think I’m going to enjoy this conversation.”
It's true; they recently put Bruce in a room with a grenade, and the Hulk showed up only long enough to yell, "Puny Banner!" and crush it in a fist before he disappeared again, leaving Bruce holding a smoldering scrap of metal and scowling.
Natasha smiles bracingly at the boys - her boys - and nods, just once, at Clint.  “That sounds all right to me, Director,” she says, and stands up.
“I wouldn’t mind my meeting back,” Steve says mildly.
Tony slid under the covers and settled himself on half of Steve’s pillow with a contented sigh.  “It’s no Tempur-Pedic, but it’ll do.”
Natasha’s heart leaps into her throat.  She runs out the door behind Clint, who looks over her shoulder with a frown.
“I felt bad about it but Tony made me promise not to say anything,” Steve said.  “Also the Hulk’s penis is huge.”
“C’mon, didn’t you say you’re a New Yorker?” Steve said, puffing out his chest and heading down the block.  “Real New Yorkers take the subway, pal.”
Natasha turns around; behind her, a man with fists like wrecking balls thunders down the hallway.  She doesn’t even have time to consider whether to go for the knees or the solar plexus before Banner grabs the man by the collar and slams him up against the wall.
“I don’t want to hear any more about all the different ways to cook tardigrade meat,” Steve said.
Steve quickly recounts his drive with Pierce and its aftermath, and when he’s done they all look at him expectantly.
to understate it.
"Stan sent me," Steve says warily.
nicer.”
“Because you’re dead,” Steve said.  He swallowed a mouthful of walnut chocolate chip.  “And probably a couple of other reasons.”
“Oh, yeah,” Steve said.  “I saw it on TV.  Thought I might have to pull it down myself.”
“Not at all, but now that you’re a ridiculously attractive grown man again, we are back in business,” Tony said, swatting Steve’s ridiculously attractive grown man ass and pressing a kiss to the corner of his lips.  “I’m guessing you won’t want to call me Daddy anymore though, huh?”
Thor had googled terms ranging from “sneakers” to “McDonald’s” to “hella” to, and Tony

.  Yeah, that was more like it.
“Dum-E, I swear, one of these days I’m going to paint a clown face on you and then everyone will know the truth, you are a mess, seriously - who’s at the door, J?” Tony said, not looking up at the knock.
“Me?” Tony says.  “Not at all, why do you ask?”
“Well, yeah, but you were drunk.”
He went sprawling, a tangle of scrawny arms and knobbly knees that was about as far from the peak of human perfection as anything Tony had ever seen.  It wasn’t
Tony took a large gulp of wine and then continued, because hey, why the hell not, “And I don’t say this kind of stuff very often so don’t get used to it, okay?  Thor, I’m thankful that you’re here because, man, you’re a really good time even if your taste in food is garbage.  Natasha, I liked you when you were my PA and the crazy thing is I actually like you
Peggy stared at him, unconvinced, and probably annoyed too, if Steve was reading her right.  “All right,” she said finally, and after she turned the light off she looked back at him, but Steve just looked down at the countertop until her footsteps had padded back up the stairs.
“Good,” Steve said, and Tony winked at him and jogged back to the plate.
“Fair’s fair.”
“I can’t recommend it, sir,” JARVIS said.  “The mass confusion and potential for outsider intrusion…”
“It means that you came here, to this time, because for the first time you were doing what

“I actually wanted to show him someone was listening,” Steve says, looking frustrated.
the fun out of it.  “I didn’t mean to - ”
There's only one thing for her, when she's in this kind of mood. She turns, looks both her male employees in the eyes, lets her gaze drift purposefully down their bodies. Pulls them flush against her and kisses Thor, then Clint, keeping a grip on both their ties while she does it. Clint smirks at her as she pulls away, his eyes hooded as she undoes his tie, then his shirt collar.
“What am I looking for?”
Steve falls into a crouch, and when the man with the knife dives he goes low and takes him out at the knees; they scuffle on the floor, and Steve's just about to stomp the knife out of his hands when somebody comes from behind and sucker punches him.
“Depends who’s asking.”
“Pete,” Tony says.  “You know I trust you.  I trust you with my life.  Literally.  All the time.”
“Honestly?” Steve said.  “It was almost kind of nice to fight.  Better than the silence, at least.”
The door swings open, and Barnes looms in the frame, looking unimpressed.  “Stark.”
Steve doesn't plan to go back to the Black Widow.
“That’s very hands-off of you,” Wanda says.
“Okay, boys, settle down,” Natasha soothed.  “None of this matters because we’re listening to Destiny’s Child.”
“I never wanted to call you Daddy,” Steve said, sliding his soapy hands around Tony’s waist.
Steve looked up sharply.  “Of course I am.”
The front door opens and Steve steps out and
“I think that’s because you’re usually the drunk one,” Steve says.
"Let's get a hotel room," Tony said, like that was that, and somehow - and Steve never could explain how, not then and not now and not later - it was.
“What a tragedy.”  Tony wandered into the kitchen after him, swirling the dregs of a glass of wine.  “I get it, though.  I mean look, I emailed my accountant today.  Stupid, right?  If we survive long enough to pay taxes next year, I’ll happily give the IRS whatever it wants - hell, I’ll write them a thank you card for it.  But it was kind of nice to do something… banal.”
“Yeah, I got that.”
"The feeling's mutual," Steve retorts.
They sit in silence for a while.  Tony considers puking again, and decides against it.  Next time he opens his eyes, Steve is still there.  “You can go, you know.  I’m not gonna die.”
“I’m always honest.”
He slams the button for 502.
“It was,” Steve said.  “Hey, Tony?”
Steve narrowed his eyes as he approached.  “What’s wrong?”
“Sure do,” Steve says.  “How’d you find me, anyway?  Tracker on my bike?”
"Thank you," she says, more quietly than she means to. He nods jerkily and reaches for the door, presumably to close it behind him so he can make his way to his shower.
“You did follow me all the way to Wall, South Dakota.”
“It looks like probably not,” Tony finishes.
“No, I’m good,” Steve says.  “Are you good?”
“I think I’m watching the Rogers-Carter household enter the modern era.”

“A ball indeed!  One that seemed reasonably slow and hittable to me, but then again, that is why Son of Coul is the master of the game and not yours truly,” Thor boomed.
Tony froze, or at least he thought he did, he
measurements, at least.”  He leans in close and slides a hand along Steve’s inner thigh.  “Like getting you out of your clothes, for example.”
“Don’t mention it,” Tony says.  “I mean seriously, don’t.  I didn’t pay import taxes on the vibranium, I’m not a billionaire anymore, this could sink me.”
They all spin toward the staircase to see a man in a dark suit step through the doorway.  Steve steps forward automatically, and out of the corner of his eye he sees Barton reaching under the bar and Natasha’s hand sliding to her waist - but then someone else steps through the door and Steve freezes.
Tony frowned.  He was drunk, and it had been a
He even baked, a little bit, with results so disastrous they wouldn’t even tempt the Hulk.
"Well, if you say so," Steve said with a shrug.
“I feel like you’re not saying quite what you mean,” Tony said.
It’s past midnight on a Thursday in March when Steve looks at his phone and realizes it’s Sam’s birthday.
Peter frowns.  “How could that be for the best?”
“Morning, boss.”
“Not for wine,” Natasha said.  “For spelunking.”
He releases a deep breath in the hallway.  It’s empty, thank goodness, but from around the house he can hear the sounds of people waking up: quiet voices murmuring, throats clearing, water running.  He’s not the only one who spent the night in the mansion, it turns out.  At the bottom of the stairs he spots a young couple wandering out to the backyard with their shoes in their hands, and as he passes through the front parlor he finds Odinson asleep on a massive sofa with his arms around not one but two women.
“Sorry, boss,” Friday says.
"Not that kind of missing," Steve says.  "He was involved in some - some secretive business.  Declared MIA in '18, but he never came home in a box or otherwise."
Steve obeyed.
“Okay, don’t

Tony drags himself out of bed.  “Was I

"I hope they are," Tony says.
kind of first.”
"You're setting a bad example for America's youth."
Steve picked up a plate of turkey and stuffing and handed it to the next kid in line with a wide smile and a ‘Happy Thanksgiving’ that was surprisingly sincere, considering it was probably the 500th time he’d said it that night.  “If it means that much to you, Tony, sure.”
They stared at each other.  Tony could (vaguely) remember Steve being brave last night, so.  He figured he kind of owed him one.
“I’d do it for you.”
“I keep things here.  This is actually Natalie Rushman’s permanent address.”
“Is that it?” Stark says into the darkness, and Steve’ll be damned if the man doesn’t sound disappointed.
Steve arched an eyebrow.  “Oh,

Steve wonders when he stopped being okay with this thing with Tony being nothing.
Tony glances at him.  He’s looking out the window, the wind ruffling his hair, sunglasses on.  Steve is like a river - calm on the surface, but with depths beneath that you can’t necessarily see until you dive in, and Tony - Tony thinks he wants to jump.
"I hadn't heard."
“Nobody else can hear me when I talk to them,” Tony said, a little distantly.  “Did you really just use the word ‘crush’?”
Steve narrows his eyes.  “Tony - ”
“What are - ”

"Christ, your hands are freezing."

“What happened here last week was… unfortunate,” Coulson says.  “We’d known for months that there was a double agent inside the bureau, but nobody had fingered Pierce.  If word got out that a high-ranking member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation was the head of an organized crime coalition, the entire law enforcement community would suffer.  It could set us back years in our efforts to bring the criminal element of New York under control.”
Steve turns slowly.  Banner hovers in the doorway; he's wearing his jacket but no hat, and his too-long hair curls around his collar.
“It’s lucky you don’t get drunk more often, I’d be going broke,” Tony said.
“But you would have, if I’d suggested it.”
“Would it make you feel better if I lied and said hungover?” Steve said, looking amused.
“Friday,” he says, but he doesn’t need her silence to know she won’t reply.  It’s an EMP, intense and localized, and Tony has all kinds of defenses against exactly this type of attack but Beck’s a goddamn

“I wonder if that counts as treason.”
“Do you think eating four thousand calories in one sitting is good for your health?” Clint said, leaning back in his seat with a groan.  “Because if not, I probably shouldn’t do any PSAs either.”
“No, because I don’t just move in places without being asked,” Steve said.

Steve smiles as Tony slides his hands around Steve from the back and bats away his hands from doing up his buttons.  “That’s the kind of thing people do in the morning, you know.  Get dressed.”
“ - and not just the politicians but the mobsters too, Killian and Blonsky and all of them, and they won’t just arrest you and put you out of business, you know they won’t, they’ll - ”
“Because I got the message, okay?  Loud and clear, no worries on that, so I’m never going to bring it up again and with a lot of time and maybe some really high quality drugs we can both eventually forget it ever happened, so let’s just finish up this inning and - ”
“They better be, I don’t have all night,” Stark says.
“I don’t mean where on your body, the obvious answer is
“So if you’re not the boss,” Clint said, turning back to Coulson, “and you’re not one of us, who are you?”

“I was about to ask you the same thing,” Tony said.  “You’re out here pitching like you just graduated from t-ball, what’s going on with you?”
“Ye - ”
He asked her careful questions about work, mindful never to imply that he had knowledge one way or another, but ultimately he could tell she always thought he did,
be missing accurate weather reports right now,” he said.
“If you say so,” Tony says.  He tightens the string of his undershorts.  “Sure you won’t stay for breakfast?  No, I guess not, I’m sure you’ve got plenty to do - Happy can give you a ride home.”
“No,” Steve says.  “I mean - the shield.  The weapons.  Everything with - us.”
“Hey, hey, I know,” Tony says, holding up his hands.  “I didn’t mean - sorry.  I didn’t mean it that way.  If I want out, I’m out.  Nobody’s keeping me here.”

“Will do.”
"Once or twice," Steve says, accepting a full glass from Miss Romanov even though he knows it won't dull the pain.
"I'd love one, sweetheart."  Killian winks at her, and Steve's stomach curdles, but Miss Romanov just smiles blandly and pulls out a bottle of gin.  "We can count it toward your late payments."
“Everything okay?”
“We should have destroyed it,” Bruce said.  “You

“Is this a trick question?”
"I wasn't planning on it, ma'am," Steve says.
“There are a lot of things I didn’t used to do,” Steve says, watching lightning roll silently across the horizon. “Seems silly not to do them now.”
“You’re not going to talk me out of this, Tony,” Steve said.  “It’s decided.  You know how to find me in the future, right?”
“Good luck,” Wanda said, and rolled her eyes.
“You can’t possibly think I’d do that,” Tony said.
“Agent Rogers?  You’ve got a phone call on line number three.”
“Oh yeah?  Well, I am.”  Stark slams his glass down.  “You and Barton still planning a run to Harlem tomorrow night?”
“Ugh,” Tony said.
“Well, I didn’t,” Steve says, and takes a step back, leaving Tony slumped against the wall with a sense of whiplash.
Steve groaned as Tony sucked a bruise into his throat.  “Tony, faster -
“We’re not moving back,” Tony says.  “It’s for the team.”
we get back,” Clint said with a grin.
“Pretty sure you wouldn’t waste a dare on that.”
“You saw Peggy today.”
Stark pulls a face.  “In that case, I may have a proposition for you.”
.  It was a meeting originally, but you know.  Whatever.
“Not allowed, young lady,” Tony says around a yawn.
“He said not to interrupt you.  It’s not the first time.”
And then he lifts his arms and shoots a burst of fire from each of his hands.
“Okay,” Steve said.  “And, uh - I have to guess that my older self will be appreciative if we don’t mention what happened earlier today.  Ever.”
“I want you to fuck my mouth.  I want you to - to do it
“I’d like to,” Tony says.
“Thanks, Jarvis,” Stark says, and the man disappears again.  “My butler.  Just shout if you need anything, he hides behind corners until you call for him.  You having fun?”
“Nobody,” Steve said.  “Myself.”
?” Bruce grumbled.
“Steve’s gonna be pissed,” Clint warned.
Steve shrugs.  “It’s all fair.”
Steve crossed his arms.  “It’s funny, you say you’re real, but the Tony Stark I knew never gave up on anything.”
“And no one at SHIELD is willing to provide a remedy for the good Captain even though he inhaled this noxious substance while rescuing people from

"In a public place," Stark counters, and Steve wants to
“So what do you think it is?”
“ - but Cap just jumped out of the plane after you.”
Tony ignores all of it.  He reads Morgan bedtime stories via holo and repairs the Mark LIV and has his PR people decline every interview invitation and request for comment, even when they beg him to
“Well, can you blame them?  Last year’s vintage was pretty unimpressive,” Natasha said.
Steve snorted.  “Yeah, that was a huge sacrifice.”
“It’s just that I think it’d be kinda nice, if you showed the kids of New York that Santa is alive and well in the city.”  Steve leaned back in his chair.
about?”
"Won't work.  It has to be somebody who knows how to get under my skin.  And I think it has to come from someone I care about."
“Have a good rest of your trip,” Tony says.  “Give me a call when you get back.  Or not.  Up to you.”
“Have you seen J. Jonah Jameson’s latest video?” one woman yells through the hubbub.
“ - a real problem,” he finished, to complete silence.
“Then let’s be crazy,” Tony says, and kisses him again.
“No, really?” Clint said, rolling his eyes.
“Yeah, I just said it doesn’t have to be a thing.”
“Yeah, I’m pretty fucking obvious, huh.”
“Yeah, you’d have to rent out the Tower to pay the grocery bills,” Clint said, licking his fingers.
“Good,” Tony said.  “That’s - I’m glad to hear that.  It’s just that sometimes, I see you, and I think, huh, you know, he doesn’t look
"Yes," Romanov says.
“A few things,” Steve said, honestly.  “See you soon.”
“A therapist once called it an irresistible draw to self-destructive tendencies,” Tony says.  “I fired her immediately, obviously - I didn’t call you because that’s who I
Steve holds up the shield.  “This is - it’s real nice, but I - I don’t think I can pay for it.”
Fury glares around at all of them, presumably just because he can, and then pulls out a scratched up smartphone that Tony can politely describe only as
Barnes looks up, and Tony’ll be damned but he looks
“Who said I did anything?” Tony muttered, throwing the ball back to Steve.
“Try me,” Steve snaps, and heads down the hallway.  “There should be another door at this end, if we could just - ”
“Whatever you say, Cap.”
“To new bosses,” Steve says, shooting Tony a grin as he lifts his glass, and Tony grins back.
A waiter passes by, and Tony grabs two more glasses of champagne.  “To all the mistakes we’ve made.”
you’re about to throw up,” Steve said, sounding exasperated.
“Did you expect any better?” Tony says.  “It’s not new information to you that I’m an asshole.  Jeez, one magical night and it’s like you forget who I am.”
Natasha shrugged.  “There’s no antidote.  It’ll work its way out of his system in a few hours.”
“I find it hard to believe that you want to leave everything behind
“I’m pretty sure of the two surprising things going on here, you being alive is the bigger one,” Tony said.
“Yes, sir,” Steve says stonily.
“No,” Steve says, heading back toward the elevator.
“Hope I didn’t interrupt anything,” Clint says, pulling his knife out of the back of the man’s neck.
Steve takes a sip of his drink and looks around.  The Hawk is still watching them, but nobody is in hearing distance.  "FBI.  But I'm not Prohibition unit."
“And they even thanked me for my service,” Steve said, looking a little smug.
Steve smiles back as she sashays to the other end of the bar to murmur something in Barton's ear.  The room is packed full of people - people dancing, and talking, and laughing, and suddenly Steve feels like he sticks out like a sore thumb.
“You only love me for my cars.”
“You can’t blame me for making the most of an opportunity.”
"I think they're planning to reopen one of them this season," Tony says.  "My parents brought me here once.  My mom was a great skiier.  She used to ski the Alps when she visited her grandparents in Italy."
“Did you recognize any of those men?” Rogers asks Banner.
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Stark says.  “All right, get back to work, my taxes aren’t paying for you to stand around and talk on the telephone!”
Steve looks up to see Stark watching him smugly.  “How’d you find out?”
Tony swivels around in the pilot’s seat.  “What the hell was that?”
“Yeah, he’s fine,” Peter says into his earpiece.
“That’s right.  Just me.  Because this city, it’s in a bad way.  Our politicians are either anemic or they’re corrupt.  Our people are lazy and false; they demand abstinence out of one side of their mouths while they pour whiskey in the other.  New York City is the best America has to offer, and it’s
“Whatever.”
, as he steps out onto the landing pad for the first time in years.  From inside the penthouse, he can hear Morgan running around, exploring the oversized closets and the furniture she’s never seen, asking Friday a million questions and giggling at the replies.
“Reasonable,” Coulson says.
“I was actually going to ask you if you wanted this gun,” Steve says, holding it out sheepishly.
“Well, you’re definitely not like my dad,” Tony admitted, and sent a splash in Steve’s direction.  “Chill out, Cap.  Nobody likes a moody drunk.”
“Especially if you go in with back-up,” Stark says.
"Well, he sure can throw a punch," Steve says.  "If you see him, can you let me - "
“Hiya,” he said, taking a dainty sip.  “What’s going on over here?”
“Drunk?” Rhodey suggests.
“God, you’re obnoxious.”
Morgan puts down her crayon and considers it.  “Can Cap come?”
“I’m familiar with the situation,” Steve says dryly.  “So what, you’re trying to take them down?”
“Honey?”
“You’re
"Calling it that definitely isn't helping."
Steve blinked at him.  “Me?”

“Fuck, I love you,” Tony breathes.  “Friday, you didn’t hear that.”
“It was,” Tony says, because there’s really no way
Tony’s jaw dropped.  “Are you saying - ”
“Friday, I told you, nothing gets through unless it’s Morgan or the world is ending, and the second one is only a maybe, use your judgement, I believe in you,” Tony interrupts.
It started one night when he was dying his hair.
“Sure,” Tony said, and he was backing away into the shadows, already fading.  “Sure I can, Cap.  Sorry about all this.  About everything.  I’ll, uh - yeah.  I’ll leave you alone.”
“You think this is about
He takes a winding route to Midtown, doubling back almost all the way to South Ferry before hopping on the Broadway and Columbus Avenue line as it pulls away, and even still he circles the block a couple times, looking out for a tail he might have missed, before he ducks into the deli and heads down the stairs to the bar.
of wrapping paper.”
“Not much,” Steve says.  “Just that it went a different way once before, and he wished it hadn’t.  So he changed it for us.”
“Can I give you a ride, Agent Rogers?”
"You want hot cocoa?" Tony greets him.  "I promise not to throw it at you."
“You’re gonna make this really difficult, aren’t you,” Steve said.
“So badass,” Clint said smugly.
Things happen really fast for a while.
“And, uh, what does Miss Hill have to do with all this?” Steve says.
“Yeah, I remember,” Banner interrupts, and Natasha can see a vein throbbing in his forehead.  “But once I start, I can’t always stop.  I’m not - I’m not like them, I don’t actually like hurting people, but I don’t always have -
“Ugh, don’t say that in front of her,” Tony says.  “It’ll send her ego through the roof and she’s already genetically predisposed to that so we have to watch it - the other day I caught Happy telling her she’d make a good CEO just like her mom.  Which by the way, excuse me, I was also a good CEO.”
Tony, who was genuinely surprised and thought he was hiding it, said, “That was just, like, a
“We’re not babies,” Clint said, his too-long bathrobe trailing behind him as he wandered out from the kitchen.
“Boys,” Miss Romanov says quietly, and they all freeze as the door slides open, allowing a sliver of streetlight into the warehouse.
“Well, give it a rest.  You’ve done enough, Tony,” Steve says, and it’s the biggest load of bullshit he’s ever heard but Tony doesn’t bother to call him on it.
of robot arms, Tony thinks irritably as yet
The driver pulls up next to an alley, and the car rolls to a stop.  Behind them, Steve hears the second car pull up to the curb and cut the engine.
“I’ll rest easy,” Miss Romanov says.  “We found a few things ourselves, in the mess from Vanko’s office.  Him and his boss have some… plans.”
“Thanks,” Barton calls after him.
Banner looks at him through narrowed black eyes and then turns around to grab a fella sneaking up on Barton from behind and slam him into the wall.  It’s always the quiet ones, Steve thinks as he turns back to his own fight.
“Touche,” Tony said.  “How’re things with Peggy?”
“I did have a life before you met me, Tony,” Clint said.  “Maybe I was super into wine.”
“Welcome back,” he said.
“Why wasn’t I informed of this?” Nick said, rounding on Natasha and Clint.
Tony braces; he’s not that high up, but it’s still a shock when he hits the ground.  The suit’s interior bracings hold and he’ll be sore tomorrow, but that’s not the worst of it: his system’s completely fried.  And his backup systems and the armor’s hibernating nanobots, built for exactly this purpose to repair fuses on the go, take almost five minutes to get even partially back online; Beck will be gone by then.
Later, when Morgan’s in bed and #FuckOffWillYou is trending on Twitter, Steve texts him,
"Okay," Steve says, and the next day they sleep til noon and order in Chinese food and Tony misses his meeting by quite a bit, and neither of them mentions it.
“I want to go flying,” Morgan says.
And then he climbed into the quantum ship and waited.
Tony opens his mouth, then closes it.  “How did you - ”
“Well, I wish we could answer that, but we can’t,” Steve says.  “But he existed, and now he’s dead, and the whole universe is a better place for it.”
“I mean, I knew we were
“I’m not here because you just got divorced.”
“It’s a date,” Tony says, and winks.
“No,” Tony said, snatching a Princess Leia Funko Pop out of Thor’s hand and putting it back on the shelf.  “You sneak out, you don’t get any toys.”
“All right, who wants to hear Baby Got Back?” Clint yelled.  “Just kidding, one vote is enough, let’s do this!”

“So no pressure,” Bucky said darkly.
“Apparently not
,” Steve snaps, and he reaches out like he’s going to grab Tony, or maybe hit him, but he stops himself just in time, and Tony wishes he knows which way that would’ve gone.  “What the hell were you
“A fact I regret daily, Stark.”
“It’s your cross to bear.  Wow, your cock looks amazing,” Steve said, and wrapped his mouth around it.
“Dinner!” Tony called out, and tensed.
“What’s a cell?” Thor said, and they all
“I’m not - ”
Tony’s a smart guy, and he’s pretty sure he knows how the story ends.
“Offense fully taken,” Clint said.  “Okay, so I called ahead and made sure rooms were made up for everybody, if you need anything this is Edgar - hey Edgar, these are my friends, you know who they are - Edgar’s the butler - ”
There aren't good days anymore but this is a particularly bad one, and at the end of the fight one of the kids is dead and a couple more are hurt.  The NYPD comes in to clean the scene up and Steve watches unflinchingly as they march the kids that can still walk into the back of a van and take the body away.
Bruce looked up at Tony with a bite of his lunch halfway to his mouth.  “What?”
“I’ll butt out now.”
“But it makes sense, too.  There aren’t a lot of people who know it’s like.  Being - being one of you.”
The first set of gunshots aren’t a surprise.
“We’d already spent the rest on gumballs,” Thor said proudly.
into a double entendre?” Tony said.
“You ever think about joining up?” Stark says, his eyes boring into hers.
“But if you’re here he’s going to drag you into it,” Steve says.
A series of hard-to-catch expressions cross Banner's face: terror, relief, gratitude, discomfort.  "Oh.  That's - good.  Thank you, I - "
“No,” Steve said quickly.
“Yes,” Steve whispered, the pressure building.  “Yes, I - ”
“Not that I’m aware,” Steve said.
“You sent Hogan,” Steve says.  “I assumed he’d wait outside my door until I gave in.”
He goes directly to the landing pad, plugs in the coordinates and doesn’t look up from his holopad during takeoff.  Pepper texts him twice while he’s over the Atlantic, and he forgets to respond.
“From who?” Steve said, finally looking up.
“So you want to live together too?”
“Oh, not much,” Steve said.  If Tony had ever forgotten that the man was once a performer himself, he couldn’t miss it now; Steve had his audience’s rapt attention.  The room was silent, every boy and girl leaning forward eagerly to hear what Captain America himself would ask for.  “Just for all my friends here in New York to have a safe and happy holiday season.”
“Does that mean Cap is still my boss?”
.  Tony can do things with technology that Steve can’t even pronounce.
“And considering we might be facing certain doom later today,” Steve said, dishing eggs out onto a plate, “and, you know, I try really hard these days not to go to my death leaving things unsaid, lesson learned, right?”
“One of them,” Barton says, rolling his eyes.  “Probably bought it from Rockefeller.”
“I didn’t think so.”
"Not one I'm interested in getting into," Stark says.  He takes a swig of whiskey.  "We didn't make such a bad team here.  Whaddya think, Romanov, want to get all of us on the payroll?"
“Sure is,” Beck says.  “Why try to deny it?  You and the rest of the Avengers talked all about it.  You planned the whole thing.  We have it on
Banner shifts from one foot to the other.
Pepper reaches out, puts her hand on his.  “We have to move forward, Tony.  I know you feel guilty it happened in the first place, but if you feel guilty about the way you chose to fix it, too, you’ll never move past it, you’ll never - ”
"Maybe somebody's over there using your hot tub right now."
“I’m not capable of conspiracy,” JARVIS reminded him, “and, technically, you never revoked their power to ask me not to inform you of something, a right granted to all permanent residents of the Tower.”
rules,” Steve says.  “You wanted the rules too, you said - ”
“Got any better plans, oh fearless leader?” Tony said.  “Don’t make us wait, I’m on pins and needles.”
“Well, that’s a pipe dream,” Tony said.  “For one thing, he’d need a full-body suit of armor or he’d turn to jelly, and for another I’d literally never let anyone go faster than me, hello, have you met me?”
,” Tony said, jumping back.  “You can
Tony spun toward the weapons cache, where Natasha was inventorying ammo.  “I’m sorry,
"Too long," Killian says.  "You know who owns the establishment you're patronizing?"
“How’d you think I’d react?” Tony asked, sounding genuinely curious.
Tony dozes off during official business - something about an industrial magnate in Argentina who’s making noise about setting up his own ambassadorship in space, sounds like a bad idea, hopefully somebody’s taking care of that - and he doesn’t jerk awake until his elbow slides right off his knee.  “I’m awake,” he blurts out.
Steve glances at Stark, who has a funny look on his face.  "Aldrich.  It's been a while."
A man appears at the end of the hall as if by magic.  “Yes, sir?”
Tony’s eyes widened - until he realized Steve was holding back a smirk.  “That was a lie, wasn’t it.”
“Nobody,” Steve said.  “Hope, how’s it looking?”
“I asked him once, he said no,” Tony says.  “But I think he’ll change his mind.  Maybe you could pitch it to him, kids always love you, what kid can say no to Captain America?”
A whole bed is a luxury; Steve’s made do in bathrooms and on blankets on the ground, bachelor studios with single beds pressed against the wall, moving slowly and carefully so the squeaking doesn’t raise any eyebrows the next morning at breakfast.  Steve can hear the party through the open doors but it’s distant now, just the buzz of voices and mosquitoes in the stuffy summertime air.  Stark’s hand works steadily between them, sliding them together roughly, and the heat of him makes Steve bite his lip.
Tony wasn’t surprised.  For one thing, everyone knew that Steve was usually up with the chickens (proverbially speaking; he was from Brooklyn) and it was approaching 10 am.  And for another thing, Tony was used to his one night stands disappearing in the morning.
“Because the way it looks to me,” Pierce interrupts, “is that you’re trying to punch a little higher than your weight class.  That you’re angling for a promotion.”
At least, Tony’s
“Oh.”  Peggy looked slightly perplexed.  “I didn’t realize you wanted one.”
“The video looks,” Tony says, and purses his lips.  “Ugly.”
that you - Captain America! - are not just allowing but
“Yeah, but I got lucky,” Tony said.  “Are you going to kiss me again?”
“Little to the left, maybe,” Tony said.  “I took one of these apart when I was a kid, you know.  I made the parts into an semi-automatic spitball gun.”
“Well, if you change your mind, I’m here.  Not all the time, or anything.  Nothing creepy.  Just - I’m here.  And considering I can’t tell anyone…”
The smoke is getting thinner, and Steve can see that they’re in trouble.  Their group is all strong fighters, but Killian and Pierce have more men, and while they’re not using their guns yet for fear of striking their bosses in the smoky room, Steve knows they don’t have long until the goons decide it’s worth the risk.
“Well, I love what you’ve done with the place,” Steve says.
gonna have some?” Tony grumbled.
“Forget it,” Steve says, and he presses his drink into Tony’s hands and walks away.
“I shouldn’t have gotten so drunk.”
too late for me to save face on this one,” Steve said, flopping back on the bed.  “I only told you how much I wanted it about a million times.”
“To the Black Widow,” Banner says.
.  “We may have a situation in Mexico.  A small town was destroyed by a cyclone last week - only a few casualties, but destruction on a mass scale.  Problem is, I haven’t seen cyclones with faces before.”
“Nothing, huh?” Tony said.  “What’s that smell, then?”
“CD’s?” Tony scoffed.  “What year are you from, 2002?”
"That thing's more dangerous than it's worth," Steve snaps.  "You could - "
“Jesus,” Tony said.  “Were you hiding there listening?”
“Peg,” Steve said, and took a deep breath.  “I just couldn’t sleep, all right?  Go back to bed, I’ll be there in a minute.”
When he opened his eyes, Tony was gone.
It started out with little snatches of Tony's voice. He'd hear him, sometimes, while he was working in the basement with the bandsaw, or digging up the yard for Peggy's roses.  “Ugh,” the figment of his imagination would say, “honestly, I know they’re in style now, but I’m still
.  He’s sure he’ll recognize it eventually.
“This,” Banner says quietly, “was a very bad idea.”
Bruce has an idea.
, Tony said once, and Steve just ignored him.
“There’s no figuring it out,” Bucky says, his voice hollow.  “This is
“Oh, come on,” Clint said.  He pulled on a Slipknot beanie and grinned.  “This stuff is awesome.  And didn’t you say this was a charity shopping trip?”
“They’re not supposed to,” Bruce said.  “Do they drink where you’re from?”
Tony rounded on Steve.  “You knew?”
“You’re insane, you know that?”
“That hurt,” Steve said.  “Also I heard you and Jane having sex a few weeks ago.”
It should surprise absolutely no one that this was
“Oh, sweet!” Clint said.  “Nevermind then.”
“Definitely,” Steve says.
“Captain Rogers doesn’t have any comment for the press at this time,” Wilson says, sounding tired.
“Okay, but in this metaphor, who do I go to if the copier breaks?”
“Thought maybe I’d drop by and wait out the storm.”
“I’m good,” Steve said easily.  “Are
He considered staying in bed until his headache went away or until the heat death of the universe, whichever came first, but was eventually lulled downstairs by the memory of Gatorade in the fridge and the scent of bacon in the air.  He assumed he’d find Edgar in the kitchen, so he was mid yawn when he walked in and found a very, ah,
, but the timing’s a little convenient, don’t you think?”
“Look at what?” Tony said.
readings Fury could give us were electrical.  I thought at first that it must hold itself together through some kind of electrical charge, maybe depolarization of its own atoms, but you know what else would cause these kinds of readings?”
“I’m not really a stuffing person,” Tony said with a shrug.  “Gotta keep it tight, the suit doesn’t exactly have an elastic waistband.”
do is take all the data that exists pretty much everywhere (yes, even you, people who shared that Facebook post about not allowing Facebook to have your data) and spit out scenarios and probabilities.  It doesn’t analyze them, doesn’t lay out any conjectures or think for itself, which is fine, because Tony is perfectly capable of doing all the thinking for it.

“Nothing, honey,” Pepper says, gazing out the window.  “Just tired of all the cameras.  Glad to be going home.”
Rogers laughs.  “I’m off the clock, ma’am.”
“What do you mean?”
“That’s it.”
“No way to know,” Tony said.  “You making dinner?”
"Tell me about it," Steve says, accepting his whiskey with a nod.
“Where’d they go?” Steve asked, flopping down next to Tony.

Peter somehow maintains his secret identity long enough to get into Columbia (which is fine with Tony; he didn’t have his heart set on MIT for the kid or anything).  Tony throws him a graduation party at the Tower and invites the team and Aunt May and Peter’s best friend Ned, who stands between Steve and Bruce looking like he’s died and gone to heaven and it’s even better than he expected.  Happy shows up with one of those big head posters, and when Pepper and Morgan leave early so Morgan can sleep in her own bed, Peter gives Morgan a goodbye high five that Tony quietly asks Friday to save to the permanent drive.
The man below Steve stops struggling and falls unconscious, and Steve releases him immediately.  “You’re gonna get us killed,” he mutters, following Stark back toward the stairwell.
“Where’s Stark?” Steve says.  “We could use another one of those smoke grenades right about now.”
Peter scoots forward on his stool.  “I have time.”
“Banner’s a genius,” Stark proclaims.  “I’ve been working on a compound for my new power source - I’m gonna run an entire floor of my building off it, it’s gonna change the energy game - and I’ve spent three weeks feeding different juice into the capacitor with no luck.  Banner took one look at it, and bam.  Solved it.”

Tony wonders when Peter got so old and mature and
“Boss,” Friday says, “you should know - ”
Tony pulls a bottle of bourbon out from behind the bar - he must have brought it from home, considering almost every bottle in the place shattered when his bomb went off - and pours a healthy glass.  “Well, hey, if it’s gonna be a bar again, I’m just saying, the alley’s fine and all but this could be a classy establishment - ”
"That thing you've got," Banner says, nodding at Stark's arm as he tightens Steve's bandage.  "What is it?"
The man freezes and steps back quickly, further into the shadows.  “Steve?”
“We have agents posted at every exit,” Coulson said.  “They were never alone.”
Stark squeezes once more, and then steps back and nods.  "See you around, Cap."
“See you in the morning?” Tony said, shoving his hands in his pockets and walking backwards down the hall.
“A lifetime,” Tony agrees, pressing a kiss to her cheek.  They’d slept together a few times, way
“So when we say truth serum,” Bruce said, “are we being talking about a chemical cocktail that lowers inhibitions, or - ”
“Anything interesting?  Not the porn, I don’t need to know about what kind of porn they liked as teenagers, that would be so weird - ”
“I’m not part of the bureau,” Coulson says.  “We’re called the Strategic Science Reserve.  We’re an… independent organization.”
“Hey, we all have childhood heroes,” Tony said.  “I’m just one of the few who was unlucky enough to meet mine.”
“You’re okay with it?” Tony asked cautiously.  “As the team leader, I mean?”
He blinks a couple of times and looks down at the code he’s working on.  One of the (very few) positives from the post-Snap period was the continued shift away from fossil fuels, but it turns out that the battery breakthrough Tony had in ‘21 needs a few touch-ups, and if he can just get the last transistor right he can send it to QA and -
“And in that one,” Tony says, “what went differently?”
"No, not really."  Steve shifts in his seat.  "It’s - I had a friend who went missing during the war."
“Because I convinced you,” Tony says.
, I’m -
“That’s his way of saying thanks,” Natasha said, squeezing Steve’s shoulder as she followed him.
, Steve thinks, backing out of the room and slamming the door.  He doesn’t care if the room he just left is literally full, floor to ceiling, with nothing but towels: he has no intention of opening that door again.  He takes a moment to wonder if he’ll ever be able to look Miss Romanov in the eye again, then shakes his head and moves on down the hall.
“Only Vanko,” Banner says.  “But if Blonsky sent him, that means they’re interested.  We’re lucky they didn’t notice your armband, Stark; Vanko’s got a quick trigger finger and he doesn’t mind collateral damage.”
“This seat taken?”
“I’m not holding interviews with rabble-rousing bigoted assholes, actually.”
“I,” Tony said, and stopped.  “I haven’t thought about it, really.”
“Well, it’s not hard to miss a voice like mine.”
They all look around, assessing.  “Don’t worry, nobody’s bleeding on your upholstery,” Clint says.
And it was at that exact moment that they both noticed the complete and utter silence that had fallen over the field, a silence that was broken only when Scott Lang yelled, “Come on, guys, there’s no kissing in baseball!”
Ugh, did he really just think the words
“Except for the part where you know the outcome.”
"Hang on a second - " Stark says, but Steve's already gone.
“That’ll be the day,” Steve says, and pulls Tony down for a kiss.
about making out at the mound.”
“I’m sorry, am I missing something?” Tony said.
.  I mean, sixteen
“You realize if I changed any of those things, I’d be creating a spin-off universe, right?”
Here’s the other thing: even at the best of times, “stocking the kitchen” had never been high on the list of priorities for anyone currently living on the base, which meant that the ingredients Steve had to work with were a bit… haphazard.  Among the detritus he scraped up were six half-empty bags of rice, twelve avocados careening toward overripe, most of what appeared to be a cornish hen, and absolutely no milk.
“Pretend that I’m having that conversation with you,” Steve said, miserably.  “I don’t want to do that.  Not tonight.”
“Pizza rolls do sound pretty good,” Steve said, paddling in Tony’s general direction.  “Do you think Clint has any?”
“Steve
“He couldn’t be drunk!” Bruce said.  “The other guy.  His metabolism is like - it’s a hundred times - it’s
“In a normal way,” Steve said, raising his eyebrows.
“What’s the occasion?”
Natasha shoved the plate in the microwave and picked up her wine glass.  “Or sell mini arc reactors at Best Buy.”
"What are you sitting out in the cold for?" Tony says.
outside the strike zone.  “Ball!” Coulson called from behind Tony.
“I don’t know,” Tony said.  “Nothing, really.  But you can talk to me, if you want.  About - anything, really.  It’s not like I can tell anybody.”
“The team is,” Tony says, and pauses.  “The team is the team.  We’re not moving back, okay?”
“I think it’s very festive,” Steve said defensively.  “Pass the tape?”
Aw, screw it.  “Well.  A couple months ago, you know how you asked, about Cap?  And me?  Well, you weren’t, uh.  Totally wrong.”
“Um,” Tony said.  “Okay.  Pizza, then?”
Coulson looks around blandly.  “I can see that,” he says.  “I’m not here for a drink.  I’m here to talk about your future.”
Steve snorts.  “I can make it just fine on my own.  So I’m dismissed now, huh?”
So there’s nothing
“I hope you will,” Steve calls, and with a grind, the warehouse door slides shut again.
He grinned.
“No, I mean… here.  In the tower.  With all of you.”
“I mean,
“You really think you’re the only person in the whole galaxy smart enough to invent time travel, Stark?” Nebula says when he shares this perspective.
Thanksgiving?”
“There’s gonna be a party tomorrow night out on Long Island.  Big house on the water, lots of obnoxious rich people.  Tons of booze.  Enough to get even you drunk.”
“We’re
“Cap!” Morgan calls when Steve steps out of the elevator.  “I drew a tiger at school the other day, do you want to see?”
“I don’t know.”  Steve cracked an eye open.  Tony was looking at him pensively.  “What?”
“Fascinating,” Stark says.  “Thanks, Pep - hey, why did the music stop?  Did someone stop the music?”
“So what
“Excuse me, sir,” JARVIS said.  “I believe you should know that two members of the team are currently alone.”
Tony snorts.  “Nice?  Nice would have been the bottle of wine I have on hold for us at Le Bernardin.”
“Thanks for the rescue,” Natasha murmurs, close to his ear.
“Cap’s everybody’s boss,” Peter says.
“When I came back here, I thought I’d be setting things right,” he said finally.  “Picking up where I left off, taking it all back.  And in some ways I did, but - it turned out there was a whole other set of ‘all’ that I left behind.  No matter where I am, there’ll always be something I can’t have.”
Steve’s eyes flew open.
“Wait,” Steve gasps, yanking himself back.  “Hang on - ”
Steve just turns on his heel jogs up the stairs, and even though it's as hot as New York City ever gets in the middle of the night, Steve thinks, it's a lot less heated than it was in that dingy stairwell under the firebrand gaze of Tony Stark.
Steve closed his eyes, willed himself back to sleep.
She smiles against his lapel. "As much as anywhere, I suppose."
Steve pulled back and grinned sheepishly.  “I don’t care if we win or lose either.”
“Everything’s about money in the end,” Stark says.  “How about it, Aldrich?  Make it 25 g’s and 15 percent.”
Everyone shifts in their seats.
“Is that a challenge?” Tony asked, challengingly.
“Thanks, doll,” Tony says, and hits the button that opens the hatch.
45 minutes ago.
“Honestly?  Yes,” Stark says.  “That was a little bit of a letdown.  I was expecting my first time arranging a bribe to really get the blood flowing.”
Tony hangs up the phone before Happy can pick up.  Well, shit.  Tony doesn’t believe in signs, but it’s hard to ignore an
“No,” Steve said.
Tony's standing in front of the TV, still wearing his sunglasses.  "What do you - "
“Yeah, exactly, your silence said it all, Cap, I get it, it’s not me it’s you, or hey, maybe it’s me, that’s totally reasonable too - ”
"I was enjoying the show," Clint responds. He works her wrists around until he's got her pinned one-handed--with the other, he slides a blindfold over her eyes. She stands stock-still. Clint snugs the bandana in place; then, his hand drops to graze over her rump, gathering up a handful of the ivory silk slip she's wearing. "You wearing anything under this?" he asks.
“That’s a bald-faced lie and you know it.”
“I don’t smell anything,” Bruce said.  “Clint?”
“I don’t know,” Steve says.  “I don’t know how it works - ”
"You know what it does to me when you flirt."
"Thought you said you got out of weapons in '16," Steve says.
“They’re saying it might make the Billboard Hot 100 by Christmas Eve,” Steve said, as if he had nothing to do with it at all.
Steve had a feeling that if Sam were here, he probably wouldn’t be encouraging Steve to
“Well,
"You know what's funny?  I believe you," the man says.  "You look like you're here because you
It didn’t surprise Tony, because he was old as fuck and knew better, but he was already drunk enough to forget that lesson and anyway it was worth a shot.  A big shot, first of the scotch he kept behind the spare soldering irons, and then, once Clint’s yelling over the comm systems became so loud they couldn’t avoid it, with a bottle of wine that Clint opened because it was “a good year” and it “went great with yams”.  Which,
“And I really shouldn’t be talking to a figment of my imagination,” Steve said.  “Sam would be reading me the riot act.  I can hear him now.
, which is weird because he’s pretty sure it’s expensive as hell, “should we go flying?  I feel like we should go flying.”
Tony set a pace that was brutal but not punishing, his dick sliding in and out of Steve’s mouth with a filthy, wet sound.  It was so hot, knowing that Steve could, at literally any moment, push Tony away, knock him down and stop him from fucking Steve’s perfect mouth, with no more effort than it would take to tie his shoe - but instead he was swallowing around his cock, letting Tony hit the back of his throat and then some, his pupils blown wide and spit dripping down his chin.

They walk through the cement corridors of the underground level of the base and climb the stairs that take them directly out to the landing pad.  "Where are we - "

“I’m sure you don’t,” Pierce says smoothly.  “That’s why I’m going to make sure you get an idea, and fast.”  He leans closer to Steve and smiles.  “You may think you’re untouchable because of what the Army did to you, boy, but nobody’s untouchable.  You’re not untouchable, and neither are your friends.  And when I find them - well, you better hope I don’t, let’s just put it that way.”  He pats Steve on the knee and then leans forward.  “Driver?  Just here, if you don’t mind.”
Tony looked up.  Busted.
Steve shrugged, grabbed the last french fry and took his time eating it.  Tony drummed his fingers on the formica table.  A waitress bustled by and didn’t even look at Steve.
Steve set his jaw and frowned, and the look was so
“My lips are sealed,” Tony said, biting back a smile.
Thor brightened, and Steve looked away; he’d nearly forgotten how delighted Thor used to look at everything.  “A feast before battle!  So you admit it’s a crucial component of any fight?”
And what Dopey has done
“What’s that, son?”
Barnes snorts.  “You can say that again.”
“Really big,” Tony said, because now that the dick was out of the bag, as it were, he wanted to make sure Bruce knew he should be proud of himself.  “We’re talking enormous.  I have measurements, actually.  If you’re interested.”
“Don’t move,” Sitwell says under his breath as a car pulls up smoothly beside them.  Steve can see his hand resting lightly over his holster.
“And would it bring you comfort to know what it was?”
think we’re - ”
“Fireworks, then,” Tony said.  “I can probably whip up something that looks like the shield in the next two hours - I could have used a little more time, but what’s a little pyrotechnics between friends - ”
“Could be dangerous,” Steve says quietly.
Tony settled himself on the floor and leaned against the sofa.  “You’re not that good at hiding things, you know.  You

Tony grabs a bottle from behind the bar and dumps what’s left of it into his glass.  “I’ll have you know that my armband’s targeting his improved significantly over the past several weeks.  I had a clean hit tonight, you can’t deny that.”
“Yeah, Tony?”

“With all due respect, that’s not it at all, sir,” Steve says.  “The agents on the Killian and Blonsky cases do good work, and I wanted to see what I could learn from their methods of - ”
“I’m sorry,
Pierce smiles.  “Now, come out from behind that bar, won’t you, doll?   My good friend Mr. Killian will be taking over your joint starting tomorrow, and he’d prefer to to keep the clean-up to a minimum.”

“You jumped out of a plane to get away from him, and then he jumped out after you,” Peter says, raising his eyebrows.  “It wasn’t, like, the most casual thing ever.”
"Oh, I don't care about the password," the bartender dismisses, his heavy Scandinavian accent not masking his amusement.  "I'm just here to make sure everyone has a good time.  The Hawk's the one who steps in when someone's having a
"Who sent - what?" Steve says.  "Nobody sent me.  I'm here on my own."
Next to him, Tony drummed his fingers on the console.  “Everything looks good.  The coordinates are right.  I should have another ten minutes in this location, at least.  Oh, and I’m still against this idea, for the record.”
“What the hell?” Vanko says, looking up at the ceiling.
There was no answer.
“To not have gotten involved with us in the first place?”
“Looking for this?” Tony steps up behind him, holding the Bic steady at Steve’s shoulder, and Steve twists slightly to cup his hand around the flame and suck.
“Well, it’s worth a shot,” Tony said, and went for it.
Nicola takes a sip of champagne.  “Seems like you’ve seen your own share of suck.”
“Stop,” Steve snapped.  “I know I fucked up.  I know this isn’t working.  I know it, I think it

“Definitely less entertaining than this,” Nat said.

“Ground level?” Steve says as Nicola steps inside, and the doors slide shut on them both.
Tony shifted until he could hold Steve’s gaze.  “So it, uh, maybe wasn’t
He looked around the table.  Bruce looked like he wanted to crawl under the table on Tony’s behalf.  Thor looked perplexed.  Natasha was clearly trying not to laugh.  Clint’s mouth was hanging open, revealing a disgusting mix of cranberry sauce and green bean casserole and, sidenote, ew, Clint, why

“Sounds like Wilson,” Tony agreed.  “And therapy

"So it seems like you're really not here on the job," Romanov says, looking Steve up and down.  "Killian would have been a huge catch for the boys in blue, and you let him walk right out of here."
“I’m probably teaching you all to fight,” Thor said smugly.  “Your weaponry on this planet is extremely basic.  You’re in desperate need of my expertise.”
“Sounds delicious.”
“If you want to warm up, there’s a hot tub too, jets are behind the towel stand,” Clint said.  “Or you could, you know, find a
“Agent Rogers, can I trust that we understand each other?” Pierce says.
“What do you have behind your back, Clint?” Tony said.
“You know what you were in Wakanda?  Weak.  You were too weak to do what needed to be done.  And - honestly, Bruce, I don't see how you can forgive yourself for that.  You don't deserve any forgiveness.  Not your own, and not ours, and not all the people who died because of you.”
He doesn’t sound
“No way.”
“You got it,” Friday says.
The children moved out of the way, watching excitedly as Tony guided Steve up to the front of the line.
“I gotta warn you,” the man calls out, “he’s very persistent.  In fact he told me to follow you until you got in.”
“Interesting,” Pierce says.  “Because the records department let me know this morning that you recently took out
“Don’t stop,” Tony said.  “Imagine you can feel me behind you, and it’s my hand wrapped around you, and all I can think about is you.  That’s all there is, just my hand around your cock, and I’m pressing into you from behind, you can tell how bad I want you, I want you, Steve, god, I want you - ”
“Didn’t think so,” Tony said.  “You sure you can handle getting that thing set up, buddy?”
Steve groans, half with frustration and half desire, and wrenches himself away.  “
And then there was Clint.  Somewhere between joining the circus and becoming SHIELD’s best medieval weapon, Clint had learned to Cook with a capital C.  Clint had Opinions on grass-fed vs. corn-fed beef.  Clint knew the difference between broiling and baking, and openly disdained of anyone who didn’t.  Clint

Clint’s eyes widened.  “For real?”
“Well, that’s much better,” Bruce said.
rules, and I say no boys in your room with the door closed, do you understand me?”
Barnes seems to consider it, but opens the door wider and lets him in.  He crosses his arms over his chest, and Tony can tell he doesn’t want to move from where he stands now, between Tony and Steve.  “Whatever you did, I sure hope you can fix it.”
Fury arches an eyebrow.  “Is this how you conduct team meetings these days, Captain?  Start off with baked goods?”
“Nothing,” Steve said, which was a lie.  He lifted the lid from the nearest jar and grabbed a handful of cookies.
“He’s getting antsy now that the world doesn’t need saving,” Rhodey says, rolling his eyes.
Steve looks at him sharply, like he thinks Tony’s giving him a hard time, and Tony watches him carefully until Steve relaxes.  “No.  No, not really.”
Natasha lifts a shoulder delicately.  “What’s life without a little risk?”
“I think I oughta,” Agent Sitwell says.  “You want to get a cup of coffee first?  There’s a spot I like just around the corner.”
“Nobody’s saying another word,” Tony says.  “Jameson, do I need to remove you, or are you removing yourself?”
“That opinion’s about twenty minutes too late to matter,” Stark says, pulling his hat lower over his eyes.
“Not too bad at the afterparty either, if I do say so myself,” Tony says, his hand sliding into Steve’s slacks.
“And every night,” Steve says.
think I’d be on their side - ”
“Nope,” Tony said while 90 pounds of future supersoldier windmilled in Clint’s general direction.  “He could crush you like a bug if he wanted to.  Luckily for you, Clint doesn’t hit people when he’s not getting paid for it.”
“I know you’ll catch them, but - ”
Clint's silent behind her - he always is; it's one of his myriad skills - and she's quiet too as she climbs toward her apartment.  The noise of the bar fades quickly as she climbs, lost in the rumbling of automobiles and the yowl of cats, and she’s about to knock on his door when it opens right in front of her.
“I think you need to be able to open a PDF to get a regular 9-5 these days,” Tony said, peering into the wine fridge.  “Do we want a cab or a pinot?”
“They all figured out how to do it?”
standing against the wall.  “Nothing much?  It looks like - like some sort of clockwork man.  Or like some sort of… armor.”
," he says, and Tony smirks and slides inside.  Steve shudders, oversensitive and dripping, and Tony fucks him so hard that he can feel the carpet leaving red-hot burns against his back.
“Well, there’s no accounting for taste.”
“Tony, because of your decision to go in alone, Beck got away.  And it could have been even worse.”
.  “You know, most people don’t know this, but I spent some time at the front.”
“I can’t argue with that.  I don’t know many six year olds, but I can tell she’s pretty special.”
“And you just went and undid all of that work,” Tony says.  “You know, if I didn’t know better - ”
“Nope,” Tony says.  “We don’t have enough living team members to reach quorum.”
Tony’s HUD goes dark, so it takes him a second to realize he’s falling.
"You've been bad today."
Banner and Stark exchange a look.  “Nothing good,” Banner says.
why you always do the dishes by hand,” Clint said.
“Smells good,” Bruce said.  “Is there enough for everybody?”
“ - not fair, that’s cheating,” Steve was saying when he emerged, and Tony was so busy thinking about force and angle of attack that he didn’t realize anyone else was around until Clint’s voice rang out, clear as a bell, “So this all seems normal.”

“So I guess this means you
“Everything okay with Pepper?”
“Oh,” Scott said, “are we not good enough friends for FaceTime?”
It’s a lie, of course, and over the next couple of months Tony does pretty much nothing but prove it.
“Well, we can’t,” Tony says.  “Clearly.”
“Don’t be a snob,” Steve said.  “This is state of the art technology in 1954.  I spent a month’s salary on this thing.”
“Really?” Steve says.
In the dim lights from the warehouse they’re standing on top of, Steve’s jaw works; he’s holding himself stock still in a way most people can’t.  Tony knows him well enough to know that he only does that when he’s trying to hide something, trying to conceal what he’s feeling.  It’s a move Tony’s familiar with, but he’s not used to seeing it used against him anymore.
, since when had Clint become a sommelier and since when did
And to absolutely no one’s surprise, it didn’t end there.
"Rogers?" Thor says, pulling out a match and striking it on the bar.  His arms gleam with sweat and ropy muscles; Natasha allows herself a very blatant moment of appreciation.  "We get plenty of that sort in here, the lawman turning his nose up at the law, but he seems..."
Stark barks a laugh.  “It was supposed to be a quick visit, just to see some of my weapons in action.  Artillery, machine guns, a couple of tanks I’d modified, the basics.  Our transport exploded an hour after I arrived.  Spent three weeks under heavy fire.”
“And now I like you a normal amount.  In a normal way.  So, congrats on that.”
“Just a long weekend away,” Tony interrupted loudly.
“Boss, you have an incoming call from - ”
The trip uptown’s breathtakingly fast in the Chrysler, and Steve barely has time to wonder what Stark wants with him before Stark Tower appears at the end of the block, sticking up out of the rest of Midtown like a sore thumb.  Hogan drives straight into an underground driveway and pulls in next to a nearly identical black Chrysler.
“Uh, yeah, I’m aware, my secretary runs my entire business,” Tony says, rolling his eyes.  “I’m talking about Rogers here failing to notice that his own secretary wasn’t actually working for his organization.  You’re a helluva cop, Rogers.”
"Yeah. Fun. You heard of it?"
But really, it’s fine.  Tony can fly, after all. He can duck out for a few hours a couple times a week, make sure the team’s settling into the tower, check in on Peter’s suits, shoot the shit with Bruce in the lab.  Pepper won’t even notice he’s gone.
know Steve, so he knows it isn’t actually casual at all.
“Wait, what’d you say?” Scott says.  “Man, I hate not being able to see everybody, how do I get one of those holo-thingies installed in my house, do I have to call Comcast for that or what?”
“You think he needs to be?” Natasha glances at the four-door Dodge humming at the sidewalk.  “He’ll kill the man with his bare hands.”
“Just let him cool off,” Tony said.
“A girl after my own heart,” Pierce says.  “It’s too bad, really.  You could’ve been a real asset to what we’re doing here.”  He sighs deeply, like he’s personally disappointed that she isn’t interested in being a yes man for the mob.  “But then again, there’s a silver lining to every dark cloud, isn’t there?  You and your friends will make such a good example for all the other bootleggers who aren’t interested in playing nice.”
He wants more than a call, actually.  He wants Steve to be here right now.  Even though there’s nothing Steve could do, really, except just stand next to him, wrap an arm around him, maybe, if things are like that with them, not that Tony’s entirely sure they are. He wants it so bad, and that makes him angry, makes him
“You’re on time,” Steve said.
“Are you envisioning some big love story with a happily ever after at the end?  Because I have this funny feeling that that’s not how this story goes.  I’m not that kind of guy, and somehow I don’t think you are either.  Or at least you haven’t been so far.”
And the worst part of it all is that he knows he should feel worse about it than he does.
.  “Sorry, you need me to turn around?”
“That would
“Yeah, I’m not interested in your commentary.”
his eyes ask, and she shakes her head.
“Doesn’t matter,” Steve said.  “If I can get you out - ”
“Hello?” Barnes’s voice comes through the intercom.
“Til then,” Steve says, and shuts the door behind him.
“Nobody’s judging,” says Happy, the big lying liar.
“Isn’t that what I’m doing right now?” Steve said.
“Now don’t get too excited, but I’ve got a tip for you,” Tony Stark says in his ear.
“I could eat some nachos,” Bruce mused.
“Calm down,” Natasha said, yanking open the door.
it, actually, but it’s one of the coolest things I’ve ever done.  And scariest.  And most fun.  And wow, okay, I’m doing that thing parents do where they talk about their kids nonstop, I used to hate that, I think I fired somebody for that once, actually.”
“Most of them look like Blonsky’s scientists have had their way with them,” Thor says.  “It may not be so easy.”
"Stark?" Steve says.  "What, you mean like that big ugly building down on - "
he was going to have to -
“Uh, and more importantly, how are you not dead?” Tony said.
But Tony doesn’t always want things for very long, and when he does, he tends to break them.  This feeling, the tightness in his chest and the way his skin feels like it’s aching, it’s
“I was just thinking,” Tony says. “I guess it was a date after all.”
Tony’s fault.  Tony liked him calm.  Tony liked him… happy.
“We weren’t here for theatrics,” Steve says.  “Do you think they had enough time to - ”
“Well why didn’t you say so?” Tony said, grabbing a handful of Steve’s hair between his fingers and giving it a solid tug.  “Anything else you want to tell me, soldier?”
something about any of it?” Tony said, and he sounded angry, almost furious.  “All the stupid mistakes, the fighting, the suffering?  How can you say that?  Do you just not care?”
From inside the room, Thor, who was laying on her bed - fully clothed, thank god - waved cheerily.  “Greetings.”
thinking that, after all.  “I spend most of my time making sure the business stays up and running.  Mr. Stark’s usually too busy inventing things or getting into trouble to worry about bookkeeping and production lines.”
Because why the fuck not. It’s private, and it’s even emptier than the rest of the world, thanks to a series of oil refinery fires that have darkened the horizon and emptied out the estuary and totally fucked the local micro-economy of oyster bars. It’s difficult to get to these days from the nearest commercial airport, requiring a drive of over four hours of stop-and-go traffic through ghost towns. Or a QuinJet.
“So do you know how long we’re going to be like this?” Bruce asked, pushing his too-large glasses up his nose.
“Tony?” Bruce said, sounding shocked.
“Can I stop you?” Steve said wearily.
“I mean, relationships are hard,” Peter says.  “Things don’t work out sometimes.  The beautiful part is enjoying it while it lasts.”
“I just hope it’s good,” Steve said.
“I thought you said this wasn’t a vacation,” Tony said, leaning against the pillar next to him.  “Everybody’ll sleep off their hangovers tomorrow and then we’ll get back to business.  Plus, you guys weren’t going to get anything done today, not after - well, you know.”
“Okay, okay,” Tony said.  “You don’t want to talk about it, I get it.  So what
“She likes him too, clearly.”  From upstairs, they hear Morgan giggle.  Pepper turns to Tony.  “So, is this a thing?  You and Steve?”
you do that, anyway?" Steve says.
“Oh, god,” Tony said.  “A call to assemble?
,” Tony said, dropping his face into his hands.
“You mean like Apalachicola, Florida?” Steve says wryly.
you want to do?”
“He left to go try to see the future or something,” Natasha said, taking a sip of pinot grigio.
Tony ignored him, and the pitch went wide left again, and came in at just 120 MPH, which by Steve’s standards was basically standing still.
“But that’s sweet of you to say.
Steve leaned forward and kissed Tony, his tongue tracing the seam of Tony’s lips and then sliding inside as if to try to taste himself, which was - yeah, Tony was going to have to stop thinking
“Tony,” he says, leaning down to try to see through the eye holes of the clockwork man, but it’s dark inside.  “Tony!  Can you hear me?”
From behind the kitchen counter, Steve stares at him impassively.  Tough crowd.  “What’s going on?”
, including known enemies of the United States. For all you know, you brought back members of HYDRA.”  Jameson leans back in his seat.  “But then again, it’s well known that you count HYDRA operatives among your closest friends.”
“Uh, were you two - you know - were you - ”
“What about Vietnam?  The Challenger explosion?  The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles reboot?”
on the 92” flatscreen with an innocently thrilled expression that Tony had never seen before -
Tony would have expected dinner to be strained, and it probably would have been enormously so, except by the time it was served 4/5ths of them were drunk.
“I mean, you thought I’d believe adults sit on Santa’s lap,” Steve said with a smirk.  “Anything is possible.”
“There’s a video,” Tony says.  “It looks like - ”
The boys - her boys, Natasha thinks, a bit too fondly for her own liking - are clustered together, drawing glances from plenty of women (and a few men) and not even noticing in the slightest.  Thor’s regaling Banner and Stark with a story from his time as a sailor, his voice booming even in the busy crowd.  Rogers, his hands clenched around around a drink he hasn’t touched, is looking amused at something Clint’s saying; Natasha knows perfectly well that Clint’s been planning to get Rogers drunk enough to spill all his FBI secrets, and though she suspects that there isn’t enough booze in all of New York, she looks forward to watching him try.
“No,” Tony said.  “I guess I’m not.”
“That’s understandable,” Steve says.
rambling, is this contagious?”
bit, but - ”
“Who said I don’t feel the same way?” Tony said.
Steve pauses.  “So you know about - ”
Steve shrugged.  “The house doesn’t know the difference.”
“No big thing.  You’re in charge, right?”
Tony rolled onto his side, propped himself up on his elbow.  “I could write a whole book on it.  I’m probably the world’s foremost expert, besides Janet van Dyne.”
“That's the spirit,” Tony said.
“I knew you would,” Steve dismisses.  “And anyway, I’ve hit the water from higher, I’d be fine.”
- he is absolutely not invited.
“Stark?” Fury says.
“Heat signatures?” Steve said blankly.
The line at Hot Dog On a Stick was blessedly short, and by the time Clint had scarfed down his corn dog Tony had a plan.  “We’re sticking together and clearing one store at a time, all right?  You guys know how to search an area for a target, that knowledge is buried in there somewhere, let’s dig it out, all right?”
trying to do?”
“Not yet, boss.”
“It was a trying time for myself and the nation,” Tony said.
“Your career isn’t all you have.  You’ve got us, now.  The team.”
Steve sways; it doesn't hurt bad, but he's distracted for long enough that the switchblade swings up and catches him in the shoulder.  Pain blossoms down his arm, and the man holding the knife yanks it out and prepares another blow -
and the scent of gunpowder and, in the wall above Killian's head, a gaping, smoking hole.
good news, but if you were their harassed teammate-turned-legal-guardian, it was not good news
“That’s the corollary, yes.  Tony, do you need a toothbrush or something?”
They haven’t seen each other in the three days since Steve kissed him goodbye the morning after that first night, and it’s not that Tony
And he would have been enormously, embarrassingly wrong.  They ate, and they drank, and they ate some more, and then Tony went for a couple more bottles of wine, and then Steve cut them off because nobody wanted to be hungover tomorrow and you
“Self-centered much?” Stark says.  “Not everything is about you, Cap.”
Steve raises his eyebrows.
Clint wiggled his eyebrows.  “Handler, huh? Yeah, I can see that you’d be good at
“What was that, drunkie?” Tony said.
“No, me neither,” Tony said, though he wasn’t convinced.  “Pull back for a second.  Macro level.  People brush their teeth where they live, right?”
“Could be worse,” Banner says.
“I thought
"You didn't try to bribe me."
“Yeah, he’s the worst,” Rhodey says, rolling his eyes.
“Most things are.”
“Uh,” Tony said, “what?”
“What the hell are we listening to?” Clint said suddenly, looking accusingly at Tony.
Under the table Peggy elbowed him.
And when he woke up Steve wasn’t sure when he’d been awake and when he’d been asleep - but really, it didn’t matter much either way.
“That’s just petty, Nick.”
“How’d it go?”
“Edgar deals with toiletries,” Clint said, tossing a towel down and joining them.  “So, Tony, I see that at least one of my sparkling varietals is up to your standards.”
“Dude, I was in the circus, I’ll catch them.”
built Ultron after the Maximoff girl whammied you.”
“Well, anyway,” Miss Potts says, “I’d better go make sure Tony’s not trading 10% stake in the company for an extra hour from the band - have fun!”
“Well, I haven’t talked to Santa in a few years, but my good friend Iron Man told me you could use my help making sure any kids who were nervous to meet you know that you and I are friends.”
Steve takes a swing at the fella on his left, and his fist connects with a
lucky, they might even survive.
“Well, it sounds like you boys’ll need all the help you can get,” Natasha says.  “Tomorrow night.  We meet here at eleven.”
“I’d love one, Miss Romanov, and how about an ice cold water for my friend Dr. Banner,” Stark says, pushing up to the bar.  “Almost didn’t see you there, Rogers.”
Steve presses a rueful kiss to Tony’s lower lip. “I would, but I drove over with Bucky.”
“No,” Tony said, pinching the bridge of his nose.  “How did you know we were there?”
“Where is this,” Tony says.
“But it does kind of look like it has a face,” Bruce muses.  “Any other readings?”
“Oh,” Steve said.
“Why don’t we order Thai food?” Tony interrupted smoothly.  “Cap, you like Thai food.”
Steve, who was clearly
“That’s because I don’t,” Steve said.  “Do you have my Wikipedia page memorized?”
“And Glen Miller isn’t?”
“Man, you guys are so baked,” Tony said.
“Tony.”
“The space defense program was
"Didn't I take the first swing at Aldrich Killian's men last night?" Steve says.
Steve turns slowly, his glass still clenched in his hands.  “Sorry, Scott.  We’ll watch it.”
“I guess I can take comfort in that, at least,” Steve says.  “Could you point me in the direction of the nearest subway station?”
"Well, there was nothing good on TV," Steve mutters as Tony paws at his shirt, presses wet kisses to his neck and his collarbone.  "Were you at a party tonight?"
“I’m sorry my sound system isn’t up to your standards,” Clint said, rifling through his CD tower.  “You’re welcome to go stay at that
“Old fashioned?” Tony said.
And then he comes, his back arching off the bed, and Stark kisses him through it, swallowing his bitten-off moans and never slowing down, until a moment later he’s spending himself across Steve’s stomach, his hips juddering to a stop.
“You’re looking for Emil Blonsky,” Stark says abruptly.  “You’re trying to use Banner to get to him.”
“Ace-holey?” Morgan says, because she might be testing at eleventh grade reading levels at age six but, luckily for Tony, spelling isn’t her strong suit.
“Fair,” Tony said.
Tony wondered vaguely who he had pissed off, besides all the usual suspects.  This felt more as though he’d pissed somebody off in, like, a cosmic way.
“I am,” Quentin Beck says, swooping into the sphere of black between his drones.  “Very proud.”
“She did,” Steve says calmly, and he’s a better man than Tony, that’s for sure.
“What about Tony?” Steve said.
“Something like that,” Steve says, taking off his hat and joining them at the bar.  “You should see the other fella.”
.  But.  If you’d prefer to block, you might as well do it in style.”
“So,” Steve said, “you’re - ”
“So is this whole city,” Tony says.  “What’s one more bad guy, anyway?  Let him do what he wants.  We can still - ”
“I don’t think I can apologize if I don’t mean it,” Steve said.
“Something like that,” Steve said.
Tony dropped his head back onto the sofa.  “I regret everything.”
Tony has a feeling that Nick Fury doesn’t buy it for a second.
“Hey,” Steve says.  “So where are - ”
Bruce pinched the bridge of his nose in exasperation, an expression Tony would never get used to seeing on the Hulk.  “Tony.  Come on.”
"Adults do that now? Really?" Steve said, doubtfully.
“And Nicola Blake - is
“I’m sorry, shouldn’t you know?  You
“Yeah,” Steve says.  “Yeah, it’s me.  Buck - ”
“So that leaves me, making sure that this city isn’t drowned in a muck of its own making,” Pierce says.  “I make sure we don’t tip too far one way or the other.  But keeping that balance - it extracts a price.  There are certain people I’ve needed to bring on board, people who might in the light of day be considered unsavory, but people we need on our side.  It’s better, I’ve found, to keep your enemies close.
Her mouth twists wryly. "You're a big book. Could take a lifetime to learn. I've only read the first few pages."
“He’s awake,” Barnes says, standing up quickly.  Tony doesn’t bother asking how he knows - fucking supersoldier hearing, probably - and follows him into the room.
Everybody knows Aldrich Killian.  He runs half the speakeasies in Manhattan and sells an even higher percentage of the guns, and anybody who tries to stop him usually ends up swimming with the fishes at the bottom of the East River. The FBI's lost three good agents to his men this year alone.
?  He’s got more than one?”
way to - ”
“Jesus,” Tony muttered, and if that wasn’t permission then he didn’t know what was; he dragged Steve forward by the hair and thrust his cock all the way into Steve’s mouth, and Steve just took it, making his mouth into a perfect
“The police will be here any minute,” Thor says.
“Good thing I’m not asking you to,” Stark says.  “First of all, the metal’s literally priceless, so you couldn’t pay for it even if you really wanted to, and second of all, you can think of me as the team’s sponsor, all right?  It’s just the cost of doing business.  And we’re doing some pretty good business, if you ask me.”
?” Tony said.
“Oh, yeah?” Steve said, sliding a hand around his waist.
“He should break his hand,” Sam murmurs at Tony’s side.
- look, those nice hotels have plenty of trees in their lobbies, they can spare one.  And I figured they might - you know - do a favor.  For me.”
"Aren't you going to offer me a drink?" she says, and sees from his startle reflex that the question was entirely unanticipated. Interesting.  For a man with lips like an Italian poet and a frame like a Nebraska farmhouse, he acts like he's Quasimodo.
“Indeed,” JARVIS said sympathetically.
It’s all heat and noise and chaos, like a bomb went off in the center of the room, and even Steve is rattled enough that it takes half a second before he realizes that the force of the shot, which came out of one of the clockwork man’s arms, blew Tony across the room and straight through the back wall.  Through the smoke, Steve can just see the clockwork man lying in the rubble, perfectly still.
“Indeed, it would have been most unfortunate if you had chosen the other side,” Odinson rumbles as he grapples with one of Blonsky’s big men.
Rhodey and Steve look up innocently.  “No,” Rhodey says.
“That was a
“I thought I did and I was wrong,” Tony says shortly.  “Is that what you wanted to hear?”
“What do you mean,
He unzips the bag and pulls it out, star-side up.
"Guess so," Steve says.
Tony goes home too, and holds Morgan tight, and he thinks that probably, underneath it all, what he’s feeling is
need you,” Pepper says, and he wishes she was angry at him, but she just sounds disappointed.  “We always need you.”
Steve glanced at his watch.  “It’s 8:15.”
Now that he's said his name, Steve recognizes the man from the papers.  "Industrialist?  That what they're calling war profiteers these days?"
“We left you alone before.”
“Really?” Steve says, his eyebrows shooting up.  “What did it sound like?”
When Tony frantically sat up and wrenched his facemask off he found that, while he was not currently living his
“Damn, Steve, you can throw a punch!” Clint said, rubbing his jaw and looking impressed.  “No wonder that guy grows up to be a superhero.”
“Hey, no complaints, I didn’t mind the view,” Natasha said, “but then again I don’t think Steve even noticed the rest of us were there.”
No, what Tony’s created is actually an artificial UNintelligence.  It can’t so much as spell its own name (which is Dopey, for the record, no acronym, not his best work, he’ll get the marketing people on it eventually) without his explicit go ahead, but what it
Morgan shrugs, and Tony heads for the kitchen optimistically.  “Morning,” Steve says, catching up with him at the stove and passing over a plate of still-warm pancakes.  “You said I should stop by today, and I thought - sorry if it was too early, or - ”
you’re concerned about me not being able to keep my mouth shut?”
“Captain Rogers has unrestricted access to your files,” Friday reminds him.
“Are you talking about me?” he says.
Steve and the Hawk both look around.  A man Steve's never seen before, dressed to the nines and wearing a hat that probably cost as much as Steve's monthly pay, stands under the one bright light in the whole bar.
“Back to normal,” Steve said, grinning.
"This was before," Steve says, and his heart pounds.  "A while ago.  During - "
Steve blinked.  “Oh.”
Steve thinks about two years ago, when the chaos had trailed off and they’d made it back to the US, and he’d gone down to Atlanta to see Sam’s sister.  She’d made him a cup of coffee and they’d sat on the sofa, the box of Sam’s things on the coffee table between them.
against it,” Tony said.
“What’s all the noise?” Bruce said around a yawn as he traipsed into the kitchen.  He peered into the microwave.  “Is that nachos?”
As predicted, Tony’s phone starts ringing.
Steve smiles at him wryly.  “Can’t argue with that.”
But Steve was already jogging away.
to about it.”
“I kind of assumed she was the boss,” Clint said, jerking his head toward Natasha.
to be able to tell it was fake, but if the broad smiles on their faces were any sign, they didn’t have a clue.
Peter follows his gaze.  “Um,” he says, “are you okay?”
“Oh, very funny, forgive me for being a paragon of honesty and candor, Spangles.”
“Why would I be experimenting on your toothbrush?”
But, curiously enough, that Friday night Twitter lit up brighter than the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree with reports of Santa himself flying around the five boroughs distributing presents at shelters, and if his reindeer and sleigh seemed powered more by repulsors than magic, well, none of the adults were going to mention it.
without revealing that he’s Spiderman, and it would be a really bad time for that because it’s midterms next week and -

Maria Hill took slightly more pity on him.  She confirmed that SHIELD was researching the magic at play and they were “pretty sure” the effects were temporary (which, wow, talk about reassuring), and then she ordered fifteen pizzas, and
“No.”
On the second floor, Mrs. Letendre stands, hair silvering in the steam, over a boiling tub of diapers, tending to the sanitizing wash and a fuming kettle of cabbage simultaneously. She has flung open all the doors and windows in her family's tiny apartment to deal with the sweltering heat, and she nods to Natasha without recognition, her spectacles as befogged as a lobsterman's.
He’d always had nightmares, and when he was lucky, he’d had someone to wake him up from them.  When he was a kid, it was his ma, her cool hand on his forehead and her lips at his ear.  When they were on the ground in Germany, Bucky used to nudge him until he jerked awake, and Bucky would laugh at him until he relaxed enough to laugh too.  When he was on the run, Nat would slam a door or drop something heavy, and when he emerged from his room Sam would be watching TV, plenty of space cleared on the sofa beside him.
Steve spun around, and the landscape completely changed, but Steve didn’t really notice, because Tony was standing right in the middle of it.  “Hey.”
"She's a smart lady," Steve says.  "I just have a couple of questions."
And in the middle of it all, Banner, whaling on the fourth man, fists flying, the sickening crunch of bones breaking and the wet thumps of blood vessels popping -
