That was the time when a scrawny Sentinel entered the Super Solider program. Steve Rogers was small and inconsequential, yet his score as a Sentinel was strange enough to make him a great candidate. When he under went the serum, everything exploded. Literally and figuratively. The entire world around him seemed to explode into colors, sensations and auditory inputs. The serum had made him perfect in all ways. He was the perfect Sentinel. The most powerful ever known. A blessing and a curse. For he knew in his heart that there would never be a Guide that would be able to handle his powers. Even Howard Stark, a genius and one of the highest Guides, could not handle all the input that he was giving off. He supposed it was for the best though. He had a mission to do. Even Peggy Carter, the Guide second only to Howard, could not handle him. Together though, the two helped him through the war and through losing his best friend Bucky. So he figured it was a good thing that he did a suicide mission. For his life would always be a half life, on a razors edge of insanity and violence at all times. The shock of the ice would have been a shock for anyone. But it was more intense for Steve, intense enough to slam his mind into a coma and thus into a state stasis with the help of the freezing properties of the ice.
"This coffee is the only reason I am forgiving you for breaking into my place" He grumbled, picking his head up off the table only to take drinks off the delicious coffee. Soon it was gone. He looked at the cup with a pitiful look before Steve slid another one over to him. Jet looked at the coffee then Steve then the coffee again.
"I….am not going anywhere Tony. You and the other Avengers have become like my family. I just…don't know how to handle things of this world like everyone else. It gets to me sometimes." Steve said, feeling Tony's arms flex around his waist. He chuckled a bit, a bitter sound. "Plus I won't get any peace if I leave, especially once that article hits the stands."
"How…lonely it must get. But he does not seem to care about those he calls friends." Steve hedged, not asking but knowing that they would correct his assumption. Bruce and Pepper shared a smile before laughing. Even Natasha smiled a bit. Which was scary to see.
"That is great. So how long do you think you will be staying in this area?" Harold asked, making it seem like he was making small talk. Sadly, Jet felt the need to pick the man a part mentally. He knew the man was after something from him. He hated how he felt that way. He hated how he felt like these two people wanted something from him instead of just accepting their desire to return a favor. Why was he like that? What happened to him that made him lose hope in humanity? He looked back at Harold before sighing.
Steve eventually left. Jet…No, Tony was surprised about how easy it was to just talk to the man. It was nice to just have someone there who enjoyed his company, who was willing to just grin at his strange ways. Zac never did that. Zac didn't like it when he spoke about things that seemed to not make sense. Steve just smiled at him when he rambled on. Tony laid on the bed and he closed his eyes, wanting tomorrow to come faster. He wanted to spend more time with Steve.
"EMERGENCY! SUBJECT SNOW HAS ESCAPED! SUBJECT SNOW IS TO BE TRANQUILIZED! SUBJECT CONFIRMED ABILITY!" Red lights flashed as the mechanical echo blasted through the speakers. He turned the corner and ducked under a fist. It had a taser it in. Instinctively he balled his hands into fist and slammed them into precise areas. The man crumbled to the floor. He continued to run, not stopping to think of anything but freedom.
"At Ease Solider." A solid voice called. There were Guides in the men with the guns. He could feel each of them trying to ease the sensation coming at him from all around. He was grateful that they were blocking out all the inputs that were coming at him. Though it reminded him that he required that many people to block out some of the things that were coming at him. The man walked to him, with the strange grace of a tiger. He knew the man was a Sentinel, with experience but not at the same level as himself.
It was suppose to be a routine mission. Dr. Doom and his doom bots were causing all sort of Chaos on Manhattan island. The Avengers were called. Yet, the mission turned out to be anything but ordinary. The doom bots had been upgraded to be able specialized for each of the Avengers. While Tony was able to, spur of the moment, rework the Iron man suit to function under the electromagnetic waves that were being thrown his way. The other Avengers were not so lucky. They had been fighting for hours. The doom bots seemed relentless and Dr. Doom was doing something that Tony knew would alter the world forever. That is when Tony decided to take everything in. Take in the entire situation and pray for a plan of action.
"Stop. Whatever you are thinking about. Whatever you are worried about, we can fix it. We will fix it and it will be okay. I promise you, We will help you with anything." He said in a serious tone. Jet felt like this was not the first time Steve talked to him like this. It was almost a sense of deja vu going on. Jet wanted nothing more than to lean over and kiss that serious mouth. But he held himself back. He did not want to find out that they had been broken up for a while and came to be friends. With all the dreams he had been having before their arrival, he deeply wished that to be not true. Instead he just smiled a bit.
"For you….I will" Tony said in a soft whisper. Steve's hand squeezed over his for a moment. Jet/Tony looked up and gave Steve a wide grin. There was still something between them. This wasn't like what he felt with Pepper. This was something deeper and stronger. Something still alive, though stilted by his disappearance. He couldn't wait till it wasn't stilted any longer. He wanted to be safe again. He wanted that relationship again. He wanted Steve to hold him again. He would do anything for that.
"Do it J.A.R.V.I.S!" Tony snapped as he shot into the air. The A.I muttered an affirmative. Tony was speeding off towards where Dr. Doom was. He tuned into his communication lines.
In 1890 laws were passed all over the world to protect the Guide and Sentinel relationship. While forming a Bond between a pair was sometimes difficult, it was still necessary for the Enhancements. It was even found that powerful Sentinel would fly into a violent and sinister rage whenever their mate was harmed. Needless to say a person with their skill were dangerous.
"Sure, I would like that." Jet felt his heart beat faster as Zac gave him a slow and confident smile. Damn that smile was a killer. They finished up their food and headed out. Zac seemed enthusiastic about the town. He showed him all the spots where he hung out at. The diner, the old time theater, the bowling alley and the roof top of town hall, that over looked the entire town. It was nice to just sit up there and talk about the town. Jet learned that there was a research facility in the next town that was working on some kind of thing having to do with the stars. Jet looked up at the sun filled sky, finding it hard to imagine the number of stars that would be out at night. While he was walking in the desert he had been not taken the time to actually look, his mind so focused on getting to the town.
"Well, the diner is just across the street. That is where I normally get my food. Want to go over and grab a bit before you go looking around the town?" Zac asked with a charming smile. The smile was a little off as well, but Jet just nodded, making sure he had the food voucher that Marco gave him for lunch. It seemed that the diner and the shop had a system. People got their cars worked on over here and went over for lunch. It was a great system. It got more people into the diner and it also gave Marco time to figure out what was wrong with the cars.
"Hi..." Jet returned, not sure what to say. His eyes fell to the coffee, staring at it like it was the holy grail.
"Did you just use me as a replacement for him? Huh? TELL ME! " Zac reached back and grabbed the hair on the back of his neck, yanking it back before he bit viciously down on the side of his neck. White hot pain ripped through his body. Fear gripped him. Zac was a strong man. Stronger then himself. He feared where this was going. He knew Zac would be angry that he lied to him, but it was obviously that there was something more there. Something he had done to the man in his old life. The hand ripped off his mouth. He struggled to apologize but a hand smacked heavily across his face.
"No, Captain America is an idol, but not someone to be jealous of. I don't know the man behind the mask. I...am relearning you." Tony said with a cocky grin. They were hidden by the side of the building. No one could see them at all. Steve took advantage of this, reaching out and tugging Tony over by his new jacket. He reached up and held Tony's face before pushing his fingers back into that longish hair. He grinned before leaning down and stealing a kiss.
The diner was nice, clean and friendly. He ordered a large BLT with french fries and a large iced coffee. Zac and Jet talked about cars, keeping to a safe topic for now. But Jet couldn't help but feel like Zac was feeling him out for some reason. There was always a reason. But for now Jet ignored it in favor of looking around at the diner. There were people of all types here. But one thing was for certain, they all just came from the desert. Many were still covered in sand. He smiled a bit at the waitress who came to set the plate down in front of him. He ate slowly, again, but quickly. He wanted to get out and learn his surroundings. He wanted to be prepared just in case someone from the group that had been holding him showed up. He may not remember anything, but he looked up information on wounds, and the ones he had on him were caused in the last week or so. That meant those people in that building that self destructed were the cause of them. He would not be caught off Sentinel and returned to that position. Especially after he heard that whatever they had done to him was a success. He just hoped that they assumed that he died in the self destruction.
"Tony." His tone was firm, but he kept his expression soft. He wanted Tony to trust him. He knew he messed up but here Tony was, once again, trying to help him. The least he could do was help Tony. Tony looked at him, almost as if he was taking the man apart before he stepped closer and hid himself in Steve's chest. Steve was a little taken back by all this touching between men. Or rather he was more taken back by how willing Tony was to be this close to him. Steve always hid the fact he was attracted to men from everyone save Bucky. But Tony was overtly heterosexual. Hell the man said himself, that he was a playboy.
"Most people forget I am an engineer with dexterous fingers and the ability to slip screws out of tight spots easily. Taking this out of the hands of a super solider gone mad, child's play. Well almost. So whats up Cap? What's got you so….riled up?" Tony asked in a casual tone as he spun the phone around and effortlessly ended the sound that was coming from the phone. Steve stared at the phone, another reminder of how much Tony belonged in this world while he did not. He balled this hands into fists.
"I suppose I could make a couple pairs for S.H.E.I.L.D and maybe a couple pairs for the Society of Enhanced Humans in specific condensed areas. But not too many because that could pose a problem." He said dull tone. He finished off his scotch before he looked at the goggles. Even with them, he seriously doubted he would be able to find a Sentinel that would be able to handle his Guide powers enough to bond with him. He had been looking all these years. No luck. Even with his money, all the Sentinel that he came into contact with him were unable to forge a strong enough bond with him. He was just...going to give up. It was the best thing he could do. Continue to drink and have random sex. It was all he could do to stay sane. It was all he could do to have some semblance at a happy life.
Coulson was ushering Tony into the building. Tony was still very drunk and still in a spiral, though considerably slower spiral now. Tony let out a soft groan as his mind was immediately blankets by a series of shields and emptiness. It seemed that this wasn't going to be so bad. Tony stumbled and fell into a bed that Coulson seemed to have produced. Or was it he was finally to the room? It didn't matter much to him any more. His mind was struggling to process everything. There was echoes in his mind. Residual feelings and thoughts bouncing around in his mind from earlier. If he wasn't a genius and if he wasn't a strong guide, he would have already succumb to the Spiral. But because of those things, he was able to push it off some. He was able to process the information faster, but no fast enough to stop it. His eyes tightened as pain crept down his head to his spine. He gripped the sheets and whimpered.
"It's ok, Tony. It'll be ok" Steve said against his hair, placing another kiss there. Tony wanted to deny this, wanted to tell Steve that they could hurt him like they had hurt Tony. Instead, he just melted into those arms again. He took a deep breath, breathing in that smell of leather, ice and masculinity.
"He is a genius of the highest caliber. He makes me look like a regular guy, hell he makes Reed Richards look like a regular guy. He bested his father at a young age. But what is more then that is that he is constantly in the public eye. Anything and everything he does is under a microscope. He has a bad break up, and everyone is out to get him. Everyone wants a piece of him. If the world knew he was affection starved, desperate for someone to touch him and understand him, what do you think would happen? What do you think his enemies would do?" Bruce whispered the last part softly.
"He is extremely tactile. To the point that he seems to actively seek out the touches of those he trusts. He touches Pepper's elbow when she stands near him. He will poke Bruce. He does this in order to make up for the lack of affection Howard, your friend, deprived him of as a kid." Natasha said in an even tone. It was the look in her eyes that suggested she started with this line of information based on what could have happened last night. Clint must have told her. Who was he kidding, he knew Clint told her. The two assassins shared a bond stronger than any of the other Avengers. He had heard whispers of the things that Howard had done to Tony as a kid. Absent and abrasive to Tony, forcing the boy to grow up in a cold hard world that was out to get everything they could from him. It made more sense when he looked at it from that point of view. A child who everyone wanted something from yet denied true affection, would grow up desperate for affection. Yet they would seek it only from those who they trusted to just give him that without wanting anything else from him.
Steve could feel the space between them as if it was a physical thing. Everyone spoke to him with such professionalism and politeness that it was hard to breach into any sort of relationship beyond work.
Heat scrapped over his skin as he continued to run, struggling to remain standing as the golden red sand slowed him down. The explosions continued. One after another. The entire place was consumed by flames. It was a good thing that whatever building he just left was in the a desert. If it hadn't been, the explosion would have caused huge damage to the surrounding area. Yet it was a horrible thing because there he was, running through a desert with no idea where he was, what had happened. Worse yet, he had no idea who he was. All he knew was that he was not going to die in this desert. He was going to survive.
"Yeah, a younger you would be a great way to hide from the world. Or it would have been if Pepper hadn't already announced that you have been found alive." Bruce said as he looked over the scans again, his glasses falling down his nose. Tony looked startled from a moment.
"You ok? You were calling out my name. Did you remember something?" Steve asked, concern laced in that tone. Tony let out a jerky laugh, his body still shaking with unsatiated lust. He shook his head, curling his legs up to his chest. He…he couldn't dare tell Steve about the erotic dreams he was having about him. What if they were broken up? What if they were just friends and the dreams were just erotic fantasies?
"What is your name?" He asked softly, looking back at the lid of his cup. He wanted to know the name of this man, this man that haunted his dreams.
"I am Ironman" He whispered, causing Hawkeye and Widow to pause in their actions. They sent Steve quick look. Steve stared at Tony with a serious look. Tony lifted his chin, daring the man to deny it. Steve just looked to Hawk and Window, nodding at them. They loaded the men into the car, leaving SHEILD to clean up the area. Steve stood in front of the ramp leading into the jet. He stared at Tony.
"Well Cap, you have proven that even you are stupid enough to not see the warning signs that your life is in danger." The man said in a snarky tone. Clint simply rolled his eyes as Tony walked to one seat and sat in it. The brunette leaned back into his chair, staring intently at the blond before he pulled out his tablet. He began to work, focusing on the electronic device. Steve closed his eyes, feeling his mind working on repairing itself already. He had been able to avoid entiering the Oblivion State during the World War without the cuffs because he had a reason to use his hieghtened senses as a means to dominate the battle field. His eye sight allowed him to memorize a map that he barley glanced at. His hearing allowed him to dodge flying bullets and his sense of smell allowed him to smell a bomb trap yards a head of him. He had a reason to take advantage of his senses. But in civiliar life it was too much. He had no reason for it. He just wanted to be Steve Rogers, scrawny and unhealthy guy with amazing art skills. That is what he wanted to be when he was civilian. But he couldn't be that any more. He was the man He knew his mind was fixing itself because of the massive headache he had building between his eyes. He just wanted to be normal for a little bit longer, but it seemed the more he tried to be normal, the more damage he did to himself. He either had to resigned to a life of courting insanity or an endless cycle of hurting himself. But for now, he took advantage of Stark's strong Guide presences and fell into a light slumber.
"Why do you keep laughing?" Jet asked, still unsure of Steve, but the companionable atmosphere and the rightness of everything was enough to let him know he made the right choice. Steve paused in his sketching to look up at Jet. There was a softness in those blue eyes and a depth of caring that made Jet uneasy.
"I have been alive long, mortal, and I know the man who stands before me is the Man of Iron. Yet, he does not greet me like my shield brother. If you have anything to do with this, you shall pay." Thor stepped back and looked at Jet. He walked to the man and clasped his shoulder.
"So, you are really good with cars it seems." Harold said with a grin on his lips. Jet's eyes narrowed a fraction, going unnoticed by anyone in the room. He was already trying to figure out what Harold wanted from him.
"I don't appreciate you invading my Guide's privacy Stark." Natasha's cool tone said through the speaker. He could already pick up Natasha's anger. But as soon as it came, it was soothed over by Pepper's feeling for him. He felt so bad that he was virtually looking in on their bond. No other Guide to date could do that. Oh how special he was. For all his bravado and mask of a cocky arrogant man, he was not. He stood strong on the things that he believed in, fought tooth and nail to do so. But everything else was kind left to his whims.
"Who is this?" Zac asked as he squeezed Jet's shoulder a bit. Jet inwardly cringed. He almost wanted to keep Steve in the apartment in order to keep Zac's anger at bay. Steve stared at Zac for a moment before he took his sketch book back, closing in and leaning back in the chair.
"Yes, Tony" Steve whispered, his voice seeming to drop down an octave. Jet, Tony, shivered at the tone.
"Hello Jane...Thor." He said awkwardly, keeping his eyes from the other two. He heard one of them suck in a harsh breath before the sound of ceramic breaking could be heard. Jet's eyes automatically flew to the broken cup. The hand holding it was huge. He followed the hand up to thickly corded arms and neck and up to...
"Good talk Cap, now I got some work to do on this phone of yours. I will see you later." Tony said, making a very obvious retreat. Steve stood there for a moment, realizing what just happened. He found he kinda of….liked having Tony in his arms. It was like the one place he knew he could keep the man safe. He stuffed his hands into his pockets and went off to grab a sketch book. He figured that if he sketched what was on his mind in this moment, he could figure out what he was feeling in those moments of holding Tony.
"Are...there pictures of..." Jet asked, letting his legs fall off the chair. He wanted to see if he was who they thought he was. Steve nodded and set his pencil down before closing the book and opening it to the right set of pages and held it out to Jet. Jet hesitated before taking it. There was a picture of a man bending over a rather sophisticated looking machine. He flipped the page and there was the same man, with a rather intricate looking goatee, grinning with grease on his face. He continued to flip through the pages before he came to one that man his heart stop. It was the most intimate of all of them.
"R-really? That's great...Who is it?" He asked, looking from Clint to Natasha and then back at Pepper. Pepper laughed again before grabbing Natasha's hand tightly. It was obvious that she was telling her Match to tell Steve.
It was obvious to anyone that watched that Tony was Banner's best friend. They spoke about things that no other man could understand. They both seemed to enjoy how much they just understood one another. Tony understood Bruce needed someone who wasn't afraid to poke fun at him, taunt him and just be a friend to him. Bruce understood how much Tony needed affection and someone to just be around. It was one of the reasons why Tony asked Bruce to stay in Stark tower with him after the renovations were done. While Tony used the fact they had a huge lab that Bruce could use, a huge plus, Bruce used being in a companionable atmosphere as a reason to move in. Tony never made Bruce feel like he was an outsider.
"Well Played, Mr. Rogers." J.A.R.V.I.S said in a softer voice. Steve smiled, glad he found something he could give the other man. He would give the man the necessities to live when he got caught up in himself.
"Clint is talking to Marco right now about your job. We need to check how much work you have been doing and if you did anything...custom" Steve said with a shrug, walking back to the sitting area.
"Wet them" Steve said, his tone getting huskier each passing moment. Tony complied happily. He wrapped his lips around those fingers, running his tongue over the pads of those fingers, tasting the leather of the bike and Steve there. He sucked and worked them, treating them the way he would Steve's cock if he had the chance. Steve watched with blown out pupils before removing them from Tony's mouth and returning them to their original position.
He paused at this, pushing the power back for a moment as he laid there in the dark and considered this. Did that mean the dream, the very vivid and realistic dream he just had wasn't really a dream? Rather it was a memory? His mind was screaming yes at him. It felt so right that he figured it was. Hope seemed to take root in his chest. He reached up and tapped his fingers on top of the machine in his chest. Nothing on the data helped him figure out what it was. He had caught a trail of it for a moment, but had slammed into a serious set of walls blocking him from finding out anything about it.
"We were on a couch. Your shirt was off and there was a bandage on your shoulder. I think you or I changed it because the bandage looked fresh." Tony said, skimming off some of the details in the hopes that Steve would just gloss over it. A strange look descended over Steve's face for a moment. Tony shifted a bit as Steve stared down at him with a different expression. Silence seemed to be deafening.
After losing Steve to the war effort and once the war was done, Howard Stark continued on with his life. He married a nice woman named Jamie, an intelligence agent and a Sentinel. The first time they tried to have a child, Maria miscarried. Nearly destroyed by this, Howard threw himself even further into his work, until one day he stumbled across something that would change the world forever. He had been in a bar for Guides and Sentinel to mingle when he noticed something that was completely out of the norm. Across the room, a Sentinel stood up sharply and whirled around on his heels. He stared across the room at Howard, or rather to the left of Howard. The genius' guide abilities to read people's emotions exploded. Every Guide in the room was clutching their heads and every Sentinel was tense. The man next to Howard, however, was none of these things. He was entranced. The Sentinel crossed the room in definite steps and grabbed the Guide. Their bodies glowed bright blue before it vanished. Howard looked startled, the intense possessive emotions vanished and a strong sense of contentment fell across the room. Howard was perplexed by not only what happened but the blue glow as well. Hesitantly he asked what had happened and the Sentinel replied that he had found his Soul Mate, his perfect match. Howard stared at the man, assuming he was speaking of the legend. That wasn't possible….but he had seen it happen. So what did he do? He researched and tried to figure out a way to make it so that every Sentinel and Guide, even himself, could find their perfect match. But alas the technology of the day did not allow him to create the means to do so. So he wrote it down for the next generation.
"Thanks Tony. Best work out to date." And he left it at that. He didn't look back, but that was a turning point for him. He knew for a fact, Thor did not go to town on the punching bags as much as he did. Thor would rather fight Steve than a 'lifeless sand of bag'. Tony had lied again and had done something for one of the team members. Took time away from his company, his missions and other projects to build them things they needed to stay on top of things. He did something completely selfless. Tony did not use any of the things he made, except for the Iron Man suit.
He made sure he was all clean and ready to go, wearing his recently washed jumper. He wanted to be sure that Zac was not late for his job. Zac seems not to be a morning person at all. He was brash, snarly and cruel. He always made snide smart ass remarks whenever Jet asked a question that seemed obvious to the other man. Jet learned by the end of the ride to the shop, to not to question Zac. Jet was glad that Marco seemed nice and glad to have help. Marco ran through a series of issues that could happen to a car and tested Jet on what he would do to fix it. Jet seemed to pass, because he was given another jump suit with the company logo on it and told to get to work.
"Found one!" Tony said waving it around. Steve looked up from his phone to Tony before looking back absently. Suddenly Steve's face jerked back up and a blush grew bright across his cheeks. Tony was startled by this. He lowered it.
"But he died. Yinsen died." Tony whispered against Steve's shoulders, some how knowing that Steve knew who he was talking about. Steve's arms flexed around him.
"Are you telling me, you want to protect my heart Steve?" Tony asked in a hesitate voice. It was as if the darkness of the night gave Tony the chance to open himself up, be vulnerable to Steve. There was a skip in his heart beat at the idea of being the one that protects Tony's heart. The very heart he had hurt so many months ago. They had come so far, it seems. Because Steve desperately wanted to be that person for Tony. To be the one that protects the most precious and fragile part of Tony. The part no one, save Pepper, had the chance to protect.
"There is a meeting at 0600 tomorrow on this floor in that room." She pointed to a seemingly random door before she pointed her finger at Steve. "Do not miss it" With that she followed Bruce to the elevator. When the metal doors closed, he was left in the room with Clint. The man's hand flexed on his shoulder.
"Obediah Stane." Tony said, as if answering the unasked question. "He was like a father figure to me when my father died. He helped me with the company. But then he paid the terrorist to kidnap me. They did this to me. They made it so I have to live with this reactor. Then he ripped it from my chest and left me to die. I trusted him. I trusted him with everything I was, and he tried to kill me twice." Tony whispered in a broken tone. It was clear now, that Tony did not suffer from insomnia. Rather he suffered from nightmares. It made sense now. Tony did not want to be alone. It made even more sense why Tony was Sentineled. Steve shifted and pushed a little bit on the reactor. Tony looked up bewildered.
"Are you ok Tony?" Pepper asked as concerned washed off her in strong waves. It was only her closeness to Natasha that canceled out her thoughts as well. She reached out and took a hold of Natasha's hand when she noticed Tony wince. It seemed emotions were running higher today. He could feel so much that it was nearly suffocating him. He hadn't noticed it before because his mind had been focused on the tablet. But now he had nothing to focus on, so his mind sought out everything to focus on. He figured his genius was the reason why his powers were so strong. His mind needed to be occupied at all times. What better way to do that then to get constant input from everyone in a 25 miles range? He took another shot of bourbon, feeling his senses numb a bit more.
'Have to get free. Have to get free.' Was all he could think about in that moment. His hand moved over the walls, searching for some kind of door. He hit his hand not the wall, when he found none.
"Dude, you got the wrong guy. This is Jet Snow. Not whoever you think." Zac said, obviously upset about something. Jet felt bad because he lied to Zac about his name. Everyone thought that he remembered his name and nothing else. Jet looked up at the man and took a step back in fear. The Blond, Thor?, looked at Zac like he was going to kill him. The blond walked up to Zac, looking from Jet and then back again. Jet wanted to hide from that look. He crossed his arms, trying to ease the discomfort her felt. Yet...he felt something a kin to joy and humor at Thor's actions. He was confused by this. He was confused by the entire situation.
The scene they came upon was not what they had been expecting to see. Sure everything was burnt, and there were pieces of metal and circuitry all over the place. But there were no body parts. There was no body. Nothing. Steve walked up the face plate. He picked it up and brushed the dirt and the bits of rock. He turned it over, finding some blood on it, but not at all the amount he had expected. He stood there, looking as the Avengers and SHEILD agents moved around to pick up the pieces. He held the face plate like it was a life line. Tony's body was missing. No one could find any evidence of his body ever being present. They found only car tracks leaving the area. SHEILD was sending agents to follow the tracks.
"Your hands…fingers were…" Tony shifted, trying to get more of Steve's skin on his. It was familiar yet foreign. Yet still so delicious. Steve's hands flexed on his waist, keeping him in place. Those blue eyes stared up at him, lust clear there. But it was laced with something that made Tony's breath hitch. It was more then simple lust. More then he was willing to hope or think about at this time. How could he when those thumbs were rubbing circles against his hips, making his mind swim with anticipation.
"It is I, Thor. Do you recall such a name?" The man asked, his booming voice now soft and controlled. Jet shook his head, staring at the large man. He felt something towards this man. But he was not the blond from his dreams. He could tell that. But the man was familiar.
Jet stepped back and slammed the hood of the old truck down. It's owner, one would be in to pick it up in another half and hour. He walked to the garage door, watching as thunder clouds rolled in. A desert storm most likely. Jet would welcome some rain and chaos that came with the storm. It matched his current mood. The storm rolled in, but no rain came. None what so ever. Jet looked over the crappy cellphone he bought a couple of days ago. Zac had taken a lunch break before him, since Jet had been intensely focused on the truck. It had needed work and he did not want Dr. Foster to have to come in again. Not that he told Marco that. He normally did a bit more work on the cars that belonged to women and families.
Steve snorted at this, but the look Pepper shot him made him shut up and let Bruce continue. Even though he doubted that Tony wanted nothing more then to mock him, he would hear them out. They seemed to know Tony better then he did. Especially Pepper. He had to know that Pepper wouldn't tell him anything that was not true.
"Tony, tomorrow, you, Bruce and Jarvis need to figure out what is going on with…whatever you have going on." Steve said, sounding stern and serious. Tony felt his lips twitch.
When he was seventeen, his parents died in a car crash. He couldn't help but feel some relief that he wouldn't have to deal with the constant influx of hatred from his parents. Obadiah Stane stepped up to take control of Stark Industries while Tony continued to move through college gathering degrees. When he turned 21, he took over the company. Things seemed okay. Obadiah was nice to him, though all his thoughts was the word soon and all the emotion that came off the man was a strange sense of glee. It wasn't until he was 24 that he figured out what that meant. He gained a great Sentinel assistant, Virginia "Pepper" Potts. She could ease some of the emotions that were influx in around him. But for the most part, she left him to his own devices. Things spiraled out of control when he was 25. He was kidnapped, tortured, made the Arc Reactor and the first Iron Man suit as well as felt, for the first time, someone die. All this made him drink more and more, have sex with more and more people. He was spirally down and it was like he was own a suicide mission. His self-destructive ways exploding all around him. He was on a downward spiral that no Sentinel in the world could stop. Which was a shame, because the entire Enhanced society desperately wanted to keep Tony alive. He was too powerful to lose. They had already lost the most powerful Sentinel to date, they didn't want to lose Tony on top of it.
Tony worked through the night and well into the next day. He was working on a making it so that his tablet's camera could see the waves as well. That way he had a set of goggles on his at all times without it actually being goggles. He finished right at noon the next day. Steve was still out of it. It was normal. Tony knew people who were out for weeks after spending that many days with the bands on. Tony was getting ready to leave when he felt…something. It was a strange tugging sensation. He looked at Steve, startled. The man was still asleep. It had been a glorious feeling. Because for a moment, the outside noise was gone. No one's thoughts and emotions. Nothing. For a split second he had peace. But now they flooded back in. Tony staggered, shaking his head to re-acclimate himself to the normal level of noise that came from the Helicarrier.
"What?" Tony asked with a frown. He was starting to feel angry for some reason. He couldn't place it but he was just feeling so…angry. His brows knitted together as he struggled to place his anger, but it was slowly consuming him. It was weird. It was unnatural and it was growing.
"Yeah, we heard something rattling around. We have a distance to go still and we figured that we get it checked out now." The guy said with a grin. The man's attitude was almost infectious. If he wasn't on edge from what happened yesterday he would have returned the smile. As it was, the woman was staring at him in a way that made him want to run for cover. He waved between them.
"It would seem that you have a tiny nano bits inside you. I don't have access to their codes, since JARVIS is being blocked form your end. The bots have, some how, reconstructed your body. You look younger and physically you are. Your muscles are stronger. Overall they have made you a younger, fitter and stronger version of you." Bruce said, giving Tony a shy smile as he flipped the scans over so Tony no longer had to read them backwards. Tony let out a small huh of intrigue.
"More like he does not want to let the Other guy get to…excited that you are alive." Natasha replied in a cool tone, looking behind Tony toward Steve, who was walking on the other side of the once missing man. Steve nodded in understanding. They had been having problems with the Hulk since Tony's apparent death. It seemed that Tony was the only reason the Hulk listened to anyone. Tony was his favorite. So it was uncertain what would happen when Banner saw Tony again. It was the reason the timid man stayed home when they went to Nevada on Thor's word that Tony was living there.
"He tore it from my chest." Tony whispered softly. Steve waited patiently, even though rage coursed through his veins. He knew that the reactor in Tony's chest was the only thing keeping the man alive. It had, at one time, slowly started to kill the man. But the ever resourceful and genius Tony figured out how to make that stop.
"That's not possible. He was int he same room with me for almost an entire day. I would have felt it." He muttered. He stared down at the screen. There on the screen was Tony's wave. It was a thick blue wave that had a lot of bumps in it. Steve's red wave was just as thick and was exactly opposite to Tony's in every way. He stared down at it as the word Perfect Match flashed on and off on the screen. Steve felt his world narrow. In that moment all he could see was that screen. All he could hear was his heart beat. That was it. This was his match. His match was Tony Stark; Genius, Billionaire, Playboy, Philathropist and the Powerful Guide. He looked up from the screen to Pepper and asked the one question that was on everyone's mind.
"Ah! Zac! Just the man I wanted to see. Jet this is Zac. He also works at the Shop. Hey, is Marco still looking for a mechanic. Jet here is good with cars. He fixed mine." Harold said as Zac walked into the room. Jet felt like he was punched in the gut. The man was tall and strong. With corded muscles and a very serious built, yet that is not what made him feel uneasy. It was the eyes. There were a deep grey blue. Not the right color blue though, his mind whispered. He looked taken back for a moment, not sure what the right color blue was but the man looked amazing. His dyed blond hair and blue eyes accompanied by those muscles made him a very attractive man. Jet shook Zacs hand.
The index finger moved around the edge before it slowly pushed inside of Tony. Tony threw his head back and let out a gasp, pleasure mixing with the burn of penetration. It was exhilarating. Steve's finger worked it's way into him slowly, but it wasn't enough. Tony pushed back, gaining a groan from Steve.
Tony was feeling strange having a conversation with something that was clearly not alive. But there was something comforting about the coding that was wrapped around this data stream. Even though it was communicating with him, it was still a set of very complex yet strangely elegant code lines.
"Yeah, but what is it? You can tell me. I promise not to tell." He said, knowing he sounded a bit childish. Tony gave him a calculating look before a small smile appeared on his lips. His fingers crawled cautiously across the table, towards the plate. Steve pretended to look perplexed.
"Well we know that since you were wearing the bracelets during your first couple of meetings with Tony that they were the reason you didn't know he was your perfect match. But as for being in the same room for him a couple of days, I have no idea. I mean, only Tony and a group of scientists know how the bracelet actually work" Clint said with a shrug. That was all the other man seemed to know. Which was fine because Pepper made a soft hum before speaking herself.
"You remember nothing, but you remember how to fix a car? How does that work?" The man asked in an amused tone. It was also obvious there was a twinge of desperation there.
He struggled to get up, struggled to sit up on the bed. Tony wanted to get to the source of that feeling. He wanted for his own. It was his. He needed it to survive. He was upright when he heard commotion outside the door. Suddenly the door slam open. He looked up startled. There, in the door way was Steve Rogers. Those blue eyes flashed with desire, needed, want, fear, and there was a deep feral look to them. Tony stared before he just reached out his hand, subconsciously knowing that Steve was his source of peace. His means of sanity and his Perfect Match.
"NO! No, no. It's not bad, it just surprising. You...like Captain America?" He asked, suddenly seeming more shy than before. Tony gave him a grin and a shrug before walking to the check out counter.
In the shower he found his body was riddled with scars and fading bruises. There were old wounds all over his body. But that wasn't what shocked him. It was the thing in his chest that shocked the hell out of him. It emitted a bright blue light. He had touched it tentatively, wondering what it was. He tried to removed it, but fear gripped him. His mind screamed out at him. He let go, allowing the machine to click back into place. It keeps me alive, his mind whispered. He did not understand why that was. Or what it was, but he did not touch it again. He made no plans to show it to anyone either. No, if it was that important, it had to be hidden.
Tony's felt a spear of exhilaration push through him. Wave after wave of positive emotions washed over Tony as Steve's lips mapped out his. Tony returned the soft kiss, tasting his Match. Suddenly, it was like a switch had been flipped because the kiss went from soft and savoring, to passionate and aggressive. The desire to possess and mark hit Tony from both sides. His own desires and Steve's.
He closed his eyes and remembered the dreams/memories that he has been having. He had been in the town for nearly three weeks and they were the one thing he looked forward to the were too vivid and detailed to not be memories. Deep blue eyes looking at him with a deep compassion before they closed as they start to slowly kiss. Each kiss is savored and cherished. They had been going slow, for his sake. Those strong hands wrapped around him, holding him close. He was dwarfed but safe in those arms. In his dreams, he met a man that resembled Zac. Got reacquainted with a man who's features were so similar to Zacs it was scary. Yet this dream man was larger and stronger than Zac. But there was something innocent and shy about him. Jet knew he loved that man. Knew it because when he woke up in the morning he wanted nothing more than to fall asleep and dream of the nameless man.
Zac didn't say anything for the entire time Jet stood there thinking about his chance to get his old life back. Instead the other man just walked out the door, not saying anything. That was the scariest thing of all. Zac always had to have the last word. For him to just walk out the door without saying anything set Jet on edge. It really did. He knew this wasn't over with. He knew that this was just the beginning. Jet sat on the bed and winced a bit at the pain that radiated down from his arm.
"Uh, how can I help you two?" He asked cautiously, shooting them a suspicious look as he walked towards his tool box. He shifted in his jump suit. He did not wear anything else. If only because it made sure to hide the machine in his chest from prying eyes. Only Zac knew of its existence. Even that he regretted. But that one couldn't be helped.
"Rogers, I am sure you are aware that before entering this team, Tony Stark was not accepted as a possible candidate to the program." She paused, giving him time to agree. She was making sure his knowledge covered certain areas.
"I am JARVIS. Agent Lucas informed you of my abilities. However, Mr. Stark had added…extra features to this Television set in order to make your stay more comfortable."
Today Clint was sitting there with a shit eating grin on his face, anxiously awaiting for Steve to ask why it was there. Steve was not going to raise to the bait just yet, he was going to let the man stew for a bit. He was focused on a book that had been given to him. It was standard history book. It was the first thing he asked for. He wanted to catch up on all the things that changed. Since his mind needed something else to focus on, he figured that learning would help. But soon the Archer was practically jumping up and down on the chair. He sighed and closed the book and gave Clint an exasperated look.
"Coulson, get Stark. Rogers is spiraling out of control." The tone was biting and hard. Steve couldn't focus on it long because everything was just becoming greater and greater. His mind struggled to overcome it all. They were on the Helicarrier, so everything made more noise and everything smelt like ozone, gasoline, grease, sweat, life, death and on and on and on. His mind struggle to categorize the sudden in flux of information. He felt like his mind was going to fracturing and splintering off into pieces as it struggled to process everything. He was about to succumb to the madness when he felt something dim the rough edges of everything. It wasn't enough though. There was the sound of cursing someone muttering about being too far away. Quickly the dulling of his senses spread from the edges closer and closer to the core of himself. His mind was still struggling to catch up on everything, but how much was lessen each passing moment. Soon there was nothing. Well not nothing, but all the sensations that came from outside the room vanished. All he could hear was footsteps walking in a quick pace towards the room. Clint let out a sigh, clearly glad to feel the madness abate from Steve's mind. Steve was confused but the answer came from when Tony entered the room. His deep brown eyes were focused on Steve and he couldn't help but blush a bit under the man's intense stare. Everything felt more settled. His mind was no longer going into madness but it was still struggling to rewire all the damage he had caused himself.
He shook his head, trying to clear his head from his own thoughts. He not only had to worry about other people's thoughts but his own. He tapped a few keys on the holoscreen, making a call to his favorite lady.
"Mornin' Cap." The genius said, a saluting with his cup. Steve stared at the other man. It had been a month and a half since their last interaction. They hadn’t even worked together since then. Most times Iron Man, Widow and Hawkeye went out on missions together while Thor, Hulk and himself went out on others. This was the first time he had seen the man in person, not in passing, in a while. Steve had spent a lot of time thinking upon what he had said to Tony and the reactions he got from the other members of his team. Steve walked cautiously into the living area before walking to his door. He found the lock was not broken, but rather skillfully picked. He was not surprised the genius could do such a thing. He crossed his arms and leaned against the door frame of the front door, staring Tony down.
He found that he did not care that Steve was withholding information from him. Anyone else, he knew he would be livid and pushing for more. But with Steve, he had a sense of safety and consideration. Like the man would never intentionally hold sensitive and need-to-know information from him without a reason. Tony rubbed his face against the leather jacket in front of him, enjoying the soft feel of it. He chuckled a bit when he felt Steve's shoulders jump. He could tell the man was tensing a bit, as if not expecting Tony to be this comfortable with him. He noticed that it was getting dark. They had traveled nearly to the Texas boarder. It was getting dark now. They only stopped to get food and stretch their legs, but at night they planned on pulling off for the night at a little inn.
"Not….so much…" A timid voice said from just outside the door. Just outside was Bruce Banner. The timid man hesitated before walking into the room. He paused just inside the door, looking around before settling on Pepper.
Jet shook his head and left his apartment. He stopped in place and let out a frustrated sigh when he noticed that Zac's car was no where to be seen. Obviously the man was still man at him for lying to him. He rubbed the back of his neck, figuring that he could always hitch a ride with the waitress, Vanessa, from the diner. He pulled out his phone and rang her. She was more then happy to help him it seemed, which was a huge relief. He walked down to the ground level, pausing when he noticed two vehicles that he had never seen before. One motorcycle that looked absolutely amazing and one black town car. Both were out of place in ATV world, so it meant that new people were around. While he wanted to conclude that that meant they were Thor's friends, he couldn't assume that. If only because a motorcycle and a town car were not likely to make a drive from outside the state to their town that quickly.
"Look. I made a call to Thor's friends. Some of them want to see for themselves." Jet was about to protest when she held up a hand and gave him a soft smile "Look, Thor's friend was a great man and if you are not him, then we will help you figure out who you are, ok?" Jane asked with a pleading tone. It was clear that the woman cared for Thor a great deal. Jet heart longed from a friend or loved like that. Hell, even family would do. He gave the woman a small smile.
"Wait, how do you know they are after you?" Steve asked, his tone clipped as if he really did not like being kept in the dark about the situation.
"It shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise, since I am the closest to Tony. But, I‘m more here to validate what Mr. Banner and Ms.Romanov  are going to tell you. I must point out that I am disappointed to find that the man who stands for all that is good in America cannot bring himself out of his confusion and anger about his current standing in life in order to avoid lashing out at those that only wish to help." She said, still giving him that small smile. He felt like he was just scolded by his mother. He wanted to hang his head in shame. He folded his hands on his lap and sat straighter in his chair. He looked at Natasha and Bruce who seemed to be having a silent conversation with their eyes. Natasha nodded and looked at Steve. A calculated look crossed her face for a moment before she spoke.
"You have to realize that Tony is Iron Man, in that the suit keeps him safe, helps him help others. But it is also a shield. That is what Tony's image is as well. A shield. Most of Tony's real personality is hidden behind his constant sarcastic and rude personality. The real Tony is a very breakable man. He knows it so he makes himself seem invulnerable to things."
"I do not like hearing about those closest to me having problems that I can fix. To hear you say you don't fit in, is unnerving because it makes me wonder if you will leave one day." Tony said in a muffled tone. Steve pat Tony's shoulders, figuring this came from the fact that Howard had been less than a perfect father and the abandonment issues Tony had. He finally got around to reading Tony's file. It was as enlightening as the conversation with the other Avengers.
"Hey, can you turn it on? I want to hear the engine really quickly." All Zac did was grunt before doing as he was asked. There was smoke almost instantly. Jet cursed before yelling at Zac to turn it off. Jet waved his hand in front of the smoke, frowning. There was really only one thing that could cause this kind of smoke. He raced over to grab a pan. He slid it under the car and drained the oil out of the car. He then went to grab the oil dipper. He swirled it around, gathering what he was looking for before he slowly pulled it out. There, on the other end of the dipper, was what looked like a rag. He tossed it to the ground and refilled the oil tank and slid the dipped back into place. He turned around and grinned at Zac.
"They are looking for their friend Zac. I saw him and their group of friends today, they all agree that I am this strange person. Though I still think they have lost their minds." Jet said with a shrug, making light of the situation in the hopes that it would diffuse some of Zac's jealousy.
After the downfall of Loki and the army that came with him, the Avengers disbanded for a bit. Steve hopped onto the motorcycle that Tony Stark had fixed up for him. He never understood why the man had done it. They were at each other's throats the entire time. The only reason why they worked so well was because when they had to, they worked together for a common cause. But after that, after it was over, they moved out. Tony Stark surprised him by offering the avengers his tower, after it was remodeled of course. When it was clear that Thor was heading out, the assassins were going to another assignment and he needed to get out and see how much the world had changed. So, when he told Fury and the rest of the Avengers that he was going to be setting out the parts unknown, he had not been expecting to see a motorcycle sitting in his designated parking spot two days later. On the motorcycle was a sticky note. It read:
"This is Steve. He is one of Thor's friends. He seems to think I am their missing friend. Which not one of these people have told me the person's name yet." Jet suddenly realized that no one had let him know what his real name was. Why was that? He tilted his head to one side as he waited for Steve to tell him the reason why that was or for him to tell the name.
Fear spiked through his mind. For some reason, his mind was making connection to this subject name. Was that his name? It did not matter. He needed to be free. He moved, feeling nothing restraining him. But his body felt like lead. It didn't matter. Adrenaline pumped through his veins. He stumbled to stand up, fumbling around in the darkness. He hit the wall with a thick thunk. He leaned heavily on it. His body was mostly numb. He could feel his feet and his fingers. That was about it. His mind felt like it was trapped in a strange fog
"Tony!" Steve said, reaching out to grab the man's arm to prevent him from continuing his tirade. Out of all the Avengers, Natasha was likely the most deadly in a situation like this. Yet, it was Natasha who held up a hand, indicating to let Tony do what he was going to do.
"Whatever you say, Cap" Tony said before he paused. He stared at Steve for a moment before he looked down at his sweater then back at Steve.
"Yeah, sorry was in the shower. Come on in. I just need to put the jumper then we can head out." He said in a calm voice, not wanting to get Zac riled up this early in the morning. The man obviously was lacking a coffee maker. He paused in zipping up his jumper, realizing he could make one if he found spare parts. It wouldn't be too hard. He finished up by yanking on his plain sneakers before walking out. He paused when he saw how casually Zac was leaning against the wall. Something struck Jet for a moment. The man seemed so familiar. Jet felt his temperature rise when he noticed that Zac's eyes were slowly moving over his body.
Steve crossed the room like a man possessed. That larger hand grasped Tony's more nimble one. The feeling of completion and perfection filled them before they both felt something snap into place. A bright blue light filled the room, the compound and lit up the sky. The strength of the bond snapping into place was enough to knock the Bond Pair out. They collapsed on the bed, knocked into a deep sleep. Their hands remained tightly clasped, neither willing to let go even in their sleep.
"Come now, Capsicle. Surely you don't think I or even Natasha would allow anyone but you to reveal your secret identity, do you? After quite a bit of money and some….words with Natasha the story seemed to have vanished." He said with a grin. Tony pulled back, this time Steve let him, and patted him on his arms again.
He felt his head pound a bit, small pieces of his memory returning in those moments. It was as if by being home again was bringing it all to the forefront of his mind. He would have to accelerate this recovery later on. He figure that if he was getting a minor headache from this, accelerating the process would cause a debilitating migraine. Something he wasn't afraid of if that meant that it sped up his recovery. He desperately wanted to be back to remembering them. If he could isolate his memories so that he would only remember all the memories associated with The Avengers, he would. He didn't want to remember all the damage he caused. All those stories he looked up in his mind were not promising. He never wanted to be that man again.
The man was only wearing lounge pants. His head was in someone's lap. That is not what made it so intimate. What was intimate was the fact there, in the middle of the man's chest, the only color in the entire picture, was the machine that was in Jet's chest as well. A large hand was resting just beneath it and only a thumb was over it. He could almost feel that thumb stroking over the machine. He touched his chest, right where it was. He looked up at Steve for a moment. The man gave him a heart felt smile. Jet felt his heart race as Steve reached out, pausing for a moment before that large hand came to rest over the arc reactor. There was no fumbling around to find it. The hand just laid exactly on top of it. The familiarity of that touch sent tears sliding down Jet's cheek. Jet grabbed Steve's hand and pressed it harder to the machine in his chest, desperate to over come the feeling that was gripping him.
"Of course Sir." Then like that sound returned. Only this time it was the regular sounds. The people next door moving around, some car sounds, but not everything. He felt a grin bloom on his face. Oh yes, he could deal with this. He walked back into the living room after removing his jacket. He sat back down on the couch and looked at the screen.
"You’re nothing but a bully Stark. And on top of that you’re a disappointment to everything your father was" Steve said in turn. Something fluttered across Stark's face before that cocky smirk appeared on his lips. He watched as Stark just saunter off and mentally cursed. He couldn't believe that once again he was getting into it with Stark. It was like the first time they met all over again. He pushed his hand through his hair and turned around only to stop in his tracks. There stood Natasha and Bruce. Banner's eyes and skin had a light green color to them. Steve stood a little straighter, unsure as to what was bothering the Doctor. Natasha reached out and grabbed Bruce's arm, squeezing it.
"Nice meeting you Zac. Sorry I was trying to remember something. I kinda have amnesia. I remember by name and how to fix cars, but that is about it." He said in an apologetic tone. This man was drawing him in. Did he know him? Did they have a relationship? His heart felt like it was fluttering in his chest. There was definitely something about this man. Yet his mind was reminding him that the blue was all wrong. He didn't care at this point. He liked how familiar the man seemed. Yet he was still a stranger. Still someone he did not know. There was still that strange sense of uneasiness.
"Yes. I have noticed that he is a rather tactile person. What does that have to do with anything?" Steve asked, obviously confused as to the point of all this. Tony didn’t even like him. Hell he even smacked the man's hand off of him, which seemed to piss the other man off. He remembered that was when they went after each other the first time.
"Then I will listen no matter what. You….used to tell me all your dreams. It helped you sleep again." Steve said in a soft voice, as if he was a little upset about not knowing. Did he have bad dreams? Tony wondered. Tony looked away for a moment.
He remained sitting on the floor, wallowing in how empty everything felt. It was like Tony came it and stole what little sense of home the apartment had, leaving him with nothing. Again.
"What are you doing here, Stark?" He asked in a serious tone. Tony was doing something with his phone before he looked up and took another sip off his coffee. He moved his arm in a sweeping motion about the room.
"Just make it look like it is yours and you have a question, he will 'steal' your food for the answer." Bruce said, clearly seeing through Steve's plan. He scratched the back of his neck, not believing he had been that transparent. Then again the man was a Genius. He nodded and picked up the water bottles, heading to Tony's workshop. He walked down the workshop, the door automatically opened and the blaring music cut off.
"Hey guys." He said awkwardly. Tony jerked upright and looked at Steve before he muttered something about needing to get some work done. The man walked quickly towards a door that probably led to a workshop. Steve watched the man retreat. The lights came on and he found himself under the scrutiny of the other Avengers. He swallowed thickly when Natasha and Bruce shared a look. It was obvious that they knew what had transpired between him and Tony just the other day. Natasha effortlessly jumped over the back of the couch and walked to him, a dark glint in her eyes. She stood before him.
Jet jerked awake only to feel a hand settle on top of the machine in his chest. He reactor before he could think. He jerked away only to be shoved to the floor roughly by those hands.
"So, that went well...don't you think?" Jet said hesitantly. He wasn't sure about their relationship. He was sure about his relationship with Pepper. They were once lovers, but now they were the best of friends. The woman basically ran his life for many days. But him and Steve. That was still a mystery he wanted to solve. He suddenly felt fear. He had been dating Zac for a while now. Had he been cheating? He felt sick to his stomach. He hadn't known. Oh god, what is Steve wanted to end things? What if he hated him from moving on? His mind was spinning with all his thoughts before a hand reached out and grabbed his. Jet's head shot up and stared at Steve. Steve's blue eyes were strong and firm, serious almost.
The city was beating down on him. He felt maybe ten precent less then without Coulson there. He was beginning to feel less and less as they raced out of the city and headed into the middle of no where. The only place he was safe from everything was 100 miles out of the city and well away from any large population of people. The middle of the no where. That is where he would end up spending the rest of his days. Certainly there was no certain fate then his. He had tried to find a Sentinel that would be able to give him something, anything of a regular life. They had all failed. So he was going to a compound where he would have to remain for likely the rest of his life, except in the case of when he was in his suit. He still couldn't figure out how the suit blocked out everything, but it did. So he would not have to give up his hero duties.
"Why are you lying? My machines killed hundreds of people. Merchant of Death, remember?" Steve hid his face in his hand, letting out a frustrated sound. That had been the reason why they did not want to tell Tony his last name. They hadn't wanted him to get the wrong kind of impression of what kind of person he was. All the Tabloids, Newspapers and Articles painted Tony more as an evil heartless man instead of the hero he was truly.
"Tell you…what? You can ask me anything you want…but sometimes I will want you to trust me that somethings are better left unknown for a while." Steve said in an equally soft tone. Jet relaxed a bit, understanding that the man was trying to protect him from something. He licked his bottom lip for a moment, contemplating if Steve would answer the question he wanted.
"Okay, say I go along with all the things you are saying. What do you want me to do? Huh? So I have...misunderstood and misjudged Tony since the beginning. But that doesn't help me any when it comes to dealing with him." He said in a tired voice. He wasn't understanding what they wanted him to do. Sure, he could lay off of Tony. Hell the man deserved an apology from him, but he felt like they were asking more from him then just that.
He threw it or thought he did. There was no sound of it hitting the wall. He looked and realized he didn't have it in his hand to throw it. He whirled around when he heard a tutting sound behind him. There stood Tony, wearing his typical AC-DC shirt and plain jeans. In his hand was Steve's phone. Steve stared at the man, mouth a gaped. How had Tony done that? Took the phone from him without him knowing. Tony gave him a small grin.
Steve's hand shot out and smacked the coffee out of Tony's hand. For a moment it felt good to destroy something. There was a twist in his heart at hearing that his lease was up - yeah right, Fury pulled string on that one. The control over his life was being taken from him. He was being stripped of his autonomy to move freely, to build a life for himself. And Tony, of all people, Tony being the one to deliver the news was too much. The man was loud, talked too much, moved too fast, it was all too much. Tony Stark, maker of the 21st century, standing in the one place Steve tried to carve out as his own, telling him that Steve had to move into the tower. This was the last straw. He had been at the end of his rope before this, with the Nightmares, the constant influx of new information and strange scenery. He was constantly reminded how alone and out of place he was. Tony was only mad it worst. He stood to his full height towering over the man, all while a piece of him screamed that he was lashing out. That this was wrong, but Tony was convenient, Tony was an intruder, Tony
"He was spiraling down too fast and, it must be the serum, but his signal is strong enough to make it difficult without it also be erratic and chaotic. So I have to becloser in order to have my powers work the strongest. And no, to answer that thought, I do not want him to spiral off into oblivion. If he did, we would have one hell of a problem on our hands. With his tactical knowledge, strength, speed and abilities, he would be a force to be reckoned with should he fall into the Oblivion state. Now leave Barton, your thoughts and feelings are driving me mad." Tony said in a dismissive tone, clearly busy with his own work. Clint did not seem bother by Tony's abrupt tone.
In the background of this attack he could hear a high pitch whine. Was he under attack? No that couldn't be it because it set in when no one was around. The whine continue until he could hear words.
"It was a memory…?" Tony asked softly, his eyes opening. Steve's blue eyes were ablaze with desire. Tony couldn't say anything. The words were choked down by the strength of Steve's gaze.
Steve was reeling. He had a chance to at least be some what normal? That was a great idea. He desperately wanted something like that. While he was getting used to the world around him, he could use a way to go into it without being over loaded with information. He stood up and grabbed his leather jacket, determined to go out and find a pair of theses cuffs.
"I want to go home" He sobbed. He didn't know why he said that. He didn't know where home was or if it ever was with this man. But he wanted to be back where he felt safe. This town had offered him the chance to construct an illusion of normalcy. But now it was crumbling around him as the truly normal people of his life came to surround him. A large hand ran down his back, soothing him. He shifted deeper into those arms, hiding away.
"Huh…So that is why you laughed. Like me wearing you symbol, Cap?" Tony said with a devilish grin. Steve just walked to Tony as clasped his shoulder before leaning down and whispering in his ear.
"Mr. Snow. I am sure you are wondering why we are here this early in the morning." Natasha said in a cool tone. Jet looked at her before pointing a finger at her.
It wasn't enough. Some of the bond pairs were separating. Soon fear and uncertainty was all around him. Multiple set thoughts about a stranger moving quickly towards the compound, a threat and a feral state were beating down around him. He let out a cry of pain before there was….nothing. Nothing but a strong pulse of electricity running down him. He let out a gasp as his eyes snapped open. He felt a pull deep in his stomach. But his body was to weak to answer it. The spiral had taken his strength from him. But he wanted that pull. The silence that descended upon him was unlike anything he had ever felt before. There was no thoughts or feelings save his own. There was nothing but a powerful sense of peace. There was something else, but it was being blocked from him.
"Mostly, you would get them out. You were bad at eating and sleeping because of it. You would work for days on end. It was aggravating." Steve said in a playfully exasperated tone. Jet laughed a bit, finding it amusing that even now Steve was exasperated with his habits. He did tend to skip meals but the not sleeping thing changed. He liked to sleep now. Because he got to dream about Steve, got to dream about all the things they did together.
"It's fine. I mean I bet I wasn't the nicest person either without my coffee." He said, trying to ease the man's anxiety. He did not know why it mattered so much, but he wanted this man to like him. It hurt to think he did not like Jet. It hurt really bad, but at times his mind kept telling him over and over again the voice and eyes were wrong. All wrong. WRONG! But Jet ignored it. He was alone and he desperately wanted someone that triggered the sense of joy that Zac did. He knew that was a bad thing, but he couldn't help it at all.
"Tony...Jet. Are you...ok?" That voice asked, fear and anger barely hidden in the tone. Jet knew he was shaking, but he shifted and moved deeper into those arms.
"So, you going to spend the rest of your lunch break checking out the place or what? I mean… I could help you, show you all the spots I like to go to." Zac asked, making it seem like he wanted to help Jet. His heart raced a little bit faster at the idea of spending more time with the gorgeous blond in front of him. He nodded with a small smile.
Steve was beyond grateful to Tony for installing JARVIS into his phone. While the other Avengers were jealous, given that Tony was very possessive over who had access to JARVIS, Steve felt special being one of the only people who had JARVIS installed on his cellphone. It also gave him a greater sense of relief. If he did not understand something someone said, reference or some bit of technology, he would tap the screen of his phone, saving the reference for later that night. Each night he would ask JARVIS to help him understand the things on his list. It was a miracle. However, he only did this for common people and never anything Tony or Bruce talked about. Or at least nothing that sounded to complex. Each day he found himself getting better and better at acclimating to the world around him.
Time passed slowly it seemed. It was like he was making no progress at all. The desert around him was making his anxiety spike to abnormal degrees. He did not know why. He figured it was his mind recalling something yet not letting him in on what it was. As he walked, he started to notice a light up ahead. He knew he had not walked the entire distance to the town yet, so he continued more cautiously. As he came upon the source of the light he found that it was a broken down car. The hood was propped open and the sounds of cursing came from beneath the hood.
Yes, if it meant finding the man that was the main person of his dreams. He wanted that person back in his life. He wanted to feel safe again and he knew he would never feel completely like that until that person was back in his life. The man he was using Zac to replace. He stood up as the sun finally set. He walked back to his apartment, hoping that Zac was not there. He just wanted to sleep the night away. To fall into the nameless man's arms in his dreams.
"Nervous nelly is he?" Tony quipped without much though before he followed after Clint, who was already heading inside. Natasha walked in step with him, as if she needed to be close to him for some reason. Reasons he has yet to remember.
"Try to watch him more than actually listening to him. Or better yet, think of him as a hostage that can not come right out and say he needs help." Pepper said in a cool tone, still working on the tablet. Natasha nodded slowly before continuing with that.
"I can help with that Steve. I can upload a version of JARVIS into your phone so all you have to do is give it voice commands and it will do what you want it to. I can even make it so that if you have any question, JARVIS can answer it for you. You don't have to try and figure everything out for yourself Steve. I can help you. You know that out of everyone in the world, I know how to help you." Tony was still cocky, but there was an undertone of pleading. It was strange, but ever since that conversation, he felt like he could almost hear what Tony wasn't saying. In this case it was almost like he was scared of something. There was bit of fear in Tony's eyes when he pulled away again. Steve tilted his head to one side before asking in a soft tone.
"Are you guys ever going to tell me?" Jet asked in a soft pleading tone. He wanted to know. Steve looked at him confused for a moment before he tapped his fingers on the top of the table.
When they arrived at the compound, Tony felt even better because of the number of sentinels and bonded pairs that were there. The Society of Enhanced Humans had set up this compound right after he declared that he would not be able to find a sentinel. It was set up in a way that the bonded pairs orbited each other and the unbound sentinels shielded him at much as they could. Since any sentinel had to be of a higher caliber to even be assigned to the compound, the combined effort worked well.
Steve stood there as the urge to punch something over came him. It took all of his control not to put a hole in the wall. Instead he looked down at the spilled coffee with a snarl. Then his control snapped. Grabbing the couch he flipped it, tossed the table with it, pushing the chairs over, knocking book down until he collapsed to the floor. Hands gripped his hair tightly as he ground his teeth together. He snapped at Tony when the man went out of his way to tell him what was going on. Instead of an Agent coming by to give him his orders, Tony had come himself to tell him. Another familiar face. More kid's gloves. He gripped tighter, feeling the hair follicle scream in protest. He felt stuck in an storm raged ocean, struggling to keep his head afloat. But every time he got his baring it felt like someone, Tony, was shoving him back under.
The strangest thing he figured out about himself was that he could gain information about a lot of things. He some how was able to do it by thinking of something really specific. Then his mind would come online, like a computer and the information would fly across his eyes. He then would return to normal after the request was fulfilled. He had no idea what it was or how he could do it. But it was so helpful, especially when a person had to survive in the desert. His brain told him he was located in New Mexico and five miles to his left was a road that would take him to the nearest town, which was 30 miles away.
"I have seen this kind of thing before, but I can't exactly place it. There was a project much like this one in progress about the same time as my own. They wanted to recreated the Super Soldier Serum using technology. A project, I am sure, you would have loved" Bruce commented in a humorless tone. It was clear that either that project had been used on him or someone else had gotten a hold of that information and used it on him. What better person to test the system on the a person who basically constructed the world's greatest technological advances every day? Who knew programming and engineering better then Tony Stark? No one.
"Uh….Excuse me?" He said softly, edging around the car, making sure to keep a safe distance just in case it was one of his captors. The darker man cursed colorfully before jumping back, holding his wretch like a weapon. The man stared at him for a while before he let the wretch fall a bit.
"Are any of these Tony's favorite kind of chips? They all look like the others' favorite flavors." He asked, trying to smoothly ask for the information he need. There was a long pause. He looked over his shoulder, finding Bruce giving him a calculated look before a small smile adorned the weathered doctor's face. Bruce pointed to a bag of kettle cooked chips with cracked pepper. He felt a blush creep over his neck as he pulled the chips down and poured some on top of the plate. He heard the fridge close behind him. Bruce set down two large water bottles before him
"Stop struggling or I will tear it out." Tony froze at this threat. He turned his face deeper into the pillow, gritting his teeth together before he heard the sound of wood giving. Pain shot up his arm as Zac' weight was ripped off his back.
"Well, I don't mind eccentric. I think that I was an eccentric person as well." He said with a laugh. Jane gave him a heart felt smile before patting his arm and leaving. He watched her leave, feeling a little better about everything. He stood there for a moment, letting the sky darken around him. He laid on the outskirts of town, underneath the canopy of a little shop that was there. Hours passed without him even acknowledging them. He just lost himself in the thoughts that came forward. The feeling of doubt and insecurity prominent. He wanted to be found. He wanted someone to claim him as their own. Whether it be their friend, family, enemy, lover or really anything. He wanted to know who he was so that he could start working on finding the man who made him feel completely safe. But there was the danger that Thor and Jane were a part of the group that had...tortured him. The people he had escaped from. Was he willing to risk it? Was he willing to risk being captured for the chance of being found?
What he saw when they walked in was astounding. There was a glow of a deep purple wave the seemed to completely encompass them. He stared at them, jotting down notes as he did. He paused and took a large drink off his scotch before waving his hand at them.
He felt sweat roll down the back of his neck as he stood in the middle of the disaster of an area. He couldn't believe that they were at the cusp of the end. He knew it was the end. He was a genius after all. He could see the writing on the wall while everyone else was still holding on to the hope that things would get better. That they would pull out of this one. He knew they wouldn't be. He could tell that Black Widow was at the end of her rope. Blood coated her side and she was trying to hide the fact she had a limp now. Hawkeye was struggling to find arrows he had used to kill the bots and fighting to stay alive. The Hulk was wavering, shrinking while he still fought. Thor was bleeding and panting, swing Mjolnir a little slower. Not that anyone else could see this all like he did in one sweeping moment. Steve seemed to not be slowing down. But this could not be done by one soldier alone. No, he would not be able to stop Dr. Doom and that horrible device that the man was struggling to start up.
It seemed that out of no where, a massive jet appeared and landed near the fallen men. Out came the red headed woman, Natasha, and her buddy, Clint. They were dressed like…soldiers. No, actually they were dressed very much like…. Tony tensed up for a moment, his mind clicking all the information into place. They were dressed like Black Widow and Hawkeye from the Avengers. Which meant that if he was their friend and his first name was Tony….His eyes went wide as he felt a little dizzy.
"While the issue of foresight was never addressed, the dulling of a Sentinel's extreme intake of sensations has been done." Steve blinked as this before lacing his fingers together and leaning his elbows on his knees.
"You know, Lisa just moved in here, but her lease at her apartment isn't up for another three months. Also, my friend just opened a car shop just down the way. He was looking for another mechanic. He has one but he says he needs another to help when they have the rush of people that come in with serious issue from riding out in the dunes." Harold said. Jet nodded, making it look like he was considering it. He ate slowly, but efficiently. His mouth was never without something in it. Whether it was lemonade or food. He paused only to speak.
"It is top secret. I am making something that will revolutionize the world! Well that is needless to say. Everything I make revolutionizes the world." Tony said, shifting on his feet as if debating on what he should do next. He looked at the water bottle and then looked to the door. Steve hummed.
"You didn't come to work today. On top of that, this guy comes asking about the stuff you worked on. Then I find out you spent the entire day with that blond guy" The man snarled, pushing him deeper into the bed. He didn't understand why the man was so angry at him.
Tony reached into his pocket and pressed a button. It was a button that Pepper had forced him to install in his personal phone after the terrorists had kidnapped him. It sent a signal to JARVIS which in turn would send an alert to SHEILD. Tony gripped the chair in front of him, ignoring the rest of the room. He felt his stomach revolt as the man brushed passed him. That evil, dark, sickening aura coated over his skin, marking him almost. He felt bile rise up his throat. His phone went off. He picked up.
"All you have to do is say the word. All you have to do is say it and it will all be over." The whispered words sent pleasure coursing through his veins. It also sent chills down his spine. There was a darkness and a hatred there. He licked his lips uneasily. That tone, he couldn't believe he was hearing it from those lips. Yet, Jet wanted nothing more then to kiss that mouth. The mouth that haunted his dream. But before he could complete that thought, Steve pulled back. It completely escaped his mind that the Steve never answered the question. The man stepped out of his space and gave a fleeting smile for a moment, as if he hadn't just implied murder.
But as he flipped through pictures of the woman's home, which was wall to wall Captain America things, and read the three page article she wrote about him he realized just how little he knew about this time. It served to remind him, once again, he was out of his element. He stopped seeing her. Yet, he knew that she had already sold the story to the highest bidder. His secret identity was gone. His freedom and ability to just be Steve Rogers was gone. He move his arm back to slam the phone into the wall.
"Hey, your car is ready Dr. Foster." Jet said as he walked into the office. Dr. Foster looked from Zac to Jet. The look on her face set Jet on edge. There was something akin to horror there. She looked as though she had seen a ghost. Jet looked at Zac and shrugged, offering Dr. Foster the keys. Dr. Foster stared before she started to speak...well scream.
MSG:He is fine. I just need to know if Natasha put those goggles in the places I asked her too. We need to find Cap a match
"I think...I've done this before...rested with coffee as you sketched." The words slipped out from behind the haze of contentment. Steve paused in his sketching, not looking up from his work before whispering back softy.
"I don't tell you everything. Figured you don't to want to be around me when I am being pathetic." Jet snapped before he stormed out of the garage. He told Marco he was taking the rest of the day off. The man did not seem to care since there were no more jobs to be done. He continued to walk quickly, ignoring the sound of shoes following him.
"Break what?" He asked, uncertain he wanted to know. but he had to know. He had to know what was going on. This was not the place where he went off to war. This was not the city he knew.
"I got a razor you can borrow, since it looks like you brought nothing with you. And an extra tooth brush as well." Zac said, stuffing his hands into his pockets. Jet gave him a polite smile.
"Exactly like this?" Steve asked, keeping his hands on the bed. Tony shook his head before he tentatively spoke.
"T-Mr. Snow, I am Virginia Potts. I...well I was close to our friend for many years. Steve here confirmed that you are him but... May ask you to show me...your chest. My friend had a serious injury he fixed himself with a machine. The only reason why I ask this of you is because you look just like him...when he was in his twenties. I...just want to be sure." She said in a sorrow filled tone. He could tell she was haunted by whatever happened, yet there was a sense of resignation there, as if this was repeated often. He looked between the three before he looked at the door. He sighed and tugged off the sweater he always wore to bed. There in the middle of his chest was blue light among the red marks from the carpet. He noticed that Natasha's eyes sharpened a fraction before she looked at Steve. They shared a look before Pepper let out a soft sob. The red head's hand instantly went to the blond's. Jet didn't know why, but that action made him smile. Made him feel happy.
His thigh started to shake. It was getting harder to stand up like that. Eventually he collapsed off to one side, gripping the sheets tightly before pushing up and back. Steve turned his body smirking. Tony was half laying on the bed while his knees were still on either side of his hips. It offered Steve a better angle. Steve began to move his fingers faster, remembering just how Tony liked it. Those fingers hit Tony's prostate each time. It was like a machine gun sending bullets of pleasure through Tony. Tony was panting into the bed, pushing back into Steve, who was opening him up.
"That is true. Tony discovered that each Sentinel has a signature...aura of sorts. Their perfect match has the exact opposite aura. They counter act each other. But if there is not Perfect Match to be found, and you feel like you can not wait, we can culminate a list of near perfect matches for you to look over. Our goal is to help Sentinels and Guides have a better life. Especially a Sentinel of your caliber." She explain with a pleased tone. It was clear that she was proud of this project. It may have been Tony's gadget and find, but it was Pepper's project. She looked over to the door and gave a fond smile. Steve looked over to see Natasha materialize for a moment only to vanish as Coulson walked by the door way. He chuckled a bit. It was clear that both of them were checking in on their matches. It was kinda nice to know that soon he may have that himself. He looked back at Pepper.
"If only I could have the luxury of turning it off or having a Sentinel. But sadly, I don't." He quipped before he looked over his shoulder. He could hear their thoughts as they walked into the building. Well Pepper's thoughts, Natasha's thoughts were mostly silent. He looked down at the goggles and then spoke again.
Steve was a bit taken back by this. This was too much. Already Tony had provided him with JARVIS, the TV and the Shielding Cuffs, now he was providing him with a motorcycle? He did not understand why the man who treated him with nothing but disdain would do all these things for him. Keeping in mind a majority of those things happened before Tony Stark knew him as a still, they could not get a long. He did not even bother to thank the man for the cuffs, which he wore all the time now. He never took them off for any reason. He was glad to be able to live his life as a regular person. Even before the serum, he had had issues with his senses. They would fluctuate in and out. No doctor had been able to explain it. But that did not matter now. Now he had the chance to be a regular person. He was going to take advantage of it.
"I can't figure out what it wrong with it. I looked it over twice. Nothing seems to be wrong with it." Those words were laced with so much anger it was hard to imagine what the true issue was. Jet looked intrigued. He liked things that were complicated. He gave Zac a look and the man just waved him over to the car. Jet flashed him a boyish grin before walking over to car. Jet could practically feel Zac at his back. He ignored it in favor of getting into the car. He, too found nothing wrong with the car.
"My powers are amped some reason today. Come in holding hands please." With that he hung up, knowing very well that Pepper would do as he asked. It was not like this had anything to do with a company problem or the like. He reached under the table and pulled out a glass and a bottle of scotch. He poured himself a generous amount as Pepper's and Natasha's emotional signatures came his way. They suddenly dulled and thankfully went silent. He pulled the goggles on and turned to look at the door.
In the 21st century, Steve was an outsider. He knew that well. No Friends, No Family, and No Allies. While he had the Avengers, it became clear rather quickly that he wasn't welcomed there either.  Bruce and Stark were Science-Bro, a term coined by Barton, that could talk for hours in a language that sometimes didn't sound like English. Clint and Natasha were attached to each other's hips. When Thor wasn't in Asgard, he was with Jane. So who did he have? No one, that’s who. In order to avoid the blaring reality he was forced to face, he jumped on his motorcycle the moment Loki was off the planet and just drove off towards nowhere.
"Out of everyone, Tony knows what it is like to be an outsider. While he walks into a room and everyone knows him, they all want something from him. He is a genius, rivaled by few. He struggles to make friends, because most people do not understand 'Tony Speak'. Just like you. You enter a room, and everyone gives you attention but they want something from you. And hardly anyone understand you because you come from a totally different era. That is why Tony wants to help you, because he knows how to be in this era. He knows how to get you acclimated to the world without losing yourself in the chaos. Or worst, losing yourself to someone who just wants to use you. Things are different in this time, and only Tony is truly versed in how to handle this world." Bruce said, saying that last part almost sheepishly as if ashamed that he did not know the world as well as Tony did. It made sense, since Bruce dropped out of common society for the safety of everyone. Steve let out a frustrated groan and shoved his hand into his hair, resting his elbows on the table. All this was a bit too much. He slammed his hand done on the table in frustration. He heard the metal give a bit. He winced and let out an apologetic sigh.
"I can't get my phone to work, you and everyone else can do it effortlessly. I ended up dating a stalker, which you warned me about. The press seems out to get me, yet you handle it with ease. I don't fit in... anywhere." He muttered against Tony's shoulder. He did not want to let go for some reason. Tony patted his lower back before moving back a little bit and stared up at Steve.
"I am sorry about my friend. He lost his friend recently." She said in a slightly winded voice. Jet gave a soft sigh, looking away. He almost wished that Thor was right about knowing him. He could use a friend like that.
"Yeah, I am good with fixing things. Anything I get my hands on, I can fix." He said with a shrug. That was not so much a lie. He knew instinctively that it was true. Even if he did not know how to do it, he had that thing in his mind that would allow him to figure things out rather quickly. He took a sip of the lemonade.
"Good Morning." She looked at her watch, which he noticed was not a version he had ever seen before. "Or should I say afternoon." Her hands clasped in front of her. Military like. Not like any of the of the nurses he had ever seen before. He gave her a strange look. He spoke and noticed his voice was raspy. The wind from the window caused a sense of nausea to over come as it triggered the sense of freezing sensation that went deep into his bones.
"Good Morning, Captain Rogers. I am glad that you could make it." She said in a soft, pleasing voice.
"He's not going to make it!" A monotonous male voice said, piercing through his screaming that was echoing off the walls.
"This is my sandwich Tony. I came down here to see what you working on. I know you get into Genius mode. I figured you could at least satisfy part of my curiosity." He said in an even tone, picking up another chip and eating it loudly. He watched Tony twitch. It was clear that hunger was making itself known now that Tony saw food.
"All I ask in return is that the first person you do this for is Captain America. Steve is on the verge of breaking down. He was already there when he came out of the ice. Now he is even closer to insanity after using those cuffs for as long as he did. He needs a Bond Mate. He needs to have a perfect match. I was unable to upload his aura into the system, so you will have to go to him for it. But that is all I ask." Tony said in a sincere tone. Pep's eyes softened as she stepped to him and kissed his cheek. She pulled back and smiled before she brought the tablet up and clicked a button. Tony tensed as she took a sample of his aura. She gave him a small smile.
"This will take a moment. I have to ask, do you have a preference of gender?" She asked, preparing to find him a nearly perfect match if the program could not find a perfect match for Steve.
"Right or left shoulder?" Steve said in a serious tone, but there was something else there. Something else. Tony licked his bottom lip a bit before answering.
"Ah! Jet of the Snow. Come, join us. I wish for you to meet two people." Thor said in a booming voice. Jet paused, looking around the diner. Jet eyed him wearily before walking to Jane. He kept his eyes on her, not wanting to see the looks of disappointment that could come from the two blonds. He stopped in front of the table.
"Good Morning Ma'am. I wasn’t expecting you to be a part of this." He said in an awkward tone. He really hadn’t. He figured this would be just a team meeting. Not the very meeting Natasha had threatened him with prior.
"I am not scared. I am just trying to help." Tony said, pushing back against Steve's chest. Steve pulled back, making Tony's elbows collapse into his chest.
Jet shook his head, ending the feed. He did not know how he could do it, but it may have to do with his amnesia, as well as why he looked so much younger then his mind wanted to make him. He brushed his teeth and took a pair of scissors and cut off some of his hair. His hair now fell in small waves around his face, but was off his shoulders. He looked young and dashing. He was a little surprised by that. The most surprising thing he had come to realized about himself came when he was in the shower.
He walked out of the elevator and finding the floor to be dark save for the T.V screen. Something with dwarves and elves was flashing across the screen. But that is not what caught his attention. What caught his attention was the fact Tony was laying on the couch, his head pillowed on Bruce's lap and with his legs thrown over Natasha's lap. He watched as Bruce ran his fingers through Tony's hair as Natasha tapped her thumb on the Genius' legs. His heart ached as the intimate scene, yet it also made him uncomfortable. Was this what relationship were like now? Three people at once? He sneered in disgust at the idea. He figured it must have been Tony’s idea. He stepped forwards, intent on making a comment about how much of a playboy Tony was, when a hand came to clasp his shoulder tightly. He looked to find Clint staring at him with a smirk.
"Stark figured out the science behind Match Pairs and created a pair of goggles that can read the signature of Sentinels and Guides. He launched this program with the backing of the Society of Enhanced Humans to help Sentinels and Guides find their Perfect Match or near perfect matches. Pepper Potts, Tony's Personal Assistant, is spear heading the program. Guess who they are matching first?" Clint said with a wide grin. Steve was still reeling at the possibilities. To be able to have help finding a person's Perfect Match, the equivalent to a soul mate, was something he could not wrap his mind around. He stared at Clint with his mouth a gaped. Surely the man couldn't mean...him? No, that would be beyond generous of Tony. No, it had to be someone else. A Perfect Match was the one person who could make the sensation dim. The one person who could make life easier. It was a dream for every Sentinel and Guide to find that person. That soul mate that would make life better.
Everyone in SHEILD knew that Tony was an ass, but he was an ass for a reason. He was the strongest Mentalist ever record in history, which also meant he was the closest to insanity and self-destruction then the rest of the world. The man courted death and agony like he courted a willing woman. Tony did not like people in general because their thoughts and feeling constantly bombarded him. He knew the darkness in a man's heart and the selfish thoughts that were always on a person's mind. The only reason he could stand being on the Helicarrier was because most of the agents were paired off. Not all were perfect matches, but a majority of them had strong bonds. It helped keep the operatives ground and rooted. It also kept their mental waves down to near nothing when they were around each other.
"This is your place to stay till you are ready to be re-instated into a new division. The screen responds to your voice. Your Friend's Son, Howard Stark's son Tony allowed for a piece of his J.A.R.V.I.S program to help you with information on the last 70 years. Just speak and he will show you whatever you want. Try and pace yourself Captain Rogers." The man said before he was left alone, with nothing but a standard military issue clothes as well as jeans and shirt. All courtesy of SHEILD. He was alone in a room but the sounds of the outside world still beat on him,
"Steve Rogers" He said with soft tone as he sat down in the other empty chair fiddling with the book, sketch book to be exact, nervously. Steve gave him a boyish smile before motioning towards the food.
He walked out of the Helicarrier, ignoring the starttled cries that came from some of the newer members of SHEILD. He felt an impossible amount of joy as he free fell through the sky. He tapped the bracelets on his wrists, summoing his Iron Man suit. He felt so free falling without anything to protect him. It was similar to the life he lead.. He was always falling wihtout something to catch him, always swimming in unwanted thoughts and feelings. He knew that one day either he would fall to his death or someone would make it so that his thoughts and those of his Bond Mate were the only ones he could hear. The suit wrapped around him and soon he was landing safely on the top of the newly remodled Stark Tower.
Steve was temporarily blinded by the flash of blue before he felt exhausted. He knew he was going to black out from this. He struggled to remain conscious, if only to make sure when he blacked out he didn't smother his Match. He fell beside the unconscious Tony, pulling the man into his arms with their hands still clasped.
They opted to get a room with two beds, that avoid awkwardness. Plus, Tony still wasn't sure the type of relationship they had. After all, he had not got the chance to ask just yet. He laid in the motel bed, watching Steve as he laid in the bed just across the way. The other man was no longer a dream. No longer something he wished he knew. Steve was there in the flesh and blood. Breathing deeply and rhythmically that was typical of sleep. Tony closed his eyes and focused on the sound of Steve's breathing to lull him off to sleep.
"I am so sorry Pep. I didn't mean to do this to you again." He whispered against her hair. She stiffened and held him tighter before pulling away and looking at him in a strange manner.
He just had to finish working on the program and user interfacing system to make it easier for Pepper to handle. The Society had said that they were willing to help Pepper with her work, if she agreed to do it, by doing more mixers to gather more data. Then they would move it internationally. Tony focused everything he had on getting the programming just right. It was when he was working on something that he could, for that moment, disconnect from the world around him and just focus on something else. He was nearly finished with his work when he was suddenly assaulted amusement and mental snickering. He jerked up right to find Pepper and Natasha standing in his lab, smiling like mischievous children. Tony scowled at them
He had Tony to thank for that. To risk Steve's cellphone falling into the wrong hands and one of his competitors getting a hold of JARVIS in order to help the out of time soldier get accustom to things was extremely selfless. So in order to repay Tony, Steve made sure the genius ate and slept some what regularly. He helped curb the manic episodes Tony seemed to get into when something did not work the way he wanted them to or when he got a complex idea all of a sudden. While Tony was seemingly unaware of it, Ms. Potts and the team seemed to be glad for it. Tony seemed to come off less stressed and less snippy with the more sleep and food he got in him. Hell, the man even put on more muscle. Steve started to feel better about how things were settling in. They were still fighting crime, either individually or as pairs or as a team. But now their bonds seemed to deepen. They were getting closer to each other. The same could be said about him and Tony.
"It is not safe to tell you that yet. But I promise you that you are him and when we know it is safe, we will tell you." Steve said, his eyes never leaving Zac. There was something tense about Steve, as if he did not like Zac. Which did not make much sense to him. Maybe there was something he was missing, though that was doubtful since he had a plethora of knowledge as well as instant access to any database he could think about. Steve took a sip off his coffee before he stood and gave Zac a nod and Jet a smile. There was a strange thud for a moment which Steve seemed to over look.
"That…makes sense…" Steve said, trailing off, not really sure what to say to that. Bruce was the doctor who would know more about that kind of stuff then himself. There wasn't much he could offer in the way of an explanation for why he and his Perfect Match had sat in the same room for two days, bracelets free, and never suspected what they were to one another. Pepper was looking at him with the softest of smiles. It was clear that she took this news well. He couldn't help but feel a little bad for Pepper. The woman had to stand by and watch Tony, knowing that one day he may just end it all, and know she could do nothing to stop it.
Yet he couldn't help but be okay with the end result. Safety washed over him in a waves as he leaned back into Steve's arms, knowing that sitting there was the safest place for him. It was a place where nothing could hurt him. At least not without getting through Steve first. He turned in Steve's arms and wrapped his arms tightly around Steve's shoulder, burying his face in his chest. His hands gripped the cotton white shirt that Steve wore, holding on as the memories subsided and placed themselves in chronological order in his mind.
Fury wants me to be in the stupid Tower, fine. But that is the only reason why I would even be in the same area as you." Why was he saying these things? Why was he attacking Tony like this? What was going on between them? He watched as Tony stood up straighter and glared at him. He saw Tony's hand flex around his own cup of coffee.
Jet jerked upright, awakening with a hard on. He was breathing like he had just ran a marathon. He looked around wildly before he realized that he was still in the apartment that he was renting. It had been four days since he ended up in this town. Since he had awoken in an underground building with people after him and no identity. He was slowly growing used to the name Jet Snow, even if it did not fit. It didn't even feel right on his tongue. But for now it was all he had. He closed his eyes but found that sleep alluded him.
The Blue light signaled the coming together of a Perfect Pair. A rare occurrence even with all the Mixers the Society for Enhancements put on. Not that any of those events helped Tony at all. The only thing that helped Tony feel any better about reading thoughts and feelings was alcohol and meaningless sex. Sure people now called him a drunk playboy, but at least he wasn't going insane. Guides. He knew how quickly he could go that route. Too many emotions and mental voices could easily drive him insane. It was the reason why he avoided board meetings, he only did press interviews when he had to and went to parties occasionally. He was tired of hearing people think of him as nothing more than a guy who got lucky. More often than not, people always thought Tony was a horrible person. Except for Pepper, Natalie, Happy and Rhody, the rest of the world thought he was the worst. He could feel their hate, their animosity beating down on his from all sides whenever he left his house. Their thoughts destroyed his already fragile sense of self. His parents had ensured he never had much of one to begin with.
"Tony Stark is your Perfect Match" Natasha said in a cool tone. Steve stared at her before he jerked off the bed and snatched up the tablet. He had to see this for himself. He couldn't believe it.
The Avengers were silent. The Doom bots stuttered the died where they stood. No one said a word. They stood there in stunned silence. Tony, once again, had sacrificed himself. Only this time, they felt the sick dread that he wasn't coming back. It took hours to finally locate where Tony and the Iron Man suit. Pepper had called to warn them that they would likely walk into a horrific scene. She had found out that Tony had activated the failsafe measured for all the suits. Meaning they all exploded and became unrecognizable. Steve felt like bile was taking up permanent residence in his mouth. He had lost friends and a love before, but Tony had been everything to him in this time. He had been his brother in arms, best friend and partner. They had been dating for a little bit, taking things slowly for Tony's sake, as well as his own if he was honest. Now he regretted it. He would never know what it would be like to finally have all of Tony.
'He is checking me out!' He thought in excitement. Maybe…he could convince Zac that they should try hanging out more. That would be nice to have someone else around. Especially someone who clearly reminded him of someone else. He knew in his heart that he may never find that other person again, the person in his dreams, but he wanted what he felt with that other man. He wanted it like a crack addict needed his next fix. He gave Zac a cocky grin before motioning for the man to head out. He grabbed the key to the apartment. Zac didn't move a muscle until Jet was standing near him. The other man pushed off the wall, brushing against Jet, before walking out the door. Jet shivered a bit at the contact. He tried to school his features to be calm, but the grin on his face just wouldn't go away.
"...Jane. I don't remember anything. Like at all. I am only starting to piece everything together. As much as I want to hope that your friend really knows me...I am not holding my breath." He said in a sad tone. Jane reached out and touched his arm softly. Jet felt so...good with contact. It made him weak, according to Zac. But he always needed some kind of physical reassurance. He liked being touched. Not sexually, but he liked physically affection.
"Tasha. Listen. Give J.A.R.V.I.S that code I gave you two days ago. It will have everything in it. Clint, Please pull your head out of your ass, Bruce won't." Tony slammed into Dr. Doom. The man was still holding the device. Tony tightened his hold as the man struggled.
"Because you are not, Tony. You became Ironman to fix the wrongs. You changed your company from creating Weapons to creating clean energy and new age devices. Plus… with us, you are not that man. With us, you are different. You were always the one who gave much more of himself for our sake… You….gave us a home, Tony. You gave us a home without expecting anything in return. You gave us a sanctuary where we could be ourselves. You….gave us that. Gave us more than anyone else has or ever will"
"Coulson is on in route. The safe house is initiated now. JARVIS is being downloaded as we speak." Was all Bruce could say. It was not his place to tell Tony that his Perfect Match was also heading that way. The Safe house was a set up by The Society of Enhanced Human, not SHIELD. Which would mean that there would be a commotion when Steve arrived in a jet. By the time Bruce closed the phone, Steve, Natasha and Clint were gone, leaving him alone with Pepper, who was sitting int he chair beside the bed. It was clear she was frightened for Tony. He walked up to her and laid his hand on her shoulder.
"Okay, out with it. What is so exciting?" Steve asked, genuinely curious but he did not want to give the other man the satisfaction of knowing.
The next several days found Steve puttering around his apartments, trying to make it feel like home. But no matter what he did, it never turned out right. It never felt more than a temporary living space. He laid in bed, trying to think of something else he could do. He stared at his ceiling, wondering what more could be done when he heard his apartment door open. He sat up and rushed into the living room, intent on finding out who was entering his home unannounced. He stopped and stared at the last person who was expecting. Tony Stark was sitting on his couch, in his apartment, holding two cups of what smelt like coffee. The other man gave Steve him a once over before taking a sip off his coffee.
He came to understand that, when one night Tony reached up and grabbed his hand and placed it over the arch reactor. Steve looked away from the TV to look down at Tony. He noticed how Tony had a light tremble to his body. His hand seemed content to just press Steve's large hand against the arch reactor. Steve's thumb shifted and rubbed the edge of the device carefully, noticing how shaken Tony looked. It was like he was struggling to over come something. He continued to stroke his thumb over the edge of the reactor, waiting for Tony to speak and explain. Eventually the mild tremors vanished.
"I am. I want to protect it, because out of everyone in the world, I am too old fashioned to allow anyone to break it or you, including myself." Steve said, making it clear to Tony that he understood the implications of Tony was asking. Tony looked unsure, confused almost. Steve decided that Tony needed some kind of proof that he understood what Tony was actually asking of him. He kept his hand on Tony's arc reactor as he leaned down and brushed his lips over Tony. Tony's lips fell open as he sucked in a sharp breath before letting it out in a shutter. Steve pulled back to look at Tony. The man look alike he was god smacked. Steve gave him a shy smile, hoping that he read what Tony wanted right.
"Confirmation. Sir does have the capabilities to communicate with electrical components. How, I can not be sure. Upon return to the Tower, Dr. Banner and myself will be able to figure out how this operates." An English Sounding voice came from the phone. It was from the same source as the voice in his head. Tony made a mental note for when they weren't being shot at to look into JARVIS. Steve stared at Tony for a bit before he pulled out a gun from the side of the motorcycle. Steve had pushed the alert button on the side of the phone, alerting the Avengers to the problem. Tony did not even want to begin to think about why he even had a gun.
"Tony are you okay? You're breathing sounds erratic?" Bruce's voice asked across the line. Tony hadn't realized that he was starting to hyperventilating. Not good. Not good at all.
"So I understand that Tony is affection starved and vulnerable. But he doesn't leave me alone, even when I tell him to. Why is that? Huh? Why won't he leave me alone?" He asked, knowing he was getting defensive and trying to make it seem like this was all Tony's fault.
"Did Pepper or Bruce send you down here with that?" He asked in an accusing tone. Steve raised a brow before he picked up another chip and ate in slowly. He swallowed before shaking his head.
"Perhaps, if you allow sir, I can check your….system and see if there is a coding problem." Tony had to laugh at the idea, before giving Jarvis the go ahead. There was a tense moment before Tony felt that presence in his mind, only this time it moved in him. It was the strangest thing he had ever felt, but the presence moved quickly and efficiently before it latched onto something. The code looked weird but before Tony could really catch what it was for, Jarvis dismantled the code. Tony felt the anger vanish just as quickly as it came. Tony felt relief for a moment.
"Tony, it's me. Capscile. I was born in a time, where kissing happened a month into the relationship. I am used to slow. We will go at whatever pace you set." Tony let out a grateful breath before he wrapped his arms and hugged Steve. The larger man moved Tony into his lap and wrapped him up in his arms, protecting him from the outside world. Tony seemed to need that. Tony seemed to need someone strong enough to make him eat and sleep, without wanting anything from him but to take care of his own health. Needed someone to protect him, even though he could protect himself just fine.
"I am so glad you are back. Nice sweater, by the way" Bruce said softly. Clint chuckled off to one side, and Natasha looked mildly amused.
Jet awoke to the smell of coffee. He jerked off the bed, letting the sheet pool on his lap as he stared bewildered at the three people sitting at his table. He didn't even think to hide the bruises on his wrist and arms. Or rather no thoughts occurred to him at all because he hadn't had a drop of coffee yet. He stumbled of the bed and over to them before snatching the coffee being held out to him. He held it like it was the most precious thing in the world before he threw himself down into the chair next to Steve. He inhaled the smell before he took a large swallow of it. He let out a groan and laid his head on the table.
"Affirmative. Is it...?" A voice called from the sleeve. There was a small hesitation there. Jet felt something clench in him at that voice. Like he heard it before. He looked at the diner like it was going to kill him to go inside. He noticed that Vanessa was there. He took a deep breath, waiting. Phil looked at him, giving him a once over before speaking into the microphone again.
"Sir, Mr. Rogers is here to see you." J.A.R.V.I.S' automated voice said. Tony was elbow deep in some kind of machine, gone to the world. Steve walked to one of the cleaner work tables and set the food and water bottles down. He picked up a chip and loudly ate it. Tony jumped a bit and whirled around, wrench in hand. His arms and shirt were streaked with grease. There was even some on his face. He blinked at Steve, as if seeing him for the first time before he tossed the wretch back into the tool box.
Tony's mind short circuited when Steve's mouth came down to mouth over his covered erection. He felt his hot breath ghost through the material to caress over him. He let out a short curse, not believing how good it felt. Suddenly, his wrists were released and his hips were pull up. Steve jerked his pants off him in one swift motion, leaving Tony naked beneath him. Tony watched as those eyes roamed over his body, taking everything in with a desperate hunger. Tony never felt more desired or loved then in that moment. He sat up on his elbows and watched as Steve shucked off his own jeans, revealing himself to Tony. His breath hitched as he saw how….well endowed his mate was. He grinned a bit and held his out to Steve.
"Yes, but it was what he wanted Tony. Remember, that he wanted to you make it. It was his choice" Steve said in that ever reasonable tone. Tony held Steve tighter, holding onto the his words even tighter.
"Should I be jealous of Captain America?" He said in a teasing tone. Tony gave him a withering look as they walked back out to the bike.
Letting out a frustrated sigh he decided to use his…mind power to figure somethings out. He focused on that part of his mind that connected him to the endless stream of information. He started with searching for Amnesia and the time it would take to recover. A sudden stream of information came in. He found that there was a chance he would never fully regain his memories. The probability was that his amnesia came from trauma, a deduction that was relatively easy to come to. His search drew up an article that talked about Dream recollection. It stated that memories could sometimes be recalled when a person entered the REM cycle. The mind would use it as a means to reinstate old memories. The only issue with this form of recollection was that the memories came back without a true sense of time. They were just floating memories that had no time attached to them.
"I have created and found a way to make this reality a myth. I have the means to help people find their Perfect Match. Even if that can't be found, a list of other really good bond mates can be given. Think about it. A world where a Sentinel does not have to fear Oblivion. Where a Guide doesn't have to numb themselves in order to make it through life." Tony paused, trying to keep the desperation out of his tone. He knew that the two women understood why this project was so important to Tony. Why it would be a life saver for the man. He had, privately, ran his wave through the database he had created and found nothing. There was no one who would even be able to form a tentative bond with him. He had no more hope. But he could make it so that there was hope for everyone else in the Enhanced Human society. He could keep suicides among them to a minimum. He had the means to help. But he had a bias that would make it difficult for him to do the project himself. He knew it would not help his sense of self to see all those happy couple getting matched up.
"How about you tell me what it is you are doing and how long you think it will take you to finish, for my sandwich and the water bottle?"
Men with guns walked into the room. He stepped back, on edge. He grabbed the men and then threw them to the wall, only to have them go through it. He looked around, now scared. He jumped over the called wall only to be in another room. He looked around, confused. He ran through a door. All he heard was Captain Roger and something about All Agents Code Thirteen, the sounds followed him as he ran. He ran into another room only to be slammed by more sounds, more smells, more feelings and more confusion. Guys in suits suddenly turned on him. He ran out the glass door, suddenly consumed by sounds of cars and people. He looked around, so very confused at the world that now surrounded him. There was still the same smells as before, only now he could tell he was being over powered. His mind struggled to keep up with what was going on around him. He ran and ran until he came upon a clearing. Building upon building were all around him. Lights, moving images like movies only in color. Cars like he had never seen. Everything was almost too much for him. It wasn't the world he had left behind. It was nothing like he had ever experienced before. He looked around in a circle, trying to comprehend everything.
"God this must be a dream. You only come in my dreams." He whispered, struggling not to cry. A hand came into his line of sight, it hesitated for a moment before it moved to the blue light source. Jet stiffened for only a fraction of a second before the hand came to rest over the light. Unlike Zac's hand, this one felt perfect. Felt right and ok. Tony let out a soft sob as that hand pressed the blue light deeper into his chest, which pushed him deeper into the man's arms.
"He has to make it! His DNA code is exactly what is needed for this to work!" An aggravated man said.
"Then you better inform him Nat! The Other guy won’t stand for people hurting Tony. Fix this." Rage clear in Bruce's tone. Steve looked back just in time to see Bruce start running down the hall, as if he was trying to escape the situation. He watched Banner vanish, uncertain about what Bruce was talking about. He jerked when he felt a strong grip on his arm. He looked at Natasha only to find her face blank and her eyes staring at him as if he was the enemy. He felt his heart speed up a little bit as felt fear overcome him. Natasha looked like she wanted to make Steve eat the floor of the hallway. Why were Widow and Hulk so upset by what he had said to Stark?
"You have no idea." That voice was husky, dropping at least an octave. Tony felt his cock twitch with interest. Steve chuckled before walking away, leaving Tony standing there dumb founded. He kicked into high gear and chased after Steve.
"Yeah. You could say you are a genius when it comes to machines. Scary genius." Steve said with a chuckle.
"Steve." He said, the voice coming out of some sort of desperate plea, for what he did not know. He would never know, for the moment was broken by Zac barging into his apartment.
"By muscle memory." He said with an uneasy shrug. If he fixed the car, maybe he could get a rid into town.
"Why do you feel like an outsider, Steve?" Tony asked in a soft tone. Steve was taken back by the usage of his name. He floundered for a moment. Tony was asking him to explain why he felt like an outsider? That made no sense. Tony couldn't see it for himself? Was this some kind of torture technique.
The feeling of ice on Steve Roger's skin was the first thing he felt when he came to. Then as his mind slowly came to, his senses came as well. It was like a thousand radios were turned on. His skin felt like it was on fire. The radio beside his bed was the loudest. The rest of the sounds were muffled by something. He could smell the laundry detergent that was used to clean the sheets he was under. He could smell the antiseptics that were used. But it was everything else that clued him in that he was being played. The game on the radio was the very game he had seen before the war. The smell of motor grease, sweat, gun powder. The sound of things moving too quickly, rushing feet, metal on metal and the barking of orders. He waited for someone to come in, to give him an opportunity to escape. He watched as a woman dressed as a nurse walked into the room. He watched her cautiously for his upright position. She closed the door behind him. He was ready for anything. He was confused and the influx of information was too much for him. He could tell she was a guide trying to calm his sense, but she was failing at it.
