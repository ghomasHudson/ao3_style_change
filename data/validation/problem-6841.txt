“I know,”  Her fingers flexed at her sides, locking into fists for a moment.  “I-  I know.”  She looked up at him, her sharp little chin raised high. “Would I be asking if I had any other choice?”
“Understatement of the year,” Happy said.  He picked up his toolbox.  “Jarvis wants you to drive Rogers back to the city?”
“Just…  Talk about some trashy reality show or something,” Shawn said.  He gave Harris a thumbs up.  “Safer.  For everyone.”
“Should’ve thought of that before you moved in,” Tony said with a tight smile.  “That was a bad choice.”
“I love your staff,” Darcy said to her, grabbing onto the back of Harris’ shirt, letting him tow her through the flow of the crowd.  “What is he-”
“Ask the man out, Rogers,” Sam said, picking up the pace.  He pumped a fist in the air.  “New year’s coming, let’s see what changes you can make in your life.”
“Mrs. Parker has called dibs,” Jarvis said.  He sounded regretful.  “I’m sure when she’s done with him, she will let the rest of us know.”
"You can bring those with you, and after lunch, I think I have something you might enjoy," Jarvis said, offering DJ his hand.  "Would you like to help Mrs. Parker and I?"
"Stop sabotaging me, I need the agreement in order to live," Clint said.  He rolled to his feet, testing his balance and his back at the same time.  Everything held, despite the ache in one leg.  He sucked in a careful breath. "What's your name?”  Simple questions, short.  Easy to answer.  Give her something to focus on.
Steve ignored him.  “It’s important,” he said.  And that wasn’t enough.  That wasn’t nearly enough.  There was something hard and sharp lodged in his throat, and he could feel his pulse pounding in his temples, something beyond anger, beyond fear making his chest ache.  He held out a hand.  “It’s important to me.  Give it back.  Now.”
“I just bet he is.” Tony looked at the board, his eyes narrowing.  “Can I play on your side?” he asked DJ.  “You can show me your tactics.”  DJ nodded, his face lighting up, and Tony smiled back at him.  “Come here, then.”
Tony pointed at Rhodey.  “And you're here to keep me from lighting a government facility on fire,” Tony said, refusing to be distracted.  “It's not going to work.”  He leaned his palms on his edge of the bench.  “I'm going to find these things.  And I'm going to rip my componants out of them.  With my bare hands.  Or maybe a crowbar.  I haven't taken a crowbar to any trash tech in a decade, I'm out of practice, but I'm more than willing to do this.”
“We’re waiting for the Doc to give us the diagnosis,” Rhodey said, his head tipped forward.  He rubbed the back of his neck, his fingers biting into the skin there.  “Hopefully, he wasn’t out long.”
Tony grinned.  “But I bet you know some Italians, don’t you?” he said.  That won him a nod.  “Well, I’m Italian, too.  Half, at least.”
“Stop encouraging her,” Tony called, and, laughing, Steve pulled the door shut again.  Tony realized he was smiling at the door like a lovesick idiot and gave his head a sharp shake.  “Anyway.  Let’s-”
He was already moving, scrambling towards the trunk, towards his own armor, but too slow, way too slow, there was no way he’d get it open, get it on, get it-
“Good.  I’ll bring them to the workshop.”  Phil paused.  “You’re helping with the laundry?”  DJ nodded.  “Did you see the Johnny Cash shirt?  And the one with the-” He made a gesture with one hand.  “I think it’s a manatee.  Or it used to be a manatee.  Ten years ago.  When it was legible and the shirt wasn’t threadbare.”
“Yeah, if you don't want blowjobs in inappropriate locations, you need to stop saying that,” Tony said, his feet flying over the stairs.
“Yeah, do one cannonball into a third floor bathtub and flood two rooms under it, and people learn,” Tony said, leaning forward to press a kiss against Steve’s forehead.
DJ looked at Steve.  “Do you want to  go watch a movie?” Steve asked, his thumb rubbing back and forth over the back of Tony’s hand.  “Bet we can find Star Wars.”
“No. I mean.”  Steve glanced away, his stomach aching.  “No.  I’m just-” He risked looking back at Tony.  “Are you-” He shifted his weight, and realized his arms were crossed over his chest.  He let them drop back to his sides.  “Are you interested?” He cleared his throat.  “In Sam?”
“Congrats,” Clint said, slapping Steve on the back.  “Excuse me.  Ma’am, is there a back way out of this chapel?”
They wove through the old apple and pear trees together, their steps almost in tandem.  Bobbi didn’t seem to be paying attention to where they were going, her head down, her shoulders squared.  “When I was a teenager, things started to fall apart.  There was a political skirmish in the Chemistry department, and my father’s loyalty to his adopted country was questioned.  When he got fired, well, he also got blackballed.  No one would hire him.”
“You can have that one, the hole in the armpit’s getting pretty noticeable,” Clint said.  He bounced a bottle of food coloring off of the side of his elbow, sending it spinning through the air and back into the rotation.  “Like, more hole than armpit at this point.  The Cash shirt is fine, though.”
Tony considered that, his eyes narrowing.  “Exactly?”  He gave the wrench a toss, letting it spin end over end before he caught it and slid it into his pocket.
“Yes,” Stephen said, with a wry smile.  “I saw him.  I spoke to him.  He’s about as happy about the situation as you are, but he’s fine.”
“Please tell me there's no acid-” Rogers started, and Tony leaned back in his seat.  Tweaking the man had rapidly become one of his favorite games.
Steve smiled back, then sat  down.  He looked down at his bowl, but out of the corner of his eye, he saw Rhodes smile at Miss Potts, and she smiled back, her face lit with it.  Steve flicked the spoon against the side of his bowl.  “Excuse me,” he said, giving the soup a stir.  “It's none of my business.  But-”  He glanced up, catching their eyes.  “I'm good at keeping my mouth shut, and even better at minding my own business.  So, if you're pretending for my sake-”
“No, seriously, fuck you all,” Bucky said.  He crossed his arms over his chest.  “Let the royals clutch their pearls, because fuck you in particular.”
Marcy looked up.  “So yes.  We can put out a press release right now that says that you were just caught up with the moment, that you didn't realize that the 'ceremony' was legally binding, that you didn't intend to get married, and that while you meant no disrespect, you're going to get this rectified as quickly as possible.”
Tony gave him a thin lipped smile.  “Right.  He's hooked up to every machine imaginable, Jarvis has got a lock on him, and Sam will be here soon.” He leaned in.  “He's being monitored.  But all of you-” He waved his hand at the medical staff. “Are only stressing him out right now, and that's not beneficial.”
“Bruce locks it,” Tony said.  “He’s a bit paranoid, but it makes him feel better.”  He braced his chin on his palm.  “Did you find what you were looking for?”
"Fix his sleeves before I forget myself and start adjusting how his pants hang," Miss Van Dyne said, her voice dire, and Stark caught Steve's lapels, pulling him back around.
Jan was flipping through a huge catalog of invitation samples, a pencil tucked behind her ear, and a piece of toast clamped between her teeth.  As Steve walked in, she scribbled something on a legal pad and snagged the toast, tapping the crust against her plate.  He knew the moment she spotted him, because her face split in a wide, warm grin.  “Steve!  Perfect!  Now that you're dry, come here and help me pick a font!”
It smelled...  Good.  Stark smelled good.  It was subtle, almost natural, a tangle of spices and scents that Steve had no words for.  He didn't know what they were, but he knew he liked the way it smelled, liked the way that Stark smelled, and that was a dangerous line of thought.
Tony was silent for a moment.  “I’ve made a lot of bad choices,” he said at last.  “This…  Feels like something else entirely.”  He pulled away, pushing himself to his feet, his shirt slipping off his shoulders.  He shook it off, letting it fall to the ground with casual disregard.  He took a breath, his fingers cradling his side.  “I’m fine.  But if you’re worried…”  His smile was slow and sweet and promised wicked things.  “Perhaps you should come.  Watch over me tonight.”
Steve smiled at him.  “Merry Christmas, Tony,” he said, and somehow the flowers were in Tony's hands, and that was fine, because Steve was leaning in, just a little.  Cautious.  Careful.  Giving Tony plenty of time to pull back, to put some distance between them.
“We have associations.  Things we hold onto,” Rhodey said.  “And Tony, well, it’s food, it’s always food.”  He drained the rest of his coffee and stood, heading back to the pot.  “So I’ll give you a hint.  You’ll find me on Tony’s right wrist.”  He smiled.  “Think of that as your Rosetta stone, and work from there.”
Tony reached for the coffee pot.  “I like to think I won that one,” he said to DJ, who was scribbling on his pad.  Tony decided that if the kid was writing all this down, he didn’t want to know about it.  He poured himself another cup of coffee. Maybe this one would make a dent in the throbbing headache he’d had since he’d woken up.
He shook his head.  “The point is, when he added you, it was a safeguard.  Against someone attempting to dethrone him.”  He looked back at Steve.  “You were a threat.   To anyone who thought to depose Phillips, you were a very real problem.”
Tony grinned against his mouth.  “I’m willing to call your bluff here,” he said.  “Since you’d feel obligated to repair it if you did.”
He paused, trying to find a diplomatic way to put this, and Stark glanced up.  “Scripted?” he asked.
“Yes, but your bullet ridden corpse might cause a loss of consumer confidence,” Pepper said, studying her ledger.
Behind DJ, Hitomi was laughing, her shoulders shaking.  "Bad ramen.  Instant ramen," she said, and Steve stopped dead.
“Oh, I would like to,” Jan said, making a face.  She slid off of Tony's desk, swinging the end of her tape measure like a feather boa.  “But Hank's expecting me.”
"Yeah, why would I possibly want you to look presentable?" Steve asked, cuffing him lightly on the side of the head. Laughing, Seamus fended him off, waving his fists like a prize fighter. "Let's go. Everyone's waiting.”
Steve's fingers brushed against his thigh, and Tony gritted his teeth.  “I don't know,” he whispered.  “He's always talked sense to me when I needed it.”
Logan looked over at him.  “Thank you,” he said.  “The girl's okay, by the way.  She wanted me to say thanks.”
“Oh.  Peter grimaced.  “No.  That’s....”  He pasted a smile on his face.  “I’m going to make coffee.”
Rogers shook his head.  “He's been in the city his whole life, in the most crowded, dirtiest depths of the city.  He sleeps in a room with ten, twelve other boys.  There's always someone snoring, or someone talking, or someone crying or even just breathing.  The streets are never quiet, never dark, no matter what the hour.
“And it's a damn THING,” Steve said, frustration twisting through him.  “And in six months, I won't be, and it's-”  His shoulders slumped.  “It's what I wanted, and it's all wrong, all at the same time.”
“I do not want Sir heading back upstairs, or worse, straight out onto the lawn, where he would be a fairly visible target,” Jarvis said, and Aunt May paused, looking up at him, her slipper dangling from her fingertips.  “And I need to call the other properties, to make certain that this is an isolated incident.”
“It might be,” Steve said.  “You need help with-”  Isaiah's head shot up, his black eyes locking on Steve with laser-like focus, and Steve's hands went up in an immediate pose of surrender.  “Right.  Nope.  You don't.  Sorry I asked.  I'll just be over here.  Hiding.”
“He bought a new sketchbook, and sure, he’s got more than a few of those.  But I’ve never met an artist who’s been able to resist spending money on more sketchbooks.”  Steve set the tablet down on the desk in front of Tony.  “I know.  I know you want to protect him.  But he took the money that you gave him, that you told him he could spend on anything, and he used it to buy things for people who likely are trying to decide if they can afford to get groceries this week.”
“Probably,” she said.  She didn't seem overly bothered by that.  “So I knew they were still in the city.  And I took their picture late.  Chances are, they stayed here rather than bunking down at the airport.  And Stark isn't likely to head for the local equivalent of a Motel 6, you know?”
“I was.”  Tony crossed to the bath, trailing his fingers through the bathwater.  “He wanted May, and let me tell you, she was quite smug about that.”  He gave Steve a look.  “My story reading is, apparently, subpar.”
“That's very measured of you,” Steve agreed.  “Considering that your 'resource' took definite aim against a non-combatant that was doing her best to flee, not attack.”  He stared Gyrich down, his face set in stone.  “And I'm certain that the bad PR from having us arrested in the wake of this debacle isn't something that is part of your consideration.”
Tony’s smile had an edge.  “So, what will you do if I won’t move?”  He waved his free hand through the air.  “If I call your bluff and just…”  His eyebrows arched.  “Stay right here?”
He turned towards the door, his shoulders tense, his back straight.  “Or at least, nothing of any use.”
“A couple miles from here, near the docks,” Hammer said.  He gave them an intersection, his voice shaking.  “Near there.  I looked, I swear I did, but he’s…”
“Yeah, you know what?  You don’t get to talk here,” he said, the words cutting.  “He’s here because you lost him, so really-”
“Right,” Tony said, piling vegetables onto the ramen.  “Right.  How…”  He paused, his hands braced on the counter.   “How did that go?”
“I saw you naked,” Rhodey said.  “For the…”  He stopped, one eyebrow arching.  “God, I’ve seen you naked way, way too much, Tony.”
He felt, as much as heard, Steve laugh against his throat and thumped at his shoulder with one closed fist.  “Sex now, mocking later,” he said.
Laughing, Tony pushed at his shoulder.  "Get off.  I know you're only trying to check my temperature."
Curious despite himself, Steve moved the weight aside, lifting the lid.  A gentle waft of warm steam came with it, scented with onion and black pepper.  “Potato?” he asked, considering the creamy liquid inside.
The streets were full of people, holding signs painted on cardboard and sheets, rainbow flags tied around people's shoulders and dangling from upraised fists.  There was singing and chanting coming from various groups, and something that Steve would've identified as parade floats moving clumsily through the crowds.  On them, girls with shaved heads combat fatigues also wore flower crowns and small domino style masks, their hands covered in glitter as they tossed fistfuls of rainbow confetti into the crowd.  Musicians and DJs were scattered in each moving platform, the traditional instruments mixing with modern house music to form a riotous, almost cacophonous sound.  Dancers followed behind, shoes kicking up gleaming rainbow clouds with each step.
“So you weren’t there, hush, we’ll get to you later,” Tony said.  “So.  Had a drink.  Talked to Thor.”
“Yes.”  She looked at Franklin, who shrugged, his shoulders twitching up.  She heaved a sigh, and turned back to DJ.  “DJ?  Do...  Do you want to talk about it?”
Bobbi’s fingertip tapped against the folder, sharp and staccato.  “No,” she said with a faint smile.  “Happy’s the distraction.  He’s the guy everyone likes, the one everyone talks to.  He’s harmless, and he takes up a lot of space and makes a lot of noise.”  She shook her head.  “Once he gets going, it’s very hard to focus on anything else.”
Nakia burst out laughing, even as T’Challa raised a hand in a ‘what have I done to deserve this?’ gesture.  “I might be interested!  What is your opening offer?” Nakia called back.  She cantored up to them, the men right behind her.
DJ peered at him from under the folds of the blanket.  His nose and eyes were red, his cheeks wet.  "Don't tell," he whispered, and Clint's chest ached.
“Understood, and the Maria Stark Foundation thanks you for your kind donation,” she said, reaching for her clipboard and her pen.  It was a ballpoint, but there was quill attached to it.  For flair, Steve supposed.  “Please enjoy yourselves, and let me know if there’s anything you need tonight.”
“Swear I’ll kick you right into the river if you finish that sentence,” Bucky said.  He steered his horse around a slow moving boy and his flock of geese.  For a brief, endless moment, he was out of Steve’s reach, and then he was swinging back in.  “You and Wilson are the only people I know anymore, and I can’t stand Wilson.”
Steve nodded.  “We’ll get him back,” he said, and Tony turned away without a word.  Steve caught his arm, pulling him to a stop.  “I go first.”
Laughing, Tony stroked a hand over his head, playing with his hair.  “How old were you?  When he decked your boyfriend?”
Tony’s fingers tapped against the cover of the journal.  “It’s fixed,” he said, and she looked pale in the low light of the fire.  “Or as fixed as it can be, without the stolen part.”
Tony realized his mouth was hanging open.  "You...  Blame Jarvis," he repeated.  Steve nodded.  "You're shameless, you know that?"
"And THAT'S why I've never seen the inside of Tony's bedroom," Steve said with a painfully wide smile.  "Because all evidence to the contrary, I do value my mental health.  At least a little."
Steve stared down at her, weighing his options, and from behind him, Bobbi sighed.  “We know where you live,” she said.  “And you might’ve noticed that Happy and Hawkeye have vanished.  They’re the back up.  In case you do something stupid.”
The song had ended, and he didn't know when, because Tony was still with him, following his lead, holding his hand.  He glanced up at Steve, his eyebrows arched, and things needed to be said, and Steve didn't know how to say them.
“So?  Doesn’t mean I gotta do it,” Matt said, darting out of reach when Billy shook a fist at him.  Laughing, he scrambled up the stairs.  “I’m not doing your share!”
Steve Rogers was sitting in the visitor's chair next to Duck's desk, a tea cup and saucer held in one bit hand.
“He won't,” Jarvis agreed, setting a small plate of strudel in front of Pepper.  He looked at DJ.  “Would you like some tea?”  DJ shook his head.  “Lemonade?”
“That's because it is a really stupid plan, and I think I tried to warn you, in as delicate a way as I could manage, that it was a really stupid plan that was never, ever going to work.” Jan's shoulders slumped. “Steve. This was never going to work. You can't just-”
Steve rocked backwards, taking the brunt of the hit without difficulty, but the sudden impact of Tony’s body against his sent a shock through his system.  For an instant, Steve just stood there, his arms locked tight around Tony’s chest, his feet braced, his heart in his throat.
Steve felt his face heat.  “I’m sure it’s around here somewhere,” he said.  He bunched a pillow in his arms, telling himself he wasn’t hiding in its depths.  “It’s not as if I tossed it out the window.”
Tony rocked backwards, breath hissing through his tight throat.  He groped for the chair behind him, and Jarvis got there first, his arm going around Tony’s waist, holding him in place with a firm grip.   “Steady, sir,” he said, his voice calm.  “Steady.”
DJ lifted the rag away from his face, blinking up at Tony, and then down at the remains of the clock spread out over the workbench in front of him.  Tony followed his gaze.  "Ah.  Right," he said.  "Less useful in its current state."  He leaned forward, bracing his elbows on the edge of the workbench, and folding his hands in front of his mouth.  "So.  It appears that Rhodey has made the incredibly poor choice to leave you without proper adult supervision."
“Villages didn’t move,” Bucky grumbled, dropping another flask on the pile.  “You forgot where it was.”
Pepper grinned at him.  “Switch partners!” she said, turning on her heel and heading straight into Rhodey's arms.  Laughing, he took her hands, letting her drag him into a dance.
“Yes, but more importantly for this conversation, she's also currently the VP of PR and Marketing for StarkIndustries.”
The silence that followed that felt thick.  Hard.  He struggled to draw a breath, and it hurt.  His mouth worked, and nothing came out, and he hated that and he was grateful for it all at once.
“You got yourself into that mess, Tony, don't know why you'd think that I was going to get you out of it,” Steve said, heading for the door.  Tony heaved a sigh and plodded after him.  “Come on, let's see if we can steal back two of your plates, otherwise, we're eating eggs and toast off of paper towels.”
The knock at the door sent Steve scrambling backwards, his coffee cup slipping out of his hand and onto the quilt.  Biting back a curse, Tony leaned forward, his arms folded on his knee.  “Yes?” he called.
Halfway there, he picked up the faint strains of music, echoing through the hallway.  The closer he got, the louder it got, the twang of a steel guitar mixing with a pounding, driving beat that seemed to vibrate the very walls of the hall.
“It's not personal.  No one goes to Steve's place.”  Bucky paused, just long enough to cram most of a cream puff into his mouth.  His cheeks bulging like a chipmunk's, he reached for another one.  “No body.”
“Are you giving him your breakfast?” Natasha filled a serving bowl with the potatoes, fried crisp and dusted with salt and pepper.  She set it on the counter, and Stark pushed it in front of Peter.  “Miss Potts'll be upset if you don't eat something.”
“I don't-” Steve started, right before a familiar pair of dark eyes popped up on the far side of the car, little hands locking down on the metal.  Steve rocked forward, one hand coming up.  “Hey, don't touch that.”
Steve realized, far too late, that he was staring.  “Jacket,” he said, and the word burst out of him like an obscenity.  Tony blinked at him, and Steve shook his head, trying to get some of his blood back into it.  “My jacket, have you-  I need my wallet.”
“I think she’s justified,” Steve said as the other car came to a screeching halt behind them.  He gave it a wary look.  “We have options.”
Phil took a visible breath.  “No,” he said.  “Carry on.”  And he stepped back into the lobby, pulling the doors shut with a click.
“Dammit, Janet!  I love you!” Clint yelled from the kitchen.  Carol looked like she was in pain.  Sam patted her on the shoulder.
“Perhaps I can start taking classes on my own,” Tony said, dragging his spoon through his porridge.  “Be easier for me to help him if I was at University with him.”
“In my luggage,” Tony said, stretching his legs out in front of him, putting his cold, damp feet a little too close to the fire.  Steve made a disapproving noise under his breath, and Tony grinned, his eyes falling shut.  Steve smelled of wood smoke and dust, soap and peppermint.  “You’ve been into the candy canes.”
“Stop what?” he asked, grinning.  Jan muttered something that sounded like a curse, and Steve wrapped an arm around Tony's waist, pulling him away before they both ended up on the floor.
She stopped, took a breath.  “My sister's child is currently living with me," she said, her head tipping in Steve's direction.  Her brown eyes were sharp, but her face was smooth, calm.  "Marish is gender fluid.  Their parents have..."  She paused, her eyes narrowing.  "Have difficulty dealing with that, sometimes.  Mostly because they're very afraid that Marish's life will be more difficult, if they are so open as to who they are.
“What?  Oh, no, it’s trash,” Clint said with a grin.  “I know you’re trying to be polite, but no.  It’s trash.”
Steve caught his arm, dragging him into the warm shelter of his body.  “Merry Christmas, Jarvis,” he said, capping it off with a yawn.  “What time is it?”
“Never have I spoken a cross word to you, not when you set the drapes on the third floor on fire,” Jarvis pointed out.  “Not when you knocked over the crystal punchbowl less than an hour before the largest party your parents ever threw, shattering it across two separate carpets.  Not when you lost all of the French linens to a hurricane and the lake.”
“Tony, I need you to sit down,” Rhodey said.  He moved over to the balcony, pulling the doors shut.  “Before you fall down.” The cat rubbed up against his leg, and he jumped.  “What the hell is-”
“Tell me the truth, Miss Potts,” Tony said, returning his pen to its stand.  “How much of your job is honestly easier if I’m not there while you’re trying to do it?”
Tony ruffled his hair with one rough hand, and DJ leaned into the contact.  “Bratbot,” Tony told him, and kissed him on top of the head.  “If everyone's staying for dinner, start picking up, and put my armor back where it belongs, Deej.  You've got thirty minutes to finish up, and get washed up, because I suspect you're all filthy, and we have opinions about that.”
"He wants a high five," Tony explained, running a hand through his hair.  "And he's very stubborn, give in with grace or he'll follow you around with one hand up in the air and that gets weird, I don't need that, it's-”  He sighed.  “It just looks bad, we try to avoid it.”
“You sent me into an active wormhole,” Harris pointed out.  “You…  Tossed me into an untested piece of possibly alien technology.  What did you expect?”
Tony considered a damaged part.  “Trash heap.”  He tossed it back in the box.  “Do we throw nothing away?”
Tony made a face.  “I'm fine.  I wanted a glass of water.  I got a glass of water.”  He stopped.  “Then I decided to, you know, sit down for a second.”
Steve let out a noise that was half laugh, half cough, and Sam reached for the water pitcher to refill his cup.  Steve waved him off.  "I'm fine," he managed, trying to get his breathing back under control.  "Just a-"
One of the Stranges stepped through, and DJ followed, disappearing into the light.  Rogers and Stark went together, and as they stepped forward, Tony saw them reach out, finding the others hand as if by habit or instinct.
"Everyone RSVP?" Tony asked.  He picked up a piece of silverware from a nearby table, turning it over between his fingers.
“Yes, neither do I, and that’s why we’re leaving,” Darcy said.  “Does anything hurt?  Did you hit your head?  Does anything feel broken?”
The man shrugged.  “Kid came with some paperwork, his bicycle’s out front.  Guess he’s waiting for a reply before he can take off back to the office what sent him.”  He leaned back against the side of the house, his arms crossed over his chest.  His nightstick swung back, banging against the house with a dull thud.  “They’ll be keeping an eye on him down in the kitchen.”
"We are not putting pins in his jacket," Stark said, his voice stern.  "It's close enough, and Jarvis has dinner for eight to-"
“Obviously,” Sam repeated.  “And what are you planning on doing with the truck?  Cause there's no fucking way you're finding street parking for it, and it won't fit in Tony's spot in the parking garage.”
Jarvis passed within his field of vision, giving Tony a speaking look from beneath the arch of his eyebrows.  “I agreed to assist in preventing the youngest member of our household from barging into your room at all hours of the day or night.  I did not agree to assist you in-”  He paused, his eyes rolling towards the ceiling as he unwound the muffler from his neck.  “Defiling every room in this house.”
Then Val reached out, touching his hand, and DJ realized that he was clutching the fabric of his shirt so hard that his knuckles were white.  “It's okay if you can't,” she said, and when she smiled, her face scrunched up, all chubby cheeks and bright teeth.  “We'll figure it out.”
Jan drew herself up as much as she could.  It didn't help much.  "And I can still dance," she said, her voice sugary sweet.  "So I'm not sure what my height has to do with it?"
DJ was sitting on the edge of a battered plush chair, his hands braced on either side of his hips, staring up at dusty chandelier that hung in the middle of the ceiling.  Tony stopped in front of him.  “This cannot be the place,” he said.
“Let them continue thinking that,” Tony said.  He turned his attention back to Rhodey.  “What we talked about before.  Get Pepper on it.”
Tony nodded.  “I know.  But-”  He glanced over, a faint smile creasing his lips.  “Grasping at the thinnest of straws, I suppose.”
Steve waited until he disappeared back into the pantry before he continued.  “Where do you live?” he asked, his voice low.  Mickey gave him a look, and Steve struggled against a smile.  “I’m just hired help, too.  I’m betting my address isn’t any more sophisticated.”
“He’ll get you on the relief rolls,” Steve said.  He went back to his food.  “He owes me a favor, a big one.”  He shot Mickey a smile.  “And he’s rather desperate not to.  Told him in that note, he did this, we’re even.”
“Absolutely nothing over a thousand dollars,” Tony said, because Steve made the best faces when he was trying to repress a flinch.  Tony grinned as he headed for the kitchen door.  “Five thousand.  Max.”
Tony laughed.  “Yeah.  Yeah, I…  Yeah.”  He looked up at the sky, and felt his stomach shift.  He went back to his phone.  “As soon as the Tweedle Twins and Harris are done with their mischief, we’ll get you something to eat and a bed.”
"Fixing the goddamn bullet holes," Tony muttered into his cup.  "Goddamn Doom and his goddamn Doombots."  Steve's hand tightened, a faint, gentle squeeze.  Tony subsided with a sound that would've been an obscenity if he had the energy for obscenities.
Rogers blinked at her, his cup hovering in front of his mouth. “Smooth,” Jesse said, under her breath. She was holding her cup with both hands. She didn't seem inclined to drink from it.
The two girls came to a stop, and Tony nearly lost his fried dough.  He bobbled the plate, trying to keep the apple filling in place, looking around in confusion.
Steve was already shaking his head.  "No, that's..." He shifted his weight.  "I'm not a guest, sir."
“They one hundred percent got married,” Maria agreed.  “Legal and binding.”  She gave the room a tight smile.  “And since Symkaria is a very valuable partner in our attempts to keep Von Doom and his waves of deathbots under control, the US Government is absolutely not going to risk an international incident with them right now by claiming otherwise.”
“Thank you, Jarvis,” she said, draping herself on the couch.  She fluttered her eyelashes in Tony’s direction.  “At least someone here is a gentleman.”
“You can come with me next time,” Jan told her.  “You and Pepper and Natasha.  I’ll bring you a gown and we can be a mysterious band of glamorous and-”
Tony nodded.  “Uh-huh.”  He leaned forward, bracing his elbows on his knees.  “How're you really feeling?”
“I’ll find you right away, Mr. Stark.”  She looked at the bill, her teeth digging into her lower lip.  “You already gave the whole staff a tip, Mr. Stark, I’m happy to-”
“Yeah, well, I have faith in your skills, and also the fact that you buy yout t-shirts at least a size too small.” Tony moved towards the walk-in.  “A habit I appreciate more than you could possibly know.”
She made the sign of the cross, rough fingers flicking across her body like a bird’s wings.  “A right blessing, that man was,” she said.  “Patient as a Saint, too, took him near to forever to get me to talk to him.”  She gave Steve a chiding look.  “Man shows up with a load of food and claims you sent him, and you didn’t say a word about it?  I think I can be forgiven for taking that with a grain of salt.”
Tony shifted, his face twisting in sleep, and without thinking, Steve reached over, stroking a hand over his hair.  Tony relaxed, his lips parting in a soft, almost inaudible sigh.
The door opened, and Natasha slipped inside.  “Well, I hadn’t been planning to before, but now I’m having second thoughts,” she said as Rhodey choked on a laugh.  Her lips twitched. “Mr. Stane, your car has arrived.”
“Why do you knock?” Tony asked him, going back to his work with a smile.  “Why do you always knock?”
"Wow," Tony said.  "Wow.  That was, that wasn't even GOOD lying.  That was bad lying, that was pathetic lying, that was just sad, that's what that was, Sue, give me that before he poisons you."
Tony wrapped an arm around Peter’s shoulders.  “It absolutely was,” he said.  “Rhodes.  Lead on.”  He felt a laugh bubbling up in his chest.  “The night’s short and-” He plucked the fifty out of Peter’s hand.  “Parker’s buying.“
“You like to drink alone,” she said, pulling his hand away, “because then you can tell yourself that you’re the only one you’re hurting.”
"Technically, I printed that," Duck said, rolling his pen between his fingers. The light glinted across the worn silver finish. "You just wrote it."
Bill leaned in, his eyes narrowing as he studied Steve.  “Sure, Mr. Hogan,” he said at last.  He gave Steve a broad smile.  “Evening, Mr. Rogers.  You new on staff?”
“It wasn't paying attention to me, I figured I could sneak up on it, and then when I did, I wasn't really sure what to do about it, so...  Look, I'm alive, don't I get credit for being alive?”
He took it from her fingers.  “Okay,” he agreed, and popped it into his mouth.  It tasted good, but more than that, better than that, it tasted familiar.  He chewed with care, trying to draw the small taste out.  “Ed made a heart.”
“I think that Rhodes sat at the top of the stairs until morning, with a gun, just in case we went back up.  But he was the first one to come down.” Clint took the lid off of a jar.  “To find I’d made biscuits and sausage gravy, bacon and fried potatoes, a pan of scrambled eggs and a pot of beans.  He stood there, staring at the two of us, because Nat was elbow deep in a pile of bread dough, and I was stirring porridge over at the stove.”
Clint considered that and raised the smiling little sheep to his lips.  “I think they got it from the Chia Pet people,” he said.  “It’s hollow, and there’s this hole in the top so you can fill it with water, but-”
"You know, if we ever end up not being able to make ends meet, we could probably fund all of our super hero antics by starting a part-time moving company."
“It's all right, there's an officer of the law here,” Stark said, hooking a thumb in Steve's direction.  “Officer Rogers, Miss Van Dyne, one of our dinner companions for the evening.”
DJ raised his head, just far enough to look at Steve.  His eyes were red, but dry.  He didn’t reply.
“Coulson, or Rogers?” Tony asked.  “The former, I have no idea, and I’m happier not knowing.”  He let his eyes float closed, finding his way through the interior of the prototype by touch.  “As to the other…”
He started the coffee brewing before opening the minibar.  There were a variety of unfamiliar tins and packages lined up on the shelves, small packets of cheese and crackers, fancy chocolates and local delicacies.  He was actively considering opening the mixed nuts when the coffee pot beeped, the last of the coffee hissing into the pot.
“Things I already knew how to do when I went in, and when I came out,” Tony said.  He picked up a wrench from the workbench, just to keep himself from punching something.   “And as I improved the armor, it's likely someone realized they already had a lot of the building blocks.  Not the arc reactor.  Not the power source.  But a lot of what makes the armor functional?” His head bobbed in a slight nod.  “They already had it.  And there was nothing stopping them from using it.”
“I know.” Steve pushed some of the tools out of the way, clearing a spot for his arms.  “This is-”  He picked up a chunk of the armor, turning it over in his hands.  He gave DJ a glance, one eyebrow arching.  “Dad’s making improvements again, isn’t he?”
He opened the door to the roof, stepping out into the sunshine.  The wind whipped past, and he reached into his pocket for his sunglasses.  “You don't know,” he said.  “She's out there.  Doing things.  You have no idea what those things are.”  He slipped them onto his nose.  “You should get on that, Potts.”
"Shoes are horrible," DJ told him, and Pepper lost it, laughing so hard that she had to brace a hand on Tony's back to keep herself upright.
“In a way.” Tony pointed his fork at DJ, and paused, his train of thought temporarily derailed.  “What…  What are you eating?”
“Good to know.  Next time, schedule your food truck festival when I don't have DJ for the weekend and I'll come with you.”
His fist caught the gunman square in the jaw, lifting him right off of the pavement and sending him crashing to the ground.
“She’s not wrong,” Natasha said, walking past with a stack of dishes balanced on one hand.  She hooked Clint’s collar with one finger and turned him around.  “Look on the positive side, Chef, if he breaks it completely, you’ll get a fancy new one to play with.”
She blinked at him, her big brown eyes framed by truly impressive fake lashes.  “What...  Are potato nachos?” she asked, the fur stole around her shoulders slipping down her arms.
His mouth felt dry and spongy, and he wondered if he could stagger to the bathroom without opening his eyes.  He was pretty sure he could.  He wasn't sure if he wanted to.
“Want some?” Al asked. Ellen was pretty sure he hadn't been this animated since the first season finale of Great British Bakeoff. He held up the pot. “Enough for one more.”
Bobbi stepped up beside the car, one arm braced on the roof.  “Rogers.  If you don’t come back with us, we’re going to have a very different problem.”  Steve paused, his hand tightening on the strap of his shield.  Bobbi’s eyebrows arched.  “We can’t lie to him.”
Agatha’s eyebrows arched, her cup held in spindly fingers.  “I have.  That is why we’re here, my dear.”  She took a long sip, and lowered the cup to rest in her lap.  Her eyes reminded DJ of mercury, hard and sharp.  “Unlike you, I knew her.  I fought her.” Her fingers flexed against the cup, and it seemed to bend beneath her grip.  “I would recognize her.”  She set the cup aside, and reached for gnarled wooden cane leaning against the side of her chair.  It met her hand halfway.  “I did recognize her.”
“Dragons wear our shields on our backs at gatherings so that guards looking down from higher balconies can identify our clan affiliation,” Steve finished. “They are an adult dragon’s most important possession.”
“Wait! These are the triangle things in all those books! With the untranslatable names that always start and end with triangles!”
“You probably would.” Crystal agreed quietly from the circle of Pietro’s arms. “And you should likely hurry.”
“He listened when I talked… he never dismissed my opinions or talked over me, at least not at first.”
“Blue and red. Here,” Steve flipped through the folder pulling out a picture he’d drawn, and some others he’d printed out. “I love you in red, and I know you love me in blue.”
“мой красивый паук Мне нужна резервная копия” He yelled, before freezing, hands slowly raising. Steve decided to ignore that for now. He Shoved the door closed behind Alexi and locked it. Then he grabbed the suitcase that had fallen when he tackled Alexi and crawled over to where Clint was hovering over a Tony whose lips were slowly turning blue. He fumbled the lump of metal up out of the suitcase, and cursed at himself solidly as it took him three tries to get it to slot properly into the receptacle in Tony’s chest.
Tony woke to someone pounding on the inside of his head with a hammer. No, wait, that was his brain throbbing in time with some music that was WAY too loud. No, wait, it was just a hangover, the music was actually pretty quiet and he was in Steve’s bed again. At least he knew the way to the bathroom from there. He could not (unfortunately) scrub the inside of his skull, but judicious use of water DID make him feel a bit more human. Some kind person (probably Steve) had put his new hygiene supplies in the bathroom for him, along with a pile of folded clothing that Tony vaguely remembered buying. He staggered out towards the kitchen in search of coffee and was greeted by a familiar brunette and a strange red-head. Wanda was dressed in a bright scarlet kimono decorated with diagonal lines of white dots and flowers. The red head was wearing a soft green kimono sprinkled in fall leaves. Both women had their hair up in buns, and the red head was doing Wanda’s nails.
“Sit and drink. Let the fact that you aren’t there anymore sink in. Would you like me to talk? Or Count?”
“It was a terrible childhood, I guess. I never really thought about it like that until later. I understood that it was terrible for my parent who stayed, but I never had anything else to compare it too?  I do know that most dragons complain about their years as a squire, all hardwork and study, but I never understood the complaints… I guess they just didn’t have worse to compare it too.”
"It's good to see you awake. I was worried about you when I found you unconscious in this weather. We'll be at the hospital in about 15 minutes."
“I’ve been enjoying it,” Tony replied. “I had no idea Olympia was considered scandalous at the time.”
“Do we need to help with the humans out front?” Nat asked, saving Tony from his bought of introspection.
“Oh… Well I don’t want a divorce, ever. That’s the point of getting married isn’t it? But I shouldn’t ever be the one running Stark industries either. So, whatever paperwork you need I’m fine with.” Steve replied.
“My shoes…” Tony wiggled his toes, realizing that his shoes had vanished along with his suit. His feet were currently in thick cotton socks and nothing else.
“I was very happy with Rachel, right up until I was very not happy with Rachel. For someone who spent all her time talking about consent she really didn’t have a good grasp of the concept.”
Tony flicked his wings out to their full extension, enjoying how the wind felt in feathers, then twisted his head around on his long neck so that he could see Phil sitting near the opening to the trillium hall. “How do we do this?” he asked curiously while he admired the iridescent colors the sunlight was pulling out of the feathers that had seemed black to his human eyes. Would a human see any of these colors in the sunlight, or would Phil always look plain to them?
“So, we need to get it out of him by giving it to someone who was born human while in the process of turning them into a human-dragon hybrid?” Tony asked excitedly. “Can I volunteer?”
“Too busy with art school, and anyway, everything I can cook I got from recipes on the internet. Neither Clint nor I could do more than boil water for Ramen when we started trying to be independent.”
“Nat,” said the dragon whose delicately detailed black trimmed with white wing feathers merged so smoothly into a black mask and a white throat.
“She’s under a lot of stress, she’s worried about her sister. I know all about worrying about sisters.” The guy with the bleached hair must be Pietro then, Tony thought. That must make the older looking blond with the amazing biceps Clint.
“We should introduce you lot to the Howling Commandos.” Steve replied thoughtfully. "I don’t want people panicking when they see dragons who aren’t me flying… unless you aren’t planning on staying?”
“He turns his hearing aid off at night. You could have wrestled an elephant in there without waking him. I’ve only woken him on accident twice, and I’ve been assured my nightmares are rather noisy.”
"Oh, uh I'm Steve. One of the three guys with a truck? More of a cargo van really. I live in a two bedroom with my partners, Clint and Pietro, and with Pietro's sister Wanda."
“I don’t know… uh… the hotel really had everything we would have needed. It’s just that Rumi isn’t going to get here until evening and I needed something to do with myself. I wanted a distraction, not just sitting around my hotel room working and drinking. That’s the old me, you know? I’m trying to… be different? I do need to get my suit back from the dry cleaner before they close. If you come with I could give you your clothes back?”
“Not too bad,” said the woman who must be Crystal. “The guy was very drunk, and passed out mid scream before anyone else at the bar decided to get involved.”
“Oh. Yeah. Of course it’s a yes Steve. Did you really doubt that?” Tony asked in return, while losing his battle with the tears.
“Oooh! We should give them a full tour Steve! I bet Phil would love to see the Library, and the Nursery!” Tony exclaimed, then proceed to drag the rest of the newcomers around the Lair, while Steve excused himself to go start on Nat’s room.
“Steve!” Tony jumped and spun, clear startlement and distress in his face and eyes. Unsure of the cause, Steve moved immediately to soothe it.
Tony wakes cradled in Steve’s arms to the sound of someone pounding on the door. An argument about their next steps bouncing across the room from where Steve is tucked in a corner to where Clint is hovering next to the door.
“Hey babe!” He announced cheerfully as he wandered in. Tony didn’t SEEM to be in any sort of danger. He was fully dressed and awake seeming, going through one of the file folders Steve kept in the desks.
“Really, I’m a big fan of the impressionists,” Wanda was saying thoughtfully as Tony worked with the coffee machine. “Not just the art, but the attitude. I mean, the major art critics of their time rejected them, rejected most living artists, according to Steve, and instead of giving up, or accepting that, they pooled their resources and put together their own exhibition. They questioned everything about the world they were trying to get a foothold in, from their fixation on historical paintings and landscapes to the way the only existing major gallery of the time worked. Steve told me once that that was why so many of their works ended up in collections outside of France.”
With Clint gone the rest of the group looked at each other tiredly and silently agreed that he had the right idea. Wanda headed back to her room while Pietro walked Crystal home and told Steve not to wait up for him. Only Tony, Steve and Lucky remained on the couch, Tony idly scratching the dog’s ears as Lucky lolled indolently in his lap. “So,” Tony eventually sighed. “What now?”
“So how did something so fundamental to dragon reproduction become lost?” The red head asked with some confusion.
“I’d kinda rather if everyone gathered here. I was going to call Crystal when I was done on the phone with you.”
“While that does sound like good advice, it means I would have to find someone I wanted to be ridiculous and embarrassing with. Have any suggestions?”
Sorry this is a bit late. I had some technical difficulties over the weekend, so you get this on Thursday instead.
“Anyway, I turned up on Clint’s doorstep later that day carrying everything I owned that mattered to me. He let me cry on him for a while, then told me I deserved better.”
“Say that it is a private matter.” Steve disagreed. “No human has ever asked me for more information after I responded like that. Eggs, hatchlings and fledglings are clan business only, and we don’t talk about them outside of the lair.”
“The authorities never do appreciate someone pointing out that they might be wrong, do they.” The red-head said with a thoughtful blink. “I didn’t know any of that about their history… I just always loved Summertime by Mary Cassat. That was the painting that first got me interested in art.”
“Hey Rumi, What are you up to this week? I stumbled across this resort village, hearts and flowers, really romantic place, made me think of you. I know we haven’t had much time together since that whole debacle in Afghanistan. Wanna hang out in a Martini glass shaped hot tub and get reacquainted?”
“So that rude man isn’t your father?” Steve’s relief was obvious and palpable. Tony didn’t have the heart to tell him that Obie was usually better to deal with than Howard.
“So how was your childhood so unusual that it caused political unrest?” Nat asked. From his position under Steve’s wing Tony felt the larger dragon tense, then start to relax with some gentle nuzzling.
“But how dare she gaze so brazenly out from the canvas?” Steve asked, causing all three of the others to snicker.
“Clint’s idea is sound.” Steve decided. “I’ll help you up to the ladder, then I’ll watch the back door while Wanda watches the front. Pietro, take a slow loop around the building to see if there are any marks in the snow showing where someone might have been drug off towards some other building, then keep an eye on Wanda and I so no one gets confused if the situation changes.
“Tony’s car broke down.” Steve told the rest of the room firmly. “I told him he could stay here tonight. In the morning we’ll go over to Joey’s to get his car towed and fixed.”
“I can see that. Monet’s pieces are beautiful, but until I met Steve I really didn’t know anything about impressionism beyond…well, let’s just say that the idea of wearing a bright red kimono like Madame Monet would never have occurred to me.”
“It didn’t work at all.” Phil replied. “They spent decades with your clan home abandoned while the whispering and rumors of corruption grew, and were certain enough of their might to invite representatives of all the other clans to the renaming, when the old medallion was torn down and the new placed. As soon as the cavern was claimed by its new owners the caverns rang with noise, as if we were hearing every scrape of metal on rock since the first tunnel was excavated, then a thundering roar as if every dragon who had ever lived there screamed the word murderer at the same time. The caverns shook as if in the throes of a massive earthquake and many hallways and balconies collapsed under the strain. When it was over, and we all dug ourselves out, it was revealed that every book and treasure which had been stored there in its centuries of habitation had vanished without a trace. I was still a squire at the time, but I asked my Knight if he still had faith in the judgement of the high council when even the stones we walked on were wise enough to see the corruption of their decisions. The fact that none of the elders of any of the clans called for an investigation of
“Not really. Pietro and Wanda like to angst over whatever the X-men are doing, but only when Steve isn’t around.”
“How would that WORK?” asked Tony, who had spent more time than he cared to admit to anyone studying Steve’s books on dragon anatomy, before deciding that there was really no possibility of him and Steve moving passed cuddling.
The back door opened silently once he moved the bar, and Steve was right outside as he had promised. Pietro popped around the corner a second later and Clint tried to explain the situation as quickly and concisely as possible.
“No. It’s his business partner. Obie was kind of any uncle to me… the kind of uncle who is creepy now, and was really into me when I was young enough to be delighted by his attention since I had nothing healthy to compare it to.”
“It’s OK to not be fine.” Steve soothed as he guided Tony to sit on the bed. “It’s OK to not like any of my ideas too, if that’s what you’re stressing about.”
“That guy who’s been staying with you guys for the last few days just got kidnapped!” Crystal gasped for breath, clearly having run for the apartment. “Some guy dressed in black and yellow like a ninja from one of those kung fu movies you love grabbed him from behind and shoved him into a van. I tried to call the police while I followed them out to the summer community center, but they acted like I was making things up! And I couldn’t call you guys! Where is your phone?”
“Hey man, You need a hand with that? Or maybe a ride?” Tony looked up from his collection of bags, at a familiar van, and a familiar blue eyed driver.
“The collapse of the ancient caverns and the relocation of the clan treasures to your location proves beyond any shadow of a doubt that you are the proper heir to the title and that their acceptance of the interruption of your trial by combat was a dishonor on every clan leader who accepted it. A murder sits in a clan seat that should be yours, and no dragon can deny that the ancient laws have been violated.” Phil explained. Tony whistled a soft surprised sound, and Phil looked at him in startlement. “Did he never tell you how he came to leave?”
Steve was perched on a stool next to the kitchen counter, one foot on the floor and one wrapped around the supports, diligently scribbling away at his attempt to artistically reproduce the fruit arrangement sitting in front of him. He’d just growled Clint away from his oranges for the third time, and he was very aware of how limited a time he would be able to work with the unaltered arrangement in front of him.
Tony slid into what he hoped was his seat, (There was a salad on the placemat and it was harder to get to the kitchen from there) while Steve stripped off his apron and brought the rest of the food over. “New car?” he asked.
“I’m not sure I’ve ever even visited a place as small as Valentine before. How did you end up here?”
“About an hour? We don’t know exactly when he dosed you… but it’s been a little longer than that since he grabbed you.” Steve replied. “How are you feeling?”
“Tony? Is something wrong?” Steve’s voice held both an edge of worry and a slight slur of sleepiness. Tony turned, pressing his face into the warm, soft, dark place under Steve’s wing, not even sure why he was trying to hide from the proof that so many of his dreams truly HAD come true yesterday.
As Steve drove Tony started being able to smell smoke as well. Shortly thereafter they could both SEE the smoke tainting the pale gray winter sky with a column of darkness. It was obvious that they were getting closer to the fire as they traveled and it became obvious why as they failed to be able to pull into the lot in front of the hotel. The lot was instead completely full of hotel guests, staff, emergency crews and fire fighters. Tony’s hotel belched smoke into the sky as Tony jumped from the van to race over to the crews, desperate to find out if Rumiko had arrived without telling him, completely forgetting Steve, the van and his shopping in his haste.
Tony was in the repair shop making a list of replacement parts he was going to need when his new phone arrived. He left off the depressing work of examining the damage to his favorite car in order to make a few phone calls. If anyone had been paying attention they would know he made two calls before texting his list to Pepper and heading out to make himself hotel reservations.
It was significantly later in the day when when Steve was driving past the Stop-and-Shop and slowed down near the corner.
“Yeah, I think my birth family must have celebrated it… umm... before? Sometimes I find things that my hands seem to know how to do, even though I don’t remember learning. Making Brigid’s crosses is one of those things. Fun. Soothing. That’s how I found you on the road, actually. I decided to hang some of the crosses out at the pavilion where Clint’s students gather. It’s closed for the winter, of course… uh, don’t tell anyone I was sneaking out there in February, Please?”
“Not two, just you.” Steve said as he slipped an arm around Tony’s waist and steered him towards the door.
The blond man hadn’t spoken yet, his hands fidgeting with a bag between his feet. He hopped out of the cart now, walking over to Steve as if he wasn’t the slightest bit intimidating. He whispered something in Steve’s ear, and wasn’t it interesting that he knew enough about dragons to know exactly where Steve’s ear was. Steve jerked back, startled, glanced at the covered bed of the farm wagon, and then looked over at Dugan. “Would one of you mind taking this horse down to the pasture with yours? I need to take this cart inside for a bit.” The Commandos looked as startled by this pronouncement as Tony felt, but Jim Morita stepped forward to take the horse from the red head who was already unharnessing it. Steve snagged the front of the cart with one set of claws and backed calmly through the doors of his lair dragging the cart right along with him. The red-head and the blond followed, and when it looked like Obie might take that as an invitation Tony firmly closed and barred the doors behind them. The red head glanced around, but seemed unsurprised by Tony’s presence. The blond only had eyes for the cart.
The arc reactor burned, it felt hot, it ached.  He tried to breathe, and he could feel it pressing in on his ribcage, could feel it pressing in on his spine, as if it was part of him, as if it was going through him, and he knew his hands were on it, covering it, clawing at it, and he.  Could.  Not.  Breathe.
He rotated one shoulder, almost a shrug.  “Better than he should be, even coming off the front lines of France and Germany.  More of a concern, he’s faster than he should be, and he knows he’s being watched.”
From the bathroom, there was silence, and then the rattle of the shower starting up.  Steve's eyes flicked up towards the ceiling.  “Do you need help?” he called, dropping the phone back onto Tony's jacket.
“I really don’t care if I disappoint you,” Tony said, and even he could tell that was a lie.  He narrowed his eyes at Jarvis.  “I am in charge of this house.”
“It’s food, Steve,” Tony said, scooping broccoli, green and crisp, into the steamer basket.  “Not that complicated.
“So you’ve said.  Several times since you walked in,” Harris said.  He offered the Goldfish to Tony, who considered them with narrowed eyes.  Harris jiggled the bag.  “Jesus, you rich twit, just eat the damn crackers.”
Bobbi paused, her gloves gripped in one hand.  "Think I saw you come in," she said with a smile, bracing her fists on her hips.  "How long ago did Bruce leave to wash his hands?"
“Keep at me, and I'll go fetch Hammer back instead of Seamus,” Steve said, and before Tony could come up with a reply to that, he turned, heading through the crowd. “Stay here.”
“Not hiding.” Steve fished the washcloth out of the bucket of bleach water, running it across the tabletop with careful precision.  “Recess.”
He skidded around the corner, only to stop short, his heart in his throat.  Tony was sprawled out on the floor, his shoulders braced against a cabinet, his face pale and damp with sweat.  A glass lay on the floor, just out of reach, water splashed across the tile.
DJ shook his head, and Peter grinned at him.  “You’ll love it.  I used to go more when I was your age, there was an old nickelodeon near where we lived in Queens, and my uncle’d give me a few dimes, an’ I’d stay there all day.”
“I think I’ll stick to the terms of our agreement,” Steve said.  He dipped his head in a slight nod. “Appreciate your time, ma’am.”
She didn’t say who ‘he’ was, but Bucky pushed himself upright, his face set.  “I’m fine,” Steve said, but Bucky passed him as well, the heavy strap of his rifle thrown over his shoulder.  Steve shook his head.  “I don’t-”
Bucky peered out at Steve from under the curtain of his hair.  "Rude," he said at last, and Steve grabbed a pillow, smacking him on the head with it.  "Ow!"  Bucky rubbed his head.  "Jesus.” He scowled up at Steve.  “What the hell?"
“We need plates,” Bruce said, the words a little too close together, a little too rushed.  “I’ll go get some.”  And before Tony could do anything more than draw a breath, Bruce was through the door and gone, slipping into the elevator doors before Jarvis could get them closed.
“No, no,” Rhodey mumbled, frowning down at the page.  “He might be onto something here, if we can just-”
“If you say so, sir,” Jarvis said, and Stark looked up at the ceiling, his expression that of a man praying for patience.  Rhodes was bent forward, his head buried in his folded arms.  DJ, taking advantage of the distraction, was digging through the toolbox with a great deal of enthusiasm.  Jarvis caught his hand, pulling it away with a warm smile.  “Be careful, please.”
Steve nodded, and his thumb was sweeping back and forth, against the center of Tony’s palm.  “What do you want from me?”
“Let’s just say, more than we’d like,” Tony’s guard said, his arms still crossed over his chest.  “Agent Coulson?”
Cynthia nodded.  "They're staying with me.  Mom and dad are still very much in their life, but I can cope with this, a little better than they can, so until they get their heads out of their asses..."  She gave Steve a puckish smile.  "I get to deal with a teenager."
“And that’s something I always support,” Steve said.  “I just like to…” He gave Tony a lopsided smile.  “Be there to support it.”
"You did not think this through at all, did you?" he asked, and the laughter was there, just beneath the surface, bubbling through every word.  Rogers gave him a suspicious look, and Tony grinned at him.  "You saw a way to call my bluff and you took it, and you did not really think that you'd have to do this, did you?"
“Three to be signed today, four more that need Mr. Stane to look them over before we can move forward,” she said, taking it from him.  She flicked through the pages, her eyes narrowed behind the lenses of her glasses.  “You missed an initial.”
“I didn’t actively swear or throw anything,” Tony said.  “So I could also have been worse.”  He was flipping through holographic folders, pulling out diagrams and schematics, setting up columns of numbers all around him, like a wall, like a cage.  “Which you know.”
Rogers walked the perimeter of the room, checking the windows and ducking to look under the desk, under the vanity table.  Tony, leaning against the wall next to the door, gave Pepper a curious look.  She shrugged.  “Officer Rogers?” she asked, as he crouched down, looking under the bed.
“First of all, yes, I am, I have a good dozen magazines that I subscribe to simply because at one point or another they did, in fact, put that in print, and second of all, this is more sarcasm than I'm used to handling from you on the average day,” Tony said.  The gel inside the test tube threatened to boil over, and he fumbled for a pair of tongs.
Laughing, Steve pushed himself upright.  “Luckily,” he said, grabbing the hem of Tony's shirt, “I'm a pro at getting you naked.  Arms up.”
“Let’s keep looking,” she said, letting Clint take his unicorn back.  “I’m sure we’ll find it, soon enough, okay?”
“No!  I drained my retirement account for this!” Darcy said, laughing.  She fended him off with a hand, and ducked to the side.  It was early enough that there weren’t many people wandering the room yet, leaving her plenty of room to maneuver.  But Clint was taller than her, with a longer reach, and a complete lack of morals.
“They're going to,” Logan said.  “Every time they do, they scare the ones they want to scare, and attract the ones they want to attract.”
May poked Stane with her foot, then gave him a sharp, hard kick.  He didn’t move.  “He’s still breathing,” she said, and she sounded almost disappointed by that.
Clint folded his hands in front of him, his eyes wide.  “I…  Might’ve done another video.  After everyone left.”
“Yes, well, he sat on the staircase for an excessive amount of time, waiting for you to come and say good-bye, which, due to your exceptionally poor upbringing, you didn’t bother to do,” Jarvis said..  “I made your excuses, but I will not be doing that again; let us see if you can’t improve your manners before he returns as well.”
“I mean, I tried to take Stephen Strange off of the guest list and you made me put him back,” Tony pointed out.
“Yeah.”  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Stark look out the passenger window, his head turning away, making sure their eyes couldn’t meet.  “But if he’d been asked, and if he’d answered, would that have thought he was telling the truth?  Did he have any idea that he was lying?  Or-”  A faint shrug.  “Or did he honestly think he was a good father?”
“He's clever, not modest,” Rogers said, reaching out to ruffle DJ's hair.  “Too late for swimming, today, it's almost dinner.  You've wasted all day tinkering, and now we've only got an hour or so before we have to get cleaned up and dress for dinner.”
“The market’s open from sun up to sun down.  Vendors show up when they can, leave when they’re done for the day.  Most spots are inherited, passed on in family lines.  Everyone knows where their place is, and they don’t need us to set the boundaries; if someone steps out of line, the rest’ll put them in their place.”
He seemed somehow small.  Or smaller than Steve thought of him as being.  Without the armor, or maybe more importantly, without the force of his brilliant, oversized personality, he seemed almost slight.  Fragile.  He fit in Steve's arms, and he shouldn't.  He was all heat, and energy, and fierce, sharp movement.
DJ scrambled to his feet, heading back towards them at a run.  There were blades of grass clinging to his clothes and in his hair, and he’d lost his shoes somehow, but Tony didn’t seem to notice, or care.  He just caught DJ’s hand in his as he went sprinting past, slowing him down to a jog.  “Hungry?”
Tony’s eyebrows arched.  “Considering how long it took them to realize that,” he mused, “then I have to question if they’ve actually been paying attention.”
One of Tony’s hands slipped free of the fabric of his shirt, coming up to stroke along the line of Steve’s jaw.  “You said.  Before the war.  Art school,” he repeated, his head tipping to the side.
“This way,” Tony said, his voice tight, and Steve fell into step behind him, hovering a little too close for comfort, but unable to convince himself to back off.  For his part, Tony didn’t object.
Obie stood.  “No one is coming to save you, Anthony.  You’ve sent half your people away, and the ones that are left?  Aren’t going to save you.”  He raised the gun, pointing it at Tony’s face.  “Up.  We’re going to go for a little ride.”
"Though your New York is much to my liking as of late," Odinson said, and before Rogers could realize what was happening, Odinson had grabbed his hand, his grip strong and solid without being painful.  He grinned, his face open and full of warmth.  "How do you do, my friend?"
"That it is."  Tony drained the rest of his coffee and tossed the cup back on the workbench.  He slid down off of his stool, stretching his arms over his head.  Everything ached, and he set his hands at the small of his back, trying to work out the kinks in his spine.  "All right, my flatfooted friend, you win."
The spike of rage caught him off guard.  Tony squeezed his eyes shut, words caught behind his clenched teeth.  He set his cup down.  “Right.  Everything’s a fucking joke.”
Obie looked down the length of his nose at him.  “I’ve brought two dozen men from the factory and the warehouses,” he said, his voice flat.  “They’ve been stationed at the gates and around the grounds.”
“Fine, I'll yell for help if I get in over my head, you can come save me.”  He stepped back, tugging his arm out of Steve's fingers.  “Think of yourself as backup, Cap.”
Peter made a pained squeaking sound.  “I did!” he said, holding his hands up in a pose of surrender.  “I…  I did!  After we put you in the shower to sober up!  I went back and pulled up the camera file and deleted the most recent video!”
"No," Tony said, and Steve started to laugh.  Tony pinned him with a withering glare.  "No.  Absolutely not.  That database is packed to the gills with Jess's recordings of 'Project Runway'-"
"Growing pains," Ed said, heating milk with a wide grin.  "I spent the summer I turned thirteen in the fetal position, hating every bone in my body.  Growth spurts are a bitch."  He tamped down the grounds with a sideways flick of his wrist.  DJ braced himself against flinching as the machine let out a high pitched whine that only ever seemed to bother him.  Ed never even seemed to notice, despite his proximity to the machine.  Maybe he was used to it, as unlikely as that seemed to DJ.
DJ wasn’t sure if it was hunger or stress or fear or something else.  He didn’t suppose it mattered much.  He shifted in his seat, his arms wrapped tight around his backpack, clinging to the armor like a lifeline.  Outside the windows of the car, the city flew past.  But at every street light and every stop sign, he found himself scanning the buildings, looking desperately for anything he could recognize.
But the city reached out, roads stretched like fingers, to draw him in.  To draw him home.  When they had crossed the broad old stone bridge that hung over the river, Nomad had fallen easily into the flow of traffic, of merchants and pilgrims, of workmen on carts and farmhands carrying their burdens on their backs.   No one spared him more than a glance, and with each step, Steve felt the strain bleed out of him.
“I did not bother to try,” she said, as Shuri set the package down and unwrapped it, pushing the cloth aside.  Beneath the folds, a familiar red, white, and blue curve of metal appeared.
“Tiny bit,” Tony said, and Steve hit him with the pillow.  Tony gave him a look.  “Excuse me, who invited you to this conversation, Cap?”
Steve snapped his fingers in an exaggerated gesture.  “Aw, shucks.  Golly gee, Mr. Stark, sir, I knew we were forgetting something.”
His hands were in fists at his sides, his muscles so tense that they were shaking.  He took a breath, forcing his fingers to relax with a force of will.  “Did I do okay?”  She looked at him, her eyes going wide, and Steve met her gaze without flinching.  “With him, I mean.”
Tony nodded.  “Fine.  Stay.  See if I care,” he said.  “You’ll be gone soon enough.  Story of my life.  Everyone leaves.  Everyone...”  He rocked back, his shoulders shaking with muted laughter.  He was almost certain it was laughter.  “Fuck.  Gone.  Gone.”
“She would drag your corpse out on the stage, so I'd recommend against going that route,” she said, moving towards the door.  “Behave yourselves, boys.  Don't do anything stupid in the five minutes while I'm gone.”
Ahead of him, the other car skidded on the road, sliding sideways, tires churning up clouds of dust as it came to a shuddering stop.  Steve’s teeth locked in place, refusing to hope, refusing to think.  He rolled his shoulder, swinging the shield into place on his arm, his fingers locked on the grip.
“Bagel,” DJ said, drawing the word out.  He stumbled to his feet, gathering up his bedding in his arms, hugging the heaps of fabric.  “Cheese?”
Tony reached up, dragging Steve down.  “It’s almost like you missed me,” he whispered, just barely able to see Steve grin.
"No.  I am sure you are concerned about him and his well being, but you also simply accept that he is as he is.  At the moment, I do not believe he has control over his physical state, and the lack of control has made an already stressful situation worse.  He needs reassurance, not the additional stress that comes with admitting something is wrong to sir or Steve."
Steve, for his part, just turned on his heel and stalked towards the front door.  In a matter of moments, he was gone, leaving Tony staring after him in impotent rage.  He took a breath, and another, one hand going to his ribs.  He shook his head, and Clint took an instinctive step back.  Tony looked up, catching a glimpse of them and his face went tight.  “Does no one in this household have anything to do?” he said. “Or am I now just paying for a full Greek chorus to accompany my life?”
“I…  Forgot something,” Bruce said, and he was such a painfully bad liar that hearing him try gave Tony a headache every time.
Sue took a step in that direction, her body bending at the waist, her head tilting down.   She steadied herself with one hand on the top of the workbench as she checked around the edge, her head swinging first one way, then the other.  Her eyes narrowed.  There was no one there.
Tony shrugged, already rolling his sleeves back down.  “Simple fix.  Come back when you need something more substantive done.”  He hopped off of his stool.  “After all, you never asked me to fix it.”
“I-” Bruce stopped.  Set the coffee cup down on the table.  “This game we’re playing is hard enough when we know where all the pieces are,” he said, and everyone went silent.  He looked around, blinking nervously behind the crooked frames of his spectacles.  “Let alone who’s moving them.”
Obie burst out laughing.  "It's true, I don't," he said.  He looked back at Tony.  "Remember, we decided that you were going to take in an orphan for a week?"
She pointed her pencil in his direction, her head still bent over her ledger.  “That’s nice of you,” she said.
Ellen paused.  “I think,” she said, very slowly and carefully, “that if we had gotten sued, then Duck would've called you to scream at you.  A lot.”
Steve grinned at the coffee machine, which was halfway through its brewing cycle.   “Could you let Nat and Bruce know that I'm making eggs and bacon?” he asked.  He pulled open the fridge door, peering into the depths.  “See if they're interested.”
“Fair enough.” The young man smiled, and Steve’s mouth was dry, and he didn’t know why.  “This is Mr. Pym, the proprietor of this fine establishment,” he said, gesturing at the clockmaker, who didn’t acknowledge the comment.  “I’m Tony, his ever humble apprentice..” Pym let out a laugh that was almost a bark, and Tony smiled.  “And I’ll be fixing your watch today.”
Clint didn’t look up from the map.  “No,” he said.  “Have you met me?  I’m surprised anyone respects me.  Like.  At all.”
“Wonderful, looking forward to unwrapping the box of half broken metal scraps that you’ve glued together,” Tony said, and strangely enough, that wasn’t even sarcasm.  He couldn’t remember the last time he’d anticipated a gift this much.  “Before that, though, I’m going to need you to decorate the house.”
“Come on,” Sam said, swinging his gym bag to bump hers.  “We can go hide in the gym and actually spar.”
“I’m certain I don’t know, sir,” Jarvis said, and Tony braced himself for the familiar sound of his curtains being drawn back, and the painful flood of light that was sure to follow.  “I’ve brought your-”
“Safe.”  He exhaled, and his breath curled in front of him, like the air had gone cold in an instant.  “Somewhere safe,” he said, and his fingers were burning, right down to the bone.
“He swears up and down that no one’s missing,” she said.  “At this point, I’d believe him.  They don’t know what happened, but they know that fire was deliberately set and they know we’re looking for something.”  She reached up, brushing her hair out of her face, and there was soot on her arm, black against her pale skin.  “Most of them probably think something’s been stolen.”
The 'ceremony' was mercifully short.  The 'priest' said a few words, pressed a gentle palm to Steve's forehead, then Tony's.  Tony resisted the urge to lunge for the edge of the stage as the priest gestured at Steve.  Steve, grinning, said, “I do.”
That was met with silence, and after a moment, Tony glanced up to find Peter smiling at him.  “It’s worked out okay for me,” he said.
Mel drew a Tony who looked like he'd been around, and most of his ink was suggested by me, but has since been refined in my mind. 8)
Her eyebrows arched.  “Well, are you planning to do that?”  She hooked an arm through his.  “Come on.  We're going to go stretch.”
“You're never going to be forgotten.  You're never going to get left behind.  Someone is always going to be coming for you.  I promise you.  Someone is always going to come for you.”
Bucky gave him a hard look, but Sam was already moving towards the door.  He pushed it open, stepping aside so that Shuri, T’Challa, and finally Steve could enter as well.  Only after Bucky reluctantly stepped inside as well did he push the door shut with a firm, and final click.
Hank made a frustrated sound, shoving a hand through his hair.  It flopped right back into his eyes.  He didn’t seem to notice.  “You really think that flirting is better?”
He pointed a finger at DJ.  “Illogical punishment number one.  Go over there-” His hand cut through the air, pointing at the other side of the car.  “Cover your ears.  And hum.”
“I have that same song set as a ringtone for a certain very annoying archer.”  She slipped the phone out of Harris’ fingers, and he let her take it.  “I’d say, what’re the odds of that?”  Her eyes tipped up to meet his.  “Except he put it there.  And he’s a great one for repeating his jokes.”
“My father built this place, I think, as an apology,” he said, his voice quiet.  “Sorry.  Sorry it’s cold.  Sorry it’s gray.  Sorry it’s so frightening.”  Sorry I’m not a better man.  He swallowed that, around the hard lump in his throat.  “He built her a house, an amazing, opulent, massive house, bigger than anyone else had, better, he hired craftsmen and artists and stone masons and painters, and he built her this house.”  Tony spread his hands above his head, gesturing at the mansion itself.  “He tried to make her something like what she’d left behind but…”  He smiled at DJ.  “His taste was not the best, I think.”
Tony was already shaking his head.  "No, he's-" His fingers rattled against the metal side of the smoothie cup, a smooth run up and down as he flexed each digit.  "He's staying here with us, for now."  The cup was set down with a very final sounding click.  "He doesn't leave the tower.  We can barely get him to leave the workshop, some days.  This is all he's known for a long time, and he has-"
“He is,” Sam said.  “Doesn’t mean that he isn’t going to complain about it.”  Bucky gave him a look, his eyes narrowed into slits, and Sam grinned at him, unconcerned.  “Yeah, you’re a real threat.”
“I bet he is.”  Steve did his best not to look at the shattered remains of the armor.  He hated it.  He always hated it.  Hated seeing Tony’s work destroyed.  Hated thinking of Tony being in it when it was.
He heard his voice, as if from a distance, as if it was someone else being an absolute idiot and all he could do was stand there and watch.  Because there was no way he’d be that dumb.  Not twice in one night.
Tony pressed a hand to his face.  “Jay, I do not give a damn about the china.  Did he break any bones?”
“Yeah, I figured you had no idea what was going on,” Sam said.  “Or you would've kept it more...”  His eyebrows arched.  “Private.”
Sam nuzzled Abby's neck, and she made a sound that from anyone else, Tony would call a giggle.  From Chase, he was pretty sure it would be a growl.  Or something close.  But Sam pulled himself free.  “I've got this,” he said, smiling at Tony.  “Go.”
His mother took a seat across the table from him.  “And what might those be?” she asked, reaching for the teapot.
“Don't you 'ma'am' me, if you take a deep breath, every seam in that thing is going to split wide open, and while that might be amusing to watch, I couldn't possibly bear to see such a nice piece of clothing so abused,” she said, her fingers wiggling in front of him.  “Off.  With it.”
It was suddenly very hard to breathe.  “That’s…  Probably against at least a few sanitary guidelines,” he managed, and he sounded like a thirteen year-old boy who’s voice wasn’t quite sure what octave it was going to settle into.
"We are here," he said, his voice very soft and very controlled, "because part of being fine is getting adequate medical treatment when things go wrong."  He was pale, his lips tight and dark circles etched beneath his eyes, but his gaze was steady, his grip strong.  "So if it helps you to say, 'everyone will be fine' as opposed to 'everyone is fine,' than that's fine, too, we can do that, we can work with that, but you.  Need.  To.  Calm.  Down."
"I've got it," Rogers said, his voice right next to Tony's ear.  His fingers slid under Tony's hand, nudging him out of the way.  "What are you trying to do?"
Tony pointed at them.  “You two.  Not to be trusted.  Inherently untrustworthy.  I'm watching you.”  As Val giggled, and Franklin rolled his eyes, Tony looked at DJ.  “Check in.”
“If you ever meet the muscle, things have gone very, very wrong,” Natasha said from the front seat.  The motor rumbled as the car accelerated.  “Let’s hope we don’t get to that point.”
“All right, let’s just-”  He pressed, pushing Bucky backwards by a step or two.  “I’ll deal with the cat.”
“All right, maybe not, but I’d make him wear it, anyway,” Steve said.  “Is that why you’re working?  So you have money for presents?” DJ nodded, and Steve sighed.  “We just want you to be happy, buddy.  You don’t have to spend money on us.”
His apartment was small, tucked in an awkward corner of an old building, in an unfashionable neighborhood.  He was proud of it, because it was his, he'd earned it, and he'd built it into exactly what he wanted it to be.
“I never want to see food again,” Rhodey said.  “I don’t know what hurts more, my neck or my stomach.”
He stumbled forward one step, and another, his body swaying with every awkward movement.  But the light was there, just out of reach, coaxing him forward.  It rose and fell, it pulsed like music, like something, something very familiar-
“Damn right I did,” Darcy said.  She was wearing a tiny gold crown on a headband.  She held out an ornate, glittery headpiece of silver and paste jewels to DJ.  “Here you go, magpie, I got you the best one.”
When the final wave came, when it crashed over his head, when it swallowed him whole, it was never a surprise.
"The difference is," Sam said, cutting him off, "is that a therapist gets paid, and a friend's seen your sketchbooks."
Hammer was sitting at his desk, his spectacles crooked on his nose, a large, mostly empty bottle of brandy clutched in one hand, a glass in the other.  He barely flinched as Steve stepped into his office, his red rimmed eyes flicking up towards him, then back down to his drink.  “You here to arrest me?” he asked, his voice vibrating on the words.  “Or kill me?”
"Should've gone to the gym," Jan said with a smirk.  "But yes.  Everyone's got something."  She took the glasses out of Steve's hand and flipped them open.  "Tony spent his formative years at MIT.  He's got a thing for boys in glasses."  She slipped the glasses onto Steve's face.  "Ta-da!"
Steve made a sound that might’ve been a laugh.  “No,” he said.  He glanced at Rhodey, and his eyes were red.  “We’re not.” He shifted his bags, rolling his shoulder, and looked back at the stairs.  “Okay if I take the passenger seat up front with you?” When he looked back at Rhodey, he managed a thin smile.  “I was never comfortable in the back.”
It was a stupid response, and he knew it.  There was nothing up there.  Tony had tied the airspace around the tower in so much red tape that it'd take decades for even the federal government to get through it.  He and Rhodey were the only ones who circled this building regularly, and friends could come and go without triggering the defense systems.
Tony turned his attention to straightening the chessboard.  “Well, the Stark family has a tradition for what to do when that happens,” he mused.  “I think it’s called boarding school.”
Steve kissed the nape of his neck.  “We tried that, and you tried to sneak out in the middle of the night.  Stealing my pants,” he whispered.  “So now you get to be the small spoon.”
"Ah, speak of the angel, and he shall appear," Tony said, without even looking back.  He crooked a finger in Steve's direction.  “Come here.”
“So there were four high end hotels in the capitol and one's barely in the city limits.  I started with the closest one to the square and moved out.”
“I do not want to even think about how much time, money and effort it’s going to take to fix the armor,” Tony said.  He pushed his hair away from his face, and it flopped right back down over his forehead.  “Fucking Namor’s getting billed for every bit of it.”
“Yeah. They are pretty incompressible… Like that Shakespearean play we went to. Even when I recognized the words, I’m pretty sure they weren’t being used in the ways that I’m used to. Dum-E promised to scan them for me, and I was going to see if Jarvis couldn’t help me make sense of them.” Steve explained.
For the first time ever Steve’s apartment was quiet as Tony opened the door. Steve had given him his own key shortly after the kidnapping incident. The second kidnapping incident. The second kidnapping incident this year? The Ronin incident. Yeah. Let’s think about that one as the Ronin incident.
“It’s a surprise. Once you’re done eating you can go get settled on the couch and I’ll get our popcorn and snacks.”
“Mmm. Yeah. I watched some of your more recent press conferences after we met. I think what you are doing with your company is very brave.”
“Oh, Hey!” Tony scrambled out from under Steve’s wing so that he was in the full light brought to Steve’s room by mirrors from one of his hidden windows. “What colors am I!” He twisted his long neck around, hopping eagerly from foot to foot while trying to get his wings to do what he wanted. He seemed to transition from what he would have called bright red to a rich yellow gold, with a rich, deep line of long black feathers along the edge of his wing, and the flight feathers along his back legs.
“I am not doing the pose. I just want to watch a movie in peace.” Steve insisted, despite the hands covering his face the blush that had curled up his neck to turn the tips of his ears bright red was obvious.
“He had no interest in your nuptials? I can see that. The boy has always been completely self interested… he is rather like his father in that regard.”
"Yeah. We move stuff and do other odd jobs. Clint teaches archery at the State historical Park in the summer. This time of year everyone is working at the ski lodges and hotels."
“Oh. It would have taken an ambulance just as long to get to us as it would take me to get you to the hospital… And Clint has our cell phone today.”
“And hopefully eggs soon.” Tony murmured, unable to resist the opportunity. Steve didn’t disappoint, fluffing up so dramatically that the red on his crest was visible. He forced his feather flat, then twisted his head around running his cheek along Tony’s, then down Tony’s neck in a way that made him shiver and fluff in turn. Steve hissed out a long word/phrase in draconic that Tony was pretty sure was an admonishment against flirting in front of the humans. Behind them someone nearly choked trying to restrain an amused trill.
“No. I got a lot bigger when I became guardian of my third of the… what were they calling it? The Goober? I guess I could start teaching you draconic pronunciations.”
“Not at all. I built this courtyard for you rowdies. Camp here as often as you like.” Dugan and the rest of the troop nodded, and headed off to the side of the courtyard with the fireplace to start setting their tents up along the northern wall as usual. Steve seemed to like the commandos, and he’d lead them for  awhile, but none had ever been inside Steve’s lair. As far as Tony was aware he was the only human who had ever been allowed inside Steve’s lair.
It was the shout of triumph from the other side of the door that spurred the two men into motion. They rammed the door open and lunged into the room. Clint, going low, forced the table into Alexi’s gut while jerking Tony off the table and down to the floor. Steve vaulted the table, crashing into the stranger and driving him to the ground. A few moments of violent wrestling followed before Alexi twisted free and lunged for the front door
“Yeah. If you have time, you could stick around. I’d love to take you out for dinner some night, maybe hang an engraving on the Tree of Hearts.”
“There aren’t a lot of options there.” Steve pointed out. “There are only the two doors, and Wanda is the only one of us who could fit through the windows.”
“So we have two days to relax and plan. We can get to know each other, I can stock the lair up with food, and everyone can explore the lair. Nat, I noticed that you didn’t sleep in any of the existing rooms. What can I do to make the lair more comfortable for you?”
“Mostly other dragons, but every now and then an uppity human.” Steve nuzzled Tony’s side gently with a muzzle nearly the size of his human friend. “Let’s go inside and prepare for our guests.”
“So give us the news big guy.” Dum Dum chuckled, patting the rough scales of Steve’s leg with clear relief.
Tony just blinked at him. Then blinked around as the town, bedecked in hearts and flowers, started to come into view. The ugly blanket with its giant pink hearts suddenly made a lot more sense. It fit right in with the town’s aesthetic.
Rumiko had not arrived, and Tony wandered over to Revolution Brewing with the rest of the displaced hotel guests, phone glued to his ear, struggling to locate the woman he may have lured into danger. That was where he was when she finally answered his call, told him she was busy with her date of the evening, and that she could not stay shackled to someone whose stock was taking the sort of downward dive that Stark Industries was experiencing. That was also where Steve found him, later that evening, long after the rest of the hotel guests had found themselves new lodging.
“I have a VERY fancy pacemaker. My heart will be fine. Why did you pick me up instead of calling 911?”
“Tall enough for this” Tony replied as he hooked the metal heart over the wire branch of the fake willow. The two scurried back to the car and cranked the heater on, neither had been dressed for the snowy mid-February evening.
“Yeah. Steve’s basically our mom. He’s the only reason the rest of us aren’t in prison. He picked us up as strays and starting saying things like ‘Theft is not an appropriate way to get dinner’ and ‘Wanda’s really smart, we’re going to use the money we’re making to get her into college’ and then when Pietro said ‘With our family’s criminal record Wanda will never be able to qualify for any kind of assistance’ Steve said ‘We’ll pay for her tuition up front’. He’s kinda a genius about working things like that out. We insisted he get a degree too. He’s wasted running our crappy lives, ya know?”
“Mmmm, and the spells are in the books, and I should have lots of time to practice with them over the winter…”
“Sorry, I guess I didn’t explain properly, but… who wants to go to the actual theater on Valentines Day? I have very little interest in whatever romcom is currently showing…I mean... It works well for the theater. They always sell out, but I’d rather watch a movie I expect to enjoy from the comfort of my own couch.”
“Uh, pizza probably. Wanda, do you mind looking up things like hypothermia and frostbite for me while I hang Tony’s clothes to dry? He doesn’t want to go to the hospital, but I’d like to make sure he’s OK before we all go to bed.”
“It… wants to do what it was meant to do.” Steve said hesitantly. “And it can’t turn Phil into a dragon because he already is one. It destroyed those other humans because the other pieces of the artifact weren’t there to regulate its power and it didn’t have a proper bearer to direct it.”
“What’s good for me isn’t important. The important thing is that whomever I marry is good for Stark industries.”
“Tony can fence. That isn’t the type of fighting that squires are usually taught, but I would say everyone here is past their squire years.” Steve mused. “We just spent them very differently.”
“Nope.” Tony interrupted. “He is just here to manipulate me into doing something he wants. That’s all he ever wants, and all he ever wanted. This is important, and once Phil is better I’ll deal with whatever threats Obie escalates to when his bribes don’t work.” Tony looked over at Steve. “Where do you want me for this?”
“Ah. Yeah.” Steve strode over to the desk, and opened the smallest drawer to grab a box. “Somehow my plans got all out of order. I was going to present you with the folder after you said yes, and ask when the folder was complete. I guess I should give up on surprising you and improvise a little.” He turned and took the step that would put him back in front of Tony, dropping gracefully to one knee. He fumbled with the box slightly less gracefully, but eventually managed to display the ring inside. “Tony, I am never as happy as when I am with you, and never want to spend another moment without you if I can help it. Before we met I had no roots, barely a place in this world, and no home. You gave me a home, and that home is you. I want to grow old with you by my side, and I want our homes to be with each other always. Marry me, Please.”
Steve was clambering around the cart while the blond talked, delicately maneuvering the unconscious dragon around. Steve re-positioned Phil’s legs and wings, curling the smaller dragon’s spine gently so it looked like he was resting comfortably in the cart rather than having been tossed in haphazardly. The odd thing was that the longer the two touched the brighter the glow around them became, a soft golden light that sparked green and blue where they touched. “I didn’t know anyone had decided to emulate me.” Steve commented softly.
“I’d much rather discuss our background story for the queen and her court,” Tony replied. “What kinda of childhood do we want to claim?”
“Hey,” Tony said cheerfully, “If my choices are to play with strange magic that might kill me or go back out front and deal with Obie I choose the strange magic.”
“I cannot believe that guy!” An unfamiliar female voice exclaimed as the door slammed open and the two men on the couch jolted back from each other, Tony spinning to see a rather ruffled looking Wanda, Pietro and strange blond woman spilling noisily into the room. “I can see not knowing that Purim is coming up, but not knowing Hanukkah is over?” The strange blond complained.
Steve waited until everyone had pulled themselves back together before heading out to confront the humans. The three newcomers watched as he spun the wheel that lifted the inner gate, then stepped into the vestibule to maneuver the bars that operated the outer gate. He padded out alone and initially ignored Obie again to approach Dum Dum Dugan. “I hope that rush yesterday wasn’t a sign of something wrong?” The bulky red head said with clear concern, fiddling slightly with his bushy mustache.
The farm cart beat the carriage into the courtyard by the simple factor of being too wide to pass on the narrow winding road up the rocks. Happy had always been a calm driver and seemed unfazed by the carriage’s slow process. Tony had heard enough of the angry voices drifting up the road before them to know that Obadiah Stane was less calm about being stuck behind a farm cart. The red headed woman driving said farm cart was completely unintimidated by him, which was rare. In Tony’s experience most people were intimidated by Obie. Once he’d thought it was Obie’s size. Now he thought it was more Obie’s certainty in his own power.
“I don’t want to set one bedroom aside for you. I want to share this bedroom with you. I know you work a lot, and once you get this factory set-up the way you want, you will be traveling a lot. But when you have free time I want to spend as much of it as possible with you, and wake up beside you.”
“That sounds great Tony. I’ll go through it after breakfast while I’m waiting for the appliances to arrive.”
“The dimensions of the limo?” Tony read hesitantly, not sure how those could be a problem Steve was working on.
“I just… when I take it off of you after the reception it will feel like opening a present.” Steve explained.
Steve opened the box carefully, saving the ribbon and folding the tissue paper aside so that he could read the delicately engraved ‘Tony and Steve’. “Yeah, let’s go hang it. Where do you want it on the tree?”
“Right. Okay.” Tony grabbed one of Steve’s shoulders and pushed his wobbly way to his feet, straightening Steve’s jacket and glancing down to double check that no light was seeping out of it. “Time to open the door and get a nice blanket for Steve.” He told Clint once he was sure he was going to remain standing.
“Clint and I tried to protect you from judgement, but it was obvious the clan had no future. We wanted to leave, and we wanted to stay together. Clint could have gone with Phil to his clan…” Nat started.
”the kidnapper guy surrendered to them. He had his hands up and everything. They must be that S.H.I.E.L.D. outfit Natalie was talking about calling in.”
Phil arranged the three of them around the platform and walked them through a series of exercises designed to strengthen their flight muscles. “I ache in muscles I didn’t have yesterday.” Clint announced cheerfully when Phil called a halt to the activity.
“Nah, I subscribe to one of those services that delivers fruit and stuff to me. J.A.R.V.I.S. manages my stock and subscription.”
“Squire, Knight, Captain, Elder,” Tony recited. “Steve carries a Captain’s shield, with two rings around the medallion. He needs another ring now. Phil needs a shield with… two rings. We are a small clan, but he is definitely a captain among us, since most of us don’t even know how to fly yet. Newly fledged dragons are squires. They get badges when they can fly, and shields when they get promoted to knight hood, but if I am making shields I should probably make four so we have them when we need them. Maybe five so we have a spare? There is magic on Steve’s shield, but I don’t know how to replicate that.”
“It’s a converted office building.” Steve cheerfully responded to Tony’s obvious confusion. “They used to print the local paper here, back when there was a local paper. Now it’s apartments, best square footage to price ratio in town.”
“I usually just sleep in my workshop.” Tony said softly, struggling to process what Steve was saying here, struggling with the very concept that rather than the house being satisfactory it was Tony himself who was satisfactory. He had no experience with the feelings he was currently experiencing, could never remember a time when he was judged for himself rather than his ideas, his products, the gifts he could give and the paychecks he provide. Perhaps one of the reasons he encouraged the people he liked to become involved in his business ventures was to keep from knowing if they would stay just for him.
“I wanted to spend time with you too.” Tony said, uncertain if he was in trouble for something now that Steve’s face was so serious.
“Ooooo, what are you watching? Did you know that Crystal has never seen Pitch Perfect?” Wanda asked.
“The police wouldn’t come when Crystal had pictures, why would some government agency come based on a phone call?”
“And, you, uh, just want me to pick what I like from the folder and you’ll take care of everything?” Tony asked.
“I’m glad I could make your dream come true. I’m just sorry I don’t have a collection of fans for you to pose in front of.”
Natalie paused for a long moment before answering, “Nah, Clint is the only guy I’ve met in ages that I thought might be worth spending time with.”
“Can I come hunting too?” Tony asked eagerly as he tried to find a comfortable way to fold his wings while trotting along after Steve.
“I’m too busy to cook,” Tony admitted. “Most people think that I live off of the fare from five star restaurants, but really its mostly fast food and smoothies for me.”
“Who would have thought that your experience with robbery would come in handy like this?” Wanda asked.
“No, I mean there is no bed. My bed burned down. My room was on fire. Good thing there was nothing for me to put in there I guess.”
Their next stop proved to be the garage of an old brick home. Concrete steps carved their way through a hill to reach the front door, but Tony turned the corner to get to the garage nestled against the back of the house. The garage door took them into what may have been a living room if it had been furnished, and Steve could see the granite expanse of a kitchen counter dividing the room he was in from a kitchen before Tony tugged him along up another set of stairs.
“Nah, man. Steve just doesn’t like the news. Says the Republicans are all bullies, and the president is a disgrace. He goes on and on about it. He’s a ranter. He rants. We try not to set him off.”
Tony Perched at the top of the look-out, a device of his own making delicately crafted of dragon forged brass and glass held to one eye. The three groups heading towards the cliff maintained their distinctness, even as the winding road through the trees spilled out into the low grassy area at the base of the cliff that Steve so carefully maintained as a grassland. They were definitely coming here, to Steve’s lair. They almost never had guests, but there was literally no other possible destination. The road ended at Steve’s cave entrance. Behind the cave was water, north was a marshy no man’s land, south a shifting trackless sand dune too treacherous to cross on foot. It had a tendency to swallow living things, trap them in its gullet until they rotted away, then open new trenches into those empty spaces. Nature abhors a vacuum as Steve would say.
There was only one vehicle in the community center parking lot when Cap’s kooky quartet pulled in. A dark van that matched the blurry picture on Crystal’s phone. The large metal main door was closed, and other than the two vans the place looked just as abandoned as it was supposed to look on February weekends. The small windows high on the walls didn’t allow for a view inside, and the group of would be rescuers paused to listen to the overly loud sound of their shoes on the parking lot gravel.
