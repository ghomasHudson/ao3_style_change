Clint's anger only seemed to grow. "And no one bothered to tell us? T'Challa said he looked for them and couldn't find them. Do you know how worried I've been?"
“I have no idea man, other than the fact that he’s all you ever think about.” James returned. They sat together a little longer as the smile slowly faded off of Steve’s face. “You’ve both pretty much admitted it now, I don’t know what you’re waitin’ on. Get in there and kiss your man.”
She nodded stiffly at him, her eyes sliding back to Steve and Clint before she picked up her blanket from the floor and gathered it in her arms, giving them a last glare before she stalked out of the room.
When Tony stepped off the podium and was hidden backstage he pretended to lash out slightly towards Ross before heading to his car and being driven away from the hoards of reporters.
Steve felt his stomach clench again. “Do I get to ask why?” Tony stared at the countertop in front of them. “I’m a very busy and important man, if you read the news at all. My company and my projects need my attention. When I know that the team has enough players and can work together and handle everything, I’ll retire so I can do those other things.” Steve shook his head vehemently. “No amount of people who join the team can take Iron Man’s place.”
He just honestly didn't think his heart would be able to take listening to news about Tony's life that didn't involve him. He was selfish.
Pepper looked aghast as she said, “FRIDAY, Ross wasn’t supposed to be here until tomorrow!” Tony shook his head, “That son of a bitch just loves dropping in unannounced. Alright, quick, everyone clear out, up to the Penthouse. FRI, take the floor restraints off of the specific parties. Laura, I need an almost empty bottle of alcohol, something strong, don’t bother with a glass.”
When the hell had Natasha’s voice become the devil on his shoulder that whispered his darkest desires?
? Did you really think I wanted to kill you? I would never have gone that far, not on you or James. I was angry and I was blinded by that anger, but I am not a killer. I… I couldn’t have killed you. I had the shot and I didn’t take it.”
“Tony!” Peter’s voice came through. “Tony, hold on, we’re here, James and I are going to get you out of there.” Tony groaned in pain again. There was the sound of metal creaking and bending before James pulled the dented door off it’s hinges and threw it to the side. James ripped the seatbelt off of him and was relieved to see that Tony’s cuffs had been changed so his hands were in front of him. He pulled Tony from the wreckage as carefully as possible and cradled him, Peter holding Tony’s legs as they lowered him to the ground.
"My father may have made that shield, but he made it for you. It was a gift, and I had no right to say anything about it. I…apologize…for telling you otherwise."
T'Challa laughed and replied, "If ever you should need it, my borders are open to you. I think you might get along very well with my sister. She is quite good with technology as well."
The elevator door opened and Maggie and Laura stepped off with all of the kids. That was odd, since they hardly ever stopped on the communal floor, preferring to maintain their space and stay in the Penthouse.
Steve’s throat closed on him as he listened to Peter. He wanted to say something but remembered the lesson his books and meetings with Dr. Field repeated often; listen with the intent to understand, not to reply. So he waited, and let Peter continue.
“If the events in the past have shown us anything it is that no one, no matter their strength, intellect, or amount of power they hold, should be allowed to operate without some form of check to their position. This is in the interest of everyone, public and private citizens alike. However, the first drafts of the Sokovia Accords provided a way for the Avengers to be used in ways that could be considered dangerous, while limiting them from helping you, the people, in ways that were unacceptable. You all know the story of Sergeant James Buchannan Barnes, and by now I think I’ve made enough noise that you all know my story as well. If you go to the Smithsonian, open 9-5 Monday through Friday,” the crowd laughed at this, “You can see the story of Captain Steven Grant Rogers, as well. Our stories are intertwined, by fate, by fault, by God, or by sheer dumb luck. What the world often forgets is that these stories are what made us who we are. Behind my Iron Man suit, behind Captain Rogers’ mask, we are people, trying to do the best we can. Mistakes were made by all parties, multiple times. In the end, the one thought that I can take from this is that at no time, did myself or Captain Rogers, intend to cause suffering. Before you all crucify me for this statement, let me continue. There are always at least two sides to a story. Captain Rogers and I disagreed because we were unwilling to compromise and see the other side of the story.” He stopped for a moment, looking down at the podium, before raising his head again, his eyes steel in resolve. “People were hurt because we were unable to set aside our personal convictions. The Avengers team, Captain Rogers and I included, have all signed the new ratified Sokovia Accords. In these Accords, we hope to find the beginnings to a workable solution. The fact is, the world is not perfect, and neither are your heroes. That doesn’t mean we will stop trying. That doesn’t mean we will stop fighting. And when we fight, you can be sure of one thing, we fight for you. Not for politicians, not for fame or glory, for you. So that you can wake up everyday and love your family. So that you can go to bed each night, holding those dearest to you.” Tony’s eyes looked almost misty.
Every night they all sit down to watch a different movie, complete with popcorn and candy. Nathaniel sleeps in his arms while Cassie lays down, using Tony's thigh as a pillow. He spends hours playing Mario Kart with Cooper and Lila, doing his best to keep his cursing to a minimum every time he gets hit with one of the damned shells. By the end of each session, the Swear Jar has at least $20 more in it.
Steve took a deep breath and pushed the button on the bracelet and said, “No one has missed how you never completely turn your back. You are careful where you stand, making sure you can see or be near exits. You don’t trust us.”
“I love him.” He whispered. “I love him more than anything in the world. I’d die for him in a heartbeat. If Tony was in trouble and I had to choose between him and saving a city, I’d let the city burn, even though he would hate me for it. At least I’d know he was alive to hate me.” Everyone in the room was silent at his admission. Rhodes sat quietly and observed him, but Steve paid no attention and continued, “I thought I loved Peggy, and I did in a way, but not like I love him. I’ve never loved anyone or anything like I love him. If she was a raindrop, Tony is a thunderstorm. I don’t know what happened and I can’t give you or him any good excuse why I didn’t see it before.”
Steve swallowed thickly and tried to ignore it. “Listening is a big part of communication. I…I wish I had been better at listening before now.” He glanced downward as he said the last bit, not feeling like he could look in Tony’s gorgeous brown eyes as he said it.
One by one they all took their seats on the stools around the kitchen island as Bucky pulled out ingredients for sandwiches. They fell into a more comfortable rhythm, reaching across each other to get to whatever they needed. As Steve raised his own sandwich to his mouth he felt a small piece of home settle back into his heart.
“Thanos stabbed him in the abdomen.” The warmth Steve had felt was instantly replaced with ice. “Thanos spoke to him, he knew Stark’s name. He told him that when he was done, half of Terra would still be alive. He told him that he hoped they remembered Stark. I know Thanos, he respected Stark, he was almost gentle with him. I have never seen him act in such a way.”
Hearing Laura talk about the caring kind person Tony hid behind all of his jokes, smiles, and winks left Clint feeling angry at everything that had happened and how he hadn’t bothered to care. No one was completely right and no one was completely wrong. All they would have had to do was communicate. Tony had known the Accords were shit, and he had planned to do something about that.
FRIDAY flipped on lights as he moved forward, showing him the way to Tony's room. Reaching the end of a long hallway he came to a large white double door. He hesitated only momentarily his hands on the doorknob. "FRIDAY?" he called.
Tony’s action was immediate. “FRIDAY, send out mission acceptance. Alert local law enforcement that we are on our way, tell them to contain the area but to stay off the scene for their own safety.”
“But you have it, none the less. You also have my respect and my admiration. I watched you fight him. On that note, don’t refer to that monster as your father. He wasn’t your father and he doesn’t deserve that title. Not showing emotion is not what makes you perfect or strong. You are strong.”
After snapping his jaw shut he recovered slightly enough to follow her into the living room for introductions before a piece of paper and crayon were pushed into his hands and he was being directed to sit 'criss cross applesauce' by Lila Barton as if it were completely natural.
Tony ducked under the ropes and stepped down from the boxing ring. He turned to pick up his duffle bag from where he had left it on the ground but found it gone. Turning, he made eye contact with Rogers, who lifted it up and held it out to him. “I was hoping that you and I could talk for a minute?” Tony lifted an eyebrow at him but took the offered bag. “You have exactly how long it takes me to get to my shower.” He answered and began walking away. James made eye contact with him but Tony shook his head. He could do this on his own. He needed to be able to do this on his own.
Steve gave him a small tender smile “I have to. Help me understand why the Accords were able to tear us apart.”
They all walked out onto the floor and the others headed into the kitchen to find the pizza that had been delivered a few minutes earlier. Tony’s eyes, though, found T’Challa, who was sitting on the couch next to Rhodes and Sam, with James and Steve in the armchairs across from them. He came bounding over, tablet in hand and squished himself onto the couch between Rhodey and T’Challa. Rhodes made an indignant noise as he shifted closer to Sam so Tony wasn’t sitting halfway in his lap. “You do realize this is a three person couch, right Tony?" Rhodes said annoyed. Tony ignored him and pushed the tablet under the King’s nose before turning and looking at the kids in the kitchen. Tony had the biggest smile on his face as he watched Peter and Shuri argue over the merits of different pizza toppings. He turned back to T’Challa and said, “Do you have any idea how long it has been since I’ve had to utter the phrase, ‘
Steve should have moved, he should have stopped this, but he couldn’t even think. He froze and in horror, listened to his own broken voice whisper to Tony.
Tony did his best to give Ross an unimpressed look, but immediately narrowed his eyes at the next words Ross threw at him.
At least he could distract himself right now by imagining all of the many painful ways he would punish them in training. The thoughts brought a small conciliation smile to his face. As he descended the stairs Tony’s words continued to echo in his ears. He groaned and ran a hand over his face with the realization he would never, ever live this down.
“I do not believe Miss Maximoff was responsible for the attack. We have a situation very similar to the UN bombing, where someone wants everyone to think it was her. The Accord rule that Ross is operating under was for the chance that a team member went rogue. It is containment only, until the truth can be found, though I doubt Ross will limit himself. Ross wanted the Scarlet Witch, but Tony exercised his right as your guardian to take the responsibility and go in your stead.” T’Challa paused as the person on the other line answered his call. “Madam, it is urgent.” He stood and continued his conversation, explaining the situation and Ross’ actions, calling out to FRIDAY for help patching through the information to those in power.
On the footage, Vision, his face a mask of calm, suddenly came to a stop mid-glide. His eyes widened like to the size of saucers as he tried to back up and couldn’t. He tried to raise his hands and found those stuck as well. Suddenly, the usually cool and collected AI started to flail around like he was being attacked by a swarm of invisible bees.
They were actually going home. Steve could hardly believe it. As he looked at those gathered around them he could see it in everyone else's eyes as well, the almost unsure belief that this was real, paired with shining hope.
Once, on Tony's way out the door to a meeting Pepper had insisted he attend, Steve had stopped him to tell him his tie wasn't straight. Steve had barely caught the quick, "Its not the only thing." Before Tony had continued smiling and told him that it would just have to do since his hands were full, his tablet in one hand and a thermos of coffee in the other.
He felt tears gather in his eyes and saw the same tears in the eyes of his teammates as Bruce recounted the events occurring after his fall. Tony had been unfairly alone, his only back up being the boy who shouldn’t have left his school bus in the first place. The kid was strong, but he was just a kid. Steve felt a tear fall and didn’t bother to brush it away as he clenched his hands together tightly. He locked gazes with Natasha and saw her tears, knowing she was thinking the same thing he was; If they hadn’t fought, they could have all been there together, Tony wouldn’t have been so alone. Bruce neared the end of his story in New York, Strange being taken hostage by one of the children of Thanos, with Spider-Man attempting to retrieve him and Tony following to retrieve them both. All of them, disappearing to the sky. After that, Bruce knew nothing more.
Sweat was dripping from his forehead as he and James circled around each other with matching predatory grins. With a quick movement from James, Tony ended up pinned on his stomach beneath Bucky, who was straddling his hips. Tony’s breath was knocked out momentarily, before he huffed out a laugh and wriggled under his captor.
He moved to take the cupcake, but then looked at the small child in his arms, unsure how to go about possessing both. Tony contained his eye roll as he leaned forward and held his hands out to receive the baby. Steve lifted Nate easily and maneuvered the boy into Tony’s outstretched arms, their hands brushing against each other. Steve was surprised when Tony didn’t flinch or pull away from his touch, simply taking the child and bouncing him on his hip. Steve tore his eyes away from the sight and returned his focus to the cupcake being offered to him. He thanked the two girls and praised their artistic skills, telling them it looked just like his shield. Tony winced as Lila said, “Uncle Tony said you would like it!” Steve turned his smile back up to Tony, who was glaring at the little girls for spilling his secret. “Well, as usual, Uncle Tony was right.” Tony’s eyes widened at that and the girls giggled as they turned to run away.
Suddenly, he felt very small and underdressed in the baggy Stark Industries sweatpants and white T-Shirt he had found in his dresser.
“Tony, it’s James!” He yelled as he put a hand on Tony’s shoulder. Tony jumped at the contact and Steve could see his dark empty eyes stare at James for a fraction of a second before he tore himself out of James’ hands and fell backwards, scrambling to back away from him. James tired to follow him, but Tony’s attempt to get away became more desperate.
She was in such a state of distress she almost didn't she the shape standing in the shadow of the garage,
. But he knew this memory. He knew what happened next and no amount of his sobs or pleading would change it. He barely heard himself tell Tony that he didn’t know it was Bucky’s specifically. Tony’s voice telling him not to bullshit him and asking again, “
Once the doors closed they all rushed to the large screen on the wall and James flipped the channel to the security feed for the compound. Tony was pushed roughly in front of the reporters and cameras, his face remaining calm and collected in the face of the flashes, before being hauled into one of the black SUVs. They watched the caravan pull out of the compound.
Looking to his left he saw Rhodes. He was staring off at the wall, eyes not seeing anything as they spoke about his best friend in the world, who was now gone. The man looked wrecked and empty. Steve could relate, he felt the same emptiness. Rhodes was hardly breathing and his hands were shaking slightly as they hung limply at his sides. It was Bruce, who moved towards him and placed an arm around his shoulders. Rhodes didn’t even react.
, Barton,” He breathed, lowering his arm, the gauntlet disappearing back into the bracelet on his wrist. He lifted his hand to his chest and pressed his palm against the arc reactor. “What is wrong with you?”
He knew he had done well when Tony’s eyes softened further, looking nearly liquid, and he nodded at him. “Yes, please.” He breathed, bracing himself to stand from the chair. Steve placed gentle hands on him and assisted him, relishing in the warmth he felt radiating off of Tony even through his clothing. He walked Tony to the elevator in order to take him to his room in the Penthouse and once inside he felt Tony slump a bit against the wall and breathe heavily, lifting a hand to press against his chest and rub. “Hey, everything alright?” He asked.
Tony's eyes flashed suspiciously at him for a moment as he still gripped his wrist tightly. "Safe? Where the fuck is Rogers?"
Steve would sit near the unit containing his old friend and tell Barnes about his day, about the others, about anything that came to his mind.
Steve was positively shaking with rage at this point. Only Tony’s hand in his and remembering that he had promised Tony that he would be invisible kept him from snapping this pathetic little man in front of them.
Tony nodded, rubbing the back of his neck. "Yeah, uh, after everything went down, Ross wanted to go after them for leverage. I couldn't let that happen. I moved them somewhere safe far away for a while. I would have brought them here immediately, but I wasn't in a good place mentally or emotionally. I was drinking and smoking constantly. I may not be a great with responsibility, but I do know kids can't be around that." He was tinkering with a few gadgets on his desk while he spoke.
"Your pardon includes an invitation back to the United States for treatment, under a few provisions, of course. So I have to ask you, if I have found an avenue for treatment for you that could, theoretically, rid you of the Winter Soldier Programing, would you that be of interest to you?"
“Oh my god, fine. Field trip today, Stark Industries. Okay with you, Cap?” She asked, batting her eyes that were sparkling with fake innocence while everyone else turned hopeful eyes on him.
Tony eyed him for a moment longer before he released Steve from his piercing brown gaze and turned his attention back to Cassie.
?” His rank was nearly a sneer out of her pretty mouth. Wow. She was nearly as good as Tony at this game. He knew when to back off. “Of course, Miss Potts.” He said in surrender.
Scott didn't seem to care he was there, apart from missing his daughter Cassie and sharing the same situation Clint did. His family was also missing, ex wife and all.
Scott, realizing what the AI had thought he meant, tried to appease her. "I didn't mean to make it sound that way Miss FRIDAY, I'm sorry. I meant to ask if something had happened."
It hadn’t helped that she had her actions excused every step of the way. Rogers and Barton, all of them, they stepped in front of her and made sure she never had to face her consequences, never had to confront repercussions. They had lain the blame anywhere else, usually on Tony himself. He was big enough to admit that had led to building negative feeling for her on his part. The bottom line was that she had lost her family to those she had hated, and then suddenly, she was on the team with those people, and expected to be grateful and happy. The whole thing was ridiculous, and it needed to end.
“Tony!” Maggie called from the kitchen. Laura was on her heels as they rounded the counter and started inspecting him for signs of ailment. He gave them each a kiss on the cheek and tried to keep a smile on his face. Nearly everyone was gathered on the couches or in chairs around the counter (in Clint’s case on the counter). They were all staring at he and Wanda with dubious expressions. Notably missing were James, Steve, and Sam. Wanda made her way across the room to sit in one of the armchairs next to Vision.
After a moment of hesitation while they all appraised each other, everyone began to move and break into the groups as he suggested. As civilians ran out into the streets, Steve and Bucky began to gather civilians to what they secured as a "safe zone". Spider-Man climbed buildings and helped people out of windows, lowering them to the ground with his webs.
Just as Maggie opened her mouth to say something else the bell to the elevator signaled another arrival to the floor and opened to reveal a seething Pepper Potts, still in her dress from the Gala. She stepped off the elevator and made a beeline for Tony at the same time that a door opened and Natasha and Bruce came walking back into the room.
Steve's leg was bouncing nervously next to his and when he could take it no longer he finally whispered, "Steve, man, you've got to relax."
They sat that way for another hour. Every now and then Tony would turn and James would rub soothing circles on his back while he dry heaves into the toilet bowl.
Steve didn’t think it was possible for the kid’s face to go any redder, but at the question from Bruce his face flushed impossibly darker. Tony’s smile only grew though as he watched Peter squirm and mumble, “Jus’ a research paper…”
Steve shook his head in disbelief. "You died so you could have revenge? How does that help us or those who died Scott? We lost you!"
That, predictably, hadn’t gone over very well. The Avengers looked like caged animals in the Penthouse, all seething, stalking around, or muttering that they needed their weapons. As horrid as the current situation was, T’Challa couldn’t help feel a little bit joyful at the protective side that they were all displaying on Tony Stark’s behalf.
Behind them, James made a noise that sounded like a broken sprinkler to Natasha from his corner of the room. Her head snapped in his direction as he beckoned her over. They whispered for a second before she broke out in an honest to god giggle and nodded in agreement with him. James stood and stole a few crayons and a paper from the coffee table the kids had been at and brought them back to he and Natasha’s corner. They both picked up crayons and bent over the paper trying to stifle their laughter. Steve watched them suspiciously until he and Sam could no longer take it and they peered over their hunched shoulders. They had made a very festive and colorful sign that read:
He and Tony were just too different, always butting heads. The world didn't need that, they deserved a real team. And truthfully, Tony wouldn't be able to stand next to Rogers in the field, of that he was fairly sure. He wouldn't trust him, he couldn't follow him, and that would probably end up getting someone hurt or killed. Tony wouldn't be responsible for that.
As they pulled out onto the roads and started the drive to the Compound Happy replied, "Yes Sir, Mr. Stark, the video has been up for a while now. I think you'll be reaching a new record of views before morning."
Tony sighed and drew a breath, buying him more time to sort out his conflicted muddled thoughts as he considered his answer. “Yes, it is. Man, I still can’t believe that you were able to draw me into this.”
"Rogers." Tony's voice called out. He froze on the spot and slowly turned back towards Tony, his heart in his throat.
"Anyways, after I started cleaning up I realized that they would be safer and happier here. They've… well they've been something like my family ever since. I adore those little gremlins. Maggie and Laura are saints, I don't know how Clint or Scott were ever able to stand next to those women." He quirked a wry smile at Bucky.
“FRI. Open the door baby-girl.” Tony called out, looking around at all of them still gathered in the BARF Simulation Room.
Tony sighed. "Peter, I need you to be able to trust the others. Captain Rogers will be leading this team. Spend some time with him, okay? I know he seems insufferable but after you get to know him he's really just unbearable." Peter smiled at him and nodded, heading towards the elevator.
He couldn’t bring himself to ask the question they were all thinking. Before he could try to begin finding the courage or his voice, Nebula turned on her heel and walked back up the ramp. She was gone for only a few minutes before they heard footsteps on metal coming back. Instead of her sure strong footfalls, the returning ones were shuffling, slower, clumsier.
For a split second Peter thought about slapping him for so openly ogling Tony, but he saw Shuri leaning against the wall with a sly grin on her face watching the scene. Instead, he leaned on the ropes next to Rogers and whispered lowly, “Do you see something you like,
Avoiding the front Gates, he backtracked over the field and entered the Compound from the garage doors. Riding the elevator up, he stepped in the kitchen. It was still early, so he didn't expect anyone to be there. He had this routine for the last 2 weeks, and no one ever was up this early. Truthfully, he liked the alone time, but he also hoped that at some point he might see Tony. In the last 2 weeks he hadn't seen him even once since that first day.
At first it was only Bucky and Tony together in the secure living space of the lab, but after they had been forced to spend hours together Tony seemed to start to relax around him a little bit more.
T'Challa's heart broke a bit for the man sitting in front of him. He gave him a genuine smile and said, "I hope you will get the chance to do just that. Until then, I go to New York tonight, for a UN Meeting and the Stark Charity Gala in the next few days. I will pass along the sentiment, if I am able to do so without giving away your location."
James pulled back slightly and gripped Tony's face in his hands, making him meet his direct gaze. "Tony, I don't think there is anything you can't do. You got too many people who care about you. Maggie and Laura are like mother hens. Those kids adore you, you've kept both families from falling apart without their dads. Peter worships the ground you walk on. Pepper, Rhodey, Nat, everyone. And now you have me."
So he was laying on the couch, head hanging off upside down, reading the leather-bound copy of "Treasure Island" Tony had lent him to pass the time. He had never been much of a reader before, but he found it a wonderful escape these days. Safe in Tony's lab, he could still go on amazing adventures.
She didn’t want to have this conversation. It was an old wound that shouldn’t effect her like it still managed to do each time.
Making a decision, he stood and exited his lab, riding the elevator up to the shared level before he could change his mind. As he walked into the kitchen he passed James lounging on the couch. He held his finger to his lips as he walked into the kitchen area and leaned against the counter, watching Sam with a smile.
please.” Steve looked confused by gave a nod. James nodded back and took his hand away from Steve’s mouth. They both peered around the corner into the kitchen where Tony, T’Challa, and Rhodes were still standing
Sniffing she realized that a single tear was making its way down her cheek. Angry with herself for showing emotion, she wiped it roughly away. What was wrong with her? For years she had been stone cold and devoid of emotion. She had been perfect. Suddenly she was feeling so much and acting so pathetic. Her father would be ashamed of her. Gamora would be ashamed of her.
"I should warn you though, I think you'll be in for the ass kicking of your life when you get home. I've got about 15 missed calls from Miss Potts and another 20 or so from both Mrs. Barton and Lang, as well as a few others. I'm going to save a particularly nasty voicemail from Colonel Rhodes for you to listen to whenever you miss him."
“I-I know?” Steve answered, unsure of what Tony was saying. “Stark men are made of iron.” Tony said quietly. “What does that mean? Tony, do you not want my help? I can send for Nat or… or maybe James? I know you two are close. FRIDAY wou-”
Tony called out from the platform and in a matter of seconds, what had once been a large empty floor began to transform into a city in chaos. Sirens were heard and buildings formed around them. It was a simulation, and yet it all felt so real. As Steve stood there he could smell smoke in the air of the city and hear the rumbling from around them. He reached out to the ground and picked up a piece of the crumbled concrete, feeling the heavy weight in his hand. If he didn't know any better, he would think he was truly in this city, not in a simulation. It was beyond incredible.
James watched Tony with a fond smile as he answered, “A few months ago Tony and I took a three day drive down the coast in search of a specific candy Stevie and I used to like getting when we were kids in Brooklyn. I showed him the memory in one of our last mandatory BARF sessions. When I told him they were our favorite he insisted we find some. We left that night.”
Tony’s eyes snapped up to Rhodes’ and a spark lit the dull orbs at the sight and sound of his friend. Rhodes recovered from his stumble and stepped to catch Tony in his arms as Nebula helped to carefully deposit him there. Rhodes clung to Tony like a lifeline and sobbed into his neck. Tony looked a little bit lost, his eyes wide as he looked at the rest of them over Rhodes’ shoulder. Upon seeing Bruce, he reached out with one of his hands towards the man. Natasha let him go and Bruce quickly took a few steps forward and took the hand in his own, reaching with his other hand to cradle the the back of Tony’s head which was still tucked over Rhodes shoulder in their hug. Bruce pressed his forehead to Tony’s and laughed with stray tears running down his cheeks. Tony only continued to stare back with wide eyes in shock.
“Oh, I know you didn’t just storm into the Avenger’s Compound and assault my senior citizen.” Came Tony’s beautifully smooth voice above him. There was the sound of mechanical whirring before Steve felt a very human hand on his shoulder. Tony stepped out of the suit and crouched down next to him.
Steve would be embarrassed at what James was about to do, but to hell with it. Steve could thank him later, after he and Tony finally got together and came up for some air.
wasn't a great man like all of the propaganda and media make him out to be. I know that because I lived with the guy. I was there! He was a self centered controlling asshole who never let anyone else shine for the fear they might outshine him. I hated the man! I'll call him every name in the book, but the one thing I never, not ever, forgave him for was the one thing that I found out he wasn't; a
Suddenly, the Gate swung open and a voice addressed him, making him jump and turn in a circle trying to locate the source.
"Oh, good, that's good. Are they wearing their costumes? I told Mr. Stark that I couldn't picture them in anything but their costumes, you know, like maybe they sleep in them." A smile was creeping up on the boy's face. "He thought that was pretty funny."
"Hey, Peter- ", Bucky called out. That was the first time he heard anyone use the kid's name. They had been careful about his identity.
"However," Rhodes added, "with Tony's current injury he will not be able to participate in this simulation. He will watch and guide us from the sidelines, giving pointers, observing, and recording data that will help us later."
With a solemn nod, Tony braces himself to finally lay down the most difficult part of his plan. He knew it was an essential piece, although he wished it didn't have to be this way.
James answered her, his voice slightly clipped, "Tony will be here in a few minutes, he went to pick up Peter."
Tony whispered all of these things to Wanda as they sat against the door together, her head on his shoulder and his chin resting on her head as they shed their tears.
Steve had never given up in his life and he wasn't about to start now. His heart was beyond shattered, so what, men survive worse. He had survived losing Bucky back in the War, when he woke up from the ice he survived losing nearly everyone he had ever known, then he had survived the loss of Peggy. What was the loss of Tony Stark?
Turning back to Rocket she said, “I have already met three others from Terra. They fought with us on Titan.”
He had never acted this way, never been so physically ambiguous since Iron Man had become a part of his life. Did she miss something? She was supposed to be a spy for fucks sake, did she somehow miss a downward spiral? He had been doing better, they all had. Peter had begun to be a regular back at the Compound, Tony was like an uncle to Cassie and the Barton kids. What had gotten into him?
"You're right, the world will never forgive him, unless I can do it first. If I stand up and forgive James Barnes, what right does the world have to condemn him? The Winter Soldier took my family from me, not Barnes. It's important that the world makes the distinction between the two."
"Not the juveniles, but the Mom's do. They're out of their minds with worry. Hurry back boys, I wasn't trained to deal with family issues."
Tony couldn’t believe what he was hearing, what this man was asking of him. Why would he be interested in anything Tony had to say? Why would he think Tony would want anything more to do with the document?
He then turned to the rest of them in the room who were all now standing and looking to him for guidance on how they would handle the situation. “We don’t know why they are here. We stay calm. Do not give them any reason to be aggressive. We know how Ross feels about all of us, don’t give credit to his claims.”
They all began to head to the middle of the floor when Tony's scoff drew their attention and they turned back towards where he was standing with one eyebrow raised.
While Ross was doing his best to tear Tony to shreds downstairs, Maggie and Laura had rushed the younger children off to bed for the night. The rest of them had gathered in the Penthouse and watched the entire episode on the security feed on the large screen mounted on the wall. This feed, though, had audio recording. It was a good thing that Tony’s Compound was state of the art and each room and floor was lined and soundproof, because it hadn’t taken long before Clint and Natasha were both seething, demanding that FRIDAY unlock the doors so they could go teach Ross a lesson he would never forget.
“Tony, in case you are forgetting I was in that bunker-” Tony’s rage built exponentially at that, as he whispered,
"I tried to ask Steve about it but… he wouldn't, maybe couldn't, get it out. He just said that it was complicated and that they had both made so many mistakes. I have tried to be patient, really I have, but its been 4 months and we all lost people too, family and friends. Tony and I, we were becoming friends. I liked- no I like, the man, even now. And I am so confused if that is right or not. I don't know what happened, so how can I know how I should feel about it?"
Tony shook his head slightly and said, “That video needs to be examined. It’s not evidence and until it is determined authentic you can’t take her.”
But Tony cut her off. “I know, Nat, I know. It doesn’t matter. Hey, look at me.” His fingers tilted her chin to look at him, the gesture so intimate Steve felt his jealousy squirm again.
Natasha rolled her eyes at Bucky's reproach. "Don't act like such a hardass Barnes, you know Tony made the right call to empty it out room by room. Remember the kitten he found under the table?"
Slowly, they all shuffled out past them. James put a hand on Steve’s shoulder and pulled him with him out the door. Once the door closed behind them, they all stood in the silence of the dark lab again, the only person who kept walking without looking back was Bruce, in a hurry to get out of the environment.
The reporter was obviously not expecting this answer and she stood floundering for a response momentarily. That moment was all the King needed to nod his thanks and continue up the stairs to the doors of the Gala.
A reporter stood in front of the camera with her microphone, adorned in a beautiful formal dress, her makeup expertly done and every hair in place as she began her broadcast.
“You’ve taken care of my family when I wasn’t there to do it. I know that my choices made it happen, and it doesn’t really matter if they were for the right or wrong reasons. The point is that I made those choices and it meant that I left my family in danger. You made my family your family, even when I gave you no reason to think of me as family. I said terrible things, in a situation I didn’t understand but thought I did. I can’t stress how sorry I am for that. You’ve made a family here again, even when yours was taken from you, more than once.” Tony flinched minutely at that. “I…I would…I want to be a part of your family again, Tony. But this time I want to be a family member towards you, too. I want to earn it and deserve it. I know trust like that takes a while to build, even under the best circumstances, which we aren’t in, so I understand if you-”
Although they didn’t have sound, it was clear that Vision started to mildly panic and started calling Wanda’s name. Wanda, really showing just what an actress she could be, looked at Vision with stunning innocence, asking him what in the world he was freaking out about.
Sam simply shook his head and held his finger to his lips before turning away and motioning for T'Challa to follow him as he headed the rest of the way up the stairs. They continued until they made it to the training room and Sam closed the door behind them both. He then turned to face the King with an impassive look on his face.
"On the contrary," T'Challa replied smoothly, "He asked me to pass on his sincere apology and thoughts to you and Colonel Rhodes."
Steve sat at the table trying to contain the pure joy that he felt in his chest. Sam and James shared a knowing look across the table and Steve found he couldn’t even try to want to glare at them. He needed to remember to be extra nice to Vision for the next forever, since the AI had unknowingly just given him the best night of his life.
“Tony, please. Normally I would appreciate what you’re doing, and I would take the easy way out of this that you are offering, but right now I need you to look in my eyes and know that I mean every single word.” He hesitated and slowly raised an open palm up to Tony’s shoulder, slow enough that Tony could stop him if he needed or wanted. Tony eyed the hand and tensed but didn’t step away or stop him. “You are my family, and I’m going to be there for you, like family should be.”
Lila turned to follow the others down the hallway. Clint caught Tony’s gaze for only a moment, but tried to convey as much gratitude as he possibly could. Tony’s lips gave a small upward quirk before he followed Lila’s footsteps, leaving just the two of them again.
All heads turned towards T’Challa, who’s jaw was clenched and his dark eyes were narrow as he glared back at Ross. Finally, he gave a stiff nod. “That is accurate, however-” But Ross cut him off and waved his guards forward to place the cuffs on Wanda, one guard producing the collar from the Raft. She shrunk back into Visions arms, her eyes fearful.
Tony's eyes focused on a spot over Steve's shoulder for a moment before sliding his gaze and meeting Steve's. Steve felt his breath catch as blue met brown. No one moved, it was like the air was sucked out of the room as they simply stared at each other.
“Do something!” Wanda shouted to Vision. The man shook his head, “I cannot. Tony made sure his lab was secured with the upgrades. I cannot pass through the walls.” His voice was tight. Natasha turned towards Bruce who looked lost for a moment, considering what additional damage turning into the Hulk might cause. “The children upstairs…” He said weakly.
"You don't have to worry about mincing your words here, your Highness. Everyone in this room knows the truth about Siberia. They've seen the video. Nat, you showed Bruce already?"
As they gathered the other items from the list Tony had pulled from his pocket Sam let himself enjoy being with James and Tony as they fought over which brand they should buy. James, growing up through the Great Depression was attempting to convince Tony that the cheaper brand was a smarter buy. In response, Tony took out his credit card and waved it under James’ nose, asking if he forgot who he was shopping with.
Shuri only regarded him and laughed, obviously sure that it would never work for him. Clint pretended to be offended before going back to watching the event unfold.
For a moment, everyone froze as they began talking. They all looked at each other, not sure if they should turn off the feed and give the men their privacy or not. It was Peter who finally voiced the question, “Shouldn’t we- well I mean, I’m not sure that we should-” but FRIDAY’s soft voice filled the room as she said,
He knew that voice. A relieved smile spread across his face as he turned and found her leaning against a marble pillar tucked into a corner by one of the staircases. She was dressed in the very simple but elegant long black dress he had bought her a few weeks ago in preparation for tonight.
They watched as T’Challa leaned on the counter and asked if there was anything that Tony needed from him. Steve looked at James confused, why did this matter? Anyone who knew Tony knew that he wasn’t going to actually ask for anything. Without looking at Steve, James just pushed his hand against his cheek so he was looking back at the scene.
“Hiya Pep, good to hear from you, I’m great, how are you?” Tony said, pointing out her lack of any greeting.
Tony could hear T’Challa’s smile through his sleek SI phone he held pressed to his ear. Even across the world in Wakanda, he could picture the smug smile that would be stretching across the King’s face. Tony nearly wished he were there to smack it off him.
James bumped his shoulder, “No stupid, I mean a psychiatrist. I was hesitant at first too, but its been really good for me. How about you come with me to my next appointment?” Steve felt incredibly unsure that there was anyone in the world with enough knowledge and experience to safely dive into the heads of the Avengers, but James looked hopeful and if it helped him to be more understanding of Tony and be a better team member, he supposed he could give it a try. James had been delighted when Steve had agreed. “Alright then, Stevie. I’ll see you in the morning. Everyone is going to gather to watch the Press Conference tomorrow at 10, try not to sleep in!” He teased as he shut the door, knowing full well that Steve would be up for his run around 5 or 6.
As he exited the room and closed the door behind him, he asked, “Anybody seen Stevie lately?” Wanda grumbled at the game of chess she and Natasha were playing on their tablet in response. Natasha smirked at her before turning to James to answer, “I think that he needed a break to think. He walked down the hall and turned left into the stairwell.” James smiled at her answer, always the spy with the details, and headed off in that direction.
From the doorway to the stairwell an answer came, “Chicago was just fine. Mission went off without a hitch.” James stood in the doorway with the rest of the team behind him. “Local PD are on the scene for clean up.” Half of the guards turned their rifles on the new arrivals as James, Rhodes, Vision, Natasha, and Bruce were pushed into the middle of the room with the rest of their teammates, though T’Challa was allowed to walk himself without being touched. T’Challa immediately pulled Shuri into a protective embrace.
Bucky nodded happily and replied, "Yeah, Tony says that if our progress continues I can go on the mission with them in the next few weeks. Just a small one, recon on something with him and the Spider Kid."
?" Sam mouthed at him, his eyebrows high. Steve could only shrug and turn his bewildered look to Bucky. "FRI, when did Tony start doing this?" Bucky asked.
Natasha slid out the door and down the stairs. The cameras were flashing and the reporters were calling her name, but she had set her mind on leaving before she went back in and kicked Tony's ass for being such an idiot.
“Tony-” He tired again, but he was cut off. “Promise me, Steve.” Steve swallowed hard as Tony looked into his eyes. He had said his name. Not Rogers, not Cap, but Steve. His heart pounded in his chest. “I promise Tony.”
“Whoa there, Spiderling, any testing needs to be done in the lab. I will not have your shenanigans tear up the Compound, I literally just put it back together, capiche?” T’Challa had Shuri’s arm and he leveled her with a serious look as he said, “Remember we are guests here, yes?”
T'Challa pretended to be horrified when Tony screamed and pretended to try and talk sense into him. Finally, he asked the Secretary to leave, whispering that he would stay and continue to try and get Stark to play their game.
"Calm down, Steve," Natasha said from her place at the bar counter, sitting noticeably away from the rest of them at the table. "Tony isn't a patient; he visits every Tuesday he is available."
"Does anyone want to explain what kind of shit show that was?" Tony's voice carried down to them. He was leaning over the edge of the railing on the overlook, his unharmed hand clutching the rail so hard it was white.
Suddenly, Tony kicks his leg out and swipes at James’ feet, knocking him on his ass right next to him. “Not as long as it’s been for you, Snowflake.”
His emotions had been especially thrown for a loop when the nurse mentioned the painkillers. She didn’t say what they were or how strong they were, but Steve had the sinking thought that maybe they had played a part in Tony’s affectionate gestures. Sitting in his solitude he could really think through what that would mean for him. Of course, it wouldn’t be Tony’s fault and if Tony didn’t remember, Steve wouldn’t say a word. If he did remember and it was a mistake, well, that would probably gut Steve, but again, he would respect Tony’s wishes.
True to her words, a hush fell over the room as the pair came striding in. Since no one else had the Super Solider hearing they didn’t hear as Natasha continued her narrative in his ear.
T'Challa watched dumbstruck as Tony bent down on one knee and received three children barreling into his arms at near full speed. Tony caught them easily, though he swayed slightly upon impact. A fourth child, much smaller, was squealing in his mother's arms, tiny hands outstretched towards Tony Stark.
“Stevie has been outta his mind with worry, ya know.” James said from the chair at Tony’s bedside. The chair was tipped back on its hind legs and James’ feet were crossed at the ankle on the bed next to Tony, who was propped up by pillows in a sitting position.
"And just how do you plan on helping without your gear. Wilson, do you want your wings back or not?"
Steve looked to his left at Sam, but the other man's eyes were downcast, occasionally glancing towards the front of the Jet at the pilot's chair. "Hey Sam," he called, getting the man's attention, "You'll be okay. He's a good man. Just give it a little more time, maybe privacy."
. His mind was a war at the moment and he knew that if he wanted any chance of leaving this godforsaken bathroom without causing an international spectacle between the United States and Wakanda he had to take his chance and exit now.
Steve wasn't the least bit surprised. Scott had only joined because Captain America had requested his help. Scott had put blind trust in him, and Steve was grateful, but also ashamed that he had led the man to leave behind his family.
Tony raised an eyebrow at his antics but looked at the paper in his had, scanning the document for a brief second before he looked back at Peter again with a blinding smile to match the one on the teen’s face.
He smiled and nodded as he shook her hand and then Maggie's, replying, "I did indeed, thank you. It was beautifully put together."
“You don’t know what I’ve done!” She yelled, more tears falling now. “You don’t know who I am, how many people I’ve hurt!”
T'Challa stomped on this automatic reaction to tell Steve that no, Tony Stark was not okay, in fact he was far from it, he was just a much better actor than anyone gave him credit for. Instead, he changed the conversation topic.
“Friday. It’s good to hear from you baby girl. No doctor right now, we are here for a quick tune up and repair.” Tony smiled tiredly as he heard the voice of his AI once again. A short explanation as they made their way down to his lab made Nebula relax slightly, though she was still wary.
Steve was so close; Tony hadn’t let him this close since before Siberia. “Say my name Tony, please. Just once more.” He asked, his voice a more than a little broken. Tony glanced off to the side. “I say your name all the time, Rogers.”
So I have to clarify something with the Wanda situation. Remember that Tony isn’t planning on staying on the team, so he doesn’t need to trust her. Just like the others, he can forgive them for the greater good to move forward and get the team back together, that doesn’t mean he trusts her to have his back. He said, "you fought for the others fiercely", not you fought for me and you’ll have my back. He says "we'll work on it" because he isn’t planning to need it past the few missions the public needs to see them on. Does that maybe make a little more sense? Alright, on with Science Squad!
“I’ve wanted you dead for a long time Stark. But I’d settle for those you care about. I almost got both when I had my men blow that wall on the Warehouse by the river. Nearly killed you and your little Spider friend.”
That was it for him. Steve heaved himself to a corner and threw up, gagging and dry heaving. His head was swimming, and he barely heard the other voices. Wanda tried to call his name and he felt her small hand on his forehead. He sank to his knees and collapsed against the wall. In the back of his mind he registered that the room was no longer the frigid temperature of Siberia. He opened his eyes and looked around at the now bare room. Natasha and Vision were on their knees with Tony who was shaking uncontrollably and flinching away from their hands, his palm pressed against his chest. Natasha was whispering to him, trying to calm him down. Sam stood over her shoulder looking down at Tony with desperation.
Pepper scoffed at him. "Did you really think that you approached the government's high security raft, broke apprehended criminals out of specialized cells, and were able to hide out in the world with everyone looking for you, all by yourselves?"
He huffed in response and tilted his head back without responding. Growing more annoyed at his lack of response and seeming lack of care that he had made his injuries worse by risking so much instead of just leaving like she had asked, she pushed again.
The whole thing was ridiculous, he had told the UN panel over and over again that he had no information or progress further than what he had already testified. What did they want him to do make something up? He had told them everything. He knew Ross was involved, the slippery man had made it clear he believed Tony knew more than he had let on. He was right, unfortunately, but that didn’t mean he would get anything out of him. He had told them all he ever would on the subject.
T'Challa wasn't even slightly surprised that Stark knew that the fugitives were hiding out in his palace.
Turning last to Cassie, he shook the Snickers bar at her temptingly. She looked slightly at a loss for a moment before brightening up and telling him, “I made a new friend!” Tony raised both eyebrows and said, “Is that so? Alright then, who is it? Remember I need confirmation.” She smiled as she turned around and pointed directly at Steve.
The man looked like he was trying to crawl inside the cabinet looking for something so he hadn’t noticed Tony come in. James silently lifted himself from the couch and joined Tony at the counter, sharing a smile with him as they watched Sam rummage around like a squirrel.
Nebula’s eyes tracked all of the movement and a small flicker of surprise crossed her features. Steve bristled at that. Who was this woman and what did she know of them? Why should she be surprised to see them comforting each other? Just because she seemed to have an eerily robotic amount of control over her emotions didn’t mean that they rest of them did. They were hurting, didn’t she understand?
He brings her face inches away from his own, putrid breath hitting her nostrils as he chuckles darkly.
"Knock knock." Tony called as he came strutting in with a packet of papers under his arm and a coffee in each hand. He was dressed in a fitted charcoal grey suit, his blue and yellow stripped tie loosened a little bit around his neck.
“What are we going to do?” Natasha’s whispered question went unanswered in the silence of the room. No one had any answers.
From his place next to Shuri and Peter, T’Challa said, “I think secrets have caused enough harm in this room. Tony and I worked together for months to amend the Accords in order to bring you all back and home to each other. He tricked Ross and others who were against us, deceiving them into believing he did not want you home. He played the part of being out of control and an unreliable man who didn’t care for any of you and needed to be put back in his place. It worked wonderfully. He was afraid if any of you knew that he was trying to help, you would not take the assistance.”
All of the Avengers, minus Tony, were gathered in the communal kitchen and were going through the various states of waking up. Steve heard Clint’s comment as he came walking in, freshly showered, back from his morning run.
When he had tried to communicate to the older man why he did what he did, how if he didn’t do anything, the bad things happened because of him, he had seen the understanding in Tony’s eyes. He had also seen the sadness and regret. Mr. Stark knew exactly what he meant and not only had he understood, he had extended his own help and resources. Peter watched the news and knew what a lot of people said about Mr. Stark, but in all of the time he had spent with him, he never saw what the news reported on him being. Tony let him see beneath the armor, and if Tony didn’t let him see, well, he wasn’t a dumb kid, he saw a lot anyways. He knew how hard Tony had fought to come out above what May had called his “inner demons”. Tony had become his family, and Peter didn’t have a lot of that left anymore.
James was out of his seat in an instant and running for the elevator. "Alright FRI, show me the way."
Tony would only let out a small laugh that sounded more like a huff. "Opening with the big guns, huh? Fair enough. I started again as soon as I was released from the hospital after Siberia."
"It's nice to see you all again." He tried for nonchalant as he addressed Natasha, Vision, and Bruce."
Bucky smiled indulgently at him, rolling his eyes at the question he had no doubt anticipated. "I feel great Stevie."
Steve repeated his authorization and the light on the door turned green and unlocked. They both pushed through and Steve was hit with the unexpected picture the room presented. He felt the others enter the room behind him and freeze as well.
T'Challa stepped out of his car, flanked by Okoye, who looked breathtaking in her orange gown, ever just as deadly. His suit, although modern cut, was adorned with a striking black and white tribal pattern. Shuri shrieked as he buttoned the jacket as he stood from the car.
They all gathered around the kitchen and couches spooning their ice cream, congratulating Peter on his paper, complimenting Lila and Cassie’s cupcakes, and fawning over Cooper’s trophy, which Clint had in on hand as Cooper sat in his lap reliving the moment he won to his father.
Tony in his Iron Man suit, standing in front of that stupid monitor as it played the video of his parent’s death. He turned to the phantom-like apparition of Steve and asked the question that haunted Steve’s nightmares every time he closed his eyes.
He stood in the middle of the ballroom and took in the giant glittering space decorated in a tasteful way only Pepper could pull off for a few more moments, savoring the empty space a little longer before all the people would start arriving in a few hours and he would need to put on his "Tony Stark Media" mask. He still needed to go back to the Compound to change into his tuxedo, but he figured he would stop in and see if Pepper needed anything before he did.
Tony stopped in his tracks again pivoted on the landing two steps above him. “Did Captain America just admit he was staring at my ass?”
“There…There may be someone left. On Earth. We could use their help.” He says quietly, his voice feels like gravel. She returns with a small sharp nod, saying, “We need to find some way off the planet. A ship of some kind. You need medical attention.” Her hand does not slip from his as she stands, using it to help pull him to his feet after her. He grits his teeth and tried to smother the pained moan that the action pulls from him.
Plus, Pepper and Vision would be there, probably even Natasha. He hadn't pressed her on the issue, just offered her the option to attend if she felt up to it. She had told him that if he wanted and needed her there, she would be happy to stand by his side.
Sam hadn't admitted it to Steve, but he had seen his sketch book and there was a disproportionately borderline creepy amount of sketches of Iron Man, as well as sketches of the man who wore the armor. Charcoal sketches of Tony Stark's eyes and hands that had too much detail to be considered normal. It was like Steve was afraid of forgetting Tony.
Tony shook his head. “You heard Ross. 10 missions, then I retire. I’ll manage things from here, help out with equipment, training, medical, whatever else. I won’t be an active field member.”
I told you about, it is in my bag, hurry, let’s test it out!” She grabbed Peter’s wrist and they were about to run off when Tony and T’Challa caught them each by the arms.
T'Challa raised his eyebrows at the mention of kids, but said nothing, waiting until the elevator doors slid open to reveal organized chaos unfolding in the Avengers Compound living space.
“Sorry Tony, I happen to be Team Parker today.” Bruce yelled back from where he leaned against the wall. Still not breaking concentration, Tony easily blocked one of Peters jabs and called to Bruce, “The day you step in this ring with me is the day you can pick teams, Greenbean!”
She laughed lightly before saying, "I'll keep you updated. We are getting ready to receive your cargo here. Check in later." Her waving image flashed on the screen for a second more before vanishing.
. He sat down on the stair next to his friend. “You know; the view is way better in Tony’s room.” He stated. When Steve’s cheeks reddened a bit he continued, “I think there are even chairs in there.” Steve rolled his eyes and bumped him with his shoulder. “Oh, you thought I meant Tony was the good view?” James played dumb, causing Steve to laugh out loud and reply, “Wow, yes, now why would I have thought that?”
Tony’s gaze turned next to Natasha, who had her arms wrapped around herself tightly as she watched. Steve knew she was trying to hold herself back from launching at him to wrap him in a hug of her own. They had all been through so much, but that didn’t mean that Tony would be forgiving for what had happened between them 3 years ago. The tears streamed down her cheeks as Tony stared at her for a long moment.
Even if she had the time or energy, she knew hers wasn’t exactly a comforting presence. It didn’t seem to matter to the man though. Once he was patched up as well as she could manage, he followed her orders and listened to her flight instructions without a word.
3. Tony has royally messed up before too, okay? And he thought he had all the right reasons for it. If anyone knows how it feels to lash out at someone who hurt your family in the heat of the moment, it should be Tony. cough*Siberia*cough. If he can forgive Bucky and the others, he can forgive Wanda for something she did before she was even part of their team.
. He was too good and if he ever saw the disappointment everyone else seemed to look at him with in Peter’s expressive eyes, he didn’t think he would be able to handle it.
“Why do you care? I taught you how to fly the ship!” She exclaimed, confusion melting into frustration.
Scott had already spoken with Maggie and Cassie a few days before, though he had stayed tight lipped on details. He did say they were rebuilding things little by little and that Cassie had told Scott that Tony had reminded her often that her daddy loved her.
Tony eyed him warily but gave a stiff nod. Pepper supported him, "She's become very close with Lila, they call each other sisters."
“This is how you’re still running things, huh Stark? This is so pathetic its impressive.” He sneered.  Tony raised his unoccupied hand and waved him off, acting flippantly drunk as he replied “Well, what can I say, I’m an impressive guy.” Ross narrowed his eyes. “You know; the Counsel didn’t approve this so that you could fuck it up for us.” Tony scoffed at that. “The Counsel had to approve this and you know it, Ross. You never wanted this.”
Tony gave a last smile, but it didn’t meet his eyes. The reporters rushed forward like a pack of hungry wolves, shouting to have their questions answered.
Tony nodded with a smile in return. "Well then, James, I'm absolutely starving, and there are some people upstairs I would like to introduce you to."
He shouldn't listen in to the mans one sided conversation, and yet the Captain's voice was deep with emotion and sounded frankly, broken beyond shattered.
Peter had to try and remind himself that he still wasn’t 100% on board with liking Steve, even though Tony had told him that he should try and get to know the man underneath the Captain America costume. It wasn’t that he didn’t like the guy, he just wasn’t sure he knew how to reconcile the man who was smiling at him now from the man that he knew kept Tony up at night in his nightmares.
By now the small room was filled with the Avengers, plus T’Challa and Shuri. Maggie and Laura had dragged the kids home to get some rest around 9 PM. He heard Rhodes sit down heavily in the chair on the opposite side of the bed. “Steve, man, you gotta eat or drink something. Tony wouldn’t want you to hurt yourself because he isn’t feeling 100%.” Steve just continued to stare at Tony’s relaxed face as he slept, ignoring the other people in the room.
Almost in a trance he watched Sam duck under the arm that had barred him from getting past Steve. Sam ran to the table and picked up the remote, switching off the TV and turning back towards everyone else, his mouth moving but no sound making it Steve's brain.
Tony was hauled from the wall back in front of them next to Ross. He gave them all one of his signature smiles before calling, “FRIDAY, activate protocol Air Force One.”
With that he walked out of the room and back into the communal area with Nate babbling away happily at his toys.
“Come on in, Steve, have a drink.” Tony called tiredly. Steve’s step faltered a bit at that. A drink?
He heard Tony's fond chuckle after ending the call. He nearly jumped out of his skin when Sam suddenly appeared at his side in the hallway. They looked at each other in silence for a moment before they heard Laura Barton's voice coming from the kitchen with Tony.
“Help me learn how to fight with you. I…I don’t know as much about your suit as I should. No, not should, you don’t owe me, I should say that I don’t know as much as I’d
"Stop, Clint." Sam was surprised to hear Wanda's voice. "Steve, I am going to get us all some drinks, would you help me?"
T’Challa acknowledged this with yet another tiny nod. “And yet, what was left behind has the foundations to build upon it, does it not?”
"And our guardian? If you tell me they've assigned Tony Stark, I don't know if I can accept." Wanda stated contemptuously.
At their silence he nodded once more and pulled the Accord documents out of the briefcase on the floor at his feet. He set a packet and pen in front of each of them.
Over and over, Tony kept having him come at him, coaching him with every step, giving him pointers and telling him where he was lacking his concentration. Finally, after successfully blocking one of Tony’s uppercuts, Peter saw a very brief second where Tony left himself open. Without further thought, he jabbed, his glove connecting squarely with Tony’s left cheek, making him stagger for a fraction of a second. He barely registered the cheers coming from the other side of the room before Tony pulled Peter’s still extended arm and trapped him in a headlock. He struggled, but Tony’s grip was as iron as his suit. Tony’s heavy breathing and a chuckle surprised him as he suddenly was released from the hold. Looking up, Tony was smiling at him brightly. He nodded as he held out a glove for Peter to bump. Tiredly, Peter bumped his blue glove against Tony’s red one and let himself be pulled into a quick hug. Above him he heard Tony say, “That’s what I like to see, kid.”
In the middle of their argument, Tony’s phone began to ring. He pulled it out of his pocket and his face lit up at whatever he saw on the screen, swiping to answer the call.
Tony, Peter, and Shuri all took off for the elevator. Tony turned around and scanned the room until his eyes landed on Bruce. “Brucie-Bear, let’s go, you’re part of this Squad!” He made a sweeping hand gesture towards the open elevator that Peter and Shuri were already inside, both peeking out to see what the hold-up was.
"Parker, education is important, that's one thing I actually took fairly seriously. You're gonna have to just stick it out." Tony huffed, "Okay, listen up Spiderling, the best I can do is this; tell your teacher that you were up late working on a Stark Industries internship project. I'll have FRI send something out to confirm it."
Tony didn’t have to guess who T’Challa was referring to. Silence had been one of the first requirements he had given the King when they started their journey. None of the exiled Avengers could know that Tony had a hand in anything being done. If they did, they probably wouldn’t trust the outcome. T’Challa reluctantly agreed to Tony’s stipulation, though he had many times expressed his unhappiness with the situation. So they had kept it a secret, meeting when the King was in New York, video and phone chats when he was back in Wakanda.
Seeing Tony Stark now, he could also see that the spark of life and hope that had previously driven him to become Iron Man was not gone, though now it existed as barely a dim flicker. The watering down by alcohol was not helping, of that he was sure. Oh the man was holding it together quite well, as only a well trained and seasoned actor could, but there were small imperfections in his carefully molded mask.
Upon the elevator doors sliding open, he had stood gaping unattractively at the open floor of the Compound Penthouse. Well, this chaos explained why Tony and Natasha fell asleep on the lower floor instead of the Penthouse. A massive blanket fort made up of at least ten different large quilts stood in the middle of the room, in front of gigantic television screen mounted on the wall. The surrounding couches cushions had been stripped off to be used in the fort building process. An unfinished princess puzzle was scattered on the surface of a large coffee table that had been pushed to the side to make room for the fort. There were various toys and stuffed animals positioned outside the fort, as if guarding the perimeter. Inside the fort was a nest of even more blankets and pillows.
About two hours later the elevators opened and ‘Science Squad’ stepped out. Scott was trying to pick out the webbing that Peter had stuck in his hair and Bruce was attempting to clean some of it off of his glasses with his shirt. Shuri and Tony were both bent over a tablet taking so fast that it sounded like another language. Tony asked her a question she must have found stupid, because she adjusted something on the tablet and slapped him upside the head, calling him an idiot. Tony looked positively elated with whatever she had done and leaned over to show Bruce, who made an
He lifted his gaze back to Tony, but the man had already turned towards Wanda and outstretched his hand to her, holding a pair of gloves. She eyed him warily, but took the offered gloves. Sliding them on, she looked at them in awe. They were black fingerless gloves, but upon closer inspection the black weave of the gloves looked almost purple when the light hit it just right. She gazed at them before looking back at Tony, who offered no explanation.
Putting down the soldering iron he rose and quickly to open the bottle of scotch he kept in the corner cabinet. He poured some on his hands and wet his neck with it like aftershave, then downed a large swig so that the smell would be heavy on his breath. Mussing his hair, he rode the elevator to meet the man on the old, currently unoccupied, communal area of the 2nd floor.
“Is that safe, considering everything that Steven Rogers has done in the past?” Tony ignored this question.
He had messed up, they all had, but he couldn’t do anything about anyone else, he could work on himself. No more pity and pining. Thinking about it now, it wasn’t fair to think that Tony would share his feelings. The fact that he had come back expecting anything seemed so ridiculous to him now. Tony had taken steps to fix the situation and Steve had stood there and let him, doing nothing to help from his side except miss the man. No more. He was a man with a plan, after all, and his plan started now. Would he pine? Yes, quietly, expecting nothing in return. Would he love Tony? Always, which is why things would change.
"Well, I certainly hope you are planning to change before attending your Gala tonight, Mr. Stark." Pepper smiled as she walked towards him out on the floor.
"So, sorry you've been left alone for a few days, I didn't realize you'd be coming to me sans an arm. I don't feel like I can leave you armless, being your appointed guardian and all, so, these are the schematics of the new arm I've been working on for the past few days." He pushed the papers he had dropped on the table in front of Bucky.
She let out a small laugh and in her best Thor voice said, "You call this a storm? Ha! I'll show you a storm!"
Natasha took a few angry steps towards Wanda before Tony caught her. “No, Nat, don’t. It was before she was on our team. Please, I’ve forgiven her. I just wanted to make the nightmares go away.”
Rocket doesn’t speak much. He fiddles with some tech and lashes out at anyone other than Thor. The God himself doesn’t have much to say either, though he is angrier than he was before.
"Why Miss Potts, are you insinuating that I don't look dashing enough in what I am wearing now? I am truly wounded." He broke out into a grin as she laughed and enveloped him in a tight hug with a kiss on his cheek.
A few minutes later the elevator bell sounded and Steve felt like the world moved in slow motion. The doors opened to reveal Tony Stark, a young male teenager-
He turned next to Peter. "Spider-Man, when you are given an order by your Team Leader you need to obey. The Captain could see clearly from his location that you were in danger and you wouldn't reach those civilians. You have to listen to others."
Iron Man would retire. The Patriot was more than capable of preforming any duties Tony has preformed previously, and Rhodey would be better suited for it anyways. Tony wouldn't stand in the middle of the team and pretend it made them better. Once Rogers was back and James was on the team with him there would be nothing getting in the way of his 'moral compass'. Rogers would lead the team, as he always should have been able to.
"I would like to extend an invitation to you, your Highness. I am afraid I was quite rude in when we met this morning. I would like to remedy that. Could you stop by the Compound tonight?"
Tony sniffed a bit and grimaced. “Which thing? The Gala, The Accords, Ultron, attacking Barnes? Which
A sob was ripped from Natasha’s chest at that. Bruce pulled her into an embrace and she pushed her face into his chest, but she never let go of Steve’s hand.
If Steve had been in any kind of right mind he would have been mortified at the things she was whispering and his reaction to it. He would have put a stop to it immediately. Unfortunately, his brain was completely offline the moment his gaze landed on Tony. He was everything that Natasha was describing and more.
Sitting back down, Steve saw Bucky enter the kitchen with a small smile playing on his face. "Buck?" He questioned. Bucky ignored him and instead called out, "Good morning, FRI."
“What, are you fools doing? Wanda is about to call the Red Man!” She said, throwing her hands in the air annoyed. Tony tore his eyes away from Steve and growled as he pulled Steve out of the room by their webbed hands. As he pulled him along, Shuri eyed the webbing and then turned an absolutely unsettling grin on Steve, who tried his best not to blush furiously. Judging by the victorious grin on her face, he failed miserably.
"What happened," Tony said, coming down the stairs, limping slightly, "Is that you just lost two of your teammates. Had that simulation been real, you would be now reporting to the world the following statistics: FRIDAY, read them out."
"Alright, enough." Tony said, raising his hands. "Laura and Maggie have lunch ready upstairs in the kitchen. Everyone go ahead and head up there. We can try the simulation again later after we've all calmed down and had time to think about what happened."
"Huh? Oh, sorry, sorry. My head, I'm kinda lost. There was just a lot of blood when FRI opened the suit. His eyes were weirdly dazed. We were just supposed to have a look; we didn't think there would be anyone there."
He chewed on his lip for a moment. "It's just…I'm not the Winter Soldier, but I'm also not Bucky, as much as I wish I could be for Stevie's sake. I just feel like I'm on a constant journey through confusion and anger and I don't know how to navigate my way?"
Happy checked his mirrors again before answering, "Indeed he is, sir. Keeping a bit of distance but he will be right behind us."
T'Challa continued to smile as he watched Tony Stark heard the children down the hall into their bedrooms.
Laura came over and pushed a wet wash cloth against the cut and Clint looked up at her. Steve turned away as Clint’s hand reached for Laura’s other hand at her side. She was tense for a moment before she squeezed his hand back for a moment before releasing his hand and using hers to push his hair back and wipe the blood on his forehead away.
She scoffed at his response, “It is inconsequential. Even if it still existed I wouldn’t know which planet it was. Thanos took me as a small child and raised me.”
Tony looked sad as he looked down at Steve. “Do you really think I cared that we didn’t agree on the Accords? Do you think that’s what this is about? It’s not even about Barnes. Its about us, you and I, and the lies and secrets you kept from me. It about me thinking we were friends, hell even-
“What about Steve?” He tensed at that. “What about him?” She turned in his arms and looked into his eyes. “Why have you not forgiven him?” Tony sighed in a long suffering way. “It’s not as simple.” He tried to shrug it off. Wanda looked unimpressed and retorted, “You and I, sitting together, a crying mess on the floor, is simple to you?” Tony cracked a smile at that. “What you mean,” she continued, “Is that your heart and your mind are not in agreement.”
"He looks so happy. I never thought I'd see him that happy again." Steve told him, as he moved towards a chair to sit down as well.
She shook her head as if trying to clear it of the emotions that were tumbling down on her. Steve instantly felt regret for his thoughts a few moments ago about her robotic feelings. She did feel, of course she did, she was just holding it together better than the rest of them right now. She couldn't even say the boy's name.
"Yeah, see if you can get the kid to relax a little. He's sure its his fault. Pepper and Happy are with him already as well."
Wanda would often sit in the open communal area of the housing T'Challa had provided them. A large while chair with various soft pillows had become her favorite place to sit, overlooking the great Wakandan plains. She would sit for hours, staring blankly.
“What about the rest of us, Tony? We could help.” Scott reached out. Tony shook his head though, “Despite what the press conference led people to believe, you aren’t officially approved for the field yet. The Counsel is a bit pre-occupied with the evidence my lawyers gave them so they won’t be able to green-light you in time. I’m sorry, you’ll need to sit this one out, all of you.” Tony gave them all meaningful looks, landing last on Steve.
“Cassie, come help Lila and Cooper get the cleaning stuff. Remember, if you are going to be here you need to help.”
He smiled kindly in response and tried to discreetly check the cushion as he lowered himself into a chair next to the couch. Pepper, Natasha, and Bruce sat on the longest couch, leaving an open space which was suddenly occupied by Vision, though T'Challa didn't know just when the AI had come into the room.
Sam didn't even hear the reporter's answer; he was in complete shock. Yes, he seen old footage and heard all about the famous Tony Stark charm, but in the time he had actually spent with the man, he had never seen that side of Tony surface.
1. I think by this point Tony knows that he can't keep holding on to hate if he wants to have a functioning team to leave. He knew that Wanda would be coming back with the rest of them, it isn't realistic to harbor negative feelings forever. Especially because she is powerful and dangerous. Tony is a genius, I think he would realize that you don't want to alienate people like that.
“It’s BARF.” He said as they slid up the door. “Do it again, Stevie.” He said as they got to the locked door.
Stepping out of the shower he toweled off and dressed in grey lounge pants and a soft white t-shirt. He emerged from his room a few minutes later and headed down the hall to the kitchen for breakfast. He stopped at the end of the hall when his hearing picked up the low hum of Tony's voice.
Tony’s heartrate picked up again. “Actually, it’s Spider-Man. He’s very sensitive about that.” He spoke through the blood.
“Suppose there ain’t a lot of hope for my friends, neither?” Rocket continued. Thor placed a heavy hand on the mammal’s narrow shoulder in comfort. “They went to check on the Collector. Thanos had the stone, so he must have gotten there before them… Or they were unable to stop him. I am sorry, my friend.” Rocket didn’t answer, he just continued to stare at the floor.
.” FRIDAY reported. Steve smiled at that. “See? I’m a fantastic guardian. Now get out.” It wasn’t that easy though, and Ross pressed, “And the rest of them?”
quickly, trying his best not to think of Tony, ultimately failing, coming hard whispering Tony's name like a prayer.
“Tony!” Steve yelled as he skidded to a halt in the middle of one of the hallways. “Sir, can I help you?” A perturbed older nurse asked, just as James and Sam came jogging up to the scene. “I’m so sorry ma’am, we are looking for our friend, he arrived here by ambulance about half an hour ago.” Sam tried to soothe her. She gave him a very unimpressed look. “Sir, I watch the news, I should hope I recognize the Avengers. I’ve also worked at this hospital for 30 years, Mr. Stark and I are on a first name basis considering how much time he has spent here over that span. He has been treated and is currently unconscious, so no amount of yelling is going to help.” She finished, pointedly narrowing her eyes at Steve.
After a few minutes, her brain starts to come back on line and she puts all of her strength into heaving herself onto her side and rolling her head. What she sees shocks her more than she could ever possible voice. Stark is standing there, a large long metal rod gripped tightly in his hands as he raises it and brings it down on one of the thugs laying at his feet. With the final blow, the thug stops moving entirely and lays boneless at Stark’s feet. She sees a gun discarded down the alley along with the bodies of more of the thugs, riddled with wounds from said gun as well as wounds she recognizes are caused by his armor weapons. Where Stark had gotten the gun from, she had no idea. She turned her attention back to where Stark was up against the last thug standing, the one that had held her by the throat.
They all nodded. "Good. Sergeant Barnes, lead the way." Bucky stepped up and pressed the release button, opening the door.
“I’ve developed an inexplicable habit of adoption without the proper paperwork. Unfortunately, you don’t have much of a say it in it. Welcome to the family, Stardust.”
About 30 minutes later they were headed to the front of the store with a cart full of the strangest assortment of items Sam had ever seen. Tony had insisted on Sam picking out at least three items, saying that he was an important business man and wouldn’t be able to go grocery shopping every time Sam was having a cupboard crisis.
T’Challa stepped forward. “The Counsel is going over evidence against you at this very moment, Ross. This is a very foolish thing for you to do and you will not get away with it. They will issue your termination and a warrant for your arrest. If you hurt him or anyone else, there is no where on this earth that you could go where we will not be able to locate you.”
Steve couldn't help but let out a frustrated noise in his throat. "Tony, your suit would be able to locate her."
He snarled at the voice before throwing almost everything he had into a roundhouse kick aimed at the unfortunate punching bag in their gym at the palace. It split open and angrily he pulled it down and threw it onto the pile with the others that had met a similar fate.
Sam's mouth fell open as Peter unlocked and opened up one of the bins on the large cart and pulled out the Falcon pack and RedWing.
T’Challa greeted him first. “No costume tonight, Spider-Man?” He said with a smile. Peter was about to open his mouth and go into what Steve was sure would have been a Tony-worthy babbling rant, but Shuri stepped in first. “Peter! I brought that
His eyes searched for Tony in the vast wasteland and his breath stuttered again as he saw the carnage in front of them. On top of a large rocky embankment strewn with Chitauri armor was the Hulk. He had been speared through several times with weapons and was heaving large agonizing breaths as his body struggled to stay alive. His breaths sounded deafening in the silence of space.
“Your Highness, I am afraid you have lost me. It is a long journey past the hoards of rabid reporters and UN Delegates to my car, so I hope you can understand that I must cut our conversation short. As you said, we are both busy men.” With that he turned and pushed the heavy polished wood door open with a strength he didn’t feel and held his head high as he exited the building.
“And what exactly do you think you’ll be able to do to me Stark?” Tony didn’t answer, just continued to breath hard. “No answer? Shocking. I bet its taking all of your genius brain cells to try and form a coherent thought past all that alcohol. Tomorrow at the press conference, you’d better be ready to play ball. You can drink yourself into a stupor after you’ve smiled and charmed all of those important people in high places and the media. I don’t care what it takes, as long as it’s quiet, understand?”
He looked up from his desk at the knock on his door. He stood to unlock it and swinging it open he looked down at Shuri, who smiled as she pushed past and walked into the room. “Sure, come on in.” He said, watching her stand in the room and survey his space.
“-while the UN Counsel looks into the claims and evidence that has surfaced. The evidence itself was presented today through the lawyers of Stark Industries, written witness testimony coming directly from Tony Stark himself. Due to the highly classified and sensitive nature of much of the dossier, it has been ordered sealed to the public for the present. It is also still unclear how long Stark Industries has had this information. In a quote from the written statement that came from the company, the lawyers said they needed to postpone giving the evidence until such a time that the authorities could handle the situation safely. This also brings up the issues that arose last year with Stark himself and the Avengers. Schematics for what is referred to only as “The Raft” were released and Channel 7 is being told that during the short time that the old Rogue Avengers were held in government custody, they were being held here, by order of Secretary Ross. It is unclear how much, if any, of the evidence incriminates the Secretary himself. He and his people have been unreachable for a comment.
Steve held him tighter and tried to sooth him, even as Steve began to shed tears with him. “Shh, Tony, please, I know. I know. It happened here too. So many of them. I thought we’d lost you, too. I’m so happy to see you. I thought I’d never see you again.”
“Peter. Peter wasn’t my son, exactly. But I loved him like he was. I wish I’d shown him that a bit more. He wasn’t supposed to be there, he snuck on board the ship. I wouldn’t have risked him like that.”
, and damn but it was beautiful. Tony swallowed a few times, then started biting his lip and Steve could almost hear the gears in Tony’s head turning. He cleared his throat and stepped away from Steve a bit and called out, “FRI, take off the Penthouse restriction. We’re going to need a little help finding out how to get this off our hands.”
After a few beats of silence, she realized her mistake. Dreading what she would find she turned to look at him. He was gazing at her with cautious interest and apprehension.
The building began to sway and Steve watched in horror as Spider-Man tried and failed to keep his grip. He began to slide down, missing the civilian's hands as the roof crumbled in on them. Spider-Man fell to the ground and released and angry growl as he stood up and then rolled to the left to avoid more falling concrete.
"You'll be allowed home. With provisions, as always. But once you sign the Accords, you're past is pardoned and you will be welcomed back into the United States. Clint, Scott, your family will be waiting for you, however you will be required to live at the Avengers Compound, under guardian supervision for a set amount of time. After it is determined that you will comply with the accords and you have proven yourself, those restrictions will be lifted. Your families have already been made aware that you have been pardoned."
"Do you trust yourself to help the Winter Solider, after what happened last time you and he were in a room together?"
Tony tried to channel the darkest thoughts he had experienced over the moments since Siberia. Every drunken and broken idea his imagination had conjured up.
“You will each take a turn in alone in the simulation. I have designed separate scenarios specialized to each of you and your abilities, so no one will encounter the same situation. Do your best to survive and complete the simulation. Once everyone is done, we will discuss what you did right, and what you did wrong.”
“We had a plan. Stark’s plan.” She said, her eyes again finding Steve when he took a sharp breath at the mention of Tony’s name. She ignored him though and continued, “We would do whatever it took to keep Thanos from closing his fist, and while we each took turns trying to hit him, we would attempt to take the Gauntlet from his hand. Strange used his magic and portals to aid us. Together, we beat him down while Mantis tried to calm his mind. Stark and P- the boy - pulled off the Gauntlet, they almost had it…but…”
He smiled at her again, told her how wonderful everything looked and that he owed her his life, because really, it was more than true. They exchanged goodbyes and promises to see each other later and he headed down to his car.
Alright, fair warning, this chapter gets a little dark. There is a surprise twist as the end that some people might like and some others may hate. It is what it is. Also, I know that everyone is looking forward to some Stony conversations. I promise we are SO close, just hang in there!
Clint had listened to Laura relive the last year of their lives, first on the down low with bodyguards paid for by Tony Stark. She recounted a miserable life, one with a lot of fear and constant moving around. Then, one day a few months in, Tony Stark himself had shown up on the doorstep of the safe house they were currently hiding in. He had lost too much weight his eyes were a bit sunken. They sat together and he told her what had really happened with the Accords and Siberia.
Steve glanced up from his spot on the floor for a second before going back to staring out at the rain. “Hey. Yeah, just thinkin’.” James took a deep calming breath.
Clint sat slouched on the edge of the couch in the open common room, rhythmically throwing a small bouncy ball against the wall and catching it. He’d been waiting in this same spot since 2 a.m., after Laura had told him that she had enough talking for the night. It was now 2 p.m. and he had yet to see any sign of the Compound’s resident genius since the night before.
“Oh I will, Stark. I own your pathetic life and you can have it back when the world is done with you. I saw your request to the counsel, by the way. Why do you want to retire?” Steve’s heart sped up with every word. Retire? Since when? Tony couldn’t retire, he was part of the team, they needed him. Steve needed him.
Ross looked malevolent as he stepped forward again into his face, gaining no reaction from Tony, who didn’t move a muscle. He scoffed before letting out a humorless laugh. “Very well, Stark. You know the rules.”
Sam smiled back at her earnestly as Tony clapped him on the shoulder and James started putting items into the fridge with Maggie. Sam turned and spotted Steve on the couch with Scott.
Peter huffed and gave him a stiff nod which Steve returned before turning to follow the others. He was stopped again by Peter’s whisper. “He still loves you.” Steve turned again to look at Peter as the kid said, “Don’t let him down again. Please.”
“Sup, Cap? How was the gym?” He greeted. Tony’s smile faltered a bit at the mention of Steve, but quickly replaced it with his mask. For Steve, that was much worse than if Tony just glared at him.
"Yes, the plan. I am so sorry I had to keep you all out of the loop but now that it's rolling I can tell you. The only way that we get the old team back is if Ross and the others think it was their idea. The Accords need to be amended legally for them to come back safely, but it can't look as if it is for happening for them. We need to make all the mistakes so that they amend them as they should. I've already lined up a few missions that will push those items of concern to the forefront. The last hurdle is to make them think that we are bringing them back because they want them back. Ross wants to make me unhappy because I have been making his life hell. How is he going to do that? By bringing back the one thing he thinks I want to stay gone. I'm out of control, yes, so when was the last time they felt like I was under control? When I had a holier-than-thou Star Spangled bastard keeping me in line. So, they'll want to put me back in line, right? The best way to do that is get him back here, but they can't do that unless they think they can control him too. We all know that the one thing we can rely on to manipulate the good Captain; James Barnes."
“What about other vigilantes and so called superheroes who are operating unchecked on the streets?” Tony lifted an eyebrow, “What about them?”
“Stop that. Stop that right now, I don’t want to hear you say that ever again, and I don’t want you to think it to yourself, either.”
A resounding slap echoed through the feed as Ross backhanded Tony across the face. “I may not have gotten who I came for, but that doesn’t mean I can’t take pleasure in second place.” Ross spat. Tony chuckled as he licked the blood from his lip. “I should have realized you had a hard on for me Ross, since you’ve been so focused on my ‘whoring’.” Ross’ face contorted in rage and he motioned to the guard on Tony’s right. The guard brought the end of his rifle down hard into Tony’s stomach, making him double over in pain.
Steve stood there floored as the sassy kid picked up his book-bag and walked towards the doors. God he was so embarrassed. He wondered if the kid was going to say something to Tony about the way he had practically just leered at him. T’Challa gave the kid a fist bump as he walked by and Steve narrowed his eyes at the King, whose smile only grew as he pushed off the wall and made his way over to where Tony was leaning on the ropes chatting with James. The King continued to stare him down the whole way, obviously delighting in his ability to walk up to Tony while Steve kept his distance.
Steve did his best to present a happy and content front, although T'Challa suspected that no one really bought it, but let it slide anyways. He needed to believe it himself and even if the others knew it was a well acted routine, it was comforting to have Captain America in command none the less. Much of Steve's time was spent running, at the gym in the building, in the vast library where he could read or draw, or down to the basement facility that housed James "Bucky" Barnes in his cryo sleep.
“Is that a threat, King T’Challa?” Ross growled. T’Challa looked every bit the powerful King as he answered, “It is a promise.”
"Yeah, yeah. Next time you decide to stay out until 3 a.m. trolling for trouble, I expect you to own up to it and take it like a man, got it? Alright. I'll be there to pick you up later, Parker."
With all of the sass that could possibly be contained in just her voice, Steve heard repeat her answer again.
In frames along the wall were montages of photographs full of smiles. Lila and Cassie with the easy bake oven, smears of frosting on their cheeks as they threw their arms around each other and smiled for the camera. Tony and Cooper trying to fit as many cake pops as possible into their mouths. Laura, Maggie, and Natasha relaxing in deck chairs with sunglasses holding up glasses of lemonade. Tony in his workshop, eyes crinkling with laughter looking over at DUM-E who just spilled a smoothie all over Rhodes. Tony standing next to Peter with his arm around the boy’s shoulder, practically glowing with pride as Peter held his science fair ribbon up for the camera. Nathaniel, his chubby hands holding Tony’s fingers, trying to walk-stumble into Vision’s outstretched arms. Nathaniel drooling on Tony’s Armani clad shoulder- Tony doing his best to look annoyed- and failing miserably. Peter taking a selfie with all of them squished together on the couch with bowls of popcorn for what must be movie night. Barnes, complete with bedhead, in the kitchen attempting to flip pancakes in the air with a skillet. Tony with Lila sitting on his shoulders and and Barnes with Cassie perched on his, standing in front of a gigantic fish tank. A few cut outs from newspapers and magazines of the Avengers posing together after New York. So many more.
Steve tried to smile hearing Bucky's voice. He had been awake for over 2 weeks now, and Steve had done his best to give his friend his focus and happiness, but Bucky wasn't stupid. He might not always feel like James "Bucky" Barnes all the time, but he still knew when Steve lied. It hadn't taken long for Steve to come clean. Of course, Sam threatening to do it for him might have sped up the process.
Lila turned her gaze back to her mother, then to Tony. Cooper looked furious as he spat out, "Don't call her that."
“I was jealous that you chose James over me in Siberia.” Tony winced as they walked. “Tony I didn’t-” Steve started, but Tony held up a hand and cut him off, saying, “I know, Steve, but that’s what I thought at the time.” He gave a half shrug as they climbed the stairs and stood in front of the doors. Steve hesitated, unsure as Tony pushed open the doors.
A smaller gold trophy caught his eye and he picked it up in his hand to get a close look at it. A ceramic cupcake trophy from a junior bake-off bore the name
Steve had stepped forward without thinking and straightened the tie himself. His fingers pulled the silk through and his knuckles brushed Tony's throat as he worked. Tony's smile had faltered, to be replaced with something so much softer. They had been inches apart, Tony's eyes fixed on Steve's hands. Steve had been focused on trying to keep his hands from shaking. The moment had felt domestic, but, just like so many other moments, it was there and then gone when they were interrupted by Tony's driver arriving.
James opened him mouth to answer but Tony beat him to it, rolling his eyes as he said, “James insists that if you take one from outside, it’s one less that the employee has to retrieve later. He’s a true gentleman like that.”
"I know Tones," He used the nickname he had heard Rhodey use frequently, "I know you are. You're doing too much for everyone else. You gotta do somethin' for you sometimes, punk."
Steve paid no mind though and continued, “And even if I hadn’t been, I see it every time I close my eyes! On top of that, we all saw the memory play out in perfect detail today thanks to your simulation.”
He did his best to focus on washing his hair and body as quickly as possible, but he couldn't help himself, the serum made his urges difficult to control or ignore. Taking himself in hand he took care of his
They barely spoke. They shared the silence, taking turns falling apart and trying to put each other back together in private stolen moments. Steve, carrying a bucket of provisions in a dark hallway when he was suddenly hit with despair so deep he stumbled. He would have fallen too, had Bruce not appeared and steadied him. Okoye and Shuri cling to each other when they have a brief respite from being needed by their country, many times Natasha can be found with them as well, her eyes red.
"Let's go, Ant-Guy, come get the suit." Tony called, setting aside his tablet and pulling out the suit, looking almost bored.
All eyes simply continued to stare at him, no one making a sound. Right, better press on then, he thought.
Things had slowly improved when she had started to come down to the lab while he worked. At first they hardly spoke, she would slide into the lab and sit in the chair at one of his many desks and play games on his computers. She was damn good at those first person shooter ones; it was really unfair to the other online players.
When Tony finally crawled into bed that night he felt like he would be able to sleep for the next few days.
Tony shuffled over to the coffee maker tiredly, not paying much mind to Clint. He decided the best way to let Stark know he was there would be to continue throwing the bouncy ball at the wall.
Realization dawned on James face and he smiled softly at Sam before looking at Tony down the isle, obviously torn between the selections of cookies he was considering.
Shocked, all she can say is, “Why are you here?” Her voice is raspy and broken. She realizes she had yet to hear him speak since Titan, until now.
He had known the King had been there, at the bunker, of course, since it had been the King who had captured Zemo. He would have had to have been. Tony was also quite sure that the only thing that had saved him had been the backup the King must have called, since his suit was completely disabled and he had no way to call anyone, let alone walk away from it himself. His injuries had been more severe than he thought. Tony could only guess now that it had indeed been T’Challa who kept the response team of soldiers who were sent to take Zemo into custody away from the bunker where he had laid.
Peter, who was standing a little further down the line stepped forward to look at Tony with scandalized betrayal. “Oh, he does, see he just stepped forward!” James exclaimed, pointing at Peter’s feet and joining in with Tony.
Tony felt himself shaking, completely given in to the anger and pain that he had felt in the moments since Ste-Rogers had walked away. His acting was good, but it wasn't that good. Part of him knew this was real and it felt good to get some of it out.
"You look like you could use a refill, Mr. Stark." Tony turned toward him, if he was caught off guard by how close the man was, he didn't show it, his eyes returning the appraisal and stepping even closer, taking the offered drink. His answer was too low to be picked up by the microphones, as was the conversation that followed, though it wasn't long before Tony stepped back, his smile large.
Everyone began to quickly clean up all traces that anyone other than Tony had just been in the room, and jumped into the elevator to clear the floor. Nat and Pepper each gave Tony a kiss on the cheek, while the rest of them gave supportive looks or pat him on the shoulder. James turned around, “Tones, are you going to be okay?” Tony nodded at him as he used the hand that wasn’t still stuck to Steve’s to mess up his hair a little. James gave him a last supportive smile as he joined everyone else in the elevator.
Steve leaned against the wall and let his head tilt back against the cool drywall, closing his eyes to focus on Tony's voice. It felt like an eternity since he had been able to just listen to Tony speak.
"Alright everyone, we are going to run some training exercises." Rhodes said as he and James were standing in front of them all.
“You may have wanted to die but you didn’t. You wouldn’t leave me when I asked you to so I’m not going to just leave you. Like it or not we’re stuck with each other, so suck it up and start thinking of how we are going to get the others back.”
"While I wouldn't choose that word exactly, I wont say he's wrong. I would say pathetic is better suited, Tony! You looked pathetic! Are you happy now?" Natasha almost screamed at him.
"Please remind me to get Pepper something especially nice for how hard she worked to pull this together, it really is something else."
Clint was the first to break it. "Wow, well I guess we should have seen that coming, huh? I mean, he and Pepper are done, and he is Iron Man, ain't he? It didn't take him long to- "
“Do you now?” Peter asked. Steve opened his eyes and looked down at the boy in front of him. Peter wasn’t angry or resentful, he looked like he was genuinely asking and seeking something important.
Laura Barton slowly turned and leveled fiery eyes at her husband. Clint was frozen to the spot, and Steve honestly couldn't blame him. The look on Laura's face was anything but welcoming. It was stony and impassive.
Again he shook his head and his lips twisted into a humorless smile before continuing, "I don't think he realized what this whole thing would actually do. Every other time something has happened we have been able to get by with minimal deep loss. We fight and forgive, eventually moving forward. Not this time. We lost family this time around, although no one realized that until it was too late. Tony… Tony meant a lot to all of us, he and Steve together, they were like our dysfunctional parents who constantly bickered, but always came back together in the end."
Bucky sat at the table, just finishing a bagel as Tony came in. He sat up immediately, not sure how he should act around the man, but not letting his guard down completely.
James nodded and responded, “Got it FRI, tell him I’ll be right down.” Steve felt a stab of jealousy. He used to love watching Tony work in his lab, and his favorite was when Tony would ask for his help holding something while he fixed it or anything else Tony would allow him to do.
Pepper stepped in, asking, "Why would anyone want the Winter Solider back, Tony? The public sees him as a murderer, he
Next to Steve, James seemed calm, his eyes appraising the situation, but his taut body language gave him away. The situation was deteriorating out of their hands, quickly.
Thor answered with a heavy sigh and regretful eyes and answered, “No, Rabbit. It is…unlikely that they survived.”
The all sat together in silence for a few minutes before Rhodes replied. “Well I can. Your friend was in trouble and you thought you could save him.”
Sam smiled at him hopefully and nodded before saying breathlessly, "Yes, I would appreciate that very much. Thank you, sir. If the chance comes up, maybe… maybe you could tell Stark the same thing?"
"Alright," he called, "Clint, find yourself a high vantage point, you can cover us from there. Sam, lets have you and Vision in the sky, you be our eyes and let us know where we need to be. Spider-Man, you and I will take evacuation of civilians with Barnes and Ant-Man. Widow you are with Colonel Rhodes, use his suit's capabilities to find the bombs and take Scarlet Witch with you, she can use her force fields to contain the blasts if anything goes wrong."
“Injuries.” He murmurs quietly as he gently places a large hand on her chin and turns her head to the side to take in a deep cut and bruise on her cheek. She jerks her head out of his grasp and pulls her head back to eye him warily.
The first few days with BARF seemed to make a little progress. Barnes didn't completely trust Stark or the equipment, but neither of them had much of a choice.
? If he had truly been in the bunker in Siberia and seen the things he claimed, how did he have the nerve to stand here and ask this of him?
"Madam Peterson, you look absolutely breathtaking tonight! I am afraid I am going to have to steal away King T'Challa for a while, but I believe I just passed your husband coming up the stairs looking for you." The woman all but scowled as she checked over both shoulders for her husband. Tony took advantage of the moment and used his arm on the King's shoulder to steer him away from the woman to the other side of the fountain and toward a table of champagne.
"And then I was standing in that fucking bunker in the middle of fucking nowhere next to someone I had really believed to be my
Steve's smile fell slightly as he mumbled, "No, I know Tony has been doing just fine. I meant Bucky."
Spider-Man continued to hold on to the window of a building, attempting to shield himself from the wreckage coming at them.
He hadn’t bothered to lie about the alcohol or the drug usage, it was clear that he was self medicating. What had surprised her was that he maintained the true reason he was in such a bad state was because he was trying to clean up. He had leaned forward and held her hand lightly, removing his sunglasses and telling her that he had considered Clint family. He didn’t blame Clint, although that didn’t mean what happened didn’t still hurt.
"Damn right. Now I know you are old, but I know you know phones work both ways, so how about one of these days you try using it. If we know one thing about Stark, it's that his stubborn ass will hold a grudge until the day he dies if you don't get that ball rolling. He isn't going to reach out to you, if that's what you've been waiting for."
“She’s not the only shark in the room, don’t sell yourself short.” Bruce said with a parting pat on Tony’s back as they all began to leave the room.
Bucky could only nod at Tony. Looking closer at the lines on Tony's face, the dark circles under his eyes, it became clear why he was backing down so easily, he was just too tired to actually fight with him. The fire that Bucky had seen in Tony's eyes in Siberia had died down, replaced by an exhaustion Bucky had recognized in Steve's blue eyes the day they woke him up in Wakanda.
Sam laughed and with a good natured slap on Bucky's arm he moved his gaze past Bucky to the pilot seat. Steve felt his anxiety level rise again before the occupant stood up and faced the group.
He smiled, a grimacing horrible smile as he looked down to his feet and continued, "I knew it wasn't what she wanted and not what she would have done, but damn it, her whole life she never was able to stand up for herself, so as God was my witness I was going to do it for her. I was going to hate him with everything I had."
So here they all were, the entire Compound and their guests, gathered in the kitchen, trying different solvents and mixtures to try and get the webbing off of Vision’s entire body, and off of Tony and Steve’s joined hands. Wisely, no one had commented or asked how they had gotten their hands stuck together in the first place, though he had more than enough of the looks they were all sending he and Steve when they thought the other wasn’t looking. Tony might have snapped and said something, but to be completely honest he was more focused on the absolutely furious glare that Vision was currently trying to melt him with.
Breathing deeply Steve pushed himself to sprint the last half mile of his early morning run. He reveled in the familiar burn of his lungs as he pushed his body. It seemed like the ghost of a memory now, but he could remember not being able to hardly do anything, for fear it would bring on another bout of asthma. He wondered how often people took for granted the small miracle that it was to be able to simply breathe.
“That’s enough out of the peanut gallery, thank you very much!” Tony called back, his dark eyes never leaving Peter’s.
Nebula had gotten small pieces of Tony’s life as they had travelled. Obviously, she knew who Tony was once he recounted the battle with the Chitauri. She had been with Thanos still at that point. They hadn’t known that Earth’s warrior was Tony himself, but she had known of him.
As they exited the gym Tony chose the stairs instead of the elevator. As they began to climb Steve took a deep breath and began. “Tony, I’ve been trying to learn more about each member of the team, on and off the field. I’d uh. Well. I suppose that I’m trying to ask…” He faltered. Tony’s steps slowed and he turned his head to throw his words over his shoulder to Steve as they continued up the stairwell. “Spit it out Rogers.” He said shortly.
Keeping her mind from wandering is a task she has never had much trouble with – until now. Thoughts and memories of Gamora haunt every step she takes. They had just begun to be sisters, just started to try to understand each other. Thanos had
Steve didn’t think as he slid himself onto the bed in the space where he had been resting his head without letting go of Tony’s hand. “Yeah Tony, it’s Steve, I’m right here, I’m with you.” He assured him, gently running his fingers through Tony’s hair before cupping his cheek and willing Tony to open his eyes. Tony didn’t open his eyes, but he pushed his cheek into the warmth of Steve’s palm and relaxed a bit.
"NO STEVE. No. Do not apologize. It's not a secret that I don't lose any sleep over Tony Stark. But, I know that you do, and you have even before this whole thing began. Stop pretending everything is alright. It's not, so tell me what you want to do about it?"
Ross took a step closer to the counter and growled, “You’re on thin ice, Stark.” Tony gave a tight smile and said, “God, I hope so. I’m getting really tired of this shit.”
Tony and James began to become closer friends everyday. James gets along very well with everyone else, and with each BARF session they complete together, Tony can see James grow in persona and confidence.
I went completely insane. I had the strength to resist for only one moment of clarity, as I used it to look into the eyes of the man I trusted with every piece of me, and ask him if he
Upon stepping on the floor and seeing Laura and Clint in the armchairs, Tony’s face was guarded for a second before he gave them a small nod. He began to usher the kids down the hall to their rooms, declaring it was “Past my bedtime, so I know it’s way past yours!”
“I think I’d scare him, if I ever said it, but… well, Mr. Stark, he kinda saved me.” Peter mumbled. “It’s not that I don’t like you, sir, but…He’s my family and you hurt him. What you see now, that’s months and months of work from Nat, Rhodes, James, Laura, Maggie, me, all of us. You didn’t see him after, you didn’t have to see how you broke him.”
"I know, Pep, I'll be on my best behavior." He winked at her and she smiled, but it didn't reach her eyes. They both knew the drinking was carefully concealed, but still ever present none the less.
The voice of Pepper Potts interrupted anything else the kid was going to say. "Hey, Tony wants you to come in, he says he's got a bruise that looks like a spider-web, wanna come see?"
"Widow and Patriot, why did you let Scarlet Witch out of your sight?" He asked, turning and addressing them.
“Tony?” She asked. “Yes?” Tony hesitated. “Stop. Just make sure you’re here at 3.” Tony nodded with a smile and said, “You got it, Potts.”
“And Captain Rogers?” He asked. He and Laura glanced across the room at Steve, who was looking like he was in deep trouble with Pepper. “Natasha said that he took it really hard. Got physically sick. He was pale and shaking when James and Sam brought him upstairs and took him to his room for a long time. They only came out a little bit before you got here. I’m not really sure what is happening. He was distraught and Tony… well Tony actually tried to be kind. He had the girls make Steve a cupcake, and he let Steve hold Nate.” T’Challa’s eyebrows shot up at that. “Did he now?” Laura nodded. “It’s giving me whiplash to watch. They’re dancing around each other, but every time I try to bring it up to Tony he shuts it down.”
About ten minutes later Tony emerged from the door to the stairwell. He was smoothing down his suit and trying to put his disheveled hair back into place. His lips were red and his face slightly flushed, a small bruise starting to form just peeking out from under the collar of his shirt.
As he poured, Steve moved his left hand and laid it over Tony’s hand that was holding the glass. At the contact Tony jerked a bit and the steady pour splashed and spilled for a moment before he gained control again and set the carton down. Steve could see Tony’s reflection in the dark window as he stared at the counter hard, the muscle in his jaw working. Steve kept his hand firmly in place over Tony’s as he dipped his head and nuzzled the spot where Tony’s neck and shoulder met.
“Can’t! I have to keep it separate! I cannot call you S-… I can’t do it.” He shrugged tiredly, helplessly. “If I open that door again, I know I can’t close it.”
"Tony, I can't-" But a smile from him and his finger to her lips silenced her before he continued, "Nat, I wouldn't have it any other way."
The King let out a full laugh now. Tony pretended to be insulted. “Come on, we can work something out. How about she lives here with us every other weekend and holidays?”
“And I heard you the first time, Stardust.” He replied, a small smile tugging at the corners of his lips.
“What, no, just- I’m hungry-” He stuttered, obviously uncomfortable at being confronted with his fruitless food search.
Natasha replied, "He's at the hospital, he wont leave Tony's side." Rhodes nodded, "Should we call?"
Wanda buried her face in Vision’s chest. Shuri’s furious typing on Tony’s tablet drew the room’s attention. “Tony and I designed an implant together months ago, after he scared everyone by drinking so much he was put in medical. We wanted a way to make sure that he could be checked in on by others if he couldn’t trust himself.” Steve struggled to breathe through her revelation. “It is tiny, no bigger than the head of a pin, but it records and transmits audio, video, vitals, location, all of it. He had it implanted in his eye months ago. I have accessed it many times, I am accessing it now. We can find out where he is and make sure he is alright.”
On legs that felt like they might suddenly give out, he forced his steps to approach the cart and peer into the bin. He barely managed to contain the sob threatening to tear from his throat when he saw the shield.
Back on the ship, Nebula watched as Stark shifted in his seat with a grimace of pain as he held his hand to his injured side.
The relaxed look that had been on Tony’s face slid off as Rhodes words hit him. Turning toward the large screen in the corner of the room he called out to FRIDAY, “FRI, que it up babe.”
T'Challa turned and slowly crept away and back up the stairs. He had heard enough. He was almost at the top when he nearly ran into Sam's chest. He stepped back abruptly and looked up into the mans face as he stared down at the King on the step below.
It had been painful, to say the least, but they had gotten to know each other on a much deeper level than he ever thought would have been possible. After they had downed the bottle of vodka and were halfway through a second, they had both been a lot more open. She even told him about what her childhood and training had been like. Neither of them had the life that was picture perfect, though many thought his seemed to be. They had been bent and broken so far and yet both of them had picked themselves up, dusted themselves off, and kept walking with their head held high.
"You know what that asshole did to me and to every single thing I care about? What all of them did to me? They took absolutely everything I had and then the cowards ran away! They crippled Rhodes, that witch almost killed Vision, and oh so righteous Captain fucking America and his psychopath boyfriend nearly ripped out the thing that keeps me alive! When they couldn't accomplish that, the Hero of the Free World brought down the shield that my father, the father that he
Surprised, Steve had asked where they had gone and FRIDAY had told him quite clearly that he didn’t have clearance for information like that. Scott tried to suppress a smirk at how much the AI obviously wasn’t a Captain America fan. Steve wasn’t impressed. Instead, they sat down on the couches and Scott turned on the history channel and tried to annoy Steve by asking which details were accurate and which weren’t. Even when Steve reminded him that he hadn’t been around for the 1960’s, Scott continued to ask the questions. Steve rolled his eyes fondly, knowing that Scott was trying to distract him.
Suddenly, moments and memories that were not her own began to flash through her brain, with emotions and sensitivity accompanying them.
He had thought about offering to install something upstairs for her until it occurred to him that he already had. Many of them. That way Ste-Rogers could watch the History Channel and other shit while Clint, Sam, and Thor played on the TV Console. For some reason she was choosing to spend her time with him while he swore at his robots and tinkered on all of his tech. He supposed it might be to keep an eye on how much he drank while he was down there.
"Come on man, be honest. It's seeing him again isn't it? Seeing him with the reporter and that guy at the party. I'm going to lay it all out here with you, I've seen you with your phone in one hand hounding the internet for news and information on Stark, and that old fossil flip phone in your pocket. You never go anywhere without it. I've seen you wandering around at night, coming down here and talking to Barnes, and if that wasn't all enough, I have seen some of the sketches."
Tony only smiled wryly. "Good. As long as having that sleaze ball's hands all over me was worth it."
"The UN Security Council has pardoned Sergeant Barnes of all crimes committed while under the influence of the Hydra and The Winter Soldier Programing."
talk to Laura. Apparently Laura had told him that she was ready to talk about things between them. The kids would not be there, she had stressed that fact, but it was a start and Clint jumped at the chance.
A small sniff came over the comm before a trembling voice said, "I'm here." As the face of a young male teenager moved into the camera sight. His eyes were red and watery, a few small cuts on his temple and a bruise on his cheekbone.
Steve was against the wall his head tipped back on the cool surface, an arm thrown over his eyes. Sam slowed down as he approached him and stood next to him against the wall.
him. He put a news thingy on his phone for all subjects ‘Tony Stark’ and kept up to date on everything you did cause he was worried something would happen and he wouldn’t be there for you. He collapsed when he saw the video of you grinding up on that asshole at the Gala. When I was pardoned he couldn’t ask about you on any of our phone calls cause the thought that you were happy without him was hurtin’ him so bad. He’s constantly trying to maintain his focus on anythin’ but you when you’re in the room, usually he fails miserably. He was outta his mind with worry when Ross took you, the rest of the team had to physically hold him back. He begged to come with us but T’Challa wouldn’t let him. He made a huge scene bustin’ into this hospital and screaming your name. He nearly went to pieces at your bedside and held vigil like fuckin’ statue over you, refusing to leave your side even to eat or sleep.” Tony listened silently. “So you tell me, who actually admitted it first?”
As he looked around he saw the other members of the team having the same reaction. Tony's voice came over the comms, saying,
, Maggie had reminded him. As Scott channel surfed the elevator opened again. This time, Peter Parker came stumbling out, out of breath and sporting a gigantic smile, clutching his backpack to his chest. The excitement was rolling off of the kid in waves as he came nearly running to the counter and fished in his backpack for a paper.
Suddenly, the darkness of space shifted and a completely unwelcome and familiar scene of the bunker in Siberia came into focus around them. Steve felt another sob rip through his chest at the panic and pain in Tony’s eyes as he stared at James.
“Uncle Tonnyyyy!” Cassie whined. Tony looked at the children with wide innocent eyes. Making a big show, he turned and rifled through some of the bags. “Let’s see, what do we have here. Some asparagus?” The disgusted look on the kid’s faces said it all. “No? How about some cauliflower?” The kids looked still unimpressed. “Oh, you couldn’t possibly mean these?” He said as he pulled out three candy bars. At the sight of the chocolate the children began to cheer.
Steve had come to realize over his time in Wakanda, his biggest fear was that of the unknown future. If there was one person who embodied unknowable and future, it was Tony Stark.
Steve continued to stare at the other man as he opened up to them all about his and Tony’s relationship. “The first time I met Tony was at MIT. We were roommates and he was 15.” He smiled at Tony as he remembered the young boy. “Everywhere he went he was the smartest in the room. Everyone knew who he was because of his family, and everyone thought they would be able to use him. Of course, just like any other 15-year-old kid, Tony wanted to be liked. He partied hard and fast but it never affected his school work, he passed with flying colors, so no one caught on that he was burning himself out. We weren’t close so I didn’t even realize what was going on with him until one night he came stumbling into our room at 3 in the morning. Immediately I knew something was wrong, he was so strung out I don’t know how he even found the dorm. His breathing was erratic and his eyes were glassy. I did what I thought was best, I shoved him into the car and drove him to the hospital where they told me he had overdosed. His parents showed up a while later. Maria was frantic for her son, but Howard…” Rhodes shook his head. “Howard wasn’t thrilled when the doctor told him about the drugs but he was just plain livid when the doctor asked how long Tony had been sexually active with other men. They took him from the hospital that night and I didn’t see Tony again for a week. When I did, he was sporting one of the worst black eyes I’d ever seen. He didn’t blame me for taking him to the hospital that night, but he asked me to never do it again. I began to realize that after every visit home, Tony would come back with some kind of injury. Eventually, Tony nearly refused to go home at all, even though it broke his mom’s heart.”
As Sam read the message, he ran into a solid wall of Captain America. Peeking out from around Steve's broad back, he saw the others still gathered on the couches, watching the large television screen. Playing on the screen, a video of Tony Stark in a stairwell, pressed up against the wall with another man's tongue down his throat.
The room was dark, windows blacked out, and James let his eyes adjust for a moment and strained his ears to pick up any noises. After surveying the room his eyes found Tony sitting on the floor of the bathroom, his knees drawn to his chest, elbows on this knees, his hands threaded through his hair clutching his head as he struggled to breathe.
Peter nodded and tried to wipe the sweat off his forehead with his arm. “Alright, gloves up?” Tony asked. Peter nodded and they began to trade jabs again, Peter dancing around Tony and trying to stay light like Happy always kept telling him. From the sidelines he heard Bruce call, “Come on kid, you’ve got this. Knock him on his ass!” He couldn’t help the smile on his face, hearing the scientist whose picture was on the wall of his classroom at school, rooting for him to take down the billionaire in the ring across from him.
I am SO sorry this update has come so late! I have had so much going on lately with work and school. Updates will be coming often from now on.
“Right. Try not to get distracted on the field, Rogers. You’ve got ten missions with this view.” He quipped as the left Steve standing in the stairwell alone.
Tony knew Ross wouldn't be stupid. Each "mistake" was carefully calculated. The last "mistake" had been designed to show the issue with response and approval time the Accords had previously set. Tony made sure that there weren't civilian casualties, but the damage to the city and structures had been more than significant. The UN Counsel decided that a change was needed so that the next time something came up, Tony and his team would have a way to respond without needing the vote of the entire Counsel. Instead, he would only need approval from one of any of the top three Chair Members. No calling a meeting, no holding a vote, and yet still some regulation.
"If you've seen that video, I would damn well hope that your brain works better than to honestly think shit like that. That monster
Steve had finally seemed a little more comfortable with the child in his arms and had sat down in a chair in the corner, reveling in the innocent eyes and toothless smile the child in his arms was looking up at him with. His heart did flips at each smile the little boy gave him and he didn’t even notice that he had started to make silly faces at him to try and draw out more. He was so enraptured by the child that he didn’t see Tony look at him softly and slowly approach them, motioning for Lila and Cassie to follow him.
They made quite a pair. Clutching at each other like they depended on it to live, tears streaming between them.
Moving further into the room he tried to avoid stepping on lego pieces as he looked at the many items hanging on the walls; pictures, posters, framed antiques, etc. A large poster of Iron Man,
As usual, she was on an important phone call putting together last minute preparations, so he waited and looked around until she finished.
Steve’s jaw snapped shut and his cheeks turned red as his wide eyes turned to Peter, incredibly embarrassed at being not only caught, but called out by a teenager. Peter smirked at him as he removed his gloves. Remembering the words that Steve had said in one of the last simulations they had run, he decided to echo them back to him.
Peter clutched the paper in his hand tightly as he ran up to Tony excitedly and pushed the paper into Tony’s free hand.
Steve almost wanted to argue, but Clint gave him a slightly bashful look as he said, “Just got a little distracted Cap, ‘m head wasn’t in the game. Nat got in a lucky kick, that’s all.” Steve saw the small smile Natasha gave Clint and the soft one he returned to her. The pieces clicked in Steve’s head at that. It was a free shot Clint had let Natasha take as his apology. He wanted to roll his eyes and ask why Super-Spies couldn’t just apologize like normal people but thought better of it.
“And then suddenly I am awake and they are telling me that I am some kind of hero and they need me to fight. I had just woken up Tony. I woke up to find out that everyone I cared about was gone, long dead, but for me it was like it was yesterday. Can’t you understand that loss? Even a little bit? I was thrown into a world that called me a hero when I didn’t deserve it, but they said it like it was a hard truth and I couldn’t argue. I dealt with all of this grief quietly, visiting Peggy in the hospital, trying to find a way to dissuade the guilt. And then suddenly, Bucky was back and he was in trouble, but this time, I could save him. This time, I could catch him before he fell again. I had to Tony, I had to do it. I couldn’t fail him a second time.”
Guys. I love Science Squad. I had so much fun writing this part. I love the idea that Tony thinks Shuri is amazing. It astounds me that some people think he would be jealous or feel intimidated by her. That's ridiculous. Tony would adore her.
"Tony?" Steve called out. He knew that Tony was watching the simulation, he had to know where Wanda was and her state.
"If you are expecting a warm welcome from any of us, you'll be disappointed for a long time, Barton." Rhodey called back from his seat.
Rhodes flew over them then, holding on to Natasha's arm and dropping her in between Steve and James on the ground before landing a few feet away.
“Do you still love him, then?” She pressed. Tony’s eyes snapped to hers at that. “Why would you-” She cut him off, “He still loves you, very much. Being so close to you, but being so far from your affections, it is hurting him greatly. I can think of no other reason that you would be able to forgive the others and not him.”
“If I have to follow those rules so do you.” He called in return to her retreating back. She turned around and found his gaze on her, his eyes holding more life now.
“We,” Natasha gestures between herself and Tony, “are both clothed Barton, in case it escaped your notice, and we were
“I’m confused; how far exactly did you think you’d get?” Rhodes spat in his face. Ross groaned as he writhed on the ground at their feet. Natasha scoffed and T’Challa said, “Colonel Rhodes, Vision, would you mind taking this piece of filth to the authorities?” The face plate on War Machine came down as he grabbed Ross by the upper arm and hauled him to his feet. “In one piece, Colonel.” He warned with a smile as Rhodes and Vision took off with Ross in tow.
It looked absolutely beautiful, Tony had to admit. Pepper had really outdone herself, he would need to make sure he groveled and praised her for the next few weeks at least.
were intended. I believe that you and I are well equipped to do such a thing. You do not need to give me your answer now, you may think on it and get back to me.”
He had whispered. No no no no Tony is sorry. So sorry. Peter was his responsibility, his death, his fault. Peter was his boy, his… his son. The son he so desperately and selfishly wanted to believe fate would let him hold on to and do right by. And he was just…gone. He lets out a small sob against his fist pressed to his mouth.
After he started to put his shattered pieces back together he had apologized and started to keep in regular contact with Peter, though he was careful. If Peter called while he was in a bad way he had FRIDAY make up an excuse and, after he had pulled himself together, he would return the call immediately. Peter was one of the very few people he still felt the need to put a show on for, because the kid was simply
His mind began to swim in the moments between being conscious and falling into the darkness. He didn’t know exactly where he was and he couldn’t make out the noises or voices around him. Vaguely he wondered if everyone else was okay. A pair of sad blue eyes stood out in his mind.
Steve raised his head to look into Sam's amused eyes. "What makes you think I'm in love with him?" Sam snorted in response before answering in the most condescending voice he could muster, "I told you not to try and bullshit me, man. Answer the question."
She leveled Thor with a tempered glare and said, “I did not do it for any of you. I did it for him.” At that, she turned and started back up the ramp, calling for Rocket to help her unload some of the things off the ship that she and Tony had gathered in their three weeks of absence.
They were all gathered together on the lowest underground level of the Compound. A floor none of them had even known existed until now. Earlier that morning Rhodes had asked everyone to meet there, and he told them to come in their uniforms and gear. Walking in, it was clear that the gigantic space was designed as some kind of a training room. It was several football fields in length.
T'Challa's voice brought him back to the conversation at hand. The King clearly felt he needed to clear one thing up.
“You really ought to watch that, Cap. Out on the field, distractions can get people hurt.” He murmured as he gave him a sloppy two finger salute and ducked under the ropes to pass him. Sam was doing a terrible job of covering his snorting laughter at Steve's side.
All the people in the room turned their attention back to the Rogue Avengers. It was like they hadn't even realized that they were there when they came in. So focused on "Uncle Tony", Scott and Clint's families hadn't even realized their fathers were in the same room as them.
“And Steve can be pretty dense. He thought they came from you, but he wasn’t sure how you found them.” He returned.
It was too much, and after his talk with T'Challa, Sam had already decided that he was going to confront Steve about it at his next opportunity. He wouldn't watch his friend drown in his misery like this. Sam himself has always been a big believer that there is always a way to fix things and make amends.
“You didn’t even bother to use your brain. I’m assuming you do have a brain, don’t you? The only other Terran I’ve met was Quill and I was really hoping that he was an exception, not the rule.” Even as she said it, the words twisted wrongly inside of her chest. Quill was gone and even though she hadn’t exactly liked him, he had meant something. Gamora had found something worth loving in him.
Coming VERY soon: Science Squad! Amazing Shuri! Tony and Steve's first confrontation since they arrived. I'm very excited about these, I hope you are too!
“Alright Stark!” Clint yells, making both Nat and Tony jump, Nat falling unceremoniously on the floor. Her reflexes are quick though, a hand shooting out to grab Tony’s wrist. Or the bracelet on his wrist?
“She wanted to compete so badly.” Laura’s voice behind him startled him. He turned to look at her as she continued, “They kept airing the stupid commercials about it. Tony saw how much she wished she could be in it, so he pulled some strings. Obviously, she couldn’t compete with her own name, so Tony told her to choose one.” She smiled softly at the little trophy. “She did.”
Steve tried to contain his frustration and anger. He was distracted when the screen came to life, filtering in footage. The picture focus was clear and the voices unmistakable. Ross was seated across from Tony; who’s glance was on the guns of the soldiers next to him before his gaze snapped back to Ross when he spoke. “Well, well. It seems that your little team is closer than we were all led to believe.” He leaned forward with his elbows on his knees. “You
Ross knew he hit a nerve here and pressed forward without delay. “Oh please, the world knows who you really are, Stark. They’re happy to pretend to ignore it, you being a hero and all, but no one really thinks you’ve changed. Besides, that video of you in the stairwell at your Gala with that UN Member’s brother, and then miraculously you have the last vote you needed for your friend, The King of Wakanda, to push through the vote on Captain Rogers?” Tony’s hand held Steve’s tighter at this revelation. Steve watched Tony shut his eyes and exhale heavily.  Ross continued, “I warned you, Stark, you may be a genius, but you don’t know how to play this game like I do. You can whore your way through the entire senate, it wont make a difference. Remember that tomorrow when you stand in front of those cameras.”
Steve stood there as the exchanges happened. He didn’t dare move, even if he thought he could. Finally, Tony turned towards him, his large eyes full of grief. He opened his mouth and let out a choked, “Steve.”
From the look on Tony’s face, Steve would guess that no, he didn’t remember in the slightest. He didn’t even bother hiding his amused smile as Tony tried to cover it up.
Bucky's face was near childlike glee when he snickered and said, "Tony, I can't give it back, I'm kind of…attached to it." Bucky could hardly contain the sly grin on his face at his own joke.
"What?" Steve whirled around to stare Scott. "If you knew they were already gone, why didn't you get out?"
Tony turned and put a hand on his shoulder. “I know you’re pissed, I get it. I’m sorry I didn’t fill you in on how this would go down. I’m going to go shower, then I’m going to try not to stab my eyes out with a pen as I suffer through a meeting with the SI Board, and then I’ll be back and you can beat your frustration out in the simulation, alright?”
Finally, after an awkward moment where Steve called Tony a pet name and Peter’s face had gone so red T’Challa worried he had stopped breathing, Tony had called out to FRIDAY to take the restrictions off. Instantly, most of them shot up out of their seats and took either the elevator or the stairs back down to the communal floor. There was a brief moment of awkwardness as they all entered the floor, but Tony quickly swept it away as he asked that, “Someone, please, for the love of God, get this shit off of our hands.”
“Uncle Tony said that they were bringing home treats and we were going to have guests, like a party! They said they would be here soon. Mommy and Auntie Laura said that if we were having guests we needed to clean up down here.”
Tony’s smell was overwhelming whenever Steve was in the same room with him, but to be standing almost pressed up against him and have his face buried in his neck, Steve felt intoxicated by it.
Sam was the next to move forward, picking his pen up and signing his name. With a pat on Steve's shoulder he stood and headed toward his own rooms. Steve knew how much he had wanted to go home as well.
Sam sat down heavily on the mat, resting is arms on his bent knees. T'Challa followed his movement and sat across from him in the same manner.
After greeting Wanda and Clint, he grabbed a towel from the closet and threw it over his shoulders, about to head to the bathroom for a real shower when he heard a noise from the basement. Pausing, he listened intently and heard the voices again. It sounded like Bucky, he must be on a video chat with T'Challa downstairs.
