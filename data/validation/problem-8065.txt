I swear there’s going to be some sexy times for him and Tony. And of course them finding their forever home. I still have a lot planned for them 😊
Steve smiles at the thought of another baby. He had been unsure about bringing another child into the world, but now he didn’t feel as scared. His world wasn’t dangerous anymore. He didn’t have to worry about Hydra. He was safe now.
“It’s for Peter. I promised him a suit once I get back.”
Natasha lets out a sigh and hugs Morgan close. “They do care. They’re trying to figure out how to keep up. That doesn’t mean ignoring you is right but I don’t think they’re doing it intentionally. They love you so much.”
Stark Tower, just like the rest of the buildings around it, was already open and ready for a new day. People are entering through the front doors, dressed nicely in their professional attire, but none of them bother to grab Peter’s attention. He only had eyes for one person.
“He’s harmless.”
He’s not sure how long they’ve been locked together. Tony’s in some kind of a haze, the effects of his rut and the omega’s pheromones are too strong.
“Should we even bother?” Steve can’t believe he’s asking such a ridiculous question. Deep down he wants nothing more than for them to keep trying until they get lucky, but that little voice in the back of his mind decides to speak up, reminding him of their already failed attempts. What good would another try do? For all he knew they’d end up with the same result.
“You feel so good,” Tony grunts and thrusts forward, burying himself completely in Steve’s tight heat. Steve smiles up at him and stretches out his hands, begging Tony to come closer. Tony drops down, using his arms to steady himself.
Leaving Steve was one of the hardest things he’s ever had to do. It was a stupid and cowardly act to walk away from the one person he couldn’t live without. It was his fault. He let his own issues and fucked up past get in the way.
Steve takes him upstairs and Tony follows, ridding himself of the belt around his waist. They’re all exhausted from a night of trick or treating and the party. Peter even more so.
Peter looks up from the screen, his interest piqued. “What is it?”
Steve quickly shuts off the water and steps out of the shower, drying himself and wrapping a towel around his waist. He waits for another cramp to come, but when it doesn’t, he wonders if it’s run its course.
Peter nods again. “Yeah.”
Tears burn his eyes and he wipes at them angrily when they fall. His hormones were all over the place; every day it seemed like they were getting worse. This was all supposed to be normal, but Steve couldn’t believe that either.
“I said I was done. Why is that so hard for you to understand?”
Tony knows he shouldn’t consider Steve adorable anymore, but it was difficult when left over feelings lingered and his heart refused to get the hint that they were broken up and going back to being just friends.
Peter is standing still, the glasses held loosely in his hand and tears streaming down his face. Tony doesn’t even hesitate to run toward him and pull him into his arms. Peter cracks, releasing a painful sob and clinging onto Tony tightly. The glasses slip from his fingers and hit the floor.
“Alpha, please!” Steve begs, wrapping his legs around Tony’s waist to bring him closer, deeper.
Peter eventually finds his aunt at the shooting range. He lingers in the entryway, watching her shoot the targets with perfect accuracy. She never misses, proving that she was the best at what she did. He knew she was a skilled assassin and spy, but to him she would always be his aunt first. The best aunt in the world. He wonders if she still has the mug he got her for Christmas with those same words printed on the front.
“I’m sorry too. I guess we don’t know how to talk to each other.”
“Call it, Captain.”
She grinned victoriously at Steve, who pressed his face into a pillow and groaned.  “Please, tell us more.”
NOTE: If you’re more curious about the island, I am taking as much as possible from reality.  Korkyra in the Dorian dialect is Kerkyra (the rest of the world calls it Corfu).  The island likely wouldn’t have had permanent Greek residents at this time period (it was colonized by Eretria, then Corinth, in the early Archaic period), and certainly wasn’t a polis with a kingship.  But.  Hey.  Fanfiction.   (I’m pretty sure I’ve done more research than plenty of historical fiction writers, so there.  Like, I’m reading archeological papers on the locations of the ancient harbors, and am attempting to reconstruct an ancient map of the island because there are only modern ones.)  The island is a pretty busy tourist attraction, not for the ruins but because it’s BEAUTIFUL.  Crystal aquamarine waters and bright green foliage and craggy mountains and cliffs and beaches and sea caves.  So if you’re wondering what it looks like . . . Google is your friend.  Perfect location to . . . I don’t know, fall in love.

“The red end of a head of a match.”
Why did Pepper always talk like he was some sort of bratty four-year-old she had to take care of?
“We were wondering if you could give us any info on Stark’s condition?”
“Why are you so interested?”
Tony closed his eyes again.
The man was
Steve was breathing deeply, more at ease than Tony had ever seen him.

“But, Steve –
“I can take
He hadn’t been as torn up about it as he might have been, because of what had developed against his will when she had been gone, and he wasn’t able to control it, and she probably understood and saw it before he could name what he was feeling.
Tony decided he would savor this night, for what it was worth.  If he was lucky, maybe he wouldn’t need to sleep ever again.
Too strung out to care about enforcing his self-imposed boundaries, Steve swung Tony into his arms bridal-style.  After an indignant squeak, Tony huddled closer.
Steve sighs heavily, then speaks like he’d rehearsed it for hours trying to convince himself.  “The Avengers are your family – “
“What is it?” Steve asked as he carelessly ripped the tape off for Tony.  Tony spared just enough energy to shoot him a half-hearted glare before flipping the box open, and pulling out several plastic displays and sample cards.
Here . . . people seemed free to run in and out of the domicile of the king with impudence.  It was almost welcome.  Well, not even almost.  Not a lofty perch from which to observe like Olympus, but a vital nerve center.
As much as they complain about the difficulties, that’s what makes life worth it.
“It’s a full.”
, but just like Happy being my chauffeur, they act mainly as personal assistants. But whereas Happy is the one who picks up my lunch, Pepper is the one to shove the papers I need to sign into my face. I guess you could say she’s the one who handles the business aspects. She’s also very good at nagging, so if you were wondering why Happy’s complaining . . . .”
Steve chuckled and pulled him close.  “Happy Day After Valentine’s Day.”
“Where are you headed?” Sam asked.
They break up before it gets really bad, and Tony’s grateful that they can have what they do.  She deserves someone who can give her more than a kiss goodbye in the morning or distracted mutterings as he runs from the room to try out a flash of idea.
The person on the other side of the line answers.
“Well, about time you got your ass back!” Rhodey shouted, hurling himself down the porch and into Tony, looping an arm around Tony’s shoulders as he dismounted.
All for naught.  Tony wasn’t missing a second of this.
“We can’t be waiting around!  Do you
The cautiously hopeful smile on Steve’s face was all the answer he needed.
“Doctor Banner, now might be a really good time for you to get angry.”
All Tony can think after a moment is
“Can’t finish it unless you let go,” Steve chuckled.  Tony pouted, but released him, and Steve began picking through the broth for the bay leaves.
“I don’t want to do it.  I never needed to.  Genius, you know.”
He shouldn’t have looked, because it’s filled with
There was the buzz of her Widow’s Bites, and another male grunt of pain.
“They get the color by adding some sort of gold product.  Gold, ruby glass . . . is it bad I was reminded of you?”
Another of the men leaned forward.  “Just what would it take to fix the problem?”
hoards.  They aren't just made up of eighty bazillion coins.  No, dragons hoard whatever they see as valuable.  Most of the hoards he has seen (because while dragons are protective of them, they are also proud) are composed of books and art.  Though there are plenty of shiny things.
They were quite for a while, before Tony said “I’m sorry.  I should have known you’d been here before.”
Tony frowned.  “It’s not my specialty, but I helped with the planning and execution of a few projects in Athens.  Last winter, we cut stone and ran pipe from one of our acropolis’s springs so there could be a dedicated fountain in the kitchen yard.”
“What is

Maybe he should have raced in the armor.

With a groan, he pulls his phone out, and hits the 8 on speed dial. As it rings, he hunches over, wrapping an arm around his knees. Large cold drops fall slowly, dampening his hair and beading on his phone.

“Hermes isn’t just anyone,” Bruce pointed out slowly.

“I’m not trained in personal protection.”
“I will be sure to remember that,” Fury said as he rose from his couch.  “I have not been to Zancle since the reign of your late grandfather.  So it might be time.”
Pepper had the distinction of being Howard’s oldest child.  He had fathered her on a hapless slave girl, who had died in childbirth.  Pepper had fortunately lived, suckled by one of the many old nurses and brought up to follow in the aging Jarvis’ footsteps.  Occasionally Tony wondered why Pepper had not been exposed outside the city walls, but was thankful to whatever god ordained it that she hadn’t been.
Long story short, Tony had become a hero, the likes of which hadn’t been seen since the Trojan War en masse.  The only other heroes to come out of the generations that had passed since had been two leaders who had together pretty much single-handedly (or dual handedly?) won the Hydric War: Karnis of Thebes, the marvelous lady captain of their army and the daughter of Kalliope, and Stephanos of Athens, the King of Korkyra.
He begins to surround himself with stone again.  Nothing too drastic, but granite countertops and marble floors in the bathrooms.  Black basalt for stairs, river stones in place of landscaping.
His fingers were black with charcoal, and occasionally he mistook it for the smoke of burned bodies.
"Guide?  For like learning dragon-y things?"
“I’m not a baby ducking. I’m a badass,” Rhodey mutters dourly.
“Then
“Okay. Maybe you could start you own team?”
There isn’t necessarily any right way to kiss, but there are some wrong ways. Steve’s not what Tony would call skilled, but it’s not as though Steve spend a ton of time making out with people. He’s got slightly too much in terms of teeth, but Tony likes it. It’s fierce, brave even, but it so goddamn fucking honest. This is what Steve wants, and Tony can do nothing but reciprocate.
Steve could probably admit that he wasn’t in his best form.  Which wasn’t

He remembers her wolfish smile as she nibbled at one of her eye cucumbers.
“Then it’s best you don’t ask it.”
Steve frowned, eyebrows scrunching together.  “Mind your own business, Barton,” he mumbled as he burrowed into his fleece cocoon.
“Well,” Tony began awkwardly, “my father’s family tree begins with Theseus.  Or Poseidon, if you want.  He had two sons with Pheadra, Demophon and Acamas, who both fought in the Trojan War.  They were all run out of Athens eventually, except for Daphoenissa, Theseus and Pheadra’s daughter.  She had a son by Hermes, Stheino, who eventually became king.  Stheino had my father, Hoples, and well, then came me.”
“We do.  But we tend to save that for when we can lounge about sipping with grace.”  And Tony could tell that it was mirth that was dancing in the man’s eyes.  So he hadn’t completely fucked up.  “Water makes the vines grow.  Can’t be that awful.”
who was interested in the baby.
He looked away.  He just wanted to hold his children.  Was that too much to ask?  Was it so terrible that he preferred being called “Papa” and “Pops” over “Captain”?
The look on Steve’s face was purely thunderous.  “I don’t – I don’t want a royal marriage, Tony.  I want a partner, an equal.  I
He’s always been impressed, because goddamn, that serum has the serious side effect of making Captain America into an actual sex machine, but it’s different, now.  They never put a name on it.  It just . . . happened.  They fell into bed, had mind-blowing sex, and aside from Steve making sure that Tony and Pepper were indeed on one of their frequent “breaks”, they never talked about it.  It’s wasn’t supposed to be . . . serious, or anything, just a means to an end.  The need to be close to someone, but someone who was just as much of a mess, someone who was too emotionally compromised to make something permanent with the other.  Relieving stress with someone who understood, someone who was too messed up for anything serious at the moment, someone who could keep a secret.
“Oh, I think he’d prefer a Captain America one.”  She looked at him expectantly.
“Technically, that was two questions, you just phrased it as one –“
“You can’t pull off violet,” Rhodey scoffed.
He knew that it did no use to dwell on prophesies, and he wasn’t sure if this could even be considered a proper prophesy, but as it was in his nature, Tony’s mind stated to wander.
“Are you all . . . nymphs?”
Recording Tony pauses, then leans closer into the camera.
The rest had fallen quiet during their heated discussion.  Clint was dabbing a cloth at his wine-stained beard and tunic, Sam had his eyes averted as he scratched Redwing with one finger, Bruce was picking at a nick in the glaze on his kylix.  Natasha was the only one openly watching them, her eyes darting between them, gaze filled with speculation and maybe a bit of joy.  She smiled at them over the crimson flames, like she saw what they each wanted and was going to go through Tartaros to obtain it.
Steve coming up here and babying him drudges up a whole new set of issues that were very common to drown in liquor. Part of recovery is supposedly facing the emotional backlog that forces you to form whatever addiction you have. Sure, tendency towards addiction is hereditary, and if your family has a history, you should be extra watchful of yourself. But you can’t blame your parents for becoming an alcoholic. Maybe you can blame them for setting a poor example, or for messing you up, but the addiction is your own.
“Sthenele of Ithika.”  He held out a hand, the one that wasn’t stroking the falcon.  “And this is Redwing.”
They keep step as the DJ plays Peter Gabriel’s “In Your Eyes” as everyone watches from the sides of the dance floor.
“Jarring?”
seeing Steve Rogers, crumpled and broken.
“Mmmm,” Steve hummed as he pulled Tony deeper into his embrace, resting his chin on Tony’s shoulder.  “Rather listen to you.”
Steve finds him on the balcony, white tee and black briefs sticking to him, hair plastered to his face, limp in his deck chair, clutching his phone in one hand and the bronze token in the other, out on the balcony, out in the storm.
As far as hazing chores went, however, this wasn’t the worst.  Tony was bid to follow Natasha around the fields behind the palace, holding the pyxis for Natasha as she meticulously harvested the raw poison.  Opium production was a painstaking process that required patience, botanical knowledge, and a dab hand with a knife.  The previous afternoon, Natasha had made precise incisions into the ripe green poppy heads, careful not to breach the inner chambers containing the seeds, where the sticky white latex had dripped out.  Overnight, it had dried and hardened into a brownish resin, which Natasha was now carefully scraping off the sides of pods and depositing into the jar Tony held.  Poppies didn’t always bloom at once, so they encountered them in several different states: red and golden flowers in bud, bloom, and wilt, fleshy green pods, and those starting to yellow and dry.  Plenty of stalks had been relieved of their dried pods, put away into the storage baskets.
started, Steve would spend hours down in the workshop, reading or drawing or napping on the couch.  Tony would be in his groove, happy that he had Steve there, to ramble at, and he was so grateful, because no one can ever keep up with him, but no one but Steve was ever willing to just sit and listen to things he could never fully understand.
Dikost remarks.
Pepper hurried in while Tony was still reeling.  “Thratta will be put on the market in the morning.  But more importantly, Tony, your father wants to meet with you.”
Maria squawked as Peter roared with laughter.

“I always
The other three stared after him.  Tony looked confused, Bruce looked resigned, and Natasha had a tightly fond smile.
“Well, it’ll do,” Tony sighed, shooing the guy who carried their bags up from the room with a wad of bills.
Bruce accepted a blueberry
“Usually,” Tony nearly shouted, “I would have you beat for your impudence.”
“Just – get me to a hotel. No questions asked. I’ll make it worth your while.”
His face wrinkles, remembering. Steve doesn’t know who, but it could be any one of so many people Tony has lost. His mother. Rumiko. Happy. Even Steve for a while.
Clint picks up the peach white zinfandel and mumbles into the carton, “Maybe the dick up your ass should tell you something.”
“Of course,” Steve leaned closer.
“I.  Am.  Real.  I’m
Bruce just laughed at him.
Clint shrugged, heading into the kitchen to put the popcorn bowl away before saluting lazily and getting in the elevator.
He gives himself eye slits, with mirrored panels, so no one can see anything of an unguarded expression.
on it.  It was hilarious.  Rhodey, he’s fine.  Stop fussing.”
, for chrissakes.  And his eyes, penciled in black and drown, with a coil of gold burning off the page.
“Of course,” Pikas eagerly ushered towards the water, a reverent look on his face.  Tony stored that bit of information away, collapsing to his knees and scooping handfuls of water into his parched mouth.  After a few moments, he took his helm and dipped it in the water, bringing it up to pour over his head.  He filled it again, this time taking a long drink, savoring the coolness and the slight taste of metal the helmet added.
“What’s wrong with him?”
Peter is obviously nervous when Morgan is placed in his arms, but he’s calming down when she doesn’t fuss like he expected her to.
Natasha gives a cheeky grin and a little wave on her way out.
“Darling, I’m the lucky one. I have you and our children. I’m more than lucky.”
Natasha giggles. “Good luck. You boys aren’t getting sleep for a long time.”
(See the end of the chapter for
But it’s not just making coffee that Tony busies himself with. He makes sure all of Steve’s prenatal vitamins are in order and ready for him to take. Steve’s caffeine intake is now limited so Tony makes sure he had a steaming cup of tea waiting for him.
“I won’t physically break you, Stark. Not yet. I have other methods.”
Tony nods. “I just wanted to make sure he was okay.”
“We don’t know that,” Bruce is quick to defend. “Tony wasn’t even there.”
Steve is the first to break the awkwardness that’s surrounded them. He clears his throat and smooths a hand down the front of his shirt. “I...I don’t know what I’m supposed to say after this. Thank you just seems...wrong.”
“I don’t know,” Tony repeats. “Everything seemed fine before I had to leave and then...I don't know. He-he called and...this is my fault. I never should’ve left.”
“Why do you think? I have no idea what the hell I'm supposed to do here.”
In just a few weeks they’d be welcoming their baby boy and starting the next chapter: parenthood. It’s a terrifying thought, him as a father, but it’s been Steve’s assurance that made him consider that maybe he wouldn’t be so bad. He could love their son-that would never be an issue. He’d try not to spoil Peter so much with material items. Tony had vivid memories of having whatever he wanted whenever he wanted. But deep down he just wanted his father to love him.
But like the nursery rhyme goes: first comes love, then comes marriage. Only, Tony didn’t want a baby carriage to follow. He was content with how things were. A baby would throw everything off.
“No,” Steve shakes his head and he directs his gaze on the screen. He gasps softly when the image of his baby appears on the screen. It wasn’t just a gray blob anymore, he can make out a tiny head and body. Steve props himself up on his elbows to get a better look. “Is that-that’s my-”
Tony pulls Steve back into his arms and kisses the top of his head. “Okay.”
“What happened?” Tony asks as soon as he can get Steve alone. After the rest of the presents, Tony decided it was time for cake and had Steve join him in the kitchen to bring it out.
“You’re not. I love having you here. I love smelling your cooking-”
The rest of the team join them to eat the cake and reminisce. Sam disappears for a moment before coming back and handing Peter a small boxed wrapped in blue paper.
“It’s fine.” Steve offers a reassuring smile. “Vent to me whenever you want. I’m here to listen.”
“Remember how I said we might be getting close?” Tony asks and Steve nods his head. “Yeah...I think this is it.”
“Okay, okay,” Steve knows better than to keep his little one waiting. Peter usually didn’t throw tantrums and scream, but he was still two-years-old and it wasn’t called the terrible twos for nothing.
“What about what he did to Steve?” Bucky adds. “To all of us? We were supposed to be a team and he left.”
“But I love him anyway.”
“You don’t have to do that,” Tony says and abandons the photos to join his son at the sofas. “I’ve been through worse.”
Steve flushes. He wants to be rough in other ways.
The room he finds himself in is bare, devoid of any windows, and a single door is bolted tight into the wall opposite of him. The room is illuminated by swinging bulbs above him. They twitch every few seconds.
“We’ll figure it out,” Steve decides. He glances down at where they’re standing and then back up, surveying the land that could be theirs. “So a kitchen, huh?”
“I guess even supersoldiers can get tired, huh?”
“Yeah. Two babies.”
“You two get some sleep,” Natasha says and drags her friends toward the door.
Peter shakes his head.
The small whimpers his son makes is enough to force Steve’s fears aside, and let his instincts take over. He comforts his son, holding him close and softly shushing him until he’s calming down.
The alpha scoffs. “Mother? What kind of mother risks the life of their pup? You were willing to harm her the minute you decided to escape these walls. You’re not a mother. You don’t deserve her.”
Sam takes Bucky’s hand back in his own. “I’m not going anywhere. And even when I do die I’m haunting your ass.”
It was probably for the best. Steve and Barnes were a match made in Heaven. Of course Steve would choose his best friend instead of the asshole that fucked him and blew him off right afterwards. Steve didn’t deserve someone like that. He deserved so much more.
“He’s gonna wake up and I’m blaming you...again.” Tony shifts, grunting softly from the throb in his lower back. He shoves Steve’s hand away and adjusts the large pregnancy pillow he’s been sleeping with for the past few months. Steve huffs out a small laugh and shakes his head. “What?” Tony questions. “You know I need this to sleep.”
Tony’s still frowning. “But why? You couldn’t-“he stops himself quickly, knowing if he were to continue he’d start a fight. “Are you sure?”
“Not really. I just want to be ahead. Show these labor pains who’s in charge.”
“Look at me, Tony!” Steve’s voice raises slightly and he steps back to give Tony a better view of his flaws. “I’m so...disgusting.”
One more person needed to know. Steve just wasn’t sure if he could do it.
He honestly didn’t know what he was supposed to say at this point. He wonders if Steve would be angry that such a test was even done, or maybe it would be the deceit that ended up starting a fight. Tony didn’t want any of that, not when they’d come this far already, but Tony would understand if it did. It was his fault.
He’s tempted to call Tony back to properly explain the situation, but he doesn’t. If Tony could easily walk away from the team, from him, then there was no denying that he’d do it a second time and walk away from their baby.
Steve huffs in annoyance when he still doesn’t get a response from his husband. “Jarvis, where is he?”
“Are you saying I was drugged? Who drugged me?”
Steve groans and squeezes his eyes shut. “T-Tony, you need to breathe. Just breathe okay?”
Tony’s heart sinks. He didn’t say they were okay.
The baby whimpers again, capturing his parent’s attention. Steve stares down at him, adjusting the towel when he finds it slid off while he was passing the afterbirth. The whimpers die down and the baby slowly opens his eyes, revealing them for the first time since he was born.
Tony’s smile brightens. He moves his hands to Steve’s hips. “Good. This is how it’s supposed to feel. Mating is supposed to feel like this. Try moving, sweetheart.”
He hates to think about it, but he’d love to go back in the ice right about now.
“We are. I promise you.”
“Come on,” Happy gestures for Peter to follow, and he leads him to the elevators.
“Kid, I’m telling you he wasn’t there. I wouldn’t have blown up-”
Peter glances around at his family, noticing that still one important person was missing. He hates that he begins to fear the worst. His dad wouldn’t bail on him. He had been there for the ceremony, and there was no reason why he wouldn’t show up now.
Steve grins and comes closer, taking the bear into his hand. “He is adorable.”
“I assume your lack of a response is an acceptance.”
“The world’s not that bad. Well, some things anyway. You just have to go out and see for yourself,” Tony says.
“Yeah.” Bruce sighs and rubs at his forehead. He looks even more tired than the last time Tony had seen him. The traveling back and forth was clearly taking a toll on his friend. Tony can’t help but feel guilty. “Tony,” he says and removes his glasses. “He’s having false contractions.”
It’s at this moment when Tony remembers the folder he’s kept tucked away and out of Steve’s reach. The results of the test is just a painful reminder that he had done something behind Steve’s back and made it worse by continuing to hide it. He should’ve come clean about the test when he first asked Bruce to perform it, and again when the results arrived.
“Tony.”
“As I was saying, he refused my service and prepared his own lunch. Something you don’t understand how to do.”
Their eyes meet from across the room and Tony raises his glass. Steve smiles softly and turns away. Tony sighs and brings the glass up to his lips, chugging down the remainder of his Dirty Martini.
“Shit. Seriously?”
“No, it’s not. You did nothing wrong.” Tony knows his attempt at reassurance wasn’t going to be enough, but he didn’t know what he was supposed to do or what he was supposed to say.
A sob rips through his throat and he quickly cups his mouth to keep himself from disturbing his sleeping son. But he can’t keep the tears that flow freely down his face. His body shakes with each sob and he grips the countertop to steady himself. He hangs his head between his shoulders and cries.
“It’s going to be okay. We’ll get through this,” Tony promises and holds Steve close. He leans down to kiss the top of his head.
“Nice enough.”
“Yes! I thought I’d have to wait for Uncle Bucky-”
“Yeah.” Steve breaks their contact first and begins reading through the instructions, his brows furrowing slightly when he rereads the steps. “It wasn’t like this during my time.”
“He’s not there,” Natasha corrects as she sits back against the sofa and crosses her left leg over her right. “He was in the training room last I saw him.”
Steve smiles and gets a washcloth, then he’s running it under warm water and gently scrubbing it over his son’s face.
“What? No! No it wasn’t him.”
Steve pushes harder, determined to bring his pup into the world.
The sun is shining, its rays bright and warm against his skin. Birds are chirping in the trees; their tune is a little too happy for his taste. The grass is a vibrant green and there’s an array of planted flowers nearby, each bright and alluring to the eye.
“Not relationships. This is why it’s hard for me to...get close to someone. Especially someone like Steve.”
Steve shuts his eyes tight to hold back the tears. He had failed again.
“No!” Peter shakes his head and pulls away. “Don’t go. Please don’t.”
“Me? What did I do?”
“Steve, you don’t look so good.”
“But that’s over now. You’re free and he’s-”
“I just want him back.”
“Yeah that helps.”
It was a mess. A mess Steve had wanted to avoid. When he left Alpha and Hydra behind, he didn’t anticipate running into the alpha that sired his pup. His main goal was to get as far away from his enemies as he can. Bumping into Tony was an accident.
Steve chuckles and steps into the room, knowing better than to piss off his pregnant husband. Steve’s hands find their way to Tony’s jeans and it’s not long before he too is growing frustrated.
“I’m sorry, darling,” Tony whispers.
Steve chuckles lightly. He gently pulls on the tie until Tony is close enough for him to connect their lips. Tony was expecting a quick kiss goodbye, but instead Steve is kissing him passionately.
Steve should be grateful, and a part of him is, but the other half of him can’t help but wish that something was wrong. It would be painful to lose another pup, but at least it wouldn’t have the chance of being born and brought up under Hydra’s care. It would be spared.
“No! No! We cuddled but nothing else-”
“I know. I just...it’s weird that he, Alpha-”
This chapter is a lot fluffier so yay for that! I hope you all enjoy it 😊
“Hang on. I don’t want to be near you-I mean not like that but I can’t-” Tony sighs. “I don’t want to hurt you. Not again.”
Steve rolls his eyes playfully and leans in close to peck Tony on the cheek. Their moment is cut short when a loud
“He’s not the whole reason, right?”
“Tony,” he starts and Tony glances up at him. It’s easy to get lost in his dark eyes. Steve’s lost count of how many times he enjoyed just staring into them. They brought him comfort. They made him feel home.
Steve stares down at his son in awe, completely mesmerized by his presence.
Steve had made a vow to never try for a baby again. He told himself he didn’t need one to be happy. He didn’t need that simple life he used to envision.
He directs his gaze back toward the room, wishing that he could be there with his mate. Steve is doing well on his own comforting the scared pups. He was a natural, something Tony’s told him over and over again.
Bucky does, showing off his glistening eyes.
“And I did want this party to work. I just wanted everyone to be together again. The last time we gathered like this was for the…”
“Don’t be. I’ll keep you both safe.”
“I don’t think he really knows me,” Tony says. He tries to say it in a joking manner, but it’s obvious from the look Steve is giving him that he failed. “I wasn’t exactly around, Cap.”
“Yeah?”
The awkwardness that lingers is uncomfortable. Tony’s sure if he were to leave it would disappear, but he can’t bring himself to follow through. Steve needed him now more than ever and he promised they were going to remain friends. A good friend would stay and help. And that’s what he was going to do.
Tony quiets down after that and decides to leave for work early. The last thing he wanted to do was upset his son even more.
Peter can only nod his head.
“I won’t say anything if that’s what you’re worried about,” Nick eventually says.
The restraints around his wrists are removed and he is pushed back onto the exam table. He doesn’t struggle when the two alpha’s stand on each side of him and strap him down. He’s been through this before.
Ugh Tony! I love Tony Stark, but in this story...he's a jerk. I'm not saying Steve is innocent either but...yeah. I love these two...even when they do stupid stupid things.
Rumlow is pushed to the ground, Steve pinning him down and punching him repeatedly in the face, decorating the skin with dark bruises and blood. Steve places both hands over the alpha’s head, digging his nails deep into the sides, emitting a painful scream from the alpha.
Tony rises to his feet and closes down the lab, making sure to instruct JARVIS to activate the alarm around the penthouse. He knows no one in their right mind would try to break in, but he’s being cautious now, more so than he’s ever been. He has a pup and omega to take care of.
“How’s he doing by the way? He doesn’t talk about Steve’s-forget it. Sorry.”
“I miss him so much,” Peter continues to sob. His uncle keeps him in his arms, doing his best to comfort him.
Peter takes a moment to get himself under control before taking the elevator to his uncles’ floor. He promises himself not to tell them what he’s learned and just keep the details as minimal as he possibly can.
“He just…” Tony sighs again, one hand coming up to run through his hair. “I don’t know. So far he’s been himself, and to tell you the truth, I never thought I’d see him like this again. I don’t want to mess it up.”
Their mating was a blur. It leaves Tony having to piece together everything himself based on the information he did have. He must have met Steve at the party. How else could he have remembered his eyes? The rest leaves him puzzled. Did they sneak away? Was it Steve who tricked him into leaving? Was Steve the bait and Tony fell for it? He has no answers for any of those questions.
It’s those thoughts that keep him distracted. His email is open and there are a few that need to be replied to urgently, but he can’t bring himself to type out replies. He’s tempted to have Pepper do it, but she was already doing so much. The least he could do was carry some of the weight. It was his company after all.
“Nope. I promised. But to be honest that was my first plan until you shot it down. No, there is nothing waiting for you downstairs. This is Pete’s day, baby shower stuff only.”
“You do.” The warm smile is back on the doctor’s face. “It’s okay to feel like this. It’s completely normal.”
I love Dodger! He’s so sweet 🥰 I enjoyed writing this and all the cuteness. I love my angst but fluff is always needed. I hope you guys liked it! ❤️
He’s forced to watch helplessly as Alpha takes another pup away.
“Ten?” Natasha teases and Bucky grumbles, “shut up.”
“You were scared, bubba,” Steve reminds his son.
“You’re doing great,” Steve assures and sits down beside his mate, leaning close to kiss him softly on the cheek. Noticing their interaction, James grows brave and leans in too, sniffing the other alpha.
“Please? Alpha, I need you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“No.”
“T-Tony!”
Before Pepper can speak, Tony cuts her off and says, “I’m sorry for whatever it is I missed.”
Keeping his composure was a struggle. Every day he found himself losing his grip on himself. Pretty soon he was going to bend until he couldn’t anymore, and he’d break in a million little pieces.
Tony crawls off the bed to grab the other pair of handcuffs and attach one end around Steve’s wrist and the other to the bed frame. Just like the other one, Steve tests it out and is just as pleased as Tony to find it strong enough to keep him in place.
Peter’s new behavior was odd and only getting worse. For two weeks now Peter was hiding in his room or lying behind his teeth. Steve had tried to get his son to talk, but obviously he was going to need either reinforcements or a new tactic.
“Yeah.” Steve can’t help but frown at the items neatly lined along the shelves. He has to remind himself that the world he lived in now was different. He grew up with very little and his mother had to stretch every penny just for them to get by. Now he was able to provide for his son without having to worry. It’s overwhelming, but at the same time he has the sudden urge to fill the shopping cart with as many items as it can carry.
“As I was saying,” Jarvis continues, his tone laced with annoyance. Tony rolls his eyes but allows him to continue. “Once mated your bond will be stronger, of course that would be true if you two were to properly bond. He’d have your mark and you’d have his.”
“I’m terrified. Mother’s can be scared, too. My ma never showed it, but there were times when I caught her caving in. I’ve done this before but each time I’m terrified of the outcome. I always wonder if I’ll lose another pup.”
A part of Steve wishes they had worked. Their team wouldn’t be missing its member right now, and the baby growing inside of him wouldn’t be a secret he was going to have to keep. Maybe he and Tony could find a way to come together to raise their child.
“I can’t. I can’t.”
I swear I’m taking it easy and I’m starting to feel better. I managed to get enough chapters written for this story so I’m ahead, but I’ll try and work on my other stuff too. I’m just having so much fun with this one 😛
So here he was, wandering around the room full of alphas, betas and a few omegas; people he didn’t really recognize. He thought he had seen a few familiar faces. After doing so many of these with the same type of rich people, he started to recognize a few.
“So I slept with this person?”
“I hurt you. I forced myself on you-”
“And what about you? You’re going on a dangerous mission while I’m carrying said baby.”
Steve shakes his head again, then he sniffs. He’s crying; it’s heartbreaking to see. Tony thought these days were behind both of them. Steve was supposed to be happy now, at peace on his road to recovery. But perhaps it wasn’t as cleanly paved as Tony thought it would be. The road was going to have some bumps along the way.
“Oh yeah. Riley would be so jealous of me right now. He wanted to do this.” Sam gestures to the room. The smile he wears is sad.
Peter smiles at the pictures covering the page. He’s seen them all, but it’s been so long since he’s gone through the album.
“I’m still mad at you by the way,” Tony says and he adds more soap to the cloth. He runs it over Steve’s chest, following the trail of bruises until he’s washing along his stomach.
Oh man I’m not gonna lie but this chapter is kinda sad. This whole story had been difficult but I swear they’re getting a happy ending!
“I still am.”
Tony sighs and pulls away. “That’s just it. Peter is the reason why we got closer. What if down the road...something shifts and we’re back to the way things used to be?”
Tony smiles down at him and continues to stroke his face until he’s sure Peter is peacefully sleeping. He leans down to give him a kiss, then he goes back to join Steve.
“Wow,” Flash shakes his head at the Star Wars posters. “You are a dork.”
“My science project,” Morgan pipes up.
Tony nods in response and shifts, curling up even closer against Steve’s side. “Yeah. You?”
“I think you need to go home and sit down with him. He’s holding things in, too. Go talk to him. And really listen. Because he’s in pain and sometimes, all he probably wants is for you to just listen.”
His face heats up being this exposed to her, but she doesn’t even bat an eye. She was just another omega helping another. A friend helping a friend.
Steve gives himself a few moments before searching for his alpha. The pup was already awake, rolling around and stretching his tiny limbs. Steve smiles down at his belly, eyes transfixed on the movement his son produced.
Tony moves closer, crawling onto the bed until he’s lying beside Steve. He turns his head, their eyes meeting.
“Right. Got it.”
“Who is he?” Happy asks, his hands are still clenched and he’s eyeing the two beta men closely.
He decided to track Bruce down, finding him in his lab. Being around a familiar environment was the perfect space to clear his mind and think. It also helped that he had a friend.
“Steve,” Nat tries to grab the omega’s attention. “Steve, what pups?”
“He’s referring to...that last mission,” Sam informs.
“Steve-”
“No.” Steve shakes his head. “I can’t...I’m not.”
Finding the omega is easy. Steve can usually be found upstairs in his room or down in the kitchen. Tony’s unsure if Steve has bothered trying to learn the rest of the mansion. Tony never did give him a proper tour. Maybe it was time he did.
Maybe they would have talked and Tony for once, would have listened. He’d give anything to go back and change everything. Maybe then, the scene playing out in front of him would have never happened.
The blaring of an alarm is what jolts Tony awake. His eyes shoot open, immediately landing on the ceiling above him. With a groan he rolls over and buries his head under the pillow, trying to drown out the sound responsible for disturbing his sleep. He pokes his head out, expecting to find his mate nestled beside him, only to be met with nothing.
“Oh. Congratulations. Again, I’m sorry I couldn’t be of more help. I have a meeting in five minutes so…”
Sam can’t help but glance at the spot where his friend used to sit, silently asking for his guidance. He wonders what Steve would do in their current situation. Steve would probably call a meeting the same way Sam has, willing to listen to everyone’s opinions and work on a solution. Sam wasn’t Steve, and he never will be, but he was going to be a good leader. Just like Steve knew he could be.
Much to Peter’s relief, his parents aren’t home when he arrives at the tower. He can’t help but feel that this would have been the perfect opportunity for him and Flash to properly talk without being interrupted or pummeled by concerned parents. But Flash had decided that he didn’t want to talk. Maybe eventually they could sit down and be mature about their current predicament, but as for right now, Peter was left alone to figure out how to handle the situation.
Tony scoffs. “I wasn’t that late. But yeah, I guess the party doesn’t start till I arrive, huh?”
Steve grumbles some kind of morning greeting and shuffles into the kitchen. Tony side eyes him, watching as he takes the vitamins and then the tea. He comes over and Tony snaps his attention back to his tablet, pretending that his focus was on his work the whole time.
Steve chuckles. “I know. It's crazy.”
“I should probably go.”
His eyes are shut for not even a minute before he’s being disturbed by his phone ringing. Peter groans and rolls over onto his back, his hand reaching into the pocket of his hoodie to retrieve the device. The first person he expects to be calling is his papa, but when it’s not him or his dad, and instead Happy’s name and picture shows up on the screen, Peter is almost hesitant to answer.
“No it’s okay. You stay and do what you want. I’ll just be…” Tony trails off and glances toward the direction of the car. Peter doesn’t protest and he stays behind while Tony heads back to the car.
“I don’t want to fight.”
Tony growls and yanks at his chains. He goes ignored.
It’s getting late and Tony wants to use the excuse that they go to bed and sleep on it, but it’s clear that Steve is determined to end this here and now. He’s not backing down. Tony wonders where this attitude was before. Maybe then they wouldn’t need to have a difficult discussion.
When Morgan grows fussy, Tony panics, terrified of Steve reverting back and spiraling out of control. But then Steve surprises him by calming Morgan down, talking softly to her and even humming a song Tony remembers Steve doing when Morgan was still in his belly. Tony doesn’t interrupt their moment, deciding to linger in the doorway of the nursery and give them their time to reconnect and make up for lost time.
“Wait, kid!” Tony calls out and runs over. He pants for a minute to catch his breath. “I’m sorry. What happened back there-”
“N-no. I can’t.”
“Us too.”
“Holy shit,” he gasps in surprise and Steve peers up at him, worry and fear flooding his eyes. Tony’s seen this same look before, 17 years ago. “You’re pregnant?”
“Come here.” Tony holds out a hand and Steve takes it. Tony pulls him forward and down for another kiss. “I love you so much,” he whispers against Steve’s lips.
She hugs him and Steve allows the touch. It doesn’t compare to the ones Tony likes to give, but it helps calm him down all the same.
“It’s adorable. You know it is.”
“Fuck. Touch me,” Tony begs, bucking his hips up to rub them against Steve’s growing bulge. Steve groans in response, his clock reacting to the friction. Tony cries out when Steve grants his wish and touches him. It’s not enough. He needs more. “Come on, Cap. Touch me.”
“Pregnant, Ned!” Peter loses his patience and Ned flinches at the outburst.
But God did he wish he could hide away again and pretend that his life wasn’t the shit show that it was.
Thank you guys so much for the wonderful responses on this story! I'm glad you all are liking it so far! I know it's dark and poor Steve is going through a lot, but it will get better for him. For now...
“Get up!”
“I’ll be okay. I’m a little nervous about Happy but-”
The only thing missing is the person on everyone’s mind. Peter wishes just once he’d catch a glance of his father in the kitchen with his uncles. They were always spending time together.
“You’ll never have to.”
Sam rolls his eyes. “Fine. But if he is then it’s not a big deal. This one-” Sam jabs a thumb in Peter’s direction. “- has the serum and he came out just fine.”
Peter is fed and put to sleep in his bassinet. Steve insisted Peter stay in their bedroom with them. Tony doesn’t argue. The other pups would have to sleep in one of the guest rooms until Tony can transform it into a space fit for kids. Steve is hesitant to leave them alone in such a large room. He fears it could trigger them and make them uncomfortable.
“What else did he tell you?” Steve asks.
“Shit!” Steve cries out and his hands slap down on the counter. His eyes squeeze shut and his legs wobble, threatening to give out. He breathes steadily through the pain, small groans escaping him when the contraction peaks.
“Good. Now go before you’re late.”
Jarvis sighs sadly. It must not be good.
“You hurt me, Tony! You almost hurt the baby!” Steve yells.
At the sound of his name, Peter blinks rapidly, snapping out of his trance and turning away from the poster, settling his gaze on his father.
“By who? Where are we?” Tony’s unable to get a proper look at the room he woke up in. He tries to sit up again, only to give up when the gunshot wound in his back throbs.
Tony snorts. “Yeah, that’s convincing. Let me ask you this, do they know we’ve been meeting up?”
“God, you’re so beautiful.”
“You need to relax,” Steve mumbles, and Tony glances up, finding his eyes still closed.
“For starters he’s insanely hot. Tall, blond, and handsome.”
Thank you all so much for taking the time to read, comment, and leave kudos. It means so much to me and never fails to put a smile on my face. You guys are amazing! ❤️❤️❤️
Tony grumbles. That explained the alarm he didn’t remember setting.
Tony frowns at Pepper’s words. He should’ve known those were going to be the first thing she says to him when he walked into the office that morning. He probably did look awful. A lack of sleep does that to a person.
They eventually arrive and Tony pulls the car up front and kills the ignition. An uneasy look is shared between them, then Peter is climbing out first and rushing toward the entrance. Tony takes a second to compose himself before following after his son.
The grin on Steve’s face is gone in an instant, a frown taking its place. “Fleabag? Tony, he has a name. And I know you won’t sleep on the couch.”
When Peter starts walking, Dodger becomes Peter’s support. And when Peter starts talking, Dodger’s name pops up in most of his conversations.
“Hey.” Peter notices her when she runs into the living room. He has Harley calm and watching cartoons, giving him an opportunity to take her hand and stop her from going up the stairs. “Morgan, what’s wrong?”
“I want him back. Please!”
Well, in the beginning he did.
The images of Steve’s face is all he can see. But his mind is a lot crueler than he thought. He’s forced to relive the moment he knew he loved Steve, the night after they slept together, the way he left and never came back, their last night together. He’d give anything to go back and fix his mistakes. Maybe Steve would still be alive if he had stopped caring about himself.
And it was all his fault.
“I won’t hurt you,” her voice is soft and calm, nothing like the other alphas. “Clint,” she turns back to her partner. “Call it in. We found them.”
He was given a chance to have a mate, pups, and the simple life he had envisioned for himself. It took time for him to overcome his traumas and the past that haunted him occasionally, but with the help of his mate and new best friend, Steve was himself again and living the life he desired.
Before Tony can make a decision, he hears the sound of a car coming down the road. He’s not the only one who’s noticed and a chorus of ‘mama!’ rings out. James and Harley run towards the car, followed by the two younger pups.
“Okay,” Tony takes a moment to ask his next question. “Favorite movie?”
His aunt rushes toward him, brushing his tears away. “Sweetie, no. You’re not making this difficult for anyone. It’s...it’s hard, yes, but not because of you. This isn’t your fault.”
“Buck, it’s fine. The sink-”
“Can he come over? I didn’t get a chance to show him around.”
Tony smiles and leans forward, his forehead resting against Steve’s. He trails his hands up and down Steve’s arms, rubbing them softly.
Tony rolls his eyes. Of course Steve’s reaction to the dog on their bed would differ from his own. It wasn’t surprising, but it was annoying.
They’re both dressed and drinking their morning coffee. His dad is talking about an issue in the R&D department; Peter doesn’t miss how irritated he sounds. It makes him nervous.
Steve immediately does as he’s told and quiets down his pup, not wanting to risk any harm coming to him. He’d make sure he receives any punishment before his son does.
I was able to get the next chapter written and now I’m posting before work. Hopefully there’s no errors and if there are I’m sorry! Anyway, I hope you all enjoy this and that you all are doing well 😊
“Then you better treat him like it. If I find out that you hurt him just like you hurt Steve…” Bucky makes a fist with his metal hand, the vibranium whirring.
Tony frowns and gives Steve a thumbs down. “I’m all for the sex but I screwed up and I want to do something you’ll enjoy.”
The date goes better than Steve thought it would. He didn’t let his insecurities get in the way and they were able to enjoy the evening. Being alone with Tony again was something Steve never imagined. They were supposed to have broken up and moved on with their lives, but they had already proved time and time again that they could never be apart. That love between them never died.
The elevator arrives at its destination and the doors open. Tony frowns when he realizes they’re still in the compound and not making their way to his car.
If Steve is bothered by it he doesn’t voice his complaints. He stays quiet as he reads through the menu. Tony orders a bottle of wine for them, shooting his husband a smile of reassurance when Steve eyes the bottle warily.
Steve chuckles. “Well, there’s going to be a lot of those. And late night feedings…”
Steve pushes it aside the best he can and moves forward, using his son for motivation.
Happy shakes his head, but a hint of a grin still appears over his face. “Glad to have you back, Tony.”
They’re forced to pull away when the door to Tony’s private room opens and they both glance up at the person lingering in the doorway. Tony recognizes her immediately.
Peter shakes his head. “I want the other suit you wear. Please, Daddy? I think you are the coolest guy in the whole wide world!” Peter exclaims, widening his arms to show Tony just how cool he thinks he really is.
“I’m scared,” the omega admits quietly.
“I don’t know why.”
Steve smiles and nods, then he leaves the large office.
“Wait.” Steve gently pushes against Tony’s chest until he pulls away. “Do you have...stuff?”
“It’s fine. Now I’m comfortable.”
Peter huffs. “No!”
Tony rises to his feet. Before he can even leave the room, Steve is calling out to him and he turns back around.
Peter pulls away and quickly wipes away his tears, wishing for once he could get it together and stop crying. He needed to be strong. Just like his papa taught him.
“Yeah. Everyone’s super cool with it. Maybe you can come over for dinner. Uncle Sam makes the best food.”
Time seems to be passing agonizingly slow. Tony can’t take sitting down anymore and he moves to pacing, his eyes flickering in the direction of the door every few minutes.
His begging goes ignored and Steve tries to focus on his mate, but it’s painful to see him in so much pain. It was Steve’s fault. He got them into this mess.
Not a word has been spoken since they boarded the jet and took off. They’ve been in the air for only thirty minutes but yet it’s felt like longer. Steve had stopped asking questions once he realized Tony didn’t have any answers to give.
“God you’re so sexy.”
“You’re not him?”
“Sam or Peter? Both are a little messed up right now.”
“And Sarah is a daddy’s girl.”
Tony smiles. “We never could. But maybe we can give it another shot. Talking. We gotta talk and work this out, Steve.”
Peter smiles brighter and coos while he kicks out his legs.
“You wouldn’t understand, Mr. Stark. The things I’ve been through…”
“But my room-”
And I couldn't resist Nat and Steve interactions along with Stucky ones. I love both of those friendships.
Steve nods and takes another breath. His eyes wander around the space, a small smile tugging on his lips. “This is where it started.”
Steve is awake and he glances up, sending Tony a tired smile. “Hey,” he greets, his voice thick with sleep.
He doesn’t take the knife like he originally considered. The little orange bottle beside the coffee pot is what captures his attention. Tony had said they weren’t working, and maybe they weren’t doing their job at easing his depression, but Steve was sure if he took just the right amount, that they would help in other ways.
“You’re not his alpha.”
Tony makes sure Bruce is comfortable in one of the extra bedrooms before finally returning back to his little family. He pokes his head into the room, smiling at the sight of his mate and son. Steve has never looked so vibrant, so beautiful.
Flash takes this moment to reach for his water again, wondering if there was someway he could drown himself in it.
“Tony?” Steve whimpers, looking up at him again. Their eyes lock, and Tony gives him an encouraging smile.
“Come on,” Tony urges, growing excited when that whimper escalates in volume. The loud wail the baby produces is relieving and Tony can no longer keep his tears from falling.
“Sweetheart, no. How could I be mad? You had no control. That wasn’t your fault.”
“Didn’t we, though? You heard what Bucky said. We saw how different Steve was and we didn’t do anything, or at least not enough. I could’ve done more and instead he’s...well, you know how he is. I swear if I lose him…”
There was still a piece missing from the puzzle Steve was trying to assemble. Going out and facing the world was still something he hadn’t had the courage to do yet. He was from a different time and didn’t know where he fit into this new world. He was robbed from his old life.
The pain is at its worst and only getting more intense. His body aches from the position he has it in, his heart is beating so hard it feels like it’s going to burst from his chest. All he wants to do is quit. But he knows he can’t.
“Sir,” Jarvis interrupts and Tony has to fight the urge to scowl. “Ms.Potts is on line.”
Peter shakes his head. “You didn’t help him at all. Play the voicemail.”
“Now get out of here. I’m sure Nat’s waiting for you,” Bucky smiles and ruffles Peter’s hair.
“Hey,” Bruce says, raising one hand to calm his friend. “I’m not saying you’re the bad guy, Tony. I know you’re trying and changing. I bet everyone else notices too. But it’s Peter who matters more than us.”
“It’s fine. It’s nothing.”
“Honey, you can do this. You’re so strong.”
“Papa?” Peter’s quiet voice reaches his ears. “Papa, are you okay?”
“Alright. Let’s talk business.” Tony scoots forward in his seat, only to slump back when his head throbs and his vision blurs.
Tony smiles. “She gets it from you.”
Steve fights again when his sweatpants are tugged down his legs. Another punch to the face has him crying out and falling still. He sucks in a harsh breath when he’s touched. He thought he’d never have to experience this again.
“Do you want to play video games?” Ned asks. “It could help take your mind off of it.”
“Yeah, you might’ve mentioned that.”
The first few times aren’t so bad, but then it keeps happening. Steve feels like he’s in some kind of time loop. Just when he thinks he’ll get some sleep, Peter is waking him up and the cycle starts all over again.
“A breast pump?” Steve reads the words on the box, his brows drawing together in confusion.
“Yes!” Peter cheers.
“Are you okay?” Steve asks.
The omega nods.
“Tony, he just wants you to pet him.” Steve chuckles again.
Tony lets out a sigh. He knew the drastic changes to Steve’s body was an adjustment, and maybe he’d understand more if he had been in Steve’s shoes. In his eyes Steve still looked beautiful, probably the most beautiful he’s ever been. But Steve didn’t see it.
“Yeah.” Steve nods. He still appears hesitant to leave their daughter. Tony takes his hand, giving it a gentle squeeze to reassure him.
He makes another attempt to get a hold of his husband, only to be met with the same result. The next contraction is already building. One glance at the time shows that it hasn’t even been ten minutes since the last one.
“Can we not talk about that? I’m sorry, dad, but I can’t.”
Steve frowns and with a harsh sigh says, “You blew up a tree!”
“On the jet. Honey, I’m so sorry. I didn’t know she’d be-.”
“What the hell are you doing here?” Bucky snarls. The blue in his eyes are almost black now, dark with rage. A rage meant for Tony.
Steve lets out a small groan when the next contraction comes and he throws his head back against the stiff pillows on the bed. He suddenly wishes he had brought one from home; the ones SHIELD provided weren’t comfortable enough.
Peter opens the bedroom door and pokes his head out, ears perked for any other sounds than the ones he was currently making. When it becomes evident that he was the only one awake, Peter steps out of the room to investigate the penthouse.
Bruce begins looking over Steve. He checks his eyes, ears, throat; everything he had done with the pups. He takes extra time studying the faint bruises and cuts along Steve’s face. He doesn’t ask about them, which Steve is grateful for. No one knew the horrors that went on. Steve wasn’t ready to tell them yet.
“I like Benjamin,” Steve says, making sure his voice shows no hint of his irritation. “I just think we need a middle name for him. Can we do that?”
“I don’t...I don’t know anything about you.”
Those words do little to offer assurance. He wasn’t fine. He was in labor and his husband was in another country. Nothing about his situation was fine.
Happy nods and turns away. He He rises to his feet to gather his empty plate, then he gestures to Steve’s. “You want more?”
That makes Steve cry even harder. “I want to! I want to do this!”
“Sorry,” Tony is quick to apologize. “We were just-”
“I might have something. Come on, Pete.” Sam rises to his feet. “Let’s get you to bed. It’s been a long day.”
“It’s not fair,” Steve sobs into Tony’s chest. “I-I wanted that baby.”
Hydra. Tony’s sure he’s heard that name before. It sounded so familiar to him, and yet he couldn’t remember where he heard it. He tries to think back on that night with Pierce, but his memory was still failing him.
“Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?”
“Nah, nah, nah.  I remember.  You do everything for yourself.  How’s that workin’ out for you?”
“I’m counting on it.  But realize I am not new to this game.”  Natasha strolled over, flicked Clint’s bicep, and poured the contents of her basket into one of the three larger ones by Clint’s feet.  Poppy heads.
Tony unconsciously tensed.  “Why?”
“Oh, come on Capsicle.  Traditional guy like you must have a dozen kids.”
“Do not touch me again.”
Rogers –
His mouth felt like cotton.  “Steve . . . Steve doesn’t
“Carry me,” he whined.
For a moment, Tony stood still, filled his lungs with air, then took off after him.
Steve gently stroked Tony’s hair, and he let out a purr of contentment before slipping into unconsciousness.
that he had to head to a meeting right after the consultation, and couldn’t go to lunch with them afterwards.  It didn’t matter that Tony
Steve clapped him on the shoulder.  “It’s the milk.  Builds up your stamina.”
“Tony.  Tell me.”
“Twelve percent?  Of my baby?”
“Tell you what,” he said dully, still trying to process the whole “not true” thing.
This doesn’t mean anything.
“Why would I go on your run with you?”
“If you’d taken a horse, you wouldn’t have needed to walk.  You win?”  Tony pointed at the bag.  “Good.  Pepper’s pissed that you decided you needed to defend her honor, but she’s secretly appreciative.  Go tell the king the prince has arrived,” Rhodey ordered, and one of the slaves dropped his basket in eagerness to comply.  Rhodey dropped his voice.  “You okay, Tones?”
It’s low, he knows, but for some reason, he’s exhausted. Exhausted by their entire relationship.  He doesn’t know why it’s hitting him now, but he’s sick of it.  As much as he’s always admired Steve, how much he loves working with him, the pressure of it begins to grate after a while.

“Tony?” Steve called. “You coming?”
“Not today.”  Steve buries his nose in Tony’s hair.  “But I need to get a geology text to read up on pyrite.”
," he gripes, pacing along the edge of the cliff, back and forth, back and forth.
An hour later when Pepper arrived, Tony had calmed down sufficiently for him to assess his cognitive function, which he aced.  He would be fine, he just needed another day or two for observation.
, was something
“We don’t have to let this affect anything?”  Because he can’t lose Steve, he’s lost so much and he can’t lose this as well.
So he sits a good two feet away, cold no matter the temperature because he knows what proper warmth feels like, and keeps his hands and heart to himself.
“Tony?” Steve’s gentle knock, rather than Pepper’s sharp raps or Happy’s open-palmed slam, rattled the locked door. “Can I come in?”
JARVIS and his wonderful timing.
He found himself obsessed with trying to salvage his
“Never a problem, Tony.  Get some sleep.  Call if you need anything.”
But what
Steve chews on his cheek, waiting. He wants to snap at Tony to get on with it, but he’s had enough of yelling at computers over the years.
The last word was lost in a wave of static.
It was nice.  Peaceful.
Steve gently peeled the tape back and opened the box.  It was a medallion, much like the one Steve had inherited from his father and had later given to Tony.  An equal armed cross, with St. Florian in the middle, calling for his protection of firefighters.  It was different from the one Tony wore, which was hammered and textured gold on a Figaro chain.  Steve’s new one was white gold and colorful enamel, on a smooth curb chain.  “It’s perfect.”
didn’t whine, crawling into Steve’s lap.  “It’s taking place in some museum.  The exhibits will be closed to the public, but open to families of any reps going.”
“Did I take the edge off?” Steve asked innocently, still sucking on a finger.
“Lila.”  Steve was glaring intently at the fitted sheet, thick brows wrinkled.  Tony was suddenly vividly remembered of their arrival, how Steve had stared at the Mini Batons in something close to disbelief.  He’d been so angry after, and of course Tony thought he was mad at him.  But thinking back on it, there was some sort of desperate loneliness in Steve’s eyes as he observed the Family Barton.  He had spent the afternoon staring at them moodily, and lashing out whenever anyone had approached him.  But when Tony brought Fury up to the house, Steve had been sitting on the floor, up to his elbows in poster paint and markers, being grilled by the boy while he traded pictures with the girl.  A wrinkled pile of sloppy drawings rested innocently on the bureau.
The tension seemed to ease a bit after that.  Steve set the tray down next to Tony and held his own bowl and quickly demolished his meal.  Tony immediately went about slowly picking out the noodles, chicken, and vegetables and laying them on a napkin, the liquid pooling in gullies in the paper.  Steve considered complaining, until Tony meekly asked for a straw, and Steve realized Tony probably wasn’t having a very good track record with solid food right now.
Tony jolts, needing to turn back time, only a few seconds because now he’s done it. He’s gone and fucked it all up. He’s taken a pair of cutters to the delicate wire that they have wound between them. Severed. And nothing will be the same.
The gold filament in Tony’s eyes is burning so bright Steve wonders if it might burn out.  But it won’t, he knows.  It’s burning from that newly opened gulf of love, and the fuel will never burn out.
Parents heard their children’s voices from the day they came of age until the moment of conception.  That meant for the foreseeable future, he was going to have witnesses to his every terrible decision.  Even if they wouldn’t remember.
“So,” Tony croaked.  “S'at lunch for me, or did you bring it up here to make me watch you eat everything as usual?”
“Peggy.”
The meeting, of course, ran over, because it was Fury.  Steve nearly broke the armrests on his chair clenching his fists to keep from punching the man.  Fury still thought that the Avengers were still under his jurisdiction, despite the fact that they were self-funded and Clint and Natasha were the only ones in SHEILD’s employ, and on a contractual basis at that.  And of course, Fury had to spend four hours ragging on Tony.
She looked nervous, more so than he’d ever seen her.  “You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?”
“It’s fine, Steve.”
Tony called, waving a pathetic hand.  He was on his back, listed limbs curled to the left.  He was wearing the pathetic smile of the seriously inebriated, and by the way his eyelids were flickering, was in and out of consciousness.
“Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.”
“Clinton, I refuse to take that wager.”
The dough and cheese seemed to curdle in his stomach, but Tony forced himself to stay calm. “Steve, would it make you happy to continue your old job?”
“No, your
Steve smiled in spite of himself.  “No, Tony.  It’s not illegal to be lost in thought.”
It was the biggest fashion story of the year.  The OPI Avenger Designer Collection became a sellout with several colors becoming part of the regular rotation, and they decided to produce several other limited edition colors, including
“An intelligence organization that fears intelligence?  Historically, not awesome.”
“Sorry, kids.  You don't get to see my party trick after all.” He almost looked disappointed.
Steve curled his fingers, Tony whining as he tried to get more pressure on his prostate.  Steve purposefully only skated it, loving the twisting, desperateness leaking from him.
And Steve had just spent hours fuming, but maybe Tony just didn’t care anymore.
“You mean
Naus made a face, which Tony would have as well if he were being reminded of his family’s incest.  “So, yeah.  I found Odysseus washed up on the seashore.  Before you ask, he smelled horrible and was covered in leaves and needed a haircut.  I brought him so see my father, and eventually his identity came out and we helped him home.  Poseidon was pissed, so he tried to curse us.  He got the family for a couple generations, but he wasn’t able to curse the island.”  She puffed up her chest, obviously proud of whatever was coming next.  “Athena appeared to me, and gave me a choice: either I could fulfill my destiny as a princess and be shipped off to be some old guy’s baby factory, or I could stay here forever and protect my people but never marry.  I asked her where the hell I should sign up.”  She preened at their laughter.  “I guard the shores from the worst storms, and I make sure the fishermen have enough to catch.  Not glamorous, but it’s so much better than doing everyone’s laundry.”
“Steve, it’s no trouble at all. I want you to be comfortable while you’re here.” He probably looked ridiculous, but in the face of Steve’s appreciative crooked smile, Tony couldn’t help the look of adoration that covered his face. Pepper was discreetly murmuring to the operator while Happy chuckled meanly.
They managed to organize themselves into an intimidating formation just as Loki woke up.
something within him whispers.
And there they were, so the next step would be to-
But while the feeling of emptiness from isolation is gone, another emptiness fills him, one that can only be filled with snide remarks, sleepless nights, coffee, and dazzling cognac eyes.
“Damnit, Nat!”  He drives a fist into one of his couch cushions, because there’s not much else he can do to relive the hot, jolting
Steve shifted their hands so that he was running his thumb over the ring.  “It’s common for sex-lives to dry up after a year or two.  Just the way it works.  We’ve had a lot of Avengers business recently.  And we’re not exactly young, are we?  We’re settled in our relationship, Tony.  We love each other and can figure out our problems when they arise,
It was terrible, awful, a strict breech of any bond of friendship and decorum and Tony couldn’t look away.
The klaxon sounded.
“Caught the ride on the road past Corinth.  Had a little trouble with the river Pikas.”
He was terrified, and he could see in Tony’s eyes that he was too, but holding his husband’s hand as they cradled the forming embryos of their children, he felt the most shining hope for the future he had ever had.  It was uncertain, and bound to be dangerous, but Steve had fought all his life.  He had fought so hard to be here right now.  All of his fighting was paying off.  He was going to have his family.
Steve’s actions made it really difficult to remind himself that Steve wasn’t interested.
The master strategist had figure the sleeping arrangement out: blanket cocoons beneath shared comforters.  Tony wasn’t going to complain.  Steve was like a furnace, so body heat would bleed over anyway.
“Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone.”
“Sure.”
“That looks great.  Thanks, guys.”
Tony cleared the mounds of paperwork from his desk without a second glance. He’d get to them eventually, he mused, and besides, there were more important things to deal with, weren’t there? Like the fate of the world? He plunked his attaché case down in the middle of the desk.
“I want to know what we would be like if we didn’t have the weight of the world hanging over us. Worlds. The galaxy. The universe.
He doesn’t. Tony alters his stance, calculating how much his armor can take.  It should hold.  Should.
For some reason the whole visit had left a lump in his throat.
She grinned manically.  “Whatever we need when the opportunity arises.”
. . . .
“Lovely.  We’ll have to do this again, sometime,” he called over his shoulder before urging the horse to a canter.
.  You’ve been through so much that made you into the man you are today.  Alone.  Or with us.  It’s fine to want to find your family, but – “
Dreams of a shower and bed forgotten, Tony settled in for the rest of the movie.  Steve shifted about for a few moments before resting less than a foot from Tony, head angled so his hot breath flooded over his neck.
she shrieked, ambushing Tony with a hug and yanking his left arm almost clean out of its socket.  She poked the ring.  “Oh, I like it.  Simple.  Classic.  It fits.”  She looked up at him, tears sparkling in her eyes.  “I’m so happy for you.”
like your buddy, and not to help people like him?”
“Yeah, and I threw up?”
be about a porn actress, but it’s sad how well it fits.”
Tony has wasted untold hours and money on developing the most sophisticated communications equipment and network for the Avengers. Built to withstand and survive any natural disaster, in any condition, in any corner of the Earth and a good many other places in the universe.
And despite their attempts to keep emotions out of it, they . . . well, failed spectacularly.
“Shut up.”  Barton probably meant it as a bark, but it came out like a whine.  “In the field, I’m the best at seeing things, because people hide in logical places.  It’s predictable.  Those books,” he shivered, “have no rhyme or reason to them.  ‘Oh hey, let’s put the safety pin in the public fountain.  Let’s put the dime in the crevice where no one would ever think to look.’  It’s
“Speak for yourself, Abs-donis,” Tony muttered, poking the abs in question and wringing a chuckle of Steve.
He was in love with Steve.  He knew it like electrical currents and alloys and physics, like he knew pain and hurt and loneliness.
know. He likes the smell of lavender; it reminds him of his mother. As much as he looks towards the future, he is terrified of being left in the past. He loves Steve with everything the twisted blackened thing that at one time might have been called his heart can muster. He doesn’t like sleeping alone. He always wants a drink. Every little thing that makes the man in the suit of armor tick.
“What?”
Steve grabbed for it with fumbling fingers and pressed his none almost entirely into the orange, focusing on the scent to chase away the memories.  Steve wasn’t the only one who couldn’t get the scent of burned bodies and explosions out his nose.
But it wasn’t nothing.  No matter what Tony said about branding, merchandizing, or looking cool, this was all for Bucky.
She looked terrified beneath her overdone makeup and fake smile.
“Fuck off, they always have some sort of cherry.”
.  But she loves them, so I do them.”  He looked ready for a fight.
came Maria’s exasperated sigh.
with Steve, in a group setting, because they don't want to let this change the team dynamic, and it’s both wonderful and terrible, because if things were slightly different, Steve’s arm would be around his waist and he would be able to make snide comments in Steve’s ear, and Steve would favor him with a smile that belonged only to Tony.
you grinning, Steve,” Tony called without turning around.
“Listen, I don’t care what backwater you guys are from, but I’m from Athens.  I’ve been wrestling since before I could walk,” Tony had to shout over their swearing.  Redwing cawed in agreement.
Not behind his back.  Steve didn’t owe him updates on his love life.
Steve set his jaw and averted his eyes.  They were starting to draw a crowd, and Tony knew how painful it still was for Steve to talk about the war.  Tony wanted so badly to know himself, but Steve hadn’t had time to process everything yet, so he didn’t push.  “They wanted footage of Captain America storming the beaches.  Symbolic, good for morale, and all that.”
But Howard didn’t care about anyone.  Not his legal family, not his concubines.  Only the comrades from the Hydric War were held in anything akin to love or esteem.
.  Before Korkyra came here, the island was known as Drepane, because of the scythe we taught them to use.  Though I certainly find Korkyra a prettier name,” she finished, reaching out to squeeze said woman’s hands.
Steve held his gaze for the longest moment. The air seemed to turn turgid, like molasses, but also crystalline like ice. Slow and brittle and beautiful, all because of Steve’s eyes.
, Steve wouldn’t budge until he was sufficiently open.  Sometimes Tony wanted the sting, but Steve was huge, and fucked him hard, so Tony was always comfortably sore afterwards.
The rain falls, heavy and free now. He does nothing to shield himself. He curls into himself more tightly, and presses his free hand over his eyes.

He stares at Steve, and Steve stares back, and that hesitant tender hope that lingers within him is reflected back.
“We have to find ourselves first.  There’s a psychological map for development that has different stages for development.  Basically, if you can’t pass one stage, you can’t move on in the map successfully.  Gaining a sense of self-identity and how we figure into the world comes before we can fully appreciate the complexities of our relationships with others.  It has ideal age brackets, but plenty of people are stalled somewhere, or try to skip over a stage.  But it’s not healthy.  I’ve – I’ve had to do a lot of soul-searching in the past few years.  And ever since – ever since I became Iron Man, I got blown back, and I have to figure out who I am again.  I still don’t know fully, but . . . I thought I might be getting somewhere, but then the Accords, and . . . .
something.
“Yes, sex is more important than us deciding to admit our undying love,” Tony threw a carrot at Clint’s head.  The archer somehow managed to catch it in his mouth.  “Plus, we have a lot of time to make up for.”
He learned very fast to wear sunglasses.
“You’re trying to set us up,” Steve guessed when it was just the two of them left in the kitchen.
Tony wrapped slim fingers around his wrist and yanked him to his feet.

Stark was mumbling as he worked through his ideas.  “He had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right?   That's what he wants.  He wants to beat us; he wants to be seen doing it.  He wants an audience.”
She sighed heavily, and pressed her cheek to the top of his head.  “Whatever is going on in your head, it’s probably wrong.  Stop,” she ordered.
The room was empty save for a darkly colored man in a bright saffron peplos with long sleeves, gold broaches shaped like the sun acting as fasteners.  He had a falcon perched on his shoulder, the same one who had flown over the trireme before, if Tony could trust his eyes.  The man was feeding the bird bits of food, sometimes putting the pieces between his lips for the falcon to take.

“No.” The guards and Happy all stared at him in disbelief. Steve just raised his eyebrows. “Perhaps I should, but I won’t. Release him.”

The tendons on his neck were still standing out in sharp relief, his knuckles white where he curled his fingers into fists. “You should have someone keep an eye on him,” he said through clenched teeth.
“What are you doing?”
“S’all right.  I know how it is.  This your little one?”
Why were the buildings black and white?  And the air was too clean.  The wind that was blowing through the windows was cooler than it should have been in late April.  Or was it May?  The air had no grit to it, and he could barely taste the pollutants.  It didn’t
Laying there, again trying to catch his breath, Steve lazily pulled a finger through the mess on his chest, and brought a finger up to taste.
“Steeeve.”
“Korkyra.”
Oh no.
“Why?  Cause we get along like a
The next twenty-four hours were a blur.  The twins were practically jumping with joy.  Their excitement was infectious, and helped quell some of Steve’s nervous anxiety.  He had been chosen for this serum.  He was going to war.
Comments are love.
“It’s the first time I did that, actually.”
Of course, they move into the Tower, and the isolation dissipates.
“You have to promise you’re not going to think I’m insane.”
Pepper nodded once again, pulling out her handwritten telephone directory, consisting of all the people that were “involved in taking care of Tony Stark in some way or another”. She flipped it to “Interior Design” and picked up the receiver. “I’ve got it from here, boss. Steve, once I get a hold of Brenda, I’ll have you speak with her in regards to what you’d like your rooms to be like.”
he teased, and after hearing Tony’s whine, brought his hand down, wrapping a slightly-rough palm around him.  Stroked firmly, just to the side of too hard.  “
Tony kisses the juncture of Steve neck.  “Deal.  Anything else?  Want an actual art studio?  I’ll have them build you an actual studio.  Darkroom, marble chisels, the works.”

“Shower?” Tony gasped in Steve’s ear as he squirmed, pressed against the wall of his bedroom back at the Tower.  “We stink.”
“Because I learned how.”
Steve worship was just another element of Howard’s preoccupation with the Hydric War.  Howard was obsessed with the war.  He remained in a constant state of apathy to everything around him, unless word came that an old ally was coming to visit.  Then was thrown into his nostalgic anger.  As with most men, Howard could not let go of the past.  His glory days were long over, but he clung to them with all he had, as he had abandoned everything else.  Tony was surprised that Howard hadn’t declared another war, just for the sake of replaying the past.

my meetings with Iron Man?”
He whines, and melts into Steve, and ruts into him like some sort of fucking animal.
“Lorraine!” he remembered after a minute, hugging her back. “What brings you here?”
And only Pepper and Rhodey know, so they’re the only ones who get to see him in his workshop, in sweats and tank tops, no sunglasses, no armor.
“Oh, yes. Just checking in with Mister Stark when the alarm sounded. He mentioned something about hiring a new bodyguard.” Steve
“Father, you are welcome to stay – “
The girl let out a frustrated huff.
Panting, Tony thanked whatever god that was watching over him that Steve seemed to be slowing down.  They had run
Warmth flooded him. “I’d love that.”
Steve and Thor rushed over, Thor ripping the golden faceplate off when they reached the prone figure of Iron Man.
“Yes, but you don’t have a filter.  You always say just what you’re thinking, so there’s never any mistaking your mood.”
She had shown him the letter.
“That’s it.”
– just knelt right down and scooped Tony up in a bridal carry. Maybe it was the oxygen deprivation or maybe it was his failing heart, but it was the hottest thing he’d ever had done to him. Which was saying something. “Mister, we’ve got to get you to a hospital!”
Tony steps away after that, going back to his original spot on the sofa and heaving out a deep sigh. Someone approaches him, and Tony expects it to be Peter or even Bruce, but when it’s Bucky, Tony tenses and sits up straight.
“Pete,” Bucky sighs and lays a hand over his nephew’s shoulder. “I’m sorry. I know you don’t want us to go, but we don’t have a choice. It’s our job to protect others. To protect you.”
“I know. I guess I’m just ready for this to be done. Maybe next time you can...I mean...if we’re lucky.”
“Don’t worry, darling.” Tony winks and leads Steve away, following the trail of roses.
“He won’t kill you.”
“Mr. Rogers, is there anything I can do for you?”
“That’s it,” Bruce gives an affirmative nod. He types something onto the keyboard attached to the monitor, freezing the image. “You look to be about 7 weeks along. I just need to get a few images, okay?”
Steve glances down at the plate of food, his stomach betraying him and growling at the sight of the perfectly cooked steak and potatoes. He wasn’t fed a meal like this all the time. It was a rare luxury.
“Yeah. Next time.”
Turns out Tony can follow directions, for the most part anyway. Cooking spaghetti wasn’t supposed to be a difficult task, but with an alpha that had no experience whatsoever in the kitchen, dinner takes longer to prepare. Steve has no trouble coming to Tony’s rescue when the sauce begins to bubble over the pot and splatter the stainless steel stovetop in red. He honestly finds Tony’s inexperience adorable.
“Um Auntie Nat, Uncle Bucky, Uncle Sam, Uncle Bruce, Uncle Thor, Uncle Clint. Iron man.”
“He gave up a lot for me. And I appreciate every single thing he did. He gave up his retirement and our trip to Disney World just so that he could keep me safe from the bad guys one last time. So yeah being an Avenger is hard and dangerous and you can risk losing everything, but I have to keep the ones I love safe. I can’t lose anyone else.”
“I know, but you don’t have to. I said simple.”
“It must be you, sweetheart.”
It’s not just his Uncle Bucky who wants to color; Uncle Sam and Auntie Nat are the next ones to ask for a crayon and page to color. It’s not long before the Avengers-minus his Papa- are coloring.
“Whoa! Easy there, kiddo,” Tony says when he enters the kitchen. He keeps the test behind his back and out of view. He doesn’t know how he’s going to ask his son about it, knowing if he’s too rough then he’ll have Steve to answer to.
Happy rolls his eyes. “What are you even distracting yourself from? Work?”
“I like them. Thanks, Sam.”
“Hey.” Tony smiles. “We’re almost done.”
Steve sighs sadly and slips his hand free from Tony’s. “I just need a little time. Can I have that?”
“Really? The bed, too?” Tony huffs, tugging harder on the blankets around him to get the dog off. His efforts prove futile. The dog peers up at him from its new sleeping spot, and Tony glares at him.
It was time to move on for good.
The couch does the job, offering as much comfort as it possibly can, but it doesn’t compare to large bed he usually shares with Steve. Tony almost considers swallowing his pride and going back to the bedroom, but then he remembers the dog is currently hogging his spot and with a huff he forces himself to get as comfortable as he possibly can.
“That’s not right,” Bruce says and he takes off his glasses to rub at his eyes. “This kid doesn’t deserve any of this.”
“Not how you always do. I didn’t get a hug-”
“Stop,” Tony pants and Steve pulls away. “Sorry. I’m-I don’t want to lose control.”
“I know.”
“Hey,” Tony says softly and comes closer. He’s tempted to pull Steve into a hug, but he holds back. “It’s alright. You have nothing to apologize for. I get it.”
They both look up when they hear the door to the lab open. Happy appears first, followed by a very excited Peter.
“I’m sorry!” Peter quickly apologizes. “I’m so sorry. I just want to leave. I-I-”
to be here.
“Alright, alright. I’m leaving.”
It soothes Peter to sleep. Just like it always does.
Tony releases a sob and collapses on the couch, hunching forward and burying his face into his hands, sobbing into them. The video is still playing in the background, the sound of Steve’s laughter only making Tony cry harder.
“It’s fine.” Bruce dismisses with a wave of his hand. “I was happy to help. I’m glad your son is okay. He looks like you.”
“Hey, you’re putting too much pressure on yourself. Or...maybe we put too much on you. Peter, I’m sorry. If we ever made you feel like you had to pick up the shield and follow in Steve’s footsteps-”
Pepper smiles. “Good. Now respond to those emails.”
The city is awake and bustling like every morning. The streets are already crowded with morning commuters. Peter is able to bypass most of it; swinging through the air was a much faster way to get around. Luckily no one notices him. The world didn’t know about Spider-Man yet.
The highlight of the evening had been Jan presenting him with a small box, reading
“You wrote, in that letter, that you hoped that someday I would understand.  I still don’t understand.  But you can
“Serves him right.  He never learned how to knock.  Fuckin’ raised by the circus,” Steve muttered.
“We’ll get this done, quick as we can.”  Natasha was draped over the back of his seat, still running her hands through his hair.  She had discovered years ago it turned him to putty.  Not today.  “It’ll go ten times as fast with you here.  We get the transmitter shut down, Steve can finish his mission, and in twelve hours you’ll be back at the Tower, with your fiancé, and you’ll be happy and back to your regular annoying self.”
The rotors slowed not a millisecond too late.
.  He’s – he’s made his own decisions, ones that weren’t easy to make.  He gained a kingship that he takes seriously.  Most kings don’t.”
Tony wanted to ask, but decide for the sake of his thirst he should play along.  He drew his sword, allowing Pikas to see the oiled bronze with its silver studs, forged by Tony’s own hand.
“I did do all of the heavy lifting.  Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu.  That was on you.”
“Ready?”
But it was only temporary.  They’d be tearing each other’s throats out again soon enough.
- eyes glinted. “Well, according to Mr. Stark’s security base data guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorized usage.”
Maybe he can’t burn everything, but maybe he can burn the man who left him the smoldering shell of what they’d built.
in the way that Steve watched him, lips falling open and head tilted slightly to the right. He blushed whenever Tony complemented him, stuttered when Tony was overly generous, and always stared into his eyes. Steve only called him Mister Stark when they were in the company of others. When it was Pepper or Happy, or just the two of them, he was just “Tony”. And it never ceased to send a thrill through him at the gentle way Steve shaped his name in his mouth.
“We’ll rough you up, too, Tony, don’t fret,” Clint had assured him while wrapping his hands after stripping and liberally oiling himself.
They wound through the main courtyard, which Steve had bypassed earlier.  The floor here was also done in breathtaking mosaic, this time a white and blue geometric pattern.  A few cooking fires burned lowly near the walls as the poor made their dinners.
Steve should know that.
Tony had tried to pull him into the bed with him, but Steve had resolutely sat on the floor, watching the door for any possible intruder.  He didn’t think of Tony sleeping soundly above him.
“She wouldn’t have
Steve hesitated, which apparently gave Tony an answer.
It’s an old lady vase, but Tony still wants to cry.
So all Tony could do is point Steve in the right direction and hope he wasn’t forgotten. Because Steve was to be great, there was no doubting it. Steve was destined to change the world, and soon enough he would leave. Tony hoped to change the world, and doing it in tandem with Steve would be more than he could ever ask for, but it couldn’t always be like this, sharing pizza on a slow afternoon.
Bucky had just gotten out of an appointment with one of the best prosthetic surgeons around, who was very interested by the recent offer from Stark Industries to be the surgeon to implant Tony Stark’s newest endeavor: a metal-and-carbon fiber forearm that mimicked actual muscle movements and would seamlessly integrated itself within the nervous system, making it the most advanced bio-hybrid limb yet.  It didn’t matter that Tony
“Tony-“
“No, I always heard the arc reactor was a stepping stone for something greater.  It was gonna kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race.  He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple a battery.  You dad said you were the only one with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.”
He was
“Where am I, really?”
There’s a tone in his voice, one he doesn’t want to hear.  There’s something final, resolute in it, and the words that follow must be something he’s thought long and hard about.
“Ignore them both.  They’re weird.  But Bruce,” Natasha pointed with her chin, “lives out here.  Bruce?” she called.
“Like-like the Argonauts?”
“so I feel confident to say he’s sufficiently recovered.”
The eyes that enrapture him are confused, scared, worried, terrified, but Tony’s the one who leans in first anyway.
The entire expanse of seashore seemed to come second to the water.  It was so blue, bluer than the sky and Steve’s eyes.  Rich, deep blue out in the deep waters, and more turquoise waters, variable with shadows, so clear so could see straight to the bottom along the shore.  Epirus rose to the east, sharp cliffs and forbidding forest.  Tony knew that those forests weren’t home to any humans until you reached Dodona, far to the east.  Other islands rose dramatically from the water, and Tony imagined he could see Leukas and Ithaka and Kephallenia.  Far, far to the west, Tony could see a haze of land, and remembered how Steve said you could see Italy on a good day.  He passively wondered how long it would take to get from Korkyra to Zancle.
.  When it came to wrestling, this version was as close to a free-for-all as possible.
“Just how would it forever change my world?”
Natasha just rolled her eyes, and wound a work belt around her waist, strung with pouches and more vials and several work knives.  She drew the needle-like blade he remembered from yesterday.  “I’m making opium, remember?  And you’re getting hazed.”
He’s smacked again.
Tony scoffs. “Guess we failed at that. We are the world’s worst parents.”
“We just started,” Steve explains and he slides over the file he had been going over. Tony leans forward to take a peek. “A new AIM research facility has appeared on our radar. It’s worth looking into.”
“I had to-”
Tony wanted him to get out and explore the world he had been missing, but he understood that his mate and children weren’t ready for that yet. One day they will be and Tony couldn’t wait to show them the goodness that was in the world.
“Knock it off,” Natasha warns.
“Okay so maybe this isn’t the simple you wanted but I thought we could have some fun, try something new.”
“You mean the serum?” Tony asks.
Natasha luckily takes control of the situation and has everyone smiling again. “He’s the cutest Avenger I’ve ever seen.”
“What?” Peter frowns. When his aunt giggles, his face reddens and he asks again. “What’s so funny!”
“I never said for you to force yourself.”
“Are you done?”
Steve hesitantly rises to his feet. His hand is grabbed and he’s yanked closer and toward the hall where the bedroom is located. The door is thrown open and he’s led to the large king bed.
“Man, dollar slices are better than this shit,” Clint complained.  He let out a little grunt-squeak that meant Natasha had kicked him under the table, even though she looked wholly invested in unwrapping her sandwich.
The main structure of the “palace” was like that of a larger house in Athens, but far more cluttered and sparsely appointed.  The main house was the normal two stories, well-kept but showing its age, with a number of additions and outbuildings criss-crossed with low stone walls for corralling livestock in the winter, but in the summer divided the outside into workspaces.
skin, or god forbid, hold his hand.
So, no kids to carry on the Stark name.  It was fine.  Really.
“But I’m here to work on the hexachordal proliferation,” Bruce protested.
Pepper and the others were preparing to leave, promising to bring Tony burgers and maybe cheesecake tomorrow.
Whenever Steve comes down to the workshop now, he’s already hard and grabby, and Tony drops everything, because he can’t not give Steve things when he wants them.
“Lots of somethings, but yes.”
“Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around?”
He stopped sucking lightly on Steve's tongue, and moved to kiss his collarbones, and mouth at the hard planes of his chest through the flimsy material of his t-shirt, moving steadily down to where Steve's cock arched and strained for the warmth it seemed to know would soon envelop it.
“Bucky elected to be re-frozen until we can come up with a way to fix his head.”
Tony quickly turned heel, sliding out of the kitchen with a distinctive sway to his hips.
Tony bit back a scathing retort.
He remembers seeing glass like this, in his childhood home and other places.  Grandmas coo over it.  This piece is more streamlined, simpler than the ribbed and ruffled edges and fancy engravings.
A chuck of metal paneling was ripped away, revealing blond-haired blue-eyed face. In his delirium, Tony had to admit it was probably the most handsome face he’d ever seen. “No,” he rasped, coughing, “I’m pinned by the wheel. Just get – get back.”
Infantry,” Caroline beamed.  “He was always so proud of his service.”
“Oh, shut up, you!” Tony fumed while Steve laughed at Peter’s commentary.
“You already fucked?  Now
He didn’t move.  This was the last he would have of this.  He was going to savor it.
On his part, Steve seemed already practiced at understanding Tony’s humor.  He laughed.  “It’s fun, what can I say?”  Steve sobered.  “But really Tony, sticking to your beliefs . . . .”  He sighed.  “It’s almost impossible.  And the Athenian Court?  I can’t imagine.  You will need a strong will, Tony.  Thankfully, you already seem to have one.”  He finished with a conspiratorial wink.
together.  We’re smart, able, and hella attractive.  But we even each other out, and we both need that happy, okay.  We fit tighter like clock cogs, designed to move with each other perfectly and
It was quiet.  He could never remember this kind of quiet, stillness and comfort but still mocking.  In Athens, and every other city he’s been in, night was weighted, waiting for something to happen.  It would occasionally echo with dogs barking, slurred singing from the drunks, slaves on midnight errands, the husky calls of the prostitutes along the city walls, random screams and calls and whispers wrapping the air in a baited breath.  The air in the city was waiting for night to pass, so things could proceed with the return of light.
“He’s fine.  Just needs some air.  Come on, Steve,” Natasha steered him out of the room, Tony’s worried eyes and Clint and Thor’s argument about cheesecake sizes following them.
“There was some talk . . . you as Iron Man’s financier, that maybe . . . ugh, this is difficult.” Steve slumped back in his chair and rubbed his temples.
“Can we not do this here?  Now?  With –“ Damnit, Tony couldn’t breathe.  “With the lives of seven billion at stake?”
The elevator opened with his usual soft ping, and Steve was already halfway down the hall.  The windows had returned to transparency, and Steve could see Tony slumped over on the floor by one of his work benches.
After dinner, Thor’s Icelandic friends decided they needed to show the puny Americans how to drink and party, so Clint and Natasha had gone to put them to shame.  Sam just got shitfaced for the sake of it, and whenever he was turned down by anyone, he was good-natured about it.  Bucky sat at the bar, downing micro brews and fancy cocktails, and laughing whenever people fell over (which happened a lot).
“There’s hope – “
Tony studies the still creature carefully.
I applaud you if you are getting the Greek names ;)
Tony examined the figures painted onto the sides and lid of the jar he held.  White poplars, owls, ghostly figures drifting between the trees along the sides.  The lid showed the throne room of Hades, Persephone and attendants gathered to watch the judgement of a particularly unlucky soul.
“Is everything a joke to you?”
Thanking whatever good luck had blessed him with a handsome stranger with Herculean strength and tight (if full) lips, Tony fell to the floor and crawled the last several feet to the outlet. He ripped his shirt open and with trembling fingers, plugged the retractable power cord into the socket, and collapsed with a groan against the wall.
“Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you.”
Love is fire. Something unique to man. Something dangerous. Classified by some as tool, by others an untamable force of nature. Dangerous. Very dangerous. It burns when it gets too close to the core of one’s being. But cold is another danger.
They both struggle to switch the babies, and after a few failed attempts, Tony lets out a frustrated sigh.
He’s not sure if he wants to cry or scream. Maybe both. Becoming a parent was terrifying and though he had months to prepare for Peter’s birth, he didn’t feel ready. But now he had Harley and it was too much. A baby was something he always wanted, and he was lucky enough to get two when he thought he’d never get one, but it was too much.
It’s not until they’re led to a small lounge room toward the end of the hall does James relax. He immediately lets go of his brother’s hand when he notices the table against the wall with an abundance of snacks and drinks.
Peter’s heard that name before. Once. “Wait, that’s Jarvis! Oh cool!” Peter exclaims.
The grip he has on Steve’s cheek tightens and he forcefully tilts Steve’s neck to the side, exposing the mark Tony had put there. One glance in the steel blue eyes has Steve’s blood running cold.
“You did?”
“I’m sure Pete won’t mind. Do we know if he even likes this guy? I thought Flash was that punk that constantly picked on him?”
Tony almost feels bad for closing the door on Dodger, but then Steve is kissing him again and for a moment he forgets that they even own a dog now. It’s not until the whining and scratching on the door starts does Tony remember that it’s not just him and Steve anymore. That was going to take some getting used to.
