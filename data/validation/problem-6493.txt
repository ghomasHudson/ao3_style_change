"I'm sure." Steve insisted, still smiling fondly. "I'm sure because... the very fact that you're asking yourself that question now, tells everything about you. I
—and forces Steve and Loki to move apart to slouch between the two of them. He turns to Steve first and catches his mouth in a hot, filthy kiss.
Steve is not one to believe in destiny and yet, he can feel it in himself that they were meant to be. Him and Bucky, they were meant for Tony, all along. Both of them. Only them could ever satisfy an alpha like Tony. Only them could ever provide him everything he needed. Only Tony could ever provide them with what they needed. The three of them, they all needed each other.
Tony shook his head, the hint of a smile growing on his face. He chuckled, sounding slightly bitter. "I'm really starting to wonder if I did stand out after all, or was it just because I was the most persistent of them of all..."
Steve gaped at him, dumbfounded and unable to answer the question. His heart was beating so fast he thought it was going to explode. It almost hurt. He stared at the alpha silently, face growing pale and wary. He knew he was.
The omega looks at him, eyes pleading. His entire demeanor begs him to take him right now. He's struggling too, against their nature, Tony can feel it. He should get away from here this instant but then the omega whimpers and more than his arousal, it's his distress Tony can't turn away from. Sexual urges he can control but fighting his protective instincts to the point of rejecting comforting the omega when he is in such a state of distress, he just can't.
Steve stared at him, chest heaving, and realized how much he hoped Tony would. How much he hated that everyone was going to be able to see that painting. How much he regretted selling it and how much he wanted it back.
"You don't have sex toys?" Steve asked disbelievingly. It was something he had never asked himself, actually, and never bothered to look for in the Penthouse. He just couldn't imagine that Tony Stark wouldn't have at least one or two kinky things hidden in his apartment, even only to play with his sex partners. But then again, on second thoughts, he had difficulty imagining Tony pleasuring himself with a toy and he hardly ever brought his sex partners to his place.
that he shouldn't call Steve whenever he fucked up. Steve had no business cleaning up his own mess. No-one did. He
Tony threw a burning glance at him as he propped up on his elbows. "Not fair! You still look like you're 21 while I look
Just like every morning Steve walked behind him and brushed his fingers on his boyfriend's back. Tony shivered and sighed melancholically so Steve stopped and wrapped his arms around him and enveloped him in a loving hug. He planted a silent kiss onto his neck, that made his boyfriend shiver again, and released him as soon as Tony grabbed his wrist to make him stay. He felt Tony's gaze linger on his back when he made them breakfast. Just like every morning Steve came back to the table with food and sat opposite Tony after leaving a bowl of cereals in front of him.
Tony flinched. He felt those last words piercing through his heart like an arrow and started shuddering all over as panic and anxiety came back at once, engulfing him into a dark and putrid place. A place he had thought he would never go back to. He didn't want to go back. He felt his hands tremble and huddled on himself, squeezing tight around his knees to force the shaking away. He tried to subdue his breathing but he was starting to hyperventilate again. Why did Steve bring him here? Why didn't he leave him with those guys? Why didn't he dump his ass in a ditch, where Tony belonged to, if he didn't want him? Obie had. Everyone else had.
It wasn't enough for Obie apparently and he pushed harder on Tony's back to make him fall on his knees, which was almost relieving because Tony wasn't sure his shaky legs would have held him much longer. His knees hit the tiled floor and hurt. The man used that moment of confusion to grab Tony's wrists in one strong and powerful hand and pushed his head into the toilet bowl, at least it was relatively clean... He held his head down into the water until Tony choked and kept pounding into him. The slide was easier now, as if Tony had somehow self-lubricated, and he started feeling it. Because, yeah, he was fucked-up like that. He didn't have the time to enjoy himself however because Obie grunted and jerked inside of him. Tony knew he had come. It had only lasted a few minutes.
Tony had a weird look in his eyes for a split second and then he contradicted Steve. "No, we didn't." He said with a half-amused half-bitter smile. "We actually met at the diner." He said looking at their audience and then his eyes focused back on Steve. "I know you weirdly seem to keep forgetting about it but I do remember every detail of that day, you know."
Tony wrapped his arms around him comfortingly. "You're rutting again, aren't you?" He whispered in his ear. Steve wrapped hesitating arms around his waist and nodded softly in the crook of his neck. "I'm sorry." Tony said. "My scent must not be helping."
"You know perfectly well that's not what happened." His friend chokes out. "I've never shared a heat with
A whole bunch of emotions appeared on the tall brunet's face. Surprise. Confusion. Doubt. Wariness. Hope. Anger. Smugness. Joy. He parted his lips for a split second and then he smiled. A genuinely happy smile, soft and generous. His eyes twinkled gratefully.
At this rate he will have a stroke soon, keeping a clear mind is an ordeal already. All his blood rushed down to cock. Why does it have to be a constant struggle with himself? It's even harder to resist ever since he and Steve are having sex again, as if instead of calming his urges and satiate them, having sex with Steve just awoke the beast in him and he's become an insatiable, hungry and brainless sex-addicted being.
It is amazing for so many different reasons. First, it allows each of them alone time with Alpha. Secondly Bucky can enjoy himself fully, without having a lingering worry nagging at the back of his mind because he trusts his fellow omega with Felicia better than he trusts himself. Thirdly, having moments of clarity like this, sweet and soft moments during which he can reconnect with his daughter, know that she's there, that she's safe, that they are a family, makes spending his heat with the alpha and the omega during the night all the more meaningful and deep.
"She's sleeping. Night shift..." Steve deadpanned without further comment. "Follow me?" He held out a hand to Tony who took it gently.
Just enjoying yourself with a consenting partner. It's still hard for Tony not to put more into it. Except with Steve. Steve helps him do that. With Steve sex in an act of love. Nothing else. Most of the time, at least.
Tony's flashy smile with a glimpse of sheepishness had always been his best protection. It would protect Steve too, apparently.
Tony shrugs. "We don't!" He exclaims, taking another drag and blowing the smoke in front of him. It's already starting to take effect. Time feels slower and he wants to giggle with no reason.
The brutal shove made his dick tingle. He gasped and stared lewdly at the owner of that hand. Tony's vision was too hazy for him to discern his face but the eyes were wanton, that was enough. The man studied him for a short moment, Tony made sure his own face said yes, he didn't have it in him to speak. He hoped the guy wouldn't mind. Apparently he didn't. With a manly grip on the back of Tony's head, the man shoved his tongue in his mouth and pressed his body against him. Tony melted into the kiss at first, caught off guard. His breath was hot and smelt like booze, it was heady. Then the man's hand slipped down his stomach and into his pants, grabbing his dick and started kissing his neck with too much tenderness. His hold on Tony's nape was gentle. Shit. The guy was too nice, Tony needed to change that. He let the guy play with his half-hard cock for a while before pushing him away. He didn't want to be kissed anyway.
"You need to stop coming late, man." Sam said after a blissful silence. "Buck and I are gonna have to escort you to class from now on if we want to keep you alive until the end of the term."
Tony looked in dismay and Steve reached out to him. He grabbed him by the arm and squeezed, a reassuring hand on his wrist. "I know, Tony." He whispered, voice so low he could barely be audible. "It's just me.
And he hates himself even more when he knows James doesn't look at him like that, because he has accepted. And that's maybe the worst of it.
Tony was very distant at first but living together did all of them good. It felt right, being back here. The festering stopped and the damaged skin around his gland started to heal. After a week already, it looked rather like a bluish bruise with purple shades. It didn't hurt that much. After three weeks Steve was completely healed. His gland had recovered its round and rosy aspect and pulsated softly whenever Tony entered the room. His heart beat fast as well, and a wave of thrilling warmth pooled in his stomach, but he kept it to himself mostly. None of them was ready. Steve wasn't even sure if they would ever. What was important now was for the pack to find some kind of cohesion again. It was important for them, and for Felicia, to be strong and united.
Fortunately for Steve, he was never feeling down for too long and soon he willed himself back on Dickens. He raised his head, took a deep breath, ignored how much breathing still hurt and focused on what the teacher was saying. It helped that something—or someone—else would distract him from his dark thoughts for the rest of the day.
"And then no-one was waiting on us, and my dad was upset—to say the least—and finally, Steve in all his glory and his bold professionalism, came to our table. My dad started to insult him, like the jerk he was, and I...I just couldn't take my eyes off him because he was so fucking beautiful up close and because, I don't know, there was something more about him, I'm not sure really but.... Who the fuck was this guy who offered the same dedication to that homeless old lady and to Howard fucking Stark?" Tony's voice was ecstatic and his eyes twinkled before he calmed himself down on his own, trying to repress his excitement. His smile was huge though, huge and hazy and there were stars in his eyes. Steve felt his heart leap.
"But you like that about me, don't you?" Tony grinned smugly. "Stark men get what they want. You should know that by now." He said provocatively, and then added, with a bit more hesitation in his voice. "Would we be together if I wasn't?"
Tony hasn't touched a cigarette once since he smashed his pack in his hand up on that roof though. A small victory.
The flashes blinded them as soon as they got out of the limo. Tony held his hand firmly. He could always count on his boyfriend's overconfidence and self-control in those situations. Steve just let him take the reins and gladly followed his lead. They posed for the paparazzi and Tony flashed his sexiest smile while holding Steve in a tight and protective embrace. He hoped his own smile wouldn't look too strained. He felt a slightly perverted pleasure however, at seeing how his boyfriend looked a little disheveled like they just had hot angry sex in the car. It was both embarrassing and extremely arousing.
He didn't know what happened after that. Maybe Tony had been a little presumptuous with his goal. He had stopped counting, he just wanted to throw up again.
They both hurried to gather all of his sketches before they got ruined until Tony's fingers brushed Steve's as he was handing him the last one of them.
Steve was drunk, and he was a bitter drunk at that, seeing him like this broke Tony’s heart. He watched his boyfriend trying pathetically, and failing, to swallow his beer to the last drop like an alcoholic and then staggering to the fridge when he finally realized it was empty, to grab another.
Bucky is drifting away next to him on the vast ocean that is their alpha's strength, completely free but never lost. It is the most wonderful feeling Steve has ever had. The two omegas keep touching each other, caressing each other for hours. They have orgasms without even coming. Just with their minds. They don't know if it's them or the other one, or Tony. It's insane, absolutely wonderfully, mind-blowingly insane.
there..." Pepper reminded him. "And I'm fine skipping the drinking fest altogether. You just want me there as emotional support because all of Steve's friends are gonna be there and you're having kittens."
And yeah, he did. His boyfriend glanced at him sheepishly, half the beads already in his mouth, looking like a hamster making provisions. He made a choked gurgling noise.
"We met in a club." Steve blurted, sounding bored, trying to cut the conversation short. He was really hoping they would drop it when they heard how banal it was. He didn't want to share.
Steve slipped his fingers into his hand and grabbed it firmly. "I said I'll come, didn't I?" Steve said resolutely and then he dropped his boyfriend's hand to cup his cheek and give him a languorous kiss, because he was a little stressed out and Tony looked so fucking good in his three-pieces tuxedo and Steve had pretty much wanted to do that as soon as he saw him standing in front of the elevator, waiting for him with a sly smile.
Steve's hand keeps fondling Tony's cheek. "I know how much you're struggling. And frankly, when I asked you stop, I never thought you'd take it so seriously. I know you haven't smoked one cigarette since that day on the rooftop. And it's okay if you're tired or if you need to chill out or if you'd rather stay home and rest... or work. I know you're doing this for me, Tony, and I wanna say that..." Steve grabs Tony's face with both hands and looks at him with hesitancy. "that moving in with you was one of the best decisions I've made in my life. Just like every forward step I took in our relationship. You make me so happy, baby."
The glass was suddenly cold in his hand so he snapped out of it. He drank a swig and felt the sweet fizzy liquid tingle his throat. "What is this?" He asked while looking at his glass funny.
Tony was very gentle and respectful and never brutal and he treated Steve with care like he was the most precious thing on earth. And Steve liked that. A lot. The kiss ended slowly as they both kept nipping at each other lips, tasting each other's mouth, breathing each other's smells. It was glorious, despite Tony's wet clothes.
Steve's heart skipped a beat. He lifted his eyes to him, almost imploring. He was aiming for apologetic but his body didn't seem to agree with his mind. It was already a furnace in Tony's hands and Steve's brain hadn't much say in his actions anymore.
Sam's hand shied away and they both pretended this moment had never happened. The alpha still put a protective hand on his Steve's shoulder while ushering him inside however and no-one at the entrance gave them a second look. Maybe that was the perks of "dating" the quarterback.
Steve tried to ignore the shock of realizing Tony knew and wasn't rebuked by it whatsoever. The alpha didn't even react. The news kind of warmed his heart and he hugged onto him a bit firmer. "Right... You like alphas..."
"It affects me too, you know." Tony added. His scent spiked again and it was enrapturing, sweet and delicious and Steve wanted to lick him again, imagined doing it, tried to picture his body through the shape hidden underneath his shirt and from the touch of his hands on him and from his memories, of all the times he stared him, ogled him, devoured him with eyes.
There's someone behind him. The opening door snapped him out of his reveries. He doesn't turn around and prays for it to be Clint. Clint would comfort him and say nothing and wouldn't judge. He feels a warm hand on his back but it's not Clint.
"You know what I mean, moron!" Steve chuckles, still feeling disturbed by the whole idea however. "I don't wanna procreate. I'm not that kind of omega. And you
Tony listens, flabbergasted. He doesn't know what to say, he doesn't know what to think. He doesn't know what he feels anymore. He doesn't know
Tony happened to be a really nice guy in fact. Very studious, very curious and interested. The complete opposite to the smug bad boy image people had portrayed in their imagination. He wasn't anything like that. He wasn't a bad boy. He was a genius. He was brilliant. He was funny. (And rich, not that Steve cared the least.)
"These are just unfounded and despicable theories," Steve snarled. "You, people, really need to get out in the real world, get back to your pathetic and unfulfilling lives and stop projecting your fantasies on us. I'm sorry to break it up to you and tell you the sad truth but Captain America and Iron Man are just fictional characters and don't exist in real life. Thank you. Next please."
He didn't have the heart to go to the backrooms yet so he staggered to the dance floor. He wasn't walking straight, maybe he stumbled once or twice. It didn't matter, it was crowded enough that Tony wouldn't fall, only bump into warm, sweaty chests with heady smells. Tony could only see that as a positive thing and, on the plus side, a great opportunity for nice encounters.
"We'll buy something together if you insist..." Tony mumbled in agreement, voice muffled by the fabric of Steve's flannel. "but I have conditions."
When he finally thrusts into him it's slow and gentle but deep and hard. He builds their orgasm slowly, thrust after thrust, clutching so hard on the omega's hips. This time his omega cries in pleasure. This time it's not urgent and necessary. It's desired and fully accepted. It's glorious. It's magical. It's wonderful.
Tony turned to him, expression confused, half-surprised, half-interested. "You rejected Wilson? How come? Not your fancy?"
"Have you been bullied before?" Steve asked. "At your former school? Is that why you got transferred?"
at once, so evident. Everything transparent. His thought are no longer his thoughts, his feelings are no longer his feelings. They've become part of a whole. Their souls mingled to form one, almost complete but not entirely yet.
Steve isn't going to pretend he hasn't been depressed about it. When Tony unsurprisingly got accepted at MIT, they celebrated happily, a huge step for him and for all omegas, but parts of Steve had cringed and took the blow with a strained smile. It's not like it wasn't expected. Steve knew, when they started going out, that their relationship was just borrowed time. Tony has always been destined for grander things. Steve will attend English and art courses at Brooklyn college. He will stay home with his Ma and if he's lucky enough, he'll get a job he actually likes doing in the future.
"Yes, I do." Steve replied in a choked whisper, inaudible even to himself. He straightened up on his knees and firmly grabbed his boyfriend's ass, drawing a sexy, wanting moan out of him, and started licking slowly the underside of his cock with the tip of his tongue right to the top of the head. Tony gasped and lost balance. He caught himself on the wall, hands splayed wide on the wet tiles, while Steve swallowed the head of his cock and teasingly grazed the underside of it with his teeth. He sucked his cock, slowly, softly, relishing in the way Tony's body responded so earnestly. He was rock-hard too, incidentally, but that didn't matter at the moment. Only Tony mattered. Only pleasuring him was important to Steve right now and he took a sadistic pleasure to bring him slowly to the edge, until his moaned and shivered from head to toe, and slow down, to make it last. He slid his mouth along the shaft softly but surely until the head touched the back of his throat and then he pushed further, slowly deep-throating himself on Tony's hard rod. This was something he had learnt to do with Tony. It wasn't something he craved for, not like Tony did, but he didn't mind doing it and he knew his boyfriend loved it. So he swallowed the entire length of his boyfriend's cock and moaned around lewdly, aroused by the knowledge that Tony would love it.
Tony instinctively shielded him, flashing his best smile. The one only Steve knew the edges were strained.
"You okay man?" Loki asks without meaning it—Tony will not grant him with a reply anyway, so it doesn't really matter. "Glad you could make it!" He adds with a sly smile.
When he comes down to the nest to see Felicia, Steve is the one holding her in his arms. He's natural with her. He raises her just like one of his own and it's absolutely marvelous to observe. The nest smells safety and comfort. A warm and welcoming shelter for his little Felicia who is overprotected by two omegas.
was another interesting concept. One he was too wasted to study right now. People should really stop asking questions Tony didn't have the answers to. He just shrugged. The more the merrier, wasn't it? Tony hoped they would hurt him.
Tony clicked his tongue in his mouth and pinched his lips, looking away. "No, it's fair... I get it." He replied hoarsely. "Makes sense." He climbed down the stool and poured himself another glass of wine while Steve's watched him walk away to the living room, arms dangling helplessly on his sides. He watched him turn some music on and lean on the couch with the glass in his hand, looking down pensively, and finally set to clear the counter.
, discovering things about each other. It's different. And we're... It's helped us focus on us, I guess, on our couple, our projects... I mean, we
cute." Betty mewled. Everyone seemed to feel the same. Steve was fuming. His heart was still pounding hard in his chest.
Tony wished he could do the same, he usually did, but he was absolutely incapable of moving a limb now.
Steve!" Tony snapped, eyes flaring. "I did it with Stane..." He added, eyes challenging and dignified. "Is that what you want?"
"I get it, Tony. You two love birds needed time to enjoy your newlywed's home." He smiles gently, reassuringly and looks at Tony's hand. It is shaking again. "Do you need another drink, baby Stark?"
"Oh..." Steve exclaimed, confusedly. "I thought—with your experience." But most of all...did Tony expect
He looked around at the three men who stared at him bewilderedly, a tinge of amusement in their grin. Then he stared down at himself, his stained pants, his disheveled shirt. He had only come once today, he thought, and he wasn't really sure how it had happened but right now he wasn't hard anymore. He took a cigarette out and lit it, stared at the plastic bag in his hand and pondered taking another dose, to up the mood a little.
"We used to fight all the time." Clint explained. "I think every time I opened my mouth he was onto me. After each session I really wanted to murder him. He was such an ass!"
he exclaimed, "have a crush!" His heart was racing however, unconsciously aware of some dishonesty on his part, perhaps. He shrugged the feeling off. "I haven't even presented yet."
And then Steve regained his consciousness and realized that Tony had kissed him and that he wanted that again. He looked at him and reached out a hand. Tony must have felt it somehow because he turned back to him, eyes intent on him. He was deliciously flushed and looked a little insecure. the sight of him so cute it churned Steve's stomach.
Tony." Steve raised unapologetic eyes to him. "It doesn't mean anything to me. I've got all the supplies I want in the tower... of better quality too."
"That time when you kept rambling about Iron Man and Captain America, saying they were meant for each other and everything."
Steve took his hand and Tony tugged on it, making Steve stumble into his arms. He kissed him again, softly but languorously.
Tony doesn't really have a choice however. Steve and Loki are already deeply in the process of catching things up. He doesn't even want to try to get involved. He's at least three drinks short for that. Hopefully Clint will join soon.
Steve looked down, looking for the right words. He wetted his lips. "It's not." He finally answered. "It might have been true, in the past, but I really was in a bad place then. It was just my way of getting over you, I guess. But I also had a lot of issues to deal with and not everything was about you. I—" He paused, running a soft and comforting hand on his boyfriend's cheek. "I guess it's more about overcoming a dark period of my life than about how I really see you, or saw you then..."
Others, like Bucky -who’d been his best friend in the army, and his most loyal companion ever since-, already were aware of why Anthony Stark hadn't left after the transaction was completed. Bucky had raised a judgemental eyebrow when he heard that as a term of agreement to the sale of the estate Stark had also been hired as the Lord’s new personal secretary. For a man born with a title to be forced to work for a living, it was as much of a scandal as the true nature of their agreement would be, if it ever came to light. Bucky, knowing all about Steve's old infatuation, definitely suspected there was more to the bargain.
The people who loved him, who cared for him, Jarvis, Pepper, Rhodey, they all knew who Tony really was. That was all that mattered where his reputation was concerned.
Barnes shook his head, walking into the room, door silently closing behind him. “No need. I was just looking for a book,” he drawled, and Tony had to resist an eye roll at the obvious lie. “I didn’t expect to find you here. Do you have any suggestions for me?”
Stone huffed. “Or else what?” he asked, laughing at the fury written on Steve’s face. “As if I would want anything to do with him, Rogers. He’s spoiled goods. No better than a
This was who Anthony Stark had been all these years. Who he had probably been all the time, even back then when Steve was too blind to realize it, too young and too
“It will be only a small one, you understand. Such short notice… But, I was wondering if you would be willing to offer your assistance to Miss Potts until the night of the ball? Perhaps you could go with her to distribute the invitations to our neighbours?” Steve added, trying to keep his manner casual, although probably failing miserably.
Even though he couldn’t really be sure of it, Steve knew then and there that the light was coming from Tony’s room. Steve moved as if he was in a trance, his feet taking him to his destination without a conscious thought from his part.
“I’m surprised…” Steve remarked, breaking the silence. “I seem to recall you were a better rider than me back then, Mr Stark,” he said, smirking.
of this man. To Steve, Lord Anthony Stark had been a smart, enticing and almost always out of reach dream of a man. How heartbroken he had been when he had gotten rejected had almost paled in comparison to the ache the realization of Tony’s true character had brought.
Lord Rogers. He says it’s all a front, and that he has forced Rogers to pay him a salary and everything! That way he is free to continue with his life of debauchery…”
The staff loved their former master, it was plain for all to see. It had come as a bit of a surprise to Steve at first. For the infamous Tony Stark, a philandering dandy that had been in one precarious situation after another for the better part of a decade, to inspire such devotion in the people so close to him, surely that must mean something.
It was there, amongst his most treasured and secret possessions, that Steve had hastily shoved the letter he received from Fury the other day. He had thankfully been quick enough to hide it from Tony’s curious eyes, though he’d reacted a bit too harshly to the man’s well-intentioned nosiness.
Sorry for taking so long to update, real life had to come first. I should be picking up a better pace with this from now on.
Through the gaps in the forest, he could just make out the ruins of the old chapel that marked the property’s west border. Tony loved that small clearing. He used to spend hours playing amongst those very ruins as a child, most of them with Steve as his companion.
“Oh, for goodness sake, Peter, would you get those beasts in hand before they feast on our guests?” he heard Tony exclaim, teasing, if a little exasperated.
Boldly, Tony took a step forward, then another and finally he was at grasp length from Steve. From that close, Steve couldn’t help but marvel at their physical differences. He was shorter than Steve, slighter too. So different from what they'd been before. And yet he looked eerily like the same, almost delicate Tony from his past. Again, the wild thing inside Steve roared with approval. This, Tony, was his to have.
“See? Now you’re thinking. Ha, I’m always right, boy,” Tony laughed, bringing his hand to playfully flick at Peter’s nose. It left them both giggling, mood lighter than before.
It went on for a while, Tony feeling in all his senses the presence of Steve. On him, around him, inside him. At some point, he reached down to his own neglected cock stroking it to the rhythm of his and Steve’s lovemaking.
Lord Stark still lives there with him!” her companion, a chubby, balding man of a similar age, boasted.
“You’re so quiet when we’re like this,” Steve whispered. They were lying in bed, Tony in Steve’s arms, exhausted from their vigorous lovemaking, the soft warmth of the comforter surrounding their sweaty, bare bodies. The candles had long gone out and Steve could barely make out Tony’s delicate features in the almost complete darkness. It made him bolder, braver. Made him almost forget where they were, how they’d gotten there.
, disappearing but a week before all that fuss with the company started! Poor master Tony was fed to the wolves while Stane’s name was barely mentioned at all. Vultures…” he finished angrily.
Jarvis lingered for a while in the background, tidying this and that, his calm manner not fooling Tony for a second. Tony knew Jarvis was worried for him. He always had thought both him and his wife had a soft spot for him, and they had only grown closer after all the misfortunes Tony had had to endure. He knew Jarvis disapproved of him selling the Manor, just as he had known since the moment he had gotten his titles stripped from him -and the last hope he had of restoring credit to his name disappearing with them-, that he would have no other viable alternative but to do so.
Steve could only hang his head in shame. He could never lie to Bucky, and he was tired of denying his feelings for Tony.
It was vastly different to the ancestral property of the Starks, which had ultimately become the grounds for his father’s weapons factory. Tony had only been there twice in his entire life. A land much further south, barren and grey, where the only thing growing was industry. Now, of course, it belonged to someone else.
“He was being unseemly,” Steve defended weakly. He was regretting having the idea of taking a walk after all. Why was it that he was always his worst self when it came to dealing with Tony Stark?
To even consider that Tony wasn’t actually responsible for all the crimes he’d been accused of…It made Steve’s mind reel.
“Right. I… Yes, of course, I can. I will talk to Miss Potts at once,” he replied, his tone business as usual. He got up, gathering his papers close to his chest, and prepared to leave. “Is that all, my lord?”
“Mr Sanders says he saw their contract in the solicitor’s office. It’s written there plainly, for anyone to see! Thomas thinks Stark has been
“I see you came prepared,’ he noted, and if he sounded judgemental well, it was probably because he felt it too.
After Steve left Tony had spent many years acting out against his father. Drinking and gambling away his allowance, not caring at all of the shame he might be bringing to his name. He had been so full of anger and spite against Howard for making him do what he did, for giving him no other choice than to break Steve’s heart
It was heaven on earth. Ecstasy. It was far better than anything Steve had ever felt. In one moment Tony Stark managed to erase all the others that had gotten in Steve’s bed before him. Steve bottomed out and stilled, trying to catch his breath and stop his overwhelmed self from going over the edge. Too late he realized Tony had brought his hands to rest on Steve’s arms and was lightly caressing him. It made fire course through his veins. Like that it was easy for Steve to pretend that Tony really cared for him, that Tony loved him.
“Well, if it isn’t Steve Rogers, out of his gloomy tower at last!” Lady Natalia teased, hooking her delicate arm though his own. She looked lovely as always, in a rather simple -though never plain- white muslin dress. They all gathered around him, and soon went on with their stroll, admiring the gardens. It was clear that, even in the few weeks since they had arrived there, much work had been done in order to get them into a better state. Steve had approved of taking on another gardener and it definitely showed.
Stark was touching Clint’s arm again in an effort to prompt the man to laugh at some joke or another. Shameless, Steve thought again, forcing his head to turn away.
On their way back, Steve tried to engage Mr Hogan in small talk. He was eager to get to know the members of his new household better, now that he had no more guests to entertain. Mr Jarvis and his wife he already knew from his time in the Starks’ service, but the rest he was unfamiliar with.
“I apologize, Tony. I just… I thought… I don’t know what I thought…” he said. He forced his gaze away from Tony’s trembling form. Uncertainty held him back, so Steve decided to retreat and leave Tony be, at least for now. “Forgive me,” he said and left.
“Well, Miss Carter... I couldn’t possibly say no after such a heartfelt plea, now, could I? Alright then, we shall have a ball,” Steve stated, to the utter delight of both Miss Carter and Mrs Dugan and the surprise of everyone else at the table.
He was walking back to his carriage, spirits significantly lifted, when he heard people chattering further down the path. Normally, Steve wouldn’t have paid them any mind, had they not mentioned his name, apparently unaware that the man they were talking about was, in fact, a few feet behind them.
He finished quickly, and entered the lord’s study ready to knock for entrance at the main bedroom, only to find to his surprise that Steve was there, in the study.
He yelped in surprise at the feel of hands grabbing under his armpits and then he was being lifted on the air, Steve getting both of them up in one smooth motion. Dazed, Tony held on to him for dear life as Steve used their momentum to turn and then unceremoniously drop Tony onto the writing desk. Objects went flying to the floor and Tony distantly thought someone must have heard the commotion, but couldn’t really find it in him to care. He ended up on his back, legs hanging over Steve’s shoulders, nightshirt drawn up, barely covering his sensitive nipples as Steve slowly fucked inside him.
Seeing the tray of tea and biscuits in Jarvis’ hands made Steve realise that, with all that had happened, he had completely forgotten about the rest of his guests and if they had had a safe return.
Before Steve could respond, he found himself the focus of Mrs Dugan’s enthusiastic attention. “Oh, but what a wonderful idea you had, Sharon! Isn’t it a great idea, Lord Rogers? It will be such a perfect way to end our trip!” she said, clapping her hands repeatedly as she turned towards Steve expecting an answer.
When the first rays of dawn broke through the curtains, Steve carefully untangled himself from Tony’s embrace and slowly made his way back to his rooms.
Steve spent the entire ride back to the Manor in deep contemplation, greatly troubled by what he had just overheard.
He managed to reach Steve at the top of the hill, where they both stopped and admired the tranquil scenery unfolding before them.
It had been an almost intimate scene. As if he’d caught two lovers just on the brink of a passionate kiss. In that moment, it dawned on Steve that not only was his fear that Tony and Lord Stone were old lovers most likely true, it was entirely possible they had once more rekindled their romance.
To the rest of the world he supposed it would seem as a kind gesture, that he had just been considerate enough not to force Stark to reside with those who had once been his own staff. After all the Lady Rogers wasn’t alive anymore in order for her to occupy them.
In a few to-the-point lines, Bucky informed Steve of his imminent arrival along with Lady Natalia and Mr Banner. He also indicated that during his stay in the capital, he had met with Fury and that the general had given him some new information on a matter Steve had recently inquired about.
The party had moved from the dining room to the music room sometime after being served desert by an ever-diligent Jarvis and staff. Some things were as inevitable as time, Steve supposed. Jarvis being in the service of Stark Manor was one of them.
“Go feed them, you daft boy,” Tony shooed. The boy grinned back while picking up the youngest of the dogs. “Yes, Mr Stark! My lord,” he finished, bowing clumsily to Steve before walking away with the rest of his pack.
Steve regretted somewhat that he hadn’t been able to restrain himself from physically assaulting Lord Stone, even though he had most definitely been baited into doing so. There were too many things at risk here, and Steve needed to act smarter than that.
Steve had been famously widowed five years ago, though the thought of Peggy wasting away from illness still made his heartache to this day. He had met Margaret Carter when he was still but a lieutenant at the army. Her father a general, Peggy was used to travelling with him and her mother despite the dangers being so close to the war held for a woman. They had liked each other from the start and a friendship quickly blossomed between them. They end up getting married after her father passed away and Steve promised to look after her. Both of them had already known heartbreak and in the end, recognizing that ache in one another had been what made them fit. Though their marriage had been based more on mutual affection than love, it still was a time Steve had been happier than not and
After spending a month now living amongst them, he had come to realise that they all had an uncommonly strong attachment to their former master. Then again, while such a thing would be considered uncommon for the rest of the nobility, Tony had always spent his time amongst the servants.
“Oh, don’t look so surprised, dear fellow. I’m sure you two had most of the others fooled… I’m just particularly acquainted with Stark’s methods. And believe me, no one in their right mind would ever fault you for taking advantage of what was right in front of your nose. I know

“Look, who says you’re going to lose touch? That’s why we have mail, Peter!” He tried to cheer him up.
“What a marvellously convenient way to enter, Lord Rogers,” the man noted finally, while his gaze remained focused on the fireplace. “It must have been very useful when you had dear Anthony living here, was it not?”
Tony was pleased that Steve was finally relaxing around him. It had been very confusing for Tony to constantly have to face Steve’s cool dismissal during the day and his fiery, passionate attentions at night. But lately, things had started to get smoother between them.
If there was one thing he did regret about that awful time, it was that he’d let his anger at Howard keep him away from the company for too long, thus blinding him to Obie’s treachery until it was too late.
?” he replied, trying to keep his tone casual. Instead of sitting down, he planted his feet on the floor, refusing to obey orders from someone
Perhaps some of the older onlookers recognized his face, connecting Lord Rogers to the lanky son of the widow Sarah Rogers, and a former servant of the Stark household.
Outside was indeed infinitely better, Steve mused as he walked, satisfied. The fresh breeze was already lifting his sullen mood, nature doing its best to fill his senses with the sweet scents of flowers, the gentle rustling of trees and the warmth of sunbeams caressing his skin. It was a good enough distraction from the unending temptation that Tony in closed spaces -and even shorter distances- presented.
He was dressed in nothing but a loose pale grey nightshirt and Steve’s breath caught at the enticing sight of him, his treacherous heart skipping a beat. Tony Stark always had a handsome face and a striking figure, always gathering the looks and praise of his peers, but somehow seeing him brought down to this, barefoot before him and vulnerable in his almost naked state made something primal inside Steve -some wounded old part of him- roar in approval.
Stark stiffened, nostrils flaring momentarily. Narrowing his eyes, he opened his mouth as if he meant to respond but quickly decided differently. He lowered his gaze, brows furrowed.
Perhaps…no. Tony shifted uncomfortably. Tiberius wouldn’t dare say anything against him, not after everything that had happened the last time Tony had met him. But still, could it be that, somehow, the unfortunate affair with Lord Stone had become public knowledge?
now, really- hunting dogs while the young lad charged with their care watched from the sidelines, occasionally bursting into laughter when one of the dogs would playfully bite at Sir Barton’s backside.
He had already decided that he would not allow himself to feel remorse for what was about to happen. In this room he wouldn’t need to be a gentleman, he would not be Lord Rogers. Here he was allowed to be who he wanted and to do as he desired. To take what he had paid for.
“I worry about you, Stevie. I was there the last time, at least for the aftermath. You barely survived him breaking your heart. I’d hate to see it happen again.”
Finally, Tony seemed to accept the offer, settling carefully over Steve’s willing body once more. It wasn’t long before his breathing slowed and he drifted off to sleep, leaving Steve helpless to resist placing a lingering kiss on his messy dark hair.
Only then did he finally get a real reaction out of Tony. And what a reaction it was. Tony looked both indignant and inescapably beautiful in his outrage, confronting Steve on his own hypocrisy.
They fucked for hours. Tony, though uncharacteristically calm from the start, had been even more pliant after his first climax. It urged Steve to take control of him, own him, the always feisty Tony Stark being fucked to obedience by Steve Rogers, and so he ended up pushing the other man on his hands and knees to claim him once again from behind. He had lost himself to Tony’s silent sighs of pleasure, to his short gasps as he went over the edge and orgasmed, spoiling the sheets with his spent time and time again. They had ended up lying on their sides, back to chest, with Steve holding Tony in his arms and Steve’ spent cock still lingering inside Tony’s enticing warmth, unwilling to let him go, still chasing the illusion of being finally home.
- prepared king-sized bed Steve considered once again how had they ended up at this point. Perhaps all this luxury had been bought with money from the enemy. It made Steve feel a little better for what’s about to take place. At least theirs was an honest exchange.
Realising where they were and what was about to take place there, at an hour when a servant could easily walk in at any point, Tony protested weakly.
“My lord! Back just in time to help us settle the matter once and for all. We’re finally ready to finish the lobby restorations! Now, I told Smith here you’d be perfectly satisfied with oak flooring, but he insists on showing you the mahogany samples he told you about last week,” Tony grinned, greeting him jovially.
In time, their boyish friendship had turned to adolescent infatuation and then swiftly young, tender and passionate love. A love that was as strong as any feeling Tony had ever felt. A love that unfortunately was never meant to be.
Sooner than he’d anticipated, Tony felt Steve pick up his pace, losing rhythm as he moved faster and faster towards bliss. Then he faltered, a muffled “
“Other than me losing everything I’ve ever had, you mean, my lord? What could possibly be worse than that?” he asked, bitterness colouring his voice.
It came as a surprise to Steve how little Mr Coulson had actually changed in all the years that had passed. His hair was a bit thinner, perhaps a little greyer too, but nothing more obvious than that. He was still stoically delivering the word of God to his faithful flock, like the good and proper shepherd he was.
He swallowed Tony’s moans of pleasure hungrily, pushing and pulling at his body until he had him spread on the bed, naked, panting and entirely at Steve’s mercy.
It was an unspoken agreement ever since that first time, that they’d meet every night in the safety of Steve's rooms, after the rest of the household had settled in for the night. Tony would always be the one to come to Steve, knocking discretely on the door, in the off case the Lord Rogers wasn’t alone in his rooms.
Tony was aware he was too old to be clinging to dreams and fantasies. This would have to do. He’d always been willing to give everything up for Steve’s sake, so he would give him this as well. Tony didn’t really mind. He would gladly be Steve’s mistress, his
Who was this man Rhodes to Tony? Why was he so important? Steve’s heart sank the more he mulled over it. The love in Tony’s voice had been evident. If only Tony sounded like that when talking about
He loomed over the fallen form, ready for a fight at any sign of provocation. It didn’t matter anymore that the man before him was a lord, an earl, or even that he was his guest.
Some had to do with the fact that, mentally, in his first months of service, he’d been in a fairly dark place. He had dared to imagine a life with Tony Stark, and to have that taken from him - and in such cruel a manner, too - it had been a hard blow to take.
Steve withdrew to his rooms earlier than usual. Locking himself in his study, Steve sat at the desk, having made up his mind to make his own inquiries on the matter. He knew exactly who to contact, too.
Sensing his master was done with him, Jarvis spoke up. “Indeed, my lord. I shall speak to the cook and arrange for provisions. I will also inform Miss Potts the guest rooms are to be readied.”
He was standing beside the bed, in the nude, one foot on the bed, while the other stood firmly on the floor. He was half turned, and his hand was reaching behind him, to the tempting soft curve of his buttocks, where his fingers disappeared inside his hungry hole. His eyes were shut, fluttering, and he was biting down on his lip as if to keep himself from letting out soft cries of pleasure.
“Perhaps you should be heading back to the house, Mr Stark. Notify Jarvis that we’ll likely be late for lunch. And see to it that Peter has my horse ready for this afternoon, will you? I think I want to go for a ride,” he all but ordered.
“It’s not his fault, my lord! My aunt May always says I’m too distracting!” Peter spluttered, hurrying to get to his work.
“More, Steve…please…” Tony exclaimed, his whole body shivering. His hands clenched Steve’s arms, hard enough to leave bruises.
Steve, of course, had dressed accordingly, ever the military man, while Tony had only donned a light riding coat on his way to the stables, perhaps subconsciously refusing to leave behind the summer for the dreary autumn, just like his stubborn heart refused to let Steve go, while Steve had long ago grown out of his love with him.
How many times had Steve touched that hidden token of Tony’s hair, knowing he would never be able to touch the head it belonged to? Believing with all his heart that the man who had given it to him was lost, a traitor, or worse, had never been real to begin with?
Back in the safety of his rooms, Steve took the box out once again and regarded it, deep in thought, mindful of anyone -mainly Tony himself- coming in and seeing him holding it.
“What on earth are you doing, Stark!” he said, crumpling the letter hastily into a ball. “Have you not heard of the concept of privacy?” he finished, irritated.
“Oh, I’m sure he does. Well... I should get going now, Tony. It’s getting late and both of us have to get up earlier than dawn.”
In truth Steve, back then, had thought Stane dead long ago, like Lord Howard, so to learn otherwise was indeed disturbing news.
“You asked for me, my lord?” Jarvis inquired, after Steve gave him leave to enter the study. Steve had been waiting for the butler to arrive for quite some time after sending his man to get him, and he had started to become annoyed by the delay. Tony had left the bedroom early that morning, before Steve had been truly awake to greet him good day, only to then get distracted doing some chore on Miss Potts’ behalf, and Steve had been in a foul mood ever since.
They panted, breathing into each other’s mouths as they came down from the ecstasy of their intense coupling.
They had been married for little more than three years before she’d passed away, taken by a brief illness.
“I missed you, all morning,” he said, finally. Tony turned to look at him, a frown marring his handsome features.
“Nothing, my lord,” he dismissed, embarrassed. He tried to regain his composure. It was decidedly unfair that Steve had such an effect on him, while he seemed completely calm and in control when Tony was around. Well. Mostly.
Some of it, though, was just that war hit Steve hard. It had been a difficult lesson for someone of Steve’s persistent character to learn that there were things he couldn’t control, people he couldn’t save and battles he couldn’t win, no matter how valiantly he fought.
“I would say well met, Mr Coulson, but, as I am sure you are well aware, this is far from our first meeting,” Steve responded, taking Coulson’s hand in a firm handshake.
He had no patience to undress, just paused for a moment to get his cock out and then he was on the bed again, kneeling between Tony’s spread legs. He tugged at them, pulling the tempting body closer, bending those graceful knees so far back that Tony was almost folded in half. He aligned himself with the well-prepared hole and slowly pushed his cock inside, inch by inch.
“I would suggest the grey one, my lord,” he said, holding up the jacket in question in front of the mirror for Tony to take.
It was as if something was forming in his subconscious, something that he couldn’t yet see, but was there all the same. And now, this. Just what was the relationship between Tony and this Mr Rhodes?
“It can wait,” Steve said, feeling strangely guilty not coming to Tony’s aid when the man had clearly meant for him to do so.
Steve watched as both Miss Carter and Mrs Dugan deflated at that admonishment. At the other end of the table, Lord Stone smirked for the first time that night, apparently enjoying Steve’s obvious discomfort.
Steve had been too preoccupied with musing over Fury’s letter to realise how late it was, certainly later than the usual time Tony made his appearance, until he heard the muted sound of a cry, followed by the muffled thump of something falling. Remembering Tony’s earlier injury, he didn’t hesitate, jumping to his feet and making his way through the adjoining study to Tony’s room, scared of what he might find there.
“You are your own man, Steve. I pray to God you know what you’re doing.” He got up, walking up to Steve to place a conciliatory hand on his shoulder. A moment later he withdrew.
Steve always thought that vegetable gardens had a special, useful kind of beauty. To someone who had experienced hunger, a place that grew food when properly tended was almost magical. It had been one of Steve’s favourite chores, back when he was still working for the Starks, to help Anna tend to her vegetable garden.
Nothing lasted forever as Tony had painfully learned. And, as his father used to say, Stark men were made of iron. They endured.
Steve felt a burning rage upon hearing Stone speaking so flippantly about the things that he held so dear, of all his efforts to keep the Stark estate from ruin. At the same time, he knew that Stone raised a very true point. Too much was at stake over this deal.
“So… this is where you’ve been hiding all afternoon, Mr Stark,” Barnes asked, startling him out of his book. Tony must have lost time, if he’d been absent long enough for it to be noticed. Ever since he was a boy he had found refuge in the library and its vast collection of literature. Of course, back then the only thing Tony wanted to avoid was his father’s lectures.
The guests were soon guided by Jarvis to the dining room for lunch, with only Tony remaining behind, gathering his notes and papers from the transaction.
He heard Bucky murmur something under his breath before he turned to look at Steve, gaze speculating. Steve suddenly felt unnerved.
“Don’t be absurd, Lord Rogers. Sit down. Or have you forgotten that I have yet to sign your precious little deal, hmm?” he replied drily, and Steve once more stopped in his tracks.
Steve just couldn’t get enough of him, even if most nights Tony ended up falling asleep in his arms.
Tony had a strong feeling he was being made fun off. It wasn’t a nice feeling, but he swallowed it down, wanting this conversation to be over.
“How do you always manage to get yourself into situations like this, Steve?” Bucky said, shaking his head. “I should never have left you here on your own. You’ve never thought clearly when it came to Stark.”
Tony’s eyes were glistering in the candlelight. Steve kept his gaze fixed on them as he once again grabbed Tony’s hips and lifted him with little difficulty before lining himself with the oil dripping hole and slowly pushing in.
He could scarcely make sense of what he had seen. Instinctively, his heart told him that, whatever it was, it wasn’t good. But Steve’s heart had betrayed him in the past, especially where Tony Stark was concerned, so he had learned not to trust it that easily.
“Fury was adamant that Stark took the fall for crimes he did not commit, or even have knowledge of. It was a set-up. Only it was discovered too late. The damage to the Stark Company and to Lord Stark’s reputation couldn’t be undone, and Obadiah Stane and his associates had long disappeared without a trace,” Bucky said, shaking his head. They were in one of the smaller parlours, one of the most secluded places Steve had found in the manor. Tea had been served not long ago, and Steve had given specific instructions not to be disturbed.
Steve was becoming less and less sure about everything he thought he’d known about his and Tony’s tumultuous past. Ever since he had talked with Mr Coulson about Lord Howard, Steve couldn’t shake the troubling feeling that he was missing something vital, some piece of information that would explain it all.
Hogan was a simple man, kind but not overly smart, though very dedicated to his work. He had been a coachman first, but after the master got into heavy debt and had been forced to let some of the staff go, he’d had begun to work as a gardener and a gamekeeper too, in order to help with the upkeep of the estate. He was happy to prattle as they made their way up the hillside.
But then again this situation was as far from marriage as one could get. This was a business deal. It was carnal desire, it was a transaction.
It was close to dawn, sometime after they had both gotten too tired to continue when Tony finally got up, redressed and silently exited the room the same way he had entered, all under Steve’s half-asleep gaze.
I'm back, baby! And this time with two betas now no less! So let me just thank my amazing betas EachPeachPearPlum and Lacrimula_Falsa for helping me out with this chapter. Love you guys ❤️
It was so easy for Tony to forget in the throes of ecstasy that for Steve, this was all just sating his carnal desires. Such struggle for him not to imagine there was more to Steve’s passion than pure lust.
“What was that for, Steve?” she hissed. “I swear, you are such a child sometimes. Did you have to be so rude to him?”
“Not an issue. Are you feeling well? We did manage to get soaking wet out there, earlier,” Steve inquired and Tony had to once more remind himself that Steve was asking over his health only because it was the polite thing to do.
“Thank you, my lord. A nice contraption, isn’t it? It needs but the barest amount of effort to lift a full bucket of water. Even a child as young as five could do it.”
Steve sighed, turning the key to unlock the box. The mechanism clicked and the top sprang open. Steve’s fingers hesitated for a moment, caressing the worn edges of a heart carved on one of the sides.
He turned back and almost ran straight into Jarvis. The butler masterfully avoided the collision with a quick side-step. “My lord,” he greeted Steve, seemingly unfazed.
It was one thing for him to admit to himself that he had behaved shamefully towards Tony; it was an entirely different matter for a man such as Stone to be rubbing Steve’s own failings in his face.
Of course, Steve had conveniently chosen to ignore the fact that he was guilty of the same impropriety where Tony was concerned. He found comfort in the knowledge Tony Stark was anything but helpless. For God’s sake, Tony had been the one to propose this whole thing to Steve! Steve knew enough of society to not be foolish enough to think that this was Tony’s first time using his body as a means to an end. In the right hands, trading in desire was a weapon more powerful than any other on market. It had brought down empires and built kingdoms.
“Please, my lord?” Sharon’s gentle voice brought him back from his musings. “It would be such a perfect way to end this wonderful trip,” she said, looking at him with wide eyes.
not to feel jealous of a ghost. Whoever she might have been, Margaret Rogers was long gone, and to think ill of the dead was considered bad luck, even by sceptics like himself. But Tony had always been known for failing rather than succeeding at most of his endeavours, and, naturally, this one wasn’t an exception.
“No, dear man, that part where you said something about Lord Howard’s old business partner? Stane, was it?”
They were both locked in place for what felt like hours, until Steve took notice that Tony’s fingers were still moving slowly inside his hole.
The one positive aspect of Steve’s insatiable desire of Tony’s body, was that each passing night it was getting easier for him to prepare himself for Steve’s use. His muscles had relaxed and his hole stretched wider every time. Tony had felt a burning shame the first time he’d realised it.
for imported marble? At this day and age, with this economy? It’s absurd! Anyway, what is wrong with using a local stone?” he exclaimed rather dramatically. He saw Steve roll his eyes at Tony’s antics.
“My dear, Lord Rogers already showed us such generous hospitality, you should know better than to press him for such a thing…” Dugan tutted disapprovingly at his wife’s antics. “Please forgive her, my friend. You’ve provided so much for us already, there is no need for such frivolities.”
If you questioned Steve's endless pacing for nervousness, he would instantly deny it. He and Tony had been dating for four years now, of course he wasn't nervous! He obviously had no reason too, right? Right?! The blond started tugging at his hair before settling on the old workshop couch. He took the small box out of his pocket. He opened it up gently, looking longingly at the ring. It was made of white gold with a blue sapphire in centre.
The handsome dorito smiled at the thought. Its Tony, not some stranger. Not Ironman, the hero. Not Anthony Edward Stark, the celebrity. Steve was going to propose to Tony. Tony was his rock after the ice. His distraction. His crush. His closest friend. Tony. A fierce, smol, and strong willed man, with a heart of gold.
“Also, I’m currently in no condition to scream at you for those burnt marks and cuts, and so I want you to know that we’re having a discussion about that.”
Suddenly he felt as if he had forgotten something. He just wasn't sure of what. The man shrugged, if he didn't remember it couldn't be too important. It had been snowing all day and it really showed. It looked as if someone had ordered white carpets and placed them everywhere. It was raining too. Not much, really, but enough to make the chill air feel even colder.
The women's dialogue was  stressed words, mixed with fast and unsteady breathing. Steve attempted to not panic. Tony is strong willed, and smart, knows basic physical training, is the most stubborn person Steve has ever met, he’s not someone to underrate.
“One, you still get hurt and feel actual pain. Two, you can't pull the super soldier card, every time you get hurt.” Tony was more careful with his voice as he answered, keeping it lower, and using more time to form the words.
The brunet hands bloody, filthy with soot, and shaking. The warm red liquid a perfect contrast to the stark white snow. The failed attempts only seemed to drain the man of what little energy he had left.
Steve felt numb. All the yelling and voices in the background had gotten so very quiet. There were no conversation, no yelling, just sirens. Everything was still until a horrified scream pierced through his over sensitive ears. The little boy. The child that still believed his favourite hero would be fine. Steve didn't feel anything, couldn't comprehend. This obviously wasn't happening. This obviously wasn't real. This obviously couldn't happen.
With a sigh the brunet started walking. He could take a cab, but the restaurant was only a few minutes away by foot. The meeting had been annoying, and slightly stressfull, it would be nice to take a walk to clear his head. Tony had survived worse, and really a little rain was nothing to worry about.
It was getting louder, and more understandable. A woman was yelling about a boy? A child was “still in the building”, apparently? What building, he wondered. What was happening? He couldn't see shit with the snowy/Rainy wind covering his line of vision. Other than the yells of help, he was clueless. Then he finally got it. It smelled of thick smoke.
He was jumping over debris, sometimes just running straight through pieces of the building. Fuck having a plan. Fuck patience, he needed Tony.
Tony grabbed onto a steady looking piece of something grey to support himself and immediately regretted it. Fuck! He thought, when the literally flaming hot metal burned his hand. His eyes was spread wide in surprise and shock, it bloody hurt! Tony nodded his head and shook his hand profusely. He needed to wake up and focus for this. The inventor stared at the piece of metal as some of the mental cobwebs burned itself to dust. It's the second time he burns himself on that! He gave the piece of what was most likely steel, a look. Tony made himself take a thin and shallow breath as he started waking up a little more. Steve's voice hasn't been very loud which meant he would most likely be some distant away from Tony, meaning the brunet would have to signalize back to the blond.
"I literally hate you right now, you know?" Steve blurted, still hiding his embarrassed face into his hand.
Steve smiled and held him a pack of stickers. "Everything personal goes into the boxes. Green stickers for what goes into the penthouse. Blue for what I'm giving away. Red for what stays here."
He explained in a soft smile, "if that's not dumping, then what is it?" He didn't wait for Steve's answer and sighed. "But whatever, I guess I deserved that." He concluded.
Obie let out a lewd moan as he thrust into his throat. "Mmmh. I like your enthusiasm, boy." He said while his hand delicately cupped his jaw and pushed him away. "but I won't be able to hold it in if you keep going like this."
Steve was having a hard time focusing on what was being said, with the loud and accelerating beating of his heart. He glanced at his boyfriend, who glanced back at him, the corner of his mouth curled up into a sly smile.
Steve's hand was clammy in his own and Tony squeezed it protectively. From this moment on, he takes the lead and shows Steve the basics before leading him to the small dancing space next to their table. Steve feels awkward and clumsy at first. He trembles a little, nervous and unsure but Tony holds him firmly against him and swirls him around skillfully until he completely relaxes in his arm. Tony can feel his heart settle and the soothing appeased omega scent envelop him like a protective blanket. They're alone in the world. alone in their nest and Tony has never been so happy before.
clearly is on the list of things I would have never done in hindsight." He mutters softly. "I'm so sorry." He adds.
Bucky wanted Steve to move back into his old apartment floor. He suggested to move out with Felicia. It broke Steve's heart to force them out. He was fine just anywhere in this tower. As long as he was back home, with the pack, and close to Tony. He just settled down in one of the guest apartment.
"So if I understood well," Clint decided to intervene, "you two met because I asked Steve to cover for my shift." He explained, down-to-earth, and then added with a huge grin. "I'm so happy I've been a part of this."
He was out of it when his boyfriend insulted him, mostly. Although Steve's words hurt more than any blow Tony had ever received from anyone.
"So, you are denying that, as many of your followers suggest and believe, you are Captain America and Tony Stark is Iron Man?"
Bucky pushed him so brutally he stumbled. He didn't get the time to protest about it before being manhandled like a puppet and dragged outside on the lawn toward their favorite eating spot, under the willow tree.
"How long have you been waiting outside?" Steve asked softly, his voice coming out a little hoarse. Maybe the lump in his throat or the warmth he felt about touching Tony, or his heart beating so fast he could feel it in his temples.
They kept fucking his face alternately, thrusting brutally and relentlessly into his throat, until the pain in his throat became a constant and increasing burn. They pulled his hair, hard, and each time they changed places, Tony was slapped and spat on until his head was spinning and his vision got blurry. As a principle, and because he had been well trained, he swallowed everything that came into his mouth eagerly. The slapping had started soft but the brutality of it escalated as the three men really got into it. Then the kicks started, on his thighs and then on his crotch. The sharp pain sudden and agonizing, followed by the adrenaline rush. It might have felt like pleasure for a second or two but everything got mixed up and confusing in Tony's head, right now. He was too fucked-up and wasted. He had given up control and let the men manhandle him without any resistance at all. He wasn't in any capacity to do anything else, nor did he want to. He wanted them to hit harder. He wanted them to punch his face until he passed out, until his nose broke. He wanted to bleed. He wanted them to kick him in the ribs until he couldn't breathe anymore. He wanted them to break his knees. He wanted to fall asleep and never wake up.
Tony looked up and hated himself because his eyes were probably pleading right now, and his jaw was trembling, but he couldn't help himself. "I can't." He whispered, words almost stuck in his throat.
people but Steve, you could read him like an open book and he remained a complete mystery to me..." He paused, seemingly lost in his memories, the corners of his mouth quirked up into a gentle smile. Something adorable pooled in his expression.
That's when Jane came back and curled around her lover's shoulders, burying her head in the crook of his neck. She kissed behind his ear and Thor imperceptibly shivered when she did. "That's because I thought you weren't serious."
Tony jerked his head up toward him, heart racing in his chest. He felt out of his own body again, unable to control it anymore, and saw his own smile die down on his lips while he felt powerless. He bit his own lips, lost, trying to find a way to reach out to him, only he kept failing spectacularly. The distance between them right now was so palpable, so painfully real.
"Oh, these go as well..." Steve deadpanned. Tony jerked his head up and turned another pair of confused eyes to him. Steve just shrugged. "I've already taken care of it with Pepper. She's gonna put them for auction. For the Maria Stark Foundation..."
His heart fluttered, his mind was on cloud nine. Steve had never ever pictured what was actually happening to him right now. He was still floating in the air, surely his heart had flown away with the butterflies in his stomach.
Tony did smile at the joke for a moment—Steve is a little shit—and wondered how the Omega could have managed to draw his pouty face so well on a doodle but then Captain America's position, though innocent in that drawing, reminded him too much of why they were all miserable. Maybe that was Steve ironizing about the situation, and frankly, knowing him that wouldn't be a surprise, but in the end, all he felt was an acute pain in his chest.
Steve brushed his thumb on his boyfriend's cheek. "Sorry." He whispered, but he was not sorry at all.
"I've hated being omega. And yes, it used to enrage me this fucked-up situation that we're in but it's time we accept who we are, Tony. It's time for
The good thing was that he didn't need to make a choice anymore because someone else did it for him. He saw a black limo—not his dad's—pull up in front of him and stared at it blankly. The door opened on its own and the man gave him a gentle look, smirking a little. "Get in."
Dinner passed by woefully and Tony soon realized no-one cared that he was there or not. He didn't even have it in him to be resentful. He just wanted to get the fuck away from there as soon as possible. Perhaps he could sneak out discreetly. He kept staring at his phone, of course no sign from Steve would magically appear on his screen but he couldn't help looking at the time. It was still early... and a sudden sliver of hope brightened Tony's evening. Perhaps he could still make it. Without the flowers, sure, but he still had his charms and his cute apologetic smile for himself and for one, he was actually looking really great in his dark grey tuxedo. Going was still better than not going anyway and if Steve told him to fuck off then, well, at least he would have tried.  Even mad Steve and his pack of spiteful friends would be better company than his current one.
The problem was that journalists started to get intrigued by his theories and made research and one of them had published a very detailed article that compared Steve's personal life with the different plots in his series with disturbingly accurate concordance. On obvious things as much as on very subtle details.
"Yeah, I need to do something about this... Can't let you ruin all those months of effort. JARVIS?" He shouted out toward the ceiling. "I need to know where Tony hides his fail-safe packs of cigarette and get rid of them urgently, it's a matter of health. Will you help me with that?"
Worthy of a life..." His last words were whispered almost inaudibly. "Like I wasn't a mistake." Steve's heart sank in his chest and he tightened his embrace, nuzzling against him. "I used to break in there, you know?" Steve knew. Had happened more often than not. His boyfriend had always had a peculiar notion of boundaries... "When you weren't there. When you—Even when you didn't want anything to do with me anymore...."
And it suddenly occurred to him. Were they really a couple? Were they invested enough in this relationship? What he was feeling... Was it real? Or was it an illusion created by the absence and the sexual frustration? Would they be happy if things were different? Would they last in other circumstances? They only saw each other for the best moments after all.
Tony giggled. "I do listen and I do everything you want. I'm very obedient." He said in husky sexy voice.
series—one of the creepiest too, bordering on stalker. He dedicated his entire life to decrypt Steve's artwork in every detail and published his discoveries on his Youtube channel.
Anyway, Tony was here and he couldn't really see his face yet but he recognized his charming demeanor and his confident voice. He was dressed casually but smart and very recognizable. Steve felt his heart racing. He was annoyed, he wouldn't lie, but there was also a small part of him that relished in feeling the butterflies flutter in his stomach. He repressed a grin.
Tony lasted but five minutes before he came into the omega's ass and knotted him on his knees, right the floor, on that very spot he's been kneeling down, submitting to him.
In truth, he didn't know exactly how he felt about that. The idea that Tony Stark had come to his rescue was quite a nice thought to have. And yet something bothered him about it. Some misplaced pride, perhaps. Steve might be on the short side—and currently being bullied by half the school—but he was no damsel in distress. And the fact that someone like Tony Stark, who was definitely not known for his empathetic tendencies would come and rescue him seemed to say a lot about his ability to defend himself. And he felt a little pathetic, beside feeling hot all over.
"That's not nice." Clint protested sulkily. "I thought you were really hot the first time I saw you. It's only when you opened your mouth that I realized how much of an asshole you were."
Tony was already rummaging through the box anyway. Among the bottles of poppers, the dildos of all shapes and sizes, the ball gag, etc, he picks up a big plastic jar containing a slimy translucent lubricant that he knows exactly the use for. He opens it and takes some in his hand, looking at the substance as the sticky thing shines and slides down his fingers. He giggles again. "Guys? I'll never look at you the same way." Clint glances at him again and smothers a laugh. He lets escape a soft chuckle anyway. He must be pretty stoned too, Tony thinks. He puts the jar and all the toys back into the box and lies down on the bed next to his friend, feeling the reassuring warmth of him. "Okay, I don't even wanna know who's using that on who..."
Tony nodded, happy to be done with the uncomfortable conversation. They turned around, starting a slow trot back towards home. They had nearly made it to the stables when the rain finally caught up with them and it started pouring hard enough to force them to make a run for it.
Steve smiled weakly, having been caught completely off guard. He had stopped following the ladies’ conversation fairly early on, and couldn’t possibly figure out what he was supposed to say.
“I am listening, my lord,” Jarvis replied, stoically, though Steve thought he detected disapproval in the older man’s features.
Steve hesitated. “Yes... he mentioned something of the sort. He also told me he had made a few donations?”
Tony, still stunned and unwilling to disappoint a man who he’d known all his life and loved almost like a father, just smiled and pretended it was all true.
Still, Steve supposed his friends had been -rightly- surprised by Stark’s presence among them. After all, most of them only knew Stark as the fallen from grace dandy aristocrat that had barely managed to escape treason charges, losing all his fortune and holdings in the process. All but this very estate which he had after some years ended up selling for scraps.
Tony turned in Steve’s arms in response, bringing his head up to answer Steve’s call with a tired, sloppy kiss. Steve took a deep breath through his nose, loving the gift of Tony’s enticing scent.
“Splendid, yes. Oh, and Jarvis. If you please… I would like to inform Mr Stark of this myself,” he finished, looking at the old butler expectantly.
Steve found himself torn. On the one hand, he desperately wanted to follow Tony, make sure he was alright, ask him what had occurred just moments past, and on the other, he realised he had to talk to, if not outright confront, Lord Stone about it.
Peter headed first to Steve, taking his horse after the man had dismounted, while Tony waited patiently for his turn. To Tony’s surprise, though, as soon as Steve’s feet touched the ground he started moving towards him. He held his arms out in a familiar gesture that had Tony flummoxed.
, Steve had thought fate was done with him and that he would never have to experience that kind of pain ever again.
So, there it was again, back in his chest, that clenching, burning sensation of pure rage and desperation, the urge to strike back, to hurt those who hurt him. It flared into life when Steve saw Lord Stone’s hands on Tony’s delicate frame, even though it was for just a few moments, before his presence forced the man to take a step back. He didn’t look at all happy with the interruption.
Steve closed his eyes, willing the headache this inner turmoil had brought away. His mind drifted, thinking of better, happier times.
“I swear, you are begging for a beating,” Tony breathed out angrily and made to finally get the dog’s leash. As he moved, he failed to notice some of the fallen debris on the floor.
“When you came to me in town,” he said, his voice hesitating as if unsure whether he was allowed to mention
“An excellent shot, my lord,” the man, Hogan, said, panting as he made his way to Steve. He was holding the rest of their game, another duck and a pheasant, as well as the rest of Steve’s gear. Steve hummed in agreement.
Rogers, now,” one of them, a middle-aged, annoying-looking woman in a huge hat adorned with green lace, said. “And so dashing to boot!”
But no, Tony’s responsiveness to Steve’s touches, the hunger in his eyes, those surely couldn’t have been forced. No, at least that must be real. At least, Steve desperately hoped it was.
“What you do to me,” Steve whispered in his mouth. He nipped at Tony’s neck, while both of them struggled at each other’s clothes, searching for skin.
“To your left, Mr Stark!” Peter yelled as the dog let out a mournful howl and jumped over one of the occasional tables, knocking down a porcelain vase.
It was a sobering statement, and it made Steve wonder. He had never really known Lord Howard. Whatever he’d learned about the man had been from the things the other servants - or Tony, sometimes - said about him. But he had always believed Howard to be a fair man. Hard, but fair.
The building itself was a simple but charming cottage. It was situated on top of a hill not five miles from the village and surrounded by green pastures and well-tended fields. Animals happily grazed on the grass while the laughter of children filled the air even from afar.
Now, after all the years Steve had spent thinking ill of Tony, the thought that he’d actually been mistaken, that he had, all this time, been as misinformed about Tony as the gossips he overheard today was gnawing at Steve’s already heavy conscience.
The thing was that it was his best friend’s wedding and said friend had chose him as his best man (a total surprise if you asked Tony about it), the runner-up was Bucky Barnes, childhood friend and brother-in-arms, so Steve picking Tony left the man out of depth.
That was the reason why he called Mr. Rogers, Mr. Rogers, he sometimes slipped in his mind a called him Steve, but never out of it. Not even when his own boss asked to call by his name.
It did take Mr. Rogers two days to notice Darcy’s presence, and another day to know why she was there.
“Okay, I will post an advertisement and we find a candidate I will send them your way to begin training, if that is okay with you?”
When he decided to send the package he didn’t think more of it, really, Steve didn’t expect anything from Tony, he just wanted to say sorry for not telling him the true about his parents death; however, he was not sorry for not signing the Accords, for not compromising his beliefs, his values, his dignity as citizen of the USA, for not renouncing to his freedom. Yes, Steve regretted that all finished like that and his teammates had to choose between them, that the rest decided to sign and left them.
His boss bided farewell to his date with a smile and a chaste kiss in the cheek of the woman, that somehow surprised Tony but he just marked it as another eccentricity of his boss.
He wanted to be next to his lover again, fighting side by side, he would have liked to take that olive branch, but Tony’s methods were still wrong and Steve forgot to trust him. If he did that to Wanda, what would he do to Bucky?
Tony knew that they were more memories than other thing, some of them with macabre twist. But undeniable all of his nightmares held a hint of true in them, and that was what made them more horrible.
But he won’t return, his proud doesn’t permit it and also it is his dream, his own company out of the shadow of Howard Stark.
Because when her husband decided of something he would do it and nobody could change his mind. That was how Natasha came to their life. She didn’t regret that decision yet.
“You will be good, Darcy is a competent PA and I will do an excellent job” Tony said with false enthusiasm, “You will not notice that I left”
with you, I have been in love with you for years and now you’re getting married and I being selfish but I’ve to tell you and I’m sorry but I can be your best man because this is killing me; maybe with time I’d be your friend again but I can stay for this” Tony rambled and felt his eyes dampening, “I can see you getting married to someone else”
So he sent Tony a cellphone and a letter, Steve didn’t know if Tony would ever call or would read the latter, Tony could have just throw it away; but Steve wanted to think that at the very least Tony would keep the phone and consider his words. He was a good man, even if Tony himself didn’t believe so. Steve could believe for both of them.
It was tiring and sometimes frustrating, but when his boss smiled at him at a work well done, it was worthy. Mr. Rogers’ smile could light up an entire city. He was a perfectionist, so he kind of received a lot of those ¾they didn’t help with his crush, they’re worsen it.
He left HHRR lighter and guilty, in part this was the next step to reach his dream but in another it was difficult to him to accept the idea that he wouldn’t see Mr. Rogers in daily basis anymore, and after yesterday ‘s talk, Tony felt worried about how his boss would take the notice.
“That won’t be necessary” Steve refused glazing fondly at Buddy, for a second Tony felt jealous, but it was Buddy so Tony understood the fond. “It was more that, um Buddy? Found me.”
However, there is something so horribly wrong with this image, because if it’s Tony’s left wrist, where is his name? The image shows a wrist free of a soulmate mark.
Steve didn’t understand why they’ve chose those convoluted politics but he respected their choice, at least they believed in their cause and he was sure that even if now they respond to another they would still save people. That was their real work…to protect the little guy.
Pepper liked to see them from a far; she was more a cat person. Tony didn’t mind her, he himself liked cats a little bit more, but those puppies make him loved them…preferences did not matter.
He took the two tiny bodies in his arms and tried to shell them with his jacket until they reached home.
It could be that they can finally talk. He closes the door and doesn’t waste a moment to check the message.
, is there because of him, no, it’s because the spot Steve has put them all with his unwillingness to hear, his tunnel vision with all Barnes’ related, he put them all in risk for a single man.
He was shouted by an obnoxious member of the Board of Directors, the man forgot that it was tomorrow the appoint for his date with Mr. Rogers, and begun to shout at him saying it was his mistake, because he told his assistant to make his appointment for today. At the end of the tirade of insults and threats from the other man, Mr. Rogers came out of his office after hearing the scandal, the member of the Board begun telling his tale again and insulting Tony.
If he slept no more than five hours being lucky a day, well, it was another thing, besides is not like he slept a lot, MIT trained him for this kind of job, his binges in the laboratories were legendries.
They had an opportunity, it was time for them to fight back…together as they must have been since the beginning. Well at least the few of them that remain.
He is furious, with himself and with Steve, but self-deprecation still works and he hates himself a little bit more; because Tony could have prevented it, or at least he could have tried harder to make Steve listen.
Tony sighed and pressed his nasal septum in order to prevent the headache that this conversation was causing him. He observed Everett Ross who was sitting in front of him trying to see what was his game; Tony didn’t have the opportunity to know more about the man during well what the Government had denominated ‘Civil War’, he just knew that the man ¾lawyer whatever he was¾ was the liaison and principal interrogator in the case against Barnes. Though, FRIDAY discovered an interesting connection of the man with Wakanda.
Not that Tony believed that he would actually return, usually after a date Mr. Rogers didn’t return to the company, and Tony didn’t like to thing why he did not.
Then someone took him at the elbow stopping his escape, the action made that his body collide with the other person making possible for them to hold him.
So Tony found himself catching a glimpse of his boss date, an stunning brunet with red lips; the kind of woman that seemed perfect for Mr. Rogers, not the usual bimbo, no this woman looked like someone efficient and in perfect control of herself and whatever else she wanted, she had a pair of intelligent brown eyes bright with wit and sense, also she had a nicely shaped body…but Tony doubts that was the reason that Mr. Rogers was dating that woman.
Also there was a high chance that Steve was Bucky Barnes’ lover. James Buchanan Barnes who was Tony’s partner in the MIT’s laboratory, or more exactly his charge since he was the graduate student supervising that lab ¾ironic, they put in charge someone who wasn’t interested in leading or having more responsibilities¾, but he didn’t like all that formalism, so all the undergraduates were buddies (
Aunt Peggy taught him how to shot and present himself in front of others, about how to be brave and never let something like sex or social condition or whatever media picked up to hate, define him or construct his judgment towards someone else. Peggy Carter told him about being a woman in men’s territory, in trusting your instincts and choices, but hearing advice when given. Though, he was not really good with the advice thing.
Steve Rogers was handsome ¾Tony is sure that he mentioned that once or twice before¾ and that apparently means that he is a playboy, or at least he was always accompanied by a beautiful girl or boy. Sometimes they last months, but the average was weeks if they are lucky.
But maybe Pepper’s words had a ring of true in them. Could be why this damn fight hurt too much for being simple friends.
She felt remorse like few things in her life made her feel. She wondered if telling him the true would have change something in all this debacle, that following Steve request of not telling Tony about what Zola said about the death of his parents was the right decision. Because at the end it was a petition from a person that she considered a friend, from someone of their team that she didn’t trust…at that moment there weren’t a lot of people she could confide not after discovering HYDRA in SHIELD.
“What I told Johnson this noon was true, I wouldn’t last a day without you, Tony” Mr. Rogers said sincerely, “I was embarrassed when I didn’t find my wallet and I couldn’t leave Peggy foot the bill since I was the one who invited her, you really save me”
“Yes we need regulations, but we don’t agree in your proposals” Tony nearly shouted caching himself in time, he needed to control his temper; he didn’t want to fall in their stinky hands.
“Tony” Steve’s smile was breathtaking like all the smiles the man always gave to Tony, “You too mister”
So he keeps the phone with him all the time since he sent the package, Steve won’t forgive himself if Tony calls and he doesn’t answer.
In the days following the arrival of Lord Rogers and his party, life in Stark Manor settled in its new rhythms. During the day, Tony worked as Steve’s personal secretary. He was tasked with answering the Lord’s official correspondence, reviewing the estate's finances -abysmal-, helping to pay off the creditors and working out a plan for the much-needed maintenance of the main house. All in all, he was being kept very busy.
Peter hanged his head. “I’m sorry for bothering you with this, Mr Stark. I know I’m being a nuisance. Betsy says I need to be more of a man. She says that real men wouldn’t get sad over silly things like their best friends moving away. Life moves on, she says.”
They ate in relative silence, with Jarvis and the servants around them at a polite distance. Tony couldn’t help but steal glances at Steve as he ate, observing the precise moves and impeccable manners, a stark contrast to what he had known of the man in the past.
“You need to appoint a new architect for that pavilion you are obsessed with, my lord,” Tony exclaimed, having just finished reading through the day’s correspondence.
drawing the beauty of mother nature, don’t you deny it! You thought I wouldn’t notice, but nothing gets past me.” Steve grinned at him, and Tony just had to add, “You always
Steve could see Tony’s mouth twitching in mirth, his gaze following her body with rapt interest. It was the final straw for Steve.
He really couldn’t come up with anything. He and Steve rarely talked about anything other than their work during the day, and as for the nights…well, there wasn’t really room for talking then…
Bucky shot him a concerned glance before he continued. “There’s more that Fury isn’t telling us, that much I can tell you for certain. That man’s secrets have secrets.”
Steve went entirely still. The army captain inside him recognized that Stone was simply trying to get a reaction out of him, but he couldn’t help that unnerving feeling that Stone was merely stating facts.
Steve didn’t want to let Tony go, but he was beginning to understand that perhaps he just might have to, for both their sakes.
Later that day, after they finished with Mr Smith’s surprisingly large collection of flooring samples, Jarvis served the both of them tea in one of the reading rooms. Making small talk, Tony asked Steve what news he’d brought from the village. After Steve mentioned Mr Coulson’s shelter for single mothers, he was once more surprised when he was met with Tony’s approving exclamations of gratitude.
The signing of the railway agreement took place in the library, so that every interested party, from the representatives and members of the Midland Railway Company to Steve’s own solicitor and even the ladies of their company, could attend. Tony had presented them with the finalised document - and two spare copies - which everyone took turns to inspect.  After Steve had laid down his signature, both Mister Carruthers and Lord Stone needed to do so on behalf of the Company’s board of directors for the document to be valid. Then, it was done. The people gathered clapped politely, the notary collected the copies to be taken back to his office for filling, and Steve could finally breathe again.
Tony had stopped trying to change the older man’s mind after a while, knowing he would never win that particular battle.
After introductions and a short tour of the place, Steve found himself walking through the cottage’s vegetable garden in the company of Mr Coulson, while the rest of his company had scattered to explore the grounds.
All of Tony’s actions, from the moment Steve had set eyes on him again to the last time he’d seen him, not an hour ago in the dining room, spoke only of a good-natured character and a brilliant, playful mind. He showed great care for others and a willingness to enjoy life in general.
A ball, even a small one, at such short notice, would be a nightmare for his staff. Jarvis and Miss Potts would need all available hands in order to pull it off.
When Steve entered the billiard room, he half-expected to find Lord Stone where he’d left him, but instead, the room was empty of any presence whatsoever.
“Oh, yes, my lord! Well, it’s only that he departed so suddenly that he left many of his belongings back in the house! After some time the master said we could take whatever we wanted. I got my finest shirt that day!” he exclaimed proudly. “I never trusted the man, I tell ya. How
He had studiously ignored the sorrow that filled his heart at the news of his oldest friend being so deeply in trouble.
Making a sound that could only be described as a growl, Steve prowled through the room to where Tony was still standing frozen, looking at Steve with wide, desperate eyes, his pupils completely blown.
Tony had tried his hardest to pry as many details about the late Lady Rogers as he could when Steve’s party of friends had still been there, but he had ultimately failed to learn more than he’d already known. At times, even now, he caught Steve staring out into the empty space when he thought no one was looking, exuding an aura of longing, a heart-aching regret surrounding his beloved form. Tony suspected it had to do with his wife’s passing. He could never be sure, of course, but what else could it be, to be able to bring such melancholy to the other man.
“Just to sleep,” he said, bringing one of his hands up to cup at the back of Tony’s head and draw him close. Even in the dark, he could feel Tony’s questioning gaze burning his skin.
“It has come to my notice that you are spending a lot of time with Lord Rogers, that is, aside from your working for the man. Now, I may be old, but I still seem to remember how fond you both were of each other as children. I always thought it was unfortunate how you grew apart.”
All through dinner, Steve raked his mind for a way to keep Lord Stone away from Tony. As much as he hated it, he still needed Lord Stone to sign the final agreement. Losing the railway deal at this point would mean that all the hard work of these past weeks would go to waste, and the Stark Estate finances would be back to square one. As well off as Steve was, he still had ended up spending a rather large sum of money paying off the property’s mortgage, and he needed the estate to start making some real profit soon, or it would leave him basically incapable of supporting it in the long run.
It had been one of the many gifts Tony had given him, though perhaps the only one Steve had accepted, because it hadn’t been overly lush, or too expensive, but rather plain-looking, like most others. It had been a game of theirs, Steve refusing Tony’s extravagant gifts, usually clothes, simply because he could never be seen in them, while Tony insisted he accept them.
, had seemed familiar. It didn’t take long for Steve to connect the mystery man that Tony was planning to meet at the inn with the man Bucky had told him about.
“How can I be of assistance to you, Sir Barnes?” he asked again, but Barnes didn’t rise to the bait. It was unnerving the way the man simply stood in the doorway, looking at him calculating. “May I offer you a drink perhaps? We have the most enticing collection of brandy as I am sure you already know. Truly, I could never find it in myself to be parted from it, no matter how much one could make from such a sale. Nothing beats a good spirit, I always say. Maybe I could have Jarvis bring a glass up for you?”
“I thought you were unwell,” he stated, no accusation behind the words. He was unguarded maybe for the first time since this tumultuous affair of theirs had started, Tony realized.
Two days before the ball, almost everyone in the manor was busy with preparations. Steve wished that the entire affair would be done already. Every day was more insufferable than the previous one. He was tired of it all, and most of all, he was tired of keeping up the pretence that nothing was amiss between himself and Lord Stone, and even worse, between himself and Tony. In the past three days, he had spent less than a total of half an hour in Tony’s presence. It hurt him more than he would ever admit, but it was necessary if he wanted to keep Tony safe from Stone’s unwanted advances.
Rhodes fell and he only knew that after rescuing his friends, in the flight to return to Wakanda from the RAFT.
“You know you can tell him…you have time, Tones” Rhodey said watching him apprehensively from his seat in the corner of the room.
He is tired and when Steve changes the trajectory towards the Arc Reactor, Tony can feel his heart breaks like the power source.
And that was only two of his tasks; there are more, some of them more mundane, like going for the laundry or buying an apology gift for the girlfriend/boyfriend of turn.
It was his last line of defense against his hopeless crush. Tony was afraid to call him by his name and fall more for him.
Steve was so handsome in his uniform, it was a sight and nearly made Tony sigh. He would deny as many times as he wanted but without a doubt he was in love with his best friend and today he would lose him to another person.
He adjusted his tie for a thousand times (if Rhodey was to be believed, Tony said he was a liar who lies), he was oddly nervous; because Tony Stark was always confident and nervousness was not in his dictionary. But today he was, as his friends could see, nervous.
He was happy a feeling that was sorely missing for some time, the puppies was good for him. Now if only Steve Rogers looked at his way for a little while, he would be completely happy. He didn’t hope that his unrequited crush change, he was content if at least he could talk normally with the blond; he seemed to say all the wrong things or be reduced to a blabbering mess every time Tony was in front of Steve.
There were heroes that didn’t want anything to do with the Government, but they accepted to read their proposal. They were willing to compromise in order to satisfy some of his demands.
, because operating without any baseline its just as dangerous as super villains, Tony didn’t like to agree with Ross but they were not more like lousy Vigilantes. They were a lot of innocents’ deaths, as proof of that, and the tally seemed to rise after each battle. Not amount of training appeared to help on that, it wasn’t totally their fault but they hadn’t had any form to defend their actions too.
He grieves again and asks himself if it will ever stop, he traces the familiar patter of that man’s name, over and over on a blank wrist. He wonders if Steve feels hollow like him, if loosing his name hurts to him, like it’s killing Tony.
At his 23 years old, Anthony Edward Stark was the founder and the Head of de R&D department of Stark Resilient, Virginia Potts was the CEO.
Maybe it was the way that Mr. Rogers looked at this woman, the tender cadence in his voice and caring tact towards her, it was totally different to the other people who he went out with. She was special.
Then he went an called the rest of the Avengers to fight with their friends (with other Avengers), because they had to save the world, to stop those five Winter Soldiers… to clean Bucky’s name.
“And then maybe I will invite you for lunch, but I will let you foot the bill since I probably will forget my wallet ‘cause the nerves, since I can’t believe this wonderful man invited me for a coffee and it makes me so happy and clumsy that I would forget my stupid wallet just like my boss”
“Very well, sir” his butler said smiling, “also it’s refreshing to find you well rested and feed, they were very good for you”
Tony glared at the man until he abandoned his office, he still didn’t trust Ross like the other Ross in his life, he didn’t like all the mystery and uncalled help. That man had his own agenda, Tony was sure of that. What could Ross gain of all of this? That question was what bugged Tony the most.
“I wanted to save the world” Tony said to his father’s gravestone, “I wanted to do the right thing, but I don’t know what the right thing is anymore”
“That Mr. Stark, we can discuss in another time. Now I’ve a meeting with some of the UN panel that required a briefing of the last developments”
He ended the call and tried to get his bearings, not only he had to get a glimpse of his boss crush, now he had to get an actual look and saw how great they looked together, maybe they would be presented and he would find, again, how impossible and absurd was his crush.
Maybe they are coordinates to a point of reunion, someplace where they can see each other without the fear of the U.N breathing down their necks, or perhaps he finally realized how wrong the Accords are. A tiny part of him hopes that it is because Tony recognized that Bucky is a victim too and that his stubborn lover forgives him.
Steve commanded into his phone, before locating his car and jumping in. The woman told him the address with a now slightly calmer voice.
Why did he have to get up so soon. He couldn't remember. Maybe if he just closed his eyes for a moment he would know. The snow was soft and didn't feel too cold with the strange warmth floating around him, surrounding him. Like a warm embrace shielding him from all his problems, all his insecurities, all his worries. It felt almost as good as Steve's hugs. Tony smiled. The thought of Steve was all he needed to get distracted from the burn marks the fire was creating on his now pale skin.
Steve threw on his only suit jacket and took the elevator to the garage. He checked his wristwatch for the sixth time in two minutes. No, he was not nervous. With a bouquet of vintage pink roses in one hand (Tony’s favourite) and his car keys in the other, he deemed himself as ready as he could get. Steve let out a deep breath. For some reason he couldn't get himself to shake away a heavy feeling that something horrible was going to happen. The man shook his head. It would be fine, It would have to be fine. They would enjoy some food, and then Steve would do it. Steve would ask Tony the big question and pray for a yes. The blond nodded, and got in his car.
“Petey! Are you not grateful for having your handsome dads pick you up, even after detention!” His dad continued, jokingly.
The man was coughed and choked as he tried to use the wall for support, this however was not his greatest idea.  Tony quickly retrieved his arm, and scanned the burnt mark covering the insides of his hand. Ouch! Ok, he was definitely not doing that again. Tony took a look around. What way was out? The smoke had covered everything, and he could honestly just close his eyes at this point, because it would be no different! The hero stressed as he stopped looking for an exit, and started looking for something to cover himself so he wouldn't get hit by falling debris. Oh, how much he would give for Steve’s shield right now, or you know, just not being in this situation at all.  The man used his hands to blindly look for something solid to use as a makeshift shield, or something hard to maybe break a window if he found one. Finally his non-burnt hand found something solid, the metal closet from earlier.
They had promised each that they wanted to spend the rest of their life together a long time ago. Every mission still worried them both equally of the other’s recklessness. They still holds hands, and cuddle as often as possible. Steve still buys Tony flowers every friday, and it never fails to make the brunet flustered. Tony has to stand on his tippy toes to kiss his boyfriend when he isn't wearing shoes with heels, or his ironman suit. Steve drags the smol workaholic to bed when he has been working days without rest, and then aggressively cuddles him until he falls asleep. Sometimes Tony cooks, it's an incredibly rare occurrence but when he does, it's Italian food Clint would marry Tony for. (Yes, Steve was slightly offended).
The second he saw the ring he knew it was perfect. The sapphire shone a magnificent blue and reminded him of the arc reactor. Steve had told Tony a thousand time that the blue light shining from his chest was beautiful. Tony always denied him, believing he was simply being nice, or supportive about it. With this he could finally prove it.
“There is nothing to talk about” with a wink. Tony sent him a dark look, which only resolved in Steve wiping his smile of and sending Tony a serious look of his own.
“I know, I completely get it. You know I would do the same, and I love you for it, that doesn't mean I wont be angry and worried every time.” Steve smiled lovingly down at well, his lover.
For a moment, Steve considered the possibilities of what could happen. Of what was happening. Of what could have happened before he even got the call. What if Tony was already dead?
The soldier got up from the old comfortable couch that smelled of motor oil, sweat, cologne, and Tony, whilst he putt the tiny box back in his pocket. Steve moved towards the elevator only to be stopped by a metal hand/claw tugging at his suit jacket. He had been so lost in thought that he hadn't even noticed Dummy. Steve smiled and pet his head/hand. Dummy made a delighted noise back. Before Steve could leave, Dummy signaled for him to wait and went to go get something. The tall man had a good idea of what.
“When I feel like i can’t do something, or I feel scared, I think about him. He's brave and inspire me to do the best I can everyday, because I know he would believe in me. But If thinking about him isn't enough, I hug him. It gives me strength, feels like he's giving me a little of his powers y’know? “
The billionaire hadn't been inside the building for more than a couple of minutes, but it was more than enough. When running head first into the situation he hadn't considered the arc reactor, and how weak his lungs had become from just that. He still would have gone inside, of course. Tony had attempted yelling and screaming after the child, but still hadn't gotten an answer. He had covered about half the building, but the flames were growing a lot bigger than what he was comfortable rescuing a kid from. Soon enough the exit would be blocked, he didn't have much time. Still, he wasn't going to leave the building without at least finding a body. He was still terrified of course, If he was struggling this much, how would the kid be alive. The hero grunted, he couldn't think like that! Tony took a deep breath full of dark toxic smoke and screamed as loud as he could.
“What?” Tony answered. One eyebrow arched up in curiosity. Steve looked at the golden eyes of his currently, simply boyfriend.
The thing is, Steve bought this six months ago. Maybe he had stalled a little, but really, how could he not. Ok, so Steve thought the ring looked beautiful, but would Tony think so too?
The child seemed very reluctant. After what felt like hours to Tony, the boy easily shook his head before he answered certainly.
The thing is, Steve had really been thinking about proposing for a long time. This evening just made everything more clear. If something happened to him, or God forbid Tony, he’d forever regret to never marrying him. To never give Tony his ring when he could. So, yes maybe a hospital isn't the best place to do it. Maybe it's a tiny bit strange to do it right after Tony got hurt and injured. But really, the only thing Steve truly cared about was the approval of one man. Anthony Edward Stark. Or maybe, just maybe, Anthony Edward Stark Rogers.
Yeah, Steve wouldn't let him walk around the restaurant if he was wet and shivering cold. The stubborn shorty huffed. He’s rich, It would easy to just buy a new one for the date! Looking around he spotted a little corner shop to the left, and what he thought might be suits? He probably needed glasses. (Not that he would tell Steve that) Maybe his luck returned? He was soaked, but there they were, suits! Not as good quality or expensive as the Armani suit that dripped ice cold water towards the snowy ground, but it would have to do.
It's his own fault that he is getting wide eyed stares from other students and that he has to uncomfortably listen to his teacher talk about safe sex.
Tony let out a hoarse snicker, it had been a long time since he'd been *hiding in the closet*. Bad jokes aside, he got in and closed the door in front of him. He just needed time to think, and a place to hide until the building wasn't falling so dramatically fast around him. Destructive sounds could be heard loudly in the background and Tony felt uncomfortably warm. The closet was really small, even for a relatively short man like Tony. The burn mark, especially the ones on his hand pricked and hurt. Ok, he said as the building was falling apart around his tiny safespace. What happens now?
Someone, NOT TONY, spoke into the expensive device. For a moment the soldier was confused. Did he call the wrong number? Luckily, before he got to open his mouth and apologize for calling “the wrong person”, she continued talking.
The smaller man was shivering and sweating at the same time. He was dizzy, and felt nauseous, but Steve was right there! Once more, he prepared to move. The man took a deep breath, and was ready to make a run for it, right through the flames. Luckily, he was yet again interrupted.
“M-My aunty! My aunt and my u-uncle were still here! My uncle was going to help aunty get something, a-and they told me to get o-out! But I-I didn't wanna leave them! W-what if they're still here!”
“Captain America could get out of the building. Hug the bear, and you can do it too. You're a smart kid. You hid where the flames and smoke couldn't get to you, and blocked a lot of the smoke with you amazing t-shirt. I’m sure your epic pants are the reason though. You just didn't want to ruin the little Ironmen by dirtying or burning them. Am I right, or am I Ironman?”
Anyways, he was finally done when suddenly Flash decided it had been a while since his last beating. This usually wasn't a problem for the nerd. He could take a beating, having been tortured by villains and such before. But this time Flash punched his face, or more specifically, his right eye.
The boy was shivering in his thin Iron-man themed pajama pants, holding what looked like some kind of teddy bear in his hand. Tony couldn't really tell from so far away, and it wasn't really important. Normally, he would have loved to stay more patient with the kid, but he really didn't have time for more reassuring snark talk, right now. It was a miracle in itself that he had been able to speak as much, with the horrible smoke stuffing on his already damaged lungs.
“Kid, I'll be fine. I'll go looking for your aunt and uncle, and you'll be outside, safe with family and friends.”
Quickly he thanked the woman, luckily the situation was very close to the restaurant. Only about a minute drive-if you broke all traffic laws like Captain America was currently doing. Meaning, he had 60 second, give or take, to calm down. Nothing would get done in pure panic and stress. Steve took a deep breath before calling Sam. He was amazing at getting Steve to not, well panic. Getting more people to help in this situation, would not be good. If the building had been burning for half an hour, it wouldn't holdt much more. Maybe, Falcon would know more about this. After all, he was more used to the rescuing kinds of missions than Steve. The soldier took another deep breath.
No, the person sitting to the left of the boy is the one and only Tony Stark, aka Iron-man, and to the right of Peter is the legendary Steve Rogers, also known as Captain America.
Honestly, no shame. Peter cursed silently as he got in the car. The panic only increased when he found his pops sitting in the passenger seat besides Tony.
No way he was going to miss a date with Steve because of some fucking rain! The weather made it hard to make out anything arond him, but he was smiling now. Finding solutions to problems, it was how he felt useful. He was closing up to the small shop, almost in reach of the wooden door handle. That's when the plans for the day changed.
New tears started running down the little boy's face. He shook his head, his hands were shaking, but the grip he had on his cap-bear was tight. He swallowed quickly before continuing.
He was 17 and they still wanted him home by eight. It was a miracle he did not get grounded for life after they found out about his Spider-Man gig, just six months of going to school and coming straight home as well as him wearing a tracker to every patrol.
A scream could be heard. Someone, most likely a woman, was screaming for help. Tony turned away from his plans for the day, and ran directly towards the screaming.
The small child shook his head frantically. He was crying now, hiccups mixing into his sobs, whilst he pleaded at Ironman.
The class is filled with students. A few other being in the same boat as the web-head, and other not so much.
Finally he ran around the building corner and realized the source of her distress. This would be fine, he assured himself whilst running towards it. A building was no match for Iron-man! Tony was just about to activate his iron-man suit from his suitcase, when he finally remembered. That's what he had forgotten! Not good, really not good. He had do something! They didn't have time to wait for help. The kid was in there and the building was already falling apart. That wasn't even the worst thing, If the building didn't kill him, the smoke definitely would.
They had gotten out of the car, dragging him out with them and hugged him. One on each side. Tony to the left, Steve to the right. They had told him how much they love him in some serious conversation about trust, the dangers of a seemingly little injury and responsibility. After that, they had, more times than necessary, said that the one who did this would die a very slow and painful death, or the last one was mostly Tony, actually.
Tony, his closest friend since Bucky. Tony, his light in the end of the tunnel. Tony, his boyfriend he had planned on proposing to tonight. Tony, his man he had hoped to spend the rest of his life with. Tony his man he had dreamed about starting a family with. Tony.
It all happened yesterday when he was had been in detention for being late three days in a row, which was really unfair because he is Spider-man and totally did not spend two of those days eating Mexican food with Wade.
His voice wasn't too loud, and half of it was a cough, but it would have to do. Steve didn't have super hearing for nothing. Tony heard distant thumping and running as he looked around with a small smile on his face. Steve was on his way, and there was no one he trusted more than Steve. Tony glanced around himself, there was fire everywhere and so he started calmly trying to figure out how to move without getting too close. A solution came to mind and Tony started moving, until he got rudely interrupted by a hysterical Captain America, no scratch that, a hysterical Steve Rogers.
His voice was harder than steel and It was more of a command than question, but it would have to do. Something was happening, something dangerous. Something that made Tony unable to call Steve and explain. The super soldier felt like breaking something, beating someone up, taking down anyone that dared to hurt his boyfriend. The man shook his head. Not the time. Maybe he was just paranoid and overreacting. Instead he started tapping a rhythm with his foot, praying that Tony had just lost his phone and was looking for it, whilst this lady randomly just found it or something like that.
“Of with the fucking hoodie, kid.” His dad was using his Iron-Man voice. Steve looked at Tony for a moment. Evaluating is absolutely pissed expression, he joined his husband.
The man started walking towards the fire. Every step was filled with purpose and determination, not stopping for anyone- or so he thought. A little boy, had to be younger than six, grabbed at his dress pants. His eyes were red, like he’d been crying non-stop. The adult was about to gently push the boy away, and tell him that this wasn’t the time, something in that manner at least. But, stopped when he looked, really looked into the boys eyes. Sadness, guilt, desperation and determination showed in the chocolate brown eyes.
This wouldn't be his first time in a danger zone. A kid, a little boy was still inside. The decision was already taken for him. Fastly, Tony gave the woman his phone, telling her to call the fire department before running into the burning building.
So small and full of insecurities. Also, respectfully scared. Tony decided he had to get used to people actually being afraid of danger. The bearded man noticed a lot more about the kid when he was this close. Bruises were scattered all over the him. Where the parents doing this, the aunt and uncle, bullies? Not now, he mentally told himself. He was definitely doing a background check on the kid when this was over though.
Tony didn't know how long he'd been in there. What he did know however, (or, he was pretty sure of it at least), was that the kids parents must have gotten themselves out of there. He had been looking everywhere he was able to get to, but still hadn't seen any other people. They were either outside, or dead. Now, if the billionaire himself didn't want to end up as his second suggestion, he'd have to be fast. At this point the brunet was barely able to move, and had been breathing in smoke through his thin shirt, for longer than he thought he would be able to in the first place. Parts of the old house were collapsing around him, as he searched for a way out in the blinding smoke.
He couldn't do anything but plead and beg and comply, paralyzed with fear and desire. Equally repulsed, equally aroused.
"Yeah, I can't trust that." Steve replies jokingly. "You'd fuck about anything even remotely looking like a human."
Steve had a sudden, pretty graphic vision flashing in his head and let escape a giggle. He turned around. "You're not gonna try that, are you?"
Tony's smile spread and his eyes twinkled. "Alright." He said in a soft chuckle. "I'll give you a hand."
the established order and many things can change in ten years of time. Maybe people were more ready to accept it when it was two female omegas. Still...
Steve still had his arms curled around his neck and pressed himself against him. "Why did you stop?" He whined. "I was this close... Keep fucking me!!!" He ordered in a nasty tone.
Tony shrugs, pretending he's still working on his blueprints. His heart beats a little too fast for him to be efficient though. "I'm almost done. I'll be able to make it after all."
to take, to fuck or do whatever he wants with. How horrific is that? He put his seeds in him and now they share something nothing can take away from them.
Steve's heart raced and a shiver ran through his body. He tightened his embrace, as if Tony was his anchor to the world. He felt his knees wobble and Tony's scent didn't make things better. Steve was feeling dizzy. "How come?"
The comment had the advantage of making everyone laugh and eased the suddenly tense atmosphere. Steve appreciated having everyone's attention turn away from him. His heart was still beating hard. Millions of thought swirling in his head. He was just trying to bury them deep.
Tony felt a pang in his chest. He knew he had fucked up, thank you very much. Tony fucked up, period. Tony wasn't a good person. He was selfish and he ruined everything he touched. Steve knew Tony was fucked up and he accepted him anyway. He had insisted when Tony gave him an out. Tony really wished he could give Steve was he wanted but what Steve wanted was so out of his reach he would never be able to. He
Bruce and Clint quickly got absorbed in a friendly debate about the morals of hunting for sport and soon fell behind, while Steve, Lady Natalia and Tony went on ahead, with Tony hovering near the pair of friends as if reluctant to be there. Steve resisted the urge to feel bad about excluding the man. Still, Tony, true to his ever-social nature, didn’t fail to speak up here and there, adding to his and Lady Natalia’s conversation.
They chatted in a genial manner for a little while. Mr Coulson was eager to hear some of Steve’s war stories, while Steve found himself asking about the church’s charitable efforts in the area. He was deeply affected when he learned of the shelter Mr Coulson was running, a safe haven for widows and unwed mothers. As the child of a widow, Steve was very aware of their struggle, and he could only imagine how much harder his mother’s life -and consequently his own- would have been had she and his father not been married before his death. It was an admirable cause, and he readily expressed interest in giving his patronage to the place.
