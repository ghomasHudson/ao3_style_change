So the secrecy is new, and it sits heavily in Steve’s gut. Bucky had been the first one to point it out one night when he and Sam had come over to Steve’s new dwellings. The apartment by Fort Green Park wasn’t big, to say the least, but it had been within his budget and there was decent enough lighting and inspiration for him to do his art (professionally and his freelance work.) Both of them had given Steve pitying looks when he tried to explain his reasons for moving, citing their budding relationship and need for privacy, but he knew they weren’t fooled. He was never any good at lying to himself.
without you, Tony. It took us going at each other’s throat for me to realize that you, Tony,” the hands are back on his face. Steve’s thumbs trace the curve of his cheek gently, coaxing him to meet his eyes, and Tony wants to look away.
. I will never be able to finish atoning for that,” he says vehemently.
“You’d know better than I do, Phil,” she says with a tone of resignation. “He’s in the lab; he won’t talk to anyone unless it’s Rhodes or Parker comes to pay him a visit. He rarely comes out anymore, and Pepper is clearly not calling him for SI business.”
“You’re smaller than the last time I saw you. I wouldn’t hold my breath, Benjamin Button,” Tony says and ruffles his hair.
“Like we were in that prison?” Wanda says, and despite the anger in her tone there is a note of hurt as well. Tony watches the toll it takes on the android.
. Those are lit up in Blue. In the
Only Tony wasn’t just his friend. Tony was his
“He did it,” Steve says in both wonder and terror. They had talked about this, back when Steve still had his head screwed on straight and Tony wasn’t as broken. Back when Steve could still feel wonder at all the impossible things tony did on a daily basis. He had told him, late at night with that sparkle in his eyes, about the nanos. “Son of a bitch, he actually finished,” a chuckle leaves his lips. Then a laugh. The others look at him in concern, but he can’t help himself. It’s the first time in over two years that he’s felt this lighthearted even under the circumstances.
“You best keep quiet,” Sam says, deadly serious. “You’ve had your moral high horse, Clint, but now it’s time for you to listen. You keep throwing accusations around like someone forced you to do the things that you have done. Nobody has, but yet you decided you were going to cast Tony as the villain here. We’ve all heard your side, we are more than aware of what you believe, but now it’s time for you to listen to someone else for a change.”
It wasn’t until much later, lying in bed and still unable to sleep after all this time, that he let his mind voice what he had been worrying about for the last few years. He’d almost had the same thought before but had pushed it down viciously. The truth, however, was starting to solidify the more time passed. Sam had told him these things took time, that he just had to give himself space to get over it, to move on, to get to love someone again. Five years later, alone in a flat east of the Thames, Steve can’t help but ask himself: what if time doesn’t do what it’s supposed to do? What if nothing ever compares to what he had?
It had been the beginning of a beautiful friendship since then. They had been going on early morning coffee runs before their time at the museum and the occasional dinner after. Steve found himself being able to confide everything in Peggy; how much he missed his life and his friends, how lost he felt in his new life sometimes, how hopeless he felt about his future. Peggy didn’t let him wallow in self-pity for long and she was always good for giving him a good kick on the ass sometimes. Steve had talked himself out of asking her to go steady with him so many times that he was beginning to want to kick himself.
He had surprised himself by asking for her number, and for a few weeks he had convinced himself that it was what he wanted. She was loving and sweet, and she made him feel a little less out of breath. They could go on movie dates, and she wouldn’t make comments that would make Steve snort inappropriately or get them kicked out. They could go out to dinner and not drop a pretty penny on dessert. She never called him in the middle of the night for a walk or a picnic or a trip to the other side of the city. He could say he didn’t want to talk about something and she would give him his space.
“Answer it,” Nat’s hard voice slams him back into the very real situation they have in their hands at the moment.
new doodads, or when he’s having a fun time with one of Tony’s bots… so what if it used to be about him, for a while, and now it’s not. At least Peter is happy, and Tony is not selfish enough to begrudge him that. He has, at least, not lowered to that level of Howard’s neglect yet. “I’ll eat it, I swear.”
By the time hour two had hit, Clint had hit the pacing portion of his worrying. He justified it to himself by saying he was doing it in the hopes to calm his son. Nate had never been able to calm down by moving him, however, and usually just cried until he was content. Whatever goddamn baby whispering Stark had managed to find, Clint sure as hell didn’t have it. Not to mention the fact that he couldn’t speak Italian for shit.
“It’s the squirt, boss,” and that gets Tony getting his head off the table so fast that he gets dizzy. He blinks the spots dancing in his vision away, and then proceeds to slap at his cheeks. He hopes he looks healthy and awake enough to fool the kid.
They stare at each other with an intensity that hasn’t been there in months. As the others file out, Tony takes stock of the other man. He looks as tired as Tony feels, and there’s an unhealthy hollowness to his cheek. The stubble on his chin is surprising. His hair is also longer than Tony remembers. His blue eyes are stormy, but they roam all over Tony’s face as if starving for the sight.  The mechanic can admit to himself that he has missed him terribly, like the hollow space between his ribs of something that should have been there but wasn’t.
, the voice in his head that sounds suspiciously like his father grunts at him,
as much as he needs to, he never should have been left to do this on his own. Sometimes, when the deliriousness of sleeplessness and tiredness and anxiety grabs hold of him, he asks
if he’s confronted with authority. He will bite and tear if anyone attempts to dominate him. Steve wonders if Howard had demanded nothing but obedience from his son, if had abused his power over a child, to make Tony so weary and resentful of anyone who believes themselves above him.
“Stopping is hard,” Tony says with a half-smile, his eyes far away. “I tried way too many times to do just that, but—honestly, it wasn’t until our fight when I started realizing how much I needed to. What I saw in that vision,” one of Steve’s hands pets the back of his head when he mentions that and Tony smiles, “messed me up for a long time. It’s what made Pepper leave. I just
“You don’t trust me,” the other man says quietly. He looks so infinitely sad but resigned to the idea, and Tony wishes that he could contradict him. He hates to hurt him, but the engineer knows that he can’t do this and lie to himself. He can’t contradict Steve, and know that there’s days when the need to drink because of the memories gets so strong that he has to find Viz or Rhodey to watch him. He can’t tell him that the shield is hidden in the deepest part of his workshop because he can’t keep the panic at bay if he sees it. He can’t tell Steve that he considered bringing Barnes to the compound, but didn’t trust himself not to fall into that dark pit of despair and hatred and hurt him. He can’t give him a rundown of all the times he’s gone to the BARF looking for some peace.
“And he—you were dying, and he—you—he tried to—you said that it was his fault. You told him that he could have stopped it. If only—if—you told him he could have done more.” The sound of hard plastic snapping ricochets around the room like a gun shot. When everyone turns to look, nobody is really surprised to find the captain with the armrest of his char in his white-knuckled fist.
Tony looked at Rhodey across the table, but his brother was looking at the captain through narrowed eyes. The room was silent as they waited for his response, and he sensed a panic attack coming. In all of their acquaintance, the captain had never made meetings and debriefings optional. He had always told Tony that it was his job to attend these things. He had always been angry when Tony begged up because of SI or he was tired. Being presented with the choice was surprising, to say the least. Just when he was about to get fully caught in his own head, he met Viz’s eyes. The android was looking at him solemnly and unwaveringly, and Tony found himself settling. The android gave him one serious nod, and Tony felt himself relax.
Steve’s ability to form words had left him sometime around the mention of thirteen year old Tony. He can’t talk through the lump in his throat, so he merely nods. There’s a measure look in Rhodes’s eyes as he stares back, and then nods. He opens the door and gets out without another word. Steve can’t do anything but stare straight ahead and try not to break.
“Rhodes,” Steve chokes out. The guilt and the grief for a young boy he never met threatens to tear him in two. The reality of what keeping that secret from Tony hits him full force. He wants to defend himself, tell Rhodes that he hadnt know
runs out,” Wanda sneered.
He wasn’t exactly sure what it was, why Tony had created it in the first place, but he’d become well versed on what it did and, more specifically, what it did to the engineer. On their third week back, he’d stumbled upon a conversation between Rhodes and Tony on his way outside to run the perimeter. He’d wanted to walk away, had known he had no right to eavesdrop, but hadn’t been able to help himself. He hadn’t seen Tony in days, had been dying to know anything about the other man, and so he had stayed.
“Nothing,” Tony says fiercely into his hair, eyes shut tight. “There is absolutely nothing wrong with you, Peter. We’ll figure this out, okay? You and me, and the others. We will help you. We love you, bambino, so much. You hearing me?
“Seriously!” Tony turns around, and it’s really hard to fight down the grin that pops up on his face. It’s just so
“Yes, well,” the man said enigmatically. Then he cleared his throat and, though he had been standing straight, seemed to grow taller. The mood in the room immediately became more alert. “While we wait for the last person to arrive, I would like to address a question that I am sure most of you are concerned about. Seeing as Sergeant Barnes can’t tell you himself, I would like to inform you all that he is well and in the process of being reanimated from his voluntary cryostasis.”
She looks up at him with something like pride in her eyes, and he feels a thousand feet tall. And when she leans up on her toes and plants a kiss on his lips, the first one that feels
“We understand that,” Clint says calmly while taking Nate from Steve. Their eyes meet, and the understanding that they’ve had from countless missions passes between them. For this, they need to work together. For this, they need to calm the kids down. “We just want to know why what FRIDAY said scared you so much. If you tell us, we can help.”
“I was the one who didn’t tell you,” is all that the genius manages.
“It’s all right, Steve, you don’t have to say anything. I just—”Tony swallows a sound like a sob, and shoves his hands deep into his pockets as he shrugs. “I don’t know; I just had to tell you, I guess. In case—what if—what if I never get to tell anyone else, you know?”
The kicker, what makes Steve get a red haze in his vision and Bucky snarl under his breath, are the bruises on his throat. They look too much like fingerprints for anyone to mistake them for anything but what they are. When he gets a microphone shoved in his face, Tony smiles the loose grin of someone high on painkillers and throws a one liner before Rhodey shuffles him towards the waiting car. Tony, loose limbed, grin on his split lips and bruised body gives a jaunty little wave at the cameras and then he’s gone.
It had been such a stupid conversation, so damn long ago, when he and Tony had been sitting on the communal kitchen at three in the morning with a carton of ice cream open between them. Tony had been coming out of one of his engineering binges and Steve had had a visit from his old friend insomnia. Tony had been subtly trying to dig for information about what had kept him up. It was something he did whenever he caught the soldier up, which was unerringly often, and had become quite good at it. Steve had found himself talking about all the things that seemed so strange,
“Real,” Steve breathes back.
“What the fuck did he do?” the words come out of him like he has been punched in the stomach.
“He’s not here right now, buddy,” Clint said softly while pushing the baby’s fringe off his forehead.
“Mom misses the flowers,” Cooper’s voice breaks as he says it. “She keeps asking for a bouquet to be delivered so she can put them on the kitchen counter, and sometimes when I’m back from school I catch her standing there looking at them. I’ve come in a couple of times, and she doesn’t notice. She gets lost in them, and I know she’s thinking of home. She misses the garden, and the woods around our house, and how quiet everything was,” Coop’s breath hitches and Tony knows the desperation in his voice intimately, “and the afghan that we left thrown over the couch and the tally marks of where we grew up on the upstairs bathroom frame, and the musty old garage where the Old Lady was and Nate’s purple duckie and going out to the market and talking to Mrs. Ramirez about her grandkids, and taking us to the swimming pool, and dad. She misses Dad being around and making stupid jokes over dinner and throwing the Frisbee around with the stray dog that lives under our front porch and his whistling as he chops wood, and he can’t see that. It’s like he doesn’t care that he hurt my mom. And I hate him. I hate him for hurting my mama.”
“He was under my protection,” Tony says as he stares at the middle distance. It’s the only place he feels as though he is safe. “Nobody involved in the Accords, or the task forces, knew his identity. He was meant to come in, help bring you back so that I could convince you to sign, and go back to his life. He still had two years to make a choice.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You haven’t had peace in a long time, Tony Stark, and if I know them the way that I believe I do then they haven’t let you have any either.” Tony merely sighs, and leans back against his chair. He can feel the lecture coming. “What happened, everything, wasn’t just your fault. It’s time for you to stop apologizing and let them do it instead, and I know.
After his fifth time calling Bucky to ask if maybe he should cancel, give Tony a clean break, his friend shows up to his apartment and hits him on the arm as hard as he can. Steve bitches about it until he sees the look Bucky is giving him, and when his friend asks him, softly, to sit down because they need to talk, Steve goes without another word.
“Sorry, was this seat taken?” the boy says with an attempt at a grin that falls flat. It wasn’t that bad of a smoke screen, but his lips tremble at the corners with the effort to keep the façade. He keeps blinking his eyes, and Tony knows that if he were to ask, the kid would blame it on his floppy brown hair.
“I know,” the blond says fiercely and brings their foreheads closer together. “I
“I tore our family apart,” Tony hisses at him, and he can’t help but grasp at the edge of the table. The force of his grip hurts his palm, but he doesn’t care. He holds the king’s gaze, he’s never been one to back out of a fight, and tries to control his erratic breathing. “If it weren’t for me they never would have been targeted. They never would have gone to prison. This… this
“So he’s locked you out of his systems. Still mistrusting you even after—”
“Zemo had the video of the night the Starks died,” Steve’s eyes meet his. “The day Bucky killed them. I guess—I think—he was trying to use those words to snap Buck’s control. He wanted to prove that there was no more James Buchanan Barnes. That it was just the Winter Soldier. I—it was the first time Tony knew about it.”
“I think they’ve got this here. I’ll see you soon,” Phil sounds more animated now. “And Tasha, we’ll make it right. Somehow. That’s what family does, right?”
“That was different—“
Sam throws a look filled with pity his way before he looks back at the television. “You might want to sit down, Steve.”
A gift for the wait

, is what he doesn’t say. Stark isn’t looking at him, he’s still riveted looking up at the sky with a heaving chest, but Clint has his eyes locked on him regardless. “So, yes, I was terrified. I was terrified and in denial and I made Ultron because despite the fact that
Hey-o!
In a blink, he has a spectator’s view of that god forsaken bunker in Siberia. And there are two Tony’s in the room. One in jeans and a ratty shirt, skinnier and paler than he remembers, and the other fully suited in the Iron Man armor and with bruises marring his face. One glaring purple-black ringing one of his big, brown eyes.
“It’s all right, Petey, it’s okay, honey,” Tony says quietly, carding his fingers through his boy’s hair. He grasps one of Peter’s hands, presses them against his chest, and takes a deep breath. “There, find my heartbeat, baby. You hear it?” Peter nods, breath still frantic. “Okay, okay, you’re doing so well. Now, match my breathing, bud. Deep breaths. In through your nose, out through your mouth,” Tony takes exaggerated breaths, hoping his boy will match him. It takes a bit, but Peter gets there. When his breathing has calmed down, he sags against Tony’s chest, and the mechanic wraps him up in his arms tightly.
He’d always known he’d be as much of a shitty parent as Howard.
shoes and flakes of crust clinging to his eyelashes. When the sun begins to set and the hanging lights begin to turn on, the baby begins to droop in his arms and he maneuvers around until he’s more comfortable. The kids had gone out to play soccer in the lawn while the adults chattered, and Tony can’t remember an evening where he’d felt this
.” Steve had reared back from that sentence and everything it implied. Like a coward, he’d run out of the compound and out into the woods. It had taken him hours to find his way back, and even then he’d desperately wanted to be out again.
“We’re supposed to be getting lunch!” The girls yell after them, finally having looked up from their project. Which, Steve now realizes, goes far beyond simple coloring. He’s kind of too intimidated to ask what, exactly, they had been creating.
“I got all the pretty dresses I want for my dollies,” Ginny says cheerfully.
“Are they back?”
And though he doesn’t feel ready, will never be fucking ready, he lets them drag him into a seat. He doesn’t really contribute much, can’t really think of anything that might be helpful, but his eyes remain locked on
know that he doesn’t owe Clint shit, but he’s not doing it for him. “I’m not doing this for him or even me.” He tilts his head and sees the moment Steve connects the dots. He gives him one firm nod and sits back down.
he doesn’t—he can’t even begin to imagine what he would have done.
“Yeah? How are they?”
“You wanna know why I
“Hi, Aunt Peggy,” he tells the headstone now and bites his trembling lower lip. Though he knows she’s not there, she’s in London, hell everything that made her the woman he’d loved was somewhere out there in the cosmos far too unreachable even for him, he still felt the need to talk to her. It’s why he’d commissioned her headstone here, despite SHIELD having fallen, because he needed her close. She was the last of his family; the only one to die the way they were meant to, after a full life of love and loss and grief and utter happiness. She’d drifted off on her own, they’d told him, holding the hand of the people whom she loved and who loved her back.
“Tony,” that goddamn voice. How can it still sound the same even after all these months? How can it have the same effect it did back then? Shouldn’t something be different, broken, destroyed beyond repair? “Don’t go.”
“Rhodes, I think its time for your walk,” Natasha tells Rhodey, which just serves to spark his anger more. Saying he isn’t a
“Hey,” Steve replied quietly. His eyes flickered briefly to Rhodes, who was pretending to be engrossed on a tablet but Steve could tell was actually watching them, before going back to Tony. “I didn’t expect you to be up until later.”
But nope, the thing is actually real. A closer look at it, the lapels are standing up in the imitation of a fighting stance and honestly what in the ever-loving hell is Tony’s life now, reveals to be Strange’s cape. Cloak? He thinks the wizard had called it a cloak.
“Steve—”
The shy knock on the door distracts Tony from the bundle he holds tightly, though carefully, in his hands. He’s been sitting in the quiet stillness of the room since the caretaker had shown him where to go. The rocking chair had been a blessing, his bones not being what they used to be even with the nanos, and it seems to help. It had been three weeks since Marina had given him what could possibly be one of the greatest gifts of his life. They had been rushing, and even though they had barely gotten any sleep and had nearly been maimed trying to get everything in order, it had still taken them three weeks. A feat on itself, Marina had said, but it was too long.
Bucky who was dating Natasha.
“Have anyone in mind, Agent Coulson?” Tasha says with a smile. She already knows the answer. Part of her, though she’ll never own up to it, is relieved that she might soon have some back-up. Especially when she sees the jet, not a Wakandan one, land in the airstrip.
“I’ll be fine,” Tony answered the unspoken question. It was no surprised that the other man had noticed how Tony used the baby as a touch stone when they had their earlier chat. The name was code-named the Falcon, after all.
“Petey,” Tony says, clearing his throat that suddenly feels tight with emotion. He crouches at Peter’s side, one hand in his hair and the other on the blanket surrounding the baby, and leans a little closer. “Meet your baby sister. Sarah Morgan Stark-Rogers, meet your big brother Peter.”
“Of course not, but we don’t believe they will. This has been a long time coming. Her actions have already been discussed, at length,” T’Challa said and his dark, piercing gaze didn’t waver from Steve. “It’s just a matter of judging her mental state. Whether or not she’s truly capable of controlling her powers or not. They have asked others to present themselves, as well.”
“Secure,” Viz responds, and it is instantly clear that that is not the right answer to give.
Someone give Tony a blanket and a hug, please. Honestly.
“’Vengers Facility,” the girl says proudly.
“What. Did. You. Just. Say?” he asks his son careful; at his back, he can feel the Cloak stand taller and lean closer against his side. It’s a testament to how much of an idiot his son is that even a sentient piece of cloth can sense what Tony is thinking.
Viz has stationed himself at the door, and Tasha gives Tony an amused glance that lets him know he’s not the only one that has noticed the android’s attention. His smile quickly falls when he hears the others making their way towards them. T’Challa’s soothing voice seems to put him at ease a bit, but he still got quickly to his feet.
picked sides a long time ago.
His head had snapped to the sound; footsteps that had sounded too light and too unsure to be anything but a baby. He would know that sound anywhere, it used to be one of his favorites, maybe it still was. Back when Peter had delighted himself with toddling everywhere and bouncing out of walls and giggling as he went.
, how much he wanted to just—hand me everything ‘cause he thought it’d keep me around. When we came back from Christmas break for our second semester, he was right back where we started. Partying, and blowing off his classes, but by then we had one class together. And I got to
Steve feels as though he has checked out completely.
“Please,” is all Steve says because he knows now. He knows that Tony will lash out and
“Where is Bucky?” the Captain says in a quiet voice. If he were superman, Tony would have a perfect laser spearing through him at that moment. His stare is that intense.
It doesn’t seem to matter, though, because Steve’s puppy dog eyes come out full force. Trembling fingers, soft despite the hours he spends training, cup his chin and make Tony meet his eyes. The mechanic wants to look away, but God they are so blue and so
“It’s fine,” he says quietly. He really doesn’t mind. Seeing Peter this excited about anything always makes him feel like he’s doing something right. So what if it’s usually when Tony introduces him to something new, or gives him new doodads, or helps him
“Before everyone goes,” Rogers said to the group as the children were nodding off in their chairs and Laura and Lang had gotten up to take them to bed. They had finished their food hours ago, but had been too comfortable to break the fragile peace they had created. It had been dark outside for a while, and Baby Bart had fallen asleep in his father’s arms minutes before. The room turned to give the man their attention. “I’d like to ask all of the Avengers,” his breath hitched at the word. There was a note of incredulousness in his voice at being able to say it again. “Though Laura you are more than welcome to join, and I would appreciate it if you could be there, your majesty. I want to ask you all to meet me in the conference room tomorrow at eleven.”
about what had really happened to his parents, maybe if both of them had listened to each other rather than entrench themselves on their own stubborn opinions… just, maybe it’s too many maybes for them. Perhaps it’s best to let those demons lie.
“Why what?” Tony asked, one eyebrow raised sardonically at him. He was trying to wind him up, and Steve was surprised in himself that he could recognize it when before he would have jumped at the change to bite the other man’s throat. But there was something about having seen Tony at his most vulnerable, having seen him bite his tongue when he was being yelled at, that gave a man perspective. Tony didn’t react unless he was cornered, and this? Well, remembering their confrontation at the UN when Rhodes had brought him in, he couldn’t say he blamed him. Not when Steve had thrown his efforts back in his face so many times.
“So how did she get there, Tony?” Steve says slowly. He’s beginning to see the horrible truth of it, and he hates Ross more than anything at that moment. He hates the man for every goddamn thing he’s done. For what the truth will most likely do to the genius. “Tony, she had no badge, no clearance, no checks, nothing. How could she have found you backstage? You were alone, yes?” At Tony’s silent nod, Steve mimics him and continues softly. “She wouldn’t have found you without help.”
“I am,” Phil said simply. He stared down at Steve and he had the distinct feeling that there was a talk in his future that he would not enjoy. Phil’s eyes briefly dropped to Steve’s arm wrapped around Tony and then to Tasha. There was a whole conversation there, and Steve bit his lip to stifle his curiosity. “Tasha called me once you were back. Said you might be needing help from someone with experience doing… damage control.”
Life after that is… pandemonium, to put it bluntly. There are law suits and investigations and accusations and all sorts of legalese Tony can barely keep up with. Through everything, Rhodey proves to be a rock. After that first UN meeting, which is later on dubbed D-Day for Destruction Day, Rhodey makes it his mission to be with Tony at all times. His exoskeleton is working as well as it should, he says, and he’s made leaps and bounds with his therapy. He’s ready to kick ass, he convinces Tony who honestly didn’t fight it very much. He’s feeling the strain of it, every day, and had been wishing for some sort of respite from it all.
until Tony had looked up at him with something broken in his eyes before delivering one last painful jab at Steve and walking out of the room. JARVIS had been instructed to keep mum to him until—until he’d been needed because his creator was in danger of braining himself if he didn’t sleep. “He’s here,” he breathes now.
Cooper grinned as Sam and Tony burst out laughing. Scott spluttered and flushed, which sent the other two into another round of hysterics. Lila and Cassie gave long-suffering sighs while they muttered
“You defended the accords,” Cooper says stubbornly. Tony closes his eyes in shame, and the boy sits back to look up at him better, though he doesn’t pull away. “You thought they could work, and you still protected us. You came to get us before the bad people did, mom said so. You were for the accords, but you didn’t pick sides.”
“No,” and hey, it’s not Tony that bites it out. Rhodey gets to his feet with an effort, and Tony offers his arm without even thinking about it. They’d gotten used to supporting each other in the past few months. “You said this was a team meeting,” the venom in the statement is meant for the Captain.
“Excuse me?” Rogers’s voice is horrified.
It would be just Tony’s luck that everything would go to shit right before he was about to fucking graduate. Three years of shitty high school experiences, and all he asked for was one damn year when he didn’t have to deal with any more bullshit. The universe, however, seemed to have other plans.
“Click it,” Bucky tells him seriously. He raises his eyes to his friends and sees both of them looking back at him steadily. “You need to see what he says.” Steve doesn’t think the words strange, but he will realize what they meant later. Sam and Bucky had known what Tony had said in that interview. They had known that Steve wasn’t okay, but that he wasn’t the only one.
Here’s Tony’s chance to prove it to himself, and, well. He’s a futurist. Despite his front of being a realist, Tony has always been nothing short of a hopeless optimist.
(See the end of the chapter for
“After everything—“the agent began with an incredulous tone in his voice.
“Is that why you haven’t’ been going on patrol as much anymore?” Tony asks, the pieces of this particular puzzle finally falling into place. “Because you think that if you leave the compound something will happen to one of us?”
“It means Thor and Stormbreaker can actually go get him. The nanos strengthened… everything about him. His bones, his neural and cardiovascular system… his body is in perfect shape. Not only that, but if he were to be injured the nanos would take care to repair whatever damage might be done until he could get proper medical attention. Even if, unlikely as though it might be, his body couldn’t take the strain all that would happen is that he would shut down until someone administered proper medical care. Which,” Banner says with a determined expression. “is what I’m here for.”
“Pete, the time I spend with you is the highlight of every day for me, okay? I know—I know we don’t talk much about feelings and what not, but I am all right. As—as all right as I’m ever going to be, and that’s because of you. For a while, I thought I would never—I didn’t think I would get this far, but you’ve helped. God, you have helped so much. I just—there is a part of me that is always going to be missing, kid. I don’t expect you to get it, but—but dating isn’t—I
, Steve realizes with a jolt. He hadn’t bothered to think about Tony’s feelings about losing JARVIS. “I wanted him to be a sort of extension of JARVIS. The problem wasn’t that I wanted to create an AI, I’d done that before, but I—I got desperate, and I fucked around with
The king laughs, and Tony smirks. The unlikely companionship they’d struck was something he never would have predicted, futurist brain or not. Tony had always thought himself too lowly, too jaded and dirty, to attract pure hearted people like the young monarch. If nothing else, at least he can be glad that he’d gained an allied, maybe even a friend.
The Tony in the suit says.
Does it make him the biggest sucker in the world to wish for that?
“Lila and Cassie are out with Sam and Wanda,” he says as way of explanation. He doesn’t need to expand for her to understand what he means. That two of the boys are too much Stark’s to be very friendly to him at the moment, and that his own son is too hurt to listen to him at the moment. Clint didn’t want to dump baby Nate on his oldest, and maybe it was childish of him, but he wanted to show his son that he was able to fix his messes, still. He sighs and thunks his head back on the glass.
Now it was the easiest thing in the world; he would talk himself hoarse about Bucky if one of his friends asked. Of course, he would get to it a little too late. He’s always too goddamn fucking late.
“I think it’s just about time for dinner, actually,” Tony said and gave a grin at the other man’s grateful look. “Pretty sure Laura has made food for the whole platoon by now.”
constant
“It wasn’t your fault,” and when he says it Steve realizes that it’s the first time the words have left his mouth. He squares his shoulders and forces Tony to meet his eyes when the other man makes a move as if he’s going to argue. “You hear me, Tony Stark? Ultron was not your fault alone, and we were a failure of a team for ever making you think it was. We failed you, Tony, and I can only hope that you will let us try again. As a team. As a family. Together. And the Accords? You were doing what you thought was best, and I didn’t listen. I won’t even pretend as though I thought about your reasons. I decided that you were wrong, and refused to compromise. That’s not what a leader does, that is not what a partner does, and that is certainly not what a friend does.”
Steve about all the people he’s lost. The blond knows that nobody on the team has really thought about it, how isolated Tony has really been his whole life or the fact that he lost so much in such a short amount of time. Sometimes Steve thinks that the reason Tony is expressing himself so much lately is because it’s finally catching up to him; it’s as though he’s reached a threshold where he
persona the other man was so insistent in cultivating. “Why?”
“Have they?”
“I was afraid,” steve says without hesitating. He’s never going to forget the panic that coursed through him at finding Tony gone. “I thought something had happened or—” he bites his lip and looks down at his feet. Tony goes still next to him and it takes everything in Steve not to turn to comfort him.
“I don’t give a damn,” he said, ignoring the gasps from the kids. “I haven’t seen him in months. I’m his father. I damn well have the right.”
because if he thinks long enough about what he did. If he puts himself in Tony’s position, if he starts thinking about what
“Tones,” Rhodey says in that tone of voice that means he’s about to go on a lecture.
He tries to think of something to say to the other man, but nothing comes to mind.
since that happened! It has been long enough for her to tell us the truth! You,” he hisses at Wanda and she drops her head in shame. “You let us crucify him for something that was already killing him inside! You let us believe that Ultron was a product of his arrogance! For years, Ultron colored our perception of what he was!”
people. Should have known.”
“I—yeah. Yeah, you can just—I can—”
“This feels…” Sam trails off with that same furrow between his eyebrows.
Steve doesn’t know what he and Tony talked about, the state his best friend might have found the young genius in, but he can surmise enough to guess that it was bad. Bucky’s eyes had been red rimmed, and he looked pale when he came back. There was a stain on one of his sleeves that was turning copper and crusty and Steve’s heart had hammered so hard in his chest as he asked Bucky where the blood had come from. Bucky had answered
After Clint had been done with telling him how he didn’t like him, most days couldn’t even stand him, but that they needed to get over their shit for the sake of his kids. When he was done telling Tony how he knew that he didn’t care about anyone but himself, but that Clint wasn’t going to let his kids be around an environment where everyone was fighting all the time. When Clint was done telling him that he needed to stop pretending, for a second, that the Accords business had been about protecting the team. When Clint was done telling him about how he needed to get over his issues because they were a team still, and that even though everyone didn’t like his arrogance and his holier-than-thou attitude, they were still around so the genius had to shut the fuck up and man up. How he needed to stop pretending like he was so much better than Wanda.
Tony’s hands had been shaking.
Yeah you're a soldier now - fighting in a battle
Tony screams, and the whole room goes eerily silent. The fight goes out of him and he slumps against the table. His shoulders sag with what feels like the weight of the world as he takes ragged breaths. His fingers itch to drum against a reactor that is no longer there. “You have no idea why I made Ultron. You were afraid, too, all of you. Natasha’s memories of the red room, Cap’s life before the tesseract, Bruce’s,” here, his voice breaks. “Bruce’s fear of losing himself into the Hulk. I get it, I get that you were all afraid after that, but I—I couldn’t help with that. I couldn’t change what had already happened to you all. You,” for the first time in what feels like forever Tony’s eyes meet Steve’s. “Were the only ones who could get over those fears. Other than Bruce, you wouldn’t have understood what it felt like to be shown something that could destroy everyone else, and know that it was your fault.”
, the bitter part of Tony’s brain snidely suggests. Tony snarls at it to shut up, and closes his eyes tightly. God, he had been doing so well without the headaches lately. This is exactly why he tends to avoid these types of conversations. Why, in interviews, he steers the talk away from his… acquaintances and redirects it to the good they’re doing with the new heroes. For those who were willing to sign the original accords, and those who didn’t buy the bureaucratic bullshit. The rebuilding of the cities they destroyed. The grants and scholarships and awards and all the shit he’s set in motion to try to
Steve winces internally, but forces himself not to show the other boy anything. Tony knows how to read him too well now, but whatever internal conflict he’s having appears to be keeping him from pointing out Steve’s shitty attempt at nonchalance. Steve feels relieved. Then hates himself for feeling relieved; for causing Tony this much pain.
The SteveTony playlist will come soon and will be appropriately sappy and depressing.
“Aw, ‘Teve!” and then a giggle. Sam turns wide eyed at Baby Bart who claps at the attention he gets. And then he points at the blond, and says, “’Teve!” the man in question is watching the baby open mouthed. In the past few days, while everyone has made a concentrated effort in befriending the children, nobody has managed to make Baby Bart pronounce their names. Except for Sam that first day, and nobody quite knows why Baby Bart decided he was worthy. Mostly, he merely points. The only words the boy seems to really want to say being Mumma and ‘Onny. Needless to say, the competitive bastards had turned it into a metaphorical bloodbath.
“What the fuck is he doing here? You said we were safe here,” Clint bites out. Sam has an arm around him, now, and the rest of them have made their way in.
it, you know, the way these assholes were using him. The way they’d give him a little bit of attention, and there was this kid tripping over himself to make them happy. So I tried to be better, you know, for him. A better friend. It was so fucking hard to get him to believe that I
“But how many of those people find you alone and isolated, huh? How many of those people find you completely alone? Tony,” Steve grabs hold of his shoulders though he resists the urge to shake the other man. “What did she say to you?”
“Mmmkay,” Tony says, eyes already drooping.
to whom he gave
“It didn’t seem fair for us to be the only ones that got that option,” Tony tells him sincerely. There’s respect in the other man’s eyes when they meet his own. “We’ve fucked up too much to think that we have the moral high ground. I can’t, personally, believe that my choices are the best ones. I need a policing force, I need someone to be there to fight me when I need it, I need someone to keep me from making the same mistakes that I have in the past, and I think this could work. It’s what I wanted from the original Sokovia Accords,” his eyes meet T’Challa’s and there is something like pride in the other man’s gaze. Now that he’s started, Tony doesn’t think that he will be able to stop. All the anger, hurt, and accusation he’s been taking and hoarding for the past years seem to be making a cathartic exit. He feels like, more than wanting to tell the others this, he
“You can start by talking to your own son, if you can’t talk to your teammates,” Laura’s voice snaps him out of the reverie. “You—don’t take this the wrong way, but you moved all the way to New York when she needed help but you won’t cross the compound to speak to your own son. He’s as observant as you are, Clint, and he’s noticed.”
“But—“
Steve turns around and his heart sinks to his stomach when he sees the face on the screen. Bucky curses quietly under his breath as he looks at the “Surprise Guest” the gossip show had been boasting about earlier. Tony Stark sits on a plush couch, his goatie is immaculately trimmed and his suit fits him like a glove; to anyone who doesn’t know him he looks poised and but together. But he’s wearing sunglasses, and he has his hands clasped between his knees in a way that, even now, Steve knows belies his anxiety. The words “broken engagement” blur in Steve’s eyes under his picture.
“I’m not about to send you out there on your own. No, Peter,” Steve says with an authoritative tone. “Believe it or not, you two are still just kids. I know you go out on patrol, okay, and you’re doing incredibly well, all things considered. But you wouldn’t be going out as Spider-Man, right? It’d just be Peter Parker out there with a civilian. What would you do if someone tries to pick you off the street and Harley is with you? Not to mention the fact that if some asshole with a camera gets a shot of you and Tony, then what? How do you even begin to explain that? It’d be a PR nightmare, all three of us know that, and definitely the last thing Tony would need right now.” The boys still look like they want to tear him limb from limb, though that’s how they’ve looked for the past few days of the genius’s isolation, so he soldiers on. “Let me go bring him back. Once he’s safe in the tower, he’ll need you.” The boys look at each other, and steve knows they’re about to argue, so he tries his last card. “Please, just let me do this. I have to the right thing, just this once, I have to prove myself to him.”
, he doesn’t think he’s ever going to forget. Sam is pulling Bucky into the apartment, neither one of them bothering to take off their layers or even their shoes, as they trudge in and make a straight line for the living room. Steve’s worry spikes as soon as they make their noisy entrance; Bucky is on the phone, but not speaking, and Sam’s face is set into a worried frown.
Harley grins even further, and then laughs right along with him. “Ginny is going through a phase,” he says in that long suffering big brother tone that Tony has heard too many times from Rhodey. “I’m waiting for her to get to, like, the Hamilton part of her show tune obsession.”
Because he was looking for a place to sit, and not at Barton, he was able to see the stormy look on Rogers’s face. For a second he thought he would be berated yet again. That now that Rogers had everything he wanted at his fingertips he would lay onto Tony and they would get the screaming match they were overdue in. so he was surprised when the Captain, he would never be anything else, got up to his feet and leveled a reproachful look over Tony’s shoulder.
“Yes, well,” Tony is, in one of the rare occasions in his life, left speechless.
was in danger and needed him.
“You decided signing your life away was the right choice?” Barton asks him, and the only reason Tony doesn’t lay on him then is because his tone is the softest it has been in his presence for months. He doesn’t feel like shattering the tenuous peace.
He counts the people he has to prove his worth to, and though it seems like an impossible task when not even Tony himself seems to be able to forgive him, he’s glad. He is so fucking glad that Tony has found this mismatched group of individuals who deeply care about him. He is so glad that despite the carelessness of his letter, how callously he’d called the Avengers Tony’s when they had followed
“What’s the score now?” Sam says through a mouthful of mashed potatoes, an incredulous look on his face.
“I just—I was wrong,” and Tony barely stopped himself from saying
“What Ross presented me with at the beginning,” Tony says and Natasha coughs next to him though ironically the sound she makes sounds a lot like
And yet, nothing has prepared him for facing the wrath of a mother incensed at the fact that he can’t seem to watch his fucking mouth around her prepubescent kid. Just remembering the last conversation he’d had with Harley’s mother gives him shivers. The trek from the conference room to the communal dining room is solemn in his and the squirt’s parts. Cap, the bastard, has amusement rolling out of him in waves.
“Thanks, Fry,” Tony takes care to meet Harley’s eyes head on. “I will be okay, Har. We’re just talking,” he tries not to think about how
Steve reads the same sentence over and over again. Wills his brain to believe that maybe Tony might be alive. Somewhere. Wishes that he were home, with his friends who know him and his love for the other man, so that he could feel a support system when it feels like his whole world is crumbling down around him again.
, Christ, before his arms wrap around the boy just as tightly. He gives a wet chuckle, and then says quietly, “okay, shortstack.”
the thought that we all took to her the way we did! What, you think we betrayed you? That we all took her side instead of yours? Well, newsflash, asshole, that’s what happens when you’re not a piece of shit!”
“Tones,” Rhodey’s voice comes from behind the team. He’s standing at parade rest, something he hasn’t done around these people in a long time, but the tension in his frame is visible. As is the angry glare he gives the room at large. “I think it’s time for us to go. Mom is on the phone.”
Tiberius goes to trial, but he doesn’t go to prison for what he’s done. He walks out of the courtroom like a fucking movie star holding the hand of some blond super-model girl and waving exuberantly at the camera. He gets to call Tony all manner of dirty lies and ugly names, and gets away with it. He’s exonerated after a video is suspiciously given to the court at the last minute wherein Tony supposedly leaves the room after their nightly activities. Tony can’t contest it because, under the influence of alcohol and god knows what else, he’s lost a good chunk of time.
Seeing those two go out together, seeing Cooper allow his father to wrap an arm around his shoulders and pull him close, had given him more hope than anything. It seemed as though, slowly but surely, they were pulling themselves back together again. Steve would do whatever he could, even if it was something as simple as baby sitting. He was the one that called Clint out of retirement, after all, and yet… yet here they were.
“It’s about tomorrow, actually,” he said and watched Tony’s face carefully. He needn’t have bothered, though, the mechanic might be a master at keeping his face unchanged but his eyes always gave him away. Steve suspected that’s why he liked his tinted sunglasses so much. He saw the challenge brewing up in Tony’s eyes, and he braced himself.
“Yeah, I made the mistake of calling this scrap of metal I was working on a useless piece of shit. I must have been, what, six? And then Jarvis walked in with this severely disappointed frown on his face. I don’t think I’ve run as fast as I did that day. I wasn’t fast enough,” Tony says, throwing the blond a grin. “He was one tall gentleman, and he easily grabbed me and scooped me up and took me to the kitchen. The worst part was that Ana was there, so I was forced to hear as he recounted my little tantrum and then he handed me over. Ana was
To all of you wonderful, lovely people who left encouraging comments and love when I decided to discontinue this fic, I want you to know that you all made me feel so, so much better. It legit brought tears to my eyes to have you guys tell me that you understood. I'm so grateful that you have given me the time and the open-mindedness to read through this and wait patiently for updates. I am so so grateful for each and every one of you.
When they separated, Tony leaned back on the couch and tugged until Steve was sitting next to him. He didn’t let go of the mechanic’s hand, but he draped an arm around his shoulders. Tony wiggled around until he was comfortably nestled against Steve’s side. They didn’t say anything, but Steve was grateful for the silence. His mind began to whirl around with the things Tony had told him. Now it was Tony’s thumb running soothing circles on his hand.
“Then he didn’t sign them,” Tony says simply.
“I got her a new one!”
“Rhodes—” the name is strangled out of his throat as he gets off his chair and onto his knees in an easy glide to the floor. It’s so simple, ingrained in his memories now as something that he just
“’Onny,” the baby said brokenly. Steve froze, and everyone else did the same. After the last few weeks of Barton’s anger and jealousy everyone expected a meltdown. The baby sensed the tension in the room and merely fussed more. “Wan’ Unc’a ‘Onny. Dada, Unc’a ‘Onny.”
right out of the room with it. Tony, he notices with an unreasonable sense of panic, is inching away from him. Without thinking, and even if he had he knows he would have done the same, he grabbed hold of the genius’s hand and threaded their fingers together on top of his thigh. Brown eyes blinked up at him in confusion, something like awe deep in them, but he didn’t try to pull it away. Steve let out a breath and turned to look at the entrance.
“He’s got the boys for that. They’ll take care of him,” and though Sam hadn’t said it in as many words, the message was implied.
, he just can’t. Steve’s other arm wraps around him to bring him closer, and Tony’s hands go up to rest against the other man’s frankly impressive chest.
“Carte blanche,” T’Challa responds and his fists close in spasmodic anger.
“Boss left the tower approximately forty five minutes ago,” her voice is as frosty as it always is when she addresses him. He has no time to feel hurt over that because he’s steadily working his way to panic. Where in the hell could Tony have gone?
“We have compelling evidence, now. We have enough to make the case moot, and the Stark Foundation is getting more donors. Plus, the information that Bruce had saved for me was damning enough. That had nothing to do with me.”
“He has a chemistry test that he can’t afford to not study for, so no you are not. Aunt May would dismember us both.”
“You just go get him, and bring him back,” Steve opens his mouth to agree quickly, but Peter cuts him off. “
and I was
“I have a bad feeling about this, Cap,” Natasha has that look in her face that says she won’t be letting this go anytime soon. Steve sighs, sitting at the table with her because he knows she wont let it go and will probably just follow him into his room. He’s been keeping his private spaces just that for the past two years, which is hard sometimes when there’s four people on the run trying to hide at the bottom of the barrel so that no one can find them.
, that there were people who didn’t allow themselves to be blinded to the genius’s goodness. There is also a small part of himself that feels vindicated, that feels as though he should tell Tony a big
“How long has it been since she was supposed to check in?” He says, eyes drifting over to Sam and the TV. There’s some sort of natural disaster going on somewhere, there are people running around on the television and the footage looks shaky; the strip at the bottom just says “BREAKING NEWS” in alarmingly red letters.
“I’ll kill him,” Bucky hisses, gearing up towards the door. Sam had grabbed his arm and pulled him back onto the couch. When the other man had insisted on going, Sam had only needed to send him a glare for him to calm down.
“That’s right! That’s another hundred on your college fund,” Tony says with a grin and gets a snort from Cooper again and a longer sigh from Danielle. “But anyway, this is the Avengers Facility. Earth’s mightiest heroes? Most decidedly,” he points to the disposal, “
thinks of him that way.
“Har said a no-no word,” Ginny says from beside her mother, the traitor, and giggles
Maybe if he had used the stupid anachronism that was the flip phone when he didn’t have to deal with Cap being
“Start sim again.”
, the voice that is usually too quiet in his head says,
The first, and in the grand scheme of things it might seem trivial but it wasn’t really, not for a boy like him: Peter Quill.
“Carol,” the name tumbles out of his mouth. He can’t fucking believe it. They had looked for her fucking everywhere. Fury had said he had lost contact, Rhodes had gone near mad with anger, and Tony had ended up with far too many burns trying to make a way to track her. And here she is. “Holy shit, it is good to see you.”
“No wonder the Stark Foundation has been everywhere since then. What was it? Trying to ease the guilt of creating a homicidal robot?” Barton says, and the tone of his voice is cruel.
“Could you—“Steve bites his lip and drops his fingers. Tony wants to call him back, please, but he keeps his mouth shut. “Could you see yourself… getting there? Someday?”
“Tony, you are—you’ve been the best friend I’ve had since… well, maybe ever,” Steve whispers like it’s some frail truth he doesn’t want to shatter. Doesn’t want to soil with the weight of their mistakes.
*Shows up 3 days late with Starbucks*  'Sup?
He doesn’t drop to his knees until he reads what’s on the post-it note right on top of the star.
He’s so lost in his thoughts that he doesn’t notice when a little person drops on the seat right next to his. It’s only when the other person’s plate clatters on the table that he looks up, startled. When he notices who it is, his fork hits his plate with a loud clank.
“Classy. So when things don’t go your way, they’re bullshit? Real mature, Stark,” Barton’s voice bites out from behind him. Tony turns around, thinking that diplomacy and keeping the peace be damned, but someone gets there faster.
"Sir. All lights have been switched off. Would you like me to play you that voicemail of Captain Rogers's you enjoy?"
Tony let his eyes close again, this time hearing the soft clop of footsteps taking the stairs up to his room and Tony groaned, trying his best to block out the noise and focus instead on who he wished it was rather than who he was more than well aware it was going to be.
Saying those exact words and finally having the courage to say part of Captain America's name out loud had left Tony in a state of disbelief, gone were the times when he would have happily yelled out Steve's name and begged him to understand, gone were the times where he no longer was scared to show his true emotions, something that had really destroyed his body whilst his shaking hand had been raised slightly, facing directly towards Steve Rogers, ready to strike at any second in such a way that could have tore Captain Rogers into two pieces but despite his anger he had never wanted to truly hurt him, the only thing that he had wanted was Barnes, he had wanted to continue to punch the crap out of that murderer and to have never stopped.
"Tony."
Steve had known, hadn't he? He had known that whole time about what that thing had done, he had known all that time and had never even bothered to inform Tony until that fateful moment that Tony had been forced by Zemo to view the footage as it had happened. Had to view the very moment of that awful car crash all over again, been forced to watch as his parents car had hit the tree, how that disgusting thing, that Winter Soldier had walked over, punching his fathers skull in before he had simply turned on his mother and choked her to death. The Winter Soldier had been behind all that.
Bright white light invaded his senses that very moment and Tony groaned, his hand coming up to shade his eyes against the outer light and wondering why he had even woke up at this god-damn too early point in the morning anyway, a few seconds later though he was reminded as a loud shrill of sound, some annoying woman singing about trying to listen to your heart until Tony couldn't stand it anymore.
"You had better not be about to say something so incredibly corny right about now Mr Rogers or else I will throw you right back into this ice."
"Oh for gods sake, Tony, wake the hell up."
At least that's what Tony still liked to tell himself, the reality itself was much worse as he had first come to miss the extra body heat in his bed, he missed going to sleep feeling relaxed whilst his arms would curl around Steve's waist, Steve resting his chin on the top of Tony's head, both of them not needing to move an inch, he missed waking up during the night, trying to break out of a nightmare to find Steve already awake as if alerted, eyes looking at him with concern as he held Tony's chin softly in his hands, getting Tony to breathe with him, softly uttering to him that it was all going to be okay, it had just been a nightmare and in the end just letting him cry it all out all over his chest.
"You are kidding me right? Mr Captain America is scared of something? Steve, I grew up hearing all your stories from my dad and they were impressive, not about someone who was , they were about someone who was and continues to be brave and strong and lives up to the typical American Dream. You are mppphh.."
"He's my best friend."
He had been the reason behind of all this, the reason that Tony had never felt more alone than the night of his parents murder, the reason why he and Steve had been standing on slight opposite ends of the room.
Remembering that the reason for the invading noise was F.R.I.D.A.Y. setting his alarm late last night - Tony was pretty sure that Pepper had told her to do it - so that he would be awake to go and do something that Pepper had been nagging him about for the last month or so and had never gotten further than telling Tony to get his ass out of bed before Tony would throw his covers over his head, telling F.R.I.D.A.Y to shut out all noise and light and not to allow anyone anymore access to his room and Pepper would storm out, rolling her eyes and referring to him as a troublesome two year old until Tony would fall back asleep, quite keen to block out the world all over again, Tony grabbed at the offending item, pulling loosely on the cord until suddenly the woman's shrieking had stopped as his alarm hit the ground and shattered upon impact, a mess of wires and broken glass and plastic all that remained of the damn thing.
"You have me. That's one but also you have a big group of friends who believe in you and know that you can do it too. But most important of all, despite all of your best efforts to deny the thought, you have courage Tony, more so than what I had."
, and himself is too great and he has lost communication. He can’t, though, he cannot do that to his child. At the very least, he needs Peter to know that he loves them. At the very least, Peter will be able to give Morgan his love and all the kisses Tony is going to miss. He’d already had to override Karen so that the suit disengaged the parachute and took his child home and he doesn’t think he’s able to have another goodbye.
“Okay, so we know where we’re going. How about we break and agree to meet at,” he looked down at his watch and noticed it was near four thirty in the afternoon. “Six for supper. We can raid the kitchen—“
They have been connected far longer than they thought.
Tony barely sees Sam come into the room, his easy smile quickly falling from his face, before there’s a fist connecting with his jaw. His head snaps to the side, and he can feel the sting of tears in his eyes. He thanks whatever deity is looking out for him,
“He wasn’t,” and it comes out a lot more bitingly than Tony intended.
Anyway, long rant, but the gist of it is that i hope i can write the next chapter soon. i'm gonna have to re read this whole thing again to get my bearings lol
They lapsed into a tense silence as Stark stared at him and Clint stared back, trying to unjumble his thoughts. He kept circling back to what the other man had said, about his memories and his triggers. About the description,
Tony had wondered before those words if it had really been possible for his whole body to shut down and it had been answered, he had known even back then that he had never wanted to hear another single word from Rogers ever again because that small thought of that man opening his mouth and saying something much worse had been too much for Tony to have fully comprehended.
But the worst thing that that organisation had done was playing with the thing's mind making him think that anything to do with S.H.I.E L.D. was bad, that anything including Captain Rogers and they had messed the man's thoughts up so far until James Buchanan had been so far under the influence of HYDRA that he had been privy to their very ways, knew the rules inside and out and when all hope had finally been lost, the leader of HYDRA had ordered Barnes to cause the car crash that would delay his parents, had ordered the man to follow out the attack and kill them both if he had been unable to get the serum, the one that Hydra had always wanted more than anything else in this cruel world so that they could try their best to make more of those things that his father had made Steve all those years ago.
That wasn't the reason why he had designed her, he had originally designed F.R.I.D.A.Y. as a way to help them out after the outbreak of Ultron and she had proved to be very useful so he had agreed to keep her on but after a certain amount of time the A.I. had seemed to suddenly get a mind of her own and from there had become very prone to speaking her mind which Tony knew was both a blessing and a curse in disguise.
"Why can't you just answer your phone? I needed you to be here and you let me down. No, scratch that you let the Avengers down. I get that you like to think that you are some sort of Mr Macho guy but don't you understand how many people you are hurting right now by acting like such a spoilt brat? That's not really fair Tony." The message stopped suddenly as Tony heard Steve's voice on the other end pause to take in a deep breath, his voice slowly starting to crack as he continues.
"Get the hell out of my way Rogers."
The truth that in such a small period of time had somehow managed to break Tony's heart into a thousand tiny pieces, shaking him to his core as he had come to understand that Captain Steve Rogers had never been the man that he had always pretended to be. He hadn't even been close anymore to the man that Tony had fallen in love with all those years ago.
"Everyone's looking for you to give a speech and I don't know about you but the Tony Stark I know never shy's away from talking about himself."
But and the biggest factor that had caused Tony to spend the next year or so in his bed, refusing to talk with anyone or leave for any reason whatsoever, the one true fact that had hurt most behind why Captain Rogers had never told him the whole and honest truth about that Winter Soldier, what he had done was despite Rogers showing himself to be, loyal, trustworthy and good at controlling anger in any room, the man had never seemed to understand that that, that thing he had put all his trust into so many years ago wasn't the same person as Rogers had originally thought.
"Steve?.."
"I love you Tony and although I hate so much to admit it, I miss you. I know that we have a major difference of opinion and I'm so sorry about the arc reactor but he is my best friend and I couldn't let you kill him despite what I know about him, I knew Howard too. Tony... I... Urgh... Why must you make these things so difficult and just leave me not knowing what to think. We're going to..."
Tony snorted, the idea of Captain America being terrified was something that he found hard to believe especially as he had seen the guy take on a horde of HYDRA soldiers without breaking a sweat and then to actually hear about the guy beating the crap out of his own best friend, one Bucky Barnes so he wouldn't hurt anyone when the Winter Soldier had terrorised New York. Yeah, Tony wasn't even close to believing that Captain America was scared of something.
Thinking back on it now, Tony had became slowly very aware of the fact that this had been Steve's biggest problem.
"Tony."
"Yeah? Well guess what F.R.I.D.A.Y., I'm not Steve fucking Rogers so just do as I asked you the first time. Or I'll make sure you don't speak out of turn again."
"So was I..."
Steve seemed to tilt his head quizzically to the side after Tony spoke, looking almost like Tony had told him that he had carrots for arms instead of making fun of the super soldiers way of speaking but then the other man seemed to smile, as if he had understood it.
That same very son who had become very confused over time as he hadn't seen any cars coming up the drive as he was eventually shooed up to his bed just slightly after one am by the Stark's butler Edwin Jarvis whom had worked for Howard Stark since the man had been quite young himself, curling up in his sheets, Jarvis reading softly to him and putting on all the voices for the characters until the four year old had fallen asleep not even aware that his parents were dead.
"Tony. Goddammit" The first words of the voicemail began to play, Tony immediately feeling his head start to go fuzzy and his breathing to grow more laboured as he listened on, not having to think as he knew every single word off by heart, he knew that this was the reason as to why he hadn't jumped either when it had began to play, he was just used to it now.
"Tony." Steve's voice had snapped his attention away from the thing that had huddled in the corner and instead had brought his eyes straight to those of Captain America's own loving, blue eyes.
No matter how many times Tony had tried to tell the man otherwise, he had still somehow managed to find some way to trust the very man who had murdered his parents in cold blood and he hadn't even seemed to care that this hurt Tony to the very core of his being or that this had just served as evidence to the truth of how Rogers had really felt about him.
Most of all, he had just wanted to let that thing know the true meaning of the word pain.
And it would be in that moment that Steve would look over his way, a wide smile on his face once he realised Tony was awake as he would wander over, pushing his ever growing blonde hair back out of his face despite how it only fell forward around his eyes and he would lean forward, kneeling onto the bed, caressing a hand up Tony's side, Tony's breath catching in his throat as it always did when Steve had touched him in this way, forgetting everything except that soft smile on his face as Steve would place a hand on top of his arc reactor, pressing soft kisses to the surrounding area of skin before Tony could no longer stand it and would run his fingers under Steve's chin, tilting his face up to meet his own as they would kiss, lips to lips, Tony curling his hands into Steve's hair whilst Steve would wrap his arms around Tony's waist and they would stay there for a good while until Tony would push Steve away playfully, refusing to keep kissing him again until he had showered.
"Hey."
It was Pepper Potts, his assistant and former girlfriend, usually a kind spirit with a smile on her face, the opposite was clear now as Tony stared over Pepper, trying to work one of his best apology smiles onto his face that usually always made everyone crumble at his feet, the same could not be said of Pepper right now though.
. If his time to drift off has finally come, even when
Tasha’s voice whispered in his head. It had been after the battle of New York when Tony’s mouth was running a thousand miles a minute. When he was trying to convince them that the Tower was the best place for them to be. When he was attempting to restrain himself from sounded too eager as he offered them his home. After, when only Tasha and Clint had agreed because it was late and they were exhausted and Tony had been unable to sleep and Tasha had found him nursing a tumbler of scotch while he sat in front of the floor to ceiling window.
He keeps track of the other man. Sends a pray to a God he doesn’t even know he believes in every time Tony does something to his health. There’s been more rehab stunts since then. A couple suicide attempts that had been almost enough to send Steve running, consequences be damned. Nobody says anything about Jarvis, the press aren’t interested in the employees, but he had been there holding onto Tony every time after one of his stays. He’s gone when Tony shuffles into the public again, and that is enough for Steve to know that the last of Tony’s family is gone.
“Laura, where is To—“ her eyes go impossibly round as she catches sight of the man on the couch. Tony bites his lip at the noise Lang makes, and then his daughter is tearing to his side with a heartbreaking chant of “Daddy, daddy,
“Mr. Stark,” the voice snaps his gaze away from the blond and to another, petite blond with an impressive green glare. Tony swallows hard, and pretends he doesn’t hear the twin snickers from his boys.
Steve thought to himself. It was hard, though, when Tony got to his feet like a big cat ready to spring. His muscles coiled defensively and a look in his eyes that was assessing.
The next three years, Steve gets an internship in London as a curator. He takes it as a way to leave his past behind and maybe get some distance from his current obsession. Though his days had stayed much the same as at the beginning, Steve has found what he considers a healthy middle ground. He still has bad days when he thinks of his old lover and a pain so intense hits him that all he can do is take a moment to breathe through it. He still avoids Manhattan unless he absolutely has to, the last year especially after rumors of the genius’s return start to circulate, and everything else that might remind him of his loss.
“Miss Romanov?” T’Challa asks and the woman shrugs.
When he hears DUM-E beep quietly, though decidedly defensive, he thinks it’s about time he intervenes. Harley is grinning though Peter is reaching Tony’s level of scolding the poor boy, hand on his hip and the other pointing at the bot.
Steve’s whole expression broke at that. His hands, shaking, moved to grasp at Tony’s wrists. If Tony weren’t so emotionally fucked up at the moment he would have found it strange that despite the fact they had literally almost killed each other, Steve holding onto him didn’t set the warning bells ringing this time. Or maybe it was the fact that the other man looked like the only thing tethering him was the hold he had on the mechanic. “I didn’t—“
compound, under
, all right. There you go. We had a conversation. Have a nice life.”
“Someone woke up missing you,” Tony says fondly as he looks at the baby in his arms. The bot displays his newest trick and blows a raspberry at the genius. The dark-haired man looks affronted at the boy and then tickles him, a grin on his face. “Oh, that’s how it is? Huh, troublemaker?” Steve can’t help his laugh as he tries to shield the boy, throwing him into even louder giggles.
“I just want to make sure--” Steve had muttered. He’d given one feeble attempt to yank his arm away, but he didn’t want to hurt his friend. Not one more.
“Yes?” he says, barely able to breath, as he turns his head in acknowledgment though he doesn’t look at the other man.
of all places.
Yet he did, because he could never leave it alone, because there was too much to do and too little of himself left to do it. Because there was a boy, a child, with trembling fingers and big brown eyes looking down at him in fear. Because when Tony reached out the kid,
Though he didn’t say it out right, it was fairly implied that the agent meant Tony. The tightening of Wanda’s jaw said that she knew it, too. The mood in the room took a deep dive after that, and soon Peter and Harley were scrambling to put their dirty dishes in the washing machine and crowding around Tony. Rhodey, as well, managed to get to his feet with only a quiet grunt of pain before he was moving towards the exit and telling Tony that he would be waiting for him in the lab.
“”Be angry,” Steve hissed at him, shaking him. “Scream at me, be angry, be hurt, be indignant; hell, Tony, call the suits and
, Sam! That bastard hurt my best friend! I told him what would happen, I warned him—”
The day the strawberry blonde woman walks into the museum with Maria, he is convinced that miracles do exist. He doesn’t pay much attention to them, worried with his own tasks, and only looks up when he hears the voice from other side of the room. He turns and sees a man has joined the women, and something about the arch of his back and his hair has him narrowing his eyes on his figure. The man leans forward, shakes Maria’s hand and says something that makes her smirk, before the blonde pushes him lightly in what is clearly a friendly gesture. Steve looks back down at the tablet in his hand, but he can’t quite shake the feeling that something about the man feels familiar.
After what feels like forever, Tony’s arm snakes around his waist. Steve presses kisses into his hair and wishes he didn’t feel so useless.
After all, pardons don’t award themselves.
Steve is left to stare at the door where his best friend since Kindergarten has just walked out of to comfort someone else. He doesn’t know what he feels, in that moment, but he will soon enough. Bucky has been with him for so many things, and the fact that he’s
“Tony,” Steve whispers and he’s so close Tony can feel his breath tickling his nose.
[From: The Bug
“And what would those big threats be?” T’Challa asks, and for a moment Tony is surprised before he remembers that the young king hadn’t been around for that particular fuck up. Sometimes it feels like the young man has been around since the beginning of their ragtag team.
“It’s okay,” Tony croaks out, mostly out of habit, and Tasha smiles sadly at him.
Before he can say anything, though, Sam bites off a “man, cut that shit out.”
Still, Aunt Peggy would light up at seeing him every time. And, for the first time in forever, Tony wouldn’t even being compared or confused with his father. He’d cherish every stroke of her frail fingers on his goatee and the feel of her breath in his hair as he pulled her close. He’d bring her flowers, sunflowers every time, and read her the sports section of the newspaper and smile at her cursing over yet another loss for the Mets. He’d hold her hand and hum, or sing if she managed to persuade her, as she faded off to sleep. He’d go home and put more money on medical research, equipment, anything to find a way to get her back and fail as he always did.
Suddenly there’s hands on his face, and for a wildly horrible second, he claws at them. He desperately tears at the hands holding him, and his gaze is a haze of bloody red and spots of black, before the sound of Steve’s gentle
“Then I think you know what to do.”
Steve winces and tries to block the images out his head. One night, while he clutched the burner phone on one hand, and leaned against the table with the other he had gone hunting for any sort of information that he could on his former teammate. He’d been slapped right across the face with the headlines of Tony’s proposal. Worse, still, was the photos of the aftermath. The look on Pepper’s face as she shook her head, and the devastation that even with the tinted glasses Tony wasn’t able to hide. The plastic smiles on both their faces as they apologized for wasting the press’s time and walked out. That had been a few days before Steve’s hunt for information. From then on, there were merely canned words from Pepper as they caught her going to her house, or the sound of repulsors as Tony vehemently refused to answer any questions.
“B-boss—boss” FRIDAY’s voice comes to him through static and his heart beats a loud staccato in his chest.
Sam: Steve, for real. Call me. Don’t—don’t check the news okay.
When they come back it’s to a house that looks familiar, but does not hold the same kind of feeling of
Tony closes his eyes, trying his best to force himself to force himself away from the blond, but then Steve’s thumb brushes against his lower lip. The sense of
okay, they were still his best friends. Anyways, that summer was impressed in Tony’s memory forever for two very pivotal reasons.
“I’d just like a moment. I’m not trying to pick a fight,” the tone suggests that it’s hard for the other man to sound civil.
“Clint,” Laura said in warning.
“I’m his father,” he said, and Tony had never heard him sound so serious. Laura’s eyes narrowed into slits.
” Tony’s voice gives. His hand trembles.
you. I left myself wide open for you, all of you, and at the first sign of trouble you turned on me. You turned on me for someone that had tried to destroy us. I should have known,” Tony bemoaned raising a shaking hand to rub at his forehead. “I should have known that you all would be just like everyone else. Ty, Obie, everyone else who’d taught me better, and I
, shook him with as much rancor as he wanted thought his hands were shaking. “You’re so full of shit. What, you think you could act repentant and I’d forgive you? Poor little rich boy Tony just needs some attention! Poor little brat is such an idiot! Poor
“You knew Peggy,” Steve says, and his voice sounds faint.
Steve turns to Wanda, notices the crestfallen expression on her face, and Vision’s disapproving look into the pot he’s stirring, and falls silent. So much for hoping, it seems. He continues to feed the baby in silence, finding comfort in the way Nate trusts him to keep him safe, and tries not to think about what had just happened. A big part of him wants to take Wanda aside and have a chat with her, but he knows that she’s feeling guilty enough as it is. Maybe not about Tony, and he feels his hackles rising at the thought, but about making the boys uncomfortable. He makes a mental note to try to talk to her at a later date.
Tony rears back and shakes his head to dislodge the vision. God, he was a failure. Now Harley looked even more stressed out than before. He was such a piece of shit sometimes. “Fine. I’m fine, Har. Just… minor step back, you know how it is.”
'No."
That very reason, no thing, no whatever it had been had stood less than an inch away from Steve, curled into a slight ball, holding his stomach whilst a large gash in his head had split open again after Tony had punched him in the face from earlier, blood had been running down one side of his cheek and that thing had not even cared, 'Good' Tony had thought to himself despite the lack of reaction he had received from the man who had been standing behind Steve, 'he deserves to feel the pain that I have felt all these years.'
That thing wasn't despite all of Rogers's attempts to argue the opposite his truest best friend that the captain had originally believed to have fallen to his death during the second world war, instead that thing had been rebuilt by the very same horrible organisation that they had tried to fight once before, they had plagued his mind, erasing all the man's original memories of his life before the fall.
Tony Stark's eyes snapped open almost as if against their own will that cool June morning, he was shaking, feeling both too hot and too cold at the same time whilst he could feel the thin sheen of sweat that covered his brow and he was only too well aware of the tight pain in his chest, the arc reactor in the middle of said chest feeling like it had suddenly grown five sizes in a short period of time and was now pressing down on him, trying to choke the life out of him.
"Turn all the lights off.. And close those damn curtains."
'Kill him. He destroyed your family. You know it's the right thing to do'
In his dream, Tony could feel the cool night swirling around him, a soft wind tousling his hair, doing nothing to douse the feeling of warmth deep inside him as he felt someone walk up behind him, arms coming up to wrap around his waist and warm lips touching softly at the side of his neck, causing Tony to shiver involuntarily at the feeling.
'I'm so sorry Steve" Tony thought to himself, grasping the pillow tightly, his eyes half open as he started to feel a build up of moisture before the tears spilled over, sliding down his face to plop onto the pillow below.
"And a good morning to you too Pep. What seems to have got you looking so well annoyed?"
The sound that erupted from Steve in that second was one that Tony had only heard on a few occasions - the most prominent one being when Thor had almost screamed the tower down when Clint had replaced his shampoo with Nair causing the Asgardian prince to run around trying to pick up his fallen hair whilst Steve had stood in the kitchen, looking very confused, brows furrowed before something had seemed to come over the Captain and he had doubled over, unable to stop the bark of laughter that escaped his lips and even when Tony had entered the kitchen a few moments later asking him what was so funny, Steve had been unable to respond, still laughing and holding a hand to his side as if in stitches, that was the first time that Tony had thought of Steve as someone who could let their guard down and he had smiled softly to himself, that had also been the moment that he had found himself falling in love with Steve Rogers, the man himself and not the hero that his father had made the man out to be - and now, Tony couldn't help but smile again as he heard that same bark of laughter escape from the Captain's lips now, the others chest rising and falling as he laughed.
The buzzing noise returned a few moments and unlike last time within a few seconds, Steve's voice started to fill the empty bedroom, Tony softly closing his eyes over, muttering the words to himself whilst a small part of his brain was letting him fall back into a land of dreams where he could be happy and be back with Steve, ever so happy and content as they danced together on the dance floor, Steve's hands on his waist whilst Tony had his head on Steve's shoulder, it was something that Tony had only ever dreamed of but the reality was not to be.
"Steve."
"Steve?"
But Tony had come to realise over time that despite what he thought deep down inside his own mind, it could never be be replaced by how he had a huge part to play in regards to the way he had treated everyone, his reputation as a hothead had been common knowledge to all but yet no-one seemed to care until it was too late and Tony was in the middle of throwing items around the room, his voice rising with each item, every moment he continued to let his anger overtake him.
But the one thing that Tony now missed more than anything was how no matter where they were, whether they were in the same bed, on opposite sides of the room or in the middle of a fight with the Avengers, he and Steve would always find each other, their gazes locking with one another and in that moment each man knew what the other was thinking, both never too afraid to let their love shine right through to their cores, knowing that they would always look out for one another.
Tony couldn't help it, he turned around in the Captain's hold, quirking one eyebrow up as if he couldn't quite believe that he had something now in the current twenty-first century that one Steve Rogers didn't have back during the war.
"I apologise for being out of line."
Prologue
"You're right F.R.I.D.A.Y., it isn't any of your god damn business so just do what I said. Now."
Oh boy, he was in trouble...
And that was why he had been there, wasn't it? In that small enclosed space, staring at Steve Rogers.
Tony's hand darted up to clutch at the metal outline of his arc reactor, feeling the outer casing, taking in deeps breaths as he tried to recall to himself that he had a reason for doing this, he wasn't crazy, he had done the right thing, right?
"Of course sir." And Tony had to stop himself from letting a small smirk cross his face at how scared his A.I. sounded all of a sudden as if she were some sort of dog that had just been given in trouble for peeing on the carpet despite being fully housed trained.
